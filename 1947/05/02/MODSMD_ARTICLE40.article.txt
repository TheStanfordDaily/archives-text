To the Editor:
The Stanford Convalescent Home's beginnings
seem to have got a little blurred in the archives!
Those beginnings were so typically Stanford, —a
"Family" alTair, a blend of service and fun, a fruit of
someone's good idea taken up spontaneously by ef
fective volunteers in good will—that it is worth while
"trueing" up the story.
Before 1917 the then chaplain, "Dr. Charles D.
Gardner (who was known to everybody as the
"Padre") had an informal group of students in a
sort of social corps. In their free time they went up to
the city clinics lo help out with the children there. So
many of those kids had to be discharged so early
from hospitals, or had so little chance to convalesce
in their crowded city homos, that the Padre, thinking
a country summer would set them well ahead in
health and resistance, proposed a two-months sum
mer experiment on the campus. A spontaneous com
mittee responded—just the people you'd think—the
veteran ::Marine" who always landed and took a good
idea well in hand, and Mrs. Payson Treat, Mrs.
Bailey Willis, Mrs. Timothy Hopkins among them.
They dickered for the Stanford Isolation Hospital
which with Stanford's .short summer session was not
an emergency potential, paid a cook and .1 nurse,
took on a couple of just-graduated volunteer "moth
ers" and scrounged around among their friends for
garden vegetables and fruit to supplement the young
sters' build-up diet.
Fifty little convalescents, from two to twelve, '
boys and 14i 1' Is. some in casts, some pre-T.8., some
frail from illness or operations, that summer,
staying from two weeks to two months. Thcv bene
fitted mightily Only little Italian Rosie was not out of
danger. She was going blind from malnutrition,
though the rest of hci brothers and sisters thrived on
their family diet, and ran around that summer with
her little bent head in a deep sunbonnet. So one of

the volunteer "mothers" whom the baby loved, took
her home to her own family in Palo Alto. Friendly
little Rosie was a Palo Altoan for ten years, going
home summers for her "vacation" with her San
Francisco family, so she wouldn't outgrow them. She
taught her mother to speak English, of the kind Miss
Harker's School taught her. She grew into a fine
healthy youngster and is married now with childlren
of her own.
She was only one of the many Stanford helped.
Next summer the "home" was the house at the foot
of Cooksey Lane, the present Phi Sigma Kappa
House. Twenty city childlren summered there, with
a cook and one volunteer "mother" (Rosie's "moth
er," incidentally) riding herd on them. That year,
during the short summer session, Stanford volun
teers came up each evening to help give the kids
their dinners, their baths and a pleasant bedtime
hour.
In 1919 the present home set up housekeeping in
its original form and site, every year expanding
along the line of its original purpose.
You can see why we, who knew it "when," are
so proud to sec each new crop of Stanford family
take hold with spirit and intelligence and muscle
each year to keep the home a part of the Stanford
Tradition of service. And why, each year, we put
such personal hope in wishing your drives an over
the-top success.
I'd like to bespeak general campus admiration,
also, in all drives, for Cardinals who choose vigorous
and effective drive leaders, for those leaders, and their
workers. It is the least glamorous, the hardest, of
all campus jobs—though perhaps the most sell -
rewarding.
Good luck.

P.S. Incidentally, did you know that President
Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95. was the first to desig
nate May 1, nationally, as Child Health Day?
