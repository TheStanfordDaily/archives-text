# Sunday Climbs Aid Alpinists
## 
### 
Everyone has seen the pictures of
mountain climbers roped together,
but it is not generally realized that
this rope can easily become a death
trap if the climbers are not well
versed in its proper use.
The feel of the rope tied around
his waist can give the climber a
false sense of security which may
lead him to attempt a pitch which
is too difficult for his ability. When
he falls the rope must either break
or pull the rest of the party offâ€”
unless the belayer has had adequate
practice at successfully stopping a
fall.
For this reason the Stanford Al
pine Club gives instruction in the
most modern methods of belaying
to all new initiates in the sport of
rock climbing.
The club conducts practice climbs
each Sunday at which the newcom
er may learn and the old-timer may
perfect his rockclimbing technique.
This Sunday's climb will be con
ducted at Miraloma Rocks near
Twin Peaks.
All persons wishing to participate
should meet either in front of the
Ad Building or at the Ravenswood
entrance to the Village at 10:30 a.m.
Rugged clothing and tennis shoes, or
other rubber-soled shoes, should be
worn. For further information call
Taylor or Lippman at 8683, Cynthia
Cummings at 3121, or Marge Barker
at 22151.
