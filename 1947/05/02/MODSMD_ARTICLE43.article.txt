# Legal Study Urged on UN
## 
### 
Professor Charles Fairman, head
of the Department of Political Sci
ence, believes the entire range of
legal problems which may be ex
pected in a military occupation
should be studied by the United
Nations.
Speaking with a wide range of
experience with the Judge Advocate
General's Office in World War 11,
Dr. Fairman made the suggestion in
a paper he read Saturday before
the American Society of Interna
tional Law at its annual meeting
in Washington, D.C.
The Hague Convention of 1907 re
specting the laws and customs of
war on land, as it bears on the
legal position of property during
occupation, is no triumph of clarity,
he pointed out.
"But I am not urging a revision
(jf the convention. Rather I would
suggest that under the roof of the
United Nations study be given to
the entire range of legal problems
which may be expected in a military
occupation under that authority. 1
believe it is not visionary but real
istic to build at this time the foun
dations of the United Nations."
