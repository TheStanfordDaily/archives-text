# Tresidder, Anderson Discuss Problems of Student Forum
## 
### 
All obstacles in the way of estab
lishing a student-administration fo
rum have been overcome and the
first forum should be held soon, ac
cording to Martin Anderson, stu
dent body president.
"Exconi must officially approve
the forum next week." Anderson
said, "and we can make no definite
plans until that time."
After a 45-minute meeting with
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder and other
student leaders, Anderson said that
the forum would meet at the open
ing of every quarter and at any
| other time the student body presi
dent deemed it necessary.
FORUM EFFECT
Most, of the conference with Dr.
Tresidder centered around the ef
fect of the forum on the power of
the student Excom. Dr. Tresidder
was quoted as saying that "Excom
may be spreading its resources too
thin."
But Anderson explained that the
forum would not weaken the con
trol of Excom since forum meetings
would be originated by a president
who "is the voicc of Excom."
"The forum will be extremely in
formal and as small as possible,"
Anderson said. "This will make it
flexible and workable."
BASIC ISSUES
Anderson said that the forum will
be a preventative because "it won't
wait for crises to come before tack
ling a problem." In addition, the
forum will probe many underlying
and fundamental problems that in
volve students.
Paper work preliminary to Excom
approval will be completed this
week, Anderson stated.
Ann Lilienthal, president of Car
dinals, who has been instrumental
in effecting the forum, said that she
didn't want to see such a wonderful
j idea dropped or fade into insignifi-
I cance.
"This is something important."
j she said, "and it should be rccog
| nized as such."
