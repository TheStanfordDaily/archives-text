# Indian Swimmers Seek 19th Straight Victory Tomorrow
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
With their win string of 19
straight dual meet victories at slake,
Stanford's varsity swimmers arc
slated to face their toughest compe
tition of the current Pacific Coast
Conference campaign tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:30 when the mermen
from Berkeley invade the Encina
pools to continue a Big Meet tradi
tion which goes back to 1916.
The Golden Bear swimmers won
that first Big Meet 31 years ago, but
have had a hard time since, having
won only five times to 24 for Stan
ford.
BEAKS SEEK WIN
Led by such swimming and diving
stars as Stan Morkctter, Don Bean
ston, and Jack Lavery, the win
starved Golden Bear mermen will
be seeking their first Big Meet vic
tory since they upset the Indians in
1941. Morkctter is figured to give
Stanford's Bob Anderson a close
race in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events. Anderson is fa
vored to win the shorter contest de
spite the fact that he was named
fifth while Morketter placed fourth
in the recent 50-yard N.C.A.A. race
in Seattle. The 100 - yard event,
however, is a toss-up. The existing
P.C.C. marks are almost certain to
fall in both races.
TAIOLI-BEANSTON TANGLE
With Cal's Beanston tangling with
Stanford frecstyler Fred Taioli, the
usually unspectacular 220- and 440-
yard freestyle events could prove to
b? two of the closest races of the
day. Taioli, who spent most of fall
and winter quarters competing with
a group of American swimmers in
Australia, rejoined the Farm swim
ming team just in time to take a
third in the grueling 1,500 - meter
N.C.A.A. race. Fred was the only
double winner for Stanford when
the local mermen downed the
Olympic Club, 55-20, two weeks ago.
Beanston's best time in the 220-yard
race, 2:15.7, is two and a half sec
onds faster than Taioli turned in
against the Olympic Club. The Cal
swimmer holds a similar four-scc
ond advantage in the quarter-mile,
