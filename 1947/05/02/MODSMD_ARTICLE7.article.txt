# Indian Swimmers Seek 19th Straight Victory Tomorrow
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
With their win string of 19
straight dual meet victories at slake,
Stanford's varsity swimmers arc
slated to face their toughest compe
tition of the current Pacific Coast
Conference campaign tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:30 when the mermen
from Berkeley invade the Encina
pools to continue a Big Meet tradi
tion which goes back to 1916.
The Golden Bear swimmers won
that first Big Meet 31 years ago, but
have had a hard time since, having
won only five times to 24 for Stan
ford.
BEAKS SEEK WIN
Led by such swimming and diving
stars as Stan Morkctter, Don Bean
ston, and Jack Lavery, the win
starved Golden Bear mermen will
be seeking their first Big Meet vic
tory since they upset the Indians in
1941. Morkctter is figured to give
Stanford's Bob Anderson a close
race in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events. Anderson is fa
vored to win the shorter contest de
spite the fact that he was named
fifth while Morketter placed fourth
in the recent 50-yard N.C.A.A. race
in Seattle. The 100 - yard event,
however, is a toss-up. The existing
P.C.C. marks are almost certain to
fall in both races.
TAIOLI-BEANSTON TANGLE
With Cal's Beanston tangling with
Stanford frecstyler Fred Taioli, the
usually unspectacular 220- and 440-
yard freestyle events could prove to
b? two of the closest races of the
day. Taioli, who spent most of fall
and winter quarters competing with
a group of American swimmers in
Australia, rejoined the Farm swim
ming team just in time to take a
third in the grueling 1,500 - meter
N.C.A.A. race. Fred was the only
double winner for Stanford when
the local mermen downed the
Olympic Club, 55-20, two weeks ago.
Beanston's best time in the 220-yard
race, 2:15.7, is two and a half sec
onds faster than Taioli turned in
against the Olympic Club. The Cal
swimmer holds a similar four-scc
ond advantage in the quarter-mile,

action in the 50-yard freestyle race tomorrow against California in the
Encina pools.—Photo by Phil Welch.
so Fred will really liave to pour it
on to win.
It is a foregone conclusion that Cal
will take both first and second in
the diving competition. In contrast
to the weakness that Stanford has
shown in that event this year, the
Berkeleyites have in Jack Lavery
and Bill Keller the strongest diving
entries on the Coast. Lavery and
Keller took the top diving honors
in the P.C.C. championships last
year.
C OMPETITION EXPECTED
Stanford should take firsts in all
the other events, with torrid com
petition slated for second and third
positions. Don Hester, last year's
P.C.C. breaststroke champ, is ex
pected to set a new Coast record in
the 200 - yard breaststroke event.
Cal's Moe Matthews and Klaas 80l
of the Farm will battle for second in
what should be a close race.
Either of Stanford's Weeden
brothers, A 1 or Jack, could estab
lish a new P.C.C. 150-yard back
stroke mark, as the Indian team is
favored to cop eight points in that
event. Jack is the present holder of
the American 500-yard backstroke
record.
NEW RECORD HOPEFUL
The 300-yard medley relay team
of Jack Weeden, Don Hester, and
Dick Narver should begin the af
ternoon's scoring with five points
for Stanford. Em Cashin, Dick Nar
ver. Captain Rey Rule, and Bob An
derson will be gunning for a new
Coast record as well as seven big
points in the 400-yard freestyle re
lay.
Admission for the Big Meet will
be 40 cents for student body card
holders, 80 cents for adults, f»0 cents
lor high school and junior college
students, and 30 cents for children
tinder twelve.

in the recent 50-yard N.C.A.A. race
in Seattle. The 100 - yard event,
however, is a toss-up. The existing
P.C.C. marks are almost certain to
fall in both races.
TAIOLI-BEANSTON TANGLE
With Cal's Beanston tangling with
Stanford frecstyler Fred Taioli, the
usually unspectacular 220- and 440-
yard freestyle events could prove to
b? two of the closest races of the
day. Taioli, who spent most of fall
and winter quarters competing with
a group of American swimmers in
Australia, rejoined the Farm swim
ming team just in time to take a
third in the grueling 1,500 - meter
N.C.A.A. race. Fred was the only
double winner for Stanford when
the local mermen downed the
Olympic Club, 55-20, two weeks ago.
Beanston's best time in the 220-yard
race, 2:15.7, is two and a half sec
onds faster than Taioli turned in
against the Olympic Club. The Cal
swimmer holds a similar four-scc
ond advantage in the quarter-mile,

Encina pools.—Photo by Phil Welch.
so Fred will really liave to pour it
on to win.
It is a foregone conclusion that Cal
will take both first and second in
the diving competition. In contrast
to the weakness that Stanford has
shown in that event this year, the
Berkeleyites have in Jack Lavery
and Bill Keller the strongest diving
entries on the Coast. Lavery and
Keller took the top diving honors
in the P.C.C. championships last
year.
C OMPETITION EXPECTED
Stanford should take firsts in all
the other events, with torrid com
petition slated for second and third
positions. Don Hester, last year's
P.C.C. breaststroke champ, is ex
pected to set a new Coast record in
the 200 - yard breaststroke event.
Cal's Moe Matthews and Klaas 80l
of the Farm will battle for second in
what should be a close race.
Either of Stanford's Weeden
brothers, A 1 or Jack, could estab
lish a new P.C.C. 150-yard back
stroke mark, as the Indian team is
favored to cop eight points in that
event. Jack is the present holder of
the American 500-yard backstroke
record.
NEW RECORD HOPEFUL
The 300-yard medley relay team
of Jack Weeden, Don Hester, and
Dick Narver should begin the af
ternoon's scoring with five points
for Stanford. Em Cashin, Dick Nar
ver. Captain Rey Rule, and Bob An
derson will be gunning for a new
Coast record as well as seven big
points in the 400-yard freestyle re
lay.
Admission for the Big Meet will
be 40 cents for student body card
holders, 80 cents for adults, f»0 cents
lor high school and junior college
students, and 30 cents for children
tinder twelve.

Stanford's varsity swimmers arc

Conference campaign tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:30 when the mermen
from Berkeley invade the Encina

so Fred will really liave to pour it
on to win.
It is a foregone conclusion that Cal
will take both first and second in
the diving competition. In contrast
to the weakness that Stanford has
shown in that event this year, the
Berkeleyites have in Jack Lavery
and Bill Keller the strongest diving
entries on the Coast. Lavery and
Keller took the top diving honors
in the P.C.C. championships last
year.
C OMPETITION EXPECTED
Stanford should take firsts in all
the other events, with torrid com
petition slated for second and third
positions. Don Hester, last year's
P.C.C. breaststroke champ, is ex
pected to set a new Coast record in
the 200 - yard breaststroke event.
Cal's Moe Matthews and Klaas 80l
of the Farm will battle for second in
what should be a close race.
Either of Stanford's Weeden
brothers, A 1 or Jack, could estab
lish a new P.C.C. 150-yard back
stroke mark, as the Indian team is
favored to cop eight points in that
event. Jack is the present holder of
the American 500-yard backstroke
record.
NEW RECORD HOPEFUL
The 300-yard medley relay team
of Jack Weeden, Don Hester, and
Dick Narver should begin the af
ternoon's scoring with five points
for Stanford. Em Cashin, Dick Nar
ver. Captain Rey Rule, and Bob An
derson will be gunning for a new
Coast record as well as seven big
points in the 400-yard freestyle re
lay.
Admission for the Big Meet will
be 40 cents for student body card
holders, 80 cents for adults, f»0 cents
lor high school and junior college
students, and 30 cents for children
tinder twelve.
