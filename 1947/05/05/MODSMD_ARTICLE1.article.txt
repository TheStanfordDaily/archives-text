# Tresidder Tells Alumni Stanford Students Are At New Academic High
## 
### 
Stanford students have never been higher in the quality
of their academic work in the history of the University, Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder declared Saturday in an address to alumni
at the annual conference.
Dr. Tresidder stated the number of students in scholastic

difficulty during the last quarter
was proportionately just half the
number during the Winter Quarter
of 1939-40.
"The steady purpose, sincerity,
and hard work of the veterans, and
the fact that the great majority of
them at Stanford are completing
their education is a decisive answer
to critics of the G.I. Bill who fore
cast veterans would go to college
'merely for the ride' and would not
finish their education," the president
said.
"Stanford is a stimulating place,"
Dr. Tresidder said, "and never be
fore at the University has there been
a better selection of students, nor a
higher level of academic work."
CONFERENCE SPEAKERS
Dr. Graham DuShane, also speak
ing at the conference, told of the
contributions of micro-surgery on
living embryos to the field of biology.
The prediction that food prices will
soon be going down was made by
David E. Faville, professor of mar
keting in the School of Business,
who pointed out stocks of canned
goods arc half again as large as a
year ago.
Chaplain George Hall declared
what University students arc look
ing for in religion is not an organi
zation which will order and regiment
them, but an ideal which will pull
them, inspire them, thrill them,
• and give them the ability to feel a
compelling force and discipline from
within rather than an authority from
without.

The puzzle of the Japanese friend
liness towards their American con
querors was explained by Dr. Er
nest P. Hilgard head of the psy
chology department. Dr. Hilgard
stated instead of the Americans
bearing the brunt of resentment and
hostility, the Japanese people are
directing it against the Japanese
military personnel.
The U.b. government and partic
ularly the Army and Navy are pay
ing the bills for science today, and
this revolutionary trend in the
financing of science may not be in
the best interests of long-range
scientific accomplishment, was the
view expressed by Professor Paul
Kirkpatriek, head of the physics de
partment.
The electronics industry is a giant
of strength and experience but pant
ing from its wartime exertions, ac

professor of electrical engineering.
COURT. LABOR, RADIO
The coming test of the Supreme
Court lies in whether the judges,
many of whom have personal sym
pathies for labor, will be able to
maintain an objective, impartial view
in considering labor legislation, ac

of the Stanford Law School.
A plea for reason in labor rela
tions, both on the side of employers
and workers, was made by John P.
Troxell, professor of industrial re

A prediction expansion in radio
broadcasting will lead to greater
specialization in programs was made
by Clifford Weiglc, associate pro

COURT. LABOR, RADIO
The coming test of the Supreme

pathies for labor, will be able to
maintain an objective, impartial view
in considering labor legislation, ac

A plea for reason in labor rela

Stanford students have never been higher in the quality
of their academic work in the history of the University, Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder declared Saturday in an address to alumni
at the annual conference.
Dr. Tresidder stated the number of students in scholastic

difficulty during the last quarter
was proportionately just half the
number during the Winter Quarter
of 1939-40.
"The steady purpose, sincerity,
and hard work of the veterans, and
the fact that the great majority of
them at Stanford are completing
their education is a decisive answer
to critics of the G.I. Bill who fore
cast veterans would go to college
'merely for the ride' and would not
finish their education," the president
said.
"Stanford is a stimulating place,"
Dr. Tresidder said, "and never be
fore at the University has there been
a better selection of students, nor a
higher level of academic work."

• and give them the ability to feel a
compelling force and discipline from
within rather than an authority from

The U.b. government and partic
