# Dr. Almack Asks Full Regeneration Of America's Educational Practices
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
"Education should be put on the
same realistic standards that are at
the base of the rest of American
life,' said Dr. John A 1 mack, profes
sor of Education at Stanford Uni
versity.
Enlarging his recent highly pub
licized investigation of educational
methods at Sequoia High School to
include American education in its
broadest scope, Dr. Almack made an
analysis of the present conflict of
educational theories and methods in
this country.
First, he criticized college educa
tion as it is today. "College is a big
disappointment to most students,"
he said. "You come with ideals
about a serious search for truth, but
you quickly find that it isn't the
case."
EDUCATION GROWS STAGNANT
Our educational system is stag
nating because it has become stiff
and formalized, according to Dr.
Almack. The patterns of yesteryear
have taken hold and become inflex
ible. These out-of-date methods arc
retained only because they arc fa
miliar and are often the "easy way
out."
"Education must come to grips
with life . . . become sensitive to
what is going on about it. Educa
tion should have a vitality and a
freedom. It should rebel against its
current stereotype," he said.
"The principles of higher educa
tion should be built for productive
usefulness. Education means some
thing only in so far as it produces
something. That is a pragmatic the
ory and in it, I think, is the cure
for America's educational ills," he
stated.
LESS RESTRICTION
According to Dr. Almack's point
of view, the purpose of the Univer
sity should be as live as that of the
student. The student's program
should be centralized around a spe
cific goal and he shouldn't be bound

by the restrictions placed upon him
from the first grade.
"After the grammar and high
school basis of sound fundamentals
— the essentials — the individual
should be allowed freedom of choice
to aim toward his personal end. He
shouldn't be bound by the 'general'
requirements that arc tagged on
him.
"Take Stanford for an example,"
Dr. Almack said. "We should abol
ish all those lower division require
ments. They only represent a com
promise for the student's time be
tween the general and professional
departments of the University. I
don't believe wc should parcel out
the student's time.
SURVEY COURSES A WASTE
"Furthermore, wc should admit
students at an earlier age. It is a
well-known fact that the younger
people do better at college. Stu
dents shouldn't have to waste so
much time in high school social
living courses and, more important,
they shouldn't have to waste time
with broad survey courses in col
lege," Dr. Almack stated.
"We postpone our serious work
too long. The American college is
one of the few in the world that
wait until a student is about 18 be
fore admitting him.
GENERALIZING COMES LAST
"And when students get to college
they should shoot right toward their
objective without having to bother
with general courses. Students
should learn the practical «nd spe
cific fust and let the generalizations j
come later. For instance, wc should
teach applied psychology before
general psychology," Dr. Almack
said.
This- tendency of "general educa
tion" represents the greatest oppo
nent of practical education in j
America, in the opinion of Dr. Al
mack. While the progressive move
ment is dying out—only fragments
are left—the trend toward "general
culture," as led by Dr. Robert M. I

Hutchins of the University of Chi
cago, is growing stronger.
HUTCIIINS IN MEDIEVAL ERA
"This 'general' education as
taught by Hutchins is neither here
nor there," he said. "It is neither
based on fundamentals nor can it
be considered progressive. Hutchins
aims at culture for the student by
broad surveys and intense reading
of the classics. Well, that would be
fine at an age-old university. Dr.
Hutchins and his ideas belong in
the medieval era.
"How Dr. Hutchins would pro
duce a man who can create some
thing I don't know. Why, even a
writer doesn't becomc a writer by
living ofT the classics. Admittedly
they are great, but by reading them
a man doesn't become a writer. He
must learn how to write from men
who are writers and he must have
the individual and unique experi
ences which lie will write about.
He cannot have those experiences
dwelling in the classics."
PRODUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE
When asked jibout the student
who comes to college without his
mind made up about his aim. Dr.
Almack said, "I recognize the legiti
mate interest of anybody who comes
to college for anything. But the un
decided student shouldn't Uike gen
cral courses. He should sample the
great fields of productive knowledge
such as science, engineering, jour
nalism, and drama. In that way he
can make an intelligent choice in
channeling his career. Not by gen
eral survey courses will a man be
useful in life.
"The universities should realize
that. The sooner wc get away from
the generalized subject matter and
the formalized methods of teaching,
the sooner we lay aside the 'books'
and stop doing it 'according to
Hoyle,' the sooner we reaffirm our
faith in individuality and free edu
cation in the United States, the
quicker education will have found
its true place in the American cul
ure."
