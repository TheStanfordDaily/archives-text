## 
### 
A Toyon leader was "kidnapped"
Friday night by certain members
of the freshman class in another at
tempt to regain the Skull and Bones
flag.
At about 7 p.m. the Toyon man
was stopped by a car on his way to
the hall and was hauled into the car
by five freshmen, who Llindfolded
him.
After driving him around on what {
he believes was El Camino Real
for about an hour, they drove him
to one of the fraternity houses on
the Row. He was taken to the cellar
of the house and the blindfold was
removed. All the kidnappers left
but one, who questioned him about |
the hiding place of the flag. A scuf- j
fie ensued, during which a gallon
jug of ammonia was spilled.
The Toyon man said he passed
out as he was being dragged up
stairs, either because of the am
monia fumes or because of the head
lock the freshman had on him.
He said he came to in some bushes |
near the boathouse with the fresh
man guarding him. After a snort
time some more came along and took
him to a room in Encina, where he
was further questioned.
"After about 15 minutes I con
vinced them I didn't know where j
the flag was hidden and 1 got up, i
saying 'I'll be seeing you,' and walked |
out about 10:30," said the kidnap!
victim.
The skull and cross bones was
flown on Toyon between 11 and 12
p.m. after the kidnapping, he said.
The flag was made by Toyon men
and flown in protest to the election
returns last week. After being stolen
by Encina men, it was regained and
hidden in Toyon.
