### 
In an article on the Student Health |
Service at Stanford in the May 5
issue, Newsweek magazine describes
the system*here as "unique in the
United States and probably in the
world."
Illustrating how the Health Serv
ice works by relating the case of
Shaun Holman, who fell out of En
cina's third story, the article says
the case is "medically significant
because of the speed and compatence
with which it was handled." Even
more important, the magazine states, j
is the fact that Holman will not
have to pay for his medical care.
During the first year, which was
completed last week, 50,000 visits
were made to the Health Service,
Newsweek says. "Clinic doctors
even delivered a lew babies to Stan
ford co-eds." Thirty married wo
men were enrolled for winter quar
ter, it explained.
"Students, too," the article states,
"express complete satisfaction with :
i this crack medical setup."
