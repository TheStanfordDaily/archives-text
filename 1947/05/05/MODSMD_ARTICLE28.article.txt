# Cards Win Flying Meet
## 
### 
Postwar flying activities took an
other step forward yesterday when
j pilots from the Stanford Flying
| Club outscored the University of
California Flying Club 73-45 at
Concord's Buchanan Field in the
first intercollegiate air meet in the
Bay area since before the war.
More important than the score,
however, was the fact that intercol
legiate fiying competition is once
again in the sports news. Members
of the Stanford club participated as
I independents without official Uni-
I versity authorization.
CHUCK LETTS WINS
Farm scoring started off early in
the first event as Chuck Letts in an
Aeronca won the 720-degree spot
landings with an* average of 15 feet
deviation to bring home 12 points
for Stanford.
Larry Lokey and Jim Reed won
second place and seven points by
landing their Tayloreraft within an
average of 56 feet of the airstrip
spot. Cal pilots Hugh Gallagher and
i Mike Schnap nailed down thivd and
j fourth spots.
Second event honors went to
j Stanford's Pele Peterson and Cal's
Don Day as they "paper cut" tissue
i paper three times in the short time
of only 19 seconds. Other Indian
scoring in this event was Ray Els
more in third place and Letts in
fourth. Cal's Mike Schnapp snared
second place while Bill Collier tied
Letts in fourth place. This was the
j only event of the meet won by Cal,
21-18.
Stanford won the third event by
j a 14-11 score as Lokey and
Reed won the 180-degree spot land
j ing with an average of 137 feet de
i viation from the designated landing
! point, and Ray Elsmore gathered in
i two points by winning fourth place.
Cal won second and third places as
Marian Dietrich and MacCoun av
eraged 169 feet and 190 feet devia
tion.
BOMBINGS ACCURATE
The Stanford club cinched the
i meet in the fourth event — flour
! sack bombing—by tying down first,
two third-, and the fourth-place po
sitions to upset the Bear flyers 22-7.
! Bob Avery and Lokey notched first
j place and 12 points by dropping
their one - pound missiles 45 feet
within the bull's-eye.
Both Letts and Elsmore tied each
\ other for third place and four points
! each by placing their bombs within
60 feet of the target. Fourth place
and two points were won as Avery
and Bombardier Reed came within
75 feet of hitting the mark. Cal's
only scoring in this event occurred
when McCoun and Harris placed
I second with a 47Mi-foot deviation in
| their bombing.
