# French Group Plans Comedy
## 
### 
Le rideau se leve . . . the third in
a series of one-act comedies, "Ro
salie" by Max Maurey, will be pre
sented by members of the French
Conversational Group at 4:15 to
morrow afternoon in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
The drawing-room farce is typical
of contemporary French light come
dies. Members of the cast include
Vera Blinchevsky in the title role,
Jenny Topas as Madame 801,
France Gerald as Monsieur 801, and
George Wilson as narrator.
The program is in line with the
new operating plan of the group
whereby every other week is de
voted to the appreciation of French
drama, music, and art. Alternate
weeks are dedicated to the im
provement of the conversational
French of the members.
