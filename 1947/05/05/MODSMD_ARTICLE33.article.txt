# Cardinals Rally to Defeat Favored U.C.L.A. Nine, 5-4
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
It shouldn't happen to a dog—but it did, to U.C.L.A.'s visiting
Bruins here last Saturday afternoon when they took a ninth
inning one-two punch from Stanford's till-then wooden Indians
?nd saw their 4-1 "win" hammered into a 5 to 4 Farm triumph.
With two out in the last of the ninth, and with only one Stanford

man on base, the Uclans apparently
had the game tucked away in moth
balls. They even got two strikes on
Buck Brownson, but that was as
close as they were able to get to the
pot o* gold.
Pinchhitter AI Kircher, Lloyd
Merriman and Ward Walkup hit the
big blows in the ninth that knocked
the props from under the bus-bound
Bruins, whose reserves were stand
ing in front of the dugout with
traveling bags in hand when the
chain reaction was set off.
KIRCHER STRIKES BLOW
It was Kircher who struck the
first blow, a towering double into
left center which hit the bank on the
bounce. Two outs later, Merriman
left the Bruins tottering with a 370-
foot triple to the right field dirt
Lank which tied up the game, and
the next man, Walkup, brought
them crashing down with a game
winning single to right.
In between, George Sloat came
through with an important single
and Brownson worked out a walk
as the Indians desperately sniped
away at the Bruin lead.
Here's how the Indians finally did
it:
URIJINS LEAD. 4-1
After kicking away three runs
and giving the Uclans their 4-1 lead,
the Indians came to bat in the ninth
in a surly mood, which by itself
didn't seem capable of overcoming
the three-run deficit.
They had hardly settled themselves
on the dugout tench in the last of
the ninth when the determined Kir
cher banged out his double.
But pitcher Dave Stott grounded
to the third baseman and Bill Arce
popped up. Sloat came through,
though, with a bouncing single over
second and Kircher scored to make
it 4-2.
Brownson worked a 3-2 count into
a walk, whereupon the Bruins' hap
hazard catcher promptly hit cen
ter field on the fly with a useless
peg to second, and Sloat and Brown
son kept right on going to second and
third.
MERRIMAN CITS LOOSE
It. could happen, it had to happen,
it did happen. Merriman slugged
the first pitch out into right, the
game was tied up, and the winning
run was perched on third.
When the hub-bub had finally
subsided after Merriman's blast. Jim
Daniel trudged to the mound for the
Uclans to see if he could get them
out of their freshly-dug hole.
But Walkup picked on the Bruin
ace's first pitch and sent it lining
into right field to drive in the win
ning run, and that was that.
STOTT SHINES
Stott held U.C.LA. to a single
earned run, and up until the fifth
the visitors couldn't produce a sin
gle solid hit off him. He struck out
six in all, four of them coming in
the first three innings.
Except for the first inning, Stott's
mound opponent, Frericks, had the
Cardinals eating out of his hand with
an assortment of slow and semi-fast
stuff, which only served to exasper
ate the Indian hitters.
In the first, the Indians opened up
by loading the bases with two out,
but they weren't able to punch a
run home at the time.
In the fourth, the Bruins broke
the ice when Johnny Stanich singled
and scored when Doug Sale's sacri
fice was picked up by Benny Car
dinally Farm first baseman, and
1 brown past first.
HICKS SURPRISE
The Uclans got. another gift run
in the fifth after catcher Hicks sur
prised with a triple, with two out.
lie came home when Bob Peters
made a wide throw to first on Frer
icks' ground ball.
The visitors came through again
with another run in the next in

ning. Sale beat out an infield hit
and went to second two outs later
when Jack "Moose" Meyers, the
idol of the local fans, reached down
and out and ticked a hit into cen
ter.
Briganti drove Sale in with a
single, and the forbidding score read,
0-3.
GIFT FROM HICKS
The Cardinals, who by that time
were starting to get restless —and
worried—were presented with a run
in the leve nth by Hicks, who let a
pitch go through him and then ar
gued with the plate umpire all the
time Arce, who had walked, was
hotfooting it to third. Sloat followed
with a single to drive Arce in.
In the eighth, Cal Rossi hit a
clean triple, but when Brownson
dropped the relay and waited lor
Arce to pick it up—when Arce was
covering third —Rossi went home.
