# Champ Card Golfers Surprised As Bears Gain Draw in Match
## 
### 
Stanford golfers retained their
single-loss link record by tying an
upstart University of California
team on the difficult Mira Vista
Country Club course at Berkeley.
Not being able to enforce a deci
sion in the singles matches, the In
dians teamed up in the doubles and
went gunning for their underdog
rivals, but when the final putt was
sunk, a tie score was recorded in
the two-man events also. Bob Rose
crafice and Ernie Kellberg bore
th» brunt of the Card attack by
winning their singles matches.
Stanford linksmen, with the power
they have shown so far this season,
stand an excellent chance to wind
up on top of coast competition. Next
on the list of opponents are the
Bruins on May 10, followed by
Southern California on May 17, and
California again on May 24.
