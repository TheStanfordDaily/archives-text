### DAN ENDSLEY 
WESTWOOD, May 3—A major weakness in the field events
caused Stanford to drop its track meet to the U.C.L.A. Bruins
here today, 77 2 3 to 53 1/3. Out of 54 possible points on the
field, the Cards were able to garner only 12 1 3—and more than
half of that small amount came from Steve McKee's tie for first

in the discus and Bill Larson's sec
ond place in the pole vault.
The outstanding performer for
Stanford was sprinter Terry Max
well, who outran the field in both
dashes. First he nipped Sandy
Scher and A 1 Hoisch of the Bruins
in a :09.9 100, coming up from third
in the last five yards; then he won
the 220 all by himself to set a new
meet record at :21.1. There was a
slight tail wind, but it was nulli
fied by the slow Bruin track.
Three other meet records were set,
two of them by Craig Dixon of the
Uclans in the hurdles. He was an
easy winner in both events. First
he traveled the 120 highs in :14.3 to
erase the old mark of : 14.6 set by
Indians Gus Meier and Sammy
Klopstock in 1934 and 1935; then
he breezed through a flight of lows
in :23.1 to beat Bruin Tom Berke
leff's mark by two tenths of a sec
ond.
The final meet record was set
by basketballer Don Barksdale in
the broad jump by sailing out 24
feet Va inches, erasing the 23' BV2"
mark set by present Bruin assistant
track coach. Pat Turner, in 1940.

The lanky Negro had five jumps
over 23 feet.
George Grimes of the Cards staged
a thrilling stretch duel with Bruin
Ralph Gold in the 880, but lost out
by a yard after being elbowed twice
in the ribs during the mad dash for
ttfie tape. Gold admitted hitting
Grimes, but claimed he hadn't known
he was there. Stanford made no
official protest.
Grimes got some small measure
of revenge when he hooked up with
Gold in the final lap of the relay.
He had a 5-yard lead when he took
the baton and had increased it to
15 by the time he hit the tape, eased
up. He clicked off his lap in :48.7,
according to Card coach Jack Weir
s'hauser's stopwatch.
In addition to Maxwell and McKee,
there were two other Stanford win
ners—Frank Ganahl in a 4:24.9 mile
and Pitch Johnson In a :49.4 quar
ter. The two squads were very
evenly matched on the track, with
Stanford having only a 5-point mar
gin—the margin provided by the
winning relay effort—but all those
Westwood points in the field events
were too big a load for the Indian to
carry.

The final meet record was set
by basketballer Don Barksdale in
the broad jump by sailing out 24
feet Va inches, erasing the 23' BV2"
mark set by present Bruin assistant
track coach. Pat Turner, in 1940.

The lanky Negro had five jumps
over 23 feet.
George Grimes of the Cards staged
a thrilling stretch duel with Bruin
Ralph Gold in the 880, but lost out
by a yard after being elbowed twice
in the ribs during the mad dash for
ttfie tape. Gold admitted hitting
Grimes, but claimed he hadn't known
he was there. Stanford made no
official protest.
Grimes got some small measure
of revenge when he hooked up with
Gold in the final lap of the relay.
He had a 5-yard lead when he took
the baton and had increased it to
15 by the time he hit the tape, eased
up. He clicked off his lap in :48.7,
according to Card coach Jack Weir
s'hauser's stopwatch.
In addition to Maxwell and McKee,
there were two other Stanford win
ners—Frank Ganahl in a 4:24.9 mile
and Pitch Johnson In a :49.4 quar
ter. The two squads were very
evenly matched on the track, with
Stanford having only a 5-point mar
gin—the margin provided by the
winning relay effort—but all those
Westwood points in the field events
were too big a load for the Indian to
carry.
WESTWOOD, May 3—A major weakness in the field events
caused Stanford to drop its track meet to the U.C.L.A. Bruins
here today, 77 2 3 to 53 1/3. Out of 54 possible points on the
field, the Cards were able to garner only 12 1 3—and more than
half of that small amount came from Steve McKee's tie for first

in the discus and Bill Larson's sec
ond place in the pole vault.
The outstanding performer for
Stanford was sprinter Terry Max
well, who outran the field in both
dashes. First he nipped Sandy
Scher and A 1 Hoisch of the Bruins
in a :09.9 100, coming up from third
in the last five yards; then he won
the 220 all by himself to set a new
meet record at :21.1. There was a
slight tail wind, but it was nulli
fied by the slow Bruin track.
Three other meet records were set,
two of them by Craig Dixon of the
Uclans in the hurdles. He was an
easy winner in both events. First
he traveled the 120 highs in :14.3 to
erase the old mark of : 14.6 set by
Indians Gus Meier and Sammy
Klopstock in 1934 and 1935; then
he breezed through a flight of lows
in :23.1 to beat Bruin Tom Berke
leff's mark by two tenths of a sec
ond.
