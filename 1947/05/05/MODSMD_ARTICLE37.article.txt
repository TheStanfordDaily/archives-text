# Indian Netmen Lose, 5-4; Late Rally Saves Bears
## 
### AL BRIDGES 
The California Golden Bears eked
out a slim victory over Stanford's
racquet busters on the Berkeley
courts Saturday with a last-minute
5-4 victory. Many spectators had
left the stands expecting an Indian
win, hut an upset in the last doubles
match gave the edge to the Bears.
Everything was even-steven when
the curtain fell on the singles
matches. Bob Lewis had easily
bested the efforts of Cal's top-seed
ed Bob Burland in two sets, 6-3 and
6-2, when Ralph Gish evened the
count by setting back the Farm's
Ted Meyers, 6-4 and 6-1. Things
looked black for the Cards in the
next singles contest, which saw a
hard-fought three-set duel won by
Bill Beale of the Bears. With the

match score standing at 2-1, Drew
Putte came through for the home
team after a first-set loss to even up
the score over the three-set route.
After a slow start, Kirke Mecham
out-played the Bears' Phil Seymour
to put Stanford out in front, only
to have a rival, Morris Sockolov, use
three sets to defeat a tiring Fred
Lewis to even up the match score.
The favored duo of Beale and
Gish ground out a doubles victory
over their Farm opponents to tip the
see-saw in Cal's favor, but Lewis
and Mecham avenged this defeat by
soundly ti'ouncing the much-touted
Borland - Grenfell combination in
two one-sided sets. With Ross
Hughes and Drew Putte on tap, it
looked like a probable final win for
the Stanfordites. However, in a
tense, three-set battle, brothers Phil
and Bob Seymour finally tipped the
scales in California's favor, 7-5, 4-6,
7-5.
In the J.V. contest, earlier in Ihe
day, Cal also got the nod by a 6-3
match score.
