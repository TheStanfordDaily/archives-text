### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford s record smashing Varsity Swimming Team enjoyed its greatest afternoon of triumph of the current swim season
I last Saturday as it shattered thirteen records and equalled thre e more in defeating its arch-rival University of California team,
i 51-24, in the Encina Pools. Four Pacific Coast Conference, six meet, and three pool marks were officially broken, and a P.C.C.,
meet, and pool record was tied by the Stanford mermen who copped seven out of the nine first places.
F arm sprint star Bob Anderson personally accounted for si x of the new marks and contributed to the setting of three more.

Bob, who doubles in football togs
during the fall, began his successful
afternoon by equaling his own 50-
y;ird freestyle record of 23.1 sec
onds after having overcome his ini
tial nervousness which caused him
to make two false starts and nar
rowly miss making a third and dis
qualifying one. In his second race,
the 100-yard freestyle, Anderson
clipped a full half second off the old
P.C.C. mark of 52.3 while scoring
his second triple record of the day.
Bob later xcturned to team up with
Narver, Em Cashin, and Key Rule
to better the existing P.C.C., meet,
and pool records for the 400-yard
freestyle relay by over three and a
half seconds.
A tenth of a second was knocked
off the fifteen-year-old 220-yard
freestyle meet record when Em
Cashin, 1942 N.C.A.A. breaststroke
champ won that event for the Farm.
Cal's Don Beanston nosed out Stan
ford distance man Fred Taioli by six
inches to take second.

Stanford's brother act of A 1 and
Jack Weeden swam one-two in the
150-yard backstroke race. Al's time
of 1:37.00 set a new P.C.C., meet,
and pool record for lhat event.
The Pacific Coast Conic rence and j
meet records for the 200-yard breast*
stroke race fell as Dun Hester swam
home fifteen yards ahead of the pack
to add five more points to Stanford's
swelling total.
The 300-yard medley relay team
of Jack Weeden, Don Hester, and
Dick Narver began iho afternoon's
record breaking performances by
setting a new meet mark of 3:01.5
while beating Cal's team by ap- !

proximately eleven yards.
In all, it was a great afternoon for
Coaches Brandsten and Hayne's
swimmers. The Golden Bear's mo
ment of glory were few and brief.
After losing the 220-yard freestyle
event, Cal distance star Don Bean
ston won the 440-yard freestyle race
from Fred Taioli and Ralph Sala
in the meet record time of 4:54.4.
As was expected, Cal's P.C.C. div
ing champ, Jack Lavery, won the
springboard event, but Indian Diver
Louis Fentnor surprised all by tak
ing second place from Bearman Bill
Keller. Keller was unquestionably
somewhat shaken up by having nar
rowly missed hitting the board while
pulling out of a one and a half back
dive, and Fentnor turned in his best
performance to date to capitalize on
the situation. t
