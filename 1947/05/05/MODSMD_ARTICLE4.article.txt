# Leavenworth Riot Probed

### 
FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kans.,
May 4 (UP). —Peace reigned in the
United States Disciplinary Barracks
today as military authorities pressed
an investigation into the race riot
involving 727 white and Negro in
mates which ended Saturday night
after raging intermittently for 40
hours.
An undetermined number of
white prisoners and 37 Negroes
were in solitary confinement,
broken only for questioning by
Army officers, on suspicion of be
ing leading troublemakers.
Except for the investigation, it
was a normal Sunday at the 80-
year-old barracks, Maj. Henry C.
Triesler, Jr., public relations officer,
said. Brig. Gen. Harry L. Twaddle,
correctional officer of the Fifth
Army, with headquarters at Chi
cago, arrived last night and con
ferred with Col. Graeme Parks, who
had been in command of the bar
racks for only two days when the
rioting began Friday morning.
One white prisoner, Dewey D.
Osborne, 30, Mountain City, Tenn.,
was killed in the rioting, which
flared into full-scale racial warfare
before the 213 Negroes and 514
whites were herded into separate
cell blocks where they staged "hold
outs" defying authority. The Ne
groes gave up their holdout Satur
day morning. The white prisoners
capitulated last night.
Pending a formal investigation,
there was no major disciplinary ac
tion against any of the 527 men, ex
cept the confinement of those among
them suspected of possible leader
ship in the rioting because of "past
records." Parks, however, ordered
all privileges taken away.
