## Excom and Electioneering 
### 
At the last student election Stanford voters
approved the referendum to allow funds to be
spent for electioneering. Excom is now faced
with the problem of determining how to regu
late these expenses.
Donations for campaign purposes should
be given careful evaluation and election board
will have to interpret what expenses are con
sidered as fair. All expenses of the campaign
must be included, regardless of whether such
expense was incurred by the candidate or his
representatives.
As a matter of policy, Excom should also
consider just what kind of electioneering
stunts can be called valid publicity. Mater
ials used in campaigning must be of the type
which all candidates will be able to procure.
Surely campaigning of an unusual nature
of which all the candidates can not avail
themselves should be outlawed. The dif
ference between a reduction in price and
"free" publicity must be considered.
A simple report on campaign expenses and
plans could be submitted to Excom previous
to the start of the campaign.
The report should be submitted even if the
candidate incurred no expenses. Donations
for the campaign purposes should be evalu
ated and attached receipts for verification of
expense items should be included in the
report.
Other universities run their elections in
such a way that students running for office
are allowed small expense accounts for cam
paigning. Stanford's Excom can write these

universities and avail themselves of these
reports.
Whatever the method selected by Excom
to approve campaign plans and expenses it
must be one that puts a careful check on the
candidate's electioneering and subjects the
candidate to ASSU discipline for violation of
election rules. —D.K.
