### CECIL ROSPAW 
One project very vital to all of California, and
much of the Pacific Slope Area, which is up for much
discussion in our Congress today, and will probably
be passed one way or another very soon, is the
Central Valley Project.
This is the hazy title for an immense construction
program some of which has been completed at Shasta
Dam, some now in construction, and some still in the
planning stage. It is ambitious in that the planners
are attempting to make irrigation available to arid
land which would be highly productive with water,
and at the same time furnish power, and it is hoped
cheaply, to the new communities and farms which
will develop.
There are some definite problems which must
be solved connected with this project before it can
proceed to the best of its capacity.
The first is the matter of control. Because part
of the effects of the power saving could extend over
state boundaries one school of thought has. contended
that an authority should be set up under the Federal
Government similar to TV A. This is as yet im
practical.
Right now the struggle for control is being waged
between the Bureau of Reclamation under the De
partment of Interior and the US Army Engineers,
who would only do the actual work and leave ad
ministration to the state. Most authorities who have
worked under both systems agree that the Federal
Bureau should keep control, for the State is not set
up to handle the project, does not have the money
or the administrators, and is decidedly less efficient.
A second problem and one which is equally as
large, is the one of control and distribution of power.
This is a complex situation. Should the Government
compete with private companies, even if it is making
power available at half the price?
It is this problem that is behind the fight for con
trol. Under the Army Engineers the set policy is to
sell all power produced at the dams to private com
panies for re-distribution. Under the Reclamation
Bureau there is a possibility that the government
might build new lines and extend services to rural
areas.
The third problem that has caused trouble in con
nection with CVP has been the 160 acre land limi
tation. Much time and energy has been expended de
fending or vilifying this provision. As the bill
stands now it has been dropped.
The original intention of the 160 acre limitation
was not to cause the redistribution of large farms
already in existence, but rather to prevent any more
such farms from being established on the basis of
the cheap water and power made available.
There is a very interesting report in the Document
Room of the Library which bears very well on this
question. It was compiled by one Dr. Goldschmidt

of the U. of C. and was adopted by a Senate Com
mittee on small businesses headed by Senator
Murry, including Capper, Wherry, and Capehart,
not exactly followers of the C.P. line and Mead,
Taylor, and Pepper, for the sake of opposition.
An intensive survey was made of the two com
munties of Dinuba and Arvin, both small com
munities. The former has a population of 7,400, the
latter 6,200. The two towns are 100 miles apart in the
San Joaquin Valley. They were carefully chosen
because of one basic difference, Dinuba is an area of
relatively small farm properties and Arvin has large
farms.
The figures are impressive. Arvin has but 337
farms with an average of 297 acres each in its sur
rounding territory, while Dinuba has 635 farms in
about the same amount of space which average 45
acres each. Arvin has 123 people who are full, part,
or tenant owners of land while Dinuba has 722
people in the same positions. Dinuba calls for, and
makes jobs available for 1,000 extra workers, on an
average, per year.
The surrounding territory of the two communities
matches very well in comparative wealth, even though
there is some crop differentiation. Yet there is no
comparison of the two towns on the basis of small
business.
Dinuba has 62 small home-owned businesses com
pared with Arvin's 35. It does an annual turnover of
$4,383,000 compared with $2,535,000. Dinuba spends
three times as much money for household goods,
has a higher standard of living, has more and bet
ter schools, nicer parks, better facilities for meetings,
more community and civic minded groups, twice as
many churches, and two newspapers to Arvin's one.
The list is endless and is all in the favor of Dinuba.
It was for precisely this reason that the 160 acre
land limitation was instituted in the CVP. The stip
ulation stated that no water from the project dams
would be serviced to a holding in the hands of one
man larger than that number, or to a man and wife
who jointly held more than 320 acres.
The limitation was not the attempt of a few
starry-eyed liberals to stab business in the back,
but rather an honest attempt to keep business in its
proper place and scope in the American way of life.
We constantly hear of our "grass-roots" democracy in
this country, but there can be little hope for a long
continuation of small business if the small farm
gets squeezed out of the picture as it has in Arvin.
Protection of the rights of private property does not
mean allowing the overall concentration of economic
wealth in the hands of a few to the overall detriment
of the community.
If the latest CVP bill is passed by our Congress
without the 160 acre limitation at least part of that
worthy plan will be nullified.

man larger than that number, or to a man and wife
who jointly held more than 320 acres.
The limitation was not the attempt of a few
starry-eyed liberals to stab business in the back,
but rather an honest attempt to keep business in its
proper place and scope in the American way of life.
We constantly hear of our "grass-roots" democracy in
this country, but there can be little hope for a long
continuation of small business if the small farm
gets squeezed out of the picture as it has in Arvin.
Protection of the rights of private property does not
mean allowing the overall concentration of economic
wealth in the hands of a few to the overall detriment
of the community.
If the latest CVP bill is passed by our Congress
without the 160 acre limitation at least part of that
worthy plan will be nullified.
One project very vital to all of California, and
much of the Pacific Slope Area, which is up for much
discussion in our Congress today, and will probably
be passed one way or another very soon, is the
Central Valley Project.
This is the hazy title for an immense construction
program some of which has been completed at Shasta
Dam, some now in construction, and some still in the
planning stage. It is ambitious in that the planners
are attempting to make irrigation available to arid
land which would be highly productive with water,
and at the same time furnish power, and it is hoped
cheaply, to the new communities and farms which
will develop.
There are some definite problems which must
be solved connected with this project before it can
proceed to the best of its capacity.
The first is the matter of control. Because part
of the effects of the power saving could extend over
state boundaries one school of thought has. contended
that an authority should be set up under the Federal
Government similar to TV A. This is as yet im
practical.
Right now the struggle for control is being waged
between the Bureau of Reclamation under the De
partment of Interior and the US Army Engineers,
who would only do the actual work and leave ad
ministration to the state. Most authorities who have
worked under both systems agree that the Federal
Bureau should keep control, for the State is not set
up to handle the project, does not have the money
or the administrators, and is decidedly less efficient.
A second problem and one which is equally as
large, is the one of control and distribution of power.
This is a complex situation. Should the Government
compete with private companies, even if it is making
power available at half the price?
It is this problem that is behind the fight for con
trol. Under the Army Engineers the set policy is to
sell all power produced at the dams to private com
panies for re-distribution. Under the Reclamation
Bureau there is a possibility that the government
might build new lines and extend services to rural
areas.
The third problem that has caused trouble in con
nection with CVP has been the 160 acre land limi
tation. Much time and energy has been expended de
fending or vilifying this provision. As the bill
stands now it has been dropped.
The original intention of the 160 acre limitation
was not to cause the redistribution of large farms
already in existence, but rather to prevent any more
such farms from being established on the basis of
the cheap water and power made available.
There is a very interesting report in the Document
Room of the Library which bears very well on this
question. It was compiled by one Dr. Goldschmidt

of the U. of C. and was adopted by a Senate Com
mittee on small businesses headed by Senator
Murry, including Capper, Wherry, and Capehart,
not exactly followers of the C.P. line and Mead,
Taylor, and Pepper, for the sake of opposition.
An intensive survey was made of the two com
munties of Dinuba and Arvin, both small com
munities. The former has a population of 7,400, the
latter 6,200. The two towns are 100 miles apart in the
San Joaquin Valley. They were carefully chosen
because of one basic difference, Dinuba is an area of
relatively small farm properties and Arvin has large
farms.
The figures are impressive. Arvin has but 337
farms with an average of 297 acres each in its sur
rounding territory, while Dinuba has 635 farms in
about the same amount of space which average 45
acres each. Arvin has 123 people who are full, part,
or tenant owners of land while Dinuba has 722
people in the same positions. Dinuba calls for, and
makes jobs available for 1,000 extra workers, on an
average, per year.
The surrounding territory of the two communities
matches very well in comparative wealth, even though
there is some crop differentiation. Yet there is no
comparison of the two towns on the basis of small
business.
Dinuba has 62 small home-owned businesses com
pared with Arvin's 35. It does an annual turnover of
$4,383,000 compared with $2,535,000. Dinuba spends
three times as much money for household goods,
has a higher standard of living, has more and bet
ter schools, nicer parks, better facilities for meetings,
more community and civic minded groups, twice as
many churches, and two newspapers to Arvin's one.
The list is endless and is all in the favor of Dinuba.
It was for precisely this reason that the 160 acre
land limitation was instituted in the CVP. The stip

comparison of the two towns on the basis of small
business.
Dinuba has 62 small home-owned businesses com
pared with Arvin's 35. It does an annual turnover of
$4,383,000 compared with $2,535,000. Dinuba spends
three times as much money for household goods,
has a higher standard of living, has more and bet
ter schools, nicer parks, better facilities for meetings,
more community and civic minded groups, twice as
many churches, and two newspapers to Arvin's one.
The list is endless and is all in the favor of Dinuba.
It was for precisely this reason that the 160 acre
land limitation was instituted in the CVP. The stip
ulation stated that no water from the project dams
would be serviced to a holding in the hands of one
man larger than that number, or to a man and wife
who jointly held more than 320 acres.
The limitation was not the attempt of a few
starry-eyed liberals to stab business in the back,
but rather an honest attempt to keep business in its
proper place and scope in the American way of life.
We constantly hear of our "grass-roots" democracy in
this country, but there can be little hope for a long
continuation of small business if the small farm
gets squeezed out of the picture as it has in Arvin.
Protection of the rights of private property does not
mean allowing the overall concentration of economic
wealth in the hands of a few to the overall detriment
of the community.
If the latest CVP bill is passed by our Congress
without the 160 acre limitation at least part of that
worthy plan will be nullified.
One project very vital to all of California, and
much of the Pacific Slope Area, which is up for much
discussion in our Congress today, and will probably
be passed one way or another very soon, is the
Central Valley Project.
This is the hazy title for an immense construction
program some of which has been completed at Shasta
Dam, some now in construction, and some still in the
planning stage. It is ambitious in that the planners
are attempting to make irrigation available to arid
land which would be highly productive with water,
and at the same time furnish power, and it is hoped
cheaply, to the new communities and farms which
will develop.
There are some definite problems which must
be solved connected with this project before it can
proceed to the best of its capacity.
The first is the matter of control. Because part
of the effects of the power saving could extend over
state boundaries one school of thought has. contended
that an authority should be set up under the Federal
Government similar to TV A. This is as yet im
practical.
Right now the struggle for control is being waged
between the Bureau of Reclamation under the De
partment of Interior and the US Army Engineers,
who would only do the actual work and leave ad
ministration to the state. Most authorities who have
worked under both systems agree that the Federal
Bureau should keep control, for the State is not set
up to handle the project, does not have the money
or the administrators, and is decidedly less efficient.
A second problem and one which is equally as
large, is the one of control and distribution of power.
This is a complex situation. Should the Government
compete with private companies, even if it is making
power available at half the price?
It is this problem that is behind the fight for con
trol. Under the Army Engineers the set policy is to
sell all power produced at the dams to private com
panies for re-distribution. Under the Reclamation
Bureau there is a possibility that the government
might build new lines and extend services to rural
areas.
The third problem that has caused trouble in con
nection with CVP has been the 160 acre land limi
tation. Much time and energy has been expended de
fending or vilifying this provision. As the bill
stands now it has been dropped.
The original intention of the 160 acre limitation
was not to cause the redistribution of large farms
already in existence, but rather to prevent any more
such farms from being established on the basis of
the cheap water and power made available.
There is a very interesting report in the Document
Room of the Library which bears very well on this
question. It was compiled by one Dr. Goldschmidt

of the U. of C. and was adopted by a Senate Com
mittee on small businesses headed by Senator
Murry, including Capper, Wherry, and Capehart,
not exactly followers of the C.P. line and Mead,
Taylor, and Pepper, for the sake of opposition.
An intensive survey was made of the two com
munties of Dinuba and Arvin, both small com
munities. The former has a population of 7,400, the
latter 6,200. The two towns are 100 miles apart in the
San Joaquin Valley. They were carefully chosen
because of one basic difference, Dinuba is an area of
relatively small farm properties and Arvin has large
farms.
The figures are impressive. Arvin has but 337
farms with an average of 297 acres each in its sur
rounding territory, while Dinuba has 635 farms in
about the same amount of space which average 45
acres each. Arvin has 123 people who are full, part,
or tenant owners of land while Dinuba has 722
people in the same positions. Dinuba calls for, and
makes jobs available for 1,000 extra workers, on an
average, per year.
The surrounding territory of the two communities
matches very well in comparative wealth, even though
there is some crop differentiation. Yet there is no
