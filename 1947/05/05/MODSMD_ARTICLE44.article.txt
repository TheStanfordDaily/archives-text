# BULL SESSION

### TOM SELF 
Last fall quarter I was intrigued by the decals
on the windshield of a car usually parked in the
Bookstore-Union area. Stickered on the right front
window were a big Indian and two little Indians.
Ah! my detective blood told me, the big Indian stands
for the man of the family, and the two little Indians
arc for his wife and child. How clever.
Later, a month or so perhaps, I noticed an addi
tional little Indian had joined the group. Gee! That's
swell, I chuckled to myself, he's had an addition to
the family.
But another little Indian showed up on the wind
shield in a couple of weeks. Now I've taken Bio. 1
and 2 and I know that families don't add up that
fast. My curiosity was piqued, so I started a little
quiet investigation. My quandary ended when re
liable reports informed me that those little Indians
which were beginning to cover the windshield were,
how shall I phrase it—oh shucks, you know how the
old badmen used to cut a notch on their six-shooters
to indicate the number of their victims—well, those
little Indians symbolized, how shall I say it—con
quests.

This story couldn't possibly be as good in the
retelling as it was when it happened. But I'm going
to try it anyway. Wally McCall, a serious phil
osophy student, was enjoying a visit from his mother
last summer quarter. Being a good sport, he decidcd
to take her to the Top of the Mark for that wonderful
view; after all, hardly a tourist can resist it. However,
before they arrived, he went to some lengths to
inform his mom that he personally did not frequent
such places, but he was taking her because she'd
enjoy it.
That was his mistake. He probably overdid it.
What he didn't know was that a friend of his. Dud
Cowan, was the genial captain on Saturday nights at
the Top. Dud spotted Wally the instant he stepped
from the elevator, gave him the big hello, told him
how glad he was to see him—again, and personally
escorted him to a choice table. After a few minutes
silence, Wally's mother looked at him and remarked,
with just a touch of sarcasm, "Just a stranger here,
aren't you, son."
