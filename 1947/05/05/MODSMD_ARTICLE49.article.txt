# Premiere Set For 'No Exit'
## 
### 
In its initial amateur and West
Coast performance, Jean - Paul
Satre's existentialistic drama "No
Exit" will be presented Saturday
night at 8:15 in the Little Theater
by the Stanford Experimental The
ater, according to George E. Nich
ols 111, director.
Cast includes Kenneth Jones, re
cently of Northwestern; Elaine
Maltzmann, who has acted in a
number of Studio Theater produc
tions; and Fellowship students Bea
trice Manley and Bill Vorenberg,
who will depict characters who have
died and are in hell.
This performance is the first ex
tra production of the Stanford Ex
perimental Theater, said Nichols,
and will start a series of plays of
an "experimental nature."
"No Exit" was selected, he ex
plained, "because it was felt it is an
important representative of the
avant-garde in contemporary the
ater. Although it was not success
ful on Broadway, it is felt it de
serves production in the University
theater, since it is a product of a
new post-war philosophy founded
in France."
Jean-Paul Satre is the leader of
the school of existentialism in dra
ma, which deals with the individual,
his inner nature, and his fate. "It
is a play of idea â€”an intellectual
melodrama," Nichols said.
