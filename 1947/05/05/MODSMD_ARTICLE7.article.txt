PARIS, May 4 (UP). — Premier
Paul Ramadier's cabinet tonight or
dered its five Communist ministers
ousted from the government, after
186 Communist deputies in the
National Assembly voted solidly
against Ramadier's wage and price
freezing program on a motion of
confidence.
The decision to carry on the gov
ernment without the Communists,
who represent the largest single
party in the Assembly, was reached
during a dramatic 60-minute cabi
net meeting at the end of a full
day of conferences.
CONFIDENCE VOTE
Those dropped from Ramadier's
coalition cabinet are Vice-Premier
Maurice Thorez, National Defense
Minister Francis Billoux, Labor
Minister Ambroise Croizat, Recon
struction Minister Charles Tillon
and Health Minister Georges Mar
ran e.
All five voted against Ramadier
along with all other Communist
members of the National Assembly
when the vote of confidence was
taken this morning.
Although Ramadier won the vote,
•560 to 186, the no-confidence Com
munist ballot forced him into a po
sition where he either had to accede
to Communist demands for wage
increases or try to create u govern
ment without them.
WAGE INCREASES
Ramadier has insisted that wage
increases such as demanded by 32,-
000 striking workers in the nation
alized Renault automobile plans—
who arc supported by the Commu
ists — would increase prices and
p'ungc France into disastrous infla
tion.
Political observers, on the other
hand, have predicted that any at
tempt to govern without the Com
munists would take France into
chaos and revolution. They believed
that opposition Communists through
their control of labor unions could
paralyze France with labor strife
which might bring the intervention
of armed De Gaullist followers.
An announcement of the cabinet's
decision said three of the Commu
nist portfolios had been given "tem
porarily" to other members of Ra
madier's cabinet, indicating that
some new agreement might be
worked out soon.
