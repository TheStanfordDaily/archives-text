The Pavilion floor was consider
ably scratched in spots and a few
nails were pounded in. A few nails
were also left lying around so that
people stepped on them and scuffed

places, Mr. Brandin continued, and
so far repair work payment has not
come out of dance expenses.
Mr. Brandin did not know what
