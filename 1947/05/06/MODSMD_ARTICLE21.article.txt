### 
Three large cartons of toys were
collccted yesterday from women's
residences and will be distributed to
the Convalescent Home children to
day. according to Carolyn Reeder,
chairman of the Convalescent Home
Toy Drive.
The drive, which ended last Wed
nesday, was conducted in connec
tion with Convalescent Home week
in order to obtain toys, games and
stufTed animals for the bedridden
patients of the Home.
"The drive was not as successful
as we had expected, nor did they
collect as many toys as in previous
years," said Miss Reed. She attrib
uted this to the lack of publicity in
the women's residences early last
week.
