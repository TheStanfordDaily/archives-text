"No sir, none of these assembly-line methods for me. When I wash a car I likes to give it my
own personal touch."
Sam Morris, congenial colored car-washer at the campus gas station, grinned from ear to ear
and expressed his professional opinion on the noble art of fender bathing.
"The way I sees it,"he explained, "every car wants to be cleaned in it's own special way."

This year is Sam's 17th anni
versary as a chassis-sponger. He
averred smilingly lhat he really
enjoyed his work, but he hastened
to add thut Stanford cars do get
"powerful dusty." "The way these
autes gets so dirty," he continued,
"you'd think the hoys and girls
around here spent most of their time
parked on dirt roads. Now I won
der why they'd want to do that?"
lie chuckled deeply at the inference.

swell bunch keeps coming in year
