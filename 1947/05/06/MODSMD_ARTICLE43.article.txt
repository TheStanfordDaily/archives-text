The ancient practice of "elbow
ing" in heated track competition has •
always been frowned on in Ameri
can cinder tradition. It doesn't fit
into the American scheme of fair
play and sportsmanship.
There have been many cases of
runners from foreign countries,
whose athletic code stresses win
ning rather than sportsmanship, in
tentionally hindering an opponent.
The much - talked -of mile in the
1932 Olympics, in which the Finnish
distance star reached the tape ahead ,
of his American opponent by using t
his elbow, is the prime example. :
But in American competition, such
examples are rare.
The frowned-on elbow was much
in evidence at the finish of the 880-
yard duel between Stanford's great
half - miler George Grimes and
UCLA's Ralph Gold, in the Indian-
Bruin track meet Saturday at West
wood .
Gold and Grimes were grinding to J
the tape stride for stride when Gold ;
elbowed Grimes once and, a few
strides later, elbowed him again, j
After the race the Bruin half-miler |
admitted hurting Grimes, but said, |
"I did not know anybody was
there."
In all fairness to Mr. Gold it must
be said that in the grueling 880 ;
competition it. is possible that he i
actually "did not know Grimes was
there." The 880 is a hard, long
grind and the runners' minds are
on nothing else but breaking the
tape.
But it seems that after the first
elbowing it would have become ob
vious that something was there!
Grimes entered an unofficial com
plaint to the judges, but no action
was taken. It seems that there was
a lack of competent AAU officials
at the meet. They were all over at i
the Coliseum working the more |
publicized SC-Illinois titanic. The j
outcome of the race did not affect j
the final score of the meet, so In- |
dian mentor Jack Weiershauser en- |
tered no official protest.

The Moulder has done it again.
Dean Cromwell's poor USC track
team, that didn't have a chance
against mighty Illinois, chased the
Mid westerners out of the Coliseum
Saturday and left no doubt that El
Trojan is the top cinder aggregation
in the nation, and probably the
greatest in the long line of great
track teams Cromwell has produced
down Figueroa way.
Mel Patton proved once and for
all that he is no flash in the pan.
All the sports skeptics have hopped
on the speedy Trojan's bandwagon.
The 20.4 220 that left Herb Mc-
Kenley in the dust was the clincher.

Franklin "Pitch" Johnson, son of
the former Stanford track coach,
celebrated his 19th birthday on the
Noon Daylight last Friday en route
to the Stanford-UCLA festivities in
Los Angeles. The Indian trackmen
presented the prematurely grey
haired lad with a biscuit, decorated
by three lighted matches. "Pitch"
returned the favor by winning the
quarter-mile in against the
13 ruins.

Now that Pavilion is still the same
under-sized fire-trap that it was
during basketball season. The ques
tion of a new Pavilion seems to
have faded with the basketball sea
son. But there will be many more
basketball seasons, and many more
thousands of fans jamming into the
place. Something should be one,
and it should be done now. We need
a new Pavilion, and it is up to the
Students find the student leaders to
see that we get one.
