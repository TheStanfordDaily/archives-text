# No Hit, Field, Pitch But Seals Stay Close
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 5 (UP). —Carl Zamlock, one-time
Pacific Coast League manager, is considered one of the finest
amateur magicians in the country.
But it is doubtful that he ever was able to perform the tricks
that Manager Lefty O'Doul currently is employing to keep the

.injury-riddled San Francisco Seals
right up in the Pacific Coast League
pennant chase.
O'Doul admittedly is a master
| strategian, but this year he has
added something new in the way of
managerial habits that is befud
dling the opposition.
He hasn't got a regular on the
club who is hitting well enough to be
among the first 25 batters in the
league. His infield is like a sieve
and the pitching has been only so
so.
But there the Seals are—up bat
tling for the leadership with the
power-laden Los Angeles Angels.
Tomorrow they tackle another
tough club, the San Diego Padres
in Border Town, while the Angels
j play host to their cross-town rivals,
the Hollywood Stars. Sacramento
invades Portland and Seattle visits
Oakland.
Last week, O'Doul was little short
of miraculous in winning six out of
seven from Portland. He had man
ager Jim Turner's infielders jump
happy by pulling such stunts as
three successive successful bunts.
He was getting big league per
formances from such oldsters as
Bernie Uhalt and Hugh Luby, a
couple of old-timers well past their
prime.
The Seals meet one of their tough
est opponents this season in the
hard-hitting Padres. Manager Rip
Collins has a flock of sluggers in the
, fold, including big Max West and
I Swede Jensen in the outfield; and
catcher Frank Kerr. All three are
j batting .371 or better.
The ancient qross-town rivalry
between the Angels and Stars is al
ways a toss-up—but manager Bill
Kelly has more latent power stored
up than any club in the circuit and
the Seraphs now are rated far and
away the finest team in the league.
