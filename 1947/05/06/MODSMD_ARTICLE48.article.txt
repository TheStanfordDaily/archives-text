NEW YORK, May 5 (UP).â€”Major
league ball players got their "work
outs" in hotel lobbies again today
as the complete slate of day games
was washed out by rain, making a
total of 52 postponements for the
season thus far.
That almost unprecedented num
ber of washouts posed a big problem
for most managers who are shy on
pitching strength and will face a
heavy slate of double headers later
in the campaign.
The situation was worst in Brook
lyn where the Dodgers went through
their fourth straight day of enforced
idleness, enduring rain which wiped
out a complete series of games with
both the Cincinnati Reds and the
Pittsburgh Pirates. The Giants also
had two series wiped out, their two
game set with the Pirates and a Sun
day double header with the Chicago
Cubs being postponed. They had an
open date today.
Of the 52 games which have been
postponed, 28 were in the National
League where 56 have been played,
while 24 were in the American
where the total number played to
date is 59 including two ties.
In the National, there have been
six postponements each at Brook
lyn, Philadelphia, and Boston, while
New York has had five washouts,
St. Louis three, and Pittsburgh and
Chicago one. Cincinnati is the only
team in either league without a
home game rained out to date.
In the American, there have been
five postponements each at Cleve
land and Chicago, four at Detroit,
three at St. Louis, two each at Wash
ington, New York, and Boston and
one at Philadelphia.
Last year the early spring weather
was nearly ideal and there were
only a few scattered postponements,
although later in the season there
were some rainy spells which piled
up the double headers in August and
September.
