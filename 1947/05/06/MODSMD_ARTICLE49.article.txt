# Thindclads Prep For Olympic Club, LAAC Meet
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
Stanford's varsity scantyclads, vic
tims of their fourth straight dual
meet setback —a 77 2/3 to 53 1/3
whipping at the hands of the UCLA
Bruins last weekend, will return to
the familiar confines of the Angell
Field oval for Saturday's scheduled |
triangular encounter with the Los
Angeles A.C. Mercury men and the
Siin Francisco Olympic Clubbers.
Former Indian mentor Dink Tem
pleton's Friscans, by virtue of their
previous 74-57 decision over Stanford
this season, will be favored to notch
top laurels, although considerable
opposition is expected from the
Southern entry.
SOUTHERNERS LOADED
The Mercurites are reportedly
strong in the quartermile, with Roy j
Cochran, former Indiana flash and
John Wachtler, ex-Trojan, leading
the parade. Both men have been
clocked under 48 sees, this year.
Steve" Seymour accredited with a
212 ft. javelin toss, '"Moose" Thomp
son in the shot arid discus, and Tex
Winter, a 14 ft. vaulter, are ex
pected to provide points for the
Angelenos.
Stanford coach. Jack Weiershauser,
may juggle the Indian lineup consid
erably in prepping for the all-im
portant West Coast Relays at Fresno
less than two weeks off. Terry Max
well, outstanding Indian performer
at Westwood with 9.9 and 21.1
marks for the century and furlong,
may take a flyer at ihe quarter
mile.
GRIMES COMES CLOSE
George Grimes, hard luck Stan
ford middle distance man, who has
breathed exceedingly heavy on the
neck of every winning half miler
faced this year but hasn't quite been
able to get up to ihe victor's stand,
will have it out again with the
Olympic Club's Bob Lehman, pro
viding of course Weiershauser has
him run this event.
The strong finishing Lehman just
did catch Grimes in the stretch for
the nod in their previous meeting.
Bruin Ralph Gold was the latest to
turn the trick on Grimes, elbowing
his way to a close one stride de
cision.
USC DRUBS ILLINI
USC's 73-49 victory over Illinois
before the largest crowd ever to see
a dual meet, some 30.000, is still the
talk among track fans the nation
over. "Meteor" Mel Patton, proved
once and for all that he's no flash
in the pan by handing Herb McKen
ley the worst defeat of his brilliant
career in tallying a 5 yd. win in 20.4
sees., one tenth of a second off the
world's standard.
However, Troy's Hubie Kerns
forced McKenley to zip the first 220
of his winning 47.2 quartermile in
the fast time of 21.4, there being
little doubt that this had quite iyj,.
adverse effect in the Jamaican's per-* 1
formance in the later furlong race.

GRIMES COMES CLOSE
George Grimes, hard luck Stan
ford middle distance man, who has
breathed exceedingly heavy on the
neck of every winning half miler
faced this year but hasn't quite been
able to get up to ihe victor's stand,
will have it out again with the
Olympic Club's Bob Lehman, pro
viding of course Weiershauser has
him run this event.
The strong finishing Lehman just
did catch Grimes in the stretch for
the nod in their previous meeting.
Bruin Ralph Gold was the latest to
turn the trick on Grimes, elbowing
his way to a close one stride de
cision.
USC DRUBS ILLINI
USC's 73-49 victory over Illinois
before the largest crowd ever to see
a dual meet, some 30.000, is still the
talk among track fans the nation
over. "Meteor" Mel Patton, proved
once and for all that he's no flash
in the pan by handing Herb McKen
ley the worst defeat of his brilliant
career in tallying a 5 yd. win in 20.4
sees., one tenth of a second off the
world's standard.
However, Troy's Hubie Kerns
forced McKenley to zip the first 220
of his winning 47.2 quartermile in
the fast time of 21.4, there being
little doubt that this had quite iyj,.
adverse effect in the Jamaican's per-* 1
formance in the later furlong race.
Stanford's varsity scantyclads, vic
tims of their fourth straight dual
meet setback —a 77 2/3 to 53 1/3
whipping at the hands of the UCLA
Bruins last weekend, will return to
the familiar confines of the Angell
Field oval for Saturday's scheduled |
triangular encounter with the Los
Angeles A.C. Mercury men and the
Siin Francisco Olympic Clubbers.
Former Indian mentor Dink Tem
pleton's Friscans, by virtue of their
previous 74-57 decision over Stanford
this season, will be favored to notch
top laurels, although considerable
opposition is expected from the
Southern entry.
SOUTHERNERS LOADED
The Mercurites are reportedly
strong in the quartermile, with Roy j
Cochran, former Indiana flash and
John Wachtler, ex-Trojan, leading
the parade. Both men have been
clocked under 48 sees, this year.
Steve" Seymour accredited with a
212 ft. javelin toss, '"Moose" Thomp
son in the shot arid discus, and Tex
Winter, a 14 ft. vaulter, are ex
pected to provide points for the
Angelenos.
Stanford coach. Jack Weiershauser,
may juggle the Indian lineup consid
erably in prepping for the all-im
portant West Coast Relays at Fresno
less than two weeks off. Terry Max
well, outstanding Indian performer
at Westwood with 9.9 and 21.1
marks for the century and furlong,
may take a flyer at ihe quarter
mile.
