SAN FRANCISCO. May 5 (UP).â€”
Clarcnce (Pants) Rowland, president
of the Pacific Coast Baseball League,
today said that he had "the fullest
confidence in the integrity" of PCL
baseball players and that "fix"'
charges indicated by sports editor
Bad Spencer of the San Francisco
News had ''not altered my opinion."
Rowland met here today with
Spencer and executives of the News,
seeking additional information on a
report written by Spencer that a
"Pacific Coast League game had been
thrown."
Spencer said after the meeting
that it was just an "affable conver
sation at which I promised to help
an investigation in any way I could."
Rowland at first gave the United
Press a terse "no comment," but
later said
"We have had the fullest confi
dence in the integrity of our base
ball players and still have. What
Mr. Spencer told lis in no way
altered our opinions."
