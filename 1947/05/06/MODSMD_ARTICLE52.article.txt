# Schwartz Grids Stress Defense
## 
### 
With only two more weeks of
spring loot hall practice to go.
Coach Marchie Schwartz is stress
ing defense for the Indian gridders
this week.
The squad worked on new plays
and pass defense yesterday, while
the line* reviewed defensive man
euvers for five and six man lines.
There was no scrimmage.
But the team might well enjoy
its comparative ease because
scrimmages are the order of the
day on both Thursday and Friday
this week.
Coach Schwartz singled out Whit
Budge, a San Mateo product, for
his outstanding work at left tackle
in last Friday's tough scrimmage.
