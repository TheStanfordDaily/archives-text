Sponsor Choosing Committee will meet for
' interviews today from 3 to 5 p.m. Junior and
senior women who were interested in becom
ing next year's Roble sponsors were asked to
file an application blank in the A.S.S.U. office
last week. But since 23 sponsors are needed
and only 24 applications were filed, the com
mittee will interview all interested women to
day, whether or not they filed an application.
The committee is especially interested in
having more seniors-to-be come for interviews
as few of them filed applications as compared
to the juniors-to-be. As the Roble sponsor
system is set up, it is desirable to have one
junior and one senior sponsor in each corridor.
Sponsoring is one of the greatest services
a girl can give to Stanford. It is also one of
the greatest honors a girl can receive, as a
sponsor must be a girl with a good academic
and activities record and one who will give
up her time to help the freshmen become in
terested in Stanford student activities.
It is obvious from the lack of participation
in activities this year by all but a few students,
that if student government and activities are to
get the support and interest they deserve,
more of the students must take an active part
in them. It is the new freshman class that can
be drawn into activities as they have not been

subjected to the apathy which has grown on
students this year.
Furthermore sponsors can help new girls
plan their academic programs and steer them
into courses that will fit their interests. A
sponsor can also help a freshman plan her
studying schedule so she will not go minus
as so many do their first year.
Because of her influence upon the actions
and ideas of new Stanford women, a girl who
is chosen is necessarily of high caliber.—N.B.
