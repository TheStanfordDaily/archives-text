# War Memorial Decision
## 
### 
After much deliberating over a suitable
war memorial for Stanford, the War Memorial
Committee finally reached a decision several
weeks ago. The Committee's recommenda
tions, unannounced as yet, will be taken up
by the Board of Trustees at its next meeting
May 15.
There has been a great deal of student and
alumni interest on this question all year—
should it be a student union, a new pavilion,
an international house, exchange scholarships,
or something entirely different? These are
some of the questions that have been asked
around campus.
In view of this interest, we feel that a de
cision from the Board of Trustees should be
announced shortly after its meeting.—N.B.
