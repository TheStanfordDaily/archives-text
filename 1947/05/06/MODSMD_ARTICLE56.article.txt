### TOM SELF 
You kids who go whizzing down highway 17 to
Santa Cruz are missing a good bet if you don't take
a side trip to Holy City some time. It's a better
show than the Mystery Spot or the Winchester Crazy
House, and there is no admission charge.
You will see road signs pointing the way about
half way up the grade from Los Gatos. Also to the
left of the highway you'll probably see the large
Holy City sign on top of the water tower.
Holy City is, in its own words, "Headquarters for
the world's perfect government." Pcrfcct govern
ment in this case is a particular type of race hatred.
Whereas Hitler's race hatred project was anti-sem
itism, Holy City's is anti-color.
One of the city's signs explains part of its plan:
a Jew and Gentile are pictured clasping hands over
the world, with the caption, "The world, Mr. Jew
and Mr. Gentile, to rule and to own."
Propaganda frdm the headquarters of the world's
perfect government suggest that the colored people
in the United States be sent back from whence they
came; that is, the Negroes to Africa, the Chinese to
China, etc. Nothing is said about the Red Men who
were the original proprietors of this continent. And
no mention is made of sending the Irish back to'ire
land, or the Swedes to Sweden.
Signs in the city will tell you that "mixing the
races not only causes half breeds, but infantile paral
ysis as well, as has been shown."
Against a stone wall are a number of equally
funny signs. In the walls are several doors. One of

them is called the "Economics Solution Door." Let
tering on it reads, "Was opened in 1937 and will be
closed in 1945." On the "Wisdom Spiritual Door" it
says, "This door was opened in the year of 1910, was
closed in 1917 when a crescent appeared in the moon,
never to be opened again."
In a modest tone Holy City admits, "We neither
preach nor pray as do hoodwinking preachers and
misleading politicians. This is what we do: we explain
all mysteries; we solve all problems. We challenge
anyone to disprove either our statements, principles
or solutions."
At the entrance to the "Holy City School and Col
lege," a one-room building, is a plaque, reading: "A
million dollars worth of brand new mysterious in
formation where every mystery of God and the devil,
life and death, in fact everything you want to find
out is revealed inside. Only honest and free minded
adults are eligible. This is no kindergarten. Admis
sion 50 cents."
Father Riker, leader of the cult, is proclaimed
as "the king of all wise men who gives to the world
a new and perfect form of government."
The world, though, evidently is not yet ready
to accept his "government." In the last state elec
tions Father Riker campaigned for the governorship.
He bought considerable radio time and raised quite
a fuss. But he was not only defeated for office, he
didn't even carry his own baliwick, Holy City. There
Earl Warren outpolled him two to one.

Propaganda frdm the headquarters of the world's
perfect government suggest that the colored people
in the United States be sent back from whence they
came; that is, the Negroes to Africa, the Chinese to
China, etc. Nothing is said about the Red Men who
were the original proprietors of this continent. And
no mention is made of sending the Irish back to'ire
land, or the Swedes to Sweden.
Signs in the city will tell you that "mixing the
races not only causes half breeds, but infantile paral
ysis as well, as has been shown."
Against a stone wall are a number of equally
funny signs. In the walls are several doors. One of

them is called the "Economics Solution Door." Let
tering on it reads, "Was opened in 1937 and will be
closed in 1945." On the "Wisdom Spiritual Door" it
says, "This door was opened in the year of 1910, was
closed in 1917 when a crescent appeared in the moon,
never to be opened again."
In a modest tone Holy City admits, "We neither
preach nor pray as do hoodwinking preachers and
misleading politicians. This is what we do: we explain
all mysteries; we solve all problems. We challenge
anyone to disprove either our statements, principles
or solutions."
At the entrance to the "Holy City School and Col
lege," a one-room building, is a plaque, reading: "A
million dollars worth of brand new mysterious in
formation where every mystery of God and the devil,
life and death, in fact everything you want to find
out is revealed inside. Only honest and free minded
adults are eligible. This is no kindergarten. Admis
sion 50 cents."
Father Riker, leader of the cult, is proclaimed
as "the king of all wise men who gives to the world
a new and perfect form of government."
The world, though, evidently is not yet ready
to accept his "government." In the last state elec
tions Father Riker campaigned for the governorship.
He bought considerable radio time and raised quite
a fuss. But he was not only defeated for office, he
didn't even carry his own baliwick, Holy City. There
Earl Warren outpolled him two to one.
You kids who go whizzing down highway 17 to
Santa Cruz are missing a good bet if you don't take
a side trip to Holy City some time. It's a better
show than the Mystery Spot or the Winchester Crazy
House, and there is no admission charge.
You will see road signs pointing the way about
half way up the grade from Los Gatos. Also to the
left of the highway you'll probably see the large
Holy City sign on top of the water tower.
Holy City is, in its own words, "Headquarters for
the world's perfect government." Pcrfcct govern
ment in this case is a particular type of race hatred.
Whereas Hitler's race hatred project was anti-sem
itism, Holy City's is anti-color.
One of the city's signs explains part of its plan:
a Jew and Gentile are pictured clasping hands over
the world, with the caption, "The world, Mr. Jew
and Mr. Gentile, to rule and to own."
