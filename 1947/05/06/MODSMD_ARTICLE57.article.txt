I have before me an article from the June '47 issue
of "Salute," a magazine staffed by former workers
on "Yank." As far as the magazine generally goes,
as long as they publish Tom Flannery's cartoons, I
like it. But that is by the way. This article is en
titled "The Trouble With College." Naturally, a big
chunk of the article is concerned with the question of
increased subsistence pay, a subject that has been
amply, I would say, discussed here and in Campus
Opinion. There are other aspects, though.
Omitting the subsistence-pay question, the big
gest of tin; gripes is housing. Naturally, it's tied up
with subsistence, but bluntly, colleges in general
and the towns or cities around them just don't have
the housing facilities to accommodate today's student
bodies. If Stanford students think that they're
crowded, they should share a double bed with three
others, and pay $25 a month for the privilege, as
does one veteran student at Humboldt State, here in
our own California. O'r inhabit a basement with
eight others, at $10 a month, each. Horror stories?
Maybe, but there's lots of them. Along with housing
of individuals goes housing of classes, administration,
and faculty. The Chicago Branch of the University
of Illinois is located on Navy Pier, running 3,1500 feet
out into Lake Michigan. An official at UCLA de
scribed the over-all situation there as "too little
and too late."
In discussing the housing situation, a history pro
fessor at Chicago said with unacademic force, "We
can't build because of a bunch of dim-witted peasant
speculators are in charge of construction. The Con
gress is the most dim-witted since the time of Bu
chanan." (He is a professor of American history.)
Another serious grievance is that of discrimina
tion under the quota system. To quote the same
Chicago faculty member again, "You know about
those despicable quotas, in which some yellow ad

ministrator decides that he can butter up his Nean
derthal trustees by cutting down on Jews, Catholics,
or Negroes." Speaking in favor of newly-founded
Roosevelt College in Chicago, he emphasized that
there were no quotas there with, "They don't even
care about the grandfathers of their faculty mem
bers." Also I can mention the case of the Boston
University student who was refused at three schools
because of a Jewish-sounding name.
These are not all the gripes and problems beset
ting American higher education today. There is, I
say again, the problem of how to live on $65 a month.
There is the long-time argument over vocational as
opposed to liberal education. There are the unpleas
ant situations that have developed in some schools
between veterans and non-veterans. For a good sur
vey, take a look at the June "Salute."
The first conclusion to be drawn is that we at
Stanford are among the more fortunate of university
students. Our housing problem, thanks to the Vil
lage, is among the least pressing in the nation. The
only emergency housing on campus are those build
ings behind the Libe, and they, appropriately, are
destined for the use of the Veterans' Administra
tion. To be sure, and sorry I am to say it, as regards
discrimination, Stanford's skirts are not unstained.
The second conclusion is this: perhaps some of
the energy, enthusiasm and material contributions
going to foreign relief might be directed to improving
the lot of the veteran student in Amdrica. That was
intended as a mild dig at our campus internationalists,
but on re-reading, maybe it's an idea.
Oh. yes. About that subsistence business. I have
the questionable honor of being one of the 16,000
or whatever it is who have not received my check
this month. The VA must have read my column op
posing increased subsistence and figured that I wovdd
be glad to do without. Hmm!
