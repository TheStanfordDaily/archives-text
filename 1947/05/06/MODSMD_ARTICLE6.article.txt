### 
MOSCOW, May 5 (UP). â€”Izvestia,
the government newspaper organ,
accused Secretary of State George
C. Marshall today of deliberately
distorting and suppressing facts in
an attempt to blame Russia for the
failure of the Moscow Big Four
Foreign Ministers' Conference.
In the first Russian comment on
Gen oral Marshall's report to the
American people on the conference,
made in a radio speech a week ago
today, Izvestia said that he:
1. "Presented the Soviet position
in a false light, distorting the mean
ing of Soviet proposals."
2. "Contradicted facts" by say
ing that Russia would not co-opcr
ate in the conference.
3. ''Deliberately suppressed" facts
concerning the position of Fiance
on German economic unity and in
ternationalization of the Ruhr.
4. "Showed contempt for reality"
in saying that Russia did not want
a four-power treaty to enforce Ger
man disarmament.
5. "Distorted very rudely" For
eign Minister Viacheslav Molotov's
proposals regarding the future cen
tral German government.
6. Made "a number of distortions"
regarding Russia's position on the
treaty to restore Austrian sover
eignty.
7. Presented the Polish - German
border problem "in a very free
stylo" against Poland's interests.
"It is evident that this statement
was planned to evoke in wide cir
cles of the American people discon
tent over the policy of the Soviet
Union," Izvestia said.
Izvestia took the line that it was
the United States, not Russia, which
was really to blame for the failure
of the Moscow confercncc to agree
on basic German problems or to
complete the Austrian treaty.
