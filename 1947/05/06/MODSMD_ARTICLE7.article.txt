### 
SACRAMENTO, May 5 (UP).â€”
j Governor Warren predicted tonight
in a radio address that if Congress
| does not increase its proposed $(>,-
! 900,000 appropriation for the Cen
j tral Valley project this year, the
j project won't be completed for an
| oth?r 20 years.
Warren is leaving Sacramento to
| morrow night for a conference of
, Western Governors in Seattle on
i reclamation problems, and from
there he will fly back to Washing
i ton. D.C., to attempt to get the ap
propriation increased.
President Truman asked for a
$20,000,000 appropriation earlier this
year, and at that time Warron went
back seeking to have it upped to
$40,000,000. But the House of Rep
resentatives slashed it to the $6,-
900.000 figure.
Warren said approval of the
| House recommendations, now be
fore the Senate, would "force an
i immediate slowdown in almost ev-
I ery great water development proj
ect which th" federal government
| now has under way."
The Governor repeated his confi
j dence that the State Legislature
i will develop a highway program
during the present special session.
Warren stated the oil companies,
j however, "are still fighting and still
issuing misleading statements, but
as time goes on more and more leg
i islators are seeing through their ar-
I guments."
