# Dean Dodds Favors Liberal Theory Of Education in American Colleges
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
(This is the second in a series
of articles examining various ed
ucational theories held by Stan
ford professors. Tomorrow, Dr.
Paul Manna.)
Encouraged by the continued ac
tivity of educators in strengthening
the American educational system,
Dr. John Dodds, Dean of the School
of Humanities, has expressed strong
hope for liberal higher education in
this country.
A firm believer in what has been
called "general" education, Dr.
Dodds advocates restriction of stu
dent programs and lower division
requirements. Survey courses have
his qualified support.
"Of course I'll be written oft as a
starry-eyed humanist.," Dr. Dodds
said. "But leading men in every
profession and heads of professional
schools will reaffirm the worth of a
liberal education.
"People only call it 'general' ed
ucation when they want to take pot
shots at it,"he "Well, the
'general' education we give here at
Stanford deals with some rather
concrete subjects."
NO FREE PROGRAMS
Dr. Dodds said that students
should not be allowed complete
freedom of choice in planning their
programs as some quarters have ad
vocated.
"Students today could paraphrase
Wordsworth's old phrase, 'Me this
unchartered freedom tires,' to read
'Mc this cafeteria system of educa

tion tires'," he said.
"Professors OUGHT to be able to
plan a coherent program for stu
dents which will permit freedom of
choice but will insure that the stu
dent is exposed to the major areas
of knowledge. He can only be
called an educated man after he
has acquired that liberal back
ground," Dodds said.
Dr. Dodds pointed out that this
"liberal background" was the aim
of Stanford's lower division re
quirements. "In that sense, they are
necessary," he said. "But they are
certainly subject to improvement.
To take a small point, I think that
the requirements should be spread
out over four years instead of being
crammed into the first two."
"When I approve the trend to
ward a strictly controlled type of
curriculum, I don't mean the '100
best books' type of education. That
is too restrictive," he said. "There is
a middle ground."
"A free-elective system or Hutch
ins' retreat to medievalism can
both lead to intellectual flatulence,"
Dodds pointed out.
DEFENDS LIBERAL EDUCATION
Defending this restricted type of
liberal education, Dr. Dodds select
ed two grounds.
"It can be defended practically
because it is a protective. Many
students plunge into a prospective
field too early when they come to
college, change their minds, and
have to start over. For this group
liberal education offers the further
opportunity to consider his plans.

Second, education is more than
just learning a trade. It helps you
become a human being. A man's
success depends on more than abil
ity in a specific field.
"Success depends on the richness
of themselves and of knowing peo
ple and ideas. Liberal education
can make the individual a better in
dividual— one who can live with
himself," Dodds said.
SURVEY COURSES IMPORTANT
Dr. Dodds pointed out a definite
need for survey courses. "How else
can we meet certain areas of knowl
edge which we may never have time
to explore as fully as we should
like to?" he asked.
However, there are "both good
=md bad survey courses," he said.
Dr. Dodds qualified his support of
survey courses by saying that "a
complete program of them is not
good. They must be taken in con
junction with courses of a specific
nature."
OBSTACLES IN WAV
There are two traps awaiting gen
eral education, according to Dr.
Dodds: "the danger of thinnes* and
superficiality at one extreme and
that of pseudo - professionalism —
teaching a course as if the student
is a potential Ph.D. in the subject—
at the other."
Summing up his feelings. Dr.
Dodds said, "There ought to be sol
id, rigorous introductory courses
which do not have behind them a
cavalier contempt for the student
who does not expect to progress
from Phrenology 22 to 222."
