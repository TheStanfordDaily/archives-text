"Knight of the Burning Pestle,"
Beaumont and Fletcher's Eliza
bethan burlesque, will be read by
the Stanford Players tonight at 8:15
in the Little Theater. Tickets sell
for 30 cents in room 202, Memorial
Hall, or may be obtained at the

PLOT OF PLAY
In the play a citizen and his wife,
played by Gordon Pederson and
Nancy Leavelle, interrupt the play
to have their workman given a part.
The workman Ralph, or Walter
Krumm, a sort of Don Quixote who
thinks he is a knight destined to
save ladies from danger, goes
throughout the play doing his act
separately.
TIME OF CERVANTES
The farce was written around the
same time as Cervantes wrote his
famous '"Don Quixote." The citizen
and his wife are two of the most
famous burlesque characters in
Elizabethan literature, according to
Hall Martin, director of the reading.
