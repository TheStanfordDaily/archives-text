mer U.S. diplomat in the Far East,
will speak on "Conflicts in the Far
East" from 1 to 2 p.m. Saturday at

lations in Cubberley Auditorium.
"You may think General Marshall
has the most complicated task in
the world, but it is nothing com
pared to Chiang Kai-shek's," stated
Dr. Buss.
UNIFIED NATION
"Marshall has behind him a uni
; fied nation, strong in tradition, and
the most uniformly overfed people
in the world, but Chiang's strength
comes only from the quality of his

rich culture," Dr. Buss added.
In his speech Saturday Dr. Buss
will stress the problems which the
United States faces in Korea, Japan,
; and southeast Asia. "We have vital
interests in these countries," said

there, and we must adapt our policy
J to their opinions."
