# 'Stay in Germany' Hanna Warns U.S.
## 
### 
"If we withdraw from Germany
in the next 25 years, we will leave
a vacuum which Communism will
move in to fill," Paul R. Hanna, pro
fessor of education, warned the
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night.
Stressing Germany's need for
America's continued assistance with
money, materials, and personnel,
Mr. Hanna said: "The soil is most
fertile with poverty, confusion, and
despair for Communism to grow."
ARMY HELPS
The Army in the American zone
has "made order out of chaos," Mr.
Hanna said. They have restored
many of the transportation and com
munication facilities, and they are
now turning to the sociological,
economic, and political issues.
Explaining the four-power mili
tary government of Germany, Mr.
Hanna said, "It is very difficult to
govern the American zone from
Berlin, in the Russian zone.
EDUCATION PROBLEMS
As a consultant on the reform of
the education system in Germany,
Mr. Hanna deplored the lack of
facilities and equipment with which
the education personnel had to work.
"In all the offices of education in
the American zone, there are only
56 persons." Since the Americans
dismissed 50 percent of the teachers
because they were suspected of
teaching Nazi principles, there are
very few persons allowed to teach.
The books were confiscated, and few
books are approved for use. Even
the school buildings are scarce.
FOOD, HOUSING LACK
The Germans in the cities are
living in "the most primitive dwell
ings." They do not have enough to
eat, and there is little raw material
for industry. But, Mr. Hanna said,
the people fill the cold, bombed-out
opera houses to satisfy their hunger
for music.—Betty Talbot.
