# English A Aims at Giving Students Good Basic Foundation in Grammar
## 
### 
By ALLEN BLETZ
It is common around the campus
to .say, "English A certainly is a
waste of time," and"I can't pos
sibly learn anything new from this
required subject."
True, English A is just a repeat
of high school grammar and com
position, but the majority of sec
ondary schools in the United States
have fallen down on their job of
teaching English grammar. This,
however, is not the fault of the
instructors or schools, but it is due
to the overload of work that is
I laced upon these teachers. Over 50
per cent of the students that come
to Stanford each year from high
school fail to pass the matriculation
test because of their lack of knowl
edge in writing compositions and
usaj?e of grammar.
t MOOTII WRITING TAUGIIT
"To accomplish enough technical
command of correcting misusages of
English and to enable students to
write smoothly and easily" is the
keynote of English A, according to
Dr. Whitaker, professor of English.
Dr. Whitaker also brought out the
point that all the advanced profes
sional schools at Stanford feel that
students are not capable of writing
collect compositions and term pa
pers.
The course has many practical

uses. Besides teaching the use of
grammar and effective writing to
a student, it also develops confi
dence in writing. The majority of
occupations and professions de
mand good English, whether it is in
the form of speech or in writing
letters, and unless a college gradu
ate has a good command of English
fundamentals, he lacks a definite
quality of a successful business or
professional man.
USE COUKSE LATER
English A, 2A, and 2B should be
of prime importance to every fresh
man on the campus, for a success
ful study in these courses lays the
cornerstone for good work in all
other subjects. It certainly would
be useless for any student in the
Law School to attempt writing legal
notices or a Graduate School of
Business man to write business let
ters, if he failed to acquire a good
foundation in English when he was
a freshman. Advanced students
now are realizing the importance

that "dumbell" English contributed
to their academic work.
In the future, it is the hope of the
English Department that a closer
understanding will exist between
the English A students and the Eng
lish instructors, lor only when the
students themselves realize that
they are not being subjected to a
"useless" course, then, and only
then, will English A accomplish its
task â€” that of developing students
into better writers.
