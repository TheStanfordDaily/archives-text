An extra production of the Studio
Theater and the first in a series of
plays by the Stanford Experimental
Theater, "No Exit" will be seen for i

the first time on tho West Coast in
its first non-professional perform

London and New York. The New
York Drama Critics' Circle awarded
it a prize as the b?st foreign play
of the season.
Eric Bently, in his book "The
Playwright as Thinker," said of "No
FiXit": "It shows what kind of things
three people chose and avoided to
earn for themselves eternal damna
tion. It shows what kind of things
they continue to choose and avoid
even in hell. What is hell? It is to
he a botched character and to
be forever imprisoned with other
botched characters. I would call 'No
, Exit' philosophical melodrama. It is
I certainly not tragedy—there is no
1 tragic dignity, no tragic protagonist,
,no tragic anything — unless one
wishes to spout oracularly about the
tragedy of human life as a whole.
It is not comedy—there is no laugh
ter or acceptance in this unqualified
and almost demoniac assault upon
human nature."
Director of the play is George
Nichols 111. The cast includes Bea
trice Manley, Bill Voronberg. Elaine
Maltzmann. and Kenneth Jotns.
