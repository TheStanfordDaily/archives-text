# Indians Clip Skymasters, 6-1, as Cardinalli Stars
## 
### ED SHEAHAN 
Ben Cardinalli's here-to-fore silent bat led the Cardinal nine
to a 6 to 1 victory over the Moffett Field Skymasters on the
losers' diamond yesterday afternoon. Cardinalli and Buck
Brownson, stellar shortstop, paced the ten-hit Indian attack with
three blows apiece left fielder George Sloat garnered two.

The Cardinals coasted to victory
on fine hurling by Dick Flatland,
Larry Wolf and Dave Dahle, with
the starting hurler, Flatland, getting
credit for the victory.
Coach Harry Wolter spread the
pitching duty equally between the
three hurlers, preping them for the
Big Game Saturday with Califor
nia. Together, the pitchers whiffed
nine sailors and allowed nary a
walk. They gave up a total of but
six hits.
BROWNSON SOCKS IN TWO
The Cardinals got rolling in the
second inning when right fielder
A 1 Kircher was safe on an error
and Cardinalli doubled into right
field. Both scored two outs later
when Brownson lashed a single into
left field after Flatland had walked.
The Cards picked up another run
in the third when Kircher went to
third on an overthrow at first and
came home on Cardinalli's second
hit.
ERRORS AID INDIAN CAUSE
The lower end of the batting
order added two more in the fifth
when Kircher again got on base via
the error route and Cardinalli
pushed him around with his third
hit. Both scored a minute later when
Wolf's blooper rolled through the
MofTett's shortstop to score both
men.
A final tally was added in the
ninth when Cardinalli got to first
on a boot by the second baseman
and scored on Clyde Dingfelder's
to right field.
THE NAVY SCORED
The lone Sailor run was made in
the first inning when Lucero, the
Moffett first baseman, hit a ball
between Sloat and Lloyd Merri

man for a triple and scored on
Brownson's error.
The starting Cardinal lineup saw
Ted Nell move into the infield at
second base and A 1 Kircher, who
has been hitting the ball hard, go out
to tight field.
STEADY SUPPORT FOR lIURLERS
The game was marked by the un
usually steady play of the Cardin
als, who made only one error to
give their pitchers the support which
they have failed to provide the last
few times out.
This game made the tenth out of
the last eleven that the Red Ma
chine has won.
The Varsity's next game will be
against California Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond.
JV's RALLY FAILS
Meanwhile, at home, a crippled
Junior Varsity went down fighting
to the University of San Francisco
"B" team, 7 to 4, as a three-run
rally in the ninth fell far short of
its mark.
Pat Casey, frosh infielder, paced
the Junior Cards' attack with four
clean hits. Don Gabrielson and For
rest Shumway were on the mound
for the Farm. The "B" tepm meets
the California Cinnamon Beai's Sat

BROWNSON SOCKS IN TWO
The Cardinals got rolling in the
second inning when right fielder
A 1 Kircher was safe on an error
and Cardinalli doubled into right
field. Both scored two outs later
when Brownson lashed a single into
left field after Flatland had walked.
The Cards picked up another run
in the third when Kircher went to
third on an overthrow at first and
came home on Cardinalli's second
hit.
ERRORS AID INDIAN CAUSE
The lower end of the batting
order added two more in the fifth
when Kircher again got on base via
the error route and Cardinalli
pushed him around with his third
hit. Both scored a minute later when
Wolf's blooper rolled through the
MofTett's shortstop to score both
men.
A final tally was added in the
ninth when Cardinalli got to first
on a boot by the second baseman
and scored on Clyde Dingfelder's
to right field.
THE NAVY SCORED
The lone Sailor run was made in
the first inning when Lucero, the
Moffett first baseman, hit a ball
between Sloat and Lloyd Merri

man for a triple and scored on
Brownson's error.
The starting Cardinal lineup saw
Ted Nell move into the infield at
second base and A 1 Kircher, who
has been hitting the ball hard, go out
to tight field.
STEADY SUPPORT FOR lIURLERS
The game was marked by the un
usually steady play of the Cardin
als, who made only one error to
give their pitchers the support which
they have failed to provide the last
few times out.
This game made the tenth out of
the last eleven that the Red Ma
chine has won.
The Varsity's next game will be
against California Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond.
JV's RALLY FAILS
Meanwhile, at home, a crippled
Junior Varsity went down fighting
to the University of San Francisco
"B" team, 7 to 4, as a three-run
rally in the ninth fell far short of
its mark.
Pat Casey, frosh infielder, paced
the Junior Cards' attack with four
clean hits. Don Gabrielson and For
rest Shumway were on the mound
for the Farm. The "B" tepm meets
the California Cinnamon Beai's Sat
urday at 10 a.m. on the Frosh Field.
Ben Cardinalli's here-to-fore silent bat led the Cardinal nine
to a 6 to 1 victory over the Moffett Field Skymasters on the
losers' diamond yesterday afternoon. Cardinalli and Buck
Brownson, stellar shortstop, paced the ten-hit Indian attack with
three blows apiece left fielder George Sloat garnered two.

The Cardinals coasted to victory
on fine hurling by Dick Flatland,
Larry Wolf and Dave Dahle, with
the starting hurler, Flatland, getting
credit for the victory.
Coach Harry Wolter spread the
pitching duty equally between the
three hurlers, preping them for the
Big Game Saturday with Califor
nia. Together, the pitchers whiffed
nine sailors and allowed nary a
walk. They gave up a total of but
six hits.
