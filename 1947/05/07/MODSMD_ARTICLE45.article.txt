Baseball
Intramural soitball squads had an
added competitor yesterday, in that
a stiff breeze caused some confusion
in the outfields. An easy win was
scored by the A.T.O. sluggers, who
inaugurated a long parade of base
runners to swamp the Encina 2W
squad, 20-1.
Phi Delt and Phi Psi engaged in
a see-saw hitting duel on Field 3,
but a pay-off punch came in the
fourth inning when Bierdorf's homer
with two men on pushed the Phi
Delts into a lead they held until the
game ended. Frank Purr is credited
with the mound win for Phi Delt
in a final score tagged at 13-6.
Meanwhile on Field 2, Sigma Chi
breezed to a decisive 16-3 victory
over Delta Chi, backing up hurler
Bob Slobe with more than enough
hitting power needed to win.
The fifth and final campus game
of the day saw a nip-and-tuck
battle between Chi Psi and the
Basement Bombers, who could not
quite tip the scales in their favor in
the last inning. Chi Psi got the nod
in this one by a close 12-10 score,
collecting 17 hits to support winning
pitcher Elia Long.

Baseball
Intramural soitball squads had an
added competitor yesterday, in that
a stiff breeze caused some confusion
in the outfields. An easy win was
scored by the A.T.O. sluggers, who
inaugurated a long parade of base
runners to swamp the Encina 2W
squad, 20-1.
Phi Delt and Phi Psi engaged in
a see-saw hitting duel on Field 3,
but a pay-off punch came in the
fourth inning when Bierdorf's homer
with two men on pushed the Phi
Delts into a lead they held until the
game ended. Frank Purr is credited
with the mound win for Phi Delt
in a final score tagged at 13-6.
Meanwhile on Field 2, Sigma Chi
breezed to a decisive 16-3 victory
over Delta Chi, backing up hurler
Bob Slobe with more than enough
hitting power needed to win.
The fifth and final campus game
of the day saw a nip-and-tuck
battle between Chi Psi and the
Basement Bombers, who could not
quite tip the scales in their favor in
the last inning. Chi Psi got the nod
in this one by a close 12-10 score,
collecting 17 hits to support winning
pitcher Elia Long.
