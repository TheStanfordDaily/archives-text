# Stanford's Linksters Boast Unmatched Collegiate Record
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
The combination of one of the finest golf layouts in the na
tion, matchless terrain, ideal weather conditions, Coach Eddie
Twiggs and very capable material has produced a competitive
lecord here at Stanford almost unmatched in the history of
Intercollegiate athletics. A pretty tall statement that last one,

and yet let's take a look at the
record books for confirmation. In
dian golfing teams have competed in
11 Pacific Coast Inter-collegiate
Championships and have brought
home the bacon no less than 10
times. Seven Individual titles ai'e in
ter-spaced in this last figure. Of the
18 matches played with Cal, Stan
ford has emerged the winner on 14
occasions, amassing 324}/. points to
129'/,.
FIVE NATIONAL WINNERS
On a national scale, Indian squads
have produced five titlists in eight
attempts. One individual champ is
listed although three different Stan
ford men have been finalists. In
1941 the team placed fourth, for one
of its poorer showings, but even
then it was only six strokes behind
the winner.
The team scoring record for the
National Inter-collegiate tourney
was listed at 603 points until 1938
when the titilar Indian quartet
brought it down to 601 at Louisville,

Kentucky. This lasted until 1941
when another top-notch Stanford
squad lowered the standard to its
present total of 580. This divides out
into an average of 73 for the 36 hole
total for each man—a record that
should hold up for some time to
come.
The closest approach to this fig
ure is the 591 registered by, yes,
that's right, another Stanford team,
vintage of 1942. In the history of
National Inter-collegiate linksdom,
Stanford and Louisiana State Uni
versity are the only schools ever to
have broken 600.
AGAIN FAVORED
So much for history. This is 1947.
Well what of it! The current Indian
aggregation with only one dual meet
setback marring its fine record, will
doubtless be installed the favorite
to retain its defending national title
later on this summer at Ann Arbor,
Michigan.

lecord here at Stanford almost unmatched in the history of
Intercollegiate athletics. A pretty tall statement that last one,

and yet let's take a look at the
record books for confirmation. In
dian golfing teams have competed in
11 Pacific Coast Inter-collegiate
Championships and have brought
home the bacon no less than 10
times. Seven Individual titles ai'e in
ter-spaced in this last figure. Of the
18 matches played with Cal, Stan
ford has emerged the winner on 14
occasions, amassing 324}/. points to
129'/,.
FIVE NATIONAL WINNERS
On a national scale, Indian squads
have produced five titlists in eight
attempts. One individual champ is
listed although three different Stan
ford men have been finalists. In
1941 the team placed fourth, for one
of its poorer showings, but even
then it was only six strokes behind
the winner.
The team scoring record for the
National Inter-collegiate tourney
was listed at 603 points until 1938
when the titilar Indian quartet
brought it down to 601 at Louisville,

Kentucky. This lasted until 1941
when another top-notch Stanford
squad lowered the standard to its
present total of 580. This divides out
into an average of 73 for the 36 hole
total for each man—a record that
should hold up for some time to
come.
The closest approach to this fig
ure is the 591 registered by, yes,
that's right, another Stanford team,
vintage of 1942. In the history of
National Inter-collegiate linksdom,
Stanford and Louisiana State Uni
versity are the only schools ever to
have broken 600.
AGAIN FAVORED
So much for history. This is 1947.
Well what of it! The current Indian
aggregation with only one dual meet
setback marring its fine record, will
doubtless be installed the favorite
to retain its defending national title
later on this summer at Ann Arbor,
Michigan.
