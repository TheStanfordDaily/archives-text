# Farm Mermen Face Troy
## 
### 
One down and four to go is the
watchword for Coaches Brandsten
and Hayne's varsity swimmers as
they return to the practice lanes
after enjoying a successful after
noon against their first Pacific Coast
Conference opponent, the Univer
sity of California, last Staurday. The
locals downed the Golden Bear mer
men with comparative ease, but
still face several looming barriers
which they will have to clear if they
1 are to make a clean sweep of their
P.C.C. schedule.
The P.C.C. Southern Division finals
to be held in the UCLA pool on May
31, will, of course, be the toughest
nut to crack, but the team will meet
strong outfits from USC and UCLA,
as well as Cal in a return engagement
I at Berkeley before that time.

The immediate obstacle that faces
the Farm squad is the meet with
U.S.C.'s mermen this weekend.
Troy's swimmers receipted for the
worst shellacking that they had re
ceived in eighteen years when they
met Stanford last year, so they will
undoubtedly be thinking of nothing
but revenge when they invade the
Encina Pools next Saturday.
It remains to be seen, however.

whether or not the perpetually
strong Trojan team is powerful
enough to break the Indians' 20 dual
meet win string. The Farm team
that smashed or equalled every Big
Meet swim record but one last week
will have its sights ."Jet on a whole
new batch of meet records. And a
team that is breaking records is
hard to beat.
