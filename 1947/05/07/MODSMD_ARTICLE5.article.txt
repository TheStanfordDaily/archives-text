# Phone Settlement Abandoned; Unions Will Bargain Locally
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 6 (UP).-The National Federation of
Telephone Workers, in a drastic change in its stand on the
national telephone strike, tonight abandoned efforts to reach a
natir.ivvide agreement with the American Telephone <S Telegraph
Co. and instructed its affiliated unions to settle on a local basis
with Bell System companies.
NFTW president Joseph A. Beirne announced that the union's 49-
member policy committee had adjourned its meeting. It had been in con
tinuous session since March 24.
"From now on bargaining will be on a local basis," Beirne said, "un
less A.T.&T. wants to meet on a national basis and there is no indication
that it does."
Beirne's announcement was made only a few hours afler government
conciliators disclosed that A.T.&T. had made its third and best offer to
date to striking long lines workers and that settlement of that phase of
the national strike was "close as an eyelash."
Beirne declined to say what effect any settlement reached in the long
lines dispute would have on other striking workers.
But the policy committee's decision was viewed as a major change
in the NFTVV's stand. The union had sought from the first to bargain
nationally with A.T.&T. and maintained its position throughout the strike
despite the company's refusal to do so.
Beirne said there had been no change in the union's demand for a $6
<i week increase, but that contracts reached for a lower figure could bear
the endorsement of the parent unionâ€”it the local accepted and it seemed
Ihe best offer that would bo made.
