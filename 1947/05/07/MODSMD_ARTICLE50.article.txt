## Excom's Good Start 
### 
, Excom meeting last week was particularly
conspicuous for the number of newly-elected
members sitting on the side-lines watching the
executive committee in session.
This is a good sign and one which we hope
will be continued throughout the rest of the
quarter. We also hope that new Excom mem
bers are taking other suggestions as seriously,
for student government, if administered cor
rectly, is rather complex.
Excom is in a position of real responsibility.
An uninformed Excom can accomplish nothing
and still get by by merely following the rules
already set down for it.
But for an Excom to really accomplish some
specific aims and to improve the existing
system, requires that each Excom member
knows the present system backwards and
forwards before he takes office. This requires
a little work, and is the direct responsibility of

President-elect MartzloJf, and other elected
student officers.
We are glad to see the good start that is
being made. We hope it will continue.
Much the same type of training system
could be adopted for the incoming student
manager.
Although in the past the date for appoint
ing the new student manager has varied for
a number of legitimate reasons, some effort
should be made—perhaps in the form of a
recommendation by Excom to Mr. A 1 Mas
ters—to appoint the new student manager at
the same time as the Spring elections.
In order to be of any use at all, such a
system would have to include some specific
instructions to be followed by the new man
ager during his "training" period. This also
might be included in your recommendation to
Mr. Masters, Excom.
