Harold Ickes telephoned President Tresidder Sun
day to say that he was driving out to the campus
for a visit. Dr. Tresidder thereupon conceived the
idea that a good gag photo could be made oi' the
former Secretary of the Interior standing in front of
the Hoover Dam exhibit in the Boulder Library for
War and Peace. Inasmuch as Ickes is a former
newsman himself, Dr. Tresidder said point blank
that the University publicity man would like to have
a picture. But Ickes replied that he felt too strongly
about the matter to be humorous over it.

Fraternity pins for new members hardly ever
arrive in time for initiation. For that reason the pins
given to new members are usually borrowed tem
porarily from the old hands. Since the neophytes
are supposed to wear the pins for three days following
initiation, they are firmly indoctrinated with the
necessity of hanging on to those pins.
Last Saturday Jack Campbell further emphasized
the need for caution by reciting the classic story
of the wayward fraternity pin. It happened not so
long ago that an initiate, not realizing that his pin
was appropriated for the occasion from one of the

brothers, gave the pin to a girl that very night. The
payoff was that the pin and the girl both formerly
belonged to the same person. That's right, he pinned
his brother's girl with his brother's pin.

At Tamarack Lodge the boys have developed a
new expression, "Well, the eight minutes are up."
The expression is frequently interjected into their
bull sessions and has a special significance. It has
long been argued that a gang cannot get together for
a bull session without the topic turning to girls sooner
or later, usually sooner. Accordingly, an enterprising
social scientist at Tamarack decided to clock several
bull sessions to discover how long it really did take.
He found that almost without exception it took just
about eight minutes for the talk to swing around to
the subject of women.

Odds and Ends: Beer must be practically synony
mous with Stanford students. Tuesday a Poly Sci
prof used beer as an illustration for some point he
was making; the word "beer" was hardly out of his
mouth before there was a positive ripple of excite
ment around the class.
