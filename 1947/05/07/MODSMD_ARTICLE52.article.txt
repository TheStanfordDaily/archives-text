(Mr. Bower's letter is much longer than our space
limitations will generally permit us to print. How
ever, his letter is representative of several we have
received concerning the Daily's Monday interview
story with Dr. John Almack, so we are printing the
Jettcr in its entirety. Will future correspondents
please keep their letters as short as possible.â€”The
Editor.)
To the Editor:
Only because Dr. Almack, in his interview in
Monday's Daily, was seeking to find for education
"its true place in the American Culture," was I not
too surprised at what he said. Certainly his point
is well made, and the sort of program he has laid
out will put education on a level with general
American culture.
There are those, however, who will not be sat
isfied with this as a program. Some of us feel that
education should be a means of striving toward
something better, i.e., something different from what
we have. In other words, conducting the "serious
search for truth"he speaks of.
We won't find them, however, in the science lab,
of the engineering text. The principles taught there
will some day, and soon, go the way of Euclid's
Geometry. But, if a culture of mad materialism, in
creasing numbers of suicides, divorces, alcoholics and
neurotics is our goal, then practical education is our
answer.
How can we improve the world through "pro
ductive knowledge?" It is just this sort of thing
that has helped produce the airplane, radio, rail
roads, automobiles, etc., but it has also produced
the atomic bomb (though not atomic energy for
commercial or home use).
More important, however, are the things it has
not produced: friendly relations between nations
(including free trade); decrease in crime; improved
family relationships; more satisfactory distribution of
the world's goods; and the knowledge of how prop
erly to employ such great powers as are found in
airplanes, railroads or the atom bomb, in order to
avoid their use as instruments of death and destruc
tion.
Development of "productive knowledge" built
in Germany a great industry and large, well-planned
and solidly constructed cities. The same "productive
knowledge" developed a war machine to wipe them
out. Perhaps less emphasis on what Dr. Almack
calls "Education" that "produces something," and
more on a study of social principles, based on histori
cal experience, would have prevented that catas
trophe, and Germany's cities, if less scientifically
constructed would be still standing, and filled with
a more contented population.
He criticizes Hutchins as having "medieval" ideas.
Can he show that human society is better off for
having discarded the ideas Hutchins is trying to
replace? The University of Chicago and Harvard,

ber of writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable letters be short and to the point.)

our two greatest, and perhaps the world's finest, uni
versities have eliminated the elective system from
their lower division curriculum.
This does not mean that in the succeeding three
years which is needed to obtain an M.A. they fail
to give their full share of "realistic standards."
However, in attacking the problems in their par
ticular fields, whether it be engineering, chemistry,
medicine, law, or etc., the students have certain
fundamental and time-tested principles by which
they can relate knowledge of their specific field to
world problems generally. (Or does Dr. Almack
think that the problems of our society are unique
to the Twentieth Century?).
In Life magazine, recently I read an article by a
steel man advocating the increase of the price of
steel, as a means of stimulating production, in a fan
tastic refutal of all workings of the law of supply
and demand.
With the sort of education Dr. Almack proposes,
the country would be full of persons in influential
position who had never heard of this "ages-old"
law.
A Hutchins man would not consider such a fal
lacious plan, but would probably advocate other
means, perhaps not to his immediate advantage, but
which in the "long-run" would benefit him and
society as well. (I rriight mention Beardsley Ruml
as the sort of "uncreative" man Hutchins turns out).
Today we are faced with the general problem of
Communism. How many of those who advocate its
destruction (or its support, for that matter) are in
telligently aware of its essential characteristics, and
what probable influence it is likely to have on the
future of human society?
Is it intended that a student of today, who in
twenty or thirty years will be able to influence
opinion regarding some such question (whether it be
Communism, coal strikes, or the tariff problem)
shall be denied the opportunity, while in college, of
getting just the barest amount of background to
arrive at intelligent decisions on these problems.
I would say that over 75 percent of the students
at Stanford today could not intelligently discuss the
coal problem. Where else can they learn of the world's
problems but in college?
I might point out in closing that the proposed pro
gram would be dangerous to the future of the coun
try. I dislike name-calling, but it is essential to the
argument at hand to reiterate the point that Germany
indulged in "realistic" education, and denied access
to the classics, just before they dragged the world
into its most iniquitous war.
No, Dr. Almack, what we need in America today
is to divorce our higher education from the general
materialistic standard of American culture, and work
toward something better. That can only be done by
starting with the best from the past and working
toward a better future.
