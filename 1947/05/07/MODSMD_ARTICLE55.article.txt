# Alpiners Conquer Yosemite Summit
## 
### 
Three members of the Stanford
Alpine Club, Bud Gates, Ulf Ramm-
Ericson, and A 1 Baxter, made a first
ascent of the highest of the three
Watkins Pinnacles above Tenaya
Canyon in Yosemite last weekend.
Previously unsealed, the top of
this pinnacle has been the object of
many trips, and the climb by the
Stanfordites followed an unsuc
cessful attempt by five Sierra Club
members.
Leaving Mirror Lake Friday
night, the party packed up to the
8,352-foot summit of Mt. Watkins.
Saturday they climbed down the
steep shoulder to the notch separat
ing the two upper pinnacles from
the 2.000 - foot sheer face of the
mountain, and then, using over 400
feet of fixed rope in order to make a
return possible, the climbers roped
down into the notch and climbed to
the smaller saddle between the up
per pinnacles.
After placing two petons in a ver
tical crack on the exposed south
face of the pinnacle, they gained
the hitherto unconquered summit
and placed a large red and white
flag on the highest crag.
The trip, which took 27 hours in
all, was the second of its kind for
Bud Gates and A 1 Baxter. In De
cember, 1946, they made the first
ascent of the middle pinnacle.
The lowest Watkins Pinnacle now
stands as the last citadel—the only
remaining unclimbed spire in Yo
semite Valley.
