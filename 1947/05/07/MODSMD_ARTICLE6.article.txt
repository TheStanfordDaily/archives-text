### 
WASHINGTON, May fi (UP).â€”President Ttumen and Secre
tary of State George C. Marshall told the Senate today that
failure to ratify the Italian and Balkan peace treaties would be
"a great misfortune and a heavy blow to this country in world
affairs."
Marshall appeared personally before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. He said that further delay would make it "difficult if not
impossible" to draw up peace pacts for Germany and Austria, and would
cause his efforts abroad to "practically dissolve."
Then he read a note from Mr. Truman backing his! position to the
limit. The President said he could not share the views of some persons
who said that the treaties ought to be upheld because of failure of the
recent Moscow foreign ministers' conference. He added:
"Those treaties are the results of months of effort by outstanding lead
ers of both parties in this government and of other governments to work
out a common peace in this important area of the world. Nothing has
occurred to render their efforts unsound or unwise.
"Treaties which have been worked out with the approval of so large
a proportion of all the nations convened at the Paris Peace Conference
represent the considered judgment o the it ternational community.
Moreover, many of the most difficult problems were resolved as the
result of American initiative.
