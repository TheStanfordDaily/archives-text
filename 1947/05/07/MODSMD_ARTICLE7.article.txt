To put il in the words of Miss
Lucie L. Lataillade, resident di
rector of Rohlc, "it's just a case
of spring-time exuberance" as far
as she is concerned.
At corridor meetings last Mon
day night Roble "Senators"
thought that something ought (o
he done about it and they said
"no more."
Joan Maxwell, freshman presi
dent of Ruble, said as far as she
was concerned she didn't care to
comment on the situation but sim
ply asked, "How would you like
necking going on in your smoking
room?"
