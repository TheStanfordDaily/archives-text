Students, Faculty Members, Indians—All
We have a reputation that is well founded. When you
hear "coffee" mentioned you think simultaneously of
SUGAR jOE'S. That is because "we do not serve ordi
nary coffee"—we serve "superb coffee"—and "steaks,"
Sugar joe's spelled backwards is "fine steaks." Yes, we
are "proud" of our "reputation" of serving the finest
on the Peninsula. Drop in and you will see why, when
SUCAR JOE'S is mentioned people "glow" with satis
faction.
