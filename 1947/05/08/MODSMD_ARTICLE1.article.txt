# Local Group to Give Mozart Comic Opera
## 
### 
The Intimate Opera Players, a newly formed group of local
singers, will make their first appearance at Stanford tomorrow in
Mozart's comic opera, "Cosi Fan Tutte," at 8:15 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
The big comic situation in "Cosi Fan Tutte" arises when two

young lovers, in order to test the
fidelity of their sweethearts, pre
tend to go to war and then return
to them in Oriental disguise. But
instead of being shunned they are
received with "violent love" by the
two ladies.
The singers are well known in the
Bay Area. Loi Hartzell, NBC artist,
will sing the part of Fiordilligi.
Dorabella, her close but fickle
friend, will be played by Beta Pop
per. James Schwabacher and Demy
Trevor will play the two lovers,
Fcrrando and Guglielmo.
Motivation of the plot rests large
ly with Don Alfonso, a cynical old
bachelor played by Joel Carter,
baritone, and Despina, irresponsible
maid-of-all-work sung by Marjorie
Dickinson. Carter is a Stanford
Music Department instructor and
played important roles in "The
Magic Flute" and "Der Freischutz."
The opera will be directed by Dr.
Jan Popper of the Stanford music
faculty and music director of the
Intimate Opera Players. Dr. Pop
per and Henry Holt of Palo Alto
will play a two-piano accompani
ment.
F l '. Cowles Strickland of the Stan
ford Speech and Drama Department
will stage the piece in true rococco
style. Sets designed by Wendell
Cole consist of large reversible
screens suggesting both interior and
exterior scenes.
The full - costumed production
concludes the spring series present
ed by the Stanford Department of
Music. Tickets, priced at $1 and
$1 s(i, are available at the Memorial
Hall box office and the Peninsula
Box Office in Palo Alto. All seats
