### 
(Editorial)
Two years ago today the Stan
ford Daily announced with a ban
ner headline the end of the war
in Europe. Front page stories
warned students not to celebrate
early. The Japanese war was not
yet over.
On campus the victory was ob
served by services in the Memo
rial Church and by student dis
cussions on the new problems
arising from Germany's defeat—
problems of occupation and of
"keeping the peace."
Today, two years later, the
Daily's front page is still con
cerned with the problems of
"keeping the peace." Today the
Farm is planning a Conference on
International Relations through
which students will gain a better
understanding of these problems.
Stanford students must not lose
sight of the fact that world prob
lems did not end wtih the vic
tories of 1915.—M.5.
