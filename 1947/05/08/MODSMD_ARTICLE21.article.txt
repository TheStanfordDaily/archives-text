Dr. Theodore Kreps, professor of business
economics, and Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman
of the Hoover Library and Institute will con
trast the opposing points of view of the two
major powers today at Stanford's Conference

on International Relations tomorrow
in Cubberley Auditorium.
"America's Position in the World
Today" is the title of Dr. Kreps'
speech which will be given from 4:30
to 5:30 p.m. Dr. Kreps will give
facts on America's economic posi
tion in world production and ex
ports and imports.
Emphasizing the fact that we are
one world economically, Dr. Kreps
will then briefly discuss America's
economic position in terms of the
democratic principles which it rep
resents.
Three principles are actually the
heart of America, according to Dr.
Kreps. The idea that no govern
ment should exist except with the
consent of the governed puts the
United States at odds with authori
tarian regimes in which this prin
ciple is secondary.
HIGHER STANDARDS
Another principle which disturb:;
international relations is that of
striving for a higher standard of
living. The effort of Americans to
increase the good things of life for all
the people makes authoritarian re
gimes all over the world feel uncer
tain, since their peoples demand
the same thing, said Dr. Kreps.
The third principle which Dr.
Kreps will discuss is the American
"sensitive conscience." Idealism, a
sense of justice for the oppressed,
and sympathy for the under-dog arc
ideas characteristic of the United
States which makes oppressed peo
ples all over the world turn to it
for help.
From 7 to 8 tomorrow night. Dr.
Fisher will speak on "Russia's Po
sition in the World Today." He
plans to emphasize two aspects of
Russia today: her position as a great
power, and her position as a revolu
tionary power.
RUSSIAN RELATIONS
Dr. Fisher will show the effect of
the position of Russia with respect to
the two views. He will also discuss
Russian relations with the United
States and with the United Nations.
Dr. Kreps, an economist with var
ied experience in government work,
has previously worked with the
OPA and the anti-trust division of
the Department of Justice. He also
served in an advisory capacity with
the Congressional Joint Committee
on Economic Reports.
Dr. Fisher traveled extensively in
Russia as chief of the Russian divi
sion of the American Relief Admin
istration in 1922-23. He has written
and edited many books on Russia, on
the Bolshevik revolution, and on
Russian famine and relief.
He has been news analyst for CBS
and NBC, and an editorial writer
for the Washington (D.C.) Herald.
A list found in captured German
reports showed that Dr. Fisher was
one of the 100 American educators,
writers, diplomats, and scientists
whom the Nazis intended to arrest
and liquidate immediately after they
had defeated the United States.
