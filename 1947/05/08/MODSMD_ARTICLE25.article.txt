# Rothwell Says UN Disunited
## 
### 
Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, one of
two speakers at last night's IDG dis
cusswyi on "The United Nations,"
explained that the UN is not a su
pernational body as is commonly
believed, but is an association of
nations under the United Nations
Charter.
This is primarily because national
governments arc unwilling to sur
render to a greater cc. 'ralized
power he said.
The main function of the Security
Council is the maintenance of peace
and security, while that of the Gen
eral Assembly is to develop general
welfare, he stated.
The greater powers have received
a more important position in the Se
curity Council because the possible
application of force would lead to a
full scale war.
Dr. Rothwell concluded his speech
by explaining the legalistic concept
and the flexible, dynamic concept
which emphasizes the importance of
abiding by the UN principles. The
United Sations is only one instru
ment of international relationships.
Dr. Morgan emphasized the impor
tance of the United States as a lead
er of peace, control of the atom bomb
being the enforcing factor. Unless
the United States takes this initia
tive towards peace, it is liable to be
caught unawares. "Defense is the
only prevention," said Dr. Morgan.
"World aggression can be stopped
only by a world force; a world po
lice force," he said.
