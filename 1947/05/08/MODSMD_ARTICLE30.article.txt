# Education Crisis Shown by Hanna
## 
### STU MILLAR 
(This is the third in a series of articles examining various ed
ucational theories held by Stanford professors. Tomorrow, Dean
John bartky of the School of Education, and Academic Vice-Presi
dent Alvin C. Eurich.)
We have arrived at a deep cultural crisis in our civilization

because our educational standard"
has not expanded with the age, ac
cording lo Dr. Paul Hanna, profes
sor of Education at Stanford.
And progress is the most vital
need of American education today,
said Hanna. Most rules and institu
tions we have are better suited to
the aye of oxteam transportation,
typical school curricula is inade
quate for our time . . . we have been
satisfied merely with our inheri
tance . . . our institutions have not
kept pace with technological ad
vances, he said.
PLANNED EDUCATION
"Today more than ever we must
provide education in realistic exper
ience. People must be educated to
know what the main problems they
lace are, and to act in terms of
their knowledge.
"And that education must have a
plan. Heretofore much of it has been
haphazard. Education cannot be left
to the whim of the individual
teacher or the caprice of the stu
dent. The best people should plan
a coherent system that will be uni
versally applicable. And the best
people should keep revising it.''
REPRESENTS MIDDLE
Dr. Hanna probably represents the
middle-of-the-road liberal in his
educational theories. On the one ex
treme is Dr. Robert Hutchins and
his "100-best-books" plan. At the
other is progressive education.
Starting out years ago in the pro
gressive camp, Dr. Hanna consistent
ly veered away from it toward the
humanistic side.
"The progressives started to cry
stallize their method and leit little
loom for constant improvement and
metamorphosis that education needs.
Then too, they based their teaching
too much on psychology and biology
and not enough on social sciences
and philosophy.
"That resulted in an education that
was long on method but short on
content. You just can't put stock in
complete child-centered type of edu
cation. That much freedom is dan
gerous.
AMR EES WITH DR. DODDS
"I agree with Dr. Dodds of the
Humanities department that a well
planned core of general education
tor all is sound and reasonable. The
school may well be the only institu
tion where everybody can attain the
common learning and outlook neces
sary for cultural balance. Right
now we live in the midst of cul
tural confusion and divergence. We
must use education to restore an
outlook common to all people."
Explaining why the crisis is so
immediate, Dr. Hanna said. "Tech
nology has improved the comforts
of man, but it has finally reached a
point where it endangers the entire
existence of mankind. The corres
ponding progress in reforming our
values has not been made.
"Our material progress has reached
the danger point; the brotherhood
of man must soon be effected or men
will destroy themselves. The two
types of progress must parallel each
other.
FAVORS HARVARD REPORT
"That is why 1 favor the Harvard
report. It realizes the need for uni
versal understanding and action up
on universal problems. The man at
the plow must be just as intelligent
ly informed as the Ph.D.'s when it
comes to voting effectively.
"Realizing these inadequacies of
education, I attack them. But don't
call me an iconoclast. I only ask
that we find a basis of agreement
among the welter of conflicting
theory. When we do find this clear
basis we can procede along constant
and dynamic lines of progress—prog
ress with a plan—toward the one
primary goal: a world community
of informed, well-educated people
who can live with themselves."

"The progressives started to cry
stallize their method and leit little

metamorphosis that education needs.
Then too, they based their teaching
too much on psychology and biology

AMR EES WITH DR. DODDS
"I agree with Dr. Dodds of the
Humanities department that a well
planned core of general education
tor all is sound and reasonable. The
school may well be the only institu
tion where everybody can attain the
common learning and outlook neces
sary for cultural balance. Right
now we live in the midst of cul
tural confusion and divergence. We
must use education to restore an
outlook common to all people."
Explaining why the crisis is so
immediate, Dr. Hanna said. "Tech
nology has improved the comforts
of man, but it has finally reached a
point where it endangers the entire
existence of mankind. The corres
ponding progress in reforming our
values has not been made.
"Our material progress has reached
the danger point; the brotherhood
of man must soon be effected or men
will destroy themselves. The two
types of progress must parallel each
other.
FAVORS HARVARD REPORT
"That is why 1 favor the Harvard
report. It realizes the need for uni
versal understanding and action up
on universal problems. The man at
the plow must be just as intelligent
ly informed as the Ph.D.'s when it
comes to voting effectively.
"Realizing these inadequacies of
education, I attack them. But don't
call me an iconoclast. I only ask
that we find a basis of agreement
among the welter of conflicting
theory. When we do find this clear
basis we can procede along constant
and dynamic lines of progress—prog
ress with a plan—toward the one
primary goal: a world community
of informed, well-educated people
who can live with themselves."

has not expanded with the age, ac

sor of Education at Stanford.
And progress is the most vital
need of American education today,
said Hanna. Most rules and institu
tions we have are better suited to
the aye of oxteam transportation,
typical school curricula is inade
quate for our time . . . we have been
satisfied merely with our inheri
tance . . . our institutions have not
kept pace with technological ad
vances, he said.
PLANNED EDUCATION
"Today more than ever we must
provide education in realistic exper
ience. People must be educated to
know what the main problems they
lace are, and to act in terms of
their knowledge.
"And that education must have a
plan. Heretofore much of it has been
haphazard. Education cannot be left
to the whim of the individual
teacher or the caprice of the stu
dent. The best people should plan
a coherent system that will be uni
versally applicable. And the best
people should keep revising it.''
