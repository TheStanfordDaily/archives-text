PLOT DKFIKS EXPLANATION
Author - lyricist Harry Muheim
explains "It's a Deal" as "a satire
investigation of several phases of
American economy, taking a some
what lighter view than the Wail

"The plot is compiex, loaded with
economic intrigue, and cannot be
explained in two sentences. Some
times I think it cannot be explained

"People who have read it have
compared it with Ibsen," he boasted.
"Their conclusion is that it is not
much like Ibsen."
But the show is good, he prom
ised, and loaded with 14 tremen
dous songs by F. M. Scott 111.
