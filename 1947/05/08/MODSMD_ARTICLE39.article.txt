# Los Altos Owners Object to Noise
## 
### 
Residents of the Los Altos hills
announced yesterday, through their
attorney, that they had prepared to
take legal action against- the oper
ator of Adobe Creek Lodge on the
grounds that the resort is a public
nuisance.
The Los Altos citizens charged
that noise from a resort loud speaker
can be heard over a two-mile radius
"until all hours of the morning." A
second complaint is that automobiles
going to and from the lodge consti
tute a traffic hazard.
Residents of the area will meet
next Tuesday night to outline a
plan of action and consult with their
attorney.
