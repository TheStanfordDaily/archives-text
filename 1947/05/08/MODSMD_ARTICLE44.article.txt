# Walkup. Merriman Lead Farm's Diamond Attack
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Catchcr Ward Walkup and center fielder Lloyd Merriman
are still the big guns in the Farm's baseball attack, a check of
the team's latest conference batting records revealed yesterday.
The big catcher, although he drove in the winning run against
the Uclans last Saturday, dropped a few points, but he's still

leading the Farm bat parade with a
hefty .375 mark in eight games.
Lloyd Merriman, who started the
season out badly in the Southland,
has been raising his average stead
ily with each CIBA game, until he
broke into the .300 circle last week
with a .303 mark.
ONE-TWO COMBINE
Ted Nell and Merriman are the
one-two combination in the impor
tant RBI column, for Nell has
knocked seven Indians across the
plate on seven hits, whereas Merri
man is right behind with six.
With a .282 mark, George Sloat
rates as one of the top Farm bat
wielders, for he has driven in five

runs on 11 hits—the most any In
dian has collected.
In the pitching department, Dave
Stott added two victories last week
to his conference record by helping
i to shut out the Gaels and by beating
j the Uclans.
LEADS PITCHING
As a result, Stott leads the mound
corps with four victories for the
season, three of them in loop play.
Dave Dahle has chalked up two
conference wins against one loss—
which means that Stott and Dahle
are the only pitchers to win loop
games for the Indians.
Dick Flatland has yet to be beat
en; he has been credited with three
I victories.
