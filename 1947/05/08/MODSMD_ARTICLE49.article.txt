and three on the Winged O team.
For the Indians, Saturday's match
will be a means of reasserting their
status in Bay Area Net circles. Last
week Stanford dropped a riotous 5-4
decision to California on the Berke
ley courts.
SHIFT BACK, FORTH
The advantage shifted back and
forth in the Bear encounter, with the
host Berkleyites copping the win in
the deciding third doubles match.
Tension rode on every game, but
the Card entry couldn't pull the
match out of the fire.
Saturday, the Indians pit their
youth and fire against the veteran
Olympic Clubbers with a fair chance
for success. Bob Lewis, steadily
improving his first-spot seeding, will
lead the locals at number one sin
gles.
LINEUP IN DOUBT
Challenge matches have upset the
remainder of the seedings to such
an extent that Coach Elwyn Bugge
has not yet selected the rest of his
lineup. Especially spirited competi
tion rages for the sixti singles slot
between Fred Lewis, Dave Basham,
and Ross Hughes.
Doubles pairings are fairly well
settled, with Basham and Bob Rut
ledge leading off at number one.
Bob Lewis and Kirk Mechem will
play second position, and the Drew
Putty - Ross Hughes combo com
pletes the doubles picture.
Smarting under their first defeat of
the season, at the hands of the Cal
JV's, the Indian Junior Varsity ten-

Three former Stanford tennis "greats" come back to haunt the
Indian 1947 net team Saturday afiernoon as they lead the Olym
pic Club into battle with the locals. Action starts at 1:30 on the
Farm courts.
Larry Dee, Jim Wade, and Ronnie Edwards are the ex-Indian
netsters who are seeded one, two,. —

nis team plays San Francisco Junior
College on the local courts tomor
row. The rueeed Indians start their
offensive at 2:30 p.m.
Tom Huffman takes over first
singles assignment, while Ed Mc-
Ganny holds down number two
place. Third seeding goes to Dick
Kilner, stocky power-slugger.
TESTS SQUAD
The remaining three singles places
will be filled by Walker Wallace,
Jack Frost, and Vic Randolph.
Coach Elwyn Bugge has shaken up
his lineup in order to get a line on
the capabilities of his entire squad.
Grover Miller joins Huffman for
the first doubles match, followed
closely by the smooth McGanny-
Kilner team at second. Frost and
Wallace play third seeded doubles.
Tomorrow's match is a replay of
a previous tennis date rained out
earlier in the season. The Cards
were quite impressive in the first
sets run off that day, and on the basis
of that performance should rule the
definite favorites. The spirited com
petition that has been the order of
the day for starting assignments
should carry the Indians through
without undue strain.
