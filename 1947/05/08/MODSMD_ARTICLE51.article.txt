# Golfers Face Tough Bruin Foe Saturday
## 
### 
The road back to victory may prove exceding rough if not
impassable for Coach Eddie Twiggs' Stanford linksters Saturday,
for impeding the way will be the highly touted UCLA Bruins.
The invading Southerners have as yet to taste defeat, having
knocked off six opponents with ridiculous ease. However, the

Uclans had better be on their toes
or those surprising California Bears
are liable to pin defeat number 1
on them Friday before the Indians
get to them.
BEARS SURPRISE
Minus the services of Bobby Ros
burg, Stanford's heavily favored
sextet was held to a tie by the
pesky Bears last wertk. Thus, if
UCLA should score a lop-sided win,
as many experts predict, the Bruins
would then be tabbed the favorites.
Leading the vaunted Bruin at
tack is Bob Gardner, current pos
sessor of the Southern California
Amateur title. Bob, one of the most
vastly improved players in the
country, is considered a strong can
didate for the 1947 National Ama
teur championship. Gardner has
not fired over 68 for 18 holes in any
of his collegiate team matches this
year.
No. 2 BRUIN
Pressing Gardner for top honors

is Ted Richards, former CIF titlist
from Long Beach. Richards was the
! low qualifier for 3G holes in the
LA area for the National Amateur
! in 194G.
i Tom Lambie and Rosburg, cur
rent No. 1 and No. 2 Stanford men,
will definitely have their hands full
in handling the two Bruins, but su
perior depth in Cardinal, Shuler,
Rosecrance, ami Kellburg may pull
the Indians through.
Rosburg pulled down a fourth
among the amateurs in the recent
California State Open, finishing be
hind Tal Smith who fired a 282,
Erny Pieper, and Captain Mosely
of the Army Air Corps. The Indian
and 71 for his accumulative total of
flash combined scores of 71, 73, 75
290. Lloyd Mangrum, National Open
Champ, topped the youthful colle
giate by two strokes, carding a 288.
