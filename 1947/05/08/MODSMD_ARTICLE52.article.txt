## The 						‘I’ Conference Is for You 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 President Don
ald B. Tresidder will open Stanford's first
Conference on International Relations, a ser
ies of lectures and seminars scheduled for
Friday afternoon, Saturday and Sunday.
The idea of the Conference, and the ground
work and planning of it, have come from stu
dents who have been working for several
months to bring to the student body a program
which will help to sum up world problems
and their possible solutions.
The Conference is a part of the broad pro
gram of the Institute of International Relations.
It offers every student an opportunity right
now to listen to and talk with men whose
experience and studies better qualify them to
deal with world affairs.
This is an opportunity which shouldn't be

overlooked. Most students on campus, par
ticularly the veterans, have professed deep
concern over decisions which are being made
throughout the world today. These decisions,
directly or indirectly, will eventually concern
and influence the lives of every person.
Groups of individuals, acting together, can
change or modify these decisions if they act
correctly.
It seems ridiculous that people should have
to be reminded of this fact. And yet past
events have proven this to be the case.
Tomorrow's Conference, if it is to be re
peated again in future years, will need the
support of every student.
It offers information and discussions which
well warrant the time the Conference will
take.
