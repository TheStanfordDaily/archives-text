### TOM SELF 
Well, here I go lapsing into reminiscences again.
But, as the philosophers say, when you're old, all
you have left is your memories. And I'll remember
one riotous English class long after I've forgotten the
phenotypic ratio of red and white guinea pigs. Here's
what happened.
One morning the instructor came to class abso
lutely beamingâ€”as though his cup were running
over. At any rate he canceled four out of live as
signments he had previously dealt out, apologized
for having required so much work, then junked the
day's lesson to read poetry.
Poetry he picked was "I've Been So Great a
Lover," by Rupert Brooke. Alter reading the pas
sage, "the rough male kiss of a blanket," he stopped,
removed his glasses, and inquired of the class how
they liked the simile. Dead silence.
"Well, come, come, surely you girls have some
ideas on the subject," he coaxed. "Haven't any of
you been kissed lately?" There followed some
squirming in the seats, a few giggles.
The uncomfortable silence failed to swerve the
instructor from his path. Determined to have the
class join his buoyant spirit, he tried a different tack.
"Now I wonder who is the Great Lover today. In

my time it was Valentino." Again silence. Some
smiled at the thought that the teacher was just a hair
behind the times.
Finally a brave rough could stand it no longer.
He blurted out, "It's that chubby, freckle-faced boy,
Van Johnson." That got a reaction! Three girls
whirled on him as one and chorused, "He is not!"
"Well, what's his technique?" the teacher con
tinued, rising to the bait. "Is he suave like Valen
tino?" (Bull Sessioner's note: Valentino was'a slick,
Latin type of lover who made your mother's toes
tingle when he performed love on the silent screen.)
"No," the rough replied, adding fuel to the fire.
"Like I said, he's chubby and freckled."
"Well, what's the secret of his charm?" wheedled
the instructor.
"Psychologists explain his attraction as a manifes
tation of the mother instinct in women," the intrepid
one continued. Vigorous snorting around the class.
Again the gals rushed to the attack: "He's not
chubby and freckle-faced; he's just sweet and natu
ral, and a good actor, and kind to his mother, and ...
A pitched battle between the outspoken boy and
the Stanford chapter of the Van Johnson fan club
was narrowly averted by the bell.
