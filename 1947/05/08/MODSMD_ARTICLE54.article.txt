### OR APPERSON 
This week, in Sacramento, the much discussed
and much maligned highway bill will again come up
for discussion.
This bill, written by Senator Randolph Collier
and.strongly supported by Governor Warren, has
passed through several interesting stages.
It originated as a result of an 18 months' study by
a joint highway committee appointed from both the
Senate and the Assembly.
This committee traveled over the entire state,
meeting with local Chambers of Commerce, Granges,
service clubs, and other interested groups. The com
mittee studied local conditions, and attempted to
make an overall 10-year plan which would again
bring the highways of California to their former
nationwide pre-eminence, to make these highways
adequate to carry the present traffic, and in addi
tion, to carry the contemplated increased traffic of
ten years hence.
The committee did a fine job. They found facts
and figures, and alloting a minimum of expenditure
for secondary roads, determined that a 3 billion
dollar program over the ten year period was nec
essary.
They realized that the gas tax was the fairest
method of raising this money and recommended a
4 cent tax, with an increased scale of taxes on heavy
trucks and busses, in proportion to the wear and tear
they cause on the highway system.
All this was introduced as Senate Bill No. 5, and
passed by the Senate. Then the fireworks started.
The next event was perhaps the finest bit of fold
ing-cabbage lobbying that has been carried on in
Sacramento or any other capitol in a great many
years.
The oil companies, the bus companies, and the

trucking companies went to work through their lob
byists and, to make a long story short, succeeded
in getting the Assembly to emasculate the bill thor
oughly. Most of the construction provisions were left
intact, but the wherewithal to pay for them was
removed.
Now, it comes up again. It is a foregone conclu
sion that the original bill, with its complete program
could not and will not be passed. It is regrettable
that some people cannot see beyond their respective
noses.
The one "minor detail"—the number of lives that
would be saved daily—should be enough for most
people to support the bill.
In addition, the time that would be saved by the
truck and bus companies on increased schedules,
free from binding bus traffic, and the greater con
venience to the private motorist are both easily
apparent.
Under the original bill, such highways as Bay
shore would be made into "freeways"—super-roads
with no stoplights and no left turns, with enough
lanes to handle almost any traffic volume. However,
such construction is a bit expensive, $200,000 or more
a mile. It cannot be paid for with hay.
Apparently some of our shortsighted legislators
still go by the old time rule-of-thumb, "vote for all
appropriations and no taxes." Almost without ex
ception, they agree that the need is there, that it
is a valid and praiseworthy idea, but they seem to
be afraid of offending the behind-the-scenes powers
that be.
This week should tell the story, whether the
needs of the driving public of California, the people
who really foot the bill, are to be considered, or
whether the heavy pressure of a few lobbyists
representing a few selfish interests will win again.

who really foot the bill, are to be considered, or
whether the heavy pressure of a few lobbyists
representing a few selfish interests will win again.
This week, in Sacramento, the much discussed
and much maligned highway bill will again come up
for discussion.
This bill, written by Senator Randolph Collier
and.strongly supported by Governor Warren, has
passed through several interesting stages.
It originated as a result of an 18 months' study by
a joint highway committee appointed from both the
Senate and the Assembly.
This committee traveled over the entire state,
meeting with local Chambers of Commerce, Granges,
service clubs, and other interested groups. The com
mittee studied local conditions, and attempted to
make an overall 10-year plan which would again
bring the highways of California to their former
nationwide pre-eminence, to make these highways
adequate to carry the present traffic, and in addi
tion, to carry the contemplated increased traffic of
ten years hence.
The committee did a fine job. They found facts
and figures, and alloting a minimum of expenditure
for secondary roads, determined that a 3 billion
dollar program over the ten year period was nec
essary.
They realized that the gas tax was the fairest
method of raising this money and recommended a
4 cent tax, with an increased scale of taxes on heavy
trucks and busses, in proportion to the wear and tear
they cause on the highway system.
All this was introduced as Senate Bill No. 5, and
passed by the Senate. Then the fireworks started.
The next event was perhaps the finest bit of fold
ing-cabbage lobbying that has been carried on in
Sacramento or any other capitol in a great many
years.
The oil companies, the bus companies, and the

trucking companies went to work through their lob
byists and, to make a long story short, succeeded
in getting the Assembly to emasculate the bill thor
oughly. Most of the construction provisions were left
intact, but the wherewithal to pay for them was
removed.
Now, it comes up again. It is a foregone conclu
sion that the original bill, with its complete program
could not and will not be passed. It is regrettable
that some people cannot see beyond their respective
noses.
The one "minor detail"—the number of lives that
would be saved daily—should be enough for most
people to support the bill.
In addition, the time that would be saved by the
truck and bus companies on increased schedules,
free from binding bus traffic, and the greater con
venience to the private motorist are both easily
apparent.
Under the original bill, such highways as Bay
shore would be made into "freeways"—super-roads
with no stoplights and no left turns, with enough
lanes to handle almost any traffic volume. However,
such construction is a bit expensive, $200,000 or more
a mile. It cannot be paid for with hay.
Apparently some of our shortsighted legislators
still go by the old time rule-of-thumb, "vote for all
appropriations and no taxes." Almost without ex
ception, they agree that the need is there, that it
is a valid and praiseworthy idea, but they seem to
be afraid of offending the behind-the-scenes powers
that be.
This week should tell the story, whether the
needs of the driving public of California, the people
who really foot the bill, are to be considered, or
whether the heavy pressure of a few lobbyists
representing a few selfish interests will win again.
