To the Editor:
Feeling the necessity of some explanation of the
childish behavior of our neighbors, the residents of
Toyon Hall, we have solicited the opinion of Dr.
Pierre PolikofT, celebrated Russian psychiatrist, and
herein present it to the Stanford campus as a whole.
'"It is true," said Dr. PolikofT, "that most Toyon
men cry themselves to sleep at night. This situation
is due in part to homesickness and also to a conflict
over a 'skull and bones' affair, the facts of which I
have not as yet definitely ascertained." Dr. Poli
kofT was referring to the Jolly Roger which some
childish emotionalists at Toyon Hew in protest to
the ISC which was voted in at the last campus
ballot.
The flag was captured by freshmen and displayed
at the class of '50 dance. Dr. PolikofT reprimanded
the Encina men for this in saying that it is often
dangerous to expose such childish actions as it usually
drives the patient further into his ntental reclusion.
Recent events bear out Dr. Polikoff's statement.
Toyon men, to further satisfy their childish
whims, found it necessary to recapture the flag, but
because of threats on the part of Encina, the flag
has not been flown by the light of day. Dr. PolikofT
explained that such emotional disturbances stem

from early childhood frustrations, and they have been
termed by him as adult-adolescent neurosis. He
stated that the selection of the Jolly Roger commonly
associated in the 10-year-old mind with pirates and
kidnappers shows a definite recessive mentality.
Dr. PolikofT explained that the Toyon men had
been frustrated and hurt by the rough threats issued
from Encina. In response to his appeal on behalf of
the emotionally upset Toyon men and the dire con
sequences he predicted from their psychological
deficiency, freshmen have agreed to the following
terms: Toyon need not fear the consequences of
flying their flag by the linht of day; (Dr. PolikofT
added that adult treatment of the patient is often
beneficial in such cases) Toyon men no longer have
to dofl their berets to freshmen; Toyon men may use
the sidewalks adjacent to Encina; Toyon men may
now speak quietly at meals in Encina Commons as
long as the topic of conversation is maintained on a
high moral level in keeping with Encina standards;
and finally any freshman who speaks unkindly to a
Toyon man will be made to apologize and send
little candies for reparation.

childish behavior of our neighbors, the residents of
Toyon Hall, we have solicited the opinion of Dr.
Pierre PolikofT, celebrated Russian psychiatrist, and
herein present it to the Stanford campus as a whole.
'"It is true," said Dr. PolikofT, "that most Toyon
men cry themselves to sleep at night. This situation
is due in part to homesickness and also to a conflict
over a 'skull and bones' affair, the facts of which I
have not as yet definitely ascertained." Dr. Poli
kofT was referring to the Jolly Roger which some
childish emotionalists at Toyon Hew in protest to
the ISC which was voted in at the last campus
ballot.
The flag was captured by freshmen and displayed
at the class of '50 dance. Dr. PolikofT reprimanded
the Encina men for this in saying that it is often
dangerous to expose such childish actions as it usually
drives the patient further into his ntental reclusion.
Recent events bear out Dr. Polikoff's statement.
Toyon men, to further satisfy their childish
whims, found it necessary to recapture the flag, but
because of threats on the part of Encina, the flag
has not been flown by the light of day. Dr. PolikofT
explained that such emotional disturbances stem

from early childhood frustrations, and they have been
termed by him as adult-adolescent neurosis. He
stated that the selection of the Jolly Roger commonly
associated in the 10-year-old mind with pirates and
kidnappers shows a definite recessive mentality.
Dr. PolikofT explained that the Toyon men had
been frustrated and hurt by the rough threats issued
from Encina. In response to his appeal on behalf of
the emotionally upset Toyon men and the dire con
sequences he predicted from their psychological
deficiency, freshmen have agreed to the following
terms: Toyon need not fear the consequences of
flying their flag by the linht of day; (Dr. PolikofT
added that adult treatment of the patient is often
beneficial in such cases) Toyon men no longer have
to dofl their berets to freshmen; Toyon men may use
the sidewalks adjacent to Encina; Toyon men may
now speak quietly at meals in Encina Commons as
long as the topic of conversation is maintained on a
high moral level in keeping with Encina standards;
and finally any freshman who speaks unkindly to a
Toyon man will be made to apologize and send
little candies for reparation.
