# Duesenberg Speeder Slowed by Bad Tires
## 
### JOHN TURNBLAD 
Fourteen thousand dollars of cylinders, gears, springs, upholstery, and
various other miscellaneous bits of machinery put together by the best
automotive engineers of the country—yet this deluxe automobile can't
travel more than a few miles a day.
That's the predicament Anthony Alexander of Toyon finds himself in

Alexander is the fellow you've seen
rolling around the campus in the
long black touring car that looks as
though it belonged in the gangster
movies of the 1930'5.
"Although the car—a 1937 Due
senberg—is as good mechanically as
a new model, the tires are almost
worn out," said Alexander. "So I
don't dare drive it more than a few
miles around the campus every
day."
Explaining some of the wonders
of his automobile, Alexander said
the Duesenberg has twice as many
cylinders as an ordinary car, devel
ops 300 horsepower, and will go
about 125 miles an hour. Inciden
tally, the cylinder walls are all
chrome-plated, he added.
"Only about 2,000 Ducsenbergs
were made in 1937," Alexander
continued, "and 100 were shipped to
California from the factory in In
diana. Most of them went to char
acters in Los Angeles, although
there Ls one fellow up in Woodside
who has four of them sitting on
blocks in his garage."
Duesenberg quit making cars in
1937, said Alexander. Those built
before the factory closed were prac
tically custom made. Prices ranged
from $14,000 to $50,000.
"There's one thing I have discov
ered since I got the Duesenberg,"
said Alexander. "Although my car
has extra-heavy springs and can go
over ordinary bumps with hardly a
jolt, I get a real shaking-up on these
campus roads. No matter what
you're riding in, Palm Drive is still
the worst road in Palo Alto."
