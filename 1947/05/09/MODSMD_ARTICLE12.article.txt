# Don't Waste Good Firemen

### 
During the past few nights the Stanford Fire Department has
! been plagued with a series of small fires.
These fires have apparently not been of accidental origin.
When putting out these fires the Fire Department is forced
to move its eguipment about the campus at a speed which makes
the possibility of an accident highly probable.
It leaves the Fire Department undermanned in case a fire
occurs in a living group. Wednesday night the multiple fires left
j the Fire House with only one man standing by for emergency
I calls.
Those who have lived in this area realize that fires once out
| of control will spread over a large area before being put out.
If these fires continue eventually someone will be injured by
the fire trucks or equipment; extensive damage will occui to
property due to the unavailability of the equipment; or the small
j fires will got out of hand and cause irreparable loss to property.
When that happens, new restrictive measures will be en
j forced, and the responsible persons will be apprehended and
punished.
As Fire Chief John Marston says,"The boys have had their
I fun—let's stop this playing before someone gets injured."G.C.
