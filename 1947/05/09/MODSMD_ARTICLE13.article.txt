# Tickets for 'It's a Deal' Go on Sale Next Week
## 
### 
Tickets for "It's a Deal!," Ram's Head's Spring Show next Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, will sell Monday and every day next week from
8 a.m. tf> 5 p.m. at the Engineering corner, according to George Eckstein,
production manager. They cost $1.25, 85 cents, and 55 cents. "We are try
ing to do something this year which has been attempted before, but never

with notable success," said Harry
Muheim, playwright, speaking of
the all-student talent. "If rehear
sals continue as successfully as they
have so far, we feel Stanford audi
ences will want to revive the tra
dition of student work for student
shows."
" 'It's a Deal!' provides a musical
variety," he said, "ranging all the
way from a sock number 'Whatever
It Is, I've Got It' which should
please the most avid Stan Kenton
fans to 'Gee, But It's Nice in Ver
mont' done in Viennese tempo."
Tabbed as a favorite is Art Sha
piro's somewhat broad interpreta
tion of a musical question on in
comeâ€”"money, that is," explained
Muheim.
Two of the show's 14 songs by F.
M. Scott 111 tell of men who rise
arainst great odds, and the use of
plastics in the glittering post-war
world. "As a matter of fact," said
Muheim, "it may be just what Al
dous Huxley had in mind."
