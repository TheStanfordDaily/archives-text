# Players Present Satre's 'No Exit'
## 
### 
Stanford's Experimental Theater
will present Jean-Paul Satre's cx
istentialistic drama "No Exit" to
morrow night at 8:15 in the Little
Theater. Tickets are on sale for 60
cents in room 202, Memorial Hall.
Call PA 22041 for reservations.
The cast includes Beatrice Man
ley, Elaine Maltzmann, Kenneth
Jones, and Bill Vorenborg, who will
depict characters who have died and
are in hell. "No Exit" is directed
by George Nichols 111, who received
his Master's degree from the Yale
School of Drama.
Tomorrow's performance marks
the initial amateur and West Coast
production of this play. It was first
given in Paris about a month before
D-day {:nd continued its run for
two years. Recently it has been
seen in New York and London.
The New York Drama Critics'
Circle awarded it the piize as the
best foreign play of the season.
Brooks Atkinson of the New York
Times felt that the selection of "No
Exit" was particularly satisfactory
inasmuch as the reception of the
play in New York did not, he be
lieved, do justice to its merits.
"No Exit" deals with the inner
nature and fate of the individual, a
philosophy founded by Satre. It is
the first in a series of extra per
formances of an experimental na
ture which the Stanford Experi
mental Theater plans in the future.
