# Village 'Little Women Discuss Apartment Life
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Every other Tuesday evening a handful of the busiest, hardest-working
women on the Farm meet in the Village Resident Counselor's office for a
.session of the Family Council presided over by Mis. Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson.
After washing up supper dishes, the little women join the Council

round - table where neighborhood
Ifousehold problems are ironed out
to make the apartment life more
comfortable.
PROBLEMS SOLVED
"Organized as a clearing house for
problems and improvement sugges
tions," Mrs. Cuthbertson said, "our
Family Council representatives seek
to iron out rough edges of the new
apartments occupied by 300 fami
lies.
Before long, she said, the need for
a Family Council may be unneces
sary. "So far we have had fences
put around back yards to keep the
children from wandering, obtained
community garden space and gar
den tools to grow our own vege
tables, and received baby furniture
and clothing from the Stanford
Mothers' Club for Village tots."
Village apartments form a horse
shoe "U" around backyard gardens
and clotheslines. From family
apartments opening out into these
backyard clothesline areas, dele
gates are chosen to represent their
living areas on the Council.
GROCERY PLANNED
Major business on the Council's
agenda now is starting a grocery
store and the children's play school.
To save inconvenient trips into
Menlo Park, the Council is arrang
ing to have a grocery store conces
sion installed in the apartment area
for use by all Village residents. A
co-op type store has been discour
aged because of the large turnover
of families each quarter.
If a Village grocery concession
goes in, the families look forward to
reasonable prices that will make
more expensive M?nlo grocery buy
ing unnecessary.
SCHOOL TO OPEN
On the play school question, the
Council hopes to have a building
opened by this summer for pre
school children two to six years old.
Fifty children in that age bracket
now living at the Village would
receive play instruction by Stanford
psychology and education students
on a large variety of play toys al
ready in the Village storehouse.
"II only we could induce more
husbands to come to the Council
meetings," said Mrs. Cuthbertson, a
former ASSU vice - president in
HMO, "our representation could be
complete. But then who would
watch the children?"
