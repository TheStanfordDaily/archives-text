# Encina Telephones Still 'On the Blink'
## 
### 
Encina men still have only three
local phones in operation, and until
the phone strike is ended, they will
be forced to use pay phones or
continue to stand in line at the few
remaining local booths.
Investigators have been appointed
in each wing in an attempt to track
down the persons responsible for
the vandalism, but so far nothing
has been accomplished.
"Thirteen receivers were severed
in all," Encina president Paul Ell
wood said yesterday."The only
way that we can get them replaced
during the phone strike is to hire
executive help at $7 an hour."
Payment for replacement of the
receivers will be deducted from the
Encina social fund, he said.
