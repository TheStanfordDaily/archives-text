# Indian Baseballers Seek Revenge Against Bears
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Coach Harry Wolter's high-flying Indians, who've chalked up
ten victories in their last 11 starts, get another chance to clip the
Bear tail tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 when they play host to the
invading C.1.8.A. loop leaders on the Sunken Diamond.
The Jayvees will also see action tomorrow, for they will be

seeking revenge for a 4 to 0 defeat
the Bear second team gave them last
month. The junior varsity game will
he played on the frosh field.
Last time, California barely staved
off a last-inning rally to nose out
the Indians, 3 to 2, and tomorrow
the Farm boys are hoping to turn the
tables in convincing fashion.
WOLTERS: EVEN CHANCE
Walter figures the Indians as rating
at least an even chance in the Big
Game—and the last time he said
that, before the Southern California
game two weeks ago, the Indians
stepped out and humbled the then
league leading Trojans by a 6 to 5
score.
At any rate, the Cardinals are
expecting to give the Bears an
other tough battle, with the out
come depending on the breaks of
the game—and how many the In
dians can make for themselves.
Dave Stott, who handcuffed the
Cal sluggers with five hits in the
first game, may return to the mound
Saturday to seek his third straight
loop victory—and again he might not.
MAY SHIFT LINEUP
For with two other standout
pitchers on the club—Dave Dahle
and Larry Wolf—Wolter is faced with
an eeny-meeny-miney-moe situa
tion as to who will start. It is defin
itely one of the three named, but
"which one?" is a question which
might not be answered until game
lime.
The Cardinals may shift their line
up around a bit before the game,
but that's another "maybee." The
shift which may be employed is the
one which sends Ted Nell to second
base and puts Clyde Dingfelder in
to Nell's vacated right field slot.
Except for that possible switch,
Wolter expects to send the same line
up into action which has been func
tioning so well during the spring
quarter. Ward Walkup, who rates
as one of the loop's top receivers,
will be behind the plate for the
Farm.
Ben Cardinalli will be on first,
Buck Brownson at short, and Bill
Arce at third, with George Sloat and
Lloyd Merriman operating the out
field posts. Bob Peters may play
second.
FARM STRATEGY
If the Bears shoot a southpaw, in
thp person of Virgil Butler, at the
Indians tomorrow, the Farm coach
will definitely go through with his
•lineup change.
If Nino Barnise, the Bear's ace
hurler who has been having trouble
lately, starts tomorrow, the Indians
may not change their lineup. Last
time, the Farm boys hit nine base
blows off Barnise.
In the big bats of Cliff McClain,

Jim Fiscalini and Clyde Dufour, the
Bears have batting punch which
has pulverized Coast hurling this
spring.
BEAKS WIN CLOSE ONE
Even so, the Bears have been
hard-put to win quite a few of
! their games, and have staggered
through more than their share of
t one-run, late-inning decisions.
Jim McCreight handles the catch
ing duties for the Bears, to round out
the fourth corner of a diamond which
is filled by capable men. Bob O'Dell
is at first, freshman Jim Cronin 1
moves around second, Jimmy Brown
holds down short, and Dufour ban- i
dies Ihe hot corner.
McClain, who hit the right-field
wall with a triple last month, against
the Indians, plays right field, with
Fiscalini and Lyle Palmer playing
the other two outfield positions.

pitchers on the club—Dave Dahle
and Larry Wolf—Wolter is faced with
an eeny-meeny-miney-moe situa
tion as to who will start. It is defin
itely one of the three named, but
"which one?" is a question which
might not be answered until game
lime.
The Cardinals may shift their line
up around a bit before the game,
but that's another "maybee." The
shift which may be employed is the
one which sends Ted Nell to second
base and puts Clyde Dingfelder in
to Nell's vacated right field slot.
Except for that possible switch,
Wolter expects to send the same line
up into action which has been func
tioning so well during the spring
quarter. Ward Walkup, who rates
as one of the loop's top receivers,
will be behind the plate for the
Farm.
Ben Cardinalli will be on first,
Buck Brownson at short, and Bill
Arce at third, with George Sloat and
Lloyd Merriman operating the out
field posts. Bob Peters may play
second.
FARM STRATEGY
If the Bears shoot a southpaw, in
thp person of Virgil Butler, at the
Indians tomorrow, the Farm coach
will definitely go through with his
•lineup change.
If Nino Barnise, the Bear's ace
hurler who has been having trouble
lately, starts tomorrow, the Indians
may not change their lineup. Last
time, the Farm boys hit nine base
blows off Barnise.
In the big bats of Cliff McClain,

Jim Fiscalini and Clyde Dufour, the
Bears have batting punch which
has pulverized Coast hurling this
spring.
BEAKS WIN CLOSE ONE
Even so, the Bears have been
hard-put to win quite a few of
! their games, and have staggered
through more than their share of
t one-run, late-inning decisions.
Jim McCreight handles the catch
ing duties for the Bears, to round out
the fourth corner of a diamond which
is filled by capable men. Bob O'Dell
is at first, freshman Jim Cronin 1
moves around second, Jimmy Brown
holds down short, and Dufour ban- i
dies Ihe hot corner.
McClain, who hit the right-field
wall with a triple last month, against
the Indians, plays right field, with
Fiscalini and Lyle Palmer playing
the other two outfield positions.
Coach Harry Wolter's high-flying Indians, who've chalked up
ten victories in their last 11 starts, get another chance to clip the
Bear tail tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 when they play host to the
invading C.1.8.A. loop leaders on the Sunken Diamond.
The Jayvees will also see action tomorrow, for they will be

seeking revenge for a 4 to 0 defeat
the Bear second team gave them last
month. The junior varsity game will
he played on the frosh field.
Last time, California barely staved
off a last-inning rally to nose out
the Indians, 3 to 2, and tomorrow
the Farm boys are hoping to turn the
tables in convincing fashion.
WOLTERS: EVEN CHANCE
Walter figures the Indians as rating
at least an even chance in the Big
Game—and the last time he said
that, before the Southern California
game two weeks ago, the Indians
stepped out and humbled the then
league leading Trojans by a 6 to 5
score.
At any rate, the Cardinals are
expecting to give the Bears an
other tough battle, with the out
come depending on the breaks of
the game—and how many the In
dians can make for themselves.
Dave Stott, who handcuffed the
Cal sluggers with five hits in the
first game, may return to the mound
Saturday to seek his third straight
loop victory—and again he might not.
