# Swimmers Meet Troy
## 
### 
With their sights set on a number
of Pacific Coast Conference, National
Intercollegiate, and American 20-
yard pool marks, Stanford's varsity
swimmers will take to the Encina
Pools tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
to defend their 20 dual meet win
string against a strong swimming
aggregation from the University of
Southern California.
COULD PROVE TOUGH
Although the USC swimmers are
given only an outside chance to
take a team victory back to the
Figueroa Street campus, it is rec
ognized that Trojan Coach Fred
Cady will bring north several out
standing swimmers who are capa
ble of upsetting the dope bucket in
individual races. Leading Troy
improving rapidly in recent weeks,
may give serious competition to
Stanford's Weeden Brothers in the
150-yard backstroke race, and to
Farm sprinters Woody Hoogs and
Wan-pn Cutting in the 50-yard free
style evrnt.
Bob Anderson will find a tough
100-yard freestyle competitor in
Trojan swimming captain Don
Hughes. Anderson, who holds the
present su-yard freestyle mark will
stay out of the shorter race in order
to try to heat the National Intercol
legiate mark of 51.4 which is now
held by Ed Kirar of Michigan.
TROJfcN TOP DIVER
Top place in the diving competition
must be awarded to Trojan Tom
Harabedian although Stanford diver
Lo'iis Fentnor showed great im
pro\ ement in taking second against
Cal last Saturday.
Stanford's 300-yard medley relay
team of A 1 Weeden, Em Cashin, and
Bob Anderson will go after a new
American, National Intercollegiate,
and Pacific Coast Conference mark
in that event. This medley trio
clipped a tenth of a second off the
American 150-yard medley mark in
an exhibition at the Olympic Club
meet several weeks ago.
A string of meet and P.C.C. 20-
yard-pool records should fall. One
of the Weedens is almost ce* lain to
erase the old 150-yard ba.'kstroke
record for a 20-yard pool. Last Sat
urday, Brother A 1 chopped two and
two-tenths seconds off the old 25-
yard-pool P.C.C. mark of 1:39.2.
SHOULD BETTER RECORD
Stanford breaststroker Don Hes
ter, who also set a new P.C.C. mark
in his specialty last week, is fav
ored to better the 200-yard record
for the short pool. Stanfordites Mar
tin Vitousek, and Klas 80l will bat
tle with Trojan Harry Messenheimer
for second and third places in this
event.
The freestyle quartet of Dick Nar
ver, Em Cashin, Rey Rule, and Bob
Anderson is a strong choice to set a
new P.C.C. record in the 400-yard
relay, and could better the National
20-yard-pool mark.
