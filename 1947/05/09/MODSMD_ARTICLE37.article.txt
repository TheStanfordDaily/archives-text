# Netmen Play O.C. Team
## 
### 
Hoping to get back on the vic
tory trail after last week's heart
breaking loss to California, Stan
ford's tennis varsity meets the
Olympic Club on the local courts
tomorrow. First matches get under
way at 1:30 p.m.
Meanwhile, the sensational jun
ior varsity Indians will furnish ten
nis activity this afternoon when they
play San Francisco Junior College.
Stanford is favored in today's clash,
which starts at 2:30 p.m.
INDIANS UNDERDOGS
The varsity, on the other hand,
enters tomorrow's battle with the
Olympic Club with no more than an
even chance to win. Experience
versus youthful determination will
be the menu, as the Winged "O"
team is made up of veteran racquet
wielders.
Larry Dee, who won net honors
on the Farm in 1942, is seeded num
ber one on the Olympic Club team.
His homecoming day celebration
may not come off, if Bob Lewis of
the Tribe can stop him.
Lewis has developed rapidly dur
ing his two weeks as number one
man on the Indian varsity. Last
Saturday, he proved his skill by de
feating California's ace netter in the
feature match. Lewis should give
Dee quite an argument tomorrow.
Today's match between the once
beaten Indian JV's and San Fran
cisco Junior College has been tab
bed as a breeze for the strong local
outfit. Tom Huffman will play first
singles against the notoriously weak
S.F. entry.
