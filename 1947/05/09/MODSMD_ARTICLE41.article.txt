# Crew Pointing For Cal Race
## 
### 
The Stanford Crew's three shells
are working out at the Paly harbor
daily in preparation for their meet
with California next Saturday, May
17. The races, to be run over the
two-mile Oakland Estuary course,
will pit Varsity, Junior Varsity,
and Freshman shells of the arch
rivals against each other.
CAL WORKS OUT
Across the bay, Cal's perennially
strong Golden Bears had a turnout
of 160 rowing aspirants. Ky Ebright's
charges, now boiled down to a work
able size, have been rowing 40 miles
per week in prepping for the Big
Race. Tomorrow the Bears get their
first real test in four years when
they play host to the Bruins on the
Oakland Estuary.
Meanwhile, the orphaned oars
men continue to work out over the
Paly Harbor course. Last week the
Indians' sessions emphasized condi
tioning and long distance rowing.
