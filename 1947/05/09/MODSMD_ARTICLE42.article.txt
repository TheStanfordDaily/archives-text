### 
Two undefeated intramural soft-
I ball teams met yesterday for the an
j ticipated pitching duel between Fred
Smith of Phi Kappa and Fiji's John
, Muir.
However, Vance Sheffer of Fiji
garnered first base on an error in
j the first half of the sixth inning.
Then trying to stretch it to third
| on hero-yof-the-day Muir's bingle
I into center field, he came on home
I with the lone, winning run on an
overthrow at third. Phi Kappa left
the field trailing by a 1-0 final score.
The Firehouse rolled out its big
j gesl hoses to swamp the A.T.O. ball
! club, and remained among the ranks
i of the season's undefeated teams by
winning easily, 11-0. Firehouse fast
ball artist Ned Wolfai'th pitched a
! no-hit performance for the winners,
whiffing 16 opposing batters in the
process.
Phi Sigma and Sigma Nu battled
it out for seven innings with one
run scored apiece. In the eighth and
last inning, however, Sigma Nu col
lected enough hits from pitcher Sam
Chaney to push across another run
â–  and break up the game, 2-1.
