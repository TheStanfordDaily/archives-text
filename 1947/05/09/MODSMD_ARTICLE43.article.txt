# Trackmen See Action
## Stanford Host In Triangular 
### TOM BURDICK 
Los Angeles Athletic Club's
Mercurymen, composed of
former collegiate stars the coun
try over, have currently been
installed the favorite to turn
back the best (hat Stanford and the
San Francisco Olympic Club can
offer in tomorrow's triangular
track and field outing at Angell
Field. The winged "O" Olympic
flyers could easily surprise, how
ever, and are definitely conceded
the second spot, trailed by the host
entry. Starting time for the field
events will be 1:45 with the open
ing mile slated for 2. Admission will
be free to Stanford students with
the presentation of student body
cards.
Despite the fact that the South
erners have no entries in the mile,
880, two-mile, or broad jump, con
centrated strength in the weights,
•140. and sprints is expected to carry
them through. Especially productive
should be the quartermile, where
the Mercurymen are tabbed for the
first three places.
COCIIItAN STARS
Roy Cochran, former Indiana
flash, tops the list with Johnny
Wachtler, ex-Trojan, and Ken
Schauer, current Cal Tech sensa
tion close on his heels. One of the
fastest mile relays of the season
should be in the offing when Cliff
Bourland, former USC great, joins
the above-mentioned threesome.
The weight events may well pro
duce some of the best marks of the
year and it looks like a toss-up be
tween the Angelenos and the Olym
pic Club for honors. Martin Biles,
former Cal great, has a mark of 215
feet in the javelin this season but is
forced to take a back seat to LAAC's
Steve Seymour who has him beat by
three inches.
Wilbur "Moose" Thompson has a
'"best" of 53 ft. 9 in. but is expected
to be closely pressed by his team
mate A 1 Hershey, and Olympian
Jim Dclaney. In the pole vault, six
entries alone have cleared 13 ft. 6 in.
and three of the Winged "O" have
cleared the 14 ft. marker.
FARM HAS DASHES
Terry Maxwell, the Farm's best
sprinter, is expected to cut into the
Angelenos' points in the dashes,
while the mile and half-mile duels
between the Olympic Club's "Mushy"
Girard and Bob Lehman and Stan
ford's Frank Ganahl and George
Grimes should provide the top
i"aces.

and three of the Winged "O" have
cleared the 14 ft. marker.
FARM HAS DASHES
Terry Maxwell, the Farm's best
sprinter, is expected to cut into the
Angelenos' points in the dashes,
while the mile and half-mile duels
between the Olympic Club's "Mushy"
Girard and Bob Lehman and Stan
ford's Frank Ganahl and George
Grimes should provide the top
i"aces.
Los Angeles Athletic Club's
Mercurymen, composed of
former collegiate stars the coun
try over, have currently been
installed the favorite to turn
back the best (hat Stanford and the
San Francisco Olympic Club can
offer in tomorrow's triangular
track and field outing at Angell
Field. The winged "O" Olympic
flyers could easily surprise, how
ever, and are definitely conceded
the second spot, trailed by the host
entry. Starting time for the field
events will be 1:45 with the open
ing mile slated for 2. Admission will
be free to Stanford students with
the presentation of student body
cards.
Despite the fact that the South
erners have no entries in the mile,
880, two-mile, or broad jump, con
centrated strength in the weights,
•140. and sprints is expected to carry
them through. Especially productive
should be the quartermile, where
the Mercurymen are tabbed for the
first three places.
COCIIItAN STARS
Roy Cochran, former Indiana
flash, tops the list with Johnny
Wachtler, ex-Trojan, and Ken
Schauer, current Cal Tech sensa
tion close on his heels. One of the
fastest mile relays of the season
should be in the offing when Cliff
Bourland, former USC great, joins
the above-mentioned threesome.
The weight events may well pro
duce some of the best marks of the
year and it looks like a toss-up be
tween the Angelenos and the Olym
pic Club for honors. Martin Biles,
former Cal great, has a mark of 215
feet in the javelin this season but is
forced to take a back seat to LAAC's
Steve Seymour who has him beat by
three inches.
Wilbur "Moose" Thompson has a
'"best" of 53 ft. 9 in. but is expected
to be closely pressed by his team
mate A 1 Hershey, and Olympian
Jim Dclaney. In the pole vault, six
entries alone have cleared 13 ft. 6 in.
and three of the Winged "O" have
cleared the 14 ft. marker.
