## A 						Challenge to Thinking Persons 
### 
An address this afternoon at 4:15 will open
Stanford's first Conference on International
Relations, a series of lectures and seminars
scheduled for today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
The Conference is student planned and or
ganized, and is for the Stanford student body.
Since the war most students on campus,
particularly the veterans, have professed deep
concern over decisions being made through
out the world today. Each of these decisions,
directly or indirectly, will eventually concern
and influence your life and mine.
It is the realization of this that will make
the Conference of immediate interest to every
person.
World problems and solutions to them can
hardly be shrugged off with the expressed
"thought" of "I've got too many problems of
my own without worrying about problems
over which I have no influence.
An attitude such as this is exactly the type
of thinking which permitted the conditions
responsible for the recent war.
It should hardly be necessary to point out
that very little happens throughout the world
that is not motivated by individuals or groups
of individuals acting together.
This is something which most persons seem
to prefer to temporarily forget because of
"inconvenient" responsibility which it places
on them.
"The Individual's Responsibility for Peace"
is the topic with which Professor Harry Rath
bun will close the Conference on Sunday.
It should be of particular interest to every
one, for all the knowledge and facts and de
sires which a person can possess about world
events means nothing unless that person is
willing to devote time and energy in execut
ing his responsibility toward aiding peace.
