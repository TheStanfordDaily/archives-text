# America's World Position
## 
### 
What is America's position in the world
today? This is a thought-provoking question
that to answer would require vast knowledge
of the history of our country, our economic
and political strength today, and the position
of other nations in relation to us. The ques
tion is the title of one of the topics to be dis
cussed at our Conference on International
Relations this weekend.
Our foreign policy is based upon our posi
tion in the world. This policy consists of such
things as relief and loans to foreign countries,
an encouragement of imports into this country
in an attempt to correct our imbalance of ex
ports, and participating in the International
Trade Organization conference at Geneva to
work out multi-lateral trade agreements and
lower tariffs all over the world.
It also consists of working out peace trea
ties and reparations for defeated countries
that will be acceptable to all nations; support
ing and working through a world organization,
but at the same time playing firm with coun
tries having an aggressive foreign policy like
Russia; and spreading democratic forms of
government throughout the world.
The basis for these policies, our position in
the world, is not something that can be
learned in a short time, nor is it one that is

agreed upon, as evidenced from the numer
ous debates on foreign policy questions in
Congress. But to hear well-qualified educat
ors like Mr. Kreps, Mr. Fagan, and Mr. Thomas
speak on the subject and answer questions,
will give you some insight into the stories
that make the headlines day after day.N.B.
