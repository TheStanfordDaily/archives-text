# European Conflicts
## 
### 
The past two wars which have confronted
the world have both originated in Europe.
If the world is to face another war it may
well be that the seeds are now being sown
in that continent.
Approaching the subject from a more posi
tive side, if the threat of war is to be elimin
inated we should concentrate our efforts on
Europe for it is their conflicts that touch off
the conflicts of the world.
Four professors familiar with the European
scene will conduct a round table discussion
tonight. Their subject is "Conflict in Europe."
The greater our familiarity with Europe the
greater are our chances of understanding and
eliminating these conflicts. These discussions
will give Stanford students the opportunity to
ask the questions which they consider un
answered in their minds. They will be able
to secure information that is unavailable to
them in their stereotyped classroom lectures.
It is an opportunity to which one should
give some thought.—G.C.
