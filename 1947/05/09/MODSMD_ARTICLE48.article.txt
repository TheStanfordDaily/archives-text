# Russia's World Position
## 
### 
Tonight at 7 Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman
of the Hoover Institute and Library will pre
sent a talk on "Russia's Position in the World
Today" in conjunction with Stanford's Inter
national Conference.
The theme of the conference will be cen
tered around Russo-American relations. It is
obvious, from the news coming out of the
recent Foreign Ministers' Conference in Mos
cow and from the UN assembly meetings that
an understanding of the policies of these two
powers is important to the understanding of
present problems of setting up a permanent
peace.
Disagreements over the governing of Ger
many and Korea, over the question of atomic
control, and over the UN veto problem, are
a few of the main difficulties that have arisen
in the relations of Russia and the United
States.
Dr. Fisher plans to emphasize two aspects
of Russia today: Her position as a great power
and her position as a revolutionary power. It
is a known fact that Russia is strong econ
omically and socially. But how strong and
how will this strength affect the unity of the
United Nations?
Prevention of the further spread of Com
munism throughout the world is the cause of
present Congressional legislation concerning
aid to Greece and Turkey.
The subject of Dr. Fisher's talk should be
invaluable in helping students to understand
the Russian situation and to comprehend the
problems faced by our State Department and
the UN.â€”M.S.
