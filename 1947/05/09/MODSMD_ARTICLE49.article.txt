### TED NORTON 
This* weekend will see at Stanford a Conference
on International Relations. You have doubtless seen
the news items about the Conference in recent and
today's Daily, which give the program, speakers and
topics, in detail. But let me here emphasize two of
the topics to be discussed which I consider to be of
major importance.
The first is offered at one o'clock Saturday af
ternoon; Claude A. Buss will discuss "Conflicts in
the Far East." At two o'clock, immediately follow
ing, Wayne S. Vucinich will discuss "Conflicts in the
Near East."
Both of the speakers are members of the history
faculty here, but the word "conflict" need not be
taken in any academic sense. In China, Indo-China,
Java, actual armed conflict is a fact. In Palestine,
warfare is hardly less open. India perches continually
on the verge of riot and civil commotion, and slips
over that edge on almost any provocation. The com
petition, scarcely veiled or not veiled at all, of Rus
sia, the United States, and the European nations,
for influence, resources, strategic positions is obvious.
Russia occupies the northern half of Asia, and most of
the southern half is either subject to or controlled by
the so-called "Western Bloc." Korea, Turkey, the
Arab states all exemplify conflict in this sense.
There may be those on the campus, even at this
late date, who fail to see that these conflicts are any
concern of the United States. Certainly the easy,

comfortable doctrine is that they are not; it is that
we should abstain, withdraw, avoid foreign entang
lements, be "practical" and "businesslike." Isolation
ism has always been attractive to Americans. The
best answer I can give to these purplind individuals is
that isolationism is, looking at the events of the past
40 years and being as practical and business-like as
I can, a complete failure. Twice we have attempted
to keep ourselves to ourselves; twice we have been
drawn into bloody and inconclusive war. It may
not be far from the truth to say that our attempt to
isolate ourselves from conflict in distant places has
contributed directly to the results that have cost
us so dear. And the distant places arc no longer so
distant.
Let us face facts. This is one world, a small
world, an interdependent world. Conflict in Asia—
and the conflicts are by no means confined to Asia—
is the concern of America as a forest fire in Shasta
National Forest is the concern of Trinity National
Forest. These conflicts exist. Unless we individually
can understand and evaluate them, we are liable
to get burned—again. Anyone at Stanford who fails
to make some effort to understand has failed to do his
duty as a citizen of the United States and of the
world.
And probably the least painful approach to some
measure of understanding would be to attend the
sessions, or at least some of them, in the Cubbcrley
Auditorium today, tomorrow, and Sunday.

for influence, resources, strategic positions is obvious.
Russia occupies the northern half of Asia, and most of
the southern half is either subject to or controlled by
the so-called "Western Bloc." Korea, Turkey, the
Arab states all exemplify conflict in this sense.
There may be those on the campus, even at this
late date, who fail to see that these conflicts are any
concern of the United States. Certainly the easy,

comfortable doctrine is that they are not; it is that
we should abstain, withdraw, avoid foreign entang
lements, be "practical" and "businesslike." Isolation
ism has always been attractive to Americans. The
best answer I can give to these purplind individuals is
that isolationism is, looking at the events of the past
40 years and being as practical and business-like as
I can, a complete failure. Twice we have attempted
to keep ourselves to ourselves; twice we have been
drawn into bloody and inconclusive war. It may
not be far from the truth to say that our attempt to
isolate ourselves from conflict in distant places has
contributed directly to the results that have cost
us so dear. And the distant places arc no longer so
distant.
Let us face facts. This is one world, a small
world, an interdependent world. Conflict in Asia—
and the conflicts are by no means confined to Asia—
is the concern of America as a forest fire in Shasta
National Forest is the concern of Trinity National
Forest. These conflicts exist. Unless we individually
can understand and evaluate them, we are liable
to get burned—again. Anyone at Stanford who fails
to make some effort to understand has failed to do his
duty as a citizen of the United States and of the
world.
And probably the least painful approach to some
measure of understanding would be to attend the
sessions, or at least some of them, in the Cubbcrley
Auditorium today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
This* weekend will see at Stanford a Conference
on International Relations. You have doubtless seen
the news items about the Conference in recent and
today's Daily, which give the program, speakers and
topics, in detail. But let me here emphasize two of
the topics to be discussed which I consider to be of
major importance.
The first is offered at one o'clock Saturday af
ternoon; Claude A. Buss will discuss "Conflicts in
the Far East." At two o'clock, immediately follow
ing, Wayne S. Vucinich will discuss "Conflicts in the
Near East."
Both of the speakers are members of the history
faculty here, but the word "conflict" need not be
taken in any academic sense. In China, Indo-China,
Java, actual armed conflict is a fact. In Palestine,
warfare is hardly less open. India perches continually
on the verge of riot and civil commotion, and slips
over that edge on almost any provocation. The com
petition, scarcely veiled or not veiled at all, of Rus
sia, the United States, and the European nations,
for influence, resources, strategic positions is obvious.
