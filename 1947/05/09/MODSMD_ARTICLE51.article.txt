## 
### 
Funeral services are being ar
ranged today for John Edward Wal
ter Ding, 27, Chinese - American
Stanford sophomore, who was found
yesterday in the wreckage of a car
at the bottom of a cliff on the Klam
ath Highway near Eureka.
Ding, a pre-med student, entered
Stanford in 1943 from San Mateo
Junior College, making an excellent
record in the Far Eastern language
division of the Army Foreign Area
Language program. He returned to
Stanford in the fall of 194G.
Ding served as a first lieutenant
in the Army Intelligence corps dur
ing World War 11. He was a former
scoutmaster in San Francisco.
The Stanford student had been
missing since spring vacation. The
Dean of Students' office reported
that Ding had left for a skiing trip
in Oregon upon completion of his
winter quarter examinations. The
only word received from him since
that time had been a postcard ad
dressed to a student friend.
When Ding failed to pick up his
room reservation at Toyon at the
start of spring quarter, University
authorities notified his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. C. S. Ding, 3305 Mission
Street, San Francisco.
Charles Raab, Humboldt County
sheriff, reported to Stanford Police
Chief Gordon Davis the discovery
of Ding's body at the base of the
cliff. Henry Beck, highway main
tenance worker, spotted the wreck
age.
Sheriff Raab identified Ding from
papers found at the scene of the
accident. At first it was feared that
another Stanford student might
have died in the wreck with Ding.
Oscar O. Ortiz, lower division stu
dent, later explained that papers
bearing his name found in the car
had been loaned to Ding while they
were studying together in a chem
istry course.
