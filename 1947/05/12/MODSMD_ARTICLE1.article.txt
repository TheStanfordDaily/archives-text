# Western Phone Strike Off; NFTW Holds Out
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11 (UP).—Officials of the CIO Ameri
can Communications Associations today threw in the towel in the
Far Western telephone fight with an announcement that they
consider "the strike is broken" and will order their members to
return to work at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.
Despite the ACA's action, the NFTW today clung stubbornly

to its demands as a lone holdout
against final settlement of the West
ern States phase of the strike.
Although it has not been actively
on strike, the powerful ACA has
given the striking telephone unions
its full support by refusing 100 per
cent to cross telephone picket lines in
the five Western states.
ACA members include 12,000 oper
ators in Northern California and
Nevada, 750 highly skilled toll test
board technicians in the five-state
area, 500 central office technicians in
Los Angeles and 400 accounting em
ployes in Washington and Idaho.
UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER
"On the Pacific Coast NFT W nego
tiations have completely broken
down," the ACA announcement said.
"The United Brotherhood of Tele
phone Workers signed an agreement
Saturday with the company, sur
rendering unconditionally and ac
cepting the company's odious clausc
permitting discrimination against its
own membership. The Federation
of Women Telephone Workers in
Southern California did likewise.
"These events, plus lack of any
plan by NFTW for effective action
to protect its members and strike
supporters against discrimination by
the company, mean that the strike
on the Pacific Coast is broken. In
many places on the coast ÜBTW and
NFTW members are already cross
ing picket lines," the ACA said.
"In view of these facts, it became
necessary for our membership to
take action to maintain their secur
ity, and they have done so by voting
to return to work at 7 o'clock to
morrow morning."
FINAL SETTLEMENT SEEN
There appeared a possibility, how
ever, that the NFTW's rank and file
members might override their ne
gotiators' firm stand and vote to
settle the dispute on the same
basis accepted yesterday by the two
other rnions.
Daniel Johnston, NFTW negoti
ator, said union meetings were be
ing held throughout the five West
ern States today to present the situ
ation to the membership "for their
consideration."
Johnston said the union's negotiat
ors still objected to the "non-dis
crimination" clause of the proposed
agreement which the company
"modified" yesterday to the satisfac
tion of both the United Brotherhood
of Telephone Workers and the Fed
eration of Women Telephone
Workers.
REHIRING CLAUSE
"The rewording of the clause did
nothing to change its meaning,"
Johnston declared. "It still means
that the company is free to refuse
to rehire striking employes if it
chooses tc do so."
The U Dn "W and FWTW spokes
men, however, apparently were sat
isfied with the modified clause as
they tentatively accepted the com
pany's offer of a $3-to-$4 wage boost
and its elimination of a maintenance
of membership provision.
Memberships of both unions were
to vote on ratification of the agree
ment before 3:30 p.m. tomorrow and
return to work within 43 hours after
final ratification.

"modified" yesterday to the satisfac
tion of both the United Brotherhood
of Telephone Workers and the Fed
eration of Women Telephone
Workers.
REHIRING CLAUSE
"The rewording of the clause did
nothing to change its meaning,"
Johnston declared. "It still means
that the company is free to refuse
to rehire striking employes if it
chooses tc do so."
The U Dn "W and FWTW spokes
men, however, apparently were sat
isfied with the modified clause as
they tentatively accepted the com
pany's offer of a $3-to-$4 wage boost
and its elimination of a maintenance
of membership provision.
Memberships of both unions were
to vote on ratification of the agree
ment before 3:30 p.m. tomorrow and
return to work within 43 hours after
final ratification.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11 (UP).—Officials of the CIO Ameri
can Communications Associations today threw in the towel in the
Far Western telephone fight with an announcement that they
consider "the strike is broken" and will order their members to
return to work at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.
Despite the ACA's action, the NFTW today clung stubbornly

to its demands as a lone holdout
against final settlement of the West
ern States phase of the strike.
Although it has not been actively
on strike, the powerful ACA has
given the striking telephone unions
its full support by refusing 100 per
cent to cross telephone picket lines in
the five Western states.
ACA members include 12,000 oper
ators in Northern California and
Nevada, 750 highly skilled toll test
board technicians in the five-state
area, 500 central office technicians in
Los Angeles and 400 accounting em
ployes in Washington and Idaho.
UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER
"On the Pacific Coast NFT W nego
tiations have completely broken
down," the ACA announcement said.
"The United Brotherhood of Tele
phone Workers signed an agreement
Saturday with the company, sur
rendering unconditionally and ac
cepting the company's odious clausc
permitting discrimination against its
own membership. The Federation
of Women Telephone Workers in
Southern California did likewise.
"These events, plus lack of any
plan by NFTW for effective action
to protect its members and strike
supporters against discrimination by
the company, mean that the strike
on the Pacific Coast is broken. In
many places on the coast ÜBTW and
NFTW members are already cross
ing picket lines," the ACA said.
"In view of these facts, it became
necessary for our membership to
take action to maintain their secur
ity, and they have done so by voting
to return to work at 7 o'clock to
morrow morning."
FINAL SETTLEMENT SEEN
There appeared a possibility, how
ever, that the NFTW's rank and file
members might override their ne
gotiators' firm stand and vote to
settle the dispute on the same
basis accepted yesterday by the two
other rnions.
Daniel Johnston, NFTW negoti
ator, said union meetings were be
ing held throughout the five West
ern States today to present the situ
ation to the membership "for their
consideration."
Johnston said the union's negotiat
ors still objected to the "non-dis
crimination" clause of the proposed
agreement which the company
"modified" yesterday to the satisfac
tion of both the United Brotherhood
of Telephone Workers and the Fed
eration of Women Telephone
Workers.
