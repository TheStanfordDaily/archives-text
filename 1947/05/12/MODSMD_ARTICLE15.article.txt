# Use Caution After Dark, Says Davis
## 
### 
Because of an incident last Thurs
day night when a Roble woman was
molested in the Roble woods, Police
Chief Gordon Davis requested that
all women use caution in walking
about the campus after dark.
Davis said that a call to the po
lice for the woman's assistance had
come from Roble iring the flag
disturbance l*Â»yon. A policeman
who was attempting to quiet the
fight at Toyon was unable to answer
the Roble call because someone had
let the air out of his tires, according
to Davis.
"There is no cause for undue
alan i," he said. "Women should
walk in pairs or in groups when go
ing to and from the library. They
especially should not walk to Palo
Alto alone at night."
He also emphasized that pedes
trians should stay in the sidewalk
area and should i\imediatcly report
any disturbances to the police de
partment for prompt action.
