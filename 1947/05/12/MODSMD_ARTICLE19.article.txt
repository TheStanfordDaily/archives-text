# Plans for Law Students' Crothers Hall To Be Completed June 1; Will House 63
## 
### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
The first step in the University's
long-range plan for the unification
of men's halls will be realized in
the very near future when the plans
for Crothers Hall, residence for
graduate law students, are com
pleted on June 1, according to El
dridgc T. Spencer, director of plan
ning.
Building will start as soon as pos
sible on the hall, which is a gift of
Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco. It will accommodate 63
graduate students in single rooms
on the assumption that by the time
a student reaches graduate standing
he needs privacy for more concen
trated study rather than the com
panionship afforded by the four-in
-1 one room provided by the esscntial
j ly freshman residences.
LIVED AT ENCINA
1 Judge Crothers was legal ad
' viser to Mrs. Stanford, having lived

j in Encina as a member of the Pio
neer Class. For many years lie has
been very mroh concerned with
the problems of student housing,
said Spencer.
"Housing is the basis of culture."
I is Jud<c Crothers' contention, and
his living residence will provide an
initial step to the attaining of that
culture, Spencer commented. Croth
ers has made several trips to East
ern universities to analyze the best
type of modern residences con
structed in those area?, and those
best suited to tic in with Stanford
architecture. Both Spencer and
Crothers have worked several years
on the residence plans.
TO HAVE GLASS PARTITIONS
Facing west on the corner of Es
condido and Galvez, the hall will be
constructed of light stucco and its
| color will match that of the newer
' campus residences. One noticeable

modernistic feature in the external
appearance will be that of extended
glassed-in portions. Windows in the
.single rooms, instead of being cen
tered on the outside wall, will be
replaced by a glass partition, for
greater accommodation in light, and
air circulation for the resident.
Eventually, the lounge and din
ing room (which arc not included
in the present plans for Crothers
Hall) will bo centrally located in a
court with those of two other grad
uate residences to be the same size
as Crothers. These latter two halls
have not yet been conceived but
will complete the unit sometime in
the future, according to Spencer.
CAL TECII SYSTEM
The same type of unified plan has
been advocated by Lewis Mumford,
internationally known planning ex
pert, who has been working with
Spencer on general plans for the
University. California Institute of

Technology also uses the system in
which cach of its dining rooms and
lounges is connectcd with its re
spective living group.
The main lobby of Crothers will
have mail boxes and a telephone
system connected with the rest of
the campus. In addition, it will also
have a bronze plaque, giving Judge
Crothers' dedication of the resi
dence, to be set in the concrete at
the time it is poured.
The building will be of modern
fireproof construction, having rein
forced concrete with steel studding
j and joists. It will be landscaped
i consistently with the other halls.
One modern addition to the hall
will be an up-to-date pressing room
with a Bcndix and a dryer for the
convenience of the residents.
Spencer expects the building of
j both Crothers Hall and the Law
I School to begin as soon as possible.

initial step to the attaining of that
culture, Spencer commented. Croth
ers has made several trips to East
ern universities to analyze the best
type of modern residences con
structed in those area?, and those
best suited to tic in with Stanford
architecture. Both Spencer and
Crothers have worked several years
on the residence plans.
TO HAVE GLASS PARTITIONS
Facing west on the corner of Es
condido and Galvez, the hall will be
constructed of light stucco and its
| color will match that of the newer
' campus residences. One noticeable

modernistic feature in the external
appearance will be that of extended
glassed-in portions. Windows in the
.single rooms, instead of being cen
tered on the outside wall, will be
replaced by a glass partition, for
greater accommodation in light, and
air circulation for the resident.
Eventually, the lounge and din
ing room (which arc not included
in the present plans for Crothers
Hall) will bo centrally located in a
court with those of two other grad
uate residences to be the same size
as Crothers. These latter two halls
have not yet been conceived but
will complete the unit sometime in
the future, according to Spencer.
CAL TECII SYSTEM
The same type of unified plan has
been advocated by Lewis Mumford,
internationally known planning ex
pert, who has been working with
Spencer on general plans for the
University. California Institute of

Technology also uses the system in
which cach of its dining rooms and
lounges is connectcd with its re
spective living group.
The main lobby of Crothers will
have mail boxes and a telephone
system connected with the rest of
the campus. In addition, it will also
have a bronze plaque, giving Judge
Crothers' dedication of the resi
dence, to be set in the concrete at
the time it is poured.
The building will be of modern
fireproof construction, having rein
forced concrete with steel studding
j and joists. It will be landscaped
i consistently with the other halls.
One modern addition to the hall
will be an up-to-date pressing room
with a Bcndix and a dryer for the
convenience of the residents.
Spencer expects the building of
j both Crothers Hall and the Law
I School to begin as soon as possible.
The first step in the University's
long-range plan for the unification
of men's halls will be realized in
the very near future when the plans
for Crothers Hall, residence for
graduate law students, are com
pleted on June 1, according to El
dridgc T. Spencer, director of plan
ning.
Building will start as soon as pos
sible on the hall, which is a gift of
Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco. It will accommodate 63
graduate students in single rooms
on the assumption that by the time
a student reaches graduate standing
he needs privacy for more concen
trated study rather than the com
panionship afforded by the four-in
-1 one room provided by the esscntial
j ly freshman residences.
