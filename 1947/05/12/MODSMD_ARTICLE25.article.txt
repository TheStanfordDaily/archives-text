# Rathbun Advises 'Idea' Devotion
## 
### 
Closing Stanford's Conference on
International Relations yesterday in
Cubberley Auditorium, Harry Rath
bun, professor of law, stressed that
man must change his attitudes and
become truly devoted to an idea in
order to take a responsible place i/i
this chaotic world.
Speaking on "The Individual's
Responsibility for Peace," Dr. Rath
bun opened his speech by quoting
from Albert Einstein and Phillip
Wylie. "The unleashed power of
the atom has changed everything
cxccpt our thinking," said Einstein,
and Wylie has said: "If we want a
better world, we've got to be better
people."
STOP DRIFTING
"We must clean the current of the
stream by cleaning out the source,
which is the individual," accord
ing to Dr. Rathbun. "If we arc
adrift, it's because we have nothing
to believe in powerfully enough to
give it our whole loyalty."
Dr. Rathbun stressed the point
that devotion to an idea releases
power. He emphasized three steps
individuals must take.
First, we must rediscover what
we do believe. If wc believe in
nothing, we must find something thai
will command our loyalty and that
will make sense, since modern man
will not believe in something which
is illusory.
Second, wc must become "crystal
clear" about what we do believe in.
Third, we must adopt the ideal
and try it out experimentally, giv
ing our whole devotion to discover
what is the truth. Wc must recog
nize what the facts arc and what
is the most productive action to be
taken.
OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE
The liberated objective individua ,
who is produced by a total loyalty
to some cause, is our goal, according
to Dr. Rathbun. It makes no dif
ference what wc call the idea which
can command man's total loyalty
and pull him along, "but it makes
all the difference between death,
destruction, and extinction, and life,
evolution, and destiny."
In the question period after his
speech, Dr. Rathbun indicated two
ways in which the individual can
change:
First, the individual must recog
nize that a change is called for; he
must not be smug. Second, the in
dividual must give total allegiance
to an idea, but it must be the right
idea.

Cubberley Auditorium, Harry Rath
bun, professor of law, stressed that
man must change his attitudes and
become truly devoted to an idea in
order to take a responsible place i/i
this chaotic world.
Speaking on "The Individual's
Responsibility for Peace," Dr. Rath
bun opened his speech by quoting
from Albert Einstein and Phillip
Wylie. "The unleashed power of
the atom has changed everything
cxccpt our thinking," said Einstein,
and Wylie has said: "If we want a
better world, we've got to be better
people."
STOP DRIFTING
"We must clean the current of the
stream by cleaning out the source,
which is the individual," accord
ing to Dr. Rathbun. "If we arc
adrift, it's because we have nothing
to believe in powerfully enough to
give it our whole loyalty."
Dr. Rathbun stressed the point
that devotion to an idea releases
power. He emphasized three steps
individuals must take.
First, we must rediscover what
we do believe. If wc believe in
nothing, we must find something thai
will command our loyalty and that
will make sense, since modern man
will not believe in something which
is illusory.
Second, wc must become "crystal
clear" about what we do believe in.
Third, we must adopt the ideal
and try it out experimentally, giv
ing our whole devotion to discover
what is the truth. Wc must recog
nize what the facts arc and what
is the most productive action to be
taken.
OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE
The liberated objective individua ,
who is produced by a total loyalty
to some cause, is our goal, according
to Dr. Rathbun. It makes no dif
ference what wc call the idea which
can command man's total loyalty
and pull him along, "but it makes
all the difference between death,
destruction, and extinction, and life,
evolution, and destiny."
In the question period after his
speech, Dr. Rathbun indicated two
ways in which the individual can
change:
First, the individual must recog
nize that a change is called for; he
must not be smug. Second, the in
dividual must give total allegiance
to an idea, but it must be the right
idea.
