# Religion Lagging Warns Gallagher
## 
### 
If man is to survive, religion must
come abreast of science with gi
snntic strides, Guest Chaplain Bucll
Gallagher warned the congregation
in the Memorial Church yesterday
morning.
Dr. Gallagher, professor of Chris
tian ethics at the Pacific School of
Religion, spoke on "Prometheus,
Adam, and the Atom" in conjunc
tion with the weekend Conference
on International Relations.
RATIONAL VS. MORAL
In his sermon, Dr. Gallagher typi
fied Prometheus as rational man.
Adam as moral man, and the atom
in connection with a threatening
robot.
Prometheus the Greek stole,fire
from the gods and started man on
the road to scientific development
and ultimate civilization.
Adam, Dr. Gallagher said, repre
sents the moral man and it was his
duty to prove worthy of the trust
his God placed in him by giving
him everything he desired.
GREEK VS. HEBREW
The Greek emphasis was upon
knowledge and power, while the
Hebrew tradition was one of good
ness and righteousness, the visiting
chaplain pointed out. Eventually
the Hebrew morality went into an
eclipse, scienc .\s forced ahead, and
relations between Adam and Pro
metheus were at an end.
"Surgeons can now sever the
moral centers of the brain," Dr.
Gallagher said, "leaving man under
pure rational control and without
conscicnce." This parallels the dis
connection between the Greek and
Hebrew traditions.
ATOMIC DESTRUCTION
"But are we in danger of a

second severance?" Dr. Gallagher
asked. "Will we have rational Pro
metheus, moral Adam, and the atom
—or more specifically, the robot?
Man has shifted the responsibility
of atomic destruction to robot con
trol," he added.
Control of the atom will mean
the abandonment of national sover
eignty, at least to the extent of
abolishing the right to make war,
the speaker explained. "If Adam
doesn't take over," he said, "the ro
bot will." Effective control will have
to be built upon strong moral foun
dations.
