the Law School, stressed the need
for educational institutions to "wake
up before it is too late" to interna
tional affairs in the introductory ad
dress of the Conference.
Commenting on the difficult task
faced by the State Department in
the day in, day out marshaling of
facts, Dr. Spaeth said that wc must
interpret the facts about foreign na
tions objectively and not subjec
tively.
One of the difficult tasks of the
American government is to make
policies that will stand up after
many years and be fair and agree
able to all nations large and small,
he stated.
Correlated with that problem is
the tendency for us to view Russia
as somehow different from the other
nations. Dr. Spaeth said that the
government must stand by its prin
ciples no matter with whom it is
dealing.
In answer to the challenge of
Communism, Dr. Spaeth asked if we
arc going to meet the challenge with
force or by the product of American
genius, "our arsenal of strength in
building bodies and homes and in
dustry."
