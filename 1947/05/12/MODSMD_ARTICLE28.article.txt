# Fisher Explains 'Russian Position'
## 
### 
"We should not fear so much the
consequences of Communism infil
tration that we are immobilized by
fear and rendered incapable of otter
ing those things we can and should
offer as leaders of the world," de
clared Dr. Harold H. Fisher, di
rector of the Hoover Library, Fri
day night in the second address in
the International Relations Confer
ence.
Speaking on "Russia's Position in
the World Today," Dr. Fisher said
that competition between the major
powers of the world today Ls a con
test for the minds and loyalties of
people.
"Communism offers order—full
employment, a classless society, an
end to the grosser forms of social
injustices— to the unsettled peo
ples of the world." he said.
Democracy, on the other hand, Dr.
Fisher pointed out, can offer ideals
of personal liberty, a high standard
of living, technical skills, and lib
erty of cultural and political ex
pression.
Politically inexperienced coun
tries arc especially susceptible to
Communism, Dr. Fisher said, since
the Communists offer some solution
to satisfying each of the four things
most people desire—economic secur
ity, advancement, recognition as an
individual, and the sense of being
socially useful.
Negotiation with Russia was
termed a "diplomacy of exhaustion"
hy Dr. Fisher. This "diplomacy of
exhaustion" is a result of the Com
munist doctrine that the Party line
is the true line, he declared.
' Those who don't iollow the Party
line automatically become enemies
of the people," he said. "Conse
quently, once a Soviet minister has
.stated his position, he retreats only
as a last resort—to do anything else
would be to become an enemy of the
people."
The belief of Party line infallibility
ako tends to set up two distinct
groups in countries where Commun
ism has been established, Dr. Fisher
added. The political shadings are
eliminated—those who are in the
center are driven either to the left
<>r lo the riwht, he slated.
Communist infiltration in coun
tries outside of the Soviet Union
should not be regarded as the join
ing of that country to Russia, Dr.
Fisher emphasized. The Communist
movement would develop loyalties
which make these outside countries
follow similar policies. However,
the policies would not be identical.
The assimilation of Communism
with the national traditions in coun
tries outside the Soviet Union has
bee n astounding, he declared. There
lore, these Communist-dominated
nations do differ in their application
of Marxist-Leninism, Dr. Fisher
said.
Mrs. Archibald, instructor in his
tory, stated in her seminar address
that Communism and Socialism were
identical in the goals sought, but
at odds as to the methods to be used
to attain that goal. Socialism uses
parliamentary methods, Commun
ism more active, direct attacks.
She also pointed out that Russia
has not expanded as far as Czarist
borders existed before the revolu
tion.
Mrs. Archibald keynoted her short
talk by saying that the question of
"One World or Two" really becomes
"One World or None" in the final
analysis. "There is really no east
ern or western civilization," she
concluded. "There must be only
one, worldwide civilization."

tion.
Mrs. Archibald keynoted her short
talk by saying that the question of
"One World or Two" really becomes
"One World or None" in the final
analysis. "There is really no east
ern or western civilization," she
concluded. "There must be only
one, worldwide civilization."
"We should not fear so much the
consequences of Communism infil
tration that we are immobilized by
fear and rendered incapable of otter
ing those things we can and should
offer as leaders of the world," de
clared Dr. Harold H. Fisher, di
rector of the Hoover Library, Fri
day night in the second address in
the International Relations Confer
ence.
Speaking on "Russia's Position in
the World Today," Dr. Fisher said
that competition between the major
powers of the world today Ls a con
test for the minds and loyalties of
people.
"Communism offers order—full
employment, a classless society, an
end to the grosser forms of social
injustices— to the unsettled peo
ples of the world." he said.
Democracy, on the other hand, Dr.
Fisher pointed out, can offer ideals
of personal liberty, a high standard
of living, technical skills, and lib
erty of cultural and political ex
pression.
Politically inexperienced coun
tries arc especially susceptible to
Communism, Dr. Fisher said, since
the Communists offer some solution
to satisfying each of the four things
most people desire—economic secur
ity, advancement, recognition as an
individual, and the sense of being
socially useful.
Negotiation with Russia was
termed a "diplomacy of exhaustion"
hy Dr. Fisher. This "diplomacy of
exhaustion" is a result of the Com
munist doctrine that the Party line
is the true line, he declared.
' Those who don't iollow the Party
line automatically become enemies
of the people," he said. "Conse
quently, once a Soviet minister has
.stated his position, he retreats only
as a last resort—to do anything else
would be to become an enemy of the
people."
The belief of Party line infallibility
ako tends to set up two distinct
groups in countries where Commun
ism has been established, Dr. Fisher
added. The political shadings are
eliminated—those who are in the
center are driven either to the left
<>r lo the riwht, he slated.
Communist infiltration in coun
tries outside of the Soviet Union
should not be regarded as the join
ing of that country to Russia, Dr.
Fisher emphasized. The Communist
movement would develop loyalties
which make these outside countries
follow similar policies. However,
the policies would not be identical.
The assimilation of Communism
with the national traditions in coun
tries outside the Soviet Union has
bee n astounding, he declared. There
lore, these Communist-dominated
nations do differ in their application
of Marxist-Leninism, Dr. Fisher
said.
Mrs. Archibald, instructor in his
tory, stated in her seminar address
that Communism and Socialism were
identical in the goals sought, but
at odds as to the methods to be used
to attain that goal. Socialism uses
parliamentary methods, Commun
ism more active, direct attacks.
She also pointed out that Russia
has not expanded as far as Czarist
borders existed before the revolu
tion.
