# Fear of Germany Lingers: Munk
## 
### 
"ABC of Eastern European poli
tics is their fear of ABCâ€”Atomic
Bomb and Communism," declared
Dr. Frank Munk, professor of Inter
national Relations at Reed College,
when speaking at a round-table dis
cussion on "Conflicts in Europe"
Friday night.
"The conflicts between European
countries are .lot limited to new
struggles," stated Dr. Munk, "but
the old conflicts are as bitter as
ever. Another special feature of
Eastern Europe is its lingering fear
of Germany," said Dr. Munk.
STILL HOPE
"There is still some hope of settle
ment of these conflicts," he said.
"Communism in these countries has
become nationalistic and has taken
up local color." Giving the example
of Czechoslovakia, he said that peo
ple in that country are integrating
Communism and democracy and are
hoping to enjoy still gr eater democ
racy.
"There is no chance of Eastern
Europe returning to previous re
gimes. Some 'sovietization' will
occur in the future," declared Dr.
Munk. He said that most Europeans
do net like Soviet Communism.
"But American policy is not the
best," he said. "We are merely
pushing these countries in the Rus
sian orbit."
Dr. Munk said that the policy of
military strength will not be useful
in Europe. "It will continue chaos,
contusion, and lack of faith in peace
and is a good ground for spread of
Communism."
FRENCH KEYNOTE SECURITY
Speaking on France, Dr. Graham
Stuart, professor of political science,
said that security against war is the
keynote of French foreign policy.
The situation in France is compli
cated by the fact that the largest
party is the Communist party which
takes orders from Moscow and is
aggressive and anti-democratic.
"America must help France as the
democratic bulwark against Com
munism," Stuart declared at the
end.
In the afternoon seminar on "Con
flicts in Europe," Dr. Munk said that
large and increasing American aid
abroad will be of tremendous bene
fit to U.S. economy at home. "It will
be a great aid to peoples of the
world and a remedial measure
against unemployment at home," he
said.
