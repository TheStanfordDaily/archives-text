# Buss Outlines U.S. Duty in Far East
## 
### 
"There is more than just conflict
in our relations with the Far East,"
Dr. Claude A. Buss said in his talk
on "Conflicts in the Far East" Sat
urday in Cubberley Auditorium.
"The Challenge to the United States
is one of construction and leader
ship."
Dr. Buss compared the position of
the United States to that of a large
elephant walking down a crowded
street. Every time the elephant
changes its mind it affects a great
many of the people on the crowded
street. Every time the United States

changes its policies it affects a great
many people in the Far East.
"I'm not sure we're ail honest in
appraising what other people think
of Democracy," Dr. Buss continued.
American occupation forces in Japan
obtain good seats on the trains but
the Japanese have to rush and light
to get any place on a train. "Be
fore the war, the Japanese civilian
had to give way in favor of the
Japanese military. Now he has to
give way to an American in uni
form. The Japanese know that the
American military is superior to
his own, but he still must be shown
the superior value of our democratic
way of life."
One of the most challenging jobs
facing the United States in rela
tion to Japan is to convince the new
generation that "the victory of the
United Nations is not a mere ex
change of one militarism for another
militarism. Thus, our problems in
Japan are infinitely more than lim
ited conflicts of ideology."
CHINKS SITUATION
In speaking on China Dr. Buss
said that American foreign policy
has to take into consideration:
1. That at least 80 percent of the
Chinese people have very little in
terest beyond the rice bowl;
2. That the disunity in China is
much greater than Communism and
the Kuomintang. Chiang Kai
Shek's orders extend only as far as
his military power. Canton will or
will not follow the orders as it feels
inclined.
For a fundamental solution China
itself will have to give leadership.
j'We are not in position to assume
that leadership ourselves and there
is no guarantee that we would have
the wisdom to solve China's prob
lems on our initiative or against
China's wishes. If we went in too
fast and too far we would cause
more trouble than benefit."

his military power. Canton will or
will not follow the orders as it feels
inclined.
For a fundamental solution China
itself will have to give leadership.
j'We are not in position to assume
that leadership ourselves and there
is no guarantee that we would have
the wisdom to solve China's prob
lems on our initiative or against
China's wishes. If we went in too
fast and too far we would cause
more trouble than benefit."
"There is more than just conflict
in our relations with the Far East,"
Dr. Claude A. Buss said in his talk
on "Conflicts in the Far East" Sat
urday in Cubberley Auditorium.
"The Challenge to the United States
is one of construction and leader
ship."
Dr. Buss compared the position of
the United States to that of a large
elephant walking down a crowded
street. Every time the elephant
changes its mind it affects a great
many of the people on the crowded
street. Every time the United States

changes its policies it affects a great
many people in the Far East.
"I'm not sure we're ail honest in
appraising what other people think
of Democracy," Dr. Buss continued.
American occupation forces in Japan
obtain good seats on the trains but
the Japanese have to rush and light
to get any place on a train. "Be
fore the war, the Japanese civilian
had to give way in favor of the
Japanese military. Now he has to
give way to an American in uni
form. The Japanese know that the
American military is superior to
his own, but he still must be shown
the superior value of our democratic
way of life."
One of the most challenging jobs
facing the United States in rela
tion to Japan is to convince the new
generation that "the victory of the
United Nations is not a mere ex
change of one militarism for another
militarism. Thus, our problems in
Japan are infinitely more than lim
ited conflicts of ideology."
CHINKS SITUATION
In speaking on China Dr. Buss
said that American foreign policy
has to take into consideration:
1. That at least 80 percent of the
Chinese people have very little in
terest beyond the rice bowl;
2. That the disunity in China is
much greater than Communism and
the Kuomintang. Chiang Kai
Shek's orders extend only as far as
his military power. Canton will or
will not follow the orders as it feels
inclined.
For a fundamental solution China
itself will have to give leadership.
j'We are not in position to assume
that leadership ourselves and there
is no guarantee that we would have
the wisdom to solve China's prob
lems on our initiative or against
China's wishes. If we went in too
fast and too far we would cause
more trouble than benefit."
