# 'U.S. Must Expand Democracy': Kreps
## 
### 
Speaking on "America's Position
in the Post-War World," Theodore
Kreps, professor of business eco
nomics, said that democracy is not
something to defend, but something
we must expand.
Dr. Kreps spoke largely about the
economic phase of America's posi
tion, staling that fhe United States
is the most revolutionary force op
erating in the world today. This he
attributed to three factors: the Uni
ted States' position is one of the
"land of the world"; it is a land of
capitalism; and it is a land of lib
erty and ordered democracy.
"We are undermining the world's
economic structure," he stated, "by
technological development, and are
largely responsible for the fact that
the economic world is one world,"
Dr. Kreps believes.
U.S. MORE SOCIALISTIC
Even though the United States is
clearly a capitalistic country, we
have many more traces of socialism
than we did 100 years ago, according
to Dr. Kreps. The state is providing
such things as schools, gas, and
lights, which not long ago were fur
nished by private incomes. "The
United Slates has revoked monop
oly capitalism," he said, "by insti

tuting provisions and grievances
against it."
The ultimate goal of economics in
the United States is mass distribu
tion and consumption. By giving
each person enough commodities
and by giving him enough income
through high employment with
which to buy them, we can find "a
people's capitalism," said Dr. Kreps.
By our government of ordered
liberty, we assure in this country
such economic rights as unions, col
lective bargaining, and limited lia
bility. "The fundamental democracy
wants to do away with the disgyises
of economic coercion," Dr. Kreps
stated. He believes that by increas
ing buying power abroad, we can
best increase employment and at
tain the principle of sound capital
exchange for benefit to foreign
countries and to us.
ENDORSE FREE TRADE
An international labor organiza
tion can raise standards all over the
world, and we must endorse propo
sals lor free trade in order to assure
the maximum economic security for
the world. No maximum, can be
rcached, however, that will not re
quire our all, said Dr. Kreps. "It
must be a dynamic development
rather than static criteria," he stat
ed, "and we must shift emphasis to
the human being."
The secret of American prosper
ity lies not in its large resources,
but in our public schools. Dr. Kreps
said that the public school is the
outstanding building in every city.
The heart of economic inequality
is not wealth, but it lies in differ
ences in skills. By a system of or
dered democracy we can increase
and maximize skills, giving each
citizen a part as a consumer. "De
mocracy," said Dr. Kreps, "is a spir
itual ladder which can lead us to
peace and prosperity."
