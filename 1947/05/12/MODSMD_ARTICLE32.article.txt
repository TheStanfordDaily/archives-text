"Soviet Russia was forced into the
Near East to prevent the United
States and Great Britain from ex
panding their empires and endan
gering Russia's position," said
Wayne S. Vucinich, Stanford his
tory instructor, in his talk on "Con
flicts in the Near East" Saturday in
Cubberley Auditorium.
The three great powers, Great
Britain, the United States, and Rus
sia, are all interested in the Near
East, the Balkan expert continued.
Great Britain needs the area the

most, for not only does it supply
her with raw materials and markets
for her goods, but it also contains
the Suez Canal, the nearest sea
communication between England
and India, he asserted. The United
States' policies in the Near East are
primarily economic, for oil, and an
ti-Communistic. Russia wants con
trol of the area for security and
economic and Communistic reasons.
Dr. Vucinich cited examples such
as England's policy in Iraq, Pales
tine, and the Balkans.
"Throughout history," he de
clared, "domination in the Near East
has meant greatness, empire, arid
prosperity." He added that Near
Eastern civilization has been re
tarded because of the imperialistic
policies and selfishness of the great
powers. "Are we striving for world
domination by four powers or for
an international community?" he
asked.
However, Dr. Vucinich felt that
these problems are not unsolvable.
"They may be worked out by
means of an international organiza
tion or perhaps by diplomacy," he
concluded.
