# Munk Describes Nationalism's Evil
## 
### 
Dr. Munk, professor of Interna
tional Relations at Reed College,
spoke on "Nationalism as Interna
tional Anarchy" Saturday afternoon
to a small audience in Cubberley
Auditorium.
He discussed the nature of mod
ern nationalism in three phases: be
ing of the masses instead of the
classes as it once was; having spread
functionally; and the tendency to
wards the supremacy of nationalism.
Nationalism, according to Dr.
Munk, was once a characteristic of
the nobility, then of the bourgeou
sie, and has finally enveloped the
masses. Now there is "mass na
tionalism instead Qf class national
ism."
BEGAN AS CULTURAL MOVE
Romantic nationalism, which be
gan as a cultural movement, changed

to political and then economic na
tionalism. At the present time the
nation is the basic economic unit of
production, stated Dr. Munk.
The supremacy of nationalism is
evident, according to Dr. Munk. It
has taken the place, to a large ex
tent, of the social institutions of the
state. Nationalism is the only loy
alty and faith the people believe in.
Nationalism has followed a ten
dency to become more exclusive,
with states expecting their citizens
to follow the one ideology of the
state. Supra-national states have
broken down; states hesitate to
share their statehood with foreign
ers. The Soviet Union alone has
been able to combine loyalty to the
state with loyalty to nationality,
said Dr. Munk.
UN IN CRISIS
He also said that the UN was
undergoing an extremely serious
crisis, and that it would fail if na
tionalism continues to extend its
tendencies. "In the tide of nation
alism, the UN must lose and is los
ing ground," said Dr. Munk. The
UN needs a new attitude and a new
real effort to make it work.
Dr. Munk said that are living
in the twilight, that the people in
the world are "living in no-man's
and no-nation's land between war
and peace." There is not enbugh
hope and l'aith to build."
"Revolutions are raising their ugly
heads in more than one place," ac
cording to Dr. Munk. "The U.S.,
the only remaining bulwark of West
ern Civilization, is bound to go
through trying times."'

to a small audience in Cubberley
Auditorium.
He discussed the nature of mod
ern nationalism in three phases: be
ing of the masses instead of the
classes as it once was; having spread
functionally; and the tendency to
wards the supremacy of nationalism.
Nationalism, according to Dr.
Munk, was once a characteristic of
the nobility, then of the bourgeou
sie, and has finally enveloped the
masses. Now there is "mass na
tionalism instead Qf class national
ism."
BEGAN AS CULTURAL MOVE
Romantic nationalism, which be
gan as a cultural movement, changed

to political and then economic na
tionalism. At the present time the
nation is the basic economic unit of
production, stated Dr. Munk.
The supremacy of nationalism is
evident, according to Dr. Munk. It
has taken the place, to a large ex
tent, of the social institutions of the
state. Nationalism is the only loy
alty and faith the people believe in.
Nationalism has followed a ten
dency to become more exclusive,
with states expecting their citizens
to follow the one ideology of the
state. Supra-national states have
broken down; states hesitate to
share their statehood with foreign
ers. The Soviet Union alone has
been able to combine loyalty to the
state with loyalty to nationality,
said Dr. Munk.
UN IN CRISIS
He also said that the UN was
undergoing an extremely serious
crisis, and that it would fail if na
tionalism continues to extend its
tendencies. "In the tide of nation
alism, the UN must lose and is los
ing ground," said Dr. Munk. The
UN needs a new attitude and a new
real effort to make it work.
Dr. Munk said that are living
in the twilight, that the people in
the world are "living in no-man's
and no-nation's land between war
and peace." There is not enbugh
hope and l'aith to build."
"Revolutions are raising their ugly
heads in more than one place," ac
cording to Dr. Munk. "The U.S.,
the only remaining bulwark of West
ern Civilization, is bound to go
through trying times."'
