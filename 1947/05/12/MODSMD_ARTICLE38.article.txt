# Stanford Ballclub Upsets League Leading Bears
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's rampaging baseballers, timing their hits at the right time and putting on the
flashiest fielding exhibition they've shown all season, hacked the myth of California diamond
supremacy to bits Saturday afternoon as they tamed the Bears, 6 to 1, on the Sunken Diamond.
It was the first time since 1939 that the Wolteimen haye beaten the boys from Berkeley, and
marked the end of a 17-game California over the Indian.-
Earlier, the Cinnamon Bears had gone hog-wild against the Farm Jayvees on the Frosh Field

to emerge on (he long, long end of
a 20 to 11} score, but the junior var
sity triumph for the visitors was
small consolation for the Bears.
The Indians' Dave Stott allowed
the Bears plenty of hits, and walked
three men and hit another for good
measure, but he had it in the pinches
and that was all the righthander
needed to chalk up his third straight
C.1.8.A. victory.
The visitors were stopped cold in
the second, after they had loaded
the bases with one out and had one
run in, when Buck Brownson picked
up a grounder on the grass and fired
it to catcher Ward Walkup who
whipped it to Ben Cardinalli at first
for a double play which just about
broke the Bears' heart.
Again in the third, they sent a
man racing home from third, but
again Brownson came through with
a perfect peg to the plate, and Walk
up had the on-coming Jim Fiscalini
out cold—although the burly catcher
was bowled over by the Bear out
fielder in making the putout.
The Indians scored once in each
of the first three innings while the
Bears were having trouble tallying
just once, but in the eventful fifth
the Woltermen scored two more to
put the Bears just about out of the
game.
NEAR RIOT AVOIDI'I)
After Dingfelder headed for sec
c id, Barnise cut oil the Cal catcher's
peg to second and threw it to third
in an attempt to catch Nell, but the
throw went past the bag and Nell
went home.
Dingfelder rounded second and
made a turn at third, and seeing that
the Bears were fumbling around
with the ball, he reached down to
pick up his cap and headed for
borne.
COLLISION AT HOME
The throw beat him, but Ding
felder carrie in with a crash and the
ball went flying out of catcher Doug
Clayton's hand—and that's when the
fun started.
The Bears were angry because
Dingfelder didn't slide—Clayton in
patricular. But after the two teams
got on the field, a new development
came up—the plate umpire sent
Dinfelder back to third.
Hitting honors for the day were
generally shared by the Cardinals,
who only connected for seven hits.
George Sloat got two of them in five
trips to the plate, and drove in one
run. Dingfelder drove home two
runs with a hit and a s.o.e.
Jensen, the second Ca! hurler,
had the fans oh-ing ind the Indians
ducking with his wild fast balls,
Then in the eighth, he caught hold
of one of Stott's pitches and sent it
in a tremendous arch out, out over
the 360-foot fence, just a few yards
foul.

the Bears plenty of hits, and walked
three men and hit another for good
measure, but he had it in the pinches
and that was all the righthander
needed to chalk up his third straight
C.1.8.A. victory.
The visitors were stopped cold in
the second, after they had loaded
the bases with one out and had one
run in, when Buck Brownson picked
up a grounder on the grass and fired
it to catcher Ward Walkup who
whipped it to Ben Cardinalli at first
for a double play which just about
broke the Bears' heart.
Again in the third, they sent a
man racing home from third, but
again Brownson came through with
a perfect peg to the plate, and Walk
up had the on-coming Jim Fiscalini
out cold—although the burly catcher
was bowled over by the Bear out
fielder in making the putout.
The Indians scored once in each
of the first three innings while the
Bears were having trouble tallying
just once, but in the eventful fifth
the Woltermen scored two more to
put the Bears just about out of the
game.

After Dingfelder headed for sec

peg to second and threw it to third
in an attempt to catch Nell, but the
throw went past the bag and Nell
went home.
Dingfelder rounded second and
made a turn at third, and seeing that
the Bears were fumbling around

pick up his cap and headed for

COLLISION AT HOME
The throw beat him, but Ding
felder carrie in with a crash and the
ball went flying out of catcher Doug
Clayton's hand—and that's when the
fun started.
The Bears were angry because
Dingfelder didn't slide—Clayton in
patricular. But after the two teams
got on the field, a new development
came up—the plate umpire sent
Dinfelder back to third.
Hitting honors for the day were
generally shared by the Cardinals,
who only connected for seven hits.
George Sloat got two of them in five
trips to the plate, and drove in one
run. Dingfelder drove home two
runs with a hit and a s.o.e.
Jensen, the second Ca! hurler,
had the fans oh-ing ind the Indians

Then in the eighth, he caught hold
of one of Stott's pitches and sent it
in a tremendous arch out, out over

foul.

STANFORD'S VARSITY FIRST-BASEMAN. Ben Cardinalli. who
figured in (he smashing dia' iond win over the Golden Bears Saturday.
Stanford's rampaging baseballers, timing their hits at the right time and putting on the
flashiest fielding exhibition they've shown all season, hacked the myth of California diamond
supremacy to bits Saturday afternoon as they tamed the Bears, 6 to 1, on the Sunken Diamond.
It was the first time since 1939 that the Wolteimen haye beaten the boys from Berkeley, and
marked the end of a 17-game California over the Indian.-
Earlier, the Cinnamon Bears had gone hog-wild against the Farm Jayvees on the Frosh Field

to emerge on (he long, long end of
a 20 to 11} score, but the junior var
sity triumph for the visitors was
small consolation for the Bears.
The Indians' Dave Stott allowed
the Bears plenty of hits, and walked
three men and hit another for good
measure, but he had it in the pinches
and that was all the righthander
needed to chalk up his third straight
C.1.8.A. victory.
The visitors were stopped cold in
the second, after they had loaded
the bases with one out and had one
run in, when Buck Brownson picked
up a grounder on the grass and fired
it to catcher Ward Walkup who
whipped it to Ben Cardinalli at first
for a double play which just about
broke the Bears' heart.
Again in the third, they sent a
man racing home from third, but
again Brownson came through with
a perfect peg to the plate, and Walk
up had the on-coming Jim Fiscalini
out cold—although the burly catcher
was bowled over by the Bear out
fielder in making the putout.
The Indians scored once in each
of the first three innings while the
Bears were having trouble tallying

the Woltermen scored two more to
put the Bears just about out of the
