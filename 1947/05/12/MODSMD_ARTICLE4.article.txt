# Dekes Trek To Win Bet
## 
### 
Bud Gates and Jack White, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, walked from the
Deke house to the San Francisco
City Hall in eignt and one-half
hours yesterday to win over $100
in wagers from Dekes and others
who bet they couldn't do it in ten
hours.
Starting at G a.m., the marathon
ers arrived at the City Hall at 2:30
p.m., averaging almost four miles
per hour for the 35 odd miles
against Sunday traffic. They set out
at a fast pace, running for two min
utes and walking for ten, until they
were too tired to run.
Gates, who took his feet out of
hot water and epsom salts long
enough to answer the telephone last
night, said, "We're rather proud of
our accomplishment, but it's some
thing we don't want to do againâ€”
right away."
