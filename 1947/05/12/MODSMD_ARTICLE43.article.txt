# LAAC Wins Track Meet
## 
### 
Los Angeles Athletic Club's vaunted Mercurymen came through almost
as predicted* but not without a decided scare from the Winged "O" flyers
of the Olympic Club in taking last Saturday's triangular track and field
outrfig on the Angell Field oval. The victors tallied 58 digits to the Olym
pians' 55 as the host, Stanford, brought up the rear with 43.
It took the last event a brilliant win in the mile relay by some 25

yards over Stanford, to enable the i
Mercurit.es to nose out the Olympic
Club. The Southerners' quartet of
Parker, Schauer, Bourland, and
Wachtler clipped the mile in the
excellent time of 3:15 flat.
As it turned out later, the Olym
pic Club could have deadlocked the
Angelenos if two of their entries in
the two-mile grind had just walked
the distance. When tcammatcS Bob
Lehman. "Mushy" Girard, and
Frank Johnson dropped out, Jim
Coughlin went on to win easily over
his lone remaining competitor, the
Indians' Frank Ganahl. A third and
fourth for the Olympic Club would
have provided the desired three
points.'
SNYDER A DOUBLE WINNER
St aft ford captain A 1 Snyder and
Cliff Bourland, former USC great,
"notched the only double win of the
day. Snyder took both hurdles
events with not undue strain in the
excellent times of 14.6 and 23.7,
while Bourland captured the cen
tury and furlong in 9.9 and 21.7.

Martin Biles, representing the
Olympic Club, uncorked the best
throw recorded in the nation this
year in the javelin, a beauty meas
uring 225 ft. 2 in., to take the meas
ure of Steve Seymour of the Ange
lenos who placed second with a
218-ft. 9-in. performance. Frank
Held, Stanford's spear artist, topped
his former mark by some 10 ft. in
registering a 1971t. 10 Vii-in. effort
for fourth.
MAXWELL SHADED IN 440
Johnny Wachtler, another ex-
Trojan, uncorked a -terrific sprint
which was too much for Terry Max
well, running his first competitive
440, to win this event handily in the
top time recorded on Angell Field
this â€¢ year, 47.7. Franklin Johftson
finished two yards behind Maxwell.
Willard Smith, former Indian high
jumper competing for the Olympic
Club, copped his specialty' at 0 ft.
5V2 in., but was doubly impressive
with his three close misses at 6 ft.
7Va in.
