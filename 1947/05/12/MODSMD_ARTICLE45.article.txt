## Conference Growth Envisioned

Stanford's first Conference on International
Relations, held over the week-end, was an
excellent success.
The Conference speakers and the Confer
ence Planning Committee deserve a good
deal of credit for a well organized and well
presented session.
Such a start provides a very firm basis for
future conferences, and is a fine boost for
the activities of the Institute of International
Relations.
Members of the Conference committee have
always envisioned a larger session which
would include most of the student body and
iaculty.
The interest shown in this first series of
talks justifies support of a much larger, and

more inclusive, Conference. Such support
will have to come in a very active way from
members of the Administration and the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, and most definitely
from Excom and other student leaders.
If future conferences are to have the de
sired effect, then they must be planned with
a view to getting participation from the stu
dent who normally will not go out of his way
to attend such affairs.
This is not just the job of future Conference
committees, but is also the responsibility of
student leaders who endorsed the plans of the
lIR, Administration members who have ex
pressed approval of such plans, and members
of the faculty who have a duty to make their
students more aware of immediate world
conditions.
