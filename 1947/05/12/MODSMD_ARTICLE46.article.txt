# BULL SESSION

### HELEN PINKERTON 
The recent happy incident between Encina and
Toyon men is strictly in the Encina tradition, as are
the burning haystacks and the pilfered silverware.
Exuberant young men have always delighted in
such group action. They learn cooperation and team
spirit, which is, after all, why they come to college.
They don't come to learn to cross the current of
student interest even if by some unprecedented
thinking they feel they are justified.
Unfortunately the group spirit isn't awake in every
campus residence.
Even Encina authorities share their enthusiasm.
Some time ago a few of the boys were testing the
cutting power of the blade of a large sword they had
in their possession. They were hacking away at a
chair, when a nightwatchman came in.
"Don't do that, boys," he said. Continuing to ex
periment, they asked why? He pointed out that it

was destructive to property. Alter more verbal
sparring, which had no affect on the action of the
boys, the watchman took the sword from them. "If
you're going to chop you may as well chop right," he
said and shattered the chair in half with one good
whack.
In what other campus residence does an indi
vidual feel such solidarity and group unity behind
h'im that he dares to remove telephone boxes from
the wall? In most houses the individuals would be
selfish enough to want to use the phones.
After all, it's from the battlefields of Encina that
come the fighting teams that carry Stanford's name
abroad to the world. What might come from some
freshman's independent thought on a bio project or
(he advanced reading he tried to do amid the hurly
burly of real college life is minor compared to this.
