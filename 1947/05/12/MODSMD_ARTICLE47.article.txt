### CECIL ROSPAW 
Recently in this maelstrom of the "Political Ice-
Age," as Arthur Koestler calls it, two important
speeches have come to our attention. They are im
portant not only in content, but because of the posi
tions which these men hold.
One of the speakers was Dr. A. Powell Davies,
pastor of the All Soul's Unitarian Church in Wash
ington, D.C., and the other was Father George H.
Dunne, Professor of Political Philosophy at Loyola
University, Los Angeles.
These two men, representatives of two branches
of thought within the Christian religion, seem to be
more than united in political thought at a time when
all action in America seems to be directed by a nega
tive philosophy.
Father Dunne has this to say about the present
American attitude on world affairs: "In past times our
strength in the world rested not upon armed might,
but consisted in the magnetic appeal of the ideals
ior which we stood."
"Times have changed . . . we have lost sight of
our ideals. We have become fat, lazy, fearful, cynical,
and selfish. We have become afraid, afraid of Fas
cism, and afraid of Communism. And we seem to
have lost confidence in the dynamic power of gen
uinely democratic ideals. Communism is contagious
and we seem to think the only answer to contagion
is force."
Dr. Davies gives a good definition when he says:
"Western Society is confused, but not degenerate.
We have a basic religion, the faith is in man, and not
social mechanics."
From Father Dunne: "The appeal of communism
to the peoples of the world is in a set of ideas. You
do not destroy ideas by force. You destroy them
only by opposing to them better ideas."
"Three out of four people of the world are of
color. We offer Democracy. What do those people
of color outside of our boundaries see within the
U.S.?
"People of color everywhere treated with contempt,
shunned like lepers, relegated to the position of sec
ond-class citizens, . . . not permitted to live in the
same neighborhood with arrogant colorless people,
shut out of schools, out of restaurants, out of em-

ploymcnt . . . imprisoned in a prison of prejudice,
discrimination, segregation.
"Racial segregation in any form is the basic denial
of the basic equality of men." Here he points out
that man is an intellectual substance, containing the
same human nature and the same amount of dignity.
And whatever accidental differences appear between
men by birth, wealth, environment, heredity, or
color, men are equal in substance and equal in
dignity."
"Tolerance is never the child of goodwill so much
as the daughter of necessity," says Dr. Davies on the
subject. "But once it is safely born, it has a good
chance to grow."
"A sane integrated culture cannot be built upon
professed principles that are constantly contradicted
in practice," says Father Dunne.
"We are so busy investigating un-American ac
tivities that we have no time to promote American
activities. The progressive one who is dedicated to
the liberation of man from every force, condition, and
circumstance that frustrates his full realization of
himself as a human person. That is the ideal to which
every Christian should be dedicated.
"If the people who spend 90 per cent of their time
worrying about communism would spend all of their
time under the influence of Christian and democratic
ideals, striving to build a better society there would
not be anything for them to worry about," Father
Dunne concluded.
Dr. Davies has this to say: "... let us repent the
evils we have failed to rectify. But not too long.
Many American idealists, and liberals in particular,
are spending too much time on their knees, repenting,
and not enough on their feet, going somewhere. Com
munism will be defeated by a regenerated liberalism
. . . but not until Americans understand that their own
Revolution was much more fundamental than the
Russian Revolution, and that Lincoln and not Lenin
is the predestinate symbol of the common man."
Dr. Davies hopes that:
"With malice toward none,
With charity for all.
With firmness in the right, as God gives us
to see the right.
We may finish the work we are in."

munism will be defeated by a regenerated liberalism
. . . but not until Americans understand that their own
Revolution was much more fundamental than the
Russian Revolution, and that Lincoln and not Lenin
is the predestinate symbol of the common man."
Dr. Davies hopes that:
"With malice toward none,
With charity for all.
With firmness in the right, as God gives us
to see the right.
We may finish the work we are in."
Recently in this maelstrom of the "Political Ice-
Age," as Arthur Koestler calls it, two important
speeches have come to our attention. They are im
portant not only in content, but because of the posi
tions which these men hold.
One of the speakers was Dr. A. Powell Davies,
pastor of the All Soul's Unitarian Church in Wash
ington, D.C., and the other was Father George H.
Dunne, Professor of Political Philosophy at Loyola
University, Los Angeles.
These two men, representatives of two branches
of thought within the Christian religion, seem to be
more than united in political thought at a time when
all action in America seems to be directed by a nega
tive philosophy.
Father Dunne has this to say about the present
American attitude on world affairs: "In past times our
strength in the world rested not upon armed might,
but consisted in the magnetic appeal of the ideals
ior which we stood."
"Times have changed . . . we have lost sight of
our ideals. We have become fat, lazy, fearful, cynical,
and selfish. We have become afraid, afraid of Fas
cism, and afraid of Communism. And we seem to
have lost confidence in the dynamic power of gen
uinely democratic ideals. Communism is contagious
and we seem to think the only answer to contagion
is force."
Dr. Davies gives a good definition when he says:
"Western Society is confused, but not degenerate.
We have a basic religion, the faith is in man, and not
social mechanics."
From Father Dunne: "The appeal of communism
to the peoples of the world is in a set of ideas. You
do not destroy ideas by force. You destroy them
only by opposing to them better ideas."
"Three out of four people of the world are of
color. We offer Democracy. What do those people
of color outside of our boundaries see within the
U.S.?
"People of color everywhere treated with contempt,
shunned like lepers, relegated to the position of sec
ond-class citizens, . . . not permitted to live in the
same neighborhood with arrogant colorless people,
shut out of schools, out of restaurants, out of em-

ploymcnt . . . imprisoned in a prison of prejudice,
discrimination, segregation.
"Racial segregation in any form is the basic denial
of the basic equality of men." Here he points out
that man is an intellectual substance, containing the
same human nature and the same amount of dignity.
And whatever accidental differences appear between
men by birth, wealth, environment, heredity, or
color, men are equal in substance and equal in
dignity."
"Tolerance is never the child of goodwill so much
as the daughter of necessity," says Dr. Davies on the
subject. "But once it is safely born, it has a good
chance to grow."
"A sane integrated culture cannot be built upon
professed principles that are constantly contradicted
in practice," says Father Dunne.
"We are so busy investigating un-American ac
tivities that we have no time to promote American
activities. The progressive one who is dedicated to
the liberation of man from every force, condition, and
circumstance that frustrates his full realization of
himself as a human person. That is the ideal to which
every Christian should be dedicated.
"If the people who spend 90 per cent of their time
worrying about communism would spend all of their
time under the influence of Christian and democratic
ideals, striving to build a better society there would
not be anything for them to worry about," Father
Dunne concluded.
Dr. Davies has this to say: "... let us repent the
evils we have failed to rectify. But not too long.
Many American idealists, and liberals in particular,
are spending too much time on their knees, repenting,
and not enough on their feet, going somewhere. Com
munism will be defeated by a regenerated liberalism
. . . but not until Americans understand that their own
Revolution was much more fundamental than the
Russian Revolution, and that Lincoln and not Lenin
is the predestinate symbol of the common man."
