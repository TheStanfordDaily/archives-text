# 'Exit' Cast Is Lauded
## 
### 
This is a rave notice for the five
persons responsible for the produc
tion of Jean-Paul Satre's "No Exit"
at the Little Theater Saturday night.
These live persons attacked a dif
ficult problem — interpreting and
acting what seems at best a con
fused play—and came out success
fully.
The five persons are George Nich
ols, the director, and Ken Jones,
Beatrice Manley, Elaine Maltzman,
and Bill Vorenberg, actors.
Beatrice Manley, as a vicious,
hard, biting homosexual, was most
often Satre's mouthpiece and is
convincing and strong in her part.
She was at her best at the end of
the play when she built a grating,
emotional monologue to a well-de
veloped pitch.
Ken Jones played a coward who
seeks to order his life by self-justi
fication. He was polished and clear.
As an intellectually void nympho
maniac, Elaine Maltzman gave a
sensuous, clinging quality to her
role.
Bill Vorenberg was appropriately
beady in a minor expositional part.
George Nichols' direction was un
derstanding and careful. Under the
circumstances the job was certainly
outstanding.—Millar
