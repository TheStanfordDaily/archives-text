# Chinese Students Start Fund Drive
## 
### 
A drive among Chinese students
on campus and their families to
raise enough money to rebuild the
Chinese Clubhouse foundation was
planned at the meeting of the Chi
nese Club Thursday night, according
to Jack Quan, president.
It is estimated that the entire job
will cost $4,QUO, of which the Chinese
Alumni Association has pledged to
raise $2,500. It is up to the members
themselves to raise the remaining
$1,500, according to Quan.
It is hoped that the project will
get under way this summer when
there will be few members living
at the club. The house will be
jacked up from its old foundation,
and the students will live in it while
the new one is being constructed.
Members of the drive committee,
under the chairmanship of Quan,
are Norman Ong and George Lee.
