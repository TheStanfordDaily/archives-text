# Telephone Strike Ended On Pacific Coast; Eastern Strikers Refused Peace
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (UP)—
A gradual return to normal tele
phone service was reported in all
parts of the Far West today as the
principal strike - supporting unions
gave up the fight, leaving the Na
tional Federation of Telephone
Workers to stand alone.
Negotiations between the NFTW
and the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company remained at a
standstill as union negotiators
awaited the reactions of the rank
and-file before proceeding further.
As the situation stands now the
NFTW is stubbornly holding out for
a satisfactory non-discrimination
clause before it will accept a PT&T
contract.
Daniel Johnston, chief negotiator
for western NFTW unions, said the
results of some week-end member
ship meetings have already been re
ceived indicating that the member
ship favored continuance of the
fight single-handedly. It was noted,
however, that this reaction was
voiccd before today's strong back
to-work movement by other unions.
Service was near normal in all
parts of the West today, except for
Oregon, Washington and northern
Idaho, but word of the ÜBTW's rati
fication was expected to speed the
return tomorrow in the Northwest.

Palo Alto telephone switchboards
have not yet Rone back to normal
operation and long distance calls are
still being handled on an emergency
basis, according to B. L. Manuel, lo
cal manager.
Manuel stated that outside plant
forces and maintenance men are re
turning to work promptly but the
union officials have not yet advised
the company as to when the opera
tors will return.

WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP).—
Telephone strike leaders, calling for
an anti-trust investigation of the
American Telephone & Telegraph
Company and its Western Electric
subsidiary, said today that Western
has rejected an offer to arbitrate
the one big dispute blocking a com
plete resumption of telephone service.
Henry Mayer, attorney for 17 tele
phone unions, told reporters the
strikers got a blunt "no" when they
offered to call off their 36-day walk
out in 21 Western Electric manufac
turing plants in the New York-New
Jersey area and submit their wage
demands to arbitration.
Western Electric spokesmen said
after today's meeting that they
turned down the arbitration propo
sal because they regarded it as
"premature" at this stage of the
negotiations.

the one big dispute blocking a com
plete resumption of telephone service.
Henry Mayer, attorney for 17 tele
phone unions, told reporters the
strikers got a blunt "no" when they
offered to call off their 36-day walk
out in 21 Western Electric manufac
turing plants in the New York-New
Jersey area and submit their wage
demands to arbitration.
Western Electric spokesmen said
after today's meeting that they
turned down the arbitration propo
sal because they regarded it as
"premature" at this stage of the
negotiations.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (UP)—
A gradual return to normal tele
phone service was reported in all
parts of the Far West today as the
principal strike - supporting unions
gave up the fight, leaving the Na
tional Federation of Telephone
Workers to stand alone.
Negotiations between the NFTW
and the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company remained at a
standstill as union negotiators
awaited the reactions of the rank
and-file before proceeding further.
As the situation stands now the
NFTW is stubbornly holding out for
a satisfactory non-discrimination
clause before it will accept a PT&T
contract.
Daniel Johnston, chief negotiator
for western NFTW unions, said the
results of some week-end member
ship meetings have already been re
ceived indicating that the member
ship favored continuance of the
fight single-handedly. It was noted,
however, that this reaction was
voiccd before today's strong back
to-work movement by other unions.
Service was near normal in all
parts of the West today, except for
Oregon, Washington and northern
Idaho, but word of the ÜBTW's rati
fication was expected to speed the
return tomorrow in the Northwest.

Palo Alto telephone switchboards
have not yet Rone back to normal
operation and long distance calls are
still being handled on an emergency
basis, according to B. L. Manuel, lo
cal manager.
Manuel stated that outside plant
forces and maintenance men are re
turning to work promptly but the
union officials have not yet advised
the company as to when the opera
tors will return.
