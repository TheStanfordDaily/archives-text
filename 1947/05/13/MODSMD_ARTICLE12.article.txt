# Infants Saved By Farm Find
## 
### 
A new technique in the sterile
preparation of babies' feeding bot
tles, a preventive measure to pro
tect new-born babies from deadly
infant diarrhea, has been developed
by doctors at Stanford Lane Hospi
tal, according to Dr. Anthony J. J.
Rourke, associate professor of the
Stanford Medical School and physi
cian director of the hospital.
The technique, developed after
more than a year and a half of re
search, involves sterilizing the bot
tle after it has been filled and the
nipple covered with a tight glass
lid. This cover is not removed un
til just before the bottle is given to
the baby, according to Dr. Rourke.
Tests show that the bacterial
count under the new technique in
dicated that 62 per cent of the sam
ples had no bacteria, and the re
maining 38 per cent had only one
colony or less per centimeter, Dr.
Rourke stated.


BABIESâ€”DOZENS of them. These tykes belong to married veterans at the University of Wisconsin, Init

recent discoveries made here on the Farm by Dr. Anthony Rourke.
