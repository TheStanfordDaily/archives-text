# ‘Education Like a Rubber Ball’
## Directing Force Is Society—Bartky 
### STUART MILLAR 
(This is the last in a series of j
articles examining the educational j
beliefs of various Stanford profes
sors.)
Education goes where society ;
wants it to, declared Dean John ,
Bartky of the School of Education, j
"Many educators fool themselves
into thinking they can direct the
force of education in any direction,"
said Dean Bartky. "That is not true. (
Education is like a rubber ball. :
Thousands of pressures act upon it.
"As the needs of society change,
the educational pattern changes,
too. But we can hardly predict its
future. Therefore we no more know
where education is going than the
negotiators at the peace table know i
how the treaties will finally read."
What is going on right now is
hard enough to tell, according to
Dean Bartky. We can barely sketch
out the tendency toward vocational
education at ihc present. The great
influx of veterans anxious to start j
making livings plus the fact that the j
professional ranks — doctors, law-,
yers, and so on—are depicted, has !
#?iuscd this trend.
Trend will shift
"But just wait until the next de
pression," said Dean Bartky. "Then
the shift will be back toward gen
eral education—music, the arts, and I
literature.
"Don't get the idea that one type i
is possible without the other," he
said. "We must have both. Yes. we
must eat. But we must also know j
why we are here and where we are i
going."
Pointing further to the obstacles
in the way of a complete synthesis ,
and constancy in the educational j

process, Dean Bartky argued for
"variety in everything . . ."
"The more ideas the better," he
stated. "There are no positive an
swers to questions like whole versus
part learning or metaphysical is
sues. We can't pick one theory and
say. 'This is it.' We must allow the
conflict. That is the way education
will progress.
"We are just at the beginning of
a great experiment in education.
We must evaluate the different as
sumptions. For in all of them there
is some truth. But all of the truth
isn't in any of them."

Dean Bartky, agreeing with oth
ers interviewed previously, stressed
again the importance of individu
ality. "We can't define culture as
reading Aristotle, as Hutchins of
Chicago does. There must be wide
opportunities for varied people. But
I do say that there must be the core
of essential tools and beliefs com
mon to everybody," he said. "There
must be a common social conscious
ness."
Such a social consciousness in
America seems to be on the up-
I swing, maintained Dr. Bartky. "The
students today are much more
aware of problems around them
than their parents."
Talking about education as it ap
plies to Stanford, Dean Bartky said
that there is only one important
consideration in higher education:
the professor.
PROFESSORS IMPORTANT
"The one thing that counts in
college is the man who is teaching
the course," he said. "Frequently it
is what he says that isn't directly on
the subject at hand that is impor
tant."
Such problems as curricula, types
i of courses, and requirements arc
subordinate to the one major prob
lem.
"Survey courses arc just arbi
tary organizations," Dean Bartky
said. "It is how the man teaches it
I that makes it a good or bad course.
"That is why Stanford is rated as
| such a good school. It has the top
j men. And furthermore these men
I are able to teach the undergraduate
j students. Stanford students aren't
| limited to third assistants but can
, listen to and learn from the best
men in their Field. Not every college
I can claim this.
"A high type student plus a high
type faculty equals a great univer
sity," Dean Bartky said. "Stanford
IS a great university."

"We arc at (he beginning of a
great experiment. . . ."
(This is the last in a series of j
articles examining the educational j
beliefs of various Stanford profes
sors.)
Education goes where society ;
wants it to, declared Dean John ,
Bartky of the School of Education, j
"Many educators fool themselves
into thinking they can direct the
force of education in any direction,"
said Dean Bartky. "That is not true. (
Education is like a rubber ball. :
Thousands of pressures act upon it.
"As the needs of society change,
the educational pattern changes,
too. But we can hardly predict its
future. Therefore we no more know
where education is going than the
negotiators at the peace table know i
how the treaties will finally read."
What is going on right now is
hard enough to tell, according to
Dean Bartky. We can barely sketch
out the tendency toward vocational
education at ihc present. The great
influx of veterans anxious to start j
making livings plus the fact that the j
professional ranks — doctors, law-,
yers, and so on—are depicted, has !
#?iuscd this trend.
Trend will shift
"But just wait until the next de
pression," said Dean Bartky. "Then
the shift will be back toward gen
eral education—music, the arts, and I
literature.
"Don't get the idea that one type i
is possible without the other," he
said. "We must have both. Yes. we
must eat. But we must also know j
why we are here and where we are i
going."
Pointing further to the obstacles
in the way of a complete synthesis ,
and constancy in the educational j

process, Dean Bartky argued for
"variety in everything . . ."
"The more ideas the better," he
stated. "There are no positive an
swers to questions like whole versus
part learning or metaphysical is
sues. We can't pick one theory and
say. 'This is it.' We must allow the
conflict. That is the way education
will progress.
"We are just at the beginning of
a great experiment in education.
We must evaluate the different as
sumptions. For in all of them there
is some truth. But all of the truth
isn't in any of them."

Dean Bartky, agreeing with oth
ers interviewed previously, stressed
again the importance of individu
ality. "We can't define culture as
reading Aristotle, as Hutchins of
Chicago does. There must be wide
opportunities for varied people. But
I do say that there must be the core
of essential tools and beliefs com
mon to everybody," he said. "There
must be a common social conscious
ness."
Such a social consciousness in
America seems to be on the up-
I swing, maintained Dr. Bartky. "The
students today are much more
aware of problems around them
than their parents."
Talking about education as it ap
plies to Stanford, Dean Bartky said
that there is only one important
consideration in higher education:
the professor.
PROFESSORS IMPORTANT
"The one thing that counts in
college is the man who is teaching
the course," he said. "Frequently it
is what he says that isn't directly on
the subject at hand that is impor
tant."
Such problems as curricula, types
i of courses, and requirements arc
subordinate to the one major prob
lem.
"Survey courses arc just arbi
tary organizations," Dean Bartky
said. "It is how the man teaches it
