## 
### 
Four Alpine Club members caused
excitement in Yosemite Saturday
night when they climbed down the
face of the Royal Arch with only
flashlights and starlight to guide
them, according to Larry Taylor,
president of the club.
Inhabitants of the valley spotted
{hem and, after phoning the Ranggr
Station, rushed to their aid with all
kinds of spotlights. This help, how
ever, merely succeeded in blinding
the climbers, Taylor said.
"One particularly obnoxious fel
low got directly below us and
turned his litfht right in the direc
tion we were trying to climb," con
tinued Taylor. "We couldn't see a
thing so we yelled at him until he
left—either because he heard us or
he got tired."
Bill Kershaw, John flood, Art
Hubbard, and Taylor started tbc
1.200-foot climb Saturday morning
at 8. The trip took longer than they
expected because they missed the
right route on the way up.
At 7 p.m. they decided to turn
back without having reached the
top.
