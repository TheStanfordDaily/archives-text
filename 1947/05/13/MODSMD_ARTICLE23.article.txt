# May Issue of Chappie To Be Sold Tomorrow
## 
### 
Mystery veils the May issue of
the Chaparral as a tight-mouthed
Old Boy refused to disclose the
theme of this month's gag book. The
Chappie hits selling spots tomorrow
for 25 cents.
"Glupcrty gadle htyipoel mr sho
tiele," was all the Old One had to
say on the subject.
However, persistence paid off and
a stolen glance revealed a four-col
or cover by the Old Boy while a
bribed business staff member dis
closed that there are "5,000 pages
packed with gags, cartoons, queens,
and stories." The Old Boy may or
may not have verified this state
ment.
