## 
### JOHN TURNBLAD 
(Sec editorial, page 4)
Amid allegations that Toyon is
being overcharged for damages re
sulting from last Thursday's Jolly
Roger fight and despite demands
that a committee be appointed to
fix definite responsibility for the
affair, Toyon Club last night voted
to have a Hall committee investigate
the cost of repairing Toyon. Hall
President Bill McPherson will ap
point the committee.
McPherson reported to the hall
meeting that the University has
fixed the cost of repairing damage
from the firehose and barricade bat
tle at 5423. He added, however, that
probably a good percentage of this
figure was not for repair of the
building but was a fine designed to
discourage similar outbreaks in the
future.
CORP YARD ESTIMATOR
He stated that figure was arrived
at by the University's Corporation
Yard estimator. The Hall then voted
to have a committee of Toyon mem
bers conduct an investigation of
their own and compare results with
the University's estimate.
McPherson told the Hall men
some progress had been made in
getting Encina and Village houses
to assume part of the fine. Toyon's
share will probably come out of the
residents' room deposits, he said,
although there is enough money in
the Hall treasury to cover all costs.
The treasury belongs lo Toyon Club
as distinct from Toyon Hall and can
not be used to pay such charges,
McPherson declared.
VILLAGE MEN
Later in the meeting a motion was
mafic from the floor lo have another
committee determine who was ulti
mately responsible for starting the
fracas. Hall members declared that
a haif-an-hour before the fight
started Village men had entered the
hall and had blockaded the entrances
to keep out Encina men who were
not yet in sight.
However, strong opposition to this
measure developed when other
Toyon men claimed that all the Hall
was in some measure responsible
and that it would be impossible to
set to the bottom of the affair. The
motion was then withdrawn.
Part of the evening's discussion
dealt with ways and means of pre
venting similar occurrences in the
future. McPherson stated he had
received unofficial assurances a Row
living group would no longer send its
pledges out to capture the Jolly
Roger which has been unfurled from
a Toyon tower.
The meeting closed with McPhcr
son's admonishment that watcrbag
warriors fight their future battles
outside of Toyon's walls.

fixed the cost of repairing damage
from the firehose and barricade bat
tle at 5423. He added, however, that
probably a good percentage of this
figure was not for repair of the
building but was a fine designed to
discourage similar outbreaks in the
future.
CORP YARD ESTIMATOR
He stated that figure was arrived
at by the University's Corporation
Yard estimator. The Hall then voted
to have a committee of Toyon mem
bers conduct an investigation of
their own and compare results with
the University's estimate.
McPherson told the Hall men
some progress had been made in
getting Encina and Village houses
to assume part of the fine. Toyon's
share will probably come out of the
residents' room deposits, he said,
although there is enough money in
the Hall treasury to cover all costs.
The treasury belongs lo Toyon Club
as distinct from Toyon Hall and can
not be used to pay such charges,
McPherson declared.
VILLAGE MEN
Later in the meeting a motion was
mafic from the floor lo have another
committee determine who was ulti
mately responsible for starting the
fracas. Hall members declared that
a haif-an-hour before the fight
started Village men had entered the
hall and had blockaded the entrances
to keep out Encina men who were
not yet in sight.
However, strong opposition to this
measure developed when other
Toyon men claimed that all the Hall
was in some measure responsible
and that it would be impossible to
set to the bottom of the affair. The
motion was then withdrawn.
Part of the evening's discussion
dealt with ways and means of pre
venting similar occurrences in the
future. McPherson stated he had
received unofficial assurances a Row
living group would no longer send its
pledges out to capture the Jolly
Roger which has been unfurled from
a Toyon tower.
The meeting closed with McPhcr
son's admonishment that watcrbag
warriors fight their future battles
outside of Toyon's walls.

Amid allegations that Toyon is
being overcharged for damages re
sulting from last Thursday's Jolly
Roger fight and despite demands
that a committee be appointed to
fix definite responsibility for the
affair, Toyon Club last night voted
to have a Hall committee investigate
the cost of repairing Toyon. Hall
President Bill McPherson will ap
point the committee.
McPherson reported to the hall
meeting that the University has
fixed the cost of repairing damage
from the firehose and barricade bat
tle at 5423. He added, however, that
probably a good percentage of this
figure was not for repair of the
building but was a fine designed to
discourage similar outbreaks in the
