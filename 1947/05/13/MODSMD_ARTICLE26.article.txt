# From the Halls of Encina To the Corporation Yard; Girl Electrician keeps Busy
## 
### WELLS KEDDIE 
From sparks and kilowatts to time-cards and hours —this is
the reconversion sacja of ex-Wac Mabel "Wyoming" Adkison.
The tall, blonde co-ed has gone back to work for her old boss,
I'arm Electrical Foreman Sam Hills, but this time she isn't re
pairing electrical motors. Mabel has turned her talents to the

somewhat less exciting pursuit of
keeping time-cards for the Corp
Yard electrical department.
Mabel attracted attention during
her freshman year at Stanford in
1043—44 when she became the first
feminine electrician to replace a light
bulb in Eneina Hall. She is the only
woman voltage mechanic ever em
ployed by the Corp Yard, according
to foreman Hills, who has been at
Stanford 13 years.
Her career as an electrician was
interrupted by over tv/o years' serv
ice as a staff sergeant in the Army
Air Force Intelligence Service.
Home from the wars, Veteran Ad
kison discovered that other veterans
all male—had reached the home
front first. The supply of lady elec
tricians had exceeded the demand.
NO MORE TOOLS
Casting aside her wire-splicers
and rubber gloves, "Wyoming"
picked up pencil and paper and
went to work keeping tabs on the
men—a traditional feminine talent.
The electricians today, masculine,
have a "man-sized" job on their
hands, keeping ahead of the work
assigned to the department, Fore
man Hills declared.
Eight regular electricians, whose
time at Stanford averages 13 years,
and several students are needed to
keep things humming in the repair
shop and electrical sub-station.
The repair shop fixes approxi
mately 1,000 electric motors a year,
ranging in size from one-tenth to 75
horsepower, Hills said.
Maintenance and repair of all
electrical installations is handled by
Hills' men, including fire alarms,
class bells, lights, water pumps, and
air conditioning and ventilation sys
tems in all buildings.
Ten thousand light bulbs a year
are used to keep the path to knowl
edge well lighted—and most of
l:iem are put into Quad classrooms.
The mortality rate of bulbs in the
post-war world is high. Hills said,
due to the increased use of class
rooms.
M B STATION
The sub-station, which re-distrib
utes electricity purchased from a
commercial company, is over-loaded
at present, according to Foreman
Hills. An extensive primary switch
board controls the channels of dis
tribution to most parts ol the cam
pus, wiih a smaller, secondary
board set up to pass out electricity
to nearby buildings.
Two large generators provide di
rect current lor the experimental
and classroom laboratories, Hills
added.
"A student sleeps in the sub-sta
tion every night so that any trouble
in the primary and secondary switch
boards may be dealt with immedi
ately," the foreman declared.
Mabel has reconciled herself to
her exclusion from this technical
side of the repair shop and sub-sta
tion. As lor her time-clerking, she
shrugs:
"it's a peace-time job."

Her career as an electrician was
interrupted by over tv/o years' serv
ice as a staff sergeant in the Army
Air Force Intelligence Service.
Home from the wars, Veteran Ad
kison discovered that other veterans
all male—had reached the home
front first. The supply of lady elec
tricians had exceeded the demand.

Casting aside her wire-splicers
and rubber gloves, "Wyoming"
picked up pencil and paper and
went to work keeping tabs on the
men—a traditional feminine talent.
The electricians today, masculine,
have a "man-sized" job on their
hands, keeping ahead of the work
assigned to the department, Fore
man Hills declared.
Eight regular electricians, whose
time at Stanford averages 13 years,
and several students are needed to
keep things humming in the repair
shop and electrical sub-station.
The repair shop fixes approxi
mately 1,000 electric motors a year,
ranging in size from one-tenth to 75
horsepower, Hills said.
Maintenance and repair of all
electrical installations is handled by
Hills' men, including fire alarms,
class bells, lights, water pumps, and
air conditioning and ventilation sys
tems in all buildings.
Ten thousand light bulbs a year
are used to keep the path to knowl
edge well lighted—and most of
l:iem are put into Quad classrooms.
The mortality rate of bulbs in the
post-war world is high. Hills said,
due to the increased use of class
rooms.
M B STATION
The sub-station, which re-distrib
utes electricity purchased from a
commercial company, is over-loaded
at present, according to Foreman
Hills. An extensive primary switch
board controls the channels of dis
tribution to most parts ol the cam
pus, wiih a smaller, secondary
board set up to pass out electricity
to nearby buildings.
Two large generators provide di
rect current lor the experimental
and classroom laboratories, Hills
added.
"A student sleeps in the sub-sta
tion every night so that any trouble
in the primary and secondary switch
boards may be dealt with immedi
ately," the foreman declared.
Mabel has reconciled herself to
her exclusion from this technical
side of the repair shop and sub-sta
tion. As lor her time-clerking, she
shrugs:
"it's a peace-time job."
From sparks and kilowatts to time-cards and hours —this is
the reconversion sacja of ex-Wac Mabel "Wyoming" Adkison.
The tall, blonde co-ed has gone back to work for her old boss,
I'arm Electrical Foreman Sam Hills, but this time she isn't re
pairing electrical motors. Mabel has turned her talents to the

somewhat less exciting pursuit of
keeping time-cards for the Corp
Yard electrical department.
Mabel attracted attention during
her freshman year at Stanford in
1043—44 when she became the first
feminine electrician to replace a light
bulb in Eneina Hall. She is the only
woman voltage mechanic ever em
ployed by the Corp Yard, according
to foreman Hills, who has been at
Stanford 13 years.
