The still-unsolved mystery of the
"Mary Celeste," an American ship
"found wandering, ghostlike, without
master or crew" between the Azores
and the coast of Portugal in 1872, is
the subject of one of the books on
exhibition in the main corridor of
the library.
The exhibit, books and pictures, is
titled "America Sails the Sea."'
Clipper ships, famous naval officers
and battles, and storms and ship
wrecks of the New England coast
are some of the subjects of the
books. Others are shipbuilding in
Maine, carved figureheads, and the
history of the United States Navy.
Several picture books show vari
ous classes of ships of the Navy and
the merchant marine. And among
the large prints are "Old Ironsides,"
the Bon Homme Richard, the Mat
sonia and its sister ship, the Lurline,
and some famous clipper ships. The
exhibit is a loan from the Hopkins
Transportation Library.
