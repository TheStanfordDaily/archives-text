A new method for investigation
of the upper atmosphere has been
presented in a joint research paper
by four members of the Farm's en-
gineering department, according to
R. A. Helliwell, one of the co-authors.
The paper was read before the
recent national convention of Radio
Engineers meeting in Washington,
D.C., by O. G. Villard, who with
Helliwell, W. E. Evans, and L. A.
Manning made the research study.
One of the results of the study is
the ability to count meteors of much
smaller size than possible by visual
examination. As many as 2,000 me
teors have been counted in a single
night through the method described
in the paper.
Besides counting the meteors, it
will now be possible to learn more
of their speed and location from a
study of the ionization produced by
the meteors as they enter the
earth's atmosphere.
An interesting feature in the pre
sentation of the paper was the
playing of recorded whistles and
bursts resulting from the downward
movement of the meteors. These
sounds, which will be the means of
obtaining a better characterization
of meteors, were first observed in
America by Dr. Villard through
the use of an ordinary radio set.
Three of the men returned to
their duties at Stanford this week.
Mr. Manning has remained to visit
other universities. He will return
in about two weeks.
