# Ambitious Farm Oarsmen Prepare for Berkeley Race
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
In preparation for the Big Races Saturday over the Oakland
Estuary course, crews of the University of California and Stan
ford are working out daily. The races, to be run over a two-mile
distance, will pit Varsity, Junior Varsity, and Freshman shells of
the rival schools against each other.
Coach Lou Lindsey has been whipping the Stanford Crew

into shape during the past several
weeks, and the husky oarsmen have
responded with much enthusiasm in
prepping for the big meet against
the fabulous Bears. The Stanford
shells plan to run over the east bay
course Thursday to become familiar
with the racing area.
Lindsey has stated that "We will
definitely enter the races as under
dog, as in Cal we are meeting one of
the strongest racing aggregations in
the World. The Stanford crew has
been working hard, intent on top
pling Cal from its lofty pinnacle. To
do this we will have to row better
than we ever have before. Whether
or not the upset is scored, the In
dians will be pushing Cal all the
way."
The Farm Crew has been slowly
repairing old, and adding new equip
ment to its boathouse apparatus. Ten
new oars were recently purchased
out of the treasury fund. Through

charges, the best of an original
turnout of 160, won three races by
wide margins.
The Bear Varsity outstroked the
U.C.L.A. first shell by three lengths,
while Cal's Jayvee boat whipped the
Bruins by almost six full lengths.
The amazing Bear Frosh shell
crossed the finish line more than
two lengths ahead of a visiting San
Diego State crew in the third con
test on the afternoon's program.
All three of the races were run
over a 2,000 meter course, and all
three Bear crews ran the different
races in the same record time of
5:57. The former course record was
6:08, turned in by the Bear varsity
I in 1942.

scow now grace the harbor during
each workout session.
Dick Salsman, a Palo Alto resi
dent, has shown extreme generosity
and interest in the orphaned oars
men by donating his personal serv
ices and his motor launch each day
for the use of Lindsey and his coach â– 
ing staff in instructing oarsmen

while the athletes are rowing.
Coach Lindsey hipiself has taken
movies of each of the oarsmen in
action and has shown them while
pointing out individual errors. Late

swain's seat during practices to fur

tion. Efficient organization of shell
personnel and practice schedules has
enabled sessions to be run off
smoothly.
Across the bay, Cal's perennially
strong Golden Bears are working
out without let up, hoping to add
the Indians to their list of crew
