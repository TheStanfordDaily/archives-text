# Herbie Flam, UCLA Bruin Netmen to Invade Farm
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Herbie Flam, the one-man team
from UCLA, leads "his" Bruin ten
nis gang in an invasion of the Farm
Friday afternoon to play the Stan
ford varsity in a PCC match.
Down in the Southland, cradle of
championship tennis, Flam has
romped to victory in every colle
giate appearance. Even in tourna
ment play, the Bruin netster has
piled up creditable performances
against the leading amateur tennis
stars.
AIM FOR UPSET
One man does not make a team,
though, and the Indians are aiming
for an upset with that fact in mind.
Unfortunately, the Uclans are not a
one-man team. Flam's teammates
continue to win their share of their
matches, as witness the impressive
UCLA record this season.
Even without the services of
Flam, UCLA held the highly touted
College of Pacific team to a 4y2-all
tie. Stanford dropped two matches
to COP. 6-3 and 5-4, but both bat
tles were tightly contested. In the
final encounter, the Indians only
lost out in the final, deciding
doubles match.
OLYMPIC MATCH CANCELED
Last Saturday, the Indians found
their scheduled match with the
Olympic Club canceled. The
Winged "O" entry could not field a
complete team. A number of Club

bers were competing in the Bay
Counties Tournament in Berkeley
and could not appear on the Farm.
However, informal matches gave
the Indians some action, as they
dropped four matches to the Olym
pic Clubbers that did appear. Larry
Dee of the Club defeated Bob Lew
is, 6-1, 6-2, in the first singles.
WADE EDGES RUTLEDGE
Jim Wade applied the pressure in
the final set to squeeze out a close
6-0. 3-6, 8-6 win over Bob Rut
ledge of Farm. As usual, Rut
ledge started slow but came back
with a rush to nearly win the match.
In the other singles battle, Indian
Dave Basham lost a decisive 6-1,
6-1 decision to Ronny Edwards of
the Olympic Club. Doubles play
found Wade and Dee the winners
over Basham and Rutledge, 6-3, 6-4.
JV'S WIN, 9-0
Junior varsity activity has slowed
down following Friday's decisive 9-0
rout of San Francisco Junior Col
lege. Stanford lost only one set all
afternoon. The brilliant Indian net
ters will rest on their fine record
of only one defeat all season until a
return engagement with the Cal
JV's on May 31.
The single JV defeat came at the
hands of the California Cubs, so
revenge will be a strong motive
when the two teams clash on the
31st. Both varsity and junior var
sity matches with California are
scheduled for the local courts.

matches, as witness the impressive
UCLA record this season.
Even without the services of
Flam, UCLA held the highly touted
College of Pacific team to a 4y2-all
tie. Stanford dropped two matches
to COP. 6-3 and 5-4, but both bat
tles were tightly contested. In the
final encounter, the Indians only
lost out in the final, deciding
doubles match.
OLYMPIC MATCH CANCELED
Last Saturday, the Indians found
their scheduled match with the
Olympic Club canceled. The
Winged "O" entry could not field a
complete team. A number of Club

bers were competing in the Bay
Counties Tournament in Berkeley
and could not appear on the Farm.
However, informal matches gave
the Indians some action, as they
dropped four matches to the Olym
pic Clubbers that did appear. Larry
Dee of the Club defeated Bob Lew
is, 6-1, 6-2, in the first singles.
WADE EDGES RUTLEDGE
Jim Wade applied the pressure in
the final set to squeeze out a close
6-0. 3-6, 8-6 win over Bob Rut
ledge of Farm. As usual, Rut
ledge started slow but came back
with a rush to nearly win the match.
In the other singles battle, Indian
Dave Basham lost a decisive 6-1,
6-1 decision to Ronny Edwards of
the Olympic Club. Doubles play
found Wade and Dee the winners
over Basham and Rutledge, 6-3, 6-4.
JV'S WIN, 9-0
Junior varsity activity has slowed
down following Friday's decisive 9-0
rout of San Francisco Junior Col
lege. Stanford lost only one set all
afternoon. The brilliant Indian net
ters will rest on their fine record
of only one defeat all season until a
return engagement with the Cal
JV's on May 31.
The single JV defeat came at the
hands of the California Cubs, so
revenge will be a strong motive
when the two teams clash on the
31st. Both varsity and junior var
sity matches with California are
scheduled for the local courts.
Herbie Flam, the one-man team
from UCLA, leads "his" Bruin ten
nis gang in an invasion of the Farm
Friday afternoon to play the Stan
ford varsity in a PCC match.
Down in the Southland, cradle of
championship tennis, Flam has
romped to victory in every colle
giate appearance. Even in tourna
ment play, the Bruin netster has
piled up creditable performances
against the leading amateur tennis
stars.
AIM FOR UPSET
One man does not make a team,
though, and the Indians are aiming
for an upset with that fact in mind.
Unfortunately, the Uclans are not a
one-man team. Flam's teammates
continue to win their share of their
matches, as witness the impressive
UCLA record this season.
Even without the services of
