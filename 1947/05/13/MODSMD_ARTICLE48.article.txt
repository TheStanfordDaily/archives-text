## Halls Are Not Battlefields 
### 
Although will probably re
main a part of campus life as long as young
men live together in the confines of dormitory
life, the larger part of the student body takes
a very dim view of the water fight which took
place in Toyon Hall last Thursday night.
According to our best estimates, fewer than
a dozen Toyon men actively participated in
the watering, rock throwing, head thumping,
and general scuffling which resulted when 50
or less Encina men and a well represented
house in the Village met some place between
the first and second floor of the hall. Osten
sibly the goal of the invading freshmen was
the third floor, where, supposedly was hidden
a jolly roger. The flag had been displayed
the week before by a Toyon room in protest

to the student body referendum approving the
International Survey Committee.
The flag evidently had lost its symbolism,
and was regarded as a trophy sought by the
rival hall. Into the picture also appear a fra
ternity's pledges, residents of Encina, seeking
the flag for the "glory" of their house, and
urging their comrades into martyrdom.
All of this smacks of good, clean fun. Had
it been waged on the intramural field! For
there is a great deal of difference in chucking
a sackful of water on a man wearing a cotton
shirt and suntan slacks in fun, and destroying
University property and disturbing the rights
of non-combatants.
And we certainly are not maintaining a
police and fire department to chastise and
clean up after pranking boys.â€”B.A.
