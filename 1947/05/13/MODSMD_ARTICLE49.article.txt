# BULL SESSION

### TOM SELF 
Bull Session gets a free ride today. No sitting up
nights casting about for something cute to say. Yes
indeed, today's fun is stolen—right from the middle
of the Branner Song Book. This gem of literature,
compiled by Jane Howk and published by Joyce
Oldham, contains "Hail Stanford Hail, a couple of
the more enduring Gaieties songs, and a whole raft
of ditties extolling the merits of Branner girls. Some
of the better ones follow.
BRANNER QUEENS
By: Bonnie Moseman
Tune: Verse of "Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet"
Branner was a dormitory for the men,
'Till we girls got an invitation to come in;
We're glad to be here,
And we're proud to relate,
That our rating is the highest on the campus to date.
We've got the personality that makes us shine,
And Branner's reputation always mighty fine.
In beauty and brains, we've got what it takes,
And when we try romancing, we make no mistakes.
And a couple of verses from "We're in College
Now."
We're in college now.
We wanna be treated like we're coeds now.
We're sophisticated, and no mistake from now on,
Can stay out late, smoke with our dates, be in bed
by dawn.
Our whole life is free and easy, from now on.
For we're coeds now.
We're in Branner now,
Wanna be treated like we're Branner girls now,
But one late date, please may we state, is not enough.
To be in bed at 2:00, still bill and coo, and do our stutl,
It's hard to make him understand it's not a bluif.
That we're in Branner now.
BRANNER GIRLS ARE WE
We girls are known throughout the Farm,
Tune: "Sioux City Sue"
We came to Branner Hall one day,

Our hearts were young and gay,
And soon we all were living
The healthy Stanford way.
We rise at dawn with an awful groan,
Our eyes still tightly shut,
With gentle wox*ds and music,
We get our roommates up.
We are the girls with lots of pep,
The campus cutie pies.
We tantalize the fellows,
The way we roll our eyes.
We girls are known throughout the Farm,
As cause for Roble's 'larm
The boys just can't resist,
Our fatal Branner charm.
BRANNER BELLE
By: Fran Williams
Tune: "Rambling Wreck from Georgia Tech"
Oh the praises of the Branner belle are sung through
out the Farm,
And to the Roble roustabout she's causing great alarm.
'Tis rumored that the Branner belle is hoarding all
the fun,
'Cause with braves who know their beauties best it's
Branner two to one.
THE BRANNER GIRL
By: Donna Mozingo
Tune: "There's a Girl I'd Like to Know"
When a Branner girl walks down the street,
She looks a million bucks from head to feet.
She's got that pep, that vim, that vitality,
And when she talks to you, oh, oh, that personality.
Now there's a girl you'd like to meet.
She's got that all 'round appeal that can't be beat.
Oh the very best girls at Stanford arc the girls from
Branner Hall.
(next door to Toyon)
Are the girls from Branner Hall.
There arc more songs, but you get the idea. As
a matter of fact, you can get a pretty good overall
picture of life in Branner.

She looks a million bucks from head to feet.
She's got that pep, that vim, that vitality,
And when she talks to you, oh, oh, that personality.
Now there's a girl you'd like to meet.
She's got that all 'round appeal that can't be beat.
Oh the very best girls at Stanford arc the girls from
Branner Hall.
(next door to Toyon)
Are the girls from Branner Hall.
There arc more songs, but you get the idea. As
a matter of fact, you can get a pretty good overall
picture of life in Branner.
Bull Session gets a free ride today. No sitting up
nights casting about for something cute to say. Yes
indeed, today's fun is stolen—right from the middle
of the Branner Song Book. This gem of literature,
compiled by Jane Howk and published by Joyce
Oldham, contains "Hail Stanford Hail, a couple of
the more enduring Gaieties songs, and a whole raft
of ditties extolling the merits of Branner girls. Some
of the better ones follow.
BRANNER QUEENS
By: Bonnie Moseman
Tune: Verse of "Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet"
Branner was a dormitory for the men,
'Till we girls got an invitation to come in;
We're glad to be here,
And we're proud to relate,
That our rating is the highest on the campus to date.
We've got the personality that makes us shine,
And Branner's reputation always mighty fine.
In beauty and brains, we've got what it takes,
And when we try romancing, we make no mistakes.
And a couple of verses from "We're in College
Now."
We're in college now.
We wanna be treated like we're coeds now.
We're sophisticated, and no mistake from now on,
Can stay out late, smoke with our dates, be in bed
by dawn.
Our whole life is free and easy, from now on.
For we're coeds now.
We're in Branner now,
Wanna be treated like we're Branner girls now,
But one late date, please may we state, is not enough.
To be in bed at 2:00, still bill and coo, and do our stutl,
It's hard to make him understand it's not a bluif.
That we're in Branner now.
BRANNER GIRLS ARE WE
We girls are known throughout the Farm,
Tune: "Sioux City Sue"
We came to Branner Hall one day,

Our hearts were young and gay,
And soon we all were living
The healthy Stanford way.
We rise at dawn with an awful groan,
Our eyes still tightly shut,
With gentle wox*ds and music,
We get our roommates up.
We are the girls with lots of pep,
The campus cutie pies.
We tantalize the fellows,
The way we roll our eyes.
We girls are known throughout the Farm,
As cause for Roble's 'larm
The boys just can't resist,
Our fatal Branner charm.
BRANNER BELLE
By: Fran Williams
Tune: "Rambling Wreck from Georgia Tech"
Oh the praises of the Branner belle are sung through
out the Farm,
And to the Roble roustabout she's causing great alarm.
'Tis rumored that the Branner belle is hoarding all
the fun,
'Cause with braves who know their beauties best it's
Branner two to one.
THE BRANNER GIRL
By: Donna Mozingo
Tune: "There's a Girl I'd Like to Know"
When a Branner girl walks down the street,
She looks a million bucks from head to feet.

And when she talks to you, oh, oh, that personality.
Now there's a girl you'd like to meet.
