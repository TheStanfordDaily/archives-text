A liberal—as defined by Dorothy Thompson and
others—is a person with both feet planted firmly in
mid-air. That is certainly too harsh, but some of the
people who proclaim their liberalism most loufUy
are the ones who have brought the term into disrepute

in many circles.
They are certainly idealists—
but there are two kinds; one
reaches for the stars, without any
definite idea of how it is to reach
its objectives. It might be likened
to a man who wants to get to the
top of a stairway. All he can see
is the landing at the top of the
flight of stairs—so he rushes madly
upward, eyes on the objective,
never on his feet.
Much more intelligent is the

man who—although he wants to get to the top as
badly as his brother—keeps one eye on the landing
above and the other on each individual step as he
treads upon it. He is what might be called a prac
tical idealist, or even a progressive liberal.
At the other end of the scale is the reactionary, a
label which lias also come in for much misuse in the
past couple of decades. He can be defined as a man
living in the past; a man wanting no change what
soever, good or bad; a man who is basically an isola
tionist—or imperialist, which is merely an isolation
ist writ large.
These two major groups—'"liberals" and "reaction
aries" —are staging a world-wide battle for suprem
acy. Except in isolated cases, the "reactionaries"
are on the defensive—but the practical idealist is
caught in the middle.
Communists in the lower positions of the party
are starry-eyed idealists who come under the head

ing of "liberal." They see that something is wrong
and they want to do something about it. They accept
the Gospel according to St. Marx implicitly, without
ever seeing the fallacies on which it is based. Their
motives are the best. Their gospel has a tremendous
emotional appeal to the downtrodden.
On the other hand the "reactionaries" have noth
ing at all to offer except a return to the pre-Munich
status quo, during which Britain, France, the United
States, and others succored every two-bit strong man
who ever promised protection for their investments —
from Trujillo in the Dominican Republic all the way
up to Franco and Hitler. Their moves were governed
by self-interest alone, rather than the best interests
of the world community.
The people of Continental Europe, India, China—
I could go on—haven't forgotten this, nor are they
likely to forget it.
That's why Communism is now more powerful
than ever before. They no longer trust the countries
which, though they have spouted democratic ideals,
have practiced anything but. Communism is a straw,
and they've reached the point where they're willing
to grasp at straws.
Communism is a religion—emotionalistic and com
forting; it can't be stopped by guns, or by money paid
out as a bribe. It must be met by another ideal—
just as appealing—which is demonstratively superior.
Democracy is the answer—Democracy as it USU
ALLY works here in the United States, not as it has
been demonstrated abroad.
In the words of Jay Allen, a former foreign cor
respondent, Democracy must be made an export
product; it must be made to mean abroad what it
means at home. If it isn't, Communism or some other
such ism is a cinch winner.

caught in the middle.
Communists in the lower positions of the party
are starry-eyed idealists who come under the head

ing of "liberal." They see that something is wrong
and they want to do something about it. They accept
the Gospel according to St. Marx implicitly, without
ever seeing the fallacies on which it is based. Their
motives are the best. Their gospel has a tremendous
emotional appeal to the downtrodden.
On the other hand the "reactionaries" have noth
ing at all to offer except a return to the pre-Munich
status quo, during which Britain, France, the United
States, and others succored every two-bit strong man
who ever promised protection for their investments —
from Trujillo in the Dominican Republic all the way
up to Franco and Hitler. Their moves were governed
by self-interest alone, rather than the best interests
of the world community.
The people of Continental Europe, India, China—
I could go on—haven't forgotten this, nor are they
likely to forget it.
That's why Communism is now more powerful
than ever before. They no longer trust the countries
which, though they have spouted democratic ideals,
have practiced anything but. Communism is a straw,
and they've reached the point where they're willing
to grasp at straws.
Communism is a religion—emotionalistic and com
forting; it can't be stopped by guns, or by money paid
out as a bribe. It must be met by another ideal—
just as appealing—which is demonstratively superior.
Democracy is the answer—Democracy as it USU
ALLY works here in the United States, not as it has
been demonstrated abroad.
In the words of Jay Allen, a former foreign cor
respondent, Democracy must be made an export
product; it must be made to mean abroad what it
means at home. If it isn't, Communism or some other
such ism is a cinch winner.

A liberal—as defined by Dorothy Thompson and
others—is a person with both feet planted firmly in
mid-air. That is certainly too harsh, but some of the
people who proclaim their liberalism most loufUy
are the ones who have brought the term into disrepute

in many circles.
They are certainly idealists—
but there are two kinds; one
reaches for the stars, without any
definite idea of how it is to reach
its objectives. It might be likened
to a man who wants to get to the
top of a stairway. All he can see
is the landing at the top of the
flight of stairs—so he rushes madly
upward, eyes on the objective,
never on his feet.
Much more intelligent is the

man who—although he wants to get to the top as
badly as his brother—keeps one eye on the landing
above and the other on each individual step as he
treads upon it. He is what might be called a prac
tical idealist, or even a progressive liberal.
At the other end of the scale is the reactionary, a
label which lias also come in for much misuse in the
past couple of decades. He can be defined as a man
living in the past; a man wanting no change what
soever, good or bad; a man who is basically an isola
tionist—or imperialist, which is merely an isolation
ist writ large.
These two major groups—'"liberals" and "reaction
aries" —are staging a world-wide battle for suprem
acy. Except in isolated cases, the "reactionaries"
are on the defensive—but the practical idealist is
caught in the middle.
