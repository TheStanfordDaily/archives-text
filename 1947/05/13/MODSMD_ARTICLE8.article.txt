### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP).—
President Truman today accepted
with "deep regret" the resignation
of Under Secretary of State Dean
Acheson and announced that Rob
ert A. Lovett, New York banker
and one-time Assistant Secretary of
War for Air, will be named as his
successor.
Acheson, who plans to return to
his private law practice here, agreed
to remain on until June 30 to work
with Lovett as the latter learns the
ropes in the department's No. 2 job
—top adviser to Secretary of State
George C. Marshall and department
head in Marshall's absence.
Lovctt's confirmation by the Sen
ate seemed certain. Hq played a
major role in the Army's wartime
aviation program, and Marshall is
known to have a high regard for his
administrative abilities.
The President recalled that Ache
son repeatedly has sought to resign
for financial reasons but has con
sistently acceded to emergency re
quests that he stand by a little
longer. He was to have stepped out
on Jan. 10 under a "tentative"
agreement with the President, but
stayed on until Marshall returned
from the Moscow Foreign Ministers'
Conference.
In what may be one of his last ap
pearances at the Capitol in behalf
of the department, he met with
members of the Joint Congressional
Atomic Energy Committee at a
closed session today to discuss in
ternational controls.
Acheson, who helped prepare the
first U.S. plan in conjunction with
Chairman David E. Lilienthal of the
Atomic Energy Commission, told
the committeemen that government
officials still hope for a United Na
tions agreement that would make
world-wide controls possible.
