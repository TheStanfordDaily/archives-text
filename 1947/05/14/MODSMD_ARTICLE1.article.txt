# It's a Deal!' Tickets Sell At ASSU Offices Today For Three-Night Showing
## 
### 
"It's a Deal!," Ram's Head's traditional Spring Show opens
tomorrow night at 8:15 on the main stage of Memorial Hall.
Tickets will sell today, tomorrow, Friday and Saturday at the
ASSU offices between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., according to George
Eckstein, production manager. "There are still good seats left

for the Thursday show," he said,
"but tickets for the Friday and Sat
urday performances are going fast."
Tickets cost $1.23, 85 cents, and 55
cents.
Stars of the show, Bob Gettys,
Nancy Toll, Art Shapiro, Charles
Bulotti, and Marcie Baum, have
been spending full time on rehear
sals, readying themselves for final
dress rehearsal tonight and initial
curtain tomorrow, says Bob Ashley,
general director.
LARGE CHORUS
Chorus, some 100 strong, "has not
been napping," says F. M. Scott,
musical director and composer of the
show's 14 songs. "They deserve a
lot of credit," says he."and the au
dience will agree when they hear
the lively presentation of seven
chorus numbers."
Scott promises musical enjoyment
for lovers of the Viennese Waltz to
the most avid Stan Kenton fans.
Show orchestra is centered around
Jack Little's band.
"It's a Deal!" is a satirical investi
gation into various phases of Ameri
can economy, says Harry Muheim,
playwrite. The plot is complex,
loaded with economic intrigue, and
can not be explained in one sentence.
"In fact I sometimes think it cannot
be explained at all," says he.
CAST PARTY
Tonight's final dress rehearsals will
break at 7:30 p.m. for a cast party,
said Ashley. Dinner will be served
in the Ram's Head room.
Spring Show is one of three tradi
tional Ram's Head productions. In
fall quarter, when the focus is on
football and Big Game, Gaieties
graces the campus bulletin boards.
In winter, original one-act plays
steal the Ram's Head spot light.
"But it is May now," said Ashley,
"and the Spring Show is offered for
all around good fun and good song."

dress rehearsal tonight and initial
curtain tomorrow, says Bob Ashley,
general director.
LARGE CHORUS
Chorus, some 100 strong, "has not
been napping," says F. M. Scott,
musical director and composer of the
show's 14 songs. "They deserve a
lot of credit," says he."and the au
dience will agree when they hear
the lively presentation of seven
chorus numbers."
Scott promises musical enjoyment
for lovers of the Viennese Waltz to
the most avid Stan Kenton fans.
Show orchestra is centered around
Jack Little's band.
"It's a Deal!" is a satirical investi
gation into various phases of Ameri
can economy, says Harry Muheim,
playwrite. The plot is complex,
loaded with economic intrigue, and
can not be explained in one sentence.
"In fact I sometimes think it cannot
be explained at all," says he.
CAST PARTY
Tonight's final dress rehearsals will
break at 7:30 p.m. for a cast party,
said Ashley. Dinner will be served
in the Ram's Head room.
Spring Show is one of three tradi
tional Ram's Head productions. In
fall quarter, when the focus is on
football and Big Game, Gaieties
graces the campus bulletin boards.
In winter, original one-act plays
steal the Ram's Head spot light.
"But it is May now," said Ashley,
"and the Spring Show is offered for
all around good fun and good song."
