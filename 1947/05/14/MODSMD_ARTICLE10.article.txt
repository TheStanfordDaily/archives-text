Interviews for membership on
Cardinals will continue today and
tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m. in Martin
Anderson's office, according to Ann
Lilicnthal, president of Cardinals.
Students who will be juniors or
seniors this fall with a "C" average
are eligible to try out for the 10
vacant positions.
Six men and four women will be
chosen from the applicants, said
Miss Lilicnthal.
Miss Lilienthal urged that all stu
dents with an interest in campus
activities be interviewed for Car
dinals.
"Past experience will be taken in
to consideration, but this is not the
main consideration on which Car
dinals are chosen," she stated.
"Constructive ideas on new activ
ities Cardinals might undertake are
also desired," she said.
According to a report at Cardinal's
meeting last night, all living groups
will be contacted this week to see
if they would Be willing to support
an Alumni Homecoming Weekend
tentatively planned for this fall.
Cardinal co-chairmen of the
weekend, Bob Berryman and Evelyn
Reitze, said that President Tresid
der was favorable to the idea.
Dr. Tresidder stated, however,
that the obstacles of housing, trans
portation, and student opinion would
have to be overcome before definite
plans could be made.
The affair is being planned for the
Big Game Weekend this fall and
might include a float parade through
Palo Alto and a luncheon for the
alumni.
