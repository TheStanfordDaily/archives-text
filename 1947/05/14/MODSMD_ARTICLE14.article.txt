### 
The Old Boy, Editor F. Q. Hewitt
of the Stanford Chaparral, has an
nounced that he takes back what
he said yesterday about the May
issue of the 25 cent local funny
book. which hits the stands today.
The Old Boy has this to say:
"You've never seen so many
gags, you've never seen so many
cartoons, you've never seen so
many queens, and you've never seen
such a terrific cover." The four
color cover is by the Old Boy him
self, and is a picture of the Old Boy
himself.
The press communique from the
Chaparral headquarters last night
stated that the 44-page magazine
is laugh-packed with pictures in
cluding a cartoon center spread,
jokes, stories and queens.
"We only printed 2.000,000 copies
this month," warned money-man
Boris Wolpcr. business manager, "so
get your copy before 8:30 or they'll
all be gone."
