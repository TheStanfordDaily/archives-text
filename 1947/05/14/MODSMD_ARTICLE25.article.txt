# Cornea Is Flown To Blind Patient
## 
### 
A demonstration of the functioning
of the Stanford Eye Bank was pro
vided yesterday by the dispatching
of a cornea, needed by a blind pa
tient awaiting a corneal transplant
operation, by air to Los Angeles.
The eye was removed from a de
ceased patient at the University of
California Hospital and delivered at
noon with the permission of the next
of kin to the Stanford Eye Bank.
It was sent by air express in the
late afternoon to a surgeon in Los
Angeles.
The patient upon whom the cor
neal transplant operation was to be
performed was already in the hos
pital in Los Angeles awaiting the
arrival of the cornea. The opera
tion was to take place either late
last night or today.
The Stanford Eye Bank is located
at the Stanford Medical School in
San Francisco.
