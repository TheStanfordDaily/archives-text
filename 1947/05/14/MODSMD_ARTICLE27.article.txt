# Senate Ignores Presidential Veto Threat, Passes Strong Strike-Control Enactment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP).— Ignoring threats of a presi
dential veto, the Senate today passed, 68 to 24, a strike-control
bill banning the closed shop, jurisdictional strikes, and second
ary boycotts, and authorizing the use of injunctions in walkouts
threatening the national welfare. The Republican-sponsored bill,

piloted to passage by Chairman
Robert A. Taft, of the Labor Com
mittee, received six more votes
than the two-thirds majority needed
to override a veto which Democratic
leaders hinted is certain.
But Democratic leaders claimed
promptly that at least four or five
of the Democrats who voted for the
bill would vote to sustain a veto.
:i REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST
Forty-seven Republicans and 21
Democrats, most of them from
southern states, voted for the bill.
Only three Republicans — Sens.
Wayne L. Morse, Ore., George W.
Malone, Nev., and William Langer,
N.D. —lined up with 21 Democrats
to oppose it.
Technically, the measure goes back
to the House which already has
passed a more rigorous bill. But
Taft, anticipating the lower cham
ber would refuse to concur in the
Senate version, asked that a Senate-
House conference be called and that
Senate conferees be appointed.
Named to represent the Senate
were Taft and Labor Committee
members Joseph If. Ball, R„ Minn.,
Irving M. Ives, R., N.Y., James E.
Murray, D., Mont., and Allen J.
El lender, D., La.
BILL GATHERS EXTRA VOTES
Taft said the bill garnered two
more votes than he had expected
earlier today and six more than he
anticipated last week. But he de
clined to predict whether the Sen
ate would try and override a veto.
The Senate coalition swept the
bill to passage after crushing, 73 to
19, a milder substitute sponsored
by 11 Democrats and supported by
Senate Democratic leader Alben W.
Barkley, Ky.
