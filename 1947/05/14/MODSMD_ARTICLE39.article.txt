The Tarver Memorial Exchange ;
Scholarship and proposed pluns for
next fall's rushing schedule were j
discussed last night at the Interfra- j
ternity Council meeting, said Jeff i
Howe, president.
Exchange scholarship will be ar
ranged with the University of Lon
don providing they can handle food
and lodging problems of the Stan
ford representative, he said.
The offer is open to all Stanford
fraternity men, said Howe. Those
interested may obtain require
ment regulations by contacting
Howe at the Interfraternity Coun
cil office from 2 to 3 p.m. Wednos- j
days or at the Alpha DeJt house.
Council uÂ§ted for all fraternity j
support of the exchange; however, 1
the student chosen by London Uni
versity will live in the Row house
from which the Farm's representa
tive is chosen, said Howe.
Tentative rush plans provide for l
two or three open houses in the fall
quarter and rush affairs during the
Christmas vacation. This will give
freshman eligibles a chance to sur
vey the Row houses before the ofTi- |
cial winter quarter rush and pledge
season, he said. Final rules will lie j
set at a later date.
