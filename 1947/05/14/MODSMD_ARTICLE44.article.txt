# State May Ban Hanna Textbooks
## 
### 
A bill which would in effect for
bid the use of the "Building Amer
ica" textbooks, edited by Dr. Paul
R. Hanna, professor of education,
was favorably presented to the
State Legislature by the Senate Ed
ucation Committee.
The texts have recently been crit
icized by Aaron Sargent, Palo Alto
lawyer, as containing Communist
propaganda. R. E. Simpson, State
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, asserted shortly afterward that
he would "stake his professional
reputation" that the texts were not
"in any sense subversive."
Th" author of the bill. Senator
Jack Tenney, said it is specifically
aimed at the "Building America"
series. It does not mention the texts
directly and makes no mention of
the Communist charges, but pro
vides that no supplementary texts
shall be provided the schools until
basic textbooks in the subjects cov
ered have been provided.
