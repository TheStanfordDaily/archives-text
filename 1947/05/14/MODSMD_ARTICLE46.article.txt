# Stanford Carillion Rings For Peace, Democracy
## 
### ALLEN BLETZ 
The bells of Stanford tell a fasci
nating and moving story that began
in August of 1914, with a ringing
telephone bell. A very worried and
distracted American consul in Lon
don was calling a young Stanford
engineer.
This youthful engineer was Her
bert Hoover. Thousands of Ameri
can refugees were stranded without
money, friends, or food in strange
lands because of the devastating
war that had hit the continent of
Europe. The American consul asked
Mr. Hoover if he would help send
those desperate people home to the
United States.
Herbert Hoover did this job so
well that he was given a harder
task —the administration of relief to
the people of Belgium and Northern
France. This badly needed aid,
which began during the dark and
dreary days of the war and contin
ued through the reconstruction pe
riod of Belgium's devastate and
shattered towns and universities,
laid a deep foundation of friendship
between the two peoples.
An inscription in the Hoover Li
brary describes Stanford's bells:
''The Carillon of 35 bells in this
tower was originally cast by Marcel

Michiels in Tournai, Belgium, for
i the Belgian Pavilion at the New
: York World's Fair in 1939 and 1!)40.
| The Carillon is a gift to Stanford
| University from the Belgian-Amer
: ican Educational Foundation, with
which are associated the Belgian
j universities and educational foun
dations, recipients of endowment
funds from the Commission for Re
lief in Belgium, IEI4-1919. Dedi
cated on June 20, 1941."
Approximately five carillons were
installed here between the first and
second World Wars. Of these,
there are two on the Pacific Coast:
the electrically operated carillon of
Grace Cathedral in San Francisco,
and the carillon in the Hoover Li-
I brary Tower at Stanford.
Th<? carillon is played every
j weekend by James R. Lawson, who
studied in the tradition of Belgian
carillonneurs. The exact time of the
recital may be secured from the
weekly ' Stanford University Calen
dar.
Inscribed in Latin on the largest
of Stanford's bells is: "Pro Pace
Sono" —"I Ring for Peace." The
Stanford Carillon, glorious in all its
splendor, situated 200 feet above the
campus, stands as a symbol of peace
i and democracy.
