# Farm Mermen Smash Records
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
The existing Pacific Coast Conference 20-yard pool marks for
the 60-, 220-, and 440-yard freestyle events will go on the block
next Friday afternoon when Coaches Brandsten and Haynie's
varsity swimmers tangle with a powerful team from UCLA in the
Encina Pools. Stanford's mermen have a good reason for wanting

to break these records, for if they
do, it will probably be Ihe first tune
in Coast swimming history that a
team has, in a single season, erased
all the previous regular meet PCC
20-yard pool marks and substituted
new ones of their own.
Bob Anderson, who considerably
bettered the old PCC 100-yard free
style mark of 54.1 last Saturday,
is almost sure to break the present
PCC standard for the 60-yard free
style race which was set at 29.6
seconds by a; Stanford swimmer in
1937. Bob holds the present NCAA
record of 28 seconds flat; so should
have, little difficulty with the Coast
mark.
The existing 20-yard pool PCC
standard for the 220-yard freestyle,
which was set in 1934 by Jack Med
ica of the University of Washing
ton, could fall to either Em Cashin,
Hey Rule, or Dick Narver. All three
of these Stanford swimmers have
equalled the 2:13.3 record in prac
tice.
TAIOIJ TRIES FOR MARK
The 14-year-old record of 4:51.2
for the 440-yard freestyle event is
within the grasp of Stanford dis
tanceman Fred Taioli, who hasje
joined the squad after a week's
absence because of illness. The
present PCC mark is owned by Tom
Wiget, who set it for Stanford in
1933.
The other five PCC 20-yard course
marks fell to the Farm swimmers
during their successful meet with
USC last Saturday afternoon. The
medley trio of A 1 Weeden, Em
Cashin, and Bob Anderson turned
in a 2:51.4 performance in the 300-
yard medley to lop almost ten sec
onds off the University of Oregon's
seven-year-old record of 3:01.3.
In the other relay event, the 400-
yard freestyle, Anderson and Cashin
teamed up with Rey Rule and Dick
Narver to knock seven and four
tenths seconds from the old mark
which was set by a Stanford team
in 1937.
RECORDS FOR THE WEEDENS
Each of Stanford's Weeden Bro
thers holds a PCC 150-yard back
stroke record. Jack swam the dis
tance in the 20-yard pool last Sat
urday in 1:36.9. This figure re
places the old PCC figure of 1:38.9
which a University of Oregon swim

mer set in 1939. A week earlier, in
the Stanford-California meet, Bro
ther A 1 set a new mark of 1:37.00
over a 25-yard course. This time is
over two seconds faster than the old
standard set in the same pool by
Smith of USC in 1340.
Stanford's leading breaststroker,
Don Hester, has set two new PCC
200-yard breaststroke marks in as
many weeks. Against California,
two Saturdays ago, lanky Don breast
.stroked the 200 yards over the 25-
j yard pool course in a fast 2:2?" 3.
This figure replaces the old mark of
2:29.5 which was set in 1940 by
Stanford's Roy Vitousek. Roy's
brother Martin, incidentally, is
presently one ol Coach Tom Hay
nie's leading breaststrokers. Last
week, Don Hester switched to the
20-yard pool to set a new PCC mark
of 2:25.6 over that course.

J Sprinter Bob Anderson, for exam
ple, began his competitive swimming
career by setting national high school
marks of 17.9 and 52.3 in the 40-

; records which still stand, Bob now
I holds the NCAA 60- and 100-yard

ica of the University of Washing
ton, could fall to either Em Cashin,

of these Stanford swimmers have
equalled the 2:13.3 record in prac

TAIOIJ TRIES FOR MARK
The 14-year-old record of 4:51.2
for the 440-yard freestyle event is
within the grasp of Stanford dis
tanceman Fred Taioli, who hasje
joined the squad after a week's
absence because of illness. The
present PCC mark is owned by Tom
Wiget, who set it for Stanford in
1933.
The other five PCC 20-yard course
marks fell to the Farm swimmers
during their successful meet with
USC last Saturday afternoon. The
medley trio of A 1 Weeden, Em
Cashin, and Bob Anderson turned
in a 2:51.4 performance in the 300-
yard medley to lop almost ten sec
onds off the University of Oregon's
seven-year-old record of 3:01.3.
In the other relay event, the 400-
yard freestyle, Anderson and Cashin
teamed up with Rey Rule and Dick
Narver to knock seven and four
tenths seconds from the old mark
which was set by a Stanford team
in 1937.
RECORDS FOR THE WEEDENS
Each of Stanford's Weeden Bro
thers holds a PCC 150-yard back
stroke record. Jack swam the dis
tance in the 20-yard pool last Sat
urday in 1:36.9. This figure re
places the old PCC figure of 1:38.9
which a University of Oregon swim

mer set in 1939. A week earlier, in
the Stanford-California meet, Bro
ther A 1 set a new mark of 1:37.00
over a 25-yard course. This time is
over two seconds faster than the old
standard set in the same pool by
Smith of USC in 1340.
Stanford's leading breaststroker,
Don Hester, has set two new PCC
200-yard breaststroke marks in as
many weeks. Against California,
two Saturdays ago, lanky Don breast
.stroked the 200 yards over the 25-
j yard pool course in a fast 2:2?" 3.
This figure replaces the old mark of
2:29.5 which was set in 1940 by
Stanford's Roy Vitousek. Roy's
brother Martin, incidentally, is
presently one ol Coach Tom Hay
nie's leading breaststrokers. Last
week, Don Hester switched to the
20-yard pool to set a new PCC mark
of 2:25.6 over that course.

J Sprinter Bob Anderson, for exam

career by setting national high school
marks of 17.9 and 52.3 in the 40-

teamed up with Rey Rule and Dick
Narver to knock seven and four
tenths seconds from the old mark
which was set by a Stanford team
in 1937.
RECORDS FOR THE WEEDENS
Each of Stanford's Weeden Bro
thers holds a PCC 150-yard back
stroke record. Jack swam the dis
tance in the 20-yard pool last Sat
urday in 1:36.9. This figure re
places the old PCC figure of 1:38.9
which a University of Oregon swim

mer set in 1939. A week earlier, in
the Stanford-California meet, Bro
ther A 1 set a new mark of 1:37.00
over a 25-yard course. This time is
over two seconds faster than the old
standard set in the same pool by
Smith of USC in 1340.
Stanford's leading breaststroker,
Don Hester, has set two new PCC
200-yard breaststroke marks in as
many weeks. Against California,
two Saturdays ago, lanky Don breast
.stroked the 200 yards over the 25-
j yard pool course in a fast 2:2?" 3.
This figure replaces the old mark of
2:29.5 which was set in 1940 by
Stanford's Roy Vitousek. Roy's
brother Martin, incidentally, is
presently one ol Coach Tom Hay
nie's leading breaststrokers. Last
week, Don Hester switched to the
20-yard pool to set a new PCC mark
of 2:25.6 over that course.
MORE RECORDS
Record setting is nothing new for
j Stanford's present varsity swimmers.
J Sprinter Bob Anderson, for exam
ple, began his competitive swimming
career by setting national high school
marks of 17.9 and 52.3 in the 40-
| and 100-yard freestyle events. In
addition to these two 20-yard pool
; records which still stand, Bob now
I holds the NCAA 60- and 100-yard
marks, the NCAA 60- and 100-yard
freshman records, the PCC 100-yard
record. Over a 25-yard course, he
i holds the PCC 100-yard mark.
Em Cashin has several American
| distance breaststroke marks in the
I record books. Namely, they are for
j 400-meter, 440- and 500-yards over a
50 or more yard course.
Last February Jack Weeden
clipped five and one-half seconds
off Adolph Keifer's old American
500-yard backstroke mark of 6:14.4.
The existing Pacific Coast Conference 20-yard pool marks for
the 60-, 220-, and 440-yard freestyle events will go on the block
next Friday afternoon when Coaches Brandsten and Haynie's
varsity swimmers tangle with a powerful team from UCLA in the
Encina Pools. Stanford's mermen have a good reason for wanting

to break these records, for if they
do, it will probably be Ihe first tune
in Coast swimming history that a
team has, in a single season, erased
all the previous regular meet PCC
20-yard pool marks and substituted
new ones of their own.
Bob Anderson, who considerably
bettered the old PCC 100-yard free
style mark of 54.1 last Saturday,
is almost sure to break the present
PCC standard for the 60-yard free
style race which was set at 29.6
seconds by a; Stanford swimmer in
1937. Bob holds the present NCAA
record of 28 seconds flat; so should
have, little difficulty with the Coast
mark.
The existing 20-yard pool PCC
standard for the 220-yard freestyle,
which was set in 1934 by Jack Med
ica of the University of Washing
ton, could fall to either Em Cashin,
Hey Rule, or Dick Narver. All three
of these Stanford swimmers have
equalled the 2:13.3 record in prac
tice.
TAIOIJ TRIES FOR MARK
The 14-year-old record of 4:51.2
for the 440-yard freestyle event is
within the grasp of Stanford dis
tanceman Fred Taioli, who hasje
joined the squad after a week's
absence because of illness. The
present PCC mark is owned by Tom
Wiget, who set it for Stanford in
1933.
The other five PCC 20-yard course
marks fell to the Farm swimmers
during their successful meet with
USC last Saturday afternoon. The
medley trio of A 1 Weeden, Em
Cashin, and Bob Anderson turned
in a 2:51.4 performance in the 300-
yard medley to lop almost ten sec
onds off the University of Oregon's
seven-year-old record of 3:01.3.
In the other relay event, the 400-
