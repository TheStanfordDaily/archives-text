With a promising record of four
wins and two losses last autumn be
hind them, the Indian soccer team is
taking its task of spring practice
very seriously. More than 25 kick
men, including nearly 10 lettermen,
enrolled at the beginning of the
quarter in Coach Dave's soccer
squad and have been kicking the
ball since on alternate days of the
week.
Working hard with their feet and
heads, they are learning how to con
trol the ball on the ground and in
the air. To what end, all this trou
ble, ask many bystanders. "We wan
na beat Cal next fall,'' is the an
swer they would get if they could
hear the struggling "footballers," as
they would be known in Europe.
"My boys are coming along fine,"
announces the boy coach Dave Tap
pan, "they are going to turn into a
line team." The soccer team is the
only real international team on the
campus and draws its support from
such far flung countries as Costa
Rica, Argentina, Philippines, India,
Turkey and America. The team is
being managed by Jack Wood, who
"took care" of the team last fall
too.
