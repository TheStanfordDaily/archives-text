When EMMET CASHIN makes his racing start next Saturday,
he'll be gunning for a new Pacific Coast Conference mark in the 220-
yard free style (20-yard pool), a record that has withstood all comers
since 1931. The mark is 2:13.3, and Cashin has already broken it in
practice sessions.
Besides holding forth in the individual free-style lanes, Cashin is
a member of the 150-yard medley trio which set a new I'CC mark for
that event, 2:51.4, last week.
