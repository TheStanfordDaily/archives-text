# Eagles, Rums, Hot Shots Lead Village Bowling
## 
### JACK BATY 
With only two weeks of competi
tion left, the four village bowling
leagues are still in the midst of
tight struggles for the title. In
League One, the Wewonderifs are
still out in front, although they are
being threatened for the first time
in four months by the ex-cellar
dwelling Five Hormones. The Legal
Eagles and the Tired Businessmen
are still at it in their knock down
and drag out scrap for the crown of
League Two with the Eagles holding
a slim two point lead.
POINT SYSTEM VAGARIES
The vagaries of the point system
are evident in League 111, where the

leading Hot Shots have won two
games less than the second place
Lucky Strikes.
The Biz Bums, by upsetting the
Gutterballs last week, moved into
top position in League IV. The
Gutterballs had held top spot since
second-half competition began in
January, but are now being pressed
by the Vile Villagers for second
place.
LEAGUES END MAY 20
League competition will end on
May 20th, and the title holders from
each of the four leagues will square

off to decide which team meets the
Gutterballs, first-half winners, for
the Village crown and a share of the
$40 pot. The Gutterballs, by over
taking the Biz Bums, and defeating
the other league champs, could con
ceivably win the whole pot. The
balance of the prize money, some
$60, will be split four ways in a
special match.
Campus bowling will also end in
the next two weeks, according to
Phil Tuttle, Campus league prexy.
