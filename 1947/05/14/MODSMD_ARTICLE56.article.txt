Committing five fielding errors
and failing to time their hits, the
Indian diamond men took a 7 to 1
blasting at the hands of Santa
Clara's cellar-dwelling Broncos yes
terday afternoon at Santa Clara.
The Broncos pounded two Indian
hurlers for ten hits as they chalked
up their second C.1.8.A. victory in
ten starts. For the Indians, it was
their sixth loss in 12 loop games,
and practically eliminated them from
an outside chance to finish in sec
ond place.
The Cardinals jumped into a one
run lead in the first inning, but
after that they were able to produce
only five scattered hits. In the
fourth, they got men on first and
second with only one out, and in

the fifth they loaded the bases
again with only one out.
In neither instance were tjhe
Cardinals able to punch their run
ners home. Meanwhile, the Bron
cos were scoring twice in the third
and fifth innings, and added three
more in the seventh and eighth
frames to nail their upset victory
down.
Eldon O'Brien was the hurler
who saved the game for the Broncs
in the fifth when he came in, after
starter Galen Norquist hurt his
finger, with two Farm men on base.
He walked the next man, but re
tired the side on a strikeout and a
weak infield tap. After that, he al
lowed only two hits as the hosts
coasted to their six-run victoi'y-
Stanford errors helped the Broncs
to score three of their seven runs,
more than enough extra to hold up
against the opposition the Indians
had to offer for the day.
Christensen, first baseman for the
Broncs, slammed out four hits in

five at bats to lead the hitting par
ade for the victors, while George
Sloat got two hits in three trips to
the plate for the Farm.
