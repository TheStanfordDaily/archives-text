## Leadership Training Program Planned 
### 
To insure better student government at
Stanford next year, to provide for well in
formed student leaders, and to train future
campus officers in the techniques of leader
ship, Women's Conference is sponsoring a
leadership training program which begins to
night.
The program is divided into a general and
specific training schedule. The first part will
include three talks by Stanford administrators
concerning student government at this Uni
versity. In the second section of the program,
student groups such as the YWCA, Women s
Council, and Women's Conference will take
the members-elect and train them in their spe
cific duties.
It is important that every woman who will
hold a position of leadership on campus next
fall, whether she be a sponsor, a house of
ficer, or the chairman of an organization, par

ticipates in this program. It is the duty of stu
dents who will take over responsible posi
tions on campus to investigate their jobs and
to learn the functions of their offices before
they begin actual work.
The originators of this program plan to
build the training idea into an annual event.
If the program is successful this quarter, Wo
men's Conference hopes to incorporate men
into the training plan.
Not only newly elected or appointed of
ficers but anyone interested in learning the
duties and pitfalls of student government is
urged to attend the series of talks.
The entire program is a step forward in
building a more integrated student govern
ment. Well informed leaders can inspire
lower classmen to take part in campus affairs;
well trained leaders can make campus activi
ties run smoothly, effectively. All this adds
up to a stronger Stanford.â€”M.S.
