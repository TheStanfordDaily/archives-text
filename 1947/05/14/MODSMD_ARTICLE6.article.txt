# Farm Flax Crop To Aid Finances
## 
### 
A crop of flax, grown on 250 acres
of fields surrounding the academic
buildings on the campus, will con
tribute to the financial support of
the University this year, Alf E.
Brandin, business manager, said
yesterday.
This is tho first time flax has been
grown on the campus. Volunteer
stands of hay have been grown on
the land in the past.
Brandin stated the flax crop
would bring more money for the
Farm than has been realized in the
past on the hay, because a shortage
exists in many flax-derived prod
ucts.
"The flax needs rain badly at
present," he continued, "but if it
continues to grow as wpll as it has
so far, we should have an excellent
crop."
J. J. McNamara, Half Moon Bay
farmer, has leased the land from
Stanford on a share basis. Fred
Frehe, foreman of outside proper
ties, checks the flax stand at regu
lar intervals.
