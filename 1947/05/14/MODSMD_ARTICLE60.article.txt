Among the current display of old newspapers in
the Library is one headlined "S.F. Quake Shatters
City; Stanford in Ruins." It interests me for two
reasons. The San Andreas fault sidestep San Fran
cisco, runs out into the PaciiTc Ocean, returns to the
coast near Crystal Springs Lake, and runs in a
general southeasterly direction straight through the
Farm. And the next shift in the San Andreas fault,
said by California geologists to be more devastating
than the last, is long overdue. Pleasant morning
thought.

Two Farm couples motoring to Reno from Yo
semite stopped at the ghost town of Coultcrville for

gasoline. The gasoline station was
about as run-down and ancient as
the rest of the town, and had an
obsolete old hand pump and pre
war petrol. As the grizzled, shag
gy old attendant shuffled out of
the shade to fill the tank, the
girls asked him if the station had
a "powder room." The old pioneer
scratched his head, thought a min
ute, and replied slowly, "No,
ma'am, I reckon we don't have one
of them."
His wife then hissed at him and:
whispered in his ear. "Oh, that's
what they want, eh!" he exclaimed.

Then he directed them across the road, through the
hotel lobby, by the side entrance through the saloon,
and out the backyard to the most archaic "powder
room" extant.

New angle on the little Indian story. Someone has
added four extra pairs of feathers to one of the big
Indian stickers. Well, the old Indian chiefs used
feathers to indicate —and that's as far as I can go,
as I can see Newt's big blue pencil descending on
this copy.

Starry-eyed educators who advocate the aban
donment of football because it "contributes nothing
to the academic scene" should harken to this tale.
A Stanford girl, frosh naturally, utilized a mad
ness for football to cinch an "A" in Western Civ. It
happened that her instructor was a stickler for dates.
So she just used the football players' names and
numbers to rememher the centuries. She would
memorize thusly: "No so and so happened in the
Merriman century, and such and such happened in
the Anderson century," and so on.
She even remembered her chum's phone number
by the same method: Merriman-Titus-Merriman-
Erickson. Later she became annoyed with Erickson
(he didn't smile at her on the Quad one day), and
dropped his name. The number then was Merriman-
Titus-Merriman-two.

After glimpsing some bulging trousers pockets
around and about, the idea hit me that it might be
interesting to see whether there is more gear in a
girl's purse or in a guy's pockets. Will you all co
operate if a mug who looks vaguely like the picture
at the top of the column stops you and asks you to
exhibit the contents of your purse or pockets? It's all
in the interest of science.
