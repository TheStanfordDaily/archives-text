An item I have long had in mind is a plug for uni
versal military training. The bill currently before
Congress is not expected to pass this session. Well,
it's not an emergency situation; the rate of enlist
ments so far is keeping our armed forces up to rea
sonable strength. How long it will do so, however,
without the threat of a draft behind it, is not clear.
Nothing, I would say, could be more obvious than
that this is no time to be caught with our guard
down. (As a matter of precedent, we've always had
our guard down, but there are times when tradition
can be carried too far.)
The present plan, as I understand it, calls for
six months' training for 18-year-olds. At the com
pletion of six months, trainees have their choice of
a short enlistment in the regular forces or a some
what longer period of service in the federal reserves
or the National Guard. The ''pilot plant" set up by
the Army at Fort Knox seems to have worked, so far,
to the satisfaction of all concerned, even, more or less,
to that of the trainees. There may be reasonable
objections to a permanent, peace-time draft, but I
must say that I have yet to hear of any.
The next item is quite personal. The first time
somebody called me a Red, I thought it was a joke.
When three people in one day reported that I was
known as such, I was sorely shaken. I want to make
it clear that, whatever I may be (and I'm not sure
myself, sometimes), I'm not a Communist, I'm not a

Socialist, I'm not a New Dealer, and, as for Henry
Wallace, I don't even get a laugh out of him.
As far as national politics go, I'm a Republican;
one of the school that might be willing to vote for a
good Democrat, but has yet to find a good Democrat.
Seriously, to accept the Communist faith requires as
great a suspension of the critical faculty as it does to
join up with ''Mankind United" or any of the other
Southern California activities. A Communist is
either a fanatic, accepting the articles of his faith
just as such, or else he is a hypocrite. I had hoped
that this column would express neither fanaticism
nor hypocrisy.
What with the end of the national telephone strike
in sight, and the labor control bill just approved by
the Senate, labor is a good current topic. That labor
has the right to organize and bargain collectively is
not now to be doubted. But let it be remembered
that the rest of the country—farmers, white-collar
workers, housewives, communities, even corporations
—has some rights, too. Neither should we forget
that the rights of the individual union member may
need some protection. It is on this basis that a meas
ure of the sort passed by the Senate can be defended.
Big Business, Big Unions, Big Government all
threaten the liberty of the individual. To say, as
some do, that freedom is submission, that true liberty
is only liberty to do right, to believe the truth, etc.,
makes for an interesting philosophical-psychological
discussion; but the question, "What is truth?" makes
for one even more interesting.
