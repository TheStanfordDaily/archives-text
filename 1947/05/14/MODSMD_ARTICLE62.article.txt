(Editor's note: The letter written by Lor en
Smith which appeared in yesterday's Daily was
received early last week. II was written prior to
the To,von fight of last Thursday night and con
sequently did not refer to that incident.)
To the Editor:
Your reporter on the"I" Conference has mis
quoted Professor Vucinich as saying that "Soviet
Russia was forced into the Near East to prevent the
United States and Great Britain from expanding
their empires and endangering Russia's position."
Actually, Professor Vucinich said the following:
''The control of the Near East by unfriendly or rival
states—Great Britain and the United States—is, from
the Soviet point of view, of potential if not real dan
ger to the security of the USSR," and then added
that "None of these demands (the Straits, Kars, Ar
dahan) arc of absolute necessity to the USSR but
she is forced into the Near Eastern questions in order
to weaken what she feels is the encirclement by
Britain and the U.S. and to prevent these two powers
from enlarging their present spheres of influence."
This report would leave the impression that the
iibove statement was Professor Vucinich's opinion,

(All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num-
ber of writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable letters be short and to the point.)

while it was intended to be the point of view of the
Soviet Union.
