To the Editor:
Stanford is noted for its great traditions, but last
weekend proved that Stanford is not only proud of its
past, but also deeply concerned about its future. The
interest shown by both students and faculty for the
Conference on International Relations proved that
this concern includes not only our campus, commu
nity, and country, but also the whole world.
The only weak spot in the whole conference that
I noticed was the announcement that "there MAY be
similar conferences next year and the years to come."
Do we want to face reality only once a year and stick
our heads in the sand the other 364 days, or do we
want to take individual responsibility and promote
better relations among peoples everywhere every
day. The only way to achieve these better relations
is by increased understanding. And the best means
of increasing our understanding is by education.
Let's have more factual talks and enlightening
conferences.
