# Senate Passes Truman Bill for Foreign Relief
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP).—
Racing against the imminent threat
of famine in Europe and China, the
Senate passed the $350,000,000 For
eign Relief Bill today and prepared
for a bitter conference fight with
an economy-minded House which
has slashed $150,000,000 from the
program.
A move to uphold the House cut
was crushed by a 64 to 19 vote and
the Senate went on immediately to
approve the overall relief bill in full
by a lopsided majority of 79 to 4.
The overwhelming margin by
which the Senate endorsed Presi
dent Truman's relief plans fore
shadowed a hot fight between Sen
ate and House conferees when they
meet to work out the wide differ
ences between their separate .bills.
The House delegation was ex
pected to put up a stiff battle for its
bill, but observers believed the Sen
ate group would win back most if
not all of the cut.
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP).—
Alarmed by spreading unrest and
food strikes in western Germany,
the War Depatrment tonight an
nounced emergency measures to
rush more than 1,200,000 tons of
food into the American and British
occupation zones by July 31 to meet
the crisis.
Secretary of War Robert P. Pat
terson said regularly scheduled food
shipments to Germany are being
speeded up and increased to the
maximum extent possible to cope
with the situation and that the Ger
man food ration will be met from
here on.
He said the emergency measures
undertaken will enable the shipment
of 400.000 tons of food to the re
cently merged Anglo - American
zone this month, another 400,000
tons in June and an even larger
amount in July.
Practically all the deliveries will
come from the United States, he
said. Unidentified "other countries,"
presumably including British Em
pire territories, will supply 72,000
tons of the May shipments and
about the same proportion in June
and July.
BERLIN, May 14 (UP). —Gen.
Lucius D. Clay, American Com
mander-in-Chief, announced today
he would jail any "political agita
tor" who sought to stir up unrest
over Germany's food situation, and
repeated his warning that he would
call out his troops if necessary to
seize foodstuffs hoarded on German
farms.
As Clay issued his jail threat.
Communist party leaders in Hesse
state in the American zone, starting
to take an active part in the food
crisis, demanded the replacement of
a German food official whom they
alleged to be inefficient.
Clay warned that the food crisis
would continue three or four weeks
and might get worse unless farm
ers speeded the shipment of their
surplus stocks to markets.
His warning that agitators would
be sent to prison was believed
aimed at both left wing elements
which might seek to take advantage
of the food crisis and other Germans
who used it either to excuse their
own shortcomings or to strengthen
their political positions.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP).—
Alarmed by spreading unrest and
food strikes in western Germany,
the War Depatrment tonight an
nounced emergency measures to
rush more than 1,200,000 tons of
food into the American and British
occupation zones by July 31 to meet
the crisis.
Secretary of War Robert P. Pat
terson said regularly scheduled food
shipments to Germany are being
speeded up and increased to the
maximum extent possible to cope
with the situation and that the Ger
man food ration will be met from
here on.
He said the emergency measures
undertaken will enable the shipment
of 400.000 tons of food to the re
cently merged Anglo - American
zone this month, another 400,000
tons in June and an even larger
amount in July.
Practically all the deliveries will
come from the United States, he
said. Unidentified "other countries,"
presumably including British Em
pire territories, will supply 72,000
tons of the May shipments and
about the same proportion in June
and July.
BERLIN, May 14 (UP). —Gen.
Lucius D. Clay, American Com
mander-in-Chief, announced today
he would jail any "political agita
tor" who sought to stir up unrest
over Germany's food situation, and
repeated his warning that he would
call out his troops if necessary to
seize foodstuffs hoarded on German
farms.
As Clay issued his jail threat.
Communist party leaders in Hesse
state in the American zone, starting
to take an active part in the food
crisis, demanded the replacement of
a German food official whom they
alleged to be inefficient.
Clay warned that the food crisis
would continue three or four weeks
and might get worse unless farm
ers speeded the shipment of their
surplus stocks to markets.
His warning that agitators would
be sent to prison was believed
aimed at both left wing elements
which might seek to take advantage
of the food crisis and other Germans
who used it either to excuse their
own shortcomings or to strengthen
their political positions.
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP).—
Racing against the imminent threat
of famine in Europe and China, the
Senate passed the $350,000,000 For
eign Relief Bill today and prepared
for a bitter conference fight with
an economy-minded House which
has slashed $150,000,000 from the
program.
A move to uphold the House cut
was crushed by a 64 to 19 vote and
the Senate went on immediately to
approve the overall relief bill in full
by a lopsided majority of 79 to 4.
The overwhelming margin by
which the Senate endorsed Presi
dent Truman's relief plans fore
shadowed a hot fight between Sen
ate and House conferees when they
meet to work out the wide differ
ences between their separate .bills.
The House delegation was ex
pected to put up a stiff battle for its
bill, but observers believed the Sen
ate group would win back most if
not all of the cut.
