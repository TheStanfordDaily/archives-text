Firuz Kazemzadeh, social sciences
| graduate, spoke last night on "Sov
, iet Foreign Policy" at the Interna
-1 jional Discussion Group meeting
at Lagunita.
William Mandcl, Fellow of the
Hoover Institute, was unable to
speak due to a sudden illness.
Mr. Kazemzadeh explained the
Russian Foreign Policy as a tradi
tional policy, in that it has been pur
sued consistently and has been pro
voked by conditions and circum
stances. The immediate aims of this
policy involve the freedom of the
Dardanelles and the gain of Persian
oil. Ihe attainment of a free port
seems to be the main element of the
present Russian policy, he said.
Mr. Kazemzadeh said that Russia
j is aware of how far it can go in its
expansion. He said that Russia is
| not trying to promote major con
flicts, and is not trying to be trou
blemakers. Russia merely wishes to
get anything which comes its way.
Mr. Kazemzadeh also emphasized
| Hie importance of the influence of
the United Nations. He believes
I that there is a growing tendency
, towards centralization and that, even
il the present UN fails, the idea has
| been implanted and will probably
succeed fully in the future. He also
i believes that successful international
: cooperation can Ix? attained without
| another war.
