# ‘It’s a Deal’ To Open Tonight
## Cast of 30 and Chorus of 100 Support Five Leading Actors 
### 
"It's a Deal!" opens its three night run tonight at 8:15 on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium, said Bob Ashley, general director.
Tickets sell for $1.15, 85 cents, and 55 cents at the ASSU offices
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and tomorrow, and will be available
at the box office for each night's performance.

The traditional Ram's Head
Spring Show is a satirical investiga
tion of various phases of American
cconpmy, loaded with intrigue, hu
mor, dancing, song, and "taking a
somewhat lighter view than the
Wall Street Journal," said Harry
Muheim, playwrite.
Leads in the show, Bob Gettys,
Nancy Toll, Art Shapiro, Charles
Bulotti, and Marcie Baum, are sup
ported by a speaking cast of over
30 persons and a chorus of over
100 voices. This year's Spring Show
is the biggest ever held at Stanford,
says Ashley.
SCOTT HANDLES MUSIC
F. M. Scott, composer of the show's
14 songs, is handling the musical
direction. He promises a selection of
songs to please everyone from lovers
of the Viennese waltz to the most
avid jive fans. Orchestra for the
show is centered around Jack Little's
dance band.
The story tells of the plight of Gus,
a young down-at-the-heel, who gets
trapped in a rocket ship and lands
on the moon. There he learns the
secret of becoming the richest man
in the world.
When he returns to earth with his
secret, he and a buddy form a part
nership in the refrigerator business.
The story carries on from there, com
plicated by the antics of two young
women whose designs on Gus travel
in different directions.
MUHEIM'S SECOND SHOW
, "It's a Deal!" is Muheim's second
Stanford production, his first show,
''I'm a Strangler Here Myself,"
gracing spring quarter bulletin
boards in 1940.
The show's 12 sets were designed
by Don ShefTey, Marie Jo McGcr
bcy, and Ashley. Ashley claims the
sets defy description, ShefTey, as
technical director, retorts they defy
construction. Both agree this year's
scenes arc unusual and striking.

MUHEIM'S SECOND SHOW
, "It's a Deal!" is Muheim's second
Stanford production, his first show,
''I'm a Strangler Here Myself,"
gracing spring quarter bulletin
boards in 1940.
The show's 12 sets were designed
by Don ShefTey, Marie Jo McGcr
bcy, and Ashley. Ashley claims the
sets defy description, ShefTey, as
technical director, retorts they defy
construction. Both agree this year's
scenes arc unusual and striking.
"It's a Deal!" opens its three night run tonight at 8:15 on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium, said Bob Ashley, general director.
Tickets sell for $1.15, 85 cents, and 55 cents at the ASSU offices
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and tomorrow, and will be available
at the box office for each night's performance.

The traditional Ram's Head
Spring Show is a satirical investiga
tion of various phases of American
cconpmy, loaded with intrigue, hu
mor, dancing, song, and "taking a
somewhat lighter view than the
Wall Street Journal," said Harry
Muheim, playwrite.
Leads in the show, Bob Gettys,
Nancy Toll, Art Shapiro, Charles
Bulotti, and Marcie Baum, are sup
ported by a speaking cast of over
30 persons and a chorus of over
100 voices. This year's Spring Show
is the biggest ever held at Stanford,
says Ashley.
SCOTT HANDLES MUSIC
F. M. Scott, composer of the show's
14 songs, is handling the musical
direction. He promises a selection of
songs to please everyone from lovers
of the Viennese waltz to the most
avid jive fans. Orchestra for the
show is centered around Jack Little's
dance band.
The story tells of the plight of Gus,
a young down-at-the-heel, who gets
trapped in a rocket ship and lands
on the moon. There he learns the
secret of becoming the richest man
in the world.
When he returns to earth with his
secret, he and a buddy form a part
nership in the refrigerator business.
