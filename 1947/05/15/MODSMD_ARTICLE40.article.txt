# Farm Boasts Large 'Park'

### LYNN CARMEN 
When Jack Jensen, California's
relief hurler last Saturday turned
on a pitch and lofted it in a high
foul over the left field fence 360
feet distant, it brought into the spot
light again the fact that the Sunken
Diamond is one of the largest ball
parks in the country, major league or
otherwise.
ONLY FOtJR
After 17 years of play, only four
men have ever blasted pitches over
the tall fences, which were raised
at the cost of $1500, and of this
handful, only U.C.L.A.'s Kenny
Washington—a right handed batter
—has been able to pole one over the
right field fence.
The Sunken Diamond became that
way back in the '20's, when Stan
ford began to improve the adjacent
football field. Laid out in the form
of a horseshoe, the gridiron needed
dirt around it to build stands on,
and since dirt was too expensive to
haul a long way, Farm officials de
cided to scoop it up from the ground
nearby.
Rather than leave a gaping, use
less hole in the campus grounds, it
was decided to make it into a base
ball diamond, and accordingly, in
1924, work was begun after Coach
Harry Wolter had laid out the dim
ensions.
CiO SIGNAL
At first, however, the field was
considered too small and for three
years it was not used at all. But
Wolter finally got the go-ahead sig
nal and had the area now occupied
by the stands dug out. Play began
on it in 1931.
All the bases are solidly anchored
down with double hooks anchored in
wood several feet below the dia
mond, and none of the hooks have
had to be moved since they were
installed.
An underground springling sys
tem is responsible for keeping the
outfield and infield in superb con
dition. The grass originally planted
was a 50-50 mixture of Kentucky
blue grass and poa trivilias seed.
The tops of the slope of the banks

in the respective fields are 345 ft.
(left), 335 ft. (right), and 480 ft.
(center), while the actual distances
to the fence itself at the same points
are 360, 355 and 500 ft.
The stands can hold approximately
! five thousand fans.

of a horseshoe, the gridiron needed
dirt around it to build stands on,
and since dirt was too expensive to
haul a long way, Farm officials de
cided to scoop it up from the ground
nearby.
Rather than leave a gaping, use
less hole in the campus grounds, it
was decided to make it into a base
ball diamond, and accordingly, in
1924, work was begun after Coach
Harry Wolter had laid out the dim
ensions.
CiO SIGNAL
At first, however, the field was
considered too small and for three
years it was not used at all. But
Wolter finally got the go-ahead sig
nal and had the area now occupied
by the stands dug out. Play began
on it in 1931.
All the bases are solidly anchored
down with double hooks anchored in
wood several feet below the dia
mond, and none of the hooks have
had to be moved since they were
installed.
An underground springling sys
tem is responsible for keeping the
outfield and infield in superb con

was a 50-50 mixture of Kentucky
blue grass and poa trivilias seed.
The tops of the slope of the banks

in the respective fields are 345 ft.
(left), 335 ft. (right), and 480 ft.
(center), while the actual distances
to the fence itself at the same points
are 360, 355 and 500 ft.
The stands can hold approximately
! five thousand fans.
When Jack Jensen, California's
relief hurler last Saturday turned
on a pitch and lofted it in a high
foul over the left field fence 360
feet distant, it brought into the spot
light again the fact that the Sunken
Diamond is one of the largest ball
parks in the country, major league or
otherwise.
ONLY FOtJR
After 17 years of play, only four
men have ever blasted pitches over
the tall fences, which were raised
at the cost of $1500, and of this
handful, only U.C.L.A.'s Kenny
Washington—a right handed batter
—has been able to pole one over the
right field fence.
The Sunken Diamond became that
way back in the '20's, when Stan
ford began to improve the adjacent
football field. Laid out in the form
of a horseshoe, the gridiron needed
dirt around it to build stands on,
and since dirt was too expensive to
haul a long way, Farm officials de
