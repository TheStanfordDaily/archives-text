# 5,000 Fans Won't Forget One Sunny Day in April

### TOM BURDICK 
One sunny, windy, early spring afternoon in April 1940, 5000
spectators gathered at Edwards Stadium, Berkeley to view a
triangular track and field meet between the Universities of Cali
fornia and Washington and the San Francisco Olympic Club.
Competition in every event was grade "A" that day, but none

more keen than the efforts of the |
athletes at the pole vault pit. Three
men had already topped 14 feet and
were vaulting at 14:5. The slim,
sinewy, (5 ft. 168 pound entry rep
resenting the' Olympic Club cleared
the bar with ease on his first attempt,
but the above height proved too
■ much for his erst-while equals. Bud
Deacon, former Stanford great and
Cal's Guinn Smith.
RAISE STANDARDS
Fourteen feet 8 in. hardly fazed
the ex-Fresno State collegiate, and
the bar was consequently moved to a j
i measured 15 ft. even, one inch higher !
j than the existing world's standard j
I held jointly by USC's "heavenly
twins," Bill Sefton and Earle Mea
dows. The first try was ever-so
close and apparently gave him the
needed confidence for the roar from
the stands indicated his second at
tempt was nothing but successful.
Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam,
there and then, became the first and
as yet, only man to vault 15 feet in
track and field history!
HOLDS NO TERROR
Since that time this height, con
sidered by many experts to be al
most in the same classification as the
9 second hundred or the 4 minute
mile, has held little terror for
"'the flying Dutchman." A quick
glance at the record book reveals
that Warmerdam has scaled it no
less than 43 times. Included in these
40 odd "ascensions" are two per
formances of exceptionally note
worthy character. At Modesto in
1942, "Dutch" set the current world's
record (Outdoor) of 15 .ft. 7■ i 4 in.,
while a year later in Chicago Sta
dium (Indoors), he soared 15 ft.

B'/j in., the absolute zenith in pole
vaulting annals.
Warmerdam started his vaulting
career in grammar school, not
through any hero worship of a star
of the day but principally because
as he puts it"the facilities were
right there." His ascendance to the
top was not meteoric, but slow and at
times not very steady. He was no
high school sensation, taking his
lumps as they came when anybody
could top his best'of 12 ft. College
added a little over 2/- feet to his
high school mark.
GRADUATE WORK HERE
"Dutch" finished his graduate
work in education here at Stanford
and his first job consisted of both
teaching and coaching at Tuolumne
High, near Sonora, Calif. From there
he moved to Piedmont High School,
where he fulfilled the same duties,
before entering the Navy as a Phy
sical Instructor under the V5 pro
gram in 1943. Discharged in Decem
ber of '45, "Dutch" labored at ranch
ing until accepting his present posi
tion as Stanford's Asst. Track and
Field Coach in the Fall of last year.
Married and the father of three
children, Warmerdam is well set
tled, does little vaulting except an
occasional exhibition. Although

tabbed by many experts as still the
nation's best, he apparently won't
be eligible for the 1948 Olympic
Games in London as his coaching vo
cation has stamped him with the
yellow stains of professionalism.


CORNELIUS WARMERDAM, Stanford's Assistant track and field
Coach, is shown above demonstrating the form (hat lias made him with
out question the world's greatest pole vaulter. "Dutch" is the first and
only person to successfully c4ear 15 ft. or better, a fe;>t he has accom
plished no less than 415 times. —Fnoto by Phil Welch....
