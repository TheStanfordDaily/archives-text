# Netters To Face Bruins
## 
### 
Still searching for their first FCC
net win, Stanford's varsity tennis
players run into an angry UCLA
Bruin team on the local courts to
morrow. Action starts at 1:30 p.m.
HOPES HIT
The Bruins were unceremoniously
dumped from the undefeated ranks
two weeks ago by the title-bound
USC netters. Down Westwood way,
spirits were high for a championship
squad until the Trojans knocked the
Bruins over.
Thus UCLA will roar into town
with revenge in mind. The innocent
Indian netters will be on hand, so
they'll probably receive the brunt
of the Bruin's wrath. UCLA is still
trying to keep pace with the men
of Troy.
INDIANS UNDERDOGS
Stanford rates the under-dog role
tomorrow, chiefly because of Her
bie Flam. The fair-haired boy in
Bruin tennis has been winning
championships since he was 11 years
old. He now holds the National
Junior singles title for the second
year in a row.
Flam and team-mate Gene Gar
rett walked off with the famous
Ojai tennis tournament this year.
Herbie took the singles title by drop
ping A 1 Larsen of College of Pacific.
Then he teamed with Garrett to whip
the COP duobles team of Druliner
and Pfister in the finals, 6-3, 6-3.
TROY COLLECTS
USC dropped the Bruins by a G-3
count, but only by sweeping the
lower bracket matches and the dou
bles. First three singles went to the
torrid Bruins wno were impressive
even in defeat.
This weakness in lower bracket
singles and doubles may offer a pos
sible upset to the hustling Indian
netters. All season. Stanford has
dropped the top slot matches only
to even up the count in the lower
place battles.
