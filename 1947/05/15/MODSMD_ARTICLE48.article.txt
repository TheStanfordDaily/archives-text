## A 						Practical Plan 
### 
j A letter in yesterday's Campus Opinion
about the Conference on International Rela
tions held last week-end, stated, in part:
"The only weak spot in the whole confer
ence that I noticed was the announcement
that 'there may be similar conferences next
year and the years to come.' Do we want to
face reality only once a year and stick our
heads in the sand the other 364 days, or do
we want to take individual responsibility and
promote better relaiions among peoples every
where every day .... Let's have more factual
talks and enlightening conferences."
Members of the Conference committee and
the Institute of International Relations are
quite conscious of this need and have envis
ioned a larger session which would include
most of the student body and faculty.
Such plans will need very active support —
not just passive support —from members of
the Administration and the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises, and most definitely from Excom
and other student organizations.
Thus far support from these groups has
been quite good, but if there are to be "more
factual talks and enlightening conferences"
then the support will have to be much greater
than it has been.
A suggestion has been made to the lIR
that speeches given at the recent Conference
be printed in pamphlet form for distribution
in hope of increasing interest in the confer
ence. This is one practical way of making sure
that the thoughts expressed at the conference
are remembered longer than the short space
of the actual sessions.
This idea and others might be adopted by
the conference committee in an effort to keep
the interest in internationalism at as high a
level as possible.
Original plans for the conference called for
it to be held during the week rather than on
a week-end. These plans had to be changed
because of scheduled classes.
However, since attendance indicated such
a strong interest in the first conference, there
may be ample justification for cancelling some
classes during the middle of the week. Such
scheduling would assure even greater attend
ance than can be guaranteed over a week-end.
The conferences are designed to interest
people in internationalism. Every possible
obstacle blocking this end should be removed

if the conferences are to have the desired
effects. mm
