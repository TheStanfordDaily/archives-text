# To Make Use of ‘T’ Groups

Plans for furthering interest among women
students in campus international activities
without setting up any additional international
agencies have been discussed at meetings of
Women's Conference Advisory Board. Their
ideas, although still in the indefinite, planning
stage, will be presented to Women's Confer
ence today.
One part of the program would be to have
information submitted to Conference, taken
back to house meetings, and given to all wo
men, on what the present international groups
• are doing that would be of primary interest
to the women. We suggest a committee of
three Conference members or a sub-commit
tee of Conference (not Conference members)
would be the most effective and responsible
way of carrying out such a program.
It would be the committee's duty to keep
informed at all times of the activities of the
international groups and bring to Conference
each week a report on things the women
would be most interested in, like jobs and
educational opportunities abroad and campus
international groups that need workers. In
short, it would inform the women and try to
interest them on a more personal basis in
activities few of them are now interested in.
The same committee could take charge of
the second and third phases of the program.
It could contact all girls who are making youth
hostel trips this summer so they could tell
their experiences to the women next fall in
various living groups and at Conference meet
ings. The hostelers could interest other girls
in making such a trip.
The committee could bring the foreign
women on campus into our international pro
gram by arranging for them to have dinner
and lunch at various living groups, talk of
their experiences in house meetings and at
Conference, and become better acquainted
with Stanford student government and activi
ties through the other two functions.
Advisory Board's plan has many possibili
ties and should be considered seriously by the
entire Conference. If such a plan could be
O.K.'d today, enough work could be done on
it this year so that next year's Conference
would have something definite to go on.—N.B.
