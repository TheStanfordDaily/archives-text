### DAN ENDSLEY 
The Army asked for permanent conscription of
some sort long, long ago, but nothing has been done
about it. The various public opinion polls have shown
that a majority of the people of this country are be
hind such a program but Congress, always with an
eye to political consequences, has continued to sit on
its big fat collective chair and ignore the whole
question.
It seems apparent that nothing will ever be done
about maintaining an adequate military force if it
is left to the Congress to do. The men on Capitol
Hill will always be swayed by the plaints of mothers
who cry, "I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier." Their
arguments arc emotional and without regard to the
best interests of the country.
Other lobby groups with less pure motives and
who owe their allegiance to foreign governments are
only too happy to assist.
Right now the Army and Navy are doing all right
with their voluntary enlistment programs. The late
war seems glamorous to many of the youngsters who
wore too young to participate; they are easy meat for
the recruiters. Others are giving up part of their
lives deliberately in order to qualify for a college
education under the GI Bill—boys who otherwise
would have to be content with a high school diploma.
But both of these things are temporary; the tar
nished aura of glamour will not last forever—and the
GI bill will undoubtedly be legislated out of exist
ence before long. There have already been protests
about the billions of dollars which must be appro
priated for the Veterans Administration each year.
There seems to be but one possible course for the
Army to take: namely, to forget about universal
conscription and make the temporary university
using the old Navy buildings at Farragut, Idaho—or
some other former service installation—a permanent

government instituiton, as a permanent recruiting
argument. Although there is little chance of a con*-
scription bill passing Congress, there is a good chance
that such an undertaking would be approved.
Farragut is a big place, and eventually it should
be able to handle almost any discharged serviceman
who wants a college education. By consolidation,
expenses could be kept down. Even at the present

time, a student at Farragut can get
housing for as little as $9 per
month, which is somewhat less
than any Stanford student is pay
ing.
Granted, there would be a bit of
the regimented life of the Army
about the place—but it WOULD
be a university which could offer
much to those unable to pay their
own way. That's the important
thing; a higher education should

be avadable to any person who desires it.
Also—the armed forces of the United States would
have an adequate reserve with which to meet any
emergency which may arise—as they did not in De
cember, 1941. Eventually all national military forces
should give way to an international police force, but
the time is not yet. It's desirable even now, of course,
but any nation which voluntarily gave up its military
forces at present would undoubtedly be the greatest
sucker of all time.
This suggested permanent university at Farragut
would serve two purposes. When the GI Bill is ter
minated, it would keep the services from being
robbed of their greatest selling points in their re
cruiting campaigns—and it would also make an
education possible for many young men who other
wise would go without.
