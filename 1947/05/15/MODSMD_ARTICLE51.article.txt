''All letters should be addressed to the editor,

it is desirable letters be short and to the point.)

To the Editor:
The reactions, so generally favorabje to the tech
nical aspects of performance in Saturday night's in
terpretation of Sartre's "No Exit," and so patroniz
ingly condemnatory of what was considered to be the
"confused thought" of the play, are at once a measure
of the rationalist presuppositions of the American
culture, and an ironic aside on the philosophic cir
cumscriptions of its present educational machines.
When the most lucid comments to be heard in the
amused post-mortems were that the drama should
have been resolved, or that while interesting it
lacked point, it is about time for a few Shrikian ex
pletives and well-chosen obscenities.

To the Editor:
The recent Labor Day and campaign in behalf of

the Stanford Convalcsccnt Home was unusually suc
cessful. and our Board of Directors wishes to thank
all the students who made this possible. As the num
ber is large, I am writing this with the hope that you
will find a place for it in the Stanford Daily, that all
who contributed to the Home will know how much
their help is appreciated.
Thus far it has been possible to continue our op
erations without reducing the number of children in
the Home, in spite of constantly increasing costs. The
generous help which we have received from the
Stanford student body will enable us to continue on
this same basis for the immediate future, and I hope
it will be as much satisfaction to the donors as it is
to the recipients.
Very sincerely yours,
J. P. Mitchell
