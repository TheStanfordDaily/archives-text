# Mrs. Archibald Writes Study of Social Disunity
## 
### MARGIE SAMPSON 
During the war Californians, in
San Francisco and Los Angeles es
pecially, came to recognize the ship
yard worker by his disheveled look,
and his appearance at any time of
the day or night as he came off
work. Gangs from the swing and
graveyard shifts ate meals at all
hours, and became accustomed to
living a backward schedule that
called for dinner in the morning
and breakfast at night.
Katherine Archibald, history in
structor at Stanford, wrote about
these people in her book "Wartime
Shipyard, A Study of Social Dis
unity."
WORK IN SHIPYARDS
Mrs. Archibald, then Katherine
Oakes, went to Moore Drydock in
1942 to get practical experience in
facing the social problems of' the
United States. Until her work in
the shipyards, Mrs. Archibald had a
knowledge of the problem gained
only in libraries and in talking with
other people.
Taking the advice of Professor
Paul Taylor, she went to work in
the shipyards to see the social prob
lems at work. She entered the ship
yards, an academician in a practical
world, as a New Dealer who be
lieved strongly in organized labor
and sympathized with racial mi
norities. From her experiences in
the shipyard she wrote her book.
MAJOR PROBLEM
One of the major problems of the
wartime shipyards was one Mrs.
Archibald came in contact with as
soon as she started working. At the
Moore Drydock as a storekeeper
expediter, warehouse clerk, and
member of the AFL, she had to de
fend her sex.
Women never quite belonged in
the shipyards, and as a consequence
they had to fight against the preju
dice, sometimes warranted, of the
men. The old-timers resented them
and would not admit that they were
of any use in the shipyards. Others
took advantage of their presence,
and there were whispered rumors
of scandal.
Women were for the most part
refused full membership in the un
ions, usually given only second
class membership.
PREJUDICE AGAINST OKIES'
"Okies" also came in for their
share of the attention in Katherine
Oakes' book. Prejudice against them
grew up in the shipyards, and they
were often made the objects of bit
ing jests. They had an advantage
over women and Negroes, though,
because they had the best chance of
losing their trademarks.
Katherine Oakes described in her
book all the prejudices and social
problems in the wartime shipyards.
"Wartime Shipyard" shows the so
called "minorities" in conflict with
themselves and the majority group
as the basis of these problems,
though it does not give the solution.
