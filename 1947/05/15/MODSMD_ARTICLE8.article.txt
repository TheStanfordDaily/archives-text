# GOP Portal Bill Signed By Truman
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP).—
President Truman overrode the
! protests of organized labor and his
! own Labor Secretary today and
[ signed the Republican - sponsored
' bill outlawing practically all past,
I present and future portal-to-portal
I pay claims.
He explained in an unusual mem
i orandum to Congress that he acted
I in the firm belief that the $6,000,-
000„000 bugaboo of portal suits now
, pending in the courts must be done
away with to help restore economic
stability and clear the way for full
i production and lower prices.
Al. the same time, he called upon
Congress to balance this legislation
boon to business with an immediate
increase in the statutory national
minimum wage from 40 to at least
05 cents an hour.
Aware that his approval of the
controversial measure might bring
threats of political reprisals from
some sections of organized labor,
the President went to great lengths
to stress his conviction that it would
not jeopardize the rights won by
labor during the New Deal regime
of the late President Roosevelt.
He said he did not believe Con
gress intended by this law to de
stroy labor's gains. But if the act
should work in that direction, he
promised, "I shall request the Con
gress to take prompt remedial ac
tion."
But Mr. Truman was emphatic in
his belief that the good effects of
the law would outweigh its poten
tially bad ones. Specifically, he
said, it should speed a satisfactory
settlement of current wage negotia
tions, and enable business to "plan
with assurance for full production
and price redictions."
"This will be of real value to labor
and management in the mainte
nance of a continued high level of
employment," lie said.
In that, he differed sharply with
Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach, who has fought the
bill on the grounds that it would
undermine the whole framework of
New Deal labor legislation built up
during the past 15 years.
The politically potent CIO un
ions, which instituted most of the
portal suits, also were bitterly criti
cal of the bill as a blow at labor.
