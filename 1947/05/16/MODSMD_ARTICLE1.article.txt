# It's A Deal' Opening Termed Good; Small Crowd Lauds Comedy As Hit
## 
### STU FITCH 
"It's a Deal!," Harry Muheim's salire on big business, opened
its three night run last night before a small but enthusiastic
audience, which went out of Memorial Auditorium with the
opinion "It's a Deal!" was a darned good deal.
First night bungles, mainly technical, were smoothed over by

cast showmanship, precision timing,
and tireless direction by Bob Ashley,
general director.
Spring Show, a traditional Ram's
Head production, will run again to
night and tomorrow night at 8:15.
Tickets sell for $1.15, 85 cents, and
55 cents at the ASSU office and the
box office before each performance.
It is hard to place a finger on just
what made the show a hit. Lead
players Bob Getty, Art Shapiro,
Nancy Toll, Charles Bulotti, and
Marcie Baum were supported by an
enthusiastic, well directed chorus.
SCOTT COMPOSED ALL
Backing them all was the orchestra
under the direction of F. M. Scott 111,
composer and arranger of the show's
songs, which aimed to please music
lovers from Viennese fans to the
most avid jive fiends; the chorus
even throwing in a touch of Gilbert
and Sullivan with the repeating
theme "Hooray fer Woodbridge,"
and "I'm a Self-Made Man."
Gettys as Gus and Miss Toll as
Mary Ann did an excellent job in
their ballads, "Gee, But It's Nice in
Vermont," "Theres Nothing in the
Universe Like You," and "You Arc
Here.
Shapiro, as Eddie Martin, turned
out laughs as he pranced around
stage in a loud coat and straw hat,
markedly resembling the antics of
Jimmic Durante.
The laugh song of the evening was
(he sexy rendition of "Whatever It
Is, I've Got It." by Marcie Baum.
In her first appearance on stage, Miss
Baum kept herself and the audience
guessing by pacing around stage in
a black strapless that did not want
to behave.
STAR A MACHINE
The real star of the show was not
a human, but a machine—the Final
izer, which served as the brains of
business deals, and showed a re
markable sense of human under
standing.

STAR A MACHINE
The real star of the show was not
a human, but a machine—the Final
izer, which served as the brains of
business deals, and showed a re
markable sense of human under
standing.

in the Memorial Auditorium. "Deal" features 11 songs and a east' of more than 100.

"It's a Deal!," Harry Muheim's salire on big business, opened
its three night run last night before a small but enthusiastic
audience, which went out of Memorial Auditorium with the
opinion "It's a Deal!" was a darned good deal.
First night bungles, mainly technical, were smoothed over by

cast showmanship, precision timing,
and tireless direction by Bob Ashley,
general director.
Spring Show, a traditional Ram's
Head production, will run again to
night and tomorrow night at 8:15.
Tickets sell for $1.15, 85 cents, and
55 cents at the ASSU office and the
box office before each performance.
It is hard to place a finger on just
what made the show a hit. Lead
players Bob Getty, Art Shapiro,
Nancy Toll, Charles Bulotti, and
Marcie Baum were supported by an
enthusiastic, well directed chorus.
SCOTT COMPOSED ALL
Backing them all was the orchestra
under the direction of F. M. Scott 111,
composer and arranger of the show's
songs, which aimed to please music
lovers from Viennese fans to the
most avid jive fiends; the chorus
even throwing in a touch of Gilbert
and Sullivan with the repeating
theme "Hooray fer Woodbridge,"
and "I'm a Self-Made Man."
Gettys as Gus and Miss Toll as
Mary Ann did an excellent job in
their ballads, "Gee, But It's Nice in
Vermont," "Theres Nothing in the
Universe Like You," and "You Arc
Here.
Shapiro, as Eddie Martin, turned
out laughs as he pranced around
stage in a loud coat and straw hat,
markedly resembling the antics of
Jimmic Durante.
The laugh song of the evening was
(he sexy rendition of "Whatever It
Is, I've Got It." by Marcie Baum.
In her first appearance on stage, Miss
Baum kept herself and the audience
guessing by pacing around stage in
a black strapless that did not want
to behave.
