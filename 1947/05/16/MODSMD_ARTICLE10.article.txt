### 
WASHINGTON, Friday, May 16
(UP).—Leaders of striking Western
Electric: workers today canceled an
earlier order for withdrawal of their
picket lines around local telephone
company buildings.
The order for removing the pick"!
lines was issued late Thursday night
by Ernest V/eavcr of the strik
ing Association of Communication
Equipment Workers. It immedi
ately raised hopes for resumption of
normal telephone service in sections
of the country where other wage
disputes had been settled.
But a few hours later, N. L. Wolf,
ACEW strike director, announced
that the union's executive board had
decided to rescind the order.
"We decided it was premature,"
Wolf said.
Immediately after the withdrawal
order went out, calls of protest came
in from union officials all over the
country. The board thereupon went
into session, he said, and decided
to keep its picket lines up until a
wage agreement with Western Elec
tric was reached in the negotiations
now under way here.
The ACEW and the other striking
Western Electric union—the West
ern Electric Employees Association
—engaged in long bargaining ses
sions with the company tonight, but

failed to reach any agreement. The
parleys will resume tomorrow.
