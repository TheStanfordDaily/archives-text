# Three-fold War Memorial Plan Gets Farm Trustees' Go-ahead
## Book Will Commemorate Dead; Approve Scholarships for Kin 
### JACKIE WOOLF 
A throe-fold war memorial was approved yesterday by the
Stanford Board of Trustees at its regular meeting in San Fran
cisco. The plan for this memorial was recommended by the War
Memorial Committee after careful research. The main part of the
plan for commemoration of Stanford war dead will be a memor-

ial book, to be publicly displayed,
containing the names and a brief
statement of record of each Stanford
man or woman who lost his life in
World Wars I and II and the Spanish
American War. Whether one or
more books will be necessary de
pends upon the number of names,
according to Paul C. Edwards, mem
ber of the Board of Trustees and
chairman of the War Memorial Com
mittee.
SCHOLARSHIPS TO BE GIVEN
Second part of the plan approved
by the Trustees is the recommenda
tion that children of casualties of
World War II be given frae, four
year scholarships at Stanford if they
can meet the minimum requirements.
Also approved was the plan that
the names of World War II war dead
be inscribed in the foyer of Memorial
Auditorium in a manner similar to
the display there of names of vie
tims of World War I.
Although a student poll revealed
that the majority favored a new
student union as a fitting memorial
for World War 11, investigation by
the committee revealed that a plan
necessitating raising of considerable
amount of money was impractical at
this time. According to committee
members, a contribution drive at
this time would only divert neces
sary donations from other worthy
causes at Stanford. As students are
still paying for the war memorial of
World War I, student support in
raising funds for this memorial is
impossible.

Committee making the recommenda
tions were Paul C. Edwards, chair
