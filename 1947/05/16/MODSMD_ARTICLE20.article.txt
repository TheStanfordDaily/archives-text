# Wallace Attacks U.S. Reactionaries
## 
### 
DETROIT, May 15 (UP).â€”Henry
A. Wallace charged tonight that
"the Truman doctrine is the strong
est weapon that Communism was
ever given." s
The barnstorming former Vice-
President continued his round-the
world crusade against "military"
loans to Greece and Turkey at ;i
rally sponsored by the Michigan
Citizens' League at the Masonic
Temple.
Wallace claimed that the doctrine
was "born in fear and bred in fear"
and that it not only would weaken
England and France but delay social
reform programs in the Scandina
vian countries he visited on his Eu
ropean tour.
He said he was "thoroughly afraid
that American reactionaries in their
blind hatred of Russia are on the
way to uniting the world against the
United States."
"If Communism is a menace, then
give the people proof in terms that
they understand, instead of arousing
hatred and hysteria.
"If Russia does not want to co
operate with America in solving the
problems outstanding between us,
then give the people proof by hon
estly trying to meet with the Rus
sians and talking over all our prob
lems," he said.
