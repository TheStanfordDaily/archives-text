# Senate Rallies Union Bill Vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP).â€”
Chairman Fred A. Hartley, R., N.J.,
of the House Labor Committee
raised the prospect today that the
Senate and House conferees will
produce a compromise union-con
trol bill that will win enough sup
port to override a presidential veto.
The sponsor of the drastic House
approved bill predicted the House
agents would surrender to Senate
demands and drop their amendment
outlawing industrywide bargaining.
This is a major obstacle to working
out differences between the Senate
and House versions.
But the real problem, Hartley
said, is to draft a compromise that
not only will be accepted by the
Senate but which will survive a
veto with the support of the neces
sary two-thirds of that chamber.
He said there is no question that
the House can override a veto and
therefore the House conferees are
keeping uppermost the Senate's
probable reaction to the final draft.
The Sonate version barely mentions
industrywide bargaining.
President Truman was sounded
out at his press conference on the
possibility of a veto. He was asked
whether he thought additional labor
legislation was needed beyond the
bill outlawing portal pay suits which
he signed yesterday.
The President replied that he
would stand on the recommenda
tions made in his State of the Union
message to Congress in January. At
that time he called only for in
creased minimum wages and elimi
nation of jurisdictional strikes and
secondary boycotts.
