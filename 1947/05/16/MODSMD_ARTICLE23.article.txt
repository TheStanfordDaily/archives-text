# New Italian Premier Will Be Named Today
## 
### 
KOME, May 15 (UP).â€”President
Enrico de Nicola announced tonight
that he would name a premier to
head Italy's third republican gov
ernment tomorrow.
Political observers believed it was
almost certain that Alcide de Gas
peri, who resigned two days ago
because of leftist opposition to his
financial policy, would be named
again.
He was premier of the two pre- |
vious republican governments and i
held the post once before there- j
public was formed 11 months ago. |
