# PJ-clad Gals Flee Fire; Newborn Kitten Blushes
## 
### TOM SELF 
After chasing fire engines around the campus for six quarters,
we finally found a real fire. We were returning home from a mid
night snack at Marquard's after putting the Daily to press, and
there it was.
As we rounded the Post Office corner, we spotted the red
lights of the fire equipment in the*

mc.i of the Sigma Chi and Russell
bouses. Right off we knew it could
not be a ,false plann or a trash
barrel fire —that's Encina stuff. So
we raced to the scene.
Just as we got there, the girls, all
vented "" the. front porch, were
singing "1 Don't Want to Set the
World on Fire." A neighbor wan
dered onto the scene, still brushing
hi;. te"th. No one seemed very much
concerned.
We meandered inside to find the
fire, which we thought was in the
kitchen. The house mother, al
though badly flustered by all the
excitement, still had the presence of
i.iind to throw us out the back door.
Thei ■■ we saw that the fire could
very well have been a serious one.
]i the Sigma Chi's had not spotted
the flame the instant it broke out
;md rushed to the scene with fir"
extinguishers, the house would
probably have been ablaze.
RED-BLOODED FRAT
All of the Sig Chi's who partici
} a ted in the action desired to re
main anonymous, - saying, "Shucks,
any red - blooded fraternity man
would have done the same."
Pocause we have heard so much
moaning and groaning about fire
drills, v/e decided to find out if the
• iris thought the fire drills were
any help. They said that there was
no panic, but they admitted there
was some confusion in that they all
went out th" wrong exits. This was
due in part to the fact that some
of them had changed rooms, and by
force of habit went out the old way.
C'ii!y a few remembered to use the
fire escape.
Other girls said the reason there
was no confusion was that they
were all too sleepy. This sentiment
was echoed by Nancy Draper, who
said she had a devil of a time get
tin! everyone up and convincing
them it was a genuine fire. She rang
the bell like mad but everyone as
sumed it was a prank. Another
pirl thought the Sig Chi's were hav
ing a weenie bake.
TEST NOTES SAVED
V/e have always wondered what
I lie girls would rescue in case of a
Pre. We found out. We should have
guessed. The only girl who thought
to save anything was the girl who
rushed back for her notebook. She
; creamed, "My God, I've yot to have
those notes for that test tomorrow!"
We kept wishing that all our pho
tographers weren't asleeo so that
we could get a picture of all those
gals on the front steps in their
clothes. Fashion note: saw only one
nightgown; rest were all p.j.'s.
After the firemen had chopped
away for half an hour or more to
get the last bit of smouldering
wood, one fire-eater emerged with
a kilt°n, newly born amid all the
hubbub. The feline refupee was
transferred to the safetv of the Sig
Chi house, where medicine drop
pers were produced to feed it.
Sigma Chi hospitality also was
extended to the pirls, who were get
ting mighty cold shivering on the
front steps.
About the time I secured, the
i iris gathered in a group and sere
naded the Sig Chi's, "For They Are
Jolly Good Fellows." Then they
any "Poor Old Russell."

TEST NOTES SAVED
V/e have always wondered what
I lie girls would rescue in case of a
Pre. We found out. We should have
guessed. The only girl who thought
to save anything was the girl who
rushed back for her notebook. She
; creamed, "My God, I've yot to have
those notes for that test tomorrow!"
We kept wishing that all our pho
tographers weren't asleeo so that
we could get a picture of all those
gals on the front steps in their
clothes. Fashion note: saw only one
nightgown; rest were all p.j.'s.
After the firemen had chopped
away for half an hour or more to
get the last bit of smouldering
wood, one fire-eater emerged with
a kilt°n, newly born amid all the
hubbub. The feline refupee was
transferred to the safetv of the Sig
Chi house, where medicine drop
pers were produced to feed it.
Sigma Chi hospitality also was
extended to the pirls, who were get
ting mighty cold shivering on the
front steps.
About the time I secured, the
i iris gathered in a group and sere
naded the Sig Chi's, "For They Are
Jolly Good Fellows." Then they
any "Poor Old Russell."
After chasing fire engines around the campus for six quarters,
we finally found a real fire. We were returning home from a mid
night snack at Marquard's after putting the Daily to press, and
there it was.
As we rounded the Post Office corner, we spotted the red
lights of the fire equipment in the*

mc.i of the Sigma Chi and Russell
bouses. Right off we knew it could
not be a ,false plann or a trash
barrel fire —that's Encina stuff. So
we raced to the scene.
Just as we got there, the girls, all
vented "" the. front porch, were
singing "1 Don't Want to Set the
World on Fire." A neighbor wan
dered onto the scene, still brushing
hi;. te"th. No one seemed very much
concerned.
We meandered inside to find the
fire, which we thought was in the
kitchen. The house mother, al
though badly flustered by all the
excitement, still had the presence of
i.iind to throw us out the back door.
Thei ■■ we saw that the fire could
very well have been a serious one.
]i the Sigma Chi's had not spotted
the flame the instant it broke out
;md rushed to the scene with fir"
extinguishers, the house would
probably have been ablaze.
RED-BLOODED FRAT
All of the Sig Chi's who partici
} a ted in the action desired to re
main anonymous, - saying, "Shucks,
any red - blooded fraternity man
would have done the same."
Pocause we have heard so much
moaning and groaning about fire
drills, v/e decided to find out if the
• iris thought the fire drills were
any help. They said that there was
no panic, but they admitted there
was some confusion in that they all
went out th" wrong exits. This was
due in part to the fact that some
of them had changed rooms, and by
force of habit went out the old way.
C'ii!y a few remembered to use the
fire escape.
Other girls said the reason there
was no confusion was that they
were all too sleepy. This sentiment
was echoed by Nancy Draper, who
said she had a devil of a time get
tin! everyone up and convincing
them it was a genuine fire. She rang
the bell like mad but everyone as
sumed it was a prank. Another
pirl thought the Sig Chi's were hav
ing a weenie bake.
