# UN Investigates Jewish Problem
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS HALL, Flush
ing, N.Y., May 15 (UP).—The United
Nations General Assembly, conclud
ing its first special session, today
appointed an 11-nation commission
to investigate the Palestine problem,
and appealed for a truce in Holy
Land fighting until the commission
can report.
The Jewish underground in Pal
estine has announced that it will
continue to fight, and Arab states
warned that violence may spread.
The Arabs abstained from voting on
the UN appeal for a truce. But the
18-day special session, the first ever
held, brought the United States and
Russia closer together than anyone
had anticipated.
SOVIET DELEGATE
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko,
in announcing that Russia would
accept partition of the Holy Land if
no other solution was possible, re
vealed that Russia is prepared to
agree to what is most likely to be
the final American position on Pal
estine — partition into Jewish and
Arab states.
Meanwhile, in Palestine, the Jew
ish underground, planting powerful
mines under hundreds of yards of
track, broke Palestine's main rail
connection with the outside world
today. It will lake two days to re
pair the break and restore train
service between Haifa and Cairo.
BRITISH OFFICERS KILLED
Two British oincers, trying to
neutralize a mine, were killed when
it exploded in their faces. Two sol
diers were seriously wounded in
the same explosion. Three locomo
tives were badly damaged, along
with l#ilf a dozen bridges on the
line.
If all of the mines had exploded,
the Haifa - Cairo line might have
been knockcd out for weeks. As it
was, only a few of the mines planted
in the Haifa area and around Petah
Tiqva and Tel Aviv went ofT. The
others were discovered in time and
disconnected.
