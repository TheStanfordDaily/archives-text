the end of the quarter. Those inter
t ated arc invited to attend the asso

stairs in the women's clubhouse.

ber has been about 10 dollars pei
month for the use of riding club
horses, equipment and instruction.
A well-rounded training program
in the art of polo is being carried out
j by the association feu* its members.
' The first phase consists of training
in elementary horsemanship and the
rough-house sill of "riding off" and
''checking." Once familiar with
handling a polo pony, the trainee
progresses to the fine art of stick-
J handling, developing* ah effective
swing for dripes, backhand shots and
i "stick hooking."
POLO REQUIRES TEAMWORK
The individual poloist must now
learn the most essential phase, team
play and positions, for this fast
changing game requires the smooth
teamwork of a good hockey or bas
ketball squad. Last on the training
program come the accessories of
i teamwork—the tactics and strategy
| of well planned and executed plays.
Team captain Foster expresses
: their confidence of a victory this
Sunday, despite relatively untrained
horses. Four chukkers will be played,
starting at 2 p.m., at the Pogonip
Riding Club field which may easily

j by the association feu* its members.
' The first phase consists of training
in elementary horsemanship and the

progresses to the fine art of stick-
J handling, developing* ah effective
