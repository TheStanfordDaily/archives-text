# 'Shoestring' Crew Meets Califorly'
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Tomorrow afternoon the unbeaten
crews of Stanford and California
meet on the Oakland Estuary in
three races. Ky Ebright's peren
nially strong Bear paadlers, fresh
from a sweeping meet victory over
the UCLA Bruins last Saturday, are
facing the upstart Indian oarsmen
who have been diligently prepping
for these Big Races since their sur
prise victory over Oregon State sev
eral weeks ago.
Four races will be run during the
afternoon's program. The first race,
a preliminary, will pit shells of Cal
ifornia and Sacramento JC against
each other. Three contests featuring
frosh, junior varsity, and varsity
shells of Cal and Stanford will fol
low. The first race is scheduled for
3:15 p.m., and the varsity finale is
expected to start at 4:45, as half
hour intervals will separate each of
the contests.
For motorists planning to see the
races, the best route from Palo Alto
is to cross the Dumbarton Bridge
and proceed through San Leandro
to East Oakland via Highway 17.
Turn left on Twenty-ninth Avenue,
which will take you directly to the
bridge over the Estuary. This bridge
at the foot of 29th Avenue is the
best vantage point for watching the
entire race, which will finish at the

I Fruitvale Avenue Bridge.
Judging from its record-breaking
performances last Saturday, Cal ap
pears to have another great rowing
aggregation. The Bears have cap
tured six national championships at
Poughkeepsie since 1928, and in
Winning the 1939 title set a record
1 which still stands of 18:12.0 for the
four-mile course. The Bears de
feated shells from five countries in
both 1928 and 1932 to gain the world
I title at the Olympic Games.
On this side of the bay, Stanford
is operating on a shoestring, at
tempting to regain its former posi
tion of national prominence after a
lengthy interval. The local oarsmen
defeated a Cal shell in an informal
race last autumn, but since that
J time three standouts have been lost

Bill Whitelord. Scothorn, a brilliant

j Annapolis, sustained a back injury

the crew.
