John Q. Public will get a chance to attend a preview of the
1947 model of the Big Red Machine tomorrow afternoon when
approximately 130 of Marchie Schwartz' gridders take to the
practice field to stage a two hour scrimmage session. The scrim
mage, which will mark the end of Stanford's Spring Practice will

begin on the field just south of the
Sunken Diamond at 2:00 p.m.
Although Head Grid master Mar
chie Schwartz has announced that
there will be no regular game and
no formal division of the squad, as
he may wish to .switch players from
one side to the other, the spectators
will be sure to witness plenty of
action.
Eight of the nineteen lettermen
back next fall are at present occu
pied in other spring sports, and for

that reason they will not participate
in the drill tomorrow. This group
includes centers Pete August, Dick
Flatiand, and Dorsey Kindler, Quar
terback Buck Brownson, halfback
Bob Anderson, and fullbacks Lloyd
Merriman, Martin Anderson, and
Don Zappettini.
Coach Schwartz has made several
position changes on his team. The

J most important of these switches has
! been the shifting of fullbacks Gene
i Martin and Jack Crahan to strength
en the end slots. Both of these boys
j will start on one of the teams in to
morrow afternoon's drill.
