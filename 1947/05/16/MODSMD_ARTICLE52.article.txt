# Netters Try For Initial PCC Win Against UCLA
## 
### 
That elusive first PCC tennis win for the Stanford Indians is
under attack again this afternoon as the locals play host to the
U.C.L.A. Bruins. First matches start at 1:30 p.m.
lust when the hustling Indians throught they had a Confer
ence victory tucked away two weeks ago, California's Bears up-

set the dope-sheet by winning, 5-4.
This loss, plus the earlier whipping
at the hands of the fabulous S.C.
Trojans, has dropped Stanford to
the cellar of the PCC.
With today's match, the Indians
complete their first swing around
the circuit in the double-round-rob
in competition. Thus a good show
ing against the Bruins is necessary
for any hopes of lifting the Indians
out of the cellar.
Next week, tennis action shifts to
Los Angeles when the Indians take
on both U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. on suc
cessive days.
In today's matches, feature spot
light falls on the Herbie Flam-Bob
Lewis battle in first singles. The
Bruin wonder-boy continues to score
impressive wins wherever he plays.
His last honors came in winning the
Ojai singles title against the cream
of college talent.
Meanwhile, Stanford's Bob Lewis
has rapidly improved since he took
over the top spot a month ago.
Against California, Lewis annexed
his first Conference win of the year.
He will be at his peak for the Bruin
battle.
Both Stanford and U.C.L.A. fell
before the championship - bound
Trojans. The Indians lost. 8-1, while
the Bruins dropped a 6-3 count.
Against Troy, U.C.L.A. could not
capture any of the lower bracket
matches in going down to defeat.
Thus the Indians will be concen
trating on tripping the Bruins in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth singles. Even
if Flam and Garrett succeed in tak
ing the top two singles, today's
match may well be decided in the
lower singles.
Using scores against California as
a comparison, net dopesters can
point to a Bruin win over the Berke
ley branch. The Indians lost to the
Bears by an eye-lash two weeks
ago. So the Bruins must be
favorites today.
