## 
###

after consecutive dual meet victory number twenty-two this
afternoon, when they tangle with the natators from UCLA in the
Encina Pools. The Farm mermen will try particularly hard for

| clean sweep for the Indians over
Southern Division PCC competition.
They have previously defeated USC
land the University of California.
As an added attraction to the meet,
Coach Tom Haynie has announced
ihal Marjorie Gestering Carter, for
: mer women's Olympic Diving Cham
pion, will give a springboard exhi
! bition. Marjorie brought the wo
( men's diving crown back from Ber

Besides a team victory, the local
swimmers will go into the meet
with one other goal—that of break
ing the only three PCC 20-yard pool
marks that remain for them to con
quer after last Saturday's record
smashing performance against USC.
Stanford swimming Captain Rey
Rule will attempt to better the ex
isting PCC 220-yard freestyle mark
of 2:13.3. Bob Anderson, NCAA 60-
and 100-yard freestyle record
holder, should set a new PCC 60-
yard mark. Either of the Farm's
two distance entrants, Fred Taioli
and Ralph Sala, could equal the 440-
yard record.
Coach Don Park's UCLA team,
after an impressive start, hit the
| skids two weks ago. In successive
weekends the Bruins have dropped
dual meets to the powerful teams
of USC and the Pasadena Athletic
; ciub.
Although Bob Anderson is heavily
favored to win the 100-yard free
style race, quite a second place bat
tle could shape up between sprinter
Woody Hoogs and UCLA's John
Nelson.
Gilbert TufTli, touted as being the
Bruin's leading water ace, will tan
gle with Don Hester, Em Cashin,
and Klas 80l in what should be a

Stanford swimming Captain Rey
Rule will attempt to better the ex
isting PCC 220-yard freestyle mark
of 2:13.3. Bob Anderson, NCAA 60-
and 100-yard freestyle record
holder, should set a new PCC 60-
yard mark. Either of the Farm's
two distance entrants, Fred Taioli
and Ralph Sala, could equal the 440-
yard record.
Coach Don Park's UCLA team,
after an impressive start, hit the
| skids two weks ago. In successive
weekends the Bruins have dropped
dual meets to the powerful teams
of USC and the Pasadena Athletic
; ciub.
Although Bob Anderson is heavily
favored to win the 100-yard free
style race, quite a second place bat
tle could shape up between sprinter
Woody Hoogs and UCLA's John
Nelson.
Gilbert TufTli, touted as being the
Bruin's leading water ace, will tan
gle with Don Hester, Em Cashin,
and Klas 80l in what should be a
close race in the 200-yard breast
| stroke event.

at the Encina Pools at 3:00 p.m.,
' with the diving exhibition sjated for
I 3:20.

Coaches Brandsten and Haynie's varsity swimmers will go
after consecutive dual meet victory number twenty-two this
afternoon, when they tangle with the natators from UCLA in the
Encina Pools. The Farm mermen will try particularly hard for
this one, for if they emerge victorious, the win will also mark a

| clean sweep for the Indians over
Southern Division PCC competition.
They have previously defeated USC
land the University of California.
As an added attraction to the meet,
Coach Tom Haynie has announced
ihal Marjorie Gestering Carter, for
: mer women's Olympic Diving Cham
pion, will give a springboard exhi
! bition. Marjorie brought the wo
( men's diving crown back from Ber
lin in 1936.

swimmers will go into the meet
with one other goal—that of break
ing the only three PCC 20-yard pool
marks that remain for them to con
quer after last Saturday's record
smashing performance against USC.
