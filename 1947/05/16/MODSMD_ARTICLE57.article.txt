# Giant Rookie Wins 1st Start
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 15 (UP).â€”The
fabulous rookie Clint Hartung, re
moved from the outfield for his
own safety and for the peace of
mind of the rest of the team, came
back as a starting pitcher today and
scored an 8 to 3 victory for the New
Yoik Giants over the league-lead
ing Chicago Cubs.
It was the third victory in a row
for the Giants on a Western road
trip and put them into third place
ahead of the Dodgers, who dropped
a 7 to 3 decision to the Pirates at
Pittsburgh.
It was Brooklyn's third straight
defeat on the road and its eighth
loss in the last 10 games.
The Reds, setting the major
league home run pace, got five more
today along with three doubles and
a triple as they drubbed the Phil
lies at Cincinnati, 11 to 3. Eddie Lu
kon got two homers, while Bert
Haas, Ray Mueller and Grady Hat
ton got one each. Del Ennis hit one
for the Phils.
The Browns upset the Red Sox
at Boston, 2 to 1. on seven-hit pitch
ing by Bob Muncrief which ended a
four-game winning streak by the
American League champions.
The Athletics and Tigers appeared
to be out to put on an encore of
their historic 24-inning, 1 to 1 tie
of two seasons ago at Philadelphia,
until Detroit pushed over two runs
in the 14th inning to score a 4 to
2 victory.
