# Card Track Men Enter Fresno Meet
## 
### 
Coach Jack Weiershauser has
nominated a squad of 25 men to
carry the Farm's hopes in the 21st
running of the annual West Coast
Relays, tomorrow afternoon and
evening in Fresno's RatclifT Sta
dium.
Topping the list is Captain A 1
Snyder, 14.5-sec. hurdler, who is
expected to give the high barrier
favorite, Bruin Craig Dixon, a defi
nite run for his money. Snyder
won't be alone in this respect, how
ever, for Jack Kaiser from San Die
go and Jim Attlesey of Troy have
i clipped identical times as Snyder.
i The host school's Merle Martin has
a mark of 14.G.
In. (he relays, the Indians' two
mile quartet of Bernie Wagner,
Frank Ganahl, A 1 Holubar, and
George Grimes is conceded the best
1 chance of upsetting the heavily fa
; vored USC Trojans' track domi
> nance. The final outcome of the
four-man mile could well depend
on the condition of Larry Hoff's in
! jured leg. The fleet Indian quarter
miler, who showed decided promise
early in the season, might give team
mates Terry Maxwell, Franklin
, Johnson, and George Grimes that
J needed lift to enable them to get
up to the victors' stand.
Although Stanford is badly out
classed in the field events, Frank
Held in the javelin, shot putter Otis
1 Chandler, and Bill Larson in the
pole vault could hit the scoring col-
I umn if the favorites fail to live up
' to expectations.
