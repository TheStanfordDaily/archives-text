Outfielder Forrest Hall, first base
man Ed Hanna, and third baseman
Oreste Matteucci are the heavy ar-

tillery of the Dons' attack. Butler
will pitch for the hosts.
Next week, the Dons are sched
uled for a return game here at the
Sunken Diamond.
BRUINS THREATEN CARDS
Although the Indians will have
their hands full with ihe Dons,
they'll still be keeping an eye out
for the outcome of the Uclan-Bear
series, for the Uclans are only a half
game behind the third-place Farm
boys.
However, unless UCLA can up

set the form chart and sweep the
two-game series, the Cardinals will
still have a firm grip on their upper
division berth, a position they
should have little trouble in main
taining in the few games left to go.
SCHEDULE FAVORS FARM
The Uclans have four games to
play against the top two teams in
the league and two against Santu
Clara. The Indians close the season
against Santa Clara, St. Mary's, and
Cal, a schedule factor which .heav
! ily favors the Indians.
As for tin* flag race, the schedule
the Trojans a slight edge to
close the one - game gap to ' first
place. 'I he two teams meet next
j week in a crucial game.
TROY MAY TRIP CAL
The other games for Cal are the
Iwo with UCLA and one with Stan
ford on M;iy 30, while the Trojans
also play the Uclans twice but get
an easier game with St. Mary's for
their "kicker."
The Bean have the slight edge in
pitching, bul they're going to have
their hands full in turning back the
I Trojan pennant drive.
If the CIBA happens to wind up
in a tie, a playoff will be necessary
in order that the conference cham
pion can play the champions of the
I northern coast.
