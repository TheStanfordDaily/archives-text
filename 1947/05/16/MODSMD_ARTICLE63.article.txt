## War Memorial Plan Is Practical 
### 
The war memorial plan approved yesterday
by the Board of Trustees is probably the most
practiral one that could have been chosen at
this time
Although large portions of the student body
have expressed favor for other memorial
plans, there are a few factors which seem to
indicate that the selection made is the best
one:
Any building at this time or in the near
future is rather impractical because of high
costs.
2. Student financial support is almost out
of the question inasmuch as the student body
is still paying for the Memorial Auditorium,
the memorial of World War I.
3. A contribution drive of the Alumni would
divert funds from the general University drive,
which would in turn cut down the money
that could be used for University functions
which are already far too shoit of cash.
These facts seem to indicate that the choice
made by the Board of Trustees is a realistic
one, and one that probably would have gained
the support of those persons in whose memory
the memorial is being planned.
Gripers, Allenlion
Today is the last day to try out for Rally
Com.
During the last two years, since Rally Com
has been reorganized after its absence during
the war years, there have been nothing but
gripes from all over campus as to the way
members have been chosen and the way in
which its activities have been put on.
What are these gripers doing about their
complaints today? According'to reports from
the committee heads, this tryout period so far

has brought no constructive criticisms or sug
gestions for improvement.
Now since a new Rally Com is being formed
and the committee heads are choosing people
on the basis of what they have to offer to next
year's Rally Com, it is up to the students with
new, practical ideas to bring them to the peo
ple most concerned.
Idle criticism without a willingness to work
out the change is worth nothing. No one has
a right to gripe if he will not offer a better sug
gestion today is the day to give the committee
the benefit of your ideas.â€”N.B. and M.S.
A Necessary Function
The Student-Administration forum will hold
its first meeting Monday evening at Dr. Alvin
C. Eurich's home.
There will be no momentous decisions forth
coming from the session, for the purpose of
the gathering is not to make decisions, but to
merely discuss and exchange viewpoints re
garding mutual problems of the students and
the administration.
The meeting will be informal with a view
to getting background on problems, so that
eventually when decisions are made by ad
ministration leaders and student organizations,
these decisions will be based on a more com
plete knowledge of all conditions surrounding
the problems.
The justification for such meetings lies in
the fact that student activities and administra
tion functions are now much more wide
spread than before, making it difficult for per
sons in key positions to get together often
enough to exchange views as they have done
in the past without the necessity for having
set meetings.
The forum is the logical outcome of an en
larged school.
