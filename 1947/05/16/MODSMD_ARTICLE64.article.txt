### WELLS KEDDIE 
The Institute of Inter-Quad Relations announced
today that an unofficial poll of Quad smokers, made
by Lafe Moxon —explorer, scientist, and busybody—
has proved practically nothing.
Moxon, the Institute said, buttonholed puffing
students yesterday at various spots in the Quad,
traditional no-smoking area. He asked one care
fully phrased question:
"Do you realize that by smoking in the Quad
you are violating one of Stanford's oldest tradi
tions?"
Responses to the question were varied, Moxon
reported, but all included one stock query: "Are you
drunk?" Other remarks usually followed in short
order, he added.
"Both men and women were interviewed," the
public-opinion tester declared. "Reactions to the
question cannot be classified by sex or age."
General conclusions drawn by Moxon on the basis
of replies are as follows:
1. People, including students, smoke on the Quad.
2. This is in violation of Stanford traditions.
3. Smokers evidenced little or no concern for

either the non-smoking tradition or the interviewer.
One student, wearing yellow cords and a white
"T" shirt, answered the question with the retort:
"What are you, an ex-lieutenant?" Moxon declared.
Another male student, Moxon continued, said:
"I'm not smoking," and snubbed out his cigarette on
the poller's ear lobe.
"This," the Institute stated, "was considered poor
sportmanship. Obviously, the student was smoking
all the time."
A feminine response, quoted from a co-ed wear
ing a gray flannel skirt and yellow sweater was:
"I'm all dated up for tonight, but this certainly is a
novel approach." Moxon's report did not indicate his
reply.
Only one penitent note was sounded by any of
those interviewed, it was disclosed. A letter-sweat
ered mass of muscle reputedly said: "I'm sorry I hit
you so hard. I didn't know my own nicotine strength."
Moxon's complete findings will be published in
pamphlet form in the near future, the Institute an
nounced. Money received from the sale of the report
will be used to send Moxon to the University of
California.
