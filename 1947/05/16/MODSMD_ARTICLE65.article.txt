Passage of the Greek-Turkish aid bill, implement
ing the"Truman Doctrine," offers a good opening
for a few observations on our relations with Russia.
Besides this bill for military aid, the House and Sen
ate have agreed in principle on a general relief
bill for Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Greece,
Trieste, and China, although the two houses have
not, so far, managed to agree on the amount to be
appropriated.
The Italian premier, De Gasperi, has resigned,
and is sponsoring, with American encouragement, the
formation of a cabinet without the support of Com
munists and left-wing Socialists. The State Depart
ment has been sending angry notes to Yugoslavia
about the confiscation of an American diplomat's
camera, and has refused to allow American tourists
to visit Yugoslavia until satisfied that tourists can
travel freely and enjoy lawful protection. An article
in Pravda has declared that Russia is willing to trade
with all nations, without regard to their system of
government, which, the Soviet newspaper declares,
is contrary to the American policy of trading only
with those nations with whose politics they agree.
The House Ways and Means Committee has appar
ently decided against recommending any changes
in the reciprocal trade agreement program, mean
while watching developments at the International
Trade Organization meeting now going on at Geneva.
All these items are taken from the newspapers of
the past two days. Taking it for granted (but not

warranting) that these are facts, what conclusions
on American-Soviet relations can be drawn from
them?
Consider Yugoslavia. On what appear to be the
facts, Tito's Yugoslavia is irretrievably within the
Russian orbit. Since the time last year when Yugo
slav forces shot down two American transport planes,
there has been a certain amount of popular preju
dice in this country against these South Slavs. Con
sequently. we take a firm attitude, making no con
cessions and losing no opportunity to make it plain
that cooperation must, by definition, be reciprocal.
On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that
Italy, Greece, and Austria may be kept on this side
of the international Main Street, and that Poland and
Hungary may some day be able to move over to
our side.
The United States has set up and is following a
consistent policy towards the Soviet Union. That
policy is one of "containment," a bit of military
jargon, which, let me point out, is not a synonym
for Hitler's pet. "encirclement." We have said, in
effect, to Russia, "Stay on your own side of the
street." (And, to work the street figure to death, we
may have plans to straighten and repave the street
too.) Whether its bi-partisan proponents will find
themselves in the position of those courtiers who as
sured King Canute that his word would hold back
the tide, remains to be seen.

consistent policy towards the Soviet Union. That
policy is one of "containment," a bit of military
jargon, which, let me point out, is not a synonym
for Hitler's pet. "encirclement." We have said, in
effect, to Russia, "Stay on your own side of the
street." (And, to work the street figure to death, we
may have plans to straighten and repave the street
too.) Whether its bi-partisan proponents will find
themselves in the position of those courtiers who as
sured King Canute that his word would hold back
the tide, remains to be seen.
Passage of the Greek-Turkish aid bill, implement
ing the"Truman Doctrine," offers a good opening
for a few observations on our relations with Russia.
Besides this bill for military aid, the House and Sen
ate have agreed in principle on a general relief
bill for Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Greece,
Trieste, and China, although the two houses have
not, so far, managed to agree on the amount to be
appropriated.
The Italian premier, De Gasperi, has resigned,
and is sponsoring, with American encouragement, the
formation of a cabinet without the support of Com
munists and left-wing Socialists. The State Depart
ment has been sending angry notes to Yugoslavia
about the confiscation of an American diplomat's
camera, and has refused to allow American tourists
to visit Yugoslavia until satisfied that tourists can
travel freely and enjoy lawful protection. An article
in Pravda has declared that Russia is willing to trade
with all nations, without regard to their system of
government, which, the Soviet newspaper declares,
is contrary to the American policy of trading only
with those nations with whose politics they agree.
The House Ways and Means Committee has appar
ently decided against recommending any changes
in the reciprocal trade agreement program, mean
while watching developments at the International
Trade Organization meeting now going on at Geneva.
All these items are taken from the newspapers of
the past two days. Taking it for granted (but not

warranting) that these are facts, what conclusions
on American-Soviet relations can be drawn from
them?
Consider Yugoslavia. On what appear to be the
facts, Tito's Yugoslavia is irretrievably within the
Russian orbit. Since the time last year when Yugo
slav forces shot down two American transport planes,
there has been a certain amount of popular preju
dice in this country against these South Slavs. Con
sequently. we take a firm attitude, making no con
cessions and losing no opportunity to make it plain
that cooperation must, by definition, be reciprocal.
On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that
Italy, Greece, and Austria may be kept on this side
of the international Main Street, and that Poland and
Hungary may some day be able to move over to
our side.
The United States has set up and is following a
consistent policy towards the Soviet Union. That
policy is one of "containment," a bit of military
jargon, which, let me point out, is not a synonym
for Hitler's pet. "encirclement." We have said, in
