# Aid Bills Sent To president
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP).—
Congress sent the $400,000,000 Gre
co-Turkish aid bill to the White
House today and put the final
touches on a general foreign relief
measure that will provide another
$200,000,000 to $300,000,000 for fam
ine-ridden peoples overseas.
President Truman was expected
to sign the Greco-Turkish aid bill
without delay, starting an immedi
ate flow of relief supplies and arms
to the Communist-threatened Med
iterranean states.
Equally fast action was looked for
on the general relief bill. Five Sen
ate and five House conferees went
into a huddle to iron out the major
differences between the separate
measures passed by the two cham
bers to head off starvation in Italy,
Austria, Poland, Hungary, Greece,
Trieste and China.
PROGRAM SLASHED
The principal point at issue was
a House economy move which
slashed the overall amount from the
$350,000,000 requested by the Ad
ministration to $200,000,000. The
Senate yesterday passed a bill au
thorizing the full $350,000,000 pro
gram and its conferees were trying
to persuade the House delegation
to accept that figure or, at a mini
mum, a $300,000,000 compromise.
But the conferees failed to agree
today and scheduled another meet
ing for tomorrow.
PLAN PREPARED
The Greco-Turkish program was
ready to roll even before President
Truman signed the bill. Advance
guards of the military and economic
missions that will help distribute
the American help and guide the
Greeks and Turks in its use were
mobilized and ready to take off.
Still unsettled were the names of
the two administrators who will di
rect the programs in Greece and
Turkey. President Truman was ex
pected to send his nominations to
the Senate shortly for confirmation,
as required by the aid bill.
