## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Aptly showing the post - war
trends in writing, "Stanford Short
Stories — 194G," a collection of 10
short stories written by Stanford
students, has recently been pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press.
The book includes a foreword by
John W. Dodds, Dean of the School
of Humanities, and stories by Oliver
Lawrence, Jean Byers, Don Allan,
Barbara Bellow Watson, and Eu
gene Burdick, selected and edited
by the seminar in fiction from the
best stories produced during the
year by Stanford students.
Six of these stories have been pub
lished or accepted for publication
by the "Rocky Mountain Review,"
"Collier's," "Esquire," "Harper's

Magazine," "Foreground," and "Pa
cific."
FIKST VOLUME
It is the first annual volume of
"Stanford Short Stories," to be pub
lished each year as a part of the
program of the newly developed
Stanford Writing Center, made pos
sible by a generous five-year grant
of $75,000 from Dr. E. R. Jones, ; ul
designed to stimulate excellence in
writing without regard to comm< : -
cial possibilities.
The stories are in general very
moving and hold the reader's atten
tion well. All ..subjective, but of an
interesting variety, they show the
effect of the war on the idtfas of the
younger generation.
Six of the stories, all written by
the male contributors to the anthol
ogy, deal with realistic impressions
of the war. The winners of the Hu
manities' Short Story Prize of $100,
"Shadow of a Dream" by Oliver
Lawrence, numbers among these six.
It is concerned with a soldier's ex
periences in Brazil, and has appeared
in the "Rocky Mountain Review."
"STRANGE" STORIES
Unusual in both subject matter
and method of presentation, are Jean
Byer's "The Capsule," a psycho
logical conception of life, and Bar
bara Bellow Watson's "Who Made
the Subway," a strange study of
racial prejudice. "The Capsule" has
been accepted by "Foreground."
Of the authors, Burdick and Law
rence are now attending Stanford,
and Miss Byers is an acting instruc
tor of English composition here.
Mrs. Watson was a creative writing
fellowship student at Stanford in
1945-4G. Allan graduated from Stan
ford in 194G and is now working as
a reporter on the "San Francisco
News."
Wallace Stegner, director of the
Stanford creative writing program,
said in his preface to the book:
"The ten short stories which com
pose this first annual volume of
"Stanford Short Stories" . . . seem
to me stories of quite unusual ex
cellence. They are not amateur per
formances, but professional or so
nearly professional as to confuse a
critic, and they are being published
not as justification of campus pa
triotism but as good reading."

1945-4G. Allan graduated from Stan
ford in 194G and is now working as
a reporter on the "San Francisco
News."
Wallace Stegner, director of the
Stanford creative writing program,
said in his preface to the book:
"The ten short stories which com
pose this first annual volume of
"Stanford Short Stories" . . . seem
to me stories of quite unusual ex
cellence. They are not amateur per
formances, but professional or so
nearly professional as to confuse a
critic, and they are being published
not as justification of campus pa
triotism but as good reading."
Aptly showing the post - war
trends in writing, "Stanford Short
Stories — 194G," a collection of 10
short stories written by Stanford
students, has recently been pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press.
The book includes a foreword by
John W. Dodds, Dean of the School
of Humanities, and stories by Oliver
Lawrence, Jean Byers, Don Allan,
Barbara Bellow Watson, and Eu
gene Burdick, selected and edited
by the seminar in fiction from the
best stories produced during the
year by Stanford students.
Six of these stories have been pub
lished or accepted for publication
by the "Rocky Mountain Review,"
"Collier's," "Esquire," "Harper's

Magazine," "Foreground," and "Pa
cific."
FIKST VOLUME
It is the first annual volume of
"Stanford Short Stories," to be pub
lished each year as a part of the
program of the newly developed
Stanford Writing Center, made pos
sible by a generous five-year grant
of $75,000 from Dr. E. R. Jones, ; ul
designed to stimulate excellence in
writing without regard to comm< : -
cial possibilities.
The stories are in general very
moving and hold the reader's atten
tion well. All ..subjective, but of an
interesting variety, they show the
effect of the war on the idtfas of the
younger generation.
Six of the stories, all written by
the male contributors to the anthol
ogy, deal with realistic impressions
of the war. The winners of the Hu
manities' Short Story Prize of $100,
"Shadow of a Dream" by Oliver
Lawrence, numbers among these six.
It is concerned with a soldier's ex
periences in Brazil, and has appeared
in the "Rocky Mountain Review."
"STRANGE" STORIES
Unusual in both subject matter
and method of presentation, are Jean
Byer's "The Capsule," a psycho
logical conception of life, and Bar
bara Bellow Watson's "Who Made
the Subway," a strange study of
racial prejudice. "The Capsule" has
been accepted by "Foreground."
Of the authors, Burdick and Law
rence are now attending Stanford,
and Miss Byers is an acting instruc
tor of English composition here.
Mrs. Watson was a creative writing
fellowship student at Stanford in
1945-4G. Allan graduated from Stan
ford in 194G and is now working as
a reporter on the "San Francisco
News."
