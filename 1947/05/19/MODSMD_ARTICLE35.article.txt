# NURSES' AIDES NEEDED
## 
### 
Any woman student or wife of a
student who has taken Nurse's Aide
training is asked to register with
the Red Cross chairman of disaster
Nurses' Aides, Mrs. L. N. Brown, at
4205.
Since there is still a serious short
age of registered nurses, Nurses
Aides will be needed for emergency
work in case of any disaster.
