# 'Old Faces' Do Darndest, Frosh Struggle Through
## 
### MARGIE SAMPSON 
"That will stop the Frosh for a while."
And with those words another staff of the Daily Trosh Edition
began having its troubles.
And with those words the "old faces" of the Daily staff left
the Shack, well-pleased with their eiiorls to rnal-e publication

of the Frosh Edition as difficult as
possible.
The Frosh entered the Shack Sat
urday to find paper scattered km -
deep on the floor, tables overturned,
chairs missing, and valuable UP m;
chine paper gone.
The dummy, which got into the
hands of the "old faces" on the busi
ness stafT, didn't resemble anytime
the back-shop had set up. The head
sheet, showing the counts on the
headlines, had mysteriously disa;
peared.
STEAL FUSES
Despite careful precautions taken
by the Frosh, the older and more
"adult" members of the stall man
aged to steal the fuses, and scud in
any number of false stories.
Fire-extinguishers, brooms, coke
bottles, and chairs proved to bo the
main defenses of the less-than-skel
eton Frosh staff. The superior
physically—forces of the "old faces"
kept the Frosh on their toes.
The United Press machine, stand
by of all editors in need of copy to
fill up the paper, wouldn't work for
the Frosh yesterday. A former elec
tronics technician on the staff traced
the trouble to paper stuffed between
the contact switches. One of the
brainier old faces must have per
petrated that one.
FROSII GET KEVENGE
The Frosh had their revenge last
night, though, in leaving the Shack

"That will stop the Frosh for a while."
And with those words another staff of the Daily Trosh Edition
began having its troubles.
And with those words the "old faces" of the Daily staff left
the Shack, well-pleased with their eiiorls to rnal-e publication

of the Frosh Edition as difficult as
possible.
The Frosh entered the Shack Sat
urday to find paper scattered km -
deep on the floor, tables overturned,
chairs missing, and valuable UP m;
chine paper gone.
The dummy, which got into the
hands of the "old faces" on the busi
ness stafT, didn't resemble anytime
the back-shop had set up. The head
sheet, showing the counts on the
headlines, had mysteriously disa;
peared.
STEAL FUSES
Despite careful precautions taken
by the Frosh, the older and more
"adult" members of the stall man
aged to steal the fuses, and scud in
any number of false stories.
Fire-extinguishers, brooms, coke
bottles, and chairs proved to bo the
main defenses of the less-than-skel
eton Frosh staff. The superior
physically—forces of the "old faces"
kept the Frosh on their toes.
The United Press machine, stand
by of all editors in need of copy to
fill up the paper, wouldn't work for
the Frosh yesterday. A former elec
tronics technician on the staff traced
the trouble to paper stuffed between
the contact switches. One of the
brainier old faces must have per
petrated that one.
