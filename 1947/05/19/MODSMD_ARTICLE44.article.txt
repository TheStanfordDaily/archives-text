# 2,500 Watch Gridders In Final Drill
## 
### 
A large crowd of over 2509 pre
season football fans turned out last
Saturday afternoon to watch Stan
ford's varsity and JV gridders go
through their final scrimmage of the
spring practice season.
The varsity scrimmage was divided
into three parts, with three pairs of
teams opposing each other. Coach
Marehie Schwartz switched his
players back and forth from one
team to another in order to use them
to the best advantage, and for that
reason the games had no particular
significance other than as practice
sessions.
BACKFIELD PERFORM WELL
Although the varsity fcackfields
performed exceptionally well, the
center of the crowd's interest was
turned to the lineplay, for it is an
ticipated that the forward wall will
be the key to Stanford's gridiron
success next fall.
The Schwarlzmen demonstrated
that they had corrected what was
perhaps their greatest shortcoming
last season, the lack of an aerial
attack. With quarterbacks Ainslee
Bell and A 1 Morris tossing, and
ends Mel Kendell, Ed Burke, Gene
Martin, Jack Crahan, and Don Mer
vin receiving, the varsity teams
rolled up six of their eight touch
downs via the air route.
ERICKSON INTERCEPTS
It would be difficult to pick out
all the individual stars of the scrim
mage. Scat halfback Wayne Erick
son intercepted one of Aubrey Di
vine's passes and ran it back the
complete length of the field for a
touchdown; halfback George "Polar
Bear ' Quist had considerably more
difficulty keeping up his too-large
football pants than 'he did with the
opposition's tacklers; and Ainslie
Bell's passes were very sharp when
he had enough time to get them
away. "Pinky" Phleger was out
standing at the right tackle slot,
and he has been commended by
Coach Schwartz as being the "best
linesman on the field today." A 1
Morris, who was perhaps the most
improved player on the field looked
very good on both offense and de
fense.
In the JV opener, a blue team
quarterbacked by Bob Krohn, de
feated Ronnie James' whites, 7-6.
Wes Fry's conversion-after-touch
down proved to be the margin of
victory for the white team.
