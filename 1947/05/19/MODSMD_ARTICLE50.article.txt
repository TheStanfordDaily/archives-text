# Cards Third At Fresno
## 
### AL BRIDGES 
Stanford s track and field stalwarts turned in a better than
expected peiformance during the West Coast Relays at Fresno
cn Saturday, walking off with third place in the meet by nudg
ing the California Bears and San Jose State. Sterling perform
ances in three eventsâ€”the high hurdles, two-mile relays, and
the javelin throw gave the Indians

most of their 28 big points. UCLA
gathered 42 5-6 points for second,
while Dean Cromwell's Trojans
took first to no one's surprise with
55 5-6 points.
The Stanford two-mile relay team
of Bernie Wagner, Frank Ganahl,
A 1 Hoiubar and George Grimes
produced pleasant results for the
Farm team when Grimes turned on
a tremendous stretch drive to nip
Troy's Field Berry at the tape, to
garner some much needed first place
points.
HELD WINS JAVELIN
A major surprise of (he day came
when Stanford's Bud Held, a trans
fer from the pole vault squad, un
corked a tremendous 212 foot 10 inch
javelin throw which won the event
and made him the number one
American collegiate spear thrower.
In making this throw, Held bettered
any of his previous efforts by 15
feet.
Squad team captain A 1 Snyder
brought more good news to the
Farm by flying over the high hurdles
in one of the finest races of his
career. Snyder crossed the line a
scant two feet behind fleet-footed
Craig Dixon of UCLA who broke
the tape with a 14.3 second effort
best on the coast this year.
Several world records tottered

but did not quite fall during this
the 21st renewal of the West Coast
Relays. Patton's great dash came
mighty close to the 9.4 mark and
further demonstrated he is No. 1
sprint-man on the coast if not in the
nation.
STEELE NEARS RECORD
A terrific heave by Wilbur Thomp
son, LAAC shot-putter, pushed the
16 pound ball 54 feet 9 5-8 inches for
a new relays mark and just a shade
away from the world's record. An
other supreme effort was the winning
broad jump by Willie Steele of San
Diego State. The dusky star squirmed
through the air for 25 feet 10 3-4
inches, a few inches short of the
world standard set by Jesse Owens.
The two great athletic clubs,
Olympic and Los Angeles, partici
pated, but were not permitted to
collect points for their efforts. The
final point count for the intercolle
giates: USC, 55 5-6; UCLA, 42 5-6;
Stanford, 28; San Jose, 26; Califor
nia, 18y 2 ; San Diego, 9; COP, 5 1-3;
Fresno, 5; Nevada, 5; Chico, I'A.
