## Watch Those Campaigners 
### 
Next fall, for the first time in Stanford his
tory, candidates for ASSU offices will be al
lowed to spend money for electioneering.
Many evils may possibly arise from this
new policy unless all candidates follow a
closely regulated, uniform plan.
Kxcom, foreseeing this danger, has asked
fclteotion Board to submit a plan Wednesday
.oj their approval. The submitted plan will
oe only in the nature of suggestions, and will
very probably be revised by Excom.
Students should, therefore, contact their
Excom representative prior to that meeting if
the following plan does not seem satisfactory.
Will This Plan Work?
1 1. A budget must be turned in by candi
dates to Election Board within 24 hours after
their nomination. This budget should include:
(a) Estimated campaign expenditures,
npt to-exceed $15 for offices of ASSU Presi
dent and Vice-President and $10 for all other
c^ffices.
All aid from friends, monetary and other-
Wise, must be included. This is necessary to
prevent any one candidate from having undue
advantage over the rest.
Certainly it would not be fair to let Joe
Doakes use a friend's sound truck for nothing,
and then not include it on his budget when it
would cost Doakes' opponent $7 an hour for
the rental of the same sound truck. Both must
include the rental fee on their budget—even
though one got the publicity free.
2. If a candidate's first budget is under the
constitutional maximum, and he later decides
to spend more money (up to the maximum),
he may do so by submitting a new, revised
budget to Election Board.
3. An electioneering chairman should be
appointed to Election Board to handle budgets
and investigate charges.

4. Campaign material should be of a type
which is available to all candidates.
5. Violations should be watched for, par
ticularly by Excom members. However, can
didates themselves will undoubtedly provide
the best regulatory means. First, because it
will be up to their personal integrity to keep
themselves within their budget; second, be
cause opponents will naturally keep a wary
eye on each other.
6. Investigations shall be launched by
Election Board against any candidate who is
questioned. The candidate in question will be
asked to show receipts for all his expendi
tures, and estimates will be made to deter
mine whether or not these receipts are accu
rate.
7. If the investigation seems to bear out
the charge made against the candidate, the
results will be presented to Excom for judg
ment. Excom will then disqualify him if they
believe that he and or his friends have spent
more than the constitutional maximum.
The candidate in question should be al
lowed to speak in his own behalf at these
hearings.
That's the proposed plan. Wednesday Ex
com will hash it over, revise it, and finally vote
on it. Whether it will keep candidates in line
next fall will depend upon the adoption of a
fully comprehensive plan Wednesday and
upon the earnest cooperation of students in
the future.
The plan will be comprehensive enough
only if Excom representatives are fully in
formed so that measures to guard against
violations of varied sorts may be incorporated.
Ingenious electioneering methods will add
spirit to future campaigns, but the earnest
cooperation of all students will be needed to
keep electioneering on a sensible level.

4. Campaign material should be of a type
which is available to all candidates.
5. Violations should be watched for, par
ticularly by Excom members. However, can
didates themselves will undoubtedly provide
the best regulatory means. First, because it
will be up to their personal integrity to keep
themselves within their budget; second, be
cause opponents will naturally keep a wary
eye on each other.
6. Investigations shall be launched by
Election Board against any candidate who is
questioned. The candidate in question will be
asked to show receipts for all his expendi
tures, and estimates will be made to deter
mine whether or not these receipts are accu
rate.
7. If the investigation seems to bear out
the charge made against the candidate, the
results will be presented to Excom for judg
ment. Excom will then disqualify him if they
believe that he and or his friends have spent
more than the constitutional maximum.
The candidate in question should be al
lowed to speak in his own behalf at these
hearings.
That's the proposed plan. Wednesday Ex
com will hash it over, revise it, and finally vote
on it. Whether it will keep candidates in line
next fall will depend upon the adoption of a
fully comprehensive plan Wednesday and
upon the earnest cooperation of students in
the future.
The plan will be comprehensive enough
only if Excom representatives are fully in
formed so that measures to guard against
violations of varied sorts may be incorporated.
Ingenious electioneering methods will add
spirit to future campaigns, but the earnest
cooperation of all students will be needed to
keep electioneering on a sensible level.

Next fall, for the first time in Stanford his
tory, candidates for ASSU offices will be al
lowed to spend money for electioneering.
Many evils may possibly arise from this
new policy unless all candidates follow a
closely regulated, uniform plan.
Kxcom, foreseeing this danger, has asked
fclteotion Board to submit a plan Wednesday
.oj their approval. The submitted plan will
oe only in the nature of suggestions, and will
very probably be revised by Excom.
Students should, therefore, contact their
Excom representative prior to that meeting if
the following plan does not seem satisfactory.
Will This Plan Work?
1 1. A budget must be turned in by candi
dates to Election Board within 24 hours after
their nomination. This budget should include:
(a) Estimated campaign expenditures,
npt to-exceed $15 for offices of ASSU Presi
dent and Vice-President and $10 for all other
c^ffices.
All aid from friends, monetary and other-
Wise, must be included. This is necessary to
prevent any one candidate from having undue
advantage over the rest.
Certainly it would not be fair to let Joe
Doakes use a friend's sound truck for nothing,
and then not include it on his budget when it
would cost Doakes' opponent $7 an hour for
the rental of the same sound truck. Both must
include the rental fee on their budget—even
though one got the publicity free.
2. If a candidate's first budget is under the
constitutional maximum, and he later decides
to spend more money (up to the maximum),
he may do so by submitting a new, revised
budget to Election Board.
3. An electioneering chairman should be
appointed to Election Board to handle budgets
and investigate charges.

4. Campaign material should be of a type
which is available to all candidates.

ticularly by Excom members. However, can
