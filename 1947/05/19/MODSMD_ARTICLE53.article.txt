### JACK LITTLE 
Kiddies, Im quite cognizant of the fact that you're
wondering just who the hell I am and what excuse
I have for daring to tread upon a column once the
property of Dr. Coughlin, Ph.D. (Piled Higher and
Deeper). As far as both questions are concerned,
your guess is as good as mine. It's not that I'm ac
tually frustrated or mentally muddled, but it seems
that I dropped in on the Spring Show cast party Sat
urday night. Perhaps 1 should just say that I
dropped . . .

Remember all the wartime news about those ob
noxious little fellows known as gremlins? Well, to
all appearances, theyre staging a comeback ... on
the Stanford campus yet! One of the elusive little
beasts, and a green one at that, has set up house
keeping in the KSU studios. For some, time he's
been twisting dials the wrong way, hiding scripts
and records, and generally fouling things up, but the
other night he really established himself as a number
one, A grade gremlin.
There was a program going on in the control
room, one of those canned music shows with witty
little introductions to each number, and one of the
boys on the staff was out in the studio washing the
windows of the control room. Several sweet ycAing
things (Stanford species) were standing around the
studio, awed by the magnificent chaos of a real, live
radio station, when the gremlin, unnoticed, slipped
into the control room. Just as a record ended and
the announcer began to pour his repartee into cars

quivering with anticipation, our hero switched of! the
mike. The announcer talked merrily on, but the
window washer cleverly noticed that all was not
well with the program, which was being relayed to
the studio. Luckily, he was scrubbing away on a
window right in front of the announcer's serene face.
He began gesticulating wildly, twisting imaginary
dials, jabbering into non-existent mikes, and shaking
his head madly. The sweet young things were im
pressed ... all those complex, technical signals! The
announcer chattered blithely on. The window washer
was getting madâ€”damn mad. Finally, oblivious of
his impressed audience, he gave the announcer a
final signal . . . one involving vigorous and prominent
display of an index finger . . .
Throwing down his Windex in disgust, the some
what overwrought young man turned to see the
sweet young things viewing him with a mixture of
awe and admiration. Before he could escape, one
of the little innocents (pardon my cynicism ... I
dont believe it either) ventured to ask:
"What did that last signal mean? It looked so
important!"
Stifjing a scream, the incredulous gentleman
grasped at a straw.
"That," he quavered, "means to turn on the
middle mike."
By unanimous vote, the gremlin . . . the one
with the green, Lifebuoyless complexion, has been
named "Middle-Mike."
