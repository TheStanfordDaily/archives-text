### MARY HILL 
John L, Lowis has defended the right to strike
by asserting that involuntary labor is servitude and
is thus an infringement of essential human rights.
The government, on the other hand, has claimed that
public interests are paramount and that the commu
nity must be protected by the curtailment of the
lights involved.
The Declaration of Independence states that all
men "are endowed by their Creator with certain in
alienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,
and the pursuit of Happiness." But what in essence
arc these rights? One author says that a legal right
is "a capacity residing in one man of controlling, with
the assent and assistance of the State, the actions
of others." Provided that this is a suitable definition.
Lewis's assumption that all men have the right to
strike at any time under any conditions Ls outlawed,
for it is rejected by public opinion. For instance, if
public officials such as policemen or firemen aban
doned their work, society's right of protection would
be infringed upon. If soldiers or sailors forsook their
duties, particularly during the crisis of war, they
would be charged with mutiny. If teachers refused
to teach, the public would be deprived of free edu
cation. Therefore, not every man has the right to
strike at any time and under any conditions, for by
doing so he violates the rights of others. Rights, to
me, are privileges granted to a person by a society,
which cease to be rights when they injure society.
It is not true that all involuntary labor constitutes
servitude. Conscription into the armed forces is an
example of involuntary labor, which also includes
the possibility of death or injury. Drafting is a means
of preserving the right of man to "Life, Liberty, and

the pursuit of Happiness,' which hits been sanctioned
by society. Men of the armed forces are not submit
ted to servitude; they are conscripted to fight the
possibility of bondage under another nation. I agree
that labor has been imposed upon many times, but
there must be other means of conciliation preferable
to the strike.
There are limitations to all rights. Consequently,
there is a limit to the right of a.U men to strike. The
major strikes of H)4t!, for the moist part, were directed
against the public and therefore threatened public
rights, in both the employer and employee brackets.
Perhaps the employee suffers more than the employ
er by striking. There are so one men who want to
work. They arc railroaded into striking by union
heads or fellow union members. Brute force in the
form of picket lines i.s used to keep even those who
want to work from working. Without sufficient sub
sistence, these men become a burden upon society.
It is not justifiable that the public as a whole should
pay for the good of the few. The public sanctions
rights, but it should not receive the injuries inflicted
by misinterpretation of these rights.
If private interests wepc reasonably subordinated
to the public good, an idetil situation would be cre
ated. The managements of railroads arc subject
to the rules and regulations of the Interstate Com
merce Commission. Employees of railroads, and oth
er businesses, should be subject to a similar organi
zation, pledged to certain services and enjoying its
corresponding privileges. In this way, everyone
would yield some of his sovereignty for the public
good. All people, employers and employees alike,
could benefit from such a system.

good. All people, employers and employees alike,
could benefit from such a system.
John L, Lowis has defended the right to strike
by asserting that involuntary labor is servitude and
is thus an infringement of essential human rights.
The government, on the other hand, has claimed that
public interests are paramount and that the commu
nity must be protected by the curtailment of the
lights involved.
The Declaration of Independence states that all
men "are endowed by their Creator with certain in
alienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,
and the pursuit of Happiness." But what in essence
arc these rights? One author says that a legal right
is "a capacity residing in one man of controlling, with
the assent and assistance of the State, the actions
of others." Provided that this is a suitable definition.
Lewis's assumption that all men have the right to
strike at any time under any conditions Ls outlawed,
for it is rejected by public opinion. For instance, if
public officials such as policemen or firemen aban
doned their work, society's right of protection would
be infringed upon. If soldiers or sailors forsook their
duties, particularly during the crisis of war, they
would be charged with mutiny. If teachers refused
to teach, the public would be deprived of free edu
cation. Therefore, not every man has the right to
strike at any time and under any conditions, for by
doing so he violates the rights of others. Rights, to
me, are privileges granted to a person by a society,
which cease to be rights when they injure society.
It is not true that all involuntary labor constitutes
servitude. Conscription into the armed forces is an
example of involuntary labor, which also includes
the possibility of death or injury. Drafting is a means
of preserving the right of man to "Life, Liberty, and

the pursuit of Happiness,' which hits been sanctioned
by society. Men of the armed forces are not submit
ted to servitude; they are conscripted to fight the
possibility of bondage under another nation. I agree
that labor has been imposed upon many times, but
there must be other means of conciliation preferable
to the strike.
There are limitations to all rights. Consequently,
there is a limit to the right of a.U men to strike. The
major strikes of H)4t!, for the moist part, were directed
against the public and therefore threatened public
rights, in both the employer and employee brackets.
Perhaps the employee suffers more than the employ
er by striking. There are so one men who want to
work. They arc railroaded into striking by union
heads or fellow union members. Brute force in the
form of picket lines i.s used to keep even those who
want to work from working. Without sufficient sub
sistence, these men become a burden upon society.
It is not justifiable that the public as a whole should
pay for the good of the few. The public sanctions
rights, but it should not receive the injuries inflicted
by misinterpretation of these rights.
If private interests wepc reasonably subordinated
to the public good, an idetil situation would be cre
ated. The managements of railroads arc subject
to the rules and regulations of the Interstate Com
merce Commission. Employees of railroads, and oth
er businesses, should be subject to a similar organi
zation, pledged to certain services and enjoying its
corresponding privileges. In this way, everyone
would yield some of his sovereignty for the public
good. All people, employers and employees alike,
could benefit from such a system.
