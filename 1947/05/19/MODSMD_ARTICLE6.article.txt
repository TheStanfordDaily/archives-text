## 
### 
John Almack. professor of educa
tion, and John Bartky, Dean of the
School of Education, testified Thurs
day at a meeting of the Senate Ed
ucation Committee in Sacramento.
The two Stanford professors ex
pressed opposite views on the pro
posed legislation by Senator Tenney
which would abolish the State Cur
riculum Commission and restrict
certain courses taught in the public
schools.
Almack agreed with the Tenney
legislation, charging that the com
mission "bends to vested interests"
in the selection of textbooks.
Bartky stated that though he did
not disagree with the bill entirely,
"there are some objections to some
of the provisions."
Senator Tenney accepted sug
gested amendments from both of the
Stanford professors regarding the
bill.
