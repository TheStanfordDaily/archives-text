# Farm Women Top Yosemite Spires
## 
### 
Two Stanford women, Freddy
Hubbard and Mary Sherrell, made
outstanding climbs this weekend
when they sealed the Royal Arches
and the higher Cathedral Spire in
Yosemite, announced Ulf Ramm-
Ericson who, with Bud Gates, ac
companied the girls.
The higher Cathedral Spire, ris
ing 2,000 feet from the valley floor,
had been climbed by only two
women previous to the Alpiners' as
cent, although 21 parties had
reached the top.
The Royal Arches, the object of
an unsuccessful trip by four Stan
ford men last weekend, was mount
ed in six hours.
"This was the first time that any
girls from the Alpine Club had
made any of the difficult climbs
in Yosemite," said Ramm-Ericson,
"and they really did a lot of spec
tacular climbing."
