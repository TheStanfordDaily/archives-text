## 
### 
"We are seriously considering
closing off Arguello Street to stu
dent traffic," asserted Gordon Da
vis, campus police chief, at Men's
Council yesterday. "Not only is
there an excess of traffic on the
street, but the speeding situation is
almost getting out of hand."
Three traffic violation cases were
reviewed at yesterdays session, two
for speeding and one for parking.
The Council meeting next Tues
day afternoon will be the last of the
quarter, chairman Jim Welch de
clined.
