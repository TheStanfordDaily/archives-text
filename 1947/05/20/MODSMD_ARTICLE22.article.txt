A German black market operator
went into a village in the Bavarian
backwoods last night and obtained
620 pounds of food—potatoes, flour,
bacon, ham, lard, eggs and sausage
—in less than two hours.
I followed him from farmer to
farmer and watched him get for
soap, second-hand clothes and six
cigarettes the makings of a feast in
a country where everybody is sup
posed to be starving, or at least very
hungry.
| Let's call the black market oper

ator "Johann," because the police
would like to know what his real
name is. While government experts
in the United States and Germany
were conferring urgently on how to
avoid a catastrophe in food crisis,
I looked up Johann and asked him
whether it was true that food had
disappeared from the black mar
ket.
"What would you like to have?"
Johann inquired.
He agreed to let me go with him
in civilian clothes on his next "trad
ing trip'' into Bavaria, the food
kingdom of the American zone.

It was almost 11 p.m. and the
farmers, who get up at daybreak,
were nearly all in bed when we
arrived in a little village near Ox
enfvirt. Yet we were on our way
back to Frankfurt within two hours,
Johann's automobile loaded with
500 pounds of potatoes, 100 pounds
of barley flour, five pounds of ba
con, three pounds of ham, four
pounds of lard, two dozen eggs and
five pounds of sausage.
Besides, we stuffed ourselves with
all the ham, sausage, bread, milk
and apple cider we could hold. Jo
hann ate five times as much as I
did, and the fanners were obvi

ously disappointed that I did not
show an equal appreciation of their
food.
For all this, Johann leaded 12
pieces of German-made soap, one
pair of new but shoddy woman's
shoes, one second - hand woman's
dress, one blouse, one pair of used
man's work shoes and six cigarettes.
Germany's postwar economy is
popularly supposed to be operating
on the "cigarette standard," but Jo
hann refused to give his Bavarian
j friends more than one cigarette each
! to smoke.
"I don't want to spoil these peo
| pie," he said.
