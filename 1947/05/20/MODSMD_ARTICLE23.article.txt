# Pravda Attacks Farm UN Reform Committee
## Morgan Answer Says 'Our Aim Is to Save' 
### 
In answer to Pravda's accusations that the
Citizens Committee for the United States Re
form ' is trying to destroy the United Nations,
Professor B. Q. Morgan, chairman of the com
mittee, stated that "our organization, so far from

attempting to scrap the United Na
tions, wants to save it from disrup
tion because of the disastrous ef
lects of the veto power, the danger of
worldwide destruction by the atom
bomb, and the lack at present of any
effective force against aggression.
liussia opposed the abolition of
the veto power, declined to accept
the United State's Baruch plan for
international control of the atom
bomb, and has certainly not fur
thered the establishment of a world
police force."
Professor Thomas S. Barclay of
the political science department and
a member of the committee said that
he concurred with the statement
made by Dr. Morgan.
