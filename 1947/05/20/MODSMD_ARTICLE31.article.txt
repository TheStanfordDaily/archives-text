# Red Writer Charges â€˜American Imperialism'
## 
### 
The Stanford faculty chapter of the "Citizens
Committee for United Nations Reform" was ac
cused Sunday by Eugene Zhukov, a writer in
Pravda, of hiding a desire of American imperial
ists to destroy the United Nations by forming

committees to "reform" the world
organization.
Zhukov accused the setting up of a
committee in New York as well as
at Stanford University as measures
of the American "imperialists."
"This project of reform is a pro
gram of liquidation of the United
Nations, a program of making the
organization into a fiction, into an
obedient instrument of American
politics," the writer said.
AGGRESSIVE FORCES
Pravda continued that such groups
"reflect the growing appetite of ag
gressive monopoly forces in the
United States, who are annoyed and
bothered by the existence of an in
ternational organization which can
counteract aggression."
"Imperialists and militarists in the
United States openly inspire reac
tionaries and pro-Fascists into form
ing some kind of organization in
which the imperialists can com
pletely forget the rules of element
ary decency and put their feet on
the table."
CHAPTER INDEPENDENT
Stanford's chapter of this organ
ization is composed of 35 faculty
members and is entirely independent
of the University, B. Q. Morgan,
chairman of the group said. This
chapter is open only to faculty mem
bers in hopes that the students and
people of Palo Alto will form sep
arate chapters. This chapter, one
of many throughout the nation, is
the first on the West Coast.
Charter members of the chapter
besides Morgan are Frederick An
derson, Eliot Blackwelder, Hughes
Brewster, Edwin A. Cottrell, Sie
mon Muller, K. F. Reinhardt, and
A. E. Sokol.
Other members include Thomas
S. Barclay, G. M. Bonnin, Elwyn
Bugge, J. J. Carter, E. G. Chilton,
J. A. Clawson, Helen Emerson, Mack
Evans, P. R. Farnsworth, N. P. Ford,
Arthur Grad, H. D. Gray, M. G.

Mayfield, A. V. Naughton, E. W.
Schultz, L. G. Thomas, J. O. Troxell,
A. C. Vardac, H. A. Williams, Mary
A. Williams, H. D. Winbigler.
VETO ELIMINATION AIM
The purpose of the committee is
the elimination of the veto power
in the case of unprovoked aggres
sion, international control of the
atomic bomb, and the establishment
of a world police force, according to
Dr. Morgan.
This non-partisan committee was
formed in Middietown, Ohio. Its
headquarters are now in New York.
To form a chapter of the committee,
a group must have at least five
members.
He further stated "the moving
spirit in the whole thing is Ely Cul
bertson, whom the Russians have
already attacked rather violently;
it goes without saying that they will
not like anything that he sponsors."
Culbertson is acting chairman of
the national board of directors which
includes such liberals as Max East
man, Norman Thomas, Dorothy
Thompson, and Oswald Garrison
Villard. Villard's son, Oswald G.
Villard, Jr., is acting assistant pro
fessor of engineering here.

CHAPTER INDEPENDENT
Stanford's chapter of this organ
ization is composed of 35 faculty
members and is entirely independent
of the University, B. Q. Morgan,
chairman of the group said. This
chapter is open only to faculty mem
bers in hopes that the students and
people of Palo Alto will form sep
arate chapters. This chapter, one
of many throughout the nation, is
the first on the West Coast.
Charter members of the chapter
besides Morgan are Frederick An
derson, Eliot Blackwelder, Hughes
Brewster, Edwin A. Cottrell, Sie
mon Muller, K. F. Reinhardt, and
A. E. Sokol.
Other members include Thomas

VETO ELIMINATION AIM
The purpose of the committee is
the elimination of the veto power
in the case of unprovoked aggres
sion, international control of the
atomic bomb, and the establishment
of a world police force, according to
Dr. Morgan.
This non-partisan committee was
formed in Middietown, Ohio. Its
headquarters are now in New York.
To form a chapter of the committee,
a group must have at least five
members.
He further stated "the moving
spirit in the whole thing is Ely Cul
bertson, whom the Russians have
already attacked rather violently;
it goes without saying that they will
not like anything that he sponsors."
Culbertson is acting chairman of
the national board of directors which
includes such liberals as Max East
man, Norman Thomas, Dorothy
Thompson, and Oswald Garrison
Villard. Villard's son, Oswald G.
Villard, Jr., is acting assistant pro
fessor of engineering here.
The Stanford faculty chapter of the "Citizens
Committee for United Nations Reform" was ac
cused Sunday by Eugene Zhukov, a writer in
Pravda, of hiding a desire of American imperial
ists to destroy the United Nations by forming

committees to "reform" the world
organization.
Zhukov accused the setting up of a
committee in New York as well as
at Stanford University as measures
of the American "imperialists."
"This project of reform is a pro
gram of liquidation of the United
Nations, a program of making the
organization into a fiction, into an
obedient instrument of American
politics," the writer said.
AGGRESSIVE FORCES
Pravda continued that such groups
"reflect the growing appetite of ag
gressive monopoly forces in the
United States, who are annoyed and
bothered by the existence of an in
ternational organization which can
counteract aggression."
"Imperialists and militarists in the
United States openly inspire reac
tionaries and pro-Fascists into form
ing some kind of organization in
which the imperialists can com
pletely forget the rules of element
ary decency and put their feet on
the table."
