# Stanford's Housemothers Object To Men and Snakes--But Gals OK
## 
### JACK CAPITO 
The little lady behind the scenes, the housemother, gets little recognition or acclaim on
campus.
"Behind the scene, my loot," declared a bitter sophomojfe girl. "Behind a tapestry or curtain
is more like it."
Another sophomore woman states: "There is a path beaten between the housemother's desk

and the window in our house. Once
a housemother leaned out the win
dow so lar she took a nose dive into
a convertible below. We lose more
housemothers that way."
A bitter junior woman says that
her housemother will not let anyone
into the house a second late. Her
boy friend swears that after bring
ing her home late one night, some
body was shooting at him with a
die the housemother claims it was
only mice knocking over coke bot
tles.
A senior woman declares that ev
» ry time she and her boy friend get
comfortably situated on the sola,
the housemother walks through,
and her boy friend has to drop what
he's doing and stand up.
But one of the housemothers com
plains that most of the boys who
come to call at her house never
bother to stand up when a lady
enters the room.
MANNERS WANTED
"They put their feet on the coffee
tables and chairs, and they lounge
leisurely on the divans or floors.
They ought to have housemothers in
the men's houses," she declared, "to
teach them a few manners!"
Another housemother, when asked
what she thought of the idea of
housemothers in men's houses, com
mented:
"They don't need housemothers—
they need top sergeants!"
Other "men-headaches" to house
mothers include:
1) Getting the men to leave the
girls when the proper time comes.
2) "Male animals" who stand at
the foot of the stairs and yodel for a
girl to come down.
11) Men who don't bother to yell
(or use the buzzer system provided
in many of the houses for civilized
men) but dash upstairs shouting
"Charrrrrrrrge!!"
SOLUTION OIVEN
When asked her solution to these
problems, a housemother said:
"When a boy tries to go where he
supposed ty. 1 just stand there
and look at him, and he runs in
the opposite direction."
Another mother is thinking of in
stalling a false step in the stairs.
"As yet there Ls no solution to the
yodelers, and as for the men who
just can't leave their dates at the
proper time, I've begun to tell them
that they must send the house
mother one'orchid for every minute
they're late. My room is getting so
full of flowers that I'm having to
take out all the furniture to make
room for them I put them in my
hats, I wear them in my hair, I
make leis out of them!"
KNAKE-IN-ROOM
"I don't have any trouble with
men roaming in my halls," stated
still another housemother, "but last
spring vacation as I was walking
down the hall, a snake a few feet
long came crawling out of a girl's
room. I had suspected that some
of my girls lacked companionship
but I never dreamed it would come
to this!"
When asked about the men's ser
enades, a housemother commented:
"They are very nice. The other
night, after one of our girls gol
pinned, they gave a beautiful sere
nade, even though the housemother
iaid it sounded like " a bunch of
drunks."
But the housemothers are all
pretty well sold on their girls. They
point out that the girls have their
own officers who enforce the lock
out rules, which are run on the
Honor Code system.
<;IRI,S FRIENI>LV
"Most, of the girls make it a point
to get along well with each other;
they have a grand time together;
and ihey always receive the new
girls warmly and try to make them
feel at home," seems to be the opin
ion of most of the mothers.
Th" women's Row houses are the
only ones with housemothers. In
the large women's halls, sponsors
and resident assistants correspond
to housemothers. Night assistants
check up on lockouts. A freshman j
woman from a certain hall re- i
marked:

"Our night assistant stands in the
doorway at about lockout time and
you have to squeeze around her. Its
like a screening process — you're
strained through."
MAIN DUTIES
The main duties of a Row house
mother consist of supervising the
help, hiring and firing the help,
planning the meals, doing all the
food buying, recommending what
has to be done in the way of house
repairs and furniture replacements,
arranging for special suppers and
guests, helping the girls arrange for
parties and dances, and answering
the tapping on the door, which
seems to go on at all hours of the
day and night.
"It's a 24-hour-a-day job, like
running a household for 30 or 40
people." is the way one person de
scribed being a housemother.
"The main prerequisites for being
n goood housemother," said one of
them, "are patience and a sMise of
humor."
