WASHINGTON, May 19 (UP).—
! The nation cannot reserve good
health solely for the wealthy, Presi
dent Truman said today in renew
, ing his plea for legislation to pro
! vide national health and disability
i insurance for all.
He said in a message to Congress,
flown here by courier from Grand
vie, Mo., that such a program
would fill a dangerous gap by safe
guarding the health and welfare of
workers and their families — "our
most precious national resource."
He said health insurance was a
logical extension of the social se
curity system and "comprehensive
disability insurance should exist
throughout the nation."
"Of the four basic risks to these
curity of our people — unemploy
ment, old age, death and sickness—
we hdve provided some insurance
I protection against three," he said.
"Protection against the fourth —
sickness —is the major missing, ele
ment in our national social insu
rance program."
