# House Veto Power Flayed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 19 (UP).—
Sen. Carl A. Hatch, D., N.M., said
today that House threats to delay
the granting of funds for the
Greece - Turkey aid program in
volves "a strange usurpation of au
thority ... a veto power" over the
will of Congress and the President.
He referred to a recent statement
by Chairman John Taber, R., N.Y.,
of the House Appropriations Com
mittee, in which Taber demanded a
break-down of proposed expendi
tures before the committee passes
on the $400,000,000 recently author
ized for Greece and Turkey. ,
Hatch said that if the sum were
not granted promptly it would mark
a committee attempt "to nullify"
the will of Congress and the people.
He termed Taber's statement
"most unusual, a most strange
usurpation of authority to attempt
to exercise a veto power over 1 both
branches of Congress and the Pres
ident of the United States."
Hatch said he meant "no criti
cism" of Taber and that he was not
charging the House chairman with
dilatory conduct.
He made his statement as a 22-
man State, War and Navy Depart
ment team left by plane for Turkey
to chart that country's military
needs under the aid program.
The mission will confer with
Turkish officials on the handling of
the aid program. Under the aid
bills, Turkey is slated to receive
about $100,000,000, practically all of
it in military equipment urgently
needed by the large but poorly
equipped Turkish army.
