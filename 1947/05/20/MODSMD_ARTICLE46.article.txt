# Shuffling the Cards with DON DAVIES
## 
### 
PASADENA. January 1. 1948—
The Vow Boys came back to the
Hose Bowl today, and the Arroyo
Seco is still ringing from the 95,000
voices that roared as one, as the
Stanford Indian rose up in the last
lew seconds of play to fell the be
hemoths from Minnesota.
The 1947 Stanford Vow Boys, un
like their predecessors of the, mid
dle thirties, weren't given a chance
to upset the galloping Gophers
from the midwest. These same In
dians were overlooked by the pre
season experts who doped the Ore
gon State Beavers to fight it out
with the defending champs from
Westwood for the Rose Bowl hon
ors—they were wrong then, and
they were wrong again, today
IDLE DREAMING?
Idle dreaming? Sure it is, and
we're prejudiced, too — but the
dreaming may not be so wild as it
seems. Marchie Schwartz may come
up with a team next fall that will
be capable of earning itself a free
ride to the Arroyo. It will be far
from an easy job, though, with one
of the toughest schedules in the
Farm's history. The Cards take on
Idaho, Michigan, Santa Clara,
UCLA, Washington, Oregon State,
Southern California, Oregon, and
Cal on consecutive Saturdays.
The Farm's headman is faced with
a major job of rebuilding during
Spring practice. There are at least
12 line letterwinners from last fall's
surprising squad, that will not be
back next fall. Dave DcSwarte,
Jack Eller, Dave Brown, Babe Hig
gins, and Bob Hall will be missing
at the end posts. Regular tackles
Fred Boench. Jim Cox, and Char
lie Wakefield are gone, as are guards
Bill Hachten. Dick Madigan, Harvey
Bernhard, and Ed Keblusek.
NOT SO GLOOMY, PLEASE
But the picture isn't all one of
gloom. At the end spot Marchie still
bus lanky Ted Burke, who improved
last toward the close of the '46 sea
son and has been looking good this
Spring. Big Gene Martin has moved
from his regular backfield spot and
has the savvy and the speed to make
a top-notch wingman. Other end
possibilities are returning squadmen
Ed Culin, Bob Henry, and Mel Ken
dall, another transplanted back,
Jack Crahan, and a whole raft of
graduates from the '46 Jayvee squad.
What about the tackle posts?
Lettermen Pinky Phleger and A 1
Rau are both back as are squadmen
Harry Ferris, Ted Liljenwall, Vic
Conde, and Bob Abrams. Newcomer
Whit Budge has been nothing short
of sensational during the spring
practice grind, and may be in line for i
a regular berth next fall. Verne
Purcell from last year's great Men- i
lo J.C. team, has also been work- j
ing well at tackle, not to mention a
half dozen boys up from the Jayvees.
BERRYMAN HUSTLES
Hustling Bob Berryman and !
Marty Feldman, both '46 letlerwin- !
iters, will be on hand to handle the j
guard chores. John Clark and Bob [
Phelps are returning .squadmen, Jim J
McKillip and Joe Pickering are up \
from the Jayvees, and Paul St re- j
mie from Santa Rosa Junior Col- J
lege, and John Leslie from John |
Muir Junior College are standout
guard prospects.
The center position looks strong J
again with the three top centers j
from last year's squad returning. |
Pete August, Dick " Flatland, and
Dorsey Kindlcr will all be back, but i
August may be switched to end. j
Squadmen returning to pivot action i
are Bob Regier and Buddy Scott, !
plus Sid Smith and Dean Borba
from the Jayvees.
We're going to have the best back
field in the Conference, with letter
men Lloyd Merriman, Bob Ander
son, Wayne Erickson, Ainslee Bell, \
George Quist, Mickey Titus, Buck

Brownson, Don Zuppettini, and
Aubrey Devine Jr., returning.
That very briefly is the picture.
The backfield. great; the line, im
proving; the spirit, tops. So don't
say we didn't tell you so, if when
you pick up the evening paper on
January Ist and read "The Vow
Boys came back to the Rose Bowl
today."
