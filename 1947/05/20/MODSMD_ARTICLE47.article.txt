# Ball Club Invades Moraga
## 
### 
The Indian ball players, who were
victimized twice last week on strange
diamonds and by strange scores, are
scheduled to pay a return call to the
Moraga diamond of St. Mary's last
place Gaels in the last game of the
1947 series between the two teams.
Larry Wolf, veteran righthander,
will pitch as the Cardinals seek to
snap a two-game losing streak and
break the travel jinx that has been
haunting them all season long.
Out oi the eight games away from
played this year, they have been
home that the Farm boys have
able to win only two—and one of
them was from nearby Moflett
Field.
The only other scalp the invading
Indians have been able to lift on the
road was U.C.L.A.'s, and that one
was small satisfaction for the three
other Southland lickings the In
dians took before they returned to
the peace of the Farm two months
ago.
But for their road performances,
the Cardinals would be right up
there battling for the C.1.8.A. title,
for at home they have been vir
tually unbeatable.
On the Sunken Diamond, the In
dians have racked up an awesome
record of 16 victories in 17 oflicial
starts, and five out of six of those
were C.1.8.A. wins.
Up until Santa Clara and U.S.F.
clipped the Cardinals last week,
the Farm Boys had been riding high
with 11 wins in their last 12 starts,
the last six being consecutive.
Today, the Indians have the task
of moving back towards third place
in the book standings, for the Uclans
nosed them out last week with two
smashing triumphs over the Cali
fornia Bears.
If they win today, they'll still be
in fourth place because of their
percentages, but their bids for third
will have a much more solid founda
ion in the closing days of the hec
'.ic 1947 season.
Coach Harry Wolter has named
Ward Walkup to catch today, with
the rest of the lineup remaining the
same. The Indians are scheduled
to leave the campus around 11:30
this morning.

other Southland lickings the In
dians took before they returned to
the peace of the Farm two months
ago.
But for their road performances,
the Cardinals would be right up
there battling for the C.1.8.A. title,
for at home they have been vir
tually unbeatable.
On the Sunken Diamond, the In
dians have racked up an awesome
record of 16 victories in 17 oflicial
starts, and five out of six of those
were C.1.8.A. wins.
Up until Santa Clara and U.S.F.
clipped the Cardinals last week,
the Farm Boys had been riding high
with 11 wins in their last 12 starts,
the last six being consecutive.
Today, the Indians have the task
of moving back towards third place
in the book standings, for the Uclans
nosed them out last week with two
smashing triumphs over the Cali
fornia Bears.
If they win today, they'll still be
in fourth place because of their
percentages, but their bids for third
will have a much more solid founda
ion in the closing days of the hec
'.ic 1947 season.
Coach Harry Wolter has named
Ward Walkup to catch today, with
the rest of the lineup remaining the
same. The Indians are scheduled
to leave the campus around 11:30
this morning.
