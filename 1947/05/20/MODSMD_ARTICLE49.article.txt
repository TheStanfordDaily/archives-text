# Poloists Downed, 5-0
## 
### 
Stanford's polo hopefuls collided with some tough opposi
tion down Santa Cruz way last Sunday afternoon when they took
on the Pogonip Polo Club for a rough and tumble four chukker
game. Although nursing a few bruises and a 5-0 defeat, the
Farm's hockey-on-horseback gang can derive some satisfaction

from the fact that they held an
older, more experienced team to a
low final score by good defensive
play.
The starting lineup for the Cards
included captain Bill Foster in the
number 3 post, forwards Bill Decker
and Bill Dirker, and Bob Lawson
at fullback. Playing for the Santa
Cruz team were nationally known
4-goaler Dick Collins, Dr. Barron,
Ed Winnett, Dr. Johnson and substi
tutes Mrs. Pat Winnett and Dr.
Clapper. Shaken up by a collision
at the end of the first half, the
Farm's Lawson was replaced by Rose
Marie Wallis and later, Lynn Mad
lener.
TIGHT DEFENSIVE PLAY
Trailing at the end of the first
half by four goals, the Roughs
tightened up their defensive play
for the remainder of the game and
held their opponents to a single ad
ditional tally. Although- deep in
enemy territory several times, the
Card aggregation couldn't quite fol
low up with a scoring drive at the
goal posts.
NEXT MATCH ON FARM
Next on the schedule for the Stan
ford Polo Association is a match

with the Palo Alto Ranchers, to be
played, this Saturday at 10 a.m. on
the Farm's polo field. The field is
located just south of the Stadium.


TWO STANFORD WILLOW WALLOPERS. Bill Decker and Boh
Lawson, fight for possession of the hall in a recent practice session of
the Polo Association. It is a lesson in "riding off" for both riders and
ponies and is an important part of their training.
