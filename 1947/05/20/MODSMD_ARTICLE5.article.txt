Veterans who expect to continue
at Stanford through summer quar
ter under the G1 Bill must report to
the veterans' desk in the lobby of
the Administration Building during
pre-registration, today through Fri
day, announced Veterans' Co-ordi
nator George D. Barahal.
"Unless these prior arrangements
have been made with the Veterans
Administration, training and sub
sistence allowances will be inter
rupted automatically at the end of
this quarter," Mr. Barahal stated.
Also, veterans who plan to trans
fer to other institutions for the
summer only and return to Stan
ford for autumn quarter are urged
to report at this same time, he said.
This is necessary to arrange for
supplemental certificates of eligi
bility necessary at the new institu
tions.
