## A 						Definite Improvement 
### 
Rally Com tryouts ended yesterday and the
new members will be announced Thursday
night at Excom. About 30 people were inter
viewed on each of four days of tryouts.
The interviews were very well handled this
/ear, showing great improvement over the
, ( rc.i'tdure in the past two years. The corn
,,i:tee heads are getting recommendations
ioi all the persons who tried out, and they
have Quad pictures of all the tryoutees so
they can identify them when making their
choices —it is so hard to remember 120 people
by their names alone.
All the persons trying out were asked their

qualifications for serving on the committee—
their experience in making posters, writing
skits, and other activities necessary for Rally
Com membership. They were also asked to
give criticisms of this year's activities plus
suggestions and ideas for improvement, and
ways to liven up spring and winter quarter
Rally Com activities.
Because of the diligence of the committee
heads in conducting the tryouts and the care
with which they are choosing their members,
we can expect a good Rally Com next year,
one that will be ready for hard and construc
tive work.—N.B.
