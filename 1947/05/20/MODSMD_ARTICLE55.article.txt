# BULL SESSION

### TOM SELF 
/ Of course the "Buwlout" isn't the Bawlout any
nu»ue.--> That is, it no longer gives the grade point
of students. This more interesting part of
ma; Student Directory was emasculated by the busi
ness department in an economy move to save a few
dollars, even though they raised the price 07 per cent.
It used to be standard practice for a Rough to look
up a blind date's Bawlout average. If she was
straight A, the issue could well be in doubt. On the
other hand, if she was just a few points plus, say in
the School of Social Sciences, he could figure nhe was
an all-around kid, maybe even halfway pretty.

Still the Bawlout is an interest
ing gimmick. Especially if you're
looking for a way to procrastinate
instead of studying —or for a
means to fill a Bull Session.
Girls say the first thing they do
after an introduction to a new fel
low is to run home for a Bawlout
check, to see if he has a dagger
after his name. And, incidentally,
there are over 1,400 married men
at Stanford now, which cuts that
ratio down considerably.
The statisticians say that Smith,
Jones, Brown, and Johnson are the
4 A

most common American names. mMW'
This is true of Stanford, as is borne out by a Diroc-

Tory listing of 79 Smiths, 46 Joneses, 43 Browns,
and 38 Johnsons. The Johnsons are trailed by 30
Moores.
Duplication of names is rife, making middle names
or initials important. In one case, though, even the
middle name will not prevent confusion. There are
two Robert William Smiths.
This quarter there are only three John Thompsons
instead of the five during autumn quarter. But fully
one-half of the men with the last name Stone have
a first name of James.
Also there are four guys named Kenneth Jones,
not to mention several other pairs of Joneses, two
Marys, two Roberts, two Edwards, and two Arthurs.
Other multiples are four John Smiths, three Robert
Browns, and three Charles Browns.
Real confusion comes in again with the name
Mary Moore. Both Mary Moores live at Hurlburt.
According to the Bawlout, Stanford has repre
sentatives from every state except South Carolina.
Alpha and Omega are Abbott, Margaret Joan, and
Zimmerman, James A.
In the summaries at the end of the book it is
shown that there is an administration staff of 388
compared to an academic council of 287 (including
30 on leave). Which more or less proves an idea
we've had for a long time, that the business side of
a university today far outshadows the learning side.

not to mention several other pairs of Joneses, two
Marys, two Roberts, two Edwards, and two Arthurs.
Other multiples are four John Smiths, three Robert
Browns, and three Charles Browns.
Real confusion comes in again with the name
Mary Moore. Both Mary Moores live at Hurlburt.
According to the Bawlout, Stanford has repre
sentatives from every state except South Carolina.
Alpha and Omega are Abbott, Margaret Joan, and
Zimmerman, James A.
In the summaries at the end of the book it is
shown that there is an administration staff of 388
compared to an academic council of 287 (including
30 on leave). Which more or less proves an idea
we've had for a long time, that the business side of
a university today far outshadows the learning side.

/ Of course the "Buwlout" isn't the Bawlout any
nu»ue.--> That is, it no longer gives the grade point
of students. This more interesting part of
ma; Student Directory was emasculated by the busi
ness department in an economy move to save a few
dollars, even though they raised the price 07 per cent.
It used to be standard practice for a Rough to look
up a blind date's Bawlout average. If she was
straight A, the issue could well be in doubt. On the
other hand, if she was just a few points plus, say in
the School of Social Sciences, he could figure nhe was
an all-around kid, maybe even halfway pretty.

Still the Bawlout is an interest
ing gimmick. Especially if you're
looking for a way to procrastinate
instead of studying —or for a
means to fill a Bull Session.
Girls say the first thing they do
after an introduction to a new fel
low is to run home for a Bawlout
check, to see if he has a dagger
after his name. And, incidentally,
there are over 1,400 married men
at Stanford now, which cuts that
ratio down considerably.
The statisticians say that Smith,
Jones, Brown, and Johnson are the
4 A

most common American names. mMW'
This is true of Stanford, as is borne out by a Diroc-

Tory listing of 79 Smiths, 46 Joneses, 43 Browns,
and 38 Johnsons. The Johnsons are trailed by 30
Moores.
Duplication of names is rife, making middle names
or initials important. In one case, though, even the
middle name will not prevent confusion. There are
two Robert William Smiths.
This quarter there are only three John Thompsons
instead of the five during autumn quarter. But fully
one-half of the men with the last name Stone have
a first name of James.
Also there are four guys named Kenneth Jones,
not to mention several other pairs of Joneses, two
Marys, two Roberts, two Edwards, and two Arthurs.
