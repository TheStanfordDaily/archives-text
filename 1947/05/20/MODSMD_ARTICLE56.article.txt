"Ted Norton shows definite tendencies of follow
ing the Communist Party Line." On first reading
this sounds as if someone were trying to confuse
issues. But on second, and sober, hindsight this
statement is representative of a particularly dan
gerous type of thinking prevalent in this country
today.
Norton has repeatedly maintained that he is a
Republican. He has proven it time and time again.
But Ted is dangerous because he refuses to accept
everything that his party asks for. He disagrees with
Taft, or Vandenburg and is impudent enough to
maintain his personal dignity and integrity. For
this he is a Communist.
Are we losing sight of one of our basic creeds
which we once held so dearly in this country? Isn't
this the place where we believe in the two party
system of government? Where the corner barber
shop was noted for the different phases of opinion
that would be, and could be aired? Weren't most of

our great legislative feats promoted through a syn
thesis, compromises forged on the floor of our house
and our Senate.
Are ideas and rational thought becoming so dan
gerous in this country that even a good Republican
has to be subjected to the Red smear?
One of the advantages of the British form of gov
ernment is that they refuse to accept flowery phrases
for cold hard fact. And they demand, as voters and
citizens, that each party must present concise and
informative opinions to back its plan for governing.
We are very disappointed in Henry Wallace to
day, as the representative of the liberal element in
this country. Could it be that Wallace is operating
in a vacuum and that he has no real opposition to
pull him down to earth and make 3him present
realistic as well as idealistic solutions?
But there is one basic thing that bothers me about
the attack on Norton: If Norton is a Communist
what does that make me?
