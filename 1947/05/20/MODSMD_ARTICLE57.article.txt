To the Editor:
At the May 7 meeting of the Executive Council
of the Institute of International Relations it was re
ported that the Council's request for permission to
invite Henry Wallace to speak on foreign relations
had been refused because it had been decided that
Mr. Wallace was a "controversial figure."
This letter is not written in an attempt to question
the motives of any individual members of the admin
istration. In fact, it was implied at Wednesday's
meeting that the policy in question was not neces
sarily that of Dean Stalnaker or President Tresidder
but was the policy laid down in the "Trustees'
Manual." Nevertheless, the administration surely
owes the International Institute and the student body
an answer to the following questions: Whose policy
is it? What justification is given for such a policy?
The International Institute has just sponsored a
conference aimed at informing about international
issues; yet, when this same organization asked to
hear a man who represents one side of the present
great debate on American foreign policy, it was re
fused permission because the man is a "controversial
figure." The fact is that here is a man who,
Jess of the validity of his suggestions, has recently
talked with the heads ol state and the foreign min
isters of live important European nations. Are we to
be denied a chance to question him merely because
he is "controversial?"
The question naturally arises, who, then, is not
a "controversial figure?" Is Mr. Stassen? Mr. Hanna?
(Mr. Sargent thinks so) Mr. Hoover? (the 1932 elec
tions bear witness to the fact that there is some con
troversy surrounding him). Why even Harry Truman
seems "controversial" at times.
What man or woman who has an opinion on any
of the social questions of our day is not "controver
sial?" It may be that there is an answer. If so, the
student body is entitled to hear it!

To the Editor:
The opposition given to student government here
at Stanford is more readily noticed than are the ac
tual student policies. This opposition and incessant
friction arises directly from individual and group
student beliefs that not everyone's views are con-

sidered. One justly says that it is almost impossible
to obtain these views. But the situation can be met
part way, far enough to make our government a
"student government."
A noble attempt at making legislation! according
to student views is done by innumerable polls and
petitions. No one is satisfied with such a method.
And complete polls are very difficult to conduct.
The only solution is a more represeniative body
composed of members of every living giroup. Now
there is at least 75 per cent student opposition; a
more representative government woul<;l cut that
figure below 20 per cent. Polls need not then be
taken. Officers need not govern "as they see fit,"
usually to the consternation of the st'odent body.
The body of representatives will give student opin
ion quickly and accurately. Time and energy would
be used to best advantage.
The difficult process of altering the constitution
need not be undertaken. Excom can advantageously
use this body for advisory purposes. It would prob
ably welcome the opportunity of obtaining such ad
vice. Everyone knows that we need socnc improve
ment.

To the Editor:
After having waited in line for the better part
of half an hour, I am now (9:30 p.m.) standing (no
seats) in the Cellar trying to drink a cup of coffcc
without getting it spilled from hell to breakfast!
Under the emotional bliss born >of the situation
I am wondering for the hundredth time why in the
the Cellar isn't run the way it ought to be.
Nine times out of ten the place is closed—and the
tenth time you can't get waited on without lining
up and waiting half an hour.
Somewhere I got the drab idea this is supposed
to be a "Student Union." Why dcesn't the student
government devote less time attempting (o run the
weighty affairs of the planet and g;ive more attention
to such mundane matters as running the Cellar more
than two or three crowded hours a day.
This is one time when I think there is some
thing to the old gripe that "the war is over."

a "controversial figure?" Is Mr. Stassen? Mr. Hanna?
(Mr. Sargent thinks so) Mr. Hoover? (the 1932 elec
tions bear witness to the fact that there is some con
troversy surrounding him). Why even Harry Truman
seems "controversial" at times.
What man or woman who has an opinion on any
of the social questions of our day is not "controver
sial?" It may be that there is an answer. If so, the
student body is entitled to hear it!

To the Editor:
The opposition given to student government here
at Stanford is more readily noticed than are the ac
tual student policies. This opposition and incessant
friction arises directly from individual and group
student beliefs that not everyone's views are con-

sidered. One justly says that it is almost impossible
to obtain these views. But the situation can be met
part way, far enough to make our government a
"student government."
A noble attempt at making legislation! according
to student views is done by innumerable polls and
petitions. No one is satisfied with such a method.
And complete polls are very difficult to conduct.
The only solution is a more represeniative body
composed of members of every living giroup. Now
there is at least 75 per cent student opposition; a
more representative government woul<;l cut that
figure below 20 per cent. Polls need not then be
taken. Officers need not govern "as they see fit,"
usually to the consternation of the st'odent body.
The body of representatives will give student opin
ion quickly and accurately. Time and energy would
be used to best advantage.
The difficult process of altering the constitution
need not be undertaken. Excom can advantageously
use this body for advisory purposes. It would prob
ably welcome the opportunity of obtaining such ad
vice. Everyone knows that we need socnc improve
ment.

After having waited in line for the better part
of half an hour, I am now (9:30 p.m.) standing (no
seats) in the Cellar trying to drink a cup of coffcc
without getting it spilled from hell to breakfast!
Under the emotional bliss born >of the situation
I am wondering for the hundredth time why in the
the Cellar isn't run the way it ought to be.
Nine times out of ten the place is closed—and the
tenth time you can't get waited on without lining
up and waiting half an hour.
Somewhere I got the drab idea this is supposed
to be a "Student Union." Why dcesn't the student
government devote less time attempting (o run the
weighty affairs of the planet and g;ive more attention
to such mundane matters as running the Cellar more
than two or three crowded hours a day.
This is one time when I think there is some
thing to the old gripe that "the war is over."

At the May 7 meeting of the Executive Council
of the Institute of International Relations it was re
ported that the Council's request for permission to
invite Henry Wallace to speak on foreign relations
had been refused because it had been decided that
Mr. Wallace was a "controversial figure."
This letter is not written in an attempt to question
the motives of any individual members of the admin
istration. In fact, it was implied at Wednesday's
meeting that the policy in question was not neces
sarily that of Dean Stalnaker or President Tresidder
but was the policy laid down in the "Trustees'
Manual." Nevertheless, the administration surely
owes the International Institute and the student body
an answer to the following questions: Whose policy
is it? What justification is given for such a policy?
The International Institute has just sponsored a
conference aimed at informing about international
issues; yet, when this same organization asked to
hear a man who represents one side of the present
great debate on American foreign policy, it was re
fused permission because the man is a "controversial
figure." The fact is that here is a man who,
Jess of the validity of his suggestions, has recently
talked with the heads ol state and the foreign min
isters of live important European nations. Are we to
be denied a chance to question him merely because
he is "controversial?"

be used to best advantage.
The difficult process of altering the constitution
need not be undertaken. Excom can advantageously
use this body for advisory purposes. It would prob
ably welcome the opportunity of obtaining such ad
vice. Everyone knows that we need socnc improve
ment.

To the Editor:
After having waited in line for the better part
of half an hour, I am now (9:30 p.m.) standing (no
seats) in the Cellar trying to drink a cup of coffcc
without getting it spilled from hell to breakfast!
Under the emotional bliss born >of the situation
I am wondering for the hundredth time why in the
the Cellar isn't run the way it ought to be.
Nine times out of ten the place is closed—and the
tenth time you can't get waited on without lining
up and waiting half an hour.
Somewhere I got the drab idea this is supposed
to be a "Student Union." Why dcesn't the student
government devote less time attempting (o run the
weighty affairs of the planet and g;ive more attention
to such mundane matters as running the Cellar more
than two or three crowded hours a day.
This is one time when I think there is some
thing to the old gripe that "the war is over."
