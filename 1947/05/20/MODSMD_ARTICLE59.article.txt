# Society Would Survive If Whole Human Being Is Understood--Dodds
## 
### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
To understand the total human being—physiologically, psychologically,
environmentally, and spiritually—is the function of a possible collabora
tion of humanities and anthropology. Upon the development of this total
humanity, "the survival of our particular civilization depends," Dean John
Dodds told the Humanities-Anthropology Conference which met in Santa
Barbara last weekend.

The exploratory conference, made
posisble by a grant from the Viking
Fund of New York, sought a pos
sible relationship between the two
fields to bring them together in
working co-operation for a similar
program of study.
STANFORD REPRESENTED
Dean Dodds, accompanied by 15
members of the Stanford faculty,
met with representatives of five
other Western univxersities and
with Dr. Ralph Linton, professor of
anthropology of Yale University.
Speaking for the humanists, Dean
Dodds found the most "fruitful
point of contact between the two
fields to be in the field of cultural
dynamics, and in the emerging
studies of personality and character
structure."
In exploring the combination of
these two fields, Dean Dodds real
ized the difficult problem of adjust
ing the techniques of the humanist
to those of the anthropologist (and
vice versa) and of finding a common
method. He said that the so-called
"meta-anthropology" and "applied
anthropology" have already pointed
steps in that direction.
FIELDS CORRELATE
"Both fields need each other very
much. Anthropology, so much con
cerned with religion, art, and liter
ature as social forces, needs to con
sult with scholars who have made
the study of those forms of human
activity their specialty. The human
ist needs the depth and texture that
comes from the anthropologist's
perception of the human problem in
its total cultural pattern," he said.
Emphasizing the exploratory na
ture of the conference, Dean Dodds
said that the proceedings were very
successful and a great interest was
shown by both the anthropologists
and the humanists attending. He
expressed the hope that it would be
the first in a long series of steps
toward the final contact of the two
fields and ultimate creation of a new
field.
He described humanities as in
cluding literature, history, music,
art, drama, and philosophy, and
functioning in the humanization of
man in society. It is concerned with
values, and its method is a synthe
sizing rather than an analytical one.
This definition he contrasted with
the "culture" of anthropology which
is merely the statement of the con

ditions under which the culture of
the humanist is made possible and
is more concerned with the estab
lishment of norms.
RELATION TO GROUP
"Humanism which stresses only
the individual is incomplete," he re
iterated. It must somehow relate
the individual to the group." This
could be accomplished by making
humanities sociological to the extent
that the humanist realizes the im
portance of character and person
ality, and the impact of different
cultures upon his own. This is
where anthropology and humanities
interlace.
He charged that social scientists
of today are "so busy proving their
sciencehood that they have abdi
cated their function to serve the
needs of a society desperately hun
gry for their help." For this reason,
civilization needs the anthropolo
gist's interpretations of what he sees
and knows to "explore values." Hu
manities, he says, will bring the
values to life.
