American students may receive
scholarships to European universi
ties, under terms of the Fulbright
Bill passed by Congress, announced
Lois Davidson, chairman of the ed
ucation committee of the Interna
tional Information Institute.
Funds for the scholarships would
be provided by the European na
tions in part payment of their debts
to the United States, Miss Davidson
said.
The State Department is now set
ting up the machinery to handle ap
plications for the proposed scholar
ships, and has indicated that veter
ans of both World Wars will have
priority.
Applications should be available
to interested students sometime this
summer or early next fall, accord
ing to Miss Davidson. She expects
that universities in England, France,
Italy, and Germany will be included
in the list of schools open to schol
arship recipients.
Further information will be re
leased by the International Infor
mation Institute as soon as it is re
ceived, Miss Davidson promised.
