# Atom Plant To Be Built By British

### 
LONDON, May 19 (UP). â€”Brit-
ain's first atomic energy power plant
to pump much - needed electricity
into the country's power network
will be built on the almost deserted
Irish Sea coast of West Cumberland
near the hamlet of Drigg, 250 miles
northwest of London, the Daily Ex
press said today.
Several chain - reaction uranium
"engines" will be set up and will be
in production within five years, the
Express said. They will cost an es
timated t'7,000.000 ($28,000,000) and
will produce about 75,000 kilowatts,
enough to light a city as large as
Liverpool with a population of 855,-
000.
The Express said the plant would
resemble other chain-reacting ura
nium piles in most respects. The
principal innovation, it was said,
was discovery of a method of ex
tracting surplus heat from the pile
in the form of gas rather than by
use of the American practice of
cooling the pile by pumping enor
mous amounts of water through it.
This would eliminate the danger
of dangerously contaminating water
flowing into the Irish Sea, it was
said, and allegedly would permit ra
dioactive elements to be dissipated
harmlessly into the air.
The Express said Drigg was cho
sen as a site because it is in a
sparsely populated area where the
danger of casualties from radioac
tive fumes would be eliminated.
The Atomic Energy Council had
recommended that a 20-mile-wide
belt surrounding the plant be cleared
of human habitation, the Express
said, this recommendation could
be fulfilled easily at Drigg.
The article, signed by Chapman
Pincher, the Express science writer,
said other engines would be built on
the Drigg site if the first one suc
ceeded and that a second plant
would be established somewhere in
Scotland.
