SAN FRANCISCSO, May 20 (UP).—Henry A. Wallace charged
today that America and Russia alike, as well as other nations,
have sabotaged the late President Roosevelt's ideal of a united
world and turned back to power politics.
"The time has come to retrace our steps," Wallace said, "back to San
Francisco and the hopes that were held out here for one world."
The former Cabinet Member and Vice President, now on a nationwide
campaign opposing the"Truman Doctrine," spoke in the War Memorial
opera house where little more than two years ago the United Nations was
born.
The Soviet and her satellites, including Yugoslavia, cannot be absolved

SAN FRANCISCSO (UP). —Henry A. Wallace said tonight he was
"grateful" to those who refused to let him speak in the Hollywood Howl
and at the University of California because "they gained me enormous
sympathy."
Wallace agreed to address a large group of students at a meeting
in Berkeley, Cal., streets Thursday after University of California au
thorities ruled he could not appear at the campus Greek Theater.

from blame for weakening the structure of the United Nations that was
conceived to bring about one world, Wallace declared.
"The responsibility for that weakness rests on all of us. Russia sought
many objectives outside of the United Nations. Yugoslavia and many
countries, showed little sense of loyalty to the principles of the charter."
A coalition of northern Republicans and some southern Democrats here
in America, accepted by President Truman, contrived to destroy the
Roosevelt program of social and economic reforms, he said.
"This meant abandoning the Roosevelt tradition, abroad and at home,"
Wallace said. "America began to lose her faith in the usefulness of world
cooperation and the possibilities of lasting peace."
