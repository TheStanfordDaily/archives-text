## 
### 
Gene Mitguard has been reap
pointed student manager, A 1 Mas
ters, graduate manager, announced
yesterday.
Mitguard took over the office Jan.
27 following the resignation of Joan
McDonough.
Masters said the reappointment
was made following two or three
interviews with students intefested
in filling the post. Mitguard was
chosen because he had the inside
track and personal experience in
handling the position.
"He has done a fine job of filling
in the unexpired term," said Mas
ters, "and that is why I recom
mended his reappointment."
ASSU President Martin Anderson
expressed his belief this "second
term" is not a breach of precedent
as Mitguard has not held the office
for an entii'e term.
Recommendations that Mitguard
retain the managership were made
by the student body president and
a number of other groups. Excom
did not make a formal recommen
dation, said Anderson, as that had
never been one of their functions.
