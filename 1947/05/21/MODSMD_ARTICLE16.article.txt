# U.S. Must Take Position as Creditor Nation to Avert Depression-Wallace
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The United States has been a
creditor nation since World War I
and should act as such, said Henry
A. Wallace in the course of a press
conference at the San Francisco
Press Club yesterday afternoon.
"I started making speeches on the
subject back in 1921," said Mr. Wal
lace, "warning that if the United
States as a creditor nation did not
act as a creditor nation, there would
be a crash. It didn't, and the crash
came."
The same situation exists today,
he said, but its bad features are
greatly magnified. He doesn't ex
pect a depression next year, he add
ed—although there may be a set
tling of the price structure —but it
is inevitable if the United States
continues blithely to ignore its posi
tion as the most important factor in
the world economy.
UN FUNCTION ECONOMIC
Mr. Wallace believes that ihe
most important function of the
United Nations at the present time
is economic. Foreign nations must
be built up, their standards of liv
ing raised, he feels. He advocates
the use of American capital to con
struct a scries of TVA's abroad —on
the Tigris-Euphrates, the Nile, the
Danube, and elsewhere.
Many people in this country feel
that the money should be spent at
home for roads, hospitals, and other
such social advances, he said.
"That is very important," he said,
"but we must do both. If foreign
countries are ignored, the U.S.
| standard of living will get too far
! out of step with those abroad—po-
I litically, economically, but especial
ly spiritually."
LIVING STANDARDS
If the United States accepts its
' position as a creditor nation so that

in 15 years it is importing more
than it exports, he said, the Ameri
can standard of living will rise.
Otherwise, he believes, (here will
be Communism or chaos abroad.
Should the United States again
withdraw inlo economic isolation
ism, said Mr. Wallace, there will be
a greater differential between the
American and other standards of
living—but the American standard
will be lower than it would other
wise be. Such a program would in
evitably bring on a world economic
collapse, he declared.
"What has been the efTcet of the
Truman Doctrine on the labor
movement here and abroad?" Mr.
Wallace was asked. He rubbed his

chin with his hand and thought a
moment, then said, "I know more
about what it has done in at least
five foreign countries than I do
about its results here," he said.
LABOR ABROAD SIIOCKKD
It was a great shock to labor
abroad, he continued, nnd at the
same time it gave heart to the reac
tionaries. He cited Gen. Charles de
Gaulle's return to public life as an
example. Mr. Truman undoubtedly
didn't realize that this would hap
pen, he added.
The immediate danger from Com
munism is the same as after World
War I, Mr. Truman continued. At
that time there were many foreign
soldiers fighting in Eastern Europe
in an attempt to stop the movement
but it failed;«guns can't stop Com
munism, he said —it will take a
higher standard of living.
Russia feels continuously threat
ened as long as her standard of
living remains so much below that
of the United States, said Mr. Wal
lace, and out of necessity she will
continue to deny the things we con
sider basic freedoms to her people
until that standard is raised. He
believes, however, that if he could
speak Russian, Stalin would let him
speak in Moscow in favor of the
United Nations.
COMMOTION 11 ELI'S
In commenting on the ire he has
aroused in certain circles here in
the United States because he at
tacked America's foreign policy
abroad, Mr. Wallace said:
"If you start to oppose somebody
—I mean in an unreasonable way —
you really strengthen that person.
. . . I'm really thankful for it; it
gives me a chance to bring out some
matters more strongly. Americans
like fair play, so this has all aroused
more interest than it otherwise
would have done."

nation in order to avoid economic
disorder.
