"EUR ANTIIE" O V ERTURE
"Euranthc" was composed in 1882
in an attempt to repeat the triumph
which had been won by "Der Frei
schutz." The opera was a failure,
but the overture has survived. It is
composed of melodies from the mu
sic-drama itself. The Largo episode
intended to disclose Euranthe kneel
ing before the tomb of his .slain
lover when the ghost of the dead
woman appears. This adds a touch
of eerie horror to the sccnc.
Frankenstein calls Beethoven's
Eigth the gayest of his symphonies
and the only one that has no slow
movements. It was composed in 1812
and the theme was suggested by the
mechanician Maezel's musical chro
nometer, the woodwinds playing per
sistent ticking notes resembling the
chronometer.
"Adagio and Allegro" will be con
ducted by its composer and was
composed by him in the early au

marily dramatic in character, the
main theme being stated by the
strings immediately and emphasized

is characterized by its rhythmic
drive.

Ravel, a French composer, delight
ed in things Spanish, says Frank
enstein, for he had Basque blood.
This piece is one of the many Iberian
studies made by him and was written
in 1920.
The "Suite was written

erature of the high-school band. It

Allied armies fought for liberation
and contains many folks tunes as
