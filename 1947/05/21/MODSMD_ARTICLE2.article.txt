WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP). —The State and War Depart
ments are preparing an overall plan of the world's economic
needs which some high American officials estimate will cost the
United States $5,000,000,000 annually for three or four years, it
v/as disclosed today.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall told his news conference that
his new long range planning board was making the study, the first of its
kind in American history.
But, in response to a question, he said he saw no necessity at this time —
and he emphasized '"at this time"—for further appropriations of the Greek-
Turkish aid program type although he exempted Korea from this statement.
What develops in the future remains to be seen, he said.
His undersecretary, Dean Acheson, gave a partial answer to that 10
days ago when he said the United States would have to undertake further
vast emergency financing of foreign purchases here, either by grant or by
loans, "if foreign countries are to continue to buy in 1948 and 1949 the
commodities which they need to sustain life and at the same time rebuild
their economies."
