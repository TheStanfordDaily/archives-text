# KSU Answers Stanford Frost Warnings With Melodramatic 'Pathway to Passion'
## 
### GERRY STAVIG 
"From out of the soul of Amer
ica comes the saga of 'Pathway to
Passion,' the truer-than-life story
of Cynthia St. Claire."
Amid the melodramatic strains of
"None But the Lonely Heart," the
saccharine - voiced commercials of
Aunt Martha and the frantic pro
testations of author-actor-announc
er-director A 1 Armer, 15 minutes of
radio time are consumed each Mon
day and Wednesday night by KSU's
answer to the frost warnings, "Path
way to Passion."
Cynthia is after Jeffrey who is
alt -r Emilie who is alter Timothy
who is after all the wealthy manu
facturers of Glubhel's Double Bub
ble Gum.
PASSION, SMUGGLING, lIUMOK
The drama is characterized by
heart-rending passion, spine-chill
ing smuggling, and roll-in-th '•-aisle
humor: "Venetian blinds reminds
me of a book by Steinbeck, 'Drapes
of Lafh'."
Armer contends that the outstand
ing success of the program is due
to the fact that the cast was chosen
on the basis of similarity to real
life situations. Jeffrey, the dashing,
wealthy playboy, is portrayed by a
Bio-lab instructor. Cynthia, the so
phisticated. sexy heroine, is played
by a residence director at Lag. Emi

lie, a vicious, gold - digging, car -
mad siren, is enacted by a Roble
fresh inan.
