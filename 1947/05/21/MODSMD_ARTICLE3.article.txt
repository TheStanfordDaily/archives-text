LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., May 20 (UP).â€”The United States im
plied today that Russia was trying to "paralyze" a United Na
tions subcommission in the Balkans, and that three Communist
influenced Balkan countries were showing "deliberate defiance
of UN."
American delegate Herschel Johnson asked the UN Security Council
to kill a Russian resolution which would curtail activities of the Balkan
subcommission. He said the council also should refuse to accept the "inept
and shortsighted" defiance of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania.
Those countries have announced that they can not cooperate with an
UN subcommission which was set up to police Balkan borders until the
Security Council acts on border incidents. They complained that they were
not consulted when the parent UN Balkan commission set up the sub
commission.
Johnson appealed to the representatives from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria,
and Albania to withdraw their objections to cooperating with the sub
commission, as they had "put themselves in the grave position of a delib
erate defiance of the UN."
