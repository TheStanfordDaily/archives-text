"Just how much voice do college
students have in their own athletic
afTairs? An interesting test is in the
making.
"Recently, as reported here, the
Stanford Daily called on its athletic
officials to schedule USF and St.
Mary's in addition to Santa Clara.
The article suggested the confer
ence be divided itno northern and
southern sections, with California,
Stanford, USC, UCLA, St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, USF, and possibly
Loyola playing a round - robin in
this area. (Note: We suggested that
the southern schools play five
teams from their section, not neces
sarily a round-robin.)
"New Editor Dick Desmond of the
St. Mary's Collegian, son of State
Senator Earl Desmond of Sacra
mento, has come out editorially
praising—and re-echoing the senti
ments of the Stanford Daily.
"'We hope that athletic officials
of Stanford and St. Mary's will see
their way clear to once again foster
annual (football) games between the
two schools, writes Editor Desmond.
'Such contests, if revived, would find
hearty response not only by stu
dents but by football fans in the en
tire Bay Area.'
"Well, there it is. The students
have spoken. Athletic officials and
educators proclaim the game be
longs to the boys. Does it? This
should be an interesting test all
right. ..."
We have been quoting from Jack
Rosenbaum's sports column in the
San Francisco News. Thanks for the
nice words, Mr. Rosenbaum, and we
hope the fathers of the Conference
will see it the same way.

The Stanford track team proved
to be the big surprise of the West
Coast Relays last Saturday at Fres
no. The Indians, who have yet to
win a dual meet, grabbed 28 points
and a third place against the coast's
top track and field offerings. Out
standing individual performance
was Bud Held's amazing javelin
toss. Held let fly a 212-foot 10-inch
toss, which is the best collegiate toss
of the current season. It it also be
lieved to be a world's freshman in
tercollegiate record.

Rosenbaum's sports column in the
San Francisco News. Thanks for the
nice words, Mr. Rosenbaum, and we
hope the fathers of the Conference
will see it the same way.

The Stanford track team proved
to be the big surprise of the West
Coast Relays last Saturday at Fres
no. The Indians, who have yet to
win a dual meet, grabbed 28 points
and a third place against the coast's
top track and field offerings. Out
standing individual performance
was Bud Held's amazing javelin
toss. Held let fly a 212-foot 10-inch
toss, which is the best collegiate toss
of the current season. It it also be
lieved to be a world's freshman in
tercollegiate record.
