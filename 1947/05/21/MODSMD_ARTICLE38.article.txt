# SC Trojans Eye '48 Rose Bowl
## 
### BILL HACHTEN 
Editor's note: This is the first in a series of stories on the prospects
of the nine teams on Stanford's I!M7 football schedule.
Down in Los Angeles where the Trojans are winding up their
Spring football practice, they say that Jeff Cravath is coming up
with a powerful U.S.C. eleven that's headed straight for Pasadena
on January first.
The reason for this optimism is a heavy and rugged line, deep

in reserves, which will probably be
the best on the coaast. Also, the Tro
jans are well supplied with fast and
experienced backs from the li)4(i
squad.
The Stanford-S.C. game in the
Coliseum on November Bth may well
prove to be the most crucial game
on the Indians' schedule. For if the
lighter Card linemen can outcharge
(wo or three heavy Trojan lines for
JO minutes in that L.A. heat, they
should be able to handle any team in
the conference.
Despite rumors to the contrary,
Cravath will continue to use his var
iation of the "T" formation, with its
"stutter" plays and double team
blocking. This spring he has laid
great emphasis on passing plays and
quick-opening plays through the
line. He told his squad that his first
two teams for next fall would be
chosen in spring practice and that
every letterman had better report to
insure his position—regardless of any
spring sports.
The starting lineup right now con
sists of nine lettermen, three of
whom have won All-Coast honors.
Anchoring the line are two 240
pound tackles, John Ferraro and
Bob Hendren, the two regular tack
les in 1946. Ferraro, All Coast last
year, will be playing his fourth year
of varsity competition. Hendren,

who towers 6 feet G inches, is an ex
cellent blocker.
Letterman Don Clark, 210, gets
the call at left guard and Fred Mc-
Call, who lettered in '41 and '42, has
the inside track at right guard. Walt
McCormick, the regular center last
year, will again be back to hold
down the pivot spot.
The uncertain end positions seem
to be well taken care of by Ernie
Tolman, a fine pass receiver, and
Scotty Lloyd. A Notre Dame trans
fer, Lloyd is already being men
tioned as the standout end on the
Coast.
At left half will be Ted Tannehill,
All Coast in '45; who was injured
most of last season. He will be ably
backed up by Johnny Na'umau, the
Hawaiian speedster who was so hot
against Stanford last fall. '44 All-
Coaster Gordon Gray and Art Bat
tle seem to be fighting it out for the
light half position. Battle, who is a
better blocker and defensive man,
will probably nose out the highly
publicized Gray.
George Murphy seems to have the
edge over Don Doll, a converted
halfback, and Dean Dill for quarter
back. The fullback position is wide
open with Verl Lillywhite, Johnny
Kordick, John Rossota.
Tomorrow U.C.L.A. prospects will
be reviewed.

experienced backs from the li)4(i
squad.
The Stanford-S.C. game in the
Coliseum on November Bth may well
prove to be the most crucial game
on the Indians' schedule. For if the
lighter Card linemen can outcharge
(wo or three heavy Trojan lines for
JO minutes in that L.A. heat, they
should be able to handle any team in
the conference.
Despite rumors to the contrary,
Cravath will continue to use his var
iation of the "T" formation, with its
"stutter" plays and double team
blocking. This spring he has laid
great emphasis on passing plays and
quick-opening plays through the
line. He told his squad that his first
two teams for next fall would be
chosen in spring practice and that
every letterman had better report to
insure his position—regardless of any
spring sports.
The starting lineup right now con
sists of nine lettermen, three of
whom have won All-Coast honors.
Anchoring the line are two 240
pound tackles, John Ferraro and
Bob Hendren, the two regular tack
les in 1946. Ferraro, All Coast last
year, will be playing his fourth year
of varsity competition. Hendren,

who towers 6 feet G inches, is an ex
cellent blocker.
Letterman Don Clark, 210, gets
the call at left guard and Fred Mc-
Call, who lettered in '41 and '42, has
the inside track at right guard. Walt
McCormick, the regular center last
year, will again be back to hold
down the pivot spot.
The uncertain end positions seem
to be well taken care of by Ernie
Tolman, a fine pass receiver, and
Scotty Lloyd. A Notre Dame trans
fer, Lloyd is already being men
tioned as the standout end on the
Coast.
At left half will be Ted Tannehill,
All Coast in '45; who was injured
most of last season. He will be ably
backed up by Johnny Na'umau, the
Hawaiian speedster who was so hot
against Stanford last fall. '44 All-
Coaster Gordon Gray and Art Bat
tle seem to be fighting it out for the
light half position. Battle, who is a
better blocker and defensive man,
will probably nose out the highly
publicized Gray.
George Murphy seems to have the
edge over Don Doll, a converted
halfback, and Dean Dill for quarter
back. The fullback position is wide
open with Verl Lillywhite, Johnny
Kordick, John Rossota.
Tomorrow U.C.L.A. prospects will
be reviewed.
Editor's note: This is the first in a series of stories on the prospects
of the nine teams on Stanford's I!M7 football schedule.
Down in Los Angeles where the Trojans are winding up their
Spring football practice, they say that Jeff Cravath is coming up
with a powerful U.S.C. eleven that's headed straight for Pasadena
on January first.
The reason for this optimism is a heavy and rugged line, deep

in reserves, which will probably be
the best on the coaast. Also, the Tro
jans are well supplied with fast and
experienced backs from the li)4(i
squad.
