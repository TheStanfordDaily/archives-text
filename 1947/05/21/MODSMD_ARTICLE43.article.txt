# Gaels Mash Cards
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
St. Mary's Gaels weren't very polite hosts yesterday after
noon at Moraga.
The blue-clad Gaels pulled the doormat out from underneath
their Indian visitors, and blasted three Farm hurlers for 20 hits
and as many runs as they coasted to an amazing 20 to 2 upset

over the Stanford baseballers.
There was nothing the Indians
could do as the inning wore on and
the score piled higher and higher,
by fits and bursts.
The Gaels earned 18 of their 20
runs, and all the Farm infielders
could do was to wave at the balls as
they whizzed by just out of reach
or just over their heads.
Second baseman Jack Buick of
the Gaels slammed out four singles
and a double in six trips to the plate
and drove in five runs to lead the
exploding St. Mary's attack. He was
backed up by the clouting of Wes
Colgan, who hit a homer in the
sixth when his line drive took a tre
mendous hop over center fielder
Lloyd Merriman's head, and who
finished the game with two hits and
five runs batted in.
The Indians, who were handcuffed
for most of the game by the right
handed pitching of Brian McGold
rick,, staved off a shutout in the
ninth when Clyde Dingfelder singled
to drive in Ward Walkup and Ted
Nell.
St. Mary's took a 1-0 lead in the
first, and then racked up six more in
the third. During the next three
innings, they scored four, three and
six times to turn the game into the
yorst deteat the Indians have en
countered this season.
In the third, most of the Gaels 1
five hits were bouncing liners just
out of reach of third base and sec
ond. Again, in the fourth afid fifth
innings, the Gaels got all of their
runs on singles, but in the last big
inning, the sixth, they clouted out
a double, triple, and a homer to put

the finishing touches on their one
sided victory.
