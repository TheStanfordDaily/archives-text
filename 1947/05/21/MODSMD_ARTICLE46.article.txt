## A 						Foolproof Plan 
### 
i The plan for regulating electioneering as
proposed by Gordon Ness in Monday's Daily
is a basically sound one but it is a plan that
,vill have to undergo considerable revising
00-fore it is finally approved by Excom.
the outset, the 24 hours in which a can-
IM ito has to turn in a budget is not enough
iiiiitj for a candidate to figure estimated cam
paign expenses.
A candidate who plans a good publicity
program will need more time to arrange his
campaign.
Excom should take an active interest in elec
tions but they should necessarily not be con
cerned with watching for violations of the
electioneering program. The power to dis
qualify a candidate from office because of
fjaudulent electioneering proceedings should
be "placed in the hands of one group, prefer
ably the election committee.
The Election Board's judgment in election
eering matters should be final, subject pos
sibly to the final veto of the president of the
student body.
The plan that Election Board submits to Ex
com must be a plan that is simple in organiza
tion yet foolproof enough to meet the dangers
of the electioneering. It cannot be a plan of
nebulous regulations and penalties. Election
eering must not get out of hand.—D.K.
Aii Obvious Necessity
Monday night's meeting of administration
officials and student leaders at Dr. Alvin C.

Eurich's home was the first session of the long
awaited student-administration "forum."
In reality the get-togethers are not "forums"
in any sense of the word. The meetings are
merely informal gatherings of students and
administration officials to discuss and ex
change viewpoints regarding mutual prob
lems.
The word "forum" was coined for lack of a
better one when the plan was first conceived.
The justification for such meetings is that
student activities and administration functions
are now much more widespread than ever
before, making it difficult for persons in key
positions to get together often enough to ex
change views.
A free exchange of views has been accom
plished in the past without the necessity for
set meetings, but this was at a time when
Stanford was a much smaller school.
The meetings are the logical outcome of an
enlarged university.
There will be no momentous decisions forth
coming from the sessions, and probably very
little that will command public attention.
The meetings will accomplish their purpose
in a very quiet manner—that of exchanging
viewpoints and providing background regard
ing mutual problems of the students and the
administration.
