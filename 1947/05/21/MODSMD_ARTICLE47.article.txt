### TOM SELF 
HOW TO KILL A SNAKE
Bob Belzer (ells this saga of the demise of a rat
tlesnake on the road to Half Moon Bay. Perhaps
the story might better be titled "Why Women Aren't
Sent to War."
Belzer was cruizing along peaceably when a wo
man appeared on the road ahead flagging him down.
"Go back, go back!" she shouted. "It's a snake!"
Sure enough, there was a rattlesnake on the road.
"Well, get out of the way, I'll run over it," Belzer
replied laconically.
"No, no, you mustn't, the fangs will blow out a
tire," came the urgent rebuttal. About that time Bob
decided he was in no hurry, and resolved to watch
the woman finish off the snake in her own manner.

She picked up a stick, and just
as the snake coiled to strike, she
whacked him. The decayed stick
broke into many pieces. Her hub
by, anxious to help, though some
what abashed by his wife's forceful
attitude, started to bring another
stick. But the masterful woman,
taking stock of the situation, wailed
at her mate, "No, no, a stick's no
good. Bring a rock. Bring a big
rock."
Hubby finally found a rock big
enough to suit the commander-in
chief of the anti-snake operation.
Skillfully he approached the tar-

get, hovered for an instant, and thenâ€”bombs away.
With the snake splattered all over the pavement, the

situation well in hand, the defending forces climbed
into their model "A" and loudly chugged away.

Sororities, you know, were discontinued here to
eliminate the exclusiveness and snobbishness that
characterized Row women. Some of this "upper
crust" philosophy remains, however. There are girls
who still refer to themselves as Chi O's, Tri Delts, etc.,
rather than use the name of thjt-ir house. Others, in
the absence of sorority membership, have adopted a
philosophy that fraternity membership is the only
possible basis for social esteem among the men, sort of
a psychological transfer.
The point is best illustrated by an example. At a
party recently a Jordan girl was asked if she knew
Sam Mac Donald (meaning Sam Mac Donald, of
course). She replied, quick as a fiash, "What house
is he in?"

Contributions: Some of his buddies deposited a
slightly disorganized Toro in the middle of the Haw
thorne House living room. They expected he would
shortly snap out of it and return to his room at
Toyon. Hours passed and no developments. The
worried roomates then decided to set out in search
of the lost sheep. They found him sleeping soundly
in a haystack in the field adjoining Encina. He had
no recollection of Hawthorne House, or anything
else for that matter. Naturally his buddies are won
dering what happened in the meantime.
An anonymous telephone call informs B.S. that
the chambermaids are working in pairs.
Bertha at the Bookstore says sales of little Indian
decals have risen considerably.
