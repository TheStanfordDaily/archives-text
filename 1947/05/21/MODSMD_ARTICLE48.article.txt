That refrain from the Spring Show,

represents an interesting point of view. Frankly, as
a practical matter, I'm inclined to agree with it. In
come is the means of obtaining foot! and drink,
warmth and shelter. Without these, whether you
grow or build your own, or buy them, life is not only
difficult, it's impossible. As many student veterans
are finding out. And, again as a practical matter,
there seems to be little doubt that it is universally
man's first duty to provide for himself and his family.
To use profit and loss, income and outgo, as stand
ards of values has one sure advantage over most
other ethical systems. It is simple., easy to compre
hend, and usually easy to apply. If you expand it
beyond the mere commodities of subsistence, if you
put your ethics on a basis of pure selfishness, it is still
simpler. To quote another musical show,
"I want what I want when I want it,
It's all that makes life worth the while."
Or it can be summed up in an old saying, probably
by Anon., "If it be not good for me, what care I how
good it be." Not only is a selfish standard simple to
apply subjectively, but it would vastly simplify social
relationships in general if one could go on the basis

that all anyone wanted in life was their own material
advantage. A.s an unidentified law student once said,
"There's nothing that fouls up the law as much as the
people that want justice." And when you consider,
moreover, that our entire economy, nay. our much
touted American way of life, is based strictly on the
profit motive, I do not see how you can escape the
conclusion that Muheim enunciated a fundamental
principle of our American mores in his probably im
mortal couplet.
To be sure, having been to Stanford, you all
know that there are other things in life than money.
And seriously, when# there is a clear-cut issue in
volving one's religion, one's political principles, pa
triotic duties, scientific ethics, money falls into sec
ond place. But how often in time of (relative) peace
does such an issue present itself? Those who spend
their time looking for such issues to exploit may.

advantage. A.s an unidentified law student once said,

people that want justice." And when you consider,

profit motive, I do not see how you can escape the

To use profit and loss, income and outgo, as stand

put your ethics on a basis of pure selfishness, it is still
simpler. To quote another musical show,
