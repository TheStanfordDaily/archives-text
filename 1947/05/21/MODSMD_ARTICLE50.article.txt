### JOHN HUBBARD 
It's literary treason, but the writ
ing Rouverol family has produced
an engineer.
William Rouverol, now working
here toward a Master's degree in
engineering, started out to be a
writer, like his mother and sister.
But he decided that two authors
were enough for any family. So,
after getting a Stanford A.B. degree
in English in 1940, he returned to
school to get an A.B. in engineering
in 1943.
Before breaking away from the
literary profession, Rouverol col
laborated with his mother, Mrs. Au
rania Rouverol of Los Angeles, in
authorship of a play, "Young April."
Mrs. Rouverol, a successful play
wright, wrote the words to Stan
ford's "Come Join the Band" in
1909. The sister of the family, Jean,
is both a writer and a radio actress.
She plays the part of Betty in the
radio serial '"One Man's Family."
Young Rouverol, writer turned
engineer, says the writing branch of
the family looks with approval on
his engineering career. The rest of
them can write, but it's going to
come in handy to have someone in
the family to fix the faucets and re
place the ribbons in the book-pro
ducing typewriters.
