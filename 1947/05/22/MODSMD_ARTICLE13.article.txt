# Tresidder Says 'Accept Both Duties and Rights'
## 
### 
Expressing concern over the mis
understanding that exists between
the Stanford student body and the
administration, Donald B. Tresid
der yesterday afternoon spoke at
the Women's Conference-sponsored
leadership assembly.
''You must accept your duties as
well as your rights," Dr. Tresidder
said. He gave examples of students
who think Stanford is only a first
class hotel and who are interested
only in having a good time and get
ting an education. They become in
terested in student government Qnly
when it directly concerns them.
WORK TOGETHER
"The trouble with most students
is that they confuse t)eing citizens of
a democracy and being members of
the Stanford student body," he con
tinued. "In a democracy, complete
authority rests in the citizens, and
they are safeguarded from them
selves by the Constitution. Here
the administration controls, always
keeping in mind the desires and
needs of the students."
Dr. Tresidder told how the stu
dents and the administration work
together in formulating and carry
ing out the policy for the students
of Stanford. He said that his job
was to study what is best for the
student body and then work with
the student leaders to make out a
plan. The students and the admin
istration work together to carry out
this plan, he declared.
STUDENT FUNCTIONS
He told of the two functions of
student leaders: (1) to reflect the
views and opinions of the students
and to carry them back to the ad
ministration, and (2) to help the ad
ministration carry out its policies.
In this function, they arc delegated
administrative authority to help
keep order and to maintain the tra
ditions of Stanford, such as the
Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard.
"Personal liberty without con
trol leads to chaos and anarchy,"
Dr. Tresidder continued. "On the
other hand, complete subjection to
consideration for the common good
leads to the communistic ideal." He
stated that at Stanford we are
searching for something in between
these two—a government based on
the idea that all members are di
verse people but all have a common
interest—that of making the com
munity progress.
He concluded by repeating his
faith in student government. "Stu
dent government is one of the finest
traditions of Stanford. It rests on
rights and duties that can be stated
on paper."
