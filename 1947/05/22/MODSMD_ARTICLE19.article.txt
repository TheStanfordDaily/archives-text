# Hirohito Sends Jap Sea Shells to Farm
## 
### 
Japan's Emperor Ilirohito should be an authority on shells after what
he and his country have experienced the past few years, but there is one
type of shell which he refers to the Stanford Geology Department for
classification.
He lias just sent a shipment of Japanese sea shells and fossils to the
Farm, which has the most complete shell collection on the Pacific Coast
and one of the half-dozen largest in the United States. The emperor, who
is a competent biologist and a serious student of marine biology, wishes
to determine how many species of the shells arc common to the American
and Japanese coasts.
One of the shells sent by Ifirohito is a type never before seen in the
United States. It is of interest to both American and British scientists,

to whom Dr. Myra Keen, curator of
the Stanford collection, has for
warded a description.
The imperial collection of neatly
labeled specimens has been re
turned to Hirohito with confirma
tion of his identifications. A regal
appcaring letter of thanks from the
Japanese imperial chamberlain ac
knowledged the emperor's grati
tude.
The Stanford collection of shells
has been augmented by former
geology students who fought in the
South Pacific.
Among the exhibits now on dis
play in the Geology Department are
the shell of a 1500-pound clam, a
foot-long oyster shell, and a special
display describing a 50.000,000-ycar
old pearl found by a Stanford pro
fessor in a fossil oyster.
Although a summer sport for lay
men, shell collecting is a serious
business to scientists. Geologists
can determine from fossil shell -
bearing strata the environmental
and climatic conditions of past ages.
Shell collecting also helps unravel
geological structures leading to the
discovery of oil, metals, or deposits
of building materials.

is a competent biologist and a serious student of marine biology, wishes
to determine how many species of the shells arc common to the American
and Japanese coasts.
One of the shells sent by Ifirohito is a type never before seen in the
United States. It is of interest to both American and British scientists,

to whom Dr. Myra Keen, curator of
the Stanford collection, has for
warded a description.
The imperial collection of neatly
labeled specimens has been re
turned to Hirohito with confirma
tion of his identifications. A regal
appcaring letter of thanks from the
Japanese imperial chamberlain ac
knowledged the emperor's grati
tude.
The Stanford collection of shells
has been augmented by former
geology students who fought in the
South Pacific.
Among the exhibits now on dis
play in the Geology Department are
the shell of a 1500-pound clam, a
foot-long oyster shell, and a special
display describing a 50.000,000-ycar
old pearl found by a Stanford pro
fessor in a fossil oyster.
Although a summer sport for lay
men, shell collecting is a serious
business to scientists. Geologists
can determine from fossil shell -
bearing strata the environmental
and climatic conditions of past ages.
Shell collecting also helps unravel
geological structures leading to the
discovery of oil, metals, or deposits
of building materials.

Japan's Emperor Ilirohito should be an authority on shells after what
he and his country have experienced the past few years, but there is one
type of shell which he refers to the Stanford Geology Department for
classification.
He lias just sent a shipment of Japanese sea shells and fossils to the
Farm, which has the most complete shell collection on the Pacific Coast
and one of the half-dozen largest in the United States. The emperor, who
is a competent biologist and a serious student of marine biology, wishes
to determine how many species of the shells arc common to the American
and Japanese coasts.
