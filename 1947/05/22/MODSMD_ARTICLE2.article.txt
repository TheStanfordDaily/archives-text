# Congress Passes President's General Foreign Relief Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21 (UP).—Congress passed President Truman's
$350,000,000 General Foreign Relief Bill today and sent it to the White
House after repudiating a $150,000,000 economy cut voted by the house
last month.
Both houses accepted the report of a joint conference committee
recommending that the relief program be approved in full to head off the
imminent threat of starvation in Austria, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Poland,
China and Trieste.
The senate passed the conference report unanimously by voice vote
within a half hour after the house adopted it, 288 to 86.
The House-Senate action was a strong endorsement of President Tru
man's foreign spending policies and a setback for the house economy
bloc which had succeeded in slashing the program to $200,000,000 when the
house first passed the bill last month.
The bill does not specifically allocate funds to each of the recipient
countries, but the state department has said that the relief will be distrib
uted among the six European states and China.
The legislation is separate from the $400,000,000 Greek-Turkish aid
program, but Greece, which is ticketed for a $300,000,000 share of that
military-economic help, will get about $50,000,000 worth of aid under the
General Relief Bill.
The Greek-Trukish Bill already passed by both the House and Sen
ate was flown today to Kansas City, Mo., where President Truman will sign
it tomorrow.
