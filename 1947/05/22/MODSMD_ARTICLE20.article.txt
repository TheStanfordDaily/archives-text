# Farm Organizes Exchange Plans
## 
### 
Plans for the establishment of the two exchange scholarships
for Farm students are slowly approaching the stage at which
Administration and student officials are making tentative out
lines, Alfred Munk, head of the Information Institute has an
nounced. Marnie McKittrick has been appointed chairman of the

Institute's exchange scholarship com
mittee, Munk said. At a meeting be
tween Dean Stalnaker, Miss McKit
trick, and Munk yesterday afternoon
several points were discussed which
will clarify the status of the pro
posed scholarships.
TUITION PAID
The two separate scholarships
will run one academic year each, and
in the case of the Stanford student
will cover the tuition, room and
board at the foreign university,
while the foreign student coming to
the Farm in exchange will have his
tuition, room and board paid.
Transportation costs of the four
students involved will probably have
to be met by each himself, Munk
said. Room and board finances will
be covered from student, and alumni
sources through drives or direct
contributions, while the university
administration has expressed will
ingness to contribute the tuition.
OPEN TO JUNIORS
The scholarships arc expected to
run during the academic year of
1948-49, and will be open to Farm
students who will be juniors during
that year. Selection for the schol
arships will be made sometime dur
ing spring quarter 1948 by a joint
faculty-student board.
Selection of Farm students will
not stress scholastic achievements
although a minimum grade point
ratio 2.5 will be considered essen
tial. Linguistic mastery of the
country in which the university will
be located will be considered man
datory, as will an interest in inter
national affairs.
TWO SCHOOLS
The two schools to be selected by
the committee will be either in
Europe or South America, with
each of the two scholarships avail
able to one school only.
Only American citizens who have
received a major part of their educa
tion in the United States will be
eligible, and the emphasis will be on
no discrimination between men aftd
women.
The main purpose of these two
international exchange scholarships
is to assist American students to
learn more about foreign institutions,
and to gain a clearer insight into the
complexities of the world today.
