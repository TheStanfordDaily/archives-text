# Corp Yard Carpenters Replace Window Shades, Broken Chairs
## 
### WELLS KEDDIE 
Grant H. Olaine, foreman of
Corp Yard carpenters, dis
closed today that campus resi
dences are suffering from an
acute shortage of window
shades.
Oluine's department makes all
shades used at the University.
The shortage exists in the men's
living quarters, primarily Encina
Hall, he said. Olaine declared that
faulty shades in women's residences
are promptly replaced.
ENCINA CHAIR-SMASHERS
Encina residents—in probable re
taliation for the shade replacement
policy of the Corp Yard—smash 2,000
chairs on the average of three times
year, the foreman revealed. "En
cina is by far our best customer, but
Toyon seems to be making an effort
to take over the lead," he said
'1 he shade-protected girls of La
f'linita, RoLle and Union have their
own special revenge weapon. Vary
ing patterns of cigarette burns are
emblazoned on furniture which finds
its way into carpenter shop dur
ing the course of the school year.
KyAOE-REPLACINC,
Foreman Olaine had no comment
to make regarding a possible rever-
I or modification of the shade-re
|.lacing policy.
A refinement of the broken chair
attack in Encina is a device known
as pulling-the-doors-off-the-hinges.
The carpenter shop handles the
pioblem without changing stride,
Olaine declared.
RUSSELL FIRE
A recent fire in Russell House di
verted several carpenters from the
main task of keeping abreast of En
cina-Toyon work, the foreman said.
Me made no accusations as to the
originators oi the blaze, or its pur
pose.
Encina leaders said they had bet
tei things to do than burn down
Russell House. Besides, they added,
there were no matches left in the
Hall. The reason for the lack of
igniting sticks wis not given.
SIJBSTAN'I lAL RESOURCES
A behind-the-scenes glimpse of
the Corp Yard's delenses in the un
declared war of wood reveals that
Olaine has substantial resources
with which to continue the battle.
I wenty thousand board-feet of lum
ber ure consumed each year, 10,000
board-feet of that being plywood.
Oak is used for most of the furniture
repairs and construction.
John Uppman works constantly in
the shop repairing and building
(hairs, desks, cabinets, tables and
other often-requested furniture.
RKSER V E CA KPENTERS
Five other carpenters are avail
able for instant deployment to ac
tive lumber fronts, Olaine pointed
out, although they also assist in the
central repair headquarters. A lock
expert i.s kept busy letting key-los

ing students, professors, and admin
istrators in and out of rooms.
Not all of the work done by the
carpenters is in the nature of war
fare. Olaine said that peaceful proj
ects for the various science and en
gineering laboratories are often
built. The ASSU also i.s a frequent
customer for specially designed con
structions for rallies and dances, he
declared.
Olaine would not be quoted as to
the probable outcome of the battle
of lumber. But impartial observers
are convinced that superior reserves
will bring final victory.

RUSSELL FIRE
A recent fire in Russell House di
verted several carpenters from the
main task of keeping abreast of En
cina-Toyon work, the foreman said.
Me made no accusations as to the
originators oi the blaze, or its pur

there were no matches left in the

A behind-the-scenes glimpse of

declared war of wood reveals that
Olaine has substantial resources
with which to continue the battle.
I wenty thousand board-feet of lum
ber ure consumed each year, 10,000
board-feet of that being plywood.
Oak is used for most of the furniture
repairs and construction.
John Uppman works constantly in
the shop repairing and building
(hairs, desks, cabinets, tables and
other often-requested furniture.
RKSER V E CA KPENTERS
Five other carpenters are avail
able for instant deployment to ac
tive lumber fronts, Olaine pointed
out, although they also assist in the
central repair headquarters. A lock
expert i.s kept busy letting key-los

ing students, professors, and admin
istrators in and out of rooms.
Not all of the work done by the
carpenters is in the nature of war
fare. Olaine said that peaceful proj
ects for the various science and en
gineering laboratories are often
built. The ASSU also i.s a frequent
customer for specially designed con
structions for rallies and dances, he
declared.
Olaine would not be quoted as to
the probable outcome of the battle
of lumber. But impartial observers
are convinced that superior reserves
will bring final victory.
