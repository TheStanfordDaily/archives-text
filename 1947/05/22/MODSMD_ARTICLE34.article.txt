# Bruins Dark Horse In CIBA Campaign
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Another CIEA pennant race is galloping to a close just two weeks
hence, and it's beginning to look as if just about anything can happen
to the standings in the few games remaining.
The red-hot Uelans threw the race into its worst muddle this season
when they knocked off California twice last week to take over third place

from Stanford, and elevated them
selves into the position of dark
horse candidates for the CfBA
crown.
However, if past-season form is
any criterion, the Bruins have to he
counted out of the battle for first,
although their performance against

U.S.C. next week will have a di
rect bearing on the outcome of the
luce.
On paper, the Bruins could win
nil of their lour remaining games
and, wilb the help of Stanford and
St. Mary's, crash through to the
pennant or else throw first place in
to a three-way tie.
But that's strictly paper doodling,
for any sane observer has to con
cede the flag either to California's
slipping Bears or to U.S.C.
NOD TO TROY
We give the nod to the Trojans to
outlast the Bears jji the final days of
the campaign, even if the two teams
wind up in a dead heat and have to
play it off for the title.
Two weeks ago. it could have been
said that the Bears had the edge over
the Trojans in the pitching depart
ment, but since then the Cal hurling
corps —in the persons of Nino Bar
nise and Virg Butler—has gone to
seed and the Bears have dropped
three games in a row.
Barnise, in particular, has slipped
badly from his early season per
formances, and unless he rounds
back into his earlier form the Bears
will have to rely on the improved
Butler and the speedy Jack Jensen.
Doug Essick of the Trojans has had
sore arm trouble this season, but
even so he ranks with Ned Haskell
as one of the top Trojan hurlers
who will probably pitch when Sou
thern Cal plays St. Mary's and Cali
fornia this weekend.
BATTING FAIRLY EVEN
As far as hitting goes, the two
teams are about the same, except
that Cal has the better percentage
hitters and S.C. has the better slug
gers. Archie Wilson and Hank
Workman are the Trojan heavy ar
tillery while Ed San Clemente, John
Fiscalini and Cliff McClain are the
pace setters for the Bears.
The Trojans finish against St.
Mary's, California and U.C.L.A.
(two games), while the Bears have
only the Southern Cal and Stan
lord games left on their schedule.
As for the Indians' bid for third
place, the 20 to 2 thumping they
took Tuesday just about upset the
applecart for good. But. the Indians
still are very much in the running,
and if they can knock over Santa
Clara and the Bears next week, on
the road, they may be '"in."
WON SIX GAMES
Both the Uclans and the Indians
have won six loop games, but the
Uclans have four more games to up
that ante while the Indians have
only two. The Uclans close with two
game series against Santa Clara and
U.S.C., and need to win three out
of those four to cinch third place.
The Uclans could do it, but the
odds are more likely that they'll
split the remaining four tilts, which
puts it squarely up to the Indians
to win both of their last games and
stay in the running for a tie for
third.

stay in the running for a tie for
third.
Another CIEA pennant race is galloping to a close just two weeks
hence, and it's beginning to look as if just about anything can happen
to the standings in the few games remaining.
The red-hot Uelans threw the race into its worst muddle this season
when they knocked off California twice last week to take over third place

from Stanford, and elevated them
selves into the position of dark
horse candidates for the CfBA
crown.
However, if past-season form is
any criterion, the Bruins have to he
counted out of the battle for first,
although their performance against

U.S.C. next week will have a di
rect bearing on the outcome of the
luce.
On paper, the Bruins could win
nil of their lour remaining games
and, wilb the help of Stanford and
St. Mary's, crash through to the
pennant or else throw first place in
to a three-way tie.
But that's strictly paper doodling,
for any sane observer has to con
cede the flag either to California's
slipping Bears or to U.S.C.
NOD TO TROY
We give the nod to the Trojans to
outlast the Bears jji the final days of
the campaign, even if the two teams
wind up in a dead heat and have to
play it off for the title.
Two weeks ago. it could have been
said that the Bears had the edge over
the Trojans in the pitching depart
ment, but since then the Cal hurling
corps —in the persons of Nino Bar
nise and Virg Butler—has gone to
seed and the Bears have dropped
three games in a row.
Barnise, in particular, has slipped
badly from his early season per
formances, and unless he rounds
back into his earlier form the Bears
will have to rely on the improved
Butler and the speedy Jack Jensen.
Doug Essick of the Trojans has had
sore arm trouble this season, but
even so he ranks with Ned Haskell
as one of the top Trojan hurlers
who will probably pitch when Sou
thern Cal plays St. Mary's and Cali
fornia this weekend.
BATTING FAIRLY EVEN
As far as hitting goes, the two
teams are about the same, except
that Cal has the better percentage
hitters and S.C. has the better slug
gers. Archie Wilson and Hank
Workman are the Trojan heavy ar
tillery while Ed San Clemente, John
Fiscalini and Cliff McClain are the
pace setters for the Bears.
The Trojans finish against St.
Mary's, California and U.C.L.A.
(two games), while the Bears have
only the Southern Cal and Stan
lord games left on their schedule.
As for the Indians' bid for third
place, the 20 to 2 thumping they
took Tuesday just about upset the
applecart for good. But. the Indians
still are very much in the running,
and if they can knock over Santa
Clara and the Bears next week, on
the road, they may be '"in."
WON SIX GAMES
Both the Uclans and the Indians
have won six loop games, but the
Uclans have four more games to up
that ante while the Indians have
only two. The Uclans close with two
game series against Santa Clara and
U.S.C., and need to win three out
of those four to cinch third place.
The Uclans could do it, but the
odds are more likely that they'll
split the remaining four tilts, which
puts it squarely up to the Indians
to win both of their last games and
stay in the running for a tie for
third.
