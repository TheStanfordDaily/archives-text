# Tracksters To Compete At Modesto
## 
### 
Coach Jack Welershauser's Indian
scantyclads, who pulled a mild sur
prise by taking third in Fresno's
West Coast Relays, will be out for
a repeat performance at' the sixth
running of the Annual California
Relays at Modesto Saturday.
BUSY WEEKEND
Five members. Captain A 1 Snyder
in the high hurdles and the mile re
lay team of Maxwell, Johnson, Hoff,
and Grimes, will definitely have
their work cut out for them this
weekend. The quintet will fly south
to compete in the Los Angeles Coli
seum Relays Friday evening, and
then return via the air route in time
for the Modesto workout.
Frank Held, Stanford javelin ex
pert, will be out to prove that his
sensational toss of 212 ft. 10 in. for
the only clear-cut Indian win at
Fresno was no lucky throw and that
he really has arrived. Held bettered
his previous best by some 15 odd
feet.
GOLD WATCHES
Gold watches will be awarded to
the members of the top relay teams
and the individual champs, while
gold belt buckles will go to the other
place winners. High school and
junior college competition is due to
get under way at 1, while the first
intercollegiate and open events are
slated for 7.
