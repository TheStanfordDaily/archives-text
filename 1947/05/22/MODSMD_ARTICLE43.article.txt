# Uclans Loaded For Coming Grid Season
## 
### BILL HACHTEN 
"Loaded" is the word for the Bruins. Any way you look at it, UCLA is
the logical favorite to cop the PCC crown in 1947. Only three players, end
Burr Baldwin, tackle Don Malmberg, and quarterback Ernie Case, have
graduated from last year's championship team.
The other eight first-stringers, plus most of the reserves and a flock of

jaycee transfers, will he on the
squad that faces the Indians in the
Stanford Stadium on Oct. 18.
BACKFIELD TOPS
In the backfield, the Uclans will
be considerably stronger. All of
thoir fast, tricky halfbacks will be
returning, including Cal Rossi, Skip
Rowland, Ernie Johnson, Johnnie
Roesch, and A 1 Hoisch, the ex-
Stanford back.
"Moose" Myers, fullback, and
Jerry Shipkey, right half, both over
200 pounds, will be back in the line
up come September. A new full
back, Jerry Whitney, formerly with
USC and the El Toro Marines, has
looked good in spring practice and
should give Myers a run for his
money.
The one uncertainty in the back
field is the key quarterback posi
tion where Bennie Reiges, a second
stringer last year, is being groomed
to fill Ernie Case's shoes.
The UCLA forward wall, which
outplayed nil the conference lines
it met last year, is largely intact and

full of familiar names. Don Paul,
| 220 - pound All - Coast center, will
I again be back to hold down the
pivot spot. Mike Dimitrio, 210, and
Les Steiner, 200, the regular guards
i last year, are both returning.
CHAMBERS BACK
All - Coast Bill Chambers, 225,
looks like a cinch for right tackle,
while Bob Mike has the inside track
for Malmberg's vacated left tackle
spot. However, he'll be backed up
by John Josephs, a 225-pound All-
Conference tackle from LACC. Jo
sephs, an "A" student, was report
elly interested in Stanford but was
sidetracked to Westwood.
Rugged Tom Fears will again Ik?
!at right end. Burr Baldwin's end
seems to be taken care of by Phil
Tinsley and Bill Hoyt, who has been
a standout in spring practice.
The overconfident Bruins were
j considerably sobered by the block
| ing and tackling lesson they re
! coived from the Illini last Jan. 1 in
the Rose Bowl.
