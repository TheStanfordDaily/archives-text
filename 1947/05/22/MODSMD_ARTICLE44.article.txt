# DAILY EDITORIALS Student Manager Appointments
## 
### 
Yesterday's Daily carried a story announc
ing the appointment of the Student Manager
inr the next school year.
The Student Manager is one of the more
.portant student officers on the campus. In
, l vinq out his duties he is responsible for
mi .inns of money. He needs to have an
active interest in student affairs and have an
c 4diJ knowledge of how the various clubs,
organizations, and groups fit into the picture
at Stanford.
He personally endorses or turns down re
quests for financial assistance, or improve
ments which would involve cash outlays, to
these interests.
The office of Student Manager comes under
the jurisdiction of Mr. A 1 Masters in his ca
pacity as the financial officer of the ASSU.
He is selected by Mr. Masters who learns
of 1 potential candidates for this position by ask
ing; the Student Body president and other per
sons .with whom the Student Manager will
ivork.
This system has worked well in the past.
Presumably it will work Well in the future.
However certain changes could be made in
the selection procedure which would appear
to be improvements.
Under the present system it is probable that
many qualified persons are not considered for
the job.
There is no set way of applying for student
manager nor is there a set time that such ap
plications should be turned in. Conceivably

there are persons on the campus who, though
qualified, are not even considered for the po
sition.
It could be announced some time prior to
the actual selection that a student manager is
to be chosen, and the date given for that
choice. Interested persons could be told to
contact their Excom representative. They in
turn could report to the ASSU president prior
to the time that he makes out a list of possible
Student Managers for Mr. Masters.
This in no way would force the selection of
any candidate but would make it possible for
a candidate to make known his interest in the
job.
A definite annual date for the announce
ment of the selection should also be decided
upon.
An incoming Student Manager should be
announced early enough that he could "learn
the ropes" of his new office along with the
newly-elected ASSU officers.
The reappointment of Gene Mitguard as
Student Manager is an exceptional case
brought about by unusual conditions. It is
highly unlikely that a similar situation will
arise in the future where the incoming Student
Manager will be acquainted with the job
through personal experience, as is the case
with Mitguard.
It is much better to think about these things
at this time rather than wait for them to be
forcibly brought to the attention of the cam
pus.â€”G.C.
