# Choose Officers with Care
## 
### 
Appointments to positions on summer Ex
com were made last week by the present
Excom. Other summer quarter offices includ
ing Men's and Women's Council members,
Women's Conference representatives, and the
president and vice-president of the ASSU will
be chosen at Excom tonight.
These student offices are nearly as impor
tant during summer quarter as they are the
rest of the school year. But because the sum
mer positions are appointive, not elective,
there is a tendency to fill the offices with the
least trouble to those involved.
Up to the present time there has been no
set system used in filling these positions. It is
true that if a newly elected officer attends
school summer quarter, he automatically as
sumes office; or if the person who has held
the office is on campus during the summer,
he retains his job.
The other positions are filled arbitrarily from
an incomplete list of people willing to work

in student government during the summer.
A system publicizing the offices open and
offering interviews to students interested in
holding the jobs during summer would allow
more people a chance to try out and would
perhaps insure a stronger summer quarter
student government.
For example, a committee of Conference
members would interview women interested
in holding a Conference position during sum
mer. A committee from the existing Excom
would interview prospective ASSU presi
dents, vice-presidents and Excom members.
In this way Excom's final choice of summer
officers could be made from a comprehensive
list of suitable candidates. The appointment
of these people would not be left to one per
son's suggestion as is frequently done now.
Regardless of the small enrollment summer
quarter, these officers should be chosen with
the same care and thought they are given at
regular student elections.—M.S.
