### DAN ENDSLEY 
I have now joined the parade of stars. First it
was various members of the administration, past and
present, not the least of whom was Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur. Then it was that black Republican, Ted
Norton. Now even I have been called a Communist.
It all arose out of an interview with Henry Wal
lace which appeared on the first page of yesterday's
Daily under my name. Before I reached my 8 o'clock
the epithet had been hurled my way three different
times.
This, I think, is a sad commentary on public at
tention; my opposition to Mr. Wallace is well known,
and my position has not changed — but he is an
American citizen with a right to present his views.
What Mr. Wallace said was presented—l thought—
objectively, without interpolations from me. Few
reporters would do otherwise; the news columns are
for news—and editorializing should be kept to the
editorial columns. Therefore it is discouraging when
;i segment of the readers actually demands slanted
stories.
Could it be that the present witch hunt is getting
out of hand? It verges on the ridiculous when a man
like Ray Lyman Wilbur—considered an arch-reac
tionarv by many—is accused of being a Communist
sympathizer. If Dr. Wilbur is leading Uncle Joe's
campaign in America—oh. my!
That brings up another point. Many students at
l)oth Cal and Stanford would like to hear Mr. Wal
lace speak. (Permission has been refused in both
instances.) In Berkeley, he will speak on a street
corner across from the campus; at Stanford, it was
against University policy. Even though Mr. Wallace
is—in my opinion—wrong on some points, he is still

£i learned man from whom much can be learned.
When he indulges in inconsistencies and emotion
alism, that can be discounted; he is sound on other
matters.
He is a living paradox in that he is promoting a
modification of political isolationism while at the
same time he advocates whole-hog economic inter
nationalism—but refusing to allow him to speak here
at Stanford will enhance rather than diminish his
prestige, as he is well aware.
How the situation arose is hard to pin down. It
seems there is an ancient edict by the Board of
Trustees which prohibits the appearance here of
controversial figures, and that, was resurrected for
the occasion. The ultimate responsibility cannot be
determined because those involved keep passing the
buck back and forth. So far as I know, the Admin
istration had no part in the affair.
But no matter who is to blame, Stanford has been
hurt. A man has been refused free speech here—
and it is not likely soon to be forgotten. If the in
tention is to stamp out the things which Henry Wal
lace symbolizes, it's even more nonsensical; one need
only hark back to the anti-Christian campaign in
Rome, where two new converts were made for every
one who died in the lion pit.
Intolerance, it seems, is a most hardy weed which,
no matter how often pulled out by the roots, still
leaves seeds from which it grows up afresh. That,
perhaps, is one of the highest barriers to the sorely
needed "One World."
I think it was Voltaire who said that, though he
violently disagreed with what a certain man said, he
would uphold his right to say it to the death. There
are too few disciples of Voltaire in the world today.

only hark back to the anti-Christian campaign in
Rome, where two new converts were made for every
one who died in the lion pit.
Intolerance, it seems, is a most hardy weed which,
no matter how often pulled out by the roots, still
leaves seeds from which it grows up afresh. That,
perhaps, is one of the highest barriers to the sorely
needed "One World."
I think it was Voltaire who said that, though he
violently disagreed with what a certain man said, he
would uphold his right to say it to the death. There
are too few disciples of Voltaire in the world today.
I have now joined the parade of stars. First it
was various members of the administration, past and
present, not the least of whom was Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur. Then it was that black Republican, Ted
Norton. Now even I have been called a Communist.
It all arose out of an interview with Henry Wal
lace which appeared on the first page of yesterday's
Daily under my name. Before I reached my 8 o'clock
the epithet had been hurled my way three different
times.
This, I think, is a sad commentary on public at
tention; my opposition to Mr. Wallace is well known,
and my position has not changed — but he is an
American citizen with a right to present his views.
What Mr. Wallace said was presented—l thought—
objectively, without interpolations from me. Few
reporters would do otherwise; the news columns are
for news—and editorializing should be kept to the
editorial columns. Therefore it is discouraging when
;i segment of the readers actually demands slanted
stories.
Could it be that the present witch hunt is getting
out of hand? It verges on the ridiculous when a man
like Ray Lyman Wilbur—considered an arch-reac
tionarv by many—is accused of being a Communist
sympathizer. If Dr. Wilbur is leading Uncle Joe's
campaign in America—oh. my!
That brings up another point. Many students at
l)oth Cal and Stanford would like to hear Mr. Wal
lace speak. (Permission has been refused in both
instances.) In Berkeley, he will speak on a street
corner across from the campus; at Stanford, it was
against University policy. Even though Mr. Wallace
is—in my opinion—wrong on some points, he is still

£i learned man from whom much can be learned.
When he indulges in inconsistencies and emotion
alism, that can be discounted; he is sound on other
matters.
He is a living paradox in that he is promoting a
modification of political isolationism while at the
same time he advocates whole-hog economic inter
nationalism—but refusing to allow him to speak here
at Stanford will enhance rather than diminish his
prestige, as he is well aware.
How the situation arose is hard to pin down. It
seems there is an ancient edict by the Board of
Trustees which prohibits the appearance here of
controversial figures, and that, was resurrected for
the occasion. The ultimate responsibility cannot be
determined because those involved keep passing the
buck back and forth. So far as I know, the Admin
istration had no part in the affair.
But no matter who is to blame, Stanford has been
hurt. A man has been refused free speech here—
and it is not likely soon to be forgotten. If the in
tention is to stamp out the things which Henry Wal
lace symbolizes, it's even more nonsensical; one need
only hark back to the anti-Christian campaign in
Rome, where two new converts were made for every
one who died in the lion pit.
