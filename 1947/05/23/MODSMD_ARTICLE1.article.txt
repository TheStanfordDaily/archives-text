# Excom OK's Proposal For College Congress
## 
### 
Proposals tor a Western College Congress, similar to the
Pacific Northwest College Congress held at Reed College re
cently, to be sponsored by Stanford, were approved by Excom
last night. No date for the Congress has been set. The purpose
of this Congress is to focus student attention on the problems of

strengthening world organization for
peace. Student delegates from 40
major colleges and universities in
California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
and Hawaii will attend the three
day sessions of the Congress.
These delegates would condense
their best ideas on international
government and submit them to our
delegation to the United Nations.
Suggestions will be placed in bal
lot form and discussed and voted
upon by the student bodies of the
participating schools. Ratified res
olutions will be taken by two stu
dents to the American delegation to
the UN in New York which re
ceived resolutions from the Pacific
Northwest College Congress with
enthusiasm, and has expressed in
terest in receiving further state
ments of American student opinion.
SCHOOLS PICK DELEGATES
Each school will be asked to pick
from its student body the persons
it deems best qualified to be dele
gates to the Congress. It is not de
sired that the delegates be majors
in any prescribed field nor repre
sent any special group. The manner
of choosing delegates is left to each
school.
Stanford University administra
tion and students will sponsor the
first meeting of the Congress, but
subsequent sponsorship will be at
the discression of the Congress it
self. Outside sponsorship may be
sought for sending the two student
delegates to the UN in New York.
CONFERENCE TO PLAN
Planning of the agenda and details
of the Congress will be under the
leadership of the Conference Plan
ning Committee group which organ
ized the Conference on International
Relations held here two weeks ago.
An Executive Committee will be
the administrative agent of the spon
sor of the Congress and the Student
Planning Committee. It will over
see and follow through on all ar
rangements for the Congress.
