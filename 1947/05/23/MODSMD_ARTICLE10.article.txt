# Professors Aid Bill Alteration
## 
### 
Stanford education professor John
Almack was responsible in large
part for amending the "vicious pro
visions" of the Tenney Bill to pro
hibit the teaching of controversial
subjects in California schools, de
clared John Bartky, Dean of the
School of Education last night.
The bill was approved in severely
modified form by the State Senate
yesterday afternoon.
Bartky, together with Almack,
had testified before the Senate Edu
cation Committee against the Ten
ncy bills.
"The way these bills have passed
shows that the educators have won
a tremendous victory," Bartky said.
"The bills have been so amended that
everybody agreed they are quite
harmless."
Another of the ten original bills
Tenney submitted passed with
fundamental alterations. Originally
it would have banned "sex courses"
except for seniors in high school
and by doctors or registered nurses.
As modified, "specially qualified
teachers" can teach (lie subject.
