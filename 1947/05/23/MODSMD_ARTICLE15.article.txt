# Wallace Talks Before 10,000 at Berkeley; Sees Violence If DeGaulle Regains Power
## 
### 
Henry Wallace directed much of his Berkeley street speech right at
college students, approximately 100 of whom were from Stanford.
Alluding to the denial of permission for him to speak under Uni
versity auspices, Wallace remarked about the power of State Senator
Jack Tenney, who evidently "has much to say about appropriations."
"You don't step out of line when you're in danger of having the wa
ter cut olT," said Wallace in sympathizing with the official position of
the University.
Wallace said that the University of California is universally ac
claimed as "one of the live best schools in the country."
Speaking about the University of Texas, where he got his greatest
ovation of the tour when he spoke out against racial discrimination, Wal
lace said, "They're having a little trouble down there. It seems they
lost their president because he was a little too overcourageous.

If General Charles De Gaulle is
successful in regaining power in
France, world violence is a possible
outcome, Henry Wallace told an es
timated crowd of 10,000 persons in
an ;iddress from a Berkeley side
walk yesterday noon.
Blaming the Truman Doctrine
for allowing reactionaries like De
Gaulle to come out again. Wallace
maintained that the United States
move has caused the "central peo
ple" all over the world to divide
sharply right or left.
"General strikes by the workers—
who are predominantly Commu
ists — would follow De Gaulle s
seizure of power," Wallace declared.
"Legislation would follow and the
result would be violence in France.
"I am afraid that violence in
France would mean violence for
the world," he stated.
Wallace la.shed out against the
American Embassy in France for its
recent conduct. "I don't know if the
Jefferson CafTrry has any real sig
nificance." he said. "But the French
people think so. And it is what they
think that counts."
Wallace said that members of the

British government told him to do
ill he could to "head off De Gaulle
. . . but evidently the American Em
bassy feels differenlty."
Restating his position about world
politics. Wallace said. "I want Rus
sia to make a tremendous success
of Communism in Russia. I want
the social democracies to make tre
mendous successes of their experi
ments in Western Europe. And I
want the United States to make a
tremendous success of capitalistic
democracy here."

Russia and the U.S. both must
make their forms of qovcrnment
work because their mutual welfare
depends on it, Wallace stated. That
is the only way to prevent a depres
sion.
Wallace pointed out the need for
"overall, decisive government plan
ning to avoid a depression." He ex
pressed hope that the President's
Economic Council, led by Morse,
might provide the right answers,
but said that it could "only recom
mend" now.

"The world economic problem
might be bigger than the council,
though," he said.
Changing the subject to Harold
Stassen, Wallace stated thai "lie has
come as far toward my program as
he dares and still hope for the Re
publican presidential nomination."
Stassen at least recognizes the
magnitude of the problem, Wallace
praised. But his plan is unwork
able because he wants the United
States to administer it under the
United Nations to the "good little
boy" nations.
"The people of Europe won't sell
out that cheaply," he said. "Stas
sen's world is not one world, but
really still two worlds, the Ameri
can Empire and the Russian Em
pire," Wallace claimed.
Reverting back to his criticism of
the Truman Doctrine, Wallace
called the Vandenberg amendment
camouflage. "It is just an out."
Wallace described the American
Association for the United Nations
as a stooge for the State Depart
ment. "It is sabotage of the UN."
he said.
