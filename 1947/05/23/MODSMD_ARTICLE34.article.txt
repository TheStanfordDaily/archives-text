# Monteux and SF Symphony Performance Called Flawless
## 
### 
With 11is usual finesse and flawless technique, Pierre Monteux led the
Sun Francisco Symphony in a performance which was very well accepted
by the audience at the Concert Series program Wednesday evening.
The program varied from the classical strains of Beethoven's Eighth
Symphony to the very modern "Suite Francaise" by Milhaud. The latter

* was enjoyable, for it contained
many folk tunes from the provinces
of France which it represented. It
went l'rom somber to gay and was
, both emotional and patriotic.
The gay music of the "Alborada
del Gracioso" was made completely
Spanish in nature through the use
; of drums, castinets, and the percus
| sion section in general. It was ex
tremely well accepted and it was
possible to see it as a piece of mu
sic a man would sing to his loved
one.
There was great variation to .be
found in the overture from "Eu
ranthe." The different melodies
from the opera itself were combined
in a very expressive piece of work.
There was a great deal of variation
between soft and loud tones.
"Symphony No. 8" was performed
in a very masterful fashion. The
familiar tick which is supposed to
represent Maelzel's chronometer
was noticeable throughout. The last
section, Allegro Vivace, was per
haps the most enjoyable.
David Sheinfeld's "/ j'agio and
Allegro" was extremely modern and
well done, although it seemed to
build up to a climax without ever
really reaching it at some points.
The composer did a competent job
of conducting the piece, having
complete control of the orchestra.—
