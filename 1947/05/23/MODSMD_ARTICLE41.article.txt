# Ex-GI Gripes Die as Dibble Becomes True Farm Dorms
## 
### JOHN AVERILL 
Eight months ago over 900 men,
the majority of them veterans,
poured into the barracks of the
Army's one-time Dibble General
Hospital. Thus was inaugurated the
Farm's experiment in post-war em
ergency housing.
Nearly all of the 900 realized that
the acquisition of the hospital area
made possible their admittance to
the University, yet all were dis
appointed at having quarters so rem
iniscent of the recent military life.
EX-GI'S GRIPES
As the men reluctantly strolled
through the one-time wards with
the rows of double-decker bunks
and olive drab and navy metal lock
ers, groans such as, "What time is
Reveille?" and "When is bedcheck?"
became the wisecrack greetings of
self-introduction to prospective
roommates.
That was Stanford Village eight
months ago. The physical appear
ance hasn't changed, except possibly
a few more "No Parking" signs, but
the attitude has. The once familiar
moans have leveled off into the
normal gripes of the cx-GI and
mostly forgotten are the near-classic
jokes on the laconic "Ob's" of the
married couples as they first sighted
the double bunks in their one room
apartments last fall.
CO-OPERATION SHOWN
The rows of barracks still look
GI and there is still a military at
mosphere to building interiors, but
the men have shown that cooperative
effort can make living and studying
under such circumstances not only
possible but enjoyable.
As Art Weaver, a Village three
termer and twice president of House
310, put it, "Sure, it's not all that
one could ask, but it just boils down
that the fellas can be as happy as
they have a desire to be.
"With the attitude of making the
best of it, the fellas here in the House
have proved to themselves that Vil
lage living can be as pleasant as
elsewhere."
MOSTIY SINGLE MEN
As with last Autumn, the single
men comprise the majority of the
Village inhabitants, occupying 16
separate buildings. During Winter
Quarter, students that had been
housed in tarpaper barracks were
moved into the two-story former
officers' quarters when married cou
ples were consolidated into one
building.
Added to the convenience and
comfort of the residents were the
gilts by the Stanford Mothers of
lounge furniture for study halls in
each building, the opening of the
Officers' Club as the Village Club,
a bowling alley, the appearance of a
Roos Bros, shop, a soda fountain and
snack bar, and a Village store sell
ing everything from frying pans and
reading lamps to paper clips and
tooth paste.
The result of one academic year
for the "Village Experiment" was
expressed by Chief Counselor Her
bert J. Wunderlich:
"Every expectation I ever had
for the students taking hold of their
own activities and problems has
been lived up to. There have been
no disciplinary problems; in fact,
this is the most mature cooperation
in attempts to make the Village a
success that I've seen in all my years
of work in the men's counseling
field."
