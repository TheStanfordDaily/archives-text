# Apartment Life Improves
## 
### DICK BIESER 
Life is very pleasant for' apart
ment dwellers in Stanford Village
these days. By June 1 all of the
300 apartments will be completed.
And with their completion, little
odds and ends of plastering will also
be finished up all over.
Gardens are beginning to do well
in village soil, and there is an ab
sence of problems in general.
Of course a lot of credit must go
to the efficiency of the Village Fam
ily Council, and the many kindnesses
of the Stanford Mothers Club.
, Much has been done to improve
the lot of the average village family
since the first ones moved in last
November. Red Cross classes for in
fant and pre-natal care are now
being conducted in the village, with
an average attendance of 30.
Three Wednesdays a month, a
practicing pediatrician and a nurse
conduct a well baby clinic. The ba
bies are examined, diet problems are
discussed, shots and boosters are
given, and posture correction is em
phasized. This service is provided
by the San Mateo County Health
Service.
Most of the apartment dwellers
don't have any trouble waking up
for 8 o'clocks, because of all the
children in the area. The kids are
awake and about long before the
first cars leave for the campus.
There are about 18 apartments
with couples without children. These
residents are finding life a little rug
ged getting used to having children
about. The walls are thin, and little
voices can be heard rather easily.
''The Village is a fairly safe place
for children now that the yards are
fenced in," said Mrs. Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson, Chairman of the Vil
lage Family Council.
"The Federal Government spent
over a half million dollars for con
struction in the apartment area. At
the end of the project, the net in
come will go to the government," Di
rector Dwight B. Adams said.
Stanford has paid for certain de
velopmental costs and direct pur
chases in the dormitory area that
it will never recover, he added.
"It is not intended that the build
ings in Stanford Village should ever
become slum areas. When the need
for which they were created has
ceased to exist, they will be torn
down," Dirctor Adams stated.
