### LORRY LOKEY 
Stanford Village may have its big
gest population next fall when
"about 1200 single men, 100 women,
and 300 married men" stake off
their bunk space and hitch their
barracks bags to the loot, oj their
beds, C. E. Cunningham, assistant
Village counselor, said Wednesday.
DIAPERS TO BEARDS
Youngest residents of the former
Dibble Hospital are in the freshman
class where ages run from 16 years
to 33, or a mean age of 20.8. Seniors,
on the other hand, are in the 19 to
34 age bracket with a mean age of
22.7 years.
Old men of the Village fall in the
Graduate class where the Rough's
mean age is 25.5 years but extremes
are 19 to 49 years. If a Village man
is of average age he has seen 23
summers.
This quarter Village dorms and
apartments house 945 single men, 300
married men and their families, and
96 single women. Upper division rep
resentation outweighs lower division
by approximately 100 students.
FOREIGN STUDENTS
"About 50 foreign students from
such countries as India, Turkey,
Egypt, Iran, and the Philippines live
at the Village," Cunningham said.
Nearly 550 men and women will
be at the Village this summer. Since
the population is so small, however,
the mess hall will close until autumn
quarter. "Temporary restaurant fac
ilities will probably be transferred
to the Village soda fountain," Cun
ningham added.
Modern Encina-stylc water war
fare may spring up at the Village
next autumn when about 200 men
graduate from Encina and move into
Village dorms.
