# Standford Village Ends Successful Year
## Sports Program Is Important 
### AL BRIDGES 
One of the phenomena that con- |
tribute to America's strength and
greatness is the intense interest and
participation by its people in com
petitive sports. So it is not strange
that a large living group such as
the Stanford Village should interest
itself in this phase of college life and
Americana.
In one year of existence, the Vil- j
lage has had its share of organized !
and spontaneous sports events, and j
boasts of many sports stars such as I
Bob Lewis and Mel Kendall in res
idence. Softball, basketball, foot
ball, volleyball, tennis, and bowl- !
ing, to name but a few, have found i
a place in Village life.
COUNCIL DIRECTS ATHLETICS
The organization of these sports |
has been the duty of the Village ;
Athletic Council, composed of a |
sport chairman elected by each ;
house. This organization, established j
by Village Director Dwight Adams
and aided in its purpose by Assist
ant Director Lewis Myers, Resident
Counselor Herbert Wunderlich, and
Assistant Counselor Clairdon Cun
ningham, has been very active.
Sparkplug of softball, basketball,
and tennis was Jim Mooney of
Building 312, while Jack Baty effec
tively organized bowling.
INTRAMURAL OFFICE HELPS
Close co-operation between the
campus Intramural OfHce and the
Village Athletic Council has made
the year's sport activities a success.
Counselor Cunningham stated that
aid from the Intramural Office has
been unstinted, and that the loan of
athletic equipment in particular was
very helpful. Many houses, how
ever, purchase equipment from their
own funds. He said further that, al
though permission from the War
Assets Administration must be se
cured, as was the case in opening
the basketball courts, there still re
mains a fine unused swimming pool
in the Village. It is hoped that this
too will be made available for the
residents.
