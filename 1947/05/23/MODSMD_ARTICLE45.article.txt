# Stanford Village Declared Success
## 
### OR APPERSON 
Last summer, Stanford started an
experiment in veterans' housing. It
has been successful.
It was an experiment in self-gov
ernment, and one which would un
avoidably force barracks - weary
veterans back into barracks. Thank*
to a hands-off policy by tho Village
administration, the students were
allowed to work out their own prob
lems in their own way.
"The measure of success is in the
grades the students make, and in
their happiness here," said Herbert

Wundrrlich, who is chief counselor
for the Village.
The grade record shows that it
has been a success, and apparently
the students have been satisfied with
their lot there.
Undoubtedly the Village is the
best veterans' housing unit formu
lated by any university in th~
try, and will continue to be an
ample to other schools.
