About this time of year there comes an eager glint in the eyes
cf the long-hitting Stanford Golf Team; for within a month two
major golf events, the Pacific Coast Conference Championships
and the National Intercollegiate Championships, will engage their
ialents. Stanford golfers have always shown a marked interest

in those two events. In fact, they
h ve developed a winning complex
v. hich is shown in the record books
!y 10 wins in the II PC'C Cham
pionships so far, and 5 wins of the
l.-.st (i National Intercollogiates,
cards non: in repeat
With an excellent record this year
of 3 victories, 1 tie and 1 loss, the
Farm team points for the Nationals
and a good chance of bringing home
another title. Coach Eddie Twiggs
< :pccts a running battle, however,
with the Princeton Ivy League golf
winners and the strong Purdue,
Duke, and Louisiana State teams
1 roviding the toughest opposition

their sights on the Golden Bears of
Berkeley tomorrow, when the big
match of the year in this area gets
v.nder way on the local course.
Although the standings of both
teams are equal in conference play,
the manner in which the Cards
swamped UCLA and the Trojans
