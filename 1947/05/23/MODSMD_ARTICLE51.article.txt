# Mermen Invade Cal Pool In Return Meet
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
With a clean sweep over Southern Division PCC competition
under their belts, Stanford's varsity swimmers will journey to
Berkeley tomorrow afternoon for their final tune-up match before
the PCC championships in the UCLA pool a week hence. To
morrow's meet starts at 1:15 p.m. By virtue of their previous re-

sounding 51-24 win over Cal, the
Farm swimmers will go into this re
turn meet as the definite favorites.
The Bear mermen have improved
quite a bit. since the last lime they
faced Stanford, but then, so have
the Indians. The question remains
—which team has improved the
most? The answer will be interest
ing because, with the exception of
an occasional bit of strategic kibitz
ing from USC, it will be the Bears
that give the Farm swimmers most
of their opposition in the PCC finals.
OLD RIVALS MEET
The meet will bring to light sev
eral individual cross-bay rivalries
as well as the inter-team struggle, i
NCAA record-holder Bob Ander- I
son will again find a keen sprint

Beanston a good battle tomorrow.
A Stanford 440 entry who may
well swim for more than just the
exercise is Ralph Sala. Freshman
Ralph has been coming along ex
ceptionally well these last few weeks.
With Taioli on the sidelines, Sala
turned in a 4:5G.8 effort to take first
in the 440 against USC. Last Fri
day he finished with a terrific sprint,
a tenth of a second behind Taioli's
fast time of 4:53.8.
FURLONG DUEL PROMISED
Beanston will again tangle with
Stanford's Em Cashin in the 220-yard
freestyle event. During the last big
meet, the expected first-place fur
long freestyle duel between Bean
ston and Taioli failed to materialize
when Em Cashin, who was alleged
ly a breaststroke specialist, came
through to win the race. Last Fri
day, Cashin proved to everyone's
satisfaction that he could swim
backstroke too, as he chopped six
and one-half seconds off the old
NCAA record for the 300-yard indi
vidual medley event.
Another point of interest will be
the diving event in which Stan
ford's Louis Fentnor will again face
Cal men Jack Lavery and Bill Kel
| ler. Fentnor, who is one of the most
improved performers on the Indian
squad, will have his work cut out
for him if he is to repeat his second
place Big Meet diving victory in the
hostile atmosphere of the Berkeley
pool.
WEI,DEN ROYS FEUD
In the 200-yard breaststroke,' Don
Hester and Klaas 80l will again mix
with Cal's Bel Arth. The Weeden
i Brothers are figured to be pretty
much out by themselves in the 150-
i yard backstroke as they continue
i their family backstroke feud, al
i though Cal's Moe Mathews could
I surprise.
In the 300-yard medley, Stanford
will enter A 1 Weeden, Don Hester,
and Dick Narver against a Cal trio
of Webster, Mathews, and Yec.
Coach Tom Haynie has selected Nar
ver, Cashin, Warren Cutting, and
Anderson to share the 400-yard re
lay duties, while Cal will probably
start Beanston, Yee, Fisher, and
Morketter.

over Anderson in a blanket finish in

at Seattle, was a close second to Bob

100-yard freestyle record, and has
turned in some good times in the

Fred Taioli will be out to even up

over Anderson in a blanket finish in

at Seattle, was a close second to Bob
in both the 5(J- and 100-yard races

Fred Taioli will be out to even up

With a clean sweep over Southern Division PCC competition
under their belts, Stanford's varsity swimmers will journey to
Berkeley tomorrow afternoon for their final tune-up match before
the PCC championships in the UCLA pool a week hence. To
morrow's meet starts at 1:15 p.m. By virtue of their previous re-

sounding 51-24 win over Cal, the
Farm swimmers will go into this re
turn meet as the definite favorites.
The Bear mermen have improved
quite a bit. since the last lime they
faced Stanford, but then, so have
the Indians. The question remains
—which team has improved the
most? The answer will be interest
ing because, with the exception of
an occasional bit of strategic kibitz
ing from USC, it will be the Bears
that give the Farm swimmers most
of their opposition in the PCC finals.
OLD RIVALS MEET
The meet will bring to light sev
eral individual cross-bay rivalries
as well as the inter-team struggle, i
NCAA record-holder Bob Ander- I
son will again find a keen sprint

Beanston a good battle tomorrow.
A Stanford 440 entry who may
well swim for more than just the
exercise is Ralph Sala. Freshman
Ralph has been coming along ex
ceptionally well these last few weeks.
With Taioli on the sidelines, Sala
turned in a 4:5G.8 effort to take first
in the 440 against USC. Last Fri
day he finished with a terrific sprint,
a tenth of a second behind Taioli's
fast time of 4:53.8.
FURLONG DUEL PROMISED
Beanston will again tangle with
Stanford's Em Cashin in the 220-yard
freestyle event. During the last big
meet, the expected first-place fur
long freestyle duel between Bean
ston and Taioli failed to materialize
when Em Cashin, who was alleged
ly a breaststroke specialist, came
through to win the race. Last Fri
day, Cashin proved to everyone's
satisfaction that he could swim
backstroke too, as he chopped six
and one-half seconds off the old
NCAA record for the 300-yard indi
vidual medley event.
Another point of interest will be
the diving event in which Stan
ford's Louis Fentnor will again face
Cal men Jack Lavery and Bill Kel
| ler. Fentnor, who is one of the most
improved performers on the Indian
squad, will have his work cut out
for him if he is to repeat his second

In the 200-yard breaststroke,' Don

In the 300-yard medley, Stanford

under their belts, Stanford's varsity swimmers will journey to
Berkeley tomorrow afternoon for their final tune-up match before

Farm swimmers will go into this re
turn meet as the definite favorites.
The Bear mermen have improved
quite a bit. since the last lime they
faced Stanford, but then, so have
the Indians. The question remains
—which team has improved the
most? The answer will be interest

an occasional bit of strategic kibitz

that give the Farm swimmers most
of their opposition in the PCC finals.
