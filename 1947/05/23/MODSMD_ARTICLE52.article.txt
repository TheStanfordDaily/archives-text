# Zetes, Firemen Win Ball Games
## 
### 
Yesterday saw ihe wind-up of a
successful intramural Softball sea
son.
In the first game, Zete barely
nudged ATO in a 7 inning battle
which saw the lead see-saw by a
one run margin throughout the game.
Zete held on to that one run lead
for a 7-0 victory.
Undefeated Firehouse completed
their reign of terror in league play
by setting back Sigma Nu, 9-2.
Sigma Nu, with 3 losses this season,
is one of the few teams to score
against the effective Firehouse gang.
