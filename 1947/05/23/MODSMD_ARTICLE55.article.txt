# Indian Squad to Meet USF; Beat Skymasters, 13 to 8
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's Farm diamond men make their last
appearance of the season on the Sunken Diamond tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 when they take on a rugged University of San
Francisco ball club in a non-conference game.
Yesterday, the Indians snapped their three-game losing streak

on the familiar turf of their home
field when they pounded out a 13
to 8 decision over the MofTett Field
Skymasters.
Ben Cardinal Ii poled out a sin
gle, a double, and a triple. Lloyd
Merriman tripled twice and walked
as many times in the five-run vic
tory. Dick Flatland and Frank La-
Brum carried the pitching burden,
giving up nine hits.
The Indians totaled 13 hits in all.
In the sixth, the game was all tied
up at 6-6, but the Indians scored in
their hall' of that inning and were
never headed after that.
Tomorrow, the Indians will be out
looking for revenge for the 13 to 4 i

shellacking they received at the
hands of the Dons last Saturday in
San Francisco.
The Dons come into the game with
a 10-11 record for the season (not
including yesterday's game with
California), during which they have
come up with some rugged per
formances.
They've beaten St. Mary's twice
and lost once, and they were nosed
out by Cal a month ago by an 8 to 7
margin. In addition they knocked
out a 9 to 7 win over U.C.L.A. in
March, but dropped two games with
Santa Clara.
