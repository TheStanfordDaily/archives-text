# Farm Net Men Play UCLA, SC
## 
### 
Stanford's luckless tennis team has
taken to the road this weekend in
an all-out invasion of the South
land in search of a PCC victory.
Today the Indians meet UCLA, with
the USC Trojans entertaining as
host tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the local tennis scene
will be tilled by the junior varsity
which takes on Menlo Junior Col
lege on the local courts today. Ac
tion starts at 2:!i0 p.m.
1 he Cardinal varsity goes into the
Los Angeles battles as underdog be
cause of early season losses to the
Southland duo. Today's battle with
the Bruins should be the closer
match, as the Indians worried the
Bruins before losing last week, 6-3.
In today's Farm tennis attraction,
the junior varsity will send Tom
Huffman against Menlo in the num
ber one slot. The Indian babes go
into the game with a sparkling rec
ord of only one loss, that to the
California Cubs.
Coach Elwyn Bugge throws his
best varsity racquetmen against the
Bruins, chosen from a traveling
squad of Bob Lewis, Ted Myers,
Bob Rutledge, Drew Putty, Kirke
Mechem, Ross Hughes, and Dave
Basham.
