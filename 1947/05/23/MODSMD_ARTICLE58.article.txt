### TOM SELF 
Wliy didn't the Spring Show measure up to ex
pectations?
Gary Lewis tri?d to answer this question on KSU
Sunday night. Some of his comments were apt;
others we must take exception to.
Lewis placed the major share of the blame on
performance rather than writing. In that respect he
is partially right. Especially when he submits the
excuse of insufficient rehearsal time. The show re
flected that all the way through.
That misfortune is not the fault of the cast. The
Spring Show suffered the same ailment that afflicts
a number of other extra-curricular activities. Be
cause of tough study schedules and lack of credit
for activities, students cannot afford to give that
extra bit of time and effort that will put an under
taking over. The result is inevitable mediocrity.
But to get down to specific cases, we believe the
writing could have been stronger. The theme was
good. With more talent on the writing end, it could
have been the nucleus of a great program. Nearly
every comment we heard was that the plot was a
fine framework but terribly bare.
Shapiro was criticized for being funny when he
should have been pathetic. If the role was indeed
supposed to be a serio-comic one, the writing was
not clear enough for it to be evident. Let me say
that Shapiro is very good when he is doing his own
stuff.
Even the Daily has been hit for lack of perception
in reviews. This seems rather a careless criticism
inasmuch as the reviewing and all Daily publicity
was done by Stu Fitch, the production's own man,
who received credit as such on the program. On the
other hand, a person prominent in the Speech and
Drama Department stated that not half enough
money was spent on publicity considering the size
of the show.
When all the evidence is in, though, it seems that

what the show really needed was a play doctor,
someone to rework it as necessary. Everyone in the
cast before the show thought it was grand. The au
dience did not.
Probably the cast was too close to the show to
know. Or, as one observer expressed it, "The fault
is that these days people are so easily satisfied. Al
most any effort seems sufficient."
The show lacked the advice of technical experts in
the Speech and Drama Department. It was a stu-

dent production, to be produced
by talent outside the department.
Speech and Drama "regulars" took
pains to stay away. This is all very
well in the respect that the Speech
and Drama Department has a full
schedule and plenty to do. But
we candidly suggest that any out
side production on a scale such as
the Spring Show should have at
least a sort of elder statesman from
the department to advise. A play
doctor certainly could have sug
gested changes in "It's a Deal!"
that would have bolstered it con
siderably.

Since we have wandered onto the subject, Bull
Session would like to take this opportunity to make
a plea for more credit for non-classroom work. Work
on stage production, KSU, the Daily, etc., without a
doubt can do as much for students from a practical
standpoint as so many units of book work.
Academic credit seems justified for this reason,
as well as the fact that it would attract the talent
and time of students necessary to put activities over.
As the case is now, many students are forced either
to drop out of activities or to do work that is not
their best because of pressing classroom work.
