### DAN ENDSLEY 
Wednesday in Greenville, South Carolina, a jury
acquitted 28 men who had been tried on 98 counts of
murder, conspiracy, and of being accessories before
and after the fact. The incident complained of was
the lynching of Willie Earle, a Negro, last February.
It was an all-white jury. The Governor of South Car
olina had used all the authority of his office to bring
the 28 men to trial; the judge directed the jury
flatly to disregard racial issues. And the defense at
torney, after the verdict, made this statement, "I
think this a perfect example of proving that the De
partment of Justice, Walter Winchell. and other peo
ple up North should keep their mouth out of the
South's business."
It is not for me to say that all the men were un
equivocally guilty on all counts. There is still a
presumption in this country that any man is innocent
until the jury finds him guilty. Personally, I have
no doubt that at least some of the defendants were
guilty on some of the charges, but all I know is what
I read in the papers, and that is not evidence. Of this,
however, I am sure; even had a hundred witnesses of
unimpeachable veracity sworn that they had seen
each and every one of the defendants commit each and
every offense with which he was charged, that jury
would still have acquitted.
It was too much to expect that a South Carolina
jury would have found anyone guilty of a hanging
offense, but to find all of these men, some of whom
who had confessed to participation in the lynching,
not guilty on all charges is a blow at law and order, a
callous and calculated disregard of human rights and
human dignity, and a black eye to the South.

One of the most effective points made by the op
ponents of the ISC was that far more good would be
done, everything considered, were foreign students
to be brought to this country for a year's study than
if two Stanford observers went abroad for a few
weeks this summer. It is to the credit of A1 Munk
and the Information Institute, to Martin Anderson,
and to the University Administration that they have
taken steps to inaugurate a program of exchange
scholarships.
To be sure, I do not agree entirely with the de
tails of the plan as I understand them. The most im
portant thing is to bring students from abroad; to
send American students over there is, to my mind,
secondary. It is not over-difficult for us, well-fed,
well-housed, well-clothed, to make an effort to un
derstand the problems of other peoples. But for those
whose whole life is but little removed from chaos,
who have neither the necessities of life, nor, although
they are students, even books, pens, and paper, it is
difficult to arrive at any sound appreciation of the
character of America or of Americans. If we bring
them over here, feed them, go to class with them,
have them in our living groups, let them see that our
American system, if it can be called that, has good
points as well as bad ones, let. them find out that
Americans, after all, are human beings too, then we
will have made a substantial contribution to the bet
ter adjustment of the world.
Be that as it may, the present program is most
creditable. And it is the more creditable in that it
shows that our international groups on campus are
willing to take up worthy ideas contributed by the
students in general.
