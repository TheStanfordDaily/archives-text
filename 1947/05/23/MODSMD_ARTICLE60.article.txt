(Dean John M. Stalnakcr, chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, could not be reached
last night for comment on the University policy to
wards public speakers.—The Editor.)
To the Editor:
This is an open letter addressed to the Board of
Trustees of Stanford. Many students want an un
equivocal and definitive answer to the question: What
is the University's policy in regard to granting public
speakers the use of the Stanford Rostrum?
Daily readers have been led to believe that the
reason for refusing Henry Wallace permission to
speak at Stanford is that he is a "controversial
figure."—Let's get this business into the open. Just
what is the reason for keeping Wallace off the cam
pus?
Why can't a community supposedly made up of

'All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber of writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable letters be short and to the point.)

seekers after truth be allowed to partake of a con
troversy at least by hearing the arguments of the
partisans? Deny us this privilege and you deny the
reason for the existence of Stanford.
The fact that a speaker is a "controversial figure"
is one of the best arguments 1 know of for listening to
him. Intelligent solutions to problems follow closely
the objective weighing of ALL the facts. What man
ner of citizens will Stanford send forth if its stu
dents are gainsaid the opportunity to learn the
facts of twentieth century political lite?
Let us not follow the lead of Tenney and other
small minds among us. Enlightened student opinion
demands an answer to my question. The motto of
Stanford is: "The Winds of Freedom Blow." We are
in danger of a fiat calm.
Jack Rich
P.S. I do not agree with Mr. Wallace's viewpoint.
