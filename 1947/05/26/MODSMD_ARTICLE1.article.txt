*" The University of Naples was ap
proved two weeks ago by the Exec
utive Council of the Institute of In
ternational Relations to be the for
eign university which Stanford will
adopt for its relief program.
The university was chosen in or
der to concentrate Stanford group
aid abroad, Bill Dirker, co-chair
man of the Stanford International
Relief Organization, said. Relief not
designated for specified individuals
will be sent to this university.
The University of Naples was
founded in 1224 and was one of the
first schools of higher learning to
be established in Europe. The uni
versity is conducted, like most Eu
ropean universities, along a classi
cal and intellectual rather than a
practical line.
SIMILAR TO STANFORD
In geographical area, the Univer
sity of Naples is similar to Stanford.
Naples is situated on a bay and has
a range of hills for a background.
The climate at Naples is compar
able to that at Palo Alto.
Prior to the war the university
had one of the finest libraries of
ancient and rare books in the world.
Before the American occupation of
Italy, the Nazis occupied it in cffect.
One day during the Nazi occupation
a German soldier was shot and
killed on the same street as the li
brary.
The Nazis, thinking the shot
might have come from the library,
very deliberately and over a period
of days destroyed it by taking the
books, shelf by shelf, pouring gaso
line over them, and then burning
them.
IN DESPERATE CONDITION
At present the university is in a
desperate condition for clothing,
food, and equipment. The students,
through co-operative action, are at
tempting to solve some of their
problems themselves.
If transportation can be obtained
to Naples, one of the students being
sent abroad this summer by ISC
will visit the university and obtain
additional information concerning
their present needs.
Any contributions to the univer
sity can be handed in today, Wed
nesday, and Friday at the SIRO of
fice on the third floor of the Wom
en's Clubhouse from 12:30 to 1:30
p.m., Bill Dirker added.

*" The University of Naples was ap
proved two weeks ago by the Exec
utive Council of the Institute of In
ternational Relations to be the for
eign university which Stanford will
adopt for its relief program.
The university was chosen in or
der to concentrate Stanford group
aid abroad, Bill Dirker, co-chair
man of the Stanford International
Relief Organization, said. Relief not
designated for specified individuals
will be sent to this university.
The University of Naples was
founded in 1224 and was one of the
first schools of higher learning to
be established in Europe. The uni
versity is conducted, like most Eu
ropean universities, along a classi
cal and intellectual rather than a
practical line.
SIMILAR TO STANFORD
In geographical area, the Univer
sity of Naples is similar to Stanford.
Naples is situated on a bay and has
a range of hills for a background.
The climate at Naples is compar
able to that at Palo Alto.
Prior to the war the university
had one of the finest libraries of
ancient and rare books in the world.
Before the American occupation of
Italy, the Nazis occupied it in cffect.
One day during the Nazi occupation
a German soldier was shot and
killed on the same street as the li
brary.
The Nazis, thinking the shot
might have come from the library,
very deliberately and over a period
of days destroyed it by taking the
books, shelf by shelf, pouring gaso
line over them, and then burning
them.
IN DESPERATE CONDITION
At present the university is in a
desperate condition for clothing,
food, and equipment. The students,
through co-operative action, are at
tempting to solve some of their
problems themselves.
If transportation can be obtained
to Naples, one of the students being
sent abroad this summer by ISC
will visit the university and obtain
additional information concerning
their present needs.
Any contributions to the univer
sity can be handed in today, Wed
nesday, and Friday at the SIRO of
fice on the third floor of the Wom
en's Clubhouse from 12:30 to 1:30
p.m., Bill Dirker added.

positions of president, vice - presi
