A Gymkhana will be held at the

The show will be held in connec

judge. Transportation will be avail
able at the Women's Gym from 3 to

Among the events scheduled are a

This two hour show is the first of
its kind to be held at Stanford since
before the war. Mr. and Mrs. Ross,
owners of the Riding School horses,
announced they have many more
events planned for next Fall.
