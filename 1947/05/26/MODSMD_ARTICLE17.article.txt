VANCOUVER, Wash., May 25
(UP). — Former Vice - President
Henry A. Wallace tonight told ap
proximately 1,000 shirt-sleeved list
eners who crowded into the high
school auditorium here the"Tru
man Doctrine" is a doctrine of fear.
Wallace said, "I believe that two
thirds of the American people are
against the Truman Doctrine. It is
a doctrine of fear."
"Once you adopt the doctrine, you
can never end it," Wallace said. The
crowd was undemonstrative.
He said, "There is a large and
powerful movement in the United
States which prefers to tell some of
us to stay in our places. I hate to
say it, but it is true.
"Someday we will find the com
mon man all over the world fight
ing with Russia against us," he de
clared.
Wallace revealed he had spent
several hours today with Brig. Gen.
Evans F. Carlson, retired, famed
leader of the Marine Raiders. Carl
son, who is a national leader of the
Progressive Citizens of America, is
now at Blackwood, Wash., seriously
ill with heart trouble.
Wallace said that he and the gen
eral discussed war and peace, and
concluded that the day is coming
when "we'll have to put our su
preme energies into peace—or pos
sibly into another war.
"Carlson's men," he said, "be
lieved in what they fought for. The
reason was that Carlson tried to
show them what they were fighting
for. He performed too well, and so
he was relieved from active duty."
