# Phillips New KSU Manager
## 
### 
Steve Phillips was chosen station
manager of KSU for next year at
an executive staff meeting Friday
afternoon, according to Bill Eilers,
present station manager, who will
graduate at the end of the summer
quarter.
Other executive position place
ments include Paula Jones as pro
gram director; Rod Browning as
business manager; Ray Sanders as
chief engineer; and Art Levinson
as station relations manager. The
advertising director's post will not
be filled until autumn quarter, Ei
lers said at the meeting.
Among the future KSU plans and
policies discussed at the meeting
were tentative plans for limited
broadcasting during summer quar
ter. Programs will be aired nightly
but on a more limited schedule than
is now operated.
FREQUENCY CHANGE
KSU's frequency will be changed
in autumn quarter to 880 kilocycles.
The present 590 kilocycles makes
listening in some Row houses diffi
cult, and the change should greatly
improve KSU reception, said Eilers.
A recommendation to the facility
committee, which will decide the
future of KSU, was made in regard
to executive salaries. Since revenue
from advertising sources has in
creased, KSU officials are asking for
saalries of $75 per quarter for sta
tion manager, advertising director,
business manager, program director,
chief engineer, and station relations
manager.
This policy was advocated so that
KSU might function as a campus
organization similar to the Daily,
Quad, and Chaparral.
PROPOSE NEW STUDIOS
Another recommendation to the
faculty committee concerned the
new KSU studios. KSU executives
advised the construction of new
studios in the now vacant space in
the basement of Memorial Hall. A
loan from the Administration will
first have to be secured in order to
construct the desired offices.
Program plans for next fall call
for greatly expanded operations,
Eilers added. "The broadcasting and
recording of the Spring Sing is the
type of operations we plan," he said.
