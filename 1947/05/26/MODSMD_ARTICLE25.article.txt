# Farm Horsemen Hold Picnic Ride
## 
### 
A picnic ride was held yesterday
by the Stanford Riding School with
the advanced English and Western
riders of the equitation classes. The
group left The Old Red Barn at 10:1)0
a.m. and rode back in the foot hills
to Felt Lake.
Mrs. Patricia Ross, riding school
co-owner, furnished the picnic
lunch for the group. They ate in the
woods and returned to the barn at
4:30 in the afternoon. Allen Ross
said the group rode about 15 miles.
This was the first of a series of
similar rides to be held by the Rosses
from the Red Barn. Later rides will
be open to all students and faculty
who wish to attend. Breakfast, pic
nic, and moonlight rides are being
planned.
