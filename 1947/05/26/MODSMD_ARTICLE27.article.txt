ANDREWS FIELD, Md., May .5
j (UP). —Gen. George C. Kenney,
j commander of the strategic air
I forces, is planning two more mock
B-29 raids on major industrial tar
gets, he revealed today.
The targets have not y£t been
selected but the raids will be of a
surprise type, with crews of the su
perfortresses getting only a few
hours' notice of take-off time, Ken
ney said in an interview.
The first such raid, made along the
I eastern seaboard 10 days ago by 100
superforts and with advance notice
to the crews, as well as the millions
of residents in the target areas, was
I hampered by bad weather.
Procedure in the new raids, ac-
I cording to Kenney, will demonstrate
to the nation how quickly its long
range air force can take to the air
in an emergency.

RUSSIAN MINERAL DRIVE
WASHINGTON. May 25 (UP).—
Russia has opened the biggest drive
in history for vital minerals, with
60,000 scientists, engineers and work
ers probing 385,000 square miles of
territory, Sen. Owen Brewster, R.,
Me., said today in challenging the
United States to surpass the pro
gram.
In all, he added, the Soviet Union
has 800 geological expeditions in the
field searching for coal, iron, oil and
other essential minerals.
He quoted "undisclosed, but au
thoritative sources" as advising him
the program is so far-reaching in
scope as to defy competition and
rivalry by any other nation.
The chairman of the senate war
investigating committee made his
statement in a letter to Chairman
George W. Malone, R., Nev., of the
Senate Public Lands subcommittee
oil Natural Resources.

CLARK ACCUSES RUSSIANS
NEW YORK. May 25 (UP).—Gen.
Mark W. Clark tonight accused the
Russians in Austria of confiscating
Austrian industries, farm products,
livestock and other Austrian re
sources i..eluding Danube river ship
ping illegally and in violation of the
Potsdam agreement.
"The Soviets in Austria have not
cooperated with the other occupy
ing powers in accordance with the
solemn pledges all of us macje to the
world for its future peace and pros
perity," Clark said in a radio speech
over the Columbia Broadcasting
Company network.
Announcing at the outset that he
wanted to speak "frankly and hon
estly" of relations with Russia,
Clark emphasized:
"I am convinced that to be firm
and definite in our relations with
the Soviet Union docs not increase
the chances of war, but on the con
trary reduces them."

HUNGRY CHINESE PEASANTS
SHANGHAI. May 25 (UP).—Near- j
ly 1,000,000 hungry peasants have
treivked into Shanghai in the past
few months seeking food and the
situation now is so desperate gov
ernment authorities arc fearful of
demonstrations which may flare into
open rebellion, informed sources said
today.
The influx of peasants have swelled
the city's population to nearly 5,-
000,000 and there is scarcely enough
rice on hand to feed Shanghai's nor
mal population of less than 4,000,000
persons, these sources said.
Shanghai's recent wave of labor
unrest and student strikes have
been blamed by Mayor K. C. Wu for
the lack of rice. Wu said Chinese j
Communists in North Kiagsu have j
cut off much of the city's rice sup- I
ply by seizing or destroying crops. I

CREDIT CONTROLS
WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP).—
All consumer credit controls will be
abolished completely soon, the only
question being whether the admin
istration or congress will do it, it
was indicated today.
The house banking committee,
which is studying the entire credit
picture, is considering three meas
ures calling for immediate removal
of restrictions on installment buying.
Congressional sources said, however,
that chairman Marriner S. Eccles of
the Federal Reserve Board, intends
to lift them, anyway.
Sweeping wartime restrictions on
consumer credit, imposed before
Pearl Harbor as an anti-inflation
measure and tightened up during the
war and again in August, 1946, were
relaxed last Dec. 1, following the
Republican election victory in No
vember.

MOT!(till TRUMAN'S BATTLE
GRANDVIEW. Mo., May 25 (UP).
President Truman, apparently re
signed to his mother's slowly losing
battle against a grave illness, re
ported tonight she continued to
«row weaker and was sleeping most
of the time.
The President ended his Sabbath
| vigil at her bedside about 6:30 p.m.
(CST). When he returned to his
headquarters at the Muehlebacb
Hotel in Kansas City, the President
was obviously sad and downcast.
"She's just about the same," he
I said. They were words he has re
-1 peated many times in recent days.
"No perceptible change except that
she's just a little weaker again."
Mr. Truman said she slept, most
of the day, but awoke at sufficient
intervals to permit him to talk with
her. "I talked to her on several oc-
I casions," he said.

j commander of the strategic air
I forces, is planning two more mock
B-29 raids on major industrial tar

The targets have not y£t been

The first such raid, made along the

RUSSIAN MINERAL DRIVE
WASHINGTON. May 25 (UP).—
Russia has opened the biggest drive
in history for vital minerals, with
60,000 scientists, engineers and work
ers probing 385,000 square miles of
territory, Sen. Owen Brewster, R.,
Me., said today in challenging the
United States to surpass the pro
gram.
In all, he added, the Soviet Union
has 800 geological expeditions in the
field searching for coal, iron, oil and
other essential minerals.
He quoted "undisclosed, but au
thoritative sources" as advising him
the program is so far-reaching in
scope as to defy competition and
rivalry by any other nation.
The chairman of the senate war
investigating committee made his
statement in a letter to Chairman
George W. Malone, R., Nev., of the
Senate Public Lands subcommittee

CLARK ACCUSES RUSSIANS
NEW YORK. May 25 (UP).—Gen.
Mark W. Clark tonight accused the
Russians in Austria of confiscating
Austrian industries, farm products,
livestock and other Austrian re
sources i..eluding Danube river ship
ping illegally and in violation of the
Potsdam agreement.
"The Soviets in Austria have not
cooperated with the other occupy
ing powers in accordance with the
solemn pledges all of us macje to the
world for its future peace and pros
perity," Clark said in a radio speech
over the Columbia Broadcasting
Company network.
Announcing at the outset that he
wanted to speak "frankly and hon
estly" of relations with Russia,
Clark emphasized:
"I am convinced that to be firm
and definite in our relations with
the Soviet Union docs not increase
the chances of war, but on the con
trary reduces them."

HUNGRY CHINESE PEASANTS
SHANGHAI. May 25 (UP).—Near- j
ly 1,000,000 hungry peasants have
treivked into Shanghai in the past
few months seeking food and the
situation now is so desperate gov
ernment authorities arc fearful of
demonstrations which may flare into
open rebellion, informed sources said
today.
The influx of peasants have swelled
the city's population to nearly 5,-
000,000 and there is scarcely enough
rice on hand to feed Shanghai's nor
mal population of less than 4,000,000
persons, these sources said.
Shanghai's recent wave of labor
unrest and student strikes have
been blamed by Mayor K. C. Wu for
the lack of rice. Wu said Chinese j
Communists in North Kiagsu have j
cut off much of the city's rice sup- I
ply by seizing or destroying crops. I

CREDIT CONTROLS
WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP).—
All consumer credit controls will be
abolished completely soon, the only
question being whether the admin
istration or congress will do it, it
was indicated today.
The house banking committee,
which is studying the entire credit
picture, is considering three meas
ures calling for immediate removal
of restrictions on installment buying.
Congressional sources said, however,
that chairman Marriner S. Eccles of
the Federal Reserve Board, intends
to lift them, anyway.
Sweeping wartime restrictions on
consumer credit, imposed before
Pearl Harbor as an anti-inflation
measure and tightened up during the
war and again in August, 1946, were
relaxed last Dec. 1, following the
Republican election victory in No
vember.

Mr. Truman said she slept, most
of the day, but awoke at sufficient
intervals to permit him to talk with
her. "I talked to her on several oc-
I casions," he said.
MOCK 15-2!> RAIDS
ANDREWS FIELD, Md., May .5
j (UP). —Gen. George C. Kenney,
j commander of the strategic air
I forces, is planning two more mock
B-29 raids on major industrial tar
gets, he revealed today.
The targets have not y£t been
selected but the raids will be of a
surprise type, with crews of the su
perfortresses getting only a few
hours' notice of take-off time, Ken
ney said in an interview.
The first such raid, made along the
I eastern seaboard 10 days ago by 100
superforts and with advance notice
to the crews, as well as the millions
of residents in the target areas, was
I hampered by bad weather.
Procedure in the new raids, ac-
I cording to Kenney, will demonstrate
to the nation how quickly its long
range air force can take to the air
in an emergency.

RUSSIAN MINERAL DRIVE
WASHINGTON. May 25 (UP).—
Russia has opened the biggest drive
in history for vital minerals, with
60,000 scientists, engineers and work
ers probing 385,000 square miles of
territory, Sen. Owen Brewster, R.,
Me., said today in challenging the
United States to surpass the pro
gram.
In all, he added, the Soviet Union
has 800 geological expeditions in the
field searching for coal, iron, oil and
other essential minerals.
He quoted "undisclosed, but au
thoritative sources" as advising him
the program is so far-reaching in
scope as to defy competition and
rivalry by any other nation.
The chairman of the senate war
investigating committee made his
statement in a letter to Chairman
George W. Malone, R., Nev., of the
Senate Public Lands subcommittee
oil Natural Resources.

CLARK ACCUSES RUSSIANS
NEW YORK. May 25 (UP).—Gen.
Mark W. Clark tonight accused the
Russians in Austria of confiscating
Austrian industries, farm products,
livestock and other Austrian re
sources i..eluding Danube river ship
ping illegally and in violation of the
Potsdam agreement.
"The Soviets in Austria have not
cooperated with the other occupy
ing powers in accordance with the
solemn pledges all of us macje to the
world for its future peace and pros
perity," Clark said in a radio speech
over the Columbia Broadcasting
Company network.
Announcing at the outset that he
wanted to speak "frankly and hon
estly" of relations with Russia,
Clark emphasized:
"I am convinced that to be firm
and definite in our relations with
the Soviet Union docs not increase
the chances of war, but on the con
trary reduces them."

HUNGRY CHINESE PEASANTS
SHANGHAI. May 25 (UP).—Near- j
ly 1,000,000 hungry peasants have
treivked into Shanghai in the past
few months seeking food and the
situation now is so desperate gov
ernment authorities arc fearful of
demonstrations which may flare into
open rebellion, informed sources said
today.
The influx of peasants have swelled
the city's population to nearly 5,-
000,000 and there is scarcely enough
rice on hand to feed Shanghai's nor
mal population of less than 4,000,000
persons, these sources said.
Shanghai's recent wave of labor
unrest and student strikes have
been blamed by Mayor K. C. Wu for
the lack of rice. Wu said Chinese j
Communists in North Kiagsu have j
cut off much of the city's rice sup- I
ply by seizing or destroying crops. I

CREDIT CONTROLS
WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP).—
All consumer credit controls will be
abolished completely soon, the only
question being whether the admin
istration or congress will do it, it
was indicated today.
The house banking committee,
which is studying the entire credit
picture, is considering three meas
ures calling for immediate removal
of restrictions on installment buying.
Congressional sources said, however,
that chairman Marriner S. Eccles of
the Federal Reserve Board, intends
to lift them, anyway.
Sweeping wartime restrictions on
consumer credit, imposed before
Pearl Harbor as an anti-inflation
measure and tightened up during the
war and again in August, 1946, were
relaxed last Dec. 1, following the
Republican election victory in No
vember.

GRANDVIEW. Mo., May 25 (UP).
President Truman, apparently re
signed to his mother's slowly losing

(CST). When he returned to his
headquarters at the Muehlebacb
Hotel in Kansas City, the President
was obviously sad and downcast.
"She's just about the same," he
I said. They were words he has re
-1 peated many times in recent days.
"No perceptible change except that
she's just a little weaker again."
Mr. Truman said she slept, most
