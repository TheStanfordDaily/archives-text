# Row Cooks Keep Roughs Well Fed
## 
### STU FITCH 
"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach" has long
been the trade mark of a leading cookbook for young wives who
have just caught their men, old wives trying to hold on to theirs,
and college women looking lor anything in pants. Here on cam
pus are found experienced hands at the art of cookery who have

won the hearts of their eating
charges, and have gained for them
selves a traditional spot in the
houses where they work.
For example the Phi Gam house
without Lou or the SAE house with
out Mac just would not be quite
what they are today. Alums
coming back to recapture a few
nostalgic memories of their "young
er daze" would feel lost without the
one person who can remember them
"way back when."
JUST "MAC"
Lot Linwood Tewksbury Parker
Macdonald came to Stanford in 1938,
and except for three war years
spent in the Lathrop house kitchen,
has been dishing out food for hungry
Sig Alphs. The name, by the way,
is just a front and he barely knows
it himself. It is "Mac, thank you,
no more, no less."
The little Scotchman was born in
California along with a twin sister,
making the second set in the Mac
donald clan of six girls and three
boys. The family moved and Mac
wound up in Springfield, Mass.
Allowing the number of years re
quired of a person destined to grow
only live feet two inches tall, the
story of Mac is next picked up at
the Astor Lunch, his own little es
tablishment in Springfield.

Business was good, and for 12 years
life looked pretty rosy for Mac, Mrs.

neatly liquidated the business.
Mac came West on a visit and

ily. "And here we are," says he.
His sons are now married and the
cook has four grandchildren.

Allowing the number of years re
quired of a person destined to grow
only live feet two inches tall, the
story of Mac is next picked up at
the Astor Lunch, his own little es
tablishment in Springfield.
SINGS "POODLE DOG"
Business was good, and for 12 years
life looked pretty rosy for Mac, Mrs.
Mac, their three sons, and one
daughter. But the Hood of 1935
neatly liquidated the business.
Mac came West on a visit and
liked it so well he sent for his fam
ily. "And here we are," says he.
His sons are now married and the
cook has four grandchildren.
Mac is noted for his chocolate roll,
ice cream cake, and backyard bar.
Leeues. He loves to sing, and the
"Poodle Dog Song" is his vocal
specialty. When the brothers Sig
Alph burst forth with same, Mac
joins in with a whoop und a holler.
The loudest, highest voice is al
ways his, and by some undisclosed
secret, he manages to carry through
all lour verses and choruses with
out taking a breath.
His favored mealtime spot: peek
ing out ol the kitchen door window,
which is just low enough to give
him an eye-level view of his cus
tomers.
U>U LOVES YOUNGSTERS
Carrying the weight in the Phi
Gam kitchen is Louise Hunt, whose
liiendly manner immediately wins
the hearts of all who meet her. Lou
"pledged" Phi Gamma Delta in 1937,
und moved out ol the house only
for the war years to work at La
gunita and help set up Lincoln Hall
lor the med students.
"I love the association of young
people," says she, "they always
show such responsive pleasure to
things you do for them."
Lou hails from Maryland, but has
made California her home for the
past 15 years. She lives in South
Palo Alto where she surrounds her

self with flowers, her off-campus,
spare-time hobby.
ACTIVE IN SOCIAL GROUPS
How she finds time to putter in
her garden is another question. Busy
Mrs. Hunt, not content with just
her Stanford work, is active in many
social groups and is a national of
ficer in the California Federation of
Colored Women's Clubs.
Her activities range from cater
ing to driving in the Red Cross Mo
tor Corps. Until this year the Senior
Breakfast used to be her annual
job.
Lou is sold on Stanford and its
activities. "I have to go to all of
them," says she, "or my boys give
me a hard time."
Lou says her hashers are "perfect,"
and "although we have no sense at
all, we have an awful good time."
But she is just being modest; she
; herself is a college graduate.
' Her cooking specialty is Boston
J cream pie, which "melts in your
i mouth. And my french toast —my
boys know nobody can beat that,
they've tried everybody's."
"I've been at Stanford for 10
years," Lou says,"and it doesn't look
like I'm ever going to graduate."
