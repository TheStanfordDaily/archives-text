# Cardinals Trounce USF Dons in Slugfest, 9 to 2
## 
### 
Stanford's 1947 ball club marked its Sunken Diamond swan
song last Saturday with a barrage of six extra base blows and
eight singles as they pounded out a series-evening 9 to 2 triumph
over the visiting U.S.F. Dons. It was a hitter's field day, and the
Dons gained their share of the slugging spotlight when their

pitcher, Jack Shields, poked one of
Larry Wolf's pitches out over the
fence in feft field, the first circuit
blow in the Sunken Diamond since*
1942 and the fifth since the field was
built.
That homer was the first hit off
Wolf, and came in the third with
none aboard to tie the game up at
1-1.
TAKE 3-1 LEAD
The Indians came back in their
hall of that frame with two runs to
take a 3-1 lead, and after that they
were never headed as they added
four more runs in the fourth and
two in the sixth.
Lloyd Merriman, Ben Cardinalli
and Buck Brownson went hog-wild
at the plate for the Indians as they
connected for three triples, two
doubles and four singles—nine hits
in all—in 13 times at bat.
Cardinalli, whose current hitting
is vastly improved over his earlier
season efforts, drove in four runs
wilh a triple, a double, and a single,
and made some nifty stops at first
base.
MERRIMAN GETS FOUR
Merriman had a perfect day at
the plate, getting four for four and
a walk as he drove in three runs.
One of these hits was a triple.
Brownson had two hits in five

! trips, one of them a fence-hitting
| double which would have been a j
triple had it not bounced back onto j
| the playing field so fast.
Wolf, a senior, gained credit for j
j the win but was relieved by Dave
| Stott in the final innings.
j The victory was the 20th of the
J season for the Indians, of which 18
I have been scored on their home
| grounds, the Sunken Diamond, The
i win also gave the Dons and the In
| dians a 1-1 record for their 1947
two-game series, the Dons having
won the first one a week ago last
Saturday by a 13 to 4 margin.
