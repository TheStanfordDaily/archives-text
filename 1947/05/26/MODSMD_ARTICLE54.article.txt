# Cal Golfers Beaten By Farm
## 
### AL BRIDGES 
Coach Eddie Twiggs' NCAA defending champion golfers cel
ebrated the recognition of golf as a major Stanford sport by a near
clean-sweep in their matches against Cal's Golden Bears Satur
j day. When the smoke from sizzling sub-par golf had cleared
, from the local course, vanguished California crept sadly home-

ward nursing a 23' '< defeat and
perhaps wondering how they man
aged to tie the Card divot-diggers
earlier in the season.
Entering the fray on equal terms
with the Bears, as far as this sea
son's conference play is concerned,
the Farm linksmen demonstrated
their championship calibre by sew
ing up the contest before the morn
ing's singles matches were finished.
CAL WEAK IN SINGLES
Cal garnered but half a point in all
| the singles, when in the first match
Tom Lambie defeated the No. One
man of the Bears, Charles Manning,
From this point, the match became
a general rout as Bob Rosburg de
feated Don Schwab, 3-0; Bob Car
dinal swamped Hi Hennings by the
same count; Jack Shuler took Dave
Terreo, 3-0; Bob Rosecrance defeated
1 Dave Hanna, 3-0; and Kellberg had
j little difficulty in beating Sandy
Munroe, 3-0. All the zeroes were
collected by the Golden Bears.
Although the match had been de
cided by the morning singles, the

Farm doubles combinations rolled
over the Berkeley linksters in sim
ilar fashion, taking two out of the
three matches. The Bob Cardinal-
Rosburg combo started afternoon
proceedings by setting back Manning
and Schwab. 3-0.
KEEP ON SCORING
Coach Twiggs then entered the rel
atively inexperienced duo of Bob
Crozier and Terry Holmes against

Hanna and Munroe of the Bears,
but here again Cal drew a blank
while the Cards ran up three more
points.
However, Terreo and Hennings
averted a complete rout in the dou
bles matches by defeating the Farm's
Rosecrance-Moore in a 3-0 anti
climax to the day's fairway frolic.
Low score of the day went to
Stanford also, as both Rosburg and

Roseerance loured the difficult
Farm course in one-under-par 70's.
By the same score, Rosburg still
holds the lead among golfers quali
fying for the Northern California
Golf Association's tourney at Sac
ramento. Rosburg will be paired
against Capt. Fred Moseley in the
first round of match play today,
while Lambie takes on John Bonin
in the second division.

dinal swamped Hi Hennings by the
same count; Jack Shuler took Dave
Terreo, 3-0; Bob Rosecrance defeated
1 Dave Hanna, 3-0; and Kellberg had
j little difficulty in beating Sandy
Munroe, 3-0. All the zeroes were
collected by the Golden Bears.
Although the match had been de
cided by the morning singles, the

Farm doubles combinations rolled
over the Berkeley linksters in sim
ilar fashion, taking two out of the
three matches. The Bob Cardinal-
Rosburg combo started afternoon
proceedings by setting back Manning
and Schwab. 3-0.
KEEP ON SCORING
Coach Twiggs then entered the rel
atively inexperienced duo of Bob
Crozier and Terry Holmes against

Hanna and Munroe of the Bears,
but here again Cal drew a blank
while the Cards ran up three more
points.
However, Terreo and Hennings
averted a complete rout in the dou
bles matches by defeating the Farm's
Rosecrance-Moore in a 3-0 anti
climax to the day's fairway frolic.
Low score of the day went to
Stanford also, as both Rosburg and

Roseerance loured the difficult
Farm course in one-under-par 70's.
By the same score, Rosburg still
holds the lead among golfers quali
fying for the Northern California
Golf Association's tourney at Sac
ramento. Rosburg will be paired
against Capt. Fred Moseley in the
first round of match play today,
while Lambie takes on John Bonin
in the second division.
Coach Eddie Twiggs' NCAA defending champion golfers cel
ebrated the recognition of golf as a major Stanford sport by a near
clean-sweep in their matches against Cal's Golden Bears Satur
j day. When the smoke from sizzling sub-par golf had cleared
, from the local course, vanguished California crept sadly home-

ward nursing a 23' '< defeat and
perhaps wondering how they man
aged to tie the Card divot-diggers
earlier in the season.
Entering the fray on equal terms
with the Bears, as far as this sea
son's conference play is concerned,
the Farm linksmen demonstrated
their championship calibre by sew
ing up the contest before the morn
ing's singles matches were finished.
CAL WEAK IN SINGLES
Cal garnered but half a point in all
| the singles, when in the first match
Tom Lambie defeated the No. One
