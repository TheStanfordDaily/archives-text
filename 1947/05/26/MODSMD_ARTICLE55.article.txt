## The 						Rainy Season Is Over

Waterbagging at Encina Hall has gotten
out of hand.
Lately passing cars have been the targets
of the freshmen throwers living in Encina. One
car was reported to have a fifty dollar repair
bill as the result of a thrown missile from that
Luilding. Other motorists say that they have
lost momentary control of their cars due to
dodging waterbags.
Other accidents may be anticipated unless
the Encina men curb their juvenile tendencies.
Women, mothers of sponsors, have been
"attacked" with water bags by these same
members of the class of '50. It is hard to find
any possible motive behind their actions.
The grounds outside Encina are littered with
paper cups and other containers. Some of the
"waterbagging" has even been with coke bot
tles. The area looks more like the scene of
yesterday's picnic rather than a university
living group.
Although these episodes of waterbagging
have occured in the past and probably will
occur in the future the present demonstration
is not typical. Rather than a playful attitude
the present group of "open-window athletes"
have malicious intent in their activities.
Tomorrow night Encina Excom will hear a
few cases involving waterbagging adventures.
The freshmen themselves will have the op
portunity to show the campus that they will
not tolerate adolescent conduct within their
group.
Encina Excom should be strict enough that
future waterbagging contests will be kept at
a minimum.

If Encina Excom fails in their job the next
cases will probably go before Men's Council.
Much pressure has already been exerted on
this group to hear the cases of the offenders
by those who have been the victims of these
non-humorous pranks.
Persons appearing before Men's Council
will more than likely be seriously considered
for suspension. Such a decision by Men's
Council would be both popular and deserving.
This is a threat which hangs over the heads
of various of the Encina men.
It is a threat which Encina Excom and the
men who live in that building must eliminate
themselves.
The solution that we are thinking of would
also save a lot of water.—G.C.
