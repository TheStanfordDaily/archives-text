# A 						Song of Praise

### 
Friday night's Spring Sing was very well
handled. Although there are four or five more
groups singing this year than there were last
year, the show was run off in less time.
The announcer was excellent. Because of
his minimum of "patter" between songs, the
crowd was able to concentrate its attention on
what it came for—to hear the groups sing.
Also, the groups were rushed on and off the
"stage" so that there was very little waiting
between songs and the crowd did not become
restless.
All this adds up to a program well done.
We hope this year's example will be followed
in the future.—N.B.
