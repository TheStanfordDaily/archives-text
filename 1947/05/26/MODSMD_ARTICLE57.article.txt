# BULL SESSION

### HELEN PINKERTON 
"Be funny!" they shout at you. "Be funny like the
Spring Sing announcer. Come with the quips." You
want to be funny and still keep from sounding like
the Senior breakfast speaker. You want to talk
about nice things and still keep from sounding like
a dean of women in a heart-to-heart talk. You want
to talk about Stanford and not sound like an '02
alum at a reunion in Hong Kong.
The point is no matter how pessimistic you are,
no matter how much you may try to sound like a
Campus Opinion or History 1947 writer, you've
finally got to admit there arc some good things about
this place.
The women look like college women always do
and the men either like men-about-high school or
pre-maturely emeritus history professors. But when
you are isolated with them in a small area over a
period of years your taste is altered and you
to like the way they look. Unless you take the
annual journey over rough roads to Palo Alto you
forget in time what real people look like. The man
isolated with Stanford women begins to think all
women look like them, and it's instinctual that he
likes women.
When y6u make the sad discovery that not all
intellectuals are intelligent you can be thankful that
there aren't many at Stanford. Think what Chicago
must be like.
You can reflect that though the best acted and
directed student play in three years (Sartre's "No
Exit") was given only once in the Little Theatre, you
at least were able to get one of the tickets to it.
It's a good thing that nearly every department
has at least one teacher that saves it from total dis

repute in student eyes, though we usually differ on
who that teacher is.
It's a good thing the fire-house thistle blows once
in a while during a ten o'clock. It wakes up the per
son next to you and saves you the embarrassment of
poking him when class is over.
It's a good thing the Spring Sing is over.
Another, that there are eight oasis in the Quad
desert for stopping at on a lu>t afternoon walk to a
two o'clock.
The winds of freedom, thotigh filtered and gentle,
blow on occasion. Usually we are spared the dis
rupting experience of a tornadoâ€”at least whenever
those in charge get the warning signals and avert it.
Seriously, we should be gla>d that the beaches are
only twenty miles away, the City, thirty, and that
travel conditions in California -are the best. There
are so many good places you can get to from Stan
ford.
You should be, but probablj- are not, appreciative
of the fact that you receive the Daily five mornings
a week. Some college papers; come out six times
weekly.
Still being Pallyannish, considler the Health Service.
They are aware of the medical properties of penicil
lin tablets if nothing else.
Finally, you can be glad if at the end of four years
you have aL least one idea clear in your mind. My
idea probably isn't yours. It iisn't mine if it is. If
yours and mine are the same tihen there's bound to
be someone else who has already phrased it. And an
old but good idea is that the only thing we know is
that we don't know anything .Then we can start out
on a clean slate until we mess i'Jt up again.
