Considering the student as nothing else but an
individual, not as an apostle of learning, or a pro
phet on a world changing mission, but simply as a
person who is at this institution for the legitimate
selfish purpose of increasing his knowledge and
ability, the person who is individually striving for
a better position economically and socially in the
future United States. What does this student face
upon graduation?
Since the day 60.000 people were wiped out by
two (Sh!) Atomic Bombs in August 15)45 we in
America have consistently avoided much direct men
tion of the subject. Yet the bomb is with us. There
is the haunting fear of that preferably unnamed wea
pon, as a weapon. As a country we have avoided
this issue, but as long as it remains a national psy
chosis—students and individuals will wonder when
they think of building a home and a family in the
new world.
There is the consistent problem of a possible war
with Russia. Veterans and non-veterans alike are
still too close to the last one to view another with
anything but abhorrence, but fear of conflict with
us day and night. The question is not whether we
should fight but a vague fear that we might fight,
whatever the causes.
Leaving out the international aspects, what does
a student face on the national scene?
More and more control by larger and fewer cor
porations means that opportunity for individual ad
vancement becomes limited to a greater degree. The
graduate, whether in academic or scientific fields, must
cither become an atom in the orbit of a large num
ber of nameless people, or be satisfied with personal
satisfaction and little chance for advancement econ
omically.
We hear nothing but optimistic phrases from the
people who are now in the control of our economic
destinies. Any dissension, any deviation from the
chosen path, is greeted by attacks and hoots. But

again wc run into one of those vague and unmen
tionable problems.
The memory of 1929 and the dark days that fol
lowed are still ever present in) the national con
sciousness.
The thought of a new depression is one which
should never be talked about. "It can't happen again"
is the usual brave answer.
If it can't, if there isn't the fear of another de
pression and economic crisis why do we hear on
every side, "Gee, I'm glad that I'm graduating this
year. I can get a job and get a little money laid
away before the crack-up comejs."
We very seldom discuss this, but a bursting of the
inflationary bubble is ever preseait.
Then if spring comes can summer be far behind?
Cur economy is greater and more productive than
ever. The argument goes that lbr this reason there
will be no crisis. It can also follow that the next
depression will be the worst in history. Wars mean
more production, etc., but can ftt necessarily follow
that the war to end the depresstion can also be the
worst in history?
Say these are all national worries, that they have
nothing to do with the individual graduate. Tell me
that the people who get their shuepskins three weeks
from now will believe the optimistic speech they arc
sure to hear.
Tell me this and I will be. forced to disagree.
These ????? arc individual worries and problems.
War affects individuals. Depression affects individ
uals. Monopoly affects individuals. And the indi
vidual members of this present graduating class
know it.
The prevalent tension on the campus today is an
indication of their worry, of the students' worry, and
of a general uncertainty in tha future.
Ladies and gentlemen. On, the day you receive
those vaunted sheepskins I will be available three
miles down Portola road, toasting and hoping for
your future, and mine.

depression will be the worst in history. Wars mean
more production, etc., but can ftt necessarily follow
that the war to end the depresstion can also be the
worst in history?
Say these are all national worries, that they have
nothing to do with the individual graduate. Tell me
that the people who get their shuepskins three weeks
from now will believe the optimistic speech they arc
sure to hear.
Tell me this and I will be. forced to disagree.
These ????? arc individual worries and problems.
War affects individuals. Depression affects individ
uals. Monopoly affects individuals. And the indi
vidual members of this present graduating class
know it.
The prevalent tension on the campus today is an
indication of their worry, of the students' worry, and
of a general uncertainty in tha future.
Ladies and gentlemen. On, the day you receive
those vaunted sheepskins I will be available three
miles down Portola road, toasting and hoping for
your future, and mine.
Considering the student as nothing else but an
individual, not as an apostle of learning, or a pro
phet on a world changing mission, but simply as a
person who is at this institution for the legitimate
selfish purpose of increasing his knowledge and
ability, the person who is individually striving for
a better position economically and socially in the
future United States. What does this student face
upon graduation?
Since the day 60.000 people were wiped out by
two (Sh!) Atomic Bombs in August 15)45 we in
America have consistently avoided much direct men
tion of the subject. Yet the bomb is with us. There
is the haunting fear of that preferably unnamed wea
pon, as a weapon. As a country we have avoided
this issue, but as long as it remains a national psy
chosis—students and individuals will wonder when
they think of building a home and a family in the
new world.
There is the consistent problem of a possible war
with Russia. Veterans and non-veterans alike are
still too close to the last one to view another with
anything but abhorrence, but fear of conflict with
us day and night. The question is not whether we
should fight but a vague fear that we might fight,
whatever the causes.
Leaving out the international aspects, what does
a student face on the national scene?
More and more control by larger and fewer cor
porations means that opportunity for individual ad
vancement becomes limited to a greater degree. The
graduate, whether in academic or scientific fields, must
cither become an atom in the orbit of a large num
ber of nameless people, or be satisfied with personal
satisfaction and little chance for advancement econ
omically.
We hear nothing but optimistic phrases from the
people who are now in the control of our economic
destinies. Any dissension, any deviation from the
chosen path, is greeted by attacks and hoots. But

again wc run into one of those vague and unmen
tionable problems.
The memory of 1929 and the dark days that fol
lowed are still ever present in) the national con
sciousness.
The thought of a new depression is one which
should never be talked about. "It can't happen again"
is the usual brave answer.
If it can't, if there isn't the fear of another de
pression and economic crisis why do we hear on
every side, "Gee, I'm glad that I'm graduating this
year. I can get a job and get a little money laid
away before the crack-up comejs."
We very seldom discuss this, but a bursting of the
inflationary bubble is ever preseait.
Then if spring comes can summer be far behind?
Cur economy is greater and more productive than
ever. The argument goes that lbr this reason there
will be no crisis. It can also follow that the next
depression will be the worst in history. Wars mean
more production, etc., but can ftt necessarily follow
that the war to end the depresstion can also be the
worst in history?
