set for Saturday, said Jeff Howe, re
tiring president of Intcrfratcrnity
Council, yesterday.
The scholarship is open to all fra
ternity men with a 2.5 grade aver
age, he said. An applicant must
furnish letters of recommendation
from a professor in his major de
partment, the president of his fra
ternity, and one off-campus source.
Arrangements with London are
still being made there is a pos
sibility that the university will not
be able to take care of a Stanford
student this year, said Howe, but
the council is going ahead with the
selection to prevent any possible
last-minute rush.
Howe requests that all interested
fraternity men contact him at the
Alpha Delt house before Saturday.

American Institute of France,
Inc., a liaison body to facilitate the
exchange of qualified students and
scholars between the United States
and France, plans to permit Ameri
can students to study in institutions
in France not entered by foreigners
before the war, according to Gra
ham Stuart, member of the advisory
committee.
They hope to permit American
medical graduates to serve as in
terns in French hospitals and to al
low students of art to study in the
Ecole des Beaux Arts. The organi
zation also plans to assist American
students who want to do special
studies in France, Dr. Stuart said.
The plan will allow French stu
dents to study in America as well.
While the Institute is privately
financed and managed, official rec
ognition has been granted it by the
French government. Henri Bonnet,
French ambassador to the United
States, is the honorary president of
the institute.
