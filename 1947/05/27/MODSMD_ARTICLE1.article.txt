### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., May 26 (UP).â€”Albania complained to
the United Nations tonight that 43 Greek airplanes roared over
an Albanian shepherds camp last week, loosing "volleys" which
killed two persons and wounded eight.
The protest was filed with UN secretary general Trygve Lie

in an angry letter from Col. Gen.*
Enver Hoxha, Albanian minister of
foreign affairs.
The Albanian official characterized
it as an "attempt to manufacture !
bloody arguments" in order to guar
antee a security council decision to i
maintain a constant UN patrol in the !
Balkans."
The letter asked Lie to advise the
UN security council of the matter
"so that a definite end will be put j
to these deeds of international ban- ;
ditry perpetrated by the Greek mon
archo-fascist government ..."
But it did not urge specific secur
ity council action against the Greek
government, thus raising the prob- i
ability that the Albanian protest 1
would be handed to the Balkans in
vestigating subcommission now pa
trolling the borders of Greece and
its three northern neighbors.
