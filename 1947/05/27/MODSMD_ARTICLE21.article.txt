# Women Clarify Lockout Rules
## 
### 
Women's Council and lock-out
chairman from each woman's living
group held a special meeting Thurs
day night in the Women's Clubhouse
to discuss and clarify the special
policies for this quarter.
Two important points clarified by
Jean Gait, Council Chairman, are as
follows:
1) A girl not registered in a Uni
versity residence unit who is stay
ing overnight is entitled to either a
1:30 or a 2:30 o'clock late leave,
neither of which counts on her hos
tess' quota,
2) Penalties shall be in the form
of monetary fines only if the case is
handled at the last meeting of the
school year and it is impossible to
give a lock-in penalty, or if the case
is against a graduating senior. The
fines shall be levied in the following
manner: Sunday night penalty—so
cents, Friday night penalty—7s cents,
Saturday night penalty—sl.
Other rules governing special pol
icies may be discussed with coun
cil members or lock-out chairmen.
The bonus system, which was put
into effect for the first time this
quarter is working fine, according to
the representatives present at the
meeting. Although there are more
late returns than before, there are
fewer actual lock-outs, stated Miss
Gait.
