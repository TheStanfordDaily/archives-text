112 Internationalism of the Ruhr Basin
is essential to the security of France
j and to the peace of the world" before
| an audience which nearly filled Cub
j berley Auditorium.
Leonard Hesterman, California
debater for the affirmative, came in
as a close second to Church, and
Robert Bennett, Stanford sopho
more, placed third. Malcolm Bar
rett, Stanford, and Kenneth de Mat
tei and Donald Bell, California, tied
for fourth.
M. Andre Rousselet, vice-consul
of France, presented the solid silver
medal to Church. Arthur F. Do
mergue, president of the Alliance
Frangaise which sponsors the de
bate, represented that group.
Dr. Peter Odegard, president of
Reed College, wrote the specific
question, which was announced to
the debaters by Dr. Alvin C. En
rich, vice - president of Stanford,
three hours befoi'e the debate. The
general topic of the debate was
"France and World Peace."
Each university was represented
on each side of the question, and
each contestant was completely sep
arate from the others, according to
Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of the Stan
ford Law School, who presided at
the debate.
Church presented as his answer to
the affirmative side of the question,
which demanded international con
trol of the Ruhr Basin, examples
showing the "futility and latent
danger of seizing an integral part
of a nation and subjecting it to in
ternational control." He argued
against having the Ruhr Basin in
ternationalized by saying that oc
cupation of the area would create a
sullen and unhappy people and that
"the interests of world peace were
never advanced by a sullen people."
Church stated that the world
should learn from the mistakes of
the past in trying to internationalize
an area, and should use alternative
methods in the case of the Ruhr Ba
sin. He also said that control by the
United Nations would keep Ger
many from becoming a threat to
France.

Dr. Peter Odegard, president of
Reed College, wrote the specific
question, which was announced to
the debaters by Dr. Alvin C. En
rich, vice - president of Stanford,
three hours befoi'e the debate. The
general topic of the debate was
"France and World Peace."
Each university was represented
on each side of the question, and
each contestant was completely sep
arate from the others, according to
Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of the Stan
ford Law School, who presided at
the debate.
Church presented as his answer to
the affirmative side of the question,
which demanded international con
trol of the Ruhr Basin, examples
showing the "futility and latent
danger of seizing an integral part
of a nation and subjecting it to in
ternational control." He argued
against having the Ruhr Basin in
ternationalized by saying that oc
cupation of the area would create a
sullen and unhappy people and that
"the interests of world peace were
never advanced by a sullen people."
Church stated that the world
should learn from the mistakes of
the past in trying to internationalize
an area, and should use alternative
methods in the case of the Ruhr Ba
sin. He also said that control by the
United Nations would keep Ger
many from becoming a threat to
France.
