# Veterans' Center Offers Guidance During Summer
## 
### 
The Veterans' Guidance Center on campus will continue
operation during summer quarter, and men interested in tak
ing advantage of the service at that time are urged by Veter
ans' Co-ordinator George D. Barahal to come in and make ap
pointments immediately. The appointments may be left with
Lewis A. Day, the VA representa-♦

tive at the Center, at his office in
the west wing of Building 3, one of
the temporary buildings behind the
Library.
The Guidance Center has been
operating at capacity for the past
three quartet's with a heavy back
log of appointments. But because of
the smaller enrollment this sum
mer, there is considerable time open
for returning veterans who desire
the service.
Mr. Barahal, who is in charge of
the program, explained that the vo
cational guidance method used con
sists of both objective tests and in
terviews by professional counselors.
In the series of interviews the
counselor obtains factual data about
the veteran concerning his educa
tional history, past employment,
leisure activities, and general voca
tional outlook.
The tests giv°n the veteran, he
said, are designed to determine his
mental ability, vocational interests,
personality, and special aptitudes,
such as mechanical, musical, cleii
cal. etc.
The same tests are not used for
every man, but depend upon the
results of certain basic tests and the
information learned by the coun
selor.
The entire process costs over $20
for each veteran, but the service is
free to the veteran and not de
ducted from his entitlement.

Veterans who wish their sub
sistence checks for the month of
June mailed to an address differ
ent from their present Stanford
address are advised by Veterans'
Co-ordinator Georue I). Barahal
to leave notice with Mr. Young in
the Veterans' Records Office be
fore June 1.
This anodes to students under
the GI B'll who will not be at
Stanford for the summer quarter.
The amount of the checks will
cover the first 11 days of June
hut will not he mailed until July 1.
If no change of address is left
with Mr. Young, delivery of the
check wLU he made but it will be
considerably delayed.

"We feel that the process is pretty
thorough and systematic," said Mr.
Barahal, "and by use of the inter
views, objective tests, survey of
school records, and other data, we
can arrive at the best educat'onal
plan for each specific veteran."
"Only by evaluating complete
data in this way can we prevent
haphazard and superficial results,"
he said.
Mr. Barahal added that in addi
tion to the regular vocational serv
ice, veterans with personal and so
cial problems of any kind may come
in for private int?rviews, and psy
chiatric help may be arranged
through the center.
The functions of the entire cen
ter, he explained, are first, to assist
J lie veterans attending Stanford un
der PL 16 in the selection of occu
pational objectives and training
courses necessary to accomplish
their rehabilitation.
The second function is to provide
educational and vocational guid
ance to veterans attending under
PL 34G in order that they may
choose and plan their course of
training as intelligently as possible.
