# Married Veterans Tell Budget Trials
## 
### 
Biggest problem confronting the
married couples living at the Vil
lage is scrimping on the $90 sub
sistence granted married vets under
the GI Bill.
Couples spend from $165 to $300
for each month's expenses. All 320
couples and families find that the
$90 is barely enough for food and
rent.
Many vets have additional ex
penses in caring for their children
because government subsistence of
$35 for the first child is insufficient.
