# Costumes in 'Devil's Disciple' Will feature Fashions of American Revolutionary Period
## 
### 
Fashions in vogue at the time of
the American Revolution will be
featured in the Stanford Players'
production of George Bernard
Shaw's "The Devil's Disciple,' open
ing its three-night run Thursday at
8:15 p.m. in the main auditorium of
Memorial Hall.
The costumes in this satirical
melodrama range from the red and
white uniforms and white wigs of
the British soldiers and the long

flowing ginghams of the ladies and
the sparkled waistcoats of rich mer
chants to the blue and white uni
forms of the American patriots.
Some of these costumes, Miss Vir
ginia Opsvig of the Speech and Dra
ma Department explained, were
made by the department in past
years; a great many of them were
donated by people who no longer
wanted them. One lady donated a
steamertrunk full of clothes of the

period from 1889 to 1910.
"Each show adds something to
this costume supply," Miss Opsvig
declared, "and each show takes out
something. We are always able to
find something three we can use
in every show."
Tickets to "The Devil's Disciple,"
the last subscription series produc
tion of the quarter, are on sale for
90 cents in room 202, Memorial Hall.
For reservations call PA 22041.
