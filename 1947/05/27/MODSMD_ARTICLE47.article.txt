# Broncs Building For Pre-War Greatness
## 
### BILL HACHTEN 
(Editor's note: This is the third in a series of stories reviewing the
football prospects of the teams on Stanford's I!M7 schedule.)

Santa Clara is still rebuilding antl dreaming of the great Sugar Bowl
teams of Buck Shaw. Although not yet up to the potency of the prewar
Bronco teams, Coach Len Casanova's 1947 club will be a stronger and
more experienced eleven than last year's injury-riddled aggregation.

Stanford won't be able to write off
the Bronco-Indian game on Oct. 11
as a "breather" between the Michi
gan and UCLA contests. For Santa
Clara always comes high for Stan
ford as last year's game proved,
when the underrated Broncos turned
the breather into a free-scoring, nip
and tuck fracas which the Cards
clinched only in the fourth quarter,
33 to 26.
BACKFIELD RETURNS
Casanova has the same backfield
returning he had last year. Stubby
Billy Crowley gets the call at quar
terback over A 1 Martin.
In fullback Bill Prentice, the
Broncs have one of the finest backs
on the coast. Prentice, who played
with the Second Air Force team,
was handicapped last year with a
bad ankle.
At the halfback spots will be Hall
Haynes and Vern Hare, brother of
the famous Cecil and Ray. Both of
these backs played their first year
of college football last year.
LINE PROBLEM
Casanova's one problem in the
line is to replace his two tackles,
John Falsarella and Ed Alliquie,
who both graduated. Right now it
looks like John Hock, 200, and Tom
Payne, 195, will get the call. Payne,
a sophomore, is reportedly a terror
on defense.
There's no worry at end with Cy
Smith, 195, and Jerry Hennessey,
200, the two regular ends, both re
turning. Last year's center. Guy
Giocopuzzi. is back as are the two
guards, Gil McDermid and Don Nie
haus.
OUTSTANDING JC STARS
Outstanding among many junior
college transfers practicing at Santa
Clara this spring are Bill Sheridan.
Bill Renna, and Ellery Williams.
Sheridan, a fine "T" quarterback,
and Renna, a big fullback, are from
the undefeated Menlo JC team. Wil
liams is a sensational pass snagger
from Muir Junior College.
Coach Casanova will continue to
use his Missouri "T" formation with
the quarterback operating behind a
split line either as a ball carrier or
as a blocker after he has lateraled
to a halfback. The fullback is pri
marily a blocker instead of the num
ber one running back as he is in the
Stanford "T."
Although 1947 may not be their
year, Santa Clara is on th" way to
ward regaining its former position
as the leading independent team in
the West.
