# Shaughnessy Lays Plans For Clinic
## 
### 
Clark Shaughnessy, former Stan
ford Grid master, who mentored per
haps the Indians' most spectacular
squad from the depths of the PCC
scrap pile in '39 to the championship
and a thrilling 21-13 Rose Bowl vic
tory over Nebraska in his first season
on the Farm, is planning to open a
football clinic at the Huntington Ho.
Tel in Pasadena, during the latter
part of July.
Frank Leahy, Notre Dame's head
coach who teamed with Shaughnessy
in their successful venture of this
nature last year, is expected to head
the staff. Aiding Shaughnessy in the
organization of the clinic is Rube
Samuelson, prominent sports editor
of the Pasadena Star-News, who is
currently authoring a book on the
Rose Bowl games.
Perhaps the most important single
factor for Stanford's great showing
in 1940 was the re-introduction of
the "T" system by Shaughnessy.
The Chicago Bears were the only
other major team to use the "T" at
that time. Today it is estimated that
this system is in between 75 to 80
percent utilization.
Shaughnessy hopes to have the
key men of his "T" Rose Bowl of
fense, that is center Vic Lindskog,
and the backfield of Albert, Kmeto
vic, Gallerneau, and Standley to help
in the instruction.
