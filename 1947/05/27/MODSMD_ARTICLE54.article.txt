# From Grid to Links, Saga of Patty Berg
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
She tore her clothes playing football so her mother made
her switch to golf.
This was the starting point in the career of Patty Berg, the
red-head freckled-face tomboy of Minneapolis, who today is one
of America's top woman golfers.
"I guess I've always been interested in sports from the time

I could walk," Miss Berg said.
"Whatever my (wo brothers did, I
followed —baseball, swimming, foot
ball. But when I came home from '
football games a little worse for
wear, mother called a halt to my
sports activities."
TAKES UP GOLF
It was then, at fifteen, that Miss
Berg took up golf. Five years later
she was the Women's National Am- j
ateur golf champion and she recent
ly won the Natonal Opens at Spo
kane by defeating Betty Jamieson.
Skating, however, was her main
interest before she turned to golf.
In her 'teens, she won the Minne
sota state finals and was runner-up
in the nationals. "I told people that
I quit skating because it was too
cold," Miss Berg remarked. "The
real reason is that I wasn't very
good."
At her demonstration at Stanford
last Thursday, Miss Berg empha
sized the use of an overlapping grip.
"The grip is the thing in golf," (he
women's champ stated, and proved
it with drives of 225 yards.
IIIT TURF LAST
In using irons, Miss Berg pointed
out that the ball should be hit first,
THEN the turf—the opposite of what
many golfers believe. She brought
out the point that many a woman
who hasn't the driving power of men
can beat the men when it comes to
chipping and putting.
She complimented Stanford on its
fine golf instructors, like Mrs. Syl
via Cain, stating that very few col
leges offer really good instruction.
"I've heard favorable reports about |
your course, too," Miss Berg said, i
"although I've never had the oppor
tunity to play it. With the golfers
you turn out here, it really must be
above standard."
Asked whom she considered the
top women golfers in the country
today, the professional champion
listed Babe Diedrickson Zaharias,
Louise Suggs, and Dorothy Kirby.
PLY SHOTS LOW
During her demonstration, Miss
Berg brought out the interesting
fact that when she and a group of
noted golfers toured England they
had to play all their shots low be
cause of the terrific winds in the
British Isles.
In appearance, the woman golfer,
who turned professional in 1940, still
resembles the cute, freckled - face
kid who romped through the streets
of Minneapolis with a football under
her arm. "Before people start figur
ing, though." 1he red-haired golfer
said, "I'll admit to being 29 years
old."
In a low, husky voice. Miss Berg
told the Stanford crowd one of her
favorite golm anecdotes. She had
just begun a match with a woman

called Hotgingaris when a little boy
pulled on her sweater, looked up at
her encouragingly, and said, "Gee,
ma'am, I hope you win." Miss Berg
smiled, and went on to the next hole
where the performance was repeat
ed. At the third hole, however, the
boy added that both he and his fa
ther hoped she'd win. Finally Miss
Berg stopped, turned to the boy, and
asked him just why he was so con
cerned over her victory. "Well, you
see, Miss Berg," he said, "my father
runs a newspaper and everything in
it is written up except this match.
We have just a tiny space for the
headline and Berg is the only name
that will fit."
She tore her clothes playing football so her mother made
her switch to golf.
This was the starting point in the career of Patty Berg, the
red-head freckled-face tomboy of Minneapolis, who today is one

top women golfers in the country
today, the professional champion
listed Babe Diedrickson Zaharias,
Louise Suggs, and Dorothy Kirby.
PLY SHOTS LOW
During her demonstration, Miss
Berg brought out the interesting
fact that when she and a group of
noted golfers toured England they
had to play all their shots low be
cause of the terrific winds in the
British Isles.
In appearance, the woman golfer,
who turned professional in 1940, still
resembles the cute, freckled - face
kid who romped through the streets
of Minneapolis with a football under
her arm. "Before people start figur
ing, though." 1he red-haired golfer
said, "I'll admit to being 29 years
old."
In a low, husky voice. Miss Berg
told the Stanford crowd one of her
favorite golm anecdotes. She had
just begun a match with a woman

called Hotgingaris when a little boy
pulled on her sweater, looked up at
her encouragingly, and said, "Gee,
ma'am, I hope you win." Miss Berg
smiled, and went on to the next hole
where the performance was repeat
ed. At the third hole, however, the
boy added that both he and his fa
ther hoped she'd win. Finally Miss
Berg stopped, turned to the boy, and
asked him just why he was so con
cerned over her victory. "Well, you
see, Miss Berg," he said, "my father
runs a newspaper and everything in
it is written up except this match.
We have just a tiny space for the
headline and Berg is the only name
that will fit."
She tore her clothes playing football so her mother made
her switch to golf.
This was the starting point in the career of Patty Berg, the
red-head freckled-face tomboy of Minneapolis, who today is one
of America's top woman golfers.
"I guess I've always been interested in sports from the time

I could walk," Miss Berg said.
"Whatever my (wo brothers did, I
followed —baseball, swimming, foot
ball. But when I came home from '
football games a little worse for
wear, mother called a halt to my
sports activities."
TAKES UP GOLF
It was then, at fifteen, that Miss
Berg took up golf. Five years later
she was the Women's National Am- j
ateur golf champion and she recent
ly won the Natonal Opens at Spo
kane by defeating Betty Jamieson.
Skating, however, was her main
interest before she turned to golf.
In her 'teens, she won the Minne
sota state finals and was runner-up
in the nationals. "I told people that
I quit skating because it was too
cold," Miss Berg remarked. "The
real reason is that I wasn't very
good."
At her demonstration at Stanford
last Thursday, Miss Berg empha
sized the use of an overlapping grip.
"The grip is the thing in golf," (he
women's champ stated, and proved
it with drives of 225 yards.
IIIT TURF LAST
In using irons, Miss Berg pointed
out that the ball should be hit first,
THEN the turf—the opposite of what
many golfers believe. She brought
out the point that many a woman
who hasn't the driving power of men
can beat the men when it comes to
chipping and putting.
She complimented Stanford on its
fine golf instructors, like Mrs. Syl
via Cain, stating that very few col
leges offer really good instruction.
"I've heard favorable reports about |
your course, too," Miss Berg said, i
"although I've never had the oppor
tunity to play it. With the golfers
you turn out here, it really must be
above standard."
Asked whom she considered the
top women golfers in the country
today, the professional champion
listed Babe Diedrickson Zaharias,
Louise Suggs, and Dorothy Kirby.
