# Broncos, Cal Close Indian Ball Season
## 
### 
With the Santa Clara game only
one day away and the season's finale
against Cal coming up this Satur
day, the question of whether or not
the Farm's ball club will manage to
nose out U.C.L.A. for the third place
berth in the final C.1.8.A. standings
is rapidly coming to a final show
down.
The Indians are currently one
game behind the Uclans, who close
their season Friday and Saturday
with two tough games with their
pennant-hungry Southland foes,
U.S.C.
NO HOPE
Coach Harry Wolter's hustling
players are faced with the rather
discouraging fact that if they only
duplicate whatever the Uclans do
against the Trojans, the Farm will
still finish the season a lull game out
of the first division.
Somehow, they have to pick up at
least a game in the short space of
two tilts before the week is out, a
leat which, though difficult, is not
too impossible in the light of recent
performances in the rumble-tumble
C.1.8.A. season.
FACE BRONCOS
Luckny, the Ucrans will have their
hands full with the powerful Trojans,
whereas the Indians get a crack at
Santa Clara—even though that game
is on the road.
Wolter is tentatively planning to
use Larry Wolf and Dave Stott in the
important game against the Bron
cos, with Ward Walkup taking his
post behind the plate.
With third-baseman Bill Arce suf
fering from a bad ankle which he
banged up in the St. Mary's game,
the Indians will again rely on the
lineup which blasted U.S.F. last Sat
urday.
