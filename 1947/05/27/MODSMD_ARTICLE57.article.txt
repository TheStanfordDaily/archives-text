# Farm Netters Again Absorb Double Loss
## 
### 
Victims of another double dose of southern hospitality (?), tennis
court variety, Stanford's hapless Indian netmen returned Sunday from
Los Angeles without that elusive first conference victory. Friday the
locals dropped a tight 6-3 count to UCLA; then on Saturday, the USC
league leaders applied an 8-1 whitwashing to the Farm team.

Ironically, both match scores du
plicated the count chalked up by
the Southland net giants when they
invaded the local courts earlier in
the season. Again the Trojan rac
quet men swamped the Indians
with a minimum of effort. Stanford
once more had the Bruins reeling
in the Friday tiff, but UCLA pulled
the close matches out of the fire for
the win.
SHAKES LINEUP
Coach Elwyn Bugge shook up his
starting lineup in both matches in
an attempt to stem the LA on
slaught. First singles position fell
to Ted Myers, who had shown
marked improvement in the first
Bruin match. But Myers could not
cope with either Herb Flam of the
Bruins or Arnie Saul of USC in the
feature matches.
Flam, who has yet to drop a sin
gles set in conference singles, was
forced to the limit before tripping
Myers, 6-4, 6-4. Then on Saturday,
Troy's pride, Arnie Saul, methodi
cully hung a 6-3, 6-4 defeat on the
tiring Myers.
LONE WIN
Lone victory against the Tro
jans came in the first doubles match'
where Dave Basham and Bob Rut
ledge outlasted Saul and Jack Kerr,
3-6, 6-3, 6-1. The doubles play of
the Basham - Rutledge combo was
one of the few bright spots as the
duo nearly upset the fabulous Flam-
Gene Garrett team which won the
Ojai doubles championships this

year. The Indians dropped the bat
tle, 8-6, 7-5.
The closest that the Indians came
to another win over the Trojans was
the doubles team of Bob Lewis and
Kirke Mechem who fought three
sets before losing, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Harris and McDonald upheld the
Troy championship honor by an
nexing the win.
Stanford's league record now
stands at no wins and five losses,
which relegates them to the confer
ence cellar.

Kirke Mechem who fought three
sets before losing, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.

Troy championship honor by an

Stanford's league record now
stands at no wins and five losses,

Victims of another double dose of southern hospitality (?), tennis
court variety, Stanford's hapless Indian netmen returned Sunday from
Los Angeles without that elusive first conference victory. Friday the
locals dropped a tight 6-3 count to UCLA; then on Saturday, the USC
league leaders applied an 8-1 whitwashing to the Farm team.

Ironically, both match scores du
plicated the count chalked up by
the Southland net giants when they
invaded the local courts earlier in
the season. Again the Trojan rac
quet men swamped the Indians
with a minimum of effort. Stanford
once more had the Bruins reeling
in the Friday tiff, but UCLA pulled
the close matches out of the fire for
the win.
SHAKES LINEUP
Coach Elwyn Bugge shook up his
starting lineup in both matches in
an attempt to stem the LA on
slaught. First singles position fell
to Ted Myers, who had shown
marked improvement in the first
Bruin match. But Myers could not
cope with either Herb Flam of the
Bruins or Arnie Saul of USC in the
feature matches.
Flam, who has yet to drop a sin
gles set in conference singles, was
forced to the limit before tripping
Myers, 6-4, 6-4. Then on Saturday,
Troy's pride, Arnie Saul, methodi
cully hung a 6-3, 6-4 defeat on the
tiring Myers.
LONE WIN
Lone victory against the Tro
jans came in the first doubles match'
where Dave Basham and Bob Rut
ledge outlasted Saul and Jack Kerr,
3-6, 6-3, 6-1. The doubles play of
the Basham - Rutledge combo was
one of the few bright spots as the
duo nearly upset the fabulous Flam-
Gene Garrett team which won the
Ojai doubles championships this

year. The Indians dropped the bat
tle, 8-6, 7-5.
The closest that the Indians came
to another win over the Trojans was
the doubles team of Bob Lewis and
Kirke Mechem who fought three
sets before losing, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Harris and McDonald upheld the
Troy championship honor by an

Stanford's league record now
