## Let's Make Dead Week 'Dead' 
### 
j There is a University regulation which
states that there shall be no examinations
given within seven days of finals. Every
quarter we hear of violations of this regula
tion, and the Committee on Schedules ex
pects these to be turned in.
Generally the violations occur because pro
fessors forget or do not know about the rule.
If they are informed of it, they generally agree
to work out some solution which they believe
will be fair to all students.
Sometimes they take a vote of the class to
see whether the majority favors having the
test then or before dead week starts. The
majority of the class often votes for the pre
viously scheduled time because it will give
them more time to prepare for the test. But
at the same time, whether the students realize
it or not, it gives them less time to prepare
fbr their finals.
Another common method of solving the
problem is to make the test optional, but those
who take it get to drop their lowest grade of
all their tests, or some other favorable arrange
ment. This method puts the pressure on stu
dents to take the test and takes time away
from their preparation for finals.
The students should not even have to make

a choice on whether or not to take a test dur
ing dead week.
Although the professors act in good faith
and are not trying to put any strain on the
students, they are not acting in the spirit of
the regulation.—N. B.
