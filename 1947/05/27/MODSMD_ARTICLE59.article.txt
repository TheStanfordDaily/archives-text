# It's Up to You

Encinamen have put themselves on the spot
by the recent extreme incidents of waterbag
ging and vandalism. The tough job of re
stricting these incidents has been handed to
Encina Excom.
But the burden of preventing future epi
sodes really rests more with the men of En
cina than it does with Encina Excom, for the
measures which the Excom takes will accom
plish nothing if freshmen are not willing to
accept its decisions as binding.
One of the main advantages of student gov
ernment at Stanford is that student affairs for
the most part are left to the students.
The manner in which Encinamen accept this
responsibility may have great influence on the
amount of responsibility which future classes
receive.
