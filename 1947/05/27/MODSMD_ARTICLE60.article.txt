# BULL SESSION

### TOM SELF 
This is about a wedding, the Stanford Memorial
Church—and Jane Withers.
First, the wedding. Sunday Dave Schooley and I
married off our other roommate, Ben Schmid. At
Ben's bachelor party (with Jeanne Hewlett, his bride
to-be along to prevent any funny business) various
characters commiserated with us over the loss of a
roomie. But we allowed that from our point of view
we weren't losing a brother, we were gaining a sister.
It was just an informal wedding, small crowd, no
elaborate preparations. But somehow the Stanford
Memorial Church makes a wedding of any propor
tions the most impressive ceremony in the world.
Perhaps it's the organ music, maybe the Church
itself. But for myself, I know I wasn't really scared
until Rev. Hall started to read the marriage ritual.
He surely does it right.
Sometime I would like to investigate an idea
I have that marriages performed in the Stanford
Church are bound to last longer than others. I know
the minister certainly threw the fear of God into me
when he spoke of entering into marriage, "Which is
an honorable estate"; and when he said, "what God
has joined together, let no man put asunder."

Yes, I know all ceremonies are
like that, but in the Memorial
Church, it's meaningful. Some peo
ple say the Church is too gaudy.
But Jack Mashin, Grossmont High
School athletic coach, says it is
more beautiful than any he has
seen. He should know. His hobby
is traveling and visiting churches
all over the world. Neither Euro
pean cathedrals nor Oriental tem
ples overshadow it, he says. And,
do you know, there are Stanford
students who have lived on the|
Farm for four years without oncel
visiting the Church!

Now about that Jane Withers. Instead of my
usual hamburger steak at Carlun's Saturday night, I
had dinner at Rickey's with the bride and groom,
best man, bridesmaid Jane Withers, and her fiance.
Bill Moss. Rickey's will be happy to know that at
least half a dozen times during dinner Jane ex
claimed, "Gee, I sure love this place."
Probably at this point I should put in a plug for
Jane's new picture. But I'm not sure of the title.
Fact is we talked of everything but movies.
Both Jane and Bill did admit however that they
like San Francisco because showfolks can have a
good time there, the townspeople treat them as they
desire, like ordinary people.
Jane Withers is certainly unaffected by all her
17 years in the movie city—quite a pleasant contrast
to a certain female swimmer. Just to show you she
wasn't listening merely to be polite, as soon as she
spotted Mrs. B. at the reception, she exclaimed, "O'h,
that's the wonderful cook you've been telling me
about. I must meet her."
Bill said he liked the climate and surroundings
here better than Southern California, that if it wasn't
for his work he'd move here. Hurrah! He volun
teered the information himself; I didn't have to drag
it out of him.
Jane was glad there weren't any flower girls at the
wedding. She recalled the time she nearly broke up
a wedding at the age of four by hurling the basket
at someone she disliked. She is still a rather high
spirited miss, although she keeps her boisterousness
under good control. In the vestry of the church
she collared me and whooped, "I hope you've got
plenty of rice. We couldn't find any anywhere." At
the reception she helped us tie cans on the "Just
Married" car. And when the boys chased Ben off
campus in a loud model "A", she screamed, "Oh,
that wonderful car." She's still pretty much the
same Jane Withers who played the lovable brat in
the Shirley Temple pictures.
