# HISTORY 1947
## 
### ALLEN BLETZ 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt has now receded over
two years into history; far enough to give us sonic
perspective on him, and not far enough to be a cold
figure on a monument. We remember some of his
lighter aspects—the cockily tilted cigarette in its long
holder, the genial give and take of some of the pices
conferences, the boyish interest in the sea, and his
almost equally boyish zeal for politics. We may recall
points on which we differed with him, particularly
in the field of domestic policy. Few could be ira,
100 per cent agreement all the time with this volatile,
versatile, and impulsive man.
We may remember, too, with sadness, the way in
which the Presidential office wore him down. The
buoyant person of 1933, so vigorous that his physical
handicap was all but forgotten, passed by degrees into
the pale warrior of the Yalta Conference, wearied by
responsibility, grieved by the deaths of so many
of those whom he in constitutional theory and in bold
fact commanded, faced with the necessity of decisions
and compromises.
But neither gaiety nor courage, neither devotion
nor endurance, would have availed to keej> his mem
ory green if he had Hot been right on the main issue
of his time. He saw, earlier than most people, the
dreadful issue that faced this nation. When he said,
"I hate war," we know he meant if. he said
(hat he did not plan to send American boys overseas,
we know he meant that, too. But the tirr e came when

the question was whether we should fight overseas
or in defense of our own shores.
Some may still argue that he could have side
stepped that question. He could have betrayed the
Chinese and accepted the overlordship of Japan in
the Orient. He could have betrayed European civ
ilization and accepted the rule of the Beast on the
Continent and in Britain. He need not have sold our
over-age destroyers, leased the Atlantic bases, urged
the Lend-Lease system, undertaken an armed defense
of our right to go upon our lawful errands on the high
seas. If his leadership had been of that kind, he
might have confused and delayed American arma
ment and American thinking until it was too late.
We might have kept out of the war until our friend"?
were disposed of. We might still be at peace while
a victorious Germany, Italy, and Japan made ready to
destroy us.
Franklin Roosevelt understood our people and
our destiny. He led us where we had to go and
where, in spite of the horrors of our journey, we
wanted to go. He laid the foundations for our par
ticipation in a new organization to keep the peace —
the United Nations. It would be foolish to try to rank
him among our Presidents, greater than this one, not
so great as that one. But he was a man for his time,
overcoming a physical handicap as other great Ameri
cans overcame poverty, meeting the requirements of
an office which demanded that its occupant, whether
a great man or not by natural endowment, act greatly.

holder, the genial give and take of some of the pices
conferences, the boyish interest in the sea, and his
almost equally boyish zeal for politics. We may recall
points on which we differed with him, particularly
in the field of domestic policy. Few could be ira,
100 per cent agreement all the time with this volatile,
versatile, and impulsive man.
We may remember, too, with sadness, the way in
which the Presidential office wore him down. The
buoyant person of 1933, so vigorous that his physical
handicap was all but forgotten, passed by degrees into
the pale warrior of the Yalta Conference, wearied by
responsibility, grieved by the deaths of so many
of those whom he in constitutional theory and in bold
fact commanded, faced with the necessity of decisions
and compromises.
But neither gaiety nor courage, neither devotion
nor endurance, would have availed to keej> his mem
ory green if he had Hot been right on the main issue
of his time. He saw, earlier than most people, the
dreadful issue that faced this nation. When he said,
"I hate war," we know he meant if. he said
(hat he did not plan to send American boys overseas,
we know he meant that, too. But the tirr e came when

the question was whether we should fight overseas
or in defense of our own shores.
Some may still argue that he could have side
stepped that question. He could have betrayed the
Chinese and accepted the overlordship of Japan in
the Orient. He could have betrayed European civ
ilization and accepted the rule of the Beast on the
Continent and in Britain. He need not have sold our
over-age destroyers, leased the Atlantic bases, urged
the Lend-Lease system, undertaken an armed defense
of our right to go upon our lawful errands on the high
seas. If his leadership had been of that kind, he
might have confused and delayed American arma
ment and American thinking until it was too late.
We might have kept out of the war until our friend"?
were disposed of. We might still be at peace while
a victorious Germany, Italy, and Japan made ready to
destroy us.
Franklin Roosevelt understood our people and
our destiny. He led us where we had to go and
where, in spite of the horrors of our journey, we
wanted to go. He laid the foundations for our par
ticipation in a new organization to keep the peace —
the United Nations. It would be foolish to try to rank
him among our Presidents, greater than this one, not
so great as that one. But he was a man for his time,
overcoming a physical handicap as other great Ameri
cans overcame poverty, meeting the requirements of
an office which demanded that its occupant, whether
a great man or not by natural endowment, act greatly.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt has now receded over
two years into history; far enough to give us sonic
perspective on him, and not far enough to be a cold
figure on a monument. We remember some of his
lighter aspects—the cockily tilted cigarette in its long
holder, the genial give and take of some of the pices
conferences, the boyish interest in the sea, and his
almost equally boyish zeal for politics. We may recall
points on which we differed with him, particularly
