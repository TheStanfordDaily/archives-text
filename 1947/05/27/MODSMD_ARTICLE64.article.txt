# English Instructor Publishes Second Collection of Poetry
## 
### 
''The Judge Is Fury," the new
book written by J. V. Cunningham,
former instructor in English at Stan
ford, is to be published June 11. It
is the second collection of poems
by the author of "The Helmsman,"
and, according to The Swallow Press
and William Morrow and Company
who are its publishers, is a book by
"a poet who works with an amazing
knowledge of his craft and presents
his deeply felt, brilliantly controlled
observations of human experience.
Ironic, objective, weighted with a
fine sense of tradition, these lyrics
combine frankness and simplicity
with striking originality of thought."
Mr. Cunningham, despite the fact
that he was born in Maryland, is a
Westerner. "I have not been east of
St. Mary's, Kansas, since I was four,"
he says."I grew up in Montana,
spending my winters in town and my
summers on a dry-land ranch. I find
that the imagery of my poems is
often derived from the whoalfields
and rattlesnakes of those years."
Mr. Cunningham entered Stan

ford in 1931 and graduated in Clas
sics in 1934. He then continued
graduate work in Classics and sup
ported himself largely by teaching
Freshman English. He later taught
advanced writing at Stanford,
Shakespeare to undergraduates, and
the Latin Tradition to graduate stu
dents. As he says himself, he has
specialized in some odd things—the
Latin poet Propertius, Shakespeare's
use of Scholastic philosophy, and
mathematical Logic. Mr. Cunning
ham now teaches at the University
of Chicago.
