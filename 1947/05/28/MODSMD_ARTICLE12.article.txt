# Truman Asks Housing Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP).â€”
President Truman, predicting that
large-scale home building will be a
national concern for at least another
10 years, asked Congress today to
approve a permanent consolidation
of the government's multiple hous
ing activities to replace the present
set-up.
In a special message, he laid down
a detailed plan for the consolida
tion in accordance with the Reor
ganization Act of 1945. It will be
come effective automatically in GO
days unless rejected by Congress
within that time.
At the same time, he renewed
pressure on the lawmakers for fast
er action on the long-delayed legis
lation aimed at providing "a decent
home and a suitable living environ
ment for every family."
REMINDS CONGRESS
Reminding Congress that he rec
ommended legislation to meet that
objective in his State of the Union
message last Jan. 0, Mr. Truman
said:
"No lesser objective is commen
surate with the productive capacity
and resources of the country or
with the dignity which a true de
mocracy accords the individual citi
zen. ... I again recommend the
early enactment of this legislation."
Regardless of Congress' perma
nent housing plans, the President
said, a wholesale agency reorgani
zation is needed to prevent ineffi
ciency and overlapping of functions
when the present temporary set-up
is terminated months after the offi
cial end of the war or whenever the
President or Congress terminates
Title One of the first War Powers
Act.
AGENCY WILL DISSOLVE
When that occurs, he pointed out,
the temporary National Housing
Agency will dissolve automatically
and the government programs will
be scattered among some 13 agen
cies in seven departments.
His plan would transfer the NHA
programs to a new housing and
home finance agency and would set
up a National Housing Council on
which the new agency, its member
organizations, and all other federal
departments concerned with hous
ing would be represented.
