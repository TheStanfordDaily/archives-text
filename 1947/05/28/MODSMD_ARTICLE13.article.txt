Stressing the importance of prop
aganda as an instrument of Ameri
can national policy, George E. Tay
lor, director of the Far Eastern In
stitute at the University of Wash
ington, closed the Tuesday Evening
Series for this quarter last night
with his talk on "Soviet and Ameri
can Propaganda."
Mr. Taylor said propaganda is an
instrument that cannot be neglected
in getting our policies understood
abroad. "It is perfectly possible for
us to do a constructive job without
resorting to Soviet methods," he
said.
U.S. TELLS TRUTH
Our methods, he said, are to es
tablish credibility by telling the
whole truth. We describe our race
riots to foreign countries so that we
will be believed when we really
want to be believed.
Pointing out that our government
has always played a decisive part
in Far Eastern affairs, Mr. Taylor
said we should not stop now. The
Russian government has already in
fluenced the Far East to a great ex
tent, and we should see that our
policies and way of life are under
stood as well as the Russian point
of view.
Tlie chief beliefs we must over
come abroad, Mr. Taylor said, are:
(1) The United States is a land of
divorces, crimes, money, and false
sophistication. (2) The United States
is an imperialist country. (3) The
United States is a capitalist coun
try.
NATIONS DISTRUST US
The last two ideas arc the most
dangerous, Mr. Taylor asserted, be
cause other nations distrust us be
cause of them. They believe that
we wish to expand, and the atom
bomb at Bikini has made them fear
that we were only showing off our
power.
The fact that we are a capitalist
country has led other peoples to
believe that we are operating under
an unstable economy. They believe
we are headed for certain depres
sion which will influence most of
the world.
We must change these ideas, Mr.
Taylor stated, or we will surely lose
the prestige we had before the war.
