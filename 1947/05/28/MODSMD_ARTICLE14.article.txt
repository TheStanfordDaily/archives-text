About 40 of Stanford's ROTC stu

the country for specialized training
in their fields this summer.
The courses arc for six weeks and
begin about June 23.
Air Corps will go to March Field,
California, where they will receive
general Air Corps instruction and
some flying experienqe.
Ordnance will go to Aberdeen
Proving Ground, Maryland, while
the Field Artillery and Quartermas

The program calls for practical
