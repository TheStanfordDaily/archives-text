The cost of labor accrued at Roble
in unpacking extra silverware will

said.
Campus Police Chief Gordon Da
vis advised the six men:
"You are very fortunate that an
officer did not apprehend you when
you climbed out that Roble window
at such an hour (approximately 3
a.m.). He would have been per
fectly justified in shooting, under
the assumption that a felony had
been committed."
