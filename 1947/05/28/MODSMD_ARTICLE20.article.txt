# Stalnaker Will Resign Dean of Students Post
## Accepts Full-Time Directorship Of Pepsi-Cola Scholarship Board 
### 
John M. Stalnaker has submitted his resignation as Dean ot
Students, to take effect not later than fall. Mr. Stalnaker, how
ever, will remain on the faculty as a professor of psychology, it
was announced yesterday by President Donald B. Tresidder.
Dean Stalnaker explained that his resignation was due to the

impossibility of handling the pres
sure of duties as Dean of Students
together with other obligations, as
sumed prior to coming to Stanford
in the fall of 1945, as secretary
treasurer and director of the Pepsi-
Cola Scholarship Board. This is a
program, rapidly being expanded
and soon to be extended into the
field of fellowships, which he or
ganized while at Princeton in Feb
ruary, 1945.
DIFFICULT DECISION
In his letter of resignation, which
he handed in "with regret," Dean
Stalnaker wrote:
"The decision to resign has been
made especially difficult because I
believe the position of Dean of Stu
dents is a soundly conceived one
which can function effectively and
efficiently, and because the admin
istrative officers of Stanford Uni
versity are, I believe, wise, able,
and friendly. I could not ask for a
better group with which to be asso
ciated."
Mr. Stalnaker will devote the ma
jor portion of his time in the future
to the Pepsi-Cola Scholarship Board
of which he has been serving in a
part-time capacity as director since
its organization in February of 1945.
This announcement was made today
by Floyd W. Reeves, professor of ad
ministration at the University of
Chicago and president of the Schol
arship Board.
SCHOLARSHIP BOARD PLEASED
Professor Reeves wired to Stan
ford, "We of the Board are singu
larly pleased that John M. Stalnaker
has finally agreed to serve as full
time director of our program. Since
he does not wish to sever all con
nection with the University, we
consider it fortunate that he is will
ing to give up his administrative
position there to devote the greater
part of his time to us."
"With the expansion of the Pepsi-
Cola scholarship program to include
the granting of twenty-six three
year graduate fellowships in addi
tion to the 725 scholarship awards
each year, a full time director has
become essential," Professor Reeves
said.
The national offices of the Pepsi-
Cola Scholarship Board will remain
in Palo Alto, according to Mr. Stal
naker, and the administration of
this program, which covers the
United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and
Puerto Rico, will continue to be
handled from here.


JOHN M. STALNAKER has
submitted his resignation as Dean
of Students. He will remain on
the faculty, however, as a pro
fessor of psychology.
