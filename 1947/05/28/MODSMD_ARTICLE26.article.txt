# People Want Freedom, Security, Says Odegard
## 
### 
"The people of the world will choose that form of society
offering the greatest chance for security and personal freedom.
II we try, the United States can still be the hope of the world."
This was the declaration of Peter H. Odegard, Reed College
president, speaking before the 1947 Phi Beta Kappa meeting in

the Women's Clubhouse Monday
night on "The Decline of the West —
A Re-examination."
Remarking on the title of his ad
dress, Dr. Odegard said he regret
ted that (he topic had been limited
to western civilization.
\\ OKIJ) CIVILIZATION
"The adjective implies a separation
<>l our civilization from that of other
reeions and other peoples. This
M'ems to me regre table because in
my judgment the salvation of west
ern civilization depends on the
< mergence of a world civilization,"
he stated.
The billions earmarked for mili
tary uses should be spent to combat
ignorance and want, in all parts of
the world, he said. Above all, we
must avoid another 'economic de
|/i«:sion, which would have pro
found effects on all countries.
PEOPLE CHOOSE SECURITY
If ..offered a choice between secur
ity ind freedom, the war-weary
people of the world would probably
choose security. It is up to the West
to. ; how (hem that both are possible
under democracy.
"Western civilization throughout
the centuries had been an aggressive
foM-e, a force which appeared irre
sistible," he declared pointing to (he
domination of the Middle East. Asia,
Africa, and America.
The major conflicts have devel
oped not between civilizations, but
within this aggressive civilization,
he continued. This inner conflict
is likely to engender a longing for
stability, which may manifest itseh
i't attempts to stamp out all ideas
contrary to the culture.
C IJLTIJRAL DEGENERATION
The rise of (his attitude marks
the beginning of cultural degenera
tion," he said.
Such a decaying civilization can
not resist the attack of another with
more faith and more zeal. He
pointed out the strength of Russian
communism and the apparently
growing tendency of China and In
dia to follow Russia's lead in a ri
valry of East against West.
"Our democracy would perish in
another war, because it would force
a sacrifice of all the principles which
have guided us for the last 1000
y ars," he declared.
Dr. Odegard stated that the val
ues governing western civilization
fall info four categories: humanism,
liberalism, science, and relativity,
'i It strength of these principles lies
in the fact that they a.< jerl nothing
contrary to the dignity of man.
"IMERNAL FASCISM" ENEMY
Communism is not our greatest
( nerny, he emphasized. Rather, ev
i ly American should be on his guard
a> ainst "internal fascism" which
fosters racial intolerance, and which
will contribute to the breakdown of
our ideology.
