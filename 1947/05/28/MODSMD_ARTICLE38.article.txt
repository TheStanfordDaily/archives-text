Farm Cadillacs become outmoded
during these postwar summer days
when a Rough and his date can hop
; nto an airplane for a Sunday flight
in the country.
A few days ago Phil Welch, Daily
photographer, and Walter Lull,
Stanford Flying Club president,
made such a flight in an ex-Army
trainer around this area. Welch
photographed familiar scenes dur
ing the flight.
As they took off, Welch snapped
the first picture on the left showing
the airport as their PT-19 made its

GO - mile - per - hour run down the
macadam strip.
In the next photo Welch caught
an El Camino highway-Palo Alto
residential scene as Lull piloted the
plane up to 500 feet.
Turning left at 500 feet the plane
flew parallel to the Paly field. In the
foreground ex - Army trainers are
tied down. In the background in
front of field buildings are the air
port's Aeronca trainers.
As Lull circled the PT-19 over the
campus at 2,000 feet, Welch caught
three familiar Farm scenes in his
camera—the golf course; Lake La

gunita, Boathouse, Roble, and La
gunita; and the main Quad area with
Hoover Library, Mem Aud, and the
men's gym.
Seventh picture of the series in
cludes parts of Palo Alto, Mountain
View, and the Navy's Moffett Field.
Both Hoover Library and Moffett
Field may be seen from San Fran
cisco on a clear day at a few thou
sand feet altitude.
Last photo on the ride was snap
ped as Lull brought the plane down
to 200 feet for a landing. As the
plane neared the Palo Alto Yacht
Club, the Farm's crewmen were

spotted in their three .shells. Here
one of the shells bucks the day's stiff
20-30-mile-per-hour wind.
On every flight Stanford pilots
see all of the scenes pictured in
Welch's photos. Several times each
quarter Stanford Flying Club mem
bers organize picnics and sight-see
ing trips to such points as Hollister,
Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay, and
Hamilton Field.
"In September," Lull said, "our
| flying club will be open to any stu
dent or faculty member interested
in flying activities. Only requirement
| is personal interest in flying and !

participating in club programs."
During winter months the club
plans to present informative speak
ers and movies on various phases
of aviation. MofTett Field extended
an invitation to Stanford Flyers two
weeks ago to visit the base later in
the year when poor weather begins.
The club will see Navy GCA
(ground controlled approach) guide
planes to a landing on one of the
Moffett strips.
Flying enthusiasts desiring more
information about Stanford's flour
ishing air club may contact Lull at
the Theta Delta Chi house, PA 8635.

Farm Cadillacs become outmoded
during these postwar summer days
when a Rough and his date can hop
; nto an airplane for a Sunday flight
in the country.
A few days ago Phil Welch, Daily
photographer, and Walter Lull,
Stanford Flying Club president,
made such a flight in an ex-Army
trainer around this area. Welch
photographed familiar scenes dur
ing the flight.
As they took off, Welch snapped
the first picture on the left showing
the airport as their PT-19 made its

GO - mile - per - hour run down the
macadam strip.
In the next photo Welch caught
an El Camino highway-Palo Alto
residential scene as Lull piloted the
plane up to 500 feet.
Turning left at 500 feet the plane
flew parallel to the Paly field. In the
foreground ex - Army trainers are
tied down. In the background in
front of field buildings are the air
port's Aeronca trainers.
As Lull circled the PT-19 over the
campus at 2,000 feet, Welch caught
three familiar Farm scenes in his
camera—the golf course; Lake La

gunita, Boathouse, Roble, and La
gunita; and the main Quad area with
Hoover Library, Mem Aud, and the
men's gym.
Seventh picture of the series in
cludes parts of Palo Alto, Mountain
View, and the Navy's Moffett Field.
Both Hoover Library and Moffett
Field may be seen from San Fran
cisco on a clear day at a few thou
sand feet altitude.
Last photo on the ride was snap
ped as Lull brought the plane down
to 200 feet for a landing. As the
plane neared the Palo Alto Yacht
Club, the Farm's crewmen were

spotted in their three .shells. Here
one of the shells bucks the day's stiff
20-30-mile-per-hour wind.
On every flight Stanford pilots
see all of the scenes pictured in
Welch's photos. Several times each
quarter Stanford Flying Club mem
bers organize picnics and sight-see
ing trips to such points as Hollister,
Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay, and
Hamilton Field.
"In September," Lull said, "our
| flying club will be open to any stu
dent or faculty member interested
in flying activities. Only requirement
| is personal interest in flying and !

participating in club programs."
During winter months the club
plans to present informative speak
ers and movies on various phases
of aviation. MofTett Field extended
an invitation to Stanford Flyers two
weeks ago to visit the base later in
the year when poor weather begins.
The club will see Navy GCA
(ground controlled approach) guide
planes to a landing on one of the
Moffett strips.
Flying enthusiasts desiring more
information about Stanford's flour
ishing air club may contact Lull at
the Theta Delta Chi house, PA 8635.
