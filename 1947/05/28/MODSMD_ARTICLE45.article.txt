Civil engineering students may
apply on or before Monday for the
Wing Memorial Scholarship of $300
or for the next year's special schol
arship of $400.
Any upper division or graduate
student who will be registered in
the department of civil engineering
next autumn, winter, or spring quar
ters is eligible on the following con
ditions:
He must have at least a "C" aver
age, be a regularly registered stu
dent for at least one year preceding
the first installment of the scholar
ship, prove the award will be a real
help to him, and signify his inten
tion to follow civil engineering as a
life work.
O'nly discharged veterans of World
War II may be considered for the
special award. The Wing Memorial
Scholarship does not have this pro
vision, however.
Applications for the scholarships
may be obtained from Miss Alice
Sullivan, Room 206, Civil Engineer
ing building.
