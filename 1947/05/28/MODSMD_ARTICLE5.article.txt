## 
### 
Students in all houses on campus
are asked by the Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization to put old
clothes, soap, paper, notebooks, pen
cils, and anything else that might
be used by needy persons into large
boxes instead of throwing them
away.
These boxes will then be collected
and the contents sent to a selected
list of foreign people in need of aid
and to the University of Naples,
