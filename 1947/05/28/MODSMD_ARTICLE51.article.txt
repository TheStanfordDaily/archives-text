# Cardinals Meet Broncos Today
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's ball players pack up their duds and hit the road for
Santa Clara this afternoon as they invade the Bronco diamond in
o make-or-break game which they need to win to keep in the
running for a third-place berth in the final C.1.8.A. standings.
But there's no tellinq whether the Cardinals will be "up" or

'down" for today's match, even
though they will be facing their
road "jinx" once again.
If the Indians play up to the
Lrftnd of ball they can display, they
should come home with their sev
enth C.1.8.A. scalp in 14 games
.salely tucked away. But then, if
they have another of! day they might
just as well bid farewell to their
chances for winding up in an upper
division conference berth.
WOLF STARTS
Big, hardworking Larry Wolfe will
! o to the mound to start today's
; ame, for which Coach Harry Wol-
U r plans to use his "share-the-pitch
ing" policy which he has employed
oft and on throughout the season.
Dave Stott is the other hurler
NVolter will be using todav. Both
Siott and Wolfe are righthanders,
S.ott being a freshman and Wolf a
senior.
With regular third baseman Bill
Arce out of action with a bad ankle,
the Indians will take the field again
with a patched-up infield. But the
"patched-up infield" is a very good
one, indeed, for all four performers
have been playing regularly in var
ious positions all season long.
Ted Nell, who came in from right
P.eld not long ago to take over sec-

1 ond base, has been shifted over to
third, which he played last Satur
day as the Indians played great de
fensive ball in winning, 9 to 2.
PETERS AT SECOND
Scrappy Bob Peters will be back
on his old second base position, with
Captain Buck Brownson holding
down short and Benny Cardinalli
reaching for the high ones at first.
In the outfield, Clyde Dingfelder,
Lloyd Merriman and George Sloat
are the men who'll see action, with
A 1 Kircher on hand for any other
outfield duty that may come up.
BRONX'S NEED WIN, TOO
Not only is the game an impor
tant one for the Indians, but the
Broncs themselves badly need a win
to keep out of a tie for the cellar.*
Thus Eldon O'Brien, the late season
hurling act for the Broncs, will prob
ably start again today for hosts.
The first time the Broncs battled
the Indians this spring, they were
treated to a 4 to 3 defeat, the score
showing little of the Farm's su
premacy that day.
But two weeks ago, when the In
dians visited Santa Clara, the Broncs
took advantage of a general fielding
collapse on the part of their foes
and coasted to a 7 to' 1 victory.


LARRY WOLFE, smooth-working
Stanford senior, gets the call for
mound duty today when the Cards
tackle Santa Clara in a crucial
CIBA diamond encounter.

enth C.1.8.A. scalp in 14 games
.salely tucked away. But then, if
they have another of! day they might
just as well bid farewell to their
chances for winding up in an upper
division conference berth.
WOLF STARTS
Big, hardworking Larry Wolfe will
! o to the mound to start today's
; ame, for which Coach Harry Wol-
U r plans to use his "share-the-pitch
ing" policy which he has employed
oft and on throughout the season.
Dave Stott is the other hurler
NVolter will be using todav. Both
Siott and Wolfe are righthanders,
S.ott being a freshman and Wolf a
senior.
With regular third baseman Bill
Arce out of action with a bad ankle,
the Indians will take the field again
with a patched-up infield. But the
"patched-up infield" is a very good
one, indeed, for all four performers
have been playing regularly in var
ious positions all season long.
Ted Nell, who came in from right
P.eld not long ago to take over sec-

1 ond base, has been shifted over to
third, which he played last Satur
day as the Indians played great de
fensive ball in winning, 9 to 2.
PETERS AT SECOND
Scrappy Bob Peters will be back
on his old second base position, with
Captain Buck Brownson holding
down short and Benny Cardinalli
reaching for the high ones at first.
In the outfield, Clyde Dingfelder,
Lloyd Merriman and George Sloat
are the men who'll see action, with
A 1 Kircher on hand for any other
outfield duty that may come up.
BRONX'S NEED WIN, TOO
Not only is the game an impor
tant one for the Indians, but the
Broncs themselves badly need a win
to keep out of a tie for the cellar.*
Thus Eldon O'Brien, the late season
hurling act for the Broncs, will prob
ably start again today for hosts.
The first time the Broncs battled
the Indians this spring, they were
treated to a 4 to 3 defeat, the score
showing little of the Farm's su
premacy that day.
But two weeks ago, when the In
dians visited Santa Clara, the Broncs
took advantage of a general fielding
collapse on the part of their foes
and coasted to a 7 to' 1 victory.


LARRY WOLFE, smooth-working
Stanford senior, gets the call for
mound duty today when the Cards
tackle Santa Clara in a crucial
CIBA diamond encounter.
Stanford's ball players pack up their duds and hit the road for
Santa Clara this afternoon as they invade the Bronco diamond in
o make-or-break game which they need to win to keep in the
running for a third-place berth in the final C.1.8.A. standings.
But there's no tellinq whether the Cardinals will be "up" or

'down" for today's match, even
though they will be facing their
road "jinx" once again.
If the Indians play up to the
Lrftnd of ball they can display, they
should come home with their sev
enth C.1.8.A. scalp in 14 games
.salely tucked away. But then, if
they have another of! day they might
just as well bid farewell to their
