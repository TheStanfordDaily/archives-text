# Netmen Get Last Chance-Cal Bear Here Saturday
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Stanford's tennis team gets its last shot at a conference win
Saturday afternoon when California visits the Farm courts. The
first matches start at 1:30 p.m.
The Indians will be after revenge for an earlier 5-4 defeat at
the hands of the Bears. Both teams have slumped into the lower

regions of the Conference standings,
so nothing will be at stake in Sat
urday's clash. The Indians have lost
five league matches without a win.
Meanwhile, the Bears can boast of a
lone conference victory, that over
the Indians.
STOCK HIT NEW LOW
When the California netters upset
the Indians by the odd game, Stan
ford tennis stock hit a new low for
ihe season. The Bears had been go
ing nowhere in the net world, and
the Indians expected to collect the
win. But the Berkeley hosts blun
dered through to an eyelash victory.
In their last meeting, the Bears
; nd Indians split the singles matches,
3-3, with four of the battles going
three sets. In doubles competition,
Cal's first team romped through to
an easy 6-2, 6-1 win. But the Card
inals tied the match score up again
as Bob Lewis and Kirke Mechem
duplicated the win for Stanford, 6-2,
6-3.

j was reeled off between the Card duo
â€¢ of Ross Hughes and Drew Putty and
Cal's brother combo of Phil and Bob
Seymour. After three electrifying
I sets, the Bears finally pulled the
1 match out of the fire with a 7-5, 4-6,
j 7-5 win.
But the Eerkeley fiasco is dead
history now, and the Indians think
j that they can reverse the score when
| the Bears visit the local courts. The
great improvement displayed by
Ted Myers and the play of the dou
: bles team of Rutledge and Basham
! down South may lift the Stanford
J netmen to a win Saturday.
MYERS GETS TOP SPOT
Myers operated at first singles in a
surprise shift by Coach Elwyn Bugge
for the U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. matches.
Although he did not collect a win,
Myers could possibly beat the ad
mittedly weaker Bear singles play
ers. In the first Cal match, Myers
dropped a 6-4, 6-1 decision to Ralph
Gish of the Bears.
