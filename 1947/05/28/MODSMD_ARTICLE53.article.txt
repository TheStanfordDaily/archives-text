Although last weekend's dual
meet with Cal in the Berkeley
Pool was called the Big Meet,
the real "Big Meet" as far as
Coach Tom Haynie's varsity
swimmers are concerned is the com
ing Pacific Coast Conference South
ern Division championship finale
which will be held in the UCLA
Pool this Saturday.
Southern Division standard bear
ers by virtue of their easy victory in
last year's finals, the Stanford swim
mers will go after their second suc
cessive Southern Division champion
ship since returning to the water
sport after the war. On a basis of
previous performances this season,
the Indians rate the edge in this one
and should return the championship
to the Farm, although Cal and USC
could gang up to make things
mighty tough for the locals.
The team will miss the services of
distance man Fred Taioli, who has
decided not to compete. This loss
will be partially offset, however, by
the return of Harry Borchers.
