# PCC Titles Lure Farm Links Sextet
## 
### 
The big event of Pacific Coast col-

legiate golf gets under way tomor
row in Los Angeles, when individ
uals and teams enter the hot com
petition for Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship titles. Coach Ed
die Twiggs and his national champ
golfers left yesterday for the three
day tournament in high hopes of re
turning with plenty of the winning
hardware.
The present Stanford links sextet
of Tom Lambie, Bob Rosburg. Jack
Shuler, Bob Cardinal, Bob Rose
crance, and Ernie Kellburg have
proved their ability by a fine com
petitive record this year. Although
tied once by the Golden Bears of
Cal and beaten once by San Jose
State in a very close match, the
team bounced back later in the sea
son to soundly trounce San Jose
State and completely rout Cal. 23 Va
-31/2, for the best conference record
on the coast. Also victims of the
Farm's golf power were the vaunt
ed UCLA and Trojan linksmen.
With such a record Stanford en
ters the tourney favored to win eas
ily in the team events; and the con
sistent low 70's golf played by the
team members all season should cop
some of the individual titles also,
although Bob Gardner of the Bruins
may be the biggest threat in singles
play.
