# Cindermen Face Cal In 'Big Meet'
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
Stanford's cindermen, boasting only a lone victory over a
weak combination of local junior colleges in dual meet competi
tion, will.be out to end the season in a blaze of glory by decis
ioning Cal in the Big Meet at Edwards Stadium, Berkeley, Sat
urday. The Indians' chances of doing just that appeared quite

slim at the start of the year, but the
definite improvement shown by the
Farm's athletes coupled with the
injuries to key Bear performers,
have made this hitherto dream look
more and more like a reality.
MAPLES, HARTZELL READY
Any way you figure it the final
outcome should be as close as the
proverbial "two peas, in the pod."
The recovery of Roland Maples,
Cal's dusky sprinter, who has been
sidelined for three weeks with a
leg injury, and the return of the
missing miler, Tom Hartzell, re
portedly sniping polar bear in Alas
ka, could easily be the difference.
Foul rumor from Berkeley has it
that Maples has just been taking a
little siesta, while Ilartzell will def
initely succumb to the urge to do
or die for the "Sturdy Golden
Bear."
Stanford's chief weakness all along

| has been ill the field and especially
weight events. Come through per
formances by Otis Chandler in
the shot, Steve McK.ee in the dis
cus, Bill Larson in the pole vault,
Frank Held in the javelin, and Gay
Bryant in the broad and high jumps
could go a long way in getting the
Indians over the hump.
FIRST DUAL WIN FOR GRIMES?
On the track side, Frankie Gan
nhl should make the opening event,
the mile run, a winning one for
Stanford, even if Hartzell does show
up, figuring that polar bear hunting
should not be too conducive to good
leather lunging. If he is going to
win one this year, it'll have to be
Saturday â€” referring to Stanford's
George Grimes, half-miler who
! showed exceptional promise at the
start of the year, but has yet' to
' notch his first dual meet victory.
