# '48 Cage Slate Released
## 
### ART LUBIC 
It's here! It finally happened! The Pacific Coast Conference
has gone practical! From Don Liebendorfer's office last night
came news that the Southern Division of the PCC will feature bal
anced schedules in its 1948 basketball slate.
The four coaches involved—Everett Dean of Stanford, Nibs Price of
California, Wilbur Johns of UCLA, and Sam Barry of Southern Cali
fornia—met on the Stanford campus last month and agreed upon the new
schedule indicating that it may be adopted on a permanent rotating basis.
Here's just what the '48 schedule entails. Instead of going South
at different times to play either UCLA or USC twice on a weekend. Stan
for and California will jog to the Southland on the same weekends and
tiie Bruins and Trojans will retaliate by journeying north together. Each
will alternate opponents on Friday and Saturday nights of these trips,
which is a step in the right direction toward lairer and more accurate re
sults in the final standings.
Also discussed by the coaches was the possibility of playing one
doubleheader, bringing all four teams together on one floor on the same
night. This has marvelous potentialities. A doubleheader would draw
a capacity house wherever it would be held—whether in the Shrine Audi
torium or Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, Cal's cage gymnasium,
or —(perish forbid!) —the Stanford Pavilion!
