## 
### AL BRIDGES 
Campus intramural softball playoffs got under way Monday,
with two games scheduled. In the first, the undefeated Firehouse
and Theta Delta Chi teams met in an extra inning thriller and one
of the best games of the season, which the hose-house gang won,
1-0. Seven innings of tight softball were played without a score

by either team, while pitcher Bob
Anderson of the Theta Dolts and
Ned Wolfarth of the Firehouse re
tired opposing batters with little
trouble. Anderson allowed but 5
hits, two of which the Firehouse
team put together in the eighth in
ning for the lone, winning run.
Wolfarth gave up just 2 hits, chuck
ing in his usual deceptive, fast
curve style, and stacks up as a
hurler to watch in the final play
offs.
PHI KAPS DUMP FIJIS
Fiji and Phi Kappa Sigma started
a play-off of their tie for first in
League 111 play, but were rained
out after 3 innings with the Phi
Kappas on the long end of a 5-0
score. Yesterday the game was
completed when Phi Kappa loaded
the bases in the fifth and pushed
across one more run for a G-0 vic
tory and top spot in the league.
Winning pitcher Fred Smith pre
vented any second-day comeback of
his opponents by retiring the side
] -2-3 in the last three innings, and
displayed excellent control through
out to get deserved credit for the
win. Hurling for Fiji were Don
MacKellar and Cal Antrim.
House 214, with just one loss this
season to the Big Red Machine, cap
lured top spot in Village intramural
softball competition and as a result
will play the campus champs at the
Village ballpark on Friday for the
All-University championship. Spark
ed by the battery of fireball pitch
ers Dave Gardner and Clint Jones,
and catcher Ken Carey, House 214
had things pretty much their own
way all season. Also outstanding
were the outfield play and clutch
hitting of John Hills, 214's right
fielder.

Howard Preece and the consistent
hitting of Jack Reid, Sam Paine
and Chuck Maio, the Big Red Ma
chine made the first division after a
slow start by tieing for second spot
with the combined Houses 212-31R
sqund. Fastball hurler Frank Sed

wick and slugger Jack Pierce kept
212-316 in the running all season,
although Ihe team was handicapped
by too few players at times.
Third place also wound up in a
tie, with the lawyers of House 108
breaking even with House 310. The
lawyers boomed along in the first
division all season, but dropped
slightly with the last week illness
of pitcher Herb Becker. Sparkplugs
of 108 were Barney Favaro, Russ
Conley, Dave Lush and Mark Cali.
House 310, in and out all season,

big RKD comes back
Paced by the stellar pitching of
Howard Preece and the consistent
hitting of Jack Reid, Sam Paine
and Chuck Maio, the Big Red Ma
chine made the first division after a
slow start by tieing for second spot
with the combined Houses 212-31R
sqund. Fastball hurler Frank Sed

wick and slugger Jack Pierce kept
212-316 in the running all season,
although Ihe team was handicapped
by too few players at times.
Third place also wound up in a
tie, with the lawyers of House 108
breaking even with House 310. The
lawyers boomed along in the first
division all season, but dropped
slightly with the last week illness
of pitcher Herb Becker. Sparkplugs
of 108 were Barney Favaro, Russ
Conley, Dave Lush and Mark Cali.
House 310, in and out all season,
filled the first division and featured
the standout playing of Glen El
lingson and Paul Lentz.
Campus intramural softball playoffs got under way Monday,
with two games scheduled. In the first, the undefeated Firehouse
and Theta Delta Chi teams met in an extra inning thriller and one
of the best games of the season, which the hose-house gang won,
1-0. Seven innings of tight softball were played without a score

by either team, while pitcher Bob
Anderson of the Theta Dolts and
Ned Wolfarth of the Firehouse re
tired opposing batters with little
trouble. Anderson allowed but 5
hits, two of which the Firehouse
team put together in the eighth in
ning for the lone, winning run.
Wolfarth gave up just 2 hits, chuck
ing in his usual deceptive, fast
curve style, and stacks up as a
hurler to watch in the final play
offs.
PHI KAPS DUMP FIJIS
Fiji and Phi Kappa Sigma started
a play-off of their tie for first in
League 111 play, but were rained
out after 3 innings with the Phi

score. Yesterday the game was
completed when Phi Kappa loaded
the bases in the fifth and pushed
across one more run for a G-0 vic
tory and top spot in the league.
Winning pitcher Fred Smith pre
vented any second-day comeback of
his opponents by retiring the side
] -2-3 in the last three innings, and
displayed excellent control through
out to get deserved credit for the
win. Hurling for Fiji were Don
MacKellar and Cal Antrim.
