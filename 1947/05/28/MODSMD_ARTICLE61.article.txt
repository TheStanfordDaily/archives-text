# Oregon, OSU Grids Play '47 Games on Indian Soil
## 
### BILL HACHTEN 
(Editor's note: This is the fourth of a series of stories reviewing the
foothall prospects of the teams on Stanford's 1947 schedule.)

Next fall, Stanford will play Oregon State on November 1
and the University of Oregon on November 8. Fortunately, both
of these games will be played at Stanford, because the rain
soaked Oregon gridirons in November have long been a nemesis
to Stanford teams. In fact, Clark Shaughnessy's winning streak

was snapped in the bog of OSC's
Bel 1 Field in 1941.
At Corvallis, where Coach Lon
Stiner hud just completed spring
practice, they say that Oregon State
will be stronger than last year when
the Beavers finished second in the
P.C.C.
17 WILL BE TOUGHER;
However, they're going to find
things very much tougher for them
in 1947. They've been harder hit
than any other conference team by
graduation losses. Also, this year,
they've got to play USC in Los An
geles and Stanford at Palo Alto,
where dry fields will cut down the
effectiveness of Stiner's power sys
tem. And, in addition, they'll be
the team everyone in the Northwest
will be out to beat.
Like Stanford, OSC loses most
of its line but has its backfield in
tact. Bill Gray, their great center,
has'given up his last year of eligi
bility to play pro football. A tes
timonial to Gray's ability was made
by Washington Husky Coach Pest
Welch who recently said, "the best
news I've heard is that Bill Gray
won't be back next year." Also leav
ing are Ted Ossowski and Boyd
Clement, the regular tackles, and
Martin Chaves, first string guard.
Leo Gustafson and Bob Mclnnis,
halfbacks who went to the Rose Bowl
with OSC in 1942 are both graduat
ing, ioo.
The main reason for optimism is
a backfield which is very largely
the same as last year.
OPTIONAL PASS FEATURED
In Stiner's single wing system,
the basic play is an end run optional
pass play, run eith?r to the right
or left end. Right halfback Don
Samuel, who was the standout of
last year's team, is the good left
handed passer the system needs to
make this play work.
Dick Twenge, a freshman last
fall, is the necessary right-handed
left half. At fullback there's Ken
Carpenter, another freshman who
had a ball-carrying average of five
yars per try last year.
Standout on the Beaver line,
which is usually big and strong de
fensively, will probably be Paul

Evensen, a 240-pound bald-headed
guard, and Dick Lorenz, 210, a fine
end.
OREGON STARTS ALL OVER
With a new football coach and an
improved spirit, the University of
Oregon has hopes of a successful
1947 season. Jim Aiken, former
Nevada coach, is the new headman
and has installed a "T" formation
that heavily accents the passing
game.
Last year great things were ex
pected of Oregon's backfield of Jake
Leicht, Duke Iverson, Jimmy New
quist, and Bob Koch. It was a great
backfield by pre-war standards. But
a weak line and team dissension
rendered the quartette almost in
effective.
AIKEN FALLS lIEIR
Aiken has fallen heir to all of
that backfield except Duke Iverson,
in addition to an excellent "T"'
quarterback named Norm Van
Brocklin, a fine passer who was the
star of spring practice.
But Oregon's success is going to
depend on a line which is big and
experienced but uncertain. At cen
ter blond Brad Ecklund holds the
spotlight and is being groomed for
All-American honors by Northwest
sports writers.

P.C.C.
17 WILL BE TOUGHER;
However, they're going to find
things very much tougher for them
in 1947. They've been harder hit
than any other conference team by
graduation losses. Also, this year,
they've got to play USC in Los An
geles and Stanford at Palo Alto,
where dry fields will cut down the
effectiveness of Stiner's power sys
tem. And, in addition, they'll be
the team everyone in the Northwest
will be out to beat.
Like Stanford, OSC loses most
of its line but has its backfield in
tact. Bill Gray, their great center,
has'given up his last year of eligi
bility to play pro football. A tes
timonial to Gray's ability was made
by Washington Husky Coach Pest
Welch who recently said, "the best
news I've heard is that Bill Gray
won't be back next year." Also leav
ing are Ted Ossowski and Boyd
Clement, the regular tackles, and
Martin Chaves, first string guard.
Leo Gustafson and Bob Mclnnis,
halfbacks who went to the Rose Bowl
with OSC in 1942 are both graduat
ing, ioo.
The main reason for optimism is
a backfield which is very largely
the same as last year.
OPTIONAL PASS FEATURED
In Stiner's single wing system,
the basic play is an end run optional
pass play, run eith?r to the right
or left end. Right halfback Don
Samuel, who was the standout of
last year's team, is the good left
handed passer the system needs to
make this play work.
Dick Twenge, a freshman last
fall, is the necessary right-handed
left half. At fullback there's Ken
Carpenter, another freshman who
had a ball-carrying average of five
yars per try last year.
Standout on the Beaver line,
which is usually big and strong de
fensively, will probably be Paul

Evensen, a 240-pound bald-headed
guard, and Dick Lorenz, 210, a fine
end.
OREGON STARTS ALL OVER
With a new football coach and an
improved spirit, the University of
Oregon has hopes of a successful
1947 season. Jim Aiken, former
Nevada coach, is the new headman
and has installed a "T" formation
that heavily accents the passing
game.
Last year great things were ex
pected of Oregon's backfield of Jake
Leicht, Duke Iverson, Jimmy New
quist, and Bob Koch. It was a great
backfield by pre-war standards. But
a weak line and team dissension
rendered the quartette almost in
effective.
AIKEN FALLS lIEIR
Aiken has fallen heir to all of
that backfield except Duke Iverson,
in addition to an excellent "T"'
quarterback named Norm Van
Brocklin, a fine passer who was the
star of spring practice.
But Oregon's success is going to
depend on a line which is big and
experienced but uncertain. At cen
ter blond Brad Ecklund holds the
spotlight and is being groomed for
All-American honors by Northwest
sports writers.
(Editor's note: This is the fourth of a series of stories reviewing the
foothall prospects of the teams on Stanford's 1947 schedule.)

Next fall, Stanford will play Oregon State on November 1
and the University of Oregon on November 8. Fortunately, both
of these games will be played at Stanford, because the rain
soaked Oregon gridirons in November have long been a nemesis
to Stanford teams. In fact, Clark Shaughnessy's winning streak

was snapped in the bog of OSC's
Bel 1 Field in 1941.
At Corvallis, where Coach Lon
Stiner hud just completed spring
practice, they say that Oregon State
will be stronger than last year when
the Beavers finished second in the
