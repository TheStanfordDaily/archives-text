## 
### JACK VOOGD 
Coach David Tappan's rough-tough soccer players hold a
formal intrasquad scrimmage today at 4:15 on Maloney Field,
with the first-string backfield and second-string line teaming up
against the varsity line and JV backfield.
The Stanford soccer team has been having rough practice

sessions each Monday, Wednesday
and Friday this quarter, and is
shaping up as a real contender for
intercollegiate soccer next fall. The
practice sessions have shown to Tap
pan that he will have a faster, trick
ier and smarter eleven, capable of
capturing the league cup and aveng
ing last year's losses to USF and Cal.
Ten lettermen will return from
the l!)4(j team, among them Pat Mc-
Donnel, regular fullback, and Randy
Hudson, who is considered the best
goalie in the league. Both have
three years of eligibility left. Ri
cardo Trejos, unable to play in last
year's Cal game because of injur

ies, will probably lead the team in
individual scoring again at the cen- j
ter forward position.
Little Ara Galstaum, captain and 1
fastest man on the team, will hold
down one of the inside positions
while returning wing men Jerry
Taylor and K. S. Quan add experi
ence to the line. One of the most
promising newcomers is Stan Hodge,
an experienced player and an ac
curate, powerful goal kicker. Hodge 1
is slated to play the other inside
post.
Spectators are welcomed to the
game today, and no admission will j
be charged.
