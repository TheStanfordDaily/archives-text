Proposals for a Western College Congress,
similar to the Pacific Northwest College Con
gress held at Reed College recently, to be
sponsored by Stanford, were approved by
Excom last week.
The purpose of the Congress is to focus stu
dent attention on the problems of strengthen
ing world peace organization.
Delegates from 40 major colleges and uni
versities would gather to condense their best
ideas on international government and submit
them to our delegation to the United Nations.
Those persons backing the Congress have
done an outstanding job of planning and prep
aration. The plans have been set down on
paper in a very concrete manner after much

consultation with student leaders and admin
istration authorities.
Thus, we might assume, that the Congress
will go off without a hitch.
However, if that is to be the case, then these
factors must not be overlooked:
1. A very careful and warranted paring was
made of the proposed budget. Care must be
taken not to carry this paring to extremes.
2. Endorsement of the Congress by Excom
and other student leaders must be active and
complete.
3. Endorsement of the Congress by the Ad
ministration must be warm and active, not
just passive and tolerant.
Observation of these factors, plus what has
already been accomplished, will result in a
worthwhile and unbeatable Congress.
