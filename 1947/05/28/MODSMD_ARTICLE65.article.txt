This seems like a good time to start speculating—
again—on possible Republican Presidential nominees
for 1948. In a recent Gallup poll on the subject, the
rank and file were reported as favoring Gov. Thomas
E. Dewey, Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Harold Stassen,
Sen. Robert Taft, Sen. John W. Bricker, and Gov.
Earl Warren in that order.
' That puts Gov. Warren far down the list in sixth
place—but it is reported that he is "confident" that
he will be drafted for the job. On the face of it that
sounds silly—but wait a bit. It is entirely possible.
As he has been for several years, Tom Dewey is
(ho popular favorite among Republicans—those Re-

publicans, I mean, who give alle
giance to the party but who have
no say in its inner councils. But
Dewey is a defeated candidate; he
,had his chance in 1C44 and failed
miserably. That might not be so
bad, but he has enemies who have
•"great influence. He will have a lot
o f votes and the first ballot, but it
is doubtful that he can gain enough
to put him over the top.
Arthur Vandenberg is a poor

bet for another reason. He is very popular through
out the country right now, and he also is well liked
by most of the party big-wigs. But —and it's a very
large but—he has opposed the sanctimonious Taft
on many issues—and Taft is perhaps the strongest
Republican politician in the country today. Another
thing—many delegates who might otherwise vote for
Vandenberg will probably refrain from doing so be
cause of his age; he is nearly 70.
Next on the list is Harold Stassen, who I am sure
would be one of the most able Presidents in history.
He doesn't have a chance. His support would come
from the common people, and he could probably de
feat President Truman without any great effort—
but after Wendell Willkie virtually stole the nomina
tion in 1940 the denizens of the smoke-filled rooms
vowed never again to be caught by surprise. If
there is any man Taft is determined to stop, it is
Stassen—and he unfortunately has the power to do it.
Taft himself will not be nominated; if he is, Tru
man will beat him badly; if he wins, I'll move to

Mexico. Taft in relatively unpopular both with the
rank and tile and with the other Republican lead
ers —but he controls Ohio and he controls the South.
It might seem strange that a Republican owes his
strength to the South, but it's true. While no state
in the Solid South has gone Republican since Recon
struction days, they still send delegates to the con
vention and Taft has them all in his hip pocket. He
was even strong enough to get his own flunkey—Car
roll Recce, who rates mentally with Col. Bertie Mc-
Cormick—in as chairman of the Republican National
Committee. But even with all that power, I doubt
that lie can get the nomination; other leaders hate
him as much as he hates Stassen.
His brother Senator from Ohio, John Bricker, can
be disposed of in a very few words; he is overshad
owed by Taft. If Taft sees that he definitely cannot
get the nomination for himself, he'll probably switch
his power to Bricker—but Bricker himself is re
garded as just an ersatz Taft, so it's doubtful that he
could be successful as a compromise candidate.
That brings us down tn Earl Warren, who is known
to the nation only as the man who was able to win
the Governorship of California at the primaries. He
is respected as a vote-getter, but little more is
known of him in the East. However, he will prob
ably have a great deal of backing throughout the
Western states—and that will help.
The fact that he has no real national reputation
should react in his favor. He has no staunch and
powerful friends—but neither has he any mortal
enemies. Should a dogfight among the other five de
velop in which no one could swing the nomination
for himself, he holds all the trump cards. It is ex
tremely likely in the event that Tom Dewey fails
to grab the gonfalon in the early balloting.
Earl Warren made a rash gamble in 1944 when
he refused the Vice-Presidential nomination. Had
Dewey won, Warren would have been all washed up
as a Presidential candidate—but he guessed right,
Dewey lost, and now the Californian retains an out
side chance. He is one of three who I think could
beat Truman—the others are Dewey and Stassen.
Therefore—if a stalemate develops at the Republi
can Convention next year, a Native Son of the Golden
West may occupy the White House for the first time
in history.

Dewey lost, and now the Californian retains an out
side chance. He is one of three who I think could
beat Truman—the others are Dewey and Stassen.
Therefore—if a stalemate develops at the Republi
can Convention next year, a Native Son of the Golden
West may occupy the White House for the first time
in history.
This seems like a good time to start speculating—
again—on possible Republican Presidential nominees
for 1948. In a recent Gallup poll on the subject, the
rank and file were reported as favoring Gov. Thomas
E. Dewey, Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Harold Stassen,
Sen. Robert Taft, Sen. John W. Bricker, and Gov.
Earl Warren in that order.
' That puts Gov. Warren far down the list in sixth
place—but it is reported that he is "confident" that
he will be drafted for the job. On the face of it that
sounds silly—but wait a bit. It is entirely possible.
As he has been for several years, Tom Dewey is
(ho popular favorite among Republicans—those Re-

publicans, I mean, who give alle
giance to the party but who have
no say in its inner councils. But
Dewey is a defeated candidate; he
,had his chance in 1C44 and failed
miserably. That might not be so
bad, but he has enemies who have
•"great influence. He will have a lot
o f votes and the first ballot, but it
is doubtful that he can gain enough
to put him over the top.
Arthur Vandenberg is a poor

bet for another reason. He is very popular through
out the country right now, and he also is well liked
by most of the party big-wigs. But —and it's a very
large but—he has opposed the sanctimonious Taft
on many issues—and Taft is perhaps the strongest
Republican politician in the country today. Another
thing—many delegates who might otherwise vote for
Vandenberg will probably refrain from doing so be
cause of his age; he is nearly 70.
Next on the list is Harold Stassen, who I am sure
would be one of the most able Presidents in history.
He doesn't have a chance. His support would come
from the common people, and he could probably de
feat President Truman without any great effort—
but after Wendell Willkie virtually stole the nomina
tion in 1940 the denizens of the smoke-filled rooms
vowed never again to be caught by surprise. If
there is any man Taft is determined to stop, it is
Stassen—and he unfortunately has the power to do it.
Taft himself will not be nominated; if he is, Tru
man will beat him badly; if he wins, I'll move to

Mexico. Taft in relatively unpopular both with the
rank and tile and with the other Republican lead
ers —but he controls Ohio and he controls the South.
It might seem strange that a Republican owes his
strength to the South, but it's true. While no state
in the Solid South has gone Republican since Recon
struction days, they still send delegates to the con
vention and Taft has them all in his hip pocket. He
was even strong enough to get his own flunkey—Car
roll Recce, who rates mentally with Col. Bertie Mc-
Cormick—in as chairman of the Republican National
Committee. But even with all that power, I doubt
that lie can get the nomination; other leaders hate
him as much as he hates Stassen.
His brother Senator from Ohio, John Bricker, can
be disposed of in a very few words; he is overshad
owed by Taft. If Taft sees that he definitely cannot
get the nomination for himself, he'll probably switch
his power to Bricker—but Bricker himself is re
garded as just an ersatz Taft, so it's doubtful that he
could be successful as a compromise candidate.
That brings us down tn Earl Warren, who is known
to the nation only as the man who was able to win
the Governorship of California at the primaries. He
is respected as a vote-getter, but little more is
known of him in the East. However, he will prob
ably have a great deal of backing throughout the
Western states—and that will help.
The fact that he has no real national reputation
should react in his favor. He has no staunch and
powerful friends—but neither has he any mortal
enemies. Should a dogfight among the other five de
velop in which no one could swing the nomination
for himself, he holds all the trump cards. It is ex
tremely likely in the event that Tom Dewey fails
to grab the gonfalon in the early balloting.
Earl Warren made a rash gamble in 1944 when
he refused the Vice-Presidential nomination. Had
Dewey won, Warren would have been all washed up
as a Presidential candidate—but he guessed right,
Dewey lost, and now the Californian retains an out
side chance. He is one of three who I think could
beat Truman—the others are Dewey and Stassen.

for himself, he holds all the trump cards. It is ex
tremely likely in the event that Tom Dewey fails
to grab the gonfalon in the early balloting.
Earl Warren made a rash gamble in 1944 when
he refused the Vice-Presidential nomination. Had
Dewey won, Warren would have been all washed up
as a Presidential candidate—but he guessed right,
Dewey lost, and now the Californian retains an out
side chance. He is one of three who I think could
beat Truman—the others are Dewey and Stassen.
Therefore—if a stalemate develops at the Republi
can Convention next year, a Native Son of the Golden
West may occupy the White House for the first time
in history.
This seems like a good time to start speculating—
again—on possible Republican Presidential nominees
for 1948. In a recent Gallup poll on the subject, the
rank and file were reported as favoring Gov. Thomas
E. Dewey, Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Harold Stassen,
Sen. Robert Taft, Sen. John W. Bricker, and Gov.
Earl Warren in that order.
' That puts Gov. Warren far down the list in sixth
place—but it is reported that he is "confident" that
he will be drafted for the job. On the face of it that
sounds silly—but wait a bit. It is entirely possible.
As he has been for several years, Tom Dewey is
(ho popular favorite among Republicans—those Re-

publicans, I mean, who give alle
giance to the party but who have
no say in its inner councils. But
Dewey is a defeated candidate; he
,had his chance in 1C44 and failed
miserably. That might not be so
bad, but he has enemies who have
•"great influence. He will have a lot
o f votes and the first ballot, but it
is doubtful that he can gain enough
to put him over the top.
Arthur Vandenberg is a poor

bet for another reason. He is very popular through
out the country right now, and he also is well liked
by most of the party big-wigs. But —and it's a very
large but—he has opposed the sanctimonious Taft
on many issues—and Taft is perhaps the strongest
Republican politician in the country today. Another
thing—many delegates who might otherwise vote for
Vandenberg will probably refrain from doing so be
cause of his age; he is nearly 70.
Next on the list is Harold Stassen, who I am sure
would be one of the most able Presidents in history.
He doesn't have a chance. His support would come
from the common people, and he could probably de
feat President Truman without any great effort—
but after Wendell Willkie virtually stole the nomina
tion in 1940 the denizens of the smoke-filled rooms
vowed never again to be caught by surprise. If
there is any man Taft is determined to stop, it is
Stassen—and he unfortunately has the power to do it.
Taft himself will not be nominated; if he is, Tru
man will beat him badly; if he wins, I'll move to

Mexico. Taft in relatively unpopular both with the
rank and tile and with the other Republican lead
ers —but he controls Ohio and he controls the South.
It might seem strange that a Republican owes his
strength to the South, but it's true. While no state
in the Solid South has gone Republican since Recon
struction days, they still send delegates to the con
vention and Taft has them all in his hip pocket. He
was even strong enough to get his own flunkey—Car
roll Recce, who rates mentally with Col. Bertie Mc-
Cormick—in as chairman of the Republican National
Committee. But even with all that power, I doubt
that lie can get the nomination; other leaders hate
him as much as he hates Stassen.
His brother Senator from Ohio, John Bricker, can
be disposed of in a very few words; he is overshad
owed by Taft. If Taft sees that he definitely cannot
get the nomination for himself, he'll probably switch
his power to Bricker—but Bricker himself is re
garded as just an ersatz Taft, so it's doubtful that he
could be successful as a compromise candidate.
That brings us down tn Earl Warren, who is known
to the nation only as the man who was able to win
the Governorship of California at the primaries. He
is respected as a vote-getter, but little more is
known of him in the East. However, he will prob
ably have a great deal of backing throughout the
Western states—and that will help.
The fact that he has no real national reputation
should react in his favor. He has no staunch and
powerful friends—but neither has he any mortal
enemies. Should a dogfight among the other five de
velop in which no one could swing the nomination
for himself, he holds all the trump cards. It is ex
tremely likely in the event that Tom Dewey fails
to grab the gonfalon in the early balloting.
