To the Editor:
I sort of hate to bring this up just now, when of
course the graduating seniors arc all relaxed and
placid— not a thing to worry about—their good works
and good grades behind them, and the world waiting
with open arms. You can tell from their rested and
eager little faces that they know All Is Over and
that automatically they are soon to turn into alums.
Technically they are right. Even those—if any—
who have been Stanford "tourists" for four years (a
non-native daughter may infuse a slight trace of
condescension into that word?) will be alums. It's
not the business of us who stay here, who watch with
interest and sympathy and affection each year's wave
setting out to sea, to warn them that not all gradu
ates stay "Family." Like other kinds of belonging,
that state has to be earned.
Each graduate has to decide for himself or her
self whether to leave without a trace, like last year's
tourist; or to stay a son of Stanford or a daughter—
helpful, constructively critical, constructively loyal,
warmly close—devoted credits to their upbringing.
Saving their concerted screaming for the bleachers,
where it helps. Sending in their useful suggestions
(or bringing them) to quarters where they will count.
Spending their best thought on making Stanford
better, happier, more productive for those who fol
low them.
But I'd like to make one plea for the comfort and
convenience of us who Stay here, to all of them. Will
they please keep themselves up on the Record Bu
reau of the Alumni Office? Really please? It is our
Who's Who of all Stanford's children. (When they
each get into the big red Who's Who of the outside
world, they can relax.) Will they write in every time
they change their name and/or their address, list
there each nevtf job and new honor, check themselves
into a live and accurate file?
Pleasant people have charge of that file.—they
don't mind how often the records get added to. And
alums would be surprised how often inquiries about
them come to their university—quite often toward
their benefit if they could be found. As far as I
know (this hasn't been checked yet), there have
been no inquiries from sheriffs of Wyoming, seeking
high and low, and high and low.
If the new alums arc really too swamped them
selves. will they please delegate their mother, their
secretary—or their wife in case of th<> forgetful sex—
to take on the duty? None of those three deputies
will be thwarted by over-modesty in reporting the
wonderful things achieved by Stanford graduates, on
whom be the Peace.
As a by-product, it would keep us here continu
ally refreshed in our high pride in Stanford.

senior, that "if you read it in the Daily, it's the truth."
Of course we stay-at-homes always knew that.
To the Editor:
If the present Bull Sessioner, Tom Self, is now
pretending to be a drama critic as well as a wit and
a lady-killer, the Daily had better do a fast switch
on one of its strongest spots! Self's profound com
ments on the Spring Show, "It's a Deal," display
a knowledge of the theatre which proves that as a
drama critic he would make a good pottery-maker.
I believe that Mr. Self didn't enjoy the show for
the same reason that I wouldn't enjoy reading Plato's
"Republic" in Greek. I couldn't understand a word
of it. For the information of the Daily's Bull Slinger
"It's a Deal" is a satire on modern economy. It was
written by a member of Stanford's Graduate School
of Business who knows more about his subject and
about playwriting than Tom Self will ever know . . .
even if he breaks Methuselah's record.
The show was seen by a number of people who
know show biz backwards and forwards and the com
ment from them was: Excellent. Both the book and
the music are easily Broadway material. The char
acters are strongly delineated and the dialogue is as
polished as a new. red Ford. The part of the audience
that I contacted was more than thoroughly satisfied
with the production.
As to the Speech and Drama "regulars" taking
pains to stay away . . . put down that dctcctivc
magazine, Self, and read your cast list again. I sup
pose Newt Arnold, Hubert Hcffner, Bill Vorenburg,
George Eckstein, Fred Otto. Elaine Maltzman, Rollin
Buckman, Don ShefTcy, and Mary Cogswell—just to
name a few are not Speech and Drama "regulars."
Slander is not my hobby, nor is adverse criticism
something of which I am entirely ignorant.
Watch "It's a Deal," Mr. Self. Watch it closely!

P.S. No, I was not connected with the production
in any way.
To the Editor:
I fail to comprehend why you have been devoting
so much space to this discussion as to whether or not
Mr. Wallace should have been invited to speak at
Stanford. There are four good reasons why an in
vitation should not be issued:
1. This is an educational institution.
2. Stanford students are in their formative years.
Mr. Wallace might be right.
4. If you hear two sides of a controversy, how do
you know which one to believe?
I think that Dean Stalnaker's explanation put the
whole thing in a nutshell.

"It's a Deal" is a satire on modern economy. It was
written by a member of Stanford's Graduate School
of Business who knows more about his subject and
about playwriting than Tom Self will ever know . . .
even if he breaks Methuselah's record.
The show was seen by a number of people who
know show biz backwards and forwards and the com
ment from them was: Excellent. Both the book and
the music are easily Broadway material. The char
acters are strongly delineated and the dialogue is as
polished as a new. red Ford. The part of the audience
that I contacted was more than thoroughly satisfied
with the production.
As to the Speech and Drama "regulars" taking
pains to stay away . . . put down that dctcctivc
magazine, Self, and read your cast list again. I sup
pose Newt Arnold, Hubert Hcffner, Bill Vorenburg,
George Eckstein, Fred Otto. Elaine Maltzman, Rollin
Buckman, Don ShefTcy, and Mary Cogswell—just to
name a few are not Speech and Drama "regulars."
Slander is not my hobby, nor is adverse criticism
something of which I am entirely ignorant.
Watch "It's a Deal," Mr. Self. Watch it closely!

To the Editor:
I fail to comprehend why you have been devoting
so much space to this discussion as to whether or not
Mr. Wallace should have been invited to speak at
Stanford. There are four good reasons why an in
vitation should not be issued:
1. This is an educational institution.
2. Stanford students are in their formative years.
Mr. Wallace might be right.
4. If you hear two sides of a controversy, how do
you know which one to believe?
I think that Dean Stalnaker's explanation put the
whole thing in a nutshell.

To the Editor:
I sort of hate to bring this up just now, when of
course the graduating seniors arc all relaxed and
placid— not a thing to worry about—their good works
and good grades behind them, and the world waiting
with open arms. You can tell from their rested and
eager little faces that they know All Is Over and
that automatically they are soon to turn into alums.
Technically they are right. Even those—if any—
who have been Stanford "tourists" for four years (a
non-native daughter may infuse a slight trace of
condescension into that word?) will be alums. It's
not the business of us who stay here, who watch with
interest and sympathy and affection each year's wave
setting out to sea, to warn them that not all gradu
ates stay "Family." Like other kinds of belonging,
that state has to be earned.
Each graduate has to decide for himself or her
self whether to leave without a trace, like last year's
tourist; or to stay a son of Stanford or a daughter—
helpful, constructively critical, constructively loyal,
warmly close—devoted credits to their upbringing.
Saving their concerted screaming for the bleachers,
where it helps. Sending in their useful suggestions
(or bringing them) to quarters where they will count.
Spending their best thought on making Stanford
better, happier, more productive for those who fol
low them.
But I'd like to make one plea for the comfort and
convenience of us who Stay here, to all of them. Will
they please keep themselves up on the Record Bu
reau of the Alumni Office? Really please? It is our
Who's Who of all Stanford's children. (When they
each get into the big red Who's Who of the outside
world, they can relax.) Will they write in every time
they change their name and/or their address, list
there each nevtf job and new honor, check themselves
into a live and accurate file?
Pleasant people have charge of that file.—they
don't mind how often the records get added to. And
alums would be surprised how often inquiries about
them come to their university—quite often toward
their benefit if they could be found. As far as I
know (this hasn't been checked yet), there have
been no inquiries from sheriffs of Wyoming, seeking
high and low, and high and low.
If the new alums arc really too swamped them
selves. will they please delegate their mother, their
secretary—or their wife in case of th<> forgetful sex—
to take on the duty? None of those three deputies
will be thwarted by over-modesty in reporting the
wonderful things achieved by Stanford graduates, on
whom be the Peace.
As a by-product, it would keep us here continu
ally refreshed in our high pride in Stanford.

Pleasant people have charge of that file.—they
don't mind how often the records get added to. And
alums would be surprised how often inquiries about
them come to their university—quite often toward
their benefit if they could be found. As far as I
know (this hasn't been checked yet), there have
been no inquiries from sheriffs of Wyoming, seeking
high and low, and high and low.
If the new alums arc really too swamped them

secretary—or their wife in case of th<> forgetful sex—
to take on the duty? None of those three deputies
will be thwarted by over-modesty in reporting the
wonderful things achieved by Stanford graduates, on

senior, that "if you read it in the Daily, it's the truth."
Of course we stay-at-homes always knew that.
To the Editor:
If the present Bull Sessioner, Tom Self, is now
pretending to be a drama critic as well as a wit and
a lady-killer, the Daily had better do a fast switch
on one of its strongest spots! Self's profound com
ments on the Spring Show, "It's a Deal," display
a knowledge of the theatre which proves that as a
drama critic he would make a good pottery-maker.
I believe that Mr. Self didn't enjoy the show for
the same reason that I wouldn't enjoy reading Plato's
"Republic" in Greek. I couldn't understand a word
of it. For the information of the Daily's Bull Slinger
"It's a Deal" is a satire on modern economy. It was
written by a member of Stanford's Graduate School
of Business who knows more about his subject and
about playwriting than Tom Self will ever know . . .
even if he breaks Methuselah's record.
The show was seen by a number of people who
know show biz backwards and forwards and the com
ment from them was: Excellent. Both the book and
the music are easily Broadway material. The char
acters are strongly delineated and the dialogue is as
polished as a new. red Ford. The part of the audience
that I contacted was more than thoroughly satisfied
with the production.
As to the Speech and Drama "regulars" taking
pains to stay away . . . put down that dctcctivc
magazine, Self, and read your cast list again. I sup
pose Newt Arnold, Hubert Hcffner, Bill Vorenburg,
George Eckstein, Fred Otto. Elaine Maltzman, Rollin
Buckman, Don ShefTcy, and Mary Cogswell—just to
name a few are not Speech and Drama "regulars."
Slander is not my hobby, nor is adverse criticism
something of which I am entirely ignorant.
Watch "It's a Deal," Mr. Self. Watch it closely!

To the Editor:
I fail to comprehend why you have been devoting
so much space to this discussion as to whether or not
Mr. Wallace should have been invited to speak at
Stanford. There are four good reasons why an in
vitation should not be issued:
1. This is an educational institution.
2. Stanford students are in their formative years.
Mr. Wallace might be right.
4. If you hear two sides of a controversy, how do
you know which one to believe?
I think that Dean Stalnaker's explanation put the
whole thing in a nutshell.
Yours truly,

To the Editor:
I sort of hate to bring this up just now, when of
course the graduating seniors arc all relaxed and
placid— not a thing to worry about—their good works
and good grades behind them, and the world waiting
with open arms. You can tell from their rested and
eager little faces that they know All Is Over and
that automatically they are soon to turn into alums.
Technically they are right. Even those—if any—
who have been Stanford "tourists" for four years (a
non-native daughter may infuse a slight trace of
condescension into that word?) will be alums. It's
not the business of us who stay here, who watch with
interest and sympathy and affection each year's wave
setting out to sea, to warn them that not all gradu
ates stay "Family." Like other kinds of belonging,
that state has to be earned.
Each graduate has to decide for himself or her
self whether to leave without a trace, like last year's
tourist; or to stay a son of Stanford or a daughter—
helpful, constructively critical, constructively loyal,
warmly close—devoted credits to their upbringing.
Saving their concerted screaming for the bleachers,
where it helps. Sending in their useful suggestions
(or bringing them) to quarters where they will count.
Spending their best thought on making Stanford
better, happier, more productive for those who fol
low them.
But I'd like to make one plea for the comfort and
convenience of us who Stay here, to all of them. Will
they please keep themselves up on the Record Bu
reau of the Alumni Office? Really please? It is our
Who's Who of all Stanford's children. (When they
each get into the big red Who's Who of the outside
world, they can relax.) Will they write in every time
they change their name and/or their address, list
there each nevtf job and new honor, check themselves
into a live and accurate file?
