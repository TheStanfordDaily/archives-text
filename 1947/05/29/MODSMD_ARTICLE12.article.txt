# Chilean Graduate Needs Interpreter
## 
### 
Antonio Alcalde, a Chilean grad
uate student here, was planning to
get a lawyer to interpret the laws
for him, according to officers of the
California Highway Patrol, who cited
him for careless driving yesterday
after his car crashed into a truck
which had been in an accident a half
hour before.
The officers did not know whether
the student, who said he was con
nected with the Chilean government,
was entitled to diplomatic immunity
or not.
