# 'No South America Experts': Spaeth
## 
### 
"No one, not even South Ameri
cans themselves, can pretend to be
expert on South American affairs,"
stated Carl B. Spaeth, dean of the
Law School, in his Hispanic Scries
lecture, "Argentina and Her Neigh
bors," in Cubberley auditorium last
I night.
Dean Spaeth told a large, interest
ed audience that South Americans
I themselves were too bound by cen
| turics of hatreds to be unbiased, and
I that the. natural barriers of Andes,
jungle, and undeveloped interior
| prevented intercourse with each
J other to a certain extent.
Dean Spaeth has been affiliated
with the Venezuelan Development
| Company, quasi-observer at the
Havana Conference of Foreign Min
siters in 1940, counsel in the Office
of Co-ordinator of Inter-American
affairs, member of the American del
egation to the Rio Conference in
1942, representative on the Emer
gency Advisory Committee for Po
litical Defence, and Chief of the div
ision of River Platte affairs in the
State Department.
According to Dean Spaeth, the

United States made a grave error
when she took the leadership in
waiving Argentine compliance with
Western Hemisphere obligations be
fore being admitted into the United
Nations at the San Francisco Con
ference.
Dean Spaeth also said that, al
though Argentina has now done all
that was required of her to comply
with her obligations, he thinks that
President Truman's Hemisphere
Army Plan, to supply the Latin Am
erican nations with guns, tanks,
and airplanes, is a little incongru
ous with American policy to dis
courage dictators and dictatorships.
He says that rather than "winning
friends and influencing people" with
the military leaders the United
States should concentrate on the
workers in the essential Latin Am
erican industries.
"Arc we going to assist with arms
or better help by making available to
them American engineering, me
chanical, sanitation, and medical
genius?" was Dean Spaeth's con
cluding remark.
