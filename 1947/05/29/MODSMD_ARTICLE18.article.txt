# SIRO Needs Paper, Books

### 
"While cleaning out your belong
ings before going home this sum
mer, look for anything that might
be useful to send overseas. Sup
plies such as notebook paper, books,
pencils; in short, whatever would be
useful to a university student, will
be collected to send to the Univer
sity of Naples, the university adopt
ed by Stanford," said Bill Dirker,
co-chairman of the Stanford Inter
national Relief Organization.
The clothing collection boxes in
the residences will be turned in
light, after finals and the goods sent
to specific persons or to the Univer
sity of Naples as the house prefers.
People can still apply for the po
sition of head of the SIRO for the
summer quarter. The job entails
keeping the files of names of people
needing relief open for those houses
open during the summer to send
relief to them.
Anyone interested in the job
should come to the SI HO office on
the third floor of the Women's Club
house Friday afternoon from 12:30
to 1:30.
