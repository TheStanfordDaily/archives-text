# Ballot Theft Investigated

### 
WASHINGTON. May 28 (UP).—
Sen. James P. Kem, R., Mo., and
Attorney General Tom C. Clark
clashed angrily today over the out
come of an FBI inquiry into alleged
election frauds in Missouri, as a
Senate sub-committee indicated it
might join in the federal-state in
vestigation of wholesale thefts of
Kansas City ballots.
In a House speech, Rep. Albert L.
Reeves, R., Mo., said it was time
Congress did something about the
"fraud, violence and election thiev
ery which have characterized pri
mary and general elections in Kan
sas City for many years."
Clark ordered the FBI back into
the inquiry after safecrackers blew
open the vaults of Election Commis
sion offices in Kansas City early to
day and made off with valuable
records which had been used in a
grand jury inquiry into last year's
Missouri balloting. Clark was chief
witness before a Senate judiciary
committee today.
Chairman Homer Ferguson, R„
Mich, indicated the committee
might get into the vault-cracking
inquiry, along with the FBI and
Missouri officials, after a report of
the incident was telegraphed to
Kem.
