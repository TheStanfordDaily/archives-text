"The issue of the yearâ€”the June
Chappie" goes on sale Tuesday at
campus selling spots for 25 cents,
says Chaparral headquarters.
"Prepare yourself for the cold,
cruel world," says Editor F. Q.
Hewitt, "because that's the theme of
this tremendous issue." The Old
Boy even promises a sensational ex
pose of a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
Topped by a four-color cover by
ace artist Ray Jorgenson, the maga
zine will include cartoons, a center
photographic spread by Bob Rock
well, and good-for-the-giggles car
toons by Old Boy Hewitt and the
New Old Boy Jim Conner.
