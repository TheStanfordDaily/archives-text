# Housekeepers Add Farm Cheer
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Beta, Enema, and Roble mothers
can stop worrying about their sons
and daughters living in an atmos
phere of dust and disorder. Campus
maids and houseboys can't teach
them tidiness, but they can elimin
ate a coating or two of dust once a
week.
J. Kawaii is typical of the many
Row houseboys, having put in fifteen
full years picking up after the Beta
Theta Pis. He is so much a fixture
around the house that Kawaii's first
name has now passed into history,
though it is rumored that it is a
Japanese name of at least six syl
ables.
"Boy, is that guy a faithful work
er," one of the boys remarked, a
comment typical of the esteem in
which they hold Kawaii.
During his fifteen years in the
house, Kawaii has missed only one
day of work. On that day, a group
oi worried Betas set oul to find the
missing houseboy. Their search was
shortlived, for they found Kawaii
and his father sitting in their bro
ken-down car on Palm Drive, de
jection written all over their faces.
FAMOUS FABLE
The most famous fable concerning
Kawaii concerns the tearing down
of the old Beta House in 1937. Dur
ing this process the Beta House was
without stairs from the first to the
second floor. Old-timers recall see
ing Kawaii swinging each day on a
rope from floor to floor in perform
ance of his duties.
Kawaii's faithful service was in
terrupted in 1!)41 when he was or
dered to a concentration camp. It
was a sad day fur both the boys and
the houseboy. As a token of their
appreciation, the brothers gave him
a gold watch engraved "To J. Ka
waii from Beta Theta Pi."
Today both Kawaii and his gold
watch are back at the house putting
in the terrific schedule of 6 a.m. to
(j p.m. that has made him indispen
sible.
ROBLE HELPERS
Roble has its Mrs. Carter, Mrs.
Flannery and Mrs. Tashibama to
keep the 250 freshmen and sopho
mores in order. All the maids are, to
quote Miss Ethel White, Roble's
nurse and housekeeper, "just in love
with the girls."
Many of Roble maids provide just
a little touch of home for the girls
by bringing them flowers, or in some
cases, fruit.
Mrs. Carter, for instance, stayed
at home for a few months when her
son came back from the Navy, but
"got so lonesome for the tfirls" that
she had to return to her work.
Many humorous stories are circu
lating around Roble because of the
inability of the Japanese maids to
understand more than a few words
of English. They are a quiet, cheer
ful little group who knock timidly
on the doors, walk in wreathed in
smiles to announce, "Me cleene
rooms, OK?" Because their first
names are a mystery to the group,
they have been given such nick
names as "Brunhi de"and "Mabel."
ENCINA CUSTODIAN
Encina's custodian, as he has
tagged himself, is Peter "Pete"
Poulas. He has worked three years
at Encina, five at Toyon.
"I'm responsible for the build
ing," Pete said. "My boss he gives
orders to me, and me, I give them to
the maids."
Commenting on the freshman
boys, he said, "Weil, when they first
g"t here they're a little green, but
they're not bad at all after the third
quarter, just a nice bunch of kids."
'The rooms in Encina are not as
messy as has been reported, ac
cording to Pete. "They're pretty
clean, in fact, 'cause they throw ev
erything outside," he replied.
The recent, waterbagging isn't
troubling Pete too much either.
"But," he said, "when a new man
comes to work here, I tell him to
wear a-hat when lie goes outside."
"I'm here working for the principle
of the thing, not the money," said
Pete, landlord of three buildings.
"Even when you're 58 like me time
passes more quickly when you like
to work."
