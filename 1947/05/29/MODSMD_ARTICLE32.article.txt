# Art Exhibits Feature War, Social Satire
## 
### 
Two new exhibits opened in the
Stanford Art Gallery yesterday.
One is a group of pen and ink draw
ings by Dr. Richard Stark, instruc
tor in anatomy at Stanford, and the
other a display of prints on social
satire by Hogarth, Gillrey, and
Rowlandson, famous English artists
of the 18th century.
Dr. Stark's drawings include
sketches he made while in the hos
pital corps in Europe during the
war. These show buildings and
steeples of French villages, bombed
roads, and caricatures of soldiers
and Frenchmen.
One group of sketches shows
scenes in a hospital and the typical
attitudes of doctors and patients.
AMERICAN SKETCHES
The sketches made in America
are of waterfronts, farms, and
towns, from New Orleans to Cali
fornia. The drawings are free and
full of action.
Dr. Stark is a graduate fellow do
ing research in anatomy. He is leav
ing Stanford at the end of litis quar
ter for Cornell University, where he
will practice plastic surgery in the
hospital there. He has had several
showings of his art here and in San
ta Barbara, and has recently illus
trated the book of war poems, "He
Shall Speak Peace."
The exhibit of prints on 18th-cen
tury Europe shows the political sat
ire of Rowlandson and Gillrey, and
I lie satire on life itself of Hogarth.
NAPOLEONIC PRINTS
Rowlandson's prints especially
concern Napoleon: his family life,
wars, and exile. Others show con
ditions in England during the Na
poleonic wars and the effects of re
publican reform.
Gillrey's cartoons reflect bitter
ness on the French Revolution and
the sansculottes. But he also bur
lesques high officials and royalty in
European governments as well as
those in England.
Hogarth's drawings are on every
day people in everyday events. They
are satires on human nature and
teach a moral, showing innocence
turned to vice. Some of the stories
are told in a series of prints. Ho
garth is one of the first artists to
draw common people as they really
are.
Both exhibits will be shown un
til June 22.
