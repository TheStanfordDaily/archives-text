# Lloyd's Homerun Wins Game, 8-7
## 
### 
Lloyd Merriman's eleventh inning home run with none aboard
gave the Indian ball club a well-earned 8 to 7 victory over Santa
Clara yesterday to break the Indians' road jinx and keep them
well in the running for a third place finish in the C.1.8.A.
Pitchers Larry Wolf and Dave Dahle teamed up to scatter ten

Bronco hits, with Wolf starting the
game and Dahle relieving in the
sixth. From that point on, Dahle held
the hosts to but three hits and
struck out two as the Farm boys
went down to the wire for their
close victory.
Besides sewing up the game with
his decisive homer, Merriman
smashed out two other hits as Ward
Walkup and Ben Cardinalli teamed
up behind him to lead the Farm hit
ting attack.
WALKUP GETS FOUR
Walkup collected four hits in five
trips, while Cardinalli kept up his
slugging pace with a triple and a
double. In addition, Bob Peters and
George Sloat drove home two runs
apiece.
The lead changed hands four times
in the see-saw battle, with the
Broncos holding the high cards dur
ing most of the game. They held the
early lead, only to have the Indians
break it in the fifth, and then the
Broncs jumped into a three-run lead
in the sixth. The Indians tied up
the game again in the eighth and
went on to win it in the eleventh.
The Broncs scored once in each
of the first two innings only to have
the Indians break into the run col
umn in the fourth to make the score
1-2. In the fifth, the Cardinals scored
twice to go into a 3-2 lead, but the

Broncs came right back in their half
with a tally to make it 3-3.
BRONCS lIAVE BIG SIXTH
In the sixth, the Broncs started a
hitting attack which largely con
sisted of bouncing balls over the in
field's heads, and this, coupled with
two Farm errors, accounted for the
four runs they scored to go into a
7-4 lead.
The Indians narrowed the margin
with a run in the seventh, and then
in the eighth they scored three times
in a late rally which tied up the
ball game and sent it into extra in
nings when neither team could
break the deadlock in regulation
time.
Walkup, the second man up, sin
gled and Cardinalli came through
with a long double and went to third
on the right fielder's errors as Walk
up scored. Then Peters punched out
a single to right, scoring Cardinalli,
and on the first pitch to Dahle went
down and stole second. He came
home when Dahle lashed a ground
ball over first base, and the stage was
set for Merriman's climactic homer.
