# Card Netters In 8 to 1 Win
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity netters hit the
comeback trail yesterday afternoon
as they romped over Santa Clara's
Tennis squad, 8-1, in a last warmup
match before the Big Meet with Cal
on Saturday.
Bob Lewis celebrated his return
to the number one tennis rung by
downing Santa Clara's A 1 Martin,
6-0, 7-5, and by teaming up with
Kirke Mechem to beat Steve Herle
and Roy Oaks, 6-0, 6-1, in a well
played doubles match.
In other singles contest, Drew
Putty of Stanford dumped Roy
Oaks, 6-2, 8-6; Kirke Mechem de
feated Glenn Harris, 7-5, 6-3; Fred
Lewis dropped a three-set match to
Steve Herle of Santa Clara 8-6, 3-6,
6-2; Tom Huffman, up from the
Stanford JV team, downed Bob Mc-
Killop, 10-8, 6-3; and Lucien Bar
bour, also a promoted JV netter, beat
Jack Smith, 6-4, 6-2.
The Farm netmen swept the dou
bles matches. The team of Dave
Basham and Bob Rutledge, which
went undefeated on their recent
southland invasion of USC and
UCLA, were forced to three sets by
Bob McKillop and A 1 Martin before
they finally defeated their pesky
peninsula rivals, 6-4, 3-6, 8-6. Stan
fordites Ross Hughes and Drew Putty
had'no easier time, eventually win
ning from Glenn Harris and Ken
Burnes, 3-6, 8-6, 6-0.


808 LEWIS, number one Stan
ford singles player, is shown taking
a lusty backhand swing at the
ball during a recent practice
match. Bob easily won his matches
against Santa Clara yesterday to
pave the way for an 8-1 Indian
victory.
