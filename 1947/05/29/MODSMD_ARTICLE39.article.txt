# Michigan Has Great Team
## 
### 
Editor's note: This is the fifth in a series of stories reviewing the
prospects of teams on Stanford's football schedule.
After opening the season on September 27 against Idaho
here, Coach Marchie Schwartz takes his squad back to Ann Arbor
to open a home and home series with the University of Michigan
on October 4.
A victory would give the Indians a tremendous lift and the

momentum from it could easily
carry them through the conference
to Pasadena. Also, an intersectional
victory over the Big Nine would
give the badly maligned P.C.C.
some much needed prestige. Yes, a
win would be a nice thing—but af
ter seeing what the Wolverines are
going to have in '47 it doesn't look
like it's in the Cards.
In their last game in 1946, the Wol
verines defeated a strong Ohio State
team by 56 to 6. This was, inci
dentally, the same Ohio team that
overpowered USC 21 to 0. They say
that no college team and few pro
outfits could have stopped the Mich
igan passing-running attack that
day.

swept the Buckeyes (no small boys)
off the field. Right now you can tab
the Wolverines as favorites for the
1947 Big Nine Championship." And
here's the rub —Michigan is losing
only a few players from that team
by graduation.
CHAPPUIS SETS RECORD
Although Illinois won the Big
Nine title last year, Michigan led
the conference in both total offense
and defense. Bob Chappuis, Wolver
ine halfback, was the workhorse of
the Conference as he set a new rec
ord for total offense. He made 443
yards on 84 rushes and 596 on 64
passes to average 148.1 yards per
game.
TWO GREAT ENDS
Michigan has two fine Negro ends.
Len Ford is a six-four giant and Bob
Mann is a rabbit. Mann was the Big
Nine's leading pass receiver and
caught 18 passes for 284 yards, an
average of 22 while Ford averaged
20 yards on nine receptions. Against
Ohio each carried the ball twice on
end around plays for a total of 68
yards.
Michigan also had a real kicking
artist in Jim Brieske, their center,
who booted 22 out of 23 conversions
and a field goal.
All four of these players, Chap

puis, Mann, Ford, and Briekse, will
be back to form the nucleus of a
great squad which will rank with
Notre Dame as the leading team of
the nation.

prospects of teams on Stanford's football schedule.
After opening the season on September 27 against Idaho
here, Coach Marchie Schwartz takes his squad back to Ann Arbor
to open a home and home series with the University of Michigan
on October 4.
A victory would give the Indians a tremendous lift and the

momentum from it could easily
carry them through the conference
to Pasadena. Also, an intersectional
victory over the Big Nine would
give the badly maligned P.C.C.
some much needed prestige. Yes, a
win would be a nice thing—but af
ter seeing what the Wolverines are
going to have in '47 it doesn't look
like it's in the Cards.
In their last game in 1946, the Wol
verines defeated a strong Ohio State
team by 56 to 6. This was, inci
dentally, the same Ohio team that
overpowered USC 21 to 0. They say
that no college team and few pro
outfits could have stopped the Mich
igan passing-running attack that
day.

the teams of Harmon and Evashev
ski. Never did Crisler conceive a
more deceptive attack. I've never
seen so many receivers in the clear
and hit so consistently by the pass
ers. And their blocking all but
swept the Buckeyes (no small boys)
off the field. Right now you can tab
the Wolverines as favorites for the
1947 Big Nine Championship." And
here's the rub —Michigan is losing
only a few players from that team
by graduation.
CHAPPUIS SETS RECORD
Although Illinois won the Big
Nine title last year, Michigan led
the conference in both total offense
and defense. Bob Chappuis, Wolver
ine halfback, was the workhorse of
the Conference as he set a new rec
ord for total offense. He made 443
yards on 84 rushes and 596 on 64
passes to average 148.1 yards per
game.
TWO GREAT ENDS
Michigan has two fine Negro ends.
Len Ford is a six-four giant and Bob
Mann is a rabbit. Mann was the Big
Nine's leading pass receiver and
caught 18 passes for 284 yards, an
average of 22 while Ford averaged
20 yards on nine receptions. Against
Ohio each carried the ball twice on
end around plays for a total of 68
yards.
Michigan also had a real kicking
artist in Jim Brieske, their center,
who booted 22 out of 23 conversions
and a field goal.
All four of these players, Chap

puis, Mann, Ford, and Briekse, will
be back to form the nucleus of a
great squad which will rank with
Notre Dame as the leading team of
the nation.
