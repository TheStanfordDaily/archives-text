## KSU Deserves Our Support 
### 
KSU began operation on Jan. 6 of this year.
During its brief period of operation it has
shown that it deserves a permanent place on
the Stanford campus.
KSU is capable of operating without out
side support. It has already trained men for
responsible positions in the commercial radio
field. It has proven of great educational value
in conveying news and other worthwhile in
formation to the campus.
KSU is controlled by a student-faculty com
mittee called the Stanford Carrier Current
Radio Committee which is appointed by a
representative group of faculty members.
This committee, headed by Dr. Hubert C.
Heffner of the Speech and Drama department,
has shown an active interest in student admin
istration of the station. The actual policy of
the station is decided upon and carried out by
the students who manage KSU.
Bill Eilers in his capacity as station manager
during the formative stage of KSU has been
especially responsible for the valuable contri
bution that the station has made to the cam
pus.
KSU is capable of operating with nightly
costs of less than twenty-five dollars. The
money derived from advertising which KSU
can sell covers this overhead expense, covers
improvement costs, and would cover salaries

for which the members of the staff are now
contemplating asking.
During its early months of operating KSU
had 81 students working for it in various ca
pacities. The average weekly time spent by
these people on the station has been eight
hours. Some members of the staff have aver
aged in the neighborhood of 20 hours per
week.
One student who worked on KSU is now the
assistant chief engineer of the San Francisco
Chronicle's FM station. Other KSU staff
members are planning summer work on var
ious stations.
KSU is planning a complete summer
schedule.
An application is on hand from a neighbor
ing junior college to extend the broadcasts
to that campus, indicating the interest which
KSU has developed in this area.
Students now operating KSU are pleased
with the present system of operation. They
hope in the future to have a studio in the base
ment of the library and an expenditure for
new equipment.
KSU deserves the support of the student
body in their requests.
They have already shown that they can do
a good job.
Student support of their future plans will
allow them to do an even better job.â€”G.C.
