# BULL SESSION
## 
### WELLS KEDDIE 
Pardon my hacking cough and grass - stained
pants. I went to the Spring Sing last Friday with
my friend Lafe Moxon. I just couldn't treat the
Daily in an undignified fashion, so I sat directly
on the green, damp grass. I also started several im
promptu seventh - inning stretches — guess nobody
ever tells ants to stay out of pants.
Lafe was in his usual top-notch form. He was a
nervous wreck after Cubberley, Guthrie, and Hurl
burt Houses had finished "Cool Water." He claimed
there were at least five places where the soprano
solo of the "Water" echo was omitted. Lafe gets so
upset over little things like that.
There's one in every crowd like Moxon. When
one group of girls was drawing in that final breath
before bursting into song, he sneezed. It echoed
back and forth across the Amphitheater in a shocked
silence. He didn't even go up and apologize to the
ladies, either. Not satisfied with this, he thought he'd
try being funny. A serious-minded student carrying
a lantern (painted red, incidentally, for no apparent
reason) crossed our line of vision. Moxon stood right
up and yelled, "Here I am, Diogenes!" That is, he
meant to say that. It came out "Socrates" and no
body even snickered.
"Just shows you what a difference an education
makes," I said, referring to his slip of the lip.
"Yeah, makes 'em lose their sense of humor, the
snobs." (Lafe's mind doesn't always run in the nor
mal channels of thought.)
Lafe settled down to disagreeing with the judges.
He felt that the Sigma Chi "Sweetheart" song was

just about perfect. He said he didn't care which key
we wanted to argue about, it was all sweet and love
ly. He would have given first prize to the Sigma Nu
boys and their saxophone, too. ''Anyone who can
think up such a swell song, complete with gestures,
deserves the best," he claimed. He thought the tune,
though, was a little weak. "It'll never be popular,"
he said.
Halfway through the program, Lafe nudged me
and pointed to the man sitting next to him, saying,
"Let's call the Tenney Committee right away." It
seems the fellow, whose name was Henry Wallace or
Walsh or something like that, had shouted "Encore!"
after Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Tau Omega had
sung "Meadowland." "That's a Russian song, you
know," Lafe whispered. The guy got up and moved
quickly away, though, before we could grab him.
Lafe always talks too much.
One thing really bothered Moxon. He couldn't
understand how the freshman class of the Stanford
Medical School happened to have an encore all ready
when they won first prize. "I think that showed
overconfidence," he pointed out. Lafe also had an
other thought, something about free medical service
to the judges, which I didn't listen to long.
Lafe also felt that the judges were deliberately
fostering juvenile delinquency in giving third prize
to the Branner freshmen. "Those innocent young
girls shouldn't smoke at all—and here they are, win
ning flat fifties of cigarettes for singing."
Moxon borrowed a cigar from a liable freshman
and we went home.
