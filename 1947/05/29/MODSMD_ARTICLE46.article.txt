### DAN ENDSLEY 
Events of the past few months have been down
right discouraging to those of us who believe that
only a world federation along the lines of the po
litical organization here in the United States can save
our ever-shrinking world from chaos. Those such as
Sen. Taft and Col. Bertie McCormick who are in
active opposition to any such program -are only minor
irritants.
The important point is this: The United States has
a moral responsibility which it is ignoring; a moral
responsibility that extends from the President all the
way down to the lowliest citizen.
For instance, how can we ever justify in the eyes

of the world the recent action of a
South Carolina jury by which it set
free all the participants in the
lynching of a Negro? The Gov
ernor of the state was whole-heal't
edly behind the prosecution, which
had confessions from most of the
defendants. The judge expressly
forbade the attorney for the defense
to bring up the race question, but
that attorney deliberately flouted
the authority of the Court.

It was a gross miscarriage of justice which cannot
l)e rectified under our present legal system. The mat
ter is merely the most flagrant in a long line of such
atrocities, in the South and elsewhere. But the peo
ple across the seas read all these things; our ill
wishers abroad make sure that they get a big play
in the press. If you were, say, a Frenchman, would
you be willing to accept the leadership of a country
in which such things are allowed to happen?
Then there is the present Red-baiting drive in
which politicians and irresponsible newspaper chains
denounce all opponents as Communists. Is that very
different from the Russian system of calling all op
ponents Fascists? In any event, why should the Com
munist Party as such be outlawed in this country?
That puts the United States on the same plane with
Russia, which ruthlessly suppresses all opposition.
This gives them the chance to say, "Oho, America
talks of tolerance, but just see this tolerance in
action!"

The only result of suppression of Communists in
this country will be to drive them underground—
where they will be 10 times as dangerous. J. Edgar
Hoover —who has been accused of aspiring to head
a Gestapo—is afraid of this and says so. It is argued
that American Communists owe allegiance to Moscow
and are thus subversive. That, I believe, is true —
but our PRESENT laws are adequate guards against
them, IF ENFORCED.
There are many such points on which wc lower
ourselves in world estimation, but I'll bring up just
one more—the intention of the U.S. armed forces to
arm all Latin America with U.S. weapons. Vast sums
would be expended—and for what? You can't plow
ground with tanks, nor can you make steel with
rockets. The arms provided will quickly become
obsolescent, so that if another war comes the entire
task will have to be done over again.
How much better it would be to spend a like
amount for education, roads, communications, medi
cal advances in the nations to the south! Such things
are of immediate value in time of peace—and in war
the people would be healthier and better informed;
Latin America with better transportation and com
munications would be immediately accessible rather
than isolated as it is today—it would be much easier
to defend.
All of these things, I believe, are illustrations of
the well-known American reluctance to assume in
ternational responsibility of any sort, moral or oth
erwise. The reaction is not as great as after World
War I, but that does not mean it is not bad. The fu
ture of the world is imperiled by such an attitude.
It is perfectly natural to look at such things self
ishly, to preserve one's own interests —but in the
present case it is merely isolationism, which has been
proven a failure. The selfish thing to do is to enter
into world co-operation wholeheartedly; now that
the world is economically interdependent there is
no other road save to ruin. It should be obvious to
all, but apparently it isn't.
Perhaps the present attitude is merely a phase
which will be over by 1948. Now there is a Taft, an
O'Daniel, and a Bilbo for every Morse; let's hope that
situation will soon be reversed.

How much better it would be to spend a like
amount for education, roads, communications, medi
cal advances in the nations to the south! Such things
are of immediate value in time of peace—and in war
the people would be healthier and better informed;
Latin America with better transportation and com
munications would be immediately accessible rather
than isolated as it is today—it would be much easier
to defend.
All of these things, I believe, are illustrations of
the well-known American reluctance to assume in
ternational responsibility of any sort, moral or oth
erwise. The reaction is not as great as after World
War I, but that does not mean it is not bad. The fu
ture of the world is imperiled by such an attitude.
It is perfectly natural to look at such things self
ishly, to preserve one's own interests —but in the
present case it is merely isolationism, which has been
proven a failure. The selfish thing to do is to enter
into world co-operation wholeheartedly; now that
the world is economically interdependent there is
no other road save to ruin. It should be obvious to
all, but apparently it isn't.
Perhaps the present attitude is merely a phase
which will be over by 1948. Now there is a Taft, an
O'Daniel, and a Bilbo for every Morse; let's hope that
situation will soon be reversed.

Events of the past few months have been down
right discouraging to those of us who believe that
only a world federation along the lines of the po
litical organization here in the United States can save
our ever-shrinking world from chaos. Those such as
Sen. Taft and Col. Bertie McCormick who are in
active opposition to any such program -are only minor
irritants.
The important point is this: The United States has
a moral responsibility which it is ignoring; a moral
responsibility that extends from the President all the
way down to the lowliest citizen.
For instance, how can we ever justify in the eyes

of the world the recent action of a
South Carolina jury by which it set
free all the participants in the
lynching of a Negro? The Gov
ernor of the state was whole-heal't
edly behind the prosecution, which
had confessions from most of the
defendants. The judge expressly
forbade the attorney for the defense
to bring up the race question, but
that attorney deliberately flouted
the authority of the Court.

It was a gross miscarriage of justice which cannot
l)e rectified under our present legal system. The mat
ter is merely the most flagrant in a long line of such
atrocities, in the South and elsewhere. But the peo
ple across the seas read all these things; our ill
wishers abroad make sure that they get a big play
in the press. If you were, say, a Frenchman, would
you be willing to accept the leadership of a country
in which such things are allowed to happen?
Then there is the present Red-baiting drive in
which politicians and irresponsible newspaper chains
denounce all opponents as Communists. Is that very
different from the Russian system of calling all op
ponents Fascists? In any event, why should the Com
munist Party as such be outlawed in this country?
That puts the United States on the same plane with
Russia, which ruthlessly suppresses all opposition.
This gives them the chance to say, "Oho, America
talks of tolerance, but just see this tolerance in
action!"

The only result of suppression of Communists in
this country will be to drive them underground—
where they will be 10 times as dangerous. J. Edgar
Hoover —who has been accused of aspiring to head
a Gestapo—is afraid of this and says so. It is argued
that American Communists owe allegiance to Moscow
and are thus subversive. That, I believe, is true —
but our PRESENT laws are adequate guards against
them, IF ENFORCED.
There are many such points on which wc lower
ourselves in world estimation, but I'll bring up just
one more—the intention of the U.S. armed forces to
arm all Latin America with U.S. weapons. Vast sums
would be expended—and for what? You can't plow
ground with tanks, nor can you make steel with
rockets. The arms provided will quickly become
obsolescent, so that if another war comes the entire
task will have to be done over again.
How much better it would be to spend a like
amount for education, roads, communications, medi
cal advances in the nations to the south! Such things
are of immediate value in time of peace—and in war
