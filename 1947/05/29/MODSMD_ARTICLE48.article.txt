# 'Best Quad in Years' On Campus Monday
## 
### 
Monday the Farm will get a look
at the best all-around Quad since
those dim years before the war. Not
only is the book well done in the
best yearbook tradition, but there
are many sparks of originality that
make the annual a standout. The
pictures are excellent, the copy in
teresting, and the coverage com
plete.
Twenty years from now a look at
the full page color shots of typical
Quad scenes will bring a flood of
memories. The colors are clear and
true and there on a mere page of
paper stand the Memorial Church,
as it looks on Sunday mornings, En
cina as it looks most anytime, and
Lake Lagunita in all its spring
glory.
PHOTOGRAPHY EXCELLENT
The photography is excellent—the
action shots are outstanding. The
candid shots for the living groups
portray life only as it is in a Stan
ford house or dorm. The Encina
shots show the stuff '50 is made of.
A different technique of "bleeding"
the pictures out to the edge of the
page is used effectively throughout
giving the book that modern air.
Campus leaders appear "as you like
to remember them."
The sports pages show a great
deal of originality and imagination
in makeup. Lloyd Merriman, Ains
lee Bell, and Bob Anderson burst
through a glorious background of
red as Big Game stars and other
pigskin aces are appropriately dis
played. The coverage of both men's
and women's sports is complete.
Action shots of femme athletes are
well displayed.
A new feature this year is "Life,
Candidly, That Is." Full page spreads
on campus antics under such head
ings as "Reg," "Axe," "Dances,"
"Winter," "Quad," "Spring," and
"Dates" will be adequate illustration
and proof for the old "When I was
in college . . . . " tales in about
19G5.
"WE REMEMBER"
Not to be content with just pic
tures, the editorial staff of the 1947
Quad presents appropriate and clever
reading material to round out the
book. The one line nostalgic nar
rative, "We remember," that runs
across the bottom of the many senior
picture pages keeps the reader mov
ing from page to page and gives the
book continuity. The sports copy is
complete for each major and minor
sport.
The hard tan cover is good looking
and something special and a little
different in the way of yearbook

covers. It's a specially treated pic
ture of the familiar quad, but never
as seen by human eyes. The hu
morous cartoons on the inside end
sheets lend a spicy touch to the book.
All in all, the 1947 Quad shows that
it has kept abreast of a booming
campus in a post war era and has
come through with flying colors to
present a book that truly represents
Stanford, 1947.—Burnet.

memories. The colors are clear and
true and there on a mere page of
paper stand the Memorial Church,
as it looks on Sunday mornings, En
cina as it looks most anytime, and
Lake Lagunita in all its spring
glory.
PHOTOGRAPHY EXCELLENT
The photography is excellent—the
action shots are outstanding. The
candid shots for the living groups
portray life only as it is in a Stan
ford house or dorm. The Encina
shots show the stuff '50 is made of.
A different technique of "bleeding"
the pictures out to the edge of the
page is used effectively throughout
giving the book that modern air.
Campus leaders appear "as you like
to remember them."
The sports pages show a great
deal of originality and imagination
in makeup. Lloyd Merriman, Ains
lee Bell, and Bob Anderson burst
through a glorious background of
red as Big Game stars and other
pigskin aces are appropriately dis
played. The coverage of both men's
and women's sports is complete.
Action shots of femme athletes are
well displayed.
A new feature this year is "Life,
Candidly, That Is." Full page spreads
on campus antics under such head
ings as "Reg," "Axe," "Dances,"
"Winter," "Quad," "Spring," and
"Dates" will be adequate illustration
and proof for the old "When I was
in college . . . . " tales in about
19G5.
"WE REMEMBER"
Not to be content with just pic
tures, the editorial staff of the 1947
Quad presents appropriate and clever
reading material to round out the
book. The one line nostalgic nar
rative, "We remember," that runs
across the bottom of the many senior
picture pages keeps the reader mov
ing from page to page and gives the
book continuity. The sports copy is
complete for each major and minor
sport.
The hard tan cover is good looking
and something special and a little
different in the way of yearbook

covers. It's a specially treated pic
ture of the familiar quad, but never
as seen by human eyes. The hu
morous cartoons on the inside end
sheets lend a spicy touch to the book.
All in all, the 1947 Quad shows that
it has kept abreast of a booming
campus in a post war era and has
come through with flying colors to
present a book that truly represents
Stanford, 1947.—Burnet.
Monday the Farm will get a look
at the best all-around Quad since
those dim years before the war. Not
only is the book well done in the
best yearbook tradition, but there
are many sparks of originality that
make the annual a standout. The
pictures are excellent, the copy in
teresting, and the coverage com
plete.
Twenty years from now a look at
the full page color shots of typical
Quad scenes will bring a flood of
memories. The colors are clear and
true and there on a mere page of
paper stand the Memorial Church,
as it looks on Sunday mornings, En
cina as it looks most anytime, and
Lake Lagunita in all its spring
glory.
