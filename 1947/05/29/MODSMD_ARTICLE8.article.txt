# Fall Pre-Game Rally Planned
## 
### 
Plans for the first rally of fall
quarter, which will precede the
Idaho game, were started at Rally
Com meeting Monday night, Bar
bara Carter, co-chairman, stated.
Jean Burnet and Ted Sheridan were
put in charge of the rally, which
will be held Sept. 26, before regis
tration.
Rally Com plans to form a regular
rooting section at the Idaho game,
Sept. 27, and all students are urged
to wear white shirts or sweaters
and rooters' caps.

Spring or summer student body
cards will be necessary for admis
sion to the Idaho game, since fall
quarter will not have officially
begun, Miss Carter pointed out.

Plans were also made to conduct
a poll as to the desirability of a
new type of rooter's cap. The pro*-
posed cap has a visor and resem
bles a ski cap, Miss Carter said.
