# International Conference, College Congress Prepare For Next Year's Activities
## 
### 
Plans for the Conierence on International Relations to be held
next year have been announced by Mary Virginia Pond and
Cliff Nelson, co-chairmen of this year's conference.
The conference will probably be held winter quarter and the
Planning Committee hopes to secure a nationally prominent

personage as guest speaker.
A veterans' forum, more seminars,
and greater use of the round table
method are being planned. The
committee will try to have the con
ference extend over a longer period
of time, and stenographic reports
may be made of the entire confer
ence. If these reports are made, they
will be published so that students
who could not attend the conference
may read about it.
A" full report to the campus will
be made next fall at an open meet
ing, and all students who are in
terested will be able to serve on the
Planning Committee. Cliff Nelson
and part of the committee will set
up a constitution this summer.
Members of this year's Planning
Committee will meet tomorrow at
10 a.m. in the "Y" room of the
Women's Clubhouse to vote on new
officers and close the year's busi
ness.
The International Information In
stitute will schedule regular office
hours fall quarter and thereafter,
according to Alfred Munk, chair
man.
Students desiring information for
this summer should contact Eleanor
Elicl, travel; Lois Davidson, educa
tion; Mellon Shelton, jobs; and Li
selotte Hofmann, correspondence.
Stanford students knowing former
students or professors at universi
ties in Czechoslovakia, Austria, Po
land, Switzerland, and Italy arc

gress to be held at Stanford next
fall was passed by Excom Wednes
