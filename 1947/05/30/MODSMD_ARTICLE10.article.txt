Helen Schrader, instructor in
Speech and Drama spoke to Confer
ence on "How To Lead a Group
Discussion." Miss Schrader stated
that there arc two essential points in
leading a discussion: creative re
porting, and dynamic leadership.
LEADER INFORMS
The leader, she said, can act as a
"sort, of hyphen" between two
groups, taking information from one
to another so that the second group
will not only know the details of
the information, but will catch all
j the enthusiasm of the reporter.
Miss Schrader stressed several
methods of arousing interest in the
J group. "The leader must start," she
j said, "with a problem." Then causes
I of this problem must be found and
| discussed. The final objective, a

goal, must be clearly before the
group in order to assure effective
discussion.
ENTIIUSIASM CATCIIES
"Enthusiasm is catching," Miss
Schrader said, "it is not something
written in a book." To be sure that
the group catches this enthusiasm,
there must be successful organiza
tion of the planned discussion.
It is important, .she stressed, to
make sure that everyone expresses
his opinion, but that no one person
speaks too long. "The leader must
ask questions to get real answers,'
she said, and these questions must
be put in positive ways to get the
necessary answers.
The leader should be a creative
reporter. Miss Schrader believes, and
a dynamic discussion leader. In this
way he or she can make the group
I come alive.
