# US-Britain Unite Zones

### 
BERLIN, May 29 (UP). â€” The
United States and Britain today an
nounced the creation of an all-Ger
man Bizonal Economic Council, in
a sweeping move to get the two
western zones back on their feet,
despite Russian and French refusals
to bring their zones into an eco
nomic union covering the whole
Reich.
Many quarters interpreted the
plan as the beginning of a parlia
ment for the two zones and the first
flowering of German self-govern
ment above the state level since the
end of the war. But Lt. Gen. Sir
Brian Robertson, British deputy
military governor, who announced
creation of the council jointly with
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the American
military governor, said this was
not so.
He said the new council would be
neither the "shadow of a cabinet"
nor the "shadow of a parliament."
It will have representatives from all
the states in both zones, from among
whom will be selected an executive
committee. They will have the day
to-day responsibility of co-ordinat
ing the work of lesser economic
agencies in accordance with the
council's policies.
"The council isn't anything in the
nature of a decision to divide Ger
many," Robertson said in a press
conference.
