# Students Wanting Wallace Are Red 'Tools' Tenney Says
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
The Stanford students who sought
through the Institute of Interna
tional Relations to sponsor a cam
pus appearance of Henry Wallace
are tools of a Communist machine
that is constantly infiltrating into
every school in America, California
Stale Senator Jack B. Tepney de
clared in an interview with the
Stanford Daily yesterday in Sacra
mento.
"Without knowing one tiling about
it, I can tell you that much," he said.
Senator Tenney, who has led a
movement that has secured the pas
sage of several bills designed "to
stop the teaching of Communism in
California schools." has been chair
man of the Senate Committee on
Un-American Affairs for seven
years.
Senator Tenney warned that no
school in America is safe from tin*
forces (hat are trying to indoctrin
ate us with Marxist and Leninist
philosophies.
"The schools are a particular
danger spot," he said. "For the peo
ple who are the most valuable to
the Communists are the ones who
can understand the full impact of
revolutionary philosophy and preach
it effectively—the teachers."
"About Stanford? Yes wc have
had complaints. We get many com
plaints . . . from all over the state.
Of course there arc Stanford men
listed in our investigations of the
past ..."
(The following members, past and

I present, of the Stanford faculty
were named in the Committee report
for 15)47, some of them only as con
nected with left wing groups: Hol
land Roberts; J. W. Mcßain, chem
istry department; Harold Fisher,
Hoover War Library; Paul Eliel, In
dustrial Relations; Dr. Thomas Ad
dis, School of Medicine; Professor
Emeritus Edward Hulme, History
Department.)
"Our investigations and complaints
to this date do not include the ad
ministration of any school or de
partment as a whole at Stanford,"
Tcnney admitted, "but there are in
dividual men scattered here and
there .... you, the students, should
know who they are."
Senator Tcnney showed much
interest about student groups.at
Stanford. When asked what he
thought of the Stanford chapter of
the American Veterans Committee,
he said, "It's like all the rest of
the AVC, in the hip pocket of the
Communists."
When asked again about his pos
sible plans in the Stanford area, Srn
! ator Tcnney had little to say. "Ex
| cept for the men mentioned in the
| Committee records, which are down
in Los Angeles, Stanford has a clean
bill of health. Anyway, since we are
j supported by tax funds, we spend
! a majority of our time with the
; stale universities and junior colleges
where the taxpayers' interests are
[ directly at stake."
