# SIRO Plans Student Aid At U of Naples
## 
### 
Tentative plans have been made
for Stanford students to "adopt" a
student at the University of Naples
and carry on a correspondence as
well as send material relief to that
student, Molly Shaw, co-chairman
of th<3 Stanford International Relief
Organization, said today.
Collection boxes for old clothes
will lie placed in the corridors of
the main living groups Saturday
by Alpha Phi Omega, national
service fraternity of former Boy
Scouts, according to Dick Lentz,
chairman.
Students finding usable articles of
any sort when "cleaning out" before
summer moving are asked to donate
them for shipment to "Roughs" and
girls of the University of Naples.
School supplies as well as clothes
will be welcome. Collections will be
made June 11, and distributed
through regular relief organizations
or through the SIRO.
The list of students will be com
piled by Dr. Roberto B. Sangiorgi,
who plans to visit the Continent for
research on several books. He will
visit the president of the university
and contact the students themselves
in order to find out the actual condi
tions in the university. Miss Shaw,
who will be studying in Zurich this
summer, plans to visit Naples at the
same time and help with the list.
