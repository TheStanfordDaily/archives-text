# Indian Golfers In PCC Match
## 
### AL BRIDGES 
June 23 to 28 will be a memorable six days on the sports calen
dar, lor it is then that the annual main event of collegiate golf
takes the spotlight. This year, Ann Arbor, Michigan, has been
selected to receive the horde of competing golfers from colleges
all over the country. With five of the last six national team titles

hung on the Indian scalp rack, Stan
ford rates as the team to beat.
Also visible on that rack are 14
Bear scalps from the last 18 en
counters, as well as 10 team titles
and seven individual titles from 11
Pacific Coast Conference meets.
CARD TEAMWORK WINS
Although boasting of no phenom
enal individual stars, such as the
l&te Bud Brownell (who set the un
equaled Farm course record of 63)
or the redoubtable Lawson Little of
previous Card teams, the present
squad features all six men shooting
in the 70's. Such consistency has
kept the Indian sextet on top in the
last six nationals, as well as in coast
competition for 15 years.
Among other records, Stanford
holds the low team total of 580 for
the National Intercoilegiates, a rec
ord set in 15)41 against the runner-up
Louisiana State linksmen.
FARM GOLFERS FAVORED
This year, the strongest opposi
tion will probably come from Louisi
ana State, Princeton, Purdue, and
Duke—four of the best on eastern
fairways. However, none of these
teams should stop Coach Eddie
Twiggs' ace golfers from the seventh
straight win.
Prospects for next season are
dimmed slightly by the loss of three

varsity stars: Bob Cardinal, No. 3
man; Jack Shuler, No. 4; and Bob
Rosecrance, No. 5. Tom Lambie, Bob
Rosburg, and Erny Kellberg, runner
up in the Northern California Inter
collegiate meet last month, will be
back as the key men next year.
'48 OUTLOOK GOOI)
Bolstered by replacements from
the powerful J.V. squad, which re
cently swamped San Mateo J.C.,
23 1 / 2 - 3/j, Twiggs' Terrors should
continue their winning ways in '48.
Junior hopefuls Perry
Holmes and Bill Savage, as well as
Bob Crozier and Roy Moe are slated
by Coach Twiggs to plug the holes
left by graduation.

competition for 15 years.
Among other records, Stanford
holds the low team total of 580 for
the National Intercoilegiates, a rec
ord set in 15)41 against the runner-up
Louisiana State linksmen.
FARM GOLFERS FAVORED
This year, the strongest opposi
tion will probably come from Louisi
ana State, Princeton, Purdue, and
Duke—four of the best on eastern
fairways. However, none of these
teams should stop Coach Eddie
Twiggs' ace golfers from the seventh
straight win.
Prospects for next season are
dimmed slightly by the loss of three

varsity stars: Bob Cardinal, No. 3
man; Jack Shuler, No. 4; and Bob
Rosecrance, No. 5. Tom Lambie, Bob
Rosburg, and Erny Kellberg, runner
up in the Northern California Inter
collegiate meet last month, will be
back as the key men next year.
'48 OUTLOOK GOOI)
Bolstered by replacements from
the powerful J.V. squad, which re
cently swamped San Mateo J.C.,
23 1 / 2 - 3/j, Twiggs' Terrors should
continue their winning ways in '48.
Junior hopefuls Perry
Holmes and Bill Savage, as well as
Bob Crozier and Roy Moe are slated
by Coach Twiggs to plug the holes
left by graduation.

June 23 to 28 will be a memorable six days on the sports calen
dar, lor it is then that the annual main event of collegiate golf
takes the spotlight. This year, Ann Arbor, Michigan, has been
selected to receive the horde of competing golfers from colleges
all over the country. With five of the last six national team titles

hung on the Indian scalp rack, Stan
ford rates as the team to beat.
Also visible on that rack are 14
Bear scalps from the last 18 en
counters, as well as 10 team titles
and seven individual titles from 11
Pacific Coast Conference meets.
CARD TEAMWORK WINS
Although boasting of no phenom
enal individual stars, such as the
l&te Bud Brownell (who set the un
equaled Farm course record of 63)
or the redoubtable Lawson Little of
previous Card teams, the present
squad features all six men shooting
in the 70's. Such consistency has
kept the Indian sextet on top in the
last six nationals, as well as in coast
competition for 15 years.
