square off against a decidedly underdog Gutterball aggregation,
for the 1946-7 Village title. The Legal Eagles won the right to meet
the Gutterballs by edging the Hot Shots in the semi-finals and
the Biz Bums in the finals. The semi-final match between the

Eagles and the Hot Shots was close
all the way, with the Eagles coming
from behind to win only behind the
finest bowling seen on the Village
alleys this quarter. The Hot Shots,
captained by Herb Hawk, and paced
by Jim Harley, took the first game,
and were but one frame away from
victory, when the Eagles, led by S.
M. Hufstudler rose up and snatched
the game away, going on to win the
third and deciding contest, 2-1.
The other semi-final match found
the favored Wewonderifs, League
One titleholders, opposing the Biz
Bums, champs in League IV. The

game was the Wewonderifs' ball
