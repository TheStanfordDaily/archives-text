# Netmen Battle Cal
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
While Stanford sports interest turns to Berkeley and the Big Meet, the Indian tennis team will
entertain the stay-at-homes in a battle with California on the Farm courts. Tomorrow's net at
traction is listed for a 1:30 p.m. getaway.
As an added attraction, the Stanford Junior Varsity tennis team takes on the Cal Cubs in a
preliminary match starting at 10 a.m. The Indians will be out to erase an earlier defeat at the

hands of Cal's J.V.'s.
Tomorrow's varsity crucial with
the Bears will wind up a rather un
happy PCC schedule for the Indians
who have yet to enter the charmed
win-circle. Prospects for a victory
tomorrow have Farm tennis fans
talking about "next year" with more
conviction.
MYERS LEADS OFF
Ted Myers, who h'as been an un
predictable factor in the Farm net
fortunes this year, will lead off
against the Bears tomorrow as num
ber one man. In six trips to the
post, Ted has yet to capture a vic
tory although numerous times a last
set splurge could have won. Un
fortunately Myers has run up against
some of the roughest opponents on
the Pacific Coast—Al Larsen of
C.0.P., Gene Garrett of Cal, and
Arnie Saul of U.S.C.
Following up in the number two
slot tomorrow will be lanky Bob
Lewis who continues to give the
"name" net stars a rugged time
whenever they meet. Lewis led the
unsuccessful Indian attack against
the Bears earlier in the season, and
proceeded to clip top-ranking Bob
Borland, 6-2, 6-2.
FIRST MATCH CLOSE
In the early season Cal-Indian
battle, the advantage shifted back
and forth between the two teams in
every match. After an even split in
the six singles matches, the Bears
tucked away the victory by winning
two of the three doubles dogfights.
Five of the matches went the three
set distance, with the Bears gaining
the edge for the entire meet by
outlasting the Cards in three of the
marathons.
Coach Bugge expects to throw the
same lineup against the Bears that
battled the Bruins and Trojans on
the disastrous Southern road trip.
But last minute changes may shake
up the Indian lineup as Bugge

jockeys his players into position to
whip the Bears.
A new addition to the top three
Stanford positions is Drew Putty
who has developed into the Indians'
most consistent win producer. Put
ty has scored six victories against
only three defeats in collegiate com
petition this season. He will meet
rugged Bill Beale of the Bears, who
accounted for a Cal win in the ear
lier Indian-Bear match.
Bob Rutledge, number four man
against the Bears, will be playing his
last collegiate tennis after two years
of steady play for the Indians. Tab
bed as one of the best doubles men
in the Conference, Bob will join
with Dave Basham to play first dou
bles for the Indians against Cal.
In the important Junior Varsity
clash with the Bears, Stanford will

be putting the finishing touches on
a brilliant season. Tom Huffman
will play first singles for the JV's
tomorrow.
