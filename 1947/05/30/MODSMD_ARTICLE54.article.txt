# Mermen Head South To Conference Meet
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Coach Tom Haynie and fifteen members of Stanford's varsity
sv. imming team will entrain south today destined for tomorrow's
Pacific Coast Conference Southern Division Championship Meet
in the UCLA pool. The Indians, who are the defending champs,
w 11 be out to make it two PCC titles in a row since Farm swim-

mcrs returned to the water lanes
\uit spring after a two-year ab
sence during the war.
The meet figures to be strictly a
th ee-team struggle, with Stanford
an 1 Cal fighting it out for the team
championship, USC picking up what
points it can, and UCLA on the out
side looking in.
INDIANS FAVORED
With three or four potential point
getters in the back and breaststroke
events, as well as in the 100- and
22)-yard freestyle races, the Indians
look like a sure thing to repeat last
year's championship victory. Farm
: print star Bob Anderson, who is a
1 envy favorite to retain his 50- and
300 -yard freestyle titles, will be
I acked up in the hundred by Em
Caehin, Dick Narver, and Warren
Cutting, all of whom should figure
in the scoring.
With Cashin leading the way in
tie 220 freestyle event, Narver,
I.'alph Sala, and Jim Armstrong
should all add points to the Indian
1 ltd.
WFEDEN BROTHER ACT
Stanford's Weeden Brothers and
Harry Borchers will pretty much
dominate things. The same thing
holds true in the breaststroke event,
wiih PCC champion Hester, Klaas
801, and Martin Vitousek swimming
for the Card team.
Cal's main aquatic strength comes
in the diving, sprints, and distance
swimming fields, with 1946 PCC
ciiving champ and runner-up Jack
Lavery and Bill Keller, sprinter
Stan Morketter, and distanceman
Don Beanston as the best perform
ers.
The Golden Bears have a well
balanced squad, but the Cal team
is not given much of a chance to
overtake the power - laden Indian
squad unless the USC Trojans come
through at the right time to eat
into the Indians' precious supply of
cxpected points. The Troy squad
has, in breaststroker Hari-y Mes
senheimer and backstroker Rube
Wolfe, two men who might well do
that very thing.
EIGHT POINTS CONSOLATION
As far as the host school, UCLA,
is concerned, the meet will merely
take the form of an outside talent
show. Soundly beaten by all the
other Southern Division teams, and
with only a so-so record against
nediocre independent outfits, the
bruins just don't seem to have it
this year. If the Uclans pick up
any points besides the eight that
they will receive for merely finish
ing the two relay races, UCLA
swimming mentor Don Park should
consider it a moral victory.
Give or take a few counters, the
final score will probably read some
thing like: STANFORD 84, Califor
nia 50, USC 26, UCLA S.
PAT ON THE BACK
Upon returning to the Westwood
campus after a disastrous northern
invasion in which his team had
dropped a 63-12 decision to the
Stanford mermen. Bruin swimming
mentor Don Park told a reporter
that "at Palo Alto is the greatest
swimming team in the nation, and
in any dual meet the Indians would
come out on top." That is quite a
tribute for a rival coach to pay a
team, and it does just about describe
the team that undoubtedly is the
"greatest" in Stanford's long history
of great swimming teams.
Coach Park's statement "any dual
meet" is rather a broad one, how
ever, particularly when there are
teams in the country like the na
tional champion Ohio State squad,
or runner-up Michigan. But don't
get me wrong, for although Stan
ford's varsity might not beat Ohio
State should the two come together
under dual meet circumstances, the
Card swimmers could hold their
own with the national champs in a
good many events.
MEDLEY TEAM SHINES
The Stanford medley relay team,
for example, proved itself to be the
best in the nation when it chopped
nearly three seconds off the Uni
versity of Michigan's "rock bottom"
record of 2:51.1.
With the four best collegiate div
ers in the country, Coach Mike
Peppe's squad annexed 26 big diving
points in the Seattle NCAA meet,
but under the dual meet conditions
the Buckeyes could enter only two
divers in the single springboard
event, which would give Ohio State
only seven points to one for the
Indians.
Bob Anderson, who has consist
ently been under Buckeye Hilo Hi
rose's best times in the 50- and 100-

yard freestyle events, could more
than offset the Ohio State diving ad
vantage with a twin win in the
sprints. Western Conference breast
stroke champ Jim Councilman
would come nowhere near Em
Cashin's 2:21.9 mark for 200 yards,
and Stanford's PCC breaststroke
champ, Don Hester, should take
second in the same race.
