# Heaven Help the Foes Ofâ€” Washington and Maybe Cal

(Editor's note: This is the last in a series of stories l-eviewing the
football prospects of the teams on Stanford's 1947 schedule.)

CALIFORNIA
At Cal they've got a new coaching
staff, a new spirit, and the same
football team they had in 1946.
The new coach, Lynn Waldorf,
formerly with Northwestern, is the
fourth coach the Bears have had in
four years. When President Sproul
introduced him to the student body
he said, "Well, here's the coach for
THIS year!" However, Waldorf has
given indications that he'll have
more success than his predecessors.
He brought his own assistants with
him and conducted a very efficient
and businesslike spring practice.
And after spring practice he sent
his assistants out to "beat the
bushes" and try to interest high
school football players in furthering
their education at Cal.
NEW SPIRIT
The new spirit comes from a stu
dent body of 20.000 that wants a
winning team and a football squad
that doesn't intend to lose seven
games in 1947. The fact that most of
the team was out for rugby before
spring practice is indicative of this
changed attitude.
The same football team is just
that. Cal has its first two lines and
the same starting backfield that
played under Frank Wickhorst.
Waldorf apparently intends to use
the "T" formation and his big prob
lem is to find a good quarterback.
Bob Celeri, who played in 1944, is a
fine passer and was the standout of
the spring practice.
If the quarterback problem is
solved, the Bears should be able to
field a pretty good backfield with
Jackie Jensen and Bob Dal Porto
at the halfback positions and Jack
Swaner at fullback.
GOOI) TACKLES
The two tackles, Hank Borghi and
Jim Turner, are the strongest posi
tions on the line, and that's a good
place to be strong. Bobby Dodds
and Rod Franz will be the guards,
Harry Pieper the center, and Ken
Groefsema and John Cunningham
the ends.
And regardless of how many
games Cal loses next year, they're
still going to be tough for the Big
Game, because they learned last
year that that's one game you've
got to be ready for.

WASHINGTON
Up in Seattle they say that Wash
ington will be the strongest team in
the - Northwest, and will seriously
threaten California supremacy in
Coast Conference football. The rea
son for this optimism is a Husky
team which is shy only ONE regu
lar, Guard John Zeger, from its
1946 outfit. The other ten starters,
plus a raft of reserves, will all be
back.
Coach Pest Welch declares that
he has the best ends and centers in
the Conference. All Coast Dick Ha
gen, who was a standout in the
Shrine Game, and the other regular,
Gail Bruce, a steady end, are both
back.
MeGOVERN BACK
Center Gordy Berlin, who turned
in a good game for the West in the
Shrine game, is playing his fourth
year of varsity football. Bill Mc-
Govern, an excellent linebacker who
alternated with Berlin in '46, also
has another year of eligibility.
The Huskies have the same two
starting backfields they had on their
hot and cold '46 club. Dick Ottele
from Long Beach looks like their
best quarterback. He's not the
passer that Ainslie Bell is, but he's
experienced and a cool ball handler.
LAST YEAR'S CARD NEMESIS
Stanford fans will remember lit
tle Fred Provo, their break-away
runner, who had such a good day
against the Indians last fall. He's
back at left half and will be backed
up by Larry Hatch, an exceptional
pass catcher, either when receiving
or intercepting.
Hard running 200 pound Sam Rob
inson and Brooks Biddle, a fast and
tricky ball player, are rated about
even for right half. Marsh Dallas, the
195 pound regular from last year, is
back as is Stu Trask, the 1945
starter who was injured. And then
there's big Arnie Weinmeister, the
237 pound fullback who was injured
most of last season.
HUSKIES STRENGTHEN LINE
The guards will be George Mey
ers from last year and Alt' Hemstead
to replace the graduating Zeger.
Hemstead played quarterback last
fall but is being returned to guard
where he won All Coast honors in
1945.
