# INJUN BASEBALLERS FACE BEARS
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Coach Harry Wolter's revitalized diamond men come up to
their biggest —and last game of the season tomorrow afternoon
when they invade California's Edwards Field for a battle which
shapes up as the most bitterly contested affair they've encoun
tered all year. In addition to the varsity game, the Farm Jayvees

will journey to Berkeley to attempt
to win their first Cal game of the sea
son, a prospect which doesn't appear
too bright.
For both varsity teams, the Big
Game is the one that decides just
how they'll fare in the final CIBA
standings.
CHIPS DOWN
But entirely aside from that is the
fact that both the Bears and the
Indians are bristling for the game.
The Bears are seeking to maintain
their recent diamond supremacy
over the Farm and the Indians are
eager to score another triumph over
the Cal hosts and chalk up their
second straight Cal victory after
having gone winless in 17 straight
Big Games since 1939.
A look at their respective stand
ings in the conference might lead
onlookers to suppose that the Bears
rank as the favorites in tomorrow's
game. But those records are deceiv

ing, and not even the Bears can af
ford to rate the Indians as anything
but equal foes.
Dave Stott, Wolter's ace right
hander who has pitched the Farm to
four of its seven conference victo
ries, will unlimber 'his loose right
arm tomorrow as he starts in his
third Cal game of the year.
STOTT EVEN WITH BEARS
In April, the' Golden Bears just
barely nosed out Stott, 3 to 2, after
he had held them hitless for the
first six innings of the game. But he
came back three weeks ago to hand
cuff the Bear sluggers, but good, as
the Farm rolled to a 7 to 1 victory
to break the Cal victory string.
Against him, the Bears will throw
Jack Jensen—their late season ace,
Virg Butler, or Nino Barnise. Last
time, the Cardinals made short work
of Barnise and had some trouble
with Jensen's fast balls, so it just

will b? back on first.
Arce, if he is able to go, will han
dle the hot corner, but if he can't
make it, Wolter will use Ted Nell
again at that position.
However, Nell — the team's ace
utility man who has played regu
larly in the outfield, at second, and
at third this year—will more likely
be back in right field, his most fa
miliar position. If he does have to
play third, Clyde Dingfelder will
play right field again.
The other two outfielders, of
course, will be the Indians' slugger,
Lloyd Merriman, and George Sloat,
with Ward Walkup catching.
SWAN SONG FOR THREE
Tomorrow's game marks the end
of 3 long, up and down trail for the
Indians, but it also brings to a close
the collegiate careers of three In
dian stars.
Walkup, rated as the top receiver
of the conference, bar none, for his
hitting, fielding, throwing, and han
dling of pitchers, lias been one of
the brightest features of the Stan
ford squad this year.
That aggressiveness tag can be
slapped on Sloat, who ranks—along
with Merriman—as the top RBI men

might happen that the Cal board of
strategy may call on the burly Jen
sen to start tomorrow.
With Bill Arce still having trouble
with his ankle, the .starting Farm
lineup is somewhat indefinite, but
whichever of two combinations
Wolter uses, he can't help but come
up with a smooth-working crew.
PETERS AT SECOND
Bob Peters, with his aggressive,
heads - up ball which he played
against Santa Clara, has definitely
won back his second-base berth, and
will work with Captain Buck
Brownson, shortstop, around the
keystone sack.
Smiling Benny Cardinally who's
hit at least a double and a triple in
each of the last three Indian games,

on the squad, "Drag-bunt" Sloat
j could not only lay down sacrifices
| and beat them out for hits again
j and again, but he could also cross
j the opponents up with line drives
over second when the chips were
■ down.
| The Indians this year have been
a hot-and-cold outfit, but toward
the middle of the season they final
| ly started clicking and, despite a re
cent letdown, they've come back for
the final stretch finish with lots of
drive.
To date, they've chalked up 19
victories, lost 10, and tied one game,
and can point to one stretch in the
middle of the spring when they
rolled to 11 victories in 12 games.
They went into a road slump and
j dropped three in a row, one of them
lan amazing 20 to 2 rout by St.
Mary's. But last week they came
! back to score three wins in a row.
Thus, they've copped 14 out of
their last 18 games, a finish that in
l dicatos that they'll be a force to be
reckoned with next spring when
one of the toughest CIBA seasons
i starts with eight veteran —and all
good teams in the running.
