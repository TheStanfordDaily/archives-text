# Cardinals Hope For 'Big Meet' Win
## 
### 
A win over Cal Saturday would be just what the Doc ordered
for Coach Jack Weiershauser's track and field athletes in bright
ening up the season's performance, a guick check up of the
record book reveals.
The opening encounter of the year against the combined

colleges of Salinas, Stockton, Mo
desto, and Sacramento presented the
Indians their lone victory, 104 1 to
54'/.. Otis Chandler turned in the
best performance for Stanford,
breaking Jim Reynolds' freshman
shot put mark of 48 ft. 2Vi in. with
a 48 ft. 7% in. heave.
Heavy scoring in the field events
with a clean sweep in the discus and
first and secdnd in the javelin and
broad jump, enabled San Jose State's
Spartans to garner a 78-53 decision.
A tremendous sprint by Thelno
Knowles, the Spartans' long striding
half miler, sent George Grimes on
his parade of close defeats.
Although pre-meet dope sheets
had the contest strictly a toss-up, the
San Francisco Olympic Club turned
up with everything but the kitchen
sink and handed the Indians their
second loss, 74-57. Captain A 1 Sny
der gave die first indication of com
ing brilliance by taking the hurdle
races in 14,5 and 23.9.
Two Stanford graduate students,

Bub Lehman and "Mushy" Girard,
both competing for the Club, turned
in close wins over the' Farm's top
hall' miler and miler, Grimes and

Tomorrow's Big Meet will start
at 2 p.m. on Edwards Field, Ber
keley.

Frankie Ganahl, in the best races of
the day.
Del Russell in the high barriers
and Gordy Johnson in the long two
mile grind pulled the surprise of the
following meet as the two "un
knowns" scored the only Stanford
wins against the mighty Trojans of
USC. The Southland aggregation
was pointing for a 100 digit victory
but the final tally read, Troy 94j,
Stanford 36 !4. Mel Pat ton, sensa
tional Trojan sprinter, could only
manufacture times of 9.8 and 21.2 on
the supposedly fast strip of Angel 1

Field.
Terry Maxwell, the Farm's No, 1
dash man, finally cut loose down
at Westwood, zipping the JOO and
furlong in 9.9 and 21.1. Snyder
forced Bruin Craig Dixon, top rank
ing PCC hurdler, to go all out for
his double of the day. Again 100
little strength in the field proved
the Indians' downfall, so UCLA
77 2-3, Stanford 53 1-3.
Frank Held's brilliant 212 ft. 10
in. throw in the javelin to cop that
event in the Fresno Relays high

lighted a successful Indian perform
ance that saw Stanford take third
behind USC and UCLA. Held, who
entered Stanford under the assump
tion he was a pole vaulter, clinched
the Rice trophy for the track man
that shows the most improvement
during the season, with this gargan
tuan heave. A corking half mile
anchor lap in the two-mile relay by
Grimes aided teammates Ganahl, A 1
Holubar and Bernie Wagner to snare
the winning gold watches out of
USC's grasp.
