# Firehouse, Village 214 Contest for Softball Title
## 
### 
The rampaging Firehouse softball
| team reigns as campus champion
after a close 10-7 win over runner
up Sigma Chi yesterday, and will
meet the red hot House 214 squad
at 4 this afternoon at the Village for
the All-University Championship.
Sigma Chi got off to a slow start
yesterday, as Firehouse scored 2
runs on catcher Frank Pfyl's long
centerfield fly to take the lead in
the first inning. After retiring the
Greeks by the strikeout route in the
. second, the hose-gang combined 4

singles off pitcher Bob Slobe and an
overthrow at second to rack up 4
more runs.
However, with relief hurler Ralph
Jones on the mound, Sigma Chi held
Firehouse down while making a 5
run comeback of their own. In the
fourth, Jack Barry laced out a triple
to start a 3-run Firemen rally; but
Sigma Chi retaliated on Bob Slobe's
single for 2 much needed tallies to
close up the score at 9-7.
