# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Its Your Conscience Now 
### 
The occasion for having to write a final
editorial creates a mixed feeling of uncertainty
and helplessness. There has always been a
question in my mind as to just how much in
terest most students have in the termination
of one volume of the Daily and the beginning
of another.
Most of the factors connected with such an
event belong to the staff and are of no real
interest to the rest of the campus.
However, there are a few pertinent points
which should be of general interest as well as
of interest to the staff.
These points are directed mainly to George
and Martha and the rest of the staff, but I
believe they are also of concern to the rest
of the students and members of the Stanford
community.
First, the Daily is a community service
whose main purpose is to provide complete
and accurate news. You'll find this very dif
ficult to achieve because you are learning your
jobs while you are performing them.
Second, The Daily editorially should attempt
to lead and form student opinion, assist stu

dent government and the administration when
you believe them to be right, and at the same
time furnish that check upon student govern
ment which no constitution has ever been able
to provide.
This second function requires that you keep
completely informed on every campus activity.
And that isn't easy!
You will be criticized right and left for what
you say and do, but don't worry about it if
you believe your actions are constructive and
done in good faith.
Keep the Daily and oiher student activities
completely student controlled. The real bene
fits of the Daily and other student activities will
only be forthcoming if they are independently
handled by the students. This attitude carries
the responsibility, however, of continually try
ing to improve these activities.
And just to George and Martha: Don't ever
undersell your staff. The work that they have
done and the conditions under which they
have worked have proven them, to my mind,
to be the best bunch of guys and gals on the
campus.â€”Newt.
