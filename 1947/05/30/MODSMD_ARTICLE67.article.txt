# To the Women Students

### 
Just can't resist putting a few thoughts on
Stanford women's problems and activities in
to my last editorial for the Daily.
During the war, women showed their capa
bilities in conducting student affairs, but now
that the men are back, most of them do not
even know what's going on- Only the few
who do participate know that it's more inter
esting and fun to nelp out now than during
the war because there are so many more ac
tivities, and everything seems so much more
vital and important.
I'm glad, however, to see Women's Con
ference, the executive body of the women
students, made up of the president of each
house, becoming less of an announcement
board and more of a discussion and policy
forming group. I hope they'll work out their
ideas for getting women into campus inter
national activities.
I hope house presidents will become better
informed on all-campus guestions, so that
house meetings can be brought above the level

ol bickering over and planning functions of
concern only to the house, living area, or the
women students. House meetings are the
basic unit of our student government, and at
present they are the weakest point in the
system.
I hope that Excom representatives from wo
men's living areas will make a real effort to
inform their constituents of all the issues be
fore Excom, so that the students will have a
say in the decisions that are made, and Excom
will be kept more on its ioes.
I hope Roble sponsors will take their op
portunity of showing freshmen the way to get
into activities, and keep them informed.
I hope Housing Committee will be able to
work out a successful "get-acguainted" pro
gram for women and correct the split that has
developed between women's living areas.
Women need most of all to become informed
on all the issues, problems, and activities Stan
ford has. You can get participation and in
terest in an activity from people only when
they know what it's all about.—Nancy.
