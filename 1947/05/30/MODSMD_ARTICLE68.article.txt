Many of you no doubt recall Herb Caen's little
joke at the expense of "Uncle Don" Tresidder. That
is his frequent mention of the plush manner in which
the President "roughs it," particularly with reference
to a portable bathroom. Or was it a shower?
Albeit, there was once a weary traveler who was
glad to see the palatial Tresidder camp. He is Ax
Nelson, honorary member of the Stanford Alpine
Club. Ax had been walking all day, covering about
40 miles in all. through the Kern-Kaweah valley, one
of the prettiest spots in the Yosemite Park.
To him the Tresidder spread looked like a Pacific
Island beachhead. The party of five supported four
packers, a cook, and 15 animals.
The Tresidder hospitality was equally overwhelm

ing. Nelson was treated to a huge
Sunday dinner, including a special
dessert. Afterwards he was invited
to join in the hymn singing around
the camp fire. The cook even got
up early the next morning to start
Ax off with a hearty breakfast.
By horseback the Tresidder
party planned to reach civilization
in three days or thereabouts. So
they gave Nelson some letters to
mail as he was walking the same
distance in about eight hours.

Dan Endsley nearly cliscour-j
aged me from buying the latest

Chappie by showing me the Will and Shirley "joke.'
But we hacks have to stick together so I purchased
one anyhoo. It turned out to be a pretty good issue;
of course it was the exchange issue. But you've got

I
to give the Chappies credit., \hey know what's good
to borrow.
Speakfng of joke stealing, do you remember the
gag about Afton and Ronnie that excited Dan's ire
in Bull Session? Well, the "Unique," University of
Utah humor mag is so proud of that gag that they
wrote a nasty letter to Chaparral protesting that
they should have been given credit for the gag inas
much as it appeared in "Unique" seven years ago.
Chappie had credited the story to "Odorono.
Investigation by the Bull Sessioner has cleared
up the matter of original proprietorship of the gag.
Chappie got it from a three-year-old Odorono, who
stole it from a seven-year-old Unique, who purloined
it from a six-year-old Whiz Bang, who lifted it from
a four-year-old Chappie, who borrowed it from a
ten-year-old Pelican who snatched it from the 1898
Joe Miller Joke Book.

Journalism students must take the Strong Voca
tional Interest Test before they are admitted to the
Division of Journalism as a major student. On tak
ing the test recently, one of the Daily staffers dis
covered that he would be better at pottery making
than news writing. But he's not discouraged. At
present he is negotiating with a Navajo chief in New
Mexico to see if the chief will take him in under the
G.I. Bill. By the way, if you're around New Mexico,
look me up.
Just in case you don't read the sports pages, Farm
polo is a coed sport. When Lawson was shaken up
by a collision at the end of the first half in a Sun
day polo game, he was replaced by Lagunita's Rose
Marie Wallis. When she is not taking part in the
strenuous sport of polo, she is an economics-account
ing major.

Dan Endsley nearly cliscour-j
aged me from buying the latest

Chappie by showing me the Will and Shirley "joke.'
But we hacks have to stick together so I purchased
one anyhoo. It turned out to be a pretty good issue;
of course it was the exchange issue. But you've got

I
to give the Chappies credit., \hey know what's good
to borrow.
Speakfng of joke stealing, do you remember the
gag about Afton and Ronnie that excited Dan's ire
in Bull Session? Well, the "Unique," University of
Utah humor mag is so proud of that gag that they
wrote a nasty letter to Chaparral protesting that
they should have been given credit for the gag inas
much as it appeared in "Unique" seven years ago.
Chappie had credited the story to "Odorono.
Investigation by the Bull Sessioner has cleared
up the matter of original proprietorship of the gag.
Chappie got it from a three-year-old Odorono, who
stole it from a seven-year-old Unique, who purloined
it from a six-year-old Whiz Bang, who lifted it from
a four-year-old Chappie, who borrowed it from a
ten-year-old Pelican who snatched it from the 1898
Joe Miller Joke Book.

Journalism students must take the Strong Voca
tional Interest Test before they are admitted to the
Division of Journalism as a major student. On tak
ing the test recently, one of the Daily staffers dis
covered that he would be better at pottery making
than news writing. But he's not discouraged. At
present he is negotiating with a Navajo chief in New
Mexico to see if the chief will take him in under the
G.I. Bill. By the way, if you're around New Mexico,
look me up.
Just in case you don't read the sports pages, Farm
polo is a coed sport. When Lawson was shaken up
by a collision at the end of the first half in a Sun
day polo game, he was replaced by Lagunita's Rose
Marie Wallis. When she is not taking part in the
strenuous sport of polo, she is an economics-account
ing major.

Many of you no doubt recall Herb Caen's little
joke at the expense of "Uncle Don" Tresidder. That
is his frequent mention of the plush manner in which
the President "roughs it," particularly with reference
to a portable bathroom. Or was it a shower?
Albeit, there was once a weary traveler who was
glad to see the palatial Tresidder camp. He is Ax
Nelson, honorary member of the Stanford Alpine
Club. Ax had been walking all day, covering about
40 miles in all. through the Kern-Kaweah valley, one
of the prettiest spots in the Yosemite Park.
To him the Tresidder spread looked like a Pacific
Island beachhead. The party of five supported four
packers, a cook, and 15 animals.
The Tresidder hospitality was equally overwhelm

ing. Nelson was treated to a huge
Sunday dinner, including a special
dessert. Afterwards he was invited
to join in the hymn singing around
the camp fire. The cook even got
up early the next morning to start
Ax off with a hearty breakfast.
By horseback the Tresidder
party planned to reach civilization
in three days or thereabouts. So
they gave Nelson some letters to
mail as he was walking the same
distance in about eight hours.
