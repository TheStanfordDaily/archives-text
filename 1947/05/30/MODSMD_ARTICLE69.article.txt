To (ho Editor:
Since Henry Wallace has left the West Coast
there is now no "risk" of his accepting an invitation to
speak at Stanford. May we, then, have an answer
to the question three times asked in the Campus
Opinion department of The Daily?
These questions were:
(1) Is there a University policy excluding con
troversial figures from the Stanford rostrum which
was invoked in Mr. Wallace's case?
(2) What can we expect from such a policy (if
there be such) in the future?
As the Daily is to be printed only through this
week, these questions ought to be answered this
week, for otherwise, the impression will be left in stu
dent minds thnt there are no answers which can stand
publication.
Does the Daily have any opinion on this matter?
David C. Munford
(Editor's note: Dean John M. Stalnaker, chairman
of the Committee on Public Exercises, stated yester-

day that there is no University ruling which express
ly prohibits "controversial figures" from speaking on
the Stanford rostrum.
The committee's policy manual states that campus
assembly halls and grounds shall not be used for
"political or partisan addresses or gatherings." The
rules read further that a guest speaker cannot be a
candidate for office or a professional politician and
that public speeches at the University must be free
of propaganda or partisan presentation.
Dean Stalnaker explained that all requests for
addresses by speakers not connected with Stanford
must be given to the Committee on Public Exercises
by a student group or organization recognized by the
ASSU or President Tresidder. He stated that no
formal or written request answering this requirement
was made to the committee in the case of Henry
Wallace.
Wallace's name was not presented to the committee
as a possible guest speaker. Dean Stalnaker reported.)
