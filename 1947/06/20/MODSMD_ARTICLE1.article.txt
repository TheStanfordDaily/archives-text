Although President Truman is
playing it pretty close to the vest
on the Hartley-Taft labor bill, it's a
pretty safe bet that he'll be wear
ing his veto clothes when he sits
down for final consideration of the
matter. It's also a fairly safe bet
that Congress will pass it over his
veto.
That means —strikes, strikes, and
more strikes. Labor will not take
such a stringent act lying down. It
has taken the labor movement dec
ades to build itself up to its present
position of influence. Labor will not
shrug off the loss of that position in
a docile manner.
At the last session of Congress the
President vetoed the milder Case
bill and Congress accepted the veto.
But this is a different group of men,
with a different philosophy. They
almost succeeded in overriding Mr.
Truman's veto of their tax bill; al
ready angry, they should gather
more strength on the Hartley-Taft
act.
That is regrettable. Wiser and
cooler heads within the Republican
party—notably Sen. Wayne Morse of
Oregon—have counseled against any
rash legislation against labor, but
that counsel has been brushed aside.
It seems that management and
labor will remain one of our basic
problems. For many, many years
management had the upper hand,
and labor was downtrodden. Then
after 1933 the tables were turned —
but labor was not content with a
fair deal. It wanted a position of
dominance as great as management
had ever held.
Now the pendulum has swung
back again; labor's excesses have
turned the public against it, and
management has powerful friends
in Congress. It. in turn, is not will
ing to accept a square deal; it wants
a return to the ancien regime.
Such an attitude can breed noth
ing but industrial strife and chaos.
What is needed is leadership in
management that will agree that la
bor has rights, and carry on nego
tiations on that basis. What is need
ed is more temperate leadership—
men who will admit that manage
ment has its problems (not the least
of whictj is the necessity of making
a profit), and act accordingly.
That is only common sense, but
apparently it is Utopian for anybody
to advocate common sense these
days. Management and labor MUST
get together, must deal with each
other amicably and sensibly, but as
yet they have made no move to do
so—and Congress has been more a
hindrance than a help.
It was said of the old Bourbon
kings of France that they forgot
nothing and learned nothing. The
same phrase could be applied to
management and labor today—and
if BOTH sides don't soon see the
error of their ways and do some
thing about it, we will all be very,
very sorry.

had ever held.
Now the pendulum has swung
back again; labor's excesses have
turned the public against it, and
management has powerful friends
in Congress. It. in turn, is not will
ing to accept a square deal; it wants
a return to the ancien regime.
Such an attitude can breed noth
ing but industrial strife and chaos.
What is needed is leadership in
management that will agree that la
bor has rights, and carry on nego
tiations on that basis. What is need
ed is more temperate leadership—
men who will admit that manage
ment has its problems (not the least
of whictj is the necessity of making
a profit), and act accordingly.
That is only common sense, but
apparently it is Utopian for anybody
to advocate common sense these
days. Management and labor MUST
get together, must deal with each
other amicably and sensibly, but as
yet they have made no move to do
so—and Congress has been more a
hindrance than a help.
It was said of the old Bourbon
kings of France that they forgot
nothing and learned nothing. The
same phrase could be applied to
management and labor today—and
if BOTH sides don't soon see the
error of their ways and do some
thing about it, we will all be very,
very sorry.
Although President Truman is
playing it pretty close to the vest
on the Hartley-Taft labor bill, it's a
pretty safe bet that he'll be wear
ing his veto clothes when he sits
down for final consideration of the
matter. It's also a fairly safe bet
that Congress will pass it over his
veto.
That means —strikes, strikes, and
more strikes. Labor will not take
such a stringent act lying down. It
has taken the labor movement dec
ades to build itself up to its present
position of influence. Labor will not
shrug off the loss of that position in
a docile manner.
At the last session of Congress the
President vetoed the milder Case
bill and Congress accepted the veto.
But this is a different group of men,
with a different philosophy. They
almost succeeded in overriding Mr.
Truman's veto of their tax bill; al
ready angry, they should gather
more strength on the Hartley-Taft
act.
That is regrettable. Wiser and
cooler heads within the Republican
party—notably Sen. Wayne Morse of
Oregon—have counseled against any
rash legislation against labor, but
that counsel has been brushed aside.
It seems that management and
labor will remain one of our basic
problems. For many, many years
management had the upper hand,
and labor was downtrodden. Then
after 1933 the tables were turned —
but labor was not content with a
fair deal. It wanted a position of
dominance as great as management
had ever held.
Now the pendulum has swung
back again; labor's excesses have
turned the public against it, and
management has powerful friends
in Congress. It. in turn, is not will
