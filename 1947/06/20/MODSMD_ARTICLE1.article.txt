Although President Truman is
playing it pretty close to the vest
on the Hartley-Taft labor bill, it's a
pretty safe bet that he'll be wear
ing his veto clothes when he sits
down for final consideration of the
matter. It's also a fairly safe bet
that Congress will pass it over his
veto.
That means —strikes, strikes, and
more strikes. Labor will not take
such a stringent act lying down. It
has taken the labor movement dec
ades to build itself up to its present
position of influence. Labor will not
shrug off the loss of that position in
a docile manner.
At the last session of Congress the
President vetoed the milder Case
bill and Congress accepted the veto.
But this is a different group of men,
with a different philosophy. They
almost succeeded in overriding Mr.
Truman's veto of their tax bill; al

more strength on the Hartley-Taft
act.
That is regrettable. Wiser and
cooler heads within the Republican
party—notably Sen. Wayne Morse of
Oregon—have counseled against any
rash legislation against labor, but
that counsel has been brushed aside.
It seems that management and
labor will remain one of our basic

management had the upper hand,
and labor was downtrodden. Then
after 1933 the tables were turned —
but labor was not content with a
fair deal. It wanted a position of
dominance as great as management
had ever held.
Now the pendulum has swung
back again; labor's excesses have
turned the public against it, and
management has powerful friends
in Congress. It. in turn, is not will
ing to accept a square deal; it wants
a return to the ancien regime.
Such an attitude can breed noth
ing but industrial strife and chaos.
What is needed is leadership in
management that will agree that la
bor has rights, and carry on nego
tiations on that basis. What is need
ed is more temperate leadership—
