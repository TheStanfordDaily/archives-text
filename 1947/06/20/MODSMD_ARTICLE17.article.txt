# Bevin Blasts Russ Tactics

### 
LONDON, June 19 (UP).-For
eign Secretary Ernest Bevin, blaming
Russia for the division of Europe,
said in Commons tonight he was
convinced there was "a determina
tion to wipe out every opposition in
Eastern European Countries."
Warning the Communists that if
there had to be a conflict of political
ideologies in Hungary the Western
world "would not be the sufferers,"
Bevin said to the ringing cheers of
members of all parties:
"I have studied the efforts of so
many dictators to suppress liberty
in the world. Well, in the end it has
been the dictators who have failed."
It would be hypocritical to pre
tend that confidence among the Big
Three powers is unshaken "or that
true relations are unimpaired,"
Bevin said.
The idea of the one-party state, he

said, "is developing over a very
wide area in Eastern Europe, not by
desire but by force."
Pointing to the Communist grip on
Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bul
garia, Bevin said:
"Why blind ourselves to it?"
If "the tip were given that the
| civil war in Greece must stop," Bevin
j said—obviously referring to .Com
; munists in neighboring countries at
least—"then Greece would settle
j down and carry on her own political
burdens without interference."


ERNEST BEVIN. British For
eign Secretary, said move on foot
to make Hungary and Bulgaria
one-party states.
