WASHINGTON, June 19 (UP>.—
The Senate today overrode State De
partment objections and passed a
compromise bill which authorizes
either higher import fees or quota
restrictions on foreign wool to protect
American producers.
The roll call vote was 48 to 38,
! less than the two-thirds majority to
j nullify a veto.
The House already had approved
the act which now goes to the White
House and a probable presidential
veto.
It could be used to exclude up to
50 per cent of normal wool ship
! ments from abroad.

measure will undermine the Gen
eva International Trade Conference
and strike a body blow at the Ad
ministration's reciprocal trade pro
gram.
Administration economists say it
would end all hope of cheaper wool
en clothing prices in the early fu
ture.
