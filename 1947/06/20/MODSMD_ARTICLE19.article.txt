### 
JERUSALEM. June 19 (UP).—
Jamal el Husseini, acting chairman
of the Palestine Arab Higher Com
mittee, said today that United Na
tions partitioning of the Holy Land
into Jewish and Arab states would
mean a "three-year Anglo-Arab war
all over again."
If the United States tried to help
enforce a partition, he said. Pales
tine's Arabs would fight the Ameri
cans, too. He estimated it would take
nearly 100,000 United States troops
to protect oil lines and other Ameri
can properties in the Middle East.
Husseini said Palestine's 1,300.000
Arabs would fight partition "physi
cally, economically, socially and
alone—and we do not seek any help
from Soviet Russia."
"They are like the British in this
sense," he said.
He said Palestine could not sup
port a population greater than 2,000,-
000 now.
