# Senate OK's Rent Increase
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 19 (UP).—
The Senate today passed and sent to
President Truman a compromise bill
which opens the door for a 15 per
cent rent boost while extending rent
controls in modified form until March
1, 1948.
It was opposed bitterly by some
Republicans and most Democrats,
who immediately demanded Presi
dent Truman veto it and run the risk
of having all rent controls expire at
midnight June 30.
Democrats charged Republican
leaders deliberately stalled final ac
tion to force on the President a
take-it-or-leave-it decision. Both
proponents and opponents agree
that in case of a veto a substitute
could not be passed by June 30.
Opponents centered their fire on
a provision which would permit
landlords and tenants to enter into
voluntary agreements increasing
rents up to 15 percent if leases are
signed extending to Dec. 31, 1948.
F. H. La Guardia's National Fair
Rents Committee meantime de
scribed the bill as "better than no
rent control" and urged Mr. Truman
to sign it into law.
