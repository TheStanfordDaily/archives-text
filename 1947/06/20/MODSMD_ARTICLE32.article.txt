## Here We Go Again 
### 
Another Summer Session has rolled around, and we of The
:1 y have gone back to junior size, limited publication, and a
smaller circulation—but we will continue to serve our readers
to the best of our ability. For one thing, we will give a broader
coverage. By that we mean more news on what is happening
in the world outside of our Ivory Tower.
That hasn't been possible in the past. This is a school
paper, and—due to the newsprint situation —there has been
an acute shortage of space. Therefore we felt bound to play
up Campus happenings even when it meant the virtual ex
clusion of all other news.
But there will not be nearly as much happing on Campus
during the summer, so we will be able to print much more
international, national, and state news. There will also be a
Drama page, on which we will group all material relating to
the movies and the theatre, radio, literature, and so forth.
Perhaps it would be better to call it The Arts page.
We intend to give better coverage of the national sports
scene, too. Of necessity it will be more in the nature of a
digest—but it will serve to keep those informed who read
only The Daily.
Naturally we are anxious for your suggestions—and for
your criticisms, too. We can't give you what you want unless
we know what you want. Our Campus Opinion column is
open to all of you, and we will be only too happy to print all
the letters for which we have space—and we will print the
gripes right along with the pats on the back (if any).
Before we desist for the day, allow us one parting thought;
this is your paper—so don't hesitate to criticize. We are
yvorking for you.
