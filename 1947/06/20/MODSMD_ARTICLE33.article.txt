## Bull Session 
### 
The Stanford Daily has offended us more often than any other cam
pus outfit, so we might as well start throwing things around at home
before picking on anything else. This ought to tip you off that the
column is going to be terrible-tempered this summer, and why not? It's
easier to be mean than sunny, it generally makes better reading, and
it's liable to suck in a few sorehead letters that will furnish copy for
more columns. But don't think that all this belligerence has to be syn
thetic, because there's plenty in this county to get really tough about.
Anyway, if we take a look at what's been wrong with the Daily, we
ought to get some idea of what Bull Session isn't going to be. It's a
cinch it won't be the joke collection and personal diary other hands
have made it, and it won't operate in a world which begins at the Cellar
and ends at the History corner. Bull Session has always remained safely
on campus, and the Daily has made only a few timid adventures into
Palo Alto, the U.S. and the Balkans. Nobody has ever been able to
figure out the Daily's policy on outside news; there has been an equivo
cal pattern of attitudes. One notion has been that no student ever reads
any paper except the Daily, and so a Stanford baseball game on Friday
will be reported down to the last assist in Monday morning's Daily, even
though AP, UP and INS have spilled the story in every Bay Area sports
section on Saturday. It is assumed that everybody has waited breath
lessly for the Daily's banner on Monday morning, although anybody
could have picked up a Chronicle at the Cellar on Saturday.
The other attitude is that, well, maybe the students do read some
other paper after all, so if there's a riot in the Varsity Theater, the Daily
figures that everyone has read the story in the Palo Alto Times and
doesn't give it an inch. Or maybe the Daily has the idea that nobody
on campus gives a hang WHAT happens in Palo Alto, and this is prob
ably sound at that, but it seems that certain local stews and commotions
over the last year would have had some interest to the student body,
especially since many of them have homes, rooms or smokehouses in
the town. But the Daily never had a word about, say, the AFL strike
at Motley's, which finally spread to nearly every hash house in town.
Perhaps nobody in this progressive Republican stronghold ("we're all
PROGRESSIVE Republicans, you see") gave a damn about the strike,
but we'd say it would have made a good story for people who were
eating all their meals at these places—and EVERYBODY has Sunday
breakfast at Motley's. In the same way, the nonsense that this bird
Aaron Sargent ha.s been cooking up over the Children's Library should
have interested the student and faculty parents who send their kids
there, but the Daily must have felt that we were getting all the dope in
the Palo Alto Times. Whether that was straight dope or not is some
thing else, but there's a chance the Daily could have sniffed up some
news that the Times didn't fool with.
Well, we have a new editor and a new staff for the summer, and
maybe the management has some different ideas about running a news
paper. Mr. Endsley says he has, anyway, and it's certain he can do
no worse than the experts who have kept the Daily looking like a Colo
rado cattle weekly for the last nine months.

there, but the Daily must have felt that we were getting all the dope in
the Palo Alto Times. Whether that was straight dope or not is some
thing else, but there's a chance the Daily could have sniffed up some
news that the Times didn't fool with.
Well, we have a new editor and a new staff for the summer, and
maybe the management has some different ideas about running a news
paper. Mr. Endsley says he has, anyway, and it's certain he can do
no worse than the experts who have kept the Daily looking like a Colo
rado cattle weekly for the last nine months.
The Stanford Daily has offended us more often than any other cam
pus outfit, so we might as well start throwing things around at home
before picking on anything else. This ought to tip you off that the
column is going to be terrible-tempered this summer, and why not? It's
easier to be mean than sunny, it generally makes better reading, and
it's liable to suck in a few sorehead letters that will furnish copy for
more columns. But don't think that all this belligerence has to be syn
thetic, because there's plenty in this county to get really tough about.
Anyway, if we take a look at what's been wrong with the Daily, we
ought to get some idea of what Bull Session isn't going to be. It's a
cinch it won't be the joke collection and personal diary other hands
have made it, and it won't operate in a world which begins at the Cellar
and ends at the History corner. Bull Session has always remained safely
on campus, and the Daily has made only a few timid adventures into
Palo Alto, the U.S. and the Balkans. Nobody has ever been able to
figure out the Daily's policy on outside news; there has been an equivo
cal pattern of attitudes. One notion has been that no student ever reads
any paper except the Daily, and so a Stanford baseball game on Friday
will be reported down to the last assist in Monday morning's Daily, even
though AP, UP and INS have spilled the story in every Bay Area sports
section on Saturday. It is assumed that everybody has waited breath
lessly for the Daily's banner on Monday morning, although anybody
could have picked up a Chronicle at the Cellar on Saturday.
The other attitude is that, well, maybe the students do read some
other paper after all, so if there's a riot in the Varsity Theater, the Daily
figures that everyone has read the story in the Palo Alto Times and
doesn't give it an inch. Or maybe the Daily has the idea that nobody
on campus gives a hang WHAT happens in Palo Alto, and this is prob
ably sound at that, but it seems that certain local stews and commotions
over the last year would have had some interest to the student body,
especially since many of them have homes, rooms or smokehouses in
the town. But the Daily never had a word about, say, the AFL strike
at Motley's, which finally spread to nearly every hash house in town.
Perhaps nobody in this progressive Republican stronghold ("we're all
PROGRESSIVE Republicans, you see") gave a damn about the strike,
but we'd say it would have made a good story for people who were
eating all their meals at these places—and EVERYBODY has Sunday
breakfast at Motley's. In the same way, the nonsense that this bird
Aaron Sargent ha.s been cooking up over the Children's Library should
have interested the student and faculty parents who send their kids
there, but the Daily must have felt that we were getting all the dope in
the Palo Alto Times. Whether that was straight dope or not is some
thing else, but there's a chance the Daily could have sniffed up some
