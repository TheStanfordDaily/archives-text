SACRAMENTO, June 19 (UP).
—The Assembly tonight gave final
passage to a bill to outlaw juris
dictional strikes in California, but
defeated a companion bill to make
labor contracts more enforceable
in the courts.
The anti - jurisdictional strike
measure was passed, 49 to 28, after
labor-backed attempts to write a
"Lit tie Wagner Act" into it failed.
The bill now goes to the Senate
for concurrence in minor amend
ments, and will then go to Gover
nor Warren.
The anti-jurisdictional strike bill,
as passed, declares such strikes to
be unlawful and gives employers
the right to recover from the strik
ing unions for any damages in
curred.
The "Wagner Act" amendment,
offered by Assemblyman George
Miller (D., Richmond), was killed
when opponents objected that it
was not relevant to the subject of
the bill. The point of order was
upheld by Speaker Sam L. Col
lins over Miller's objections.
Miller's amendments were pat
terned directly on the National
Labor Relations Act, and would
have provided for' a State Labor
Board with powers similar to those
of the National Labor Relations
Board. Earlier, the lower house
put teeth back into the bill which
its supporters claimed were pulled
by the Assembly industrial rela
tions committee.
* * *
The highway bill as it ap
proached final Senate passage con
tained a lVa-cent increase in the
state gas tax. The feature was ex
pected to be rejected immediately
by the Assembly, which voted for
only a 1-cent raise.
Rejection by the Assembly of
the Senate's amendments will
throw the bill into a free confer

ence. A committee of three mem
bers from each house will have
three chances to propose an ac
ceptable compromise.

The State Senate late today con
firmed the controversial appoint
ments of Gilbert H. Jertberg of
Fresno and Joseph P. Loeb of Los
Angeles to the State Board of Ed
ucation. The confirmation vote had
been held up for nearly six months
on complaints that the two men,
with other members of the Board,
had agreed to the appointment of
a high school teacher with alleged
ly subversive beliefs, and had
adopted a supposedly pro-Russian
set of textbooks.
* * *
The Assembly today voted to
withdraw from its education com
mittee five of the so-called "Ten
ney Bills" designed to combat al
leged subversive influences in the
state's schools.
The bills had passed the Senate
on unanimous ix)ll calls, but had
been bottled up in the educational
committee of the lower house. To
day's action put them on the file
ready for a final Assembly vote to
morrow.
Under their terms school boards
could fire teachers for subversive
activities; the schools would be re
quired to teach American history
and other "fundamentals"; sex
courses could be taught only in
segregated classes by specially
qualified instructors; and the State
Board of Education could supply
schools with supplementary texts
only after they have basic texts in
the same subjects.
* * *
Tomorrow is technically the last
day of the 1947 session, but both
houses are expected to continue
their labors over the weekend by
the use of the legislative device of
"stopping the clocks."

ucation. The confirmation vote had
been held up for nearly six months
on complaints that the two men,
with other members of the Board,
had agreed to the appointment of
a high school teacher with alleged

adopted a supposedly pro-Russian
set of textbooks.

The Assembly today voted to
withdraw from its education com
mittee five of the so-called "Ten
ney Bills" designed to combat al
leged subversive influences in the
state's schools.
The bills had passed the Senate
on unanimous ix)ll calls, but had
been bottled up in the educational
committee of the lower house. To
day's action put them on the file
ready for a final Assembly vote to
morrow.
Under their terms school boards
could fire teachers for subversive
activities; the schools would be re
quired to teach American history
and other "fundamentals"; sex
courses could be taught only in
segregated classes by specially
qualified instructors; and the State
Board of Education could supply
schools with supplementary texts
only after they have basic texts in
the same subjects.

Tomorrow is technically the last
day of the 1947 session, but both

their labors over the weekend by
the use of the legislative device of
"stopping the clocks."
SACRAMENTO, June 19 (UP).
—The Assembly tonight gave final
passage to a bill to outlaw juris
dictional strikes in California, but
defeated a companion bill to make
labor contracts more enforceable
in the courts.
The anti - jurisdictional strike
measure was passed, 49 to 28, after
labor-backed attempts to write a
"Lit tie Wagner Act" into it failed.
The bill now goes to the Senate
for concurrence in minor amend
ments, and will then go to Gover
nor Warren.
The anti-jurisdictional strike bill,
as passed, declares such strikes to
be unlawful and gives employers
the right to recover from the strik
ing unions for any damages in
curred.
The "Wagner Act" amendment,
offered by Assemblyman George
Miller (D., Richmond), was killed
when opponents objected that it
was not relevant to the subject of
the bill. The point of order was
upheld by Speaker Sam L. Col
lins over Miller's objections.
Miller's amendments were pat
terned directly on the National
Labor Relations Act, and would
have provided for' a State Labor
Board with powers similar to those
of the National Labor Relations
Board. Earlier, the lower house
put teeth back into the bill which
its supporters claimed were pulled
by the Assembly industrial rela
tions committee.

The highway bill as it ap
proached final Senate passage con
tained a lVa-cent increase in the
state gas tax. The feature was ex
pected to be rejected immediately
by the Assembly, which voted for
only a 1-cent raise.
Rejection by the Assembly of
the Senate's amendments will
throw the bill into a free confer

ence. A committee of three mem
bers from each house will have
three chances to propose an ac
ceptable compromise.
