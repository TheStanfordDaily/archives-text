Dear Mr. Endsley:
This is the first time I have ever
written an editorial writer regard
ing his comments, but beint* a
Stanford man (Class of '25) and
having considerable regard for my
alma mater and its opinions, I feel
myself only justified in calling
your attention to a number of rash
remarks.
I do not know whether you are
one of these "inspired writers"
who "slants" his material for a set
objective or whether you are
purely trying to be sensational
without any attempt to give proper
information. Of course, if this is
true, then this letter is useless and
of no importance.
On the contrary, if you are in
terested in facts and if you do
represent the Stanford Daily
which, at least in my day, was
considered to be authoritative, I
do wish you would be more care
ful in what you say.
The following are inconsisten
cies and tend to create impressions
not altogether correct.
You say that Dewey "had his
chance in 1944 and failed miser
ably." I would suggest that you
check carefully the actual per
centage by which he was defeated
and when you do find what a small
percent that is, you will see that
"failed miserably" is hardly a cor
rect statement. You will also find
in 1948 how utterly incorrect that
assertion was. You do not qualify
your statement at all by giving
reasons for this defeat, but you do
make your personal feeling very
clear.
Your statements regarding Taft
show you are biased very thor
oughly and you give no crcdit
whatever for the statesmanship
displayed by Taft. I do not know
your sources of information nor
who your advisers are; but if you
do intend to become a political
writer for anything but the New
Republic magazine or Mr. Wal
lace's various communistic in
clined publications, I would sug
gest that you study your current
events more thoroughly.
In closing you state that a na
tive son of the Golden West may
occupy the White House for the
first time in history. May I inquire
just where you place a Stanford
alumnus by the name of Herbert
Hoover? Certainly he is a West
erner and was raised in California
as well as being educated there. I
feel quite sure he was President of
the United States.
Sincerely yours,
J. H. Hclser
