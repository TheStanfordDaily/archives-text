## Card Stunts 
### 
Among the various sports events
in which Cardinal athletes are slated
to compete these summer days, the
NCAA golf championship seems the
surest bet of producing an Indian
victory. But it won't be an easy
fight by any means.
Three sectional tillists will he
ready to hattle it out with Stan
ford University's defending team
champions in the I!M7 NCAA golf
tournament over tlie beautiful
University of Michigan course
from June 2:5 to 28. Princeton,
Texas, and Michigan, each winner
of its respective conference, will
be the leading challengers for the
crown won by the Farm golfers
in 1946.
Princeton, the Eastern intercolle
giate champions, will be led by Bill
Campbell, 6-foot 4-inch, 200-pound
driver, who is regarded by many as
one of the country's longest driving
amateurs and who is probably the
tallest entry in the 50th annual NC
AA meet.
The University of Texas Long
horns, perennial rulers of colle
giate golf in the Southwest, will
he led by slender Ed Hopkins, 11147
individual champion of his confer
ence and captain of the Longhorn
team that brought Texas its lath
title in 16 years this spring.
Michigan's Big Nine champions
are pinning their hopes on Ed Scha
lon, who tied as medalist with How
ard Baker of Ohio State in the Big
Nine title meet, and on captain Dave
Barclay and Johnny Jenswold, run
ner-up in the '44 and '45 individual
championships.
Our own Card team, which out
scored Michigan by five strokes to
win with a 61!) aggregate at
Princeton last year, is entering the
tournament with three of the four
entries who won the 1!)46 title.
This top flight trio upon whom the
hopes of the Farm arc resting in
cludes Hob Roshurg, Bob Cardi
nal, and Jack Schuler.
The other three Indian golfers of
the six-man entry, the four best
scores of which make up the team
score, are Rosy Rosencrance, Ernie
Kellberg, and Tom Lambie.
All considered, the defending
champions from Stanford can well
claim top odds in what might eas
ily turn out to be one of the
hottest golf fights in their experi
ence. But they are well prepared
by the expert tutelage of coach
Eddie Twiggs, and if the team
continues to play the kind of golf
that won them the PCC title this
spring, they are surely on their
May to defending the collegiate
golf crown successfully.
