# Two Cards Enter NCAA Trackfest
## 
### ART LEVINSON (Special to the Daily 
RAILROADING IT TO SALT LAKE ClTY—Stanford colors will
not be missing at the 26th N.C.A.A. track meet this weekend,
though the color scheme will lack an appropriate share of the
cardinal blend. The Indian entrants consist of George Grimes,
the half-miler, and Larry Hoff, the quarter-miler.

A 1 Snyder, fleet high-hurdler, was j
due to compete, but he turned the j
trip down, and Bud Hold, the 212- \
foot javelin man, is not entered be- j
cause his sore right arm has not j
healed properly.
On the basis of past times, neither
Farmster figures high in the dope
sheet ratings. But don't count too
much on these ratings; it's past
times that often make this rating
system so dopey. «
GRIMES MAY SURPRISE
George Grimes has been consist
ently good all season, with a time j
of 1:54.5 for the 880-yard distance
as his best. This time, however,
doesn't stand up very well in com- j
parison to other collegiate half- j
milers. Thelmo Knowles, Jim Slos- !
son, Bob Fletcher are just a few of j
the Pacific Coasters who have bet
ter times to their credit. But Grimes
is a good competitor, and he may
bang out a surprise performance j
with a place position. J

About the same goes for Larry
Hoff, the freshman trackman. His
best time for the quarter-mile dis
tance is :48.7 —flashy in itself, but
not as flashy when compared to oth
er quarter-miling college students
in the nation. Larry can't be count
ed out completely. His competitive
ability may carry him through for
a few Indian points.
LOTS OF COMPETITORS
This year's edition of the national
track carnival is about the classiest
in the history of the annual gather
ing. Seventy-four colleges have en
tered over 300 performers at the
Salt Lake City meeting. The "high
and flat city" is busting out with
trackmen.
An added incentive for competi
tion this year is the Olympic Games
of 1948. Olympic judges are taking
in the national collegiate event in
the hope of "getting a line" on out
standing performers for the Ameri
can delegation to the international
conclave, and no men want to be
left out. Getting an Olympic berth
is the greatest honor a trackman
hopes to achieve.
POST-WAR BEGINNING
Stanford's duet entrance is a far
cry from an era past when Dink
Templeton's underwear troupe was
the nation's scourge, but George
Grimes and Larry HofT do represent
a post-war start in Stanford's en
trance into national competition.
Accompanying the two Cardinal
performers is Jack Weiershauser,
track coach.

RAILROADING IT TO SALT LAKE ClTY—Stanford colors will
not be missing at the 26th N.C.A.A. track meet this weekend,
though the color scheme will lack an appropriate share of the
cardinal blend. The Indian entrants consist of George Grimes,
the half-miler, and Larry Hoff, the quarter-miler.

A 1 Snyder, fleet high-hurdler, was j
due to compete, but he turned the j
trip down, and Bud Hold, the 212- \
foot javelin man, is not entered be- j
cause his sore right arm has not j
healed properly.
On the basis of past times, neither
Farmster figures high in the dope
sheet ratings. But don't count too
much on these ratings; it's past
times that often make this rating
system so dopey. «
GRIMES MAY SURPRISE
George Grimes has been consist
ently good all season, with a time j
of 1:54.5 for the 880-yard distance
as his best. This time, however,
doesn't stand up very well in com- j
parison to other collegiate half- j
milers. Thelmo Knowles, Jim Slos- !
son, Bob Fletcher are just a few of j
the Pacific Coasters who have bet
ter times to their credit. But Grimes
is a good competitor, and he may
bang out a surprise performance j
with a place position. J

About the same goes for Larry
Hoff, the freshman trackman. His
best time for the quarter-mile dis
tance is :48.7 —flashy in itself, but
not as flashy when compared to oth
er quarter-miling college students
in the nation. Larry can't be count
ed out completely. His competitive
ability may carry him through for
a few Indian points.
LOTS OF COMPETITORS
This year's edition of the national
track carnival is about the classiest
in the history of the annual gather
ing. Seventy-four colleges have en
tered over 300 performers at the
Salt Lake City meeting. The "high
and flat city" is busting out with
trackmen.
An added incentive for competi
tion this year is the Olympic Games
of 1948. Olympic judges are taking
in the national collegiate event in
the hope of "getting a line" on out
standing performers for the Ameri
can delegation to the international
conclave, and no men want to be
left out. Getting an Olympic berth
is the greatest honor a trackman
hopes to achieve.
POST-WAR BEGINNING
Stanford's duet entrance is a far
cry from an era past when Dink
Templeton's underwear troupe was
the nation's scourge, but George
Grimes and Larry HofT do represent
a post-war start in Stanford's en
trance into national competition.
Accompanying the two Cardinal
performers is Jack Weiershauser,
track coach.
