# Grid-Cage Clinic Ends
## 
### 
The second annual Stanford Uni
versity football-basketball coaching
clinic ended Wednesday with an
outdoor demonstration of grid for
mations. Under the tutorship of
Gridmaster Marchie Schwartz and
Cage Coach Everett Dean, high
school and junior college coaches
from all over the state, 270 in all,
eagerly attended the clinic.
Wed nesday morning's session
was the climax of two and a half
days of an intensive examination
of the theory of coaching; basket
ball and football.
Scientific Everett Dean made a
visible impression on his pupils by
demonstrating each and every point
he made with two squads of present .
and past Card hoopsters. Among
them were Leon Lafaille, Howie
Dallmar, and Babe Higgins. Marchie
Schwartz was assisted by his entire
coaching staff and Indian players.
Schwartz was asked why he was
giving away all his secrets, and he
said:
We're glad to let them have
anything we know that might help
them. We believe in the kind of
co-operation they have in scien
tific research and in the business
world; as far as we're concerned,
nothing is secret—and that makes
us work that much harder to try
and stay ahead of the field. Be
sides, this does me as much good
as any of the people I'm teaching."
The important personages in Stan
ford's athletic picture are very well
satisfied with and hope to add other
sports to the program in future
years.
