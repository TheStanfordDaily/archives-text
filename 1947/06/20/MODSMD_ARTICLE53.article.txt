# Bostonians Reach Top In Leagues
## 
### 
NEW YORK, June 10 (UP).â€”
Idleness may be the devil's work- I
shop but you couldn't prove it today j
by the joyous Boston Red Sox and j
Braves who moved to the top of j
their respective pennant races just j
by sitting around and "chewing the j
fat."
It was a day in the old Back Bay
section that might even have ex- j
cited the late George Apley. For in
what must be practically the first 1
time since the Revolutionary War, i
both teams are out in front and ac- j
cording to the usually placid Bos- ,
tonians there is a reasonable expec- i
tancy that they will stay there.
The Braves backed into the Na- |
tional League lead when they were ;
rained out at Cincinnati and the Pi
rates drubbed the Giants at Pitts
burgh, 12 to 2. The Red Sox, who j
had an open date, took command in !
the American with help from the \
White Sox, who won a 6 to 4 deci- j
sion from the Yankees at New York. ;
However, the lead of both clubs was
insecure with the two New York \
teams only five percentage points !
behind in each league.
The long-suffering Pirates finally
turned the tables on the Giants with
a 16-hit collection that was led by !
Catcher Homer Howell who lashed .
four singles. Kirby Higbe. the last j
Pirate pitcher to go a full nine in- j
nings on May MO, finally did it
again, holding the Giants to eight
hits.
It was an unhappy reunion for
baseball's brother battery of Morton i
and Walker Cooper ot the Giants. '
Pitcher Morton, obtained last Sat
urday in a trade with the Braves, i
was batted out in the third inning ;
when the Pirates made four runs to
break a tie and go ahead G to 2.
Rudy York, also playing with new
teammates, led the White Sox to
their victory over the Yankees by
hitting his first homer since joining |
them after being traded from the ,
Red Sox.
