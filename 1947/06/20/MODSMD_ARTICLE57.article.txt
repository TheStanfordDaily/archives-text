# Farm Students Sail June 30 From New York
## 
### 
Bill Farrer and Lawrence Grannis,
Stanford law students, will sail from
New York June 30 for Europe where
they will survey foreign universi
ties and colleges. Each student was
given $1,100 for the trip, financed by
the Stanford student body.
"We hope to bring back a first
hand report that will further Stan
ford students' interest in interna
tional affairs," said Farrer. "It is
amazing how the trend among stu
dents relatively comfortable here is
toward isolationism. We feel our
trip not only will broaden local in
terests but will foster democracy
abroad."
Sixty Pacific Coast schools expect
to use these students' reports to set
up programs for exchange scholar-'
ships and foreign relief. Stanford
has already appropriated $4,000 for
supplies at the University of Naples.
Also, the student body has granted
$5,000 for exchange scholarships for
two foreign students.
Farrer will cover Italy, Switzer
land, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and
possibly Germany. Grannis will go
to France, Belgium, and Holland.


BILL FARRER leaves New
York June 30 to attend the World
Youth Conference in Prague.


LAWRENCE GRANNIS, Stan
ford law student, will visit the
Lowlands and France this sum
mer.
