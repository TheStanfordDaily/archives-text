# National Colloid Symposium Honors McBain for Outstanding Research
## 
### 
Approximately 200 chemists from
all parts of the country will close
their 21st National Colloid Sympo
sium at Stanford today. The three
day session that began Wednesday
is sponsored jointly by the Ameri
can Chemical Society's Division of
Colloid Chemistry and the Colloid
Committee of the National Research
Council.
This year's meeting honors Dr.
James W. Mcßain, Stanford chem
istry professor, and his group of
collaborators for their outstanding
work in solubilization and colloidal
electrolytes.

Dr. Mcßain will join emeritus
faculty ranks at the close of the
academic year in August.
Chemists will report recent ad
vances in the study of the behavior
of colloidal substances. These sub
stances are particles larger than
simple molecules but still so small
that most of them cannot be seen
under an ordinary microscope.
Other Stanford men who will pre
sent technical papers are Alexander
Kaminski, Arthur G. Wilder, Eric
Hutchinson, R. C. Chandler, and S.
S. Marsden, Jr.
