# GI Accounts Close Early
## 
### 
Veterans' credit cards will expire
one month from the beginning of
the quarter, D. I. McFadden, chief
accounting officer, has announced.
The early expiration date is neces
sary because the vouchering for
4,000 veterans' books, supplies, and
equipment is such a tremendous job.
Special purchases after the one
month period may be made, with
the approval of the veterans' co-or
dinator, George Barahal, if the cir
cumstances are beyond the control
of the student. Credit cards will be
issued to those who enroll late in
special courses, and thesis typing
and other expenses running through
the quarter will be allowed as be
fore.
The Bookstore will accept charges
for books during this first month
even though delivery is not possible
until later.
