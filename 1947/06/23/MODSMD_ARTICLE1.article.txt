# Newsmen Ask For Unity On Home Front
## 
### 
The primary problem facing the
United States today is that of set
ting its own house in order rather
than attempting to solve Europe's
problems, a Washington reporter and
a foreign correspondent told Cali
fornia editors here Saturday.
Speaking before the ninth annual
Editors' Conference, Hal Boyle, As
sociated Press roving correspondent,
and Lyle Wilson, United Press
Washington manager, declared there
has been a great change in the char
acter of the American people since
the end of the war.
FELLOWSHIP GONE
"People don't know and don't care
what the rest of the country is doing
now that the war is over," Boyle said
at a luncheon session held in the
Stanford Union. "The fellowship of
a fighting U.S. is gone."
Stating that our country should not
worry so much about the small
European countries, Boyle said we
should concentrate instead on our
basic problem today restoring the
wartime unity of the United States.
At the dinner session, Wilson told
the editors the United States must
be strong at home before it can
have any influence abroad.
GREATEST WEAKNESS
Wilson declared that one of our
country's greatest weaknesses is its
inefficiency.
"Yet," he said, "experience has
shown that restrictions on the free
dom of men are directly proportional
to the amount of government ef
ficiency."
He pointed out that short-cuts in
governmental machinery, such as
executive agreements made by the
President, often achieve desirable
ends, but that such steps endanger
our democratic institutions.
Other speakers at the conference
co-sponsored by the University, in
cluded: Clifford F. Weigle, Thomas
Newell, and Dr. Raymond Lawrence
of the Stanford faculty; Neal Van
Sooy, former Stanford Alumni di
