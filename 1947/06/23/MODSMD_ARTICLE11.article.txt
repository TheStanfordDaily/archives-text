### 
PORTLAND, Ore., June 22.—Pro
fessors from leading colleges of the
nation today concluded an eight
day session of the Northwest Insti
tute of International Relations here
with little agreement as to how to
prevent World War 111,
Dr. Peter Odegard, chairman and
president of Reed College here, said
that speakers expressed a persistent
feeling of the possibility of another
war.
He said the crisis arose from what,
in the institute's opinion, is "the
apparently aggressive and uncoop
erative policy of the Soviet Union."
Members proposed two different
solutions to the crisis—that the Uni
ted States become an armed camp;
that the United States use its eco
nomic power to implement in acces
sible foreign countries its long-term
policy of ''sustaining the dignity of
man."
