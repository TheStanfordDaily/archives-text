## 
### 
MADISON, Wis., June 22 (UP).â€”Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New
York, twice before the choice of Wisconsin Republicans as a

Presidential candidate, wop the most
first-choice-for-1948 votes in a field
of 12 voted on by delegates to this
year's state convention, a ballot
count disclosed today. Among the
delegates who registered their
choices, Dewey had 321 votes, only
35 more than Stassen. Gen. Doug
las Mac Arthur, regarded by Wis
consin as a "native son," was in
third place with 157, far ahead of
such notables as U.S. Senators Rob
ert Taft of Ohio, John Bricker of
Ohio, and Arthur Vandenberg of
Michigan.
Also noteworthy was the fact that
of the 321 who listed Dewey as their
first choice, 91 listed Stassen as their
second; and of the 286 who gave
Stassen first place. 95 picked Dewey
in second, giving rise to early specu
lation on the possible popularity of a
Dewey-Stassen ticket in Wisconsin.


THOMAS E. DEWEY
