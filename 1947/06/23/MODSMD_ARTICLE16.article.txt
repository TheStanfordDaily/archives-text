### 
LOS ANGELES, June 22 (UP).— j
The tanker Markay exploded today,
spewing a sheet of flames in the |
Los Angeles harbor, resulting in [
four deaths. 12 missing and $7,000,-
000 property damage.
Half a dozen ships were pulled j
out of danger under a plan that was j
developed since the recent Texas j
City, Tex., disaster.
Twenty storage tanks of the Shell
Oil Company, filled with 325,999 J
barrels of oil, were scorched by the
flames which roared 100 feet away,
but they did not explode.
Twenty-four persons were injured |
as the 6,000 - ton Markay, loaded
with gasoline, was ripped by two
blasts shortly after 2 a.m.
The intense heat virtually melted
the middle of the Markay, whose
two ends were left standing above
water while its center was under
water.
Windows in the San Pedro-Wil- |
mington harbor area were shattered ;
for more than a mile. Flames, smoke j
and debris leaped up 500 feet into j
the air.
"This is another case of destruc- |
lion originating in a ship," Rear Ad
miral Frank D. Higbee, port war- [
den, declared. "There was nothing j
on shore that had anything to do
with this."
