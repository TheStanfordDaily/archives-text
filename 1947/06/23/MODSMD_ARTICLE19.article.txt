## 'Sex, Crime, Revolution' 
### 
In another column on this page you will find a review of
a speech on Germany given by Prof. James K. Pollock. He
was greatly impressed, he said, by the terrible misery—by
the "progressive deterioration of good human material." After
two years as an occupying power the American people, he
said, do not understand the basic German problems (and the
basic American problems arising through victory) at all; the
only matters with which they concern themselves are "sex,
crime, and revolution."
That, it seems to us, is a sad commentary on Americans;
Bad but only too true. The attitude is not confined to Germany;
it permeates our whole national being. As a people we know
all the latest details of such happenings as the Black Dahlia
murders, but we neither know nor care about a move to scuttle
the entire reciprocal trade program; we can quote chapter
and verse on the life and times of Bugsy Siegel, but most of
us are unaware that Getulio Vargas is no longer dictator of
Brazil; we know the details of that China rape case involving
a Marine, but not that one of the bloodiest dictators of all time
holds sway in the Dominican Republic.
This attitude is a national failing; it can be changed only by
ourselves. Sensational newspapers are blamed for this preoc
cupation with the more vulgar and less significant items in the
news, but the blame is not so easily escapable. Sensational
newspapers exist only because crowds of people jostle each
other in their eagerness to buy them. They are not the formu
lators of the public morals; rather they are merely pandering
to them.
Dr. Pollock is here for the summer. He is an expert on a
matter which concerns us all vitally. Other men on the teach
ing staff are experts on other vital questions. Therefore it
behooves those who are really seeking an education to seek
them out —and listen to them. Dr. Pollock is only one of many
of them, but he serves as a most fine example. We don't know
if he is scheduled to appear on the Tuesday Evening Series
this summer—but if he isn't he should be put on the schedule
right away. And, when he does speak, it should be before
a packed house, not just a scattering of Phi Beta Kappas, pro
fessors, and Palo Alto people. We know that the German
problem doesn't sound very interesting these hot days, but we
can guarantee that Dr. Pollock would hold an audience
spellbound.
