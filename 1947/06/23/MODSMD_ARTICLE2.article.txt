# Senate Expected to Override Truman On Veto of Labor-Regulating Measure
## 66 Senators Reportedly Favoring Measure; Protests Flooding Mails 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 22 (UP). —A responsible administration
source conceded today that the Senate would override President
Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Labor Control Act by at least
four votes tomorrow, despite an all-out campaign of pressure to
kill the measure.
Barring a wholly-unexpected shift in the lineup of southern

Democrats who supported the bill
this informant, a Senate
I official, said the explosive measure
| would be enacted into law when the
, veto is put to a vote at 3 p.m., E.D.T.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, co-author of
the legislation, and Sen. Claude A.
Pepper, one of its bittei'est foes,
fired their final oratorical shots to
night in simultaneous radio addresses
1 at 10:30 p.m. E.D.T., over the NBC
J and Mutual networks, respectively.
ONE MORE ROUND
And both sides will have one more
j round of debate on the Senate floor
■ from noon, E.D.T., until the voting
deadline set by unanimous agreement
Saturday night, when the pro-labor
| bloc's 31-hour filibuster collapsed.
But even staunch administration
supporters admitted privately that
they saw no more than an outside
chance of mustering more than 29
1 to 30 of the 92 senate votes that are
1 expected to be cast.
Republican leaders, needing 62
votes for the two-thirds majority
required to override, counted at
least that number and probably 66
• "in the bag" going into the home
; stretch.
MORSE STILL OPPOSED
They included 16 to 18 southern
Democrats and 46 to 48 of the 51 Re
publicans in the Senate. GOP Sen.
Wayne L. Morse, Ore., has declared
his intention of voting to sustain the
veto; Sens. George W. Malone, R.,
Nev., and William Langer, R., N.D.,
, voted against the original bill and
are expected to follow Moi-se in up
holding the President. Sens. George
D. Aiken, R., Vt., and Charles W.
Tobey, R., N.H., are reported un
decided.
The major uncertainty on the eve
of the showdown was what effect
the avalanche of protest messages
pouring in on the Senate by mail and
wire from all parts of the country
would have on the handful of waver
ing senators whose votes will decide
the issue.

bill stirred up Congressional fight.


SEN. ROBERT A. TAFT, co
author of vetoed labor bill, who
made radio address last night.
WASHINGTON, June 22 (UP). —A responsible administration
source conceded today that the Senate would override President
Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Labor Control Act by at least
four votes tomorrow, despite an all-out campaign of pressure to
kill the measure.
Barring a wholly-unexpected shift in the lineup of southern

Democrats who supported the bill
this informant, a Senate
I official, said the explosive measure
| would be enacted into law when the
, veto is put to a vote at 3 p.m., E.D.T.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, co-author of
the legislation, and Sen. Claude A.
Pepper, one of its bittei'est foes,
fired their final oratorical shots to
night in simultaneous radio addresses
1 at 10:30 p.m. E.D.T., over the NBC
J and Mutual networks, respectively.
ONE MORE ROUND
And both sides will have one more
j round of debate on the Senate floor
■ from noon, E.D.T., until the voting
deadline set by unanimous agreement
Saturday night, when the pro-labor
| bloc's 31-hour filibuster collapsed.
But even staunch administration
supporters admitted privately that
they saw no more than an outside
chance of mustering more than 29
1 to 30 of the 92 senate votes that are
1 expected to be cast.
Republican leaders, needing 62
votes for the two-thirds majority
required to override, counted at
least that number and probably 66
• "in the bag" going into the home
; stretch.
MORSE STILL OPPOSED
They included 16 to 18 southern
Democrats and 46 to 48 of the 51 Re
publicans in the Senate. GOP Sen.
Wayne L. Morse, Ore., has declared
his intention of voting to sustain the
veto; Sens. George W. Malone, R.,
Nev., and William Langer, R., N.D.,
, voted against the original bill and
are expected to follow Moi-se in up
holding the President. Sens. George
D. Aiken, R., Vt., and Charles W.
Tobey, R., N.H., are reported un
decided.
The major uncertainty on the eve
of the showdown was what effect
the avalanche of protest messages
pouring in on the Senate by mail and
wire from all parts of the country
would have on the handful of waver
ing senators whose votes will decide
the issue.
