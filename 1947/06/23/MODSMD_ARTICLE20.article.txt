# Dick Arnold
## Bull Session 
### 
(This summer's Bull Session is being split between brothers Bud and
and Dick Arnold. Columns will be written alternately.—Ed.)
While my brother is tying up his whipping boys, maybe I can find
somebody to pat on the head. There don't seem to be many people left
in the world to be nice to, but with a few of the bum ones dying recently,
I'm beginning to feel a little more generous toward mankind. I never
liked Eugene Talmadge, and he's dead. I never liked Henry Ford,
and he's dead. I never liked David I. Walsh, and he's dead, too. I
despised Bugsy Siegel, and he's very much dead. James M. Curley,
the last I heard, was dying. Of course, McKellar and Rankin and Bilbo,
Hague and Crump, Pegler and Hearst, Franco and Peron are still
around, but I figure that perhaps one of them will find a burial fairly
soon.
I'm not trying to be cruel with all this. I know it's not "nice" to
scoff at the dead. It's just that ever since Willkie and Roosevelt died,
I've been looking around for compensations. It seemed for such a long
time there as though only the friends of the people, the gentlemen who
thought of the welfare of the majority, could die. But the last few
months have evened things up some, and, as I say, that's somewhat
gratifying.
It's curious, when you come to think of it, that there are so few
famous people any more who are worth admiring. Maybe this is why
we hate so much; we have no decent idols these days. Famous politi
cians are mostly biased and prejudiced. Famous writers are often cold
blooded and withdrawn. Famous actors are usually phoney. Famous
athletes are too shallow, and famous gangsters are too frightening.
So about all there is left to do with the famous and notorious, the spot
light crowd, is to lambast them.
That's why it is going to be hard to find heads to pat. There are
more tails than heads in today's flipping, and so there is more kicking
than patting. Villains are a dime a dozen, but heroes are awfully scarce.
But stick around, because before the summer's over, I may be able
to find somebody who will rate at least a gracious nod. Besides, it's too
hot to be really hateful.

While my brother is tying up his whipping boys, maybe I can find
somebody to pat on the head. There don't seem to be many people left
in the world to be nice to, but with a few of the bum ones dying recently,
I'm beginning to feel a little more generous toward mankind. I never
liked Eugene Talmadge, and he's dead. I never liked Henry Ford,
and he's dead. I never liked David I. Walsh, and he's dead, too. I
despised Bugsy Siegel, and he's very much dead. James M. Curley,
the last I heard, was dying. Of course, McKellar and Rankin and Bilbo,
Hague and Crump, Pegler and Hearst, Franco and Peron are still
around, but I figure that perhaps one of them will find a burial fairly
soon.
I'm not trying to be cruel with all this. I know it's not "nice" to
scoff at the dead. It's just that ever since Willkie and Roosevelt died,
I've been looking around for compensations. It seemed for such a long
time there as though only the friends of the people, the gentlemen who
thought of the welfare of the majority, could die. But the last few
months have evened things up some, and, as I say, that's somewhat
gratifying.
It's curious, when you come to think of it, that there are so few
famous people any more who are worth admiring. Maybe this is why
we hate so much; we have no decent idols these days. Famous politi
cians are mostly biased and prejudiced. Famous writers are often cold
blooded and withdrawn. Famous actors are usually phoney. Famous
athletes are too shallow, and famous gangsters are too frightening.
So about all there is left to do with the famous and notorious, the spot
light crowd, is to lambast them.
That's why it is going to be hard to find heads to pat. There are
more tails than heads in today's flipping, and so there is more kicking
than patting. Villains are a dime a dozen, but heroes are awfully scarce.
But stick around, because before the summer's over, I may be able
to find somebody who will rate at least a gracious nod. Besides, it's too
hot to be really hateful.
