# Germany Must Become Economic Unit--Pollock
## 
### 
(See Editorial)
The economic revival of Ger
many—and of Europe—is essential
unless Germany is to remain a sink
hole and a sore, said Prof. James K.
Pollock at the Ninth Annual Stan
ford - CNPA Editors' Conference
Friday evening. The only way to
accomplish this revival is to make
Germany an economic unit as pro
vided by the Potsdam Conference,
Dr. Pollock said; the Germans are
working hard, but are helpless in
the face of great-power disagree
ments.
Dr. Pollock was for over a year
the special adviser to Gen. Lucius
D. Clay, American Military Gov
ernor in Germany. A former Stan
ford faculty member, Dr. Pollock is
back at the University for the sum
mer as an exchange professor of
political science from the Univer
sity of Michigan. He is teach
ing Contemporary Governments
Abroad.
OBJECTIVE PROBLEM
What happened in the German
area —and what will happen—is as
important as what happened to the
Germans themselves, said Dr. Pol
lock. In dealing with the problems
that have arisen there is no room
either for excessive sentimentality
or for excessive vindictiveness, he
stated; the problem must be
thought out objectively — and
solved—if the world is to avert
another terrific international con
flagration.
The most serious problem in
Germany today is that of housing,
he continued. In the U.S. zone
alone a third of the living units
have been totally destroyed; yet
there are three million more Ger
mans living there than in 1939. In
addition, the occupying forces must
be housed.
Dr. Pollock listed food as the
second greatest problem — second
only because it is possible to ship
food in from the outside while
housing is not so mobile. Germany
could produce enough food for
herself only if 25 million people
were moved out, he said.

Trade and industry is just as
bad off, said the educator; the
economy was country-wide. Think
how it would be, he said, if the
United States were partitioned,
trade between zones cut ofT, dif
ferent currency systems adopted,
and different political forms es
tablished. Even the purchase of
seeds from another zone, he said,
"amounts almost to a treaty nego
tiation." The simplest negotiations
are made primitive and difficult.
Some say the democratic forms
established by the United States
won't endure, he continued, but
"What kind of a government did
you want us to set up? Soviet?
What else were w.e to do? Whether
or not the forms will last depends
on events yet to come."
The Moscow Conference accom
plished nothing except the clarifi
cation of each country's desires,
stated Dr. Pollock; the basic prob
lems have not been solved and
cannot be until Germany is made
an economic unit.
RUSSO-FRENCH OPPOSITION
Both Russia and France are
blocking any such move, he
charged. The only way out ap
pears to be co-operation between
the U.S. and Britain in building up
their own zones; it can be accom
plished in a few years, Dr. Pollock
believes—but at the price of draw
ing a line between East and West.
"The Russians want Germany to
go Communist and France seems
to want to maintain chaos," said
Dr. Pollock.
Drawing a line between East and
West, he said, would inevitably re
sult in war — because eventually
the Western Germans would be
bound to try to recover their lost
eastern territory. However, we
have to make our zone self-sup
porting, he said; we can't go on
pouring money down the drain,
keeping the Germans at a starva
tion level—else Germany will be
come a breeding ground for Com
munism as well as for future wars.

have been totally destroyed; yet
there are three million more Ger
mans living there than in 1939. In
addition, the occupying forces must
be housed.
Dr. Pollock listed food as the
second greatest problem — second
only because it is possible to ship
food in from the outside while
housing is not so mobile. Germany
could produce enough food for
herself only if 25 million people
were moved out, he said.

Trade and industry is just as
bad off, said the educator; the
economy was country-wide. Think
how it would be, he said, if the
United States were partitioned,
trade between zones cut ofT, dif
ferent currency systems adopted,
and different political forms es
tablished. Even the purchase of
seeds from another zone, he said,
"amounts almost to a treaty nego
tiation." The simplest negotiations
are made primitive and difficult.
Some say the democratic forms
established by the United States
won't endure, he continued, but
"What kind of a government did
you want us to set up? Soviet?
What else were w.e to do? Whether
or not the forms will last depends
on events yet to come."
The Moscow Conference accom
plished nothing except the clarifi
cation of each country's desires,
stated Dr. Pollock; the basic prob
lems have not been solved and
cannot be until Germany is made
an economic unit.
RUSSO-FRENCH OPPOSITION
Both Russia and France are
blocking any such move, he
charged. The only way out ap
pears to be co-operation between
the U.S. and Britain in building up
their own zones; it can be accom
plished in a few years, Dr. Pollock
believes—but at the price of draw
ing a line between East and West.
"The Russians want Germany to
go Communist and France seems
to want to maintain chaos," said
Dr. Pollock.
Drawing a line between East and
West, he said, would inevitably re
sult in war — because eventually
the Western Germans would be
bound to try to recover their lost
eastern territory. However, we
have to make our zone self-sup
porting, he said; we can't go on
pouring money down the drain,
keeping the Germans at a starva
tion level—else Germany will be
come a breeding ground for Com
munism as well as for future wars.

The economic revival of Ger
many—and of Europe—is essential
unless Germany is to remain a sink
hole and a sore, said Prof. James K.
Pollock at the Ninth Annual Stan
ford - CNPA Editors' Conference
Friday evening. The only way to
accomplish this revival is to make
Germany an economic unit as pro
vided by the Potsdam Conference,
Dr. Pollock said; the Germans are
working hard, but are helpless in
the face of great-power disagree
ments.
Dr. Pollock was for over a year
the special adviser to Gen. Lucius
D. Clay, American Military Gov
ernor in Germany. A former Stan
ford faculty member, Dr. Pollock is
back at the University for the sum
mer as an exchange professor of
political science from the Univer
sity of Michigan. He is teach
ing Contemporary Governments
Abroad.
OBJECTIVE PROBLEM
What happened in the German
area —and what will happen—is as
important as what happened to the
Germans themselves, said Dr. Pol
lock. In dealing with the problems
that have arisen there is no room
either for excessive sentimentality
or for excessive vindictiveness, he
stated; the problem must be
thought out objectively — and
solved—if the world is to avert
another terrific international con
flagration.
The most serious problem in
Germany today is that of housing,
he continued. In the U.S. zone
alone a third of the living units
have been totally destroyed; yet
there are three million more Ger
mans living there than in 1939. In
addition, the occupying forces must
be housed.
