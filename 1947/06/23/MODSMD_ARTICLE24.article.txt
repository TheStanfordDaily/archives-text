(Tlie Daily will be happy to
use any non-lihclous Campus
Opinions received. Letters should
not he longer than 150 words and
should he addressed to the edi
tor. Names will he withheld on
request, but the name and ad
dress of the writer must accom
pany the letter.—Ed.)

The Editor, Sir:
1 have been attending Stanford
for six years now, off and on, and
have yet. ta ecc a more unpleasant
i : lv".lion than that existing in En
cina Commons at present. There's
a rule, they tell us, that everyone
living in Encina must eat in the
Commons. Why then don't the
dining hall authorities provide fa
cilities sufficient to serve those
who are forced to eat there? En
cina appears to be filled to ca
pacity, yet only one side, one half,
of the Commons is in use. It is
impossible to eat any meal with
out waiting in line for it; at dinner
and supper we wait from 10 to 20
minutes every time. The obvious
remedy is to open both sides—but
all that has been done to date is
to provide benches for the line to
wait on and a sign "Move Rap
idly"!
The answer I get to this—if I
get one — will probably be that
they would lose money if they
opened both sides of the Commons.
Personally, at $135 for a ten-week
quarter, I don't see how they could
lose much under any circum
stances.
"Foot-sore"
Stanford University
The Editor, Sir:
Now that the Music Department
is established up on the Knoll, a
path, a well-worn path, has de
veloped running from what the
map calls "Lane W" across the
fields and up the hill to that many
chimneyed monstrosity (the build
ing, I mean, not the Music De
partment). Wouldn't it be pos
sible, in preparation for winter
quarter and the rainy season, to
pave or improve this path some
how? Certainly there seems to be
a public demand for such a thor
oughfare.

The Editor, Sir:
Why didn't the Daily get dis
tributed until 11 o'clock on Fri
day? I'm used to having it with
my morning Cellar coffee. It does
n't gag me so much then because
I'm busy gagging on the Dippy,
and vice versa. If you keep get
ting it out late I'll have to start
reading Hearst.
Disgusted
Stanford University
(Since the Daily's press run is
only 2.700 this summer, and since
it comes out only three times a
week, the Stanford University
Press does not feel justified in
hiring night pressmen. The Daily
is printed in the morning and
will appear on the Quad between
10 and 11 o'clock. We're sorry,
hut there's nothing we can do
about it.—Ed.)
