## History 1947 
### 
The corrupt Kuomintang rulers
in China have been having their
troubles for some time, but now
an event may happen that will
really hurt them where they'll feel
it the most —in the pocket book.
Walter G. Bundle, for three years
head of the United Press service in
China, writes from New York that
Chinese attempts to get a $500 mil
lion loan from the Export-Import
Bank before the June 30 deadline
are quite likely to fail.
A joint memorandum sent to the
State Department by the Far East-

American Council of Commerce
and Industry and the National
Foreign Trade Council urges that
"recent and current" develop
ments in China be considered be
fore the loan is granted.
These groups complain against
discriminatory restrictions against
American firms in China, and the
favoring of official and quasi-ofli
cial ("favored family") groups in
trade.
The Kuomintang has brought all
this upon itself. The United States
naturally has preferred to support

it against the Communists in the
north, and has Riven it every op
portunity to reform—opportunities
which have not been seized upon.
Nepotism is rampant, and private
pockets are being lined at the ex
pense of the Chinese people.
Many Americans have protested
in the past against"supporting such
a regime, but with little success—
but now that American business
is fed up, it looks as though the
Kuomintang is faced with a case
of "clean up—or else."
