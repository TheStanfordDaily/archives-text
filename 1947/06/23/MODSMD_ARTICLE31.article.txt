## 
### JOHN AVERILL 
A Farm alumna, Miss Mabel New
comer, has been cited by the Army's
Military Government for Germany
for outstanding work with finance
administrative units of the occupa
tion forces. Miss Newcomer, Stan
ford '13, is now serving as Chief Con
sultant on Taxation of the Office of
Military Government.
She was recently described in a
Public Information Division release
as having a prominent part in help
ing the German state governments in
the American zone manage their
public finance problems with in
creasing efficiency, despite a wide
variety of post-war handicaps and
problems.
Miss Newcomer, prior to her ap
pointment to the post in military
government, was noted both as an
economist and as the author of var
ious standard books on tax matters.
GERMAN ECONOMIC PROGRESS
Speaking for the information re
lease, Miss Newcomer said that de
spite the low and unsettled value of
the reichsmark and other currency
reform problems, the four German
state governments in the American
zone have made substantial progress
in solving their public finance and
tax tribulations.
Miss Newcomer, as taxation con

sultant, has one of the most impor
tant positions in the economic i-eha
bilitation of Germany, the release
reported. As an expert on taxation
and government financing methods,
she is called upon daily to counsel
agencies of the four German lands:
Bavaria, Wurttemberg - Baden,
Greater Hesse, and Bremen. The re
port added that among the German
government offices, and in the Mili
tary Government organization alike,
her advice and the comprehensive
research involved in her work are
held in high esteem.
EARLY FARM GRADUATE
Miss Newcomer, the daughter of a
former Stanford professor of English,
was graduated from Stanford in 1913
with an A.B. degree and received
the M.A. degree the following year.
She received the Ph.D. degree from
Columbia in 1917, and since that
time has been on the faculty of Vas
sar College. Now on leave from her j
chair as professor of economics, she i
expects to return in August.
She has, at various times, served j
as tax consultant for the U.S. Treas- 1
ury and New York and California
State Tax Commissions. She was a
delegate to the Bretton Woods Con
ference in 1944, and is now vice
president of the American Econ- i
omics Association.
