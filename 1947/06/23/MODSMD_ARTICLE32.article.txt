# 'Shootki' Run Due Thursday
## 
### 
Stanford's three fellowship actors,
Beatrice Manley, Walker Vaughn,
and William Vorenburg, will be
given a chance to show what they
can do in "Shootki," a program of
four one-act farces to be presented
by the Stanford Players Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday in the Memo
rial Auditorium.
Until now the actors, professionals
brought here on a stipend to assist
in the drama program, have been
busy assisting with the general pro
gram and have appeared in such
productions as "The Devil's Disciple"
and "No Exit."
Each of the young actors has been
cast in three varied roles in "Shoot
ki," translated "little acted jokes,"
which will include the farces ''The
Anniversary," "Marriage Proposal,"
and"The Boor." "Swan Song," act
ed by Roy Pool and Allen Fletcher,
and four musical interludes by
Moussorgsky will be included.
The roles in the musicals will be
sung and acted by singers known
for their work in operas, Marjorie
Dickenson, Beta Popper, James
Schwabacher, and Jack Taylor.
"Shootki" is an extra production
by the Players, and Jack Nceson, a
fellowship student in design, plan
ned and built the scenery.
