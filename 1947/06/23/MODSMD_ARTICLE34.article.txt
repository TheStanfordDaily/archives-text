## 
### 
Defending champion Stanford University's golfing contingent
readied itself for the start of the national intercollegiate individ
ual and team golf championships today as a record-breaking
entry list of 302 golfers begin preparations for intense fireworks
on the University of Michigan course.
Stanford, Pacific Coast Conference title holder, is again fa-

vored to retain its NCAA bunting
with major team threats coming
from Louisiana State, Princeton,
University of Miami, Tulane, Yale,
and Michigan.
?lIKEE VETS HACK
Three Farm holdovers from last
3'ear's squad form the nucleus of
Eddie Twiggs current Indian pro
duction. They are Bob Rosburg,
John Shuler, and Bob Cardinal, a
top-flight trio which will be aided
no end by the likes of Bob Rose
crance, Tom Lambie, and Ernie
Ke 11 berg.
Qualifying play will be staged to
day with the finals being slated
Sunday. Sixty-four individual qual
ifiers begin match play on Thurs
day.
The race for medalist honors is a
â€¢wide open affair as evidenced by
the entry of sectional luminaries,
including Eli Bariteau, the Califor
nia amateur tourney medalist from
San Jose State; Denver's Chuck
Lind, who last year cracked a 290
score for runner - up honors; and
Purdue's Fred Wampler, who has
yet to shoot a round above 80 this
season.
WHO'LL WIN?
All things considered, the Cards
are in for no bed of roses, accord
ing to numerous experts who pre
dict the "toughest intercollegiate
fight in many a moon." The Indians
edged Michigan by five strokes last
year fo snare their fifth title in six
outings.
With a seasonal record of but one
loss in 10 attempts, the Cards will
endeavor to celebrate golf being
recognized as a major sport here by
annexing the national crown.
Farm hopefuls Rosburg and Lam
bie, both recent participants in the
trans-Mississippi golf tournament in
Wichita, were rushed to the Michi
gan scene yesterday ready for med
alist play today.
MICHIGAN IS HOST
Host team Michigan, Big Nine
champ, i.s pinning its hopes on Ed
Schalon, who tied for medalist lau
rels with Ohio State's Howie Baker
in the Big Nine Conference meet;
Dave Barclay; and Johnny Jens
wold, runner-up in the '44 and '45
individual championships.
Though known to be a master of
utter dejecture, Coach Twiggs, prior
to departing for Ann Arbor, would
neither prophecy nor complain
about the locals' chances. All in all,
judging from the recent perform
ances of the Farm golfers, the In
dians are rated as one of the nation's
top intercollegiate squads.
Seventy - nine colleges have en
tered teams in a meet that is record
shattering in every respect. Largest
previous meet was staged at Ohio
State in 1941.
