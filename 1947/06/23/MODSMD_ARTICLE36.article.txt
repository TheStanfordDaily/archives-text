# Records Fall At Salt Lake

### JACK WEIERSHAUSER Stanford Track Coach (Special to the Daily 
SALT LAKE CITY, June 21—
Rain and records fell tonight at
the 26th annual running of the
NCAA track festival here, as
Herb McKenley, Illinois speed
ster, paced his teammates to
championship honors with a
:46 .2 world's record mark in the
440 and a :20.7 in the 220. U.S.C.
finished second in team points.
Harrison Dillard, a mite of a fel
low, ran the 220-yard low hurdles
in :22.3 for another world's record.
The two Stanford entrants in the
meet, Larry Hoff and George
Grimes, were both eliminated in the
Friday evening trials. Hoff was third
in a 440 heat but only the first two
places qualified. Hoff's unofficial
time was :49 flat.
GRIMES HAS INJURY
Grimes failed to finish his 880 be
cause of a cramped leg. Stanford's
colors, however, made an official ap
pearance Saturday evening in a
special centennial mile relay.
Hoff ran third for the Pacific
Coast team that finished second, as
he finished four yards ahead of his
closest rival at the end of his lap—
despite the fact that he trailed by
five yards at the start.
Willie Steele, San Diego State,
made the second longest broad jump
in history when he took off on a
26—ft., 6'/4-in. jump, a leap which is
within two inches of Jesse Owens'
world record.
USC DISAPPOINTS
Southern California brought a 22-
man team to Utah and the Trojans
were favored to win, but the Crom
well strength disintegrated early
and Illini reaped their second con
secutive NCAA victory.
Mel Patton was the only Trojan
who packed home a first-place med
al. In the Friday trials he did :0H.4
in the century dash, and in the
finals he did the event in :09.7.
