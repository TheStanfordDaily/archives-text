SACRAMENTO, Cal. June 22 (UP)
I —Joyce Macßea, swim star of San
Francisco's championship Crystal
Plunge team, equalled the American
record of 32.6 seconds for the 50-yard
breaststroke in an exhibition by the
I club at Land Park Plunge here today.
Queen Ann Curtis of the Crystal
Plunge also exhibited her champion
ship style but decided against a
| planned attempt to lower her 100-
yard freestyle world record because
of (he 40-foot length of the pool.
Crystal Plunge Coach Charlie
Sava expected to submit Miss Mac-
Rea's record-tying mark for AAU
recognition. Her time was the more
remarkable in that she swam with
out competition and made one turn
to complete the 50-yard distance.
