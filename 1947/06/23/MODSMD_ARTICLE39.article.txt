come the seventh two-time holder
of the Professional Golfers' Associa
tion championship, moved to the
semi - finals today with an uphill
victory over National Open Cham
pion Lew Worsham.
Ghezzi took a 3 and 2 decision
from Worsham, the Washington
links star who next Thursday will
meet President Truman and receive
a new car as the capital honors him
for his victory last week in the
Open.

vorites to be eliminated from the
tournament. The defending cham
pion, Ben Hogan, medalist Jimmy
Demarct and South Africa's Bobby
Locke went out in first-round play
while Sam Snead fell victim to Gene
Sarazen in the second.

hole drive to overcome a two-up
advantage Worsham held at thÂ»
Midway point of the 36-hole match.
He forced the issue by shooting
three under par for the 16 afternoon
holes that were played.
