# SF Records Five-Minute Earthquake
## 
### MABEL ADKISON 
Terra firma came to life once
again yesterday afternoon in the San
Francisco and Monterey areas. Old
timers remembered 1906 and cocked
their heads to listen, while occu
pants of buildings in downtown San
Francisco rushed to the streets when
they felt the floors under them be
gin to sway.
I The quaking earth dislodged boul
j ders from the cliffs near Watsonville
i which toppled onto the highway at
Crittenden Pass and blocked the road
for Sunday afternoon drivers.
Meantime in San Francisco, the
i rattle of glasses and bottles in the
I cafes and bars was noiser than the
| usual casual clink of hot afternoon
! cocktail parties. Some switchboard
I operators at the telephone exchange
I became alarmed and ran downstairs
! when the board in front of them be
! gan to sway from the hands that
tried to make connections.
! Windows and dishes rattled in resi
; dential areas while the warm sand
j vibrated at Santa Cruz.
Dr. Perry Byerly, University of
California seismologist, reported
that the quake, which lasted for five
minutes, beginning at 3:29 p.m., was
recorded by the university seismo
graph. He said it was of "moder
ate" intensity, with an epicenter 10
to 15 miles from the university in
an undetermined direction.
