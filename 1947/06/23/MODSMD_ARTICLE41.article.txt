The East broke the West's crew
racing supremacy Saturday after
noon when the Middies from An
napolis overcame an early Califor
nia lead and swept on to win the
45th annual Poughkeepsie Regatta
in 13:59.2, almost five seconds faster
than the second-place Cornell per
formance.
Coach Ky Ebright's heretofore un
beaten Golden Bears wore them
selves out in the first half of the
race, and after sprinting to the lead
with an upped stroke of 38, they
fell back as the Navy boys overtook

them with a half-mile to go.
Behind Navy by half a length was
Cornell, and behind the Cornell
shell was Washington. California,
which had previously beaten Wash
ington this spring, trailed in fourth
place, two lengths behind the win
ners.
The Bears managed to salvage
something from the debris of tHe
Regatta hopes, as the Cal junior
varsity boat won its event. Wash
ington captured the freshman race.
