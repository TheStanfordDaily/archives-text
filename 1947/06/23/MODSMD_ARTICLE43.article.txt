man in baseball except his pitching
team mate, Johnny Vandenneer,
had achieved, saw his great effort
go for nothing when Eddie Stanky I
bounced a cheap ground single into !
left center with one man out in the 1
ninth.
Dodger pitcher Joe Hatton also had
a no-hitter until Eddie Miller dou- j
bled in the fifth. But he went out in i
the sixth.
