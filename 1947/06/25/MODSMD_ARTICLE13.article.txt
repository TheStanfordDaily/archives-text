# 180,000 Miners Out on Strike
## Walkouts Grow in Labor Law Protest; Injunctions Under New Law Unlikely 
### 
PITTSBURGH, June 24 (UP). —An ever-swelling tide of strikes
protesting the Taft-Hartley Labor Law swept through the soft coal
fields today, and by nightfall 180,000 miners had walked out.
The wildcat strikes, gaining momentum on each shift, rolled
through Alabama, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,

Indiana, Virginia, Tennessee and
Kentucky.
The strikers represented more
than one third of the United Mine
Workers 400,000 soft coal member
ship. Walkouts began late yester
day less than an hour after the
Senate had over-ridden President
Truman's veto of the Labor Bill.
Reports from the coal fields said
the miners were "extremely bitter."
A union official at Washington, Pa
said, "if Congress thinks it can pass
laws like that, let them dig coal."
Although the Justice Department
reportedly was investigating the
wildcat strikes, informed quarters
doubted that the government would
seek to stop them by injunction.
They said the only possible grounds
for such a step was that the strikers
violate the miners' contract with
the government—which expires five
days hence.
Rep. Howard Smith, D., Va„ co
author of the Smith-Connally Labor
Disputes Act and a leader of the
southern Democratic bloc advocating
stringent labor laws, introduced a
bill to prevent a strike by continuing
the government's authority to oper
ate the mines. That authority ex
pires June 30.
