WASHINGTON, June 24 (UP).—
General Motors President Charles E.
Wilson praised the new labor law
today as "an important step" toward
a greater national prosperity. He
dismissed as "propaganda" President
Truman's repeated warnings tha#
prices and profits are too high.
He said the outlook for a contin
ued high level of production and
employment is very good. The only
dark clouds on the horizon, he said,
are "propaganda in high places"
about high prices and corporate
profits, and the threat of a long coal
strike.
