WASHINGTON, June 24 (UP).— i
! Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's deci
sion to retire to a private career—
j probably early next year—touched
j off a fresh burst of speculation to-
I night about his possible place in
j the 1948 Presidential campaign.
Despite repeated, vigorous asser
| tions that he wants no part of the ;
White House job, the popular Army J
chief of staff is frequently men- |
tioned as Presidential timber by
both Republicans and Democrats. I
Some Democrats are talking of him j
as a running mate for President j
Truman.
