## That Lonesome Road 
### 
College traditions are of two typesâ€”those which are
merely custom, the "pain-in-the-neck" kind, and those which
in addition to having the sanctity and respect of long observ
ance serve some useful purpose.
The first type, which is of little value except to the senti
mentalists, is far more common than the second. Therefore it
is noteworthy when a college has a tradition which is not only
respected and observed but is also of some benefit to some
one.
Such a tradition is Stanford's "Ride to Paly." Old students
are familiar with the tradition. Newcomers should become
eware of it.
Briefly, the "Ride to Paly" tradition is that students driving
on Palm Drive pick up their walking fellow-students. Pedes
trians going to Palo Alto wait at the "Y" on Palm Drive, and
those coming from town wait on University in front of Wilson's.
It's a simple tradition. It has none of the glamor or foolish
ness of the Axe and the Pajamarino. Yet it has been going on
and on as long as either of the other more famous Stanford
customs.
Hot, tired, and disgusted pedestrians get desperate. They
may do anything. The transportation situation can only be
improved by considerate drivers. If they do not have the
thoughtfulness to pick up their less fortunate walking brethren,
we may all be forced to accept the drastic measures advocated
by L'il Injun in order to get a ride.
