I see where the Stanford Players arc going to butcher Chekov this
weekend, and this is all right with me only I don't like to think of any
body paying 90 cents to see the slaughter. The Stanford Players,
for my money, aren't worth a dime, and if they want to fool around
with Chekov, Shakespeare, and Shaw, or even with a small-time oper
ator like Maxwell Anderson, they ought to have the decency to work
in private and let anyone who is looking for a few laughs stand in the
wings for nothing.
They don't rate 90 cents or a dime, not because they aren't pro
fessionals, but because they aren't even good enough as amateurs.
Only one or two can act, hardly anybody is any good at directing them,
and usually, moreover, their selection of plays is foolish. You wonder
how they can possibly come up with such outdated twaddle as "The
Devil's Disciple" or such phoney playwriting as "High Tor."
I'd take it easier on the Players and all the workers in the Speech
and Drama crowd if they went about their business with a humility
consistent with their talent, but they're certainly the snootiest and most
downright precious little clique in the parish and deserve to get tripped
whenever they aren't watching their feet. Somebody should have put
a wet cake of soap near the chalk marks of that hambone who climbed
all over the scenery in last quarter's production of "The Devil's Dis
ciple." I notice he is on an acting fellowship and will be giving the
customers a treat again this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Well, 1
have no quarrel with him and he can act his head off if he wants, but
somebody ought to tell him to go slow on that Captain Bipod stuff
before he breaks a leg. The rest of the cast was no great shakes either,
but this boy was asking for it the hardest.
Of course the Stanford Players are located in California, where
the theatrical climate is more oppressive than the weather. In fact there
is no theater at all to speak of. Oh, sometimes a great stage event
occurs in San Francisco, direct from Los Angeles, and the campus
twitters for weeks in advance of an appearance by Zasu Pitts or Billie
Burke in what is advertised as a real honest-to-God legitimate play
prior to Broadway—which never gets further east than Mormon
country. Then opening night all the stylish students and professors go
up to the city for the big play and see a collection of Hollywood stum
blebums who can't get jobs in pictures and have been rounded up by a
fly-by-night promoter to appear in something that usually sounds like
"Miss Witherspoon Swings It." And whenever Cornell and Aherne
check in with their annual tour of "The Barretts" the season is really
rich.
The idea I've got is that maybe we shouldn't be too hard on the
Stanford Players seeing they have to learn their trade in California,
where the professional theater is a joke. An acting fellowship would
do an actor a lot more good if it shipped him off to New York to sit
through one Broadway season and act through three months of New
England summer stock rather than keep him swinging on the curtains
in Memorial Theater until a Metro agent grabs him for the newest
Rafael Sabatini classic. He'll never get any farther than that if he re
mains out here in the great American desert.
