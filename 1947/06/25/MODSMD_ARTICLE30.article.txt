# Dean's Office a Service For Students--Kimpton
## 
### 
Dr. Lawrence A. Kimpton, Stan
ford's new Dean of Students, sees
his job as a service, primarily to
help the students, he told a Daily
reporter yesterday. He believes in
the autonomy of such student or
ganizations as the ASSU and the
publications, he said, and will do
everything possible to help them.
Dean Kimpton is a big man—a
husky six-footer. He has a pleas
ant manner and has the knack of
drawing people out. He is young
—3G — and seems interested in
many of the things that interest
university students.
He will devote all of his time to
his duties as dean, he said, except
for some teaching in the Philoso
phy Department. He graduated in
philosophy in the Class of '31, and
has the right to wear a Phi Beta
Kappa Key.
At the University of Chicago he
was Dean of Students for two
years before becoming a vice
president and Dean of Faculties.
He is very happy to have a chance
to work with students again, he
said—and most happy to be back
at Stanford after 15 years. He's
been at several schools since his
graduation, but Stanford is the
school that appeals to him most
of all.
Dean Kimpton knows Stanford
very well; he lived in Encina for a
year as a freshman, lived in other
halls, and had many friends on the
Row. "I wasn't a joiner," he said.
"I didn't belong to any of the so
cial organizations, although now I
sort of wish I had. The truth is,
when I came to school I decided I
wanted to join one certain frater
nity; they didn't ask me and I did
n't join anything at all—sort of a
sour grapes attitude.

"This fraternity finally did ask
me to join when I was a junior,
but by that time I had gotten over
the notion."
The University of Chicago de
emphasized football some time ago
and since Dean Kimpton is coming
directly from there a rumor was
started to the effect that he him
self opposed football. On being
asked about it, he termed the fears
completely without foundation.
Football, he believes, gives a stu
dent body something that is irre
placeable. He is a great fan him
self, he said. "After all, I'm leav
ing Chicago. Shouldn't that be
proof enough?"
He described himself as out of
touch with recent doings at Stan
ford, although he has been a reg
ular reader of the Daily for a long
time. He doesn't know yet just
what his major problems will be,
but will try to meet them as they
come.
He was an undergraduate during
Dean George B. Culver's time;
Dean Culver was one of Stanford's
most popular faculty members in
years gone by. "If I can do as good
a job as Dean Culver, I'll be satis
fied," said Dean Kimpton.
The new Dean of Students will
take over in the middle of August,
he said, but won't be able to move
into his house for a month. In the
meantime, he said, he plans to live
at Stanford Village in an effort to
get a line on the problems out
there.
Dean Kimpton is married and
has an 11-year-old son. He hopes
the boy will go to Stanford when
he's a little older, he said—"if his
grades are good enough to get him
in."—Steve Martin

many of the things that interest
university students.
He will devote all of his time to
his duties as dean, he said, except
for some teaching in the Philoso
phy Department. He graduated in
philosophy in the Class of '31, and
has the right to wear a Phi Beta
Kappa Key.
At the University of Chicago he
was Dean of Students for two
years before becoming a vice
president and Dean of Faculties.
He is very happy to have a chance
to work with students again, he
said—and most happy to be back
at Stanford after 15 years. He's
been at several schools since his
graduation, but Stanford is the
school that appeals to him most
of all.
Dean Kimpton knows Stanford
very well; he lived in Encina for a
year as a freshman, lived in other
halls, and had many friends on the
Row. "I wasn't a joiner," he said.
"I didn't belong to any of the so
cial organizations, although now I
sort of wish I had. The truth is,
when I came to school I decided I
wanted to join one certain frater
nity; they didn't ask me and I did
n't join anything at all—sort of a
sour grapes attitude.

"This fraternity finally did ask
me to join when I was a junior,
but by that time I had gotten over
the notion."
The University of Chicago de
emphasized football some time ago
and since Dean Kimpton is coming
directly from there a rumor was
started to the effect that he him
self opposed football. On being
asked about it, he termed the fears
completely without foundation.
Football, he believes, gives a stu
dent body something that is irre
placeable. He is a great fan him
self, he said. "After all, I'm leav
ing Chicago. Shouldn't that be
proof enough?"
He described himself as out of
touch with recent doings at Stan
ford, although he has been a reg
ular reader of the Daily for a long
time. He doesn't know yet just
what his major problems will be,
but will try to meet them as they
come.
He was an undergraduate during
Dean George B. Culver's time;
Dean Culver was one of Stanford's
most popular faculty members in
years gone by. "If I can do as good
a job as Dean Culver, I'll be satis
fied," said Dean Kimpton.
The new Dean of Students will
take over in the middle of August,
he said, but won't be able to move
into his house for a month. In the
meantime, he said, he plans to live
at Stanford Village in an effort to
get a line on the problems out
there.
Dean Kimpton is married and
has an 11-year-old son. He hopes
the boy will go to Stanford when
he's a little older, he said—"if his
grades are good enough to get him
in."—Steve Martin

Dr. Lawrence A. Kimpton, Stan
ford's new Dean of Students, sees
his job as a service, primarily to
help the students, he told a Daily
reporter yesterday. He believes in
the autonomy of such student or
ganizations as the ASSU and the
publications, he said, and will do
everything possible to help them.
Dean Kimpton is a big man—a
husky six-footer. He has a pleas
ant manner and has the knack of
drawing people out. He is young
—3G — and seems interested in
many of the things that interest
university students.
