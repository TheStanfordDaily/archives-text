# Grads Offered High-Salaried Employment
## 
### 
TROY, N. Y. (UP).—College
graduates of 1947 are receiving
job offers at salaries at least 50
per cent higher than those of the
1930 depression years, according to
a survey at Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute.
In the '30s it was the graduate
who hustled for the jobs and what
ever salary he could get. Today,
the situation is reversed, RPI of
ficials say.
CITRUSES "SCOURED"
Leading companies through the
nation have been "scouring" top
college campuses for young science
and engineering graduates. At lea:;t
50 major concerns have sent per
sonal representatives to the cam
pus here, while about 100 others
have conducted interviews by
mail.
The reason for this surge in jpb
offers and higher pay for the
graduates? William E. Crew, RPl's
assistant dean of students says it
is two-fold.
SHORTAGE OF TECHNICIANS
1. The great shortage oi tech
nically-trained men.
2. Increased realization among
companies of the value of going
direct to the schools to obtain men
of highest quality.
To the institute's 370 graduates
this year—Bo per cent of them
veterans—offers were made carry
ing starting salaries between
$2,700 and $3,000 annually. Dean
Crew recalls that the lowest was
$2,400, while salaries offered for
foreign service ran much higher.
For example, he lists one New
York city employment service
which offered $3,900 a year plus
maintenance expenses for sin lu
men, not over 27 years old, with
B.S. degrees in mechanical or
chemical engineering for service in
China and India.
A large American oil company,
Crew added, offered $4,592 a year
plus "extras" for single men with
B.S. degrees for work in Central
America.
MANY INTERVIEWED
Most of the seniors were inter
viewed by at least one company
representative. One student "shop
ped around" through some 20 in
terviews. On the average, each
graduating senior had three or four
interviews before making up his
mind, Crew reported.
Not only private "big" business,
but the armed forces searched the
campus for trained engineers and
scientists, RPI has found.
From one interviewer who had
been on campuses from coast to
coast. Crew learned that "college
students living west of the Allo
ghenies or west of the Mississippi
were willing to take jobs anywhere
in the country."

CITRUSES "SCOURED"
Leading companies through the
nation have been "scouring" top
college campuses for young science
and engineering graduates. At lea:;t
50 major concerns have sent per
sonal representatives to the cam
pus here, while about 100 others
have conducted interviews by
mail.
The reason for this surge in jpb
offers and higher pay for the
graduates? William E. Crew, RPl's
assistant dean of students says it
is two-fold.
SHORTAGE OF TECHNICIANS
1. The great shortage oi tech
nically-trained men.
2. Increased realization among
companies of the value of going
direct to the schools to obtain men
of highest quality.
To the institute's 370 graduates
this year—Bo per cent of them
veterans—offers were made carry
ing starting salaries between
$2,700 and $3,000 annually. Dean
Crew recalls that the lowest was
$2,400, while salaries offered for
foreign service ran much higher.
For example, he lists one New
York city employment service
which offered $3,900 a year plus
maintenance expenses for sin lu
men, not over 27 years old, with
B.S. degrees in mechanical or
chemical engineering for service in
China and India.
A large American oil company,
Crew added, offered $4,592 a year
plus "extras" for single men with
B.S. degrees for work in Central
America.
MANY INTERVIEWED
Most of the seniors were inter
viewed by at least one company
representative. One student "shop
ped around" through some 20 in
terviews. On the average, each
graduating senior had three or four
interviews before making up his
mind, Crew reported.
Not only private "big" business,
but the armed forces searched the
campus for trained engineers and
scientists, RPI has found.
From one interviewer who had
been on campuses from coast to
coast. Crew learned that "college
students living west of the Allo
ghenies or west of the Mississippi
were willing to take jobs anywhere
in the country."
TROY, N. Y. (UP).—College
graduates of 1947 are receiving
job offers at salaries at least 50
per cent higher than those of the
1930 depression years, according to
a survey at Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute.
In the '30s it was the graduate
who hustled for the jobs and what
ever salary he could get. Today,
the situation is reversed, RPI of
ficials say.
