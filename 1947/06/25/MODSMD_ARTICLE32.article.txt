Geo iff e Brunn walked into (lie
office yesterday, and since he is
an old History I!M7 writer from
last fall, who tends to go a little
farther to the left than I.it seems
good idea to give him a hearing
on whatever he may have in
mind.—Endsley)
DID YOU EVER WONDER?
—Why we boast of our freedom
of the press but prohibit union
newspapers to criticize Congress
(that's in the new labor bill)?
—Why the National Association
of Manufacturers can sponsor po
litical candidates on the radio but
unions cannot? That's also in the
Taft-Hartley Bill.
—Exactly what evils this bill
will cure? In the last couple of
years coal-mining, railroads and
building construction have been
among the most critical industries
involved in strikes. But the bill

specifically excepts railroads, gives
John L. Lewis an easy out from
under its provisions and might not
be applicable to the building
trades (where a heavy proportion
of the jurisdictional strikes have
been occurring).
—Why both parties piously de
nounce monopolies and then have
the unbelievable gall to pass the
Reed - Bulwinkle Bill, exempting
railroads from the anti-trust laws?
—Why prices (and profits) are
leaching record heights despite the
promises made by price control
foes over a year ago that if we
only killed OPA prices would soon
come down? How soon is soon?
—Why we allow a small group
of real estate lobbyists to wreck
both rent control and all attempts
to get adequate housing? Not even
that noted radical, Sen. Taft, can
get his housing bill passed.

—Why wc sell guns to Argen
tina, a country that is (and the
State Department doesn't deny it)
the closest thing to Hitlerism we
have in this hemisphere?
—Why we, within 24 hours, ac
quit a self-confessed lynch mob
and find a man guilty of the crim
inal oflense of not telling the State
Dept. that he was a Communist?
This man faces a maximum sen
tence of a hundred years in jail
plus a $10,000 fine.
—Why wc talk foudly and
proudly of our system of free en
terprise when a conservative or
ganization like the Twentietth
Century Fund (Sen. Taft's brother
is one of the directors) shows that
more than half of American indus
try is monopolized? While quite
enterprising, our industry is ap
parently not very free.

have in this hemisphere?
—Why we, within 24 hours, ac
quit a self-confessed lynch mob
and find a man guilty of the crim
inal oflense of not telling the State
Dept. that he was a Communist?
This man faces a maximum sen
tence of a hundred years in jail
plus a $10,000 fine.
—Why wc talk foudly and
proudly of our system of free en
terprise when a conservative or
ganization like the Twentietth
Century Fund (Sen. Taft's brother
is one of the directors) shows that
more than half of American indus
try is monopolized? While quite
enterprising, our industry is ap
parently not very free.
Geo iff e Brunn walked into (lie
office yesterday, and since he is
an old History I!M7 writer from
last fall, who tends to go a little
farther to the left than I.it seems
good idea to give him a hearing
on whatever he may have in
mind.—Endsley)
DID YOU EVER WONDER?
—Why we boast of our freedom
of the press but prohibit union
newspapers to criticize Congress
(that's in the new labor bill)?
—Why the National Association
of Manufacturers can sponsor po
litical candidates on the radio but
unions cannot? That's also in the
Taft-Hartley Bill.
—Exactly what evils this bill
will cure? In the last couple of
years coal-mining, railroads and
building construction have been
among the most critical industries
involved in strikes. But the bill

specifically excepts railroads, gives
John L. Lewis an easy out from
under its provisions and might not
be applicable to the building
trades (where a heavy proportion
of the jurisdictional strikes have
been occurring).
—Why both parties piously de
nounce monopolies and then have
the unbelievable gall to pass the
Reed - Bulwinkle Bill, exempting
railroads from the anti-trust laws?
—Why prices (and profits) are
leaching record heights despite the
promises made by price control
foes over a year ago that if we
only killed OPA prices would soon
come down? How soon is soon?
—Why we allow a small group
of real estate lobbyists to wreck
both rent control and all attempts
to get adequate housing? Not even
that noted radical, Sen. Taft, can
get his housing bill passed.

—Why wc sell guns to Argen
tina, a country that is (and the
State Department doesn't deny it)
the closest thing to Hitlerism we
have in this hemisphere?
