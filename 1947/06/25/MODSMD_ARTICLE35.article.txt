### MAX DUNAWAY 
Last summer a determined Slan
] ford student conquered what was
j thought to be an impossible moun-
I lain peak in the Yosemite Valley.
This summer the same student, Fritz
A. Lippmann, made a new conquest
—this time in the literary world.
CARRIES ACCOUNT
The Saturday Evening Post for
June 25 carries Lippmann's own ac
i count of the daring climb he and
i three fellow members of the Sierra
| Club made up the perpendicular
j side of Los Arrow, the 1,300-foot
: shaft of rock that looms above the
j valley.
Lippmann, a lower division stu
| dent from San Francisco, has de-
I scribed the party's thrilling ascent
i in such graphic terms that the read
| er involuntarily finds himself awed
by the dizzying heights under dis
j cussion. Swinging freely at the end
j of a rope with 1,200 feet of air be
j neath them, making their agonizing
! way straight up the side of the shaft,
and using their teeth to reinforce
the grasp of their tired fingers—
; these were the difficulties endured
J by the quartet.
GOAL ACHIEVED
But the summit was achieved for
the first time in history and four
exhausted but happy climbers made
their way back to the valley lying
2,900 feet below.
Lippmann's record of the expe
rience in the Post makes thrilling
reading for those who prefer to do
their mountain climbing from an
easy chair.*
