### 
New meal hours for Encina dining
hall were announced yesterday in
an effort to relieve congestion and
shorten the long "chow lines." "With
co-operation from the students, I'm
sure that we can work out the pres
ent difficulties," Miss Charlotte Bal
kema, dining hall director, stated.
New hours are:
Breakfast—7-7:45
Lunch—ll:4s-12:45
Dinner—s:4s-6:45
Replying to student criticism that
Encina Commons facilities were in
sufficient, Miss Balkema pointed out
that there was always some confu
sion at the beginning of the quarter.
"For the first week or two," she said,
"everyone tries to eat at the same
time."
Miss Balkema explained that the
west half of the Commons could be
opened, but the additional expense
would mean that less could be spent
on food. "I think the students will
agree that the quality of the food
comes first," she said.
Approximately 400 students are
eating at Encina this quarter.
