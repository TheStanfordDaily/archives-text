# Tuesday Series Speaker Attacks Theatre Unions
## 
### 
George Freedley, New York
drama critic, spoke on the topic,
"The Theatre Swallowed a Tape
worm" at the Tuesday Evening Se
ries lecture in Memorial Auditorium
last night.
The tapeworm is the greed of
commercial interests and the techni
cal unions, Mr. Freedley said.
In a brief histoi'y of the theatre
he told about the rise of the old
theatrical syndicates. They eventu
ally became the United Booking Of
fice, which makes every effort to
prevent any manager from going on
tour without making certain financial
arrangements in advance, he said.
Demands made by the technical
unions and the Dramatists' Guild are
working a hardship on the theatre.
Producers are told how many men
they must employ as stagehands,
and if they are not all used the sal
aries must be paid anyway, he said.
"There are concessions which must
be made by these groups," he de
clared.
"The American National Theatre
Academy is the only organization we
have that is non-profit. It is our
national theatre. It means a theatre
which is dedicated to the highest
ideals of the theatre," Mr. Freedley
said.
The speaker was introduced by
Hubert C. Heffner, professor of
dramatic literature and executive
head of the Speech and Drama de
partment.
