# VCC Loses Patton For Saturday Meet
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Withdrawal of Pell-Mel Patton, USC claimant to the world
century mark of :09.4 seconds, from Saturday's Pacific Coast
Conference-Big Nine track meet cuts a notch deeper into the
PCC's chances to nip the high-powered midwestern contingent.
We have been cut to the guick for we had expected to see

♦" another "race of the century" be
j tween the swift Patton and Herb Mc
; Kenley, Illinois speedster via Ja
: maica.
Patton has voluntarily retired
from the meet because of recurring
leg cramps which have been bother
ing him this season. Nevertheless,
i despite Patton's absence, we look
| forward to watching McKenley
romp home in the quarter mile.
Two Stanford men will join the
West's cause this week, they being
i A 1 Snyder, hurdler who missed out
in last week's NCAA gathering at
Salt Lake City, and Larry HofT, quar
i ter miler.
BIG NINE FAVORED
The torrid showing of the Big
Nine last week in contrast to the
PCC's listless effort makes us more
than lean toward the midwestern
| thin-clads.
1 Despite the non-appearance of
Patton, Berkeley may yet lie the
scene of a record-breaking per
formance with the experts tabbing
McKenley to erase his recent quar
ter mile standard of :46.2 seconds.
The Edwards Stadium oval, we
think, may be just right for the
Illini swiftie who has thus far shaded
the best efforts of the Carrs, East
mans, Williamses, and Klemmers.
DIXON MISSING
Bulk of the Big Nine squad arrived
in Berkeley on Monday and will be
in tip top shape come Saturday af
ternoon. Washington State and
! UCLA will arrive later this week,
the other PCC members already be
ing present and in training.
Injun hurdler Snyder, who has a
:14.3 high hurdles mark to his
credit already, will replace UCLA's
! Craig Dixon as the West's chief
! timber topper. Dixon will be in ab
sentia because of duty this week in
the Naval Reserve.
The javelin event will be notice
ably missing from the combat menu
in lieu of a shuttle hurdles relay,
first event of its nature staged on the
Coast this season. Personally, we
see where the PCC-Big Nine combo
is missing out on what would have
I been one of the top spectator inter
| est events of the meet.
TOP RACE DIES
We can see where the Patton-
McKenley duel was pressured into
j a possible "assault on the 220 yard
world's record." Earlier in the sea
son, the Trojan sprinter defeated
McKenley in a 220 yard special,
touring the distance in :20.4, one
tenth of a second off Jesse Owens'
mark. A duel Saturday with both
i contestants at their physical peak
would normally be our choice for the
meet's piece de resistance.
Judging from recent standards, the
Big Nine looms head and shoulder
blade above the PCC, a far cry from
the days when the men of Troy,
Stanford, and Cal were attired in
the baccalaureate robes befitting a
champ.

Withdrawal of Pell-Mel Patton, USC claimant to the world
century mark of :09.4 seconds, from Saturday's Pacific Coast
Conference-Big Nine track meet cuts a notch deeper into the
PCC's chances to nip the high-powered midwestern contingent.
We have been cut to the guick for we had expected to see

♦" another "race of the century" be
j tween the swift Patton and Herb Mc
; Kenley, Illinois speedster via Ja
: maica.
Patton has voluntarily retired
from the meet because of recurring
leg cramps which have been bother
ing him this season. Nevertheless,
i despite Patton's absence, we look
| forward to watching McKenley
romp home in the quarter mile.
Two Stanford men will join the
West's cause this week, they being
i A 1 Snyder, hurdler who missed out
in last week's NCAA gathering at
Salt Lake City, and Larry HofT, quar
i ter miler.
BIG NINE FAVORED
The torrid showing of the Big
Nine last week in contrast to the
PCC's listless effort makes us more
than lean toward the midwestern
| thin-clads.
1 Despite the non-appearance of
Patton, Berkeley may yet lie the
scene of a record-breaking per
formance with the experts tabbing
McKenley to erase his recent quar
ter mile standard of :46.2 seconds.
The Edwards Stadium oval, we
think, may be just right for the
Illini swiftie who has thus far shaded
the best efforts of the Carrs, East
mans, Williamses, and Klemmers.
DIXON MISSING
Bulk of the Big Nine squad arrived
in Berkeley on Monday and will be
in tip top shape come Saturday af
ternoon. Washington State and
! UCLA will arrive later this week,
the other PCC members already be
ing present and in training.
Injun hurdler Snyder, who has a
:14.3 high hurdles mark to his
credit already, will replace UCLA's
! Craig Dixon as the West's chief
! timber topper. Dixon will be in ab
sentia because of duty this week in
the Naval Reserve.
The javelin event will be notice
ably missing from the combat menu
in lieu of a shuttle hurdles relay,
first event of its nature staged on the
Coast this season. Personally, we
see where the PCC-Big Nine combo
is missing out on what would have
I been one of the top spectator inter
| est events of the meet.
TOP RACE DIES
We can see where the Patton-
McKenley duel was pressured into
j a possible "assault on the 220 yard
world's record." Earlier in the sea
son, the Trojan sprinter defeated
McKenley in a 220 yard special,
touring the distance in :20.4, one
tenth of a second off Jesse Owens'
mark. A duel Saturday with both
i contestants at their physical peak
would normally be our choice for the
meet's piece de resistance.
Judging from recent standards, the
Big Nine looms head and shoulder
blade above the PCC, a far cry from
the days when the men of Troy,
Stanford, and Cal were attired in
the baccalaureate robes befitting a
champ.
