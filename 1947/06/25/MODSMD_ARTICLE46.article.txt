# Rookie Misses No-Hit Effort
## 
### 
NEW YORK, June 24 (UP).â€”
Cincinnati fans, still not over the
excitement of watching Ewell Black
well barely miss two straight no
hitters, got another thrill tonight
when rookie Kent Peterson missed
a one-hit shutout in the ninth in
ning as the Reds defeated the Phil
lies, 4 to 2.
Peterson, who differs from Black
well in that he is a southpaw and
was a war hero in the Pacific instead
of Europe, had struck out nine bat
ters and had retired the first man
in the ninth when the Phils made
four straight hits good for two runs.
G UMBER T TO RESCUE
Harry Gumbert came in to save the
21-year-old kid's victory. The Reds
rallied for four runs in the second
inning, Peterson driving in two him
self with a bases-loaded single.
The Braves evened their impor
tant series at St. Louis, defeating
the Cardinals, 9 to 6, as Warren
Spahn scored his 11th victory al
though he was touched for three
homers, including a two-run blast by
Erv Dusak in the ninth. *
DODGERS WIN
Stan Musial and Joe Medwick got
the other Cardinal homers.
The Dodgers used a two-run
homer by Peewee Reese and a steal
of home by Jackie Robinson, to de
feat the Pirates, 4 to 2 at Pittsburgh.
Ralph Branca won his eighth game
of the season, outpitching veteran
lefty, Fritz Ostermueller.
