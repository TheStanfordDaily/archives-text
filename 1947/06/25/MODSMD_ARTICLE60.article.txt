# Navy to Make Pacific Study
## 
### 
Extensive ethnological and an
thropological research by 44 of the
nation's scientists is to be conducted
this summer in the former Japa
nese-mandated islands in the Pa
cific, the Navy Department an
nounced yesterday.
Civilian scientists from 21 institu
tions, including Stanford, will take
part in the Navy's comprehensive
program in the Micronesian Is
land groups.
LEAVES TOMORROW
Stanford's representative, Dr. Wil
liam W. Greulich, professor of anat
omy and director of the Brush
Foundation, will depart from Mof
fett Field tomorrow night at 8 on
board a Navy transport plane bound
'or Guam.
Accompanied by Mrs. Greulich,
who is an experienced research
worker, Dr. Greulich's specific aim
will be to gather data needed to
prepare "height-age-weight" tables
of native children in the area. In
formation on the development and
nutritional status of the Marianas'
children will be accumulated.
Co-operating with the Pacific Sci
ence Board of the National Research
Board and with the Navy Depart
ment. the scientists will cover an
area which will include the Mar
shall, Carolines, and Marianas.
PRIME OBPECTIVE
Number one objective of "CIMA"
(Co-ordinated Investigation of Mi
cronesian Anthropology) is to fill
the gap in scientific information
which was closed when the Japa
nese assumed mandate control of
the region. Particular attention will
be given to the administration, re
habilitation, health, and welfare of
the islands.
More than 1.400 islands in the
various archipelagoes will be cov
ered, the scientists and their parties
to be transported in naval craft of
all types.
Emphasis will be placed on meth
ods of ethnology, cultural anthro
pology, linguistic science, human
and economic geography, and physi
cal anthropology.
Scientific work in the field will
last from three months to a year,
