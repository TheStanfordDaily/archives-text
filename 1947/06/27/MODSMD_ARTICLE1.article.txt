"It's not our place to make any radical changes," summer
A.SSU President A 1 Harris told the first meeting of this quarter's
Executive Committee Wednesday night.
Harris told Excom that he was keeping in touch with Tom
Martzloff, elected ASSU president for 1947-48, and that he hoped

to forward Martzloff's plans for the
coming year wherever possible.
Summer Excom's principal job,
Harris pointed out, is just to deal
with any problems that may arise
summer quarter.
ANDERSON LETTER READ
A letter was read from Martin
Anderson, outgoing student body
president, suggesting that the ASSU
reimburse winners of junior varsity
awards for the cost of their sweaters
in case the athletic department does
not pay for them.
Anderson's letter stated that he
had been informed by Alfred R.
Masters, Director of Athletics, that
the unexpected number of junior
varsity awards had exhausted the
department's appropriation for let
ters and sweaters.
After considerable discussion. Ex
com approved a resolution that the
Stanford Athletic Council should at
tempt to pay for these awards, ei
ther by special appropriation now or
in its next year's budget.
APPROPRIATION MADE
A $210 appropriation was voted
for the revision and publication of
the ASSU Constitution and By-
Laws. Amendments to the budget
of the SIRO and the Summer Daily
were approved.

standing committees: Frank Creede,
constitution and charters; Sam

cina open house, June 27; junior
