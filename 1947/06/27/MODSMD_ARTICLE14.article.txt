### 
MADRID, June 2G (UP). â€”Generalissimo Francisco Franco said
today that nations which recognized Franco Spain eight years
ago are now attempting to make the same government and peo
ple appear as a danger to peace.
Franco blamed the United States for much of the present world

attitude toward his country, and*
said promises made during the war
by President Roosevelt had not been j
lived up to.
SPANISH SUSPICION
"Since the end of the second
world war," he said, "there has been
inspired from abroad a feeling of
suspicion and coolness among the
Spanish people toward the American
nation as a result of the lack of
consideration and unjust treatment
which Spain has been suffering for
over two years under the guidance 1
of the United States."
He said the United States should
stick to the principles of the San
Francisco Charter and specifically
recommended non-interference "in
that which is personal and private for i
each nation."
The 54-year-old master of the
Spanish government, answered
questions submitted by the writer.
ROOSEVELT'S PROMISE
"Spain received a formal promise j
from your President (Roosevelt)
when your nation was passing
through a grave period in which he
said categorically that Spain had
nothing to fear from the Allies,"
Franco said.
"Nevertheless there is the paradox
in which Spain was recognized I
without reservation by the world
powers in April, 1939. as a result
of her victory, precisely when many
countries believed erroneously that
Spain, because of her crusade, was
linked with Axis countries. At that
time there weren't any other insti
tutional organs except the govern
ment the national council of
the Falange."
