# Regulation of Middle East Oil Proposed for United Nations
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., June 26 (UP). —The International Coopera
tive Alliance laid before the United Nations today a proposal for UN
regulation of the coveted oil fields of the Middle East.
An official of the alliance, which represents cooperatives in 39 nations
including all the big powers, said the plan contemplated eventual UN regu
lation of all the oil deposits in the

world. The richest oil deposits out-
Fide the Middle East are in the
United States, Russia, Venezuela
and Colombia.
ON THE DOCKET
As a specialized agency officially
attached to the UN, the alliance
placed the proposal on the docket of
the forthcoming summer session of
the 18-nation economic and social
council.
The proposal was loaded with
controversy and was certain to be
•opposed by the big American and
British oil concerns who control
most of the developed oil resources
of the Middle East. Alliance offi
cials, it was learned, will fight any
effort by the economic and social
council to postpone debate on the
plan.
DISCUSSED INFORMALLY
An alliance spokesman said the
proposal already had been discussed
informally with government officials,
including those of Russia and the
United States, and they displayed
interest." He added, however, that
no government had committed itself.
The cooperative body, claiming a
worldwide membership of 85,000,000
families, asked for formal UN con
sideration because, its spokesman
said, Middle Eastern oil is "the

big danger spot" in international
relations.
UN regulation of the rich oil de
posits, the official added, would
lessen east-west tension over com
peting requirements for oil and speed
development of the vast petroleum
fields still untouched in such places
as Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
