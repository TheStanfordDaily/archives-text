## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 26 (UP). â€”President Truman today vetoed the
wool price bill as "a tragic mistake," and the Senate, strength
to override, surrendered and passed a substitute which the chief executive
said he would sign.
It was the third major veto which Mr. Truman had fired at Congress

: in 10 days but this time neither
! House nor Senate could muster the
! votes fo nullify the veto and make
the act law.
The President called the wool bill
"a blow to our leadership in world
i affairs," the fear voiced previously
by Secretary of State George C.
Marshall who had warned that it
would undermine the Geneva In
ternational Trade Conference.
The substitute, which the House
is expected to accept reluctantly,
would establish price supports
through 1948 at the 1946 level and
permit the government to sell its
460,000,000 pound surplus wool pile
at any price necessary to compete
j with foreign wool. It was spon

sored by Sen. Edward V. Robert
son, R., Wyo.
