## 'Dead Quarter?' 
### 
Summer quarter is vacation time. Those of us who must
work or go to classes during these three months have to take
our vacations in small portions—one afternoon this week,
perhaps Satufday and Sunday next week. When we can get
away from the campus, those few hours seem short and fleet
ing. Consequently, we feel that we must take full advantage
of our free time, we must hurry to and hurry from the beach
or picnic spot —we and the other million and a half inhabitants
of the Bay Area.
This year summertime promises to be even more dan
gerous than before. California has an enormously increased
population, tourists have come in droves, and automobiles and
roads are generally in poorer condition than they have been
since before the war. All this adds up to the fact—a cold,
unchangeable, gruesome fact—that a great number of people
are going to be killed on our highways during the next few
months.
Already one Stanford student has been hospitalized and
four others in an automobile wreck. In another col
lision last Saturday, one man was seriously hurt and three
others were cut and bruised in a rear-end crash on campus.
In Northern California last weekend 14 persons were killed
in traffic accidents.
Perhaps there is little or nothing we can do to prevent
others from getting killed. But there is something we can do
to save our own skins—that is to drive as if everyone else on
the road is a damn fool, a maniac on wheels.
Next weekend is a four day holiday. Roads will be even
deadlier than usual. Even more caution will be necessary.
Every quarter we here at Stanford have a dead week—dead
5n the sense that no exams or social affairs are given. Is sum
mer quarter going to be known as "dead quarter"—the quar
ter which ends with one or more of us six feet under?
