Mark Twain had a childhood friend who was fond of saying,
"You tell me whar a man gits his corn-pone, en I'll tell you what his
'pinions is." This year I'd alter that statement to go, "You tell me
what a man's 'pinions is, en I'll tell you ef he kin speak them."
I have a notion that less people can say what they want to now
than at any time since the American Revolution. This doesn't just
apply to Stanford, where criticism of the administration or faculty is
taboo and where Herbert Hoover is an irreproachable household god,
but to the whole United States.
There's freedom of speech in America, but the freedom seems to
be extending itself to fewer people alljhe time. A couple of years ago
several liberal commentators had radio jobs. They're out now. There
was also a time when a few enlightened columnists could get their
copy in print. Try to find it now. No, those days are gone, the days
when truth and prismatic speculation weren't a crime, and I'm just
hoping they're not gone forever.
With Big Business free enough now to run the show for every
body else, most of the springs of news are gradually getting to be run
by less people. Free enterprise, helped by a Republican Congress
which doesn't give a hoot for the average citizen, is on the way in,
and free speech is on the way out. Oh, of course, a newspaper may
print an occasional letter from a left-winger, and Thomas Stokes might
come through uncut once in a while, but mostly your opinions are being
shaped by very limited and rigid points of view. Truth is taking a hell
of a beating.
That's why the recent red-hunt in America seems to me just a
cleverly-contrived stunt to take your attention away from the more
serious dangers going on at the same time. And while the witch
doctors dance and shout, that drowning noise of human rights and civil
liberties going down the drain isn't heard at all.
Communism is being branded as the only universal menace. But
remember that in Germany one of the first steps toward the crowning of
Nazism was red-hunting. Remember, too, that Labor in Germany was
one of the first big groups to get the hatchet. But apparently, right
now in America, we're willing to let the NAM do to us what Thyssen
and Co. did to the Germans.
Communism in America is an opponent, a rival, but it is not a
threat. It could never be the threat that fascism is right this minute.
Fascism is the herring to watch out for, and it's not red.
But while the sources of news dry up and wither, nobody com
plains. And as honesty and candor fester and die, not enough people
give a damn. As long as the corn-pone is on the table, nobody worries
about the dynamite in the fire.

Nazism was red-hunting. Remember, too, that Labor in Germany was
one of the first big groups to get the hatchet. But apparently, right
now in America, we're willing to let the NAM do to us what Thyssen
and Co. did to the Germans.
Communism in America is an opponent, a rival, but it is not a
threat. It could never be the threat that fascism is right this minute.
Fascism is the herring to watch out for, and it's not red.
But while the sources of news dry up and wither, nobody com
plains. And as honesty and candor fester and die, not enough people
give a damn. As long as the corn-pone is on the table, nobody worries
about the dynamite in the fire.
Mark Twain had a childhood friend who was fond of saying,
"You tell me whar a man gits his corn-pone, en I'll tell you what his
'pinions is." This year I'd alter that statement to go, "You tell me
what a man's 'pinions is, en I'll tell you ef he kin speak them."
I have a notion that less people can say what they want to now
than at any time since the American Revolution. This doesn't just
apply to Stanford, where criticism of the administration or faculty is
taboo and where Herbert Hoover is an irreproachable household god,
but to the whole United States.
There's freedom of speech in America, but the freedom seems to
be extending itself to fewer people alljhe time. A couple of years ago
several liberal commentators had radio jobs. They're out now. There
was also a time when a few enlightened columnists could get their
copy in print. Try to find it now. No, those days are gone, the days
when truth and prismatic speculation weren't a crime, and I'm just
hoping they're not gone forever.
With Big Business free enough now to run the show for every
body else, most of the springs of news are gradually getting to be run
by less people. Free enterprise, helped by a Republican Congress
which doesn't give a hoot for the average citizen, is on the way in,
and free speech is on the way out. Oh, of course, a newspaper may
print an occasional letter from a left-winger, and Thomas Stokes might
come through uncut once in a while, but mostly your opinions are being
shaped by very limited and rigid points of view. Truth is taking a hell
of a beating.
That's why the recent red-hunt in America seems to me just a
cleverly-contrived stunt to take your attention away from the more
serious dangers going on at the same time. And while the witch
doctors dance and shout, that drowning noise of human rights and civil
liberties going down the drain isn't heard at all.
Communism is being branded as the only universal menace. But
remember that in Germany one of the first steps toward the crowning of
Nazism was red-hunting. Remember, too, that Labor in Germany was
one of the first big groups to get the hatchet. But apparently, right
now in America, we're willing to let the NAM do to us what Thyssen
