# Government Air Experts Debunk 'Flying Saucers'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. June 26 (UP).—
Conservatism has not marked all the
claims made about high-speed air
craft by Army and Navy aviation
spokesmen.
But they conceded today that they
have nothing in their areonautical
bag of tricks to equal the flying
saucers an amateur pilot "saw"
scooting across southwestern Wash
ington state at 1,200 miles an hour.
These "saucer-shaped" planes are
strictly out of this planet, military
experts agreed.
Kenneth Arnold, a flying fire-ex
tinguisher salesman from Boise, Ida.,
said he saw nine such vehicles zing
between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams
—a distance of 4;2 miles—in one
minute 42 seconds. He said, accord
ing to Jack Whitman, a Pendleton,
Ore., businessman to whom he re
counted his experience, that this was
"about 1,250 mph."
Aeronautical experts of the Army,
Navy, and National Advisory Com
mittee for Areonautics had these re
actions:
1. According to Arnold's figures,
the saucers would have been flying
1,480 miles an hour. He underesti
mated them.
2. On the other hand, Arnold said

he used a stop watch and so could
have misjudged slightly. The ex
perts said the only possible way to
measure the speed of such aircraft—
if any existed—would be with radar.
The naked eye could not track them.
3. The fastest man has ever flown
is 647 miles an hour, registered by
Army Air Forces Col. Albert Boyd
during a test run at Muroc Army
Air Base, California, in a P-80. He
later set an official world record of
G23.8 mph.
4. Sound travels about 760 miles
an hour, a considerable bit under
the estimated speed of the flying
saucers, and engineers thus far have
not built a plane that has got even
near sonic speed. The Bell ES-1 is
designed for 1,700 mph but to date
it has never flown more than eight
tenths the speed of sound at about
30,000 feet. Because sound travels
slower at higher altitude, the ES-l's
top speed thus far has probably been
about 600 or 620 mph.
5. If Arnold saw what he thought
he saw—he said "I must believe my
eyes"—the planes were not Ameri
can. A theory that they were rock
ets got no credence either. The ex
perts Said rockets don't fly in forma
tion.
