The Editor, Sir:
Our friend Dick (Arnold) was
of course, referring to buddy Ted
dy (Roosevelt) rather than Frank
ie, when he dished out that nice
compliment in paragraph two ol
his June 23 Bull Session, wasn't
he? If not I was certainly much
relieved to note in today's Daily
that "The opinions expressed in
Bull Session do not necessarily
represent the views of The Daily.'

The Editor, Sir:
Last week we Encina hashers
became penguins. Why? Because
we are now wearing ties and white
shirts whenever we hash. For
women's mess halls that might be
a good idea, but in a men's hall I
can't see it.
Our main complaint arises from
the discomfort the gel-up causes
us during this hot weather so be
coming of California. We chal
lenge anyone to cinch up a tie
against his throat and stand on his
feet for 45 minutes over a hot
steam line ladling out food, or run
ning between tables and the kitch-*
en with trays of dirty dishes.
This farce costume make-up has
been attributed to an order by the
head of the campus dining halls.
To save red tape complaining to
that party we hope this note will
bring the desired results. T-shirts
and apron are just as neat and
clean-appearing as penguin suits.
