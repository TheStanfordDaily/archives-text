This is a plea for tolerance.
That's one word we haven't been
using enough of late, although it
is a good word, one that has a
clearly definable meaning. It isn't
vague or subject to conflicting in
terpretations. It means allowing
the other fellow to think, speak,
and act as he pleases so long as he
doesn't trample on the well-being
of the majority—and, as in crimi
nal law, it is presumed that he is
innocent of such a charge until
proven guilty.
Perhaps the widespread con
tempt for tolerance that exists to
day in all parts of the world is a
phenomenon arising out of the
war. The same attitude existed
after World War I. you know, al
though most of us know of it only
through our reading. In words of
one syllable, there was a witch
hunt. It didn't do anybody any
good, individually or collectively.
We are well on the way toward
doing it all over again. In Con
gress we have the Thomas (for
merly Dies) committee on un-
American activities; here in Cali
fornia we have the Tenney com
mittee.
Such groups are not wholly bad;
in fact they fill a definite need be
cause, like it or not, there ARE
disloyal individuals and disloyal
groups working toward the over

throw of the American political
system. But such committees are
the perfect instrument for publici
ty, and shortsighted men are using
them for that purpose.
These men work under the phi
losophy that any publicity is good
publicity, no matter what is said.
So they engage in witch hunts.
They engage in what can only be
termed persecution of innocent
people. They smoke out a few of
the guilty, yes, and are to be con
gratulated for doing so—but it is
not right for the clean to be point
ed out with the unclean.
One possible solution has oc
curred to me; it might be best to
make the actions of Congression
al committees anonymous. That
would be a drastic innovation—but
would it be bad? If the chairman
of a committee knew that he was
not going to get his picture in the
paper every time he made slan
derous statements on the floor of
Congress — where he is protected
from prosecution by an absolute
privilege—he might be a bit more
careful about what he said.
But that is only one of many
facets of our growing intolerance.
Another is a growing narrow
mindedness in Congress epitomized
in the move to outlaw the Commu
nist party by indirection. Granted,
Communism is completely alien to

all that the vast majority of Amer
icans desire, and would not hesi
tate to overthrow the government
by force if the opportunity pre
sented itself.
But aside from the Bill of Rights
there are practical considerations
that have been ignored. Some of
our best brains—men whose loy
alty is above reproach—are against
driving the Communists under
ground by outlawing them. J. Ed
gar Hoover himself says that it
would make it twice as difficult to
watch ihem.
Then, too, history has shown
that suppression never works for
long. The Romans found that for
every Christian they threw to the
lions, two converts were made.
The Emperor Constantino —a prac
tical politician but NOT a Chris
tian—solved the problem by com
bining elements of the Christian
and the pagan, and CALLING it
"Christian." Then he issued an
edict that all his subjects would be
"Christians" or corpses. Thus he
recognized that Christianity could
not be stamped out with force—
and that's true of every other fa
natical movement.
Some time back Andrei Vishin
sky remarked, "We can't afford to
allow tolerance; we paid too much
for it." I hope»that never will be
come a basic American trait.

We are well on the way toward
doing it all over again. In Con
gress we have the Thomas (for
merly Dies) committee on un-
American activities; here in Cali
fornia we have the Tenney com
mittee.
Such groups are not wholly bad;
in fact they fill a definite need be
cause, like it or not, there ARE
disloyal individuals and disloyal
groups working toward the over

throw of the American political
system. But such committees are
the perfect instrument for publici
ty, and shortsighted men are using
them for that purpose.
These men work under the phi
losophy that any publicity is good
publicity, no matter what is said.
So they engage in witch hunts.
They engage in what can only be
termed persecution of innocent
people. They smoke out a few of
the guilty, yes, and are to be con
gratulated for doing so—but it is
not right for the clean to be point
ed out with the unclean.
One possible solution has oc
curred to me; it might be best to
make the actions of Congression
al committees anonymous. That
would be a drastic innovation—but
would it be bad? If the chairman
of a committee knew that he was
not going to get his picture in the
paper every time he made slan
derous statements on the floor of
Congress — where he is protected
from prosecution by an absolute
privilege—he might be a bit more
careful about what he said.
But that is only one of many
facets of our growing intolerance.
Another is a growing narrow
mindedness in Congress epitomized
in the move to outlaw the Commu
nist party by indirection. Granted,
Communism is completely alien to

all that the vast majority of Amer
icans desire, and would not hesi
tate to overthrow the government
by force if the opportunity pre
sented itself.
But aside from the Bill of Rights
there are practical considerations
that have been ignored. Some of
our best brains—men whose loy
alty is above reproach—are against
driving the Communists under
ground by outlawing them. J. Ed
gar Hoover himself says that it
would make it twice as difficult to
watch ihem.
Then, too, history has shown
that suppression never works for
long. The Romans found that for
every Christian they threw to the
lions, two converts were made.
The Emperor Constantino —a prac
tical politician but NOT a Chris
tian—solved the problem by com
bining elements of the Christian
and the pagan, and CALLING it
"Christian." Then he issued an
edict that all his subjects would be
"Christians" or corpses. Thus he
recognized that Christianity could
not be stamped out with force—
and that's true of every other fa
natical movement.
Some time back Andrei Vishin
sky remarked, "We can't afford to
allow tolerance; we paid too much
for it." I hope»that never will be
come a basic American trait.
This is a plea for tolerance.
That's one word we haven't been
using enough of late, although it
is a good word, one that has a
clearly definable meaning. It isn't
vague or subject to conflicting in
terpretations. It means allowing
the other fellow to think, speak,
and act as he pleases so long as he
doesn't trample on the well-being
of the majority—and, as in crimi
nal law, it is presumed that he is
innocent of such a charge until
proven guilty.
Perhaps the widespread con
tempt for tolerance that exists to
day in all parts of the world is a
phenomenon arising out of the
war. The same attitude existed
after World War I. you know, al
though most of us know of it only
through our reading. In words of
one syllable, there was a witch
hunt. It didn't do anybody any
good, individually or collectively.
