# Art Gallery Presents Wright's Architecture
## 
### 
A far cry from the traditional vine-covcred cottage, the exhibit of
functional architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright currently on display in
the Stanford Art Gallery highlights the use of spacial relationships in
their most logical form.
Emphasizing Mr. Wright's ideal of the "organic use of material and

intimate relationship with the land
scape," the home of Dr. Paul Hanna
of the Education Department is a
characteristic low-lying structure
situated among several giant oak
trees. The moveable accordion
walls, covered by contrasting high
and low ceilings, add to the feeling
of spaciousness.
In addition to the spotlighted
Hanna home, a pictorial history of
Mr. Wright's development is pre
sented, beginning with the more
conventional liickox house, which
still shows the roof pointing upward
from a typical mid-western design.
WRIGHT'S HOME
Mr. Wright's own Wisconsin home,
Taliesin I, follows the architect's
rule that a house should never be
"on anything" by being a combina
tion of stone and wood of the hills.
Complete accord with this "of
ness" was achieved in the construc
tion of the famous Kaufmann
house—Falling Water—in Bear Run,
Pa. Springing from rocky ledges
above a stream, the house is marked
by cantilevered concrete slabs which
make up the living space.
VERTICAL ARCHITECTURE
The break with tradition vertical
architecture came with the building
of the Robie house in Illinois when
Mr. Wright first began to empha
size the principle of horizontal
elongation. By using walls only as
a method of insuring privacy, not of
breaking up the whole into cubes, he
was able to insure the utmost of
space.
Another tradition-shattering in
novation was set forth by Mr. Wright
in the home of Mrs. George Madi
son Millard, which is pictured among
the eucalyptus trees of Pasadena.
By means of pre-cast concrete blocks,
decorated in a simple although
somewhat exotic manner and re
inforced by a web of metal rods,
Mr. Wright achieved a structure en
tirely suited to its semi-tropical set
ting.—Lawrence.
