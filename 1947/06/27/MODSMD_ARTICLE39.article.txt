# Players Show Experience In Chekov Skits
## 
### 
The Stanford Players opened their
summer season with a finished in
terpretation of four Chekov one-act
plays last night. The three farces
gave Stanford's actors-in-residence
an opportunity to demonsti'ate the
value of their expei'ience.
The success of a farce depends
much more upon exaggerated com
mand of technique than upon feel
ing. A farce is the simplest form to
interpret; one of the most difficult
to interpret with finish. Experienced
technique is essential and the three
full - time actors gave convincing
demonstration of their ability.
VAUGIIAN RANTS
Each of the three leading per
formers was given three parts.
Walker Vaughan played first in the
role of a pompous, harassed bank
chairman, then as a deaf, stubborn
farmer, and finally as a thundering
boor ranted across the stage to the
limits of exaggeration.
William Vorcnberg achieved his
best performance as the simpering
hypochondriac who forgets about
his intentions in the excitement of
the situation.
•SWAN SONG'
The one-act tragedy "Swan Song"
is a dangerous and difficult expei'i
ment for a university theater. Roy
Poole is perhaps the only Stanford
student-actor capable of holding the
audience through a play which is
largely soliloquy with complete ab
sence of action. He is required to
pronounce the storm scene from
King Lear and excerpts from both
Hamlet and Othello. It would have
been a pitfall for a lesser actor to
overplay or sentimentalize an essen
tially sentimental theme. Poole
plays the part of an aging provincial
actor who has sacrificed his life to
the hollowness of a barren stage and
unfeeling audiences with dignity
and a powerful, resonant voice.
The "Swan Song" is more suited
to Chekov's short-story technique
than his theatrical presentation. The
aged actor achieves self-insight into
a tragically ironic situation, drops
from exaltation to despair, as he
perceives disillusionment and fail
ure. The situation rather than be
ing dramatic is philosophical.—Fish
