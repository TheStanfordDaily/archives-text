LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., June 26
(UP). — President Truman assured
the world today on the second
birthday of the United Nations that
America will support the UN to the
utmost and "will not be discouraged
by temporary setbacks and delays."
The President joined the heads of
state of Great Britain, France, and
China in a historic worldwide
broadcast marking the second an
niversary of the signing of the UN
Charter by 50 nations at the San
Francisco conference.
"They will not be discouraged by
temporary setbacks and delays," he
said. "... I renew the pledge of
our utmost to ensure the success of
the United Nations. We shall do
our part."
Soviet Premier Josef Stalin did
not participate in the unprecedented
transcribed broadcast, but Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko expressed for the Soviet
Union a hope that in the future the
UN "will find itself sufficiently
strong to overcome defects . . ." and
go on to success.
