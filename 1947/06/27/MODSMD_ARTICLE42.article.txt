## Card Stunts 
### 
Comes the revolution and things
will really be different. But mean
time here's enough to change your
faith in orthodox sports columns, or
at least so we think.
It might be the heat, and then
again it might be us, but instead of
moaning or prognosticating about
the latest athletic events of the sea
son, we have decided to devote this
space to a brand new cause—to ex
plaining a couple of sports oddities
that have teen plaguing us for some
time.
SOUTHPAWS ANALYZED
For instance, during baseball sea
son the term "southpaw" appears
with remarkable frequency, so we
asked some of our friends if they
really knew why a left-handed per
son is called a southpaw. The an
swers were amazingly varied, but
none really satisfactory.
We then consulted encyclopedias,
almanacs, and whatever else you
can check around the Farm, but had
no luck. We even asked Dan Ends
ley, the sports authority hereabouts,
but his answer, too, was vague and
flimsy.
SUN'S RAYS AVERTED
If by now you are hanging in sus
pense—after the buildup, you should
be—here is the only scientific an
swer that's any good. It's simply
that most baseball fields are laid out
with home plate toward the west so
that the sun will not be in the bat
ter's eyes.
And with that type of a layout, the
pitcher faces west and his left hand
is toward the south.
"Enough!" you say, crying for
mercy? Not on your life, unless you
can tell us why "love" means "noth
ing" in tennis. After all, we've
heard few cases of unlovely beha
vior in tennis.
EGG AND I CLASH
Without further ado it seems only
right to point out that the word
"love" is the anglicized version of
the French "l'oeuf," and that means
egg. In France, "l'oeuf" is slang for
zero or nothing because the symbol
"0" looks so much like an egg.
And so much for l'amour. We now
point a question at some of the
horsier set here at Stanford. Which
do you think can run faster —a horse
or a man?
Keep your bets in your pockets,
for we've got something up our
sleeve that'll stunt you. Cards. And
why not—this is Card Stunts!
MAN BEATS HORSE
In a short race we admit a horse
would win, and by plenty. For in
stance, back in 1924, a horse, Chidio
11, ran 105 miles in 12 hours. Fur
ther back, in 1882, a man by (he
name of Saunders had run 120 miles
in just under 23 hours. The horse
was faster.
The real payoff came in 1924
when a six-day race was staged in
London between a race horse. Black
Jack, and a Marathoner, George
Hall. The race got off to a good
start, but on the fifth day Black Jack
was all in and had to be withdrawn
from the race.
Poor horse, for at that time Hall
was 15 miles ahead and going strong.

"love" is the anglicized version of
the French "l'oeuf," and that means
egg. In France, "l'oeuf" is slang for
zero or nothing because the symbol
"0" looks so much like an egg.
And so much for l'amour. We now
point a question at some of the
horsier set here at Stanford. Which
do you think can run faster —a horse
or a man?
Keep your bets in your pockets,
for we've got something up our
sleeve that'll stunt you. Cards. And
why not—this is Card Stunts!
MAN BEATS HORSE
In a short race we admit a horse
would win, and by plenty. For in
stance, back in 1924, a horse, Chidio
11, ran 105 miles in 12 hours. Fur
ther back, in 1882, a man by (he
name of Saunders had run 120 miles
in just under 23 hours. The horse
was faster.
The real payoff came in 1924
when a six-day race was staged in
London between a race horse. Black
Jack, and a Marathoner, George
Hall. The race got off to a good
start, but on the fifth day Black Jack
was all in and had to be withdrawn
from the race.
Poor horse, for at that time Hall
was 15 miles ahead and going strong.
"I have a man in the balcony, doc
tor . .
Comes the revolution and things
will really be different. But mean
time here's enough to change your
faith in orthodox sports columns, or
at least so we think.
It might be the heat, and then
again it might be us, but instead of
moaning or prognosticating about
the latest athletic events of the sea
son, we have decided to devote this
space to a brand new cause—to ex
plaining a couple of sports oddities
that have teen plaguing us for some
time.
SOUTHPAWS ANALYZED
For instance, during baseball sea
son the term "southpaw" appears
with remarkable frequency, so we
asked some of our friends if they
really knew why a left-handed per
son is called a southpaw. The an
swers were amazingly varied, but
none really satisfactory.
We then consulted encyclopedias,
almanacs, and whatever else you
can check around the Farm, but had
no luck. We even asked Dan Ends
ley, the sports authority hereabouts,
but his answer, too, was vague and
flimsy.
SUN'S RAYS AVERTED
If by now you are hanging in sus
pense—after the buildup, you should
be—here is the only scientific an
swer that's any good. It's simply
that most baseball fields are laid out
with home plate toward the west so
that the sun will not be in the bat
ter's eyes.
And with that type of a layout, the
pitcher faces west and his left hand
is toward the south.
"Enough!" you say, crying for
mercy? Not on your life, unless you
can tell us why "love" means "noth
ing" in tennis. After all, we've
heard few cases of unlovely beha
vior in tennis.
EGG AND I CLASH
Without further ado it seems only
right to point out that the word
"love" is the anglicized version of
the French "l'oeuf," and that means
egg. In France, "l'oeuf" is slang for
zero or nothing because the symbol
