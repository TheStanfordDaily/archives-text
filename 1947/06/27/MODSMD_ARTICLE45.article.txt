three-bagger with a single.
Joe DiMaggio got the only dam
aging clout off Coleman, a tremen
dous homer into the upper deck of
the left field bleachers.
The Pirates also got some good
pitching for a change when Ernie
Bonham turned in his second straight
shutout, scattering 6 hits in an 8 to 0
victory at Chicago. Only one man
reached third base on big Ernie.
Ralph Kiner set the batting tempo
for the Pirates with a two-run homel
and a single. He drove in four runs.
The homer was his 14th of the season.
The Brooklyn Dodgers edged into
the National League lead tonight by
defeating the Boston Braves, 8 to 6,
on some fine relief work by Ralph
Branca, who halted a live run Brave
rally in the eighth frame.
