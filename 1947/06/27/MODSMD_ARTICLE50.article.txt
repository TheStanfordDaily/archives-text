# PCC in for Beating By Big Nine Squad
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Shades of the Rose Bowl seep into Berkeley's Edwards Sta
dium at 2 p.m. tomorrow when the top-heavy favored Big Nine
faces a hand-picked Pacific Coast Conference track squad in the
seventh annual meeting between the two circuits.
The poor Coasters are in for a beating; there's no getting

around it! Despite the
of USC's Me! Patton, interest on the ■'
meet still focuses on Herb McKen- ;
ley, the Illini racer, who last week 1
toured a :46.2 quarter mile at Salt
Lake City.
"McKenley's chances to run under j
46 seconds are very favorable, espe- '
eially if the weather and track con- j
ditions are as they were in Salt |
Lake City last week," Leo Johnson, |
Illinois coach, declared on his arri
val in the Bay Region.
McKENLEY VERSATILE
"Herb is quite a modest lad and j
considei's everyone as having a bet
ter chance than he of winning," I
Johnson added. "He can run every
thing from a hundred yards to a |
mile, but we'll concentrate on the j
220 tomorrow."
Spectator interest for tomorrow's I
meet is sky high, indicative of a
10,000 gathering of the curious who
have been saturated with reams of
copy on world records and speed of ,
foot McKenley.
Of course, we'll have our own en- '
trants, meaning A 1 Snyder, high |
hurdler with a best mark of : 14.3, !
and Larry Hoff, quarter miler.
WEST COULD SURPRISE
On paper, the Midwestern con
tingent is capable of annexing 14j
out of the 16 events. The West will
be doomed froiji the start, but being
men and sensitive to such criti- :
cisms, could honorably give the Big
Nine an unforeseen battle.
Aside from the previously ack
nowledged McKenley, the visitors
are loaded with potential first place
winners. Baccalaureate behemoths
like Michigan's Chuck Fonville, 54- j
foot shot-putter; Fortune Gordien of
Minnesota, capable of 175 feet in the j
discus; and Northwestern's Bill Por
ter. a :14.0 high hurdler, would be j
welcomed joyously by the PCC.
JAVELIN OMITTED
Both squads have been in train- '
ing on the Berkeley oval throughout
the week and will be in creditable
shape come tomorrow afternoon.
The loss of Patton by the PCC is a
tough one. indeed, but Cal's Donnie j
Anderson can conceivably take up i
the slack.
In lieu of the javelin, the loop j
promoters have scheduled a 480-
yard high hurdle shuttle relay. Tab
ulation of points will be on a "5-3-
1" basis and each conference will
be limited to three contestants per
event.
Chief subject of interest is, of
course, McKenley, but there are
some who predict the semblance of
a record-breaking performance by
discus tosser Gordien, the Gopher j
giant. Gordien has thrown the dis- j
cus past the 173-foot mark, which |
is farther than some people who j
profess a braggadocio of throwing >
the javelin.
Better not place those Rose Bowl
memories in the ash can because
"you ain't seen nothin' yet." The Big |
Niners figure to atomize the West
something horrible for their second
meet triumph since 1942, when the
PCC receipted for a 69 .? to 57'j
win.

In lieu of the javelin, the loop j
promoters have scheduled a 480-
yard high hurdle shuttle relay. Tab
ulation of points will be on a "5-3-
1" basis and each conference will
be limited to three contestants per
event.
Chief subject of interest is, of
course, McKenley, but there are
some who predict the semblance of
a record-breaking performance by
discus tosser Gordien, the Gopher j
giant. Gordien has thrown the dis- j
cus past the 173-foot mark, which |
is farther than some people who j
profess a braggadocio of throwing >
the javelin.
Better not place those Rose Bowl
memories in the ash can because
"you ain't seen nothin' yet." The Big |
Niners figure to atomize the West
something horrible for their second
meet triumph since 1942, when the
PCC receipted for a 69 .? to 57'j
win.
Shades of the Rose Bowl seep into Berkeley's Edwards Sta
dium at 2 p.m. tomorrow when the top-heavy favored Big Nine
faces a hand-picked Pacific Coast Conference track squad in the
seventh annual meeting between the two circuits.
The poor Coasters are in for a beating; there's no getting

around it! Despite the
of USC's Me! Patton, interest on the ■'
meet still focuses on Herb McKen- ;
ley, the Illini racer, who last week 1
toured a :46.2 quarter mile at Salt
Lake City.
"McKenley's chances to run under j
46 seconds are very favorable, espe- '
eially if the weather and track con- j
ditions are as they were in Salt |
Lake City last week," Leo Johnson, |
Illinois coach, declared on his arri
val in the Bay Region.
McKENLEY VERSATILE
"Herb is quite a modest lad and j
considei's everyone as having a bet
ter chance than he of winning," I
Johnson added. "He can run every
thing from a hundred yards to a |
mile, but we'll concentrate on the j
220 tomorrow."
Spectator interest for tomorrow's I
meet is sky high, indicative of a
10,000 gathering of the curious who
have been saturated with reams of
copy on world records and speed of ,
foot McKenley.
Of course, we'll have our own en- '
trants, meaning A 1 Snyder, high |
hurdler with a best mark of : 14.3, !
and Larry Hoff, quarter miler.
WEST COULD SURPRISE
On paper, the Midwestern con
tingent is capable of annexing 14j
out of the 16 events. The West will
be doomed froiji the start, but being
men and sensitive to such criti- :
cisms, could honorably give the Big
Nine an unforeseen battle.
Aside from the previously ack
nowledged McKenley, the visitors
are loaded with potential first place
winners. Baccalaureate behemoths
like Michigan's Chuck Fonville, 54- j
foot shot-putter; Fortune Gordien of
Minnesota, capable of 175 feet in the j
discus; and Northwestern's Bill Por
ter. a :14.0 high hurdler, would be j
welcomed joyously by the PCC.
JAVELIN OMITTED
Both squads have been in train- '
ing on the Berkeley oval throughout
the week and will be in creditable
shape come tomorrow afternoon.
The loss of Patton by the PCC is a
tough one. indeed, but Cal's Donnie j
Anderson can conceivably take up i
the slack.
