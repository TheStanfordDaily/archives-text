### 
Three Stanford professors will be in a group of forty scientists who
will make a scientific survey of Bikini atoll this summer, a Navy de
partment spokesman reported yesterday.
They are Dr. D. M. Whitaker. Dean of the School of Biological
Sciences; Professor Lawrence M. Blinks, Director of the Hopkins Marine

Station; and Professor William Gil
bert Smith, noted authority on ma
rine algae.
The survey mission is being un
dertaken by the Navy, with the co
operation of the War Department,
at the request of the joint chiefs
of staff.
The scientists will collect bio
logical and geological specimens
and make radiological studies of
land, water, and all manner of or

ganisms. Divers will be sent down
to report on sunken ships, ,and a
hard-rock crew will drill for cores
on the atoll, the spokesman said.
Considerable interest will be at
tached to the expedition since Bi
kini is the only harbor which has
been subjected to atomic attack,
hence the only laboratory where
defensive measures for harbors may
be profitably studied, he concluded.
