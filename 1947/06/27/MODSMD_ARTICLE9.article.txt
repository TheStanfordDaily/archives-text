# Molotov Arrives in Paris For Three-Power Confab
## 
### 
PARIS, June 26 (UP).—Russian Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov arrived today, ahead of schedule, for the momentous
Big Three conference tomorrow on the plan of Secretary of State
George C. Marshall for European recovery.
British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin is due here about noon

tomorrow and it is expected that the
first session of the French-British-
Russian conference, to which all Eu
rope looks with hope tempered by
fear of disagreement, will start in
the so-called Parakeet Room of the
Foreign Office about 4 p.m.
The conference is expected to last
from four days to one week.
RUSSIA MAY CO-OPERATE
Long before it is over it may be
apparent whether there is a chance
to get Russia and its satellite coun
tries to co-operate with Western
European nations on the history
making Marshall plan.
The alternative is an inevitable
division of Europe for months to
come at least into Eastern and West
ern blocs, distrustful of each other,
with Germany—the economic heart
of Europe—in chaos between them.
Molotov, whether or not he feels
there is a chance of agreement on
the Marshall plan under conditions
acceptable to the Kremlin, came
here with a major delegation.
RUSSIAN EXPERTS BUSY
Two plane loads of experts from
Moscow arrived Tuesday and have
been busy ever since at the Russian
embassy, aided by its strong stafT, in
preparing for the Big Three talks.
What Molotov has in mind for the
meeting remained completely un
known. But diplomatic quarters did
not believe there was a chance that
Russia would recede an inch from
its present policy, which is to build
up its own position in Western Eu
rope and keep a grip on its satellites.
