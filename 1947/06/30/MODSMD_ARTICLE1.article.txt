# Paris Conference Hits Snag; French Press Hits Molotov
## Bevin Rumored Getting Tough 
### 
PARIS, June 29 (UP).—British
Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin is
ready to present to Russia an ulti
mative demand for a yes or no an
swer on its willingness to get to
work on the Marshall plan for
European recovery, diplomatic quar
ters said tonight.
The Big Three conference which
met here Friday to consider from
the European viewpoint the plan of
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall for Europe's rehabilitation was
near deadlock.
MOLOTOV OPPOSES PLAN
Russian Foreign Minister Viache
slav Molotov has refused adamantly
to endorse the plan until he is as
sured that any aid given Europe
will be without political conditions
which would weaken the grip of the
Soviet Union on Eastern Europe,
Conference circles reported.
Bevin and French Foreign Minis
ter Georges Bidault are working
closely together and they are ready
to proceed with the plan with or
without Russian participation.
ECONOMIC PLAN REFUSED
As of last night Molotov had re- I
fused flatly to join any over-all I
economic plan unless the United
States first guaranteed that it would i
actually back up the Marshall plan'
with financial and economic aid and
secondly that Russia's own hands i
would be left free politically and '
economically, well informed sources
said.
Moscow broadcasts, mostly by
Tass in its Paris dispatches, had
said that Russia was opposed to any
all-embracing European recovery
plan because it would infringe the
sovereignty of individual states—
meaning those in the Russian sphere.
Tass said the Big Three alone should
start considering the Marshall plan
and invite other countries to join
them.
