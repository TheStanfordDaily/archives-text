# AFL Condemns New Law; Predicts Strike Increase
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 29 (UP).— AFL General Counsel Joseph
Padway predicted tonight that the new Taft-Hartley Labor Reform
Law would produce a "twenty-fold" increase in strikes that would
put the National Labor Relations Board five years behind in its
worok.
He indicated that the AFL was prepared to take the lead in a

court fight against the*
statute. And he hinted that some
of its provisions might be ignored
deliberately by AFL unions to hasten
a test of its constitutionality.
STRIKES FORECAST
Padway made his forecast of
countrywide strikes at the end of a
two-day conference with some 100
AFL attorneys. They mapped pre
liminary plans for court action to be
presented to the union's interna
tional officers at a meeting here
July 9.
Padway said a widespread out
break of strikes was likely in order
to get labor-management disputes
before the NLRB as quickly as pos
sible. He said these cases probably
would pile up so fast that within a
year, the federal agency would be
encountering a five-year work back
log.
FORCE WON'T WORK
After talking over the law's com
plex provisions with AFL lawyers
representing most of the major mem- ,
ber unions, Padway told newsmen |
that these general conclusions had
been reached:
1. There is nothing in the Taft-
Hartley Act that could force John
L. Lewis' United Mine Workers to
return to the soft coal fields when
their official 10-day vacation ends
July 8. Government operation of j
the mines expires tomorrow.
NO CONTRACTS SEEN
2. Some lawyers felt that certain
unions could get along without any j
contracts with employers, and thus j
could bypass the new statute. These
would be the very strong craft
unions, such as tiie International
Typographical Union.
3. A legal fight probably will be J
made against the law's restrictions
on union health and welfare funds. ■
4. Most of the lawyers were ex- j
tremely critical of the provisions re- j
quiring union leaders to file affida
vits wilh the NLRB declaring they I
are not Communists. Failure to do |
so would deprvie their unions of
bargaining rights.

FORCE WON'T WORK
After talking over the law's com
plex provisions with AFL lawyers
representing most of the major mem- ,
ber unions, Padway told newsmen |
that these general conclusions had
been reached:
1. There is nothing in the Taft-
Hartley Act that could force John
L. Lewis' United Mine Workers to
return to the soft coal fields when
their official 10-day vacation ends
July 8. Government operation of j
the mines expires tomorrow.
NO CONTRACTS SEEN
2. Some lawyers felt that certain
unions could get along without any j
contracts with employers, and thus j
could bypass the new statute. These
would be the very strong craft
unions, such as tiie International
Typographical Union.
3. A legal fight probably will be J
made against the law's restrictions
on union health and welfare funds. ■
4. Most of the lawyers were ex- j
tremely critical of the provisions re- j
quiring union leaders to file affida
vits wilh the NLRB declaring they I
are not Communists. Failure to do |
so would deprvie their unions of
bargaining rights.
