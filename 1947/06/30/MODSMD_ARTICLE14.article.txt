# Germans Hit Marshall Plan

### 
NUERNBERG, Germany, June 29
(UP). â€”Dr. Kuii Schumacher, lead
er of the German Social Democratic
party, said tonight that the Marshall
Plan for economic rehabilitation of
Europe was a good long - range
scheme but not the answer to the
immediate problem of a starving
Germany.
"It is good in that it forces the
European countries into activity, but
it is no answer to the immediate
problem," the fiery, one - armed
leader told 2,000 party delegates at
a congress here.
"We are in the midst of a civil
war not fought by bullets but by
food and bureaucratic means," he
said.
Groups of Europeans who are
viewing the plan as furtherance of
dollar imperialism ignore the fact
that Marshall said that America
does not want to impose her system
on any European country, Schuma
cher said.
An economically sound Europe
would be security for the United
States since "America recognizes the
danger of a world in which she is
the only prosperous country," he
said.
