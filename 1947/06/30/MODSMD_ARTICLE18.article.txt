DEBRECEN, Hungary, June 29
(UP). —Premier Lajos Dinnyes told
an audience of 25,000 to 30.000 in a
campaign speech today that aban
donment of the principle of private
property, which the Communists
advocate, would mean the end of
his Small Holders party and of Hun
gary itself.
"Not only the party, but also the
nation would dig its own grave if
Hungary followed the example of
other countries which do not stand
on the principle of private prop
erty," he said.
Dinnyes' speech, in this provin
cial town 21 miles from Romania,
opened the Small Holders party's
campaign for the fall elections.
Dinnyes became Premier recently
when Ferenc Nagy resigned on a
Swiss vacation in the midst of Com
munist charges that he was involved
in a conspiracy to install a "fascist"
government.
"The peasants arc willing to co
operate with the Marxist parties but
we are not and never will be Marx
ist ourselves," Istvan Dobi, the
Small Holders party chairman, said
in another speech.
Observers said they discerned
some "passive resistance" to the new
Small Holders leadership in that the
crowd was only a fraction of what
was anticipated.
