PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, June
29 (UP).â€”"Men of science feel the
only alternative to another war is
creation of a world government with
real power to enforce peace," a
spokesman for the Emergency Com
mittee of Atomic Scientists said to
day.
This is the committee of which
Albert Einstein is chairman.
The scientists said a new approach 1
toward formation of a world gov- !
ernment to control atomic energy is
necessary if war is to be prevented. |
"The American people must take
an active part in achieving such a
world settlement," the committee
said, "and must be prepared to
mobilize vajft resources on an ade
quate scale to help the peoples of
the world lift the levels of their eco
nomic life.
"The American people should un
derstand there is no easy path to
the accomplishment of these great
objectives; that in the long run, the j
creation of a supra-national govern
ment, with powers adequate to the
responsibility of maintaining the
peace, is necessary."
