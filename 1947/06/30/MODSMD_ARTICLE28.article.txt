# Senate Refuses Textbook Funds
## 
### 
California schools will not use the
"Building America" textbooks, Su
perintendent Roy E. Simpson of the
state education department conceded
yesterday. The Senate refused to
appropriate funds for the books in
the session that just ended.
The textbooks were denounced
by the Sons of the American Revo
lution as being pro-Russianâ€”but a
Soviet official of New York objected
to the books as being anti-Russian.
The Senate criticized the books as
presenting too favorable visws on
the social and political ways of life
in Russia.
