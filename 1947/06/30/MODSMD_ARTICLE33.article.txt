Lett. Leland Stanford, Jun
ior, from a portrait painted in
Paris shortly before his death.
Said to have been an unusually
promising youth especially in
terested in the arts and mechan
ical devices, he unexpectedly
died of typhoid fever in Flor
ence, Italy, a few weeks before
his 16th birthday. He had been
on a tour of European art cen
ters with his parents.
It was as a memorial to him
that Gov. and Mrs. Stanford
built the University which bears
their son's name.


Left. The Red Barn when it
was the focal point of the world's
greatest breeding and training
stock farm. It was here Gov.
Stanford exercised and trained
the world famous "Palo Alto"
and "Electioneer."Riding classes
are now held where the first
moving pictures of a horse in
motion were taken at the direc
tion of the Governor.


Belcw. The first University
Library following the earth
quake of 1906. It had been dedi
cated only six years before.

faculty on the right. The Governor had hoped to open the £
University the following year, but persistent difficulties de
layed the opening until four years later.
The eyes of the world were focused on Stanford's Palo 112



Bight. The twin trees for
which the town of Palo Alto was
named. Located on the south
bank of the San Francisquito
creek next to the railway bridge,
only one of the original Palo
Altos now remains. This engrav
ing, showing one of the loco
motives which brought fame
and wealth to Gov. Stanford,
was made in the 1890's.
