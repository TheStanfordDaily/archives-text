Lett. Leland Stanford, Jun
ior, from a portrait painted in
Paris shortly before his death.
Said to have been an unusually
promising youth especially in
terested in the arts and mechan
ical devices, he unexpectedly
died of typhoid fever in Flor
ence, Italy, a few weeks before
his 16th birthday. He had been
on a tour of European art cen
ters with his parents.
It was as a memorial to him
that Gov. and Mrs. Stanford
built the University which bears
their son's name.

was the focal point of the world's
greatest breeding and training

Stanford exercised and trained
the world famous "Palo Alto"
and "Electioneer."Riding classes
are now held where the first
moving pictures of a horse in
motion were taken at the direc
tion of the Governor.

Stanford's first president. Com

was the foremost authority of his
day on sea fauna, wrote chil
dren's books, and was recog

and administration.

brought Stanford through its
trying early days, remaining
President until 1913. He died in

1831, Dr. Jordan achieved wide

was the foremost authority of his
day on sea fauna, wrote chil

and administration.

President until 1913. He died in
his campus home in 1928.

railroad building a success. A
large number of record-setting
winners were developed on the
Farm.

died of typhoid fever in Flor

built the University which bears
their son's name.
