## A 						Man's Got to Eat 
### 
A recent issue of a Dartmouth publication contained an
article on "The Tired Veteran," which was apparently to the
effect that it might be more appropriate to describe the learn
ing processes there as "training" rather than "education." It
seems to distress the author that the veteran has returned to
college to get a diploma and get out. Personally, I would have
been surprised if anything else had been the result. A man's
got to make a living; if he has a family, the pressure is that
much more intense to get out in the world and get started.
The article concludes that the desire for security is dom
inant in the veteran; that he is seeing education as merely
.vocational training. That desire for security "is causing men
1o take short-cuts, to hole up with the "facts," and to shy
away . . . from the problems of life that students should at
least learn to recognize in a liberal arts college—the problems
that have no notebook answers but many possible personal
answers."
Noted in this article is the veteran's reluctance to "waste
time on campus activities, and his tendency to ignore the
"humanities." Why on earth should a grown man want to get
out to organize dances or rooting sections; what will incline
him to those "naive excursions into philosophy o'nights"
beloved of the freshman. As for the problems of life, the
veteran has probably already met and recognized more of
life's problems in the last few years than some of his teachers
have even read about. And, that he is alive today is a good
indication that G! Joe has managed to find a satisfactory
personal answer.
