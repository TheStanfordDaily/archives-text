## Bull Session

Probably you can't say that Stanford is as good a school as Colum
bia, and so it may offend General Mac-Arthur if I suggest that it would
be a good idea, while he is still in Japan and open to offers, to negotiate
with him to take over some kind of a job at this university. Columbia
has General Eisenhower signed up for its presidency, and you'd think
Mac Arthur would want to do at least as well as that, but maybe it
wouldn't hurt to send out a few feelers. I don't know what sort of
position we could line up for him since we are already pretty well
fixed with a Chancellor and a President, but maybe we could pump
up some new balloon which could float him around somewhere in the
same stratospheric layer as the Chancellorship and the Presidency.
How would Grand Vizier sound? Think Mac Arthur would go for that?
As I say, I don't know if we could close the deal, because with
Eisenhower running Columbia, getting a press notice every day in
the eastern newspapers and rounding up the country's choicest mag
nificoes every commencement, Mac Arthur might be upset over having
to stay out here where he would be doing well to get on a press wire
out of the Palo Alto Times
However, we could remind Mac Arthur that Eisenhower has one
eye on the Democrats while the other eye is winking at the Republicans,
and if Mac Arthur wants to get into the 1948 candidate business he'd
better hurry home and grab any kind of a job. Mac Arthur is as co
quettish about the White House right, now as Eisenhower, but when the
smart moment comes for him to drop the veil and stop peeking over
the fan, he ought to be someplace in the U.S. where they could get him
into a good photographer's. The redhot Republican press of the Bay
Area would always be ready to roll for him, and until he's ready to
hop out into the clearing he could always hide behind the Palo Alto
redwood.
At the same time we ought to caution Mac Arthur that a university
tower is a pretty high dive into political waters, and Eisenhower him
self ought to know that old Nicholas Murray Butler always thought he
was going to be President of the U.S. and never got out of Columbia.
In fact the only college presidents who ever made it were Wilson at
Princeton and James Garfield, who was once president of the Eclectic
Institute of Hiram, Ohio. Well, then Taft was Dean of the Law School
at Cincinnati, John Quincy Adams taught rhetoric at Harvard, and the
other Adams, Chester Arthur and McKinley all taught in small town
schools, but since none of these jobs could have had much to do with
their getting into the White House, perhaps Mac Arthur and Eisenhower
would do better to buy into some newspaper or settle down in Ohio or
Pennsylvania and work themselves up to governor or senator. Look
what happened to Conant at Harvard. Henry Luce sized him up as
just the right stature for the GOP nomination and went a little wild
over him in one issue of Time, but nobody paid any attention. Still,
it was done once by Wilson (we won't count Garfield), and the politi
cians have been nosing around college offices ever since, even though
Wilson had to work awhile as governor of New Jersey before they
could put him over.
Really, you want to know what an old army man wants to fool
around in college for anyway, and you wonder just what the college
can do to keep him busy and out of trouble, but I suppose Mac Arthur
might be able to find enough to do around here. I do know one job
the army's always been good at, though, and we could assign Mac-
Arthur first thing to getting somebody to clean up those lavatories on
the Quad.

up some new balloon which could float him around somewhere in the
same stratospheric layer as the Chancellorship and the Presidency.
How would Grand Vizier sound? Think Mac Arthur would go for that?
As I say, I don't know if we could close the deal, because with
Eisenhower running Columbia, getting a press notice every day in
the eastern newspapers and rounding up the country's choicest mag
nificoes every commencement, Mac Arthur might be upset over having
to stay out here where he would be doing well to get on a press wire
out of the Palo Alto Times
However, we could remind Mac Arthur that Eisenhower has one
eye on the Democrats while the other eye is winking at the Republicans,
and if Mac Arthur wants to get into the 1948 candidate business he'd
better hurry home and grab any kind of a job. Mac Arthur is as co
quettish about the White House right, now as Eisenhower, but when the
smart moment comes for him to drop the veil and stop peeking over
the fan, he ought to be someplace in the U.S. where they could get him
into a good photographer's. The redhot Republican press of the Bay
Area would always be ready to roll for him, and until he's ready to
hop out into the clearing he could always hide behind the Palo Alto
redwood.
At the same time we ought to caution Mac Arthur that a university
tower is a pretty high dive into political waters, and Eisenhower him
self ought to know that old Nicholas Murray Butler always thought he
was going to be President of the U.S. and never got out of Columbia.
In fact the only college presidents who ever made it were Wilson at
Princeton and James Garfield, who was once president of the Eclectic
Institute of Hiram, Ohio. Well, then Taft was Dean of the Law School
at Cincinnati, John Quincy Adams taught rhetoric at Harvard, and the
other Adams, Chester Arthur and McKinley all taught in small town
schools, but since none of these jobs could have had much to do with
their getting into the White House, perhaps Mac Arthur and Eisenhower
would do better to buy into some newspaper or settle down in Ohio or
Pennsylvania and work themselves up to governor or senator. Look
what happened to Conant at Harvard. Henry Luce sized him up as
just the right stature for the GOP nomination and went a little wild
over him in one issue of Time, but nobody paid any attention. Still,
it was done once by Wilson (we won't count Garfield), and the politi
cians have been nosing around college offices ever since, even though
Wilson had to work awhile as governor of New Jersey before they
could put him over.
Really, you want to know what an old army man wants to fool
around in college for anyway, and you wonder just what the college
can do to keep him busy and out of trouble, but I suppose Mac Arthur
might be able to find enough to do around here. I do know one job
the army's always been good at, though, and we could assign Mac-
Arthur first thing to getting somebody to clean up those lavatories on
the Quad.
Probably you can't say that Stanford is as good a school as Colum
bia, and so it may offend General Mac-Arthur if I suggest that it would
be a good idea, while he is still in Japan and open to offers, to negotiate
with him to take over some kind of a job at this university. Columbia
has General Eisenhower signed up for its presidency, and you'd think
Mac Arthur would want to do at least as well as that, but maybe it
wouldn't hurt to send out a few feelers. I don't know what sort of
position we could line up for him since we are already pretty well
fixed with a Chancellor and a President, but maybe we could pump
up some new balloon which could float him around somewhere in the
same stratospheric layer as the Chancellorship and the Presidency.
