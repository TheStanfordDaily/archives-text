# Mexican Cattle Dying; Mouth Disease Spreads

### JIM JOSEPH (Special to The Daily 
TEXCOCO, Mexico — From this
secluded rancho 20 miles outside
of Mexico City, the troubles of this
southern republic seem far away.
Yet down the main highway to the
city all transportation is stopped
and ordered to drive through baths
of lye. The dreaded aftosa—hoof
and mouth disease, has spread to
the state of San Luis Potosi, 300
miles north of the capital. What
once was an isolated calamity has
become a national catastrophe.
Here in Texcoco, state of Mex
ico, the government is carrying on
its slaughter of cattle; rumor says
that by fall no cattle will l'emain
in this once-rich province. The
government promises mules to re
place the cattle, since mules are
immune to aftosa, but mules can
not do the chores of oxen nor can
they supply much-needed milk.
All Mexico is in a state of war —
war against the cattle killing and
the economic strangulation of the
hoof and mouth disease. But no
one really believes that baths or
blockades will be of real aid; the
peons sneak past the inspection
stations and their cattle wander
freely past the blockades. The only
sure method of exterminating the
disease is the bullet and the
common grave—which necessarily
spells even greater poverty for an
agricultural populace to which
cattle is more than property —is
life itself.

Tom Koralek (also a Stanford
student) and I are down here to
do a series of picture-articles in
the far interior of Mexico. We have
some work to do in Mexico City
too, though, including an article
and cover for a national electronics
trade publication. That, and a
nearby story on the maguey cac
tus from which pulque is made,
will complete our Mexico City as
signments. (From the maguey cac
tus also comes a worm which is
considered a delicacy here.)
From Mexico City we'll be head
ing south past the last miles of the
Pan-American highway, past Oa
xaea, and into the mahogany coun
try. We'll leave Mexico City and
Acapulco to the society editors
and Errol Flynn.
