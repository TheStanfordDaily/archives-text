### 
PARIS, Monday, June 30 (UP). —
The oflicial French press agency
said today that Big Three negotia
tions on the Marshal] Plan for Eu
ropean recovery were deadlocked
completely and that Russia was fol
lowing a procedure which might
wreck the conference.
The statement was a detailed
analysis of the supposedly super
secret French-British-Russian con-

ference since its start Friday and
apparently it was inspired directly
by the French Foreign Office.
'"The foreign ministers have ar
rived at an impasse over which, in
any event, they have no more than
the weakest chances to reach agree
ment," the statement said.
c Its statement was obviously in re
ply to dispatches of its counterpart,
the official Russian news agency
Tass, giving the viewpoint which
Russian Foreign Minister Viacheslav
Molotov had advanced in the "se
cret" conference.
