# 'The Yearling' Not Realistic, But Beautiful
## 
### 
Whenever Hollywood attempts to
recreate on the screen a novel
dealing with the lives of simple
backwoods people, one usually has
the right to expect the worst, but
ever since "The Grapes of Wrath - '
in 1940 and the deeply touching
"Southerner" in 1945 a new respect
for the American cinema in this
field has been kindled. "The Year
ling," although it deals purely with
the simple, human element and car
ries no social message, is another
case in point. It is not done in the
realistic and harsh tones of John
Ford's "Grapes of Wrath," because
it does not need to be. That kind of
approach, it seems to me, would
only destroy the innate beauty and
meaning of the story.
GLOSSY AND SLICK
The picture is too often glossy and
slick, and at times resembles an
over-sentimental travelogue, but
the mawkishness is kept to a mini
mum by intelligent, sensitive direc
tion which in turn has stimulated
the cast into giving generally ex
cellent performances. Gregory Peck
is ideally cast as Penny Baxter, a
role which calls for deep under
standing and strength. Peck, who is
so good at suggesting real inner
strength and character (except for
a slight deviation in "Duel in the
Sun") is as good as usual here, but
his part is essentially a simple, un
complicated one.
As good as Jane Wyman is in
her portrayal of the bitter, hard
ened Ma Baxter, she seems to be
miscast. I suppose this can be ex
plained by the nature of the whole
approach the producers adopted
toward "The Yearling." They chose,
and wisely so, I believe, to present
the quiet, beautifully sad story of a
boy who is suddenly forced to give
up his pet deer and his boyhood at
the same time. They did not intend
to inject too much of the grinding
monotony and grueling drudgery of
the scrub-farmer's life. All this
they merely suggested, and focused
fnstead on the boy, Jody, and his
deer, the tender relations between
Penny and Jody, and the breath
taking natural beauty and animal
life of the surrounding Florida
country.
RESULTS NOT UNHAPPY
In this light, then, can be under
stood the casting of Miss Wyman
as Ma Baxter, and the results are
far from unhappy. But best of all
is the remarkable performance of
Claude Jarman Jr. as Jody. A new
comer to the movies, he acts with
great naturalness and skillfully
handles a role which could easily
have become sloppily sentimental.—

mum by intelligent, sensitive direc
tion which in turn has stimulated
the cast into giving generally ex
cellent performances. Gregory Peck
is ideally cast as Penny Baxter, a
role which calls for deep under
standing and strength. Peck, who is
so good at suggesting real inner
strength and character (except for
a slight deviation in "Duel in the
Sun") is as good as usual here, but
his part is essentially a simple, un
complicated one.
As good as Jane Wyman is in
her portrayal of the bitter, hard
ened Ma Baxter, she seems to be
miscast. I suppose this can be ex
plained by the nature of the whole
approach the producers adopted
toward "The Yearling." They chose,
and wisely so, I believe, to present
the quiet, beautifully sad story of a
boy who is suddenly forced to give
up his pet deer and his boyhood at
the same time. They did not intend
to inject too much of the grinding
monotony and grueling drudgery of
the scrub-farmer's life. All this
they merely suggested, and focused
fnstead on the boy, Jody, and his
deer, the tender relations between
Penny and Jody, and the breath
taking natural beauty and animal
life of the surrounding Florida
country.
RESULTS NOT UNHAPPY
In this light, then, can be under
stood the casting of Miss Wyman
as Ma Baxter, and the results are
far from unhappy. But best of all
is the remarkable performance of
Claude Jarman Jr. as Jody. A new
comer to the movies, he acts with
great naturalness and skillfully
handles a role which could easily
have become sloppily sentimental.—

Whenever Hollywood attempts to
recreate on the screen a novel
dealing with the lives of simple
backwoods people, one usually has
the right to expect the worst, but
ever since "The Grapes of Wrath - '
in 1940 and the deeply touching
"Southerner" in 1945 a new respect
for the American cinema in this
field has been kindled. "The Year
ling," although it deals purely with
the simple, human element and car
ries no social message, is another
case in point. It is not done in the
realistic and harsh tones of John
Ford's "Grapes of Wrath," because
it does not need to be. That kind of
approach, it seems to me, would
only destroy the innate beauty and
meaning of the story.
GLOSSY AND SLICK
The picture is too often glossy and
slick, and at times resembles an
over-sentimental travelogue, but
the mawkishness is kept to a mini
mum by intelligent, sensitive direc
tion which in turn has stimulated
the cast into giving generally ex
cellent performances. Gregory Peck
is ideally cast as Penny Baxter, a
