## History 1947 
### 
The Western boundary of the
Russian sphere of influence in
Europe (which was tagged in a
convenient catch-phrase "the iron
curtain") runs almost due north
and south from the Baltic to the
Adriatic. The prime question, in
essence, to be dealt with by the
present three-power conference in
Paris is whether or not the area
between this line and the boun
daries of the Soviet Union are to
be part of the economic and com
mercial system of Europe west of
this line, or whether they arc to
be economically oriented eastward
lor the primary benefit of the So
viet Union.
Why is this the prime question?
For a good one-word answer,
"Food." Western Europe is no
more self-sufficient than are New
York and Pennsylvania. The food
stuffs of Europe's eastern plains
and valleys are a normal source of
supply for the industrial areas in
western Europe, as the Germans
well knew. Eastern Europe also
produces oil, ores, tobacco, and
other useful items. It should be

unnecessary to point out that Rus
sia, too, can make use of all these
products. Continued domination of
these territories would add much,
not only to the military security
of Russia, but to her economic
security as well.
This line of demarcation, this
"Iron Curtain," is not a straight
line. Where it runs in relation to
Czechoslovakia and Austria is not
clear, and, while the recent inci
dents in Hungary have sketched it
in there, the sketching may not
be in permanent ink.
There are rumors, indeed, that
Czechoslovakia may be the next
scene of what would once have
been called a putsch. Whether it
will be preceded by a Munich or
not, I cannot say. But there is a
nauseating familiarity about the
situation. (It was only two years
ago, indeed, that I left Czechoslo
vakia with "the outfit." It was a
lovely country, but I'd hate to
make the same sort of conducted
tour over there again.) Another set
of rumors mentions the setting- up
of governments-in-exile by refu

gee politicians from the anschlussed
Balkan nations. That, too, sounds
familiar.
Now, I grant you that we cannot
point to any single instance, such
as Hitler's seizing control of Czech
oslovakia or marching into Austria
as the single and immediate cause
of the war whose duration is still
with us. But I am convinced that
they had something to do with the
outbreak of war. Why should these
rumors indicate the approach of
war? We don't want war. Russia
doesn't want war, neither France
nor Great Britain wants war, no
body wants war!
Well, I suppose it is seldom that
anyone really did want a war.
But one nation can only disregard
the claims of other nations just so
far. This is, after all, one world,
and the fact of war is one proof of
it. This is not a plea for peace at
any price; war is not the absolute
of evil.
But must there be another war
... so soon?

in there, the sketching may not
be in permanent ink.
There are rumors, indeed, that
Czechoslovakia may be the next
scene of what would once have
been called a putsch. Whether it
will be preceded by a Munich or
not, I cannot say. But there is a
nauseating familiarity about the
situation. (It was only two years
ago, indeed, that I left Czechoslo
vakia with "the outfit." It was a
lovely country, but I'd hate to
make the same sort of conducted
tour over there again.) Another set
of rumors mentions the setting- up
of governments-in-exile by refu

gee politicians from the anschlussed
Balkan nations. That, too, sounds
familiar.
Now, I grant you that we cannot
point to any single instance, such
as Hitler's seizing control of Czech
oslovakia or marching into Austria
as the single and immediate cause
of the war whose duration is still
with us. But I am convinced that
they had something to do with the
outbreak of war. Why should these
rumors indicate the approach of
war? We don't want war. Russia
doesn't want war, neither France
nor Great Britain wants war, no
body wants war!
Well, I suppose it is seldom that
anyone really did want a war.
But one nation can only disregard
the claims of other nations just so
far. This is, after all, one world,
and the fact of war is one proof of
it. This is not a plea for peace at
any price; war is not the absolute
of evil.
But must there be another war
... so soon?
The Western boundary of the
Russian sphere of influence in
Europe (which was tagged in a
convenient catch-phrase "the iron
curtain") runs almost due north
and south from the Baltic to the
Adriatic. The prime question, in
essence, to be dealt with by the
present three-power conference in
Paris is whether or not the area
between this line and the boun
daries of the Soviet Union are to
be part of the economic and com
mercial system of Europe west of
this line, or whether they arc to
be economically oriented eastward
lor the primary benefit of the So
viet Union.
Why is this the prime question?
For a good one-word answer,
"Food." Western Europe is no
more self-sufficient than are New
York and Pennsylvania. The food
stuffs of Europe's eastern plains
and valleys are a normal source of
supply for the industrial areas in
western Europe, as the Germans
well knew. Eastern Europe also
produces oil, ores, tobacco, and
other useful items. It should be

unnecessary to point out that Rus
sia, too, can make use of all these
products. Continued domination of
these territories would add much,
not only to the military security
of Russia, but to her economic
security as well.
This line of demarcation, this
"Iron Curtain," is not a straight
line. Where it runs in relation to
Czechoslovakia and Austria is not
clear, and, while the recent inci
dents in Hungary have sketched it
in there, the sketching may not
be in permanent ink.
