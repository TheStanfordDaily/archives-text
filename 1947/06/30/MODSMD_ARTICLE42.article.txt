## Sidelights

So the Pacific Coast League is
going to ask for major league status
and discontinuance of the hated
draft rule at the Big League Com
mittee meeting in Chicago next
Monday.
Frankly, we're agin it.
The PCL is not a major league
circuit now, in the salaries it pays,
in the crowds it draws, in the parks
it has, in the caliber of its play,
nor in its attitude toward the game.
According to president Clarence
E. Rowland and other spokesmen of
the loop, all the PCL wants is a
chance to prove that it could upgrade
itself into a topflight circuit within,
say, a five-year period. Undoubted
ly it could improve itself if both of its
demands are granted.
'NO CONFLICT"
The reason the PCL men give
justify their brace of demands is
that the coast circuit is a couple of
thousand miles away from the major
league franchises, and thus the ma
jors have "no conflict" with the PCL.
That's true enough, but we still hold
that a circuit isn't major league j
unless it plays major league ball. I
And the PCL doesn't.
We don't know whether the coast j
league men want the draft rule re- J
scinded for the whole of baseball or i
just for the PCL. But either way, I
the idea is rediculous, for the draft
rule was originally passed to protect
a player from kicking around in the
minors just because the club that
owned him couldn't afford to let him
go.
Sensational Bob Chesnes, of the
Seals, is a case in point: it's begin
nning to look as if the draft rule
is the only thing he has that will
enable him to play in the majors. As j
it is, the Seal owners are going to ;
hold him down in the minors, either !
until some club comes through with
a fantastic amount of money or the
draft rule makes them send him on
up.
NOT FAIR TO PLAYER
The point is, why should a good j
player * like Chesnes be forced to |
spend unnecessary years in a minor |
league just to enable his owners to j
make more money of! of him? It j
just isn't fair to the player to drop 1
the draft rule.
The West Coast definitely deserves )
to have major league ball, but up- j
ping the PCL is not going to do it.
Unless San Francisco or Los An- j
geles can sneak into one of the two j
established major leagues, there is
not much chance of major league ball |
ever being played out here, as we j
see it. It's not a hopeful situation, I
but it's still no excuse for the PCL j
officials to take advantage of con- ,
ditions to push through their own j
plans.
For all we know, the PCL may be j
granted both of its demands on July [
7. But even if the loop is granted !
major league status, it will still be j
a minor league in our estimation. I
And a lot of improvements—lots of j
them—will have to be made before
we'll even consider changing our
mind.
The PCL a major lfcague? Not for
our money!
