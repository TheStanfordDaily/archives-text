# McKenley Sets Record In Big Nine-PCC Meet
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
EDWARDS STADIUM, BERKELEY, June 28â€”Mecurial Herb
McKenley showed his heels to the Pacific Coast's best yesterday,
rattling off a :46.3 quarter mile as the Big Nine bludgeoned the
Pacific Coast Conference, 94'/ to 34 ! 4, in sight of more than
8,000 fans who saw a veritable preview of next year's Olympic
performers.
The long-legged McKenley, sporting a verdant mustachachio,

made a most impressive Bay Area
debut. Twice he stopped the watches
at :46.3, the second time while
anchoring the midwestern mile re
lay team.
"I felt sorta sickish after the 440
race," Herb told us. "That's why I
decided to stay out of the 220."
NEW MARK
Herb's time was one-tenth of a
second under the recognized mark
held jointly by Stanford's Ben East
man and California's Gxover Klern
mer. At the NCAA meet at Salt
Lake City last week, the Illini racer
ran a :46.2 i*ace. A seven mile aix
hour wind may, however, nullify the
performance.
While the Jamaica Flyer was tak
ing things into his own hands, his
Big Nine mates really put a crimp
into the once powerful kingdom of
Western track with a "records-shat
tering" act.
Fortune Gordien. Minnesota pow
erhouse, and swift Bill Porter,
North west ern hurdler, also assumed
the i-ole of giant killers with a pair
of double wins.
Gordien came close to nipping the
world discus max-k with a heave of
172 feet, 8% inches. Earlier, the
Gopher behemoth edged Michigan's
Chuck Fonville in the shot put with
a throw of 53 feet. 9V4 inches.
PORTER BRILLIANT
Northwestern's Porter, ixi our
opinion, was just as great a star as
was the winged McKenley. He cap
tured a : 14.2 flight of high hurdles
and eased up a bit to easily annex
the 220 yard lows in :23.1.
Had not the fortunes of destiny
looked over the wrong shoulder,
two other world records might have
been established. The 480 yard shut
tle hurdle relay, with Porter skip
ping the anchor portion, could have
gone off the boards. A good 12 yards
in fxont of the PCC anchorman,
Stanford's A 1 Snyder. Porter nicked
the last barrier, and sprawled head
long on the track, but managed to
rise to his feet and sneak across the
finish line four yai'ds ahead of the
fast-charging Snyder.
PCC DROPS BATON
A missed baton pass 'twixt Cal's
Roland Maples and USC's Ron
Frazier enabled the Big Nine 440
yard relay team to bx*eeze the dis
tance in :40.6, one-tenth of a sec
ond above the record.
The PCC record, incidentally, was
established by a quartet of Lee Orr.
Geoigie Boone, Curt Ledford, and
Jack Weiershauser, who only hap
pens to be the Farm track tutor.
Lone PCC wins were registered in
the two mile, high jump, and broad
jump, Cal's Chuck Hangar provid
ing the meet's top surprise.
HANGAR WINS
The scissors-style Hangar man
aged to leap a stratospheric 6 feet,
7 1 s, his best ever for a new UC
high jump mark; Roland Sink, USC

runner, held off Illinois' John Two
mey to nab the two mile in 9:18.1;
and Troy's A 1 Lawrence won the
broad jump with 23 feet, 4% inches.
Ohio State's Bill Clifford lowered
the meet record in the 880 yard run,
traversing the distance in 1:51.4,
barreling past Herb Barten of Mich
igan in the last 85 yards.
Smiling Billy Mathis, the Illini
sprinter who simply seems to run all
over the track, nipped Indiana's
Chuck Peters and Cal's Donnie And
erson in the creditable time of :9.6
seconds.
RECORDS FALL
All in all, in addition to McKen
ley's clash with time, four meet rec
ords disappeax'ed fxom existence.
Weather conditions were ideal in
advance of the greatest onslaught on
time and distance recorded west of
the Rockies.
The PCC took a whale of beating,
but the multitudes of the curious
took it all in fun. Attendance was
cut down because of the Key Sys
tem strike which resumed operations
again this morning for the first time
since June 11.
Next week: East Lynne, or the
saga of the AAU at Lincoln, Nebi\,
whei'e McKenley may possibly bet
ter his :46.2 quarter mile effort
posted at the x-ecent NCAA affair.
