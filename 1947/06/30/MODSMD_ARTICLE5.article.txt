# DuShane To Lecture On Embryos
## 
### 
Important contributions of micro
surgery on living embryos in the
field of biology will be discussed to
morrow night in the Tuesday Eve
ning Series by Dr. Graham P. Du-
Shane. Stanford professor of biology.
The lecture, which will be illus
trated with slides, is entitled "Trans
plantation Experiments on Em
bryos." It will begin at 8:00 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
Through micro-surgery, performed
with delicate scissors designed for
operations on the human eye, scien
tists have been able to learn how
it is that skin or hair in mammals,
and feathers in birds, become col
ored.
Dr. DuShane came to Stanford
last autumn as professor of biology
from the University of Chicago,
where he won a $1,000 award for
effective undergraduate teaching.
Son of a distinguished Indiana
educator, the 35-year-old scientist
received his A.B. from Wabash Col
lege in 1930 and his Ph.D. from Yale
University in 1934.
Following a year as research asso
ciate at the University of lowa, Dr.
DuShane came to Stanford in 1935
to study under Professor V. C.
Twitty on a one-year National Re
search Council fellowship.
He joined the University of Chi
cago faculty in 1936 as an instructor
in zoology and was subsequently
promoted to associate professor.
His research includes a pioneer
ing and classical analysis of the
embryological origin of pigment
cells in vertebrates.
