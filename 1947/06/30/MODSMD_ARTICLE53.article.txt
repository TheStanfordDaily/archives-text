# Life Covers Mayan Story
## 
### 
Life Magazine follows the lead of
Stanford University Press this week
in featuring an article on the Maya
of Yucatan, whose brilliant civili
zation is the subject of Stanford's
best seller, "The Ancient Maya."
This is reported to ho the longest
story on a single subject ever to
appear on the pages of the maga
zine.
Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley, author of
"The Ancient Maya," is also a con
tributor to the article in Life. He is
.head of the Carnegie Institution's
fie Id-research in Yucatan, and has
spent 40 years in the jungle wilder
ness of Latin America searching for
the lost ruins of Mayan culture.
Donald P. Bean, director of Stan
ford University Press, saw the story
first and picked Dr. Morley's book
to head the 1946 fall list of titles pub
lished by the Press.
"The Ancient Maya" was imme
diately successful, and so impressed
the editors of Life that they made
arrangements with Dr. Morley for
the present article.
Meanwhile scholars and the gen
eral public have received the book
so enthusiastically that plans for a
fourth printing are under way.
Color photographs, which are the
distinctive feature of the Life article,
are by the magazine's staff members
"who photographed the Mayan scenes
in Yucatan under Dr. Morley's su
pervision.
