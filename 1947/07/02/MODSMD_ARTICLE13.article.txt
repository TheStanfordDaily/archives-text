# Molotov Agrees to Seek Advice on Big Three Plan
## 
### 
PARIS, July 1 (UP).—The Big Three foreign
ministers staved off the collapse of their con
ference on the Marshall plan tonight when
Soviet delegate Viacheslav Molotov agreed to
consult the Kremlin on a French compromise.

y Molotov is to give his reply at a
meeting set for 4 p.m. tomorrow. It
was feared that Russia could not
accept the compromise without al
tering her entire attitude toward
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall's plan for European recovery.
Hence, conference leaders believed
the three foreign ministers would
break up tomorrow night in final
disagreement.
ACTION DETERMINED
Whatever happens, France and
Great Britain are determined to go
ahead full speed with the Marshall
plan, bringing in countries outside
of Russia's iron curtain if Russia
refuses to take part.
The compromise offered by French
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault
was only a desperate move to de
lay, if he could not prevent, the
breach between Eastern and West
ern powers.
Molotov, after a quick survey of
the Bidault compromise, dismissed
it as not differing materially from
previous Anglo-French proposals he
had summarily rejected.
FINAL WORD
British Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin warned him that this was the
final word of France and Britain,
and appealed to him to save the
conference.
Molotov then asked for a 24 hour
adjournment to enable him to
"study" the compromise—meaning
to consult the leaders in Moscow.
Bidault's plan—the final one of
the conference unless Molotov comes
up tomorrow with another, opens
with this introductory statement:
RECOVERY NEEDED
Europe must start toward recov
ery by aiding herself and developing
her production, after which Ameri
can aid would play its part in put
ting over the effort. <
A special organization should be
set up at once to co-ordinate the re
sources and needs of Europe.
