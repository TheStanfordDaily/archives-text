### 
PARIS, July 1 (UP). —A cordon of 2,000 armed policemen surrounded
the National Assembly Building tonight to prevent threatened demonstra
tions by left wing workers as the government pursued its investigation of
an amazing right wing plot to overthrow the Fourth Republic.
Police surged into the area of the old Palais De Bourbon reinforced

by special anti-riot cars, and erected \
four-foot barriers around the build- i
•'rig.
Automobile traffic was diverted at
the height of the evening rush hour
and the identity of all passersby was
checked.
Fear of riotous demonstration i - e- •
suited from threats of leaders of
1 ,500,000 metal workeVs who held a
one-day strike today in protest
against the austerity financial pro
gram of Premier Paul Ramadier,
"Strikers held mass meetings in
many provincial cities to demand
better food and production bonuses.
A 12-day strike of bank clerks
ended tonight when the government
made concessions as regards wages.
Banks will reopen tomorrow.
Ramadier announced that he
would seek a vote of confidence—on
which the fate of his government de
pends—at the end of the finance
economic debate now in progress.
The War Office joined the Surete
Nationale today in investigating the
rebellion plot of the '"Black Maquis"
whose "Blue Plan" called for a
march on Paris and the institution
of a right wing extremist dictator
ship.
