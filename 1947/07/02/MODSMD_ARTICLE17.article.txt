WASHINGTON. July 1 (UP).—A ■
free press assures quick death for I
"serious departures from fact or j
principle regardless of how skill
fully they are promoted," Secretary
of State George C. Marshall said
today.
He told the Women's National
Press Club that, "the more complete j
the public understanding of the is
sues, the less the public will be
swayed by the winds 'of passion and 1
prejudice."
"The ideal that we could desire in
this country," he said, "would be a !
public opinion -so well-grounded |
that it could discount propaganda
and would insure a steady and Con- J
sistent support of the fundamental
objectives of our foreign policy."
He said that 100 percent support
for any particular measure cannot be j
expected from the press since "our
democratic system thrives upon di
versity of opinion and it is this very j
diversity which operates as a cor- |
Meeting and improving mechanism."
