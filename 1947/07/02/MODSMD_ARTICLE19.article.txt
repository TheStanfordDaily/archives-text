# Mystery Air Crash Probed
## 
### 
SHREVEPORT, La., July 1 (UP).
â€”An army staff sergeant, for per
sonal reasons that may never be
known, took off apparently alone,
from Barksdale Field in a Flying
Fortress, normally manned by a
crew of 10, today and crashed to a
fiery death at Sibley, La., 18 miles
east of his starting point.
Tonight, mystified field authorities
hastily set up a board of inquiry to
determine answers to the following
puzzling questions:
1. What motivated the unauthor
ized flight by the sergeant, identified
as Robert Farrar, 28. of Bastrop, La.?
2. How was he able to get the four,
engines revved up and otherwise
put the big bomber in flight trim
by himself? The B-17 usually car
ries a crew of .10.
3. How did the sergeant get his
ship warmed up and take off without
arousing guards, the officer on duty
and the flight control tower? The
first thing anyone knew the Fortress
was missing was when an airline
pilot spotted the wreckage and noti
fied the field.
4. How did the sergeant get the
plane airborne from an unlighted
runway?
Barksdale authorities were so
much in the dark on the whole af
fair that they first reported a B-17
was missing with a full crew aboard.
When only one body was recovered
from the charred and crumpled
wreckage, they counted off ranks at
the field and found only the staff
sergeant unaccounted for.
