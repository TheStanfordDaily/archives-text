SAN FRANCISCO. July 1 (UP).â€”
At least four large San Francisco
markets were struck today by AFL
Retail Fruit and Vegetable Clerks
Local 1017 in a contract dispute that
threatened to tie up nearly 1100
other stores throughout the city.
The Union's contract expired last
midnight and following collapse of
negotiations grocery clerks and
butchers began refusing to pass
picket lines. Allen M. Brodke,
union official, said all independent
and association stores that refused
to sign a new agreement would be
struck progressively.
