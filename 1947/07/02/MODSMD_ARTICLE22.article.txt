# Taft Attempts To Avert Coal Miners' Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 1 (UP).â€”
Sen. Robert A. Taft (R., O.), co-au
thor of the Taft-Hartley Labor Law.
tonight called on coal operators and
the United Mine Workers (AFL) to
reach agreement on a new wage
contract and prevent another na
tionwide strike next week.
His appeal came amid reports that
UMW President John L. Lewis and
most Northern and Middle Western
coal operators are near agreement
on a contract that would cover a
substantial segment of the industry.
LP.WIS MEETS PRODUCERS
Lewis met secretly with a group
of producers representing most of
the mines in those areas. The in
dustry spokesmen were understood
to have offered to meet his demands
for a daily pay scale of $13.05 for
eight hours' work and travel time
with a staggered one - half - hour
lunch period.
Further, they reportedly offered to
continue the five cents a ton levy for
the union health and welfare fund,
include the Federal Safety Code in
the contract, pay SIOO annual vaca
tion allowance, and screen supervi
sory workers to place additional
miners under the collective bargain
ing agreement.
OVERTIME RATES
Lewis' demands for overtime rates
for Saturday and Sunday work and
for six paid holidays were said to
have been rejected.
Lewis then talked with UMW
Vice - President John O'Leary and
Secretary-Treasurer Thomas Ken
nedy. giving rise to reports that the
union's wage policy committee may
be summoned here to consider the
ofTer.
Taft, who stoutly defended the
new labor law, said he was opposed
to suggestions that the government's
authority to operate the mines be
extended. But he urged that Presi
dent Truman appoint a fact-finding
board if the coal contract dispute
endangers the national health and
safety.
He described the coal situation as
"unique" since the government had
returned the mines to the private
owners and there no longer is a
contract between the operators and
the miners.
