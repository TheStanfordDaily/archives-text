# Tenants, Landlords Confused By New Rent Control Law
## 
### 
CHICAGO, July 1 (UP). â€”Tenants and landlords alike were confused
and rent control offices in some cities were swamped with queries and
complaints today as the new rent control law became effective.
Kent gouging was confined to apartment, hotels, with some isolated
increases as high as 150 percent demanded by owners, a survey of repre-

tentative cities showed. Residents of
hotels were affected immediately
because the law provides for com
plete decontrol of certain classifica
tions of hotels.
In a few larger cities, a majority
of apartment house landlords were
reported asking, or preparing to ask,
for a 15 percent increase in rentals in
exchange for 18-month leases. In
Chicago, some landlords were order
ing 15 percent increases illegally.
Some landlords and owners' asso
ciations adopted a "wait-and-see"
attitude to determine how they stand
legally. Local rent control authori
ties and landlords in various cities
said they expected a flood of legal
actions over the new law. In Buffalo,
the rent control office said landlords
would find an increased amount of
red tape in obtaining increases.
Rent control offices and hotel and
-apartment owners' associations were
clashing over interpretations of the
law but thousands of tenants were
reported agreeing to the 15 per cent
increase in return for 18-month
leases.
