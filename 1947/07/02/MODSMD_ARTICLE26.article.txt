# U.S. Blamed By Yugoslavia

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 1
(UP). —Yugoslavia protested today
that Balkan countries were subject
to ''open intimidation" and hinted
that the United States was to blame.
Dr. Joza Vilfan of Yugoslavia
made the charge before the United
Nations Security Council in answer
ing the report of a UN commission
which investigated Balkan border
incidents.
The commission accused Yugo
slavia and—to a lesser extent, Bul
garia and Albania—of supporting
guerrillas which opposed Greek
government forces.
Denying Yugoslavs had infiltrated
into Greece, Vilfan said "there is
intensive infiltration from other
sides into the whole structure of
Greek life."
Vilfan said that a speedy Security
Council condemnation of Yugoslavia,
Bulgaria and Albania could create
the impression that conclusions were
reached "on the basis of a judg
ment created in advance and of
special interests."
