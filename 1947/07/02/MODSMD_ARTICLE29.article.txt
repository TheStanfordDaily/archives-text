# Truman Hits Cut in Funds
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 1 (UP).—
President Truman made another
two-fisted attack on the Republi
can-controlled Congress today—his
since June 16.
i This time he aimed his fire at the
GOP economy campaign, which
grew out of promises the Republi
cans made to the voters last No
vember when they ousted the Dem
ocrats from power.
SIGNS BILL
The President signed a bill mak
ing funds available to operate the
Treasury and Postoffice departments
during the fiscal year which began
today. It was the first of 12 regular
appropriations measures to be com
pleted by Congress since January,
i The Chief Executive assailed the
lawmakers sharply for making a
520.000.000 cut in funds he requested
I for the Treasury's Internal Revenue
Bureau. That agency collects taxes
from millions of citizens and busi
nesses, makes refunds to those who
pay too much, and puts the law on
the trail of those who don't pay
enough.
UNEMPLOYMENT CAUSE
The President said in a statement
that he had been advised by Secre
tary of the Treasury John W. Sny
der that this reduction would throw
between 4,000 and 5,000 bureau em
ployees out of work, and would re
j suit in a direct loss of at least
$400,000,000 in revenue during this
| fiscal year. He said the agency now
has a backlog of 30,000 cases of sus
pected tax evasion,
i Mr. Truman's running contro
versy with Congress, which is rap
idly building up into a major issue
!in the 1948 Presidential election
campaign, began June 16 when he
vetoed the GOP-sponsored income
tax cut bill. He won an important
victory when the House sustained
his action by a two-vote margin.
Then he slapped a veto on the
Taft-Hartley labor reform act, but
j was soundly trounced on that one
in both the House and Senate.
