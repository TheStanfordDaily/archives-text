### 
INDIANAPOLIS. July 1 (UP).â€”
President William Green of the
American Federation of Labor today
called on members of organized
labor to use the power of the ballot
box "to see that the gang who put
over the Taft-Hartley anti-labor
bill is not returned to Congress."
In a speech before 500 delegates
to the AFL American Flint Glass
Workers Union meeting, Green de
manded a showdown with the "ene
mies of labor" and said that election
day should be made a legal holiday
so that every one can cast his vote.
The AFL will carry on a continu
ous fight to upset the "vicious and
obnoxious" Taft-Hartley bill "until
the workers can deliver their final
blow at the polls this fall," Green
pledged.
