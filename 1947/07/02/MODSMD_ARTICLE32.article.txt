# Mississippi Still Rising
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS. July 1 (UP). —The
angry Father of Waters boiled up
to a near record height tonight and
sent thousands of Mississippi Valley
residents fleeing before a flood
greater than any in their experience.
Torrential rains sent the river
surging to a new crest here, over-
I topped or breached four levees and
j doomed the Illinois town of Dupo,
! from which area 4,000 persons fled
I to higher ground.
ONE DIKE STANDING
Other than the high sloping natu
ral levee protecting central St.
Louis, only one major dike was
standing intact along a 100 - mile
stretch of the river from St. Louis
to Grand Tower, 111.
Endangered by the overtopped
J Prairie du Pont levee, Dupo resi
i dents fled as the Mississippi went
near 40.5 feet at St. Louis for its
second crest in two days.
VOLUNTEERS FIGHT
Some 500 volunteers frantically
sandbagged a secondary line of de
fense along a railroad right-of-way,
over which several inches of brown
water already was flowing, in an
effort to keep as much as possible
out of the town of 2.600. Nearly
7,000 acres were flooded.
Mayor Delmar E. Valine said that
almost all the women and children
had fled and that a majority of the
I men were gone. More than a thou-
I sand others were evacuated from
the nearby communities of North
Dupo, East Carondelet and Val
meyer.
They were carried to safety by
[ buses, trucks and railroad cars, in
j which some stored their belongings
and others took refuge.
