## The 						People's World 
### 
If the Quad were animate, it undoubtedly would have re
ceived the shock of its life last Monday. All over the area is
being scattered —pardon the expression—The People's World.
If the intent of said scattering was to indoctrinate Stanfordites
in Marxism with news too obviously slanted by its present
day followers, however, we fear it was all for naught. Every
body we saw reading the paper was making with the big
peals of laughter.
That indicates: (1) That Stanford students are so highly
imbued with the ideals of freedom and individualism that they
cannot be proselyted, or (2) That Stanford students have been
so thoroughly biased by their capitalistic background that they
close their ears to Truth. You may take either explanation, as
your personal philosophy guides you.
If the papers were distributed in the belief that we at Stan
ford have never heard the other side—well, that's fallacy. This
is a university. We're here to find out about things, and we
study Communism right along with other political forms.
There are plenty of Communist papers and magazines in the
library for those who care to read them.
