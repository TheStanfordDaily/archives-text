SHOOTING SCRIPT: SCENE 4: "THE DEARLING"
(Scene: Interior of the Maxter shack in Florida. Late afternoon.
The sun streams in through the windows with the density of orange
soda. The father of the family, Penny, is smoking his pipe and cleaning
his gun. Maw Maxter is sitting quietly in her black alpaca dress in a,
yes, rocking chair, sewing. Young Joadie is lying on the floor playing
with his pet alligator).
MAW: (closeup: scowling) I tell you, Penny, that there 'gator's
got to go.
(From here on through the scene, the camera switches to each mem
ber of the family as he speaks.)
JOADIE: Aw. Maw!
PENNY: Don't be so hard on the boy, Maw. Every boy's got to have
a critter to love.
JOADIE: (his eyes shining as he strokes the alligator's back) That's
right, Paw. Look, Paw, ain't his tail pretty?
MAW: (sewing more rapidly) There's nuthin' pretty 'bout that
'gator. Twarn't so bad when he et up my two boys, but, Paw, we jest
cain't afford to lose no more livestock.
JOADIE: Aw, Maw. Hey, Maw, look at his eyes (he grabs the
alligator by the jaws and lifts ift face up to his mother) Ain't he got
the prettiest eyes you ever seen?
MAW: (grunting) He's got mean eyes. (As she says this, the
alligator breaks Joadie's grip and snaps at his hand—closeup).
PENNY: Playful critter, ain't he, son?
JOADIE: Ain't he got the prettiest teeth, Paw?
MAW: You better watch out, Joadie Maxter. That critter's liable
to bite your hand off. (Then, half to herself) And us short of hands
on the farm as it is.
JOADIE: Aw, Maw!
PENNY: You jest leave the boy alone, Maw. He's got to learn
about life. Now (camera moves up to his face), the way I see life, it's
jest a matter of ... .
MAW: (abruptly) That's enough, Penny.
PENNY: Aw, Maw!
JOADIE: You leave my paw alone, Maw. Tell me more about
life except—(he gropes for the words) except that it takes a heap o'
livin' to make a house a home.
MAW: All right, Penny.
PENNY: (suppressing his resentment by chewing on his pipe).
Now, Joadie, you run along with that critter of yours. Your maw and
me's got things to discuss.
JOADIE: About life?
PENNY: Yes, son. Now run along.
JOADIE: Oh, boy! (He jumps up and runs out of the house, the
alligator crawling after him. A choir offstage begins to hum like tur
bines, and as the boy and his pel crawl into the river and swim aban
donedly downstream, Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony begins to swim
with them. In fact, it outsplashes them entirely. As the music swells,
and as Joadie begins to leap out of the water periodically, like a por
poise, and as his pet beats his tail furiously and joyfully, all the alligators
in the river join in the fun. The pack, with Joadie in the lead, swims
frantically down over the rapids—and then back. The choir's "Old
Man River" is counterpointed to Shostakovich. The whole river is going
wild; the alligators are getting their jowls in an uproar. As the group
swims upstream, Joadie isn't even breathing hard, although the music
is. As Joadie and his pet jump back onto land and disappear cavortingly
over the horizon, the other alligators pause against the skyline and gaze
after them nostalgically. The music is dying. The music is dead. The
sky is terribly blue.)

PENNY: Don't be so hard on the boy, Maw. Every boy's got to have
a critter to love.
JOADIE: (his eyes shining as he strokes the alligator's back) That's
right, Paw. Look, Paw, ain't his tail pretty?
MAW: (sewing more rapidly) There's nuthin' pretty 'bout that
'gator. Twarn't so bad when he et up my two boys, but, Paw, we jest
cain't afford to lose no more livestock.
JOADIE: Aw, Maw. Hey, Maw, look at his eyes (he grabs the
alligator by the jaws and lifts ift face up to his mother) Ain't he got
the prettiest eyes you ever seen?
MAW: (grunting) He's got mean eyes. (As she says this, the
alligator breaks Joadie's grip and snaps at his hand—closeup).
PENNY: Playful critter, ain't he, son?
JOADIE: Ain't he got the prettiest teeth, Paw?
MAW: You better watch out, Joadie Maxter. That critter's liable
to bite your hand off. (Then, half to herself) And us short of hands
on the farm as it is.
JOADIE: Aw, Maw!
PENNY: You jest leave the boy alone, Maw. He's got to learn
about life. Now (camera moves up to his face), the way I see life, it's
jest a matter of ... .
MAW: (abruptly) That's enough, Penny.
PENNY: Aw, Maw!
JOADIE: You leave my paw alone, Maw. Tell me more about
life except—(he gropes for the words) except that it takes a heap o'

MAW: All right, Penny.
PENNY: (suppressing his resentment by chewing on his pipe).
Now, Joadie, you run along with that critter of yours. Your maw and
me's got things to discuss.
JOADIE: About life?
PENNY: Yes, son. Now run along.
JOADIE: Oh, boy! (He jumps up and runs out of the house, the
alligator crawling after him. A choir offstage begins to hum like tur
bines, and as the boy and his pel crawl into the river and swim aban
donedly downstream, Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony begins to swim
with them. In fact, it outsplashes them entirely. As the music swells,
and as Joadie begins to leap out of the water periodically, like a por
poise, and as his pet beats his tail furiously and joyfully, all the alligators
in the river join in the fun. The pack, with Joadie in the lead, swims
frantically down over the rapids—and then back. The choir's "Old
Man River" is counterpointed to Shostakovich. The whole river is going
wild; the alligators are getting their jowls in an uproar. As the group
swims upstream, Joadie isn't even breathing hard, although the music
is. As Joadie and his pet jump back onto land and disappear cavortingly
over the horizon, the other alligators pause against the skyline and gaze
after them nostalgically. The music is dying. The music is dead. The
sky is terribly blue.)
