A man who treats his lady well
To places of delight,
Who makes her life a precious one,
And braves the dark of night.
Who sings to her his words of love,
Her sorrows are his play,
A perfect man, I say that is,
Ah, Heaven, how find we they?
—R. L.
Lone Canary in the cage
Old Ma Nature much outrage
Poor little bird without a mate
All frustrate like Indian date.

There has been a change—Don't fret,
it's better not worse.
From now on all accepted contribu
tions to this column (so-called) will
be awarded dinners whether or not
they are plugs for Longbarn. C'mon,
you can do better than that. At the
risk of saying something startlingly
new. They should be sent to Eddie,
the restaurant Long Barn, Palo Alto.
