# Earth Study By Satellite Observatory?

NEW YORK (UP)—A Yale Uni
versity scientist believes that man
some day will be able to make a
"satellite observatory" which could
circle the world indefinitely, mak
ing recordings of what goes on in
outer ppace.
Dr. Lyman Spitzer, Jr., associate
professor of astronhysics. said such
a man-made earth satellite "obvi
ously could make many more
measurements than a rocket that
stays up for only a few minutes."
He said a floating space labora
tory also would have a big advan
tage over telescopes on earth,
which are handicapped by atmos
pheric conditions all over the
world.
"With a 200-inch telescope, on
an earth-circling satellite, objects
in the sky could be magnified ef
fectively 10,000 times," he said,
"while the unsteadiness of our at
mosphere usually prevents tele
scopes on earth from magnifying
more than a few hundred times
without blurring."
Human observers, he believes,
could not go along in such satel
lites because "it would be impos
sible to bring an observer back
from the satellite without bringing
the entire satellite down to earth."'
Instead, he said, radio waves
would be used to control the equip
ment and bring back the informa
tion obtained.
Spitzer disagreed with many
other astronomers in saying that
Mars probably is the best bet for
man to find life other than on his
own planet. Some scientists be
lieve that Venus may be more
suitable for life, although Spitzer
said Mars may be the first rocket
stop.
In fact, he believes that "men
from Mars" may already b» on this
planet, or at least have visited
here.
"Unless they had spent more
lime in a large city or had landed
sufficiently recently to be photo
graphed," he said, "we would have
no record of their having been
here. Any few men who had seen
them probably would not be be
lieved by anyone else."
