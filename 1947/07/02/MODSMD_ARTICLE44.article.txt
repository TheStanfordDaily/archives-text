# Pulque Plus Fandango-- They're a Fine Mixture

TEXCOCO, Mexico—A fandan
go is a fiesta and a fiesta is where
pulque, rumbas, and pretty girls
mix—and mix freely. The mere
fact that yesterday was Sunday
was excuse enough for a fandango
out at the Richey rancho, near
Texcoco.
The Richey rancho is a stretch
of even fields, backdropped by
mountains and billowing cloud
formations unlike any seen in the
United States. Surrounded by its
fields and the homes of its peons,
the main building is a hacienda
with a 100-foot-square swimming
pool. The fact that a few friendly
sheep use tbe swimming pool as a
watering hole takes nothing away
from its beauty. Yesterday the ha
cienda was made vivid by a mix
ture of pulque, barbecue (Mexican
slyle), and Latin gaiety.
They like Xavier Cugat down
here, and they enjoy American
jazz too —even jitterburg style. In
fact, the hacienda guests were still
jitterbugging when we left at 11
p.m. We had arrived late—at 9
a.m. These fandangos go on for
hours and even days. Perhaps the
United States should have some
thing of this sort; but perhaps the

fandango is too gay, too informal,
too carefree for America. Here
there is manana—always.
Maybe you'd like to meet some
of the guests. There was the
Lloyd's of London representative
from Vera Cruz, a colonial Brit
isher who will never forget that
above all he is an Englishman; his
wife, who came to the party in
formal attire, is a pleasant middle
aged person who, although she's
been in Mexico a good many years,
still knows very little Spanish.
Up from the deep mosquito-in
fested interior of Chiapas, from
their mahogany plantations, came
several guests. Tomorrow they will
board a private plane for Tenosi
que, near Yucatan, and return to
the isolation of their great ma
hogany stands.
From a radius of 50 miles came
the Richey family — mothers and
fathers with all their children—
and there were plenty of children.
Essentially a fandango is children's
day.
When it was all over—when the
Richey family had escaped to a
Mexico City movie starring Es
ther Williams, while their guests
danced on—everyone agreed it had
been una buena, fiesta. And ma
nana? Who cares!
