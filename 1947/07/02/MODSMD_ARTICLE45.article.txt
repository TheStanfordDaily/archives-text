## History -1947 
### 
It may be that at last the inter
national pattern is taking shape.
Up to now we have been faced by
so many seeming contradictions
and counter-contradictions in pol
icy that the over-all picture has
been more than a little obscured—
but perhaps out of all the fire
works and disagreement in Paris
we can begin to make more ac
curate estimates as to what will
come in the future.
Maybe you remember a story
which appeared in the second is
sue of The Daily this summer,
which reported a speech made by
Prof. James K. Pollock. He said
that in the near future Britain and
the United States would have to
undertake alone the rebuilding of
their zones in Germany, if Russia
continued to refuse co-operation
in carrying out the Potsdam agree
ment by making Germany an eco
nomic unit. He also said that such
a course, while unavoidable, would
complete the drawing of a line be
tween East and West.
Keep that in mind while you
consider the present situation
in Paris. Apparently the three
power conference is a failure. If
the omnipresent "usually reliable
sources" can be believed, Molotov
is holding out for a plan that
would require the United States
first to state how much money is
available before any concrete re

covery measures aro considered.
The absurdity of such a stand is
so obvious that I'll say only that,
even if it were right, the United
States Congress would never ap
propriate money on such a blank
check basis. Therefore Mr. Molo
tov is being completely unrealistic
—if he sincerely desires to reach
some agreement.
From the story on page 1 you
know that the French have pre
sented a final "compromise" and
the Soviet foreign minister has
agreed to "consider" it — which
means consulting Moscow. Since
this "compromise" apparently pro
vides for Europe's co-operation on
lines desired by the United States,
acceptance by Russia would call
for a reversal in policy.
Such a reversal is not entirely in
the realm of fantasy. It all de
pends on what the Russians really
want —co-operation or division. If
they accept, it means the former;
if they refuse, it means the latter.
It is now or never, because Foreign
Secretary Bevin of Great Britain
has put the matter on a take-it-or
leave-it basis that is almost an ul
timatum.
If Russia decides to stay home
and play in her own back yard—
along with all the little satellites—
that means all the aid will go to
those countries happy to get any
help whatsoever; countries ready

to help themselves as well as ac
cept presents from abroad.
It certainly won't be the "brave
new world" we thought we were
fighting for, but it will be a great,
deal better than going on the way
we now are. Two years have
passed since war's end and we
have made virtually no progress
toward a better world order in all
that lime.
For what have we now? Lead
ers of nations mouthing their de
sires for co-operation, but doing
things which make that co-opera
tion impossible. Numerous inter
national conferences are called—
but they are conceived, convened,
and carried on in bad faith. Meet
ings are secret, but each delegate
spills out his own version of what
has been going on to the news
papermen of his own nation.
The United States is Var from
blameless in all that has been go
ing on, but I firmly believe that it
is striving for a better world order
in the only way that is likely to
bring success. Only one nation has
consistently refused to make con
cessions, has brushed away every
friendly hand extended to her. You
know which nation that is as well
as I do.
All right; if we can't have what
the great masses of all nations sin
cerely desire—half a world is bet
ter than none.
