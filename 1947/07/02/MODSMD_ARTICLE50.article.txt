# Hair Instead Of Feathers?
## 
### 
The hair of a mammal can be
transplanted to a bird and it will
grow and mature as hair, Dr. Gra
ham P. DuShane told the Tuesday
Evening Series audience last night
at Memorial Auditorium.
''Although the growth of limbs
and epidermis of animals are in
trinsic themselves," Dr. DuShane
explained, "the pigment cells, if
transplanted late in the growth of
the embryo, will remain the same
as those of the original animal."
Dr. DuShane explained, with the
aid of slides, how small migratory
cells spring from the central nervous
system ol' animals and spread
the growth of hair and fur, and to
affect skin color. Thus in grafting
the epidermis of a rat egg onto a
bird egg, "the transplanting must be
done before the color cells have
spread to the epidermis if the rat
skin is desired to grow feathers and
not hair.
"Embryo grafting, introduced in
1880 by a German biologist, might
make it possible to produce animals
like the mythical Greek centaurs,"
Dr. DuShane said.
