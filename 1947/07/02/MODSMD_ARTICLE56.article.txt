The character with the straw hat
in Press Row high atop Cal's Ed
wards Stadium smiled, wagged a
finger in front of our face, and glee
fully remarked: "Goodbye, Western
track!"
"Whaddya mean?" we retaliated.
"We're glad to lose."
Of course, we're referring to the
94 1 3 to 34V> trouncing the Pacific
Coast Conference received at the
hands of the Big Nine. The Western
dynasty of track had fallen, but
never had it fallen in such a satis
factory manner.
HERB TALKS
There was Herb McKenley, the
Jamaica Flyer, fresh from gliding to
a :4G.3 quarter-mile effort. He was
slowly walking around the Edwards
saucer staring bewilderedly at the
ground. Attired in a dark sweat
suit, he was fast becoming "the most
talked-about man in sports today."
We reached the Illini speedster
and casually,, but thoughtfully, plied
him with questions.
"Swell race," we said.
"Thanks," he replied.
"Heat bother you?" we countered.
"A little," the great man an
swered.
The champ, sporting a trim mus
tache, stood up, arms akimbo, and
inhaled deeply. Quite a modest
chap, we admitted to ourselves.
"Really can't say what bothers
me,"' Herb explained. "Felt sorta
sick after that quarter mile."
SHIPKEY JUMPS
Sympathetically, we shook our
head and leveled our sights on Jerry
Shipkey, the bull - necked UCLA
shot putter, who had laughingly
"high jumped" 5 feet, 4 inches, in a
post weights contest with USC's Bill
Bayless.
McKenley, the greatest runner Il
lini Coach Leo Johnson has ever
tutored, continued his stroll along
the Edwards inner circle, good-na
turedly acknowledging the applause
of the crowd.
"Kin I have your autograph,
please?" one moppet wailed; or,
"You gonna run for the United
States in the Olympics?"
Then the tall, lean figure would be
swept away in a sea of well-wishers
offering fatherly advice and anti
quated adjectives.
KLEMMF.R UNASSUMING
Back on the sideline paying par
ticular interest to the scene was
Grover Klemmer, the California
quarter - miler whose unassuming
qualities of friendship know no
bounds.
Klemmer was coaching San Fran
cisco Junior College's jayvee foot
ball team last year and, on one occa
sion, drove us to Berkeley in a
weather - beaten, paint - chipped
Chewy.
"Ever think of training for the
Olympics?" we asked.
"Once," he parried.
"What happened?" we asked.
"Just the thoughl of all that train
ing scared me. It's quite a grind,
yep, quite a grind," he admitted.
MINNESOTA'S FORTUNE
The guy in the straw hat, looking
happier than all get-out, nudged us
in the ribs and said we were looking
at next year's Olympic Games per
formers.
"You take that fellow McKenley
and Patton, and Dillard and Porter,
and we'd have quite a squad."
"You're forgetting about Fortune
Gordien," we said.
"He's good, too," the character
from a Michael Arlen plot remarked.
To straighten the record. Mister
Gordien, the behemoth with the fi
nancial moniker, let fly with a dis
cus heave of more than 172 feet.
Fortune hails from Minnesota.
GLAD TO LOSE
At 6 o'clock, after shaking hands
with a couple of Big Nine visitors,
and wondering how to cope with the
problem of getting home, we vacated
the Edwards oval.
Down near Shattuck Square, the
shades of night had fallen. The guy
with the straw hat was gone. We
were thankful.
"Goodbye. Western track!" he had
said, and thinking of speed-of-foot
McKenley, we could do naught but
wince.
"Yeah," we alibied, "we're gla<t to

"Once," he parried.
"What happened?" we asked.
"Just the thoughl of all that train
ing scared me. It's quite a grind,
yep, quite a grind," he admitted.
MINNESOTA'S FORTUNE
The guy in the straw hat, looking
happier than all get-out, nudged us
in the ribs and said we were looking
at next year's Olympic Games per
formers.
"You take that fellow McKenley
and Patton, and Dillard and Porter,
and we'd have quite a squad."
"You're forgetting about Fortune
Gordien," we said.
"He's good, too," the character
from a Michael Arlen plot remarked.
To straighten the record. Mister
Gordien, the behemoth with the fi
nancial moniker, let fly with a dis
cus heave of more than 172 feet.
Fortune hails from Minnesota.
GLAD TO LOSE
At 6 o'clock, after shaking hands
with a couple of Big Nine visitors,
and wondering how to cope with the
problem of getting home, we vacated
the Edwards oval.
Down near Shattuck Square, the
shades of night had fallen. The guy
with the straw hat was gone. We
were thankful.
"Goodbye. Western track!" he had
said, and thinking of speed-of-foot
McKenley, we could do naught but
wince.
"Yeah," we alibied, "we're gla<t to
lose."
The character with the straw hat
in Press Row high atop Cal's Ed
wards Stadium smiled, wagged a
finger in front of our face, and glee
fully remarked: "Goodbye, Western
track!"
"Whaddya mean?" we retaliated.
"We're glad to lose."
Of course, we're referring to the
94 1 3 to 34V> trouncing the Pacific
Coast Conference received at the
hands of the Big Nine. The Western
dynasty of track had fallen, but
never had it fallen in such a satis
factory manner.
HERB TALKS
There was Herb McKenley, the
Jamaica Flyer, fresh from gliding to
a :4G.3 quarter-mile effort. He was
slowly walking around the Edwards
saucer staring bewilderedly at the
ground. Attired in a dark sweat
suit, he was fast becoming "the most
talked-about man in sports today."
We reached the Illini speedster
and casually,, but thoughtfully, plied
him with questions.
"Swell race," we said.
"Thanks," he replied.
"Heat bother you?" we countered.
"A little," the great man an
swered.
The champ, sporting a trim mus
tache, stood up, arms akimbo, and
inhaled deeply. Quite a modest
chap, we admitted to ourselves.
"Really can't say what bothers
me,"' Herb explained. "Felt sorta
sick after that quarter mile."
SHIPKEY JUMPS
Sympathetically, we shook our
head and leveled our sights on Jerry
Shipkey, the bull - necked UCLA
shot putter, who had laughingly
"high jumped" 5 feet, 4 inches, in a
post weights contest with USC's Bill
Bayless.
McKenley, the greatest runner Il
lini Coach Leo Johnson has ever
tutored, continued his stroll along
the Edwards inner circle, good-na
turedly acknowledging the applause
of the crowd.
"Kin I have your autograph,
please?" one moppet wailed; or,
"You gonna run for the United
States in the Olympics?"
Then the tall, lean figure would be
swept away in a sea of well-wishers
offering fatherly advice and anti
quated adjectives.
KLEMMF.R UNASSUMING
Back on the sideline paying par
ticular interest to the scene was
Grover Klemmer, the California
quarter - miler whose unassuming
qualities of friendship know no
bounds.
Klemmer was coaching San Fran
cisco Junior College's jayvee foot
ball team last year and, on one occa
sion, drove us to Berkeley in a
weather - beaten, paint - chipped
Chewy.
"Ever think of training for the
Olympics?" we asked.
