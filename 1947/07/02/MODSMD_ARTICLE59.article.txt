# 'Bums' Fail To Capture First Spot
## 
### 
NEW YORK, July 1 (UP).â€”The
Brooklyn Dodgers failed to take ad
vantage of an opportunity to gain
undisputed possession of the Na
j tional League lead today when they
sueeumbed to a five-run rally by the
Philadelphia Phillies and lost, 5 to 3.
Trailing the front-running Boston
Braves by only two percentage
j points at the start of today's activity,
the Dodgers thus slipped farther
back into second place.
The Phillies combined five bases
on balls with a pair of hits off Joe
Hatten and his successor, Clyde
I King, for all their five runs in a
I big sixth-inning splurge at Phila
j delphia.
HATTEN FALTERS
i
Southpaw Hatten, who failed to
1 go the distance for the fifth straight
time, was easing along behind a 3
J to 0 lead when he blew up and
I passed Skeeter Newsome, Harry
' Walker and Dick Adams in sucees-
I sion with nobody out.
King then relieved Hatten and
| promptly yielded a double to Jim
I Tabor for two runs. Del Ennis drew
lan intentional base on balls and
| pinch-hitter Johnny Wyrostek got
Jan unintentional walk to tie the
j score. Don Padgett, another pinch
i hitter, then singled to right to pro
! duce the game-winning tallies. Arky
j Vaughan, playing his second game
in the outfield, homered in the fii'st
i inning with Ed Stanky on base.
BENGALS WIN
The Detroit Tigers solidified their
| position in the first division of the
American League on a brilliant
; three-hit pitching job by Big A 1
I Benton, scoring the winning run in
; the eighth on a walk, a fluke hit and
j an error to down the White Sox,
I 2 to 1, at Chicago.
The game-winning tally was
j pushed across when Jimmy Outlaw
! walked, moved to third when in
j fielder Cass Michaels lost Ed Mier
| kowitcz's pop fly in the sun, and
1 scored when catcher George Dickey
j threw into center field in attempting
j to prevent Mierkowitcz from steal
j ing second.
