Lawrence Grannis will spend
most of his time in England, the
Lowlands, and France, while Bill

and Italy.
Hoyt said first reports from the
two men will reach the Daily about

consist of on-the-scene reports. Both
men will organize a complete, for

The bundles were shipped to Europe
last week and will have been dis
