# Bulla Leads At Hoylake
## 
### 
HOYLAKE, Eng., July 1 (UP).—
I The entire American entry of five,
j led by slugging Johnny Bulla of
Phoenix, Ariz., passed the 36 hole
! qualifying test for the British Open
j golf championship today along with
i 95 others who will start frpm scratch
J tomorrow in a 72-hole grind for
slammin' Sam Snead's undefended
crown.
There were grave doubts as the
' second round opened that big Vic
Ghezzi of Kansas City, Kan., could
gain one of the berths in the tourna-
I ment proper but the former P.G.A.
champion, far back in the field with
a 79 yesterday, deliberately whipped
around the Arrowe course today in
35-37—72 for a total of 151, four
strokes better than he needed to
j qualify.
Bulla, starting with a sizzling six
under par 30 at Arrowe, finished
with a 67 to pair with his opening
J 75 for a total of 142 which placed
| him third in the unwieldy group of
j 252 seeking to qualify. His out nine
1 of 30 set a new competitive course
I record for that distance.
