WIMBLEDON, Eng., July 1 (UP).—American tennis forces,
seeking a sweep of Wimbledon titles, won three quarter-final
matches in women's singles today but missed an ail-American
semi-final when Mrs. Sheila Summers of South Africa upset
Mrs. Patricia Canning Todd of La Jolla, California.

The results duplicated Wednes-<
day's men's singles in which top
seeded Jack Kramer, third-seeded
Tom Brown and unseeded Budge
Patty, all of the U.S., moved into
the semi-finals with Dinny Pails of
Australia. Kramer, tow-headed Los
Angeles star, was scheduled against
Pails tomorrow and it was expected
to become an All-American final.
BKOUGH WINS
Playing before 20,000 spectators
who braved a 20-minute summer
shower midway in the matches, the
three star Americans—first-seeded
Margaret Osborne of San Francisco,
second-seeded Louise Brough of
Beverly Hills, Calif., and third
ranked Doris Hart, Miami—showed
power and finesse as they won today.
Miss Osborne, stocky and strong,
was at the top of her game as she
humbled Mrs. Kay Stammers Men
z\c of Britain, 6-2, 6-4. Miss Osborne
won the first four games of each set,
then eased up to allow the Briton
to make the final count respectable.
Miss Brough was no less impres
sive in eliminating Mrs. Nancye
Wynn Bolton of Australia, 6-2, 6-3.
MRS. TODD UPSET
Mrs. Jean Bostock of England
gave Miss Hart a brief scare, but
the hard-hitting American came
through for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory.
Mrs. Bostock. obviously primed for
an upset, started with a surge that
penetrated Miss Hart's usual calm,
and it was not until the second set
that the American regained her
shots.
Mrs. Summers, a tiny but peppery
blonde seeded seventh, registered a
major upset as she ousted the fourth- |
seeded Mrs. Todd, 7-5, 6-4.

the semi-finals with Dinny Pails of
Australia. Kramer, tow-headed Los
Angeles star, was scheduled against
Pails tomorrow and it was expected
to become an All-American final.
BKOUGH WINS
Playing before 20,000 spectators
who braved a 20-minute summer
shower midway in the matches, the
three star Americans—first-seeded
Margaret Osborne of San Francisco,
second-seeded Louise Brough of
Beverly Hills, Calif., and third
ranked Doris Hart, Miami—showed
power and finesse as they won today.
Miss Osborne, stocky and strong,
was at the top of her game as she
humbled Mrs. Kay Stammers Men
z\c of Britain, 6-2, 6-4. Miss Osborne
won the first four games of each set,
then eased up to allow the Briton
to make the final count respectable.
Miss Brough was no less impres
sive in eliminating Mrs. Nancye
Wynn Bolton of Australia, 6-2, 6-3.
MRS. TODD UPSET
Mrs. Jean Bostock of England
gave Miss Hart a brief scare, but
the hard-hitting American came
through for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory.
Mrs. Bostock. obviously primed for
an upset, started with a surge that
penetrated Miss Hart's usual calm,
and it was not until the second set
that the American regained her
shots.
Mrs. Summers, a tiny but peppery
blonde seeded seventh, registered a
major upset as she ousted the fourth- |
seeded Mrs. Todd, 7-5, 6-4.
Quarter-final play in men's dou- i
bles today followed form as Kramer ;
and Bob Falkenburg of Hollywood
defeated Derek Barton and Geof- !
frey Paish of Britain, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4, ;
and Pails and John Bromwich of
Austraila ousted France's Yvon Pe
tra and Pierra Pelizza, 6-4, 11-9. 6-4. I
