# Blues Ace Slated To Be Feted

KANSAS CITY. Mo., July 1 (UP).
—Carl Deßose will don his Kansas
City baseball uniform Friday after
noon for the last time this year.
It may be the last time the big
boy who chucked a perfect ball
game—with an arm so sore each mo
tion brought tears to his eyes—draws
on his spiked shoes. If that's the
way it has to be, then Kansas City
fans want the big pitcher to remem
ber it.
They've earmarked the Fourth of
July doubleheader as "Carl Deßose
Appreciation Day." Between the
games, there will be a little gather
ing out near the white slab he toed
through nine perfect innings of base
ball last week.
BONUS HINTED
And then they'll give Carl Deßose
a check. Nobody knows yet how
big it will be. The way the money
was pouring in today, it may be
$5,000. It might be higher.
Deßose can use the money. Out
at Sonoma, Calif., his wife needs
surgery but can't have it now be
cause she is expecting a baby. The
arm that flashed the fast balls and
the gliders past 27 batters for the
first perfect game ever pitched in
the American Association needs
rest, possibly surgery, if it ever is to
work again.
SURGERY NEEDED
The idea of "Carl Deßose Appre
ciation Day" was born in the mind of
Ben F. Weinberg, hotel man, when
he heard a midnight newscast after
watching the game.
"I'm sure somebody can fix it,"
Deßose said, "and I think Denny
Carroll's the man."
