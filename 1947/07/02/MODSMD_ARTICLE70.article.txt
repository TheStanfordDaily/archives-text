### CECIL ROSPAW 
The first meeting of the summer
for Stanford chapter of AVC was
highlighted last night by a personal
report on the Milwaukee convention
by George Ebey, state chairman of
California and defeated candidate
for the national chairman's spot.
Also reporting were Hal Wise,
chairman for this district; Cecil Ros
paw, member of the State Executive
Committee; Preston Burchard, and
Hal Bailen of the Stanford chapter.
A general feeling was expressed
by Ebey when he made the state
ment that although politically Cali
fornia had not achieved all of its
aims at the convention, views had
been expressed, each side had made
its point, and the thing to do now
was to support the adopted plat
form and elected officers and "build
AVC."
All delegates agreed that attend
ing an AVC convention requires the
stamina of an athlete. Caucuses'
night and day, seemed to be the
main attraction. Ebey said that he
had not been to bed for two days
when he was called upon to make
.his keynote address for the top po
sition.
According to Ebey, the political
side of the convention split delegates
into three groups for the purpose of
electing officers: an "Independent
Progressive" caucus which nominat
ed and elected Chat Paterson, the
"Build AVC" caucus, which nomi
nated Ebey, and the "Unity" cau
cus, which nominated Ken Pettus of
Chicago.
All delegates agreed with Ebey
when he said that now once again
the thing to do was to forget poli
tics for a year and work for AVC
on the chapter and state levels.
