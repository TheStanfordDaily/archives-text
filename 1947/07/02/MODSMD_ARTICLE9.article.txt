# French Compromise; Marshall Lashes Back
## Secretary Denounces Russ Political, Economic Tactics 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 1 (UP).â€”Secretary of
State George C. Marshall struck back hotly at
Russian criticism of his European recovery plan
today, rejecting as a "malicious distortion" the
charge that American offers to help Europe

were inspired by imperialist mo- 4
tives.
Speaking before a luncheon meet
ing of the women's national press
club, the blunt - spoken statesman
lashed out with the bitterest attack
he has yet made against Russia's
political and economic tactics in j
Europe.
He did not mention the Soviet !
Union by name in his prepai'ed ad
dress, but the natui'e of the anti-
American propaganda which he de
nounced left no doubt of his mean- j
ing.
LASIIES BEYOND AUDIENCE
And he made it obvious that his
words were aimed beyond his im
mediate audience to the Paris con
ference hall where an Anglo-
French-Russian parley on the Amer
ican aid program got a last minute
reprieve from collapse under the
weight of Soviet objections.
Significantly, Marshall spoke in
defense of the American aid pro
gram just 24 hours after receiving a
complete report from British Am- !
bassador Lord Inverchapel on the
censored three-power conference in
Paris.
Inverchapel refused to say wheth- ]
er his confidential report was a
gloomy one as hinted at in the few
official announcements from Paris,
but he said his views on the confer
ence were in complete accord with
Marshall's.
U.S. AID NOT CHARITY
Repudiating the "imperialist" mo
tives which Soviet Foreign Minister
V. M. Molotov ascribed to the United
States program. Marshall declared
that American aid was being offered
to Europe not as "charity" but as
this country's contribution to the re
building of a peaceful world.
He cited the United States' record
of military demobilization and its
$9,000.000.000(B) postwar contribu
tion to the stricken peoples of Eu
rope to further refute the charge.
