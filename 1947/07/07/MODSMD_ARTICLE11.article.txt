# Franco's Law of Succession Endorsed by Spanish Vote
## 
### 
MADRID, Spain, July 7 (UP). —Francisco Franco strengthened
his control of Spain today as government officials reported a six
to one majority of Spaniards—in their first trip to the polls in 10
years of dictatorship—endorsed the general's law of succession.
The referendum confirmed Franco as Chief of State, con-

ferred on him the power to pick a
monarch to succeed himself, and
constituted Spain "a Catholic, social,
and representative state which, in
accordance with its tradition, is a
kingdom."
OPPOSITION FROM BASQUES
Despite vigilant police work
which suppressed most open oppo
sition, telephone reports from San
Sebastian, center of the strong
Basque nationalist spirit, said there
wore "incidents" there. There were
no details.
In the heart of old Madrid printed
sheets appeared today on official
government posters urging workers
to vote down "Franco's tyrannical
maneuver." During the campaign
police tore down opposition posters
as soon as they appeared.
VOTING RECORD SET
Returns quoted by government
officials said 80 per cent of the elec
torate had turned out —an all-time
voting l'ecord in Spain—and that 90
per cent of the voters approved the
.succession law. This was equivalent
10 11,880.000 for and 1.320,000
against.
Actually, today's vote on the ref
erendum was the first in Spain in
11 years, since the last election took
place in February 1936, final year of
the republic. The election boards
were the first to be set up by Franco
and were composed of Spaniards

from all walks of life, from minis
ters to scullery maids.
FRANCO HEAI) OF KINGDOM
For the time being the law of suc
cession explicitly says Franco is the
chief of the Catholic kingdom. He
may select his own successor from
a wide list of persons of "regal des
cent," which would allow him to
skip over Don Juan, pretender to
the Spanish throne. He may even
revoke his choice after the Cortes
(Parliament) has approved it.
Fines were imposed on govern
ment employees who did not vote,
and other workers who abstained
were fined 2 per cent of their state
taxes.
