# Evatt Raps US Policies

### 
WASHINGTON. July G (UPU).—
American - Australian relations,
strained by Australian dissatisfac
tion over U.S. occupation policy in
Japan, are boiling toward a major
clash when the Japanese peace con
ference is held.
Diplomatic reports from Austra
lia reveal that Herbert V. Evatt. the
fiery, blunt-spoken Australian for
eign minister, is more than ready to
say a lot of things in public that he
has been thinking privately about
U.S. unilateral direction of Japan.
He will have a chance to tell Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur in person this
week. He planned to leave Austra
lia today for a tour of Japan in pre
paration for next month's British
commonwealth conference in Can
berra on the Japanese peace settle
men.
The basic trouble in American-
Australian relations is Australian
resentment about the secondary po
sition to which it has been relegated
in postwar Far Eastern affairs. Evatt

believes that Australia should play
a leading role in postwar policy to
ward Japan.
In a recent report to the Austral
ian legislature on foreign policy, he
appealed to Great Britain to retain
"real awareness" of what is hap
pening in the Pacific.
