# Unification Bill Slated For Senate Debate Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 6 (UP).—The Senate tomorrow opens
debate on the Army-Navy unification bill, forewarned that failure
to enact it would make the United States the "only major power
that has not modified its military establishment in the light of the
lessons of World War II."
The warnings came from the Senate Armed Services Commit-

tee which approved the measure'
12-0.
Both Senate and House approval
seemed certain. House GOP leaders
have put the bill on the list of "must"
legislation for this session.
TRUMAN REQUESTS BILL
The measure, requested by Presi
dent Truman after a more thorough
going merger was spurned by Con
gress last year, would leave the War
and Navy departments intact but
would place over them a Secretary
of National Security with power to
exercise "general direction, authori
ty and control" over J,he two war
arms.
The Air Forces would be elevated
to equal status with the War and
Navy departments by creating a
Department of Air, which likewise
would be under the overall authority
of the national security secretary.
The army air forces would become
"The United States Air Force."
CABINET REDUCED
The bill would reduce the Presi
dent's cabinet from 10 to nine mem
bers. The War and Navy secretar
ies would become secretaries of
army and navy without cabinet rank.
They would however, have the right,
together with the secretary of air,
to appeal directly to the President
against rulings of the security sec
retary.
The top secretary would take the
place of the war and navy secre
taries in the cabinet. All secretaries
would remain civilians.
Opponents of the bill, who con
cede privately that it will pass are
prepared to argue that it would
"turn the whole country oveV to the
army."
In its present form the measure
has the public support of Secretary
of War Robert P. Patterson, Sec
retary of the Navy James Forrestal
and Marine Corps Commandant
Gen. A. A. Vandergrift.
