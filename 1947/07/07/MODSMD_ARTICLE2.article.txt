# Union Deadlocks Over Labor Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 6 (UPU). â€”A
deadlock involving the Taft-Hartley
Labor Act developed in wage ne
gotiations between northern coal
operators and president John L.
Lewis of the United Mine Workers
AFL, today, raising the prospects of
another soft coal strike Tuesday.
Although "some progress" was
made in today's extraordinary seven
hour parley, UMW and operators
representatives were still at odds
over the wording of a section of the
contract granting immunities to the
UMW from some restrictions of the
recently-enacted Taft-Hartley law.
The parleys will be resumed tomor
row morning.
