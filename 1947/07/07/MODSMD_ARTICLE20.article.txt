The Manor, a grind house operating on El Camino up San Mateo
way, has been dirtying up the area with flashy come-ons about a redhot
hygiene movie called "Mom and Dad," and it has even paid out good
money to advertise this film in The Daily. Evidently the promoters
behind this pitch have figured that college students in particular are
ready customers for a picture advertised as dealing "frankly with a
subject rarely spoken of above a whisper." We will have to take this
to mean sex, unless they're dealing with something a little more occult.
The Manor Theater is advertising with a straight face that it is
screening this art "in the interest of public service," and it is so pious
about this that it is showing "Mom and Dad" to segregated audiences
only, so if you want to take along your wife or the girl friend, or even
Mom and Dad themselves, you'll have to arrange to meet them after the
show, because the Manor is making sure you don't get the revelation
while you're sitting together. After the show it will be all right for
you to find each other and speak of this subject, but not above that
whisper. Not till you get out of San Mateo, anyway.
I presume the Manor Theater also thought it in the public interest
to bill this sideshow as having an "All-Star Hollywood Cast," which
we all know by now, whenever we see it under the title of any
picture, is just bunk. When you run across that "All-Star Hollywood
Cast" gimmick you know for sure there isn't a soul in the picture you
ever heard of and anybody who is in it needed a meal pretty badly and
probably couldn't even land a fellowship with the Stanford Players.
Also in the public interest, I guess, is some jackdaw by the name of
Elliot Forbes who is making personal appearances with the movie.
"Fearless Hygiene Commentator" is what the ad layouts have been
calling him, and you can just see Fearless Forbes in some kind of
men-in-white getup whispering about what happened to "Mom and
Dad," or Junior and Sis, or whoever got loused up in the plot.
Now the Legion of Decency is squawking and wants a padlock
clapped on in a hurry, but San Mateo>'s chief of police has passed the
potato to the district attorney's office and the county probation officer,
and this last official has gone to see the movie and pronounced it an
artistic dud without bothering to say whether it's fit to show in the com
munity. He just says it's poor and it's boring, which is about what you'd
have expected all along, but now of course the Legion has excited
hundreds of kids into long lines at the Manor box office.
Actually, the Manor has been wasting the good money it's made
out of the public interest by advertising this lemon in a college news
paper. I don't know but what the files in the Dean's office would show
us how long a time it's been since sex has been spoken of in whispers
at Stanford, and Fearless Forbes ought to bum a ride down here and
listen to it being caterwauled all over the countryside. I can't see
how they could have sucked one student off the campus unless a bunch
got beered up one night and went up for the laughs. "Hygienic Pro
ductions," the ads read, "present a picture vitally important to the rising
generation," but Hygienic Productions and their local showroom, the
Manor, ought to know that the rising generation is a wise one, unless
they have reference to the generation rising in the grammar schoolsâ€”
and I don't know about them, either.
If the neighborhood entertainment brokers want to throw a sex
pitch, they ought to junk "Mom and Dad" and that "All-Star Holly
wood Cast" and dig up some living articles. Back in the thirties a
carnival crowd used to camp over in Menlo every year, pound in
their stakes for a few weeks, and trot out a kootch dancer you could
see most of in one tent for a quarter and all of her in another tent for an
extra six bits. This kid had never starred in Hollywood as far as I know,
but she gave the freshmen an honest run for their dollar and she didn't
have to have anybody like Fearless Forbes around to cheer her on.
