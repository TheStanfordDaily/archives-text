# Acapulco Out of Season, But Still Mucho Caliente

ACAPULCO, Mexico — Admit
ting that Acapulco is out of season
right now — that the Americanos
are scarce and not yet inhabit
ing the luxurious hotels here —this
beach of a thousand sunburns is
still the most truthfully advertised
resort in all Mexico.
Last night, under a full tropical
moon, Quebrada was alive and
throbbing with native rhythm as
the residents of this usually tour
ist - invaded seaport danced at
their weekly fiesta. Surprisingly
enough, here as elsewhere south
of the border, American jazz is
popular.
Quebrada, by the way, is a jut
ting rock some 500 feet above the
breakers—and the stage for some
of the most hair-breadth scenes in
these climes. Native boys make
their living by diving of! the Que
brada rocks into oncoming break
ers. The stunt sounds easy enough,
and pecuniarily gratifying, except
when you consider the risks taken.
The fact is that below the rocks
is shallow water made safe for
divers only when big breakers
crash in from the sea in eddying
pools. The diver, usually a bronzed
expert by the time he's made five

attempts, must calculate to the in
stant just when the breakers will
roll in—so that there'll be enough
water. Mistaken calculations mean
broken necks and the end of a
promising career.
Before each dive the hat is
passed. Monetary acquisitions
from each dive usually aggregate
about 50 pesos—which is about 10
United States dollars.
Right now the luxurious hotels
— styled American but uniquely
built high above the tropical seas
— are deserted and awaiting the
season which will not begin until
October. It's probably just as well
the Cadillac crowd is still States
bound; I can imagine the horror
of the new and uninitiated chauf
feurs as they try driving Acapulco
streets for the first time. After
three flat tires in four streets
they'll begin to realize that even in
much - vaunted, superbly publi
cized Acapulco, the streets leave
something to be desired.
But this southern Mexican beach
resort lives up to expectations
most handsomely. And so do the
bronzed senoritas who inhabit
those American - style two - piece
affairs which seem to belong to
Acapulco beaches.
