# Peace Threat Is Economic, Says Maurois

PARIS (UP). —The danger of a
third world war lies mainly in the
possibility of serious internal eco
nomic disturbances in Europe, An
dre Maurois, noted French writer
and philosopher, believes.
In an interview, Maurois told the
correspondent he thinks Europe's
potentially explosive economic sit
uation is a far more disturbing ele
ment to world peace than the
antagonism between the United
Slates and Russia.
The United States, he said, can
make a great contribution toward
averting a civilization - shattering
new war by facing up to it.s re
sponsibilities and providing finan
cial and economic aid necessary to
Europe's recovery.
"The future of the world de
pends on the United States being
well informed on Europe and on
its helping Europe out of its eco
nomic difficulties," Maurois said.
WAR COSTS MONEY
"In terms of cash, a third world
war would cost America billions,
so it would logically be better to
spend half that amount trying to
avoid the war — especially since
another war inevitably would
mean the end of civilization."
Maurois said he believed Ameri
cans did not know enough about
France and European nations.
"In a way that is natural, be
cause the United Slates is such a
vast country," he pointed out. "But
I believe it has acquired a sort of
superiority complex, resulting per
haps in not enough desire to know
what happens outside it."
WORLD STATE
Maurois declared that civiliza
tion's only hope of averting com
plete destruction through a new
war lies in the formation of a
world state. He expressed confi
dence that the nations of the world
will realize the need for closer co
operation and will settle their
problems without recourse to war.
"There will be no third world
war unless everyone goes mad,"
Maurois added. "And although
there is always a possibility that
everyone will go mad, I don't think
it will happen.
"I think we are moving toward
a world state. There is no other
solution. Of course, it will take
time. But it is the only alternative
to a third world war."
