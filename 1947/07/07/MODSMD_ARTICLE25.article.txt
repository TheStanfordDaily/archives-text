"These are the times that try
men's souls."
If the man who uttered these
words, Tom Paine, were alive to
day he would probably end up in a
psych ward muttering that phrase
over and over.
Paine was somewhat of a liberal
in his day and age, and I would
imagine that he would be fighting
for the same things now that he
fought for then, generally, the
rights of man, and the end of man's
inhumanity to man.
But I would imagine that Tom
Paine would never have a mo
ment's peace. One morning he
would open a paper to find that
he was a "Communist," the next
morning he would be a "Fascist."
Why did Paine, when he trav
eled to France, almost lose his
head on the guillotine during the
"bloody days" when many of his
pamphleteering phrases were the
phrases of the early French revo
lution?
I think that the answer might be
found in the fact that Tom Paine
wanted change, but that he also
wanted to keep his independence.
That he asked for democratic so
cial upheaval and refused to iden
tify himself wtih any side or any
party. The Jacobins and Robes
pierre operated on much the same
principle that the Bolsheviks oper

ated on during the Russian revo
lution: "If they aren't with us they
must he against us, and we must
consider these people as enemies."
Recently I heard a rather ob
scure, but astute, liberal make this
statement: "There is no middle
ground, there is only left or right,
and we must choose the side we
prefer and fight it out to the fin
ish."
It was an amazing statement, for
this man had always been the Tom
Paine type of liberal and had al
ways fought, not only for his own
views, but had fought for a coali
tion viewpoint, and had never ac
cepted a thesis that called for
"choosing sides." Yet today he
feels that in order to be effective
politically he must identify him
self with a political philosophy
which he cannot support to the
fullest degree.
There is some basis for this type
of thought. If the unions were
strong, could the Taft-Hartley La
bor Bill have been passed? I
hardly think so. Why was the un
ion fight on this measure so weak
ly fought by the organizations
which it affected so directly?
To the authors of the bill all
members of a union are of the
same ilk, and seem to present a
united front. Yet on close investi
gation we find that Bob Nathen

and George Addes, both big names
in the CIO, are bitter enemies,
represent two schools of thought,
belong to different political parties,
and spend a lot of their time in
internal union politics.
The AFL has a similar situation,
with the semi-independent Dave
Dubinsky, of the Garment Work
ers' Union, and John L. Lewis rep
resenting a "right-wing" group and
many lesser lights representing a
"left-wing" group.
Yes, Mr. Paine, these certainly
are "times that try men's souls."
But I do feel, and hope, that my
friend was wrong. I do feel that
there is a "middle ground." 1 do
feel that the old American spirit
of compromise, and I am not refer
ring to Tris Coffin's Missouri type
either, will win out.
That we will discover once more,
as we did in the 1920'5, that the
Communist issue in America is a
red herring. That our native Com
munists, though vocal, are small in
number as yet, and that there are
many bigger and more vital ques
tions to be solved internally, and
that we will rise above some of
these factional disputes, find a
path unidentified with "left" or
right," and rededicate ourselves to
making America a force for peace
throughout the world.

would open a paper to find that
he was a "Communist," the next
morning he would be a "Fascist."
Why did Paine, when he trav
eled to France, almost lose his
head on the guillotine during the
"bloody days" when many of his
pamphleteering phrases were the
phrases of the early French revo
lution?
I think that the answer might be
found in the fact that Tom Paine
wanted change, but that he also
wanted to keep his independence.
That he asked for democratic so
cial upheaval and refused to iden
tify himself wtih any side or any
party. The Jacobins and Robes
pierre operated on much the same
principle that the Bolsheviks oper

ated on during the Russian revo
lution: "If they aren't with us they
must he against us, and we must
consider these people as enemies."
Recently I heard a rather ob
scure, but astute, liberal make this
statement: "There is no middle
ground, there is only left or right,
and we must choose the side we
prefer and fight it out to the fin
ish."
It was an amazing statement, for
this man had always been the Tom
Paine type of liberal and had al
ways fought, not only for his own
views, but had fought for a coali
tion viewpoint, and had never ac
cepted a thesis that called for
"choosing sides." Yet today he
feels that in order to be effective
politically he must identify him
self with a political philosophy
which he cannot support to the
fullest degree.
There is some basis for this type
of thought. If the unions were
strong, could the Taft-Hartley La
bor Bill have been passed? I
hardly think so. Why was the un
ion fight on this measure so weak
ly fought by the organizations
which it affected so directly?
To the authors of the bill all
members of a union are of the
same ilk, and seem to present a
united front. Yet on close investi
gation we find that Bob Nathen

and George Addes, both big names
in the CIO, are bitter enemies,
represent two schools of thought,
belong to different political parties,
and spend a lot of their time in
internal union politics.
The AFL has a similar situation,
with the semi-independent Dave
Dubinsky, of the Garment Work
ers' Union, and John L. Lewis rep
resenting a "right-wing" group and
many lesser lights representing a
"left-wing" group.
Yes, Mr. Paine, these certainly
are "times that try men's souls."
But I do feel, and hope, that my
friend was wrong. I do feel that
there is a "middle ground." 1 do
feel that the old American spirit
of compromise, and I am not refer
ring to Tris Coffin's Missouri type
either, will win out.
That we will discover once more,
as we did in the 1920'5, that the
Communist issue in America is a
red herring. That our native Com
munists, though vocal, are small in
number as yet, and that there are
many bigger and more vital ques
tions to be solved internally, and
that we will rise above some of
these factional disputes, find a
path unidentified with "left" or
right," and rededicate ourselves to
making America a force for peace
throughout the world.
"These are the times that try
men's souls."
If the man who uttered these
words, Tom Paine, were alive to
day he would probably end up in a
psych ward muttering that phrase
over and over.
Paine was somewhat of a liberal
in his day and age, and I would
imagine that he would be fighting
for the same things now that he
fought for then, generally, the
rights of man, and the end of man's
inhumanity to man.
But I would imagine that Tom
Paine would never have a mo
ment's peace. One morning he
would open a paper to find that
he was a "Communist," the next
