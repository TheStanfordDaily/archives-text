# 'Ice Follies of 1947' Again Better Than Ever Before
## 
### 
Every evening about 10:30 during I
the summer months a crowd of peo- !
pie file out of jam-packcd Winter
land in San Francisco exclaiming,
"It's better than ever before." These
same people have been saying this
for 11 years now, and the amazing
thing is that they are right—every
year the Ice Follies has consistently
provided better and better enter
tainment.
We remember seeing the Ice Fol- i
lies in 1940, '41, and '42 and thinking I
each year that the show had reached
its peak. The Follies simply was so j
good we could think of no way of
improving the performance.
Again in 1946 we saw the Follies ;
hit a new high. We were so im
pressed with last year's product that :
our only hope last week when we j
went up to the City was that this I

year's show would equal the pre
vious one.
We were disappointed in one re
spect. We cSme away with the feel- |
ing that the Ice Follies should have
lasted at least another 60 minutes, j
Watching any ONE of the many
acts for the full two and a half hours
would have made us happy.
All the old stars of the Follies
are back. Frick and Frack, the in
imitable Swiss comics, are together
again, still spell-binding spectators
with their rubber-legs routine and
the amazing trick of skating in a
sitting position or with the back of
their heads almost touching the ice.
Speed-king Harris Legg, looking
like a Buck Rogers creation in a
suit of silver scales, accounts for
himself quite creditably by making
his 20-foot leaps on skates. And his
jump through a flaming globe of
revolving hoops puts spectatox-s on
the edge of their seats.
STAR TURNS
The Maxson twins, Roy Shipstad.
and Evelyn Chandler all turn in
performances which would entitle
them to star in a complete show of
their own.
Of the massed numbers, the
Scotch drill performance and the
fluorescent spectacle stood out best
in our mind. The latter number was
particularly good. The brightly col
ored costumes and sets take on an
eerie and wonderful appearance un
der the fluorescent lights that is like :
nothing in this world.
NO FAULTS
We could find little fault with the I
Follies. But if we do criticize any
part of the show, it must fall on |
the programming. We would rather
have liked to see more of the indi
vidual stars in place of some of the
chorus numbers. However, that is
only a personal choice.
As far as we're concerned, Holly
wood can keep its milllion-dollar
flopperoos, and legitimate stage pro
ductions can stay east of the Mis- i
sissippi. Just give us the Ice Follies
once a year.—Dave Martin

pie file out of jam-packcd Winter
land in San Francisco exclaiming,
"It's better than ever before." These
same people have been saying this
for 11 years now, and the amazing
thing is that they are right—every
year the Ice Follies has consistently
provided better and better enter
tainment.
We remember seeing the Ice Fol- i
lies in 1940, '41, and '42 and thinking I
each year that the show had reached
its peak. The Follies simply was so j
good we could think of no way of
improving the performance.
Again in 1946 we saw the Follies ;
hit a new high. We were so im
pressed with last year's product that :
our only hope last week when we j
went up to the City was that this I

year's show would equal the pre
vious one.
We were disappointed in one re
spect. We cSme away with the feel- |
ing that the Ice Follies should have
lasted at least another 60 minutes, j
Watching any ONE of the many
acts for the full two and a half hours
would have made us happy.
All the old stars of the Follies
are back. Frick and Frack, the in
imitable Swiss comics, are together
again, still spell-binding spectators
with their rubber-legs routine and
the amazing trick of skating in a
sitting position or with the back of
their heads almost touching the ice.
Speed-king Harris Legg, looking
like a Buck Rogers creation in a
suit of silver scales, accounts for
himself quite creditably by making
his 20-foot leaps on skates. And his
jump through a flaming globe of
revolving hoops puts spectatox-s on
the edge of their seats.
STAR TURNS
The Maxson twins, Roy Shipstad.
and Evelyn Chandler all turn in
performances which would entitle
them to star in a complete show of
their own.
Of the massed numbers, the
Scotch drill performance and the
fluorescent spectacle stood out best
in our mind. The latter number was
particularly good. The brightly col
ored costumes and sets take on an
eerie and wonderful appearance un
der the fluorescent lights that is like :
nothing in this world.
NO FAULTS
We could find little fault with the I
Follies. But if we do criticize any
part of the show, it must fall on |
the programming. We would rather
have liked to see more of the indi
vidual stars in place of some of the
chorus numbers. However, that is
only a personal choice.
As far as we're concerned, Holly
wood can keep its milllion-dollar
flopperoos, and legitimate stage pro
ductions can stay east of the Mis- i
sissippi. Just give us the Ice Follies
once a year.—Dave Martin
