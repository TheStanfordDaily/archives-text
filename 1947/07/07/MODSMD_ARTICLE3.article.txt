NEW YORK's Gov. Thomas E. Dewey made bids among the Oklahoma
Republicans for the presidential nomination yesterday and found
that the votes there are divided among himself, Harold Stassen, and

of Missouri, predicted that Dewey will be nominated on the first ballot
at the GOP convention in Philadelphia.
