## Sidelights 
### 
About seven weeks ago we wan
dered over to the Sunken Diamond
where the Farm baseballers were
going through their paces under the
watchful eye of Harry Wolter, Stan
ford's veteran diamond mentor. In
evitably, the talk got around to the
then-hot Coast Intercollegiate Base
ball Association pennant race.
Yet, though Wolter opined that
Cal would take the flag eventually,
the comment that stuck most in our
memory was this:
"You know, this CIBA is a tough
league, especially this year. And
St's as good if not belter than any
other college conference — whoever
wins the pennant here is going to
go a long way in the national cham
pionships this summer. At least,
their chances will be very good."
HE WAS RIGHT
As it turned out, he called the
turn, for the Golden Bears eventu
ally nosed out Southern Cal in a
post-season playoff and went on to
romp through all opposition to win
the national crown.
They knocked off USC and Stan
ford in the last two regular season
games, then beat Southern Cal
again in the CIBA playoffs, defeated
the champions of the northern West
Coast in two abbreviated, muddy
games, and then went on to beat
Denver, Texas, and Yale (twice) in
a whirlwind finish.
BEARS LOST FIVE
But, in their own league, the boys
from Cal were beaten five times,
and a goodly portion of their ten
conference victories were by the
narrow margin of one run.
In other words, the national
champions who humbled the best
intersectional teams at the end of
the season weren't kingpins in their
own league by any means, and next
year, national title or not, they're
going to be as hard pressed to cop
the flag as they were this year.
For none of the eight CIBA teams
are losing many topflight players;
most of the teams will be tougher,
if anything, and next spring they'll
turn the CIBA race into a more
topsy-turvy affair than it was this
last season. Cal, USC, and yes, Stan
ford will be up there clawing it out
for the title, and right behind them
will be three rough teams that are
each capable of routing any of the
top dogs at the drop of the hat.
Yes, Cal won the nationals, and
we were glad to see it; after all, the
Bears were the CIBA's representa
tives. But next spring, Cal, look out!
Your own back yard is going to be
crammed full of tough squads with
but one thought—' Beat Cal!"

post-season playoff and went on to
romp through all opposition to win
the national crown.
They knocked off USC and Stan
ford in the last two regular season
games, then beat Southern Cal
again in the CIBA playoffs, defeated
the champions of the northern West
Coast in two abbreviated, muddy
games, and then went on to beat
Denver, Texas, and Yale (twice) in
a whirlwind finish.
BEARS LOST FIVE
But, in their own league, the boys
from Cal were beaten five times,
and a goodly portion of their ten
conference victories were by the
narrow margin of one run.
In other words, the national
champions who humbled the best
intersectional teams at the end of
the season weren't kingpins in their
own league by any means, and next
year, national title or not, they're
going to be as hard pressed to cop
the flag as they were this year.
For none of the eight CIBA teams
are losing many topflight players;
most of the teams will be tougher,
if anything, and next spring they'll
turn the CIBA race into a more
topsy-turvy affair than it was this
last season. Cal, USC, and yes, Stan
ford will be up there clawing it out
for the title, and right behind them
will be three rough teams that are
each capable of routing any of the
top dogs at the drop of the hat.
Yes, Cal won the nationals, and
we were glad to see it; after all, the
Bears were the CIBA's representa
tives. But next spring, Cal, look out!
Your own back yard is going to be
crammed full of tough squads with
but one thought—' Beat Cal!"
About seven weeks ago we wan
dered over to the Sunken Diamond
where the Farm baseballers were
going through their paces under the
watchful eye of Harry Wolter, Stan
ford's veteran diamond mentor. In
evitably, the talk got around to the
then-hot Coast Intercollegiate Base
ball Association pennant race.
Yet, though Wolter opined that
Cal would take the flag eventually,
the comment that stuck most in our
memory was this:
"You know, this CIBA is a tough
league, especially this year. And
St's as good if not belter than any
other college conference — whoever
wins the pennant here is going to
go a long way in the national cham
pionships this summer. At least,
their chances will be very good."
HE WAS RIGHT
As it turned out, he called the
turn, for the Golden Bears eventu
