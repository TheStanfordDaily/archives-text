# Invitational Starts Oil Friday
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
The West's toughest golfing layout lies in ambush for more
than 200 links hopefuls this Friday and Saturday morning when
qualifying rounds in the 12th annual Stanford Invitational Golf
Tournament are staged.
And a general alarm was spread when it was feared "that

members of the Stanford golf team
would be missing from action." The
whereabouts of Bob Rosburg, Bob
Cardinal, Tom Lambie et al, are still
clothed in mystery as far as tourney
chairman Lee Gurley is concerned.
Nevertheless, the challenge of
"Operations Impossible" has been
accepted by such area standouts as
Tal Smith, ex-State Open king; War
ren Berl, only two-time winner of
the event; Bill Higgins, the golfing
ink man; Sandy Tatum, ex-Card
star; and Alt' Brandin, Stanford
business manager, no less.
RECORD FIELD
There are others, including several
local links scribes, which prompts
Gurley to admit it may be "a record
field of entries." First round play
is slated Friday and Saturday, match
play to be scheduled all next week.
Two flights of competition—cham
pionship and handicap—are in the
offing pitted against medalist hon
ors, low net laurels, and a special
"hole in one" contest on the eighth
hole, a straightaway 132 yard hole.
Fitting climax to initial tours of
action on Saturday is a barbecue
dance for tourney participants and
their friends at Adobe Creek Lodge
in Los Altos, starting at 7 p.m.
SMITH HAS WOES
Defending champ is, of course,
Smith of Alameda, who last year
posted a 54 hole total of 211. As of
late, the blond Smith has been hav
ing his troubles, bowing out in the
Alameda City championships to
Dick Montgomery.
Preliminary dark horse threats
loom in the personages of Tom
Dwyer, recent winner of the Menlo
invitational. Bob Roos, and Cece
West. All told, the entries have
been pouring in rather slowly, Gur
ley is forced to admit, and a cascade
of last minute entries is expected.
FARM COURSE IS TOUGH
That the Farm course is a divot
nemesis was given added impetus
by genial Eddie Twiggs, Stanford
| golf coach.
"It's a pretty tough course, all
right," Eddie declared. "If they
shoot par golf at Stanford, they can
shoot it almost anywhere else in
the country."
All in all, the Farm green is due
tor a veritable onslaught by the
j gabardine slacks set, a record field
| this year, imbued with a fervent
j determination to shatter par.

Two flights of competition—cham
pionship and handicap—are in the
offing pitted against medalist hon
ors, low net laurels, and a special
"hole in one" contest on the eighth
hole, a straightaway 132 yard hole.
Fitting climax to initial tours of
action on Saturday is a barbecue
dance for tourney participants and
their friends at Adobe Creek Lodge
in Los Altos, starting at 7 p.m.
SMITH HAS WOES
Defending champ is, of course,
Smith of Alameda, who last year
posted a 54 hole total of 211. As of
late, the blond Smith has been hav
ing his troubles, bowing out in the
Alameda City championships to
Dick Montgomery.
Preliminary dark horse threats
loom in the personages of Tom
Dwyer, recent winner of the Menlo
invitational. Bob Roos, and Cece
West. All told, the entries have
been pouring in rather slowly, Gur
ley is forced to admit, and a cascade
of last minute entries is expected.
FARM COURSE IS TOUGH
That the Farm course is a divot
nemesis was given added impetus
by genial Eddie Twiggs, Stanford
| golf coach.
"It's a pretty tough course, all
right," Eddie declared. "If they
shoot par golf at Stanford, they can
shoot it almost anywhere else in
the country."
All in all, the Farm green is due
tor a veritable onslaught by the
j gabardine slacks set, a record field
| this year, imbued with a fervent
j determination to shatter par.
The West's toughest golfing layout lies in ambush for more
than 200 links hopefuls this Friday and Saturday morning when
qualifying rounds in the 12th annual Stanford Invitational Golf
Tournament are staged.
And a general alarm was spread when it was feared "that

members of the Stanford golf team
would be missing from action." The
whereabouts of Bob Rosburg, Bob
Cardinal, Tom Lambie et al, are still
clothed in mystery as far as tourney
chairman Lee Gurley is concerned.
Nevertheless, the challenge of
"Operations Impossible" has been
accepted by such area standouts as
Tal Smith, ex-State Open king; War
ren Berl, only two-time winner of
the event; Bill Higgins, the golfing
ink man; Sandy Tatum, ex-Card
star; and Alt' Brandin, Stanford
business manager, no less.
RECORD FIELD
There are others, including several
local links scribes, which prompts
Gurley to admit it may be "a record
field of entries." First round play
is slated Friday and Saturday, match
play to be scheduled all next week.
