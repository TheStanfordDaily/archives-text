# France to Publish 'Yellow Book' As Reply to Challenge of Molotov
## 
### 
PARIS, July 6 (UP). â€”France plans to publish in the next few
days an official "yellow book" giving in full documents and
diplomatic conversations exchanged in the Big Three conference
here which resulted in the Russian boycott of the Marshall Euro
pean recovery plan, it was made known today.

The publication will constitute a<
reply, on a major basis, to the chal
lenge Russian Foreign Minister Vi
acheslav Molotov made at the final
Big Three session when he prom
ised Russia would publish the final
statements of the chief delegates
and asked that Britain and France
do likewise.
Hope rose today that Czechoslo
vakia and Poland might attend the
24-nation Marshall plan conference
which starts here Saturday, in addi
tion to all or nearly all invited coun
tries outside the Soviet iron cur
tain.
It was indicated that both the
Czechoslovak and Polish govern
ments were now in contact with
Russia, expressing their desire to
attend the conference.
There seemed no prospect that
other countries in the Russian
sphere would have the necessary
daring to attend.
