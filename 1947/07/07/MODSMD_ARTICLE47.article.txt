# Bobby Locke Ties Oliver In Tam O'Shanter Test
## 
### 
CHICAGO, July 6 (UP). —Bobby Locke sank a hesitant two
foot putt on the 18th green of the Tam O'Shanter course today to
tie Ed (Porky) Oliver for first place in the $30,000 All-American
golf sweepstakes.
Locke and Oliver will begin a 36-hole playoff for the $7,000

first prize money tomorrow, playing
18 holes then with an additional 18
on Tuesday. The runner-up will get
$3,333.50.
Both men had 72-hole medal
scores of 276, but it was Locke,
winner of four tourneys in 14 weeks
in the United States, who came from
behind to move into a deadlock with
the Wilmington, Del., star.
PUTT ALMOST MISSES
Locke's tie-making putt looked
like a failure, and failure was writ
ten on his face, as the ball hung
on the lip of the hole for at least a
lull second before some twist of the
grass allowed it to drop.
Locke had a one-under-par 71 for
today's 18 hole round while Oliver,
pacemaker of the tournament since
it began Thursday, took a 74. It
was Porky's poorest round. Earlier
he had posted a 66, a 65, and a 71.
Locke stayed with him on the first
round with a 66, but then he slipped
to a 68 on the second 18 holes to
! fall three strokes behind. He stayed
that way until today. Then he began
J the uphill fight for the $7,000.
MAKES COMEBACK
After the first nine holes of today's
round Locke had cut the edge to
two strokes, and then on the 440 yard
par-four 12th where Oliver was
! trapped and took a bogie five, Locke
1 reached the green in three and
j slapped in an 18 foot putt to tie.
On the 445 yard where Oliver had
scored a par four, lucky Bobby
j knocked home a 10-footer and was
I one stroke ahead. He held that mar
■ gin on the 14th. Although his ball
; was caught in a trap and he missed
i a nine toot putt, his bogie was no
| worse than Oliver's score for the
| same hole.
Then Locke had the bad one, a
bogie six on the 15th. He had a
I good drive, but his second went into
j the rough and his chip smashed hard
j into a tree and stopped dead. He
reached the green on the next shot.
! but it took him two putts to get
j home.
THE IST SI HOLE
That deadlocked the match and it
; was par all the way in for both of
• them, but luck nearly deserted
i Locke on the 18th. He was far down
| the fairway with his drive, his sec
| ond was on the green, 25 feet down
I hill from the hole. His first putt was
| slow on the soggy green and it stop-
I ped two feet away.
Bobby stepped up, and it was ob
vious he knew he was putting for
a chance at $7,000. He measured the
distance carefully, bent to examine
the ground, lined up the ball and
swung. Again it was slow, but it
reached the edge and stopped.
The crowd had begun to groan,
J Locke's face had fallen, and then
j the ball fell. Bobby's grin was as
1 wide as his face.

CHICAGO, July 6 (UP). —Bobby Locke sank a hesitant two
foot putt on the 18th green of the Tam O'Shanter course today to
tie Ed (Porky) Oliver for first place in the $30,000 All-American
golf sweepstakes.
Locke and Oliver will begin a 36-hole playoff for the $7,000

first prize money tomorrow, playing
18 holes then with an additional 18
on Tuesday. The runner-up will get
$3,333.50.
Both men had 72-hole medal
scores of 276, but it was Locke,
winner of four tourneys in 14 weeks
in the United States, who came from
behind to move into a deadlock with
the Wilmington, Del., star.
PUTT ALMOST MISSES
Locke's tie-making putt looked
like a failure, and failure was writ
ten on his face, as the ball hung
on the lip of the hole for at least a
lull second before some twist of the
grass allowed it to drop.
Locke had a one-under-par 71 for
today's 18 hole round while Oliver,
pacemaker of the tournament since
it began Thursday, took a 74. It
was Porky's poorest round. Earlier
he had posted a 66, a 65, and a 71.
Locke stayed with him on the first
round with a 66, but then he slipped
to a 68 on the second 18 holes to
! fall three strokes behind. He stayed
that way until today. Then he began
J the uphill fight for the $7,000.
MAKES COMEBACK
After the first nine holes of today's
round Locke had cut the edge to
two strokes, and then on the 440 yard
par-four 12th where Oliver was
! trapped and took a bogie five, Locke
1 reached the green in three and
j slapped in an 18 foot putt to tie.
On the 445 yard where Oliver had
scored a par four, lucky Bobby
j knocked home a 10-footer and was
I one stroke ahead. He held that mar
■ gin on the 14th. Although his ball
; was caught in a trap and he missed
i a nine toot putt, his bogie was no
| worse than Oliver's score for the
| same hole.
Then Locke had the bad one, a
bogie six on the 15th. He had a
I good drive, but his second went into
j the rough and his chip smashed hard
j into a tree and stopped dead. He
reached the green on the next shot.
! but it took him two putts to get
j home.
THE IST SI HOLE
That deadlocked the match and it
; was par all the way in for both of
• them, but luck nearly deserted
i Locke on the 18th. He was far down
| the fairway with his drive, his sec
| ond was on the green, 25 feet down
I hill from the hole. His first putt was
| slow on the soggy green and it stop-
I ped two feet away.
Bobby stepped up, and it was ob
vious he knew he was putting for
a chance at $7,000. He measured the
distance carefully, bent to examine
the ground, lined up the ball and
swung. Again it was slow, but it
reached the edge and stopped.
