# Baksi Loses In Sweden
## 
### 
STOCKHOLM. July C. (UP).—Olio 1
Tandberg of Sweden scored the big- j
gest upset in the heavyweight divi- j
slon in 11 years tonight when he j
defeated Joe Bnksi, America's top
contender, but there was so much i
controversy over the decision that j
the Swede may not get his promised
championship bout with Joe Louis.
After the 10-round fight before j
30,000 fans at the Rasunda soccer j
grounds, Lew Burston, representa
tive of IVJike Jacobs' 20th Century
Club, said his organization would
have to await American press reac
tion before deciding whether Tand
berg should be matched with cham
pion Louis at New York on Sept. 19.
'WE WIIZ ROBBED'
Despite the unexpectedly stiff op
position provided by tall, blond
Tandberg, Burston said he thought
Baksi of Kulpmont, Pa., should have
won the decision.
Burston agreed partially with
Baksi's manager, Nate Wolfson, who
gave off a polite version of the "we
wuz-robbed" yell. Wolfson angrily
declared that the decision was a dis
grace."

CHICAGO, July 6 (UP). —
Heavyweight champion Joe Louis
was nonplussed and noncommittal
today when he learned of Joe
Baksi's upset defeat hy Swedish
heavyweight champion Olle Tand
berg.
"Wasn't that a surprise?" he
said.
"I don't know anything about
Tandberg," he went on. "but he
must be a pretty good boxer."

dish sports history—gave Tandberg
a huge ovation after his victory over
Baksi, who had entered the ring fa
vored at 3-1 to knock out Olle with
in seven rounds. They witnessed the
biggest upset since Max Schmeling
knocked out Joe Louis in their first
fight in 1936.
FIGHT WORLD UPSET
It was an ultra-important upset,
for only last week both Tandberg
and Baksi had signed contracts
which guaranteed the winner a title
shot with Louis at New York on
Sept. 19.
Tandberg added fuel to the dis
pute by declaring later that "I didn't
believe I had won the fight."
"I thought I was too much on the
defensive in the closing rounds," he
said. "I'm willing to fight Louis,
however."
Burston suggested that Tandberg
and Baksi fight a return match in
New York.

CHICAGO, July 6 (UP). —
Heavyweight champion Joe Louis
was nonplussed and noncommittal
today when he learned of Joe
Baksi's upset defeat hy Swedish
heavyweight champion Olle Tand
berg.
"Wasn't that a surprise?" he
said.
"I don't know anything about
Tandberg," he went on. "but he
must be a pretty good boxer."

dish sports history—gave Tandberg
a huge ovation after his victory over
Baksi, who had entered the ring fa
vored at 3-1 to knock out Olle with
in seven rounds. They witnessed the
biggest upset since Max Schmeling
knocked out Joe Louis in their first
fight in 1936.
FIGHT WORLD UPSET
It was an ultra-important upset,
for only last week both Tandberg
and Baksi had signed contracts
which guaranteed the winner a title
shot with Louis at New York on
Sept. 19.
Tandberg added fuel to the dis
pute by declaring later that "I didn't
believe I had won the fight."
"I thought I was too much on the
defensive in the closing rounds," he
said. "I'm willing to fight Louis,
however."
Burston suggested that Tandberg
and Baksi fight a return match in
New York.

Tandberg of Sweden scored the big- j
gest upset in the heavyweight divi- j
slon in 11 years tonight when he j
defeated Joe Bnksi, America's top
contender, but there was so much i
controversy over the decision that j
the Swede may not get his promised
championship bout with Joe Louis.
After the 10-round fight before j
30,000 fans at the Rasunda soccer j
grounds, Lew Burston, representa
tive of IVJike Jacobs' 20th Century
Club, said his organization would
have to await American press reac
tion before deciding whether Tand
berg should be matched with cham
pion Louis at New York on Sept. 19.
