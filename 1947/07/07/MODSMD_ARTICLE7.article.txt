# Priest Finds 'Disc'—Maybe
## 
### 
CHICAGO, July G (UP). —The
Rev. Joseph Brasky of St. Joseph's
Church at Grafton, 45 miles north
of Milwaukee, said he heard a
swishing and whirring noise this
morning. A second later, he said,
he heard a thud and a mild explo
sion.
He investigated and found a sheet
metal disc about 18 inches in diam
eter, resembling a circular saw
blade.
"The object still was warm,
weighed about four or five pounds
and was about one-eighth of an inch
thick," he said.
'GADGETS AND WIRES'
There was a hole about one inch
in diameter in the middle of the
disc, he said, and in the opening
were "gadgets and some wires."
The priest said he did not know
if his discovery were important, or
whether it might be an elaborate
practical joke. He said he had noti
fied the FBI of his find. H. K. John
son of the Milwaukee FBI office
said he hadn't heard yet about the
disc but that an official report might
be at his office.
SEEN IN 30 STATES
The flying discs have been re
ported "seen" by persons in 30
states, but Brasky's report was the
first that one actually had been
found—if that is what was found.
His report came a few hours after
a military plane made an unsuc
cessful speed dash in an attempt to
track down one of the discs and the
Army and scientists sought to as
certain whether coast-to-coast re
ports about the discs zooming
through the sky were fact or fancy.
