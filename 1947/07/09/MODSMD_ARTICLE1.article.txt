To date, said Wunderlich, 850 old residents and 500 new
students have applied for housing. Applications are being re
ceived every day.
Village officials have prepared a form letter in order to

determine present needs of appli
cants for apartments. All 300 apart
ments are occupied, and there is a

system under which eligibility of
applicants is determined. The sys
tem gives priority to those families
with children. Points are awarded
on the basis of 10 points for the
first child and five points for each
subsequent child. All eligible vet
erans are awarded one point for
each month on the list, and expec
tant couples are given one-half
point for each month of expectancy.
As vacancies occur, apartments
are assigned to those with the high
est total of points.
Twenty-seven vacancies were cre
ated by graduation at the end of
spring quarter. The number of va
cancies for summer quarter is not
known, but it will probably be
small.
Wunderlich emphasized that ap
plicants for apartments should keep
his office advised of any changes of
address, so that they can be reached
easily at all times.
