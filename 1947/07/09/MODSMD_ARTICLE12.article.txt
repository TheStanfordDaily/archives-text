# Governor Signs Measure To Check Crime Increase
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, July 8 (UP).â€”Governor Warren said tonight
he has signed a bill authorizing him to appoint special crime
study commissions to assist the State Board of Corrections in
combatting an increase in crime in California.
At the same time Warren said he intended to pocket-veto a

bill exempting roofs and tops of tents
from present fireproofing require
ments. He said he would veto the
bill because recent fires showed
"there should be no relaxing what
ever in the laws for the protection
of the lives of our citizens."
CRIME SURVEY
In signing the crime commission
bill, authored by Sen. Charles Deuel,
D., Chico, Warren said it would
afford "the first opportunity in many
years to conduct an accurate survey
of crime conditions in our state."
He said he planned to appoint
commissions to study five separate
phases of crime in California. They
would be organized crime; juvenile
delinquency and crime prevention;
institutional care, probation and
parole; criminal law and procedure;
and social conditions contributing to
crime.
INCREASED TAX FUND
Warren also signed a bill giving
cities and counties in California an
additional 20 percent of the so-called
motor vehicle "in lieu" tax fund. <
The measure is expected to give
the cities and counties approximately
$4,000,000 a year that previously had
gone into the state general fund.
The governor said tonight that he
will discuss the organization of local
rent control boards in California to
morrow morning with representa
tives of city and county governments
and 22 statewide organizations.
Warren said he had called the
conference after receiving a request
from Frank R. Creedon, national
housing expediter, that he recom
mend not less than five members
for each of the 23 rental areas in
the state.
