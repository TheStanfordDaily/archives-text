# Income Tax Cut Approved
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UP).—
Defying prospects of another presi
dential veto, the House today gave
( top-heavy bi-partisan approval to
j the revised Republican plan to cut
personal income taxes by $4,000,-
' 000,000 a year starting Jan. 1.
The Senate is ready to follow suit,
j perhaps before the weekend, thus
j putting ' the politics - packed issue
j once more up to President Truman.
HOUSE HOARS APPROVAL
The House roared its approval by
I a vot? of 302 to 112, which was 26
j votes more than the two-thirds that
j would be needed to override a veto,
j The original bill was passed by a
vote of 273 to 137.
Before shouting its approval of
the new measure, the House beat
down by a vote of 261 to 151 a Dem
ocratic attempt to send it back to
the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee with instructions to re
draft it along lines reportedly fa
vored by the White House.
RECOMMITTAL MOTION
The recommittal motion was
I sponsored by Rep. Aime J. Forand,
I D., R.I. With the backing of many
I administration supporters, he pro
! posed to force the committee to
! scrap the GOP plan in favor of in
i creasing personal exemptions from
! $500 to $600 and reducing taxes in
j each income bracket by three per
! centage points.
The House decision to sustain the
first veto spared the Senate from
facing th» veto issue last month. If
it must face it now, the result will
be in doubt. Sen. Harry F. Byrd,
D., Va., has predicted that (51 Sena
tors would vote to override a veto
now. But if all 95 Senators took
part in the test, it would require 04
to override.
Most Democrats are convinced —
and some Republicans agree pri
vately that they are probably right
! —that a second veto is inevitable.
