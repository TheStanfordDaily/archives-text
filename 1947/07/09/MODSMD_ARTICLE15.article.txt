# AAF Announces Recovery of Disc In New Mexico
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UP).—
Tlie mystery of the "flying saucers"
took a new twist tonigM with the
disclosure that the Army Air Forces
has recovered a strange object in
New Mexico and is forwarding it to
Wright Field, Dayton, 0., for ex
amination.
Announcement of the find came
first from the Roswell, N.M., Army
Air Base, near where a "saucer"
was found three weeks ago.
AAF headquarters later revealed
that a "security lid" has been
clamped on all but the sketchiest
details of the discovery.
AAF spokesmen would say only
that the "saucer" was a flimsily
constructed, kite-like object meas
uring about 25 feet in diameter and
covered with a material resembling
tinfoil.
A telephonic report from Brig.
Gen. Roger B. Ramey, commander
of the Eighth Air Force at Fort
Worth, T(jx„ said the purported
"saucer" was badly battered when
discovered by a rancher at Corona,
75 miles northwest of Roswell, N.M.
Ramey scoffed at the possibility
that the object could have been
piloted or that it could have attained
the supersonic speeds credited to
the "flying saucers" allegedly spot
ted in recent weeks.
He reported that the object was
too lightly constructed to have car
ried anyone and that there was no
evidence that it had had a power
plant of any sort.
PLANES GO UP
The Oregon National Guard sent
up two P-51 Mustangs today to
search for objects in the sky re
ported by several Portland residents
starting at 2:10 p.m.
At least 11 persons reported they
saw "flying discs" at various times
over the city between 2:10 and 3:24
p.m.
U.S. ACCUSED
Orville Wright, who invented the
airplane, said today that the flying
saucer craze was a government
campaign to get us into another
war.
Wright criticized the wide pub
licity given the saucer stories, and
said there is no scientific basis for
the existence of the phenomenon
supposedly seen by hundreds.
BELGIAN SAW DISCS
A Belgian war bride reported in
Denver that she had seen the discs
in her native land before coming to
the U.S. a year ago.
At first the discs were laughed off
as a hoax or a psychological illu
sion but subsequently the Army and
the Navy began taking serious in
terest in the wave of reports.
