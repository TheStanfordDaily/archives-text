told the Tuesday Evening Series au
dience last night that the late Jus
tice Louis Brandeis was "a con
servative in the best sense of that
misused word."
Dr. Mason spoke in Memorial

Radical or Conservative."
"The Justice always catalogued
himself as a democrat with a little
"d" and his record bears him out,"
Dr. Mason said.
Brandeis was Holmes' man of sta
tistics and master of economics. His
statesmanship was constructive, and
it must be measured in terms of
stands taken and things done, he
said.
Brandeis repeatedly said. '"The
greatest peril to freedom is an inert
people."
