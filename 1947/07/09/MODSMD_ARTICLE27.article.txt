FIRST TO BE RECOGNIZED
The Pacific Northwestern College
Congress was the first organization

of the United Nations as being rep
resentative of student opinion.
"We believe it is one of the most
effective answers yet proposed to
the puzzling questionâ€”'What can a
university student do to exert his.
influence for world peace?'" Hall
declared.
Delegates from 40 major colleges
and universities in California, Ari
zona, Nevada, Utah, and Hawaii will
attend the three-day sessions of the
congress. The date for the congress
has not been set.
STUDENT DELEGATES
Two students will be appointed to
take the resolutions passed at the

congress to the American delegation
to the United Nations in New York.
Speakers of national repute, such
as Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt who
spoke at the Pacific Northwest Col
lege Congress, will add to the gen
eral assemblies, panels, and public
meetings held in connection with
the congress, Hall added.
Following the Stanford meeting,
delegates will publicize the results
of the congress to their own stu
dent bodies and secure a referen
dum on the various resolutions. The
executive committee of the congress
will prepare an overall report for
distribution to the public, officials
of the State Department, and mem
bers of Congress.
