## Wind on Capitol Hill 
### 
Someone once said that God moves in mysterious ways.
He might have extended that comment to the doings of the
United States Congress. We common citizens are often puz
zled by the wind that blows on Capitol Hill, where congress
men say one thing and do another. The latest act to fall in this
unrational category is the House's unanimous passage of the
bill to permit ex-servicemen to cash their terminal leave bonds.
These congressmen who would release $2,500,000,000 into
an already overburdened national economy are the same men
who so piously deplore (for the Congressional Record and for
voters at home) the inflationary actions of our government.
Perhaps the answer to this perplexing problem is that in
1948 one-third of the Senate and all of the House comes up for
re-election. What could be a better campaign statement to an
inflation-starved GI and his family than "I got you that extra
money now when you needed it"? What the congressmen
won't say is that that same GI will need the terminal leave
money even more desperately five years from now and that
releasing the money now actually lowers his standard of living
by helping inflation rather than raises it.
Unfortunately, one of the defects of our system of govern
ment is that so many guestions of national interest are tied
up in political maneuvers. Politicians are only human beings
and it may be too much to expect them to put national interest
above self-interest. But wouldn't it be refreshing to have a few
who are consistent, who talk the same way they act?
