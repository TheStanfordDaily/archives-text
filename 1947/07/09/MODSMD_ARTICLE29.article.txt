I myself saw the Mobilgas flying horse a couple of weeks ago and
almost went out of my mind, but these flying disks are something
new. If they are some advertising stunt, I'd like to know what they
are selling so subtly. I don't think a wealthy Martian has a hole in his

pocket, although we really don't know too much
about their coinage system out there.
Anyway, the most elegant description of this latest
American Dream came from some women who said
the disks looked like a string of pearls. That's a litle
too fancy for me. I've heard of pic in the sky, and
I've looked for gold on the rainbow, pennies from
heaven, and The Silver Lining, but nobody is going
to start me on a pearl hunt. No diving into space for
this boy.
Like Auden, I'm wondering what
"Influence occupation
Has on human vision
Of the human fate . .

Did that priest, for instance, think the disk resembled a collection
plate? Was our elegant mother of pearls a jeweler? Would Billy Rose
see a diamond horseshoe, and Aunt Jemima a pancake? Does the track
man see a discus; the chain-smoker, an ash-tray? Does Gump see
Spode? Painless Parker see dental plates, Gordy see license plates,
Astaire see heel plates? And FP.A.—poker chips? Mary Murlin—
soap chips?
I bet they look like dog tags to Mac Arthur, and dog biscuits to Lassie.
And with, undoubtedly, Petrillo's phonograph records, Yvonne deCarlo's
tambourine, Necco's wafers, Walker Vaughan's revolving stages, Lucius
Beebe's finger bowl, and Jose Iturbi's Hollywood Bowl, Oscar Levant's
aspirin tablets, the ring that Dewey kicked his hat into, Maugham's
circle, and Winchell's dots—with all of that, the variety of hallucinations
would become too much to bear.
My own opinion is that the only rings are on our fingers, the only
plates are in our cupboards, the only pearls are in our oysters, the only
disks are down at Hague's, and the only circles are under our eyes.
There are enough disk jockeys on the radio, so I say keep them the hell
away from the newspapers.
And the next time that high-octane Pegasus goes riding by in the
night, I'm going to get out my sixteen-inch gun and knock it in the
rear tank.
