# Dickens Film Is Triumph For British
## 
### 
The war apparently served to
stimulate the British film out of
its sad pre-war state. Many new
talents were given a chance to go
to work, and from this group of
young hopefuls came the men who
made "Great Expectations"—and a
round of cheers is certainly in or
der for them.
The film version preserves much
of the quaint, old-fashioned at
mosphere of the Dickens novel,
but the important thing is that the
familiar Dickens characters have
stepped out of the musty pages of
the novel and onto the screen with
a fresh touch of life.
Director David Lean concen
trates on visual effect and inter
prets the thought and content of
"Great Expectations" through the
finely .drawn portraits of the prin
cipal characters. Again using his
keen sense of movement, Lean re
lies heavily on camera work in
this picture, and is even more suc
cessful than he was in ''Brief En
counter."
The cast was obviously very
carefully chosen and is flawless
without exception. Among the
outstanding players are Anthony
Wager and John Mills, who play
Pip. the central character, as a boy
and as a young man. Accustomed
as we are to precocious infants
from Hollywood and their "cute"
mouthings, young Wager comes as
a welcome change.
Limited as the work of Charles
Dickens is for translation to the
screen, "Great Expectations" has
come alive with a new splendor
and meaning. This only goes to
prove that nothing is too old-fash
ioned or out of date for the screen
if it is essentially real and human.
"Great Expectations" is proof of
what a little intelligence and cre
ative originality can do.—Keenan
