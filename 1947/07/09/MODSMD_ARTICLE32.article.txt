# There've Been Changes On the King's Highway
## 
### 
El Camino Real is undergoing a
change from a highway to a city
street, say district highway au
thorities, and the State Division of
Highways is planning a controlled
traffic flow for the 50-mile stretch
between San Francisco and San
Jose.
In November of 1945. according
to "California Highways and Pub
lic Works," a speed zone survey
was instituted, maps and speed
checks made, and enforcement of
ficers interviewed. From survey
results, it was determined to es
tablish El Camino as a safe route
for recreational drivers, Peninsula
shoppers, and local traffic, leaving
the Bayshore for those drivers,
particularly commuters, whose in
terest is to reach their destination
as rapidly as possible.
The solution agreed on was to
establish a uniform series of 35
m.p.h. zones from Menlo Park to

Burlingame. This was intended to
provide the public with a route
that could be used with a feeling
of security, yet without the unrea
sonable slow-down areas repre
sented by local 20 and 25 m.p.h.
zones.
Results of the new policy after
several months' trial were as
planned, according to local traffic
officials. Speeding was reduced,
enforcement was easier, "Sunday
drivers" and other slower-moving
traffic were using El Camino in
preference to Bayshore, and faster
traffic had been forced over to the
other highway.
Future plans, the official maga
zine said, involve a progressive
traffic signal system in operation
from South San Francisco to San
Jose based on a regulated speed
approximating the 35 m.p.h. now
applied in the Menlo Park-Bur
lingame zone. —Dave Martin
