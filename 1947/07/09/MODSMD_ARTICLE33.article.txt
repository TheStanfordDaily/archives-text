What is Democracy? We bandy
that word around day after day.
It means something to us. But
what? Nearly everyone who tries
to define it comes up with a dif
ferent idea. From that stems an
inevitable result: the word "De
mocracy" comes in for an as
tounding amount of misuse.
Webster says it is "government
by the people; government in
which the supreme power is re
tained by the people and exercised
either directly (absolute or pure
Democracy), or indirectly (repre
sentative Democracy) through a
system of representation."
That's a step toward clarifica
tion, but it's not enough. The Uni-

ted States is a
Democracy, but
Russia claims it,
too, is a govern
ment by the peo
ple — that the
people are sol
idly behind the
state. Obviously
the systems now
in effect in these
countries are to-

tally dissimilar. It's easy merely
to laugh off the Russian claims and
hold our own country up as the
true democratic state, but that's
not a very smart thing to do unless
we are very sure of our ground.
So let's dig a little deeper. De
mocracy stands for majority rule.
The true Democracy would have
a suffrage embracing every per
son in the state; ideally the people
would be the legislative body,
working directly, but when there
are millions of people that is not
possible; therefore they choose
representatives.
In the United States there are
many people who are not allowed
to vote; the major group in this
category is, of course, that of the
Southern Negro. That indicates

that Democracy in this country is
not perfect. In Russia the govern
ment wants its people to vote so
badly that it herds them to the
polls by force (whether or not the
elections are honest or free is an
other matter). Thus we see that
they have some basis to their
claim that they are democratic.
The ancient republics, particu
larly Athens, had a "pure" democ
racy; that is, all the citizens had
the franchise and governed di
rectly. Of course only 10 per cent
of the people were citizens, but it
was pure Democracy in so far as
they were affected. Rule was by
majority — and that majority did
what it pleased. There were no
laws protecting civil liberties —
freedom of religion, speech, and
what have you; that is a much
later accretion. If the majority had
so desired, it could have massacred
the entire minority — and there
would have been nothing undemo
cratic about it, because that would
have been the desire of the great
est number.
The majority can't do things like
that in the United States, at least
not without breaking a few laws.
Judging from all the executions
and imprisonments that the Rus
sians have ordered, it would ap
pear that they arc more demo
cratic than we — always granting
that the majority of the Russian
people are behind the Kremlin.
To an American, majority rule
is important, and universal suf
frage is important—but no more
so than the safeguards set up in
the Bill of Rights, the 13th, 14th,
and 15th Amendments, and in the
body of the Constitution itself. But
these things aren't a part of De
mocracy at all; they come from
somewhere else.
Protection of civil liberties stems
from the Liberal movement —
which in effect is the protection

of the minority from the majority.
Many of its ideals had been kicked
around for centuries, but Liberal
ism gained strength only after the
Industrial Revolution began. Its
ideals are part of the American
political system. We have major
ity rule and a fairly extensive suf
frage, yes—but we also protect the
minority from the majority. Thus
it appears that we are a fusion of
Democracy and Liberalism—a Lib
eral-Democracy.
Russia has no truck with Liber
alism; therefore (if her people are
behind her government) she is
closer to being a Democracy than
is the United States; much closer.
Personally I don't believe that the
Stalinists could win an honest
election if all opponents were al
lowed to campaign without inter
ference for a protracted period—
Russia is in effect a regime of the
minority. I believe such a circum
stance is inevitable in any real De
mocracy, that mob leaders will
muscle their way to the fore; and
thus I believe that Democracy as
such is unworkable—that a Lib
eral-Democracy is as close to the
real thing as a state dares get.
I believe that the United States,
a Liberal - Democracy, has estab
lished the best system of govern
ment yet devised. As yet it is
probably no more than 50 per cent
perfect, but it is still preferable
to the others. Russia, be it demo
cratic or oligarchic, has very near
ly the worst. But remember—the
next time you are confused by
Russian references to Democracy,
bear in mind that what they are
talking about is much closer to
true Democracy than the so-called
"American Way"—whether they're
applying it at home or not.
If you do that you'll have a
greater understanding: you'll be
able to follow Moscow's specious
reasoning much better.

that word around day after day.
It means something to us. But
what? Nearly everyone who tries
to define it comes up with a dif
ferent idea. From that stems an
inevitable result: the word "De
mocracy" comes in for an as
tounding amount of misuse.
Webster says it is "government
by the people; government in
which the supreme power is re
tained by the people and exercised
either directly (absolute or pure
Democracy), or indirectly (repre
sentative Democracy) through a
system of representation."
That's a step toward clarifica
tion, but it's not enough. The Uni-

ted States is a
Democracy, but
Russia claims it,
too, is a govern
ment by the peo
ple — that the
people are sol
idly behind the
state. Obviously
the systems now
in effect in these
countries are to-

tally dissimilar. It's easy merely
to laugh off the Russian claims and
hold our own country up as the
true democratic state, but that's
not a very smart thing to do unless
we are very sure of our ground.
So let's dig a little deeper. De
mocracy stands for majority rule.
The true Democracy would have
a suffrage embracing every per
son in the state; ideally the people
would be the legislative body,
working directly, but when there
are millions of people that is not
possible; therefore they choose
representatives.
In the United States there are
many people who are not allowed
to vote; the major group in this
category is, of course, that of the
Southern Negro. That indicates

that Democracy in this country is
not perfect. In Russia the govern
ment wants its people to vote so
badly that it herds them to the
polls by force (whether or not the
elections are honest or free is an
other matter). Thus we see that
they have some basis to their
claim that they are democratic.
The ancient republics, particu
larly Athens, had a "pure" democ
racy; that is, all the citizens had
the franchise and governed di
rectly. Of course only 10 per cent
of the people were citizens, but it
was pure Democracy in so far as
they were affected. Rule was by
majority — and that majority did
what it pleased. There were no
laws protecting civil liberties —
freedom of religion, speech, and
what have you; that is a much
later accretion. If the majority had
so desired, it could have massacred
the entire minority — and there
would have been nothing undemo
cratic about it, because that would
have been the desire of the great
est number.
The majority can't do things like
that in the United States, at least
not without breaking a few laws.
Judging from all the executions
and imprisonments that the Rus
sians have ordered, it would ap
pear that they arc more demo
cratic than we — always granting
that the majority of the Russian
people are behind the Kremlin.
To an American, majority rule
is important, and universal suf
frage is important—but no more
so than the safeguards set up in
the Bill of Rights, the 13th, 14th,
and 15th Amendments, and in the
body of the Constitution itself. But
these things aren't a part of De
mocracy at all; they come from
somewhere else.
Protection of civil liberties stems
from the Liberal movement —
which in effect is the protection

of the minority from the majority.
Many of its ideals had been kicked
around for centuries, but Liberal
ism gained strength only after the
Industrial Revolution began. Its
ideals are part of the American
political system. We have major
ity rule and a fairly extensive suf
frage, yes—but we also protect the
minority from the majority. Thus
it appears that we are a fusion of
Democracy and Liberalism—a Lib
eral-Democracy.
Russia has no truck with Liber
alism; therefore (if her people are
behind her government) she is
closer to being a Democracy than
is the United States; much closer.
Personally I don't believe that the
Stalinists could win an honest
election if all opponents were al
lowed to campaign without inter
ference for a protracted period—
Russia is in effect a regime of the
minority. I believe such a circum
stance is inevitable in any real De
mocracy, that mob leaders will
muscle their way to the fore; and
thus I believe that Democracy as
such is unworkable—that a Lib
eral-Democracy is as close to the
real thing as a state dares get.
I believe that the United States,
a Liberal - Democracy, has estab
lished the best system of govern
ment yet devised. As yet it is
probably no more than 50 per cent
perfect, but it is still preferable
to the others. Russia, be it demo
cratic or oligarchic, has very near
ly the worst. But remember—the
next time you are confused by
Russian references to Democracy,
bear in mind that what they are
talking about is much closer to
true Democracy than the so-called
"American Way"—whether they're
applying it at home or not.
If you do that you'll have a
greater understanding: you'll be
able to follow Moscow's specious
reasoning much better.

It means something to us. But
what? Nearly everyone who tries
to define it comes up with a dif
ferent idea. From that stems an
inevitable result: the word "De
mocracy" comes in for an as
tounding amount of misuse.
Webster says it is "government
by the people; government in
which the supreme power is re
tained by the people and exercised
either directly (absolute or pure
Democracy), or indirectly (repre
sentative Democracy) through a
system of representation."
That's a step toward clarifica
tion, but it's not enough. The Uni-

ted States is a
Democracy, but
Russia claims it,
too, is a govern
ment by the peo
ple — that the
people are sol
idly behind the
state. Obviously
the systems now
in effect in these
countries are to-

tally dissimilar. It's easy merely
to laugh off the Russian claims and
hold our own country up as the
true democratic state, but that's
not a very smart thing to do unless
we are very sure of our ground.
So let's dig a little deeper. De
mocracy stands for majority rule.
The true Democracy would have
a suffrage embracing every per
son in the state; ideally the people
would be the legislative body,
working directly, but when there
are millions of people that is not
possible; therefore they choose
representatives.
In the United States there are
many people who are not allowed
to vote; the major group in this
category is, of course, that of the
Southern Negro. That indicates

that Democracy in this country is
not perfect. In Russia the govern
ment wants its people to vote so
badly that it herds them to the
polls by force (whether or not the
elections are honest or free is an
other matter). Thus we see that
they have some basis to their
claim that they are democratic.
The ancient republics, particu
larly Athens, had a "pure" democ
racy; that is, all the citizens had
the franchise and governed di
rectly. Of course only 10 per cent
of the people were citizens, but it
was pure Democracy in so far as
they were affected. Rule was by
majority — and that majority did
what it pleased. There were no
laws protecting civil liberties —
freedom of religion, speech, and
what have you; that is a much
later accretion. If the majority had
so desired, it could have massacred
the entire minority — and there
would have been nothing undemo
cratic about it, because that would
have been the desire of the great
est number.
The majority can't do things like
that in the United States, at least
not without breaking a few laws.
Judging from all the executions
and imprisonments that the Rus
sians have ordered, it would ap
pear that they arc more demo
cratic than we — always granting
that the majority of the Russian
people are behind the Kremlin.
To an American, majority rule
is important, and universal suf
frage is important—but no more
so than the safeguards set up in
the Bill of Rights, the 13th, 14th,
and 15th Amendments, and in the
body of the Constitution itself. But
these things aren't a part of De
mocracy at all; they come from
somewhere else.
Protection of civil liberties stems
from the Liberal movement —
which in effect is the protection

of the minority from the majority.
Many of its ideals had been kicked
around for centuries, but Liberal
ism gained strength only after the
Industrial Revolution began. Its
ideals are part of the American
political system. We have major
ity rule and a fairly extensive suf
frage, yes—but we also protect the
minority from the majority. Thus
it appears that we are a fusion of
Democracy and Liberalism—a Lib
eral-Democracy.
Russia has no truck with Liber
alism; therefore (if her people are
behind her government) she is
closer to being a Democracy than
is the United States; much closer.
Personally I don't believe that the
Stalinists could win an honest
election if all opponents were al
lowed to campaign without inter
ference for a protracted period—
Russia is in effect a regime of the
minority. I believe such a circum
stance is inevitable in any real De
mocracy, that mob leaders will
muscle their way to the fore; and
thus I believe that Democracy as
such is unworkable—that a Lib
eral-Democracy is as close to the
real thing as a state dares get.
I believe that the United States,
a Liberal - Democracy, has estab
lished the best system of govern
ment yet devised. As yet it is
probably no more than 50 per cent
perfect, but it is still preferable
to the others. Russia, be it demo
cratic or oligarchic, has very near
ly the worst. But remember—the
next time you are confused by
Russian references to Democracy,
bear in mind that what they are
talking about is much closer to
true Democracy than the so-called
"American Way"—whether they're
applying it at home or not.
If you do that you'll have a
greater understanding: you'll be
able to follow Moscow's specious
reasoning much better.
