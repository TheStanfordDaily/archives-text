# Farm Players Turn Carpenter In Preparation for 'High Tor'
## 
### 
The Stanford Players recently left the green room to try their
hands at set construction in preparation for the production of
Maxwell Anderson's fantasy "High Tor," slated for July 17/18,
and 18 at 8:15 p.m. in the Memorial Auditorium.
The idea behind the temporary metamorphosis was the possi-

♦ bility of the players immediately
suiting their actions to the ground
plan of the designer Willard Sehurz,
j instead of being faced with a cold
| set at the end of the rehearsal
I period. Under the new plan, they
have been working on platforms—
I which will be seen as the crags of
High Tor, a section of the palisades
j —since the first reading.
Sehurz, who is attending the Uni
versity on a technical fellowship,
will employ an additional innovation
in the depiction of the rocky setting
; by using profile cutouts in order to
| get away from the more stylized
version of palisades. By working in
I conjunction with Miss Virginia Ops
-1 vigs' class in theory of costume, he
) will be able to achieve a blending
of the background with the costume,
j Pride of the construction crew is
the steam shovel of the Traprock
Co., which must accommodate two
I men during two hours of the play.
Under threats of "we'll use cushions"
! from the players concerned, the
crew designed a 3' x 3'9" x 3' steam
shovel bucket which swings out over
! the stage. Comfortable capacity—
two actors.
