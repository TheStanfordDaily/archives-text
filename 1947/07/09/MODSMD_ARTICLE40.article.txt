## The 						Chief 
### 
In crowded quarters in Section
"TT' at Seals Stadium, we could do
nothing but listen while the Chief,
encased in an overcoat, screamed
lustily at Lefty O'Doul, Seals base
ball pilot.
"You fathead, O'Doul," the Chief
bellowed, "where'd you learn to
play baseball?"
"He's doing the best he can," we
said.
The Los Angeles Angels pushed
across two more runs in the inning
on errors by Bones Sanders and
Hugh Luby. "Poor Seals!" we
moaned.
"C'mon, O'Doul, wake up." the
Chief blasted. "You're not in Butch
ertown now."
"Maybe he ought to let Chesnes
pitch," we suggested.
The Chief was silent for a spell.
"Wise guy, eh! Know anything
about Chesnes, m'boy?"
"A little," we said.
FABULOUS ROOKIE
And we proceeded to tell the bel
ligerent Injun about Bob Chesnes,
the most - talked - about baseball
rookie in the minors today. Fabu
lous Robert, the $100,000 Beauty, al
ley urchins would whisper.
Steam and the patter of bare feet
on cold cement filled the locker
room. A few teen-agers were dress
ing hurriedly in hopes of beating
the five o'clock street car rush.
Practice was over for the day.
Genial Pop Elder, Mission High
baseball tutor, shuffled in, espied
the slight, well-knit kid in the cor
ner and gravely shook his head.
"You still here, Chesnes?"
The kid grinned lazily.
"Last one in the locker room to
day," Pop said.
"I'm in no hurry," the kid said.
"I've been watching you on the
field, Chesnes. Seems like you were
slowing down a bit."
ELDER'S ADVICE
The kid slipped on a sweater and
leaned absentmindedly against the
green locker. He pursed his lips,
then stared at the ceiling smeared
with small droplets of steam.
"Anything wrong?" Pop asked.
"No." the kid countered. "There
are some pretty good boys on the
team. Fast, too."
Old Pop, alien to the ways of
modern psychology, scratched his
head like Mr. Micawber come to
life.
"You know what's wrong with
you?" Pop asked, and then answer
ing his own question continued,
"You're lazy. You don't move
around fast enough. You haven't a
spark of energy in you. Take my
advice, Chesnes, and get some en
ergy and life in you."
DETERMINED KID
The kid moved out of the locker
room onto the street level, hands in
trouser pockets, tousled head angled
to the sidewalk. He gritted his teeth
and began to walk a little faster. At
the corner, Pop's voice hit him
broadside.
"For God's sake, Chesnes, get
some energy."
There was a passage of time
wherein the Chief was silent. All
thoughts of the Seals-Angels skir
mish were cast aside.
"That's our story," we said.
"Well, whaddya know,"the Chief
purred. "So he's lazy, eh?"
"He wasâ€”once," we told him but
fast.
THE CHIEF TREATS
"And all Chesnes does is become
a minor league baseball sensation,"
the Chief mused, chuckling in his
feathers. "C'mon," he said, "let's
leave this ice box. I'll treat you to
a stein of water."
At two ayem, the California Street
cable cars lulled us to sleep with
naught but frustration and benzed
rine. The telephone rang.
"Sorry to awaken you. m'boy,"
said a voice sounding like the Chief,
"but I'm puzzled."
"Yeah," we yawned, "what's the
trouble?"
"Say, did the Angels beat the
Seals last night?"
