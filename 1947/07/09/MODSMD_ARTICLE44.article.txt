# Cronin Lauds Shea

### 
CHICAGO, July 8 (UP). â€”There was only mild
hysteria in the American League's dressing room today
when Joe Cronin, manager of the Boston Red Sox and
the 1947 All Stars, came charging up the ramp shouting
"Atta way, gang, atta way!"
'"You guys and you pitchers," Cronin crowed. "Oh,
boy, you pitchers." He wrapped his arms around Hal
Newhouser and Walt Masterson and gave Frank Shea
a poke on the ribs.
Shea, grinning sheepishly, just shook his head over
Johnny Mize's long homer, the National League All
Stars' only run of the ball game.
