# Doerr, Boudreau, Shea Spark American League in 10th win
## 
### 
CHICAGO, July 8 (UP).â€”Fancy base run
ning by Bobby Doerr, of the Boston Red Sox,
and a timely pinch-hit single by Stan Spence, of
Washington, gave the American League a 2-1
victory over the Nationals today in the 14th
annual All-Star game.
Doerr scored the winning run in the seventh in
ning. Fast on his feet, he got a clean single to left
oft Johnny Sain, the Boston Braves righthander.
On the very next pitch to Philadelphia's Buddy
Rosar, Doerr took off as Sain raised his arm, and he
slid into second well ahead of Brooklyn catcher Bruce
Edwards' toss to teammate Peewee Reese.
DOERR SCORES WINNING RUN
That was just the start of his shenanigans. Doerr
took a nice lead ofl second and let Sain throw another
ball to Rosar. Then he took another good lead and
watched Johnny throw the ball far to the right of
second base and into center field.
Doerr romped to third and, as it turned out, that
was the ball game. Rosar struck out, but Stan Spence,
a Washington slugger, came in to hit for Yankee Frank
Shea and he pasted a single into right field to send
Bobby home easily.
NATIONAL CIRCUIT RALLY FAILS
After that manager Eddie Dyer's team managed to
get Reese of Brooklyn on base with a walk in the
ninth, but he died there and so did the National League
hopes of winning a fifth victory in the classic.
A crowd of 41,123 jammed Wrigley field, home of
the Chicago Cubs, for the contest. Net receipts were
$105,314.90. Both the crowd and the receipts were
smaller than anticipated but that didn't detract from
the contest.
Ewell Blackwell, ace righthander for the Cincinnati
Reds, and Hal Newhouser, Detroit's star southpaw
started the contest and both pitched beautiful ball.
Blackwell gave up only one hit in his three-inning
stint, a clean single by Joe Di Maggio of the Yankees
in the second, while Newhouser also was tagged for
one hit, a pinch hit single by Bert Haas of Cincinnati
in the third.
MIZE CLOUTS SIZEABLE HOMER
Then the Nats got their only run of the game in
the fourth. It was a home run by Big Johnny Mize,
a long time star of the circuit, now playing with the
Giants. He plastered a pitch by Shea, a Yankee star,
into the sixth row of the rightfield bleachers.
The Nats held that edge for two innings, but then
Luke Appling, the aging Chicago White Sox shortstop,
took over. He went in to hit for Buddy Lewis of Wash
ington and banged a ground single between Whitey
Kurowski of the Cards and Reese into left field. Ted
Williams, the Red Sox star, then got his second hit,
a single which sent Luke to third on a hit and run
play. Joe Di Maggio was the next batter and his best
effort resulted in a double play, Reese to Eddie Stanky
to Mize, but Appling rambled home on the play.
