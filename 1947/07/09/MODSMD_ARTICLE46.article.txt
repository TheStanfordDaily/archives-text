# 200 Golfers in Tourney; Smith, Berl Top Entrants
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Operations Impossible, the saga of a coming battle on the
Farm golfing green, is premiered Friday and Saturday mornings
when the 12th annual Stanford Invitational Golf Tournament is
held. More than 200 local golfers are expected to invade the
Indian course, according to tourney chairman Lee Gurley, who

yesterday went on record to "predict-*
a record field of entrants."
Senor Curley, being an old Stan
ford man of years gone by, is still
somewhat worried about the current
whereabouts of the Stanford golf
squad which recently participated
at the golfing NCAA in Ann Arbor,
Mich.
ENTRANTS RESPOND
A general alarm was spread for
Bobby Rosburg, Tom Lambie, Jack
Schuler, Bob Cardinal, and Ernie
Kellburg. As far as Gurley is con
cerned, the presence of the afore- !
mentioned Card golfers would in
deed strengthen the tourney.
Thus far, the entrants have been
slow to respond. But guys like Tal
bert Smith, the defending champ
from Alameda; Warren Berl, two
time winner of the event; and Sandy
Tatum, ex-Injun star, have already
signified their intention of compet
ing.
Of course, the list is long and
impressive, and includes Tom Dwyerf
recent Menlo invitational winner;
Bob Roos, Bob Stevens, and Horace
Guittard.
SOME SIDE EVENTS
Several side events have been \
slated to add a bit of home-spun i
glamor to the occasion. Awards will
be given to low handicap performer ;
and medalist, and prizes will be
offered the winner of the '"hole in
one" contest on the eighth hole. \
Prior to completion of Saturday's
qualifying tour, a barbecue-dance
will be held for participants and their
friends at the Adobe Creek Lodge in
Los Altos, starting at 7:30 p.m.,
Gurley said.
Aside from the Redskin links '
squad and the area standouts, there
is a slight possibility that Jim Moli
nari, the San Francisco gendarme,
may compete, as well as newspaper
men from the metropolitan dailies.
TOURNEY EVEN-SIEPHEN
Tourney officials foresee an even-
Stephen battle for tournament hon
ors. Last year, it was the blond
Smith, of the Alameda Smiths, sub,
who annexed the title with a 54 hole
total of 211. But the addition of
Berl, former Stanford ace, is enough
to worry the East Bay putting
genius.
Communiques emanating from the
Farm clubhouse indicate that par
will be awfully tough to crack come
Friday morning. All in all, the
West's toughest links layout is
headed for divot maneuvers un
known since 1930 when the tourney
was born.
