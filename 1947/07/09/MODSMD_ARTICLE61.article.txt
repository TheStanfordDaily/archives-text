# No Housing Shortage, for Summer Anyway; Visiting Firemen Can Live in 'Hotel Roble'
## 
### STU FITCH 
Summer offers no housing short
age at Stanford, but on the contrary
places the University in the role of
landlord to Farm vacationers.
The women's Row houses, sections
of the Union Units, and Casa Ven
tura are rented every summer to
members of the Stanford Family:
visiting cousins who have found the
Farm a cool and enjoyable warm
weather resort.
There are no restrictions as to
summer teaching positions or en
rollment in academic courses. ''Ten- ;

ants" just have to express their de
sire to rent, wait their turn, and
fork over the dough.
It would appear occupancy of the
How houses offers all kinds of room
for tremendous, wet parties. But it
isn't that easy. In signing their
lease, the summer occupants give
up their before-dinner cocktails —
unless they find the drive down the
highway a good way to build up an
appetite.
Sixteen of the men's fraternity
houses are open this summer to
their members and the members of
the eight closed houses. Some are
open on a caretaker basis and house
only three or four members, while
the other dorms are occupied by
as many as 15 or 20. Three of the
houses serve as community dining
halls.
Only one of the women's houses
was reserved for the University: La
throp, which houses Education De
partment summer faculty and their
families. They eat at the Union.
Non-Row dwelling Roughs have
set up housekeeping mostly at En
cina, or parts of the Village. Single
Villagers have to eat out, while the
married men live in the comfort of
their apartment-homes.
Undergraduate women live at La
gunita, while their sister graduate
students are holding down Hilltop

House, the Oaks, and parts of the
Union and Village.
Roble has been set aside as the
conference hangout. It is run on a
hotel basis, and in the past few
weeks has housed the football clinic
and Editors' Conference. Coming
events include the Graduate School
of Business Conference and the
| Physical Therapy Workshop.
