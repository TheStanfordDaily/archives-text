LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 8 (UP).—Russia asked the United
Nations Security Council today to oust all foreign troops and mili
tary personnel from Greece and set up a special commission to
administer American aid to Greece.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko introduced a resolution

for causing Balkan border incidents,

I existing conditions in Greece.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
j introduced a resolution which also
| would condemn Greece for causing
Balkan -border incidents, and blame
"foreign interference" for existing
I conditions in Greece.
Gromyko's resolution was the So
viet answer to the UN Balkan in
vestigating commission which ac
cused Albania, Bulgaria and Yugo
slavia of interfering in Greek af
fairs and precipitating border troub
les.
Gromyko said it was "ridiculous"
to try to blame Greece's northern
neighbors. Gromyko's strong state
ment increased the possibility that
he would veto any Security Council
condemnation of the Soviet satel
lites lined up on Greece's border.
A veto at this time would be a severe
blow to the very existence of UN.
Gromyko's detailed resolution also
would require the four Balkan
countries to improve their present
touch-and-go diplomatic relations,
but the main force of the Soviet
proposal was aimed at the"Truman
Doctrine" of using American eco
nomic aid to stop the spread of
Communism.
The United States has decided to
j send $300,000,000 worth of aid to
Greece. It will be administered by
Americans, but the United States has
offered to drop the program when
ever UN is able to carry on. At the
present time, there is little indica
tion that UN will be in a position
to help Greece on an emergency
basis any time soon.
