THE SPACE
DISCOURSE OF THE DRINKERS
Your jacket's adorable, Betty Ann
One more final and then I'm through
She was out last night with a new
young man
This is Bill Maeterlinck, How do you
do?
A five-letter word meaning alley cat
Look what they're doing to the poor
Chinese
The Prince of Wales has lost his hat
Two more beers and a herring, please
Well, she hasn't got an engagement
ring
Say, that red head's pretty nifty
Let's go someplace they'll let us sing
Take a breath and count to fifty
Gracie, six . . . eight . . . nine more
ales
Gad knows I've suffered and love's the
bunk
The Prince of Hat, I mean of Wales
I think your friend's a little drunk
Who's drunk? You are. I am? Yes.
I drink because I like the taste . . .
Stand upand give Lincoln's Farewell
Address
That sandwich tastes like wallpaper
paste
