Perhaps it had to happen, but
Sen. Robert H, Taft of the Ohio
Tafts has finally said something ra-

tional. As you un
doubtedly know
(since Stanford
people are such |
avid students of
current events) J
John L. Lewis and
his coal miners
have negotiated a
new contract with,
the operators —
their first since

the Taft-Hartley act came into be
ing.
Rep. Hartley doesn't like the con
tract; in fact he thinks it's as sinful
as anything — and he is against
nothing if not sin. Evidently he
is extremely disappointed because
Lewis and the operators came to a
quick agreement on a wage hike
without a strike, bloodshed, or even
sulphurous language.
The good Congressman is just
sure that there must have been
"collusion between the operators
and the union to force small com
panies out of business," and he
could be right at that — stranger
tilings have happened. But some
how I doubt it; John L. Lewis may
be a lot of things, but he's never yet
been known to doublecross himself.
That's what he might be doing if he
forced the smaller mines to close,
because that perhaps would call for
fewer miners—which in turn would
result in fewer men paying union
dues.
At least the Honorable Mr. Hart
ley has no evidence except his own
nebulous suspicions — but he told
the House of Representatives that
the operators who signed the agree
ment may get tossed in the pokey
and slapped with $10,000 fines to
boot.
Which brings us —finally—to Sen.
Taft, the Ohio Oracle, whom I left
dangling around someplace at the
beginning of this column. When he
was told of the new contract he
said, "I don't think it's in any way
a violation of the law"—that the
basic purpose of the act was to per
mit free collective bargaining; that
under it "employers and employees
should be able to make any contract
they want to."
Whether this is a reversal of form
so great as to call for a saliva test
is a matter that only the track
stewards can decide.

Which brings us —finally—to Sen.
Taft, the Ohio Oracle, whom I left
dangling around someplace at the
beginning of this column. When he
was told of the new contract he
said, "I don't think it's in any way
a violation of the law"—that the
basic purpose of the act was to per

under it "employers and employees
should be able to make any contract
they want to."
Whether this is a reversal of form
so great as to call for a saliva test
is a matter that only the track
stewards can decide.
