# Delayed GI Checks Will Arrive Soon
## 
### 
Veterans who failed to get their
subsistence checks will receive
them by Aug. 1, Burns Young, reg
istration officer of the Guidance
Center, announced yesterday. Also,
those veterans who received partial
checks will receive the remainder
at this time, Young said.
Young emphasized that the mix
up in subsistence checks will not
recur in coming months. The mis
takes in last montli's checks were
due to the withdrawal and re-en
trance of so many veterans in one
month, he stated.
Although the Veterans Adminis
tration, both at Stanford and San
Francisco, is under great pressure
due to the 23 per cent cut in per
sonnel, every effort will be made to
send forms through, promptly and
thus speed up subsistence checks,
Young said.
Veterans who do not receive their
checks by Aug. 1 should report it to
Yountj at Building C.
