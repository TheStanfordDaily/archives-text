Loren Smith and John McPher
; rin, Dividex managers, appeared to
| request review of student manager
Jiggs McCaulley's decision that
there be no increase in Dividex ad
vertising rates. Smith offered fig
ures to demonstrate their increased
costs and explained that the pro
posed rates were justified by sound
business policy, as bringing Divi-
I dex rates in line with those of other
| campus publications.

I approved the proposal on the
; grounds that the managers' share,
50 per cent of the profits, was ex
, cessive in amount. A recommen-
I dation approving the increased rates
was approved by Excom without
dissent.
