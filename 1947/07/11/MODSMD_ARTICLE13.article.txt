## The 						Daily Regrets... 
### 
The Daily regrets that it was forced to drop down to four
pages. We hope very much that we can get back up to eight
before the end of the quarter. We realize that we can offer our
readers only half as much if we have only half the space-—but
there are certain obstacles which we can't surmount.
Probably most of you don't know that it costs almost S2OO
an issue to publish an eight-page paper. Our business staff has
met with more than a modicum of sales resistance in trying to
sell ads, so that we just don't have that kind of money. Perhaps
we could go ahead on the present basis and present a bill for
the deficit to the ASSU at the end of the quarter—but that
wouldn't be right.
Therefore all we can do is curtail our operations, at least for
a time. If we can manage to fill more advertising space in the
near future we will return to the old regime; if not —it's out of
the question.
Naturally such a change calls for a revision in our news
policies. We will become strictly a herald of campus events;
we will no longer have the United Press service. That means
no stories from the outside world. However reluctantly, we are
retiring to the Ivory Tower. But we shall continue to do our best
in this much smaller area; we will try to give you all the news
of Stanford, objectively and—we hope—interestingly written.
Our features will remain much the same except that History 1947
will appear much less frequently.
That's the way things are; we're sorry—but all we can say
is, The Daily regrets . . .
