. If anybody here ever heard of H. L.. Mencken, let's set the Baltimore
Sage right and call him the Baltimore Ass instead. There was a period
during the golden twenties when Mencken was the devil-god of every

highbrow undergraduate in the country, but not many
know who he is any more and when they do come across
his name in the public prints they can certainly see that
Mencken has become as much of a fraud and a baboon
as any Presbyterian* or Baptist boob he himself ever so
labeled. It is clear now that Mencken is just as solid a
member of the bourgeoisie as any middle-class idiot he
ever reviled, and the self-advertised pleasures of his j
old age—beer, Beethoven and cabbage—are held in com- 1
mon affection by plenty of Missouri haberdashers who?
never heard of Nietzsche or knew Theodore Dreiser.
Obviously, Mencken is hard at work to build himself
up into Tin American equivalent of Bernard Shaw,
fancying himself as a testy but lovable old grouch who

can get himself quoted in all the papers every time he spots his vest with
Pilsener and opens his yap. But Mencken had shot his wad by 1930; we
can credit him with some good literary criticism, although it reads a little
worse every year it gathers dust, and we can acknowledge that it was
Mencken probably more than any other single critic who liberated Ameri
can writers from the tyranny of Mrs. Grundy.
But it is time for Mencken to eat his cabbage in silence and let us
alone to read or ignore what he has left to the libraries. His thinking has
reached a state of feeblemindedness which would allow him to reside
safely and comfortably in any section of the Bible belt—a phrase he him
self invented for the land of Dixie, an American region he always pre-,
tended to despise—and that's where he should be properly sent to retire.
I don't know what replaced Mencken in the hearts, if not the minds,
of the college population of the thirties, but I suspect it must have been
Henry Luce and Time. Those were the days when Time was boyish, brash
and belligerent while it was posing as "curt, clear and complete," and it
had a vigor and impertinence which made the students lap it up the way
the other generation had feasted on Mencken, even though there were
those who preferred to get their politics out of The Nation and the
New Republic. But Time got too wise and outsmarted itself, became heavy
with a fat circulation and enormous advertising, and now it runs closer
to the philosophy of the Republican National Committee and the Vatican
than it does to the temper of an undergraduate.
Naturally Time tries to act younger than it is, hiding those dewlaps
under the chin and dieting away at that spread in the seat, but the signs
of middle age are unmistakable. Okay, sure, Time still sells out a large
stack of copies at the Cellar, but its heyday was in the last decade and its
decline as an influence in the student body is evident.
So what have we got now for scripture? Why, John O'Hara, Harold
Ross, James Thurber, Charles Addams and Wolcott Gibbs, of course. The
New Yorker is our passion now. And will The New Yorker last any longer
than Mencken's American Mercury or Time? Well, no, I'd say. The New
Yorker's years are numbered too. but that will take another column next
week.
