# Theory Class Creates Costumes for Fantasy
## 
### 
With experimentation as the key word, members of the cam
pus theory of costume class have been applying all their tech
nical skill to combine the qualities of "stardust, moonlight, and
people" for the costumes in Maxwell Anderson's "High Tor,"
which will be presented by the Stanford Players July 17, 18,

and 19 at 8:15 in the Memorial Ail-"*
ditorium.
Under the direction of Virginia ,
Opsvig, acting instructor in speech
and drama, experiments have been
conducted with dyes and surface ;
coverings to give the ghostly ap- i
pearance of century - old clothing
still being worn in the present-day I
setting of Anderson's fantasy.
Since the dream-world Dutchmen
will be seen as wandering around
for 300 years waiting for their ship
to return, it will be necessary to
blend grey to indicate age with a
sparkling effect to indicate an ethe
real quality. Everything sparkling
from glass balls to artificial snow
has been tried, but the final mate
rial will probably not be discovered •
until the dress rehearsals, Miss Ops
vig explained.
The actual costuming is being
carried on in close connection with i
the lighting and staging crews, as
much of the play's effect will de
pend on the contrasting of modern
and 17th-century atmospheres.
