# Sox Stunned, But No Wonder!
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
One afternoon in the early
springtime of the not too distant
past, the Chicago White Sox of the
American League played an exhi
bition game against a pickup team
of young, up-and-coming ball play
ers of the fair city of Pasadena
where the White Sox yearly go
through their pre-season maneu
vers.
Victory marred
The Chisox had little difficulty in
subduing the upstarts, but their vic
tory was somewhat marred by the
amazing exhibition demonstrated by
the speedy, well - built shortstop
wearing the local livery. The tal
ented youngster put on as fine an
example of baserunning as many of
the White Sox had seen in all their
experiences in the Big Circuit.
In one trip to the plate, he beat
out a bunt, stole second, advanced
to third on a fielder's choice, and
then heaped the height of humility
on the "Big - Timers" by stealing
home! Yes, that's right, stealing
home—against the White Sox, a big
league ball club!
As the fans left the ball park, one
gentleman echoed the sentiments of
the whole gathering when he re
marked, "Too bad that kid short
stop is colored; he's major league
material if I ever saw it."
FANS RIGHT
Well, those fans were dead right
in their evaluation of the young in
fielder, for with the aid of Branch
Rickey's far-sightedness, Jack Roo
sevelt Robinson is today the regular
first baseman of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, the first Negro to make the
grade in the major leagues.
Although he hits a longer ball
and has moved over to the initial
sack from the short field, Robinson's
greatness still lies in his ability on
the basepaths. A slow roller or a
high bounder which would normal
ly mean an easy out, requires an
added effort by the opponents' in
fielder to catch the ebony flash from
taking first. Once on the initial
sack, a pitcher's misery really starts.
Allow him the usual leadoff and he's
down to second before you can say
his namesake.
OTHER SPORTS
Robinson has now achieved his
greatest fame in the national pas
time, but followers of collegiate ath
letics are more than familiar with
his phenomenal performances in
other sports. While attending Pasa
dena Junior College before his en
trance at UCLA, where he drove
Stanford as well as the other PCC
schools dizzy with his antics in foot
ball, basketball and baseball, Rob
inson set an athletic record which
it is likely will never be duplicated
at that institution, or any other for
that matter. He was without ques

lion the finest ball carrier and open
field runner in the school's history,
and sparked the Pasadena football
team of that year to the mythical
junior college championship and
what many southland experts tab
the finest junior college grid ma
chine ever assembled.
From football he moved on to
basketball where he led the confer
ence in scoring, being especially
adept at intercepting opponents'
passes for quick set-ups. He battled
Long Beach JC's Vern "Junior"
Stevens, now of the St. Louis
Browns, for top diamond laurels.
But what about track? Open the
record book and you will find the
owner of the national junior college
broad jump mark at approximately
25 ft. 5 in. to be none other than this
same Jack Robinson. "Ah me, pass
the tennis racquets please; I'll show

this Robinson how a real game is
played" may well be the attitude
of a host of his "admirers," but they
had better be at the top of their
games. Few fans know that Robin
son can claim a Pasadena city net
championship to his long list of
achievements.

ball, basketball and baseball, Rob
inson set an athletic record which
it is likely will never be duplicated
at that institution, or any other for
that matter. He was without ques

lion the finest ball carrier and open
field runner in the school's history,
and sparked the Pasadena football
team of that year to the mythical
junior college championship and
what many southland experts tab
the finest junior college grid ma
chine ever assembled.
From football he moved on to
basketball where he led the confer
ence in scoring, being especially
adept at intercepting opponents'
passes for quick set-ups. He battled
Long Beach JC's Vern "Junior"
Stevens, now of the St. Louis
Browns, for top diamond laurels.
But what about track? Open the
record book and you will find the
owner of the national junior college
broad jump mark at approximately
25 ft. 5 in. to be none other than this
same Jack Robinson. "Ah me, pass
the tennis racquets please; I'll show

this Robinson how a real game is
played" may well be the attitude
of a host of his "admirers," but they
had better be at the top of their
games. Few fans know that Robin
son can claim a Pasadena city net
championship to his long list of
achievements.
One afternoon in the early
springtime of the not too distant
past, the Chicago White Sox of the
American League played an exhi
bition game against a pickup team
of young, up-and-coming ball play
ers of the fair city of Pasadena
where the White Sox yearly go
through their pre-season maneu
vers.
Victory marred
The Chisox had little difficulty in
subduing the upstarts, but their vic
tory was somewhat marred by the
amazing exhibition demonstrated by
the speedy, well - built shortstop
wearing the local livery. The tal
ented youngster put on as fine an
example of baserunning as many of
the White Sox had seen in all their
experiences in the Big Circuit.
In one trip to the plate, he beat
out a bunt, stole second, advanced
to third on a fielder's choice, and
then heaped the height of humility
on the "Big - Timers" by stealing
home! Yes, that's right, stealing
home—against the White Sox, a big
league ball club!
As the fans left the ball park, one
gentleman echoed the sentiments of
the whole gathering when he re
marked, "Too bad that kid short
stop is colored; he's major league
material if I ever saw it."
FANS RIGHT
Well, those fans were dead right
in their evaluation of the young in
fielder, for with the aid of Branch
Rickey's far-sightedness, Jack Roo
sevelt Robinson is today the regular
first baseman of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, the first Negro to make the
grade in the major leagues.
Although he hits a longer ball
and has moved over to the initial
sack from the short field, Robinson's
greatness still lies in his ability on
the basepaths. A slow roller or a
high bounder which would normal
ly mean an easy out, requires an
added effort by the opponents' in
fielder to catch the ebony flash from
taking first. Once on the initial
sack, a pitcher's misery really starts.
Allow him the usual leadoff and he's
down to second before you can say
his namesake.
OTHER SPORTS
Robinson has now achieved his
greatest fame in the national pas
time, but followers of collegiate ath
letics are more than familiar with
his phenomenal performances in
other sports. While attending Pasa
dena Junior College before his en
trance at UCLA, where he drove
Stanford as well as the other PCC
schools dizzy with his antics in foot
ball, basketball and baseball, Rob
inson set an athletic record which
it is likely will never be duplicated
