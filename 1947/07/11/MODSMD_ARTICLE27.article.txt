## 
### DOLLY ANN LISSE 
Registration of Stanford women students for this summer now
totals 670, but there are 64 other girls now spending part of the
summer at Stanfordâ€”the Girl Scouts' little sisters. Five and a
half hours, three days a week, they are at Camp Quito, located
cn the San Francisquito Creek which borders the northeast end

of the campus.
The girls of Brownie Scout age,
J 7-10, are under the leadership of
Mrs. A. E. DeWachter, director of
the camp. They are divided into
three units according to their ages.
One group of seven-year-olds was
busily engaged in making toma
hawks and Indian headdresses for
their visitors' day program. Each
group was to give a little skit at
their campfire. and this group of
youngsters had decided to act out
an Indian story. To be realistic they
were making their own props.
GIRLS PARTICIPATE
The girls participate in many dif
ferent, activities about the camp, ac
cording to Mrs. DeWachter. These
include simple crafts like the mak
ing of ditty bags, bracelets, and
potato prints, a simplified form of
block printing. They also have folk
dancing, singing, story telling, and
cookouts.
These cookouts are one of the
things the children enjoy most, said
Mrs. DeWachter. They do most of
their cooking over buddy-burners,
an ingenius device made by placing
paraffin in a tin can around a card
board wick. The burners give of! a
surprising amount of heat and the
girls get a great deal of satisfaction
in seeing pancakes turn golden
brown in the skillet over one of
these home-made stoves.
CAMP ESTABLISHED
Mrs. DeWachter stated that the
camp was established ten years ago
by Mrs. Herbert Hoover and is now
run by the Palo Alto Girl Scout
Council which contributes a small
allowance. The main cost of opera
tion is paid for by the four-dollar
registration fee the campers pay.
Any girl from Palo Alto or vi
cinity it welcome even though she
is not affiliated with the Girl Scouts.
The first session of the camp ended
last Thursday and the new one
started this week. The campers at
tend from 9:30 to 3 on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
