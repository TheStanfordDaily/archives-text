## Old Southern 'Custom'? 
### 
An Atherton real estate dealer last week told a meeting of
the South San Mateo County Real Estate Board that any attempt
to provide low-cost housing on the Peninsula open to Negroes
and Orientals would be a threat to property values. "The only
solution of this problem is segregation," he said. "I do not think
you can mix white people with any different color," he said-
In fact, by the time he finished, he had made it clear that he
wanted the Peninsula reserved for the white race. This man's
name, if it makes any difference, is Harry Carskadon. And, if
it makes any difference, he is a Stanford man, class of '21.
In the present situation, we suppose that Mr. Carskadon's
last ditch argument would be, "would you want to live next
door to a Negro or a Chinese?" And we cannot answer his ques
tion—any more than we could if we were asked "Would you
want to live next door to a Catholic?" Obviously, it depends
on the individual.
We have no right to lump all Negroes, all Orientals, or all
Jews, or all Irishmen together and then condemn each member !
of the group solely on the basis of his membership in that group.
No one wants to live next door to anyone who will fail to
meet the minimum standards of neighbor-hood. There can be no
reasonable objection to living next door to anyone who is a good
neighbor. We ought in every case to consider the individual
involved—not condemn him untried.
This of course completely ignores the economic aspect of
Mr. C.'s argument—that property values will be depressed.
When we consider some aspects of the real-estate business, the
speculation, the jerry-building, the "unearned increment" that
it is alleged to collect, we are not convinced that the good of
that business and the good of the community are the same thing.
