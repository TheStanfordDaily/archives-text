The hard, cold-looking woman certainly is fashionable now. The most
recent issue of Life magazine makes this pretty clear. Even little Elizabeth
Taylor, at fifteen, is already showing traces of granite in the jawbone, and
when you look at that virago who had a June wedding at the Country Club
Christian Church (how about that?), you shudder to think of the children
she'll have.
Then those Oregon beauties look about ns warm and sympathetic as
pit vipers, and when you add Eva Peron (if you won't take her away),

you've got a fine collection of what earns the male's
reverence in 1047. The poets of the nineteenth century
were always talking about "soft, comforting woman"
and resting their heads on their bosoms in moments of
trial, but you wouldn't dare try that today because a
tarantula might be lurking in the cleavage.
Let's face it. The female dog has become the Goddess
of America. I'm sure that any sensible populace would
hiss and boo women like Lauren Bacall and Lizabeth
Seott right off the screen and back into their alleys, but
as it is, all either one of them has to do is wrap her
homely face around a cigarette, and the men in the
audience start sighing like bagpipes. How such crea-

tures can get such a big following outside ol' a bordello is hard to fig
ure out.
. But they really are not so objectionable as those wolfhounds in the
Vogue ads. Life's debutantes, and the Woodbury soap queens. While nearly
every actress in the movies slobbers unintelligibly in low octaves and
packs a Smith-Wesson, these magazine icicles look as if they'd poison
your martini for a chinchilla coat or a membership in the Junior League.
They smoke Marl boroughs instead of Camels and they get married in
church, but they don't look any less vicious company.
Femininity is fighting a losing battle in America, so if you happen to
like warm, feminine women, you'd better shove off to another country
before these American canines begin to run you down in trucks and
burn you with their cigars. And when the next Life comes through the
mails, I'm going to junk it and go over to Oakland for a real dog show.

As bathing suits get smaller and skirts get longer, the clothing manu
facturers are becoming engaged in an even worse conspiracy: they are
reviving the pinch-back for men. We went through the gill stage millibns
of years ago and then again back in the thirties, and it looks as if men
will be fish again. Styles are changing so fast and so insanely that I
shouldn't be surprised to find men back in short pants before the year is
out. Then we'll need shin guards to keep from getting bruised when we
trip over women's skirts.

recent issue of Life magazine makes this pretty clear. Even little Elizabeth
Taylor, at fifteen, is already showing traces of granite in the jawbone, and
when you look at that virago who had a June wedding at the Country Club
Christian Church (how about that?), you shudder to think of the children
she'll have.
Then those Oregon beauties look about ns warm and sympathetic as
pit vipers, and when you add Eva Peron (if you won't take her away),

you've got a fine collection of what earns the male's
reverence in 1047. The poets of the nineteenth century
were always talking about "soft, comforting woman"
and resting their heads on their bosoms in moments of
trial, but you wouldn't dare try that today because a
tarantula might be lurking in the cleavage.
Let's face it. The female dog has become the Goddess
of America. I'm sure that any sensible populace would
hiss and boo women like Lauren Bacall and Lizabeth
Seott right off the screen and back into their alleys, but
as it is, all either one of them has to do is wrap her
homely face around a cigarette, and the men in the
audience start sighing like bagpipes. How such crea-

tures can get such a big following outside ol' a bordello is hard to fig
ure out.
. But they really are not so objectionable as those wolfhounds in the
Vogue ads. Life's debutantes, and the Woodbury soap queens. While nearly
every actress in the movies slobbers unintelligibly in low octaves and
packs a Smith-Wesson, these magazine icicles look as if they'd poison
your martini for a chinchilla coat or a membership in the Junior League.
They smoke Marl boroughs instead of Camels and they get married in
church, but they don't look any less vicious company.
Femininity is fighting a losing battle in America, so if you happen to
like warm, feminine women, you'd better shove off to another country
before these American canines begin to run you down in trucks and
burn you with their cigars. And when the next Life comes through the
mails, I'm going to junk it and go over to Oakland for a real dog show.

As bathing suits get smaller and skirts get longer, the clothing manu
facturers are becoming engaged in an even worse conspiracy: they are
reviving the pinch-back for men. We went through the gill stage millibns
of years ago and then again back in the thirties, and it looks as if men
will be fish again. Styles are changing so fast and so insanely that I
shouldn't be surprised to find men back in short pants before the year is
out. Then we'll need shin guards to keep from getting bruised when we
trip over women's skirts.

The hard, cold-looking woman certainly is fashionable now. The most
recent issue of Life magazine makes this pretty clear. Even little Elizabeth
Taylor, at fifteen, is already showing traces of granite in the jawbone, and
