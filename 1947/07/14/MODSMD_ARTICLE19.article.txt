### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is the first in a series of three articles on Ray Lunny,
former state lightweight boxing champion who, on Sept. 1,
becomes Stanford's boxing coach.)
SAN FRANCISCO, July 13.—0n a hillside overlooking the
Mission District live the Lunny's, Ray, Carney, his wife, and little

Carney, their two-year-old daugh
ter.
We rang the doorbell and were
instantly greeted with an invitation
to help down a freshly made per
colator of coffee.
Before me sat the kid from the
Mission — hair slicked back, all
smiles, and ready to answer any
question v/e might fire at him.
"It's the break of my career,"
Ray said.
RAY SUCCEEDS FRYE
He was referring to his being ap
pointed the new boxing coach at
Stanford University succeeding the
amiable Clayton Fryc. The good
looking Mr. Lunny, an Irishman
with an appetite for Italian spa
ghetti, will certainly call a spade a
spade.
"I've always wanted to become a
boxer since I was six. And y'know,
my dad once fought at old National
Hall on Mission Street."
Baby Carney, a pretty young
ster, ran into the kitchen, whipped
out a toy six-shooter, took a pot
shot at her father, and scooted into
the living room laughing all the
while.
TURNS PRO EARLY
Ray continued: "I turned profes
sional as soon as I graduated from
Commerce High. And, saa-ay, my
wife went to the same high school.
"I used to think my greatest break
came when I fought for the world
lightweight title against Chalky
Wright. But coaching at Stanford is
something to look forward to."
Ray's wife, Carne£, who has for
gotten more about boxing than most
women learn, laughed.
"When he was training for a bout,
he was so touchy," she said. "Re
member, dear?"
The pride of the Mission grinned:

"But even before I was always
touchy and quiet. Would hardly
talk in my dressing room."
