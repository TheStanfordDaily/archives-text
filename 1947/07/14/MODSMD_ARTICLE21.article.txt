# Cellar May Close During Evenings
## 
### 
The Cellar will have to close its
doors from 8 to 10:30 p.m. Mondays
through Thursdays, said Dining
Halls Director Miss Christine Rick
er, unless more students patronize it
during the evening.
At present business volume, she
added, the Cellar is operating at a
loss, and at least double the number
of students must buy their cokes
and shakes there in order to meet
all costs. Miss Ricker pointed out.
''We do not want to close the Cel
lar because we believe so;ne type of
campus fountain service should be
open to the public," Miss Ricker
said.
