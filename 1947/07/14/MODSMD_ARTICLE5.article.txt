anything from a brand of corn

But neither guess would bo right,
and the students who constitute the
SIRO staff can tell a different story.
Student International Relief Or

Farm last winter by serious-minded
students who realized that the reha

a duty for the inhabitants of "the

the nation.

Naples for relief activities.
PRAISE BY CHAPLAIN

a fairyland sort of feeling. . . . Be
very sure that all these gifts are
j most welcome indeed, and how sor

has been searched. . , . The kindly
i interest of yourself and your friends
has made a deep and enheartening
impression upon us here, corning as
a breath of fresh air across the
ocean."
