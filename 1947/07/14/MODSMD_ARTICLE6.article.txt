(Editorial)
SIRO is perhaps the only
campus international organiza
tion that has ever accomplished
anything beyond the realm of
talk. Organized only last quar
ter, it has already shipped off
3,200 pounds of relief goods to
14 European and three Asiatic
countries. Distribution is made
on the basis of needâ€”not of
politics, religion, or nationality.
In addition, Stanford has
"adopted" the University of
Naples; this came about through
SIRO action. Textbooks and
supplies have been and are be
ing gathered for shipment.
The people in charge of run
ning the organization this sum
mer don't want to stand still;
they feel that any marking of
time is in reality retrogression.
They want to carry on this quar
ter with more of the positive ac
tion that distinguishes SIRO.
With over 3,000 students on
| campus this summer, there is
Jno reason why they canst.
These people deserve the co
operation of all of you, and The
Daily sincerely hopes that it will
be forthcoming. The Daily plans
to run a series of articles ex
plaining their principles, their
accomplishments, and their fu
ture plans. We hope that those
of you who are not already fa
miliar with SIRO will read these
articles assiduously.
