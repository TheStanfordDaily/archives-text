## The 						World in Brief 
### 
The conference meeting in Paris
to consider the Marshall Plan con
cluded its third plenary session to
day after four days of whirlwind
effort. An rep
resenting the nations in attendance
was appointed to investigate the
economic needs of Europe and all
reports are due by Sept. 1.
At the same time it was an
nounced on Capitol Hill yesterday
that as soon as a joint resolution
can pass both houses, Congress will
appoint a 19-man committee of its
own not only to investigate Europe's
needs but also to determine just
how much the U.S. will be able to
spend on the possible program.
IN EASTERN EUROPE
From Romania comes a report
saying that leaders of the "opposi
tion" party have been jailed. In
Hungary a "reliable" report says
that Parliament will be dissolved
soon by the new government in that
country.
The Greek government reports
that the 2,000 guerrilla invaders
have been stopped and turned back
to Albania. Reports are confused,
but it appears that all sides arc
rushing reinforcements.
(It is interesting to note that this
scuffle which can involve 4,000 men
at the most —even if we believe un
reliable reports—is receiving almost
as large a play in our headlines as
some past invasions which involved
millions of men.)
UN BALKAN COMMISSION
The United States' representative
in the UN, Herschel Johnson, told
that body yesterday that he con
sidered the present Balkan "crisis"
of sufficient importance to be con
sidered ahead of everything else.
Ignoring the Russian veto, he asked
that a Balkan commission be ap
pointed to investigate and report on
the present situation there.
The Reese bill, which calls for a
loyalty check of all government
employees, passed the House and is
now in the Senate. The bill calls
for the discharge of any employee
suspected of disloyalty, if there is
conclusive evidence, of course.
On the economic front two repre
sentatives of the NAM told Con
gress and committees that prices
were leveling off and America could
its greatest period of pros
perity in history. World Bank
bonds, put on sale yesterday, sold
for a high premium.
General Motors announced yes
ter that due to a steel shortage pas
senger car production will be shut
down for a week.

The conference meeting in Paris
to consider the Marshall Plan con
cluded its third plenary session to
day after four days of whirlwind
effort. An rep
resenting the nations in attendance
was appointed to investigate the
economic needs of Europe and all
reports are due by Sept. 1.
At the same time it was an
nounced on Capitol Hill yesterday
that as soon as a joint resolution
can pass both houses, Congress will
appoint a 19-man committee of its
own not only to investigate Europe's
needs but also to determine just
how much the U.S. will be able to
spend on the possible program.
IN EASTERN EUROPE
From Romania comes a report
saying that leaders of the "opposi
tion" party have been jailed. In
Hungary a "reliable" report says
that Parliament will be dissolved
soon by the new government in that
country.
The Greek government reports
that the 2,000 guerrilla invaders
have been stopped and turned back
to Albania. Reports are confused,
but it appears that all sides arc
rushing reinforcements.
(It is interesting to note that this
scuffle which can involve 4,000 men
at the most —even if we believe un
reliable reports—is receiving almost
as large a play in our headlines as
some past invasions which involved
millions of men.)

The United States' representative
in the UN, Herschel Johnson, told

Ignoring the Russian veto, he asked
that a Balkan commission be ap
pointed to investigate and report on
the present situation there.
