# SIRO Drive Starts Today
## 
### 
Today marks the opening of an
other concentrated drive by the
Stanford International Relief Or
ganization for relief goods for Eu
rope's needy, and names and ad
dresses of Stanford friends and rel
atives in foreign countries who are
in want, said Marky Cleek and Cliff
Forster, co-chairmen.
All summer residents of the Farm
are urged to contribute articles of
clothing, canned foods, and bedding
to SIRO for distribution abroad.
The articles may be placed in re
j ceptacles by the Snack Bar, and
j in the lobbies of Encina and Lagu
| nita. Those unable to make their
j contributions in the designated
spots should phone committeeman
Ed Wells, local 8624, who will ar
' range for their collection.
DRIVE CONTINUOUS
''The drive does not mean one ef
fort to be abandoned after a cer
tain time limit," explained Miss
Cleek. The SIRO program calls for
a continuous collection and dissemi
nation of articles. The drive will be
held this week so that materials can
be sorted and mailed before the end
of the quarter.
One of the prime recipients of the
articles collected during the drive
will be Stanford's "adopted" Uni
versity of Naples, said Miss Cleek.
The university was greatly damaged
during the war, and the housing
problem is especially acute.
DORMS FURNISHED
Temporary dormitories have been
set up in monasteries, she said, but
"students must bring their own
bedding, which is scarce, and pro
vide their own food, which sells at
exorbitant prices."
Besides clothing, bedding, and
supplementary food such as canned
milk or chocolate, energy and vita
min foods, SIRO needs money to
send to the agency at Naples which
provides for student medical care.
Donations may be mailed to SIRO,
Box 2488.
As a part of the drive, SIRO sub
mits the application blank found in
today's Daily. Stanford students
and faculty are urged to fill out the
form and mail it to the SIRO post
office box, or place it in boxes lo
cated at Lagunita, Encina. and the
ASSU window at the Old Union,
said Forster.
SIRO help has thus far been
praised by numerous people over
seas, especially from inhabitants in
the vicinity of Naples, Miss Cleek
said.
