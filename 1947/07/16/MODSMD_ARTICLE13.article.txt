## The 						Honor Code 
### 
Those of you who are not new at Stanford have read the fol
lowing rules many times. May they, then, serve to refresh your
memory. Students and faculty here for the first time have not
always been adequately informed just how and when the Honor
Code applies to their academic conduct.
Briefly, the Honor Code means:
1. No unpermitted aid is to be given or received for any ex
amination, paper, project, or any other assigned work.
2. All library rules shall be observed.
3. Identical material shall not be turned in for two courses
without the instructor's knowledge.
We might add a final word to those of you who have come
from schools where outright cheating or just "helpful hinting"
is the thing to do as long as you don't get caught. The Honor
Cede is taken seriously by both students and instructors. Very
few violations go undetected. The penalty is severe, ranging
all the way from failure in the course involved to a complete
expulsion.
