'lhe trouble with The New Yorker, at all odds the favorite reading of
Stanford's really smart people, is some poor kid of an English major buys
a copy and reads it thinking this is how the real stuff is written and if

only she could write like that. Then she will sit down
and turn out a story about some people so commonplace
nobody would ever want them around for a cup of coffee
and engage them in a lively topic like '"Wouldn't It Be
Too Bad if We Had Another War and Poor Jim Had to
Leave Home Again?" Payoff: Jim might be bitter next
time.
Well, if anybody sat around your living room and
got started on a conversation like that you'd turn them
out before nine o'clock, but this poor kid in the English
department thinks she is writing honest American fic
tion about real, honest American people like you meet
all the time and that's art or it wouldn't be in the New

Yorker, would it?
However, if this young Stanford writer finds that stories with dull
people and deadly conversations are a little too hard to handle, she can
always study another New Yorker specialty, the I-Remember-Uncle-Edith
reminiscence. Before poor old Bcnchley got lost in the Hollywood jungles
and was himself writing for The New Yorker, he had the number on these
My-Relatives-Wei'e-Certainly-a-Panic stories and said his Uncle Edith
was just an old bore: but Harold Ross and his factory didn't get it. I
guess, and they're still turning out a sausage of the old stuff every issue.
It's always how quaint Grandmother or how eccentric Uncle or how fool
ish Rags was when the author was just a punk who had never been pub
lished anywhere until The New Yorker was spellbound by Clarence Day,
Jr.. and never came out of it.
Criticism? Easy. Just be clever, turn a neat gag at any expense (in
cluding that of criticism), and don't work over anything too much unless
it's the movies. If it's the movies, give 'em hell because Harold Ross hates
movies. Music criticism? Biggest cinch of all. She needs these adjectives:
attractive, able, appealing, spirited, pleasant; and one adverb: rather. Mix
them up and she can bat out a music l'eview every week. But perhaps
she'd rather cartoon. Here is a simple choice of characters: the precocious
child; the middle-aged woman buying a book or a corset; the timid soul
and the fern me fatale; the frustrated housewife; the working class screw
ball; the gadget gone berserk; the Long Island matron on a spree.
The point of all this is that The New Yorker has become a formula
and has no more intellectual value for a college student than Uncle Edith's
gelatin salad. The formula is dished out every week by the same old
hands—Thurber, O'Hara, Perelman, Skinner, Benson, Kahn and Hahn—
with just an occasional outsider who has learned the recipe. The public
has learned to like it and has elbowed itself in among the older custom
ers, and now The New Yorker is riding high by giving the public what
it wants.
What the public wants, of course, is more of the same, as always. So
much of the same and so often, in fact, that as usual the embrace of the
public has been accompanied by the kiss of death and in a few years The
New Yorker will have stylized and formulized itself into its own parody.
The college patrons still crowd the racks when The New Yorker's smart
cover makes its first flash each week, but anybody who knew the maga
zine back when it was written for New York City (and the hell with any
one living in Redwood City) can tell that it's time for Eustace Tilley to
drop his lorgnette and take a good look at what's happened. The New
Yorker is still America's best weekly magazine: its fiction, criticism, re
portage and cartoons continue to be several cuts above the rest of the
slicks, more by default of the competition than by its own virtues.
But Harold Ross's kitchen is going to have to vary the diet or The
New Yorker will waste away from malnutrition into as dead a duck as
the American Mercury.
