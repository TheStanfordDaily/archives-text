## Card Stunts 
### 
Late last Sunday evening Bay
Area radio stations were spouting
news of the spectacular doings by
three Stanford climbers on Yosem
ite's treacherous Cathedral Spires.
A 1 Baxter, one of the three Farm
alpineers, had lost his footing on
the sheer perpendicular cliff* and
would have fallen to certain death
had not his two comrades checked
the drop in a remarkable manner.
The incident reminded us of some
remarks the members of the Stan
ford Alpine Club were in the habit
of making whenever they attended
meetings of the campus Ski Club
last winter quarter.
CLIMBING SAFE?
We never took them very seri
ously when they claimed that
mountain climbing was perfectly
safe, but last Sunday's incident has
made us realize that climbing with
the caliber of mountaineers that
Baxter went up with is coming as
close to safety as any man could ex
pect when he perches on a ledge
2,000 feet above the ground.
Baxter's two companions were
Larry Taylor, last year's Alpine
Club president, and Ulf Pamm-Er
ickson from Sweden, both Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity brothers and
both experienced climbers.
We can't claim to know what
happened on the cliff Sunday with
absolute certainty, but this much
we feel sure about.
Baxter, who weighs around 200
pounds and stands about 6 feet, was
undoubtedly leading the trio at
this particular spot on the face of
the cliff. He was probably just
placing a piton into the rock above
his head when he lost his footing
and started the fall.
For those of you new at this
sport, a piton is a wedge which is
driven into crevices or cracks in the
rock and which then serves as a
foothold much like the steps of a
ladder.
FACTORS IMPORTANT
Normally a 40-foot free fall is the
maximum that can be checked, but
several factors contributed to save
Baxter's life. To beqin with, his fall
was not entirely free so that A 1
broke both legs but did, on the other
hand, reduce the impact on the
safety rope.
Also the climbers used a nylon
l'ope instead of the usual manila
rope. Nylon rope will stretch to
half its length again before it breaks
and will stand 3,000 pounds impact
before giving out. In comparison, a
man can only stand 1,750 pounds of
impact pressure.
Furthermore, Taylor and Ramm-
Erickson were probably using a
"dynamic belay" while Baxter was
climbing. This dynamic belay means
that Baxter's companions were an
chored to the wall or the ledge, and
that when Baxter fell, pulling the
pitons out above the ledge, Taylor
and Ramm-Erickson let the safety
rope slide a short way, gradually
applying pressure, and so spread
the impact over a length of time.
Cushioning the shock like that—
the stretch of the nylon rope and
the friction of the rope around the
climbers' bodies—that's what saved
Baxter.
But above all praise should go to
Larry Taylor and Ulf Ramm-Erick
son for their x-emarkable feat of
keeping a cool head under the cir
cumstances and for just plain guts
when it came to stopping the hur
tling A 1 Baxter. It was a credit to
the Stanford Alpine Club.

half its length again before it breaks
and will stand 3,000 pounds impact
before giving out. In comparison, a
man can only stand 1,750 pounds of
impact pressure.
Furthermore, Taylor and Ramm-
Erickson were probably using a
"dynamic belay" while Baxter was
climbing. This dynamic belay means
that Baxter's companions were an
chored to the wall or the ledge, and
that when Baxter fell, pulling the
pitons out above the ledge, Taylor
and Ramm-Erickson let the safety
rope slide a short way, gradually
applying pressure, and so spread
the impact over a length of time.
Cushioning the shock like that—
the stretch of the nylon rope and
the friction of the rope around the
climbers' bodies—that's what saved
Baxter.
But above all praise should go to
Larry Taylor and Ulf Ramm-Erick
son for their x-emarkable feat of
keeping a cool head under the cir
cumstances and for just plain guts
when it came to stopping the hur
tling A 1 Baxter. It was a credit to
the Stanford Alpine Club.
Late last Sunday evening Bay
Area radio stations were spouting
news of the spectacular doings by
three Stanford climbers on Yosem
ite's treacherous Cathedral Spires.
A 1 Baxter, one of the three Farm
alpineers, had lost his footing on
the sheer perpendicular cliff* and
would have fallen to certain death
had not his two comrades checked
the drop in a remarkable manner.
The incident reminded us of some
remarks the members of the Stan
ford Alpine Club were in the habit
of making whenever they attended
meetings of the campus Ski Club
last winter quarter.
CLIMBING SAFE?
We never took them very seri
ously when they claimed that
mountain climbing was perfectly
safe, but last Sunday's incident has
made us realize that climbing with
the caliber of mountaineers that
Baxter went up with is coming as
close to safety as any man could ex
pect when he perches on a ledge
2,000 feet above the ground.
Baxter's two companions were
Larry Taylor, last year's Alpine
Club president, and Ulf Pamm-Er
ickson from Sweden, both Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity brothers and
both experienced climbers.
We can't claim to know what
happened on the cliff Sunday with
absolute certainty, but this much
we feel sure about.
Baxter, who weighs around 200
pounds and stands about 6 feet, was
undoubtedly leading the trio at
this particular spot on the face of
the cliff. He was probably just
placing a piton into the rock above
his head when he lost his footing
and started the fall.
For those of you new at this
sport, a piton is a wedge which is
driven into crevices or cracks in the
rock and which then serves as a
foothold much like the steps of a
ladder.
FACTORS IMPORTANT
Normally a 40-foot free fall is the
maximum that can be checked, but
several factors contributed to save
Baxter's life. To beqin with, his fall
was not entirely free so that A 1
broke both legs but did, on the other
hand, reduce the impact on the
safety rope.
Also the climbers used a nylon
l'ope instead of the usual manila
rope. Nylon rope will stretch to
half its length again before it breaks
and will stand 3,000 pounds impact
before giving out. In comparison, a
man can only stand 1,750 pounds of
impact pressure.
