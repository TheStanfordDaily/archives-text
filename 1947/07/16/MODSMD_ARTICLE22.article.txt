(This is the second in a series
j of articles on Ray Lunny, former
state lightweight boxing cham
pion who, on Sept. 1, becomes
Stanford's new boxing coach.)
SAN FRANCISCO. July 15.—The
affable Mr. Lunny was resigned to
a state of silence until we bandied
words akin to superstition.
"No-o-o, can't think of any hexes
or anything," he said.
Carney corrected him with "What
about that old, black, battered suit
case, the one that's in the closet j
now?"
LUNNY HEX
Ray winced: "Oh, yeah, that's
right." And he ventured to tell us
of the lavish lucky Lunny piece.
Back before the war (circa 1939)
the determined Mr. Lunny found i
himself in Los Angeles semi-broke
and nervously anticipating his first
professional battle at the Hollywood !
Legion Stadium. He needed a suit-
I case—but bad!
Seeking a bargain out of neces
sity, Ray bought an old, black, card
board suitcase for 95 cents. It's the
same suitcase that he has brought
to every fight, and in later years,
j wide strips of white adhesive tape
j have reinforced the sides and bot
j torn.
OLD SUITCASE
Arena spectators, seeing the bat
tered suitcase, have been apt to re
mark: "Can you imagine that? Here
this guy Lunny makes three grand
a fight and he can't even afford to
buy a suitcase."
Ray was fast to inject a tone of ;

seriousness into the conversation.
"When I was fighting, I always
had a lot of fun trying to outwit my
opponent—seeing if he'd fall for a
feint to the body, or maybe jab him
on the head when his guard was
down."
Carney's eyes danced a Rabelai
sian jig. She would have to pack
things and prepare for a change of
residence with Ray and Baby Car
ney in Belmont next month.
FAREWELL TO FIGHTS
"Look," we pointed out," the
weather's fine down there. And
don't forget, football season will
start soon."
Ray said: "Maybe we can buy the
baby a small red Stanford sweater."

| "What really made you give up
; fighting?" we asked.
j "The inability to exert full
strength in my right hand," Ray
! slowly remarked. "I had an opera
tion on my right hand four months
ago. The bones had been pushed
back, and the doctor tells me he
removed a kind of growth and some
i cartilage."
SENTIMENTAL GUY
For the record, it must be said
i that the pride of the Mission hung
up the gloves in 1943 after disposing
of A 1 Citrino at Civic Auditorium.
Ray is a sentimental kind of gent,
and perhaps that's why he still
hasn't really moved away from the
tempo of the Mission cradle.
