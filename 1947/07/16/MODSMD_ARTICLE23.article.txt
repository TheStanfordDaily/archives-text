Acting as "dean" is Dr. Bryan J.

lecturing is Dr. Margaret Mead, au

Seafarers' Union, who has shipped
out as a member of the crew. His
frank discussions of his union and
its problems have been among the
best we have had. But easily the
most popular personality aboard is
a photographer from Life maga

a story on the trip.

unusual, the ship itself is not. Most
Stanford veterans doubtless would
be completely at home aboard her.
The blowers are still completely un
predictable, the movie film still
breaks, and the water still goes off

CONVERTED TROOPSHIP
There have been a few changes,
however. White paint has replaced
the wartime gray, but underneath
it you can still see where someone
whiled away a few hours on the
Pacific scratching "All oflicers are
heels."
In the gun buckets, instead of
twin forties, you find a blonde from
Sarah Lawrence who thinks "there's
too damn much secularism" around

the "cafeteria" now, and they've

white cloths and added a vase of
roses which, on the eighth day out,
look a little tired.

But our purpose is a common one—
the furtherance of international un
derstanding through travel, study,
and contact with the peoples of Eu

at the University of Oslo. A smaller
group called the "Experiment in In
ternational Living" will live in Nor
wegian arid Swedish homes for the
summer.
Acting as "dean" is Dr. Bryan J.
Hovde, president of the New School
of Social Research. Among those
lecturing is Dr. Margaret Mead, au
thor of "Keep Your Powder Dry,"
whose talks on the foibles of Ameri
cans from the European standpoint
have been amusing as well as in
formative.
An ex - officio member of the
ship's "faculty" is Harry Lunde
berg, president of the International
Seafarers' Union, who has shipped
out as a member of the crew. His
frank discussions of his union and
its problems have been among the
best we have had. But easily the
most popular personality aboard is
a photographer from Life maga
zine who has been sent along to do
a story on the trip.

While the passenger list may be
unusual, the ship itself is not. Most
Stanford veterans doubtless would
be completely at home aboard her.
The blowers are still completely un
predictable, the movie film still
breaks, and the water still goes off
now and then.
CONVERTED TROOPSHIP
There have been a few changes,
however. White paint has replaced
the wartime gray, but underneath
it you can still see where someone
whiled away a few hours on the
Pacific scratching "All oflicers are
heels."
In the gun buckets, instead of
twin forties, you find a blonde from
Sarah Lawrence who thinks "there's
too damn much secularism" around
these days. They call the mess hall
the "cafeteria" now, and they've
even covered the long tables with
white cloths and added a vase of
roses which, on the eighth day out,
look a little tired.
Tomorrow half of us debark at
Plymouth for destinations as varied
as the institutions we represent.
But our purpose is a common one—
the furtherance of international un
derstanding through travel, study,
and contact with the peoples of Eu
rope.
