"The best way to combat Com
munism is to support honest un
ions."
This was the statement of Edward
T. Cheyfitz, assistant to the presi
dent of the Motion Picture Associa
tion of America, speaking before the
sixth Stanford Business Conference
Monday. The session featured a
round-table discussion of labor
management relations.
Dr. Sumner Schlichter of Harvard
University warned of a possible
class struggle in the United States
and said* he was "not too optimis
tic" over the probability of avoiding
it. Speaking of the present uphea
vals in Europe, Dr. Schlichter said:
"Heroic men who believe in their
cause will make persistent efforts to
spread the class struggle idea."
Cheyfitz criticized the Taft-Hart
ley bill as being unsuited to pro
mote industrial peace. It is not a
"slave - labor' bill," however, he
said.
The ideal l'elation between labor
and management is comparable to
the setup of a democratic govern
ment, said Cheyfitz. The legislative
branch would be composed of rep
resentatives of both, and manage
ment would comprise the executive
authority.
