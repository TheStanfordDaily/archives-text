# High 'IQ' Valued In Terman Talk
## 
### 
If a person's IQ is 140 or above,
he will probably have a better job,
better education, more income, bet
ter health, and a happier marriage
than the average person, Dr. Lewis
M. Terman, Stanford professor of
psychology emeritus, told the Tues
day Evening Series audience in Me
morial Auditorium last night.
But his prospects of becoming
world famous are small, even
though far higher than the average
person.
The lecture was the first public
announcement of the final conclu
sions reached by Dr. Terman in a
continuing study which he began in
1921 of a group of about 1,400 chil
dren. They ranged in age from 3
to 18, and were in the top 1 per cent
of the school population as far as IQ
was concerned.
