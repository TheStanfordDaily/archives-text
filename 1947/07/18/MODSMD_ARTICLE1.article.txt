## The 						World in Brief 
### 
President Truman released the
names of his nominations to the
new enlarged NLRB under the
Taft-Hartley Bill in press confer
ence yesterday. As new general
counsel he picked a Maryland Re
publican, Robert Benham. Another
Republican, Copeland Grey, was
also named to the board along with
former Democratic Senator Abe
Murdock of Utah. All of these ap
pointments are subject to Senatorial
review. The three original mem
bers will remain.
Truman also said that an emer
gency commission will be -appointed
to arbitrate the threatened SP strike
on Monday. Under the existing
statutes this should delay the strike
for a GO-day "cooling-olf" period.
THE BALKANS
Yesterday Moscow asked for an
"independent coalition government"
for Northern Greece. Russia inti
mated that the proposed govern
ment would receive political and
economic aid from Yugoslavia, Al
bania. and the rest of the Balkan
governments.
A filibuster was thi'eatened in the
UN against the request for a Balkan
commission, and a Russian veto is
expected on the issue.
Ethiopia voted today not to accept
UN or U.S. aid on the basis that
there were many areas in the world
which needed it so much more.
Sporadic fighting was reported in
Java and Dutch authorities are ex
pecting the outbreak of a full-scale
war.
CONGRESS ACTS
Speaker Joe Martin of the House
said yesterday that there would be
no doubt that the House would
override the Presidential veto on
the tax bill but that the Senate
looked doubtful. He was afraid that
the bill would be sustained there by
two votes.
The Senate has voted $200,000 for
a committee to investigate the rea
sons for the "high cost of living"
and the lack of housing. Butter in
Los Angeles jumped another 2 cents
a pound and steak prices are going
up.
The New York Yankees won two
straight over the Cleveland Indians
to boost their winning streak to 19
