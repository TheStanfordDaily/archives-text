# Straight GI Policy Advised by Vowell
## 
### 
"In converting GI Insurance the
veteran should keep it as a straight
life policy and not change it into an
endowment, for then he is using his
past savings," said Edward A. Vow
ell, VA insurance expert, before the
Stanford chapter AVC last Tuesday
evening in the Nitery.
Vowell continued by pointing out
to the veteran the service premiums
that are already in his policy, the
need for insurance, and the compar
ative cheapness of the governmnt
policy. He urged all veterans to
reinstate their policies before the
deadline next January.
