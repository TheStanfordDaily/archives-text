## Summmer Tradition Dies 
### 
Tradition says that nothing is ever done at Stanford in the
summer—that the only people who attend the summer session
are school teachers and a handful of grinds. Tradition says that
these people do nothing at all except study, and that the campus
is as dead as last Thanksgiving's turkey.
Maybe that's been true in the past, but it certainly is not now.
There are more than 3,000 students registered here; there is
more studying going on (in man-hours, at least) than ever be
fore—but that's not all. There's more life. By that we mean
there's more dating, dancing, swimming, sun-bathing, golfing,
bull sessioning—and probably even more reckless driving and
carousing.
Recreation is needed by all, but we shouldn't forget some of
the more serious—more important and significant—things that
are going on also. Of course the world is going along just as
usual, and we're still a part of it. Right here at Stanford we have
an SIRO drive which all should support. There have also been
various conferences at which top professional men have dis
cussed the leading matters of the day.
Since the guarter began v/e've had the Editors' Conference
of the California Newspaper Publishers' Association; the Na
tional Colloid Symposium; a meeting of the American Physic
al Society; and the Stanford Business Conference. The con
vention of the American Librarians' Association, which met in
San Francisco, spent a day on the campus. In the field of sports
we've had a coaching clinic presided over by gridmaster
Marchie Schwartz and Basketball Coach Everett Dean.
Let's not forget for a minute, even while we're relaxing, that
things of top significance are going on all around us—and that
we're here to learn.
