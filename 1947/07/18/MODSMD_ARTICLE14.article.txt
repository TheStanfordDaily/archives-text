You may have seen that little piece in Wednesday's Chronicle about
the Negro in North Carolina who won the Kiwanis Cadillac lottery and
then was pressured out of his prize. In case you didn't read it, some

Kiwanian said, "We discovered this was an unauthorized
ticket and explained this to the Negro and he volun
tarily surrendered it (the ticket). He was refunded the
full purchase price."
Of course, the people out here will say, or hav? said,
"Ha, ha. Now, you see. That's the South for you." And
five minutes later they're either putting the torch to
some Negro's house or nailing up a "Restricted" sign on
a housing project. That's-the-South-for-you like hell
that's the South for you. That's America for you. The
Mason-Dixon Line isn't a dividing line at all. It may be
a party line or a chorus line, but it's no dividing line.
If anything, the South has more excuse for discrimina-

tion than the North, because poorer people are more subject to fears. You
can blame the Southerners for their ignorance, but you have to blame
the Northerners for their souls.
Whomever you blame for what, I'd like to say that I'm awfully ashamed
for white people, and as far as I'm concerned, anybody who denies com
mon rights and civil liberties is white trash, whether he shares crops in
Georgia or owns a mansion in Los Altos.
"He was refunded the full purchase price."
Have you heard about the Negro who came home to find his house
being robbed? Well, he ran down to a public phone to call the police. He
put his money in the slot and dialed the station, and when the desk sergeant
answered, he told him what was happening. "I'm sorry," the sergeant said,
"but your house is in the Negro section, and we can't come down there.
However, dial the operator and she'll refund your nickel."
Then there was the Negro who machine-gunned thirty-four Japanese
on Bougainville and was coming up for a Medal of Honor. But some
Congressman held up the award, although he did send a committee.to
Bougainville to dig out those bullets and give them back to the Negro.
"Those Japanese deaths were unauthorized." said the Congressman, "but
we returned the Negro his slugs."
I shouldn't be surprised to find Jackie Robinson drawing a base on balls
and being called out on strikes by the umpire. Or hitting a home run and
hearing it called unauthorized. Yes. and the umpire would say. "You
don't know, I suppose, that those left field bleachers are restricted?
And if there were any Negro mothers who lost boys during the war,
and Negro wives who lost husbands, and Negro children who lost fathers,
try refunding them the full purchase price.
(After consultation with national Kiwanis headquarters, the local
Southern group has decided to award a second Cadillac to the original
winner of the raffle.â€”Ed.)
