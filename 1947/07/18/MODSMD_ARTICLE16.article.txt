# Praise Given First Showing Of 'High Tor'
## 
### 
When Maxwell Anderson's play
"High Tor" first opened on Broad
way back in 1937, it was the occa
sion of a good deal of excited specu
lation. Audiences worried them
selves into believing that some sig
nificant, cleverly hidden symbolism
lay under the surface of the play,
and they read meanings into the
piece which I am sure Mr. Anderson
never intended to be there.
The essentials of the plot are sim
ple. "High Tor" is the story of a
piece of windswept land in upper
New York, and its owner. Van Van
Dorn. Being a last-ditch individ
ualist, he protests against the mod
ern world by retreating to High Tor
and refusing to sell it to a con
struction company. In his lonely re
treat he seems to be on quite inti
mate terms with a group of Dutch
men marooned since the 17th cen
tury.
Upon this foundation Maxwell
Anderson has written a quaint,
often humorous, delightful fantasy
comedy, and only as such may it be
considered. Its big fault may well
be that it tackles a topic which is
too close to the allegorical, and
shuns it completely.
The general quality of the cast is
uniformly excellent, and among
those who stood out are Norman
Varnado as Van Dorn, Gladys Re
gier in the trying role of Lise, and
Martin Nalder in the difficult but
richly humorous role of Skimmer
horn.â€”Keenan
