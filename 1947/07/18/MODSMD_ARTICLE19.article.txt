The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations . . . for an intel-
ligent and sympathetic editorial
(July 14). Carskadon's remark, "The
only solution for this problem is
segregation," has no basis in factâ€”
segregation merely serves to per
petuate prejudice.
Furthermore, objective studies of
property values show that the con-
trary of the Carskadon rationaliza-
tion is the case. Property values in
Harlem, Chicago's Bronzeville, and
other areas of Negro concentration
are extremely high. In fact, the
myth is generally used to get white
tenants to sell at a loss so that the
property may be sold or rented at
exorbitant prices.
This whole business seems a sad
commentary on some aspects of
American life that are too often
true: that human values take a back
seat to property values. (From
biased observation. Harry Carska

don seems to be doing all right for
himself.)

The Editor, Sir:
Is Bull Session's Bud Arnold sure
the New Yorker holds top place
among those at Stanford who can
read? I thought it was Chappie.
And, Arnold, why stray from the
University itself? Have you ever
considered the "No - Smoking -on -
Quad" edict? Stanford keeps pump
ing blood into the old corpse, but
perhaps (now ever so delicately)
you can persuade the ivy-covered
boys to let the poor old tradition
stay dead.
