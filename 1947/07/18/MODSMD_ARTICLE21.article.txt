SAN FRANCISCO. July 17.—Try
a daily diet of road work, shadow
boxing, skipping rope, and sparring
and you may wind up as the logi
cal contender for a boxing title.
Such was once the schedule of
Ray Lunny, who admitted: "I'd only
train for half a day. For real re
laxation, I'd go to a movie and for
get things."
"He'd always fall asleep," Carney
said of Ray.
"That's to be expected when you
work hard." we ventured.
Ray thanked us for our support.
When we began questioning Car
ney's household domestic ability.
Ray began tossing verbal blue rib
bons with genuine eclat. He was
as sincere as blue sky.
QUITE A COOK
"You wouldn't believe this, but
she's a better cook than her moth
er, and that's going some."
Carney lowered her head: "Oh
my . .
1 We were of no mind to be caught
between favorable adjectives and
modest repudiation until Baby Car
ney reappeared upon the scene
half-wanting to cry.
"She won't cry in front of stran
gers. I don't know how she does it,
but she just fights back the tears."

The baby was born on Dec. 7,
1944, which may serve to remind
Ray of numberous days bound in
Coast Guard blues. While stationed
a( Treasure Island the Mission belt
er, who has all of the finesse of the
immortal James J. Corbett, trained
scores of would-be boxers.
"It wasn't that they wanted to
learn how to fight," Ray said, "it
was part of their program. But I
imagine thev learned something."

Boxer, ring instructor, referee,

Stanford ring tutor!
Don Liebendorfer, Farm publicist,
has remarked: "Never was an ap
pointment met with such unani
mous approval as the one which an
nounced Ray Lunny as a member of
the Stanford Family."
We left the Lunny household at
sundown, a bright, sunny end of
day indicative of the Lunny hospi
tality and unassuming charm.
