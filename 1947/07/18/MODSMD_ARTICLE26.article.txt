### 
"With the establishment of a
school for Village children next fall,
Stanford Village will have reached
'he status of a self-contained com
nunity," Resident Counselor Her
bert J. Wunderlich said yesterday.
The University recently signed a
contract with the Menlo Park School
Board for establishment of the
l3 chool. Stanford will supply the
building and equipment, and Menlo
Park will furnish the teacher.
Although definite needs are not
yet known, said Wunderlich, a re-

I cent survey showed that there are
I at present 22 children of kindergar
ten and elementary school age. Of
the 217 children, 137 are under the
age of two years, 58 are between
two and four, and 22 are between
four and eleven.
The school will be held in Build
ing 417, which was the Red Cross
recreation room when Dibble Gen
j eral Hospital occupied the area.
School-age children hitherto have
attended Central School in Menlo
! Park.
