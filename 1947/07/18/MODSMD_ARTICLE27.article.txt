# Tennis, Golf, Dancing Lead Summer Life
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
Summer quarter, as usual, is be
ing accompanied by something of a
lull in the familiar, scintillating
swirl of Stanford social life. But in
spite of the discouraging ratio and
rather small enrollment, there's
plenty to do in the way of amuse
ment.
In the first place, you can dust off
those swimming suits and paddle
around the Women's Pool from 3 to
5 on Sundays, or better yet, you can
take your potentially tanned torso
to Searsville, Santa Cruz, San Gre
gorio, Half Moon Bay, or Carmel.
Take your books if you must, but
don't miss that soothing sand, salt
air, and sunshine.
Then, after the initial sunburn has
subsided, why not muscle in on a
different racket . . . meaning, of
course, the women's tennis courts
or the Encina courts. And in the
course of your search for amuse
ment you could play a few i-ounds
of golf. Stanford's greens fees are
quite reasonable, and you won't find
many courses as interesting as ours.
CAMPUS DANCES
For on-campus evenings of enter
tainment, it's best to watch The
Daily for announcements of such
get-togethers as the Lagunita dance,
scheduled for July 25, the Encina
dances on July 2G and Aug. 15, and
the big ASSU party set for Aug. 2.
If you have a touch of the wan
derlust, you can always head for
parts well known, such as Dinah's
Shack, Longbarn, Rossotti's, L'Ome
lette. Belt's, Rickey's, or the Stone
Cellar. Especially recommended for
dancing are the Adobe Creek Lodge,
Conger's, the Band Box, and the
Bon Ton Club. San Francisco also
has its attractions, but if you're not
the shy type, there's always that
lockout liability.
HIDING
Now, after all of that swimming,
tennis, golf, and dancing, you can
let your lamenting limbs languish
while you gallop madly forth from
Stanford's Red Barn astride a real,
usually live, horse.
You see, there really is a lot to
do in and around the Farm this
summer, and when you leave the
wheelchair just keep having fun,
playing bridge, table tennis, shoot
ing pool, bull sessioning, picnicking,
seeing movies, and perhaps even
taking a stroll around the Quad.
At any rate, just go ahead and
have a good time. You wouldn't
enjoy fall quarter anyway.

scheduled for July 25, the Encina
dances on July 2G and Aug. 15, and
the big ASSU party set for Aug. 2.
If you have a touch of the wan
derlust, you can always head for
parts well known, such as Dinah's
Shack, Longbarn, Rossotti's, L'Ome
lette. Belt's, Rickey's, or the Stone
Cellar. Especially recommended for
dancing are the Adobe Creek Lodge,
Conger's, the Band Box, and the
Bon Ton Club. San Francisco also
has its attractions, but if you're not
the shy type, there's always that
lockout liability.
HIDING
Now, after all of that swimming,
tennis, golf, and dancing, you can
let your lamenting limbs languish
while you gallop madly forth from
Stanford's Red Barn astride a real,
usually live, horse.
You see, there really is a lot to
do in and around the Farm this
summer, and when you leave the
wheelchair just keep having fun,
playing bridge, table tennis, shoot
ing pool, bull sessioning, picnicking,
seeing movies, and perhaps even
taking a stroll around the Quad.
At any rate, just go ahead and
have a good time. You wouldn't
enjoy fall quarter anyway.
Summer quarter, as usual, is be
ing accompanied by something of a
lull in the familiar, scintillating
swirl of Stanford social life. But in
spite of the discouraging ratio and
rather small enrollment, there's
plenty to do in the way of amuse
ment.
In the first place, you can dust off
those swimming suits and paddle
around the Women's Pool from 3 to
5 on Sundays, or better yet, you can
take your potentially tanned torso
to Searsville, Santa Cruz, San Gre
gorio, Half Moon Bay, or Carmel.
Take your books if you must, but
don't miss that soothing sand, salt
air, and sunshine.
Then, after the initial sunburn has
subsided, why not muscle in on a
different racket . . . meaning, of
course, the women's tennis courts
or the Encina courts. And in the
course of your search for amuse
ment you could play a few i-ounds
of golf. Stanford's greens fees are
quite reasonable, and you won't find
many courses as interesting as ours.
CAMPUS DANCES
For on-campus evenings of enter
tainment, it's best to watch The
Daily for announcements of such
get-togethers as the Lagunita dance,
scheduled for July 25, the Encina
dances on July 2G and Aug. 15, and
the big ASSU party set for Aug. 2.
