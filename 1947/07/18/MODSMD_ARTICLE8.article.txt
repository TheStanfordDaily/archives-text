# Hoover Makes Stanford Visit
## Suggests College Exchange Project 
### 
Just before sailing for Europe,
Lawrence Grannis and Bill Farrer
spent an hour with Herbert Hoover
in his New York office-apartment in
the Waldorf Towers. Judging from
his extensive offices and large staff,
Farrer and Grannis agree that he
is still very much in public affairs.
They learned he has a constant
stream of visitors —public officials,
newsmen, travelers, and others who
to exchange views and infor
mation with the former President.
Mr. Hoover also spends several
hours a day writing; he writes about
public affairs and problems of re
lief, they reported.
ASSU PI,AN
He seemed both interested and
pleased to learn of the ASSU's two
fold plan for exchange scholarships
and relief projects for universities
abroad, the ISC representatives
said. He told them that all Ameri
! can colleges could and should do a
great deal more along these lines,
j and added that only recently he had
appealed to certain American uni
i versities to develop such programs.
German, Austrian, and Italian
universities, said Mr. Hoover, are
the most needy in Europe—or at
least that part of Europe outside the
Soviet zone.
On learning that Stanford is al
ready sending aid to the University
of Naples, the former President rec
ommended that the student body
send enough food to raise the diet
of both faculty and students 400 or
500 calories per day. This would
not, he said, require a large money
outlay.
CLOTHING. BOOKS NEEDED
Of course clothing and books are
still badly needed by all of Europe's
institutions, Mr. Hoover said. He
stressed especially the need for
technical publications—and even old
magazines—in countries where stu
dents have for so long been denied
access to the free flow of informa
tion.
Farrer and Grannis asked Mr.
Hoover whether or not he believed
exchange scholarships wei-e prac
tical at present. He recalled his own
experience after the last war when
his relief organization used surplus
funds for the exchange of students
between the United States and Bel
gium. Six members of the present
Belgian government and many pro
fessors now teaching at Belgian uni
versities studied in America under
that program, he said.
GENUINE IMPACT
A similar student exchange now,
believes Mr. Hoover, would have a
genuine impact on relations with
other countries —just as it did with
Belgium then. When Stanford es
tablishes such scholarships, he rec
ommends that the student body, as
a starter, first exchange graduate
students—and that such students be
selected by their respective facul
ties. He added, however, that there
are no hard and fast rules for such
programs, and that any well-plan
ned program would be a worth
while undertaking.—Steve Martin

Of course clothing and books are
still badly needed by all of Europe's
institutions, Mr. Hoover said. He
stressed especially the need for
technical publications—and even old
magazines—in countries where stu
dents have for so long been denied
access to the free flow of informa
tion.
Farrer and Grannis asked Mr.
Hoover whether or not he believed
exchange scholarships wei-e prac
tical at present. He recalled his own
experience after the last war when
his relief organization used surplus
funds for the exchange of students
between the United States and Bel
gium. Six members of the present
Belgian government and many pro
fessors now teaching at Belgian uni
versities studied in America under
that program, he said.
GENUINE IMPACT
A similar student exchange now,
believes Mr. Hoover, would have a
genuine impact on relations with
other countries —just as it did with
Belgium then. When Stanford es
tablishes such scholarships, he rec
ommends that the student body, as
a starter, first exchange graduate
students—and that such students be
selected by their respective facul
ties. He added, however, that there
are no hard and fast rules for such
programs, and that any well-plan
ned program would be a worth
while undertaking.—Steve Martin
Just before sailing for Europe,
Lawrence Grannis and Bill Farrer
spent an hour with Herbert Hoover
in his New York office-apartment in
the Waldorf Towers. Judging from
his extensive offices and large staff,
Farrer and Grannis agree that he
is still very much in public affairs.
They learned he has a constant
stream of visitors —public officials,
newsmen, travelers, and others who
to exchange views and infor
mation with the former President.
Mr. Hoover also spends several
hours a day writing; he writes about
public affairs and problems of re
lief, they reported.
ASSU PI,AN
He seemed both interested and
pleased to learn of the ASSU's two
fold plan for exchange scholarships
and relief projects for universities
abroad, the ISC representatives
said. He told them that all Ameri
! can colleges could and should do a
great deal more along these lines,
j and added that only recently he had
appealed to certain American uni
i versities to develop such programs.
German, Austrian, and Italian
universities, said Mr. Hoover, are
the most needy in Europe—or at
least that part of Europe outside the
Soviet zone.
On learning that Stanford is al
ready sending aid to the University
of Naples, the former President rec
ommended that the student body
send enough food to raise the diet
of both faculty and students 400 or
500 calories per day. This would
not, he said, require a large money
outlay.
