THE SPACE
Dear Marcus:
There was a young coed named
Sally
Who resembled a painting by Dali
She was timid and frail
And thin as a rail
And shunned by the men around
Paly.
Then she went to LONGBARN for
dinn>t,
And suddenly ceased to get thinner.
In fact, she filled out
In a manner so vout
Th t the fellas all wanted to pin
her.
But to each one of them she was
deaf—
just frost with a capital "F"
Since the food was delicious
As well as nutritious,
She married the LONGBARN'S
young chef.
R. C. Kirby
ENVY
The autos pass me to and fro,
I look at them and sigh.
For I must on tiredfoot go,
And I would rather die.
