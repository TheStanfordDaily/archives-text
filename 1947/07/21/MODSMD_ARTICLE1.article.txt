## The 						World in Brief 
### 
The world spotlight turned on
Asia yesterday when 100,000 Dutch
troops, led by a crack Dutch marine
division trained in Quantico for war
against the Japanese, began an all
out war on the 200,000 armed Java
nese who demand complete inde
pendence.
Dutch leaders admitted the out
break of hostilities with the state
ment that "this is not a war against
the Javanese people, but only
against the leaders who have tried
to sabotage the peace."
At the same time this statement
was issued Dutch troops occupied
main governmental buildings in Ba
tavia and jailed important Javanese
leaders.
JAPANESE WEAPONS
Javanese troops are equipped
with Japanese weapons and many
were trained by the Japanese dur
ing World War 11.
In Burma possible civil war is
brewing following the assassination
of U Aung San last Saturday. Fierce
fighting has broken out between
partisan forces at points 60 and 80
miles from Rangoon.
All the implements of modern
war have gone into the continuing
battle between the organized Jew
ish underground and British troops
in Palestine. Called a miniature "El
Alamein" by competent observers,
the pitched battle is thought to be
the kickoff to an all-out war in that
troubled land. The Jewish under
ground has announced that it has
100,000 troops at its disposal and
the latest drive has all the aspects
of a real "shooting war."
NEW JEWISH POLICY
Although no oilicial announce
ment from the British government
has been released, it is apparent
that a new policy on Jewish refu
gees in Palestine has been inaugu
rated. Three ships, long overdue at
Haifa, internment camp for all il
legal persons caught trying to enter
Palestine, are reported to have re
turned to France, their point of de
parture.
The threatened strike of railroad
workers of the Southern Pacific,
termed illegal by management late
yesterday under existing legisla
tion. is expected to start as sched
uled at 6 this morning.
