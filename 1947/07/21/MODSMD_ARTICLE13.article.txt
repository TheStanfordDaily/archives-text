# Daily Editorials
## A
						Word for Critics 
### 
The Daily, this volume, anyway, has tried to avoid the brash,
self-conscious statements of policy particularly beloved of
school papers. We consider ourselves to be a newspaper—per
haps only a small-town paper but a newspaper. And a news
paper, to our way of thinking, prints news. That is a concise
statement of our policy.
Now, we have heard it said that we are not printing the news,
nol all of it, or enough of it, or the right parts of it, and so on.
To those of you who feel this way, or may feel like this in the
future, we offer an explanation.
The important point is that the Daily is short of space. For
financial reasons, we have had to reduce our size to four pages.
For the same financial reasons, those four half-sized pages must
include a substantial proportion of advertising. A glance at
today's sports page will show you what can happen. Yet we
have an enrollment of over 3,000, and an above-average quota
of summer activities. In other words, we have plenty of legiti
mate news to print, and by no means enough space in which to
print it.
The result of this situation is that we are forced to be more
selective of our news than ever. We consider several aspects,
keeping in mind that we are a community paper. The absolute
significance cannot be the sole determining factor. Before you,
gentle reader, criticize our selection harshly, consider: is the
story we left out of general interest to the student body or of
substantial importance to them? Is the story to which we gave
but inadequate space of such over-riding interest or importance
that it should crowd some other item out of the paper?
If you have given us a story and it hasn't appeared, believe
us. it wasn't deliberate and it wasn't censorship. It just worked
out that in that issue there were too many stories of greater im
portance and interest and better adapted to our space situation.
The same applies to the "Campus Opinion" column. If you
write us a good letter, we'll print it—just as soon as we have the
space.
