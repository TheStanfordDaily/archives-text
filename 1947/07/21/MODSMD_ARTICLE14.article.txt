The Stanford roiu;h is always being ballvhoOed as one of our sweetest
traditions, and like most of the folklore in these 8.800 acres it is just rot.
Oh. the rough is really something. He's no gent, he says, and he dresses to
prove what a democratic hoy he is.
Probably it all goes back to this "Farm" foolishness, and we still have
a population that fancies itself as a collection of strawberry pickers and

stable boys. "Lock what a regular guy I am," the rough
says as he nudges you to observe his dungarees, and
then he sneers, "The only people around here who wear
ties and coats are faculty and foreigners."
Of course this is all a sham because what the Stan
ford rough really is has nothing to do with what he
wears. The state of mind of the Stanford rough — his
notions of politics, society and sociology—ought to have
clothed him more appropriately in a double-breasted
pin-stripe, and there are even a few of the stuffiest kind
who ought to stick to the explosive collar.
It would be a fallacy to suppose that every student
at Stanford has a four-figure checking account. There

are plenty of us here on the cuff from the U.S. Treasury, scholarships still
support many, and the hasher is not yet extinct. A lot of these people
haven't the cash to dress better than they do, but they certainly ought to
snicker at the crowd that says, "We're all the same because we dress like
a bunch of bums ourselves."
Really, this rough thing is a pose, and nolhing is more absurd than the
spectacle of some T-shirted, denim-pantsed punk prancing out of a block
long jewel of a convertible Chrysler. He's really rough, isn't he'.' And if
you're standing in that little painted cage on Palm Drive waiting for a
lift, why this plutocratic rough might even stop and let you bum a ride.
Then you and he will be dressed just alike—just a couple ol roughs, and
look how equalitarian and democratic we all are. But who does he think
lie's kidding? Why does lie bother? The seat of his pants doesn't match
the upholstery.
The hoboes have a good tag for the ousider who musses his hair and
gets into his old clothes so lie can mix with the vags and the tramps to
see how they live and then maybe write a book about them. They call
him a scenery stid. Likewise the Stanford rough—just scenery. You know
he can always motor back to the frat (it's so gauche to say "frat at Stan
ford), get into the latest number from Phelps-Terkel and run up to the
Fairmont or whatever dull place is popular these days. But you try and
get past the torpedoes at any fancy gin mill in the city in that Stanford
rough getup and see what happens.
"Why, I'm a Stanford rough," you tell the majordomo.
"You're a Stanford jerk," he tells you, and he has something there.

Oh. the rough is really something. He's no gent, he says, and he dresses to
prove what a democratic hoy he is.
Probably it all goes back to this "Farm" foolishness, and we still have
a population that fancies itself as a collection of strawberry pickers and

stable boys. "Lock what a regular guy I am," the rough
says as he nudges you to observe his dungarees, and
then he sneers, "The only people around here who wear
ties and coats are faculty and foreigners."
Of course this is all a sham because what the Stan
ford rough really is has nothing to do with what he
wears. The state of mind of the Stanford rough — his
notions of politics, society and sociology—ought to have
clothed him more appropriately in a double-breasted
pin-stripe, and there are even a few of the stuffiest kind
who ought to stick to the explosive collar.
It would be a fallacy to suppose that every student
at Stanford has a four-figure checking account. There

are plenty of us here on the cuff from the U.S. Treasury, scholarships still
support many, and the hasher is not yet extinct. A lot of these people
haven't the cash to dress better than they do, but they certainly ought to
snicker at the crowd that says, "We're all the same because we dress like
a bunch of bums ourselves."
Really, this rough thing is a pose, and nolhing is more absurd than the
spectacle of some T-shirted, denim-pantsed punk prancing out of a block
long jewel of a convertible Chrysler. He's really rough, isn't he'.' And if
you're standing in that little painted cage on Palm Drive waiting for a
lift, why this plutocratic rough might even stop and let you bum a ride.
Then you and he will be dressed just alike—just a couple ol roughs, and
look how equalitarian and democratic we all are. But who does he think
lie's kidding? Why does lie bother? The seat of his pants doesn't match
the upholstery.
The hoboes have a good tag for the ousider who musses his hair and
gets into his old clothes so lie can mix with the vags and the tramps to
see how they live and then maybe write a book about them. They call
him a scenery stid. Likewise the Stanford rough—just scenery. You know
he can always motor back to the frat (it's so gauche to say "frat at Stan
ford), get into the latest number from Phelps-Terkel and run up to the
Fairmont or whatever dull place is popular these days. But you try and
get past the torpedoes at any fancy gin mill in the city in that Stanford
rough getup and see what happens.
"Why, I'm a Stanford rough," you tell the majordomo.
"You're a Stanford jerk," he tells you, and he has something there.

The Stanford roiu;h is always being ballvhoOed as one of our sweetest
traditions, and like most of the folklore in these 8.800 acres it is just rot.
