# Old Boy Finds Home at Last

"Boy, oh boy!" said the Old Boy.
"Finally enough room to swing a
hammer in.'"
The Ancient One sealed himself
regally on the Coffin, grasped the
silver Hammer and fixed a stern
gaze on the Daily reporter. "What
can I tell you, young man?"
"What happened to you?"
The Old Boy beamed. "New of
fices, fine new offices for the Chap
arral. Across the street from the
Geology corner, in the old Roble
pool," he said.
With a dubious look at the Daily
reporter (who was looking dubious
too), the Old Boy added, "In back
of the Quad office, that is."
"Will there be a Summer Chap
pie?"
"No," said the Old Boy, "we de
cided to devote our undoubted tal
ents (undoubted, that is, by every
one but the Administration and a
man named Endsley) this summer
to fixing up our new offices."—Mar
