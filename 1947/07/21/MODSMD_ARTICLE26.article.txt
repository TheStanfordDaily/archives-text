# ISC Delegate Finds Oxford Study System Emphasizes Independent Work, No Classes
## 
### LAWRENCE GRANNIS 
' Oxford today is not unlike what
it was 400 years ago. One can still
make of it just about what one
pleases."
The speaker was Bill Parr, an
undergraduate in English literature.
Wo were sitting in his rooms in Bal
liol College, Oxford, to which he
had invited us on learning of our
visit to the campus.

Like most of Oxford's present
student body. Bill is a veteran—five
years in India and Burma with the
British Army—and at 29 he has the
same strong desire to finish up his
college work that many American
student-veterans express. But there
the similarity stops; the approach to
I studies of an Oxford undergraduate
is vastly different from ours.
For one thing, Bill is required to
go to no classes and he takes no
examinations until the very end of
his three-year course. Instead, he
works almost entirely on his own.
About once a week he spends an
j hour with his tutor —an instructor
to whom he was assigned when he
I began his course.
WEEKLY ESSAYS
At this session the tutor outlines
! further references to be consulted
and discusses with him the weekly
essay on his chosen subject. The
essay, in fact, is the only fixed obli
gation Bill has; everything else is
entirely up to him.
"At first I went to all lectures,
now I go rather seldom—that's pret
ty much standard procedure here.
Afternoons I keep free—for cycling,
rowing, and what not.
"I usually study all evening. Eve
nings are when our societies meet;
there are no purely social ones.
They all meet for a purpose—poli
tics, art, literature, debating, and so
on."
COMMUNISTS RESPECTABLE'
"When I first came," he added
wryly, "I went to many of them.
I joined the Conservative, Labor (or
Socialist), and Communist societies
(one can be a Communist here and
it's quite respectable, you know). I
| was going to get all viewpoints, but
i it only confused things and used up
I a lot of valuable time."
This is not to say that Bill is not
I very much interested in politics. lie
i is. In the face of the great problems
, confronting England today, few
| Englishmen are indifferent—or can
j afford to be. In Bill's opinion, most
| Oxford undergraduates are swing
■ ing toward the Conservative party.
However, Bill believes the pres
ent undergraduate trend toward the
Conservatives is due to a wholly

natural reaction to more controls—
after eight years of them—rather
than to any basic opposition to
Britain's gradual socialization.
While Bill finds some of the pre
war leisurely atmosphere of Oxford
destroyed by the influx of students
and his own desire to hurry
through, his life is pretty much the
way it was when he left.
Probably the most significant
change is in his fellow - students,
| most of whom are—like himself—
! veterans on "Government Grants"
j similar to our GI Bill—a large num
-1 ber of whom, in the normal course
j of events, would not have attended
Oxford.

However, Bill believes the pres

Conservatives is due to a wholly

natural reaction to more controls—
after eight years of them—rather
than to any basic opposition to
Britain's gradual socialization.
While Bill finds some of the pre
war leisurely atmosphere of Oxford
destroyed by the influx of students
and his own desire to hurry
through, his life is pretty much the
way it was when he left.
