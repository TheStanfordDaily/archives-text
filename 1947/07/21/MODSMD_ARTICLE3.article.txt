Marchie Schwartz, Stanford foot
ball coach, was aboard the Lark to
day en route to Chicago via Los An
geles and New Orleans, and there
was some indication he might "be
stranded in Phoenix" if the threat
ened strike of Southern Pacific en
gineers goes into effect. The tie-up,
which would afTect 25,000 SP em
ployees. is set for G p.m. today.
"If I get caught in Phoenix,"
Marchie said prior to departure last
night, "I'll just have to sweat it out
there."
Selected as Far West coaching
representative of the College All-
Stars in their game with the profes
sional champs, the Chicago Bears,
Marchie is due to arrive in Chicago
Saturday, Aug. 2.
The game, slated for Chicago's
mammoth Soldiers' Field, will be
played Friday night, Aug. 22.
Accompanying the Card gridiron

laughingly admitted "it will be her
first vacation in years."
Schwartz will return to Stanford
the week following the game to pre
pare for the initial session of Pa
cific Coast Conference grid practice.
"I'll make no bones about Stan
ford's having a weak line," Marchie
declared yesterday, "but we'll have
something on the field. But I've
often been tempted to trade part of
a backfield for help in the line."
