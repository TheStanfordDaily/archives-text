# Businessmen Probe Future Responsibility
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Some sober constructive thinking
and talk were given to problems
of management, labor, and the im
mediate future of business at the
Sixth Stanford Business Conference
last week on campus.
Over 200 educators and business
executives from the West attended
20 general sessions and split up for
22 round-table discussions at the
five-day meeting.
The feeling of the conference ap
peared to be that the time has come
for both management and labor to
realize their responsibilities to the
public lest the public be forced to
regulate both.
SLIGHTER DISCUSSION HEAD
. Discussion of the basic problems
of capitalistic economy were con
ducted by Dr. Sumner Slichter,
Harvard economist, who opened
each day's sessions. Dr. Slichter
defined the basic characteristics and
three fundamental problems of
American economy.
In his analysis Slichter warned of
the danger of labor - management
conflicts widening to become a class
struggle. To limit fluctuation in de
mand and production, he suggested
income should be less dependent on
volume of private production and
that incentives and controls should
be created to make changes in pri
vate demand less pronounced.
ECONOMIC WAR
In regard to international policy,
he affirmed that we are already at
war economically with Russia.
None of the speakers predicted
either a sharp rise or decline of
prices in the near future. Most fore
saw maintenance of present high
levels of prices and costs for from
five to eight years.
Stanford professors who led dis
cussions or round-table groups in
cluded:
Allen J. Knight, Herbert E. Dou
gall. David E. Faville, Eugene L.
Grant, Paul E. Holden, Theodore J.
Kreps, Frank K. Shallenberger,
William A. Spurr, Edward K.
Strong, Jr., William F. Talbot, and
John P. Troxell.
