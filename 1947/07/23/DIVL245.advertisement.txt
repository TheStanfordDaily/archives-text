Introducing a new Travel Agency—and a new Travel
Service. We are "dual" specialists, and perhaps you can
guess from our title, the
UMIVERITY AIR TRAVEL SERVICE
that we emphasize Air Travel, especially designed for
University people. After one call or visit to our office,
we know you'll decide we are experts in Service, as well.
Whether you only have a few minutes between classes
to call us for information or reservations at
P.A. 9788
or whether you can spend a leisurely and cool hour in
the afternoon or evening with us at our office in the
"Courtyard of the Spreading Oak" at
522 RAMONA
we are sure you will find it worth your time.
Incidentally, you electrical engineers, if you can help
us design a miniature airport beacon for our office—as
an advertising sign"—a roundtrip, via Southwest Air
ways, to Monterey (Calif., not Mexico!* is yours without
charge. Most practical idea wins. Don't make it too ex
pensive or huge—remember we said "miniature." We
don't want to have pianes making "passes" trying to land
i;i our patio?
Thank you,
