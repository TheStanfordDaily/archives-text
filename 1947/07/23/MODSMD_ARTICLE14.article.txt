# SIRO Drive Nets 'Satisfying Result'
## 
### 
Stanford's drive for food, cloth
ing, bedding, and money for desti
tute friends and relatives in Europe
and Asia has been moving with sat
isfying success, said Cliff Forster
and Mary Cleek, co-chairmen of the
Stanford International Relief Or
ganization.
"But." Miss Cleek reminded, "be
cause we have had success in this
week's concentrated drive does not
mean relief goods are no longer
needed." Donations may still be
made at the SIRO boxes at the Un
ion Snack Bar and in the lobbies of
Encina and Lagunita.
Those wishing to make contribu
tions but who are unable to leave
them at the designated spots may
call committeeman Ed Wells, local
8624, who will arrange for their col
lection, said Forster. Money may be
mailed to SIRO, Postoffice Box 2488.
