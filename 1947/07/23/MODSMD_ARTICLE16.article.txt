## We Want Warren! 
### 
"If the Republicans don't want him, we'll take him." That is
what the Democratic Governor of Utah said about California's Earl
Warren recently. Personally, we don't care which ticket he runs
on—but we'd like a chance to vote for him, for President.
There has been much talk of Presidential nominations of late, |
but Harold Stassen is the only man who has had the nerve to
come right out and say he wants the job (and he is not supposed
to have much of a chance). We feel that Earl Warren is the only
good man who would have a chance.
He has accomplished things in his own state that we would
like to see done on a national scale. He has done this in the face
of a rebellious Republican leadership here in California—a lead
ership that would gladly throw him overboard if it dared. He has
shown in his own state that he can weld opposing factions into
some semblance of unity —and put through the major items of
his program.
His victory at the last gubernatorial primary was unprece- !
dented; he has had as much success with a recalcitrant legisla
ture as, for instance, Thomas E. Dewey has had with a well-disci
plined Republican steamroller in New York.
Space is short, so we can't tell you all he has done; however,
there is one significant item that has been largely overlooked. He
has instituted a program of putting aside surplus monies in boom
times, to guard against the proverbial rainy day. This piogram
has a double virtue: in boom times it is deflationary, while the
expenditure of that fund during a depression will serve as a shot
in the arm to an anemic economic system.
Such leadership, we feel, belongs at the head of the national
government. We would like to see Governor Warren declare !
himself and make an active fight for the Presidential nomination.
