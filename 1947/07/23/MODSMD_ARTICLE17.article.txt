I m glad to see that the Third Major League nonsense has died down.
Now everyone can settle back into the more sensible idea that the Pacific
Coast League is just a collection of second-rate nightclubs and alwavs will

-I V-W..VVUUM V. JV.V.UIIU-1 II it iliglULlUUa ctllU Will
be. You know for sure that the Seals, for instance, don't
play real baseball, not when they advertise on the enter
tainment pages of the daily papers. Naturally they
couldn't sell their games under Sports.
Coast League baseball is entertainment, all right, if
it is entertaining when baserunners bypass each other
on the bags, when outfielders are letting pop flies drop
between them like chunks of hot lead, and when strike
out barons like Vince DiMaggio can smash home runs
every day. Oh, yes, and maybe it's also entertaining
when first basemen like Les Scarsella can forget how
many outs there are and throw away a run or two.
I could understand a Coast League attempt to affiliate

itself with the Theater Guild or. better yet, Ringling Brothers, but it
should understand that it belongs right where it is in the BASEBALL
circuit. Maybe the Seals or the Angels or the Acorns could go over big
at the Hippodrome with their comedy juggling acts and mistaken identity
routines, but they would certainly be lost in the sun of Yankee Stadium.
Of course. I will get the argument that all the Barbarous Coast wants
is live years to MAKE itself a major league. But I say that inside of
three years all their good players will be blind from playing .under lights
five days a week. I'll grant that major league clubs play night games once
in a while, but at least they're apologetic about this curse. However, out
here you'd think that playing night games was a distinction, and the club
owners would freeze the fans to death with night double-headers that
break up after even the rats and cockroaches have gone to sleQp.
The whole Third Major League malarkey is just high pressure stuff
coming from a bunch of careless directors who are too lazy to make this
even a good MINOR league out here.
I sometimes wonder what a good manager like Lefty O'Doul is doing
out here, but I think I have the answer. Why, after all, should he risk the
major leagues when he has such a soft touch out here? As for Casey
Stengel, when a managbr of his low caliber can hold a team in the first
division, you know for sure that this league is easy pickings. I saw some
of those Boston teams that Stengel once managed, and I can tell you that
those boys were the most dull and ill-inspired vertebrates I've seen since
I had a glance at a sloth in my childhood.
Everything else aside, though, I'm glad they have the glass backstop
at Seals Stadium. It doesn't help the eyes so much as it takes a little wear
and tear off the nose. I'll hand it to Charlie Graham: he knows how to
hide a smell.

be. You know for sure that the Seals, for instance, don't
play real baseball, not when they advertise on the enter
tainment pages of the daily papers. Naturally they
couldn't sell their games under Sports.
Coast League baseball is entertainment, all right, if
it is entertaining when baserunners bypass each other
on the bags, when outfielders are letting pop flies drop
between them like chunks of hot lead, and when strike
out barons like Vince DiMaggio can smash home runs
every day. Oh, yes, and maybe it's also entertaining
when first basemen like Les Scarsella can forget how
many outs there are and throw away a run or two.
I could understand a Coast League attempt to affiliate

itself with the Theater Guild or. better yet, Ringling Brothers, but it
should understand that it belongs right where it is in the BASEBALL
circuit. Maybe the Seals or the Angels or the Acorns could go over big
at the Hippodrome with their comedy juggling acts and mistaken identity
routines, but they would certainly be lost in the sun of Yankee Stadium.
Of course. I will get the argument that all the Barbarous Coast wants
is live years to MAKE itself a major league. But I say that inside of
three years all their good players will be blind from playing .under lights
five days a week. I'll grant that major league clubs play night games once
in a while, but at least they're apologetic about this curse. However, out
here you'd think that playing night games was a distinction, and the club
owners would freeze the fans to death with night double-headers that
break up after even the rats and cockroaches have gone to sleQp.
The whole Third Major League malarkey is just high pressure stuff
coming from a bunch of careless directors who are too lazy to make this
even a good MINOR league out here.
I sometimes wonder what a good manager like Lefty O'Doul is doing
out here, but I think I have the answer. Why, after all, should he risk the
major leagues when he has such a soft touch out here? As for Casey
Stengel, when a managbr of his low caliber can hold a team in the first
division, you know for sure that this league is easy pickings. I saw some
of those Boston teams that Stengel once managed, and I can tell you that
those boys were the most dull and ill-inspired vertebrates I've seen since
I had a glance at a sloth in my childhood.
Everything else aside, though, I'm glad they have the glass backstop
at Seals Stadium. It doesn't help the eyes so much as it takes a little wear
and tear off the nose. I'll hand it to Charlie Graham: he knows how to
hide a smell.

I m glad to see that the Third Major League nonsense has died down.
Now everyone can settle back into the more sensible idea that the Pacific
Coast League is just a collection of second-rate nightclubs and alwavs will
