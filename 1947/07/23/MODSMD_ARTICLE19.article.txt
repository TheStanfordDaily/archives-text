The Editor, Sir:
Although agreeing wholehearted
ly with your editorial of July 14, I
fear that you have left yourself
wide open to a reply by Mr. Car
skadon and his ilk questioning your
sincerity—to wit: the order of your
own house, the "Stanford Family."
As any Farm resident with the most
elementary powers of observation
can tell you, this great University
is actively practicing discrimination
against Negroes in its student-ad
mission policy. Last quarter with
over 7.000. and this quarter with
over 3,000 students in attendance,
there have been, I believe, exactly
two colored students at Stanford.
. . . Negroes comprise approxi
mately 10 per cent of the population
of the U.S., yet their number at
Stanford is much less than 1/100 of
what should be their proportionate
representation in the student body.
. . . . (Remember the little space
on your application blank asking
"Race"?)
I can see no justification whatso
ever for this discriminatory policy
in a University whose very motto is
translated as "Let the winds of free
dom blow," especially in this part
of the country where racial discrim
ination, at least toward the Negro,
is supposedly weakest. If Mr. Car
skadon had attended a school where
racial discrimination toward Ne
groes was not practiced, he might
have a different attitude on the sub
ject.
