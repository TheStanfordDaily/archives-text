# Forty-Niners Open Practice
## 
### 
With an eager eye cast on the
Western Division title that they lost
last year to the Cleveland Browns,
the San Francisco Forty - Niners
opened their practice session last
Monday on the Menlo J.C. gridiron.
The first days of practice are being
; devoted to the limbering up of idle
muscles and running through some
of the plays that Coach "Buck"
Shaw has dreamed up during the
months of football idleness. First
contact work is slated for the end
of this week or the first part of next
week.
The local pro outfit will be with
out the services of two of its star
backs of last year, witli the an
nouncement that Kenny Casanega,
the defensive wizard, and Dick
Renfro, who so ably filled in for
Norm Standlee, will not be back.
Casanega has gone in for coaching
and Renfro's knee, injured in mid
season last year, has not healed
properly to permit him to continue
football.
Ex-Stanford talent is once more
predominant on the squad. Tony
Calvelli has joined the team as a
center, and all - conference guard
Bruno Bandueci is once more in the
fiay. End Hank Norberg completes
the Stanford men in the forward
wall.
In the backfield, the one and only
Frankie Albert still appears to be
the people's choice at quarterback,
and Norm "Big Chief" Standlee
should hold down the fullback spot
without too much effort.
