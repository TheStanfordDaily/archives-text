# Excom Sees Moral Duties
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Summer Excom is a combination
! of policies and moral obligations.
We were seated near a huge, wal
nut-lacquered table in the meeting
room of the Union last Wednesday
night observing the proceedings of
the 15-man Excom body.
Excom. the ASSU will have you
know, has the power to recommend
a change of the entire ASSU Con
j stitution if need be, and the author
i ity given Excom in regard to stu
! dent activities is of an almost su
i
j preme nature.
The organization, for example.
J can spend "thousands of dollars"
! beyond the moral limit set up by
J last quarter's Excom. But obliga
j tions are obligations, hence the
I strict moral line established by
I summer Excom.
NO RADICAL MOVES
'"Swell group of workers you
| have," we said to Harris.
Harris smiled: "Yes. they're a fine
group."
We questioned him on policy and
were given the same answer ren
| dered earlier this quarter pertaining
! to ASSU changs.
"It is not our policy or duty to
| institute radical changes," he said.
{ adding he was carrying out the es
| tablished program of ASSU Presi
dent-elect Tom Martzloff.
Chief among Excom's delegated
1 authorities are granting of dates for
student events, regulation of stu
dent organizations, enacting of by
laws, and the general dissemination
of information affecting the student
j body.
