If your tummy feels all funny,
If your head is splitting wide;
If your eyes arc getting glassy,
And you tremble all inside;
If your temples beat like tom-toms.
If your ears hear shrieking sounds;
Let Longbarn diagnose your ail
ment . . .
You're probably hungry!

There was a young man from
Utopia
What sat ncckst his girl on a

When he tried liberties,
She said, "If you please!
We are not married yet, sir-
Udopia!"

Are you and hubby on the outs?
Well cheer us, dear, and have no

We know a way!
To make you gay!
It isn't Lifebuoy that cures 6.0.
It isn't Dux that makes clothes
aglow.
