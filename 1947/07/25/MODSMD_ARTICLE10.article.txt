# Excom Studies Hashing Survey
## 
### 
The National Students' Organization's hashing survey and
report was presented to Excom Wednesday night by Frank
Creede. The report, Creede said, concluded that the hashing
situation was generally satisfactory, with certain exceptions.
One of the principal exceptions, according to the survey, was

• the favoritism shown in hiring
hashers for the women's Row
houses, without regard to need.
Creede explained that, as a result
of the survey, the hiring was now
being done through the Appoint
ment Service, which was making
every effort to see that hashing po
sitions went to those who needed
them.
DISCREPANCY NOTED
The survey found that women
hashers were required to pay in
advance for their board, and then
given a credit for the two meals a
day at which they worked; the re
sult of this system was that the
girls were paying $63 a quarter for
their breakfasts only. Creede stated
that nothing had been done to cor
rect this discrimination as yet, and
was asked by ASSU President A 1
Harris to consult Alf Brandin, Uni
versity business manager, on the
matter.
Excom approved a recommenda
tion to next year's Executive Com
mittee that NSO be requested to
continue its survey, with particu
lar reference to establishing equi
table standards of need, to the pos
sibility of organizing hashers' rep
resentative committees, to revising
and improving application forms,
and to the establishment of a central
office for hiring University - em
ployed hashers.
ALLOTMENT VOTED
Social policy, student government
problems, appointments, and budg
ets were some of the business be
fore the ASSU Executive Commit
tee at its regular meeting.
After a report from social com
mittee member Marky Cleek on the
ASSU jolly-up planned for Aug. 2,
a budget and appropriation of $45
was voted. President A 1 Harris con
cluded discussion by stating he
thought Excom should vote what
ever money was necessary to make
it a good party. Harris said that ha
would take the responsibility with
next year's officers for the appro
priation.
Phil Chandler, chairman of Men's
Council, reported to Excom that
one of the Council members ap
pointed for the summer had not
registered, and a replacement would
