# Library Plans Better Lights For Autumn
## 
### 
Stanford students may have bet
ter lighting in the reserve book
room of the main library fall quar
ter. A new lighting system is now
being studied by a consulting engi
neer and may be put into operation
before October, Elridge Spencer,
University Director of Planning,
said yesterday.
"Nothing is in sight yet for the
main reading room," Spencer de
clared. "but a continuing study of
the problem is being made. There
are many difficult and complex
problems to be solved before the
lighting can be brought up to a de
sirable standard."
Spencer, who has just returned
from a tour of 12 Eastern universi
ties, stated that all of them have
lighting as bad or worse than Stan
ford's. "There is no final answer yet
for lighting as such," he declared.
"If we attempted to bring the read
ing room lights closer to the tables,
we would be confronted with
many more heating, ventilation, and
acoustical problems."
One method adopted by Cornell
University is to place individual
lamps on the tables. However, this
is not completely satisfactory, he
said.
Spencer stated that the new light
ing system in the Reserve Book
Room should bring the illumination
up to standard.
