## Let There Be Light 
### 
This volume of The Stanford Daily is not an ordinary volume.
Its editorial writers are different; that is, we are not always
unhappy about the state of the world in general or Stanford in
particular. In fact, we are sometimes even pleased in reading
some news stories that pass over our desk.
Such a story is the item today in which the University's
Director of Planning, Eldridge Spencer, states that we may have
adequate lights in one section of the library at least come fall
quarter.
More than once in the dim, dark period before the war, The
Daily came out with editorials asking for better library lights.
Since that time hundreds of libe habitues have passed on to
giaduation and seeing-eye dogs, never believing a time would
come when type smaller than newspaper headlines could be
read in the depths of the main reading room.
Committees, sub-committees, consulting engineers, commis
sions, sub-commissions, Mazda moguls—all have investigated
the libe light situation and come to one conclusion. The lights
hnve not been all they might be. Yet, throughout the years,
nothing concrete has been done.
Mr. Spencer says he thinks the new lights will be installed
by the beginning of next quarter. We're sorry that one perennial
source of editorial gripes will be removed. But, nevertheless,
cur happiness at the change surpasses our sorrow. For at last
the power of the (Stanford Daily) press has borne fruit—a pre
war editorial may bring new lights in 1947.
