## Bull Session 
### 
Well, I've gone and got myself on the AVC's mailing list and I guess I'm
in for it now. The first thing the Stanford Chapter wants me to do is
turn up at the beer affair they're throwing at three this afternoon (Ros-

sotti's, the cute little invitation says), but I've got some
thing else on and I'll have to make it another time.
You go, though. Everybody's on the free list, the
way I hear it, and if you're a veteran you really ought
to got out there because his will be your chance to see
the Stanford Chapter in eruption without running the
risk of being crushed to death in a room positively vol
canic with words. That's the way it is at their regular
meetings. If you like the sound of AVC, and I think it's
the only veterans' organization worth your ear, the
party at Rossotti's probably won't give you otalgia, but
stay away from those meetings. The one they had last
week lasted three and a half hours by my count and

they were still bawling away when I slipped out a side door.
I don't know if loquacity is an ailment of undergraduates or n doctrine
of moderate liberalism (the faith the Stanford Chapter claims), but if two
of the nine members who were present last week keep talking at the
same .speed, the AVC isn't going to have a chance at this college. The
way they carry on is enough to scare off any prospect. The remedy for
this is not more beer and pretzels but less jawbone. They can also get
along with less meetings, and if the two fire-eaters who had themselves a
garrulous time last week want to keep it up on a regular schedule they can
go hire their own pagoda.
I'm all for the American Veterans Committee. They've got the right
idea, no matter how the Stanford Chapter kicks it around (they say they're
doing it in the middle of the road, and that's probably fatal—they'll get run
over lx)th ways), and if you want to join a vets' outfit, AVC is certainly
one. I just wonder if you'll like the chapter at Stanford.
At any rate, the AVC is in better shape than it's been in months. At
the June convention in Milwaukee the Communists got a sound licking,
which they've had coming for a long time, although two of Stanford's
delegates reported endlessly that they were horrified because the Com
munists were poisoned with their own medicine. This, they whispered, was
machine politics, and goodness me. These two delegates sold the Stanford
Chapter on a program of really laying for the next convention by hooking
up with an independent group within AVC that is neither "right" nor
"left." This way, they advised without blinking, they can play politics
with both sides.
I don't know what you can do about these monkeyshines, and I don't
know if you can ever stop these two boys from talking, but you can go
draw a beer this afternoon and look the setup over. If you don't like
what you see, there's a chapter in Palo Alto I hear makes a lot more sense.

which they've had coming for a long time, although two of Stanford's
delegates reported endlessly that they were horrified because the Com
munists were poisoned with their own medicine. This, they whispered, was
machine politics, and goodness me. These two delegates sold the Stanford
Chapter on a program of really laying for the next convention by hooking
up with an independent group within AVC that is neither "right" nor
"left." This way, they advised without blinking, they can play politics
with both sides.
I don't know what you can do about these monkeyshines, and I don't
know if you can ever stop these two boys from talking, but you can go
draw a beer this afternoon and look the setup over. If you don't like
what you see, there's a chapter in Palo Alto I hear makes a lot more sense.

Well, I've gone and got myself on the AVC's mailing list and I guess I'm
in for it now. The first thing the Stanford Chapter wants me to do is
turn up at the beer affair they're throwing at three this afternoon (Ros-

sotti's, the cute little invitation says), but I've got some
thing else on and I'll have to make it another time.
You go, though. Everybody's on the free list, the
way I hear it, and if you're a veteran you really ought
to got out there because his will be your chance to see
the Stanford Chapter in eruption without running the
risk of being crushed to death in a room positively vol
canic with words. That's the way it is at their regular
meetings. If you like the sound of AVC, and I think it's
the only veterans' organization worth your ear, the
party at Rossotti's probably won't give you otalgia, but
stay away from those meetings. The one they had last
week lasted three and a half hours by my count and

they were still bawling away when I slipped out a side door.
I don't know if loquacity is an ailment of undergraduates or n doctrine
of moderate liberalism (the faith the Stanford Chapter claims), but if two
of the nine members who were present last week keep talking at the
same .speed, the AVC isn't going to have a chance at this college. The
way they carry on is enough to scare off any prospect. The remedy for
this is not more beer and pretzels but less jawbone. They can also get
along with less meetings, and if the two fire-eaters who had themselves a
garrulous time last week want to keep it up on a regular schedule they can
go hire their own pagoda.
I'm all for the American Veterans Committee. They've got the right
idea, no matter how the Stanford Chapter kicks it around (they say they're
doing it in the middle of the road, and that's probably fatal—they'll get run
over lx)th ways), and if you want to join a vets' outfit, AVC is certainly
one. I just wonder if you'll like the chapter at Stanford.
At any rate, the AVC is in better shape than it's been in months. At
the June convention in Milwaukee the Communists got a sound licking,
which they've had coming for a long time, although two of Stanford's
delegates reported endlessly that they were horrified because the Com
munists were poisoned with their own medicine. This, they whispered, was
machine politics, and goodness me. These two delegates sold the Stanford
