# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I was completely incensed by Mr.
Jourdin's assertion that racial dis
crimination is practiced at Stanford.
His letter indicates a lack of the
basic ability to analyze facts and a
dearth of experience with Stanford
life.
He completely omitted from con
sideration the unfortunate but true
facts concerning the low educational
and economic status of the average
Negro which excludes most of them
from Stanford. Also we must real
ize that the vast majority of Stan
ford students are from the Western
or Northern states.
Since the white population of the
South is not adequately represented
in the Stanford Family, by what
stretch of the imagination can the
great Negro population of the South
ern states be expected to be repre
sented? We must remember that
the cost of a Stanford education is
high, and the scholastic require
ments are rigid.
Wo have all heard the story of
the boy who cried wolf. Before any
one cries "racial discrimination" he
should examine the facts and be
certain that his accusations are log
ical and correct. The defenders of
racial equality who cry wolf too
often damage the very ideal they
are trying to promote.
The application blank for Stan-
Cord asks for NATIONALITY rather
than RACE. In the future let us
think and consider the facts before
we shout "I accuse."

: The Editor, Sir:
I was grossly in error when, in
my letter to you concerning the
Carskadon editorial, I stated that
the University asked the applicant's
race on its application blank. I have
just been to the Registrar's office
and have seen that there is no such
question on the present application
j blank, and the Registrar's office said
that there had been no such ques
tion on the application blank at the
time I matriculated in the Univer
l sity.
I am satisfied that the University
| practices no racial discrimination
i whatsoever in its student-admission
; policy, and I sincerely hope that my
erroneous assumption has done no
harm.

The Editor, Sir:
We noted with interest your edi
torial column concerning the lack
of space in The Stanford Daily. July
21. 1947. Is it not inconsistent to
immediately follow your pertinent
editorial with an article of meaning
loss tripe, namely Bud Arnold's Bull
Session?
We would like to inquire whether

or not he owns the space allotted to
Bull Session, or if you are required
to publish his views; for if not, we
cannot condone any such wastage of
space when intelligent articles of
value to the students could be in
cluded.
We fail to see any message, any
sense, any humor, any moral, or
anything of readable interest in any
of Mr. Arnold's columns in The
Daily; note especially his article of
July 21 on the "Stanford Rough."
We hereby wish to register our
protest against this insult to our in
telligence. We are willing to forego
the tradition of reading the Bull
Session in favor of articles of a ma
ture viewpoint.
