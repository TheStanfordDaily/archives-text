## 
### 
Another Encina-represented out
fit took a beating in the Intramural
Softball League Wednesday, when
the Encina 4E boys were knocked
off by Kappa Alpha 10 to 6. Errors
proved to be the downfall of Enema,
as they committed 15 miscues dur
ing the eight-inning contest. Kappa
Alpha managed to garner eight hits,
while the losers were connecting for
five.
Yesterday afternoon, the Kappa
Alpha squad came through with
their second straight victory by
dumping Phi Delta Phi 8 to 3. The
winners got a total of eight hits
while the.losers were collecting but
two. Kappa Alpha committed one
error, while the Phi Delta Phi boys
kicked six chances around.
Phi Delta Theta failed to make it
two in a row, when they lost to Phi
Psi 4 to 3. The match was strictly a
pitchers' duel, with Stevenson of the
victors allowing only three bingles,
while Tritt of the vanquished gave
up seven. Barnes doubled in the
seventh to break a tie by driving in
the winning run.
