# IIR Wins Praise Abroad; Initial SIRO Drive Ends
## 
### 
With the initial drive for clothing
now past, Stanford's International
Relief Organization has started the
task of sorting and packaging all
collected items, Marky Cleek and
Cliff Forster, co - chairmen, an
nounced yesterday. Bundles will
be mailed to Europe and Asia.
''The drive netted articles of
clothing for about 40 or 50 bun
dles," said Ed Wells, SIRO com
mitteeman.
THREE HOUSES LEAD
Large donations were received
from Hilltop House, Village 124, and
Sigma Chi, he said. Some of the
items were left by students last
quarter when they found their
homeward-bound suitcases already
full.
Sorters started work Inst week,
said Forster, with Lagunita fur
nishing the most volunteers. Inter
ested workers should report to the
SIRO shack at 3 this afternoon, he
said. Headquarters are located by
Encina Commons, in back of the
Library and near the Encina dining
hall.
DONATIONS APPRECIATED
"The quality of the donations was
very satisfying," said Forster, "and
we appreciate the help given us by
all who contributed."
From the description columns in
the SIRO file of names, the organi
zation is able to determine suitable
contents for each bundle, he said.
The drive is continuous and do
nations will be gratefully accepted
at any time, said Miss Cleek. SIRO
containers will remain in the lob
bies of Encina and Lagunita, and by
the Union Snack Bar.
Student helpers will be welcome
any day, the chairman emphasized.

Stanford's international activities
are becoming known and appreci
ated abroad, it was revealed last
week in letters from France and
Germany read to the Institute of
International Relations by Bob
Hoyt, International Survey Com
mittee chairman.
From Germany came the report
that "all Germans, especially stu
dents. are interested in correspond
ing with American students." Stan
ford activities were discovered
through contact made by the Farm's
j International Information Commit
| tee with the British Zone headquar
! vers.
FRENCH STUDENT ENTHUSIAST
The French correspondent ex
; pressed enthusiasm over the ISC
i trips being made by Lawrence
Grannis and Bill Farrer, and vol
| unteered his service to the men
while they are in his country.
"It is encouraging to know that
things we are doing are known
abroad," said Hpyt.
Among reports made at the lIR
meeting, Lloyd Hall, co-chairman
of the College Congress, reported
headway being made by his plan
ning committee for the conference
of 40 West Coast colleges to be held
here next fall.
VACANCIES EXIST
The planning committee meets
every Saturday morning at 10 in
the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse, Hall said. There are
still vacancies, he said, "so there is
still a chance for interested students
to take part in the project."
