## Bull Session 
### 
Memorandum to Frank Creede: Regarding your letter of last Friday,
I'm wondering if you would have been as "completely incensed" if Mr.
Jourdin's assertions had been true. Mr. Jourdin may have been wrong,
but he was wrong for the right reasons, and your getting "completely
incensed" makes me question your scale of values. But I'll have to hand
it to you: your implied "My Campus—Right or Wrong" is a sure way to
political success around here.
As for the costs of a Stanford education, there is the GI Bill of Rights,
ind there are also plenty of boys who work their way through. In your
smug, thick-skinned letter, you intimate that Negroes live only in the
South; that all Negroes arc poorly educated; that few of them have brains
enough to get into Stanford. Whether Stanford openly discriminates or
not, the fact that so few Negroes attend this school seems an indication
that there is a pungent fish in the barrel somewhere.
Memorandum to Willis Jourdin. Jr.: Maybe your facts were a little
nixed up, but you were on the right track.
Memorandum to All Letter-Writers: The editor of The Daily will not
publish unsigned letters. I agree with him here, because, after all, the
anonymous opinion is as meaningless as a graffito on the lavatory wall.
The anonymous letter may make us burn or glow, smile or cry, but it
won't have any influence on readers, and what's opinion for if it's not to
be spread around? Another thing: it isn't very provoking to climax a
complaint with "I won't bother to read the Daily again."
Memorandum to Pave Egan. Columnist of the Boston Daily Record:
Thank you for your unintentional substantiation of this column's opinion
of Casey Stengel. In your column of July 25, you said: "In this town . . .
it took a full-dress campaign over a period of several years to eliminate
the PATHETIC PERFESSER STENGEL (caps mine)." I see where you
think the Red Sox are bad, but you should whip out to the West Coast
and see some really lnused-up outfits. They call Ibis a Triple-A league,
but it's only Triple-Sec and Double-Take. And don't worry about Joe
Cronin, because he could always a fine job out here.
Memorandum to (lie Stanford Players: I suggest—constructively, I as
sure you—that perhaps you could try a musical comedy sometime. I don't
see why the Spring Show has to be the only song-and-dance act. How
about a stab at "Of Thee I Sing," "Pal Joey," or "Leave It to Me"? Maybe
nobody around here can hold a note or carry a tunc, but it might be re
freshing after overworked Ibsen, overplayed Shakespeare, and overrated
\nderson.
Memorandum to Mr. Kndsley: While you're crusading for library lights,
you might add that the men's dormitories could use a few more watts, too.
In Toyon. for instance, it's not a matter of circuits and wires; it's just the
r\aiter of putting light-globes in empty sockets.

Cronin, because he could always a fine job out here.
Memorandum to (lie Stanford Players: I suggest—constructively, I as
sure you—that perhaps you could try a musical comedy sometime. I don't
see why the Spring Show has to be the only song-and-dance act. How
about a stab at "Of Thee I Sing," "Pal Joey," or "Leave It to Me"? Maybe
nobody around here can hold a note or carry a tunc, but it might be re
freshing after overworked Ibsen, overplayed Shakespeare, and overrated
\nderson.
Memorandum to Mr. Kndsley: While you're crusading for library lights,
you might add that the men's dormitories could use a few more watts, too.
In Toyon. for instance, it's not a matter of circuits and wires; it's just the
r\aiter of putting light-globes in empty sockets.
Memorandum to Frank Creede: Regarding your letter of last Friday,
I'm wondering if you would have been as "completely incensed" if Mr.
Jourdin's assertions had been true. Mr. Jourdin may have been wrong,
but he was wrong for the right reasons, and your getting "completely
incensed" makes me question your scale of values. But I'll have to hand
it to you: your implied "My Campus—Right or Wrong" is a sure way to
political success around here.
As for the costs of a Stanford education, there is the GI Bill of Rights,
ind there are also plenty of boys who work their way through. In your
smug, thick-skinned letter, you intimate that Negroes live only in the
South; that all Negroes arc poorly educated; that few of them have brains
enough to get into Stanford. Whether Stanford openly discriminates or
not, the fact that so few Negroes attend this school seems an indication
that there is a pungent fish in the barrel somewhere.
Memorandum to Willis Jourdin. Jr.: Maybe your facts were a little
nixed up, but you were on the right track.
Memorandum to All Letter-Writers: The editor of The Daily will not
publish unsigned letters. I agree with him here, because, after all, the
anonymous opinion is as meaningless as a graffito on the lavatory wall.
The anonymous letter may make us burn or glow, smile or cry, but it
won't have any influence on readers, and what's opinion for if it's not to
be spread around? Another thing: it isn't very provoking to climax a
complaint with "I won't bother to read the Daily again."
Memorandum to Pave Egan. Columnist of the Boston Daily Record:
Thank you for your unintentional substantiation of this column's opinion
of Casey Stengel. In your column of July 25, you said: "In this town . . .
it took a full-dress campaign over a period of several years to eliminate
the PATHETIC PERFESSER STENGEL (caps mine)." I see where you
think the Red Sox are bad, but you should whip out to the West Coast
and see some really lnused-up outfits. They call Ibis a Triple-A league,
but it's only Triple-Sec and Double-Take. And don't worry about Joe
Cronin, because he could always a fine job out here.
