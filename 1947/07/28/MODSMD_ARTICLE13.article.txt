At present, an ordinary citizen
can enter the United States Foreign
Service and be amply rewarded
with prestige and salary.
This was the statement of Armin
Rappaport, speaking before the In
ternational Club at the Stanford
Village Clubhouse last night.
Rappaport gave a brief sketch of
the history of the State Department
and of the diplomatic service of the
United Slates from (he administra
tion of Washington to the present.
Until 1370, the Secretary of State
and his assistants handled all diplo
matic contacts, said Rappaport. Af
ter that, the State Department be
gan to expand; and before World
War 11. it was composed of thou
sands of persons, with a budget of
$50 million.
In 1924, the Foreign Sei-vice was
reorganized. The present set-up was
adopted, under which examinations
are held.
Rappaport served in the South
Pacific during World War II as a
member of the counter-intelligence
corps.
