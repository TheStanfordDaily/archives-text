# Smith Retains Farm Golf Crown
## Defeats Sandy Tatum in Finals 
### WAYNE DAHLGREN 
Leading all the way during
the afternoon round of yester
day's 36-hole final to the Stan
ford Invitational Golf Tourna
ment, Tal Smith retained the
I championship won last year by
defeating Sandy Tatum 3 and 2.
Tatum entered the finals as a re
! suit of Saturday's close one-up vic
tory over Morgan Fottrell. Smith
ran away in his semi-final match
I with Cy Pennell, shooting birdies
almost at will and ending with a
5 and 4 victory.
Sunday's final match proved much
tougher, for Smith as both he and
Tatum had trouble making their
putters and drivers behave during
the first nine of the morning round.
Tatum was two down after the
ninth hole and Smith appeared to
have the match under control. With
the pressure on, Tatum then bird
ied the 11th and 16th holes to tie
up the match at the end of the
first 18.
Tatum then started the afternoon
round with a beautiful display of
j golfing by birdieing the first two
j holes. On the second he made the
best shot of the day by sinking a
60-foot chip shot. But from then on
| the match was all Smith's.
Playing steady but unspectacular
| golf, he paired every hole from the
fourth to the eleventh. At this point
he was 3 up as Tatum seemed to

I fade under pressure and twice
| missed short three-foot putts.
Tatum rallied a bit to take the
i 12th and 13th holes as Smith's ball
I seemed to take a liking to sand
| traps, but with the pressure on
| Smith again resumed command and
ended the match on the 16th green.
A large gallery of over 150
watched as the tension and the
steady shotmaking of an experi
enced competitor proved too much
for the younger Tatum. However the
match ended on a cheerful note as
Smith wished Tatum luck in next
year's British amateur golf tourna
ment. Rhodes scholar Tatum will be
spending next year at Oxford and
has expressed desires to enter Brit
ish amateur competition.

Leading all the way during
the afternoon round of yester
day's 36-hole final to the Stan
ford Invitational Golf Tourna
ment, Tal Smith retained the
I championship won last year by
defeating Sandy Tatum 3 and 2.
Tatum entered the finals as a re
! suit of Saturday's close one-up vic
tory over Morgan Fottrell. Smith
ran away in his semi-final match
I with Cy Pennell, shooting birdies
almost at will and ending with a
5 and 4 victory.
Sunday's final match proved much
tougher, for Smith as both he and
Tatum had trouble making their
putters and drivers behave during
the first nine of the morning round.
Tatum was two down after the
ninth hole and Smith appeared to
have the match under control. With
the pressure on, Tatum then bird
ied the 11th and 16th holes to tie
up the match at the end of the
first 18.
Tatum then started the afternoon
round with a beautiful display of
j golfing by birdieing the first two
j holes. On the second he made the
best shot of the day by sinking a
60-foot chip shot. But from then on
| the match was all Smith's.
Playing steady but unspectacular
| golf, he paired every hole from the
fourth to the eleventh. At this point
he was 3 up as Tatum seemed to

I fade under pressure and twice
| missed short three-foot putts.
Tatum rallied a bit to take the
i 12th and 13th holes as Smith's ball
