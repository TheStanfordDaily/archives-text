# Village Food Mart Open; Some Grow Their Own
## 
### FRANK SARLES 
"I think the Village grocery is
great. It's as handy as the neigh
borhood store, but the prices are
better than those of a chain store.
For those of us who don't have cars,
it's a real lifesaver."
This was the enthusiastic verdict
of Mrs. Ross Eady, wife of a psy
chology major and mother of a ten
months-old boy, on the opening of
the Village grocery last Tuesday.
Present services include, besides
the grocery store, the following:
A meat market, supplied from the
University commissary; a laundry
and dry - cleaning establishment,
which gives approximately one
week service; a barber shop; a Vil
lage branch of Roos Brothers' cloth
ing store; a soda fountain and snack
bar; a post office; a self-service
laundry; the Village Store, in which
one may buy anything from maga
zines to automobile tires; a bowling
alley; ice and milk delivery. In ad
dition, police protection is provided
by the University force, and the
Village is served by the Menlo Park
fire department.
Fall quarter, there will be a play
school and elementary grades for
the children of residents.
About 50 residents have availed
themselves of land offered for their
use by Village officials to grow their
own vegetables. The small plots are
sufficient to supply the green re
quirements of married couples, and
it represents a great saving in gro
cery bills. Some of the crops raised
by these amateur farmers would do
credit to them in a county fair com
petition. The corn is awe-inspiring.
'"It is rather unusual that the
Farm must give precedence to the
Village in the matter of food pro
duction," remarked Village Coun
selor Herbert Wunderlich.
