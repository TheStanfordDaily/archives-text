# Official Calls UNESCO 'Dynamic Aid to Peace'
## 
### 
The hope of UNESCO to aid world peace lies in its dynamic
appeal to the mind and spirit of men, Dr. Waldo G. Leland de
clared here Friday at a ceremony honoring the late Dr. Grayson
N. Kefauver, former dean of the Stanford school of education.
Dr. Leland is vice-chairman of the United States National Com-

mission for the United Nations Edu
cational, Scicntific, and Cultural
Organization.
He said that Dr. Kcfauver "died
in action" while playing a contin
uing leading role in establishment
of the Liaison Committee for In
ternational Education out of which
UNESCO eventually grew.
DYNAMIC APPEAL
"It is abundantly clear that if
UNESCO is indeed to construct the
defenses of peace in the minds of
men. its appeal must be more than
intellectual; it must be a dynamic
appeal addressed not to men's fears
but to their intellectual aspirations,%
he stated.
The fate of UNESCO, he said, is
tied to that of the United Nations,
although UNESCO, with 30 member
countries, is an independent inter
national body.
NATIONAL COMMISSION
Responsibility for carrying out
the program of UNESCO in the
United States rests on a national
commission established by Con
gress. It is composed of 100 mem
bers.
Chairman of the commission is
Milton Eisenhower, president of
Kansas State College and brother of
General Dwight Eisenhower.
The first task of the commission,
Dr. Leland explained, is to assure
the full co-operation of this coun
try in carrying out the UNESCO
program.
COMMITTEE ON PROGRAM
For this purpose a committee on
program has been assigned which
advises the Department of State on
the American organizations or indi
viduals best qualified to take part
in various projects or to assume re
sponsibility for them.
One of the most important func
tions of the national commission,
according to Dr. Leland, will be the
enlisting of popular support for
UNESCO aims and works. This ob
jective will be stimulated through
periodic national conferences to
which all organizations interested in
the program will be invited.
