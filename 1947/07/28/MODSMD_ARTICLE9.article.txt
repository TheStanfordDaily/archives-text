## Vote-Bait for '48 
### 
Effective September 1, the holders of terminal-leave bonds
can take them to their local bank and cash them. But they don't
have to, and would be well-advised not to do so. No one can
deny that the forecast for the immediate future is something less
than fair and warmerâ€”and 2/ 2 per cent is better interest than
the savings banks are paying.
Leaving the subject of terminal leave bonds with that admoni
tion, we would like to discuss two aspects of the political man
euvering that veterans' benefits are used for. One, bluntly, is
to buy GI votes; the other is to use veterans' measures to em
barrass opponents. This bill was not passed because of any deep
seated desire to honor the just claims of those of us who were
once enlisted men. The Republicans needed something in the
record they are trying to build up for 1948 to catch the attention
and support of the veteran. They saw a chance to catch Truman
between the devil of displeasing the veteran and particularly of
displeasing certain organized veterans' groups, and the deep
blue sea of a national economic situation already dangerously
inflationary. In spite of the GOP demand for economy, they
voted to spend the money. In spite of Truman's continuing
demand for anti-inflationary measures, he approved the bill.
This, we may say, is not the first time that the President's pre
sumably good intentions have evaporated in the heat of practical
politics.
An example which, if not more glaring, is certainly closer to
heme, was the Taft-sponsored action of the Senate in authorizing
increased subsistence pay under the GI bill. The measure was
passed, intentionally, we believe, too late in the session for the
House to take any action on it, but Sen. Taft was able to get into
the Congressional Record and the newspapers as mouthing all
kinds of sweet nothings aimed at catching a little veteran support
for what he fondly hopes will be his race for the Presidency in
'48.
