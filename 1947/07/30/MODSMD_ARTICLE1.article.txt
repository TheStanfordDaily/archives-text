# Paly Democrats Wrangle Over Henry Wallace
## 
### 
"Local enthusiasm was so over
whelming for Wallace that nothing
could keep the Democratic Club
from endorsing him," said Dr. Vic
tor E. Hall, professor of physiology
and chairman of the Palo Alto
Democratic Club meeting last week.
Members voted 71 to 11 to support
Wallace for President in 1948.
Immediately after the meeting,
Theodore J. Kreps, professor of
business economics, announced that
a new Democratic Club composed
of the members who opposed the
Wallace proposal had been organ
ized on the spot.
'OPINION NOT PECULIAR'
''This difference of opinion is not
peculiar to the Palo Alto Demo
cratic Club," Dr. Philip W. Buck,
head of the Department of Political
Science, told a Daily reporter. "It
reflects the division of opinion in
the Democratic party that wants a
reform in the party program."
Opponents of the proposal to sup
port Wallace objected to the vote
for support of Wallace because over
85 members in good standing were
not present, and because they con
sidered it a definite move toward
forming a third party, Professor
Kreps said.
TRUMAN HAILED
Robert Peckham, a Palo Alto
member of the State Democratic
Central Committee, announced yes
terday that the committee had
hailed President Truman for his
handling of national and world af
fairs.
According to Dr. Hall, the split
in the Democratic Club is strictly a
Democratic party affair. He said
although the club considers Wallace
a better candidate than Truman,
members will go along with who
ever is nominated at the national
convention.


THEODORE J. KREPS an
nounced that a new Democratic
Club opposing Wallace for Presi
dent in 1948 was organized by
Palo Alto Democrats.


PHILIP W. BUCK said the split
of political opinion among Palo
Alto Democrats is not peculiar to
the Democratic Club.
