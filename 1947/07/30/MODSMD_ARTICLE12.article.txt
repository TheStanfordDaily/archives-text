## Do We Discriminate? 
### 
Quite a controversy was unwittingly siirred up by one of our
recent editorials in which we attacked a specific case of racial
prejudice. In some way unknown to us, the subject was
shifted to an entirely new ground: viz., whether or not the Uni
versity discriminates against Negroes in granting admissions.
As to specific charges of discrimination brought against
Stanford, we can see nothing to substantiate them. The admin
istration has clarified its policy on admissions for the information
of the uninformed, and we see no evidence to make us disbelieve
Dean Stalnaker's statement. The policy seems eminently fair.
Just take a look around you. Every day you rub elbows with
a member of some minority group—that is, a minority in the
United States. There are Indians, South Americans, Japanese,
Chinese. The only basis for any charge of discrimination lies in
the fact that few Negroes have ever attended Stanford.
We believe that is partly explained by Frank Creede's letter;
partly, but not completely. There is another factor that has not
been mentioned. In the past Stanford has gained a reputation
for not welcoming Negroes —deservedly or undeservedly; we
couldn't say.
However, the belief that Negroes are not welcome assuredly
keeps most of those who could meet the entrance requirements
from applying. But that this is not a rigid policy has been
established by the fact that Negroes have been admitted.
The thing that impresses us most is the fact that, although
there has been little agreement about what does or does not
exist, all the disputants have tacitly accepted the premise that
racial discrimination is bad. That, we think, is encouraging.
