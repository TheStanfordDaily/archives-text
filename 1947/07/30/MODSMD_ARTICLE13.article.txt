Palo Alto's most exciting cultural event since the pet parade will be
tonight's first showing of "Henry V" at the Varsity. I suppose that x as a
supreme social moment this premiere may be fairly compared to last win-

ter's grand opening of the Park Theater when all the
community was so feverish it could scarcely wait for the
big night in Menlo.
When the time came, however, and all the Peninsula
trembled, the Park opened with a hush, displaying a
hand-me-down from the Stanford Theater, and it was
found, moreover, that attendance the first night was by
exclusive invitation only and it you weren't among the
anointed you couldn't go.
As far as I know, anybody who has the cash and can
murder his way to a s?at will be welcome at the Varsity
tonight. What's more, students can negotiate an Annie
Oakley of sorts from the English Department for only

75 cents, which is about par for the latest Frod Mac Murray but really
cheap for Sir Laurence Olivier and a roadshow Technicolor talkie manu
factured in England.
However, this steal is good for certain matinees only, and if you want
to mix with the really fashionable tonight you'll have to pay out in figures
about half (he scale for a Broadway show. You might ev n n have to dress,
too. but since I haven't checked with the Varsity's arbiter elegantiae, I
can't advise you whether it's to be black or white tie.
Anyway. Palo Alto is waiting "with many a flirt and a flutter." and
the next afternoon tea you crash is going to have a lot of heavy conversa
tion about "Henry V." The town has been concerned with little else the
last ten days, and the streets and alleys are decorated with throwaways
hawking the celluloid visit of London's Old Vic. Reprints of Time's danc
ing-in-the-streets review (written more than a year ago when the movie
was first shown in New York) have been sprayed throughout the area like
insecticide, and the townspople have been esprinkled with assurancs that
genuine art is about to electrify them and they can go confidently to the
Varsity because look at what all these critics have said. The campaign
literature is even being passed around at t'nc public library and you can
get your copy without even having to take out a book.
What you ought to do is take out Shakespeare and read ''Henry V"
or you're going to be awfully lost at that movie. Olivier's production is a
fine show, and it's one you ought to see and one which will give you hope
that maybe some day the movies are going to amount to something after
all. but it's Shakespeare cut almost beyond comprehension. Everybody is
going to come home and say that the horses were wonderful and the flying
of those arrows was really something and the love scenes were certainly
slick, but after the first nighter has gone to bed and has had to face himself
in the dark, he's going to have to say, "Well, it was a fine picture and I
guess Shakespeare's as great as he's cracked up to be, but I don t know—
I'm damned if I can figure out what the whole thing was about."

too. but since I haven't checked with the Varsity's arbiter elegantiae, I
can't advise you whether it's to be black or white tie.
Anyway. Palo Alto is waiting "with many a flirt and a flutter." and
the next afternoon tea you crash is going to have a lot of heavy conversa
tion about "Henry V." The town has been concerned with little else the
last ten days, and the streets and alleys are decorated with throwaways
hawking the celluloid visit of London's Old Vic. Reprints of Time's danc
ing-in-the-streets review (written more than a year ago when the movie
was first shown in New York) have been sprayed throughout the area like
insecticide, and the townspople have been esprinkled with assurancs that
genuine art is about to electrify them and they can go confidently to the
Varsity because look at what all these critics have said. The campaign
literature is even being passed around at t'nc public library and you can
get your copy without even having to take out a book.
What you ought to do is take out Shakespeare and read ''Henry V"
or you're going to be awfully lost at that movie. Olivier's production is a
fine show, and it's one you ought to see and one which will give you hope
that maybe some day the movies are going to amount to something after
all. but it's Shakespeare cut almost beyond comprehension. Everybody is
going to come home and say that the horses were wonderful and the flying
of those arrows was really something and the love scenes were certainly
slick, but after the first nighter has gone to bed and has had to face himself
in the dark, he's going to have to say, "Well, it was a fine picture and I
guess Shakespeare's as great as he's cracked up to be, but I don t know—
I'm damned if I can figure out what the whole thing was about."

Palo Alto's most exciting cultural event since the pet parade will be
tonight's first showing of "Henry V" at the Varsity. I suppose that x as a
supreme social moment this premiere may be fairly compared to last win-

ter's grand opening of the Park Theater when all the
community was so feverish it could scarcely wait for the
big night in Menlo.
When the time came, however, and all the Peninsula
trembled, the Park opened with a hush, displaying a
hand-me-down from the Stanford Theater, and it was
found, moreover, that attendance the first night was by
exclusive invitation only and it you weren't among the
anointed you couldn't go.
As far as I know, anybody who has the cash and can
murder his way to a s?at will be welcome at the Varsity
tonight. What's more, students can negotiate an Annie
Oakley of sorts from the English Department for only

75 cents, which is about par for the latest Frod Mac Murray but really
cheap for Sir Laurence Olivier and a roadshow Technicolor talkie manu
factured in England.
However, this steal is good for certain matinees only, and if you want
to mix with the really fashionable tonight you'll have to pay out in figures
about half (he scale for a Broadway show. You might ev n n have to dress,
too. but since I haven't checked with the Varsity's arbiter elegantiae, I
can't advise you whether it's to be black or white tie.
