# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
We, the undersigned, are becom
ing warm, especially around the
neck. This is because of the reju
venation this quarter of an old
Stanford tradition that hashers in
Encina must wear shirts and ties.
We once read an editorial in The
Daily saying there were two kinds
of traditions — those that serve a
definite purpose and those that have
become very old-fashioned but are
retained by the sentimentalists.
"Ah. but ties on hashers do have
a purpose," we are told. "They are
(!) more sanitary, (2) neater, and
(3) more uniform."
(1) Does something that cinches
one up, causing profuse perspira
tion, become more sanitary than a
white "T" shirt? Will some dread 'd
pestilence come springing out at the
neck if it is not thoroughly encased?
(2 and 3) Neater and more uni
form? Has anyone noted the shirt
and tie combinations seen on the
most stylish hashers? There is ev
erything from a bow to a Windsor
on everything from repulsively loud
sport shorts to the more conserva
tive GI shirts.
Who has a large number of dress
or GI shirts that can be rotted by
perspiration? And who can afford
the constant laundering of any of
these shirts and ties? Would we be
hashing if we had money to throw
away?
We believe the delay in dressing,
dissension, and discomfort that
shirts and ties are causing at Encina
can hardly be justified by any sem
blance of sanitation, neatness, and
uniformity they might have.
Our names must remain anony
mous. We like our jobs, for the
most part, and we prefer avoiding
the growing purge list. The Army
had a name for unreasonable reg
ulations.

The Editor, Sir:
Memorandum to Dick Arnold —
In your smug effort to paint me
as a bigot, impervious to events out
side the Stanford world, you have
missed the spirit of my letter. Last
Friday's letter was intended to de
bunk erroneous facts rather than
the accusation. Actually I have the
same sneaking suspicion that some
thing is rotten in Denmark as Mr.
Jourdin and yourself, but unsub
stantiated accusations do more harm
than good.

Side-stepping the temptation to
remove certain tin gods on campus
from their oracular thrones, I will
stick to the point. I was "incensed"
over fallacious logic and reasoning,
not by the charge of racial discrim
ination. If you will remember, I
did not state that there was no ra
cial discrimination at Stanford. The
conviction of zealots is not sufficient
to level such a chargo.
"My Campus—Right or Wrong"?
I have often been the iconoclast
who has found this campus wrong
as well as right. Success in politics
can best be gained by avoiding con
troversial issues and by being a
standpatter. You have read the
wrong things between the lines. Mr.
Arnold. Your inferences were not
my implications.
