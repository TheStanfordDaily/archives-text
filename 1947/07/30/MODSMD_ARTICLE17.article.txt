Jack Kramer still agrees he
caught Torn Brown on "Tom's off
day" to win the recent Wimbledon
men's singles title. The dynamic
Kramer will be defending his U.S.

singles crown late
next m onth at
the Forest Hills
Club, where one
of his roughest
obstacles on the
path of success
will be a neigh
bor from Glen
dale, namely Ted
i Schroeder, for
' mer Stanford rac
i queteer.
Yet Kramer

sticks to his story: '"I guess I was
lucky."
