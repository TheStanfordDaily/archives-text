# Grass Fire Scorches Con Home Building
## 
### 
A telephone call in broken English
from an excited Oriental brought
the Palo Alto Fire Department and
the Farm Fire Department rushing
to the Convalescent Home Monday
afternoon, said Fire Chief John M.
Marston yesterday.
The firemen found a grass fire
burning about 600 feet from the
main building of the Home. The
only damage was the scorching of
the sides of a building housing the
help, Marston said.
The fire, which started from
burning rubbish, did not threaten
the dormitory, Marston said. Fire
men extinguished the blaze in about
an hour.
