# Bradshaw Leads ATO's to Victory Over Encina 3W
## 
### 
Jack Bradshaw, striking out eight
of the first nine batters who faced
him. led the ATO team to a 20 to 4
victory over the Encina 3W team in
Monday's resumption of intramural
Softball play.
Bradshaw finished the six-inning
game with 13 strikeouts and gave
evidence that he could almost have
won the game alone by hitting
a home run, a double, and two sin
gles in four times at bat, besides
scox-ing thre runs in the process.
Yesterday's game saw a scrappy
Encina 4E team pull a mild upset by
defeating the powerful Firehouse
team, 3 to 2. The game was hard
fought and, except for a few men
tal lapses on the bases, the Encina
team played a much better game
than in their first outing.
Encina collected seven hits ofT
Willis Jourdin, the Firehouse's sub
stitute pitcher.
