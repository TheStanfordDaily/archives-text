# Farm Student Pictures College Life in French Zone of Germany

### BILL FARRER 
I find a summary of four clays at
the University of Mainz in the
French zone of Germany a most
difficult task. I feel a volume could
be written about the conditions,
needs, and opinions of the students
—so I am going to make this first
account a little sketchy.
Above all other considerations the
crying need for food stands forth.
The libraries are empty, the soles of
students' shoes are worn through,
textbooks must be mimeographed,
the smallest incidentals — shoes,
combs, notepaper, elastic —are lack
ing. But these are insignificant
when one is hungry.
MEALS BELOW STANDARD
For breakfast in the university
cafeteria we have three hard rolls
and ersatz coffee; for lunch a heavy
soup of peas, carrots, and potatoes;
and for dinner the main course—
potatoes. For this, one furnishes
one's own utensils and washes them
after the meal. To gain supple
mental items the black market is
the normal means of transaction.
The city of Mainz was 85 per cent
destroyed and the French authori
ties gave first priority to the re
building or re-establishment of a
new university (originally founded
by Napoleon) and it opened in the
summer of 1945.
Being the first American to visit
the school, I was given a free run
of the place—strictly on a student
level. My first stop was the ASTA
(Allegemeiner Studentenausschus),
the student governmental body
composed of elected representatives
from each of he six schools of the
university. With 13.000 applications

the school could only accommodate
5,000 students this year.
FRENCH REBUILT SCHOOL
The French have done a great
deal for the school in addition to its
rebuilding (the site was a barracks
constructed in 1943), and have pro
vided it with the books it does have,
furnished the quarters with bunks,
blankets, and tables, and given the
students an extra ration.
The problem of heating the quar
ters is a major one and unless the
school gets coal for the fall semes

ter, which opens in October, it will
close in December rather than Feb
ruary.
The library shelves are barren
and the books in English number
less than 50. including one diction
ary and one set of Shakespeare.
The periodicals from the States are
nil—although I did see one copy of
a June 1945 Life. There are 985
taking English literature who de
pend on this collection!
CLOTHING NEEDED
The clothing situation is not good,
and since wearing any military
clothing is forbidden the male
wardrobes are at a minimum. Bui
first on the list of clothing needs are
soles for shoes.
The average student was remark
ably well informed on such cur
rent subjects as the Marshall Plan,
United States-Russian relations, and
Allied policies in Germany, and all
were willing and eager to express
their opinions.
In discussing the American occu
pation the issue seemed to hinge on
food again. They knew and appre
ciated the fact that American troops
brought their own food and were
not living off the land as were the
Russians; but they deplored the
fact that food not used by the troops
was burned instead of being given
to the civilians.
AMERICAN CONTROL DESIRED
They wanted Germany to be giv
en an opportunity to produce; they
felt that Germany would never have
an army again—and that this could
be insured by international or
American control of the Ruhr. In
fact, there were those who hoped
that the United States would remain
forever in Germany—and some who
hoped it might eventually become
part of America.
When I asked about the "Voice of
America"the reactions were mixed,
but the majority seemed to feel the
broadcasts were too much like the
propaganda they had been bom
barded with for the past 12 years.
After all. Democracy is a rough
diet on an empty stomach.

AMERICAN CONTROL DESIRED
They wanted Germany to be giv
en an opportunity to produce; they
felt that Germany would never have
an army again—and that this could
be insured by international or
American control of the Ruhr. In
fact, there were those who hoped
that the United States would remain
forever in Germany—and some who
hoped it might eventually become
part of America.
When I asked about the "Voice of
America"the reactions were mixed,
but the majority seemed to feel the
broadcasts were too much like the
propaganda they had been bom
barded with for the past 12 years.
After all. Democracy is a rough
diet on an empty stomach.


RILL FARRER, Farm student
on tour in Europe, continues his
report from the Continent with a
dcecription of conditions at the
University of Mainz.
I find a summary of four clays at
the University of Mainz in the
French zone of Germany a most
difficult task. I feel a volume could
be written about the conditions,
needs, and opinions of the students
—so I am going to make this first
account a little sketchy.
Above all other considerations the
crying need for food stands forth.
The libraries are empty, the soles of
students' shoes are worn through,
textbooks must be mimeographed,
the smallest incidentals — shoes,
combs, notepaper, elastic —are lack
ing. But these are insignificant
when one is hungry.
MEALS BELOW STANDARD
For breakfast in the university
cafeteria we have three hard rolls
and ersatz coffee; for lunch a heavy
soup of peas, carrots, and potatoes;
and for dinner the main course—
potatoes. For this, one furnishes
one's own utensils and washes them
after the meal. To gain supple
mental items the black market is
the normal means of transaction.
The city of Mainz was 85 per cent
destroyed and the French authori
ties gave first priority to the re
building or re-establishment of a
new university (originally founded
by Napoleon) and it opened in the
summer of 1945.
Being the first American to visit
the school, I was given a free run
of the place—strictly on a student
level. My first stop was the ASTA
(Allegemeiner Studentenausschus),
the student governmental body
composed of elected representatives
from each of he six schools of the
university. With 13.000 applications

the school could only accommodate
5,000 students this year.
FRENCH REBUILT SCHOOL
The French have done a great
deal for the school in addition to its
rebuilding (the site was a barracks
constructed in 1943), and have pro
vided it with the books it does have,
furnished the quarters with bunks,
blankets, and tables, and given the
students an extra ration.
The problem of heating the quar
ters is a major one and unless the
school gets coal for the fall semes

ter, which opens in October, it will
close in December rather than Feb
ruary.
The library shelves are barren
and the books in English number
less than 50. including one diction
ary and one set of Shakespeare.
The periodicals from the States are
nil—although I did see one copy of
a June 1945 Life. There are 985
taking English literature who de
pend on this collection!
CLOTHING NEEDED
The clothing situation is not good,
and since wearing any military
clothing is forbidden the male
wardrobes are at a minimum. Bui
first on the list of clothing needs are
soles for shoes.
The average student was remark
ably well informed on such cur
rent subjects as the Marshall Plan,
United States-Russian relations, and
Allied policies in Germany, and all
were willing and eager to express
their opinions.
In discussing the American occu
pation the issue seemed to hinge on
food again. They knew and appre
ciated the fact that American troops
brought their own food and were
not living off the land as were the
Russians; but they deplored the
fact that food not used by the troops
was burned instead of being given
to the civilians.
