## 
### 
Thirty-four students in Stanford's advanced ROTC unit complete their
six weeks' summer training at three Army posts Saturday, Farm ROTC
commander Colonel Basil H. Perry disclosed.
Eleven air corps cadets at March Field, 11 field artillery and 12 quar
termaster trainees at Ft. Lewis, and one ordnance student at Aberdeen

'Proving Grounds will have only
one year advanced training at Stan
ford to complete, and will win sec
ond lieutenant commissions upon
graduation from the Farm.
PRACTICAL WORK GIVEN
"The purpose of the summer
training program," Colonel Perry
said, "is to give the men practical
work that cannot be supplied by
the universities. Aside from train
ing within their respective branch
es, the cadets receive orientation on
several useful subjects cor.dcnsed
from the other branches."
Besides receiving a five-cents
per-mile travel allowance to camp,
the students draw base pay of $75
a month in summer camp and $24
per month subsistence while in
school.
"Stanford ROTC training differs
from state colleges in that the pro
gram is entirely voluntary here.
Elsewhere, the program is compul
sory," Colonel Perry added.
ROTC OPEN TO STUDENTS
Veterans' with over 12 months'
service may enter the two-year ad
vanced course. Men with six to 12
months' service are eligible for sec
ond-year elementary ROTC. Stu
dents having under six months or
no service start with first-year ele
