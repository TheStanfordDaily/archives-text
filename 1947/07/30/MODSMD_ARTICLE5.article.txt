# The 						World in Brief: Soviet Veto and Palestine Head World News Parade
## 
### CECIL ROSPAW 
j For the 11th time in the short his
tory of the United Nations. Russia
j employed the veto privilege yester
: day to override a majority decision
of the Security Council. After a 9-2
vote (Poland was the other dis
senter) supporting the United States
motion to set up a Balkan Commis
sion to "protect national integrity"
in that part of the world. Russia's
Gromyko raised his hand to apply
the discussion-ending veto.
The Russian representative had a
! speech prepared to explain his ac
j tion. but lost the floor to Herschel
! Johnson, the United States repre
-1 sentative, who moved and got ad
! journment of the session to allow
i delegates 1o "confer with their gov
ernments."
Johnson said that this latest ac
tion was "contrary to the meaning
; of the veto as set up in San Fran
-1 cisco." and that it had "created a
: grave situation."

Heavy fighting was reported in
western Java and for the first time
Indonesian forces have thrown their
"air force" into the fray. Re
publican troops arc employing a
"scorched earth" policy and are de
stroying everything of value that is
| liable to fall into Dutch hands.
PALESTINE TENSION
Tension is growing in Jerusalem
following the execution of three
Irgun "extremist" prisoners by the
British authorities. The fate of two
British army "hostages" held by the
Irgun is as yet unknown but it is
thought that they may already have
j been killed in reprisal.
Britain's economic crisis is grow-
I ing worse. Government authorities
; voiced fears yesterday that arqaed
forces will have to be reduced in the
! face of overseas difficulties. Etig-.
! land's dwindling gold supply will
also be used until it is gone. Brit -
; ain's stock market showed a marked

slump and many leading industrials
broke rapidly.
KAISER 'SMEARED'
Henry Kaiser appeared before a
Congressional investigating com
mittee and told that group that he
felt "smeared."' He admitted White
House aid in getting a baby flat-top
contract after the Navy had refused
but said that the 100 CVP's had
been "invaluable to the prosecution
I of the war." He went on to say that
he did not know Elliott Roosevelt,
that Leahy and "Hap" Arnold had
approved of the flying boats and had
given the go-ahead, and that he had
never attended a Hughes party in
Hollywood.
The State Department announced
J that it has cut its "Voice of Amer
ica" program in three countries to
enable the proposed step-up of
beamed broadcasts to Russia. This
is due to Congressional failure to 1
appropriate the needed funds.
