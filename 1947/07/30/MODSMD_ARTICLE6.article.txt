# ASSU Planning Farm 'Jolly-up'
## 
### 
"Summer — Indian Summer."
That's the way the song goes, and
that's the theme for Saturday
night's all - campus "Jolly - up."
There'll be volleyball and bridge for
entertainment in the Women's
Clubhouse, General Chairman Nan
cy Kendall reports, and there'll be
dancing to records.
Hours for the affair, only one of
its kind to be held this summer, will
be 8:30 to 1, said Miss Kendall. She
warned that students are not ex
pected to dress up — regular Quad
clothes are recommended.
Food and refreshments—hot dogs
and cokes, in other words—will be
sold in booths operated by Earl
Gorby for Encina and Pat Painter
for Lagunita, she said.
