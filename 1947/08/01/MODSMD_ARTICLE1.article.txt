## The 						World in Brief 
### 
Following the discovery of the
remains of their two booby-trapped
comrades -in - arms, the British
Army has gone berserk in the
streets of Tel Aviv, Palestine. Ar
mored cars, mounted jeeps, and
armed patrols are roaming the
streets indiscriminately firing on
pedestrians, cars, and buses in an
unauthorized display of retaliation.
No orders have been received from
army headquarters, but at last re
ports the attacks were still contin
uing.
The Greek government tossed the
most serious complaint yet lodged
by one nation against another in the
lap of the Security Council yester
day. Gi'eek officials charged their
Balkan neighbors—Yugoslavia, Al
bania, and Bulgaria — with armed
aggression and asked for measures
of police protection under Article
Seven, which allows the UN to use
police action in case of aggression.
Yugoslavia counterattacked by ac
cusing the U.S. and Britain of en
couraging Nazi activities in Austria.
INDONESIA AT UN
Australia, backed by Russia's
Gromyko, asked that UN action be
taken on the Indonesian situation.
UN action on these two crises will
probably decide the fate of this or
ganization, in the opinion of most
experts. Dutch representatives ar
gued that the UN could not take
action on this situation because it
was just a "police" measure and
internal in nature.
A subpoena is on its way to Hol
lywood to request the appearance
of Howard Hughes before the in
vestigating committee of Senator
Ferguson. Hughes said that he would
appear next Wednesday and the
measure was not necessary. It was
revealed today that a secret clause
of the contract would allow Hughes
to keep the lease of the huge plane
until 1952.
TAFT WILL RUN
The Republican State Central
Committee said yesterday that their
candidate for the Presidency in 1948
would be Senator Robert Taft. This
release timed nicely with Taft's'ra
dio address last night which was a
bitter denunciation of the Truman
administration.
All Pan-American airports were
blacked out last night in the Do
minican Republic in anticipation of
an expected "Communist" putsch.
Seven of the eight Superforts fly
ing from Tokyo to Washington were
on schedule at Anchorage last night.
The eighth was expected to be on
time at the landing.
