## Revive the Forum 
### 
The academic year 1946-47 here at Stanford was one of the
worst in recent years as far as student-administration relations
were concerned. Students who asked for an explanation of
University policy were told in effect that it was none of their
business. Administration moves were misinterpreted by the
students and everyone from the Board of Trustees on down to the
last clerk was roundly damned for being a part of some great
conspiracy to provide a second-rate education for a first-rate
price.
Both sides were unhappy and the situation could easily have
turned into worse than a state of mutual distrust. It was in this
atmosphere that the Student-Administration Forum was launched
by Cardinals. The Forum consisted of administration officials
and student leaders, gathered informally to discuss and clarify
problems of mutual concern. Only a few meetings were held
spring quarter, but they did much to rectify the dangerous and
unnecessary situation which had previously prevailed. It was
a big step in the right direction.
Yet, what has happened to the Forum during the current quar
ter? Cardinals made no provision to continue it during the sum
mer. Probably their plans for fall quarter are chiefly concerned
with staging football rallies. If left to Cardinals, the Forum will
lie dormant until spring when there are few campus activities.
The solution lies in Excom. Either Excom should take over
the job of maintaining and arranging for the Student-Adminis
tration Forum or it should make certain it is handled by a four
quarter organization. The Forum is too valuable an institution
to be allowed to die because of lack of energy or interest on the
part of our student leaders.
