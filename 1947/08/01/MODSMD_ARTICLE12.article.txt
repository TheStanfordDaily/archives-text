## Bull Session 
### 
Just one more swing around the infield with Mr. Frank Creede, and
then I'd just as soon drop the whole thing, before it gets to the point where
he objects to my shaving every other day and I condemn his brand of beer.
I don't even know Mr. Creede. and though chances are he'd be as nice
as the next guy to kill a bottle with on a rainy night, I still wouldn't want

to have a correspondence with him, because his letters
don't make much sense.
On July 25, Mr. Creede said. "I was completely in
censed by Mr. Jourdin's assertion that racial discrimi
nation is practiced at Stanford."
This would lead one to believe that Mr. Creede could
not ever think that racial discrimination was used here.
But on July 30. he said:
"Actually, I have the same sneaking suspicion that
something is rotten in Denmark."
Of course, Mr. Creede will probably write in and
say that he literally meant Denmark and that I was
inferring incorrectly when I thought he figuratively

meant Stanford.
Now. I don't know, but to me the problem of raciaf discrimination is
more important than the problem of Mr. Jourdin's inaccuracy. Mr. Creede
can get mad and "incensed" at Mr. Jourdin and, presumably, at me, but
he doesn't get mad at all when he suspects that there is "something rotten
in Denmark." Possibly if Mr. Creede heard that 2,000.000 people were
starving in Italy, he would become incensed if he found out the figure
was only 1,350,000. Maybe Mr. Creede suspects that there is something
rotten in Denmark, but I feel like asking, "You suspect, but do you care?"
In Mr. Creede's first letter (whose implications I misjudged, he says)
there was not the slightest indication that he cared about anything but his
precious little facts. I don't expect anybody to jump up and down on a
bass drum every time he thinks of the Negro problem; but then again I
can't understand his pounding the drum with his head over an inaccuracy.
On July 30. Mr. Creede said, "Unsubstantiated accusations do more
harm than good."
Now, for a fellow who is in love with facts, Mr. Creede should at least
be faithful in his marriage to them. His statement just above may be true
in general, but it is not true in fact. For. as a result of Mr. Jourdin's un
substantiated accusation, (1) the University made clear its policy on ad
mission; (2) any Negroes who hear of this policy will be glad to know that
Stanford is playing fair and will have a correct idea of this place; (3) the
University's statement also gave some assurance to those of us who won
dered what was going on; (4) the whole incident has created much more
interest in and concern with the problems of racial discrimination. Now I.
it least, consider these things good, and I wonder if the number of harms
caused by Mr. Jourdin can equal the number of benefits in quantity and
importance.
Finally, Mr. Creede stated, on July 25."The defenders of racial equality
vho cry wolf too often damage the very ideal they are trying to promote.'
To this I say that there are so many wolves now that if someone cries
.volf. even when there's not one in sight, it's a good bet that the people
who answer the call will run across one on their way to or from the yell.
Meanwhile. I apologize to Mr. Creede for my wrong idea about his
political platform. â€¢
