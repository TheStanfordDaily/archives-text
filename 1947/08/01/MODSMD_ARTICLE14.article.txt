# Chemists Will Describe New Ammonia Field
## 
### 
Opening a four - day conference
Monday, over 40 scientists in the
field of ammonia chemistry will
meet on campus as part of the first
post - war summer conferences in
chemistry, it was announced by the
Chemistry Department.
The purpose of this year's con
ference is discussion of research
problems in ammonia chemistry.
Dr. Richard A. Ogg, who is direct
ing ammonia chemistry research at
Stanford, will act as chairman of
the meetings, the department de
clared.
Dr. Ogg is slated to report on the
progress of the research he is con
ducting on the composition of so
lutions of metals in liquid ammonia.
The conferences will also com
memorate two Stanford professors,
the late Edward C. Franklin and
Francis W. Bergstrom, both of
whom did work in the field of am
monia chemistry.
Other chemists scheduled to par
ticipate in the conference are Dr.
Charles A. Kraus, recently retired
director of the Metcalf Research
Laboratory at Brown University;
Professor Frederick C. Schmidt,
professor of chemistry at Union
College; and Don M. Yost, profes
sor of chemistry at the California
Institute of Technology.
Visitors are invited to attend the
conference sessions, which will be
