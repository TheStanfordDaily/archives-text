# Kappa Alphas Top Phi Delts For Third Win
## 
### BILL WARDEN 
Kappa Alpha continued the\r rep
utation of being the class of the
league when they won their third
straight game Wednesday by taking
Phi Delta Theta to task by the score
of (j to 2. The Kappa boys had their
big inning in the third when they
pushed four tallies across the dish,
and after that they were never
headed.
Joe Sher pitched his usual brand
of ball for the victors, and, although
he tired in the late innings, he al
ways had the situation under con
trol. Frank Parr, who hurled for
the losers, contributed a home run
to the lost cause in the late stages
of the game.
iPHI PSI WINS
At the same time on the other
end of the field, the Phi Psi outfit
was taking the Encina 3W boys into
camp by the score of 6 to 5. The
game, a six-inning affair, wasn't de
cided until the last half of the last
inning, when Phi Psi pushed across
two runs to come from behind and
sew the contest up.
Phi Delta Phi came into the win
column yesterday when they extin
guished the Firehouse by the score
of 6 to 3. The victors played a
creditable game, both at bat and in
the field. Burt Talcott, who hurled
for the winners, pitched excellent
ball for the first five innings, but
he was visibly tired the last two
frames and slowed up considerably.
Good support from the rest of the
squad, however, pulled him
through. "Frankie" Jourdin, Fire
house hurler, threw a good game,
but he did not have the hitting and
fielding support behind him that
Talcott did. Art Baxter smashed a
terrific homer to deep left field for
the losers for the day's longest hit.
ATO'S SURPRISED
In the other game played yester
day, Alpha Tau Omega went down
to defeat at the hands of Encina 4E
by the score of 15 to 8. Jack Brad
shaw started on the mound for the
victors and struck out the first six
men to face him in the first and
second innings. He was relieved at
the end of the second inning be
cause of a business affair in Palo
Alto. His substitute did not fare as
well as Mr. Bradshaw, however.
The Encinas got to him for 12 runs
in two big innings, and the ball
game was decided right then and
there. The ATO's put on a rally in
the last half of the seventh inning,
and managed to punch over six
runs on as many hits, with a few
errors by the Encina defense help
ing the cause along. It died out too
soon, though, and the game ended
with the ATO's still far behind.
In the earlier games of the week,
the ATO's literally cleaned house
on Encina 3W Monday by the score
of 20 to 4. In Tuesday's encounter.
Encina 4E upset the dopesters by
edging the Firehouse 3 to 2 in a
hotly contested game.
