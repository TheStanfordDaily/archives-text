# English Schools Are Favorable To Student Exchange Plan
## 
### LAWRENCE GRANNIS (Special to The Daily 
To begin with, I have spent at
least a day at the four universities —
London, Oxford, Cambridge, and
Edinburgh. Collectively these rep
resent every type — the equivalent
of our street-car college, the an
cient (even snooty) universities
with strong traditions going back
to the Middle Ages, and finally a
leading Scottish university.
At each, I have talked with uni
versity officials, faculty, and stu
dents (including American stu
dents) and have gathered fairly
comprehensive information on the
life there. And I have found out
on what basis each would be willing
to reciprocate with us, or other
Western universities, if we should
so desire.
Basically, it shapes up that ALL
will "probably" waive tuition and
fees (Edinburgh and London actu
ally will, I am sure) and will "make
an effort" to provide us with free
.accommodations as well. This last I
regard as doubtful.
VISITS COUNTRYSIDE
At any rate, for whatever it's
worth, I feel I've got an adequate
picture for us. I also visited a few
professional schools—Lincoln's Inn,
St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the
medical school of the University of
London.
Some people at the Ministry of
Education gave a small luncheon
here in London. (In fact, every
where the reception has been most
cordial.) They are interested very
much in any possible exchanges,
etc., we may care to embark on.
When and if we do make any defi
nite proposals along any of these
lines, I feel sure we'll get what we
want in the way of assistance and
co-operation here.
TALKING WITH PEOPLE
In addition, I have been fortunate
to spend much time just plain bull
ing with all kinds of people. I spent
an hour with Hugh Moulson, a
leading Tory M.P., getting the Tory
picture and discussing about every
possible political subject. I am go
ing to the House of Commons as his
guest tomorrow. Also, I have talked
to journalists, editors, business men,
"wharfies," and even a couple of
titled characters who I swear were
used as models for Colonel Blimp.
I went to a Communist meeting
and heard the U.S. damned up one
side and down the other —none of
which surprised or shocked me. Ev
erything that was said was a re
hash of stuff the Kremlin has been
putting out. This Marshall Plan
business has really got them mad
and it's tough to beat.
The over-all impression of Eng
land is, of course, the very genuine
crisis it is in. Food is scarcer, more
expensive, and more monotonous
than during the war. Everything
(except courtesy) is short.
