# Magazine Salesmen Checked for Fraud
## 
### 
Students who recently bought
subscriptions from magazine repre
sentatives illegally soliciting on the
campus will probably receive the
issues for which they paid, Chief of
Police Gordon Davis predicted yes
terday.
A definite checkup on the validity
of the distributing company repre
sented by these men is now in
progress, and a positive statement
as to the legality of the purchases
will be available in the next few
days, Davis said.
However, Chief Davis advised the
student body that such solicitors
are not only violating regulations
that forbid peddling at the Farm
but are actually not offering bar
gains that cannot be obtained by
subscribing directly to the maga
zine companies or at any local mag
azine agency. In addition, there is
always the risk involved that they
are fraudulent representatives as
has ocurred at Stanford in the past,
Davis said.
