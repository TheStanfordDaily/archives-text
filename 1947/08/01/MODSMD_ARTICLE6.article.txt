# Play Rates '3.2 Success'
## 
### 
The Stanford Players' production of "As You Like It" came off with a
3.2 success last evening—3 for the scenery, costumes, and music, and a
weak .2 for the players themselves.
With the exception of Bill Vorenberg, who added the look of Mephis
topheles to the melancholy Jaques, and Nancy De Groot, who flitted about
the stage as Celia, most of the cast seemed ill at ease in the most perfect
example of the English language.
Beatrice Manley exhibited more coyness than wit in her portrayal of

Rosalind. Miss Manley seems to feel
that a pained expression plus a good
deal of striding back and forth
across the stage is acting in the
Shakespearean manner.
Walker Vaughan as Orlando, the
boy wonder of the wrestling world,
started Act I, Scene I, as if he had
just enrolled in an elocution school,
but managed to warm up his ex
pression and cool down his gestures
as the play progressed.
The brightest spot in the forest of
Arden was held by Jack Taylor as
the singer Amiens who, together
with the chorus of six, managed to
liven the rather tedious woodland
scenes up a bit.
A word of credit should go to
Harold Todd for his brief role as
Silvius. the love-sick shepherd. He
managed to inject enough pathos
and comedy into his character to
make it stand out above the rant
ings and ravings of his fellow actors.
"As You Like It" will be present
ed on the stage of Memorial Audi
torium again tonight and tomorrow
night. Curtain time is 8:15. —Law-
