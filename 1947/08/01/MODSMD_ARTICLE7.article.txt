# Polio Vaccine Developed In Stanford Lab
## 
### 
The second dramatic step in the
fight against infantile paralysis has
been accomplished in Stanford lab
oratories by Dr. Hubert S. Loring,
professor of biochemistry, and his
research assistants.
A vaccination producing a high
degree of immunity against the dis
ease in rats has been developed
from the pure polio virus isolated
last year by the same group of
tireless researchers.
NEW DEVELOPMENT TOLD
The new development is de
scribed in the current issue of Sci
ence by Dr. Loring, Dr. C. E.
Schwerdt, Dr. Jane C. Anderson,
and Nancy Lawrence.
In one of the final steps of the
experiment, 24 rats immunized with
triple inoculations had virulent
virus injected into their brains.
Twenty-three of the rats showed no
resultant signs of the disease; one
developed paralysis but recovered.
Eighty-three per cent of the non
immunized animals in the test de
veloped polio.
STRONGER INOCULATION
The 24 immunized survivors of
this experiment were later given a
stronger inoculation of the dread
virus. Fifteen showed no sign of
infection, while 92 per cent of a
control group developed the dis
ease when injected with the same
amount of virus.
Dr. Loring wanted at the time of
the successful isolation of the pure
polio virus that production of a vac
cine effective in rats would be only
another step toward obtaining a
vaccine effective on human beings.
