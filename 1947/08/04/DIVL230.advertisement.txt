walk softly?
Because it can't walk, hardly.

(There was a college built of yore,
T'was called a "farm" when it
began;
And people jeered to see a farm
That really hadn't any barn.
Until two wise and kindly men
Took pity on the students' plight
And erected in its present site
I.CNCBARN, known for all its
charm.
!y everyone now on the "Farm."
