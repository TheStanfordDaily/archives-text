## The 						World in Brief 
### 
The United Nations was given a
new lease on life yesterday when
both Dutch and Indonesian forces
heeded the Security Council's
"cease-fire" order. All fighting will
cease tonight at midnight and fur
ther arbitration will be left to the
UN. The Dutch did not accept the
order with grace, still claiming that
the affair is of "internal" origin.
But the Dutch and Indonesians have
accepted the "higher" body's wishes
and UN statesmen at Lake Suc
cess were reported to be smiling for
the first time in months.
CIO and Ford officials were ne
gotiating in a locked room late last
night attempting to avert the strike
of Ford plants called for Tuesday
morning. A CIO official on leaving
the room stated that "some progress
has been made.". He seemed opti
mistic that the strike could be set
tled, but the meeting broke up later
with no settlement in sight.
PLANES STILL MISSING
An Army search through airports
in all of the Southern states has
failed to reveal any sign of the
"missing" seven combat-type ships
which were sold as war surplus. The
planes are alleged to be involved in
the "plot" to overthrow the exist
ing government in the Dominican
Republic.
A Congressional investigating
committee learned yesterday that
Howard Hughes had been awarded
a $70,000,000 contract in 1943 to
build photo-reconnaissance planes.
When no planes had been delivered
at the conclusion of the war the
government settled for $8,000,000.
Johnny Meyer, Hughes press agent,
will answer questions about his six
deferments from the draft today.
CHENNAULT PIQUED
Claire Chennault, former Flying
Tigers chief and major general in
the United States Army, issued a
statement from Shanghai yesterday
expressing his disapproval of "the
bureaucratic control of free speech"
as shown by the air forces in can
celing his speech Aug. 1. He said
that this is a danger we face in this
type of control and claimed that his
speech, which was to be piped to
air force personnel all over the
world, was of "great import."
A "trench" of dead fish, caused
by some unknown fish plague, was
reported floating northward off
shore of Clearwater, Florida. The
fish are reported to cover an area
GO miles long and 25 miles wide.
Southward from Clearwater a
trench two and a % half miles long
was needed to bury the fish washed
ashore. Vacationers were advised
to stay away.
