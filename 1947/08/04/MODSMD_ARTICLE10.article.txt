# Mexican Roads, Vegetation Hinder Tropic Wanderlust Of Daily Scribe
## 
### JIM JOSEPH (Special to The Daily 
TUXTLA GUTIERRA, Mexico.—
From here north, the airplanes and
riverboats are king.
Deep jungles lie sweltering, drip
ping in the midst of a tropical rainy
season, hiding rich chicle forests,
mahogany, and the newly discov
ered Maya ruins northeast of this
capital town of Chiapas.
We came this far for some jungle
stories—for some tales of bush pi
lots and for a crocodile hunt. Be
sides, we wanted to find out what
happened to the Pan American
Highway after it left Oaxaca, 350
miles southeast of Mexico City.
LAUDS JEEP
Two new tires and four bridge
less streams later we're able to re
port that the jeep—which we didn't
have—has its advantages at times.

And (his happens to be one of those
times!
The Pan American Highway
leaves Oaxaca with a teasing
splurge of asphalt which quickly
and decisively turns to gravel for
the next 250 miles. Road gangs
have done a wonderful job. They've
cut through high mountains to
make what will some day be the
most beautiful highway in the
world.
LACK MECHANIZATION
And they're still working hard at
it—rainy season or not —with hun
dreds of trucks and thousands of
men and much too little mechaniza
tion!
This road seems to be hand-made
from Oaxaca to the Guatemalan
border. From Oaxaca east and
south, the Pan American Highway
is washboard - rilled, grooved, and
rough. The scraper apparently came

once, did its job, and failed to re
turn.
But the road is open except for
four river fordings. Twice we were
lucky; the rivers were frazzled out
and almost waterless . . . but the
third time we nearly lost the car
as water crept up to the running
board.
A little native help and we pushed
through safely. We're hoping it
doesn't rain much more, because
there's that "return trip."
Somehow, Mexico has been pic
tured all wrong. There is drowsi
ness, yes, but a slumbering zest is
coming to life. You can see it in
progressive towns like this one.
Here are headquarters for three
jungle airlines, highway construc
tion companies, and growing jungle
industries. There are more 1947 cars
in Tuxtla than in many U.S. towns
with the same population—ls,ooo.
