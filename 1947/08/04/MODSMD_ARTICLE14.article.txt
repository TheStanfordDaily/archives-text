## Hashcom 
### 
Excom, the last couple of weeks, has been devoting consid
erable attention to hashing. After hearing and discussing the
survey made by the NSO last quarter, and after considering some
aspects of the subject that have come up this quarter, Excom has
concluded that some problems would be solved and others be
easier to solve if some sort of organization to represent Stanford's
hashers could be set up. And this will be recommended to the
regular Excom for next year.
But the hasher's committees that Excom has suggested open a
wide and tangled prospect. In the first place, these representa
tive committees must necessarily be of limited authority. Even
the shirt-and-tie-swathed hashboys in Encina concede that the
prime function of a dining hall is to feed its customers efficiently
and economically, and that this is the responsibility of the
management.
In the second place, if the hashers are to come under the wing
of the ASSU, there is no logical reason why other students
employed by the University should be left without that shelter.
Such questions as "equal pay for equal work"—illustrated
recently by the manner and amount of pay of some of the women
hashers (and not solved by the "basic University policy" bro
mide)—of employment on a basis of need, and so on, are not
restricted to students employed in dining halls. Student govern
ment will be rising to its proper stature if it takes the initiative in
assisting and protecting the self-supporting student.
