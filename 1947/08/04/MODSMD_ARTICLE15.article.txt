"You should write about something happy, Arnold. Here you are al
ways going around with a grouch and grumbling and getting people all
worked up and you know perfectly well there's plenty good about Stan
ford if you'd only say so and that's what your readers want."
"I like Stanford fine. I wouldn't even swap for Texas A. & M."
"Wait a minute now, look here, look at these letters, why, some of
these people think you're a Communist the way you're carrying on. Whal

you have to do is think of something sweet and cheery
and write about that. "How about Station KSU? Can't
you write something nice about them?"
' How can I do that? I never heard KSU except once
and it sounded like any other radio station except the
announcers had the vocal cords of a quiz kid, but I've
sol nothing against, KSU and I'm not going to bother
them. Of course, it seems to me a college radio station
has a lot of chances the commercial air can't take-and
that's what KSU ought to be doing instead of imitating
the national toothpaste systems, but I understand these
people at KSU want to learn the trade and get out
afterwards and make some money so I'm not going to

icick about that. Only I don't want to listen to their stuff any more than
any other radio noise."
"You're crazy. They do some wonderful things. This 'Stump the
Profs,' for instance, do you ever hear that?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"It's no good."
"How do you know if you never heard it?"
"You can just tell. You hear a title like that and you can tell it's no
good."
"All right, take it easy. Forget KSU. There's lots of other things.
Trouble with you. Arnold, you don't get around enough, ynu don't know
what's going on. There's lots of nice things at Stanford and if you'd only
understand the Stanford spirit and how happy and wholesome everything
here really is you'd be turning out columns the students would like. In
stead they want you thrown of! The Daily the way you've boon shooting
off your mouth about the Stanford Players and the roughs and all that.
You've never had a good word to say about anything.'
"Say. this KSU, I hear they were off the air for an hour one night
and they didn't know it and there was poor old Dan Endsley gabbing
.rtvay with the news broadcast without even the normal audience of five
>r six freshmen. They say that's the best night KSU's had yet."
"Endsley reading the news into a dead mike. That's good, all right.'
"Well, the Radio Institute is trying. They have a class writing radio
plays and the best play is going to t;et thrown on some nifjht and you
can't tell what they'll come up with there. This Endsley is in on that too,
and he's whipping up a play about a woodchuck.'
"For kiddies?"
"No, this is a parable. The woodchuck is a victim of intolerance, you
-;ee. for being a woodchuck I guess is how it goes, and I hope poor old
Endsley makes it because I'd certainly like to hear that one. He's even
vriting in sound effects for how the woodchuck talks.
'Good for Endsley. Now there you are, sec. Endsley's always happy
ind not kicking. A woodchuck, see? That's a cheerful subject.
"Here's to the woodchuck."
Here's to the woodchuck."
"Happy days."

"Happy days."

"You should write about something happy, Arnold. Here you are al
ways going around with a grouch and grumbling and getting people all
worked up and you know perfectly well there's plenty good about Stan
ford if you'd only say so and that's what your readers want."
"I like Stanford fine. I wouldn't even swap for Texas A. & M."
"Wait a minute now, look here, look at these letters, why, some of
these people think you're a Communist the way you're carrying on. Whal

you have to do is think of something sweet and cheery
and write about that. "How about Station KSU? Can't
you write something nice about them?"
' How can I do that? I never heard KSU except once
and it sounded like any other radio station except the
announcers had the vocal cords of a quiz kid, but I've
sol nothing against, KSU and I'm not going to bother
them. Of course, it seems to me a college radio station
has a lot of chances the commercial air can't take-and
that's what KSU ought to be doing instead of imitating
the national toothpaste systems, but I understand these
people at KSU want to learn the trade and get out
afterwards and make some money so I'm not going to

icick about that. Only I don't want to listen to their stuff any more than
any other radio noise."
"You're crazy. They do some wonderful things. This 'Stump the
Profs,' for instance, do you ever hear that?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"It's no good."
"How do you know if you never heard it?"
"You can just tell. You hear a title like that and you can tell it's no
good."
"All right, take it easy. Forget KSU. There's lots of other things.
Trouble with you. Arnold, you don't get around enough, ynu don't know
what's going on. There's lots of nice things at Stanford and if you'd only
understand the Stanford spirit and how happy and wholesome everything
here really is you'd be turning out columns the students would like. In
stead they want you thrown of! The Daily the way you've boon shooting
off your mouth about the Stanford Players and the roughs and all that.
You've never had a good word to say about anything.'
"Say. this KSU, I hear they were off the air for an hour one night
and they didn't know it and there was poor old Dan Endsley gabbing
.rtvay with the news broadcast without even the normal audience of five
>r six freshmen. They say that's the best night KSU's had yet."
"Endsley reading the news into a dead mike. That's good, all right.'
"Well, the Radio Institute is trying. They have a class writing radio
plays and the best play is going to t;et thrown on some nifjht and you
can't tell what they'll come up with there. This Endsley is in on that too,
and he's whipping up a play about a woodchuck.'
"For kiddies?"
"No, this is a parable. The woodchuck is a victim of intolerance, you
-;ee. for being a woodchuck I guess is how it goes, and I hope poor old
Endsley makes it because I'd certainly like to hear that one. He's even
vriting in sound effects for how the woodchuck talks.
'Good for Endsley. Now there you are, sec. Endsley's always happy
ind not kicking. A woodchuck, see? That's a cheerful subject.
