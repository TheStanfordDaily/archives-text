The Editor, Sir:
Ode to Bud Arnold, in answer to
his Bull Session of July 21, 1947:
Rant and rave, oh, little dissident.
From what cause are you so discon
tent?
Is it sticking in your craw
That you're nae sae bricht and
bra,
And your social entree comes tres
lentement?
Drofnats wear no silks and laces,
Saving them for other places.
Ignore them, lad. It's but a sham.
Modesty's not worth a damn.
Bourgeois is the word for social
graces.
Cadillacs are ostentatious;
Frats are hinted most palatious.
Write your columns dialectic,
Scorn philosophies eclectic.
Your efforts to be "gauche" remain
pugnacious.
From your soapbox to the masses,
Raise your cry of moneyed classes.
Uncle Sammy pays your time;
You must sharpen up your line,
And organize your cells before time
passes.
