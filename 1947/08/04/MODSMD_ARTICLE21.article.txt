## Sidelights 
### 
At the risk of boring those who
don't care two cents one way or the
other, we're starting off again with
the athletic award buck-passing
which has been going on this sum
mer.
Whether a few athletes have to
pay for their own awards, or not,
the whole incident still remains as
just another example of the way the
athletic department's administration
tries to cut cost corners at the ex
pense of Farm athletes in a manner
which all too often irritates.
There is no reason, for instance,
why an established minor sport
such as wrestling had to be the
black sheep of the sports family last
winter, yet it was that, simply be
cause the athletic administration
practically ignored the financially
lean sport and took the shortcut of
having Vern Jones, a student, han
dle the coaching.
WRESTLING'S WOES
Jones would be the first to tell
you that no one can study, wrestle,
and coach the grapplers and do all
three items justice, yet it was either
that,'or no wrestling team last Win
ter.
They used a hand-me-down lock
er room to practice in; they used
mats left here by the Navy; they
had one meet postponed because of
a schedule mixup on the part of the
athletic department; and in several
meets, they even had to borrow tape
from their opponents.
The Farm grapplers have been up
against it, and their record certainly
showed it. They won but one meet
all season. How much better could
they have done, under the condi
tions they wrestled under?
Consider Stanford's "shoestring"
crew, which gets no support what
ever from the Farm, officially. In
fact, according to Lou Lindsey, stu
dent crew coach, Stanford has even
turned down two donations which
were earmarked for the crew's use!
This is an attitude which doesn't
jibe with the recent growth of the
sport throughout the country (see
the July Pic for a complete survey
of the crew's recent spurt).
FARM LEERY OF CREW
It seems that smaller schools can
afford to support crew in a reason
able way, but Stanford is apparently
still blinded by the "money-bags"
atmosphere the sport used to have.
Lindsey and his crewmen have
been getting along, very skimpily,
on private contributions, and the
crewmen contend that the Univer
sity's responsibility for the sport, if
it were ever recognized by the
school as a minor sport, would con
sist primarily in paying traveling
expenses—a not outlandish propo
sition by any means. But—Stanford
doesn't seem to see it that way.
And now, comes the affair of the
letters. We wonder, what next will
the athletic administration try to
save money on?
