# Game of the Week:
## 
### 
The Pied Typers, the Daily's ex
cuse for a Softball team, take the
field (across from the Sunken Dia
mond) against the Faculty-Grads of
the History Department this after
noon at 3 p.m. in a contest of sorts
billed as an "exhibition."
The scriveners, who'll face the
Faculty - Grads without benefit of
their typewriters, are pinning their
hopes on the off-chance that the
best players of their opponents may
become lost somewhere in the li
brary shelves and not appear. Both
teams are keeping announcement of
their starting pitchers a secret.
