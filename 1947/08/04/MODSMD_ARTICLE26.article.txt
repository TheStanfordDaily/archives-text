## 
### FRANK SARLES 
Tlie wife of an Argentine student
recently became seriously ill. She
was teaching at Castilleja School in
Palo Alto while her husband at
tended Stanford under the sponsor
ship of his government. At this
critical juncture, her husband, a
graduate student in aeronautical
engineering, received orders from
his government to go to an Eastern
aircraft factory.
Meantime, the Stanford Radio
Club hastily arranged voice con
tact by short-wave radio with his

parents in Buenos Aires. The par
ents secured a delay of his orders
until his wife had recovex'ed. Two
weeks later, the girl spoke to her
mother, who startled operators at
both ends by bursting into tears.
COED TALKS TO ICELAND
Jean Kirkpatrick, a Farm coed,
recently spoke by radio to an Army
ooerator in Iceland. He was so
thrilled to hear a woman's voice
that he immediately sent an air
mail fan letter to express his ap
preciation.
After a wartime lapse, necessi
tated by government decrees, the
Radio Club was revived July 4,
194G. Its present membership is
abortt 30 ardent "hams." Officers of
the club are Rod Beaudette, presi
dent; Bill Barnhart, vice-president;
Les Roberts, secretary; and Ed Mil
ler, treasurer.
The club now has three powerful
transmitters for both code and voice
near the Ryan Laboratory (WGYX).
A fourth smaller transmitter was
recently set up on campus (WGTE).
''The club will be glad to trans
mit emergency messages for stu
dents at any time," said Barnhart.
GOOD WILL ACTIVITY
Members are working actively for
international good will. They have
designed their own QSL cards (ver
ification cards sent out to foreign
contacts), which bear a picture of
the University. These cards are
mailed all over the world at the
rate of two or more a day.
South America and Asia are the
most consistent areas of contact,
said O. G. Villard, Jr., faculty ad
viser. Pacific voice contact has been
made as far as Shanghai.
