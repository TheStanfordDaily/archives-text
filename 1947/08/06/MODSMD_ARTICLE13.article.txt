## In the Public Eye

The Farm, as a general rule, is a friendly place—a shining
example of good fellowship. But that rule evidently does not
exist on the campus roads, judging by the continual war going
on among motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians.
A fellow we know complained only yesterday that, as he was
riding along on his bicycle religiously minding his own business,
a long, sleek car flashed past him. This he says he didn't mind
because he knows he takes his life in his hands every time he
goes out on the street. What bothered him, he says, is the fact
that the gentlemanly Stanford rough in the car expectorated as
he went by.
Even such a flagrant act of aggression as that probably would
have been passed off philosophically—you know, Life on the
Farm and all that—except that the cyclist's glasses got splattered.
Naturally he couldn't see and drove up on the curb, running
down the wife and children of a freshman.
They, too, took it philosophically—but that's not all. The
man fell off the bike and banged his nose on the sidewalk, caus
ing a moderate number of red corpuscles to pour forth. One of
the poor guy's instructors passed by just then and got blood on
his new white shoes. Result: A probable flunk.
All of this, mind you, because a more affluent rough (one of
the Cadillac set, no doubt) didn't aim where he hit, or vice versa.
We feel bound to suggest that such unfriendly actions be es
chewed in the future.
