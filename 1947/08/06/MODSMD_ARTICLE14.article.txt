MULTIPLYING THE ADS
Item A: There is a national ad for Acme Beer which says, "If you
wish to enjoy Acme Boer, remember that it affords another reason for
making a return visit to the Pacific Coast."
I was wondering for a while why my parents were bothering to visit

the West Coast this month. But now I know. They
came for the Acme. Everybody comes to California for
the big Acme. Me? I'm going to New York in the fall
for a Schrafft's soda.
Item IJ: There is a national ad for a new movie called
"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer" which goes:
"When Gary Rings That Doorbell . . . ! Laughs will
ring out from coast to coast!"
I think such an ad is a false prediction. On the
West Coast, where everybody is filled up with Acme
Beer, there will be ringing laughter, but, because Acme
is just local stuff, the laughter will not ring east of the
desert. I wonder if Cary Grant drinks Acme.

Item C: There is a national ad for Johnson's Baby Products which
needs no comment, but which will get one. Part of it goes:
'MOM: . . . What do I do?
'BABY: Just this, mom. After my bath protect my skin all over with
(Jure, gentle Johnson's baby oil. And don't forget to use it at diaper
changes . .
First of all. you know this baby lives on the West Coast and needs more
baby oil than the usual baby because he is being weaned on Acme Beer.
The Johnson Company gives no suggestions for theater diaper changes,
though, but you just know that baby won't miss "The Bachelor and the
Bobby-Soxer."
Item I): The Hollander Furs Company is even more shrewd than the
Johnson people, because they tell us that the baby's Daddy is "the kind
>112 man who acts as if he enjoys getting up to give you (i a.m. bottles . . .
And. darling, he even shops for you!"
Now I can understand one bottle for the baby, but six is too many
to start the day with. After all, we want ringing, not rasping, laughter
when the baby sees "The Bachelor find the Bobby-Soxer. As for that
shopping Daddy does, in addition to getting Mummy a "scrumptious Hol
lander Blended Muskrat coat," I assume Daddy also brought home several
cans of Johnson's Baby Powder. Oh, hell, you just know he did.
Item E: There is a national ad for the Westinghouse New Two-Temp
Refrigerator, and it is just the thing to buy for general utility's sake.
"There's plenty of room for 76 meals ... at one time," the ads say. You
don't have to worry about the meals at all. The point is that this refriger
ator will undoubtedly hold three dozen bottles of Acme, a hundred cans
of Johnson's Baby Powder. Baby himself, the scrumptious muskrat coat,
and even Cary Grant if you care to fold him in two and wrap him in
vax paper.

wish to enjoy Acme Boer, remember that it affords another reason for
making a return visit to the Pacific Coast."
I was wondering for a while why my parents were bothering to visit

the West Coast this month. But now I know. They
came for the Acme. Everybody comes to California for
the big Acme. Me? I'm going to New York in the fall
for a Schrafft's soda.
Item IJ: There is a national ad for a new movie called
"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer" which goes:
"When Gary Rings That Doorbell . . . ! Laughs will
ring out from coast to coast!"
I think such an ad is a false prediction. On the
West Coast, where everybody is filled up with Acme
Beer, there will be ringing laughter, but, because Acme
is just local stuff, the laughter will not ring east of the
desert. I wonder if Cary Grant drinks Acme.

Item C: There is a national ad for Johnson's Baby Products which
needs no comment, but which will get one. Part of it goes:
'MOM: . . . What do I do?
'BABY: Just this, mom. After my bath protect my skin all over with
(Jure, gentle Johnson's baby oil. And don't forget to use it at diaper
changes . .
First of all. you know this baby lives on the West Coast and needs more
baby oil than the usual baby because he is being weaned on Acme Beer.
The Johnson Company gives no suggestions for theater diaper changes,
though, but you just know that baby won't miss "The Bachelor and the
Bobby-Soxer."
Item I): The Hollander Furs Company is even more shrewd than the
Johnson people, because they tell us that the baby's Daddy is "the kind
>112 man who acts as if he enjoys getting up to give you (i a.m. bottles . . .
And. darling, he even shops for you!"
Now I can understand one bottle for the baby, but six is too many
to start the day with. After all, we want ringing, not rasping, laughter
when the baby sees "The Bachelor find the Bobby-Soxer. As for that
shopping Daddy does, in addition to getting Mummy a "scrumptious Hol
lander Blended Muskrat coat," I assume Daddy also brought home several
cans of Johnson's Baby Powder. Oh, hell, you just know he did.
Item E: There is a national ad for the Westinghouse New Two-Temp
Refrigerator, and it is just the thing to buy for general utility's sake.
"There's plenty of room for 76 meals ... at one time," the ads say. You
don't have to worry about the meals at all. The point is that this refriger
ator will undoubtedly hold three dozen bottles of Acme, a hundred cans
of Johnson's Baby Powder. Baby himself, the scrumptious muskrat coat,
and even Cary Grant if you care to fold him in two and wrap him in
vax paper.
