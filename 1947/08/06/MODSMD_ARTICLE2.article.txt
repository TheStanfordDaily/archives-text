# 'Politics and Law Don't Mix'--Knight
## 
### STU FITCH 
A great political career and a
great law career do not mix in our
present complicated life, Lt. Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight, '19, warned his
Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity
brothers at a luncheon yesterday in
the Union dining room.
'"There is enough to do in such a
combined career to fill three life
times," he said, thus posing to Stan
ford's law students the choice they
must make in preparing for the
post-school world.
SPECIALIZATION REQUIRED
Until the time of President Wil
liam McKinley, the lawyer-states
man could combine the activities of
a successful political and legal ca
reer, he said. But with the arrival
of corporations and complicated
business management, the lawyer
saw the need of specialization to
meet the demands of the people. He
then had to choose between law and
politics.
"I found in my own experience in
private practice that I could not di
vide my time between the two
without jeopardizing one or the
other," said Knight.
ROOSEVELT NOT LAWYER
In reply to questions concerning
such lawyer-politicians as Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Thomas E. Dewey, and
Earl Warren, Knight explained they
had not been lawyers in the true
sense. Their periods in private prac
tice had been only training grounds
of short duration. Their ultimate
goal was that of public service, he
said, not that of becoming great
lawyers.
"A good lawyer must be able to
fill the shoes of another person, and
not be afraid to walk in them," he
said.
