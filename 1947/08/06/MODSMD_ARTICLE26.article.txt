# Kappa Alpha Hurler Loses Two-Hit Effort
## 
### 
The Kappa Alphas, current lead
ers in the intramural Softball pro
gram, took their first beating of the
season when they were shut out by
Phi Psi Monday afternoon by the
score of 2 to 0.
John Mills, who hurled for Kappa
Alpha in the absence of their regu
lar hurler, Joe Sher, allowed the
Phi Psi outfit only two hits. One of
these hits, however, was a rousing
homer off the bat of shortstop Babe
Schmenkloph with a man on base,
and the game was decided then and
there.
In the other game scheduled for
Monday, Encina 3W couldn't get
their team together and forfeited

the contest to Encina 4E.
Only one game was on the docket
for yesterday afternoon, and in that
contest Phi Delta Theta was beaten
by the Firehouse to the tune of 15
to 11.
