# Kallen Cites Role of Force In Peacetime
## 
### 
"A free man is necessarily and es
sentially a fighting man."
This was the statement of Dr. Hor
ace Kullen, professor of philosophy
and psychology at the New School
for Social Research, speaking to the
Tuesday Evening Series audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Speaking on the topic, "The Place
of War in the Education of Free
Men," Dr. Kallen said that it is an
illusion to believe that peace can be
won and maintained without pre
ponderant force.
The speaker related some of the
lessons of history that lead to this
conclusion.
"So Woodrow Wilson, and so the
rest of us reading history, came to
the conclusion that there never had
been any peace which had not been
enforced," he said.
It we do not have peace between
nations, we will have war. In either
case the instrument is the same, the
speaker concluded.
Dr. Kallen has been described as
one of the original and foremost ex
ponents of the concept of cultural
pluralism in America. Cultural plu
ralism stands for a complete denial
>112 authoritarian ways of life, hold
ing that people best realize their
human value and institutions best
fulfill their purpose when they can
co-exist in freedom rather than co
ercion. in co-operation rather than
compulsion.
The speaker was introduced by
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, vice-president
of the University.
