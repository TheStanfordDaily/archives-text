# 'I' Club Draws Cosmopolites, Discusses World's Problems
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Stanford's International Club is fast becoming a cure for international
bad neighborliness.
Faced with the task of initiating foreign and stateside dwellers into
the Stanford Family, the club has established an earthly "land o' Goshen"
policy.
We sought out Barbara Lang, 'T' Club president, on this matter and

were hit broadside with:
"I guess you might say our chief
goal is to strengthen international
ties —to erase time - worn stereo
types people have in regard to other
nations."
VARIED ROSTER
A glance at the"I" Club roster
reads like a streamlined copy of
"Around the World in Eighty
Days."
For a sample, there is Hayati
Balkanli of Bakirkoy, India; Saad
and Hamed Amor of Cairo, E#/pt;
Otakar Fischer of Praha, Czechoslo
vakia: Syed Ali of Bengal, India;
and just to make it interesting, the
roster includes group social chair
man Jean Richmond of Watson
ville.
"From all appearances," we said,
"the club's members must be well
informed on world problems."
"Yes, they are," Miss Lang coun
tered, "and most of them find that
discussing international problems
in preparing for classwork on
the campus."
Miss Lang, strongly interested in
work of a geo-political nature, con-
I tinned:
AIM STATED
"We're at the point where we feel
I that we've accomplished something
if we can make people conscious of
| nations instead of thinking in terms
of individual countries."
Discussion of world problems —
UN policies, food shortages, nation
alist crises, and worldly mediation—
dominates the club agenda which,
| this quarter, has presented speakers
| of the caliber of Harold Steinmetz
| and Armin Rappaport.
