# Ammonia Research Chemists Meet For Discussion of Current Problems
## 
### 
Current problems in ammonia chemistry research are being discussed
by the country's leading scientists at the four-day conference now in
progress in the lower lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
Organized by the Department of Chemistry, the final sessions today
and tomorrow will begin at 9:30 a.m. under the chairmanship of Dr. Rich-

ard A. Ogg, associate professor of
chemistry and director of ammonia
research at Stanford.
NAVAL RESEARCH GRANT
He is currently engaged in work
under an Office of Naval Research
grant to investigate the composition
of solutions of metals in liquid am
monia.
The meeting, which commemo
rates the late Drs. Edward C.
Franklin and Francis W. Bergstrom
—both leaders in the field of am
monia chemistry — will revive the
postwar series of informal summer
conferences on chemistry.
CONFERENCE AIM
Primarily concerned with the use
of liquid ammonia as a solvent, the
conference will show the results
of the comparison of ammonia solu
tions with water solutions in regard
to electrical conductivity, electro
motive force of galvanic cells, the
speed of chemical reactions, and
chemical equilibrium.
Among the scientists presenting
papers are Dr. Charles A. Kraus,
Brown University; Dr. Frederick C.
Schmidt, Union College; Dr. Don M.
Yost, California Institute of Tech
nology: and Dr. Joel H. Hildebrand,
University of California.
