SUMMER VACATION
(Short Course!)
Shortest month of the year for summer school stu
dents is between the end of summer quarter and the be
ginning of the regular school year.
To make that month resemble a real summer vacation,
we suggest flying to your home or vacation spot. Flying
means you can be in Chicago or New York almost before
the last "slow" student has turned in his final exam.
We welcome you to drop in and visit us. We're sure
you'll be pleasantly surprised by the time and money you
can save. There's no charge for our information service,
either.
To assure yourself a full month of summer rest and
relaxationâ€”see ....

We can assist you in securing your "Back to the Farm"
reservations, too.
