# New Television Tube

### 
Development of a traveling wave
radio tube which can amplify si
multaneously 250,000 telephone con
versations or 300 black and white
television broadcasts or 100 in color j
was announced yesterday by Dr.
Lester M. Field, associate professor
of electrical engineering.
The research is a continuation by
Dr. Field and Dr. John R. Pierce of
research begun last year by the
Bell Telephone laboratories.
The slender one-foot-long tube
has an enormous electrical appetite
which doubles the ability of earlier
models to cover a wide range of j
frequencies and handle a huge vol
ume of radio traffic. It overcomes
the fundamental law governing all
other known tubes which restricts I

them to low amplification if they
have room for many channels.
The present model of the tube
operates around 10,000 megacycles
compared to the standard radio
broadcast of about 1,000 kilocycles,
and amplifies a band 2.500 times as
wide as is included across the whole
dial of an ordinary household radio.
Facilitating commercial expansion
of television, the vast number of
frequencies covered will provide
enough room for many television
stations to operate simultaneously
without interfering with each oth
er's signals. With further develop
ment, it could cut down television
costs by reducing the number of
amplifying tubes necessary in such
sets.
