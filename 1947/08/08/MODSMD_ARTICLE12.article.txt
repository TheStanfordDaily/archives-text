# Bulgaria Is Opposed To Balkan Disputants
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., Aug. 7 (UP).—Bulgaria
j complained in the United Nations Security Council
I today that Greece and the Western Powers were
trying to prolong the Balkans dispute "forever" in
order to further their own aims in southeastern Europe.

► Bulgaria's Dr. Nissim Nevorah
told the council that, because of
the internal situation in Greece,
trouble along the Balkans border
probably would continue for a long
time.
"The Greek government and those
who support it,"he charged, "have
no desire to settle the situation.
They want to make it a wound
which never will heal, a gangrene
that never heals."
Col. Nesti Krenexhi of Albania
chipped in with the charge that the
Greek government was throwing
new fuel into the Balkans situation
by means of "false accusations" and
"completely imaginary situations"
whicn reminded him of a popular
expression: "A sack which is always
empty can't stand up."
'lne Albanian and Bulgarian state
ments, delivered in reply to Greek
Ambassador Vassiii Dendramis'
charge yesterday that Greece was
being pushed toward "vassalage"
by its northern neighbors highlighted
an otherwise dull day of develop
ments in the muddied Balkans situ
ation.
I hey came at the start of the
council's afternoon meeting shortly
after a new seven-nation subcom
mittee had worked for three hours
behind closed doors in a vain attempt
to find a Balkans solution acceptable
to both Russia and the United
States.
The subcommittee, many of whose
members admit their job is almost
impossible, decided to meet again to
morrow and perhaps twice on Mon
day in an effort to find a compro
mise.
