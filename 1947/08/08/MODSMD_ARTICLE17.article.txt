trict vice presidencies,
'he convention's third day session
> interrupted when Harry Lun
)erf, secretary of the Sailors'
ion of the Pacific and a federation
e president, tangled with a man
ntified as "Jimmy" Wagh of the
nnery Workers of the Pacific
al at Terminal Island, San Pedro,
t'he fight lasted several minutes
ile delegates crowded to the front
Jhe hall to witness it and president
arles Real, Oakland, cried vainly
order. The men were separated
■y after each had bloodied the
\er's nose.

The cause of the fight was not im
mediately determined. When re
porters approached Lundeberg sev
eral sailors' union delegates stood
up and warned them away. One re
porter was given a not-too-gentle
shove as he tried to approach closer
to Lundeberg's table.
The resolution calling for an AFL
CIO merger was introduced by
James P. McLaughlin of the Retail
Clerks Union, San Jose, It called
upon the two labor organizations to
"make every effort to resolve their
differences and become one labor
movement."
The resolution was voted down
after the federation's secretary
treasurer, C. J. liaggerty, took the
platform and cried that "the times
ahead are not so hard that we must
align ourselves with an enemy,"
"What has the CIO to offer us
except disruption, dissention and
chaos?" Haggerty asked.
Resolutions adopted today request
Governor Warren to call a special
session of the legislature to enact
housing and rent control legislation,
and urge passage of the Wagner-
Ellender-Taft housing bill.
