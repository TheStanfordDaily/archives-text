# Truman Asks GOP Budget Investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 (UP).—
President Truman disclosed today
that he has ordered his fiscal experts
to make a "detailed and exhaustive"
study to find out just how much
the Republican-dominated 80th Con
gress chopped from his $37,500,000,-
000 1948 budget.
He told his news conference that
he didn't want to make any hasty
estimate because "a great many
complex factors have to be taken
into consideration." He added that
the American people were more
concerned anyway in how much
their government will spend next
year—not in "shifts and changes" in
budget technicalities.
Ever since Congress adjourned.
Democratic and Republican fiscal
experts have engaged in a running
battle of words over the total sav
ings of the GOP-economy drive.
Mr. Truman carefully avoided a
direct comment on the controversy.
But his formal statement openly
backed up the contention of his
congressional leaders that a large
part of the GOP savings was nothing
more than a bookkeeping manipu
lation.
Mr. Truman promised that, after
his experts have completed their in
vestigation, he would make their
findings public.
