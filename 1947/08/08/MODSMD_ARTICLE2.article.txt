# Excom Criticizes Suggested NSO Representation Policy
## 
### 
Excom Wednesday night recommended that Stanford not
participate in the National Student Organization if that body goes
ahead and provides that 15 out of the 25 positions on its execu
tive committee go to political and sectarian groups such as
American Youth for Democracy and the Student World Feder
alists.
Representation in NSO should be 0:1 the basis of students

representing their universities rath- ,
er than any political or religious ;
groups to \vhifli they may belong,
said Dan Entlsley. He added that
the granting of representation to
these groups would in effect be
double representation.
Part of Excom's hesitation in
backing NSO on the suggested basis
was the fact that the American
Youth for Democracy is an avow
edly Communist outfit. It was dei
cided, however, that NSO should be :
an organization of colleges and that i
therefore no external groups of any
sort should have any control over i
it.
MOTION PASSED
A motion to this effect by Bob
Hoyt and Jose de Larios was passed
with one dissenting vote.
Two Stanford representatives will
attend the constitutional convention
of NSO at Milwaukee, beginning
Aug. 30. They will be instructed
to present Stanford's views on the
subject, said ASSU President A 1
Harris. Whether or not Stanford
maintains connections with NSO
will depend on what organization
is set up at that time, he said—de
pending, of course, on the attitude
of next fall quarter's Excom.
The committee for the betterment

of student representation, headed
by Kathy Potter, recommended to
Excom that advisory groups be
formed to help Excom members
keep in touch with public opinion.
Many students don't know the func
tions of their student government,
said Bill Heyl, and some sort of ed
ucation program should be under
taken.
POTTER SUPPORTS IDEA
Miss Potter oavy support to an
idea that has been" brought up be
fore—that each member of Excom
be appointed to watch over a spe
cific area of student affairs. That
way, she said, each member would
be an expert on one certain subject
and efforts would be concentrated
rather than diffused.
The committee's survey is for the
information of fall quarter's Ex
com; no program will be considered
this summer. Further investigations
will be made during the week and a
final report made at next Wednes
day's final session of Summer Ex
com.
Dates for two barbecues were ap
proved: for Casa Naranja on Sat

Aug. 30. They will be instructed
to present Stanford's views on the
subject, said ASSU President A 1
Harris. Whether or not Stanford
maintains connections with NSO
will depend on what organization
is set up at that time, he said—de
pending, of course, on the attitude
of next fall quarter's Excom.
The committee for the betterment

of student representation, headed
by Kathy Potter, recommended to
Excom that advisory groups be
formed to help Excom members
keep in touch with public opinion.
Many students don't know the func
tions of their student government,
said Bill Heyl, and some sort of ed
ucation program should be under
taken.
POTTER SUPPORTS IDEA
Miss Potter oavy support to an
idea that has been" brought up be
fore—that each member of Excom
be appointed to watch over a spe
cific area of student affairs. That
way, she said, each member would
be an expert on one certain subject
and efforts would be concentrated
rather than diffused.
The committee's survey is for the
information of fall quarter's Ex
com; no program will be considered
this summer. Further investigations
will be made during the week and a
final report made at next Wednes
day's final session of Summer Ex
com.
Dates for two barbecues were ap

Excom Wednesday night recommended that Stanford not
participate in the National Student Organization if that body goes
ahead and provides that 15 out of the 25 positions on its execu
tive committee go to political and sectarian groups such as
American Youth for Democracy and the Student World Feder
alists.
Representation in NSO should be 0:1 the basis of students

representing their universities rath- ,
er than any political or religious ;
groups to \vhifli they may belong,
said Dan Entlsley. He added that
the granting of representation to
these groups would in effect be
double representation.
Part of Excom's hesitation in
backing NSO on the suggested basis
was the fact that the American
Youth for Democracy is an avow
edly Communist outfit. It was dei
cided, however, that NSO should be :
an organization of colleges and that i
therefore no external groups of any
sort should have any control over i
it.
MOTION PASSED
A motion to this effect by Bob
Hoyt and Jose de Larios was passed
with one dissenting vote.
Two Stanford representatives will
attend the constitutional convention
of NSO at Milwaukee, beginning
Aug. 30. They will be instructed
to present Stanford's views on the
subject, said ASSU President A 1
