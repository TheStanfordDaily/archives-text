## NSO—Good Idea, But... 
### 
When a National Student Organization was proposed a few
months ago, we thought it was a pretty good idea. We still
think it's a good idea—but not the way it's being executed.
There will be an executive committee of 25 members, out of
which 15 will go to various and sundry organizations represent
ing as many political and religious groups—if the projected
plan goes through. Prominent among these groups is Ameri
can Youth for Democracy, which is an off-shoot of the late and
unlamented Young Communist League.
We should like to ask the persons responsible for this just
how they can justify their actions. The ideal form for NSO
would be a league or confederation of student bodies. Just how
can outside groups qualify? Many of their members are not
students at all; those who are students are already represent
ed—they have no right to double or triple representation
(depending on the number of organizations to which they
belong.
We hold that NSO is entirely on the wrong track when it
proposes to take in organizations that are little more than
pressure groups. We are opposed to the participation of those
groups, whether they be young Communists or young
Republicans.
In other words—if a controlling voice on the* executive
committee of NSO is to be given to groups not directly con
nected with college life, we can only advocate Stanford's com
plete withdrawal.
