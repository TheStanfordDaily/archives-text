## Bull Session 
### 
Hello to Nawaf A 1 Saud, the Prince of Araby, who is in the country
now and is even expected to move in with us here at Stanford if his old
man and the registrar say it's all right. The announcement in Wednes
day's press of the prince's royal presence did not throw the campus

into a furor probably because we have had a long
and cordial friendship with visitors from the Near
East and even once in a while with such specimens
ol royal lineage. Still. I think the prince is something
special, and if he is going to be a student here some
body should start indoctrinating him in Stanford
morals and manners.
The prince is in Oakland right now and he's going
to do the country in the company of the Arabian
Ambassador to the U.S., but certainly ASSU or Ex
com or whatever it is should get busy and pass a
few resolutions, write a new constitution and ap
point one of its more dapper members as a special

tutor to the prince. Of course, the prince is going to be babied around
by the ambassador and probably somebody from the State Department
is going to keep an eye on him so he doesn't get lost between trains
in Chicago, but all the same a Stanford man has got to be in that royal
party. The prince should not be without the Stanford point of view
handy for a moment until his registration.
Who else but a Stanford man could explain American culture to the
prince? If the prince is going to be here through the winter he has
certainly got to learn how to ski, and the Stanford man must also show
him how to watch a football game and by all means how to fashion a
rooter's-cap into something of style and character. The prince must also
be acquainted with sports yells, songs and rallies, and our Stanford
agent has to point out why we all like movies better than the theater
(they're so much more realistic, dear prince). We have to get the
prince to subscribe to the right magazines, too, if he is to have any
chance of holding his own at all social functions; this means Time, The
New Yorker and Life, but certainly not Partisan Review, The Nation,
The Atlantic Monthly or Harper's since these are too highbrow for the
likes of the discussions around here.
Except for the proper magazines, the prince must be discouraged
from reading in order that he may have sufficient time to listen to the
radio, drink, drive his automobile, attend all the correct dances, and
lie in the sun—we must all be tan and healthy. However, if the prince
is so literary that we can't hold him down, it will probably be all right
to let him join a book club and subscribe to the Saturday Review of
Literature. The Saturday Review will provide him with enough harm
less reviews to prepare him for discussions with the English Club, an
organization which is, after all, only mildly dangerous.
We should get started on the prince right away, and I want ASSU
to get their man up to the royal entourage today. Our culture is always
at its finest on Sunday, and the prince should be in Palo Alto this Sun
day. Then the prince can be leti through a picket line, seated at a soda
fountain, have his watery orange juice for breakfast and giggle over the
colored comics with every single Stanford mind in the place.

Who else but a Stanford man could explain American culture to the
prince? If the prince is going to be here through the winter he has
certainly got to learn how to ski, and the Stanford man must also show
him how to watch a football game and by all means how to fashion a
rooter's-cap into something of style and character. The prince must also
be acquainted with sports yells, songs and rallies, and our Stanford
agent has to point out why we all like movies better than the theater
(they're so much more realistic, dear prince). We have to get the
prince to subscribe to the right magazines, too, if he is to have any
chance of holding his own at all social functions; this means Time, The
New Yorker and Life, but certainly not Partisan Review, The Nation,
The Atlantic Monthly or Harper's since these are too highbrow for the
likes of the discussions around here.
Except for the proper magazines, the prince must be discouraged
from reading in order that he may have sufficient time to listen to the
radio, drink, drive his automobile, attend all the correct dances, and
lie in the sun—we must all be tan and healthy. However, if the prince
is so literary that we can't hold him down, it will probably be all right
to let him join a book club and subscribe to the Saturday Review of
Literature. The Saturday Review will provide him with enough harm
less reviews to prepare him for discussions with the English Club, an
organization which is, after all, only mildly dangerous.
We should get started on the prince right away, and I want ASSU
to get their man up to the royal entourage today. Our culture is always
at its finest on Sunday, and the prince should be in Palo Alto this Sun
day. Then the prince can be leti through a picket line, seated at a soda
fountain, have his watery orange juice for breakfast and giggle over the
colored comics with every single Stanford mind in the place.

Hello to Nawaf A 1 Saud, the Prince of Araby, who is in the country
now and is even expected to move in with us here at Stanford if his old
man and the registrar say it's all right. The announcement in Wednes
day's press of the prince's royal presence did not throw the campus

into a furor probably because we have had a long
and cordial friendship with visitors from the Near
East and even once in a while with such specimens
ol royal lineage. Still. I think the prince is something
special, and if he is going to be a student here some
body should start indoctrinating him in Stanford
morals and manners.
The prince is in Oakland right now and he's going
to do the country in the company of the Arabian
Ambassador to the U.S., but certainly ASSU or Ex
com or whatever it is should get busy and pass a
few resolutions, write a new constitution and ap
point one of its more dapper members as a special

tutor to the prince. Of course, the prince is going to be babied around
by the ambassador and probably somebody from the State Department
is going to keep an eye on him so he doesn't get lost between trains
in Chicago, but all the same a Stanford man has got to be in that royal
party. The prince should not be without the Stanford point of view
handy for a moment until his registration.
