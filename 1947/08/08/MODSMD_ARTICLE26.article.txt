# Pine is Food For Termites
## 
### 
Termites and Monterey pine go
together like ham and eggs. Pro
fessor of Zoology S. F. Light and
grad student Frances Weesner
declared yesterday in Current Sci
ence magazine.
The tiny wood chewers love and
thrive on Monterey pine, they re
ported, and advised all who have
a distaste for being — literally —
eaten out of house and home not
to build with it. On the other
hand, they found that on a diet of
oak the termites lose weight and
get run down.
Termites like green wood about
as well as children like spinach,
the two researchers reported.
They failed to indicate whether or
not the "greens" build termite
muscles.
