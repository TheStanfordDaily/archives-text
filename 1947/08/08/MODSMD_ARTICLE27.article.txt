The Editor, Sir:
As a worker in the theater and
a lover of good theater wherever
it is found, I am in honor com
pelled to reply to the torrent of
biased, sophomoric, and stupidly
conceived abuse which your paper
has poured upon the Stanford
Players this summer. You have
been guilty of a kind of incompe
tent journalistic criticism which
must not be allowed to go unchal
lenged.
The quality of the Stanford
Players and the staff which directs
the group is nationally known and
recognized as superior. The Na
tional Theater Conference has just
this year awarded Stanford the
honor of being the first to experi
ment with an important develop
ment in the growth of the theater
—the artist-in-residence plan. I
question the school loyalty and the
integrity of the Daily staff because
of the kind of emotionalized
prejudiced criticism leveled at this
Stanford institution.
More serious than this, however,
the summer Daily has in its re
views and articles shown an un
forgivable lack of knowledge of
the purposes and responsibilities
of dramatic criticism. Worthy
criticism takes cognizance of the
role of the theater as part of our
cultural heritage and has a re
sponsibility for the improvement
of the means of preservation of the
heritage. It is based upon some
knowledge of the theater as an
art, of the particular purposes and
goals of the group criticized, and
upon an open-minded and honest
evaluation of the success of the
play in question in the light of
these aims and purposes. Mr. Ar
nold and Miss Lawrence have in
their articles been neither honest,
open-minded, nor even accurate
in their facts. I suggest that The
Daily hereafter see that reviewers
have more than a smattering of
knowledge of theater before they
attempt to criticize those who
have spent considerable time in its
study. I suggest for Miss Lawrence
a course in Shakespeare's come
dies. All rights imply duties, and
the right to print opinion implies
that the writer has a responsibility
to bring considered, mature, rea
sonable opinions to the public.

Freedom of the press 'does not give
everyone who has the ability to
operate the typewriter the right to
pontificate upon any and all sub
jects, nor does it excuse writers
from ordinary standards of cour
tesy, accuracy, and fair play. The
columns of a university newspaper
should not be the place where
adolescent Mr. Arnolds can ex
ploit neurotic grudges nor where
Miss Lawrences can exhibit their
ignorance and lack of taste.
The theater at Stanford depends
solely upon the money paid in at
the box office to permit it to con
tinue to present important plays
as well as it is able. A grateful
public continues to come in in
spite of the gauche sputterings of
irresponsible journalists. I cannot
express strongly enough my con
tempt for the shallowness and
prejudice of The Daily's policy
this summer.

irresponsible journalists. I cannot

The Editor, Sir:
As a worker in the theater and
a lover of good theater wherever
it is found, I am in honor com
pelled to reply to the torrent of
biased, sophomoric, and stupidly
conceived abuse which your paper
has poured upon the Stanford
Players this summer. You have
been guilty of a kind of incompe
tent journalistic criticism which
must not be allowed to go unchal
lenged.
The quality of the Stanford
Players and the staff which directs
the group is nationally known and
recognized as superior. The Na
tional Theater Conference has just
this year awarded Stanford the
honor of being the first to experi
ment with an important develop
ment in the growth of the theater
—the artist-in-residence plan. I
question the school loyalty and the
integrity of the Daily staff because
of the kind of emotionalized
prejudiced criticism leveled at this
Stanford institution.
More serious than this, however,
the summer Daily has in its re
views and articles shown an un
forgivable lack of knowledge of
the purposes and responsibilities
of dramatic criticism. Worthy
criticism takes cognizance of the
role of the theater as part of our
cultural heritage and has a re
sponsibility for the improvement
of the means of preservation of the
heritage. It is based upon some
knowledge of the theater as an
art, of the particular purposes and
goals of the group criticized, and
upon an open-minded and honest
evaluation of the success of the
play in question in the light of
these aims and purposes. Mr. Ar
nold and Miss Lawrence have in
their articles been neither honest,
open-minded, nor even accurate
in their facts. I suggest that The
Daily hereafter see that reviewers
have more than a smattering of
knowledge of theater before they
attempt to criticize those who
have spent considerable time in its
study. I suggest for Miss Lawrence
a course in Shakespeare's come
dies. All rights imply duties, and
the right to print opinion implies
that the writer has a responsibility
to bring considered, mature, rea
sonable opinions to the public.

Freedom of the press 'does not give
everyone who has the ability to
operate the typewriter the right to
pontificate upon any and all sub
jects, nor does it excuse writers
from ordinary standards of cour
tesy, accuracy, and fair play. The
columns of a university newspaper
should not be the place where
adolescent Mr. Arnolds can ex
ploit neurotic grudges nor where
Miss Lawrences can exhibit their
ignorance and lack of taste.
The theater at Stanford depends
solely upon the money paid in at
the box office to permit it to con
tinue to present important plays
as well as it is able. A grateful
public continues to come in in
spite of the gauche sputterings of
irresponsible journalists. I cannot
express strongly enough my con
tempt for the shallowness and
prejudice of The Daily's policy
