The Editor. Sir:
With the risk of being con
demned to live as a blindfolded
Utopian I cannot resist the temp
tation of giving vent to my indig
nation caused by Dr. Kallen's
Tuesday evening lecture.
It is most surprising and disap
pointing that a scholar of Mr.
Kallen's caliber has the intellec
tual serenity to defend and advo
cate "force" as a premise for in
ternational peace; to misrepresent
history in order to support the
Hearst shibboleth, "We are at war
now."
Even the none-too-critical Stan
ford student must have wondered
at our distinguished philosopher's
standard of values when he heard
the Machiavellian assertion that
civil peace is primarily based on
police force, and the paradoxical
statement that war is a necessity
for the upkeep qf freedom.
Assuming that Dr. Kallen has
only a little respect for the moral
potentialities of man, as well as a
slight hope for eventual peace, one
should discourage him from fur
ther delivering lectures on free
dom, war, and peace if it is not his
aim to precipitate World War 111.
