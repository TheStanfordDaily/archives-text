WASHINGTON, Aug. 7. — The
Senatorial investigation into the
wartime contract activities of the
Whew! Dogfood Co. went into its

jjjsecond week to
j day with Fala,
i dog of the for
i me r President,
r on the stand. He
categorically de
nied that the
lush entertain
ment offered
him by Johnny
| Fly er of the
Whew! Co. had

anything to do with his recom
mendation that Whew! be granted
a contract to supply the K-9 Corps
with dog biscuits.
Said Fala, "I categorically deny
that the lush entertainment offered
by Johnny Flyer had anything to
do with my recommendation that
Whew! be granted a contract to
supply dog biscuits for the K-9
Corps."
"It seems strange that the first
case you chose to investigate in
volved the dog of a President!"
Fala added to Sens. Fumblesome
(F., Itchigan) and Rooster (R.,
Moane).
"I suppose you're inferring that
this is a political investigation,"
shouted Sen. Fumblesome angrily.
"Well, we don't give a damn what
you think!" Smoke poured out his
ears and his nose flashed alter

nately red and green; Fala cow
ered in (he witness chair.
Earlier, Sen. Fumblesome had
asked Fala about Johnny Flyer's
testimony that he had spent thou
sands of dollars wining and dining
the Presidential dog while nego
tiating a plush war contract for
Whew! Fala admitted that his ac
tions in accepting the entertain
ment might b» censorable, but that
his honesty was not open to ques
tion.
Sen. Fumblesome: "I must say
this seems highly irregular."
Fala: "Not at all, everybody
does it."
Sen. Rooster: "There's more here
than meets the eye! I'm not satis
fied with the explanation at all!"
Fala: "If accepting entertain
ment from a contractor is dishon
est, why did you travel all over
the country at the expense of the
Bleeding Heart Dog and Cat Food
Co. —a concern that also was after
the contract to supply the K-9
Corps?"
Sen. R.: "Harrumph! Well, I—
er—fap—l paid my own expenses,
of course! My only object was to
get the best food possible for the
heroic and valiant dogs of our
great country! I assure you—"
At this point Sen. Fumblesome
stepped in hastily, explaining that
Sen. Rooster was not under inves
tigation.
(Howard Whew!, president of
Whew!, had previously charged
Sen, Rooster with using strong
pressure in an attempt to force
him to merge his company with

Bleeding Heart Dog and Cat.)
Sen. Fumblesome asked Fala if
he had anything lo say about,
Johnny Flyer's admission that he
had furnished feminine compan
ionship for the Presidential dog
during the period of negotiation
for the contract. Fala was com
pletely incensed.
"How would you say that ties in
with this alleged attempt to smear
your reputation?" asked Sen.
Fumblesome.
"I would say, 'That ties in with
this alleged attempt to smear my
reputation'," Fala answered, "That
is the most awful thing anybody
could have said about me," he
added. "Imagine the dog of a
President needing someone else to
get his women for him!"
Fala will take the stand again
when the hearing reconvenes to
morrow afternoon. Sen. Rooster
indicated that he would ask the
former Presidential dog at that
time about presents of nylon col
lars that Mrs. Fala allegedly re
ceived from Johnny Flyer during
the period in question.
After the hearing recessed, Sen.
Fumblesome was asked when the
investigation was going to take up
the matter of whether or not the
Whew! Co. ever delivered the dog
biscuits for which it contracted.
"Oh. er," he said. "Oh, the con
tract! We'll get to that in due time
—but you must bear with us. We
must take up the most important
matters first in this great nonpar
tisan investigation!"
