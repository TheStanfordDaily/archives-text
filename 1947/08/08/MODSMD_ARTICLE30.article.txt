# Grannis Visits University City; Finds International Community
## 
### LAWRENCE GRANNIS (Special to The Daily 
Our motto, "The Winds of Free
dom Are Blowing," might well be
applied to the Cite Univei'sitaire,
the University City, of Paris. Here
3,500 students — one-third of them
foreigners—of every race and creed
are studying together in an inter
national community that is perhaps
unequaled anywhere in the world.
There is no such thing as a "typical
student" here, nor are there any
classrooms. For the function of the
Cite is to serve as a vast "dormi
tory" for young men and women of
all nations who are studying here
in Paris.
HUB OF ACTIVITIES
Each morning the student popu
lation fans out all over Paris for
their studies. Aspiring medics and
lawyers take a 10-minute ride on
the subway to the Latin Quarter
where the labs and lecture rooms
of the University of Paris are scat
tered around. The music student
down the hall studies in his room
and takes his weekly lesson from
his professor in his apartment in
Montmartre across the city. Art
students head for the suburbs to
paint or sketch, or perhaps to one
of the museums. Just as at Oxford,
which is patterned after the original
University of Paris of the Middle
Ages, individual freedom is the key
note and the entire city the "cam
pus."
Nevertheless, the Cite remains
the hub of student activities. In its

100 acres there are several restau
rants, an excellent athletic plant, li
braries, and recreation facilities—all
in addition to the 19 modern dorms
constructed by various nations for
their young countrymen studying in
Paris. Across the street are the
shops and a string of sidewalk cafes
where the students gather over a
drink—invariably a six-cent "demi"
of weak beer—for the inevitable
bull sessions on politics, art, sex, or
the current incredible inflation. In
such an atmosphere it is natural
that the student population of this
"city within a city" have developed
catholic tastes and an easy toler
ance. Cynics who might dismiss
their attitude as foggy, do-gooder
idealism would be surprised at the
Cite's part in the war.
SMALL GROUP STARTS
By the time the Germans entered
Paris, only the Cite's permanent
staff and a handful of foreign stu
dents stranded in Paris remained.
This small group set out to do two
things. First, they sent blankets,
food, and so on to fonjner Cite stu
dents who were in German POW
camps. Second, they set out to make
the life of the German troops using
the Cite as a rest center as unpleas
ant as possible. They succeeded in
both. Former Cite students who had
escaped from German prisons found
here faked identity papers and oth
er necessities for making good their
escape to Switzerland or to the Ma
quis. Madame Thomas, the secre
tary of the International House, was
"forced to leave rather hastily for
a year" for aiding Allied airmen to
escape. Now, happily, she is back
at the task she likes best—promot
ing international understanding and
restoring the Cite itself.
Much remains here to be done.
The Germans looted and destroyed
much of the furnishings and equip

ment. The rooms today are still
sparsely (but comfortably) fur
nished. Food is adequate but sugar,
fats, and similar staples are missing
in the cafeteria which serves as a
central eating place for all of us
here. The libraries, like so many in
Europe, have had no new acquisi
tions since 1939. With it all, things
are getting started again and Ma
dame Thomas hopes the American
contingent here will be augmented.
"I hope it can be arranged for some
of the Stanford students to come
here. I'm SURE they will find much
they will like." She has every rea
son to feel so certain.
