# Films—Poor Plot Penalizes Crosby
## 
### 
The following are a few excerpts
from the plot of "Welcome Stran
ger" and may serve to warn the un
wary just what they're up against
in this picture.
A doctor, played by Bing Crosby,
is trying to cure a confirmed alco
holic of his curse and of blinding
headaches which seem to be the re
sult of his drinking. When this is
found not to be the case, Dr. Cros
by blithely brings his patient a pint
of spirits to celebrate his good for-
Uine.
At another moment, the doctor
has just delivered a baby, and his
lady friend, who has been up all
night waiting, is heard to say, "My,
how small!"
Now all this is a pretty far cry
from the quality of "Going My
Way," wherein we first saw the
combination of Bing Crosby and
Barry Fitzgerald. The difference is
that Leo McCarey, who directed
"Going My Way," has a rare feeling
for subtlety and tragicomic situa
tions, whereas Elliott Nugent, the

man responsible for "Welcome
Stranger," has simply slapped to
gether a lot of warmed-over non
sense that wouldn't have come up
to anybody's standards in the nick
elodeon days.
Crosby is in his usual shape, and
this means quite agreeable, but
even his matchless personality be
comes irritating when forced to dec
orate such pure hokum. It is almost
embarrassing to watch Fitzgerald
waste his talents here.
The trouble with this picture is
that to many extraneous and im
plausible elements are introduced
and the whole affair is greatly
weakened. It is too much even for
Crosby and Fitzgerald to support
this claptrap.—Keenan
