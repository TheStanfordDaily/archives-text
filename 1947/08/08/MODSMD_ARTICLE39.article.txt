# '49-ers Shine in Brief Drill; Freitas Aerials Score at Ease
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
ACORN FIELD, MENLO PARK, Aug. 7—The San Francisco
49'ers won a football game today "beating themselves" for the
sun-kissed enjoyment of 500 of the curious, including several
hundred Veterans' Administration patients.
Sparked by darting Jesse Freitas' whip-handed right arm, the

Whites defeated the Reds, 18 to
in a touch tackle fray, three pass I
plays doing the trick.
. The Reds' only bid for unanimous
fame was Halfback Wally Yonamine's
72 yard cutback through tackle. !
Yonamine probably ran twice the
distance cutting in and out behind
his blockers.
GRGICII SCORES TALLY
Initial Red score was registered
five minutes after the opening
whistle, Freitas passing to Halfback
Ned Matthews who in turn lateraled
to Guard Visco Grgich for the TD.
The play covered 52 yards.
Freitas' passes to Orv Hatcher, ex-
UC star, and End Dick Home for
40 and 18 yard TDs, respectively,
settled the issue early.
Lone White tally was a Bev Wal
lace pass to Alyn Beals that was
every bit of 80 yards in length. Either
Beals is the fastest man in the world
or defensive halfback Matthews is
the slowest man in camp!

Norman Standlee, of Farm Wow
Boys Fame, has indicated lie lost
none of his punch and zip as he re
peatedly tore sizeable chunks of
yardage through the Whites' line.
Quarterback Frankie Albert played
very little, but will see full duty
action tomorrow eve. He is still
virtually hors de combat with a
banged-up finger on his throwing
hand.
Veteran Guard Dick Bassi, still
suffering from a leg injury sus
tained early last month, will be on
the shelf for another two weeks.
The Bay area provincials meet in
