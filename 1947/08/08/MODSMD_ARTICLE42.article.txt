"Great bunch of boys you have
here."
The well-dressed Morabito grin
ned: "Wasn't that Yonamine great?
He reminds one of Herman Wede
meyer, doesn't he?"
PREDICTS GRID PEACE
We were pleased to see both gen
tlemen in such talkative spirits.
Admiral Ingram, flushed with vocal
souvenirs of an old-time Navy,
again reiterated his prediction of
"hard won peace" between the new
AA loop and the older National pro
league.
"Within the next four years, both
professional leagues should get to
gether for a possible 'football world
series' in December."
DARING TEAMS
"Professional football games are
the real McCoy," the Admiral said,
"and it's not surprising to find teams
running from the one yard line . . .
and sometimes they'll score."
We watched the great man brush
ashes from the lapel of his natty
blue suit. Old Jonas, we thought,
successor to Sleepy Jim Crowley!
"No gambling and more efficiency,"
the Admiral said.
A bystander charged the Admiral
and voiced a challenging: "Remem
ber those old subs in the first World
War?"
The commissioner stroked his

chin: "Certainly. Nowadays you can
stand up in the darn things. Not
like the old days."
"The conference looks pretty good,
doesn't it?" we asked.
"Much improved from last year,''
ihe Admiral boomed. "In time, it'll
be gr nt. Mark my words."
And with that salt-tinged pro
phesy, the Admiral went shullling
off to greet the Silver Fox, mean
ing the worried Buck Shaw whose
troops meet the Los Angeles Dons
on Sunday, Aug. 24, in San Francisco.
PLUG FOK THE WEATHER
"Quite different from college ball,"
the Admiral said, "yes sirree, every
boy's a star in his own right. And
saa-ay, this weather's terrific, isn't
it?"
Exit for the story-telling Admiral,
happiness-filled Senor Morabito,
and the worrisome Mr. Shaw.
