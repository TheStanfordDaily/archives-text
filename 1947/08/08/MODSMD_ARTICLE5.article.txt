# British Commons Defeats Churchill Censure Motion
## Eden Calls Plan Hasty, Incomplete 
### 
LONDON. Aug. 7 (UP). — Win
ston Churchill's Conservative party
forced the House of Commons to
night to vote on a motion of censure
against the Labor government's bit
ter new austerity program, but it
was defeated. 318 to 170.
Several hours earlier, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton told
Commons that he feared the last
of the $3,750,000,000 American loan
would be spent in October, and
when it was gone. Britain would
immediately stop buying food from
nations that demand dollar pay
ment.
Prime Minister Clement Attlee
called the fight against threatening
national bankruptcy a '"new Battle
of Britain" in a speech yesterday.
Dalton called it a "great storm" to
day. The opposition Conservatives
did not disagree with the Labor
party about its seriousness but with
its more work and less-of-every
thing-else plan for dealing with it.
Anthony Eden, second in com
mand of the Conservative party, de
nounced the program as a series of
"hasty improvisations, ill consid
ered, incomplete, inadequate."
The motion of censure actually
was a Conservative call for ad
journment of Commons and its de
bat? on the economic situation, if it
had been passed, it would have been
a vote of protest against the new
austerity program. As it turned out,
the program, worse in some respects
than the austerity of war days, re
ceived a handsome majority.


WINSTON CHURCHILL, Brit
ain's wartime Conservative Prime
Minister, who unsuccessfully chal
lenged the Labor government's
■"austerity program" yesterday.
