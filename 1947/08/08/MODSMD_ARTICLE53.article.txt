# Endorsement of Wallace for President Splits Local Democratic Organization
## 
### 
Intra-party strife among local Democrats has flared into further
dissension with the receipt of a letter by Dr. Victor E. Hall, Farm
physiology professor and president of the Palo Alto Democratic
Club.
The letter was signed by 27 former members of the club who

recently bolted because of the club's
endorsement of Henry A. Wallace.
Among the signers were Dr. Thomas
S. Barclay, professor of political
science and the founder and first
president of the club; Theodore J.
Kreps, professor of business econom
ics; and Harry J. Rathbun, professor
of lawâ€”all from the campus.
Stating that the Palo Alto Demo
cratic Club does not truly represent
the Democratic party in Palo Alto,
the letter presents the reasons for the
members' withdrawal. It claims that
the club is deliberately creating dis
unity in the Democratic party by
endorsing Wallace and by not assur
ing local voters that the club is op
posed to the formation of a third
party.
"We feel that the Democrats of
the Palo Alto area are entitled to
belong to a progressive Democratic
organization committed to work for
and elect Democratic candidates to
all state and national offices," says
the letter. "It is our intention to
form such an organization at the ear
liest moment without the divisive
elements that are so prevalent in the
present Democratic Club."
Replying to the letter, Dr. Hall
said yesterday:"The wifhdrawal
from the club of a small minority of
its members led by the high brass of
the local party organization, repre
sents their unwillingness to accept
the democratically expressed will
of the majority, who prefer Henry
Wallace to any other visible Demo
crat as the party's candidate for
president."
The issue, said Hall, was this:
Shall the local unit of the Demo
cratic Party supinely accept as in
evitable the nomination for the
presidency of a man whose talents
are not the best the party can com

mand, or shall it have the right and
responsibility to express its pref
erence for and lend its support to one
it deems far more qualified for this
high office.


I)K. THOMAS S. BARCLAY,
professor of political science, who
was the founder and first presi- j
dent of the Palo Alio Democratic ,
Club, has announced his resigna
tion from that body because of its
recent endorsement of Ilenry A.
Wallace for President.
