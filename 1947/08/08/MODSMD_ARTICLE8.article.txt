WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 (UP).—Secretary of State
George C. Marshall hus quietly assumed responsi
bility for all civil affairs in Korea as the first step in
his plans to take over from the Army in former
enemy states.

This was disclosed by authorita
tive sources who said Lt. Gen. John
R. Hodge, commander of American
lorces in Korea, henceforth will
report directly to Washington on all
political, economic and cultural af
fairs.
It was emphasized that the change
does not aitect military matters and
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur remains
Hodge's superior in all military af
fairs.
LONG SOUGHT MEASURE
The Army long has sought to turn
over to the State Department full
responsibility for military govern
ment and civil affairs in occupied
areas. Korea, it was understood,
will be sort of a "preliminary train
ing ' ground for similar action event
ually in other occupied areas.
The job of running civilian affairs
Jell to the Army at the close of the
war. The decision was made at
Potsdam.
But Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
obtained a promise from President
Truman then to relieve the Army in
Germany and to transfer the job to
civilian hands as soon as possible.
NOW lii 47
lie reminded Mr. Truman of the
rgieement on Oct. 26, 1945, and
lecommended that it be carried out
in no event later than June 1,
194G"—more than a year ago.
Disclosure that the transfer has
now begun indicated that an early
start may be made in Germany and
Austria. Cbn Lucius D. C£ay,
military governor in Germany, has
been having difficulties with the
State Department over policy and
there are recurrent rumors—uncon
firmed —that he will be replaced.
