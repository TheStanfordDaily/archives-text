# PHA Approves Housing Sites
## 
### 
Located in the foothills off Portola
Road, a community project of 400
homes is being planned for Spring
construction on a 285-acre site, ac
cording to the Peninsula Housing
Association. Stanford's Murray
Luck, professor of biochemistry, is
co-founder of the group.
Construction costs on the homes,
built on lots of one fifth to two
thirds of an acre in size, are ex
pected to x-ange between $8,000 and
$15,000.
Membership in the project is
granted by a committee on individ
ual merits alone. Racial minority
groups may become part of the com
munity in proportion to their share
of California's 1940 population.
BOARD TO RUN GROUP
The association will be run by a
seven member board, elected by the
community for a two year period.
Matters of major importance will
be referred to a vote of the entire
membership at "town meetings."
Plans for the project were begun
in 1944 at a series of informal dis
cussions. The architectural firm of
Funk and Stein was commissioned
to draw up building plans.
HOUSES OF STYLE
In no way resembling the typical
"housing project", the community
will be made up of houses adapted
to their individual sites, the topog
raphy will allow both one and two
story structures. "Contemporary
California" has been selected as the
architectural style for Ladera, as the
project has been named.
Problems of safety will determine
the layout of the homes, with only
two streets planned. Most houses
will be built on dead end drives.
The community, slated for com
pletion in 1949, will include a shop
ping center, service station, fire sta
tion, school, chapel, swimming pool,
tennis courts, and play parks.
