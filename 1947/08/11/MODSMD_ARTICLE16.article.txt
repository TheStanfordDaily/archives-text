## We Can Dream, Anyway 
### 
Every cloud has a silver lining —even in the field of inter
national economics. Great Britain the last few months has had
her cloud of dwindling dollar supplies, high occupation ex
penses, low production output, and worn-out eguipment. All in
all, the picture is pretty dark and Britons have little to be happy
about. The silver lining of Britain's cloud was the announce
ment last week that Hollywood would hereafter export no movies
to the island kingdom in reprisal for a large tax placed on foreign
film profits by the Attlee government. The English will no
longer have to sit through Hollywood's million-dollar stinkeroos.
They are fortunate; we are still burdened down with class Band
C films.
Briefly the results of the British move will be:
1. Hollywood will be forced to raise movie admission prices
here in the United States to make up losses from the British
market.
2. Americans will balk at the higher prices and will refuse
to pay to see the poorer films.
3. Hollywood will lose money on most of their movies and
will produce fewer and better pictures.
4. American movie goers will be happy.
Of course, the British who started the whole process will
still be deprived of American movies. But with less time spent
in theaters, more coal will be mined, more wool will be woven,
and more Scotch distilled. In short time, England will be back
on her feet again economically. Then she can start importing
class A American pictures once more.
Does the UN have any problems to solve?
