## Bull Session 
### 
The assistant professor's wife was talking to an instructor's wife on the
telephone and the assistant professor's wife was saying, "Now, Lucy, you
and Jim can't possibly miss this evening at Professor K's house. You simply
must come. You've known for a month he was going to have iced tea and
muffins tonight and all the department is expected. Really, you'll have a
good time, the professor and his wife are so sweet, and really, you know,
it's important for Jim to attend affairs like this if he ever expects to be
promoted like Harold.
'"Why, darling, you won't be bored, you'll have a lovely time.
Everybody's going to be there, and I know I've been looking forward so

long to hearing Professor K's new paper on Emerson.
Who! Emerson, dear, Ralph Waldo. Of course you've
heard of him, now don't try to joke with me. Oh, Lucy,
please. The professor has just reams of .fresh material
on Emerson he's been working on for years — Emerson's
influence on the New England town meeting tradition, I
understand — and it will be a tonic to Jim to hear it.
"Not toxic, tonic. Yes. Oh, certainly there will be
other faculty there. Professor K's paper won't be longer
than an hour or two and Harold tells me that Professor
M is bringing his new records over — four albums of
them. No, they're his records, he talks on them. He

•*\ 4 recorded tht m on his own machine and they're his
readings from his last book on 16fch Century Welsh. Yes! All in Welsh.
Isn't that exciting? Professor M reads Welsh so well.
"Oh. no, there'll be other people beside our own department. Well,
Professor Z will be there. I'm so anxious to discuss his last lecture with
him, the one he gave at the Tuesday Evening Series. You weren't there,
were you? It was the lecture called, 'The Sell's Relation to the Self's Own
Self." Why, yes, I suppose you never do know what will turn up in the
philosophy department, but I shouldn't think you'd want to miss the chance
to talk to him about it. He's so mystic, don't you think? Those eyes!
"Oh. my, I forgot. This is really the best of the evening. Pegleg Kelly
is going to be there! He's on parole again and Mrs. T is bringing him to
play with him for us. No, the piano and the harmonica. And he'll sing, too.
Why, Lucy, Irish potato songs, of course. He knows every Irish potato song
there is. Well, hardly, but he's sure to sing at least thirty or forty and wait
until you hear them, they're so much like Brahms—and yet they're a lot
like Tennessee mountain ballads, too. No, they're all different—the songs
just sound alike the first few times you hear them.
"Oh, Lucy, honestly, you should come, but if you say Jim is having
his allergies tonight I suppose it will be impossible. Well, some other time.
Perhaps this weekend because we want you (o come over and see Harold's
new rubber plant. All right. Toll Jim I hope he feels better."
When the assistant professor's wife left the telephone her husband
said to her, "Jim under the weather?"
"That's what Lucy said, but I don't think he's ill at all, Harold. I
don't think they want to come tonight, that's all, like all the other nights."
"Why on earth not?" Harold said.
"I'm sure I don't know, unless they have no interest in the department.
You know, I think they'd been drinking when I called. Lucy sounded so
odd."
"Oh, surely, now," Harold said.
"I mean it. I think they just stay home by themselves every night
and get drunk."
"Do you really think so?" Harold said.
"I'm certain of it," his wife said.
"Great Scott, what empty lives they must lead."

muffins tonight and all the department is expected. Really, you'll have a
good time, the professor and his wife are so sweet, and really, you know,
it's important for Jim to attend affairs like this if he ever expects to be
promoted like Harold.
'"Why, darling, you won't be bored, you'll have a lovely time.
Everybody's going to be there, and I know I've been looking forward so

long to hearing Professor K's new paper on Emerson.
Who! Emerson, dear, Ralph Waldo. Of course you've
heard of him, now don't try to joke with me. Oh, Lucy,
please. The professor has just reams of .fresh material
on Emerson he's been working on for years — Emerson's
influence on the New England town meeting tradition, I
understand — and it will be a tonic to Jim to hear it.
"Not toxic, tonic. Yes. Oh, certainly there will be
other faculty there. Professor K's paper won't be longer
than an hour or two and Harold tells me that Professor
M is bringing his new records over — four albums of
them. No, they're his records, he talks on them. He

•*\ 4 recorded tht m on his own machine and they're his
readings from his last book on 16fch Century Welsh. Yes! All in Welsh.
Isn't that exciting? Professor M reads Welsh so well.
"Oh. no, there'll be other people beside our own department. Well,
Professor Z will be there. I'm so anxious to discuss his last lecture with
him, the one he gave at the Tuesday Evening Series. You weren't there,
were you? It was the lecture called, 'The Sell's Relation to the Self's Own
Self." Why, yes, I suppose you never do know what will turn up in the
philosophy department, but I shouldn't think you'd want to miss the chance
to talk to him about it. He's so mystic, don't you think? Those eyes!
"Oh. my, I forgot. This is really the best of the evening. Pegleg Kelly
is going to be there! He's on parole again and Mrs. T is bringing him to
play with him for us. No, the piano and the harmonica. And he'll sing, too.
Why, Lucy, Irish potato songs, of course. He knows every Irish potato song
there is. Well, hardly, but he's sure to sing at least thirty or forty and wait
until you hear them, they're so much like Brahms—and yet they're a lot
like Tennessee mountain ballads, too. No, they're all different—the songs
just sound alike the first few times you hear them.
"Oh, Lucy, honestly, you should come, but if you say Jim is having
his allergies tonight I suppose it will be impossible. Well, some other time.
Perhaps this weekend because we want you (o come over and see Harold's
new rubber plant. All right. Toll Jim I hope he feels better."
When the assistant professor's wife left the telephone her husband
said to her, "Jim under the weather?"
"That's what Lucy said, but I don't think he's ill at all, Harold. I
don't think they want to come tonight, that's all, like all the other nights."
"Why on earth not?" Harold said.
"I'm sure I don't know, unless they have no interest in the department.
You know, I think they'd been drinking when I called. Lucy sounded so
odd."
"Oh, surely, now," Harold said.
"I mean it. I think they just stay home by themselves every night
and get drunk."
"Do you really think so?" Harold said.
"I'm certain of it," his wife said.
"Great Scott, what empty lives they must lead."

The assistant professor's wife was talking to an instructor's wife on the
telephone and the assistant professor's wife was saying, "Now, Lucy, you
and Jim can't possibly miss this evening at Professor K's house. You simply
must come. You've known for a month he was going to have iced tea and
