The Editor, Sir:
"Wo consider Mr. Arnold's "Dull
Session" articles incisive, knifelike,
flowerlike, like nothing in all the
world, but occasionally even his
brilliant critique of campus activi
ties "comes a cropper."
We refer specifically to his recent
bitter denunciation of the sartorial
inelegance of the "Stanford Rough."
Pegler-like, tall, top-drawer, poi
son-penman Arnold has in the past
entertained and diverted . . . but
really, in his recent article criticiz
ing the more affluent roughs for af
fecting farm - like costumes, i.e.,
jeans and T-shirts, he has taken a
most undemocratic stand, a stand
that can only be described as Marx
ian in its undemocracy.
If we interpret Arnold correctly,
he would have the Stanford rough
dress in keeping with his pocket
book and car. In short, Cadillac
owners under the Arnold plan
would attend classes in tuxedos,
Buick owners in double - breasted
blue, and drivers of pre-war vin
tage autos only would be permitted
the use of the "jean,"
While we of Chaparral have al
ways considered ourselves broad
minded, this line of reasoning, il
carried through to ils logical con
clusion, would have disturbing re
sults. In Mr. Arnold's academic de
mocracy, those without wheels
would go without clothes.
This madness must stop. In the
name of humanity and Phelps-Ter
kel we beseech, stop the "Arnold
plan" before it is too late.

The Editor, Sir:
I want to tell you how thrilled I
am with your newspaper. I have
been a housewife for over 30 years
and for the past 10 years have been
faced with a problem that I was
unable to solve.
Every time I walked into my
kitchen I was greeted with an awful
smell. No matter how hard I scrub
bed the place up the smell stayed.
Finally, the other day, I came across
a piece in your July 9 issue that
read: "Refrigerator ice trays should
be washed at least once a week with
soap and hot water.' In a flash I
raced to the kitchen and opened my

refrigerator door, I took the ice
trays out and wash them, arid would
you believe it, the smell went away.
I have had my refrigerator for 10
years but land o' Goshen who would
have thought it necessary to wash
the ice trays. I am so glad I read
your newspaper.
Housewife
Mt. Vernon, N.Y.
P.S.—My husband tries to tell me
people should wash with soap and
hot water at least once a week also,
but as I have never seen that in
your newspaper I told him he must
be wrong.

The Editor, Sir:
I want to tell you how thrilled I
am with your newspaper. I have
been a housewife for over 30 years
and for the past 10 years have been
faced with a problem that I was
unable to solve.
Every time I walked into my
kitchen I was greeted with an awful
smell. No matter how hard I scrub
bed the place up the smell stayed.
Finally, the other day, I came across
a piece in your July 9 issue that
read: "Refrigerator ice trays should
be washed at least once a week with
soap and hot water.' In a flash I
raced to the kitchen and opened my

refrigerator door, I took the ice
trays out and wash them, arid would
you believe it, the smell went away.
I have had my refrigerator for 10
years but land o' Goshen who would
have thought it necessary to wash
the ice trays. I am so glad I read
your newspaper.
Housewife
Mt. Vernon, N.Y.
P.S.—My husband tries to tell me
people should wash with soap and
hot water at least once a week also,
but as I have never seen that in
your newspaper I told him he must
be wrong.
The Editor, Sir:
"Wo consider Mr. Arnold's "Dull
Session" articles incisive, knifelike,
flowerlike, like nothing in all the
world, but occasionally even his
brilliant critique of campus activi
ties "comes a cropper."
We refer specifically to his recent
bitter denunciation of the sartorial
inelegance of the "Stanford Rough."
Pegler-like, tall, top-drawer, poi
son-penman Arnold has in the past
entertained and diverted . . . but
really, in his recent article criticiz
ing the more affluent roughs for af
fecting farm - like costumes, i.e.,
jeans and T-shirts, he has taken a
most undemocratic stand, a stand
that can only be described as Marx
ian in its undemocracy.
If we interpret Arnold correctly,
he would have the Stanford rough
dress in keeping with his pocket
book and car. In short, Cadillac
owners under the Arnold plan
would attend classes in tuxedos,
Buick owners in double - breasted
blue, and drivers of pre-war vin
tage autos only would be permitted
the use of the "jean,"
While we of Chaparral have al
ways considered ourselves broad
minded, this line of reasoning, il
carried through to ils logical con
clusion, would have disturbing re
sults. In Mr. Arnold's academic de
mocracy, those without wheels
would go without clothes.
This madness must stop. In the
