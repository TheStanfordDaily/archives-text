# Reds Sign Farm Athlete

The announcement that Lloyd
Merriman, Stanford's all conference
backlield ace and diamond star, had
signed with the Cincinnati Reds to
play pro ball, set forth a wave of
discussion on the campus yesterday.
The whole story will not become
known until Merriman reaches the
West Coast from Chicago — his
father expects him to arrive in two
or three days.
LIEBENDORFER:
Don Libendorfer, athletic pub
licity director, declared yester
day, "There's no question about it;
it was the most severe blow that
could have struck Stanford's grid
iron prospects for the coming sea
son."
Pointing out that Merriman, if he

had not signed with the Reds,
: "would have been one of the great
est running backs in America this
fall," Liebendorfer went on to add,
"But that doesn't mean that we'll
be flattened out. No sir."
"It's true that we were counting
on Merriman and Bob Anderson to
i offset a weakened line, but we still
have Anderson—and in Jim Naf
ziger, from Santa Ana Junior Col
lege, we have a prospect who should
go a long way toward filling Lloyd's
shoes. At Santa Ana they were
claiming that he would do just that
I —and up here last spring he looked
i very, very good."
WOLTER:
Baseball coach Harry Wolter said,
1 "After all, you have to con

, sider this: Lloyd lost some time
j when he entered the service, and
the question that he had to decide
j for himself was whether or not it
was worth while to continue col
legiate athletics or to turn profes
sional."
"It was his own decision, and now
that he has made it, I wish him a
lot of luck. He's definitely a major
league prospect; he's easy to handle.
I hope he goes a long way."
Merriman had considered accom
panying the Reds several months
ago, but when Wolter last saw him,
Merriman had apparently decided
not to make the trip.
The terms of Merriman's contract
are still unannounced.
