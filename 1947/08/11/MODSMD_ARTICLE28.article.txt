# Sequoia Approves Almack Proposal
## 
### 
Acting on the basis of a report
submitted by Dr. John C. Almack,
Farm professor of education, the
Board of Trustees of Sequoia Union
High School in Redwood City voted
on reshuffling of class last week.
After a survey at the school, Dr.
Almack disapproved a freshman
sophomore course in social living.
He recommended that students be
allowed to take more English and
history courses instead.
The board voted unanimously to
give 216 students enrolled for the
course a chance to substitute English
and history.
