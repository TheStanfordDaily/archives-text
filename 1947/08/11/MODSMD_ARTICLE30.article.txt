# Rough Visits German University
## 
### BILL FARRAR (Special to The Daily 
As I entered the University of
Munich I encountered members of
the Studenten Bautrupp working as
laborer, on the reconstruction of the
school. A prerequisite of entrance
is six months working in a Uni
versity office or on its reconstruc
tion. Thus, here were GOO students
of the September class earning 79
pfennigs per hour as well as gain
ing admittance to the school.
With nearly 10,000 students and
almost complete destruction of the
city, the housing situation is acute.
Since there are no accommodations
at school the students must live in
private homes, and the problem is
so severe that all those living with
in 50 kilometers of Munich are not
permitted to seek lodging in the
city.
The first postwar arrangement for
the exchange of five Munich stu
dents with five from the University
of Zurich has been completed and
the tuition, room and board for those
involved will be provided by the re
spective universities. The Univers
ity was most anxious to participate
in any scheme for the exchange of
students.
LACK OF U.S. PROFESSORS
At present there are no English
or American professors at school,
and they are greatly desired. Only
one lecture a week is given in Eng
lish—and that by a German philos
ophy professor. Since the University
has only marks and German ration
cards to offer, it is impossible to ob
tain these instructors.
To give an idea of the comparison
of living costs and expenses it may
be noted that the top monthly wage
paid in the Studenten Bautrupp is
200 marks, while tuilion for the se
mester is 150 marks, a room costs 40
marks per month and board runs
about 120 marks per month. (With
the official exchange rate of 10 to 1,
the G.I. Bill would provide 650
marks.)
STUDENTS' NEEDS GREAT
The University and student needs
are similar all over the American
Zone. On the book line, there are
no textbooks (the ones they do have
are mimeographed and principally
used in the math, physics, and chem
istry classes), the English libraries
are woefully inadequate with stand
ard English novels, dictionaries,
anthologies, classical and romantic

period literature, and current peri
odicals particularly desired.
The Armed Forces Institute has
donated its excess books wherever
possible to the universities, and the
University of Wisconsin English de
partment has just sent 100 selected
volumes to Munich. Still this library
of 1,000 volumes takes the place of
the 60,000 volumes of 1941.
Urgently needed are all mimeo
graph materials, typewriter supplies
and most of all—paper. The Stu
dentiwert can only provide three
thin pads of not paper per person
per semester .... and to secure
paper through commercial supplies
one must turn in twice the amount
of old paper that is needed.
EXTRA RATIONS OFFERED
Largely through the efforts of
former President Hoover, German
school children G-18 ai'e given an
extra ration of 300 calories daily but
this has not been extended to other
students. In Munich the Studenti
wert provides lunch for the student
at 70 pfennigs a meal. Today we
had Suppe (cereal soup)
and Kruttengemuse (carrots and
peas)—about 200 calories. It con

tained five grams of fat so one ra
tion ticket was required.
It might be of interest to note the
current monthly German ration in
the American Zone: 400 grams of
meat, 8.000 grams of bread or flour,
150 grams of fat, 1 pound of sugar,
21 Vz pounds of cereal, V' 4 pound
ersatz coffee, V\ pound of cheese, 16
pounds of potatoes, 20 eggs per year,
one pound of fish per month and i>
quarts of skimmed milk per week.
On the whole the picture is not.
pleasing, but there is hope. I was
greatly impressed with the spirit
and attitude of the average German
student—and at finding nearly all
of them spoke English. When diffi
culties were encountered we relied
on the international student language
Latin, and my four years of toil in
high school were actually of great
practical value.
