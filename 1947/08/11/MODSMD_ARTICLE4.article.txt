# Anti-Wallace Group Formed
## 
### 
Known as the Palo Alto-Stanford
Democratic Council, a new Demo
cratic party organization has been
formed in Palo Alto, announced
Chairman Roland Davis, yesterday.
The council is sponsored by local
Democrats who broke with the Palo
Alto Democratic Club when that or
ganization endorsed Henry A. Wal
lace's intended candidacy for Presi
dent.
Purpose of the new group is to
provide an organization for Demo
crats to work within the party
framework for the "interests of the
party and the country as a whole,"
said Davis.
"Therefore," he explained, "it is
anticipated that the Council will
follow a no-endorsement policy
prior to primary elections. Decis
ions on candidates and issues should
be made at the polls without public
interference by official party or
ganizations."
Included on the temporary execu
tive board are Robert Kline, vice
chairman; Theodore J. Kreps, pro
fessor of business economics, finance
chairman; Robert Peckham, treas
urer; Thomas S. Barclay, professor
of political science, membership;
Gertrude Moore, membership, Fran
ces Fisher, secretary; and Eugene L.
Burdick, publicity.
