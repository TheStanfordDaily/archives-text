# License Deadline For Autos Today
## 
### 
Deadline for enforcement of mo
tor vehicle registration laws has
been set for today, Edgar E.
Lampton, Director of Motor Ve
hicles, announced yesterday, as all
but a few 1947 license plates were
put in the mails.
Delay in setting the final date has
been due to shortage of steel and
manufacturing troubles, Lampton
revealed. He said orders have been
issued to the Highway Patrol for
strict enforcement of the registra
tion laws on and after next Mon
day.
"After next Monday all motorists
who display old license plates or no
plates at all will be stopped for an
explanation," Lampton declared.
"Also, those who display only one
1947 plate or who display plates
improperly will be stopped."
