## The 						World in Brief 
### 
Although there were many more
spectacular doings in yesterday's
news, the announcement from offi
cial sources that the British and
American occupation zones had
signed a $100,000,000 reciprocal
trade agreement with the govern
ment of Yugoslavia is undoubtedly
the most heartening. This is one of
the first real breaches in the so
called "Iron Curtain" and indicates
a more hopeful outlook.
The Security Council of the UN
heard a "gloves-off" speech by the
U.S. representative, Herschel John
son. in which he stated that a con
tinued use of the veto power by
Russia might force "action outside
of the UN to block the establish
ment of a Communist government
in Greece."
Johnson went on to say that the
U.S. would not sit idly by while
Greece was being threatened by Al
bania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.
The United States thus became
the first big power to suggest action
outside the peace-keeping machin
ery of the UN.
WALL STREET REACTS
The strong speech by Johnson
had repercussions in Wall Street
where buying was improved and
some stocks advanced.
Dutch troops are still fighting in
Indonesia, according to a charge
made yesterday by the new repub
lican government. They asserted
that an assault led by paratroopers
had advanced 30 miles. The Dutch
retaliated by stating that the only
operations in effect were "mopping
up" movements in areas already
captured.
Attorney General Tom Clark
opened a new "get-tough" campaign
by asking the Justice Department's
Anti-Trust Division to crack down
on the "conspiracies to increase
food, clothing, and housing prices."
With the cost of living at a new
post-war high, Clark's new policy
of asking the maximum penalty in
jail sentences in all convictions.
'DOCTRINE' EOR ITALY
The State Department revealed
yesterday that the"Truman Doc
trine" would soon include Italy.
Economic aid will be rendered to
that country in a manner similar to
that already being given to Greece
The UN Security Council voted
8-3 yesterday to let the Indonesian
Republic participate in debate on
possible further UN intervention in
its dispute with the Netherlands
government. Dissenters were Brit
ain, France, and Belgium, but as
their votes did not act as vetoes the
majority ruled.
