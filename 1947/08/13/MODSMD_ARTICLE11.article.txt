## Love That Excom! 
### 
Summer Quarter is drawing to a close, and tonight will see
the last scheduled meeting of 1947's Summer Excom. How
have the affairs of the ASSU fared under this interim, appointed,
administration? There have been activities, soft-ball, jolly-up,
SIRO drive, etc. There has been the routine business of date
granting, charters, budgets, and so on. And all these things, we
think, have been handled well. But The Daily is particularly
satisfied with Summer Excom's performance in the field of
policy.
As a result of the time spent in discussion of such problems
as hashing, representation, athletic awards, and several more,
continuity has been woven between last year and next year, and
preliminary work for next year haf. been put under way. This
is the most important function of a Summer Excom. Ordinarily,
policy discussion is neglected both because of lack of interest
and because there are more immediate interests. But any gov
ernment without policy is a government flying blind and with-
Dut instruments; student government without policy is at the
mercy of those, and there may be such, who do not wish it to
succeed too well. v
The ASSU already has most of the rights and or privileges
appropriate to any student government. Whatever may be the
situation in other schools, with us, at present, it is not a problem
of demanding further concessions, but of keeping what we have.
And, in our opinion, this summer's Excom has strengthened stu
dent self-government at Stanford.
