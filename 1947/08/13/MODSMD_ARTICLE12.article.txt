The August 11 issue of The Now Republic carries on its back page
an ad for the literary work of Samuel Roth. Maybe the ad was an NAM
plot to make The New Republic look like Breezy Stories or Circle, but
until the conspirators come out in the open, we'll jusl have to take Mr.
Roth as he is.
Advertised are three books written by Mr. Roth, along with a few
tributes to the man himself. At the beginning of his career, Mr. Roth

(according to the ad) stated, "I will write or publish
what seems to me true or beautiful, if I have to make
a barricade out of every jail in the United States."
Following this, in bold type, are the words "THREE
TIMES HE SUFFERED IMPRISONMENT." There is
also a tribute to Mr. Roth by one John D. Kerkhoff of
the Grand Rapids Herald, whatever that is. Part of the
tribute says, "In the days of Nathan and Mencken
Samuel Roth was known as the bad boy of Greenwich
Village."
One of the three books by the Bad Boy of Green
wich Village is an epic poem called "Halfway" and in it,
we are told, "something new, something miraculous
1 i Ji T7« l: .1. 1 1,

seems to have happened to the English language as this latter-day Isaiah
ranges France, Germany, Poland . . . Japan and China, hating and loving
so intensely that you never know which is which." A sample few lines
from the poem are given, of which I will quote two:
"The world was never made for one man's measure.
It "Was too tight a fit for Alexander . . ."
One suspects that Mr. Roth could work more miracles with two yards
of blue serge than with the English language.
The second book by this latter-day Isaiah is a work of philosophy
called "Peep-llole of the Present." It is "a revolutionary work done in
prison (with the aid of the research facilities of the Government)." Here
are two of the points which, it says, Mr. Roth makes in the book: (1)
'Consciousness (whose nature is sexual) is a physical substance which
functions as the adhesive that hold the world together" and (2) "Our
Earth is the center of everything—but with a twist that will take your
breath away." This earth business makes Mr. Roth a latter-day Ptolcmv,
too, and I don't know how our breaths can be taken away since we are
already quit" breathless, but if anything can do it, it is
"Bumarap," Mr. Roth's novel, whose subtitle is "The Passionate Pi 1 -
(sic) of a Male Virgin from a Park Bench to Park Avenue."
Norman Lockridge (try to place the name) is quoted as saying of this
novel, "If you're a man, its passion will shake you. If you're a woman.
I suppose you will just swoon." Then Mr. Lockridge proceeds with "The
scene of Bumarap's first meeting with The Countess —in which he begins
by kissing her toes —raises me to the very peak of reading pleasure." It
must also be remembered that "the book is hardly an idle fancy. Btuna
rap's passion is social as well as sexual."
It should be explained that Bumarap is the name of the hero, who
icquired his name "by telling the judge, 'It's a bum-a-rap, yo' honah.'"
One of the characters is a dog named Trotzky.
Finally, the ad tells us that "Bumarap" is a book we will read at "one
sitting—but you'll repeat that sitting for the rest of your life." The ad
ioesn't say where the sittings should take place.
One or all of four things is liable to happen to Samuel Roth: (1) his
books will be put on sale in the lobby of the Manor Theater; (2) "Buma
rap" will be adapted for the stage by the Stanford Players: (3) all three
books will join the best seller lists next to "Prinsafoxes": and/or (4)
Samuel Isaiah Bad Boy Roth will be formally accepted by the advance
guard of literature to play Gabriel to Henry Miller's God.
