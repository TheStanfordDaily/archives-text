The Editor, Sir:
Bud Arnold's slam session on the
Stanford AVC chapter was a little
hard to take.
Arnold has every right, to express
his personal opinions of the chapter
and the members. He does not have
the right, nor the reason, however,
to generalize from his experience at
one post-meeting bull session that
the regular chapter meetings are
characterized by long-winded ex
positions of the members' personal
viewpoints.
If Mr. Arnold had bothered to
check, he would have found out
that none of the AVC meetings
during the past year have been fea
tured by an expression of the per
sonal political viewpoints of the
members. The rather concentrated
discussion which Mr. Arnold infers
is the regular order of business had,
in fact, never taken place before.
If Mr. Arnold has a high opinion
of AVC in general, I cannot see
why he should choose to deliver a
broadside against any chapter upon
such meager acquaintance.
