# Bingle Ruins No-Hit Game

### 
NEW YORK, Aug. 12 (UP).â€”
Brooklyn and the Cardinals both
lost today, giving the American
League a chance at the baseball
spotlight as A 1 Gettol of the Cleve
land Indians pitched a one-hit 11 to
0 victory over Detroit in the second
game of a double-header.
With good luck, Gettel could have
had a no-hitter. In the first inning
Eddie Mayo hit a sharp grounder
just as shortstop Jack Conway, an
ticipating a shot through the cen
ter, broke to his left. The ball rolled
through the vacated position for a
clean double.
Backed by a 15-hit attack, Gettel
had no trouble completing a sweep
of the double-header started when
Cleveland won the first game, 3 to
1. Ed Robinson doubled home two
runs in the third inning to beat Hal
Newhouser.
Gettel's victory was his sixth
against six defeats.
The hot National League race
marked time as the Cards stayed
three games off Brooklyn's pace.
