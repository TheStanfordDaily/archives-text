# Food Good, Bad, 'Okay' Reporter's Survey Shows
## 
### ELEANOR LAWRENCE 
The Army may travel on its
stomach, but general opinion seems
to indicate that Farm summer stu
dents wouldn't get very far by this
method of travel if they had to de
pend on campus food.
By setting an unofficial Hooper
Rating, it was determined that the
women at Lagunita are faring best.
With the exception of one dissent
ing "absolutely repulsive," com
ments ran along the line of "good,
on the whole," "lots of variety," and
"well planned."
Main complaint was the lack of
quantity. Friday meals were sin
gled out as being the least inspired
of the week, with Monday through
Saturday breakfasts following sec
ond. Fortnightly "garbage salad"
notwithstanding, everyone agreed
that Lagunita meals were an im
provement in both quantity and
quality over food on the Row.
ENCINA FOOD OKAY'
Encina men were vague in com
menting about their meals, the most
prevalent answer being "I guess it's
okay." There were no specific com
plaints, although a number of those
questioned showed a desire to eat
at Lagunita.
With only three houses — ATO,
Beta, and Kappa Sig — open this
quarter, Row dwellers showed a
large range in describing their eat
ing conditions. All three were pic
tured at various times as "sloppy,"
"uninteresting," and "poorly pre
pared." And all three were also
called "pretty fair," "better than
usual," and "it'll do."
CELLAR POPULAR
Cellar food — especially 10 a.m.
coffee and doughnuts at the Snack
Bar —continues to attract the cam
pus at all hours of the day. Break
fasts are the most popular, mainly
because of the Cellar's snails and
cinnamon rolls. The variety and
preparation of lunch and supper is
"satisfactory."
"I've been eating out so often I'm
beginning to feel like a miniature
Duncan Hines," commented one
Stanford Village inhabitant, sum
ming up the attitude of those who

I find themselves eating in "all the
j dives in Menlo" this summer and
who hungrily await the opening of
fall quarter and the Village dining
hall.

pared." And all three were also
called "pretty fair," "better than
usual," and "it'll do."
CELLAR POPULAR
Cellar food — especially 10 a.m.
coffee and doughnuts at the Snack
Bar —continues to attract the cam
pus at all hours of the day. Break
fasts are the most popular, mainly
because of the Cellar's snails and
cinnamon rolls. The variety and
preparation of lunch and supper is
"satisfactory."
"I've been eating out so often I'm
beginning to feel like a miniature
Duncan Hines," commented one
Stanford Village inhabitant, sum
ming up the attitude of those who

I find themselves eating in "all the
j dives in Menlo" this summer and
who hungrily await the opening of
fall quarter and the Village dining
hall.

The Army may travel on its
stomach, but general opinion seems
to indicate that Farm summer stu
dents wouldn't get very far by this
method of travel if they had to de
pend on campus food.
By setting an unofficial Hooper
Rating, it was determined that the
women at Lagunita are faring best.
With the exception of one dissent
ing "absolutely repulsive," com
ments ran along the line of "good,
on the whole," "lots of variety," and
"well planned."
Main complaint was the lack of
quantity. Friday meals were sin
gled out as being the least inspired
of the week, with Monday through
Saturday breakfasts following sec
ond. Fortnightly "garbage salad"
notwithstanding, everyone agreed
that Lagunita meals were an im
provement in both quantity and
quality over food on the Row.
ENCINA FOOD OKAY'
Encina men were vague in com
menting about their meals, the most
prevalent answer being "I guess it's
okay." There were no specific com
plaints, although a number of those
questioned showed a desire to eat
at Lagunita.
With only three houses — ATO,
Beta, and Kappa Sig — open this
quarter, Row dwellers showed a
large range in describing their eat
ing conditions. All three were pic
tured at various times as "sloppy,"
"uninteresting," and "poorly pre
pared." And all three were also
called "pretty fair," "better than
usual," and "it'll do."
