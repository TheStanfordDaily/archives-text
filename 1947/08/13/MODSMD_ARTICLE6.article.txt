Henrik Ibsen's social drama "A

dren—lvar, Bob, and Emma.
Ellett designed and directed the
Ibsen work as part of the program
for his Master's degree. Chosen for
its playwriting structure, the "dra
ma with ideas" has" given him
the "opportunity to study Ibsen's
technique at close hand."
VICTORIAN ERA
A commentary on life in the 19th
century, the play will describe the
architecture, costumes, morals, and
general philosophy of the Victorian
era. Ibsen, the "father of modern
drama," created this social commen
tary as an argument for woman suf
frage in its early stages.
Tickets for the production, which
will conclude the summer quarter
season, may be purchased for 60
cents in room 202, Memorial Hall,
or ordered by telephoning Palo Alto
