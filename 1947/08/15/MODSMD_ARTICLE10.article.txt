# $150,000 Construction Work Begins Today; Underground Electrical System Is Planned
## 
### 
Work will begin today on a $150.- |
000 construction project which will
modernize the University's electric
distribution system and place it
largely underground. Director of
Planning Spencer disclosed
yesterday.
The project includes a new power
I substation and an underground dis
i tribution circuit which will service
all the present University plant, re
lieve the currently overloaded elec
, trical system, and provide facilities
to take care of ihe University's i
needs for 25 years at its present |
rate of growth.
PROJECTS NAMED
Initial steps in the project, which |
will not be fully comoletcd until j
September, 1949, will le construc
| tion of a new substatior on Panama
Street between the a -rodynamics
; laboratory and the Unb <rsity foun
[ dry, installation of m iholcs, and
1 building of distribution ducts.

This initial link in the duct sys
tem will be completed before open
ing of autumn quarter to minimize
the annoyance of disturbance to J

Workmen will begin work to
day installing 54 new fluorescent
lighting fixtures in the reserve j
book room of the Library, Carroll
L. Blacker, Corporation Yard su
perintendent, revealed yesterday.
The fixtures, which will give off
a white light, will be of the most
modern and efficient type and
will he installed in three rows of
IS units each.
The work will he completed in
time for the opening of autumn
quarter Oct. 1. . Cost of the proj
ect will he $5,080.

tion noise.
j All of the construction work is

being done by the staff of the Uni
versity Corporation Yard, under the
direction of Carroll L. Blacker,
superintendent of buildings and
grounds.
SUBSTATION
The substation, located on an is
t land in the middle of Panama Street,
will house a switchboard with nine
switching gear units. The equip
ment will be concealed behind an
ornamental fence and landscaping.
[ and will be of a metal-clad out
door type not requiring a roof.
Twenty - two cast - iron manhole

I versity"foundry under the direction
of Donald L. Mason and Asa A.
