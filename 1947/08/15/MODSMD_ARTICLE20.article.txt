# Post Office Now Is Stanford' Only
## 
### 
Effective August 20, the official
j designation of the post office lo
cated on the campus will be "Stan
! ford, Cal.," rather than "Stanford
| University. Cal.," Palo Alto Post
j master Ralph Evans announced yes
i terday.
The change was requested by the
j Administration to avoid the misrep-
J reservation existing through the use
j of the present address by private in
| dividuals and concerns for business
I purposes.
Mail posted to ''Stanford Univer
sity" will be delivered to the new
address, since all postoffices are in
j formed of such changes through bul
letins issued by the Post Office De
partment, Evans explained.
