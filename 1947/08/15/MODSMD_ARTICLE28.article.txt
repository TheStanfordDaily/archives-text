## It'll Take Philosophy 
### 
New Dean of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton is not stepping
into an easy job today. Since it was established in 1945 the
office of Dean of Students has come under more fire from
students than any other administrative post here at Stanford.
According to a statement made by the President's office
when the position was created, the Dean of Students is to co
ordinate the work of the Registrar, the Dean of Men, and the
Dean of Women. However, on a broader basis, it is the Dean's
job to see that good relations are maintained and established
between students and administration. Dean Kimpton's state
ment that he sees the office as a service, primarily to help the
students, is encouraging.
Briefly, as we see it, Dean Kimpton's main problems will be:
1) Re-establishing some degree of mutual confidence be
tween administration, faculty, and students.
2) Finding a solution to the food and housing problems.
3) Restoring the eating clubs to their former status.
4) Restoring the pride and respect that Stanford students
once had for their University, its traditions and customs.
Neither The Daily nor anyone else could expect Dean Kimp
ton to wave a magic wand and resolve all these conflicts and
difficulties at once. Perhaps it is significant that he took his
degrees in philosophy.
The job is tough and will become even more difficult with
the increase in enrollment this fall. We hope Dean Kimpton
can do it. We need someone who can.
