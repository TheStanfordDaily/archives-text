Can anybody tell me how to ecmpeFe an ad? You see, my wife and
I are trying to find an apartment or house, and I know that the right
kind of ad would bring some results. But what's the right kind?
I'm sure that, first of all, you have to intimate that you're a little
better than everybody else who's looking for an apartment, but, space

rates being what they are, you can hardly afford a
two-column exposition. No, you just have to settle
for a couple of indicative adjectives, like "mature"
or "quiet" or "affable." But you have to go easy,
because otherwise someone might think you're im
modest. Then it's my notion that you want to stay
away from words like "desperate," even if you feel
that way, because some landlord might be scared off
by this. "Desperate" won't wring anybody's heart;
more likely he'll think you may be in an advanced
state of strain or neurosis, and he may be right.
How about the sentimental ad? Would that work?
I've often wondered what came out of adi, that went:

My name is Barbara Ann and I'm four months old. Please
help my Mommy and Daddy find a twelve-room house for $20
a month so they can give me proper care. I never cry and I
have no pets.
I'm so blue
I don't know what to do.
Won't you help me? Write Box XX, Palo Alto.
If newspapers published the results of their ads, I'd certainly be
interested to find out how some of those big executives make out with
that kind.of ad which usually goes something like this:
Confident, aggressive, successful air lines president and family
of five desperately need mansion near Palo Alto. Finest refer
ences. Will pay five years in advance and hire gardener. Price
not important. Phone S.F. 1325, extensions 10, 12, 18, or 108
between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.; Chicago, UN-1874, 10-11 p.m.; New
York, BU-8-999X, 4:00-5:00 a.m.
I've often wondered why somebody who sounded that impressive didn't
go out and buy himself a home, but maybe it was because he wanted
ta see a nice description of himself in print.
It seems to me that you have to make an ad sound serious but not
overwrought. You have to get over, in five cold lines of small print, all
the facts that might catch a landlord's eye. I suppose, for instance, that
I should say that I'm a veteran, but how about that? Does that mean
anyhing any more? Then I imagine I should say that we have no pets
or children, and yet I wish I could add that I think pets are fine and
children wonderful, but think how cloying that would sound.
Maybe, actually, people are tired of serious ads, and perhaps a
frivolous one would do the trick, something like:
Horrible Stanford couple demand small house or apt. Hate
pets and children. Love to smash furniture, smoke, drink, and
throw wild parties. Will always be late paying the rent. No
references.
Okay. But anyway, all I want is some suggestions as to how to go
about this ad. If you can't help there, then I might consider an apart
ment itself an adequate substitute.
And incidentally, Mr. Endsley, tell Pool this was your idea, so he
won't send me a bill for—how many lines is it?

or "quiet" or "affable." But you have to go easy,
because otherwise someone might think you're im
modest. Then it's my notion that you want to stay
away from words like "desperate," even if you feel
that way, because some landlord might be scared off
by this. "Desperate" won't wring anybody's heart;
more likely he'll think you may be in an advanced
state of strain or neurosis, and he may be right.
How about the sentimental ad? Would that work?
I've often wondered what came out of adi, that went:

My name is Barbara Ann and I'm four months old. Please
help my Mommy and Daddy find a twelve-room house for $20
a month so they can give me proper care. I never cry and I
have no pets.
I'm so blue
I don't know what to do.
Won't you help me? Write Box XX, Palo Alto.
If newspapers published the results of their ads, I'd certainly be
interested to find out how some of those big executives make out with
that kind.of ad which usually goes something like this:
Confident, aggressive, successful air lines president and family
of five desperately need mansion near Palo Alto. Finest refer
ences. Will pay five years in advance and hire gardener. Price
not important. Phone S.F. 1325, extensions 10, 12, 18, or 108
between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.; Chicago, UN-1874, 10-11 p.m.; New
York, BU-8-999X, 4:00-5:00 a.m.
I've often wondered why somebody who sounded that impressive didn't
go out and buy himself a home, but maybe it was because he wanted
ta see a nice description of himself in print.
It seems to me that you have to make an ad sound serious but not
overwrought. You have to get over, in five cold lines of small print, all
the facts that might catch a landlord's eye. I suppose, for instance, that
I should say that I'm a veteran, but how about that? Does that mean
anyhing any more? Then I imagine I should say that we have no pets
or children, and yet I wish I could add that I think pets are fine and
children wonderful, but think how cloying that would sound.
Maybe, actually, people are tired of serious ads, and perhaps a
frivolous one would do the trick, something like:
Horrible Stanford couple demand small house or apt. Hate
pets and children. Love to smash furniture, smoke, drink, and
throw wild parties. Will always be late paying the rent. No
references.
Okay. But anyway, all I want is some suggestions as to how to go
about this ad. If you can't help there, then I might consider an apart
ment itself an adequate substitute.
And incidentally, Mr. Endsley, tell Pool this was your idea, so he
won't send me a bill for—how many lines is it?

Can anybody tell me how to ecmpeFe an ad? You see, my wife and
I are trying to find an apartment or house, and I know that the right
kind of ad would bring some results. But what's the right kind?
I'm sure that, first of all, you have to intimate that you're a little
better than everybody else who's looking for an apartment, but, space

rates being what they are, you can hardly afford a
two-column exposition. No, you just have to settle
for a couple of indicative adjectives, like "mature"
or "quiet" or "affable." But you have to go easy,
because otherwise someone might think you're im
modest. Then it's my notion that you want to stay
away from words like "desperate," even if you feel
that way, because some landlord might be scared off
by this. "Desperate" won't wring anybody's heart;
