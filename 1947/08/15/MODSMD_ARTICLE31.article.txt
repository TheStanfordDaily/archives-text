# Be Funny! Conner Says
## 
### 
"Can you be funny?" Jim Con
ner, editor of the Chaparral, asked
the Stanford Farm today. "If you
can," he went on, "the Chaparral
wants you."
The fall issues are being plan
ned, he explained, and the editors
are in the market for "real tre
mendously hilariously funny stuff"
to fill them.
"Stories, articles, and blurbs
from 50 to 1,200 words," he said,
"poems and cartoons. If you can't
write or draw don't let it worry
youâ€”we have an editor who can
help you if you'll bring in the
idea."
"Incidentally," he added, "there
is plenty of room for anyone who
wants to work on the magazine.
We don't have a sot try-out sys
tem, you just come down and go
to work and what you don't know
we teach you."
An editor will be in the Chapar
ral ofTices every day next week
from 10 to 11 a.m. and from 4 to
5 p.m. Contributions can also be
mailed to the Chaparral, Stanford,
Calif., Conner explained.
The new Chaparral ofTices are
in the Old Roble Pool building,
which also contains the Quad of
fices, he said. Chaparral's en
trance is in the rear.
