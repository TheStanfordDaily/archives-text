						Strength Is People, Not Armies, Says teller

The strength of the United Na
tions, in the last analysis, will
come not from money or armies
or governments but from the peo
ple, Abraham H. Feller, general
counsel and director of the UN
legal department, said last night
at Cubberley Auditorium.
Speaking at a lecture sponsored
by the University and the World
Affairs Council of Northern Cali
fornia, Mr. Feller pointed out that
the United Nations is not a world
government of independent pow
ers.
"Its funds, its personnel, its
powers, and the armed forces
which may eventually be needed
to enforce its decisions, derive
from its members. If the nations
which have strength make it
strong, it will be strong. If they
deny it support, it will be weak,"
he declared.
"The UN needs time," he stated,
noting that last Aug. 8 marked the
second anniversary of the ratifica
tion by the United States of the
United Nations Charter.
"We have our troubles, but have
you ever considered the troubles
which the United States had in the
first two years of its life?"
Mr. Feller reminded the audi
ence that the framers of the char
ter saw the conclusion of a peace
with the enemy states before the
United Nations could really begin
functioning. Until that happens
only the most tentative judgments
on the effectiveness of the organi
zation can be reached.
Mr. Feller emphasized that it is
basic to any understanding of the
United Nations to be perfectly
clear on the fact that the organi
zation was not created to make the
peace; it was empowered to keep
the peace after it was made by
the powers themselves.
"Oyer and over again it has
been stressed that the United Na
tions cannot begin to function as
its creators intended until the
peace treaties have been conclud
ed, the armies of occupation with
drawn. and some stability of fron
tiers and governments achieved,"
he declared.
But given support of member
nations and time to fulfill its
promise, the United Nations still
needs the support of the people, he
declared.
"While the United Nations is

not a government, it is a symbol
and an idea—the symbol and idea
of a world of peace and security.
No matter how large and power
ful the armies and navies which
may eventually be made available
to the Security Council under Ar
ticle 43 of the charter, they will
never be more powerful than the
idea.
''I hope that no one here will
think I am retreating into mysti
cism. We Americans know the
unquestioning obedience which
the decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court command, though it can
muster no more than one marshal
to enforce them.
"I doubt if they would stand one
whit better if Congress voted the
Chief Justice an armored division
and a fleet of superfortresses. The
idea of the United Nations must
stay strong and grow stronger.
"If the United Nations receives
these things Avhich it needs, it will
meet the test, and the bold deter
mination of the preamble will
come to pass—'to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of
war, which twice in our lifetime
has brought untold sorrow to
mankind.'"
''I believe that these things will
come to pass and that the test
will be met. It will happen be
cause there is no alternative. The
United Nations is here and at
work. It is far from perfect, but
there is nothing else. The United
Nations will do what is assigned
to it if the people and their gov
ernments want the job done. I am
certain that they do and that the
job will be done," he concluded.
Mr. Feller, who served as gen
eral counsel of UNRRA from 1944
to 1945 and as general counsel of
the Office of War Information from
1942 to 1944, was introduced by
Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the Stan
ford Law School, vice-president of
the World Affairs Council. The
moderator of the question and an
swer period which followed the
talk in Cubberley Auditorium was
Dr. Eugene Staley, World Affairs
Council educational director.
Mr. Feller, who is teaching a
summer course on international
relations in the Stanford Law
School, reviewed the accomplish
ments of the Assembly, the Secu
rity Council, and other branches
of the United Nations during the
first two years of operations.
