## History 1947 
### 
Mr. Bob Ruark of Scripps-How
ard has finally learned the facts of
life. Evidently some wise person
has taken him aside and whispered
into his ear a few pertinent and
valuable facts about birds, bees,

military brass,
and other in
sects. Mr. Ruark
has obviously
taken his new
lesson to heart,
because he has
trained all his
heavy artillery
on Lt. General
John "Court
House" Lee and

given himself the command lo fire
at will.
'Twas not ever thus. I have
been following Ruark's column al
most every day since he got out
of the Navy—where he was an of
ficer. More than once he has min
imized the gripes of enlisted men,
inferring that the bulk of them
were unjustified. He had been
successfully indoctrinated by the
Navy's doctrine of RHIP. Trans
lated, that means Rank Has Its
Privileges. That's not strange;
when a man hears every day over
a period of years that he is better,
stronger, smarter, handsomer than
his fellows—on a higher plane, as
it were—sooner or later he'll begin
to believe it.
But I'm not trying to start an
argument about the relative mer
its of officers vs. enlisted men;

there were swell guys and there
were stinkers in both groups (and
probably in about the same pro
portion, too—but when an officer
is a stinker he has a much better
opportunity to let people know
about it). What I'm trying to do
is point out that Ruark belongs to
the other side and wouldn't think
of attacking his own class unless
he saw something so rotten it
turned his stomach.
The tipofl to Ruark's attitude
comes, I believe, in the following
words:
"As a former officer I always
smugly believed that rank had
some privileges, but after observ
ing the lordly living of General
Lee and his flock, I am about to
change my mind. You can run a
privilege into, the ground, espe
cially when it is used, for com
pletely selfish purposes."
To restate Ruark's point, privi
lege should not become license.
If you have been following Ru
ark's columns, you know what a
corrupt mess he has uncovered.
He has pulled out all the stops and
gone to town on an unholy situ
ation. One should not get the idea
tha' such office. - s as he describes
are typical of the Army; neither
should one decide that this is just
an isolated cat,e —far from it.
The situation is similar to those
which arise all too often. They
arise, I think, because too many
men receive commissions who are
unfit to be officers. Any man who

lakes advantage of his position to
grab more than his share of what
ever gravy there may he is unfit
to hold any position of authority.
All of this could be cleaned up
easily if it weren't for the old tra
dition that officers are somehow
inviolable and perhaps even allied
with God. But the gang sticks to
gether. Many officers hate the ac
tions of some of their less moral
brethren, but they firmly believe
that they are acting "for the good
of the service" when they take out
the brush and apply the coat of
whitewash.
The enlisted man is in a differ
ent position. He is generally ex
pected to be a foul ball—especially
by civilians who know nothing at
all about the service — and every
time he gets out of line he gets
slapped down with a court mar
tial. And he's very seldom ac
quitted.
In that condition rests the
weakness of the so-called caste
system—the fact that when an of
ficer gets out of line he more often
than not gets whitewashed while
an enlisted man in the same situ
ation gets the mouldy fig. I don't
think the privilege of rank should
be granted to enlisted men. Rath
er it should be made next to im
possible for such "gentlemen" (by
act of Congress) as Court House
Lee to exchange privilege for li
cense with impunity.
Perhaps Bob Ruark's columns
will help; I certainly hope so—
"for the good of the service."

To restate Ruark's point, privi
lege should not become license.
If you have been following Ru
ark's columns, you know what a
corrupt mess he has uncovered.
He has pulled out all the stops and
gone to town on an unholy situ
ation. One should not get the idea
tha' such office. - s as he describes
are typical of the Army; neither
should one decide that this is just
an isolated cat,e —far from it.
The situation is similar to those
which arise all too often. They
arise, I think, because too many
men receive commissions who are
unfit to be officers. Any man who

lakes advantage of his position to
grab more than his share of what
ever gravy there may he is unfit
to hold any position of authority.
All of this could be cleaned up
easily if it weren't for the old tra
dition that officers are somehow
inviolable and perhaps even allied
with God. But the gang sticks to
gether. Many officers hate the ac
tions of some of their less moral
brethren, but they firmly believe
that they are acting "for the good
of the service" when they take out
the brush and apply the coat of
whitewash.
The enlisted man is in a differ
ent position. He is generally ex
pected to be a foul ball—especially
by civilians who know nothing at
all about the service — and every
time he gets out of line he gets
slapped down with a court mar
tial. And he's very seldom ac
quitted.
In that condition rests the
weakness of the so-called caste
system—the fact that when an of
ficer gets out of line he more often
than not gets whitewashed while
an enlisted man in the same situ
ation gets the mouldy fig. I don't
think the privilege of rank should
be granted to enlisted men. Rath
er it should be made next to im
possible for such "gentlemen" (by
act of Congress) as Court House
Lee to exchange privilege for li
cense with impunity.
Perhaps Bob Ruark's columns
will help; I certainly hope so—
"for the good of the service."

Mr. Bob Ruark of Scripps-How
ard has finally learned the facts of
life. Evidently some wise person
has taken him aside and whispered
into his ear a few pertinent and
valuable facts about birds, bees,

military brass,
and other in
sects. Mr. Ruark
has obviously
taken his new
lesson to heart,
because he has
trained all his
heavy artillery
on Lt. General
John "Court
House" Lee and

given himself the command lo fire
at will.
'Twas not ever thus. I have
been following Ruark's column al
most every day since he got out
of the Navy—where he was an of
ficer. More than once he has min
imized the gripes of enlisted men,
inferring that the bulk of them
were unjustified. He had been
successfully indoctrinated by the
Navy's doctrine of RHIP. Trans
lated, that means Rank Has Its
Privileges. That's not strange;
when a man hears every day over
a period of years that he is better,
stronger, smarter, handsomer than
his fellows—on a higher plane, as
it were—sooner or later he'll begin
to believe it.
But I'm not trying to start an
argument about the relative mer
its of officers vs. enlisted men;

there were swell guys and there
were stinkers in both groups (and
probably in about the same pro
portion, too—but when an officer
is a stinker he has a much better
opportunity to let people know
about it). What I'm trying to do
is point out that Ruark belongs to
the other side and wouldn't think
of attacking his own class unless
he saw something so rotten it
turned his stomach.
The tipofl to Ruark's attitude

system—the fact that when an of
ficer gets out of line he more often
than not gets whitewashed while
an enlisted man in the same situ
ation gets the mouldy fig. I don't
think the privilege of rank should
be granted to enlisted men. Rath
er it should be made next to im
possible for such "gentlemen" (by
act of Congress) as Court House
Lee to exchange privilege for li
cense with impunity.
Perhaps Bob Ruark's columns
will help; I certainly hope so—
"for the good of the service."
