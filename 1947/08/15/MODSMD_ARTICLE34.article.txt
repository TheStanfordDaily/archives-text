# Cast, Selling of Doll's House' Capture 19th Century Spirit
## 
### 
Patricia Neilson carried the Studio Theater players over the
top for a sell-out performance of Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll's House"
Wednesday evening in the Little Theater with her portrayal of
Nora Helmer.
Playing to an SRO audience, Miss Neilson, with wit and good

grace, made Ibsen's outdated hero
ine into someone friore than just a
part of a "pattern for playwrighting

structure." Miss
Neilson was vei'y
well cast — both
in appearance and
manner — for her
role, characteriz
ing with equal
ease the twitter
ing doll bride and
the mature wife.
Allen Fletcher,
as Nora's husband,
Torvald, turned in
a properly pomp
ous performance
as a man both

overbearing and indulgent. Cast in
a role which might easily have de
generated into mere masterful shout
ing, Fletcher added enough insight
and humor to his characterization
to remind one that Torvald Helmer
might easily be the man sitting next
to you.
As Christine Linde, Patricia Bar
rett worked a bit too hard at being
noble to be really convincing. Part
j of the unfavorable impression may
i have stemmed from Miss Barrett s
make-up, which was applied in such
a way that her expression appeared
the same, no matter what emotion
she was trying to put over.
Shields Logsdon showed promise
as Dr. Rank, but unfortunately did
not carry his characterization far
; enough, especially in his earlier
i scenes.
Applause goes to graduate stu
dent Mel Ellett for outstanding de
sign and direction of 4 'A Doll's
House." Completely capturing the
19th-century atmosphere of horse
hair and red plush, the setting and
I players were all that Ibsen could
have asked. —Lawrence
