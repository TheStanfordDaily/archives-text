Two graduate students in the De

figure prominently in a coast-to
coast broadcast over the National
Broadcasting Company network to
morrow from 12 to 12:30 p.m., the Of
fice of Information said yesterday.
Carol Boettcher will play the lead
feminine role in the comedy-ro
mance, "Scotch and So Diverting,"
written by her fellow student, Mar
tin Nalder. The play will be heard
locally over KPO as the final pre
sentation of the fifth Stanford Sum
mer Radio Institute.
Nalder's play was selected as the
prize-winning entry for the broad
cast among contributions from stu
dents in the Institute's radio-writing
class. The Institute, sponsored by
the University and NBC is an eight
week program of training in radio
work.
Institute members will make up
the cast for the play, the In
formation Office said. Miss Boet
tcher will play the part of Diane,
who finds herself in love with a
Scotch ghost, in a castle she has in
herited.
