"She dwelt among the untrodden

—Wordsworth
* * *
Marilyn Sahner is a perfect as
semblage of beauty, plus a combina
tion of resolute dreams and a sense
of inborn reality. She's* also the
girl they call "Sugar."
"I've been called 'Sugar' ever
since I was a little girl," Sugar said,
"in fact, I can't remember when I
haven't been called by that name."
Sugar was born in a verdant part
of the world called Brooklyn and
spent most of her life on Long
Island, prompting her to remark, "I
still love the East, mind you. 1 miss
the snow."
She laughs easily and has an en
gaging smile fraught with a kind of
magnetic lure one can imagine
capable of a young lady who is a
former John Powers model agency
protege.
"How'd you learn to swim, Su
gar? Somebody throw you in Long
Island Sound?"
"It would seem that way," she
said, "but when I was very little,
my uncle taught me how to swim."
"You must get tired of swimming,"
we said. "How'd you like to have a
dollar for every yard you've swum?"
TALK OF RETIREMENT
She leaned forward a bit, her
brown eyes widened, and smiling,
she countered, "I'd love it. Any
way, I'm planning to retire after the'
Olympics."
Sugar moved to San Francisco in
November, 1944, following a national
swimming meet. She's not what you'd
call .an "aqua malahini," for she
has swum competitively for the past
seven years.
For one who cherishes orchids,
gardenias, and a color called "hunt
ers' green," Sugar revolves in a
satiny dream nurtured by the ap
proaching '48 Olympic Games. She
trains hard and honestly for a swim
mer and currently dwells in the
shadow of her Crystal Plunge team
mate, Ann Curtis.
NIX PIX CONTRACT
Sugar assumes no mask of tem
perament, but confesses she has a
disposition that at times nears the
explosive stage. We brought up the
subject of her entering the movies.
"Not for me," she replied, "how
ever (pause) I Wouldn't turn down
any contract."
"What'll happen when you quit
swimming?"
"I'll try golfing . . .
. . . golfing," we boomed. "You
can't be serious?"
She winced graciously dismissing
the topic with: "Of course, I'm just
a beginner!"
There is a note of gaiety in Su
gar's voice which displaces an oc
casional cascade of sober realism.
She would have you know that a
swimmer's life is no dais of dahlias.
"Some day I'd like to write a
book on just how much work there
is to being a swimmer—training and
well, you know."
NATIONALS NEXT WEEK
We peered at the Sahner body
sealed inside a smart, dark suit or
dress or what-have-you, a water
melon-colored, fuchsia, cerise-tinged
coat draped about her shoulders.
She'll leave tomorrow morning for
the AAU women's outdoor national
swimming meet at Chicago slated
next Friday through Sunday. Then
a brief six day reunion with the
Eastern branch of the Sahners.
The Crystal Plunge squad, of
which Sugar is a member, is the
nation's best women's swimming en
semble bar none. Paced by the
Misses Sahner and Curtis, the squad
also includes Joan Mallory, Patsy
Elsener, Joyce McCrae, Margie
Hayes, Donna Maddock, Jean Grutz
macher, Rose Kaufman, and Marian
Olson.
When Sugar returns to San Fran
cisco in two weeks, we'll be on hand
with a garland of orchids, Podesta
and Baldocchi style, and there'll be
a volleying sound in the wind—
"That's the girl, all right. The
one they call 'Sugar,'"

NIX PIX CONTRACT
Sugar assumes no mask of tem
perament, but confesses she has a
disposition that at times nears the
explosive stage. We brought up the
subject of her entering the movies.
"Not for me," she replied, "how
ever (pause) I Wouldn't turn down
any contract."
"What'll happen when you quit
swimming?"
"I'll try golfing . . .
. . . golfing," we boomed. "You
can't be serious?"
She winced graciously dismissing
the topic with: "Of course, I'm just
a beginner!"
There is a note of gaiety in Su
gar's voice which displaces an oc
casional cascade of sober realism.
She would have you know that a
swimmer's life is no dais of dahlias.
"Some day I'd like to write a
book on just how much work there
is to being a swimmer—training and
well, you know."
NATIONALS NEXT WEEK
We peered at the Sahner body
sealed inside a smart, dark suit or
dress or what-have-you, a water
melon-colored, fuchsia, cerise-tinged
coat draped about her shoulders.
She'll leave tomorrow morning for
the AAU women's outdoor national
swimming meet at Chicago slated
next Friday through Sunday. Then
a brief six day reunion with the
Eastern branch of the Sahners.
The Crystal Plunge squad, of
which Sugar is a member, is the
nation's best women's swimming en
semble bar none. Paced by the
Misses Sahner and Curtis, the squad
also includes Joan Mallory, Patsy
Elsener, Joyce McCrae, Margie
Hayes, Donna Maddock, Jean Grutz
macher, Rose Kaufman, and Marian
Olson.
When Sugar returns to San Fran
cisco in two weeks, we'll be on hand
with a garland of orchids, Podesta
and Baldocchi style, and there'll be
a volleying sound in the wind—
"That's the girl, all right. The

Marilyn Sahner is a perfect as
semblage of beauty, plus a combina
tion of resolute dreams and a sense
of inborn reality. She's* also the
girl they call "Sugar."
"I've been called 'Sugar' ever
since I was a little girl," Sugar said,
"in fact, I can't remember when I
haven't been called by that name."
Sugar was born in a verdant part
of the world called Brooklyn and
spent most of her life on Long
Island, prompting her to remark, "I
still love the East, mind you. 1 miss
the snow."
She laughs easily and has an en
gaging smile fraught with a kind of
magnetic lure one can imagine
capable of a young lady who is a
former John Powers model agency
protege.
"How'd you learn to swim, Su
gar? Somebody throw you in Long
Island Sound?"
"It would seem that way," she
said, "but when I was very little,
my uncle taught me how to swim."
"You must get tired of swimming,"
we said. "How'd you like to have a
dollar for every yard you've swum?"
TALK OF RETIREMENT
She leaned forward a bit, her
brown eyes widened, and smiling,
she countered, "I'd love it. Any
way, I'm planning to retire after the'
Olympics."
Sugar moved to San Francisco in
November, 1944, following a national
swimming meet. She's not what you'd
call .an "aqua malahini," for she
has swum competitively for the past
seven years.
For one who cherishes orchids,
gardenias, and a color called "hunt
ers' green," Sugar revolves in a
satiny dream nurtured by the ap
proaching '48 Olympic Games. She
trains hard and honestly for a swim
mer and currently dwells in the
