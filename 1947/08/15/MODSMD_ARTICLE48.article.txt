## 
### BILL WARDEN 
Phi Psi and Kappa Alpha ended the summer quarter intra
mural Softball play yesterday in a deadlock for first place. The
two teams, each sporting a "6 and 1" record, will meet in a play
off game Monday afternoon at :15 on the intramural diamond.
The Phi Psi club went into their final game of the season with

an undefeated record, but they were
unable to cope with the efforts of
ATO hurler Jack Bradshaw and
went down to defeat by the score of
7 to 1.
Had the Phi Psi team taken yes
terday's game, they would have an
nexed the league's top spot.
"Steve" Stephenson of the losers
hurled a good game, but the Alpha
Tau Omega boys got to him for a
run in the first inning on a base hit
and an error, and after that, they
were never seriously threatened.
Wednesday's game saw co-cham
pion Phi Psi knock Phi Delta Theta
oft by a score of 5 to 2. At the same
time, the ATO team was taking the
measure of the fading Firehouse out
fit by the count of 3 to 1.
