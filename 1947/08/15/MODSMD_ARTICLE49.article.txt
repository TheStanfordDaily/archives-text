### 
NEW YORK. Aug. 14 (UP).—
Brooklyn, pulling out of its disas
trous slump, beat the Boston Braves
today, 1 to 0, and increased its league
lead to 4 1 j games over the Cardinals,
who lost to Pittsburgh, 5 to 3.
Vic Lombardi beat Warren Spahn
in a battle of lefties as the Dodgers
won their second straight from the
Braves. Lombardi allowed four hits
and Spahn six, two in the eighth in
ning as Brooklyn got its run. Ed
Stanky opened with a single, took
second on Jackie Robinson's sacri
fice and scored on Carl Furillo's
single.
Ralph Kiner and Jim Bloodworth
starred at bat as the Pirates nipped
St. Louis. Kiner's three-run homer
in the first inning—his 30th four
bagger—gave the Bucs an early lead,
and after the Cards had fought
back to a tie, Pittsburgh won in the
sixth inning on Bloodworth's single
which drove Kiner and Hank Green
berg home. Fritz Ostermueller
pitched the route for Pittsburgh, and
Murry Dickson was the losing
hurler.
