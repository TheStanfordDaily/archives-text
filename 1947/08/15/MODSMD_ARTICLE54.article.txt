# Daily Scribes Wrangle Over Card Rooters' Roost
## Separate Men, TV omen Saturday Afternoons 
### BOB CATUDIO 
We love Rita Hay worth, Daisy
Mae, the White Rock bubble water
girl, and a lew Stanford women . . .
BUT—
Keep 'em out of the rooting sec
tions on Saturday afternoons!
Sure! Bring your girl to the Stan
ford Stadium, but take a leave of
absence down near the 10-yard line
so both of you might gaze undis
turbed at the scene of action.
We prefer segregated rooting sec
tions—women on one side, men on
the other.
CUTE EYES AND WAVY HAIR
"Listen, Claudette, I tell ya that
"89" has the cutest eyes. And isn't
"23" got the waviest hair? Oh, golly,
I forgot to bring a lipstick with me!
By the way, who's ahead?"
Let 'em wave the pom poms, let
'em shriek and scream in contralto
tones . . . just let 'em alone.
"Does the reserve always play in
the line, Claudie? Gee, hope Lud
wig asks me to the Toyon formal
tonight. He's got the cutest Cadil
lac."
Let 'em chew gum and cross their
legs, let 'em talk of permanent waves
and cute halfbacks . . . just let 'em
alone.
HUSBANDS ARE SO SWEET
"Janie, dear, guess what? Millie's
gonna have a baby. Yes! Isn't that
wonderful. And Nat's the sweetest
husband. So devoted. Say . . . what's
the score? We scored a touchback.
Is that good?"
Segregated rooting sections, please!
Rita, Daisy, the babe on the rock,
and a few Farmyard chicks . . . BUT
Keep 'em out of the rooting sec
tion.


GOVERNOR EARL WARREN (center) last year presented the
Stanford Axe to Card Marty Anderson (left) while Bear Ed Welch
(right) looks on. The question now—besides the usual "Will Stanford
keep the Axe?"—is what to do with Farm rooting sections this coming
season? Two Daily writers battle it out in adjoining columns 011 this
matter of "segregating the sexes."
