The Chronicle's Bill Leiser is usually right,
But this lime he failed to see the iight!
As one sports editor to another (joke), we have always looked up to
the Chronicle's Bill Leiser as the best west of the Mississippi, to say the
least.
Only very seldom have we disagreed with his opinion or argument,
for mostly we have nodded our head in parrot-fashion and uttered an
enthusiastic "right"!
But in Mr. Leiser's column of yesterday morning, we struck several
statements that we must take exception to, and in no uncertain terms.
Commenting on the difficulties of a college football player, who must
both study and practice his sport, Mr. Leiser infers that anyone smart
enough to pass a college entrance exam in English is also smart enough
to- earn a "straight 'A'" average in college if he is willing to spend six
hours a day at studies—three hours in class and three hours on the outside.
l ough to Make I'hi Bete These Days
Mr._Leiser continues that "mighty few students actually devote three
hours outside of class to study each day. Those who do usually make Phi
Beta Kappa."
No, Mr. Leiser, we're afraid college is not quite that simple any more.
Those conditions held true back in 1937 or 1938, maybe, but nowadays, at
Stanford at least, students are "expected" to devote a minimum of two
hours of outside study for every classroom hour.
Furthermore, not all students, by any means, who devote that much
time to studies make Phi Bete. The reasons for these changes are, we
think, repdily explainable.
Grads in our University are allotted not on an absolute basis, but on
what is known as the "Stanford curve*" or on a relative basis of class
average. If the average students study five hours a day, for example, and
average 60 per cent on their tests, then those will be the "C" students,
and "A's" and "B's" will go to those that either study more or make more
than GO per cent on their tests.
llik< From "C's" to "FV'
One certain class, back in 1938, used to average about 35 per cent on
(heir tests, with the result that those students averaeing 35 per cent got
"C's"; that same class today flunks students making 35 per cent averages,
and gives "C's" to 65 per centers.
So much for statistics —but the backbone of the matter is that averages
and study-times have increased, in line with the inflationary trend, so
that Mr. Leiser's figures no longer hold true.
And the retflon this change has taken place is all too obvious—Stanford
(as well as other campuses) is flooded with older veterans who are study
ing more seriously than ever and with more earnestness than ever.
A football player can still play ball and make Phi Bete in college—but
he is no longer "any young high school graduate" but rather a very bril
liant student who is very much the exception on today's campus.

and study-times have increased, in line with the inflationary trend, so
that Mr. Leiser's figures no longer hold true.
And the retflon this change has taken place is all too obvious—Stanford
(as well as other campuses) is flooded with older veterans who are study
ing more seriously than ever and with more earnestness than ever.
A football player can still play ball and make Phi Bete in college—but
he is no longer "any young high school graduate" but rather a very bril
liant student who is very much the exception on today's campus.
The Chronicle's Bill Leiser is usually right,
But this lime he failed to see the iight!
As one sports editor to another (joke), we have always looked up to
the Chronicle's Bill Leiser as the best west of the Mississippi, to say the
least.
Only very seldom have we disagreed with his opinion or argument,
for mostly we have nodded our head in parrot-fashion and uttered an
enthusiastic "right"!
But in Mr. Leiser's column of yesterday morning, we struck several
statements that we must take exception to, and in no uncertain terms.
Commenting on the difficulties of a college football player, who must
both study and practice his sport, Mr. Leiser infers that anyone smart
enough to pass a college entrance exam in English is also smart enough
to- earn a "straight 'A'" average in college if he is willing to spend six
hours a day at studies—three hours in class and three hours on the outside.
l ough to Make I'hi Bete These Days
Mr._Leiser continues that "mighty few students actually devote three
hours outside of class to study each day. Those who do usually make Phi
Beta Kappa."
No, Mr. Leiser, we're afraid college is not quite that simple any more.
Those conditions held true back in 1937 or 1938, maybe, but nowadays, at
Stanford at least, students are "expected" to devote a minimum of two
hours of outside study for every classroom hour.
Furthermore, not all students, by any means, who devote that much
time to studies make Phi Bete. The reasons for these changes are, we
think, repdily explainable.
Grads in our University are allotted not on an absolute basis, but on
what is known as the "Stanford curve*" or on a relative basis of class
average. If the average students study five hours a day, for example, and
average 60 per cent on their tests, then those will be the "C" students,
and "A's" and "B's" will go to those that either study more or make more
than GO per cent on their tests.
llik< From "C's" to "FV'
One certain class, back in 1938, used to average about 35 per cent on
(heir tests, with the result that those students averaeing 35 per cent got
"C's"; that same class today flunks students making 35 per cent averages,
and gives "C's" to 65 per centers.
So much for statistics —but the backbone of the matter is that averages
and study-times have increased, in line with the inflationary trend, so
that Mr. Leiser's figures no longer hold true.
