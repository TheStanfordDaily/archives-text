# Love and Sunshine Are Football Madness Musts
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Segregated sexes at home football
games? It's okay if you go with
your roommates. But we are a little
odd down here on the Farm. For
some odd reason or other, some
Roughs insist on taking dates to
watch our grid machine roll.
But since one's date usually is a
member of the opposite sex, they are
separated at the stadium gate into
male-female rooting sections. Why?
To give the sections more class,
more style.
DISH OUT THE DOUGH
Oh, but you can sit with your
campus dish if you shell out sev
eral shekels. Under that arrange
ment you buy tickets along with
the Palo Alto proletariat and sit
with them in the ten cent seats.
''Do your dating at night," my
opponent may scream. Buddy, the
excitement shared at that crucial
game erases all tenseness from two
lovers, and it is the beginning of a
beautiful friendship. Yes, the ice is
broken at the football game.
SEGREGATION OKAY
But I don't propose complete abo
lition of segregated rooting sec
tions. I don't look upon it as sex
discrimination, if there is such a
pracf ice.
I would like to see the football
brass and/or Cardinals concede two
points to Stanford lovers.
First, let them in the gates free on
their student body cards, or at the
same price as segregated students.
Second, give the kids seats in the
six bits section. Create a special
rooter's section for dates adjacent
to the men's or women's sections.
It's a cinch our lovers will never
raise their almighty voices around
somnambulant Palo Altoans if they
must sit in the worker's section.
