# Holland Is No Longer 'Vacationers Paradise'; Threatened Loss of Colonies Causes Concern
## 
### LAWRENCE GRANNIS 
(Special to The Daily)
Stanford students today would
not find Holland a vacationer's par
adise. They wouldn't — for the
Netherlands have not yet l'epaired
the economic and physical damage
wrought by years of war and occu
pation.
Moreover, they are now faced
with the loss of their colonial pos
sessions — the mainspring of their
prosperity for years past. Hence
their task is a double one—revive
and rebuild at home and find eco
nomic substitutes for their colonies
overseas.
Right now it's anybody's guess if
they will succeed—if Holland can
come back before the assets abroad
she is now liquidating (to finance
foreign purchases) are exhausted.
In short, it is a huge gamble, and I
gathered from the businessmen I
met that the odds are about the
same as drawing to an inside
straight at poker.
FAMILIAR PATTERN
In terms of everyday life, it
means that the familiar Western
European pattern is repeated in
Holland — stringent rations, high
prices and higher taxes, shortages,
and black markets.
The experiences of Franz and
Connie, a young couple I visited at
The Hague, are fairly representa
tive. Connie is an American girl
and an ex-Wave; Franz, a young
lieutenant in the Dutch navy. They

met when Franz passed through ;
Mare Island after three years as a
POW in Japan—but on arrival in
the Netherlands, any similarity
their story might have to those you
see in the Pond's Soap ads abruptly
ceased.
They found an apartment only af
ter months of searching: two rooms
and a half-beth plus a small room
Franz made into a kitchen. (When
they want to take a bath they ride
the trolley across the city to the
apartment of Franz's mother.)
FEW FACILITIES
Connie does her cooking on a
couple of burners. There is no re
frigerator, nor is there any hot wa
ter. At that, they feel exceptionally
lucky to have found the place; while
the government limits each couple
to two rooms (three with children),
many are still homeless.
Despite the fact that Franz gets
slightly larger rations because of
his navy service, food is a constant
problem. Meat, sugar, coffee, fats,
and even cheese are all but missing

from the menu. Fish and bread are j
fairly plentiful, and in summer
there are many fresh vegetables in
the markets.
Whil they laugh about it now, last
winter was a trying ordeal. The
scanty coal ration combined with
an especially bitter winter forced
them literally to live in one room.
Connie would put on her heavy coat
and step into the kitchen only long
enough to cook. The crowning blow
fell when the water taps froze; for
weeks the only water they had was
contained in two buckets hauled up
from three flights below.
DUTCH BETTER OFF
With all this, Franz and Connie
count themselves lucky to be living
in Holland rather than in the neigh
boring states of Western Europe,
excepting Belgium. And it is true
that there are more plentiful and
more varied foods in Holland than
in England, and at much lower
prices than in France. Compared to
nearby Germany, Holland seems al
most flourishing. At least there is
no hunger as there is in Berlin and,
to a- lesser degree, in Paris.
About the future, Franz is hope
j ful but not really optimistic be
cause Holland's position, at best, is
| shaky. But if stolid patience, cour
age, and energy count in the Europe
of 1947, the hopes of Franz and his
countrymen may be rewarded—and
this once-rich country may regain
to a reasonable degree its former
prosperity.
