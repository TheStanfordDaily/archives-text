Weather-beaten circular benches
that had played host to students for
some 10 or 15 years have "hit the
road" for the Corporation Yard, ac
cording to Fred O. Glover, Univer
sity publicity director.
NEW AND GREEN
In place of the former tree-cir
cling benches, the Yard installed
newly painted green park benches,
the likes of which can't be found
this side of the Palo Alto Commu
nity Center.
Glover noted that the new bench
es may become permanent land
marks within the islands, depending
on their use. The circular benches
will be repaired and held in stor
age until a later date.
VARIED USES
Since the trees and bushes first
re, ched heights high enough to pro
vide shade within the islands, stu
dents, faculty members, and Uni
versity secretaries have used the
historic benches while taking exams,
bull sessioning, or eating lunch.
Fellows with their dates whiled
away the last minutes of their
"coke" dates Sunday through
Thursday nights within the confines
of the islands.
Now a new generation of benches
has arrived and may stay a while—
providing some house on campus
does not throw another "park"
dance.
