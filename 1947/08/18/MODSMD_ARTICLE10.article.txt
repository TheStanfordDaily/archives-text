# FTC Hits Steel On Rate Fixing
## Government Charges Industry with Illegal Price Action; Report Says Competition Killed 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UP). â€”The government fired a
broadside against high prices tonight by charging the huge iron
and steel industry with illegally conspiring to fix and maintain
prices.
A Federal Trade Commission complaint against the American

Iron and Steel Institute and its 100-
odd members charged that they had
destroyed competition and penalized
steel consumers by fixing identical
prices.
PROHIBITED REDUCTION
It contended that the industry's
pricing system has prohibited mem
bers from reducing prices.
The Iron and Steel Institute repre
sents virtually all of the steel indus
try, which the FTC described as the
"basic industry of the nation." In
addition to the institute and its mem
bers, the complaint specifically
named 26 corporations, representing
80 percent of the nation's steel ingot
producing capacity.
The government pointed to the
steel rise in July as proof that these
producers controlled and manipu
lated the market through the insti
tute.
SUPPORTED INCREASE
It is said that "producer-respon
dents collectively supported that in
crease through the officers of the
institute." Producers themselves, it
said, estimated the increase at "hun
dreds of millions of dollars."
The commission's action was the
first concrete step taken by the ad
ministration in its drive to force
prices down. The complaint, how
ever, may not have any immediate
effect, if long litigation results.
BEGINS INVESTIGATION
The Justice Department, which
has begun an investigation to deter
mine whether there is any conspir
acy to maintain or raise prices, is
not directly involved in the FTC
action. The FTC Act does not pro

vide as harsh penalties as the Sher
man Anti-Trust Act which is en
forced by the Justice Department.
It was learned, meanwhile, that
FTC has completed a preliminary
report on the general price situa
tion which was sent to the White
House and returned for recommen
dations. The report is understood to
propose action against some price
fixing practices which, although they
are not outright violations, come very
close to it.
