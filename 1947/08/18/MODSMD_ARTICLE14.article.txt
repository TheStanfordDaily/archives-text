# US Charges Hungarians Using Illegal Procedures

### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UP).—The United States today
bluntly charged the Hungarian government with resorting to
"flimsy and illegal pretexts" to exclude non-communist voters
from the coming national elections.
The State Department said the obvious aim of the communist

dominated Hungarian government is
'o assure control of the new legisla
ture "regardless of the outcome of
♦he balloting." The elections are
scheduled for Aug. 31.
NECESSARY STEPS
Selden Chapin, American Minister
'o Hungary, was instructed to seek
an interview with Hungarian Prime
Minister Legos Dinyes. He is "to
urge him to take all necessary steps
on behalf of his government to cor
rect the prevailing electoral abuses."
The department added that it is
'understood" that the British are
l aking similar steps.
Reports based on the non-com
nunist Hungarian press indicate
that 20 percent of the electorate —
or about one million Hungarians—
have already lost their voting rights,
'he department said. In some dis
tricts, the exclusions have reached
70 per cent, it added.
\MERICAN INTERESTS
The department said that Ameri
can interest in the election is based
on the Hungarian peace treaty. That
document guarantees all Hungarian
citizens "the enjoyment of human
rights and the fundamental free
doms, including freedom of political
opinion," it explained.
The United States previously has
sharply criticized the Hungarian
government for its efforts to sup
press opposition parties and for its
restrictions on civil liberties.
It contended in its statement to
day that the reasons given for dis
franchising non-communist voters
were "grotesque."


FERENC NAGY, ex-Premier of
Hungary, Saturday used "Voice
of America" radio to ask his coun
trymen to resist Communism by
boycotting the coming Hungarian
elections.
