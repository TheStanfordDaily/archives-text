# U.S., Russia Face Test
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UP).—
The United States and Russia ap
peared headed for a diplomatic test
this week that may well determine
.relations of the two powers in
world affairs for some time to come.
Chief interest in Europe centers
on promises of General Mjarkos
Vafthiadis, Greek guerilla leader, to
set up a "free Greek government"—
a move aimed at a severe test of the
Truman Doctrine.
As for the Far East, officials cited
these troublesome issues:
Korea —Marshall on Wednesday
asked Soviet Foreign Minister V. M.
Molotov to agree to call upon the
Amtrican-Soviet commission meet
ing at Seoul to report by Thursday
on its '"progress" in uniting Korea.
If the Soviets reject the request, the
United States is expected to give up
and send the problem back ot the
foreign ministers of the U.S., Rus
sia, China, and Britain.
Japan—Marshall on Friday asked
Russia to abandon its demand for
Big Four consideration of the Jap
anese treaty and to agree, as nine
other nations have, to 11-nation ne
gotiations. Russia has rejected this
proposal once.
