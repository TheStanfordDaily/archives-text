### 
NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 17
(UP). — The newspaper National
Call said today that 100 armed
members of a Moslem boundary
force at Belin, which belongs to Pa
kistan, had invaded villages in the
Amritsar district, which belongs to
Hindu India.
National Call, a National Congress
(Hindu) party newspaper, said the
Moslems carried out their invasion
in three trucks, shooting many
Hindus and Sikhs and setting houses
on fire.
INDIAN FORCE ARRIVES
An Indian (Hindu) boundary
force finally arrived, it said, and
captured two trucks filled with men
after a flurry of shooting.
Amritsar. near which the inva
sion was imported to have occurred,
is the sacred city of the Sikhs in the
Punjab. This was the first reported
boundary violation since India was
divided into free Hindu and Mos
lem dominions at midnight last
Thursday.
MOB ATTACKS TRAIN
National Call printed "uncon
firmed reports" that a mob had at
tacked a train near Sialkote, killed
a "large number" of Hindus and
Sikhs and looted their belongings.
A similar incident, National Call
said, was reported to have occurred
at Wazirabad, 60 miles north of
Lahore. In this case, it was said,
bodies were lying along the railroad
right-of-way after the attack.
The Hindus were disappointed
because Lahore, their cultural and
educational center in the Punjab,
was given to Pakistan. The Sikhs
were disappointed because their
claims to the Canal Colonies, where
there are Sikh shrines, and their
demand for a boundary along the
Chenas River were not satisfied.
