# Holy Land Jews In Disagreement

### 
JERUSALEM, Palestine. Aug. 17
(UP). â€”One person was killed to
day in the Arab-Jewish feud, and
a dispute over the "reprisal" slay
ing of Arabs appeared to have
brought three Jewish organizations
to the brink of open warfare among
themselves.
The victim in today's fighting was
an Arab. A gang of Yemenite Jews
seized him while he was drinking
coffee in a Tel Aviv restaurant,
dragged him into an alley and stab
bed him to death.
The Jewish Irgun Zvai Leumi and
Stern Gang, outlawed' underground
organizations that have been killing,
bombing and kidnaping British sol
diers for more than a year, distrib
uted pamphlets denouncing as "trai
tor" any Jew who touched the hair
of an Arab's head.
Haganah today took the unprece
dented step of stationing scores of
guards around banks and other fi
nancial institutions to keep Irgun
ists and Sternists from robbing
them. Haganah had heard that the
Irgun and Stern Gang planned to
stop the Arab-Jewish fighting by
making a big attack against the
British, possibly against their banks.
