### 
PETROPOLIS, Brazil, Aug. 17 (UP). —Argentina will abandon it:
demand for veto power over collective action against aggressors and accer
the United States proposal that all American republics must act on the
basis of a two-thirds vote, well-informed diplomatic sources predictec
tonight.
It was forecast that Argentine Foreign Minister Juan, A. Bramugli;

would put up only formal
in favor of "unanimity"—the veto
power—and then toward the end of
the Inter-American Conference on i
Peace and Security would abandon
its position and go with the majority. |
NEUTRALITY PROPOSAL
Argentina's attitude is expected
to be determined by the overwhelm
ingly favorable response of other
American republics to the no-neu
trality proposal announced Friday,
the day the conference opened, by
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall.
Marshall asked that all signatories
to the proposed new inter-American
defense treaty be bound by a two
thirds vote on any kind of penalty—
diplomatic, economic or military—
except the actual provision of armed
forces which might be prescribed.
The Marshall proposal has set the
keynote for the entire conference.
OPINION AGAINST RUSSIA
It was understood that Marshall
expects the defense treaty to
strengthen his hand materially at
next month's United Nations assem
bly when he hopes to throw the
weight of world opinion against
Russia for its actions in eastern
Europe and its obstruction of peace
treaty making.
Marshall is said to feel that strong
regional agreements like the West
ern Hemishpere Defense Pact are the
answer to Russian obstructionism
within the UN.
