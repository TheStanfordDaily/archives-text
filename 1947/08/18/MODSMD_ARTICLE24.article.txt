# 15 Ministers Back in London

### 
LONDON, Aug. 17 (UP). —Fifteen
of the 20 members of the cabinet re
turned from vacations to London by
plane, train and automobile today
and held an urgent conference at
No. 10 Downing street.
It was reported in political quar
ters that the steady drain on the
government's dollar credits and the
conference about to start in Wash
ington on that problem was tin
chief topic.
But the circumstances of the
meeting and the extreme attempts
made to keep it secret led to belie;
that some new development ha;
arisen.
There was speculation that some
thing might have arisen to speed u}.
a long-predicted shake-up in th;
cabinet, but there was nothing t<
substantiate this suggestion.
It was one of the few cabinet
meetings—some said the only one
held on Sunday since the war ended
two years ago.
