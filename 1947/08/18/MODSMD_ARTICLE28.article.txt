## 'Basic University Policy' 
### 
Since, in our last editorial, we at least implied some criticism of the
present University Administration, we have felt compelled to go a little
further with our criticism, and, likewise, to offer what we hope are
constructive suggestions for meeting the problems.
The phrase "basic university policy" represents, to our minds, the
prime obstacle standing in the way of restored "mutual confidence be
tween administration, faculty, and students," of restoration of "the
pride and respect that Stanford students once felt for their University."
It is too pat an answer to too many questions; it replaces too easily
explanation and good reason. And so, students are often left with the
impression that the things concealed by "basic university policy" are
unreasonable and indefensible. How can mutual confidence or pride or
respect be built up on this unsteady foundation?
This is not to say that the students have any right to pry and peer
into all the workings of the University machine. The ways and means
need not be exposed to the public view, but what an improvement it
would be were we to know where Stanford was headed, what were its
aims and ends and goals!
So—what constructive suggestions can we make? I"n the first place,
we endorse the idea of the student-administration forum set up last
year. In the second place, we propose that students, the ASSU president
and vice-president, for instance, attend at least some of the meetings of
the Board of Trustees. Why not? What is there to hide? It is not, we
trust, as though the Trustees were planning the secret manufacture of
atom bombs or a filibuster against the Dominican Republic! Even if
students were to find out what was "basic university policy," the worst
that could result, we are sure, would be more understanding and in
creased cooperation all around.
