## Bull Session 
### 
No sir, not on? word, I won't take back a single thing I've said. Oh,
but people are so upset, I really didn't mean a lot of those things now,
did I? Surely my tongue wasn't sticking out all the time, it was in my
cheek, wasn't it? Just a great big old kidder when I really loved Stan-

lord and all the students and the poor veterans and
their wives and children —itsn't that it?
Nope, honest, I meant it all—dead serious, dead
pan. I wasn't just trying to be sensational now, was
1? Not on your life. I don't back down one line. You
had it coming a long time and you got it and I wasn't
kidding.
So you said this bird must be a Communist then.
One of you wrote in a poem of sorts and said of
course I was a Communist or else I couldn't be so
awful and ornery, and somebody else said I was like
Mencken and another thought it was Pegler at the
same time he described my attitude as Marxian, but

how could I be Communist and Pegler and Mencken too? Then one
poor devil who saw red hadn't even noticed when I cheered a Commu
nist licking in the AVC. After that the AVC got grim and righteous and
said I was downright unfair because I called them longwinded after
being at only one meeting, but I say one session was enough, and I'll
say now what I said before, that AVC is all right and I like it and
as a matter of fact I was one of its earliest members. What's more,
AVC people like Preston Burchard, Hal Baillin and Cecil Rospaw are
perfectly fine guys, but they bore me.
But I was too tough on the Stanford Players, wasn't I? Certainly
I should have shown more charity to an amateur group that was trying
so nobly. Didn't Walker Vaughan's letter touch me just a little? And
there was Robert Hagopian who wrote in a letter with two pals of his
and was offended by the column on the Stanford rough. But this Hago
pian is a Speech and Drama boy and who'd he think he was flimflam -
ming when he said he resented my remarks about the rough when all
the time he was burning about how the Stanford Players got handled?
Hey?
Then the tenants of Memorial Theater went and took it out on
Eleanor Lawrence, The Daily's drama critic, because for once she
couldn't face doing a wishy-washy, mishy-mashy, how-sweet-and-ear
nest-they-are-they're-just-like-professionals review and instead wrote
it as she saw it. What the Stanford Players want is namby-pamby twit
twit praise like the stuff their friend Frances Braggiotti, or however
you spell it, sends in perfumed envelopes to the Chronicle.
The Players can be good and they can be bad. They work hard and
you have to hand it to them they work so hard, but I've seen them very
bad often enough to let them know it and, holy cats, they ought to
know it.(And they could take a few lessons from their own stepchild,
the Studio Theater.)
As for the Stanford rough, well, he really got excittfd, but I'm satis
fied I proved the Stanford rough is a fool. He ought to grow up and
wise up and get over his self-styled and self-conscious fashions. What
I was saying to the rough was be yourself, you can't humbug me, and
I like to dress as crummily as the next slob.
So when I made a deal with The Daily to do the column for the
summer I said, okay, anything goes? And they said, why certainly,
anything you want. But I think they were a little disappointed because
I didn't run enough jokes or reports on who played with his erector set
last night at Dinah's. But I did it for the summer, sure enough, and
I wouldn't do it any more. You all wear a little thin after three months.
