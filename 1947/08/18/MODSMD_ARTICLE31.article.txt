The last time I wrote about
India was in April when things
weren't looking too good. Though
Prime Minister Attlee had de
clared that the British would leave
India on or before June 1, 1948,
political prophets in India and in
America were predicting a full
scale civil war. The question as
to what the nearly 300 princes
would do was another sore spot on
the future of that country. Con
trary to the prevailing pessimism,
I wrote at that time that things
weren't as bad as that. Let us see
now what happened between then
and now and what might happen
in the future.
After Lord Louis Mountbatten
went to India and along with the
Indian leaders made another effort
to reach an agreement, he was
able to reach a solution and the
British award, to which the Indian
leaders had agreed beforehand,
was announced on June 2. Accord
ing to this award India was di
vided into two new countries. The
larger of the two inherited the
previous government and will in
the future be known as India. It
consists of the Hindu - majority
provinces of the United Provinces,
Bihar, the Central Provinces, Or
rissa, Madras, Bombay, Assam,

and Western Bengal and Eastern
Punjab. The other country will
be known as Pakistan and will
consist of Eastern Bengal to the
east of India, and the Frontier
Province, Western Punjab, and
Sindh to the west. The division
took place purely on a religious
basis.
Both India and Pakistan will re
tain the status of dominions up to
June 1, 1948. Most probably both
of them will become completely
free republics after that. What
about the princes? Well, all of
them except Kashmir have already
announced that they will join one
or the other of the new nations. It
can be safely predicted that most
of them will be absorbed in the
larger countries before the end of
the century.
What sort of governments will
the two new countries have? Con
stitutional assemblies have already
been elected in both of them and
have started their work, and will
act as the governing bodies until
the new constitutions are put into
operation. The draft constitution
of India has been written and fol
lows the British pattern rather
than the American. It has adopted
the American federal state system,
but at the center they will have a
prime minister and parliamentary
responsibility of the executive. The
formal executive functions will be
performed by an elected president
who will be like a French presi
dent. The franchise will be grant

eel to all Indians above 21, irre
spective of their sex, race, reli
gion, or political views. Pakistan
has not announced any plans for
the future as yet.
Does freedom from Britain mean
everything will be smooth in fu
ture India? I am afraid not. The
remnants of the communal hatred
are still there. One of the biggest
dangers is that this hatred will be
vised in the future by the reaction
aries to further their own ends.
Already the big capitalists of India
have started a campaign of making
India a Hindu nation, with Hindu
culture, etc., in an effort to divert
the attention of the poor and hun
gry Indians from the social and
economic problems to the religious
ones. I am sure we will hear more
of these people and their efforts.
The younger India is moving to
the left while the older generation
is far more conservative. In my
opinion, one of the toughest bat
tles between the left and the right
will be waged in future India, and
very soon too.

been elected in both of them and
have started their work, and will
act as the governing bodies until
the new constitutions are put into
operation. The draft constitution
of India has been written and fol
lows the British pattern rather
than the American. It has adopted
the American federal state system,
but at the center they will have a
prime minister and parliamentary
responsibility of the executive. The
formal executive functions will be
performed by an elected president
who will be like a French presi

spective of their sex, race, reli
gion, or political views. Pakistan
has not announced any plans for
the future as yet.
Does freedom from Britain mean
everything will be smooth in fu

remnants of the communal hatred
are still there. One of the biggest
dangers is that this hatred will be
vised in the future by the reaction

Already the big capitalists of India
have started a campaign of making
India a Hindu nation, with Hindu
culture, etc., in an effort to divert
the attention of the poor and hun

economic problems to the religious
ones. I am sure we will hear more
of these people and their efforts.
The younger India is moving to
the left while the older generation
is far more conservative. In my
opinion, one of the toughest bat

will be waged in future India, and
very soon too.

The last time I wrote about
India was in April when things
weren't looking too good. Though
Prime Minister Attlee had de
clared that the British would leave
India on or before June 1, 1948,
political prophets in India and in
America were predicting a full
scale civil war. The question as
to what the nearly 300 princes
would do was another sore spot on
the future of that country. Con
trary to the prevailing pessimism,
I wrote at that time that things
weren't as bad as that. Let us see
now what happened between then
and now and what might happen
in the future.
After Lord Louis Mountbatten
went to India and along with the
Indian leaders made another effort
to reach an agreement, he was
able to reach a solution and the
British award, to which the Indian
leaders had agreed beforehand,
was announced on June 2. Accord
ing to this award India was di
vided into two new countries. The
larger of the two inherited the
previous government and will in
the future be known as India. It
consists of the Hindu - majority
provinces of the United Provinces,
Bihar, the Central Provinces, Or
rissa, Madras, Bombay, Assam,

and Western Bengal and Eastern
Punjab. The other country will
be known as Pakistan and will
consist of Eastern Bengal to the
east of India, and the Frontier
Province, Western Punjab, and
Sindh to the west. The division
took place purely on a religious
basis.
Both India and Pakistan will re
tain the status of dominions up to
June 1, 1948. Most probably both
of them will become completely
free republics after that. What
about the princes? Well, all of
them except Kashmir have already
announced that they will join one
or the other of the new nations. It
can be safely predicted that most
of them will be absorbed in the
larger countries before the end of
the century.
What sort of governments will
the two new countries have? Con
stitutional assemblies have already
been elected in both of them and
have started their work, and will
act as the governing bodies until
the new constitutions are put into
operation. The draft constitution
