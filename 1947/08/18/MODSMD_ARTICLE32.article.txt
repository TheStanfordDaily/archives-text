# Class Plate Space Gone In 8297 AD
## 
### 
How often have you wondered,
as you walked past those class
plates on the Inner Quad, just how
long it will take before all the
space is filled and they're back
around where they started?
Editor Pete Allen of the Alumni
Review got to thinking about that
not too long ago, and it bothered
him so much that finally he paced
the distance off. He found that in
the year 2517 it will be time to
start over again.
But it wasn't long until he found
that he'd been a few years late
with his idea—about 50, as a mat
ter of fact. He had occasion to
search through the files of the
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Daily) and found that Dr. Da
vid Starr Jordan (Stanford's first
president) had investigated ihe
matter even more thoroughly than
he.
Dr. Jordan's research showed
him that when the other four
series of red-brown squares are
filled in with class plates, it will
be the year 5097. Then, by switch
ing to a diffei'ent-colored metal for
the plates, the gray squares can be
filled in—and that will take until
8297 A.D.
No immediate shortage of space
for class plates is expected.—Steve
