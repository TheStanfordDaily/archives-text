Dear Marge:
The funniest things happen here
in Washington—you really should
have got a job here when I did.
Of course it's still pretty tough to
get a date because there are so

many more wo
men than men,
but there are
lots of oth v r
things to do.
Take hearings
of Congressional
committees, for
instance — just
yesterday I went
to a meeting
of Represcnta-

tive J. Parnell Tomcat's Un-Con
gressional Affairs Committee. Gee,
Marge, it sure was interesting to
watch democracy working.
Mr. Tomcat was investigating a
man who sent a poem through the*
mail to Senator Raft and Senator
Snicker of Ohoho. I'll write it
down for you:
Here's to you, oh Senator Raft—
And to your buddy, Senator
Snicker;

We know that you're against all
graft
And Snicker ne'er would stoop
to dicker.
No, Snicker wouldn't dicker nor
would he use hard likker,
And he'll bicker much quicker
than any city slicker—
But never would he dicker, no,
never would he dicker;
never, never, never would he
dicker.
I can't understand it very well,
Marge; can you?
Anyhow. Mr. Tomcat thought he
shouldn't have sent this poem
through the mails or even written
it at all. and he was pounding the
table and yelling at this poor man.
Once he asked him if he'd ever
paid any money to Elliott You
know-who. but the man said who
ever heard of a rank - and - file
Democrat who ever had any mon
ey even to pay the light bill?
But Mr. Thomas kept asking this
Mi*. Publius (1 think he must be
a Greek) why he sent the poem.
The man said he sent it because
he had admired Senator Raft and

Senator Snicker for a long time and
he wanted them to know just what
he thought of them.
"They are typical, red-blooded
Congressmen," Mr. Publius said.
"With their hands on the throttle
and their eye on the rail, they
guide the train of State—"
Mr. Tomcat stopped him before
he said any more. He congratu
lated Mr. Publius on being a fine
citizen and discussed the case.
Then he hurried away. Mr. Pub
lius just stood there with a funny
sort of smile on his face; I don't
think he was sincere, at all—and
that's no way to act toward our
Congressmen.
I asked the man sitting next to
me if Mr. Tomcat had gone out to
look for some more un-Congres
sional activities, and he said,
"Yeah, I guess old Baldy's out
tom-catting around again." That
wasn't respectable — but you see
how much is going on around here,
Marge. It's awfully interesting,
watching democracy function. You
should have got a government job
too.
Yours respectably.
Myrtle
