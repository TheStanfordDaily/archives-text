When classes begin next fall, the
: Stanford Flying Club will again be
holding open house for Farm flyers.
Last year Indian flyers loosed the
Axe on the California Flying Club
for a 73 to 45 air meet win. Several
times during spring quainter campus
flyers took to the air for beach par
ties at Capitola and Half Moon Bay.
During the last meeting of the
year, a Moffett Field naval officer
showed the club a movie on ground
controlled approach landings.
AIR MEET
Main activity for the coming
! school year will be the Pacific Coast
Air Meet with about a dozen West
ern colleges participating. A silver
cup for the inning school and indi
vidual cash awards for top pilots
will be the prizes.
During the rainier days this fall
and winter, the club will bring
speakers and movies to the meeting
room. On hook until the first bad
weather sets in is the Moffett Field
invitation to the club to - visit the
Field to see how the ground con
trolled approach system operates.
SECOND CLUB FORMED

! formation of the second campus
| flying club in which part owncr
j ships in a plane will be sold.
