# Admission, Grade Level Above Former Standard
## 
### DICK BIESER 
Competition is probably as great
on the Farm today as it ever has
been. Not only is admission more
difficult, but it is harder to stay in
school once you are admitted.
H. Donald Winbigler, registrar,
told The Daily that admission is
considerably more competitive now
than it was before the war.
COMPETITION GREAT
"The competition for admission
for the autumn quarter 1947 was so
great that the Admission Committee
had to turn away some students
whose credentials would have
placed them in the upper half of our
prewar student group," he said.
The greater selection has tended
to make class averages higher in
many courses, and grading stand

ards have evidently been raised ac
cordingly.
BRASS TACKS
''I believe that grading standards
have become more severe at Stan
ford not because professors inten
tionally raised their standards, but
because they naturally respond to
the capacities of their students and
set their standards accordingly," Dr.
Winbigler said.
Dr. Paul R. Farnsworth, profes
sor of psychology, said that return
ing veterans are much more anxious
to get down to brass tacks.
"That is true of both graduates
and undergraduates," he said.
SAME GENERAL ABILITY
Students in mathematics at the
present time appear to be about the
same in general ability as they were
before the war, according to Dr.
Harold M. Bacon, associate profes
sor of mathematics.
Dr. Virgil K. Whitaker. associate
professor of English, told The Daily
that students are more serious now
than before the war.
"They seem to be working harder,
and we are passing a considerably
higher proportion in the English A
examination than we did previous
ly," he said.
