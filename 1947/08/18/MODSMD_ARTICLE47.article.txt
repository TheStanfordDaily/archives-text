## CARD STUNTS 
### 
It won't be long till Indians and Bears
In Cow Palace gel in eaeli other's hairs!
San Francisco's $7,000,000 Cow Palace has been receiving quite a bit of
publicity lately—not in the livestock section but in the sports pages of the
city papers.
It seems that suggestions to use this tremendous structure as a basket
ball pavilion have met with general approval. In the very near future
there will probably be an announcement that several of the Bay Area's
college casaba teams will meet in the Cow Palace in regularly scheduled
tilts.
We feel that this imminent result has both good and bad points. But
regardless of that, the step is one that could hardly have been avoided,
unless better basketball facilities were available on college campuses—
particularly here on the Farm.
Last winter only a small fraction of the University's student body had
the opportunity to watch the Cards in action, while the public at large
had even less of a chance. Students had to wait in long lines to receive
their admission tickets, and the very great majority of outsiders never even
had a chance to stand in line.
Might be a long drive to see a game
So comes next winter and another hoop season, and Stanford and Cal
students will be driving to the City to watch their school teams clash.
They'll be traveling 30 miles or more, where a walk across campus used
to suffice.
Good points: More students will be able to watch their school team
in action; for the first time in ages the majority of the public will gain
admission to a college basketball clash; and maybe the schools' finances
will gain.
Bad points: Students will have to go through more inconvenience and
expenses to get to the hoop games; and the games will lose much of the
"campus atmosphere" that usually distinguishes college games from pro
fssional games.
We realize that this pending step will be an improvement and we there
fore favor it. But we wish to make it perfctly clar that this solution to
the problem is a secondary one, and should never tend to hide the only
solution the majority of students would prefer.
Only satisfactory solution —new pavilion
And that is that if and when finances are available, a new basketball
pavilion should be built right here oh our own campus—a pavilion big
enough to supply the demand, as docs our football stadium. We hope the
Cow Palace wlil be a short term proposition.

'The Daily's Stu Millar has been spending his summer vacation in and
around the city of New York, and not idle eithei-. Only the other day we
received the following dispatch from him, and we quote our "NY Daily
correspondent" in full:
(Special to The Stanford Daily)
"Sports notes from New York . . . Bobby Brown, former Stanford
shortstop flash, opened the season at third base for the New York Yankees
and was achieving praise from Manhattan sports writers. . . . Then the
Boy Wonder, as he is tabbed here, hurt his thumb and Billy Johnson took
over the hot corner for the Yanks. Result: Johnson promptly challenged
Joe DiMaggio for the league leadership in runs batted in. Brown's thumb
is healed now but he is still riding the bench. He is Bucky Harris' chicf
pinch hitter now. . . .
Jansen, Lolirke have made the grade
"Incidentally, the Giants are finally convinced that the Coast League can
produce some talent at that. Alter Ray Harrell and Bob Joyce, San Fran
hurlers, laid successive eggs with the Jints after big buildups, Larry Jansen
and Lucky' Lohrke have made the grade.
"Jansen, acknowledged the top rookie pitcher in the National League,
has won 12 and will probably hit 20 at the rate he is going . . . and this
after being set back in spring training by a line smash off Bob Feller's bat
that injured his eye.
"Lohrke, a promising young third baseman from San Diego, is a stand
out in the field, but a little weak at the plate. Mel Ott's tutoring should
help him in this department. He is regarded as a comer. And everybody
in the Giants' organization is waiting for this guy Chesnes.
"A guy Stanford ALMOST got. 18-year-old Sherwin Swartz, is now
pitching for the Detroit Tigers, and is expected to stay in the majors. The
Tigers swiped him right from the same high school that produced Mel
Patton and Craig Dixon, USC and UCLA track stars. Swartz' battery mate,
almost as promising anyway, will check into a nearby JC this fall in an
attempt to bolster his average to the Stanford level. And Harry Wolter
has been saying that all he needs is a catcher next year to pull down the
conference bunting. . . .
.Michigan football lea in will be longli
"Don't want to be negative about the whole thing, but Michigan is the
early favorite to top the nation's football list this fall. Marchie will rate
honors if he can stop the Mid-Western behemoths when the Injuns tackle
the Wolverines in their second game this fall. . . . He's got the backfield
that might turn the trick, what with George (Bear) Quisti Bobby Ander
son, Ains Bell, Buck Brownson, Mick Titus, Sabu Erickson to shuffle. But
where's the line, especially without Billy Hachten to glue it together?
"That likeable redhead had another year of eligibility left but the New
York (football) Fiants swiped him with a fat fee. ... A few weeks after
Bill signed his contract the National League changed its standing rule—
which stated that teams could sign anyone whose original college class
had graduated—to read that teams could not sign anyone with any college
eligibility left.
"If Bill had postponed his decision a few weeks more he would have
been saved for Stanford and All-Americanism. But it's a good deal for the
redhead and all his friends on the Farm are rooting for him. . . . Right
now, Bill is trying for a first string berth at the Giants' training camp at
Bear Mountain, New York."

In Cow Palace gel in eaeli other's hairs!
San Francisco's $7,000,000 Cow Palace has been receiving quite a bit of
publicity lately—not in the livestock section but in the sports pages of the
city papers.
It seems that suggestions to use this tremendous structure as a basket
ball pavilion have met with general approval. In the very near future
there will probably be an announcement that several of the Bay Area's
college casaba teams will meet in the Cow Palace in regularly scheduled
tilts.
We feel that this imminent result has both good and bad points. But
regardless of that, the step is one that could hardly have been avoided,
unless better basketball facilities were available on college campuses—
particularly here on the Farm.
Last winter only a small fraction of the University's student body had
the opportunity to watch the Cards in action, while the public at large
had even less of a chance. Students had to wait in long lines to receive
their admission tickets, and the very great majority of outsiders never even
had a chance to stand in line.
Might be a long drive to see a game
So comes next winter and another hoop season, and Stanford and Cal
students will be driving to the City to watch their school teams clash.
They'll be traveling 30 miles or more, where a walk across campus used
to suffice.
Good points: More students will be able to watch their school team
in action; for the first time in ages the majority of the public will gain
admission to a college basketball clash; and maybe the schools' finances
will gain.
Bad points: Students will have to go through more inconvenience and
expenses to get to the hoop games; and the games will lose much of the
"campus atmosphere" that usually distinguishes college games from pro
fssional games.
We realize that this pending step will be an improvement and we there
fore favor it. But we wish to make it perfctly clar that this solution to
the problem is a secondary one, and should never tend to hide the only
solution the majority of students would prefer.
Only satisfactory solution —new pavilion
And that is that if and when finances are available, a new basketball
pavilion should be built right here oh our own campus—a pavilion big
enough to supply the demand, as docs our football stadium. We hope the
Cow Palace wlil be a short term proposition.

fore favor it. But we wish to make it perfctly clar that this solution to
the problem is a secondary one, and should never tend to hide the only
solution the majority of students would prefer.
Only satisfactory solution —new pavilion
And that is that if and when finances are available, a new basketball
pavilion should be built right here oh our own campus—a pavilion big
enough to supply the demand, as docs our football stadium. We hope the
Cow Palace wlil be a short term proposition.

'The Daily's Stu Millar has been spending his summer vacation in and
around the city of New York, and not idle eithei-. Only the other day we
received the following dispatch from him, and we quote our "NY Daily
correspondent" in full:
(Special to The Stanford Daily)
"Sports notes from New York . . . Bobby Brown, former Stanford
shortstop flash, opened the season at third base for the New York Yankees
and was achieving praise from Manhattan sports writers. . . . Then the
Boy Wonder, as he is tabbed here, hurt his thumb and Billy Johnson took
over the hot corner for the Yanks. Result: Johnson promptly challenged
Joe DiMaggio for the league leadership in runs batted in. Brown's thumb
is healed now but he is still riding the bench. He is Bucky Harris' chicf
pinch hitter now. . . .
Jansen, Lolirke have made the grade
"Incidentally, the Giants are finally convinced that the Coast League can
produce some talent at that. Alter Ray Harrell and Bob Joyce, San Fran
hurlers, laid successive eggs with the Jints after big buildups, Larry Jansen
and Lucky' Lohrke have made the grade.
"Jansen, acknowledged the top rookie pitcher in the National League,
has won 12 and will probably hit 20 at the rate he is going . . . and this
after being set back in spring training by a line smash off Bob Feller's bat
that injured his eye.
"Lohrke, a promising young third baseman from San Diego, is a stand
out in the field, but a little weak at the plate. Mel Ott's tutoring should
help him in this department. He is regarded as a comer. And everybody
in the Giants' organization is waiting for this guy Chesnes.
"A guy Stanford ALMOST got. 18-year-old Sherwin Swartz, is now
pitching for the Detroit Tigers, and is expected to stay in the majors. The
Tigers swiped him right from the same high school that produced Mel
Patton and Craig Dixon, USC and UCLA track stars. Swartz' battery mate,
almost as promising anyway, will check into a nearby JC this fall in an
attempt to bolster his average to the Stanford level. And Harry Wolter
has been saying that all he needs is a catcher next year to pull down the
conference bunting. . . .
.Michigan football lea in will be longli
"Don't want to be negative about the whole thing, but Michigan is the
early favorite to top the nation's football list this fall. Marchie will rate
honors if he can stop the Mid-Western behemoths when the Injuns tackle
the Wolverines in their second game this fall. . . . He's got the backfield
that might turn the trick, what with George (Bear) Quisti Bobby Ander
son, Ains Bell, Buck Brownson, Mick Titus, Sabu Erickson to shuffle. But
where's the line, especially without Billy Hachten to glue it together?
"That likeable redhead had another year of eligibility left but the New
York (football) Fiants swiped him with a fat fee. ... A few weeks after
Bill signed his contract the National League changed its standing rule—
which stated that teams could sign anyone whose original college class
had graduated—to read that teams could not sign anyone with any college
eligibility left.
"If Bill had postponed his decision a few weeks more he would have
been saved for Stanford and All-Americanism. But it's a good deal for the
redhead and all his friends on the Farm are rooting for him. . . . Right
now, Bill is trying for a first string berth at the Giants' training camp at
Bear Mountain, New York."
It won't be long till Indians and Bears
In Cow Palace gel in eaeli other's hairs!
San Francisco's $7,000,000 Cow Palace has been receiving quite a bit of
publicity lately—not in the livestock section but in the sports pages of the
city papers.
It seems that suggestions to use this tremendous structure as a basket
ball pavilion have met with general approval. In the very near future
there will probably be an announcement that several of the Bay Area's
college casaba teams will meet in the Cow Palace in regularly scheduled
tilts.
We feel that this imminent result has both good and bad points. But
regardless of that, the step is one that could hardly have been avoided,
unless better basketball facilities were available on college campuses—
particularly here on the Farm.
Last winter only a small fraction of the University's student body had
the opportunity to watch the Cards in action, while the public at large
had even less of a chance. Students had to wait in long lines to receive
their admission tickets, and the very great majority of outsiders never even
had a chance to stand in line.
Might be a long drive to see a game
So comes next winter and another hoop season, and Stanford and Cal
students will be driving to the City to watch their school teams clash.
They'll be traveling 30 miles or more, where a walk across campus used
to suffice.
Good points: More students will be able to watch their school team
in action; for the first time in ages the majority of the public will gain
admission to a college basketball clash; and maybe the schools' finances
will gain.
Bad points: Students will have to go through more inconvenience and
expenses to get to the hoop games; and the games will lose much of the
"campus atmosphere" that usually distinguishes college games from pro
fssional games.
We realize that this pending step will be an improvement and we there
fore favor it. But we wish to make it perfctly clar that this solution to
the problem is a secondary one, and should never tend to hide the only
solution the majority of students would prefer.
