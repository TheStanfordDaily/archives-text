# Intramurals Title Game Today
## 
### 
The summer quarter's intra
mural Softball championship is
at stake this afternoon when Phi
Psi and Kappa Alpha clash on
the field across from the Sunken
Diamond at 4:15.
The Phi Psi's and Kappa Alpha
wound up in a dead heat for first
place last Thursday afternoon with
6-1 records when the previously

unbeaten Phi Psi club bowed before
an ATO attack, 7 to 1.
Today, the chips are down again,
and holding the favorite's spotlight
is the Phi Psi aggregation. They
handed Kappa Alpha its only defeat
of the season, 2 to 0, two weeks ago,
to open the schedule, and then went
on to rack up five more wins in a
row before being snowed under last
Thursday.
Kappa Alpha, after that initial de
feat, went on to chalk up six straight
victoriesâ€”but it still has that first

loss to Phi Psi to avenge in order to
win that title today.
Phi Psi features the pitching of
lanky "Steve" Stephenson, whereas
the Kappa Alpha hopes for winning
are pinned on its hitting attack which
j has blossomed since the beginning of
jthe season.
