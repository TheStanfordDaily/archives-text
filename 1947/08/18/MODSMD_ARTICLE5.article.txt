# Hughes Hays Sen. Brewster
## 
### 
Howard Ilughes claimed today that
efforts of Sen. Owen Brewster, R.,
Me., to hide a probe of Pan Ameri
can Airways' asserted deal with the
government for overseas airports
caused calling off of hearings *mto
Hughes' war contracts.
Hugh Felton, former chief counsel
for Brewster's Senate committee in
vestigating war expenditures, sought
to give testimony about a Pan-
American deal when the Washing
ton heatings concerning Hughes'
$40,000,000 war contracts for planes
were suddenly postponed until Nov.
17. Hughes charged in a statement.
Sen. Homer Ferguson, R.. Mich.,
had annpunced the delay in com
mittee hearings because of absence
of Hughes' publicist, Johnny Meyer.
