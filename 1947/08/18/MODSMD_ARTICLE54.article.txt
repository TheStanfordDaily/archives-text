# 49'ers Rookies Surprise; Los Angeles Battle Near
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
MENLO PARK, Aug. 17—All was quiet on the 49'ers front
today. Even Coach Buck Shaw was serene as all get-out a week
before the Sunday clash with the' Los Angeles Dons at San
! Francisco.
The San Francisco All America Conference entry demon-

strated a new found offensive game
Saturday night at San Jose, when
the Reds outscored the Whites, 33 to
28, as "the rookies outshone the
vets."
Reserve quarterbacks, Jesse Frei
tas and Bev Wallace, have proved
they can aid Frank Albert from now
until Doomsday. And Wallace,
former Compton jaysee boy, may
yet be the surprise of the loop.
SHIPKEY SCOUTS TEAM
Free lance scout, Harry Shipkey,
earning his java and rolls for the
LA Dons, was wont to remark:
"I can't keep up with 'em. Who's
that in there now?"
A recapitulation of the 49'er scor
ing would be anti-climatical. But
to mention a few:
1. Little Joe Vetrano's 28-yard
field goal in the first period.
2. A Wallace to Waily Yonamine
pass for 65 yards and a TD.

3. Dan Durdan's 69-yard payoff
run through a broken field.
4. And Wallace's 15-yard TD loft
to Ned Matthews. Wallace was trap
ped on the 17, but cooly drifted
back to the 28 from whence the pass
was thrown.
GRGICH HURT IN FRAY
Lone injury was sustained by
Visco Grgich, ex-Santa Clara tackle,
who was carried off the arena on a
litter. Grgich's hurt is not serious
and he is slated to see action against
the Dons Sunday.
The 49'ers travel to Santa Rosa for
another intra-squad joust on Wed
nesday night.
But until then, they'll go through
the motions tomorrow and Tuesday
in hopes of rechecking all the last
minute details so necessary to make
it four straight over the Angeienos.

to mention a few:
1. Little Joe Vetrano's 28-yard
field goal in the first period.
2. A Wallace to Waily Yonamine
pass for 65 yards and a TD.

3. Dan Durdan's 69-yard payoff
run through a broken field.
4. And Wallace's 15-yard TD loft
to Ned Matthews. Wallace was trap
ped on the 17, but cooly drifted
back to the 28 from whence the pass
was thrown.
GRGICH HURT IN FRAY
Lone injury was sustained by
Visco Grgich, ex-Santa Clara tackle,
who was carried off the arena on a
litter. Grgich's hurt is not serious
and he is slated to see action against
the Dons Sunday.
The 49'ers travel to Santa Rosa for
another intra-squad joust on Wed
nesday night.
But until then, they'll go through
the motions tomorrow and Tuesday
in hopes of rechecking all the last
minute details so necessary to make
it four straight over the Angeienos.

Football Conference are looking

fall.
MENLO PARK, Aug. 17—All was quiet on the 49'ers front
today. Even Coach Buck Shaw was serene as all get-out a week
before the Sunday clash with the' Los Angeles Dons at San
! Francisco.
The San Francisco All America Conference entry demon-

strated a new found offensive game
Saturday night at San Jose, when
the Reds outscored the Whites, 33 to
28, as "the rookies outshone the
vets."
Reserve quarterbacks, Jesse Frei
tas and Bev Wallace, have proved
they can aid Frank Albert from now
until Doomsday. And Wallace,
former Compton jaysee boy, may
yet be the surprise of the loop.
SHIPKEY SCOUTS TEAM
Free lance scout, Harry Shipkey,
earning his java and rolls for the
LA Dons, was wont to remark:
"I can't keep up with 'em. Who's
that in there now?"
A recapitulation of the 49'er scor
ing would be anti-climatical. But
to mention a few:
1. Little Joe Vetrano's 28-yard
field goal in the first period.
2. A Wallace to Waily Yonamine
pass for 65 yards and a TD.

3. Dan Durdan's 69-yard payoff
run through a broken field.

to Ned Matthews. Wallace was trap
