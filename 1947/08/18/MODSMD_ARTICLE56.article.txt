# Power-Laden Crislermen Cardinals' Oct. 4 Target
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
With the summer quarter nearing its end, bringing with it the
beginning of the Farm's fall football practice and then the season
itself, it's not too early to begin sizing up the Red Machine's
toughest foe of the season—the University of Michigan's Wolver
ines, who host the Indians at Ann i

Arbor on Saturday, Oct. 4.
With 29 returning lettermen, most
of whom have seen semi-regular
service at some time or another dur
ing the past three years, the Crisler
men are tabbed as the team to beat
lor the Big Ten title this fall.
Give the Wolverines a fullback
who can handle the delicate assign
ments of Crisler's spinner play and
its tricky variations and you give
them the key with which to unlock
their potent aerial and ground at
tack. They have just that man—
Jack Weisenburger, who boasts three
years of varsity experience and who
can pass and kick with the best.
As for halfbacks, Crisler has the
task of picking between Bob Chap
pius, Chalmers '"Bump" Elliott, Gene
Derricotte and Henry Fonde. Pete
Elliott and Howard Yerges are the
two men who expect to be handling
the quarterback spot. But, which
one will it be?
Michigan's whole situation might
be summed up by Wait Teninga's re
mark to Crisler which he made this
fall when the Michigan coach asked

the '45 regular halfback what posi
tion he was going to try out for:
"Well, with fellows like Chappius,
Derricotte and Elliott around, I'm
out for the team —any place that I'll
fit in."
