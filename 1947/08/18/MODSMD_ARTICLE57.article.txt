# Vienna Students' Attitude Poor; 'Canned Lectures' Criticized
## 
### BILL FARRER 
(Special to The Daily)
The University of Vienna, noted as a great Pan-Germanic school since
the 1870's, is a former Nazi hotbed. It has always been handicapped
through the tight control of the Ministry of Education which enforced upon
the school the doctrines of the party in power.

Present control lies in the hands
of the Austrian People's party —
which is closely allied with the
Catholic Church of Austria — and
the present administration has per
mitted many Nazis to remain in
their positions (the excuse being
the shortage of teachers). The token
number of 35 out of the faculty of
300 were dropped — and most of
these were retired on pensions!
Students are not required to at
tend classes and there is no proper
advisory system; thus students may
sign up for any course they desire
at any time. They are also given
an extra ration card for being in the
student category.
BATTLE OVER NOTES
The student organization (Frei
Osterreichische Studenten) is bat
tling with certain faculty members
over the issue of "canned" lecture
notes. Some of the professors dis
like the practice so much that they

indicate they'll leave their posts if
the practice is continued.
Although the Austrian denazi
fication law provided that no Nazi
party member could be a student |
until 1950, I had the feeling that
there still were Nazi supporters
among the 14,500 students enrolled.
On the whole, I thought the student
attitude poor; they seem to be much j
more discouraged and shattered j
than those I found in Germany.
HISTORY SUFFERERS
Perhaps they are still suffering !
from their history—from Franz Jo- j
sef's empire to a republic to an Aus
trian fascist state to a Nazi German
province to an occupied democracy.
In the background is the Roman
Catholic Church, whose Austrian
head, Cardinal Innitzer, welcomed
Hitler in 1938.
(Another Austrian problem is the I
conflict between the conservative
rural population and the Viennese —
each group blaming the other for
the nation's troubles.)
PROFESSORS' FAY IHT
The university library is intact—
even though 21 bombs hit the
school. However, many of the pro

fessors have not been paid for (wo
years and the Ministry budgets for
some of the departments are fan
tastic. For example, only 1.36 schil
lings were alloted to the Seminar
for English Philology in which 1,300
students were enrolled for the
month of July (10 schillings to the
dollar).
The three state universities
(Graz, Innsbruck, and Vienna) are
conducted on the old classical basis
and have four faculties —Philoso-
phy, Law, Divinity, and Medicine.
The latter was most noted at the
University of Vienna and, although
it has not returned to its pre-war
standards, it is improving.
All in all. I was a little discouraged
and a little at a loss for words after
my sojourn in Vienna.
