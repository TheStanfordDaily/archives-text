# Indonesians Turn Down U.S. Offer
## 
### 
BATAVIA, Java, Aug. 17 (UP).—
The Indonesian Republic today re
jected for the second time the Uni
ted States' offer to mediate in its
war with the Dutch.
It accepted the American offer of
"good offices" — which presumed a
renewal of peace negotiations with
the Dutch —but urged the U.S. to
use its influence to get the United
Nations Security Council to send an
international arbitration commission
to the East Indies.
ACTUAL REJECTION
Reliable informants said that as
far as the United States was con
cerned, this was a rejection. Actu
ally, the Indonesian attitude seemed
to be set forward more frankly by
three Indonesian leaders.
''As long as peace is not fully in
our hands, there will be no security,
no law, no order in Indonesia," Pres
ident Soekarno said.
Vice Premier A. K. Gant said the
dispute no longer was one that
could be settled between the Indo
nesians and the Dutch. He said it
was a world problem, because the
world looked upon the war in the
East Indies as a threat to peace in
general.
SAME ANSWER
The answer the United States re
ceived today from Jogjakarta, the
republican capital, was exactly what
the Indonesians said when the U.S.
fust oftered its good offices. The
State Department had taken this
first reply as a rejection ol its offer.
But it believed there was some
chance the Indonesian Republic had
misunderstood the offer and yester
day Walter A. Foote, U.S. Consul
General here, went to the Indone
sian vice premier for a flat "yes" or
"no" answer.
