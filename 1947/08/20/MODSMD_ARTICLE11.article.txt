# US-Argentinian Accord Hinted
## Marshall-Bramuglia Talks End Feud; Argentina Underscores Marshall Plan 
### 
PETROPOLIS, Brazil, Aug. 19 (UP). —The United States and
Argentina ended their long diplomatic feud today as the result of
a conference between Secretary of State George C. Marshall and
Argentine Foreign Minister Juan A. Bramuglia, authoritative
sources said tonight. Marshall and Bramuglia not only reached

♦■substantial agreement on major
points of the proposed inter-Ameri
can defense treaty but made a
sweeping review of United States-
Argentine relations and world po
litical problems.
Bramuglia was understood to have
abandoned his demand for a separ
ate inter-American economic con
ference—pointed toward a Marshall
recovery plan for the western hemi
sphere—and to have agreed that a
two-thirds vote should bind the
American republics to act in con
cert against any aggressor.
FIVE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED
Five subjects were discussed, ac
; cording to sources close to one of
the principals:
1) United States-Argentine rela
| tions.
2) The general work and object
t ives of the current inter-American
defense conference here.
3) General world political prob
i lems.
4) Argentina's proposal for a
j special economic conference.
5) Cuba's proposal for inclusion of
| economic aggression in the defense
treaty and Mexico's proposal that
the Bogota conference next January
consider inter-American economic
co-operation.
Diplomatic informants said that
Marshall and Bramuglia spent most
of their time in a frank, direct dis
cussion of United States-Argentina
relations.
j GOOD RELATIONS
They were said to have agreed
that their relations were now, after
years of divergence, on a good foot
ing and that there was no obstacle
to continued good relations. They
were understood to have agreed that
such relations were greatly desir
able to ensure inter-American unity
and that after this conference the
two countries would be able to act
together in world affairs.
Bramuglia was said to have
praised warmly the way Marshall
is carrying out his world policies.
Informants refused to say whether
Russia was discussed but it seemed
impossible that it was not.
