PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 19 (UP),
i Senator Wayne L. Morse promised
| Oregon Republicans tonight that he
would campaign with all his politi
i cal might for the party in 1948 but
; warned that the GOP was being
; tagged "the Anti-Labor Party."
Facing party workers for the first
time since his return from Washing
ton at the annual state Republican
picnic here, Morse predicted that
j the GOP would win in the next
presidential election in spite of "the
political blunders we have made one
| after the other in the last several
I months."
But victory at the next general
election will not be enough to save
either the party or the country un
less the Republican party steers a
sound course between leftism on the
one hand and becoming the "Tory"
government on the other, he said.
"Republican voters,"the former
University of Oregon law dean said,
"are becoming aware of the fact
I that if the Republican party ever
| permits itself to become a political
instrument of reactionary economic
| interests it will not enjoy support of
the majority of American voters
; long."
