# Congress, Labor Counsels Brawl in Labor Hearing
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 19 (UP).—lrving G. McCann, counsel for a con
gressional subcommittee, grabbed American Federation of Labor attorney
Joseph A. Padway, 56, by the neck today and socked him three times whei
Padway called committee methods "gestapo stuff" during a Hollywooc
labor investigation. The fist-swinging terminated a sharp verbal braw

between the two counsels over Mc-
Cann's questioning an AFL vice
president during a probe of the
movie industry's prolonged juris
dictional dispute.
McCann swung three times, muss
ing Padway's hair and breaking his
glasses as they scuffled across the
hearing room. Padway, lighter than
McCann and taken off balance, did
not swing a blow in return.
FIGHTERS SEPARATED
Spectators separated them before
serious damage was done.
The older McCann remained in
censed following the scuffle and
neither apologized. Padway angrily
invited McCann outside with the
j threat that his assailant would be
i "torn to pieces by the men I repre-
I sent."
McCann left the building at noon
| under police escort.
McCann was questioning AFL
! vice-president W. C. Doherty when
' Padway objected to a question as
! ambiguous. McCann leaped to his
feet.
"You can't interrupt me!" he said.
"You can't scare me," Padway
responded. ''Just act like a gentle
man."
NO COACHING
"You can't coach your witnesses,"
1 McCann shouted back.
"T'H follow your procedure," Pad
way shouted, "but I don't go for this
gestapo stuff."
"You can't use the word gestapo!"
McCann shouted. He grabbed Pad
way at the neck and struck him three
times. The two attorneys scuffled
across the room before they were
separated.
Physically, the opponents are of

about the same height, but McCann
despite his greater age, is huskir
and weighs 25 pounds more thai
Padway, weak from a recent iHnes 1
with which he was hospitalized.
REMOVAL DEMANDED
Padway's voice trembled witli
emotion as he demanded that Mc-
Cann be removed as committer
counsel.
"I say the AFL will ask removal
of McCann as general counsel foi
this committee," he said. "He ha:
conducted himself in a most inhu
man, brutal and cruel manner
This man should be removed for hi 1
dastardly, malicious, and bruta
attack.
TORN TO PIECES
"If he would step out into the
hall with me, he would be torn ti
pieces by the men I represent."
"Nothing would have happened
if Padway had obeyed the procedure
as requested by Kearns," McCann
said.

gestapo stuff."
"You can't use the word gestapo!"
McCann shouted. He grabbed Pad
way at the neck and struck him three
times. The two attorneys scuffled
across the room before they were
separated.

about the same height, but McCann
despite his greater age, is huskir
and weighs 25 pounds more thai
Padway, weak from a recent iHnes 1
with which he was hospitalized.
REMOVAL DEMANDED
Padway's voice trembled witli
emotion as he demanded that Mc-
Cann be removed as committer
counsel.
"I say the AFL will ask removal
of McCann as general counsel foi
this committee," he said. "He ha:
conducted himself in a most inhu
man, brutal and cruel manner
This man should be removed for hi 1
dastardly, malicious, and bruta
attack.
TORN TO PIECES
"If he would step out into the
hall with me, he would be torn ti
pieces by the men I represent."
"Nothing would have happened
if Padway had obeyed the procedure
as requested by Kearns," McCann
said.
HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 19 (UP).—lrving G. McCann, counsel for a con
gressional subcommittee, grabbed American Federation of Labor attorney
Joseph A. Padway, 56, by the neck today and socked him three times whei
Padway called committee methods "gestapo stuff" during a Hollywooc
labor investigation. The fist-swinging terminated a sharp verbal braw

between the two counsels over Mc-
Cann's questioning an AFL vice
president during a probe of the
movie industry's prolonged juris
dictional dispute.
McCann swung three times, muss
ing Padway's hair and breaking his
glasses as they scuffled across the
hearing room. Padway, lighter than
McCann and taken off balance, did
not swing a blow in return.
FIGHTERS SEPARATED
Spectators separated them before
serious damage was done.
The older McCann remained in
censed following the scuffle and
neither apologized. Padway angrily
invited McCann outside with the
j threat that his assailant would be
i "torn to pieces by the men I repre-
I sent."
McCann left the building at noon
| under police escort.
McCann was questioning AFL
! vice-president W. C. Doherty when
' Padway objected to a question as
! ambiguous. McCann leaped to his
feet.
"You can't interrupt me!" he said.
"You can't scare me," Padway
responded. ''Just act like a gentle
man."
NO COACHING
"You can't coach your witnesses,"
1 McCann shouted back.
"T'H follow your procedure," Pad
way shouted, "but I don't go for this
gestapo stuff."
