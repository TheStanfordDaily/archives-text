## No Bed of Roses 
### 
This is the last issue of the summer Daily. It seems most
college newspapermen can't bear to reach the end of the trail
without writing one last sentimental editorial—but we don't
believe in that sort of thing. However, if we did—
We would say that we hope you have liked our efforts this
summer; if you haven't—we're sorry. Contrary to what you
may think, it takes more than a little time to put out The Daily.
There are quite a few things occurring from time to time which
are at least distracting.
Take, for instance, the problem of pressure. There is con
tinual pressure on the part of different groups to print certain
stories in a prominent position—stories which don't deserve it.
We've always said no to these groups—and rightly so, we
think.
Then there's the other kind of pressure; demands for us not
to print certain stories. Fortunately this sort of thing only hap
pens a couple of times a quarter—and we meet that situation
with a resounding no, too.
So you see, putting out a college newspaper is no bed of
roses—but it's fun. We've enjoyed it—and we hope you
enjoyed our efforts.
