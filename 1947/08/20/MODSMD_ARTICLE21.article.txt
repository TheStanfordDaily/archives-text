## Bull Session 
### 
Just a few goodbyes and aniens before I hang up my summer spikes
and join brother among the has-beens in newspaper limbo.
Maybe Ive been rancorous sometimes, and picayune, too, but
actually the only people whose goats I tried to get were the creatures

who are always charging with their heads down.
I guess I've made it clear—l hope I have that I
don't like phonies and I don't like bigots; I don't
like stuffed shrits and pomposity; I don't like soft
soapers, loud mouths, or shots in the dark; I don't
like American advertising or American movies. All
this I hope I've made clear.
Just so you can have me, like Profrock, formu
lated and sprawling on a pin, I'll tell you some of
the things I've never had room for.
I like honesty, candor, sensitiveness, and spunk.
I like ridicule when it has a deserving target, be
cause I think ridicule is as good a way as any to

puncture balloons of hot air, balls of fire, and articles of hate. I like
people lor what they think and not for what they own. I like the person
whose sense of comedy is as acute as his sense of tragedy. He should
have both. I like people who are creative more than I like people who
care little for creativeness. Usually I like creations themselves more
than I like people who care a lot for creativeness. I think the nicest
things in the world are the arts, medicine and science, and baseball, in
that order, and I think the first two are the only worthwhile pursuits
of men. I like unconventionality when it is unaffected; I dislike con
ventionality when it is self-righteous.
I dislike communists almost as much as I dislike fascists, but I
consider American communists more pitiful because so many of them
think they re doing society good. We know better about the fascists.
I m a relativist in art and a New Dealer in politics. I'm skeptical
of panaceas but I deplore nihilism. I hate regimentation as much as I
hate laissez-faire, and I'm sure there must be an agreeable middle
ground.
I may toss the word "hate"' around pretty liberally, but really I
only hate the people who would stir hate for the defenseless and the in
nocent and the different.
I like America and only hate American men and American institu
tions that would make America something less free than what Madison
& Company had in mind when they drafted the constitution.
The Golden Rule is all right, because I'd like to see my neighbor
change and I am certainly no dogmatist myself. I can't, however, believe
in the Golden Mean, because there is no mean between honesty and dis
honesty.
I'm six-foot-three and weigh a bundled and seventy when my hair
is cut.
That's all.

I dislike communists almost as much as I dislike fascists, but I
consider American communists more pitiful because so many of them
think they re doing society good. We know better about the fascists.
I m a relativist in art and a New Dealer in politics. I'm skeptical
of panaceas but I deplore nihilism. I hate regimentation as much as I
hate laissez-faire, and I'm sure there must be an agreeable middle
ground.
I may toss the word "hate"' around pretty liberally, but really I
only hate the people who would stir hate for the defenseless and the in
nocent and the different.
I like America and only hate American men and American institu
tions that would make America something less free than what Madison
& Company had in mind when they drafted the constitution.
The Golden Rule is all right, because I'd like to see my neighbor
change and I am certainly no dogmatist myself. I can't, however, believe
in the Golden Mean, because there is no mean between honesty and dis
honesty.
I'm six-foot-three and weigh a bundled and seventy when my hair
is cut.
That's all.

Just a few goodbyes and aniens before I hang up my summer spikes
and join brother among the has-beens in newspaper limbo.
Maybe Ive been rancorous sometimes, and picayune, too, but
actually the only people whose goats I tried to get were the creatures

who are always charging with their heads down.
I guess I've made it clear—l hope I have that I
don't like phonies and I don't like bigots; I don't
like stuffed shrits and pomposity; I don't like soft
soapers, loud mouths, or shots in the dark; I don't
like American advertising or American movies. All
this I hope I've made clear.
Just so you can have me, like Profrock, formu
lated and sprawling on a pin, I'll tell you some of
the things I've never had room for.
I like honesty, candor, sensitiveness, and spunk.
I like ridicule when it has a deserving target, be
cause I think ridicule is as good a way as any to

puncture balloons of hot air, balls of fire, and articles of hate. I like
people lor what they think and not for what they own. I like the person
whose sense of comedy is as acute as his sense of tragedy. He should
have both. I like people who are creative more than I like people who
care little for creativeness. Usually I like creations themselves more
than I like people who care a lot for creativeness. I think the nicest
things in the world are the arts, medicine and science, and baseball, in
that order, and I think the first two are the only worthwhile pursuits
of men. I like unconventionality when it is unaffected; I dislike con
ventionality when it is self-righteous.
