# Farm Admits 'Promising' Student from South Korea
## 
### 
One Korean student—the first in
recent years—will be admitted to
Stanford this autumn as the result
of a conference agreement between
University officials and Dr. Chang
Wook Moon, director of the office
of foreign affairs for the South
Korea interim government.
This is the first step by the
Koreans to provide for Western
education for Korean students.
Registrar H. Donald Winbigler
said Chi Kyun Pak, first Korean
student for Stanford, "looks like a
very promising" student." Pak will
take up his major in the political
science department.
Dr. Moon arrived in the States
three weeks ago. He will obtain
help from American colleges and
philanthropic agencies in aiding
and sponsoring Korean students in
their education in this country.
A graduate of American colleges,
Dr. Moon is not new in the United
States. "His main problem will be
to secure financial aid from inter
ested parties in college areas play
ing host to Korean students.
Since no financial exchange rate
has been set up between the U.S.
and Korea, Dr. Moon's problem
becomes an even more complicated
one. Already 18 Korean students

have arrived in this country to
begin their studies in colleges and
universities scattered all over the
country.
Dr. Moon will meet 40 other stu
dents at San Francisco when they
arrive from Korea. After they ar
rive, Dr. Moon will start a tour
of U.S. schools in a campaign to
solicit more sponsors of Korean
students.
"Korea needs young leaders
badly," Dr. Moon stated, "and
they can gain that leadership
through the studying about the
principles of democracy which
they will take back to Korea."
With this background of demo
cratic principles, Dr. Moon said,
the students may operate their
new Korean government. The
students will specialize in educa
tion, public administration, for
eign service, agriculture, public
health, and other fields.
Besides conferring with Winbig
ler, Dr. Moon also saw Dr. Harold
Fisher, chairman of the Hoover
Library; Dr. Anthony Sokol, as
sistant director of Far Eastern
studies; Mrs. Arthur Wright, asso
ciate in research at the Hoover Li
brary; and Lt. Comdr. John L.
Taylor, associate professor of na
val administration. —Lokey
