## 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 19
(UP). —A firm of crop-dusting avi
ators said tonight it had perfected
a new "cloud treatment" technique
which—to date—has given it a 100
percent batting average in rain
making.
As a result, said H. A, (Buzz)
Hershfield, Jr., vice president of
Aerial Crop Service, Inc., the com
pany is ready to do business for
Cornbelt farmers who are gloom
ily watching their crops shrivel in
the baking sun.
Hershfield declined to go into the
details of the new technique he said
the firm had perfected. He claimed
it was an improvement in the dry
ice method.
"We've tried four times and have
been successful four times," he
said. "Now we're ready to make
rain for a price."
Just what the tab will be re
mains to be seen after the rain.
Hershfield explained "there will
be no guarantee on the amounts of
rain we bring and our prices will
vary accordingly."
"We can make it rain," he said,
"but the amount and the area hit
depends on a lot of uncontrollable
conditions and, as a result, our
price list is a little complicated."
Dust-settling showers, he said,
would cost $100. Soaking rains of
one-half to one inch are worth
$500 and run-off rains of an inch or
more hit the cash register to the
tune of $1,000.
