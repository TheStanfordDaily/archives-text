## History 1947 
### 
This is the story of Clarence,
who was the cause of a bitter bat
tle in a town I know about. Now
this Clarence wasn't much of a
man to fight over; in fact, he was
n't a man at all—he was a wood
chuck. However, fighting over a
woodchuck is obviously better

than not fight
ing over any
thing at all.
Clarence hap
pened to be the
pet of a young
Stanford ma n
who went to
visit his girl
friend during
the summer va
cation. He was

rather an odd woodchuck because
he liked ice cream cones — and
that's bad. Whoever heard of a
woodchuck eating ice cream? If
you let them get away with that
they'll keep demanding more and
more privileges, and maybe they'll
even want the vote before they're
through—or no said one group in
this struggle I'm telling you about.
It's only fair to report that this
group had what it considered good
reason for not liking woodchucks.
These people all lived in the Third
Ward of the city, and many dec
ades previously they had kept the
little buck-toothed animals in ser
vitude. They made them weed the
gardens with their teeth, and some

of the larger ones even had to cut
down trees—like beavers.
Finally the SPCA in the rest of
the city got fed up and emancipat
ed the woodcliucks. There was an
awful battle with guns and every
thing, and the Third Ward finally
had to give in—but the good citi
zens never liked the little beasts
after that.
This Stanford man didn't know
about this when he took his pet
along on the trip; even after mat
ters were explained to him, he
couldn't understand.
First off, he took Clarence into
an ice cream emporium, but the
bartender refused to serve him.
"Only humans can get served
here," the man said. Our Stanford
man was surprised, but didn't
think too much of it.
Next, he tried to get a hotel
room—but none of the room clerks
would take him in as long as he
had Clarence. "Why, he would
have to stay in the kennels with
the dogs—and we couldn't allow
anything like that," the last room
clerk said. "People would call me
a dirty woodchuck lover! I'd lose
business!"
Our friend was pretty discour
aged by now. but finally a kindly
old man took him in—and Clar
ence too. This was in the Third
Ward, and the neighbors didn't
Ward, and the neighbors didn't
like it. They all got up a petition

lo have Clarence evicted, because
they claimed his presence in the
district was hurting property val
ues.
Quite an issue was raised, and
one of the Aldermen introduced
an ordinance setting up a Fair
Animal Practices Commission —
but the FAPC was filibustered
down by Alderman J. Mushmouth
Beauregard of the Third Ward.
"The woodchuck must be made to
keep his place!" he cried. "Would
you want your dog to have a lit
ter of puppies that were half dog
and half woodchuck? We must
maintain canine supremacy!"
The Stanford lad still figured he
had a right to keep a woodchuck
if he wanted to (it's a free country,
isn't it?), even after he got a let
ter from the Knights of the Black
Hood warning him to get out of
town. He stayed right where he
was.
The upshot of it was that the
Knights of the Black Hood
knocked down the door of the
house one night. They put the
slug on the Stanford fellow and
the old man who had taken him
in, and then they took Clarence
outside and hanged him with a
piece of clothesline.
"That'll teach those dirty wood
chucks to keep their place," they
said, as they hurried home to their
happy firesides.
