# Rough Reports on AVC Meet
## 
### 
Cecil Rospaw, member-at-large, was in attendance at the regular meeting of the AVC State Executive
Committee which met at the Clift Hotel this last weekend, Bob lioyt, local AVC chairman, announced yesterday.
Major decision made by this governing body was a resolution asking the national organization to exclude
merchant marine seamen from membership on or before July 1, 1948, Rospaw said.
This action was taken after long debate and a consideration of the problem which the California Council

faces because of the action taken by
the last California Legislature limit
ing a veteran's organization within
the state to a group composed of sol
diers, sailors, or marines after 1948.
The housing situation was ap
praised and denounced as the worst
in the history of the state by the
housing chairman. Deploring the
lack of action by the just-concluded
legislature, announcement was made
of a proposed initiative measure
which will ask for a special election
next winter to set up a State Hous
ing Authority to construct low and
medium housing.
Rospaw, college chapter, chairman
for the state, in conjunction with
Peter Kortner of UCLA, announced
plans for regional conferences of
college delegates next fall, to be fol
lowed by a state-wide conference in
the winter. He said that the purpose
of the meetings would be to ex
change opinions and to lay the
ground work for training leadership
in AVC.
Following a report on the increase
of racial tension in the state it was
decided to hold an anti-discrimina
tion week in November to combat in
tolerance.
