# Student Dies After 20-Foot Fall Down Cliff
## 
### 
Stanford student John A. Hood,
injured Sunday in a fall from a rock
slope in the Devil's Slide area on
the San Mateo County coast, died
Monday morning in Stanford-Lane
Hospital. Private service will be
held in Los Angeles.
Hood slipped and fell 20 feet,
striking his head on a ledge and
fracturing his skull. He was par
ticipating in a Sierra Club practice
climb. Ernest Irvine, also a Stan
ford student, and Harold Gray,
Berkeley, climbing with Hood, were
uninjured.
The rescue took over three hours
and was watched by a crowd of
over a thousand. Irvine was able to
climb down to the ledge where the
unconscious Hood lay and tie him
to a stretcher lowered by Coast
Guardsmen.
Hood was taken in critical condi
tion to a hospital in Colma, and la
ter, with the co-operation of the
University, to Stanford-Lane Hos
pital in San Francisco. Dr. Freder
ick L. Reichert and Dr. Victor Rich
ards, both of the medical faculty,
were in attendance.
Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Hood of Los
Angeles, his parents, who had been
vacationing at Tuolumne Meadows,
arrived yesterday.
A veteran of three years' army
service, Hood was majoring in
mathematics. He was a member of
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity and of
the Alpine Club.
