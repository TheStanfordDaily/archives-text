Massa: "You gotta write a col
umn today. Make it interesting."
Chief: "On what?"
Massa: "Rehash of summer
sports . . . anything!"
Act I, "Hash You Like It"
# * *
Number one hash item of the
current splash of summer convivial
ity is about an entre named Lloyd
Merriman — "Lopin' Lloyd," we
would have called him—of Clovis.
Merriman, hero of a piece called
"Stanford Football Prospectus for
1947," authored by one D. E. Lie
bendorfer, is now a member of the
Cincy Reds baseball chain whose
top link is Warren Giles.
And to think we were all set to
scribble a yarn of copy shouting:
"Merriman's back and Marchie's got
him . . ."
* * *
We remember a day in June at
Berkeley when a mustachioed flyer
named Herb McKenley flew to a
:46.3 quarter-mile win over the best
in the PCC-Big Nine Conferences.
And somewhere in the green
knolls of Ann Arbor, the Farm links
entourage lost its 1946 NCAA golf
ing title to host team Michigan. Bob
Rosburg, Tom Lambie, Bob Cardi
nal, Jack Shuler, Rosy Rosecrance,
and Ernie Keliberg made the trip
East.
And we mustn't forget Brenda
Helser!
She but pulled the upset of the
summer by nearly upsetting Crys
tal Plunge's Ann Curtis in the AAU
Far Western women's 100 - meter
free-style event. (Bob Anderson
won the men's century free-style.)
"Everyone's been setting records
but me," Brenda said.

Of course, we'll toss a few slugs
on the coals embossed with the
names of Arnold Beisser, Inland
Empire net king; Tal Smith, winner
of the 12th annual Stanford invi
tational golf tourney; and Ted
Schroeder, Newport Casino tennis
chief.
The voice of Adm. Jonas Ingram,
All - America grid commissioner,
drifts back: "Visited Pop Warner,
my old friend, today. I guess he
remembers the old days, all right."
We'll be a target of criticism if
we don't mention Cornelius "Dutch"
Warmerdam, the world's greatest
pole vaulter. Dutch is committed to
a coaching job at Fresno State—a
swell break for a swelL guy. He'll
leave the Farm the end of this quar
ter.
Dutch opines: "Hate to leave
Stanford. It's tops!"

Insiders are whispering Bill Ste
phenson's name as the most valu
able player in the just-finished in
tramural softball tourney. Stephen
son, a pitcher by trade, is a Phi Psi
er.
Phi Psi, whose members presum
ably use the right fork at the right
time, won the tourney by squelch
ing Kappa Alpha, 5 to 1.
* * *
Then again, we recall our inter
view with the Lunn* 3—Ray and the
two Carneys. Ray j the Farm's
new ring coach.
"It's the break of my career," Ray
has often remarked.
And omnipresent as dusk is our
recall of a talk with Marilyn "Sug
ar Sahner, Crystal Plunge swim
star who is now in Chicago for the
AAU women's outdoor swimming
meet.
* * #
We remember the summer well
and even The Chief, sporting a nifty
$25 tweed suit, has had his moments
of recall.
"Whaddya doing?" he asked us.
"Cooking some left-overs from
last week,' we replied, hoping the
subtle retort would silence him to
scanning the comics.
He wryly shook his head: "Babe
Ruth's comin' to town on Sunday. j
Why'n'cha go up and see him?"
We said we would and then asked I
the tweedy character if he'd let us
alone for a minute or two —just
until we finish the column.
He said he would.

Next week: Susan and God.
