# Cage Stars' Pitching and Batting Give Phi Psi Squad Intramural Softball Championship Over Kappa Alpha
## Stephenson, Dallmar Star in 5-1 Victory 
### BILL WARDEN 
The summer quarter intra
mural softball league officially
ended Monday afternoon when
Phi Psi smashed out a 5 to 1
verdict over the Kappa Alpha
club in a post season encounter
that was played to determine the
top team of the league. The two
clubs ended the regular season with
identical records of six victories and
one defeat.
Phi Psi put the game on ice in the
first inning after two men had been
put down. Pitcher "Steve" Ste
phenson started the fireworks with
a single. Howie Dallmar, Phi Psi
catcher, strode to the plate and con
tributed a high pop fly which John
Mills, Kappa Alpha second sacker,
let hit the turf for an error. Ste
phenson, going with the pitch, scored
all the way from first.
TONY ORTEGA CONNECTS
With one run already across and
still two out, Kappa Alpha hurler
Bud Showier next faced Tony Or
tega. Mr. Ortega promptly laid the
hardwood to one of Showler's Sun
day pitches, and the result was a
terrific drive that finally ended up
deep in the left field pastures for a
home run. Dallmar dented the dish
ahead of Ortega to run the score to
3 to 0.
Kappa Alpha broke into the run
column for the first and last time
in their half of the second inning.
Rod Morse walked and then stole
second and third by evading the
watchful eye of catcher Howie Dall
mar.
KAPPA ALPHA SCORES
Kaye Crowell, the next Kappa
Alpha batter, hit a slow dribbler to
the hot corner and was thrown out
at first while Rod Morse crossed the
plate to tally for Kappa Alpha.
The Kappa Alphas averted the
possibility of having more runs
scored on them in the third inning
when they pulled the flashiest play
of the game. With a Phi Psi on first
and one out, a hard smash was hit
to third base. Clyde Burch made a
good stop, but his throw to second
was low. However, second baseman
John Mills scooped the ball out of the
dirt and made the relay to Earl Gus
tafson at first to complete the twin
killing.

HOWIE DALLMAR TRIPLES -
The final two tallies of the con
test came about in the fifth inning.
With two Phi Psi's on base, Howie
Dallmar, who could do nothing all
day but pop up, came to bat. His
contribution was a fly to left field
that the Kappa Alpha man lost in
the sun for a triple. Dallmar sub
sequently died on third base when
no one could punch him in.
The scoring ended with Dallmar's
blow and the contest ended two
innings later with the score still
5 to 1, and Phi Psi the champs of
the league.
THANKS A LOT, GENE
The credit for the success of the
intramural softball program goes
entirely to Gene Coldiron. It was
his hard work in getting the teams
together, securing the umpires, mak
ing up the schedule, and seeing that
the games were played on time that
insured the teams involved of a suc
cessful summer softball league.
