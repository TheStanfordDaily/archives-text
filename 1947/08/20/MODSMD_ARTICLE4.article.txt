Johnny Meyer, Howard Hughes'
free-spending press agent, today ac
cepted service of a subpoena to ap
pear in Washington, D.C., when a
Senatorial committee resumes its
investigation of his boss's airplane
contracts in November.
He appeared at the U.S. marshal's
office to accept the paper, which
orders him to be at the hearing at
10 a.m. Nov. 17.
Meyer had been telephoning the
marshal's office since last week ask
ing if a subpoena had been received
for him. When it arrived today, he
asked that two marshals remain in
the office until he could come in
to get the paper.
