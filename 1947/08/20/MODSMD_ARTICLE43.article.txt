# Idaho Grid Chances Hit By 'Scarcity of Material'
## Experts Foresee Cellar Lodging for Vandals 
### BCB CATUDIO 
Dixie Howell, of the Alabama
Howelis, suh, has cast a wordy
monogrammed crying towel on
to the football periphery.
"We may not win a single
game," the Dixie man says, "but
any team we play will certainly
know it has been in a battle."
Howell and his University of Idaho
Vandals troop into town Saturday,
Sept. 27, for the season's first PCC
joust with Stanford's Indians.

cohorts have been tight-lipped and
none too eager to verbally exploit
the talents of the Vandals.
