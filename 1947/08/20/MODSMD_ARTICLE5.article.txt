CHICAGO, Aug. 19 (UP).â€”James
C. Petrillo, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Musicians, re
fused today to permit AM and FM
radio stations to broadcast the same
union - produced music simultane
ously.
Petrillo sent telegrams to heads
of the radio networks to announce
the'union's policy. He said the pol
icy would mean that affiliated AM
and FM stations each must hire
their own musicians.
Petrillo also announced at a news
conference that the union had de
cided to "set aside for the time be
ing at least" its plans to manufac
ture its own musical recordings. He
said union lawyers had looked into
the proposal and that "it looks like
we would be brought into court on
charge of violating the anti-trust
act if we made records."
"We don't want to fool around
with the laws of the coutnry," he
said.
The networks, at a conference
with Petrillo here July 31, had
asked that FM stations with AM af
filiations be allowed to broadcast si
multaneously the musical programs
of the AM stations.
"The federation holds that FM
broadcasting is separate and dis

tinct from AM broadcasting." Pe
trillo said. "The Federal Commu
nications Commission licenses each
FM station separately, assigns indi
vidual call letters and channels, and
the station is required to comply
with al! FCC regulations."


JAMES C. PETRILLO told ra
dio networks that AM and FM
radio stations cotdd not broad
cast the same union - produced
music simultaneously.
