### DICK BIESER 
There will be about 7,500 students on campus autumn quarter, accord
ing to estimates by Registrar H. Donald Winbigler. Approximately 5,500

the GI Bill as previously, but there may be slightly fewer. Dr. Winbigler

said.
Registration procedure is being |
changed for autumn quarter. The;
first day, Sept. 29, has been alio- i
cated for new students and any re- j
turning students who were not here
spring or summer quarters. The
second day, Sept. 30, will be for the
registration of those students who

were here spring or summer quar
ters.
On the morning of the second day,
Sept. 30, books will be issued in al
phabetical groups with A to D be
ing given out from 8 to 9 a.m., E
