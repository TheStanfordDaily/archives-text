LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 19
(UP). â€” Two more Soviet vetoes
killed all chance tonight of United
Nations Security Council action in
the Balkans crisis.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
cast the 15th and 16th Soviet vetoes
to crush last - ditch proposals by
Australia and the United States to
install a long - range UN border
watch in the Balkans and brand the
trouble there as an outright threat
to world peace.
The crucial East - West deadlock
now will be thrown before the 55
United Nations General Assembly
by the United States in a final effort
to promote peace in Southeastern
Europe through machinery of the
UN. The General Assembly is
scheduled to meet Sept. IG.
