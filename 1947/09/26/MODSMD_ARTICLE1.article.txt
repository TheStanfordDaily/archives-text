# Indians Favored Over Idaho in Tomorrow's Opener; Crack Backfield Places Indians Among Bowl Hopefuls

### JOHN HUBBARD 
Bay Area football patrons will probably give Si=mford's open
er with Idaho a wide berth tomorrow, preferring to be on hand at
Berkeley for Cal-Navy or at Kezar for Santa Clara-SMU, and the
vast reaches of Stanford Stadium may well echo with comparative
emptiness. But for the some 15,000 faithful, who are expected to

be present for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff.
Indian coach Marchie Schwartz will
unveil his 1947 entry in the Pacific

There is a wealth of talented back
field material on the Farm, not
withstanding the loss of Lloyd Mer

But the situation in the line is
very much in doubt. Dick Flatland,
at center, will be the only return

forward wall.
The Indians have a total of 1(3 let
termen from H(4fj on their roster —
less than any other team in the con
ference.
Even Idaho, with 1!) lettermen
back from last year, can top Stan
ford in that, department.
If the Indian backs can come
through as anticipated, and if the
line rounds into a unit of compar

season for Stanford fans.
If not — well, at least the
