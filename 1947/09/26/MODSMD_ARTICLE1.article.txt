# Indians Favored Over Idaho in Tomorrow's Opener; Crack Backfield Places Indians Among Bowl Hopefuls
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Bay Area football patrons will probably give Si=mford's open
er with Idaho a wide berth tomorrow, preferring to be on hand at
Berkeley for Cal-Navy or at Kezar for Santa Clara-SMU, and the
vast reaches of Stanford Stadium may well echo with comparative
emptiness. But for the some 15,000 faithful, who are expected to

be present for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff.
Indian coach Marchie Schwartz will
unveil his 1947 entry in the Pacific
Coast Conference racc.
And, despite the anticipated slim
gathering, football experts the
country over will be appraising,
with calculating eye, Stanford's
performance in this first outing of
the season.
NOT TARRED FOR TITLE
The Indians are not generally
conceded much of a chance to snare
the PCC crown this year, but the
experts know that any Schwartz
coached Stanford squad cannot
lightly be counted out of the run
ning. Schwartz is a man who knows
how to get the most from the re
sources at his disposal, and his
teams have a disconcerting way of
upsetting the dope-sheets.
Stanford this year is a big ques
tion mark in the PCC picture.
There is a wealth of talented back
field material on the Farm, not
withstanding the loss of Lloyd Mer
riman.
LINK DOUBTFUL
But the situation in the line is
very much in doubt. Dick Flatland,
at center, will be the only return
ing regular in tomorrow's starling
forward wall.
The Indians have a total of 1(3 let
termen from H(4fj on their roster —
less than any other team in the con
ference.
Even Idaho, with 1!) lettermen
back from last year, can top Stan
ford in that, department.
If the Indian backs can come
through as anticipated, and if the
line rounds into a unit of compar
able quality, 1!>47 may be a happy
season for Stanford fans.
If not — well, at least the

Schwartzmen will be one of the
must colorful and interesting teams
on the Coast. Perhaps they might
never get into contention for the
championship, but they will be a
constant threat to the bin boys.
Tomorrow's game could easily be
the test that would determine which
way the "ifs" are going to fall.
Idaho, judging from its 27-7 win
over Puget Sound last week and
Irom Assistant Coach Ray Ham
mett's scouting report of that game,
will be no set-up. (See Hammett's
analysis on page seven.)
The Vandals, under their new
coach, Millard "Dixie" Howell, are
probably not entertaining any fool
ish hopes of scoring a Conference
victory over the Indians. But they
are serious about improving over
the 45-0 rout Ibe.v suffered last year
at Stanford's hands.
VANDALS HAVE GOO!) RACKS
They have little Billy Williams at
left halfback, a good passer, a tricky
runner, and an excellent kicker.
They have Willard Beit/., a promis
ing fullback, and Jim Hammond,
another capable halfback.
Howell has installed a Notre
Dame box as Idaho's offensive for
mation. His team lines up in a T.
and then shifts into the box. Against
Puget Sound, the Vandals used this
shift on practically all their plays,
but against Stanford tomorrow they
can be expected to work directly
from the T at least part of the time.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
exclusively a T - formation outfit.
Versatile Ainslie Bell, at his quar
terback posl under the center, starts
all the plays. Bell is a top-notch
passer, and he has a whole bevy of
bard-running backs to handle the
attack on the ground.
ANDERSON HIGHLY RATED
Halfbacks Bob Anderson, touted
as a likely candidate for All-Con
ference honors this year, speedy
Wayne Erickson, powerful Mickey
Titus, can all get up and go—along
with George Quist, who may not see
action tomorrow due to a bad ankle.
The Indians are also "loaded" j
with good fullbacks. They have two
relatively light, fast men in Martin
Anderson and Don Zappettini, and
they have two of the "rock-em,
sock-em" type in Chuck Coker and
Jim Nafziger.
In the starting line, along with
Dick Flatland at center, will be |
Gene Martin, a converted back, and j
big Ted Burke at ends. The tackle
assignments will go to 220-lb., 18- j
year-old Whit Budge and rough, I
aggressive "Pinky" Phleger. Marty j
Feldman, reliable 230-pounder, and
John Clark, handicapped by inju- i
ries last year, will man the guard |
posts.

shift on practically all their plays,
but against Stanford tomorrow they
can be expected to work directly
from the T at least part of the time.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
exclusively a T - formation outfit.
Versatile Ainslie Bell, at his quar
terback posl under the center, starts
all the plays. Bell is a top-notch
passer, and he has a whole bevy of
bard-running backs to handle the
attack on the ground.
ANDERSON HIGHLY RATED
Halfbacks Bob Anderson, touted
as a likely candidate for All-Con
ference honors this year, speedy
Wayne Erickson, powerful Mickey
Titus, can all get up and go—along
with George Quist, who may not see
action tomorrow due to a bad ankle.
The Indians are also "loaded" j
with good fullbacks. They have two
relatively light, fast men in Martin
Anderson and Don Zappettini, and
they have two of the "rock-em,
sock-em" type in Chuck Coker and
Jim Nafziger.
In the starting line, along with
Dick Flatland at center, will be |
Gene Martin, a converted back, and j
big Ted Burke at ends. The tackle
assignments will go to 220-lb., 18- j
year-old Whit Budge and rough, I
aggressive "Pinky" Phleger. Marty j
Feldman, reliable 230-pounder, and
John Clark, handicapped by inju- i
ries last year, will man the guard |
posts.
Bay Area football patrons will probably give Si=mford's open
er with Idaho a wide berth tomorrow, preferring to be on hand at
Berkeley for Cal-Navy or at Kezar for Santa Clara-SMU, and the
vast reaches of Stanford Stadium may well echo with comparative
emptiness. But for the some 15,000 faithful, who are expected to

be present for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff.
Indian coach Marchie Schwartz will
unveil his 1947 entry in the Pacific
Coast Conference racc.
And, despite the anticipated slim
gathering, football experts the
country over will be appraising,
with calculating eye, Stanford's
performance in this first outing of
the season.
NOT TARRED FOR TITLE
The Indians are not generally
conceded much of a chance to snare
the PCC crown this year, but the
experts know that any Schwartz
coached Stanford squad cannot
lightly be counted out of the run
ning. Schwartz is a man who knows
how to get the most from the re
sources at his disposal, and his
teams have a disconcerting way of
upsetting the dope-sheets.
Stanford this year is a big ques
tion mark in the PCC picture.
There is a wealth of talented back
field material on the Farm, not
withstanding the loss of Lloyd Mer
riman.
LINK DOUBTFUL
But the situation in the line is
very much in doubt. Dick Flatland,
at center, will be the only return
ing regular in tomorrow's starling
forward wall.
The Indians have a total of 1(3 let
termen from H(4fj on their roster —
less than any other team in the con
ference.
Even Idaho, with 1!) lettermen
back from last year, can top Stan
ford in that, department.
If the Indian backs can come
through as anticipated, and if the
line rounds into a unit of compar
able quality, 1!>47 may be a happy
season for Stanford fans.
If not — well, at least the

Schwartzmen will be one of the
must colorful and interesting teams
on the Coast. Perhaps they might
never get into contention for the
championship, but they will be a
constant threat to the bin boys.
Tomorrow's game could easily be
the test that would determine which
way the "ifs" are going to fall.
Idaho, judging from its 27-7 win
over Puget Sound last week and
Irom Assistant Coach Ray Ham
mett's scouting report of that game,
will be no set-up. (See Hammett's
analysis on page seven.)
The Vandals, under their new
coach, Millard "Dixie" Howell, are
probably not entertaining any fool
ish hopes of scoring a Conference
victory over the Indians. But they
are serious about improving over
the 45-0 rout Ibe.v suffered last year
at Stanford's hands.
VANDALS HAVE GOO!) RACKS
They have little Billy Williams at
left halfback, a good passer, a tricky
runner, and an excellent kicker.
They have Willard Beit/., a promis
ing fullback, and Jim Hammond,
another capable halfback.
Howell has installed a Notre
Dame box as Idaho's offensive for
mation. His team lines up in a T.

Feldman, reliable 230-pounder, and
John Clark, handicapped by inju- i
ries last year, will man the guard |
posts.
Schwartzmen will be one of the
must colorful and interesting teams
on the Coast. Perhaps they might
never get into contention for the
championship, but they will be a
constant threat to the bin boys.
Tomorrow's game could easily be
the test that would determine which
way the "ifs" are going to fall.
Idaho, judging from its 27-7 win
over Puget Sound last week and
Irom Assistant Coach Ray Ham
mett's scouting report of that game,
will be no set-up. (See Hammett's
analysis on page seven.)
The Vandals, under their new
coach, Millard "Dixie" Howell, are
probably not entertaining any fool
ish hopes of scoring a Conference
victory over the Indians. But they
are serious about improving over
the 45-0 rout Ibe.v suffered last year
at Stanford's hands.
VANDALS HAVE GOO!) RACKS
They have little Billy Williams at
left halfback, a good passer, a tricky
runner, and an excellent kicker.
They have Willard Beit/., a promis
ing fullback, and Jim Hammond,
another capable halfback.
Howell has installed a Notre
Dame box as Idaho's offensive for
mation. His team lines up in a T.
and then shifts into the box. Against
Puget Sound, the Vandals used this
shift on practically all their plays,
but against Stanford tomorrow they
can be expected to work directly
from the T at least part of the time.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
exclusively a T - formation outfit.
Versatile Ainslie Bell, at his quar
terback posl under the center, starts
all the plays. Bell is a top-notch
passer, and he has a whole bevy of
bard-running backs to handle the
attack on the ground.
ANDERSON HIGHLY RATED
Halfbacks Bob Anderson, touted
as a likely candidate for All-Con
ference honors this year, speedy
Wayne Erickson, powerful Mickey
Titus, can all get up and go—along
with George Quist, who may not see
action tomorrow due to a bad ankle.
The Indians are also "loaded" j
with good fullbacks. They have two
relatively light, fast men in Martin
Anderson and Don Zappettini, and
they have two of the "rock-em,
sock-em" type in Chuck Coker and
Jim Nafziger.
In the starting line, along with
Dick Flatland at center, will be |
Gene Martin, a converted back, and j
big Ted Burke at ends. The tackle
assignments will go to 220-lb., 18- j
year-old Whit Budge and rough, I
aggressive "Pinky" Phleger. Marty j
Feldman, reliable 230-pounder, and
John Clark, handicapped by inju- i
ries last year, will man the guard |
posts.
Bay Area football patrons will probably give Si=mford's open
er with Idaho a wide berth tomorrow, preferring to be on hand at
Berkeley for Cal-Navy or at Kezar for Santa Clara-SMU, and the
vast reaches of Stanford Stadium may well echo with comparative
emptiness. But for the some 15,000 faithful, who are expected to

be present for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff.
Indian coach Marchie Schwartz will
unveil his 1947 entry in the Pacific
Coast Conference racc.
And, despite the anticipated slim
gathering, football experts the
country over will be appraising,
with calculating eye, Stanford's
performance in this first outing of
the season.
NOT TARRED FOR TITLE
The Indians are not generally
conceded much of a chance to snare
the PCC crown this year, but the
experts know that any Schwartz
coached Stanford squad cannot
lightly be counted out of the run
ning. Schwartz is a man who knows
how to get the most from the re
sources at his disposal, and his
teams have a disconcerting way of
upsetting the dope-sheets.
Stanford this year is a big ques
tion mark in the PCC picture.
There is a wealth of talented back
field material on the Farm, not
withstanding the loss of Lloyd Mer
riman.
LINK DOUBTFUL
But the situation in the line is
very much in doubt. Dick Flatland,
at center, will be the only return
ing regular in tomorrow's starling
forward wall.
The Indians have a total of 1(3 let
termen from H(4fj on their roster —
less than any other team in the con
ference.
Even Idaho, with 1!) lettermen
back from last year, can top Stan
ford in that, department.
If the Indian backs can come
through as anticipated, and if the
line rounds into a unit of compar
able quality, 1!>47 may be a happy
season for Stanford fans.
If not — well, at least the

Schwartzmen will be one of the
must colorful and interesting teams
on the Coast. Perhaps they might
never get into contention for the
championship, but they will be a
constant threat to the bin boys.
