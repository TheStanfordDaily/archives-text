# Frosh Booklet in November Will Aid Class Orientation
## 
### 
The Class of '51 Classbook will be published and available
in November, announced Bill McPherson, editor of the Stanford
Quad. The Classbook, published for the first time in several
years, will contain pictures of all members of the frosh class,
with their campus living group and home town indicated under

each picture. '"We feel that this
book will be a great assistance in
helping the Class of '51 become ac
quainted, in looking up blind dates,
and in finding members of the class
from the. same home town," Mc-
Pherson said.
Pictures used for this Classbook
will be the same pictures that are
used in the yearbook, the Quad, and
will be taken at the Quad office by
the well-known du Charme Studio
of San Francisco. Appointments for
the freshmen will begin Monday,
Sept. 30, and will continue until all
of the Class of '51 have been com
pleted. The appointment schedule
will be published in the Daily and
publicized throughout each of the
frosh living groups, and all appoint
ments must be kept promptly. Or
ders for the Class of '51 book, cost
ing $1, will be taken at the Quad
office during the first three weeks
of fall quarter. A limited number of
copics are being printed, and those
remaining after sales to the fresh
men will go on general sale to other
students.
"Every frosh should buy one for
reference through four years at
Stanford," McPherson slated, "and
this year if the Classbook is suc
cessful then the Quad will continue
to publish the Frosh Classbooks in
subsequent years. It is hoped that
every frosh will support this proj
ect."
