## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
article is an explanation of one of
Stanford's oldest traditions, the
Honor Code, as presented hy the
present chairman of the Honor
Code Standing Committee.)
Stanford's Honor Code is an inte
gral part of our tradition and of
our academic life. Briefly, as set
down in the constitution of the As
sociated Students, the Honor Code
is an undertaking of the students
individually and collectively pledg
ing:
1. That they will not give or re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give or receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prepa
ration of reports, or in any other
work that may be used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
2. That they will do their share
and take an active part in seeing to
it that others as well as themselves
obey the spirit and the letter of
the Honor Code.

The University on its part mani
fests its confidence in the honor of
its students by refraining from
proctoring examinations, or other
wise taking steps to prevent the ,
forms of dishonesty mentioned
above.
We are requested to affirm our
' support of the Honor Code by sign
ing a pledge in the registration
book. It is of utmost importance
that new students understand the
workings of the Code before sign
ing the pledge. Further informa
tion is available in the Honor Code
i booklet, available at the ASSU ol
