Student interest in the Army
ROTC program on the Stanford
campus seems to have reached an
all-time high but openings are still
available in all branches, Col. B. H.
Perry, professor of military science
and tactics, announced yesterday.
This year's Army ROTC program
I lion. Air Corps, Quartermaster
Corps, and Ordnance Corps are
again offered with a new "Com
bined Artillery" course to be offered
to aspiring reserve officers. The new
Combined Artillery corps is in line
with the War Department's reor
ganization program to integrate
coast and field artillery units into
one branch, Perry said.
All branches of the ROTC offer
two years of elementary and two
years of advanced instruction. Both
are elective. Graduates will receive
commissions in the reserves as sec
ond lieutenants.
Veterans with at least one year's
service can forego the two years of
elementary work and may enroll
immediately in the first-year ad
vanced training in the branch of
their choice. Information may be
obtained by calling at the Military
Department office in the SAC. Time
schedules carry further information
under "Military Science."
Veterans and non-vets alike are
eligible, with approximately $24 a
month allowance being given to
those enrolled in the advanced
course. This allowance will not af
fect veteran benefits. In addition to
the monetary allowance, each stu
dent is provided with uniforms and
texts.
Each of the four branches offers
a three-unit course which consists
of three hours per week instruc
tion on material pertaining to that
branch and a two-hour afternoon
period featuring instruction in
I leadership, military law, and drill.
