## 
### 
(Editor's note: Elva Eav Hrovvn. Counselor for Women, and Lawrence
A. Kimpton, newly appointed Dean of Students, take this opportunity
to semi messages to the new class of '51.)
I am particularly pleased this year to welcome the new students to the
Stanford campus and family. I am new to the campus too, coming back
after an absence of 15 years. I know that you are as pleased to be here
as I am. Let's make it an enjoyable and productive year.
L. A. KIMPTON
Dean of Students

New students . , , Welcome to Stanford.
We want you to know that we are as glad to have you with us as you
are happy to be here. Regardless of how, why, or from whence you have
come, our greetings are sincere and warm. You may be the young man
who cannot recall the first time he heard the word "Stanford" because his
is a Stanford family, or you may be the young man who after studying
college catalogs chose Stanford because of its fine academic program.
Perhaps you are the young woman who drives a new Cadillac each year,
or perhaps you are the young woman who must earn her board during the
college year and her tuition during her vacations. You could be the young ,
Chinese for the first time in this country, or a citizen >1 one of the South j
American Republics who knows this country like a book. Or you have
come because you live on the East Coast and Stanford is as far from home
as you can get, or perhaps you are here because your home is in Palo Alto.
Whatever your reason for being here, as a member of the Stanford
family every resource and service are at your command. Couched in our
words of welcome are an invitation to explore the many privileges your
admission includes and a plea not to overlook or ignore your many oppor
tunities as a member of tin.' Stanford family.
May I repeat, new students . . . Welcome to Stanford.
