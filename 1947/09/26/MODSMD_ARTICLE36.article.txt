MARTIN ANDERSON, no relation to halfback Bob, is one of a quartet
of high-class Stanford fullbacks. Marty is no power plunger, in the
Ernie Nevers-Nonn Standlee tradition, but he makes extremely good
use of his 186 pounds, and is regarded as an exceptionally speedy and
dangerous runner. An all-round man. Marty served as student body
president last year and was also captain of the Indians' 194(5 track team.
