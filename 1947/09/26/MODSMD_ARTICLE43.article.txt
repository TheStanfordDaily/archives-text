# Class of '51 Faces Challenge
## 
### 
Nearly 1,000 freshmen v/ill take part in pre
rcgistration activities at Stanford today. These
freshmen comprise the class of '51, a class
which, because of its homogeneity, will be
unique at Stanford this year.
The overwhelming majority of the new
freshmen graduated from high school this
spring. They are entering Stanford with no
previous college experience. Most expect to
graduate in 1951.
In contrast, the senior and junior classes
are composed of students who entered college,
went to war, and have now returned to com
plete their studies. Many did not attend Stan
ford before the war. Many will graduate three
and four years behind their regular classes.
Similarly the sophomore class is a product
of the war. Along with the younger students
are many veterans who went directly into the
service from high school and only last year
had the opportunity to begin their college
training.

This mutuality which exists among the mem
bers of the freshman class will be a definite
advantage to the class. It will be expressed
in increased class spirit. The class may be
expected as a group to take a greater interest
in campus activities. For example, Stanford
this year will field its first frosh football team
since 1941. A special frosh class booklet is
being printed by the Quad.
The freshman will have four years to "get
acguainted" with his classmates. Many life
time friendships will commence during these
four years.
In later years when he is a graduate, the
present freshman student will look back and
describe himself as a member of the class
of '51. The freshman class has the opportunity
to make that description one that every Stan
ford graduate will revere.
It's a challenge that faces each member of
the of '51 as he begins his four years
at Stanford.
