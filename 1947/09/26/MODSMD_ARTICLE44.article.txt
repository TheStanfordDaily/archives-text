Dr. George H. Houck, director of the service, which is unique
among American universities and provides complete medical,

surgical, and hospital care to all
.students on payment of the regular
tuition fee, said that the health
service offices on the campus have
been remodeled to provide more of
fice space, an additional doctor has
been added to the campus medical
staff, and new X-ray equipment se
cured. In addition to eye medical
service previously available, the
health service now provides for
regular visits of a certified eye spe
cialist to the campus offices.
An optional feature of the pro
gram provides that students may
make use of private physicians if
they do not wish to utilize the fa
cilities of the health service.
For the benefit of both new and
old students, the health service di
rector outlined the plan as it now
stands:

for all entering students. •
b) All medical and surgical care
and treatment.
c) Hospitalization up to 100 days
for any one injury or illness.
d) Laboratory tests. X-ray exami

ment distributed to students. While
the University will pay for 100 days'
hospitalization, including board,
room, and floor nursing- service, the
scope of the health program does
not include payment of charges for
special nurses, ambulance service,
or for expensive drugs, such as pen
icillin. Dental care, eye glasses, and
refraction for eye glasses are also
excluded. Dr. Houck also noted that
the health service program does not
duplicate protection which the stu
dents already have from other
sources. For example, injuries cov
ered by the provisions of the State
Labor Code relative to Workmen's
Compensation are exempted.
The University Health Service
makes available to students the
services of all physicians and sur
geons of the Palo Alto Clinic, in
cluding certified specialists in the
major specialties.

instances the student will go to the
Dean of Students' office (not to the
Director of the Health Service) and
inform the Dean of Students during
the registration period that he
wishes to use a physician not now
associated with the Health Service
program. At the same time the
student will nominate a licensed
doctor of medicine acceptable to the

the event of illness or injury, the
physician nominated by the student
will treat him, and his fee will be
paid by the University on a fee
schedule which has been approved
by the California Medical Associa
tion. The student will be entitled
to the 100 days' hospitalization fea

The Stanford University student health service program began
its second year of operation today with an enlarged staff, im
proved facilities, and new equipment.
Dr. George H. Houck, director of the service, which is unique
among American universities and provides complete medical,

surgical, and hospital care to all
.students on payment of the regular
tuition fee, said that the health
service offices on the campus have
been remodeled to provide more of
fice space, an additional doctor has
been added to the campus medical
staff, and new X-ray equipment se
cured. In addition to eye medical
service previously available, the
health service now provides for
regular visits of a certified eye spe
cialist to the campus offices.
An optional feature of the pro
gram provides that students may
make use of private physicians if
they do not wish to utilize the fa
cilities of the health service.
For the benefit of both new and
old students, the health service di
rector outlined the plan as it now
stands:
a) Complete physical examination
for all entering students. •
b) All medical and surgical care
and treatment.
c) Hospitalization up to 100 days
for any one injury or illness.
d) Laboratory tests. X-ray exami

which are listed in the official state
ment distributed to students. While
the University will pay for 100 days'
hospitalization, including board,
room, and floor nursing- service, the
scope of the health program does
not include payment of charges for
special nurses, ambulance service,
or for expensive drugs, such as pen
icillin. Dental care, eye glasses, and
refraction for eye glasses are also
excluded. Dr. Houck also noted that
the health service program does not
duplicate protection which the stu
dents already have from other
sources. For example, injuries cov
ered by the provisions of the State
Labor Code relative to Workmen's
Compensation are exempted.
The University Health Service
makes available to students the
services of all physicians and sur
geons of the Palo Alto Clinic, in
cluding certified specialists in the
major specialties.

flic facilities provided by (he Uni
versity.
Dr. Houck outlined the following
procedure, which will be necessary
for students who wish to decline the
Health Service facilities. In such
instances the student will go to the
Dean of Students' office (not to the
Director of the Health Service) and
inform the Dean of Students during
the registration period that he
wishes to use a physician not now
associated with the Health Service
program. At the same time the
student will nominate a licensed
doctor of medicine acceptable to the
University and who practices with
in 10 miles of the Administration
Building. Under this procedure, in
the event of illness or injury, the
physician nominated by the student
will treat him, and his fee will be
paid by the University on a fee
schedule which has been approved
by the California Medical Associa
tion. The student will be entitled
to the 100 days' hospitalization fea
ture of the plan, for any one injury
or illness, on the same basis as

The Stanford University student health service program began
its second year of operation today with an enlarged staff, im
proved facilities, and new equipment.
Dr. George H. Houck, director of the service, which is unique
among American universities and provides complete medical,

surgical, and hospital care to all
.students on payment of the regular
tuition fee, said that the health
service offices on the campus have
been remodeled to provide more of
fice space, an additional doctor has
been added to the campus medical
staff, and new X-ray equipment se
cured. In addition to eye medical
service previously available, the
health service now provides for
regular visits of a certified eye spe
cialist to the campus offices.
An optional feature of the pro
gram provides that students may
make use of private physicians if
they do not wish to utilize the fa
cilities of the health service.
For the benefit of both new and
old students, the health service di
rector outlined the plan as it now
stands:
a) Complete physical examination
for all entering students. •
b) All medical and surgical care
and treatment.
c) Hospitalization up to 100 days
for any one injury or illness.
d) Laboratory tests. X-ray exami
nations. dressings, splints, and
professional consultations.
e) Necessary house calls within 10
miles of the Administration
Building.
FEW LIMITATIONS TO SERVICE
There are few limitations to the
service, the director pointed out.
which are listed in the official state
ment distributed to students. While
the University will pay for 100 days'
hospitalization, including board,
room, and floor nursing- service, the
scope of the health program does
not include payment of charges for
special nurses, ambulance service,
or for expensive drugs, such as pen
icillin. Dental care, eye glasses, and
refraction for eye glasses are also
excluded. Dr. Houck also noted that
the health service program does not
duplicate protection which the stu
dents already have from other
sources. For example, injuries cov
ered by the provisions of the State
Labor Code relative to Workmen's
Compensation are exempted.
The University Health Service
makes available to students the
services of all physicians and sur
geons of the Palo Alto Clinic, in
cluding certified specialists in the
major specialties.
Students arc permitted to se
lect their own local physicians if
llicv do not wish lo make use of

flic facilities provided by (he Uni
versity.
Dr. Houck outlined the following
procedure, which will be necessary
for students who wish to decline the
Health Service facilities. In such
instances the student will go to the
Dean of Students' office (not to the
Director of the Health Service) and
inform the Dean of Students during
the registration period that he
wishes to use a physician not now
associated with the Health Service
program. At the same time the
student will nominate a licensed
doctor of medicine acceptable to the
University and who practices with
in 10 miles of the Administration
Building. Under this procedure, in
the event of illness or injury, the
physician nominated by the student
will treat him, and his fee will be
paid by the University on a fee
schedule which has been approved
by the California Medical Associa
tion. The student will be entitled
to the 100 days' hospitalization fea
ture of the plan, for any one injury
or illness, on the same basis as
other students.
