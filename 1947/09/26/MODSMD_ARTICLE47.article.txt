# Farm Traditions Show 'Family' Spirit
## 
### MARGIE HANSON 
The Stanford Family, down on the
Farm!
You're part of the group now,
J with all its traditions, which are the
tangible evidence*of a Family Spirit
unlike any other.
From the first time a senior says
"Hello" until you help lay the '51
bronze plaque in front of Memorial
Church, the Stanford spirit will grow
with you until it becomes something
you cherish always.
A friendly "Hello" to whomever
you pass on Quad is one of the
Farm's earliest traditions, and one
in which all participate. You real
ize this first perhaps when "Uncle
Don" greets you with a friendly nod
on Inner Quad.
Observance of law students' sole
rights to the Law steps (next to
the History corner steps) is a cus
tom not observed recently. For
merly women students using those
steps were whistled at by reclining
aspirants-at-law.
One of the most unique traditions
is the almost universal observance

of Mrs. Stanford's request that there
be rio smoking on Quad. There are
no penalties or punishments, but no
one is exempt from her request.
That's our way.
At times when the green bus is
late the Family's habit of giving
rides to Paly to those waiting by the
oak tree opposite the History corner
is helpful.
The Axe, forged in 189!) as a sym
bol of victory in the bitter rivalry
between the Farm and Cal, has be
come famous as the object of many
raids preceding the Big Game.
Freshmen have usually appointed
themselves its guardian, and until
the last raid in April, '4(5, when Cal
regained it for several months, it
was on view in the Cellar. The
police now have it in custody.
Also peculiar to Big Game week

are the Big Game Gaieties, a niu
sial extravaganza produced and di
rected by students; a jolly-up Fri
day afternoon preceding the game;
and an evening bonfire and rally.
A "pajamarino," in which freshmen
play a large part, is a feature of the
SC game.
Representatives of the senior class
place flowers each Sunday at the
Stanford Mausoleum in memory of
the University's founders. This
privilege is passed on each year by
the seniors.
Underlying all these things are
the Honor Code and the Funda
mental Standard, whereby we con
duct ourselves in the Stanford way
of life.

The Stanford Family, down on the
Farm!
You're part of the group now,
J with all its traditions, which are the
tangible evidence*of a Family Spirit
unlike any other.
From the first time a senior says
"Hello" until you help lay the '51
bronze plaque in front of Memorial
Church, the Stanford spirit will grow
with you until it becomes something
you cherish always.
A friendly "Hello" to whomever
you pass on Quad is one of the
Farm's earliest traditions, and one
in which all participate. You real
ize this first perhaps when "Uncle
Don" greets you with a friendly nod
on Inner Quad.
