# Full Slate For West Gridsters
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference teams
and Western independent elevens
, get into full-scale action this week
end. A few scattered games were
; played last week, but tonight, to
! morrow, and Sunday will mark thy
real grand opening of the 1947 sea
! son.
Tonight at Los Angeles the UCLA
i Bruins, last year's PCC champions,
will make their initial appearance
against a strong lowa team. Sound
ly trounced by a Uig Nine repre
sentative, Illinois, in the Rose Bowl
on Jan. 1, 1947, the Bruins will be
j looking for revenge against the
Midwestern league. lowa, however,
| is favored to make UCLA's opener
a losing venture.
Also tonight, San Jose State tries
for its first win of the young sea
son against the Hawaiian All-Stars.
The game will be played at San
I Jose.
Tomorrow's games:
California, with a new coach,
Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf, and a new
lease on life, meets Navy at Berke
ley. Despite the Bears' excellent
showing against Santa Clara, they
are on the underdog end of almost
I 2-1 odds for the Annapolis game.
Washington, in another intcrsec-
J tional contest, tangles with Minne
sota at Minneapolis. The Golden
Gophers, once the terror of the Big
| Nine, are not so highly regarded
this year, and Washington is con
ceded a good chance to turn in a
victory.
Washington State and Southern
California hook up in a conference
| clash at Los Angeles. The Trojans
i are favored to win.
Oregon runs up against a power
house Texas Longhorn team at Eu
| gene, with Texas a top-heavy fa-
J voritc.
Oregon State, perennially a strong
PCC title contender, figures to have
little trouble with Utah in their
game at Salt Lake City.
Montana meets a reportedly weak
i Portland University at Missoula.
Santa Clara meets a colorful
Southern Methodist team at Ke/.ar
I Stadium, with the Texas eleven fa
i vored ;o win.
St. Mary's and Hawaii clash in
j the Islands. The Gaels are tabbed
I to come out on top, but Hawaii is
expected to furnish stiff opposition
j for Wederneyer and Company.
Sunday's schedule:
A revitalized USK team tangles
with Nevada at Kezar. Coach Ed
j McKeever's Dons, fresh from a con
| vincing victory over San Jose State,
will have their work cut out for
' tfierri against the Wolfpack.
