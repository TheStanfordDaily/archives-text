# 'New' Idaho May Surprise; Team Boasts Agile Backs, Quick Openers—Hammett
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
Assistant Coach Ray Hammett returned to the Farm this week
from his scouting mission of the Idaho Puget Sound game and
urged c <ution when speaking of the Vandals as a "pushover" or
a "breeze" in tomorrow's grid opener.
Speaking for Head Coach Marchie Schwartz, Hammett said,
' Don't use last year's 45-0 score as a criterion. Idaho is new this
year. They have a new coach, new material, and, most of all, a
new spirit. This is definitely not the Idaho of old."

Hammett said that Dixie Howell,
new Vandal coach, has brought the
wide open Alabama system to the
Moscow campus. "They swept the
Puget Sound ends until the middle
opened up, and trap plays down the
center did the rest."
MUST STOP WILLIAMS
flammetl's scout report listed a
"must stop under the name of
Vandal halfback Billy Williams, the
"Spokane slim shot." Williams scored
two ol Idaho's four touchdowns,
passed to Williard Beit/., 175-pound
fullback, for a third; threw 11 of
Idaho's 12 passes, completed five—
and played a smart defensive game.
Concerning the Indian squad,
Hammett said that only one starter
is in doubt George Quist, right
halfback. "George has been plagu
ing the coaching staff to let him
start the game, but he is still a
doubtful tiller flue to an ankle
injury. Mickey Titus will get the
call if Gei rge i not ready by game
time."
Still the big question mark in the
eyes ol the Stanford assistant coach
is the line. "We are inexperienced
with the exception of Dick Flatland
;it center. The Idaho game will give
us the answer and the boys more
experience," he added.

Concerning the Indian squad,
Hammett said that only one starter
is in doubt George Quist, right
halfback. "George has been plagu
ing the coaching staff to let him
start the game, but he is still a
doubtful tiller flue to an ankle
injury. Mickey Titus will get the
call if Gei rge i not ready by game
time."
Still the big question mark in the
eyes ol the Stanford assistant coach
is the line. "We are inexperienced
with the exception of Dick Flatland
;it center. The Idaho game will give
us the answer and the boys more
experience," he added.

Assistant Coach Ray Hammett returned to the Farm this week
from his scouting mission of the Idaho Puget Sound game and
urged c <ution when speaking of the Vandals as a "pushover" or
a "breeze" in tomorrow's grid opener.
Speaking for Head Coach Marchie Schwartz, Hammett said,
' Don't use last year's 45-0 score as a criterion. Idaho is new this
year. They have a new coach, new material, and, most of all, a
new spirit. This is definitely not the Idaho of old."

Hammett said that Dixie Howell,
new Vandal coach, has brought the
wide open Alabama system to the
Moscow campus. "They swept the
Puget Sound ends until the middle
opened up, and trap plays down the
center did the rest."
MUST STOP WILLIAMS
flammetl's scout report listed a
"must stop under the name of
Vandal halfback Billy Williams, the
"Spokane slim shot." Williams scored
two ol Idaho's four touchdowns,
passed to Williard Beit/., 175-pound
fullback, for a third; threw 11 of
Idaho's 12 passes, completed five—
and played a smart defensive game.
