'J 'as year Mr. Fan will have a
comparatively easy job in doping !
out the rule changes in football. 1
Then; are three major modifications.
The one rule least likely to be
wilder playei or spectator involves :
moving the hall in from the side
ii'i" A loothall fie ld is 160 feet
wide, ,-uhl under the new rule two
mi will divide the gridiron later- j
ally in thirds. Instead of bringing j
the ball in 1!5 yards (45 feet), as I
under the old rule, il is now brought
in oih -third of the field's width (53
feet 4 inches).
Olhei than this, there are only
two oilier new football rules."
One i>l U>e two makes a blocked j
k k <>n a try lor point after touch
down dead then and there. The
ball cannot be picked up and car
ried over lor a score as before.
The most important rule change |
involvs permitting unlimited .sub
-i.ilulion ol one man. Any one man,
•i! any t:me between plays, can
without reporting inn onto the field,
'the man he replaces must then he
oil (he fi-• Id before play starts or a j
formal time out is charged to his
team.
Two oi more substitutions cannot |
be made in this manner. If more
than - ■• i< • man is to be sent into the

Not new regulation, but one that
ray.sed a little confusion at last
