## 
### 
Stanford has been informed by
the Veterans Administration that
the federal agency's office at Stan
ford will be closed as of Oct. 3. it
was announced yesterday by
George D. Barahal, director of the
Stanford Veterans Bureau and
Guidance Center.
Reductions in personnel were the
cause of the shutdown of the cam
pus Veterans Administration office,
the University was notified.
Beginning with the autumn quar
ter, veterans with delayed subsist
ence check problems, insurance
problems, or applications for cer
tificates of eligibility must deal di
rectly with the Veterans Adminis
tration Regional Office, 49 Fourth
Street, San Francisco, Barahal said.
Barahal emphasized that the Uni
versity will continue its functions of
the Veterans Records Office and
will continue to offer vocational
guidance to veterans in its guid
ance center. He pointed out that
both of these activities are Univer
sity functions and are in no way
affected bv the curtailment of the
Veterans Administration service on
the campus.
As an aid in insuring that sub
sistence payments are correctly and
promptly made, Barahal suggested
that each veteran keep all corre

spondewe from the Veterans Ad
ministration in a file similar to that
which lie kept while in service.
Then, when a trip to the Veterans
Administration Office is necessary,
he will be able to supply adequate
information in order to speed up
receipt of subsistence cheeks.
Barahal further cautioned that
procedures within the Veterans Ad
ministration offices will be slowed
down by their reduction in person
nel and will result in more than
usual delay in handling the sub
sistence check problem. Wherever
possible. Barahal continued, it will
be wise for veterans to secure suffi
cient funds to meet living cbsts dur
ing the fall quarter.
Problems of disabled veterans at
tending Stanford under Public Law
1(5 will be handled by periodic visits
of Veterans Administration training
officers to the campus. Barahal said
that the schedule of these visits was
not as yet available, but would be
announced when received from the
Veterans Admin istra tion.
At the same time Barahal an
nounced that Burns B. Young, for
merly registration officer on the
campus for the Veterans Adminis
tration, has been appointed by the
University to assist in the veterans
record office.

the Veterans Administration that
the federal agency's office at Stan
ford will be closed as of Oct. 3. it
was announced yesterday by
George D. Barahal, director of the
Stanford Veterans Bureau and
Guidance Center.
Reductions in personnel were the
cause of the shutdown of the cam
pus Veterans Administration office,
the University was notified.
Beginning with the autumn quar
ter, veterans with delayed subsist
ence check problems, insurance
problems, or applications for cer
tificates of eligibility must deal di
rectly with the Veterans Adminis
tration Regional Office, 49 Fourth
Street, San Francisco, Barahal said.
Barahal emphasized that the Uni
versity will continue its functions of
the Veterans Records Office and
will continue to offer vocational
guidance to veterans in its guid
ance center. He pointed out that
both of these activities are Univer
sity functions and are in no way
affected bv the curtailment of the
Veterans Administration service on
the campus.
As an aid in insuring that sub
sistence payments are correctly and
promptly made, Barahal suggested
that each veteran keep all corre

spondewe from the Veterans Ad
ministration in a file similar to that
which lie kept while in service.
Then, when a trip to the Veterans
Administration Office is necessary,
he will be able to supply adequate
information in order to speed up
receipt of subsistence cheeks.
Barahal further cautioned that
procedures within the Veterans Ad
ministration offices will be slowed
down by their reduction in person
nel and will result in more than
usual delay in handling the sub
sistence check problem. Wherever
possible. Barahal continued, it will
be wise for veterans to secure suffi
cient funds to meet living cbsts dur
ing the fall quarter.
Problems of disabled veterans at
tending Stanford under Public Law
1(5 will be handled by periodic visits
of Veterans Administration training
officers to the campus. Barahal said
that the schedule of these visits was
not as yet available, but would be
announced when received from the
Veterans Admin istra tion.
At the same time Barahal an
nounced that Burns B. Young, for
merly registration officer on the
campus for the Veterans Adminis
tration, has been appointed by the
University to assist in the veterans
record office.
