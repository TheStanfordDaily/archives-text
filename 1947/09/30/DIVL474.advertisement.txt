"In Business for Your Pleasure''
No Wires
For the new strop-less gowns . . . wide cut necklines . . . sheer
blouses, this is a new "glamor lift." Not until Formfit could tell
it, "Here is the strap-less bra that really stays up" could we give
it the last word on this question. Now here it is—the honest
Formfit answer to your prayer! Nite-Life automatically hugs you
as it lifts, corrects, molds . . . thanks to its exclusive Formfit
design arid elastic control. White and Tea Rose, $4.00.
