# Truman Sets 'D-Day' for Starvation
## 'Special Session Is Needed To Hall European Famine' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP). —President Truman warned Congres
sional leaders today that Dec. 1 is the starvation deadline for western
Europe. He asked an early meeting of the Senate and House Foreign
Relations and Appropriations committees to consider raising $580,000,000
for emergency relief.
After a long meeting with leaders of both parties, Mr. Truman said
he saw no way of getting help to ♦ 1

the European people this winter
without a special session of Con
gress.
The executive arm of this gov
ernment, he said, can scrape up
only enough money to meet the
emergency for the next two months.
After that it will be up to Congress.
NO DECISION YET
But he said no decision has been
reached on a special session and
indicated clearly the decision will
rest with the Republican-controlled
foreign and appropriations commit
tees.
It' they do not approve his $580,-
j 000,000 emergency relief proposal,
i there would be no point in calling a
I special session, he pointed out.
The 11 Democratic and Republi
can Congressional leaders who dis
! cussed the crisis with Mr. Truman
j and a group of administration ad-
I visers were reluctant to say how
I they viewed the emergency.
(In Topeka, Kan., Speaker of the
5 House Joseph Martin said there "un
doubtedly will be a special session
of Congress in mid-November in
view of President Truman's request
for an early meeting of House and
Senate Appropriations and Foreign
| Relations committees.)
But House GOP Boss Charles A.
j Halleck of Indiana said as he left
the President's office he still thought
the decision on a special session was
up to Mr. Truman.
TAKE INITIATIVE'
"There is no suggestion from any
j one at this time for the (Republi
can) leadership to take the initia
tive and call Congress together," he
said.
In an unusually grave mood as
he talked, Mr. Truman said that, as
a result of the Congressional con
ference, he is writing the chairmen
of the foreign relations and appro
priation committees asking them to
| convene as soon as possible to ex
| amine the emergency relief prob
lem. He called this "the necessary
first step."
The committees would' study the
entire situation and presumably
would report findings upon which
the special session decision would
I be based. In effect, this places the
j problem in the laps of Congres
! sional leaders.


THIS AGED GREEK WOMAN, hungrily gobbling stew from a pail,
is typical of hundreds of thousands of Europeans. President Truman
warned yesterday that Dec. 1 is the "deadline for winter starvation in

THIS AGED GREEK WOMAN, hungrily gobbling stew from a pail,
is typical of hundreds of thousands of Europeans. President Truman
warned yesterday that Dec. 1 is the "deadline for winter starvation in
Europe."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP). —President Truman warned Congres
sional leaders today that Dec. 1 is the starvation deadline for western
Europe. He asked an early meeting of the Senate and House Foreign
Relations and Appropriations committees to consider raising $580,000,000
for emergency relief.
After a long meeting with leaders of both parties, Mr. Truman said
he saw no way of getting help to ♦ 1

the European people this winter
without a special session of Con
gress.
The executive arm of this gov
ernment, he said, can scrape up
only enough money to meet the
emergency for the next two months.
After that it will be up to Congress.
NO DECISION YET
But he said no decision has been
reached on a special session and
indicated clearly the decision will
rest with the Republican-controlled
foreign and appropriations commit
tees.
It' they do not approve his $580,-
j 000,000 emergency relief proposal,
i there would be no point in calling a
I special session, he pointed out.
The 11 Democratic and Republi
can Congressional leaders who dis
! cussed the crisis with Mr. Truman
j and a group of administration ad-
I visers were reluctant to say how
I they viewed the emergency.
(In Topeka, Kan., Speaker of the
5 House Joseph Martin said there "un
doubtedly will be a special session
of Congress in mid-November in
view of President Truman's request
for an early meeting of House and
Senate Appropriations and Foreign
| Relations committees.)
But House GOP Boss Charles A.
j Halleck of Indiana said as he left
the President's office he still thought
the decision on a special session was
up to Mr. Truman.
TAKE INITIATIVE'
"There is no suggestion from any
j one at this time for the (Republi
can) leadership to take the initia
tive and call Congress together," he
said.
In an unusually grave mood as
he talked, Mr. Truman said that, as
a result of the Congressional con
ference, he is writing the chairmen
of the foreign relations and appro
priation committees asking them to
| convene as soon as possible to ex
| amine the emergency relief prob
lem. He called this "the necessary
first step."
The committees would' study the
entire situation and presumably
would report findings upon which
the special session decision would
I be based. In effect, this places the
j problem in the laps of Congres
! sional leaders.
