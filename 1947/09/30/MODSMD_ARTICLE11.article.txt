WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 (UP).â€”
Former Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes today rejected an invitation
from Premier Marshal Tito of Yugo
slavia to take part in an on-the-spot
investigation of reputed Yugoslav
aggression in the Balkans.
He said the question of determin
ing whether Yugoslavia's attitude lo
ward Greece is threatening world
peace is for the United Nations to
decide, and not one for "determina
tion hy a group of private citizens
of the United States."
"My agreement to participate in
such an investigation as a member
of a group of private citizens might
prejudice action by the United
Nations, Byrnes said in a telegram to
Yugoslav Ambassador Sava N. Ko
sanovic in New York. "For that rea
son I cannot accept the invitation."
Tito's invitation to Byrnes and five
other Americans to visit Yugoslavia
and "see for themselves" what the
"true situation" is on the Greek-
Yugoslav border was made public
last Friday.
