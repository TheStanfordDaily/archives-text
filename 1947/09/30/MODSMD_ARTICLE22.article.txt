place at the head of a line of 7,500
students which were predicted to
appear at the Registrar's window
The three Encina men, Derek
Bok, Skeet Peeler, and Tony Liebiq,
took up the vigil at midnight Sun
day, and catnapped on blankets and
pillows while fellow freshmen dozed
in their own warm cots. Two oth
ers, Raymond E. Williams and Oti:;
Sullivan, came in a close second at
12:02 a.m. The campers were pro
vided transportation to highway
breakfast huts by goodnatured ac
quaintances as dawn broke.
First woman in line was Shirley
Preston, Robleite, who took up the
47th position in line six and a half
hours later. Miss Preston's break
fast consisted of an apple saved
from the Sunday snack. Two bun -
dred more men followed the lone
coed before another freshman wom
an appeared.
With the line extending down the
entire east side of the Quad, thn
doors were thrown hack to the
crowd at 7:10 a.m. Spirits rose a;Â»
office lights glowed at 7:30, and the
first registration booklet was hand
