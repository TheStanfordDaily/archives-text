'Tragedy hit the campus with the
violent deaths of three Farm stu
dents. Track star Frank Ganahl
was killed in an auto accident in
June; John Hood, mountain-climb
< is Alpha Sigma Phi, was fatally in
jured in a fall on the Devil's Slide
area on the San Mateo coast; and
si year-old Russell Haekctt of Bur-
Img.ime was drowned while fishing
in a private lake near Tahoe.
These somber moments were par

; tially balanced by lighter incidents
j such as the howls of hash
j ers for an Excom investigation of
I the reasoning behind the demand
| that they wear ties and while shirts
while standing behind the steaming
serving counters; and harried
Alumni Director Pete Allen's sud
den plunging into a tedious ques
tion: how long will the supply of
spaces for the bronze senior class
plates in front of Memorial Church
last? He found there was no im
mediate cause for concern. There
are sufficient spaces to last until the
year 8297.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES MADE
Scientific advancements of conse
j quence were reported from Farm
| laboratories. Dr. Lester Fields of
j the School of Engineering devel
| oped a traveling-wave radio tube
which will greatly facilitate the ex-
I pansion of commercial television,
j Dr. Hubert S. Loring, professor of
biochemistry, was credited with de
j veloping a polio vaccine which lab-
I oratory tests on rats showed to pos
j sess qualities of producing high
j rates of immunity.
Families and couples occupied the

women's Row houses with only the
occasional Friday or Saturday night
homecomings of tong men to arouse
the children or peace-seekers.
Branner and Roble halls were
closed to women with the latter
serving as a hotel to visiting con
ventioneers. Lagunita was open to
undergi adautes while Union housed
the graduate women.
VILLAGE STORES OPEN
Stanford Village, concerned most
ly with married couples and a small
scattering of single men and women
students, inaugurated the opening
of a butcher shop and grocery store.
Grounds improvements centered for
the most part around the construc
tion of a loading-point for campus
bound Village hitchhikers on the
Ravenswond Avenue entrance.
While students quietly discussed
the bombshell news of Merriman's
pro baseball contract, the local
Democratic Club was split asunder
when its founder, Farm Professor
Thomas E. Barclay, and 2G others
bolted the organization after the
group had indorsed Henry Wallace
as Democratic candidate for Presi
dent in 48.

tion: how long will the supply of
spaces for the bronze senior class
plates in front of Memorial Church
last? He found there was no im
mediate cause for concern. There
are sufficient spaces to last until the
year 8297.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES MADE
Scientific advancements of conse
j quence were reported from Farm
| laboratories. Dr. Lester Fields of
j the School of Engineering devel
| oped a traveling-wave radio tube
which will greatly facilitate the ex-
I pansion of commercial television,
j Dr. Hubert S. Loring, professor of
biochemistry, was credited with de
j veloping a polio vaccine which lab-
I oratory tests on rats showed to pos
j sess qualities of producing high
j rates of immunity.
Families and couples occupied the

women's Row houses with only the
occasional Friday or Saturday night
homecomings of tong men to arouse
the children or peace-seekers.
Branner and Roble halls were
closed to women with the latter
serving as a hotel to visiting con
ventioneers. Lagunita was open to
undergi adautes while Union housed
the graduate women.
VILLAGE STORES OPEN
Stanford Village, concerned most
ly with married couples and a small
scattering of single men and women
students, inaugurated the opening
of a butcher shop and grocery store.
Grounds improvements centered for
the most part around the construc
tion of a loading-point for campus
bound Village hitchhikers on the
Ravenswond Avenue entrance.
While students quietly discussed
the bombshell news of Merriman's
pro baseball contract, the local
Democratic Club was split asunder
when its founder, Farm Professor
Thomas E. Barclay, and 2G others
bolted the organization after the
group had indorsed Henry Wallace
as Democratic candidate for Presi
dent in 48.

(urination. Dr. Pollock, late from

General Lueirn Clay, and one of the
nation's top experts on German af

Accenting student awareness of
renditions abroad were the periodic
i t poets from Stanford's two stu
dent observers, Lawrence "Shorty"
Grannis and Bill Farrer. Selected
1.1 I spring by the ASSU's Inter
national Survey Committee, Gran
nis and Farrer left the United States
. board the SS Marine Jumper in
June.
Tlim..; STUDENTS DIE
'Tragedy hit the campus with the
violent deaths of three Farm stu
dents. Track star Frank Ganahl
was killed in an auto accident in
June; John Hood, mountain-climb
< is Alpha Sigma Phi, was fatally in
jured in a fall on the Devil's Slide
area on the San Mateo coast; and
si year-old Russell Haekctt of Bur-
Img.ime was drowned while fishing
in a private lake near Tahoe.
These somber moments were par

; tially balanced by lighter incidents
j such as the howls of hash
j ers for an Excom investigation of
I the reasoning behind the demand
| that they wear ties and while shirts
while standing behind the steaming
serving counters; and harried
Alumni Director Pete Allen's sud
den plunging into a tedious ques
tion: how long will the supply of
spaces for the bronze senior class
plates in front of Memorial Church
last? He found there was no im
mediate cause for concern. There
are sufficient spaces to last until the
year 8297.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES MADE
Scientific advancements of conse
j quence were reported from Farm
| laboratories. Dr. Lester Fields of
j the School of Engineering devel
| oped a traveling-wave radio tube
which will greatly facilitate the ex-
I pansion of commercial television,
j Dr. Hubert S. Loring, professor of
biochemistry, was credited with de
j veloping a polio vaccine which lab-
I oratory tests on rats showed to pos
j sess qualities of producing high
j rates of immunity.
Families and couples occupied the

women's Row houses with only the
occasional Friday or Saturday night
homecomings of tong men to arouse
the children or peace-seekers.
Branner and Roble halls were
closed to women with the latter
serving as a hotel to visiting con
ventioneers. Lagunita was open to
undergi adautes while Union housed
the graduate women.
VILLAGE STORES OPEN
Stanford Village, concerned most
ly with married couples and a small
scattering of single men and women
students, inaugurated the opening
of a butcher shop and grocery store.
Grounds improvements centered for
the most part around the construc
tion of a loading-point for campus
bound Village hitchhikers on the
Ravenswond Avenue entrance.
While students quietly discussed
the bombshell news of Merriman's
pro baseball contract, the local
Democratic Club was split asunder
when its founder, Farm Professor
Thomas E. Barclay, and 2G others
bolted the organization after the
group had indorsed Henry Wallace
as Democratic candidate for Presi
dent in 48.
