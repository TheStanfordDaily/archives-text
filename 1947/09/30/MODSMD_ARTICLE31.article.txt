# Low Power Radio Sets New Record
## 
### 
Four Stanford radio "hams" set, a
new record for 10-centimeter two
â–  way radio transmission Saturday
morning. They held over an hour's
communication at 31 miles with less
power than is required to operate
a very dim flashlight.
David L. Thompson originated the
plan, and he was assisted by Rob
ert D. Smith, Lester Roberts, and
O. G. Villard Jr.
Thompson and Smith set up por
table equipment at Lick Observa
tory on Mount Hamilton, 31 miles
from the Stanford Radio Club sta
tion W6YX. After a few minutes
of transmission Roberts and Villard
caught the signal with excellent in
ception.
Tubes used in both transmitters
were reflex klystrons designed dur
ing the war for high frequency mili
tary purposes by W. W. Hansen and
A. H. Varian, both physics profes
sors at Stanford. The men used
Army-Navy surplus radar intercept
receivers developed at Harvard's
radio research laboratories under
the direction of Dean F. E. Terman
of the Stanford School of Engineer
ing.
