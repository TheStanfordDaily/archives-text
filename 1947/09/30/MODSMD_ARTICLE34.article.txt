# Stanford Absorbs 19-16 Upset Defeat by Vandals; Heads for Game with Second Best Team in Nation
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Next: MICHIGAN.
Stanford's chagrined football team, after absorbing a nerve
shattering upset defeat from surprisingly strong Idaho, 19 to 16,
before 15,000 witnesses in Stanford Stadium Saturday, leaves this
alternoon for Ann Arbor, where it will run up against an awe-

inspiring Wolverine juggernaut this
weekend.
And, whereas Idaho is virtually
unseeded in national rankings, the
Wolverines are rated second in the
country with only Notre Dame
ahead ol them on the form sheets.
What is more, the Indians will
probably not be at anywhere near
lull strength for the game. A 1 Rau,
capable 200-pound tackle, is con
sidered lost for the season, with
badly torn leg ligaments and a
fractured ankle. George Quist, first
* I ring right halfback, also has a
fractured ankle, sustained in a prac
tice session. Quist was not in uni
form for the Idaho contest.
ANDERSON INJURED
Bob Anderson, Stanford's candi
date for all-Conference halfback
honors, has a bruised collarbone
and possibly other injuries as yet
undetermined. It is not known
whether lie will be ready for action
against Michigan.
Marty Anderson, Marty Feldman,
and Mickey Titus are also on the in
jured list, but their hurts are not re
garded as serious.
As for the Idaho debacle —it was
just one of those things. Innumer
able reasons have been advanced to
explain the Vandals' stunning up
set. Yon can take your choice of:
1. An overrated Stanford.
2. An underrated Idaho.
u. A too-cocky, too-sure attitude
on the part of the Indians.
4. Stanford's pointing overly much
for the Michigan game.
5. A weak Stanford line, especially
on the defensive.
(1. A sieve-like pass defense that
permitted Idaho receivers to get out
into the open, behind the secondary,
for the Vandals' last two touchdowns.
INDIANS START FAST
The Indians started out in the first
quarter as if they were going to an
nihilate the Vandals. On the first
play from scrimmage, Bob Ander
son roared around his own right end
for 33 yards to the Idaho 40. A
holding penalty set Stanford back to
its 45. From there, Mickey Titus
powered through the middle of the
line to the Idaho 38.
A pass from Ainslie Bell to end
Gene Martin gave Stanford a first
down 25 yards from pay dirt. But
then, another holding penalty and a
( lipping penalty, refused by Idaho,
.'.tailed the Indians' attack moment

arily. (Stanford was penalized a
total of 110 yards in the game.)
Idaho punted out of bounds on
the Indians' 44. and Stanford took
over. Bob Anderson was held for
no gain; Mickey Titus fumbled, re
covered, and lost 5 yards.'
That made it third down. Bell
faded back and tossed a leisurely
pass to Gene Martin, in the clear on
Idaho's 32. Martin galloped across
without a hand being laid on him,
and Stanford had six points, just five
minutes into the first period. Marty
Feldman's conversion kick was wide.
It looked effortless, simple.
STANFORD RAMBLES
Eight minutes later, the Indians
scored again. After an Idaho quick
kick gave Stanford the ball on its
own 23, Bob Anderson skirted right
end for a first down to the 37.
Martin Anderson worked the other
flank for nine yards to the 46.
Then Bell pitched a strike to
Martin, who caught on the Idaho
25. Bob Anderson put a block on
the only Vandal in Ihe vicinity, and
Martin was off to the races. Feld
man's conversion was good, and
Stanford was out in front, 13 to 0.
Schwartz sent in his second string
as the second quarter got under
way, and Idaho began to roll.
Sparked by halfbacks Billy Wil
liams and Gerald Diehl, and by full
back Willard Beitz, the Vandals ran
and passed their way 85 yards to a
touchdown, Diehl scoring from 10
yards out. Wilford Overgaard failed
to convert. 13 to 6.
Soon after the start of the third
quarter, the Indians' first team got
to work. They took an Idaho quick
kick on their own 21. Martin An
derson went around right end for 25
yards. Titus made 3 into the line.
Then Martin Anderson broke into
the clear around left end and almost
went all the way. Gerald Diehl
finally dragged him down from be
hind on the Idaho 22.
FELDMAN ADDS THREE
The future looked bright. Titus
broke through the line for 15 yards
to the 7. But, at that point, Idaho
held. A fumble and an offside pen
alty moved the ball back to the 17.
On fourth down, Feldman was sent
in to try a field goal.
His kick was perfect. Stanford led,
16 to G, a safe margin, or so it seemed.

TROUBLESOME little Billy
Williams (rets stopped on a punt
runhack by Stanford's Whit Budj;c
in this picture, taken in the lirst
quarter of the Indian-Idaho name.
But the 165-pound sparkplug of
the Vandals' attack wasn't stopped
for long. He engineered three Ida
ho Tl)'s during the afternoon.
Williams connected with it out of
2(1 passes, and most of the com
pletions led to Idaho scores.
He was a constant thorn in the
Indians' side throughout the game.
