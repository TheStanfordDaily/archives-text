Marchie Schwartz, the man from
Louisiana, shook his head and
walked into the Cardinal dressing
room. His team had just been beat
en by an Idaho eleven which re
fused to believe Ihe experts when
they prophesied that the Vandals
would lose by at least three touch
downs.
"They played a heads-up, aggres
sive ball game," Schwartz said, in
reference to Idaho. "We were miss
ing somehow."
Somebody said Ihat "Williams
(who played left half for Idaho)
was only playing intramural foot
ball last year."
"He was a good boy," Marchie
said, "one of the best players on
the field."
Amid the steam and fog appeared
a strange lot of dejected and un
happy people- patient but stunned
coaches, old grads, and players.
"We were pretty weak on pass
defense," Schwartz exclaimed, "and
we'll have to brush up on that be
fore we leave for Michigan."
"You can sas the game was just
one of those things," he said. "We
had no zip."
