# Crew Calls For Rookies
## 
### 
Stanford's unsponsored, unrecog
nized, but active crewmen will hold
their first meeting of the quarter,
for varsity and frosh alike, next
Monday at 4:15 p.m. on the lawn
of the SAC.
With an eye toward the incoming
freshmen as recruits, the crewmen
plan to hold fall practice where
oarsmen will learn rowing tech
nique, in preparation for next
spring's meets. Frosh can sign up
in Physical Education 127 for this
sport. Workouts will be held on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of
each week at 3:15 p.m.
Although Athletic Director Al
Masters cannot carry crew racing
as a regular sport because of finan
cial reasons, the crew enthusiasts,
under the direction of Lou Lindsey,
plan to organize and hold races with
California, Oregon State, and Sac
ramento JC. A meet with Washing
ton is in the offing.
The freshman boats will need
about eight or ten men as cox
swains. Best weight for these men
is 100 to 130 pounds.
General physical requirements for
the oarsmen are listed as: height,
six feet and over; and weight, 1(50
to 200 pounds. *
