# 1947 Series Opens Today! Yanks Choice Over Bums
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP). The
Favored New York Yankees and the
undaunted Brooklyn Dodgers pro
i laimed themselves lit and confident j
of victory tonight on the eve of the j
l'J47 world series.
It will be rookie righthander I
Frank (Spec) Shea for the Bronx i
Bombers and probably "Rillin'
Ralph" Branca for the beloved
Bums when the two champions
square oil at Yankee stadium at 1:30 |
p.m. EST tomorrow.
With a lucky crowd of 73,000
expected to jam the house that Ruth
built, despite a forecast of scattered
showers, the first nickel classic
since IU4I may be the richest in
baseball history. But on top of that
it was expected to be one of the I
most bitterly fought, with the Dodg
ers seeking vengeance for their de
feat of that year by the Yanks.
BAT PRACTICE FEATURED
As fever mounted with the sub
way classic only a few hours away,
both clubs went through iinal work
outs with the accent on hitting. The
Yankees bombarded the stands at
the stadium for an hour and a half
and the Dodgers belted away lustily
for three hours at six' batting prac
tice hurlers.
Manager Burt Shotton still de
layed announcing his pitching choice
for the first game on the grounds
that it might give his nominee the
jitters. But his selection an hour
before game time was expected to
j be Branca, 21-game winner and
bellwether of the Dodger staff. Other
j possibilities, however, were south
paws Vic Lombardi or Joe Hatten.
But Yankee manager Bucky Har
ris ridiculed such reasoning as he
shattered all Yankee precedent in
naming a freshman dinger to open
for the Yanks in their 15th shot at
the classic.
HARRIS LAUDS SHEA
"He has proved to me that he has
what it takes," Harris said of the
lad from Naugatuek, Conn., who
will celebrate his 25th birthday two
days after the series opens. "Shea

won 14 games for us and this won't
worry him."
Shea will be the first freshman
opener since Paul Derringer started
the series for the Cards as a rookie
in 1931. But Harris went even fur
ther when he named Larry (Yogi)
Berra, another rookie, as catcher
for the first all-freshman battery in
series history.
The Yankees were in top condition
except for George (Snuffy) Stirn
weiss who said he was still a bit

bothered i.y ;i chest cold. The chunky
second baseman, who missed the
final name of Ihe reason, took extra
cuts in sharpening his hatting eye.
YANKS lIAVF "NO WOKKIKS"
"We aren't worried about the
Dodgers," Harris said as he sur
veyed ljis squad, "lint, then, they
don't seem to be worried about us."
Meanwhile, (he Dodgers went
through a long workout at Kbbets
Field, us inr up six battinj.; practice
