# 'Injuries and Pointing Hurt Team': Merriman
## 
### 
"If none of the Farm gridders
had been injured in the Stanford-
Idaho game Saturday, our chances
for team improvement would be
100 per cent greater," Lloyd Mer
riman, 1946 star Stanford full
back, said yesterday.
"I believe we have a much bet
ter team than what we saw Sat
urday, but they were possibly
pointing too much for next Sat
urday's intersectional game with
Michigan," he added.
"Michigan has a good team,"
Merriman added, "and I think
Stanford will be further handi
capped by a lack of reserves to
fall back on for added support."
Merriman believes there will be
fewer substitutions than in the
Idaho game, as some of the subs
playing against the Vandals were
probably being tested in actual
battle.
