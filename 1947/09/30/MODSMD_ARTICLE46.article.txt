SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2'» (UP).
| —"We lose to Idaho and beat Michi
' pan," exclaimed Stanford's hand-
I some Marehie Schwartz.
"Boy, what ;i story that will
make!"
It may be (lie exuberance of a
j youthful head grid mentor, but the
j former Notre Dame star believes in
I miracles. Also:
"My team is capable of anything,
j We have a flock of sophonmies and
they may kick the ball around, or
I they may turn in a whale of a
I game."
Schwartz told the weekly meeting
of the Northern California Football
Writers' Association that def
initely was "no pushover."
"Dixie Howell has done a fine
coaching job at Idaho," said Mareh
ie. "They have a fighting ball
club; and they tackled and blocked
well. Howell should be proud of
his small squad."
Schwartz knows he is running
into a ball club at Michigan that is
touted as one of the greatest in the
nation.
"Our scout, Mai Edwards, re
ported that Michigan looked a cinch
for the Rose Bowl as the Big Nine
representative, off their showing
against. Michigan State on Saturday.
They had a third team as good as
the first," explained Marehie.
"But the report didn't scare me
any. I never have seen the team
I that couldn't be beaten."
Other coaches reported:
LYNN WALDORF, California—"l
found plenty wrong with our team
when we beat Navy. The offensive
of both teams was far behind the
defensives; outside of the flukes,
neither team was able to put on a
sustained drive to reach the 20-yard
i line.
"Jackie Jensen is the important
j man on our club, both in kicking
| and running. Our second line, for
I the second week in a row, was
stronger than our first."
JIMMY PHELAN, St. Mary's -y
"We're in poor shape for the Cali
fornia game; Wedemeyer has a foot
injury; Spike Cordeiro is definitely
out; Dennis O'Connor may be back,
but just how good he'll be we don't
know after that long attack of boils;
| and Willie Modrcin has a shoulder
injury."
LEN CASANOVA, Santa Clara—
"Doak Walker of Southern Metho
dist is the finest back I've seen this
year. SMU was all it was cracked
up to be. We were prepared for a
heavy passing attack, but didn't ex-
I pect them to be so powerful on the
I ground."

ie. "They have a fighting ball
club; and they tackled and blocked
well. Howell should be proud of
his small squad."
Schwartz knows he is running
into a ball club at Michigan that is
touted as one of the greatest in the
nation.
"Our scout, Mai Edwards, re
ported that Michigan looked a cinch
for the Rose Bowl as the Big Nine
representative, off their showing
against. Michigan State on Saturday.
They had a third team as good as
the first," explained Marehie.
"But the report didn't scare me
any. I never have seen the team
I that couldn't be beaten."
Other coaches reported:
LYNN WALDORF, California—"l
found plenty wrong with our team
when we beat Navy. The offensive
of both teams was far behind the
defensives; outside of the flukes,
neither team was able to put on a
sustained drive to reach the 20-yard
i line.
"Jackie Jensen is the important
j man on our club, both in kicking
| and running. Our second line, for
I the second week in a row, was
stronger than our first."
JIMMY PHELAN, St. Mary's -y
"We're in poor shape for the Cali
fornia game; Wedemeyer has a foot
injury; Spike Cordeiro is definitely
out; Dennis O'Connor may be back,
but just how good he'll be we don't
know after that long attack of boils;
| and Willie Modrcin has a shoulder
injury."
LEN CASANOVA, Santa Clara—
"Doak Walker of Southern Metho
dist is the finest back I've seen this
year. SMU was all it was cracked
up to be. We were prepared for a
heavy passing attack, but didn't ex-
I pect them to be so powerful on the
I ground."
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2'» (UP).
| —"We lose to Idaho and beat Michi
' pan," exclaimed Stanford's hand-
I some Marehie Schwartz.
"Boy, what ;i story that will
make!"
It may be (lie exuberance of a
j youthful head grid mentor, but the
j former Notre Dame star believes in
I miracles. Also:
"My team is capable of anything,
j We have a flock of sophonmies and
they may kick the ball around, or
I they may turn in a whale of a
I game."
Schwartz told the weekly meeting
of the Northern California Football
Writers' Association that def
initely was "no pushover."
"Dixie Howell has done a fine
coaching job at Idaho," said Mareh
