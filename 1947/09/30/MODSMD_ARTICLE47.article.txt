Tlie massive cyclotron has a slen
der, atom-smashing rival, according
to Dr. William W. Hansen, director
of the Stanford Microwave Labora
tory.
Dr. Hansen described the success
ful operation of an electron linear
accelerator to the Institute of Radio
Engineers at their West Coast Con
vention in San Francisco.
The Stanford physicist, co-in
ventor of the Klystron, heart of
wartime microwave radar, reported
that a three-foot section of the elec
tion accelerator has produced elec
trons of more than a-million-and-a
half volts.


DR. W. W. HANSEN, Farm physicist, recently described operation of new electron linear accelerator
