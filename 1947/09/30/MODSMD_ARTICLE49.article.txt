# VA Closes Campus Office
## 
### 
The Veterans Administration has announced
that its offices at Stanford and other Bay Area
colleges will be closed this fall. A curtailment
in the VA budget has made it mandatory that
a reduction in personnel be made.
Veteran students at Stanford will notice the
difference if their subsisience checks fail to
arrive on time. Instead of notifying the VA
representative in the Administration Building
they will now have to contact the office in
San Francisco or a branch office in San Jose.
It will mean a delay in the entire process.
George Barahal, Director of the Veterans Guid
ance Center, a university-operated offire, ad
vises veterans not to depend on their sub
sistence checks arriving on time.
Stanford, anticipating the curtailment of
many Veterans Administration functions, has
increased its staff in order to serve the needs
of the students studying under the GI bill.
However after the first forms are completed the
university's job ends. The Guidance Center
and the Records Office are entirely separate
from the Veterans Administration.
Disabled veterans studying under Public
Law 16, however, will be able to straighten out
their subsistence problems with a VA repre
sentative who will be on the campus at regular
intervals.
Barahal advises all veterans to keep a file
of all correspondence with the VA in order

that all difficulties may be rapidly straightened
out in one visit with a VA official.
Hardest hit by the departure of the VA office
from the Stanford campus will be those vet
erans who fill out their forms incorrectly or
who fail to keep the VA notified of their cor
rect address.
The university will expedite the handling
of the preliminary forms. If these forms are
properly prepared by the student he may an
ticipate little if any delay in the arrival of his
monthly check.
