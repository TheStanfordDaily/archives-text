# Football Send-Off Today
## 
### 
A story announcing a send-off celebration
this afternoon for the Stanford football team
appears on page one.
Coach Marchie Schwartz' boys are heading
east where they will meet the team generally
conceded to be number two in the nation.
The football team will not only be represent
ing the university in the game with Michigan
but also the entire Pacific Coast Conference.
The Stanford student body cannot possibly
travel east en masse with the team but it can
show the team that it is behind it one hundred
per cent by making the send-off today some
thing the team will remember when they take
the field against the Wolverines Saturday.
