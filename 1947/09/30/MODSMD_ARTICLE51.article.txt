# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
For those of us who hail from rainy southern
California, Los Angeles and vicinity, that wearisome
trip back to the Farm after a short interlude of peace
got a novel sendoff from a cement-mixing gentleman
in Hollywood—Slim Gailard and his "puttee-put
tee" trio.
Operating in Hollywood's Swanee Inn, a dark dive
for jazz addicts, Slim and his boys concocted a
roaring new ditty entitled "the road to Palo Alto"
which they spiced with frequent howls of "Stan
riba, riba-ford" and "Hope and L'amour also travel
that road."
With that bit of information under our wing,
the trip back passed quick and before you could
say "hi '51" we were back on campus and caught in a
stream of humanity trailing by Encina on the way
down to the stadium for the first football game of
the year. It was also the first time we had passed
that close to the good old without some
lonely bombardier trying his art with waterbags.
The game—well, 'nough said, —only reminded us
of an old story that was being told when we were
jammin' hotrods around high school before the war.
Seems that this little Indian boy, going to school up
in the deep north, was late for school one day, and
his teacher asked him how come.
"It was like this," the Indian boy replied, "the

ice on the roads was so slippery that every time I
took a step forward towards school I slid back two
steps!"
"Then how did you ever manage to get to school
at all," the teacher wanted to know.
"Well, teacher," came the reply, "I just turned
around and went home!"
Which might have been one way some of our
Indians could have got where they were going last
Saturday.
But our old rooting section was up to par for the
first game, including a rabid Cal fan who sat in the
ccnter of the Red and White waving his little Blue
flag and otherwise sabotaging the pom-pom efforts.
After several vile curses didn't stop his unfriendly
activities, and Senator Rankin declined the oppor
tunity to brand him un-American, our own Gus
Chavalas, of basketball fame, lead an armored
assault against the traitor.
With the Cal banner no longer waving in our
midst, and the shadows across the fields getting
longer and longer like the faces on the Indian rooters,
the quarter's first Saturday afternoon came to a
close. As the firefly hollered when someone stepped
on its tail:
"De-lighted—no end!"

Chavalas, of basketball fame, lead an armored
assault against the traitor.
With the Cal banner no longer waving in our
midst, and the shadows across the fields getting
longer and longer like the faces on the Indian rooters,
the quarter's first Saturday afternoon came to a
close. As the firefly hollered when someone stepped
on its tail:
"De-lighted—no end!"
For those of us who hail from rainy southern
California, Los Angeles and vicinity, that wearisome
trip back to the Farm after a short interlude of peace
got a novel sendoff from a cement-mixing gentleman
in Hollywood—Slim Gailard and his "puttee-put
tee" trio.
Operating in Hollywood's Swanee Inn, a dark dive
for jazz addicts, Slim and his boys concocted a
roaring new ditty entitled "the road to Palo Alto"
which they spiced with frequent howls of "Stan
riba, riba-ford" and "Hope and L'amour also travel
that road."
With that bit of information under our wing,
the trip back passed quick and before you could
say "hi '51" we were back on campus and caught in a
stream of humanity trailing by Encina on the way
down to the stadium for the first football game of
the year. It was also the first time we had passed
that close to the good old without some
lonely bombardier trying his art with waterbags.
The game—well, 'nough said, —only reminded us
of an old story that was being told when we were
jammin' hotrods around high school before the war.
Seems that this little Indian boy, going to school up
in the deep north, was late for school one day, and
his teacher asked him how come.
"It was like this," the Indian boy replied, "the

ice on the roads was so slippery that every time I
took a step forward towards school I slid back two
steps!"
"Then how did you ever manage to get to school
at all," the teacher wanted to know.
"Well, teacher," came the reply, "I just turned
around and went home!"
Which might have been one way some of our
Indians could have got where they were going last
Saturday.
But our old rooting section was up to par for the
first game, including a rabid Cal fan who sat in the
ccnter of the Red and White waving his little Blue
flag and otherwise sabotaging the pom-pom efforts.
After several vile curses didn't stop his unfriendly
activities, and Senator Rankin declined the oppor
tunity to brand him un-American, our own Gus
Chavalas, of basketball fame, lead an armored
assault against the traitor.
