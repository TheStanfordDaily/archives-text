### CECIL ROSPAW 
Universal Military Training (U.M.T.) is one of the
larger problems facing prospective educators, lead
ers of industry, parents, citizens of this country, and
Stanford, today.
Many noted political leaders, Army men, Le
gion professionals, including the usually taciturn
(on political problems at least) Thomas Dewey, have
taken strong stands in favor of this measure.
U.M.T. is a plan, which, if adopted by Congress,
would require the drafting of every able bodied male
between 18 and 21 lor a period of military training
(from (i months to a year and a half depending on
Congress) to be conducted by the Army or Navy.
Purpose of U.M.T. is to have a well trained and
disciplined civilian army, able to go to arms in time
of need with a minimum of confusion and a maximum
of efficiency.
If enacted U.M.T. will be the first peace-time
draft in the history of this country, and will also pro
vide us with our first attempt to prepare for some
thing before it occurs.
There are political implications. The Army has
already made great strides towards consolidating its
war-time position of authority in deciding the inter
national policy of this country. U.M.T. might be but
another weapon in the hands of a group never too
objective Crenerals, trained lor war, and believing
in war as the only, ultimate, solution to any problem.
I* ot those interested in the welfare of the citizenry
of this nation as a whole there is an encouraging side
of the question. It was amazing, and painful, to dis
cover, by checking the Army records, the number of
illiterates there are in this country.
A peace-time draft which supersedes any state
law. might be a solution.
I lie Army, forced to train men/to read and write
due to the strains of modern mechanical warfare, did
a commendable job in educational training.
Battalions for illiterates turned out men who had
picked up many of the rudiments of a primary and
secondary education in a surprisingly fast time.
By favoring U.M.T. on this basis then, it would
mean that many people, exemplified by those here
at Stanfoid, who would receive the education any
way, would be sacrificing time and age to insure a

Reneral raising and leveling of the entire body
politic.
Although the Army is seldom called a tool of
democracy, it might become just that under such a
plan. Young, future citizens of every race and
nationality would be thrown together in a rigid at
mosphere which forces each man to look to his
neighbor for support once in awhile.
The Army plan, recently conducted at Fort Knox,
Ky., received much favorable publicity as to its
"new democracy" and attempts to humanize and
break down old training principles and make them
more acceptable to modern American youth.
An experiment to give the Army ideas as to what
to do if faced with the problem of training the youth
of the nation, this experimental battalion was con
ducted with picked youths from all over the country.
Granted that one year is a large period of time
to be taken from 18 year old youngsters, and granted
that in any large organization such as the Army much
time is seemingly wasted, there is also much to be
gained.
It has never hurt any man to learn how to take
care of himself physically, live on a rigid salary, to
know weapons and their use. These things are always
of value.
The main worry would be, or should be, what sort
of political indoctrination, or orientation, will be
given these young, susceptible minds under such a
scheme. Will a group of experts, picked for their
objectivity be allowed to present world and national
conditions as they happen, or will the old Army
group prevail and events be presented as certain
people would like to think they happened?
The world situation has been purposely left out
of this discussion up till now. U.M.T. is a problem
that should be decided on its merits alone. But the
world situation is tenuous. One can never be sure
whether another Munich is around the corner, or
whether Mr. Hearst has more supporters than once
supposed possible.
The Boy Scouts teach that we should always "Be
Prepared," but then Mr. Davy Crockett, a boyhood
hero, had a favorite motto that went: "Be sure
you're right—then go ahead."

more acceptable to modern American youth.
An experiment to give the Army ideas as to what
to do if faced with the problem of training the youth
of the nation, this experimental battalion was con

Granted that one year is a large period of time
to be taken from 18 year old youngsters, and granted
that in any large organization such as the Army much
time is seemingly wasted, there is also much to be
gained.
It has never hurt any man to learn how to take
care of himself physically, live on a rigid salary, to
know weapons and their use. These things are always
of value.
The main worry would be, or should be, what sort
of political indoctrination, or orientation, will be
given these young, susceptible minds under such a
scheme. Will a group of experts, picked for their
objectivity be allowed to present world and national
conditions as they happen, or will the old Army
group prevail and events be presented as certain
people would like to think they happened?
The world situation has been purposely left out
of this discussion up till now. U.M.T. is a problem
that should be decided on its merits alone. But the
world situation is tenuous. One can never be sure
whether another Munich is around the corner, or
whether Mr. Hearst has more supporters than once
supposed possible.

Universal Military Training (U.M.T.) is one of the
larger problems facing prospective educators, lead
ers of industry, parents, citizens of this country, and
Stanford, today.
Many noted political leaders, Army men, Le
gion professionals, including the usually taciturn
(on political problems at least) Thomas Dewey, have
taken strong stands in favor of this measure.
U.M.T. is a plan, which, if adopted by Congress,
would require the drafting of every able bodied male
between 18 and 21 lor a period of military training
(from (i months to a year and a half depending on
Congress) to be conducted by the Army or Navy.
Purpose of U.M.T. is to have a well trained and
disciplined civilian army, able to go to arms in time
of need with a minimum of confusion and a maximum
of efficiency.
If enacted U.M.T. will be the first peace-time
draft in the history of this country, and will also pro
vide us with our first attempt to prepare for some
thing before it occurs.
There are political implications. The Army has
already made great strides towards consolidating its
war-time position of authority in deciding the inter
national policy of this country. U.M.T. might be but
another weapon in the hands of a group never too
objective Crenerals, trained lor war, and believing
in war as the only, ultimate, solution to any problem.
I* ot those interested in the welfare of the citizenry
of this nation as a whole there is an encouraging side
of the question. It was amazing, and painful, to dis
cover, by checking the Army records, the number of
illiterates there are in this country.
A peace-time draft which supersedes any state
law. might be a solution.
I lie Army, forced to train men/to read and write
due to the strains of modern mechanical warfare, did
a commendable job in educational training.
Battalions for illiterates turned out men who had
picked up many of the rudiments of a primary and
secondary education in a surprisingly fast time.
By favoring U.M.T. on this basis then, it would
mean that many people, exemplified by those here
at Stanfoid, who would receive the education any
way, would be sacrificing time and age to insure a

Reneral raising and leveling of the entire body
politic.
Although the Army is seldom called a tool of
democracy, it might become just that under such a
plan. Young, future citizens of every race and
nationality would be thrown together in a rigid at
mosphere which forces each man to look to his
neighbor for support once in awhile.
