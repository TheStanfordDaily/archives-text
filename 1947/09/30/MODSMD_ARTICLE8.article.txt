Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolver
ines, in their season opener last
Saturday, trounced Michigan State,
55 to 0.
It was Bob Chappuis, a 184-pound
halfback, who ran and passed the
Spartans into submission. When
Chappuis wasn't operating, the
Spartans had trouble from fullbacks
Jack Weisenburger and Dick
Kempthorn, end Lenny Ford, and
halfback Bump Elliott.
The Crisler Machine scored six
minutes after the opening whistle
when Elliott scampered 56 yards for
a first down on the Spartan 13.
Chappuis went over from the one
foot line eight plays later.
Chappuis accounted for three
TD's, while Weisenburger, Kemp
thorn, Ford, Elliott, and center Dan
Dworsky collected one each.
Michigan amassed 504 yards by
rushing and passing. The Staters
could net only 54 yards from scrim
mage, lost out on first downs, Hi to
5, and failed to complete a pass in
eight tries.
Jim Brieske booted seven out of
eight points after touchdown.
