# Stanford, Cal Become Pals
## 
### 
California and Stanford, tradi
tional rivals on the athletic field,
joined forces this summer when
mountain climbers from the two
schools teamed up for an assault on
one of nature's last strongholdsâ€”
the Waddington Mountains in
northern British Columbia.
In making 12 first ascents in the
almost impenetrable glacial area,
the alpiners required the use of air
planes to drop food and other
equipment too heavy to pack on
their backs. The California and
Stanford climbers were beaten on
about 20 climbs by Harvard moun
taineers who arrived at the area
several days earlier.
Stanford and California climbers
aided in the fruitless attempt to re
move the body of Bob Shiverick,
Harvard, who was killed in a climb
ing mishap. Shiverick was buried
in the mountains whei'e he died, ef
forts by helicopters, mounted police,
and some of the best ice climbers
on the continent being unsuccessful
in the rugged terrain. The Harvard
group named a mountain after their
dead comrade.
Members of the Stanford Alpine
Club on the expedition were Ulf
Ramm-Ericson and Fritz Lippmann,
Alpha Sigma Phi; and Bud Gates,
Delta Kappa Epsilon. California
members were Fletcher Hoyt, Robin
Hansen, Oscar Cook, and Richard
Houston.
The Waddington Mountains are
about 200 miles from Vancouver by
air. By automobile it, is necessary
to drive 500 miles to Lake Tatla,
then hike overland for 40 miles.
