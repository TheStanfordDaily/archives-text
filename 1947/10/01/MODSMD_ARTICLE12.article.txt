UN HALL, FLUSHING, N.Y.,
Sept. 30 (UP). —An American at
tempt to purge the United Nations
Security Council of all Russian
sympathizers today threw the UN
General Assembly into a voting
deadlock and further inflamed So
viet-American relations.
The two Assembly giants tangled
over the election of a country to
succeed pro-Soviet Poland on the
powerful Security Council.
Russia wanted the Ukraine. The
United States backed India. After
seven ballots, enither side was able
to pile up the two-thirds majority
required for election, and further
balloting was postponed. On the
seventh vote, the Ukraine led, 33
to 23.
CUSTOMARILY EASTERN
UN custom called for Poland to
be succeeded by another Eastern
European nation. Some members of
the American delegation strongly
urged that the United States vote
for the Ukraine in order to maintain
the present geographical distribu
tion on the 11-nation Council.
But Secretary of State George C.
Marshall, deciding in the midst of
the voting, ordered the American

delegation to ignore custom and
support India.
Marshall then left for the World
Series baseball opener, leaving
Warren Austin, permanent Ameri
can delegate to UN, to cast the U.S.
ballots. Austin failed to swing the
deal.
VIOLATES CHARTER
Russia protested that elimination
of Slavic states from the Security
Council would violate the UN char
ter. UN officials, who have hoped
to smooth over the Soviet-American
differences, commented privately
that the American move to strip
Russia of all support in the Secu
rity Council might have most seri
ous results.
Of all the Security Council mem
bers, only Poland has voted with
Russia. The Soviet expected Po
land to be succeeded by a nation
equally sympathetic.
The Ukraine led India in the vot
ing right from the start, emerging
on the fourth ballot with a 30 to 25
margin.
