# New Power Project Set
## 
### 
Work has been proceeding for
more than a month on the Farm's
$150,000 program of modernizing
and placing underground its over
loaded electrical distribution sys
tem, according to Corporation Yard
officials.
Scheduled for construction are a
new power substation and an un
derground distribution circuit that
can service the present University
plant and any future expansion.
Critically outmoded, the present
system was installed during the
University's early days and en
larged piecemeal as the school ex
panded. Overloading made mod
ernization imperative.
Majority of the work to date has
been done along Lomita Drive
whore distribution ducts have been
built and manholes installed.
The construction, begun the lat
ter part of August, will not be com
pleted until September, 1949.
The project, under the supervi
sion of Carroll L. Blacker, superin
tendent of buildings and grounds,
includes plans for a substation to
be placed on Panama street. The
equipment, to be of a metal-clad
outdoor type not requiring a roof,
will be concealed behind an orna
mental fence.
The electrical system moderniza
tion is a phase of the University's
long-range planning program under
the direction of Eldridgc T. Spencer,
director of planning.
