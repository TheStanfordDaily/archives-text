nounced last night, shattering last year's record figure of 7,281.

A break-down of figures listet
6,063 men registrants in comparison
to a total of 1,937 women, placing
the ratio at 3.2.
FORESEE RECORD
Explanation of the increase, hiyh
er than anticipated by the Reei
trar's office, was due to "more nM
students returning to campu: than
had been expected," Winbigler mrl
"More students have returned
from those who attended both
spring and summer quarters," Win
bigler explained. "Most of them
had indicated they did not plan to
register this quarter."
The record total of yesterday w r,
expected to be broken again today
through Friday when late regis
trants appear on campus.
Despite minor protests at the
manner in which the registration
procedure was carried out, Univn
sity officials believed "il was one
of the best-conducted registration:.;
yet."
Lines leading into the Adminis
tration Building decreased percep -
tibly late yesterday afternoon and
registration officials expressed Ihe
hope that their main worries were
over.
FROSH NUMEROUS
Considerable difficulty was noted
by officials with reference to the
slowness with which the newer stu
dents passed through the lines. The
Class of '51, numbering more than
1,000, proved quite a nemesis to
early registrants on Monday.
Upper division students were im
ported in line as early as 7 a.m. in
qrder to obtain scarce seat cards for
"crowded frosh courses."

day's registration as compared with
