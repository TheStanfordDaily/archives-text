i i.all l oiLi -n Relations committee
for Nov. 10 to consider the Presi

ol emergency winter relief for west
ern Europe, chiefly France and Italy.
Chairman Styles Bridges, R., N.H.,

A similar call is expected shortly

P< i onal investigation of economic
conditions.
Mr. Truman told those and other
congressional leaders at a special
White House parley yesterday that
r xtcutive funds can hold off' starva

But beyond that deadline, he said,
only congressional help can save
them from an economic collapse
that almost certainly would push
them into the communist orbit.
PLAN USELESS
He warned them that if that hap
pens, it would be useless to go
through with the $20,000,000,000
Marshall long-range plan by which
his country hopes to help the na
tions of western Europe back to
economic stability.
Vandenberg and Eaton were cau
-1 iously sympathetic to the Presi
dent's proposals, but they refused
to committ themselves to meeting
his Dec. 1 deadline.
Vandenberg said "essential" re
ports from the State Department and
other agencies, including congress
ional committees now in Europe,
would not be available before Nov. 1.
"Legislation is impossible until
these studies are adequately con
cluded," he said. "Congress and the
country require total facts."

A similar call is expected shortly

conditions.
Mr. Truman told those and other
congressional leaders at a special
White House parley yesterday that
r xtcutive funds can hold off' starva
-lion in France and Italy until Dec. 1.
But beyond that deadline, he said,
only congressional help can save
them from an economic collapse
that almost certainly would push
them into the communist orbit.
PLAN USELESS
He warned them that if that hap
pens, it would be useless to go
through with the $20,000,000,000
Marshall long-range plan by which
his country hopes to help the na

economic stability.
Vandenberg and Eaton were cau
-1 iously sympathetic to the Presi
dent's proposals, but they refused
to committ themselves to meeting
his Dec. 1 deadline.
Vandenberg said "essential" re
ports from the State Department and
other agencies, including congress
ional committees now in Europe,
would not be available before Nov. 1.
"Legislation is impossible until
these studies are adequately con
cluded," he said. "Congress and the
country require total facts."
