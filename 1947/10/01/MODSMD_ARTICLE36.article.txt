BOSTON, Sefct. 30 (UP).—Former
Vice-President Henry A. Wallace,
in a stinging criticism of American
foreign policy, charged tonight that
"every propaganda technique known
to man is being used to win support
for basically rotten policies."
In a speech at Boston Arena he
said: "It is quite obviously not offi
cial concern with civil liberties that
troubles the men who direct our
foreign policy—even if that is the
banner under which they would
mobilize us.
RESTRICTS LIBERTIES
"Is it the restriction of civil lib
erties within the Soviet Union that
concerns the men who are direct
ing American foreign policy? I
think not . . . we embrace Peron.
We arm other Latin American dic
tators . . . we let American-made
arms suppress Indonesians without
threatening the Dutch government."
Wallace said the peoples of Eu
rope and Asia were "not fooled" by
the United States.
"They know our interest in
Greece and the Middle East is an
interest in oil, not principles," he
said.
VOTING RIGHTS
He suggested "the administration
give evidence to the world that we
are as concerned with Americans
being deprived of the right of a
ballot as we are about the voting
rights of peoples of Eastern Europe
by sending a commission to super
vise the election of a successor to
Theodore Bilbo in Mississippi.
Wallace called for "organized
strength" to take "control of the
country from Wall Street ... If we
organize rapidly and well," he said,
"we can force the present adminis
tration to fight for the controls and
rationing necessary to distribute
current scarcity and enable all
Americans to eat well.
