### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (UP).—
The National Labor Relations Board
today upheld the exclusion of fore
; men from collective bargaining
I rights in its first decision under the
new Taft-Hartley Law.
The ruling was handed down as
President Truman formally accept
i r>d the resignation of Philip Hannah,
Cincinnati, as Assistant Secretary
|of Labor and appointed John T.
Kmetz, Nanticoke, Pa., one - time
i coal miner and a former United
Mine Workers official, to succeed
| him.
FIGHTS ACT
Hannah quit to devote his full
time to fighting the Taft-Hartley
"anti - labor and undemocratic"
kveapon that "strikes at the heart of
free men and institutions."
The foremen's case involved 150
supervisory employees ot the East
Springfield, Mass., plant of the Wes
tinghouse Electric Corp., who are
represented by the Foremen's Asso
ciation of America (Ind.). They had
filed an NLRB complaint accusing
the company of refusing to bargain
collectively.
DISMISSES COMPLAINT
The board announced that it was
dismissing the complaint, without
considering its merits, since the
Taft-Hartley Act relieves employ
ers of any obligation to bargain col
lectively with supervisory workers.
It said the Wagner Act's "employ
ee" definition had been amended to
exclude "any individual employed
as a supervisor" and that such
workers now are "outside the cov
erage of the National Labor Rela
tions Act."
It was the second setback suffered
by the foremen's union in as many
days.
