# N.Y. Edges Bums, 5-3, In Opener
## 
### 
Looking much like the Bronx
Bombers of old, the New York Yank
ees blasted Brooklyn's K;dph Branca,
and his successor, Hank Behrman, for
live runs in a big fifth inning to de
feat the Dodgers 5 to 3, before the
largest crowd, 73,000, ever to wit
ness a World Series game.
Leading by a slim 1 to 0 score up
to the fifth, 21-year-old Branca
had handcuffed the Yanks with a
beautiful display of pitching. For
four frames he retired the New York
batters in older.
Then the roof fell in.
Joe DiMaggio, leading off in the
filth, beat out a slow roller to deep
.shortstop. George McQuinn walked
on four pitched balls. Bill Johnson
was hit by a Branca curve, filling
Ihe bases.
BRANCA MAKES MISTAKE
The youthful Dodger hurler then
made the mistake of feeding dan
gerous Johnny Lindell an inside
pitch, and Lindell slammed it for
two bases. Two runs crossed the
plate, and the rally was on.
Branca reloaded the bases by
walking Phil Rizzuto, and then
pitched two balls to ex-Stanfordite
Bobby Brown, who had been sent
in to bat for rookie Yankee pitcher
Frank Shea.
With the two and nothing count
on Brown, Manager Burt Shotton
yanked Branca and put Hank Behr
man on the mound. Behrman threw
two more balls to Brown, and a run
was forced in.
SnulTy Stirnweiss forced Lindell
at home, but that was only a mo
mentary respite for the Bums, as
Tommy Henrich singled to left to
score Rizzuto and Brown â€”the
fourth and fifth New York runs.
The score then stood at five to one.
MARGIN OF VICTORY
It was Henrich's single that pro
vided the margin of victory as Dem
Bums added a run in both the sixth
and seventh innings to bring the
count to 5 to 3, the final score.
It was Dodger speed and daring on
the basepaths that gained the three
runs with Jackie Robinson and Pete
Reiser as the stars.
Robinson was walked by Shea in
the first inning and then stole sec
ond. While he was being trapped
off base, Pete Reiser romped all the
way to second on a fielder's choice.
Reiser scored on Walker's single.
Again, in the sixth, Robinson de
lighted the fans by tallying the sec
ond marker for the Flatbush gang
when he came in from second on
Carl Furillo's single off relief-pitch
er Joe Page, who had replaced Shea.
Reiser scored Brooklyn's third and
final run in the seventh.
Harris has announced that Allie
Reynolds, obtained from the Cleve
land Indians a year ago, would be
the starter today. Burt Shotton of
the Dodgers again refused to name
his starter for the second game, but
Vic Lombardi was expected to re
ceive the nod.
