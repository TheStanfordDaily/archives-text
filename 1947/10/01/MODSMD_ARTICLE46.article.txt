"I consider it the duty of every
freshman with track experience to
turn out now so that we can begin
to mold and develop next spring's
track team." So spoke track coach
Jack Weiershauser yesterday.
"Now," he emphasized, "is the
time to get started. It is too late to
experiment next spring. We have
lost every Pacific Coast Conference
meet in the past two years. If we
can get started early enough, and
get a few breaks, it will be a different
story this year."
He added that most of the former
high school track men came to school
with the "Am I good enough?" at
titude. "This is not right," he said.
"1 want to meet each and every
man personally. Between us we can
work something out."
He added that track and field
teams depend, perhaps more than
any other athletic event, on frosh
development. "If we can get field
men out now, if we can show them
the fundamentals of the high jump,
pole vault, shot put and other events,
we can do well this year."
Stanford has lost two men from
last year's squad. Frank Ganahl,
star long distance man, was killed
in an automobile accident this sum
mer; and captain Al Snyder grad
uated. However, there will be a
large number of frosh and sopho
more holdovers.
