# New Outfits Issued To Traveling Squad
## 
### 
If, as the old adage goes, a new
suit of clothes can give a person a
new and brighter lease on life, then
Stanford's east - hound football
squad should be bubbling over
with merriment—in spite of any
lingering, sad memories of the
Idaho tragedy.
Each player on the traveling,
list was presented with a brand
new outfit yesterday morning—a
pair of white trousers (nylons for
the backs and ends), a cardinal
jersey with white numerals, and
a handsome cardinal traveling
jacket with a white "Stanford"
on the chest.
Even the fancy clothes, however,
probably won't lend much exuber
ance to the Indian excursion. The
players know they are running
up against a great Michigan team,
and that their chances of victory
are slim.
