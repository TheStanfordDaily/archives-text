### 
Executivi sr known as Ex
com, is the )f the Associated
Students o sity. Guided by
the student body president and vice-president
this Committee controls all organized student
body activities.
Since it is a legislative body Excom should
represent the views of every student body
member on campus. In an effort to make the
Committee more representative Excom repre
sentation was changed from a class to a living
group basis in spring '45 by an overwhelming
referendum vote.
Class representation had become inade
quate for a closely integrated campus like
Stanford, where communication and discuss
ion of Excom policies and plans lay more nat
urally with the living group.
Since that time Excom has included 12
members, representing all living areas, and
five ex-officio members. These members com
municate with house presidents in their area
for an exchange of prevailing group opinion
and information on issues before Excom.
No system is perfect however, and the living
group with an Excom member naturally gets
a more complete picture of the proceeding
than others in that area. Unofficially many
dorms and houses have sent a person to Ex
com each week to report firsthand. By rotating

this duty a number of people get an inside
picture of student government.
The important thing is that anyone, from
freshman on up, is welcome to attend these
meetings. You may present your own opinion,
and see just what your representative is ac
complishing for you.—M.H.
