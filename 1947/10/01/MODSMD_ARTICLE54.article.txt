# A 						Good Pre-Reg
## 
### 
To the freshman arriving at Stanford last
Friday, the welcoming hand extended by the
pre-reg committee was invaluable. The assem
bly, exchange dinners, jolly-up, and barbecue
helped the frosh feel a part of the Stanford
Family from their first day on campus.
Not only were the new students entertained
with social affairs, but, with the help of the
sponsors, they became acquainted almost im
mediately with the traditions and spirit of
Stanford. This type of orientation is necessary
to help the frosh get over that "lost feeling"
and to create interested, active student leaders
out of the class of '51.
The pre-reg committee, headed by Gail
Shinstrom and Tom Williamson, did an ex
cellent job of organizing pre-reg activities.
More than that, however, they showed the
freshmen that the rest of the student body is
anxious to make the "lowly Frosh" feel at
home on the Farm.—M.S.
