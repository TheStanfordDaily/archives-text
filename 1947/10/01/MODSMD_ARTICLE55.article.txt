### GEORGE BRUNN 
In a little-noticed two paragraph story the papers
recently reported the resignation of one James S.
Martin who had the imposing title of chief of the
decartelization division of the American Military
Government in Germany.
That forbidding fifty-cent word "decartelization"
means roughly trust-busting. It was Martin's job
to break up such industrial giants as I. G. Farben and
Krupp—concerns that (with British and American
assistance) first financed Hitler's rise to power and
then built his war machine.
The resignation is not very important but the
reason for it is: Martin, a top-notch lawyer and an
extremely capable official who worked for years in
the anti-trust division of the Justice Department,
said he quit because of the heavy pressure brought
on him by large American concerns to "go easy" on
German business. He named Standard Oil, General
Electric, General Motors and a few others.
This is the most shocking news to come out of

Germany since the discovery of the extermination
camps. Shocking because it shows that our states
men have learned little, if anything, from the war.
Shocking because if Big Business is revived we will
find ourselves back where we were in 1939 but with
no chance to get off so lightly.
Combine this with our new policy of re-building
German industry and with other recent reports that
our half-hearted process of weeding out Nazis has
left thousands of them in influential positions.
Also re-education is failing and Nazi sentiments are
as strong as ever.
What does it add up to? It means that the State
Department, run by generals and investment bank
ers, is building a strong, un-democratic, monopolistic
Germany, presumably as a buffer against Russia. We
tried that once before and the world has still not
recovered. Maybe the next time we can succeed in
finishing it off for good.
