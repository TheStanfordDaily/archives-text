# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
(All campus opinion letters should be addressed to the
editor, signed by the writer, and contain the address and
phone number ol the writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable that they be short and to the point.)
To the Editor:
After having established an International Cor
respondence Bureau, I. on behalf of members on my
waiting list, take leave to apply to you. May I
request you to put me in touch with readers of your
paper interested in friendly correspondence.
Having been secluded from the outside world these
long years, and yearning for a real democratic en
lightenment and a personal contact from man to man
across borders, my members would only too gladly
welcome and answer letters from abroad. Most of my
members (among them scientists, students, experts,
businessmen and other well-educated ladies and
gentlemen, and also hobbyists, housewives and even
young boys and girls) have a fairly good knowledge

of English, but would also be pleased to write in
German, if desired. I am sure my members will try
and give their pen-friends every satisfaction.
Individuals and groups of persons may communi
cate with me direct stating their particulars and
interests. All letters will be attended to and all appli
cations linked up. If possible, two or three reply cou
pons should be enclosed to cover expenses, and also—
to save time —an introductory letter to future pen
friends over here will be appreciated.
Pen-friendships are a step towards the creation
of that international friendship and goodwill that is
so essential to understanding and peace, don't you
think so?
Yours hopefully,
(Miss) Anna-Maria Braun
