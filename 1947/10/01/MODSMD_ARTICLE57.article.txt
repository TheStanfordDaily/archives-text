# Geography Department Announces New Posts
## 
### 
A new teaching staff in geography
is one of the features of Stanford's
School of Humanities this autumn.
Heading up the group is Dr. George
T. Renner of Columbia University,
who will serve as Visiting Profes
sor of Geography at Stanford during
1947-48. With him is Mr. John L.
Taylor, formerly of the University
of Nebraska faculty, and more re
cently an instructor in the School of
Naval Administration at Stanford;
and Mr. William C. Steele, who
comes here from the geography staff
of the University of Kentucky.
Of the new group, Mr. Steele is the
economic geographer and meteorolo
gist; Dr. Renner handles the cultural j
geography and geopolitics; and Mr.
Taylor is the specialist in regional
studies, with emphasis on Far East- j
ern affairs.
Professor Renner is author or co- i

author of some fourteen books in
his field, and is well known to the
American public because of his
many feature articles in Colliers,
the Saturday Evening Post, and the
American Magazine. He is perhaps
best known for his North-Pole cen
tered "World Map for the Air Age"
published by Rand McNally & Co.
soon after the outbreak of the recent
war. Copies of this strange new map
hung in the office of nearly every
United States military, naval and
I diplomatic leader during the war.
