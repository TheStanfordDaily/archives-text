# Prices Hit New Level

### 
CHICAGO, Sept. 30 (UP).—Wheat
and livestock prices jumped to rec
ord levels today and $3 per bushel
wheat loomed as a strong possi
bility in the next two or three days.
With wholesale prices still spiral
ing upward, and retail prices in
creasing in many areas, an admini
stration leader predicted that food
prices could be brought down and
more food provided for hungry na
tions by means of food conservation
program in the United States.
All wheat futures on the Chicago
Board of Trade hit new all-time
highs, but they dropped consider
ably in late trading.
HIGHEST PRICES
December wheat sold for $2.9114
cents a bushel, and July for $2.67,
the highest prices on record for
wheat for delivery in those months.
The rise in livestock prices at
Chicago's Union Stockyards was not
as spectacular as the grain increase,
but a new 1947 high of $36 a hun
dredweight was paid for two 1,200-
pound steers, 10 cents higher than
yesterday's top.
On the Chicago Board of Trade,
corn and oats rose slightly and soy
beans jumped the eight-cent trad
ing limit.
VOLUNTARY RATIONING
The administration leader who
commented on the wasteless food
program said it would reduce prices
at home if people could be convinced
that meat should be passed up two
days a week and that they should
shop for cheaper cuts.
