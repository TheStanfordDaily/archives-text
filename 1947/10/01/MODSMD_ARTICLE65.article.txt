# Frosh Finally Get Break; New Class Book Soon
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
For the third time in Quad his
tory, Stanford freshmen will be
getting "the break of their young
lives."
Such was the revelation of Bill
McPherson, Quad editor, who yes
terday told of plans to revitalize a
feeling of security and class spirit
among freshmen, unknown since
1942.
A Class of '51 Book for Farm
frosh will be published in mid-No
vember containing photographs of
the class and miscellaneous infor
mation such as home town names
and campus residences.
"We're going to do things up
right," McPherson said. "Sure, you
can say the frosh are getting a
break, but they deserve one. We
need something to make all the
freshmen 'more at home'."
CLASS BOOK STARTED IN '42
First inaugurated in 1942, the
forthcoming Class Book will be an
added publication of the Stanford
Quad. If Class Book sales zoom be
yond an established point necessary
for success, the frosh publication
will then become an annual book,
McPherson said.

The following is the week's
schedule for freshmen having
their pictures taken for the Class
of '31 Class Book at the Quad
office:
Today—Encina second floor east
and west
Tomorrow — Encina third floor
east and west
Friday—Encina fourth floor east
and west
Men are requested to wear
white shirts, coats, and ties.
Men from the Encina basement,
center (hull pen), and first floor
east and west who have not yet
had their pictures taken are asked
to conic to the Quad office as soon
as possible.

"We've hired the best photogra
work," McPherson boasted. "Our
biggest job right now is to have
every freshman aware of a Class
Book. We'd certainly like to see it
become a 'best seller'."
CLASS BOOK SALES BOOM
Class Book sales skyrocketed yes
terday above the 75 mark and indi
cations were that more than 80 per
cent of the Farm freshmen would
purchase a book.
The books will sell for one dollar.
A limited number of books is being
published, McPherson added, and
those remaining after inid-Novem
ber will go on sale to the general
public.
The Quad offices, sporting a new
interior paint job, are being fre
quented these days by frosh, patient
photographers, and a brand of eager
workers assigned to the Quad man
agement.
