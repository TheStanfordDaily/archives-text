### 
BOISE. Ida., Sept. 30 (UP).-Sen.
Robert A. Taft, R., 0., said today
there was "no foundation" to a ru
mor that he planned to form a coa
lition with Harold E. Stassen of
Minnesota to gain the Republican
Presidential and Vice - Presidential
nominations in a stop-Dewey move
ment.
Taft at the same time expressed
belief that some "ingenious person"
in the government could find suffi
cient money for stop-gap aid to Eu
rope without calling a special ses
sion of Congress now.
"I don't think we ought to have
a special session of Congress before
Dec. 1," Taft told a press conference
shortly after his arrival in Boise on
a stumping tour of the West.
"After Dec. 1, I'm open to a
change of opinion."
A newsman asked Taft about the
"rumor" that he might team up
with Stassen, an avowed GOP Pres
idential candidate, to derail the
Dewey campaign.
"There is no foundation to the
rumor," Taft said.
