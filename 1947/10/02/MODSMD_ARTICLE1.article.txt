# Finland, Italy Membership Barred by Russian Veto
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS HALL, Flushing, N.Y., Oct. (UP).—Russia j
tossed two more vetoes into the boiling East-West fight of the
United Nations tonight after accusing the Western Powers of a
deliberate campaign to undermine "international cooperation in
the UN."
The vetoes blocked Italy and Finland from United Nations member
ship this year.
The Soviet charge was hurled by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei
Vishinsky at the close of a gloomy session of the General Assembly at
which the United States stuck to its campaign to keep the Soviet Ukraine
off fire Security Council.
GROMYKO CASTS VETOES
In that council, at nearby Lake Success, Deputy Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko cast Russia's 21st and 22nd vetoes to bar Italy and Finland
from the UN in retaliation for the blackballing of Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria by the western powers.
Keeping his promise to use the much-disputed veto power if the
western countries refused to admit the three Soviet satellites of eastern
Europe, Gromyko thus threw faggots on the diplomatic bonfire which has
been started in this session of the United Nations general assembly by the
bitterly fought duel between the Soviet Union and the United States.
FUTURE UNCERTAIN
The vetoes climaxed a day which proved more than any other in the
tv/o-weeks old assembly session that the future of the UN is at stake.
Vi.shinsky's angry protest was handed to newspapermen after the
57-nation assembly quit, deadlocked for the second straight day in its
attempt to pick a successor to poland on the 11-nation Security Council.
Referring to the United States drive to elect India instead of the j
Ukraine and strip Russia of support on the council for the next two |
years, Vishingsky said "certain delegations were striking a plow at inter- j
national cooperation" and violating the UN charter.
Gromyko cast his now-t'amiliar "no" votes only after trying des
perately to approve the UN applications of all five of the former Nazi
satellite states.
After his vetoes, Gromyko emphasized that Russia had wanted to
support Italy and Finland as well as the three other states but was "vic
timized by an unsavory political game."

from the UN in retaliation for the blackballing of Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria by the western powers.
Keeping his promise to use the much-disputed veto power if the
western countries refused to admit the three Soviet satellites of eastern
Europe, Gromyko thus threw faggots on the diplomatic bonfire which has
been started in this session of the United Nations general assembly by the
bitterly fought duel between the Soviet Union and the United States.
FUTURE UNCERTAIN
The vetoes climaxed a day which proved more than any other in the
tv/o-weeks old assembly session that the future of the UN is at stake.
Vi.shinsky's angry protest was handed to newspapermen after the
57-nation assembly quit, deadlocked for the second straight day in its
attempt to pick a successor to poland on the 11-nation Security Council.
Referring to the United States drive to elect India instead of the j
Ukraine and strip Russia of support on the council for the next two |
years, Vishingsky said "certain delegations were striking a plow at inter- j
national cooperation" and violating the UN charter.
Gromyko cast his now-t'amiliar "no" votes only after trying des
perately to approve the UN applications of all five of the former Nazi
satellite states.
After his vetoes, Gromyko emphasized that Russia had wanted to
support Italy and Finland as well as the three other states but was "vic
timized by an unsavory political game."
