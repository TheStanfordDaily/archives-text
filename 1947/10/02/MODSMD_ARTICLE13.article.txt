# Hemlines Descend, Cuffs Creep Upward; Men, Beware! The Twain Is Almost Met
## 
### MARJORIE SAMPSON 
Despite the threats of some |
Stanford men not to date girls
who wear long skirts, hemlines
are going down. When Paris
calls, men are practically for
gotten.
And it seems to be the girls with
the pretty legs more than anyone
who are wearing the longer skirts.
But the "new look" includes more
than just long skirts. Paris also
demands sloping shoulders, wasp
waists, and full hips. '"Life" says
this new look lends an air of soft,
lady - like dressiness. There are
some who will disagree.
GOING DOWN
Men are hoping for the best, but
from all reports from Paris, skirts
will be getting longer and longer.
Coming into vogue with less ac
claim than the long skirts are dark
and tinted stockings. Dark stock
ings are a must for dressy affairs,
and some girls even go so far as to
match their stockings to their dress
es. But if the skirts get much long
er, it won't matter what color the
stockings are. No one will be able
to see them.
The men from Paso Robles seem
to have the situation under control:
the minute the women started
lengthening their skirts, the men
started growing beards. Result: the
women of Paso Robles arc now
wearing short skirts.
SKIRT SNIPPERS
Thfjre have also been rumors of
a group of long skirt-haters on cam
pus who have .been running around
with their scissors chopping off the
offending skirts — a rather drastic
sol ution.
Gibson Girl blouses are also being
seen around campus — some even I
have their fathers' college-day
stick-pins to wear with them.
But the men really have no cause |
to complain. Rumors from Paris
say that it will not be long before
the men will be wearing their trou
sers from two to four inches above j
the ankle. Although it is doubtful I
that Stanford men will fall in with |

the fashion right away, that well
known Stanford conservatism will
crop up when the style is estab
lished, and the men on campus will
have to start mending the holes in

their socks.
Men will gripe and grumble for
while, but it will do them no gooc
After all, it was a MAN who estab
lished the new fashion.
