# Palo Alto Traffic Tangles Averted With New Stop Signal Installation
## 
### 
The perennial battle on University
avenue between Palo Alto pedes
trians and motorists has been
brought to a stop with the installa
tion of eight new traffic signals on
the street's main intersections.
Previous to this innovation pedes
trians crossing streets had difficulty
in avoiding the rush of automobiles
that crowd the city's main thorough
fare. Traffic lights, however, are
expected to solve this problem be
sides relieving traffic congestion, ac
cording to C. G. Smith, head of the
Palo Alto Electrical Department.
Tests were completed yesterday in
which the lights were synchronized
to permit motorists to drive the en
tire length of the downtown section
with the green lights. Motorists
crossing intersections within the
first eighteen seconds of the green
light—a sixty second cycle—and
driving at 13'/j miles an hour will
meet a green light at each succeeding
intersection.
Lights will be set from 11:45 a.m.
to 12:45 p.m. and from 4:45 p.m. to
5:30 p.m. each day to favor cars
from Stanford and enable them to
be driven through the city more rap
idly than would normally be pos
sible.
