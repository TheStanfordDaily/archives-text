# Senior Offices Reorganized
## 
### 
Reorganization of Senior Exeom
will be carried into effect this year,
announced Bob Coate, class presi
dent. The change is being made, he
declared, in an attempt to get a
more representative Excom mem
bership and to bring each senior
closer to his class activities.
The new board, which will meet
for the first time next week under
President Coate, will include the
other class officers, Vice-President
Margy Power and Secretary Jean
Strong, and representatives from
the Village, men's and women's
dorms, and men's and women's
Row. Under these board members
will be assistants from each dorm
wing and each Row house.
Plans for the year will all aim to
ward the climax, Senior Week,
when the Excom will take charge
of Baccalaureate, graduation, and
the Senior Ball. In order to raise
money for these events, Excom will
revive the traditional senior ice
cream sale. Class members will
push an ice cream cart to each liv
ing group on campus once fall and
once winter quarter on dates to be
announced later.
All the traditional senior projects
will be carried out this year, Coate
promised, including the placing of
flowers on the Mausoleum, which is
always sponsored by the senior
class. However, additional social
activities will have to pay for them
selves, since all money is needed for
Senior Week activities.
