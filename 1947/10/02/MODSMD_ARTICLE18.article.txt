# Confusion Reigns As Classes Start
## 
### 
First days have always held
their quaint fascination and con
fusion. In kindergarten the young
neophyte must be separated from
Mama without the knowledge of
same. Later on, about college age,
the youngster must slip out of
Mama's hand without her know
ing it.
Stanford had its share of first
day experiences yesterday when
chubby - fisted lads and long
skirted lassies trucked notebooks
and pens to opening classes.
Finding rooms seemed to cause
the most confusion. Group one
intellectuals wondered and asked,
but didn't think of consulting
their time schedules.
Many students found classes
overflowing. Some eager business
law enrollees took in the first class
through the windows, standing
room already being taken inside
the room.
Topping off the day, Jeffrey
Smith, professor of humanities,
asked the women students to give
up their seats to their male co
horts as the men hold the major
ity on campus.
