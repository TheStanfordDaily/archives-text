# Voluntary Rationing Stressed By Truman for European Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (UP). â€”President Truman's Citizens'
Food Committee today appealed to Americans to help avert
a winter famine in western Europe and knock down food prices
at home by using less wheat, meat, poultry and eggs.
Committee Chairman Charles Luckman announced a five
point voluntary conservation drive by which, he said, the United States
hopes to be able to divert an extra 100,000,000 bushels of grain to the
hungry peoples of France, Italy and Austria during the coming months.
MARSHALL TO SPEAK
Secretary of State George C. Marshall and Luckman will speak to the
nation by radio Sunday night on the foreign relief emergency which led
to the conservation appeal.
In announcing the voluntary program, Luckman insisted, as President
Truman did earlier this week, that emphasis would be entirely on wasting
less, rather than eating less, food.
Underscoring the importance attached to this voluntary drive by the
administration, Mr. Truman and Marshall backed up Luckman's announce
ment with special statements calling for an all-out national effort on the
food front.
ONLY WAY
Secretary of Commerce W. Averell Harriman told the Luckman
committee that voluntary action is the only method available to meet the
food crisis.
Former Vice-President Henry A. Wallace, who broke with the Truman
administration over foreign policy, predicted failure for the voluntary
di ive and assei ted in his magazine, The New Republic, that food rationing
and price ceilings would be necessary.
Mr. Truman appeared confident that enthusiastic public cooperation
would put the program across. But behind his words was the implicit
suggestion that a return to food rationing, price controls and allocations
might be in store if it failed.
Confii mation that such last resort measures are under consideration
came from Dr. Edwin G. Nourse, chairman of the President's council of
economic advisers, who called at the White House to deliver his third
quarterly report.
