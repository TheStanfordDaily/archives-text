# Veterans' Center Promises Continued Service Despite Withdrawal of VA
## 
### STU FITCH 
The Stanford veteran may feel
that his last tie with efficiency is
being cut away with the curtail
ment of Veterans Administration
functions on campus, but on second
thought he realizes how fortunate
he has been and will continue to be.
Recently the VA announced dras
tic cuts in its budget, with there
• ult that offices at Stanford and oth
er Bay Area colleges have been
slated for disbandment. To many
this will mean a few anxious mo
ments over that late check, and a
call at the Veterans' Center a few
blocks away will have to be re
placed by a jaunt to the City.
STAFF INCREASED
But that is all. According to
George Barahal, veterans' co-ordi
natoi and director of the Guidance
Center, veterans will continue to
receive the same co-operation and
• ei vice under the University setup.
And to aid in making life easier
for the Farm veterans, Stanford has
added two former VA workers to
llk staff: Burns Young, former reg
istration officer, as the new assist
ant to the veterans' co-ordinator;
and Chester Neal, former training
ofiicer, as vocational counselor.
Stanford established the Veterans'
Center in the fall of 1945, with the
VA and the University working in
close harmony. The VA appointed
Gilbert Davis chief training officer,
aided by Young, Neal, and two
clerks, Mrs. Nancy Forbes and Mrs.
Louise Thursby, both wives of
Stanford veterans. Barahal was ap
point cd to his post by the Univer
sity.
VA HANDLES CHECKS
The main function of the VA
branch of the Stanford center was
the handling of subsistence prob
lems. After tomorrow, these prob

lems will have to he handled by the
veterans themselves with the Vet
erans Administration, 49 Fourth
Street, San Francisco, said Barahal.
"But Stanford will continue to aid
the veteran in this matter as much
as possible to insure minimum de
lays," he added.
Barahal advises all veterans to
maintain a file of all correspondence
with the Veterans Administration to
take along should a trip to San
Francisco be necessary. He also re
minds veterans a two-month delay
in receiving checks is not unusual.
GUIDANCE AVAILABLE
The center will continue as a vet
erans' records office and vocational
guidance center, he said. The guid
ance unit is headed by Lewis A.
Day, the only VA representative re
maining on the Farm. Although the
Stanford veterans receive the ma
jority of the attention, guidance

work is extended to other persons in
this area.
Barahal advises all veteans to
avail themselves of (he guidance
counseling. Applications for ap
pointments should be made as soon
as possible, he said. Final process
ing is promised before the end of
the quarter. The center has han
dled over 1,200 persons in complete
vocational guidance, and many oth
ers for partial help.
The service consists of a series
of interviews with professionally
trained counselors and a battery of
objective tests of scholastic aptitude,
special aptitude, vocational inter
ests, and personal traits.
After studying the veterans' cen
ters at other universities, Barahal
feels t lie Stanford organization is
the best on any campus. And he
has got the word of over 1,200 per
sons to back him up.

minds veterans a two-month delay
in receiving checks is not unusual.
GUIDANCE AVAILABLE
The center will continue as a vet
erans' records office and vocational
guidance center, he said. The guid
ance unit is headed by Lewis A.
Day, the only VA representative re
maining on the Farm. Although the
Stanford veterans receive the ma
jority of the attention, guidance

work is extended to other persons in
this area.
Barahal advises all veteans to
avail themselves of (he guidance
counseling. Applications for ap
pointments should be made as soon
as possible, he said. Final process
ing is promised before the end of
the quarter. The center has han
dled over 1,200 persons in complete
vocational guidance, and many oth
ers for partial help.
The service consists of a series
of interviews with professionally
trained counselors and a battery of
objective tests of scholastic aptitude,
special aptitude, vocational inter
ests, and personal traits.
After studying the veterans' cen
ters at other universities, Barahal
feels t lie Stanford organization is
the best on any campus. And he
has got the word of over 1,200 per
sons to back him up.
The Stanford veteran may feel
that his last tie with efficiency is
being cut away with the curtail
ment of Veterans Administration
functions on campus, but on second
thought he realizes how fortunate
he has been and will continue to be.
Recently the VA announced dras
tic cuts in its budget, with there
• ult that offices at Stanford and oth
er Bay Area colleges have been
slated for disbandment. To many
this will mean a few anxious mo
ments over that late check, and a
call at the Veterans' Center a few
blocks away will have to be re
placed by a jaunt to the City.
STAFF INCREASED
But that is all. According to
George Barahal, veterans' co-ordi
natoi and director of the Guidance
Center, veterans will continue to
receive the same co-operation and
• ei vice under the University setup.
And to aid in making life easier
for the Farm veterans, Stanford has
added two former VA workers to
llk staff: Burns Young, former reg
istration officer, as the new assist
ant to the veterans' co-ordinator;
and Chester Neal, former training
ofiicer, as vocational counselor.
Stanford established the Veterans'
Center in the fall of 1945, with the
VA and the University working in
close harmony. The VA appointed
Gilbert Davis chief training officer,
aided by Young, Neal, and two
clerks, Mrs. Nancy Forbes and Mrs.
Louise Thursby, both wives of
Stanford veterans. Barahal was ap
point cd to his post by the Univer
sity.
