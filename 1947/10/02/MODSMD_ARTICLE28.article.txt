# Overseas Libraries Ask Aid
## 
### 
Pleas from war-damaged libraries
abroad for American aid were re
ceived last week by ASSU Presi
dent Tom Martzloff from Chief
Counselor for Men Shelton L. Bcat
ty by means of a letter describing
the American Book Center.
A foundation for sending aid to
stricken libraries, the Center was
noted by Beatty "because of the
strong interest of Stanford students
in the needs of students in war
devastated countries . . . and (be
cause) I was impressed by the ar
ticles in The Daily this summer
from Lawrence Grannis, represen
tative of the Associated Students,
about the acute shortage of text -
books in European universities."
With scientific and technological
publications most desperately need
ed, the Center requests that a care
ful selection be made of prospective
shipments.
Operating from quarters in the
Library of Congress, the Center
plans to send from one to three
million books and periodicals to
Europe, Asia, and the Philippines.
All shipments should be sent pre
paid "via the cheapest means of
transportation" to the American
Book Center, c/o Library of Con
gress, Washington 25, D.C. The
Center will reimburse shipping
costs if they are not assumed by the
donor. "Collect" shipments will be
accepted and reimbursement can
not be made for packing.
