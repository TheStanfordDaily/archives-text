# Stanford Comic Book Survey Gives Academic Oscar to Donald and Co.
## 
### 
Donald Duck And his cohorts in
the animal cartoon world received
an academic "Oscar" from surveys
conducted by three Stanford gradu
ate students into the comic book
reading habits of children in Palo
Alto, South San Francisco, and
Mountain View junior and senior
high schools.
The researchers, Raymond P.
Whitfield, Chester E. Shamel, and
William H. Drummond, reported
comic books aren't as harmful as
many a harassed parent had sup
posed. Animal cartoons rated far
above any other comics, and no evi
dence was found to support the oft
heard argument comic books un
dermine children's morals, and hurt
their taste in literature.
The three surveys are reported in
detail in the October issue of Cali
fornia Parent-Teacher. The men

were assigned to the project by Dr.
Lawrence G. Thomas, Stanford
School of Education faculty member.
The survey concluded that the use
of comic book format in the presen
tation of reading matter to poor
r< aders miyht be it helpful technique
ior increasing both reading interests
and ability.
As a result of the Palo Alto sur
vey, Whitfield warned: "Those who
would eradicate ibis relatively harm
less form of recreation should be
prepared to supply a more construc
tive pastime before they take def
inite action."
