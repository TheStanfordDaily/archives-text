NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (UP).-Maul
ing four pitchers like the Bronx
Bombers of palmier days, the New
York Yankees battered the Brook
lyn Dodgers apart at the seams
today and Indian Allie Reynolds
coasted to a 10 to 3 victory in the
second name of the World Series.
'J'he Yankees laid down a bar
rage o! 15 base hits—including a
homer by Tummy J-lenrieh, three
record-tying, triples and two doub
les io jar the Dodgers into some
of the poorest play in series history
and to take a two to nothing lead
in the classic.
TIH IKIPI i: MARK
< hunky George Stirnweiss, hus
ky Johnny I.iiMlell and little Billy
Johnson belted out the triples
which tied the record of three
triples in one game held jointly
by the Dodgers in l!)l(i and the
Reds of Meanwhile, short
slop Pee-wee Reese of the Dodg
ers was tying a series standard of
not having a single fielding
chance.
The reason for that was that the j
Bombers were blasting most of j
their shots far, wide and handsome, j
They hopped on little Vic Lombardi, |
the curve - balling control hurler
who was the Dodgers' hope to even
the classic, for nine hits and five
runs in four innings. Hal Gregg,
the next Brooklyn tosser, lasted two
innings as he was smacked for two
hits and one run. Next, came Hank
Behrman, who was belted for three
hits arid four runs in one-third of
an inning and the Yanks wound it ;
up with one hit off Rex Barney in
one and two-third frames.
But it was a poor exhibition all
the way around for the Dodger
fielders. Their sandlot performance
drew raucous boos from a crowd of
()!),Bti. r j. The fans centered their ire
on "Pistol Pete" Reiser, the darling
of Flat bush, who three times let ex
tra base hits fall safe in his terri
tory.
NEWSOM vs. lIATTEN
The Yankees, who will shoot
fur their third straight tomorrow
with the veteran Hobo Newsom,
probably against Brooklyn's Joe
I laden, played winning hall right J
from the first inning, under a
warm sun that beamed down from
cloudless skies.
Stirnweiss, big man in the attack
with a triple and two singles in four
official times up, gave them a one
run lsad in the first when he sin
gled, barreled into third on Hen
rich's single and scored as Lindell
hi! into a double play.
The Dodgers fought back to tie it
up in the third on two hits. Reese
led off with a walk, stole second and
went to third on Eddie Stanky's
single as Stirnweiss made a sensa
tional stop to keep the fleet Reese
from scoring. Jackie Robinson
brought him home with a looping
single to left.
Again the Yankees went ahead in
the third when Stirnweiss tripled
over the leaping Stanky, the ball
rolling between Reiser and Walker.
Henrieh popped to make it two
away but Lindell. moved up to third
place in the batting order, paid ofT
that confidence when he belted a
tuple on which Reiser missed a
hoe: (ring catch after a slow start.

The Yankees really broke it wide
open in the fifth when the rattled
Dodgers started to come apart. Hen
rich opened by crashing a homer
into the rightfield bleachers at the
•"'O7 - foot mark. Lindell followed j
with a ground rules double which j
bounced into the leftfield boxes. '
With DiMnggio up, Lombardi threw :
one ball and then headed for the
bowers, Gregg replacing him.
Lindell held at second as DiMag
j'io grounded out but George Mc-
Ouinn whistled a single to center
to send him home. Johnson
grounded to Gregg then and, as the
pitcher fried to force McQuinn at
.second, Stanky dropped the ball for
the first error of the series. Yogi
Berra fanned to end the inning but
the miseue had hakeri the beloved
Rimhs.
