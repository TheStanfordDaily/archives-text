# Stanford Frosh, Santa Clara Top Local Spotlight Saturday
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Saturday afternoon the Stanford frosh football team will be unveiled
before local fans. The Indian papooses meet Santa Clara's frosh eleven in
the opener of their five-game schedule. The contest, slated for 2:110 in the
spacious Stanford Stadium, will feature the Farm's sports wteekend in the
absence of the varsity eleven in the East enjoying Aim Arbor hospitality.

Chuck Taylor, head freshman
coach, has expressed the opinion
that "We must work on fundamen
tals before a winning team can be
molded. The boys are optimistic,
full of spirit, and really pointing to
Saturday's game with Santa Clara."
His charges have been practicing at
least two hours daily since Sept. 15,
and have shown considerable prog
ress. Taylor is especially pleased
with the strength and depth of his
ends, tackles, and quarterbacks.
Assisting Taylor in coaching the
70 - man yearling squad are
"Crunch" Crane, fullback on the
"Vow Boys" aggregation of 1041,
who tutors the backs, and Dick
Madigan, regular guard of last year,
who is line coach. Jack Otterson,
assisted by Mort Willard, handles
the managerial chores.
SC FROSH LOSE FIRST
Santa Clara's frosh, with a game
under their belts, are rated a strong
team, have a hefty line, and use a
T-formation attack with passes fea
tured. Last week the baby Broncos
lost a close 12-G decision to Santa
Rosa JC.
Although a starting lineup will
not be named until tomorrow, there
have been numerous standouts on
the large Stanford squad. At left
end are Dick Schulze, (i ft. 3 in., 104-
pound. All-Cily star from Fremont
of Oakland; Tom Vasilatos, defen

sive standout from Washington, Bill
' Farrar, and Tom Eckman. At left
tackle, Gordon White, 200 - pound
! All - Stater from Houston, Texas,
Gerald Harder, and Bill Moore have
looked good. Don Lucas and Tom
: Paulson are the most likely pros
' pects at left guard.
Dick Abraham, 200 - pound All-
City from Lincoln in San Francisco,
is holding down the center position,
backed up by Fred Chez and Ralph
I Davidson. At right guard are Harry
Hunt and Ray Galvin. Walt Waters,
200 - pound All - League lineman
from Piedmont, and Bill Beeger are
found at light tackle. The right ends
{ include Tom August, brother of
! varsity center Pete, rangy Bob
Scott, and John Wallace.
BACKS LOOK STRONG
At quarterback, Taylor has two
I fine candidates in Wayne Buck, All-
Leaguer from Campbell, and Tom
Shaw, who made All-City at Port
] land, Oregon. Left halfbacks include
Boyd Benson, A! 1 -City John Hollo
way from San Diogo, and Wally Od
j neal.
At right half, John Banks, a con
verted end, should start, and sup
port will be furnished by Jim Hayes
j and Ken La Crose. Gordon Mac-
Lachlan, All-City from St. Ignatius
{ in San Francisco, along with Bob
1 Altick and Ray Dodson, have per
formed well at fullback.


Stanford's footballers might be seeing altogether too much of DON
KUICK. Michigan halfback, wlien they meet him Saturday afternoon at
Ann Arbor. The eighteen-year-old ISO pounder is just one of Coach
Fritz Crisler's many highly touted hackficld speed burners.
