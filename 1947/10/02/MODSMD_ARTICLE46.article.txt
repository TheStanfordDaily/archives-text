# Mighty Mich Poses Problem For Marchie
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
Now that the Indian football team
is comfortably berthed on the City of
San Francisco and well on its way to
Ann Arbor, it seems safe to reveal
the pertinent and discouraging facts
about mighty Michigan, Stanford's
grid opponent come Saturday.
All summer long the tubs in the
east and midwest have been thump
ing for "the greatest team in Michi
gan history," with many eastern
writers picking the Wolverines as the
number one collegiate eleven in the
country.
All this noise and fuss over Michi
gan is not without foundation.
They have a light, fast backfield,
working off the single wing and T.
The Wolverine offense rolled up an
impressive 1844 yards from rush
ing and 1322 from passing last year,
tops for the Big Nine.
The man that practically made it
all himself was Bob Chappuis
(Chap-e-yus) more widely known in
the midwest as the "Toledo Terror.'
He shattered the Big Nine over-all
individual offensive mark by rolling
up 1,039 yards, averaged 148.1 yards
per game passing and rushing, hit
36 of 64 passes for 596 yards, for a
completion percentage of .563, also
a new conference record.
Not very far behind Chappuis in
the"run and pass 'em to death" de
partment is quarterback Chalmers
"Bump" Elliot. Elliot, a stocky lit
tle red-topped galloper, cracked
through opponent lines 5.1 yards per
carry on 30 attempts, connected
with four of six passes for 77 yards
and racked up four touchdowns.
Tomorrow—The dope on Michi
gan's line, all 1,326 pounds of i(.)
