### 
"Bull Session" and "History" are columns
which have appeared semi-regularly in The
Daily in recent years. Both are read by large
groups of students at Stanford and both arouse
much interest.
"History" is primarily a column which in
terprets, or investigates, political or social
problems —sometimes international, other
times on a national or local scope.
"Bull Session" on the other hand has devel
oped into a campus humor column. The con
fused freshman, the Quad character, or the
woman med student are all "Bull Session
subjects.
It requires a highly competent writer to turn
out top grade "History" or "Bull Session" col
umns regularly. Everyone yearns to be a col

umnist but few can do the job.
It will be the policy of The Daily this volume
to run these columns only when the content
justifies their usage. In other words they will
be a regular feature only if they offer some
thing to the reader.
At the present time many persons are con
templating turning in sample columns. How
ever The Daily would like many more pros
pective columnists to write a couple of col
umns and submit them.
The larger the number of sample columns
from which to choose, the more chance The
Daily has of finding a top-notch columnist.
If you have the ambition, the talent, and the
time, the doors of The Daily shack will be open
to you.
