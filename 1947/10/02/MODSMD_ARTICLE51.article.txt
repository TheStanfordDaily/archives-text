### AL MUNK 
Christopher! They've already got 8,000 students
and 26 dogs on campus and still they want more.
Rally Com may have been fooling some people last
Tuesday when they went to the SP station to kiss
off the football team, but in reality there was an
ulterior motive.
Every train passing through Paly's stockyard
station —the building over the underpass—got a ser
enade complete with Glockenspiel accompaniment, a
rousing hubba-hubba from the yell leaders, and a
welcoming speech extolling the merits of Stanford
University. At least three young men left the San
Jose-S.F. 2:15 train prematurely, thanked the stu
dents for the welcome, paid the late registration fee,
and swelled the student body.
But Rally Com went all out in their recruiting
drive! Not only did they serenade passenger trains,
but they also extended their huckstering to a de
fenseless milk train on track 3. However, none of
the train's homogenized cans followed in the steps
of the three young men.
Yep, it was quite a send-off. The whole team
trooped down the tracks with suitcases and over
coats in hand, smiling bravely, grinding their teeth
in anticipation—but why shouldn't they, with a
two and-a-half-day train ride ahead of them that
would be enough to shake any man's morale?

The following freshman story is absolutely true,
we swear. A well-dressed young rough, in his best
blue suit, was hanging around the front of Branner
Hall about 7:30 the other evening, apparently waiting

for a female aequaintanee, and looking a great deal
like a permanent fixture.
Up swooshed a sleek Cadillac, and a cute little
blond freshman stepped out, looked inquiringly, and
chirped: "You the boy, here?"
Our young hero played along, unloaded the Cad
illac's trunk, lugged the multitude of female luggage
up the stairs of Branner, and also got quite an in
teresting tour of duty along the corridors of the
hallowed hall.
The cute little blond number apparently thought
well of his services, for she opened her purse and
handed him a five spot. Our young colleague refused
politely: "That's all right, girlie, but I'll be studying
with you in a couple of days!"

Long skirts, as predicted, are in for their share
of comment about campus. Ever since reg day a
couple of characters with a metal tape have been
stalking unsuspecting femmes around Quad, and
checking the new length, or so they claim, of the
skirts. Just so you're warned, girls, in case you feel
the touch of cold metal around your legs.
But Wednesday afternoon, with the strain of
first day classes unbearable, one young rough went
after the "New Look" with, devilish efficiency.
Last seen, he was chasing some long skirts past the
Cellar with a sizeable pair of garden shears in his
wildly-waving hands. We don't know how high he
cut the new fashion.
But this whole squabble about the long skirts
leaves me cold. Why should it bother me? I've got
a good memory!
