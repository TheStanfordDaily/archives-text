### CECIL ROSPAW 
It will take years before accurate figures will be
available on just how many men cracked up psycho
logically while in service. Many of the rejections,
and there were more than one would think, were on
the basis of mental unbalance. Many more men were
weeded out soon after induction. Some men stayed
on in service long after they were really unfit for
good service. One way or another it would be easy
to say that at least 1,000,000 men were affected by
mental difficulties.
At the height of the war when more than 11,000,-
000 men were under arms the army could be likened
to large semi-independent state controlling its own
empire of men, finance, and food.
Idealists and dreamers, the men who try to plan
the "perfect state," are usually amazed to find that
their plans coincide in many ways with army organi
zational charts.
Mdical care is free and equal, a central depart
ment metes out justice; the ideals of the plan and the
actuality of the army coincide in numerous ways.
In the "ideal planned state all men are free and
equal. In the reality of the army men are divided
into two classes, the ruling hierarchy and the workers.
We try to believe in the plan as the ultimate in
living and yot millions of Americans when faced by
this actual ideal couldn't stand up to the strain.
It would be easy at this point to dismiss the plan
as a failure, raise the flag of "Free Enterprise" or
what have you, and do a merry dance on a discarded
corpse.
Could it be that we have too much freedom in this
country.' Ihat our schools, elementary and secondary
especially are too lax and easygoing? Do we need
more discipline in the home and the school? Do chil

dren stop respecting their parents and teachers much
too soon and break off on uncharted ways only to
find at the end of the path that the older, proven
methods of day-by-day personal discipline really
work?
Of course the whole fault of "The Plan," The
Ideal, the army, or any other system lies within the
human being himself. The root of most of the prob
lems of the world are to be found in the fallibility
of human nature.
Because of human nature, an army is probably
inevitable, and it is almost as inevitable that it will
be run as it is now run.
One reason for the many crack-ups might be
in the type of education given young Americans to
day, with lack of home and school discipline being
the underlying failure of the educational system.
Germany as a nation fell to the harangues of
Nazism only after the first attempts at control had
been successful in the educational system. Russia
was an uneducated country when the Bolshevik
minority took over.
It would behoove us in this country to look at our
educational system if we are determined to keep
progressing. Are we turning out mentally fit men
and women? Do they understand what this vague
item "freedom" really is? If they do, how much are
they willing to sacrifice to keep it? Are they trained
and mentally disciplined early enough to stay strong
and useful mentally and physically in later life?
The psychological cases left by the wayside by the
rigid army system are more than enough proof to
answer some of these questions. The rest I will leave
to you. U.M.T. will have to be decided in the next
six months, one way or another. I can only urge you
to think about it.
