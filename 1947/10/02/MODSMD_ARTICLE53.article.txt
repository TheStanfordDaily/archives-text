To the Editor, Stanford Daily:
The situation in the Village chow line this quarter
is bad. From the time the doors are opened till closing
time, the line is so long it is almost impossible to get
food and eat under 45 minutes or an hour.
Apparently this situation is not the fault of those
running the mess hall, but of the students them
selves. They loiter and dawdle along the steam tables,
engaging in n lot of unnecessary conversation, with
no thought to those who are waiting behind them.
This is also true of the tray line, where everyone

stops at the paper chutes to pick off individual
pieces, stops again at the milk bottle rack, and so on.
If this stuff, the paper and the utensils, are piled on
the 4ray before leaving the table, no time has to be
wasted.
As classes will start on schedule today, and many
will find themselves trying to get to the village
from an 11 o'clock, eat, and back to a 1 o'clock, I
think that an effort should be made by everyone to
use a little consideration for the other fellow and do
his part to speed things up. Mark Stanton
