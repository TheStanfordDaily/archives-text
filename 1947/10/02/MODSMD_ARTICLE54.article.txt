# Reserve Book Room Installs $5,000 Fluorescent Lighting
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
One perennial student gripe—that
of poor lighting in the libe—was
partly alleviated this summer when
fluorescent lights costing the Uni
versity approximately $5,000 were
installed in the Reserve Book Room
of the main library.
Daily editorials, letters to the edi
tor, committees, and subcommittees
have protested for generations
about libe lights.
"More than once in the dim, dark
period before the war," states a
Daily editorial, "The Daily came
out with editorials asking for better
library lights.
SAME CONDITIONS
"Since that time hundreds of libe
habitues have passed on to gradu
ation and seeing-eye dogs never be
lieving a time would come when
type smaller than newspaper head
lines could be read in the depths of
the main reading room."
Conditions in the main reading
room, however, will probably re
main the same for some time, since
a lighting committee this summer
marked the reserve room vas the
only place "urgently" needing new
lighting, according to Carroll Black
er. superintendent of buildings.
INSTALLATIONS OBSOLETE'
Blacker said that the main rea
son other lighting improvements
have been postponed is that such
great improvements are now being
made in lighting that the University
is afraid any new installations made
now will be obsolete in a few years.
Eldridge Spencer, director of
planning for the University, stated
this summer that he had just re
turned from a tour of 12 Eastern
universities and that all of them

have lighting as bad or worse than
Stanford.
"If we attempted to bring the
reading room lights closer to the
tables, we would be confronted with
many more heating, ventilation, and
i acoustical problems," Spencer said.
Besides the new lights in the re
serve room, the shelves around the
walls have been removed and the
walls have been painted white.
Pay typewriters have also been
installed downstairs, and plans have
been made for a music listening
room opposite the document room.
