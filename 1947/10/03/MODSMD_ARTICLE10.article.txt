Lawrence Grannis and Bill Fai
rer from their European travels.
I am deeply interested to learn
their reaction to the economic and
social conditions they have ob
served. I hope that the reports
which they will bring to the stu
dent body will stimulate earnest
thought on the part of each of
us and help to clarify our think
ing on the perplexing problems of
international relations which face
us today."

ISC Chairman Bob Hoyt said
Grannis and Fairer followed a pre
arranged itinerary, heavily sched
uled with stops at Europe's schools
where, by interviews and inform
al discussion, they learned the
thoughts, the sympathies, the wants,
and the trends of Europes students.
"I tried to hit the universities
strictly on a student - to - student
level," Fairer declared, "and I feel
that traveling unofficially as I did,
the opinions and statements which
I brought back are an accurate re
flection of these students' attitudes. - '
Grannis visited live countries
England, France, Holland, Bel
gium. and Spain - from his initial
landing until he sailed for home

Sept. 9. His periodic letters to The
Daily during the summer months
described student life, conditions,
and academic and political trends at
the various universities he visited.
Among the schools which Grannis
surveyed were: Paris' Cite Univer
sitaire near the Sorbonne, Spain's
Barcelona University, the Univer
sity of Amsterdam, and Leiden in
Holland.
"One very encouraging thing
about the trip," Grannis declared,
"was the consistently cordial recep
tion we received from the students
at the various foreign universities. ;

"Their intense interest in Ameri
can schools leads me to believe that
we'll be able to establish many
worthwhile exchanges and similar
projects."
Included in Farrer's visit were
the Universities of Warsaw, Vienna,
and Athens; Charles University at
Prague, which was also the scene
of the World Youth Festival in Au
gust; and the Harvard University
students' foundation at Salzburg.
While in Rome, Farrer said he
was given the chance to make an
unscheduled trip to Greece when

he was offered a ride on an RAF
trainer being delivered to Athens'
by the British government.
Farrer and Grannis were chosen
for the tour last spring by a board
composed of Alvin C. Eurich. vice
president of the University; Thomas
S. Barclay, professor of political sci
ence; Raymond D. Harriman, pro
fessor of classics; the ASSU presi
dent and vice-president; and the
chairman of ISC. Both lew stu
dents, the delegates had exceptional
undergraduate records in academic
and student activity fields.
