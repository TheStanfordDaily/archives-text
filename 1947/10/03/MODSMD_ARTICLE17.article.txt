# Tarnished Indians Face High Flying Wolverines
## Michigan Is Ton Heavy Favorite Over Injury Plagued Card Eleven 
### JACK CASHEL 
Stanford's brand new but slightly tarnished football eleven
bumps into just about the most formidable opposition to be found
anywhere in the country this season, when they move onto the
field against the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor tomorrow
afternoon.
Some 85,000 persons are expected to cram every inch of

f Michigan's big bowl, for the first of
a four game home and home series
I between the two teams.
Thousands of words have been
written about the power-house
which Coach Fritz Crisler has as
sembled at Ann Arbor. As early as
last fall experts began touting the
Wolverines for a possible national
championship.
Coach Crisler himself turned down
a very attractive offer to switch
coaching allegiances to the Univer
| sity of California last spring, re
j portedly to stay at the helm of what
| has been termed "Greatest Michigan
team since 1922."
CHAPPUIS IS BIG GUN
The Michigan backfield, headed by
Bob Chappuis, operates behind a
light, fast line, which in Michigan's
opening game of the season last week
against Michigan State was out
weighed 18 pounds per man. But
though dwarfed, they opened enough
holes to allow the Wolverine backs
to score 55 points.
On defense, Coach Crisler usually
moves in more beef, which helps
raise the line average to 200 pounds
per man. In proof that these big
boys do their work well, it may be
noted that Michigan State drove no
further than the Michigan 37 yard

The Stanford-Michigan game at
i Ann Arbor, Michigan, will be
broadcast over Station KSFO, Sftft
kilocycles, at 11:45 a.m. tomor
row. Associated sportcaster will
be Carroll Hansen and Associated
commentator will be Doug Pledg

Stanford's hopes of pulling one of
the bigger upsets of the season
against the Wolverines all but flew
out the window when the casualty
list was announced.
INJURY LIST ANNOUNCED
Game Captain George Quist, still
favoring an ankle injury, will prob
ably not play at all. Bob Anderson,
nursing a bunged-up shoulder will
most likely play little if any. Tackle
Ai Rau did not make the trip, hav
ing suffered a broken ankle in the
Idaho game.
Mickey Titus will fill in for Quist
as he did in the Idaho game. Wayne
Erickson will probably get the call
if Anderson does not start.
Coach Schwartz concedes the In
-110 one, at least among the thirty
no one, at least amng the thirty
seven players, concedes a Michigan
victory.
The Indians will be holding a dis
tinct weight advantage when the
kickoff comes. Stanford's starting
line of Burke and Martin at ends,
Budge and Phleger at tackles,
Clark and Fcldman at guards and
Flat land at center averages a tidy
210 pounds. This gives the Indians
a starting 2. r ) pound weight advan
tage per man.
Coach Schwartz hinted that the
j Indians may attempt to travel
! through the air, if they find the
| going too lough on the ground.
Stanford's long passing game
clicked smoothly against Idaho, ac
counting for two touchdowns. When
and if quarterbacks Ainslee Bell and
AI Morris start connecting and mix
ing short and long passes, the Indians j
can move successfully.
POSSIBILITY OF RAIN
The possibility of rain may help
the Stanford cause in no small meas
ure. Michigan's light, fast line and
backs may find the going against a
big line on a wet field not to their
liking.
The Stanford-Michigan game is
one of six which Pacific Coast Con
ference teams play with members
of the Big-Nine this year. UCLA
already has beaten lowa 22 to 7,
while the University of Minnesota

edged Washington 7 to f> last week
end.

Stanford's brand new but slightly tarnished football eleven
bumps into just about the most formidable opposition to be found
anywhere in the country this season, when they move onto the
field against the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor tomorrow
afternoon.
Some 85,000 persons are expected to cram every inch of

f Michigan's big bowl, for the first of
a four game home and home series
I between the two teams.
Thousands of words have been
written about the power-house
which Coach Fritz Crisler has as
sembled at Ann Arbor. As early as
last fall experts began touting the
Wolverines for a possible national
championship.
Coach Crisler himself turned down
a very attractive offer to switch

light, fast line, which in Michigan's
opening game of the season last week
against Michigan State was out
weighed 18 pounds per man. But
though dwarfed, they opened enough
holes to allow the Wolverine backs
to score 55 points.
On defense, Coach Crisler usually
moves in more beef, which helps

noted that Michigan State drove no
further than the Michigan 37 yard

Stanford's brand new but slightly tarnished football eleven
bumps into just about the most formidable opposition to be found
anywhere in the country this season, when they move onto the
field against the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor tomorrow
afternoon.
Some 85,000 persons are expected to cram every inch of

f Michigan's big bowl, for the first of
a four game home and home series
I between the two teams.
Thousands of words have been
written about the power-house
which Coach Fritz Crisler has as
sembled at Ann Arbor. As early as
last fall experts began touting the
Wolverines for a possible national
championship.
Coach Crisler himself turned down
a very attractive offer to switch
coaching allegiances to the Univer
| sity of California last spring, re
j portedly to stay at the helm of what
| has been termed "Greatest Michigan
team since 1922."
CHAPPUIS IS BIG GUN
The Michigan backfield, headed by
Bob Chappuis, operates behind a
light, fast line, which in Michigan's
opening game of the season last week
against Michigan State was out
weighed 18 pounds per man. But
though dwarfed, they opened enough
holes to allow the Wolverine backs
to score 55 points.
On defense, Coach Crisler usually
moves in more beef, which helps
raise the line average to 200 pounds
per man. In proof that these big
boys do their work well, it may be
noted that Michigan State drove no
further than the Michigan 37 yard

The Stanford-Michigan game at
i Ann Arbor, Michigan, will be
broadcast over Station KSFO, Sftft

line in their game Saturday.
Stanford's hopes of pulling one of
the bigger upsets of the season
against the Wolverines all but flew
out the window when the casualty
list was announced.
INJURY LIST ANNOUNCED
Game Captain George Quist, still
favoring an ankle injury, will prob
ably not play at all. Bob Anderson,
nursing a bunged-up shoulder will
most likely play little if any. Tackle
Ai Rau did not make the trip, hav
ing suffered a broken ankle in the
Idaho game.
Mickey Titus will fill in for Quist
as he did in the Idaho game. Wayne
Erickson will probably get the call
if Anderson does not start.
Coach Schwartz concedes the In
-110 one, at least among the thirty
no one, at least amng the thirty
seven players, concedes a Michigan
victory.
The Indians will be holding a dis
tinct weight advantage when the
kickoff comes. Stanford's starting
line of Burke and Martin at ends,
Budge and Phleger at tackles,
Clark and Fcldman at guards and
Flat land at center averages a tidy
210 pounds. This gives the Indians
a starting 2. r ) pound weight advan
tage per man.
Coach Schwartz hinted that the
j Indians may attempt to travel
! through the air, if they find the
| going too lough on the ground.
Stanford's long passing game
clicked smoothly against Idaho, ac
counting for two touchdowns. When
and if quarterbacks Ainslee Bell and
AI Morris start connecting and mix
ing short and long passes, the Indians j
can move successfully.
POSSIBILITY OF RAIN
The possibility of rain may help
the Stanford cause in no small meas
ure. Michigan's light, fast line and
backs may find the going against a
big line on a wet field not to their
liking.
