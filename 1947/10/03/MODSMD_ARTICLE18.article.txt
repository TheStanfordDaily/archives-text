# Rally Com Decks Goal Posts, Sparks Cardinal Sport Spirit
## 
### JACK COLEMAN 
Those creatures hanging from
goal posts the day before the "Big
(Jame" are not monkeys, they're
members of Rally Com wrapping
goal posts for the game. Those
creatures painting trash pails are
not rats painting their houses,
they're members of Rally Com
working to arouse campus enthu
siasm to help make football the be
loved festivity it has grown to be.
Arousing "spirit" entails much
work, and according to Barbara
Carter, co-chairman of Rally Com,
it pays off in fun and satisfaction.
Rally Com office in room 2 and the
balcony of the Union is always clut
tered with "those creatures" work
ing on card stunts, working out skits
for rallies, painting posters and
.* the second-floor balcony is
carpeted with unfinished signs and
posters. Room 2 is always cluttered
with cokes and coffee and busy pen
cils.
Rally Com consists of 20 men, l(i
Women, and 20 freshmen on the
liyout committee. Members of the
tryoul committee are not official
members of Rally* Com, but when
appointments come up during
rpiing quarter, they have first

choice for Rally Com openings. Miss
Carter estimates that about 1H of
the new frosh tryout committee will
be selected next spring.
The two chairmen of Rally Com
are, by regulation, the only seniors
on the committee, juniors being au
tomatically retired upon finishing
their junior year. Co-chairmen of
Rally Com this year are Miss Carter
and Dave Heyler.
Appointment to Rally Com does
not guarantee three years of mem
bership, but members are retained
only on the basis of work done.
Rally Com is organized into Class
I, consisting of five junior men and
four junior women, and Class 11,
consisting of 15 men and 12 women.
Head yell leader and the director of
the Stanford Band are also members
of the committee. Tryouts for fresh
men are held every fall, and tryouts
for the rest of the committee are
held in the spring.
Pajamarinos, street dances, decid
ing whether to split the men's and
women's rooting sections, planning
seating arrangements at athletic
contests, trying out yells at rallies
for the game, hiring the car with
the loudspeaker, getting the band
chairs for the rally platform, taking

| polls to see how many plan to be at
j the important games, distributing
j stickers, planning the Spring Sings,
j searching incessantly for new and
J better and bigger and more original
card stunts, planning the "Big
Game" bonfires and rallies are but
a few of Rally Corn's activities.
As for their plans for the future,
Miss Carter looks for greater stu
dent co-operation with Rally Com
efforts; a new Axe case, which has
been ordered and will be placed in
the Cellar; loads and loads of fresh
men with loads and loads of talent
and original ideas trying out now
for Rally Com.
Miss Carter predicts more and
better card stunts Rally Com has
15 new stunts up its sleeve for the
Santa Clara game and new ideas
for cheering section seating effects.
An innovation this year will be the
Block "S" of pom-pom-armed coeds
in the men's rooting section. This
stunt requires about '550 women.
Rally Corn's biggest aim for the
year is raising the omnimportant
SPIRIT to an all - time high and
getting "the kids behind the team
win or lose."
