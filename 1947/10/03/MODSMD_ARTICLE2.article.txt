### 
If you have apptitudc in creating
card stunts, skits, songs, and yells,
you are eligible to compete for posi

sophomore and junior men and 20
members of the freshmen class (men

men Dave Heyler and Barbara Car
ter.
Interviews will be held today from
2 to 5:30 p.m. in the Rally Com
ofTice, Room 2, second floor of the
Student Union. All those interested
are urged to try out.
Tryoutees will be judged partially
upon previous experience in high
school or college and upon origin
ality of ideas presented in the inter
view, Heyler said. Students should
also be able to devote three to four
hours daily and all day Saturday
upon Rally Com activities.
The main work of Rally Com
falls during autumn quarter when
members usher at the football games,
arrange rooting sections, organize
and put on rallies, and work out card
stunts and yells. Later they spon
sor the Spring Sing and the nom
ination of yell leaders.
Permanent appointments will be
announced next week in the Daily,
after interviews have been com
pleted.
Approximately 18 of the freshmen
members will be chosen during
spring quarter to serve on the 1948
Rally Com. The following year,
however, they must again try out
for permanent positions.
The permanent committee is tra
ditionally made up of sophomores
and juniors, with two seniors chosen
as co-chairmen.

j Tonight is the last night for sing- |
j ers, dancers and actors to try out i

! eties.
Pleased with the large turnout for i
j the first two casting sessions, George j
Eckstein, director of the musical and j
| variety revue, announced that there I
j is still room for more talent, espec
ially warblers and dancers.
Eckstein and his stall of Larry
Frankley, Don ShelTey, Allen Flet
cher and Hal Todd will be stationed
at the Ram's Head room, Memorial
Auditorium at 7:30 tonight to look
over the last of the aspirants.
"We've got to get production
schedules rolling quickly," Eckstein
said, "so this is positively the last
time Stanford talent at large can
show its wares."
Skit writers must turn in their
â–  finished products by next Friday at
i the Dramatic Manager's office, sec
ond floor of the Old Union. Writers
can have all the latitude thoy want
I in subject matter.
Although the score of the show is
fast rounding into shape, musical
director ShefTey still has room fux I
some high caliber songs in the show. |
These also must be turned in by
Get. 10 at the Dramatic Manager's
office.
Technical director Frankley will
still be signing up stage crew mem
| hers tonight.
"Anyone who doesn't make the
! cast of the Gaieties but who is still
I anxious to achieve membership in
Ram's Head, the honorary dramatic
I society, should remember that more
j credit is given technicians than act
( ors lor participation in Gaieties,"
Frankley said.
Experience is not a qualification
for stage crew. "We'll train you,"
Frankley promises.
