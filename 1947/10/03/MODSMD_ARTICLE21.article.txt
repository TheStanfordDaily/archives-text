# Roguish Movie Starts Series
## 
### 
Stanford's Sunday Evening Mov
ies will be resumed Sunday with a
re-release of one of the most suc
cessful comedies produced in IMB,
"The Young in Heart," starring
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Paulette
Goddard, Janet Gaynor, Roland
Young, and Billie Burke.
The story concerns a family of in
ternational rogues who devote their
time to practicing the more polite
forms of mooching, chiseling, and
outright thievery. They attempt to
ply their "Art" on an old lady who
believes that the secret of happiness
lies in trusting those one loves. The
result is a series of unexpected and
complicated situations that provide
the humor for the rest of the show.
In addition, the program will in
clude selected short subjects and the
first installment of a new serial,
"Flash Gordon." The movies will
commence at 7:110 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. Admission price is
twenty cents.
Student Movie Manager is Bob
Manning who will conduct the series
for the 1947-48 school year.
