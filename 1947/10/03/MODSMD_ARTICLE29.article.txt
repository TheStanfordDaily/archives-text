# Doodles Declares Daffy D-Day; Frantic Farm Heads for Cover
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
It was "D Day" at Memorial Au
ditorium Wednesday afternoon —"D
Day" because Doodles Weaver had
come home again.
He was standing in the wings pre
paratory to "going into his act" in
Station KSU's inaugural show of
the quarter.
But before he stomped out to face
the student-packed house, he quit
moving around in the wings long
enough to do a graceful slide back
into the past.
Weaver, red hair and Stanford '36,
mustered a never-ending reservoir
of gags and Cardinal legends that
date back to the Fabulous Thirties.
"I always like to visit Stanford,"
Doodles said. "It brings back so
many memories, especially the
number of trips to the dean's office."
ACTIONS NOT FICTION
It must be explained, however,
that Doodles' antics on campus had
no similarity to fiction, and any re
semblance to the average Farm stu
dent was purely accidental.
"Had a big, five-foot, stuffed black
cat," Doodles said, spreading his
arms away from his body to indicate
the size of the pseudo-feline, "and
went down to the Varsity Theater.
I took the cat with me.
"I walked up to the box office,
bought two tickets—one for the cat
and one for me. Well, gee, I thought
I'd like to take Felix, that's the
name of my cat, to the show.
"So I set the cat down in the
seat next to me and a lot of people
thought I musta been nuts or some
thing. The dean heard about me
and Felix, but by the time he had
gotten the story, it had stretched so
much that people actually had me
talking to Felix, putting my arm
around the cat, and a lot of foolish
things."
SUCCESS IS TOUGH
Doodles winked, his right eye
moving like uncontrolled stop sig

nals. He puffed leisurely on a black
stogie and shifted his verbal attack
into a plateau of seriousness.
"Being a success is tough," he
said, "because it takes so long to be
successful — half a lifetime maybe.
At Stanford a guy has four years'
time in order to become a hit in
life, and the competition isn't too
tough.
"Of course, I guess I'm just a
'sophomore' in life 'cause I've only
been on the comedy circuit five
years now."
There is always someone to re
mind the wiry clown prince of other
good-natured antics that, at times,
were looked upon with disfavor
from the administration.
The leap of death from Hoover
Library tower was later discovered
as the gag of the week when horri
fied professors and students gasped
and screamed as a man jumped
from the tower and crashed to the
ground.
"I had 'em fooled," Doodles re
marked later; "it was only Felix.
You know—my big stuffed cat."
Take, for instance, the case of the

classic Chewy, vintage '22, and the
race from Lasuen Street to Los
Angeles. On the day of the an
nounced big race, Doodles hopped
madly into his hot rod and acciden
tally drove smack dab into a palm
tree.
"It was a lot of fun—everything
was. Why I even went out for soc
cer," he stated, striking a pose of an
imaginary Block "S" husky. Doo
dles, one could sense, was having
the time of his life on campus again.
He had been in the show business
even before he composed his wacky
"Nuts to Cnl" song the night before
the '36 Big Game. There was scarce
ly a time when Doodles wasn't seat
ed at a piano lulling himself into
near musical insanity.
"I was so musical I was even ac
cused of ruining a piano over at
Encina. But I was innocent, so help
me!"
HITS TIIE ROAD SOON
The madcap redhead, currently
one of the featured comics on the
CBS Spike Jones Revue, will hit the
road next week on a nation-wide
tour which will eventually reach the
boards on New York's "circuit of
corn."
Such was the stand of Doodles
Weaver on his self-selected home
coming. He screwed his face into a
mask of merriment and departed
with a chuckle that made one en
vious of the old days.
Perhaps someone had proclaimed
a "D Day" on the Farm—and may
be that someone was Doodles.
