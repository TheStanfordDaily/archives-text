## Indian Forwards Outweigh Wolverines; Average 25 Pounds More per Player 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
If figures mean anything, Stanford's line should push Michi
gan all over the field tomorrow. The Indians outweigh the Wol
verines 25 pounds per man!
With a speedy backfield behind it, Michigan's line depends
upon trap plays on opposing guards and tackles and check blocks

to open holes for Messrs. Chappuis,
Derricotte, and Elliot. If—and that's
a BIG if the Farm line can out
charge and out-think the Wolver
ine forwards, they may put the stop
per' on the highly touted pre-season
"Rose Bowl champs."
From end to end the only thing
encouraging to Stanford hopes is the
Jack of weight in the Ann Arbor
offensive line. Ed "Scottie" Mc-
Neill, a 188-pounder, holds down
left end. He is described by Michi
gan newsmen as "the cool, deter
mined type, at. his best in the
clutch" "Pinky" Phleger (215), In
dian light tackle, scraps with him

when Stanford is on defense.
MANN GREAT RECEIVER
Whit Budge (220) should be in
for a pleasant afternoon opposing
Michigan right end Bob Mann (lt>s).
This 55 - pound weight difference
should put Budge in the middle of
Wolverine interference all after
noon. Mann, a trackman, is prin
cipally an offensive end. Described
as a great pass catcher, he scored
five times for the Wolverines last
season and gained 285 yards from
scrimmage in that role.
Picked by most of the Eastern
scribes for All-American honors is
left tackle, Captain Bruce Hilkene
(190). Shifted from end after his
freshman year, Hilkene stood out
in the 1942 Notre Dame game and
has been improving ever since.
Marty Feldman (230) grunts and
groans with him on defense with
Ted Burke (212), Indian right end,
taking over the chore when Stan
ford has the ball.
PRITULA 'TOUGH, MEAN'
Bill Pritula (190) starts at right
tackle. A 25-year-old Air Force
veteran, he is described as "tough
and mean." Exchanging glares and
elbows with him will be Gene Mar
tin (192) and John Clark (205) on
offense and defense respectively.
Wolverine guards Dominic Toma
si (180) and Stu Wilkins (185) are
both tabbed "watch charm" guards
by the Michigan press. Built low
to the ground, they pride them
selves on their ability to "stone
wall" the center of the Ann Arbor

line. John Clark and Marty Feld
man have their work cut out for
(hem moving these rocks.
Stanford's only returning first
string lineman is center Dick Flat
land (202). With equal ability but
less weight is John T. White (187)
of Michigan. "J.T." is a former Ohio
State end. He beat Michigan five
years ago with his pass catching and
was warmly welcomed when he
shifted over to the Wolverine camp.
AN EDUCATED TOE
Don't count on Michigan missing
any extra points after touchdown.
Reserve center Jim Brieske only
missed one conversion after the
Michigan State game last week in
eight tries. His toe accounted for
32 field goal and conversion points
in 194(5.

Marty Feldman (230) grunts and
groans with him on defense with
Ted Burke (212), Indian right end,
taking over the chore when Stan
ford has the ball.
PRITULA 'TOUGH, MEAN'
Bill Pritula (190) starts at right
tackle. A 25-year-old Air Force
veteran, he is described as "tough
and mean." Exchanging glares and
elbows with him will be Gene Mar
tin (192) and John Clark (205) on
offense and defense respectively.
Wolverine guards Dominic Toma
si (180) and Stu Wilkins (185) are
both tabbed "watch charm" guards
by the Michigan press. Built low
to the ground, they pride them
selves on their ability to "stone
wall" the center of the Ann Arbor

line. John Clark and Marty Feld
man have their work cut out for
(hem moving these rocks.
Stanford's only returning first
string lineman is center Dick Flat
land (202). With equal ability but
less weight is John T. White (187)
of Michigan. "J.T." is a former Ohio
State end. He beat Michigan five
years ago with his pass catching and
was warmly welcomed when he
shifted over to the Wolverine camp.
AN EDUCATED TOE
Don't count on Michigan missing
any extra points after touchdown.
Reserve center Jim Brieske only
missed one conversion after the
Michigan State game last week in
eight tries. His toe accounted for
32 field goal and conversion points
in 194(5.
If figures mean anything, Stanford's line should push Michi
gan all over the field tomorrow. The Indians outweigh the Wol
verines 25 pounds per man!
With a speedy backfield behind it, Michigan's line depends
upon trap plays on opposing guards and tackles and check blocks

to open holes for Messrs. Chappuis,
Derricotte, and Elliot. If—and that's
a BIG if the Farm line can out
charge and out-think the Wolver
ine forwards, they may put the stop
per' on the highly touted pre-season
"Rose Bowl champs."
From end to end the only thing
encouraging to Stanford hopes is the
Jack of weight in the Ann Arbor
offensive line. Ed "Scottie" Mc-
Neill, a 188-pounder, holds down
left end. He is described by Michi
gan newsmen as "the cool, deter
mined type, at. his best in the
clutch" "Pinky" Phleger (215), In
dian light tackle, scraps with him

when Stanford is on defense.
MANN GREAT RECEIVER
Whit Budge (220) should be in
for a pleasant afternoon opposing
Michigan right end Bob Mann (lt>s).
This 55 - pound weight difference
should put Budge in the middle of
Wolverine interference all after
noon. Mann, a trackman, is prin
cipally an offensive end. Described
as a great pass catcher, he scored
five times for the Wolverines last
season and gained 285 yards from
scrimmage in that role.
Picked by most of the Eastern
scribes for All-American honors is
left tackle, Captain Bruce Hilkene
(190). Shifted from end after his
freshman year, Hilkene stood out
in the 1942 Notre Dame game and
has been improving ever since.
