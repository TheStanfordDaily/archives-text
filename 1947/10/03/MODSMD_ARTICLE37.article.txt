# Peerless Pickers Favor Michigan, California, USC
## 
### 
The Daily sports writers, all self
j appointed experts as far as prognos-
I tication is concerned, have come to
i (he following conclusions regarding
the top football games all over the
J country (his weekend:
STANFORD - MICHIGAN: Not
i even one of the seven staff members
; was willing to predict an Indian
victory. Scores ranged all the way
j from a relatively close 26 to 10
| bulge in favor of the Wolverines to
| a 46 to 7 shellacking.
Consensus: Michigan by 24 points.
WASHINGTON-OSC—Two writ
ers tabbed Oregon State by a tight,
one-touchdown margin. The other
five gave the nod to the Huskies.
Consensus: Washington by 6
points.
IDAHO-WSC: Despite the Van
dals' upset victory over Stanford
last week, only one Daily "expert"
picked them to continue their win
ning ways against Washington State.
Consensus: WSC by 3 points.
CAL-ST. MARY'S: Staff members
have a new-found healthy respect
for the Bears this year. Cal's revi
talized eleven is made a unanimous
choice over the Gaels.
Consensus: California by 15 points.
UCLA - NORTHWESTERN: Here
again the decision was unanimous.
UCLA is definitely viewing every
Big Nine team with a jaundiced
eye. The Bruins will not soon forget
their humiliating defeat at the hands
of Illinois in the Rose Bowl last year,
and they are out for sweet, sweet
revenge.
Consensus: UCLA by 18 points.
USC-RICE: This one was close.
The Trojans looked unimpressive in
their victorious outing against Wash
ington State last week, and Rice was
reported sharp in losing to highly
rated LSU by one touchdown.
Consensus: USC by 2 points.
ARMY - COLORADO: Davis-less,
Blanchard-less Army is not the
power-house it was last year. How
ever, West Point is unanimously
rated too strong for Colorado.
Consensus: Army by 18 points.
NAVY - COLUMBIA: Four staff
members side with Columbia. One
predicts a tie. The other two pick
the Midshipmen.
Consensus: Columbia by 4 points.
NOTRE DAME - PITTSBURGH:
00-00-00, this one is rough. The
Irish are picked to score in the 30's
and 40's, while poor old Pitt is not
even given a chance to break into the
scoring column, except by one ven
turesome writer who gave them a
confidence vote of 6 points.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 39
points.

Consensus: Michigan by 24 points.
WASHINGTON-OSC—Two writ

one-touchdown margin. The other
five gave the nod to the Huskies.
Consensus: Washington by 6
points.
IDAHO-WSC: Despite the Van
dals' upset victory over Stanford
last week, only one Daily "expert"
picked them to continue their win
ning ways against Washington State.
Consensus: WSC by 3 points.
CAL-ST. MARY'S: Staff members
have a new-found healthy respect
for the Bears this year. Cal's revi
talized eleven is made a unanimous
choice over the Gaels.
Consensus: California by 15 points.
UCLA - NORTHWESTERN: Here
again the decision was unanimous.
UCLA is definitely viewing every
Big Nine team with a jaundiced
eye. The Bruins will not soon forget
their humiliating defeat at the hands
of Illinois in the Rose Bowl last year,
and they are out for sweet, sweet
revenge.
Consensus: UCLA by 18 points.
USC-RICE: This one was close.
The Trojans looked unimpressive in
their victorious outing against Wash
ington State last week, and Rice was
reported sharp in losing to highly
rated LSU by one touchdown.
Consensus: USC by 2 points.
ARMY - COLORADO: Davis-less,
Blanchard-less Army is not the
power-house it was last year. How
ever, West Point is unanimously
rated too strong for Colorado.
Consensus: Army by 18 points.
NAVY - COLUMBIA: Four staff
members side with Columbia. One
predicts a tie. The other two pick
the Midshipmen.
Consensus: Columbia by 4 points.
NOTRE DAME - PITTSBURGH:
00-00-00, this one is rough. The
Irish are picked to score in the 30's
and 40's, while poor old Pitt is not
even given a chance to break into the
scoring column, except by one ven
turesome writer who gave them a
confidence vote of 6 points.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 39
