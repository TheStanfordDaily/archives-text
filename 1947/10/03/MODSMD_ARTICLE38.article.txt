# Blood Flows Like Wine; Indians: 09 Michigan: 49 Rose Bowl Game, 1902
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Though they are safely within the confines of teeming Ann
Arbor, the Stanford Cards may well be thinking of another
Michigan encounter some 549 months ago.
We speak of the first Rose Bowl game of New Year's Day in
1902.
No Bill Stern to bleat out good tidings of a stirring conflict,

no Movietone cameraman to grind
out mementoes on celluloid —just a
hard-fought, bristling setto which
found Michigan on the long end of
a 49 to 0 count.
A look at the files, yellowish and
dog-eared by the passage of time,
indicates the ferocity of the game
as played by the visiting mercen
aries of Fielding "Hurry Up" Yost.
The Daily quill specialist of that
era wrote of the fray:
STANFORD SURPRISES
"The Stanford men went into the
game with a vim and snap that al
most nonplussed their opponents,
who were surprised at the way these
Westerners played.
"The gravity of the situation was
soon appreciated by their little
quarter, who began to incite his men
with cries of: 'Dig in, there, we
haven't a snap.'
"Yost frantically paced the side
lines. In his excitement he broke
several canes, and once attempted to
officiate as line-man.
"When he grapped the rod from
Phil Wilson's hand, however, with
the explanation, 'Put this here,' he
received a cuff in the back of the
neck from Phil's strong right arm
that put a check to his enthusiasm."
Recalling the florid account a San
Francisco school teacher once gave
of Wolverine Halfback Willie Hes
ton, one can visualize that "Heston
was a bull in a china shop."
MICHIGAN GAINS 1,463
Heston would stand crouched di
rectly behind center, arms out
stretched awaiting the passback from
center. Then he would grasp the
ball, slap it to his chest and, with
arms held close to his jersey, Heston
would chop his way through the
Stanford line.
The San Francisco Chronicle, in its
edition the next day, printed the
following:
"The first half took an hour and
eight minutes instead of the usual
thirty-five.
"During the entire game, Michigan
advanced the ball a total of 1,463
yards while Stanford could gain but
960 yards.
"Michigan was penalized two
times, forfeiting a total of 20 yards
for an offside play. Stanford was
penalized once, losing 15 yards for
interfering with a free catch."
The scribes also pointed out that
the Michigan men were 20 minutes
late for the game and in the hot
sun "every man was keyed to a
pitch."
In the Stanford dressing room after
the onslaught, Frank Slaker, who
tutored the Indian team, was wont
to remark:
LEG BROKEN, PLAYS ON
"Roosevelt (Stanford guard) is the
nerviest man to ever don a football
uniform. He had his leg fractured
on the sixth down and continued to
play for 15 minutes while in that
condition.
"With the ball on the one-foot
line, he not only successfully blocked
two plays aimed at him, but he
forced them back, and only con
sented to leave the game when he
lay in a heap with two broken ribs."
Card Captain Ralph Fisher, back
on campus a week later, said: "All
our men went into the game with a
grim determination to fight until
carried off the field."
Headlines of the day sported such
colossal markings as: Michigan Ran
Up a Big Score," "Marvelous Grit
Shown By Injured Players," and
"But the Stanford Men Made a Mag
nificent Fight."
Eight thousand of the curious en
circled the playing field that lay
near an arroyo, for this was the clay
of days, the spawning of an era of
big time athletics.
Tomorrow —both teams meet again.
And only the wiseman of the Sier
ra Madres can furnish an answer to
a game that, back in 1902, became
the daddy of bowl games.
"It's Stanford and Michigan to
morrow," but the wiseman will say
no more.
