# 'Fireman' Casey Twirls Win As Dodgers Bump Yanks, 9-8
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 2 (UP).—Portly
Hugh Casey, fireman first class of
the Brooklyn Dodgers, trudged out
from the bull pen today to still the
thundering bats of the New York
Yankees and give the battling Bums
their first victory, 9 to 8, in the
third game of the world series.
With the Dodgers, humbled in the
first two games, striving to get up
off the floor and the hard-hitting
Yankees coming up hard from be
hind, the beefy Georgia tosser
strolled out of the rightfield shadows
and after six years balanced the
scales with fate.
For back in 1941 it was this same
Casey against these same Yankees
and they said he threw a spitball
which danced away from catcher
Mickey Owen and shattered Dodger
dreams of a world championship.
But this time, in a bitter, gruelling
game fought through three hours
and five minutes—longest nine-in
ning tilt in series history—Casey
wasn't to be denied.
They brought him to the mound
with one away in the seventh and the
Yankees only one run behind.
Chunky Yogi Berra had just slam
med the first pinch-hit homer in
series history off Ralph Branca and
the Bronx Bombers were red hot.
But the courageous Casey stop

ped them cold before a roaring
Brooklyn crowd of 33,098.
Casey's control slipped a bit in the
eighth as he walked the dangerous
Tommy Henrich. And it appeared
that once again fortune was ready Jo
laugh at him when Johnny Lindell
smashed a single to center.
But the crafty Casey fed a twist
ing double play ball to the menac
ing Joe DiMaggio and then forced
the veteran George McQuinn to
ground out. In the ninth he put
them clown in order—and six years
from that dark day which cost the
Dodgers a world championship back
in 1941, Casey had put them back
in the 1947 battle with new confi
dence and determination.
