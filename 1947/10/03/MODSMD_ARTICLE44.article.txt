# Freshman Gridders Will Open Season Against Santa Clara Eleven tomorrow
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Stanford's Freshman football
squad meets the Santa Clara Frosh
eleven tomorrow afternoon in spa
cious Stanford Stadium. The battle,
scheduled for 2:30, will bring toge
ther an untested, but potentially
brilliant Indian outfit against a rug
ged Bronco aggregation which al
ready has a game under its belt.
Football fans will be pleased to
learn that admission for the con
i test is free, and the 89,000 available
scats are expected to be entirely
adequate for the enthusiasts who
will file into the stadium tomorrow
afternoon. ,
The Indian papooses will employ
a T-formation attack, highlighted
by two very promising quarter
backs, Tom Shaw and Wayne Buck.
The return of stellar tackle Gordon
White, husky A ! l-Stater from Hous
ton, Texas, until yesterday on the
injured list, has further bolstered
the local squad.
BACKFIELD STRONG
Taylor wdl rely on the passing of
Shaw and Buck, the power running
of Gordon Mac Lachlan, and the open
field scampering of Boyd Benson to
bring victory to the frosh edition of
"Ihe Big Red Machine." John Banks,
a highly regarded end candidate
• rom Eugene, Oregon, recently shift
ed to the backfield, will start at the
right half position. The apt toe of
substitute fullback Ray Dodson will
be called upon for any necessary
punting.
Along the forward wall, Dick
Schul/.e and Tom August receive the
nod over a fine array of talent at
the end posts. Gordon White and
Walt. Watters furnish weight and
strength at the tackles. Don Lucas
and Harry Hunt will handle most
of the guard duties, while Dick
Abraham stands out at the center
spot.
BRONCOS USE T'
Jack Roache's Santa Clara charges
also feature the "T" as their offens
ive weapon. With Len Napolitano,
passing sensation from Oakland, in
the driver's seat, and Bernie Vogel,
powerful and versatile running ace
operating from left half, the Bron
cos should give the local yearlings
a difficult afternoon.
Drawing a comparison of the two
squads, we find the visitors holding
a slight weight advantage in both
the line and the backfield. Their
forward wall, averaging 200 pounds,
should prove tough to crack. Oppos
ing Vogel and company, Stanford
should exhibit considerable strength
at the ends, tackles, and at quar
terback. Tomorrow's battle of the
"T's", pitting untested Stanford
against rugged Santa Clara, promises
to provide plenty of thrills

Abraham stands out at the center
spot.
BRONCOS USE T'
Jack Roache's Santa Clara charges
also feature the "T" as their offens
ive weapon. With Len Napolitano,
passing sensation from Oakland, in
the driver's seat, and Bernie Vogel,
powerful and versatile running ace
operating from left half, the Bron
cos should give the local yearlings
a difficult afternoon.
Drawing a comparison of the two
squads, we find the visitors holding
a slight weight advantage in both
the line and the backfield. Their
forward wall, averaging 200 pounds,
should prove tough to crack. Oppos
ing Vogel and company, Stanford
should exhibit considerable strength
at the ends, tackles, and at quar
terback. Tomorrow's battle of the
"T's", pitting untested Stanford
against rugged Santa Clara, promises
to provide plenty of thrills
Stanford's Freshman football
squad meets the Santa Clara Frosh
eleven tomorrow afternoon in spa
cious Stanford Stadium. The battle,
scheduled for 2:30, will bring toge
ther an untested, but potentially
brilliant Indian outfit against a rug
ged Bronco aggregation which al
ready has a game under its belt.
Football fans will be pleased to
learn that admission for the con
i test is free, and the 89,000 available
scats are expected to be entirely
adequate for the enthusiasts who
will file into the stadium tomorrow
afternoon. ,
The Indian papooses will employ
a T-formation attack, highlighted
by two very promising quarter
backs, Tom Shaw and Wayne Buck.
The return of stellar tackle Gordon
White, husky A ! l-Stater from Hous
ton, Texas, until yesterday on the
injured list, has further bolstered
the local squad.
BACKFIELD STRONG
Taylor wdl rely on the passing of
Shaw and Buck, the power running
of Gordon Mac Lachlan, and the open
field scampering of Boyd Benson to
bring victory to the frosh edition of
"Ihe Big Red Machine." John Banks,
a highly regarded end candidate
• rom Eugene, Oregon, recently shift
ed to the backfield, will start at the
right half position. The apt toe of
substitute fullback Ray Dodson will
be called upon for any necessary
punting.
Along the forward wall, Dick
Schul/.e and Tom August receive the
nod over a fine array of talent at
the end posts. Gordon White and
Walt. Watters furnish weight and
strength at the tackles. Don Lucas
and Harry Hunt will handle most
of the guard duties, while Dick
Abraham stands out at the center
spot.
