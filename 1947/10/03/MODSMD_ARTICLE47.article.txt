MORAGA, Oct. 2 (UP).—St. Ma
ry's Galloping Gaels ran through
their "most impressive" football
scrimmage of the season today and
Coach Jimmy Fhelan said he
thought his club was primed for an
upset over California Saturday.
"They look much better," Phelan

said. "So good that I now think 13
points favoring California is entirely
out of line. California may win, but

be by 13 points. In fact, I think we
are capable of an upset."
