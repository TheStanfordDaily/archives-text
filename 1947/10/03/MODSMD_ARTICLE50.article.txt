# Daily Tryouts Today
## 
### 
An estimated 35 to 50 tryoutees will sign up
for The Daily staff this afternoon.
Unlike many non-athletic campus groups,
The Daily has always been a popular extra
curricular activity.
Every opportunity is taken to publicize the
tryoutee program. Any one who shows suf
ficient interest in The Daily during the tryout
period is placed on the staff.
This policy insures competition for each
staff position and gives everyone an oppor
tunity to demonstrate his ability.
The tryoutee joining The Daily staff as a
cub reporter will find nearly 20 positions on
the editorial side alone to which he may ad
vance.
In a direct line between the editor and the
cub reporter there are five separate positions
â€”reporter, copyreader, United Press editor,
head copy editor, night editor, and associate
editor.
Promotions on The Daily are made on a
merit basis. At least one written report is
turned in on ail but the top staff members each
week.

The Daily is one of the few college papers
which regularly prints the names of all staff
members in the masthead. Daily policy is to
use bylines on outstanding stories or features.
Transfer students joining the staff are on
an equal basis with the others. The present
editor and many of the top editorial staff mem
bers are transfer students.
The Daily has opportunities for both men
and women. The managing editor, an associ
ate editor, and many of the present night edit
ors are women.
The Daily is completely student-controlled.
The final decision as to what appears in the
paper is made by the student editor. No copy
reading is done by either faculty or adminis
tration officials.
Most of the tryoutees who will come to The
Daily Shack today possess outstanding high
school or junior college journalism records.
All are interested in the opportunities The
Daily has to offer.
It is these tryoutees who will maintain the
prestige of The Daily in the next few years.
