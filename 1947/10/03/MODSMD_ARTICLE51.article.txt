# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL MUNK 
Notwithstanding frequent comments heard about
campus yesterday, Bull Session is still minding other
people's business. Today's trouble centers about the
deplorable condition iti front of the Cellar and the
Union. It used to be a pleasure and a necessary evil
to gulp some coffee early in the morn. The better
half of our students would never see the light of day

till late in the
afternoon if that
java stand wer
en't so conveni
ently located be
tween bed and
that 8 o'clock!
And now
there's trouble.

Evil spirits flit about your coffee and make life un
bearable. The situation is getting out of hand, and
something is going to have to be done about it, but
fast! Will somebody PLEASE tell me how to spit
a bee out of my mouth without losing the coffee!
Those damn beasts have no respect for human rights.
They swim in the coffee, they sample the sugar, and
they're obnoxious, to say the least.
Does anyone know a cure? The biology dept. has
no competent authority on how to sterilize bees, and
beating them off by hand is tiresome and occasionally
painful. The only student who seemed unperturbed
by the problem of beating them away was a soph

coed who gathered experience in that line during her
last year at Stanford. Yea, the lady with 29 palms!
And that's not all. What used to be the ideal spot
for rising young lovers to gaze into each other's eyes
and fondly exchange soulfull looks has become—
well, you know. After all, how can you concentrate
on getting a date for Saturday when every female
approached jumps up when you get near her. The
bees, so they say.
But in all seriousness, there'll have to be a stop
to this. Either the freshman who brought the bees
from home because he was lonely will have to write
home and tell them to recall the squad, or I'm going
to start spraying bee poison around the cellar—and
that might not suit some of the queens.
And talking of queens, another way to attack
this propagation problem requires all your help.
Every bee you run across should be interrogated
closely, and the queens of the flock eliminated.
Incidentally, you can identify the female of the spe
cies easily: they buzz a lot, have sticky fingers, and
always come back for more.
Even though the male bee quite obviously is the
indispensable sex of this genus (hie), elimination of
the femme bee would by biological necessity end this
terrible plight, and make life more peaceful.

Free plug of the week: Not that any of you
really care, but the Oasis is now serving tap beer.
Also they have no bees.
