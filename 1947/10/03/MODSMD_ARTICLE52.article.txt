Palestine and its future is one of the many head
aches troubling the divided United Nations. The
present session of the U.N. General Assembly has
got to solve this intricate problem by December.
The rivalry between Arabs and Jews came into the
U.N. first when Britain introduced the problem be
fore a special session of U.N. last summer. A special
committee of small nations was formed at that time
to study the situation first hand and report the mat
ter to the present session of the Assembly.
The United Nations Special Committee on Pales
tine issued its recommendations and conclusions on
September 1. The committee presented two reports;
a majority and a minority report. On the whole the
work of the committee was characterized by a fair
and intelligent consideration of the problem. Both
the reports will be considered by the Assembly in the
immediate future and on its decision may depend the
future of a very important area of the world.
All the members of the committee were agreed on
the provisions for the end of the British mandate,
freedom for Arabs and the Jews, and the need of
economic unity for the whole of Palestine.
The majority plan (the representatives of Can
ada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, the Netherlands,
Peru, Sweden, and Uruguay) provides for the div
ision of Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state,
and the city of Jerusalem with a provision that
150,000 Jewish immigrants shall be admitted in Pal
estine immediately at a uniform monthly rate. After
the two states are fully established, the immigration
in the Jewish state will be governed entirely by its
government. A treaty shall be entered into by the
two states to establish the economic union which will
cover railways, interstate highways, postals, tele
phone and telegraphic services, ports of Haifa and
Jaffa, and irrigation. The city Y>f Jerusalem shall be
a neutral city. Each of the Arab and Jewish states
will have three sections linked by two points of inter
section. The Jewish state will consist of nearly 60
per cent area of the present Palestine.
The minority plan advocated by India, Iran, and
Yugoslavia provides for the establishment of a fed
eral state comprising an Arab state and a Jewish state
with Jerusalem as capital. The federal government
will consist of a two-chamber legislative assembly.
In one chamber Arabs and Jews will have equal
representation and in the other there will be propor
tional representation of the population. Legislation
shall be enacted by majority in both houses. Full
authority shall be vested in federal government with
regard to national defense, foreign relations, immi

gration, currency, federal taxes, and communication.
For a period of three years Jewish immigration shall
be permitted into the Jewish state in such numbers
as not to exceed its absorption capacity and having
due regard for the rights of the existing population.
An international commission composed of three
Arabs, three Jews, and three U.N. representatives
shall estimate the absorptive capacity of the Jewish
state.
Both of the plans provide for representative gov
ernment, religious freedom and guarantee of minority
rights.
The committee report has been well received by
the Zionist leaders as both of their main demands
namely Jewish State and immediate immigration
have been granted. They support the majority plan
which has the backing of many U.S. political leaders
too. Arabs of Palestine and other Arab states have
denounced both the plans vehemently. They have
threatened the use of violent methods in Palestine if
U.N. agrees to any of these plans. They demand the
immediate withdrawal of the British from Palestine
which will give them a 2 to 1 majority over Jews.
This has put the two major powers, U.S. and the
Soviet Union, in a dilemma. U.S. is wedded to Jew
ish support but it can not be very hostile to the Arab
states due to their oil and strategic position. It will
probably support the majority, but how at the same
time it will remain friendly with the Arab states is
anybody's guess.
Soviet Union will probably support the minority
plan as it is the best possible compromise between
Arab and Jewish demands.
United Nations will have to judge the problem on
its humanitarian as well as practical merits. Though
there is doubt about the need of Jews for a safe
and permanent country, it is also obvious that Pales
tine can take care of a very small percentage of dis
placed and European Jews. Jews and the world
must look for a wider solution of the problem. From
the practical angle one can see that it is nearly im
possible to form a government in Palestine towards
'which Arabs will be hostile. Moreover, a nearly
complete negligence of the rights of the present
majority population of Palestine doesn't seem to be
very democratic to me. In my opinion a consideration
of the problem along the lines of the minority plan
can provide a peaceful solution of the Palestine riddle.
Any actual division of Palestine is bound to be re
sisted by Arabs and will probably result in a violent
conflict. The world is already having too many such
conflicts.

United Nations will have to judge the problem on
its humanitarian as well as practical merits. Though
there is doubt about the need of Jews for a safe
and permanent country, it is also obvious that Pales
tine can take care of a very small percentage of dis
placed and European Jews. Jews and the world
must look for a wider solution of the problem. From
the practical angle one can see that it is nearly im
possible to form a government in Palestine towards
'which Arabs will be hostile. Moreover, a nearly
complete negligence of the rights of the present
majority population of Palestine doesn't seem to be
very democratic to me. In my opinion a consideration
of the problem along the lines of the minority plan
can provide a peaceful solution of the Palestine riddle.
Any actual division of Palestine is bound to be re
sisted by Arabs and will probably result in a violent
conflict. The world is already having too many such
conflicts.
Palestine and its future is one of the many head
aches troubling the divided United Nations. The
present session of the U.N. General Assembly has
got to solve this intricate problem by December.
The rivalry between Arabs and Jews came into the
U.N. first when Britain introduced the problem be
fore a special session of U.N. last summer. A special
committee of small nations was formed at that time
to study the situation first hand and report the mat
ter to the present session of the Assembly.
The United Nations Special Committee on Pales
tine issued its recommendations and conclusions on
September 1. The committee presented two reports;
a majority and a minority report. On the whole the
work of the committee was characterized by a fair
and intelligent consideration of the problem. Both
the reports will be considered by the Assembly in the
immediate future and on its decision may depend the
future of a very important area of the world.
All the members of the committee were agreed on
the provisions for the end of the British mandate,
freedom for Arabs and the Jews, and the need of
economic unity for the whole of Palestine.
The majority plan (the representatives of Can
ada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, the Netherlands,
Peru, Sweden, and Uruguay) provides for the div
ision of Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state,
and the city of Jerusalem with a provision that
150,000 Jewish immigrants shall be admitted in Pal
estine immediately at a uniform monthly rate. After
the two states are fully established, the immigration
in the Jewish state will be governed entirely by its
government. A treaty shall be entered into by the
two states to establish the economic union which will
cover railways, interstate highways, postals, tele
phone and telegraphic services, ports of Haifa and
Jaffa, and irrigation. The city Y>f Jerusalem shall be
a neutral city. Each of the Arab and Jewish states
will have three sections linked by two points of inter
section. The Jewish state will consist of nearly 60
per cent area of the present Palestine.
The minority plan advocated by India, Iran, and
Yugoslavia provides for the establishment of a fed
eral state comprising an Arab state and a Jewish state
with Jerusalem as capital. The federal government
will consist of a two-chamber legislative assembly.
In one chamber Arabs and Jews will have equal
representation and in the other there will be propor
tional representation of the population. Legislation
shall be enacted by majority in both houses. Full
authority shall be vested in federal government with
regard to national defense, foreign relations, immi

gration, currency, federal taxes, and communication.
For a period of three years Jewish immigration shall
be permitted into the Jewish state in such numbers
as not to exceed its absorption capacity and having
due regard for the rights of the existing population.
An international commission composed of three
Arabs, three Jews, and three U.N. representatives
shall estimate the absorptive capacity of the Jewish
state.
Both of the plans provide for representative gov
ernment, religious freedom and guarantee of minority
rights.
The committee report has been well received by
the Zionist leaders as both of their main demands
namely Jewish State and immediate immigration
have been granted. They support the majority plan
which has the backing of many U.S. political leaders
too. Arabs of Palestine and other Arab states have
denounced both the plans vehemently. They have
threatened the use of violent methods in Palestine if
U.N. agrees to any of these plans. They demand the
immediate withdrawal of the British from Palestine
which will give them a 2 to 1 majority over Jews.
This has put the two major powers, U.S. and the
Soviet Union, in a dilemma. U.S. is wedded to Jew
ish support but it can not be very hostile to the Arab
states due to their oil and strategic position. It will
probably support the majority, but how at the same
time it will remain friendly with the Arab states is
anybody's guess.
Soviet Union will probably support the minority
plan as it is the best possible compromise between
Arab and Jewish demands.

have been granted. They support the majority plan
which has the backing of many U.S. political leaders
too. Arabs of Palestine and other Arab states have
denounced both the plans vehemently. They have
threatened the use of violent methods in Palestine if
U.N. agrees to any of these plans. They demand the
immediate withdrawal of the British from Palestine
which will give them a 2 to 1 majority over Jews.
This has put the two major powers, U.S. and the
Soviet Union, in a dilemma. U.S. is wedded to Jew
ish support but it can not be very hostile to the Arab
states due to their oil and strategic position. It will
probably support the majority, but how at the same
time it will remain friendly with the Arab states is
anybody's guess.
Soviet Union will probably support the minority
plan as it is the best possible compromise between
Arab and Jewish demands.
United Nations will have to judge the problem on
its humanitarian as well as practical merits. Though
there is doubt about the need of Jews for a safe
and permanent country, it is also obvious that Pales
tine can take care of a very small percentage of dis
placed and European Jews. Jews and the world
must look for a wider solution of the problem. From
the practical angle one can see that it is nearly im
possible to form a government in Palestine towards
'which Arabs will be hostile. Moreover, a nearly
complete negligence of the rights of the present
majority population of Palestine doesn't seem to be
very democratic to me. In my opinion a consideration
of the problem along the lines of the minority plan
can provide a peaceful solution of the Palestine riddle.
Any actual division of Palestine is bound to be re
sisted by Arabs and will probably result in a violent
conflict. The world is already having too many such
conflicts.
Palestine and its future is one of the many head
aches troubling the divided United Nations. The
present session of the U.N. General Assembly has
got to solve this intricate problem by December.
The rivalry between Arabs and Jews came into the
U.N. first when Britain introduced the problem be
fore a special session of U.N. last summer. A special
committee of small nations was formed at that time
to study the situation first hand and report the mat
ter to the present session of the Assembly.
The United Nations Special Committee on Pales
tine issued its recommendations and conclusions on
September 1. The committee presented two reports;
a majority and a minority report. On the whole the
work of the committee was characterized by a fair
and intelligent consideration of the problem. Both
the reports will be considered by the Assembly in the
immediate future and on its decision may depend the
future of a very important area of the world.
All the members of the committee were agreed on
the provisions for the end of the British mandate,
freedom for Arabs and the Jews, and the need of
economic unity for the whole of Palestine.
The majority plan (the representatives of Can
ada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, the Netherlands,
Peru, Sweden, and Uruguay) provides for the div
ision of Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state,
and the city of Jerusalem with a provision that
150,000 Jewish immigrants shall be admitted in Pal
estine immediately at a uniform monthly rate. After
the two states are fully established, the immigration
in the Jewish state will be governed entirely by its
government. A treaty shall be entered into by the
two states to establish the economic union which will
cover railways, interstate highways, postals, tele
phone and telegraphic services, ports of Haifa and
Jaffa, and irrigation. The city Y>f Jerusalem shall be
a neutral city. Each of the Arab and Jewish states
will have three sections linked by two points of inter
section. The Jewish state will consist of nearly 60
per cent area of the present Palestine.
The minority plan advocated by India, Iran, and
Yugoslavia provides for the establishment of a fed
eral state comprising an Arab state and a Jewish state
with Jerusalem as capital. The federal government
will consist of a two-chamber legislative assembly.
In one chamber Arabs and Jews will have equal
representation and in the other there will be propor
tional representation of the population. Legislation
shall be enacted by majority in both houses. Full
authority shall be vested in federal government with
regard to national defense, foreign relations, immi

gration, currency, federal taxes, and communication.
For a period of three years Jewish immigration shall
be permitted into the Jewish state in such numbers
as not to exceed its absorption capacity and having
due regard for the rights of the existing population.
An international commission composed of three
Arabs, three Jews, and three U.N. representatives
shall estimate the absorptive capacity of the Jewish
state.
Both of the plans provide for representative gov
ernment, religious freedom and guarantee of minority
rights.
The committee report has been well received by
the Zionist leaders as both of their main demands
namely Jewish State and immediate immigration
have been granted. They support the majority plan
