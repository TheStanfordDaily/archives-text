# Average Age Drops for 1947 Frosh; Levis Replace Khakis as Quad Clothes
## 
### RUTH DIMICK 
Not all the Kiddie-Kars on campus
these days belong to the vet's little
brats. Most of them now are ridden
by peach cheeked members of the
Class of '51.
Reports show that the average age
of entering freshmen has dropped
from the 22 years (5 months of 1946
to a little better than 18 this fall.
More than 95 percent of the entering
men are non-vets, graduated from
high school in '46 or '47.
The effects of this change are
noticeable on every corner of the
campus. Men's quad fashions have
been profoundly affected, with
khakis and sun tans conspicuously
missing among the new members.
The well dressed frosh appears in
cords or jeans.
It has also been rumored around
the Farm that every freshman has
his full crop of hair, and that peach
fuzz is much more common than
actual whiskers at Encina.
Even the conversation overheard

at the Pre-Reg Jolly Up had a new
ring. Amorous lads impressed the
Indian maids with glowing accounts
of the big moments on the high
school gridiron instead of using the
usual "there I was flat on my back
at 30,000 feet."
But the change isn't peculiar to
Stanford alone. UCLA, for example,
rports that for the first time since
pre-war days, frosh caps are now
required of all new men. Its the
first time in years sophomores have
felt capable of enforcing this rule.
At present there is as great an age
range as has ever been found in the
Stanford family. In marked contrast
the vet who has home and economic
worries to wrinkle his brow, the
carefree frosh is eager to throw him
self completely into the swing of
campus life.
His enthusiasm was evident at the
football train rally, where the rooter
capped heads of the Encinaites dot
ted the crowd and during the Pre-
Reg activitise in which he entered
whole-heartedly.
The frosh say he belongs to the
Kiddie-Kar Class of '51 and mean
it. He does not need to worry about
what class those 6 Army units and
the half semester credit he got be

fore he entered the service place
him. He plens to take his college
in four slraight uninterrupted years.
How is the campus taking the
change? The average upper class
girl answered with a wistful look in
her eye, remembering days gone
forever when the campus thronged
with incoming vets. However, most
girls admitted that, despite the
young age, there were definitely
some promising possibilities among
the new men. And how could she
be too downcast with a 3 to 1 ratio
still in her favor.
When questioned on the new cam
pus females, most Farm males agreed
that the change had not affected the
new women to such a degree.
Don't overlok the power of these
frosh, caution those in the know.
There's many a handsome six footer
that could put an ex-Marine to
shame. They've done things too.
Sponsor Carl Burke reports seven
ex-high school presidents in his
corridor plus a generous sprinkling
of athlctic team captains.
Great things are expected from the
new Farm blood as are a good many
new ideas that the older members
of the Staniord family would do well
to observe.
