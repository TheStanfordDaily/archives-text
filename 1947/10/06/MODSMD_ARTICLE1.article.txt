# Farrer Reports On Europe Trip

### BILL FARRER 
(This is (he first of a series of articles by IJill Farrer and Lawrence
Grannis, reporting their ISC sponsored European trip this summer.)

"Truman, a small town haberdasher, is a product of American Po
litical Bosses," said an American delegate to the World Youth Festival to a
young Czech student who was trying to defend United States policy. This
remark v/as typical of discussions I heard during gatherings at festival
headquarters at the Sokolovna Hall in Prague. All in all I found myself

more than slightly disgusted by the
whole thing.
The American picture was pre
sented by a group of young red-hots
who were no more representative of
American student life than the
American Youth for Democracy is
typical of Stanford. Unfortunately,
the more normal student who came
to Prague with his eyes wide open
just looked in and found the whole
structure rampant with politics ... so
lie did the typical American thing
. . . withdrew from all discussions
where he had to think and continued
on a mcrry-go-round of sightseeing
and socializing.
"M!ssi:d the boat''
The fervor and intense interest
and participation in everything by
the Yugoslavs, the Bulgars, and the
Albanians was in striking contrast
to the handful of Americans who
held out their nation as a decadent
one i un by a monopolistic press and
whose autocratic State department
had denied them participation in the
Festival. The exhibitions, song,
dance, and athletic teams were fully
participated in by nearly all Euro
pean nations and particularly the
Balkan states.
With thousands present from "be
hind the iron curtain" the United
States had an invaluable opportunity
to beat the USSR at its own propa
ganda game . . . but we missed the
boat from the word "go." The
friendly attitude of inquiry that
many of those from the east had
toward the United States was soon
changed, as all they saw was the
poorest possible representation of
American life. They found the ma
jor problems to be American imper
ialism, capitalism and intolerance . . .
with the emphasis on racial discrim
ination.
TITOVA COLLEGE
Although the World Youth Festi
val got all the publicity and the play
in the press, I believe a far more
important organization, the Inter
national Union of Students, was con
currently holding well-guarded
meetings in Titova College with ad
mittance by membership card only.
Not being qualified to enter as an
American, I was invited to join the
Canadian delegation by George Rob
inson, from the University of New
Brunswick, president of the Can
adian University students.
The I.U.S. was born in August,
1!)4(>, in Prague and brought toge
ther .'SOO delegates of 43 countries
claiming to represent 2,500,000 stu
dents. Its purpose was to set up a
world-wide organization to combine
the student groups of all nations.
The first meeting was successful
from the standpoint of its organizers
and a second meeting was called for
at Prague, August 1 to 10 of 11)47.
Ilere were brought together about
120 representatives of 50 nations
claiming to represent 3,500,000 or
ganized students.
MOSCOW CONTROL
To the most casual observer it was
apparent that Soviet Russia has
taken the lead in this field. The in
spiration and domination of the
Prague Congress by Communist ele
ments, clearly observable to the ob
jective delegate or onlooker, stem
med from a well prepared prepara
tory commission that controlled the
show so that any attempt made to

Writes of European travels
object to the steam roller tactics
could easily be taken care of.
In the Hist place, the credentials
committee, recognizing just which
delegations were to represent which
nations, was wholly dominated by
Moscow. Two examples of their
actions should bear witness to this.
There were two contesting delega
tions from Austria. The Commun
istic Austrian Union of Democratic
students with 150 members was
given one vote, while the Oesterrei
chische Hoelschulschaft with 25,000
member students was given lour
votes. In another case, the repre
sentative of the Greek students, Ren
dis (whose father was an opposition
member in the present Greek parlia
ment) was not recognized, but in
stead an EPON (Greek revolution
ary student) delegate going to school
in Yugoslavia was held up as the
true representative of Greek stu
dents.
U.S. CONDEMNED
Second, the meeting was con
fined almost exclusively to political
discussions. The United States was
condemned by Cuba, China, and
Egypt for imperialism, and Britain,
France and the Dutch came in for
their share of pasting on colonial
ventures. Throughout the entire as
sembly the Soviet Union stood as
the great protector of the poor op
pressed minorities the world over,
and needless to say, there was no
criticism of any policy emanating
from Moscow during the 10-day
period. It may also be noted that
not once was the word "communism"
used; instead the "democratic" states

I were Rumania, Poland, Yugoslavia,
i Albania and, of course, a benevolent
U.S.S.R.
Members of the American delega
tion, while they officially represent
ed but small groups, as observers,
were looked on as official spokesmen
for American students. One repre
sented the AYD from Columbia Uni
versity; another was from the Youth
Builders on that campus; three were
from the Harvard Peace Council; but
the sole shining light was Sally
Cassidy of the National Federation of
Catholic college students from Co
lumbia University.
FINNISH COURAGE
On every possible occasion the
IUS was linked with the WFDY,
which ran the Youth Festival and
makes little bones about its place in
the Communist front. (Its president,
Guy de Boisson, is a French com
munist deputy.)
Finally, the smaller nations of
Western Europe and the Scandina
vian countries looked to the United
States for a leadership which did
not come. The Finnish delegation
1 had the courage to abstain on the
' railroaded motions, but most dele
-1 gations just fell in on the party line.
As a result, a number of western
nations have not seen fit to join the
organization. Canada decided against
it; Australia has given notice of
disaffiliation; the Dutch have not
1 recommended membership; the Bel
-1 gian student organization withdrew
the right of their delegate to partici
pate in the meetings; and the Swiss
delegate walked out after a tirade
on Swiss neutrality during the war

by the Soviet delegation.

I might note that in Prague, po- i
litical hay was made of the action
of the last Congress in regard to
wool imports from Australia (ve
toed by Truman) and the attitude
developed towards the sugar from
I Cuba.

and participation in everything by
the Yugoslavs, the Bulgars, and the
Albanians was in striking contrast
to the handful of Americans who
held out their nation as a decadent
one i un by a monopolistic press and
whose autocratic State department
had denied them participation in the
Festival. The exhibitions, song,
dance, and athletic teams were fully
participated in by nearly all Euro
pean nations and particularly the
Balkan states.
With thousands present from "be
hind the iron curtain" the United
States had an invaluable opportunity
to beat the USSR at its own propa
ganda game . . . but we missed the
boat from the word "go." The
friendly attitude of inquiry that
many of those from the east had
toward the United States was soon
changed, as all they saw was the
poorest possible representation of
American life. They found the ma
jor problems to be American imper
ialism, capitalism and intolerance . . .
with the emphasis on racial discrim
ination.
TITOVA COLLEGE
Although the World Youth Festi
val got all the publicity and the play
in the press, I believe a far more
important organization, the Inter
national Union of Students, was con
currently holding well-guarded
meetings in Titova College with ad
mittance by membership card only.
Not being qualified to enter as an
American, I was invited to join the
Canadian delegation by George Rob
inson, from the University of New
Brunswick, president of the Can
adian University students.
The I.U.S. was born in August,
1!)4(>, in Prague and brought toge
ther .'SOO delegates of 43 countries
claiming to represent 2,500,000 stu
dents. Its purpose was to set up a
world-wide organization to combine
the student groups of all nations.
The first meeting was successful
from the standpoint of its organizers
and a second meeting was called for
at Prague, August 1 to 10 of 11)47.
Ilere were brought together about
120 representatives of 50 nations
claiming to represent 3,500,000 or
ganized students.
MOSCOW CONTROL
To the most casual observer it was
apparent that Soviet Russia has
taken the lead in this field. The in
spiration and domination of the
Prague Congress by Communist ele
ments, clearly observable to the ob
jective delegate or onlooker, stem
med from a well prepared prepara
tory commission that controlled the
show so that any attempt made to

Writes of European travels
object to the steam roller tactics
could easily be taken care of.
In the Hist place, the credentials
committee, recognizing just which
delegations were to represent which
nations, was wholly dominated by
Moscow. Two examples of their
actions should bear witness to this.
There were two contesting delega
tions from Austria. The Commun
istic Austrian Union of Democratic
students with 150 members was
given one vote, while the Oesterrei
chische Hoelschulschaft with 25,000
member students was given lour
votes. In another case, the repre
sentative of the Greek students, Ren
dis (whose father was an opposition
member in the present Greek parlia
ment) was not recognized, but in
stead an EPON (Greek revolution
ary student) delegate going to school
in Yugoslavia was held up as the
true representative of Greek stu
dents.
U.S. CONDEMNED
Second, the meeting was con
fined almost exclusively to political
discussions. The United States was
condemned by Cuba, China, and
Egypt for imperialism, and Britain,
France and the Dutch came in for
their share of pasting on colonial
ventures. Throughout the entire as
sembly the Soviet Union stood as
the great protector of the poor op
pressed minorities the world over,
and needless to say, there was no
criticism of any policy emanating
from Moscow during the 10-day
period. It may also be noted that
not once was the word "communism"
used; instead the "democratic" states

I were Rumania, Poland, Yugoslavia,
i Albania and, of course, a benevolent
U.S.S.R.
Members of the American delega
tion, while they officially represent
ed but small groups, as observers,
were looked on as official spokesmen
for American students. One repre
sented the AYD from Columbia Uni
versity; another was from the Youth
Builders on that campus; three were
from the Harvard Peace Council; but
the sole shining light was Sally
Cassidy of the National Federation of
Catholic college students from Co
lumbia University.
FINNISH COURAGE
On every possible occasion the
IUS was linked with the WFDY,
which ran the Youth Festival and
makes little bones about its place in
the Communist front. (Its president,
Guy de Boisson, is a French com
munist deputy.)
Finally, the smaller nations of
Western Europe and the Scandina
vian countries looked to the United
States for a leadership which did
not come. The Finnish delegation
1 had the courage to abstain on the
' railroaded motions, but most dele
-1 gations just fell in on the party line.
As a result, a number of western
nations have not seen fit to join the
organization. Canada decided against
it; Australia has given notice of
disaffiliation; the Dutch have not
1 recommended membership; the Bel
-1 gian student organization withdrew
the right of their delegate to partici
pate in the meetings; and the Swiss
delegate walked out after a tirade
on Swiss neutrality during the war

by the Soviet delegation.

important organization, the Inter
national Union of Students, was con
currently holding well-guarded
meetings in Titova College with ad
mittance by membership card only.
Not being qualified to enter as an
American, I was invited to join the
Canadian delegation by George Rob
inson, from the University of New
Brunswick, president of the Can
adian University students.
The I.U.S. was born in August,
1!)4(>, in Prague and brought toge
ther .'SOO delegates of 43 countries
claiming to represent 2,500,000 stu
dents. Its purpose was to set up a
world-wide organization to combine
the student groups of all nations.
The first meeting was successful
from the standpoint of its organizers
and a second meeting was called for
at Prague, August 1 to 10 of 11)47.
Ilere were brought together about
120 representatives of 50 nations
claiming to represent 3,500,000 or
ganized students.
MOSCOW CONTROL
To the most casual observer it was
apparent that Soviet Russia has
taken the lead in this field. The in
spiration and domination of the
Prague Congress by Communist ele
ments, clearly observable to the ob
jective delegate or onlooker, stem
med from a well prepared prepara
tory commission that controlled the
show so that any attempt made to

Writes of European travels
object to the steam roller tactics
could easily be taken care of.
In the Hist place, the credentials
committee, recognizing just which
delegations were to represent which
nations, was wholly dominated by
Moscow. Two examples of their
actions should bear witness to this.
There were two contesting delega
tions from Austria. The Commun
istic Austrian Union of Democratic
students with 150 members was
given one vote, while the Oesterrei
chische Hoelschulschaft with 25,000
member students was given lour
votes. In another case, the repre
sentative of the Greek students, Ren
dis (whose father was an opposition
member in the present Greek parlia
ment) was not recognized, but in
stead an EPON (Greek revolution
ary student) delegate going to school
in Yugoslavia was held up as the
true representative of Greek stu
dents.
U.S. CONDEMNED
Second, the meeting was con
fined almost exclusively to political
discussions. The United States was
condemned by Cuba, China, and
Egypt for imperialism, and Britain,
France and the Dutch came in for
their share of pasting on colonial
ventures. Throughout the entire as
sembly the Soviet Union stood as
the great protector of the poor op
pressed minorities the world over,
and needless to say, there was no
criticism of any policy emanating
from Moscow during the 10-day
period. It may also be noted that
not once was the word "communism"
used; instead the "democratic" states

I were Rumania, Poland, Yugoslavia,
i Albania and, of course, a benevolent
U.S.S.R.
Members of the American delega
tion, while they officially represent
ed but small groups, as observers,
were looked on as official spokesmen
for American students. One repre
sented the AYD from Columbia Uni
versity; another was from the Youth
Builders on that campus; three were
from the Harvard Peace Council; but
the sole shining light was Sally
Cassidy of the National Federation of
Catholic college students from Co
lumbia University.
FINNISH COURAGE
On every possible occasion the
IUS was linked with the WFDY,
which ran the Youth Festival and
makes little bones about its place in
the Communist front. (Its president,
Guy de Boisson, is a French com
munist deputy.)
Finally, the smaller nations of
Western Europe and the Scandina
vian countries looked to the United
States for a leadership which did
not come. The Finnish delegation
1 had the courage to abstain on the
' railroaded motions, but most dele
-1 gations just fell in on the party line.
As a result, a number of western
nations have not seen fit to join the
organization. Canada decided against
it; Australia has given notice of
disaffiliation; the Dutch have not
1 recommended membership; the Bel
-1 gian student organization withdrew
the right of their delegate to partici
pate in the meetings; and the Swiss
delegate walked out after a tirade
on Swiss neutrality during the war

by the Soviet delegation.

I might note that in Prague, po- i
litical hay was made of the action
of the last Congress in regard to
wool imports from Australia (ve

developed towards the sugar from

(This is (he first of a series of articles by IJill Farrer and Lawrence
Grannis, reporting their ISC sponsored European trip this summer.)

"Truman, a small town haberdasher, is a product of American Po
litical Bosses," said an American delegate to the World Youth Festival to a
young Czech student who was trying to defend United States policy. This
remark v/as typical of discussions I heard during gatherings at festival
headquarters at the Sokolovna Hall in Prague. All in all I found myself

more than slightly disgusted by the
whole thing.
The American picture was pre
sented by a group of young red-hots
who were no more representative of
American student life than the
American Youth for Democracy is
typical of Stanford. Unfortunately,
the more normal student who came
to Prague with his eyes wide open
just looked in and found the whole
structure rampant with politics ... so
lie did the typical American thing
. . . withdrew from all discussions
where he had to think and continued
on a mcrry-go-round of sightseeing
and socializing.
"M!ssi:d the boat''
The fervor and intense interest
and participation in everything by
the Yugoslavs, the Bulgars, and the
Albanians was in striking contrast
to the handful of Americans who
held out their nation as a decadent
one i un by a monopolistic press and
whose autocratic State department
had denied them participation in the
Festival. The exhibitions, song,
dance, and athletic teams were fully
participated in by nearly all Euro
pean nations and particularly the
Balkan states.
With thousands present from "be
hind the iron curtain" the United
States had an invaluable opportunity
to beat the USSR at its own propa
ganda game . . . but we missed the
boat from the word "go." The
friendly attitude of inquiry that
many of those from the east had
toward the United States was soon
changed, as all they saw was the
poorest possible representation of
American life. They found the ma

with the emphasis on racial discrim

In the Hist place, the credentials
committee, recognizing just which
delegations were to represent which
nations, was wholly dominated by
Moscow. Two examples of their
actions should bear witness to this.
There were two contesting delega
tions from Austria. The Commun
istic Austrian Union of Democratic
students with 150 members was
given one vote, while the Oesterrei
chische Hoelschulschaft with 25,000
member students was given lour
votes. In another case, the repre
sentative of the Greek students, Ren
dis (whose father was an opposition
member in the present Greek parlia
ment) was not recognized, but in
stead an EPON (Greek revolution
ary student) delegate going to school
in Yugoslavia was held up as the
true representative of Greek stu
dents.
U.S. CONDEMNED
Second, the meeting was con
fined almost exclusively to political
discussions. The United States was
condemned by Cuba, China, and
Egypt for imperialism, and Britain,
France and the Dutch came in for
their share of pasting on colonial
ventures. Throughout the entire as
sembly the Soviet Union stood as
the great protector of the poor op
pressed minorities the world over,
and needless to say, there was no
criticism of any policy emanating
from Moscow during the 10-day
period. It may also be noted that
not once was the word "communism"
used; instead the "democratic" states

I were Rumania, Poland, Yugoslavia,
i Albania and, of course, a benevolent
U.S.S.R.
Members of the American delega
tion, while they officially represent
ed but small groups, as observers,
were looked on as official spokesmen
for American students. One repre
sented the AYD from Columbia Uni
versity; another was from the Youth
Builders on that campus; three were
from the Harvard Peace Council; but
the sole shining light was Sally
Cassidy of the National Federation of
Catholic college students from Co
lumbia University.
FINNISH COURAGE
On every possible occasion the
IUS was linked with the WFDY,
which ran the Youth Festival and
makes little bones about its place in
the Communist front. (Its president,
Guy de Boisson, is a French com
munist deputy.)
Finally, the smaller nations of
Western Europe and the Scandina
vian countries looked to the United
States for a leadership which did
not come. The Finnish delegation
1 had the courage to abstain on the
' railroaded motions, but most dele
-1 gations just fell in on the party line.
As a result, a number of western
nations have not seen fit to join the
organization. Canada decided against
it; Australia has given notice of
disaffiliation; the Dutch have not
1 recommended membership; the Bel
-1 gian student organization withdrew
the right of their delegate to partici
pate in the meetings; and the Swiss
delegate walked out after a tirade
on Swiss neutrality during the war

by the Soviet delegation.
GIVE tIP RIGHTS
Well, what can we do about it? |
We must take a more active interest
in student activities not only in our
own nation but in regard to their re
lation with students the world over.
It is just another case of America's )
not being able to adopt an isola
tionist attitude. At the present time
in student affairs the U.S.S.R. has
! taken the lead, but with the full
participation of the democratic na- |
tions of the world she cannot hold j
it. 1 actually feel that this might be
a method of preventing future con- |
(lict, for if we can learn to get along i
on a student basis, we should be
' able to yet along as nations. The
United States must stand ready to
give up some of its highly prized
rights for the benefit of the world
as a whole.
I might note that in Prague, po- i
litical hay was made of the action
of the last Congress in regard to
wool imports from Australia (ve
toed by Truman) and the attitude
developed towards the sugar from
I Cuba.
(This is (he first of a series of articles by IJill Farrer and Lawrence
Grannis, reporting their ISC sponsored European trip this summer.)

"Truman, a small town haberdasher, is a product of American Po
litical Bosses," said an American delegate to the World Youth Festival to a
young Czech student who was trying to defend United States policy. This
remark v/as typical of discussions I heard during gatherings at festival
headquarters at the Sokolovna Hall in Prague. All in all I found myself

more than slightly disgusted by the
whole thing.
The American picture was pre
sented by a group of young red-hots
who were no more representative of
American student life than the
American Youth for Democracy is
typical of Stanford. Unfortunately,
the more normal student who came
to Prague with his eyes wide open
just looked in and found the whole
structure rampant with politics ... so
lie did the typical American thing
. . . withdrew from all discussions
where he had to think and continued
on a mcrry-go-round of sightseeing
and socializing.
"M!ssi:d the boat''
The fervor and intense interest
and participation in everything by
the Yugoslavs, the Bulgars, and the
Albanians was in striking contrast
to the handful of Americans who
held out their nation as a decadent
one i un by a monopolistic press and
whose autocratic State department
had denied them participation in the
Festival. The exhibitions, song,
dance, and athletic teams were fully
participated in by nearly all Euro
pean nations and particularly the
Balkan states.
With thousands present from "be
hind the iron curtain" the United
States had an invaluable opportunity
to beat the USSR at its own propa
ganda game . . . but we missed the
boat from the word "go." The
friendly attitude of inquiry that
many of those from the east had
toward the United States was soon
changed, as all they saw was the
poorest possible representation of
American life. They found the ma
jor problems to be American imper
ialism, capitalism and intolerance . . .
with the emphasis on racial discrim
ination.
TITOVA COLLEGE
Although the World Youth Festi
val got all the publicity and the play
in the press, I believe a far more
important organization, the Inter
national Union of Students, was con
currently holding well-guarded
meetings in Titova College with ad
mittance by membership card only.
Not being qualified to enter as an
American, I was invited to join the
Canadian delegation by George Rob
inson, from the University of New
Brunswick, president of the Can
adian University students.
The I.U.S. was born in August,
1!)4(>, in Prague and brought toge
ther .'SOO delegates of 43 countries
claiming to represent 2,500,000 stu
dents. Its purpose was to set up a
world-wide organization to combine
the student groups of all nations.
The first meeting was successful
from the standpoint of its organizers
and a second meeting was called for
at Prague, August 1 to 10 of 11)47.

claiming to represent 3,500,000 or
