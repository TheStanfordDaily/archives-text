### BILL FARRER 
(This is (he first of a series of articles by IJill Farrer and Lawrence
Grannis, reporting their ISC sponsored European trip this summer.)

"Truman, a small town haberdasher, is a product of American Po
litical Bosses," said an American delegate to the World Youth Festival to a
young Czech student who was trying to defend United States policy. This
remark v/as typical of discussions I heard during gatherings at festival
headquarters at the Sokolovna Hall in Prague. All in all I found myself

more than slightly disgusted by the
whole thing.
The American picture was pre
sented by a group of young red-hots
who were no more representative of
American student life than the
American Youth for Democracy is
typical of Stanford. Unfortunately,
the more normal student who came
to Prague with his eyes wide open
just looked in and found the whole
structure rampant with politics ... so
lie did the typical American thing
. . . withdrew from all discussions
where he had to think and continued
on a mcrry-go-round of sightseeing
and socializing.
"M!ssi:d the boat''
The fervor and intense interest
and participation in everything by
the Yugoslavs, the Bulgars, and the
Albanians was in striking contrast
to the handful of Americans who
held out their nation as a decadent
one i un by a monopolistic press and
whose autocratic State department
had denied them participation in the
Festival. The exhibitions, song,
dance, and athletic teams were fully
participated in by nearly all Euro
pean nations and particularly the
Balkan states.
With thousands present from "be
hind the iron curtain" the United
States had an invaluable opportunity
to beat the USSR at its own propa
ganda game . . . but we missed the
boat from the word "go." The
friendly attitude of inquiry that
many of those from the east had
toward the United States was soon
changed, as all they saw was the
poorest possible representation of
American life. They found the ma
jor problems to be American imper
ialism, capitalism and intolerance . . .
with the emphasis on racial discrim
ination.
TITOVA COLLEGE
Although the World Youth Festi
val got all the publicity and the play
in the press, I believe a far more
important organization, the Inter
national Union of Students, was con
currently holding well-guarded
meetings in Titova College with ad
mittance by membership card only.
Not being qualified to enter as an
American, I was invited to join the
Canadian delegation by George Rob
inson, from the University of New
Brunswick, president of the Can
adian University students.
The I.U.S. was born in August,
1!)4(>, in Prague and brought toge
ther .'SOO delegates of 43 countries
claiming to represent 2,500,000 stu
dents. Its purpose was to set up a
world-wide organization to combine
the student groups of all nations.
The first meeting was successful
from the standpoint of its organizers
and a second meeting was called for
at Prague, August 1 to 10 of 11)47.
Ilere were brought together about
120 representatives of 50 nations
claiming to represent 3,500,000 or
ganized students.
MOSCOW CONTROL
To the most casual observer it was
apparent that Soviet Russia has
taken the lead in this field. The in
spiration and domination of the
Prague Congress by Communist ele
ments, clearly observable to the ob
jective delegate or onlooker, stem
med from a well prepared prepara
tory commission that controlled the
show so that any attempt made to
