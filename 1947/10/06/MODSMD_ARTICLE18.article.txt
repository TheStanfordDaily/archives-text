WASHINGTON, Tct. 5 (UPP).â€”
President Truman tonight called
on the American people to forego
eating meat on Tuesdays and poul
try and eggs on Thursdays to save
food for hungry Europe.
Launching a nationwide food con
servation program intended to
channel 100,000,000 bushels of grain
to hardpressed western Europe, Mr.
Truman said in a nationwide radio
addiess that all Americans should
"save a slice of bread a day."
He also announced that all public
eating places would be asked to
serve bread and butter only at the
request of customers.
Preceding Mr. Truman on the air
were Secretary of State George C.
Marshall, Secretary of Agriculture
Clinton P. Anderson, Secretary of
Commerce W. Averell Harriman,
and Chairman Charles Luckman of
the newly formed citizens' commit
tee directing the conservation drive.
Each of the cabinet officers voiced
a grim warning that world security
may hang on the American response
to this plea.
"The situation in Europe is grim
and forbidding as winter approach
es," Mr. Truman said. "Despite the
vigorous efforts of the European
people, their crops have suffered so
badly from droughts, floods and cold
that the tragedy of hunger is a stark
reality. . . .
"Hungry people in other countries
look to the United States for help.
. . . We must not fail them."
