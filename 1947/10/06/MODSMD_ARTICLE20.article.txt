# Fire Prevention Week Is Observed
## 
### DICK BIESER 
A Presidential proclamation lias designated this week, Oct. 6 to 11, as
Fire Prevention Week. From Stanford's towered firehouse on Santa Teresa
Street, 13 students and six full-time firemen protect 9,000 acres of land
and over $.'50,000,000 in buildings.
Fire Chief John M. Marston has announced the department will hold

open house this week so that stu
dents may become acquainted with
the equipment responsible for fire
protection.
The Daily and Farm radio station
KSU are assisting Marston in ob
serving Fire Prevention Week.
The firehouse boys have estab
lished a fine record throughout the
years, but Ihey still need the co
operation of the entire Farm popu
lation to prevent many careless
fires.
The story of the University's Fire
Department began when Leland
Stanford brought an old hand-pump
from Boston in 1880 to protect his
Palo Alto stock farm.
Ten years later, at the birth of a
great school, mains and hydrants
were laid to protect the original
Quad. Two hand-drawn hose carts,
a h;md - drawn hook and ladder
wagon, and an assortment of leather
water buckets were part of the ear
ly equipment.
In 1013 a Cadillac and one of the
first Fords built were converted into
engines with chemical tanks. Then
in ir>22 the department acquired a
750 - gallon Seagrave pumper and
hose wagon.
Most of this early equipment has
been replaced by modern, efficient
equipment.
Students who live at the firehouse
are on duty alternate nights, and
during the day they all respond

to the alarm wherever they are,
whether in class, hashing, or just
loafing on the History corner steps.
The Farm Fire Department had
an opportunity to demonstrate its
efficiency back in April, 1945. The
most spectacular fire ever to break
out. on the Stanford campus de
stroyed the larger portion of the
roof and attic rooms of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house on that hot af
ternoon.
Chief Mar.ston and his men were
able to keep the fire from spreading
downward, and it was satisfactorily
extinguished after a strenuous fight
in which hoses were brought up
three flights of stairs.
Damage was estimated at about
$12,000.
Water for irrigating and for fire
use comes from Searsville and Felt
lakes. Because the lakes, are very
low this year, Fire Chief Mar.ston
urges everyone to avoid wasting
water.
Last year the department re
sponded to 132 alarms. The cause
of most fires on the Farm is care
less smoking, according to Mar.ston.
He praised the co-operation of the
student body as well as the new
equipment which has enabled the
department to report that there has
been a steady decrease in fire loss
over the last three-year period.
