## Pravda Statement Hits U.S. Imperialism 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 5 (UP).—The communist parties of Hussia
and eight other European states announced today they have
formed a new communist international bureau with headquarters
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to combat American "imperialism"
throughout the world.
The new International will be composed of two members

from each of the nine communist
party central committees of Russia,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hun
gary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Franco
and Italy.
Three separate communiques pub
lished in the communist party news
paper Pravda announced formation
of the new International, which in
effect replaces the communist inter
national, reported dissolved at the
height of the war on May 15, 1943.
A declaration of policy adopted at
the meeting announced flatly that
the new International was designed
to combat "American Imperialism"
throughout the world. The first step,
the declaration said, was to prepare
a coordinated plan of action against
right-wing socialists in England and
France.
The declaration charged that
America and Britain did not fight
the war for democracy but only to
rid themselves of competitors for
the markets of Germany and Japan.
The announcement did not specify
the exact time and place of the Po
land meeting, considered to be one
of the most important international
conclaves in Europe since the end
of the war.
Observers interpreted formation of
the new International, the fourth
since 1862, as a return to the original
communist concept of world revo
lution. Dissolution of the Third In
ternational in 1943 generally was
hailed as a step designed to convince
the United States that Moscow had
given up its aim of world domina
tion.
(The First International, the Inter
national Working Men's Association,
was formed by Karl Marx in Ger
many in 1862. It existed until 1874.
The Second International was
formed in 1889. The Third Inter
national, known as the Comintern,
was formed in Russia in March,
1919.)
