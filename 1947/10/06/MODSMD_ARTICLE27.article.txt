CANTON, 0., Oct. 5 (UP).â€”Louis
Budenz, former editor of the Com
munist Daily Worker, said today the
purpose behind the formation of the
Communist International Bureau in
nine European countries was to
consolidate the strength of "Soviet
dictators" for a military conflict
against the United States eventu
ally.
"Although Russia is now only
waging a war of nerves against this
nation," Budens, who returned to
the Catholic church, said in an in
terview with the United Press, "the
new International's purpose is to
strengthen the Communist position
in Europe and Asia by adding more
satellites unlil Soviet Russia is in a
position economically and militarily
to challenge the United States."
