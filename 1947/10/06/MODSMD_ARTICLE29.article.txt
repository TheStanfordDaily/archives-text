### LORRY LOKEY 
More jobs are now being filled by Stanford's Appointment Service than
ever before in the Farm's history, according to Robert Bush, director of
Ihe Appointment Service, and Mrs. Clotilde Edwards, his executive as
sistant.
So many applications are passing through the student employment

office this quarter that filled posi
tions have almost tripled in volume,
Mrs. Edwards noted. Variety of jobs
is larger. Part-time work for stu- ;
dents includes office work, manual [
labor, sales, research, laboratory
work, tutoring, and driving.
IIOW TO APPPLY
First step for a student to take in
securing a job, she said, is to come
1o Ihe Appointment Service, fill out
an application blank, and arrange
lor an interview with her.
After the interview the student's
next step is to meet with the poten
tial employer to see if both parties
accept each other. If they do, the
final step completes the cycle when
the student reports back to the of
fice so that the position may be re
moved from the unfilled jobs list.
BUSINESSES RESPONDING
"Job situation today is very tight,"
Mrs. Edwards said, "but local busi
nesses and private parties are re
sponding very well. During the
summer quarter and the first days
of' this quarter, the student employ
ment office sent job queries to Uni
versity departments to round up all
Farm positions possible before this
quarter aged too much.
"On top of these interdepartment j
memos, the office had to cope with
scores of letters sent by students
this summer in an effort to have
work waiting for them when they
arrived back at school.
Looking at her appointment book,
Mrs. Edwards noted that she is
booked for appointments with stu
dent. job seekers well into the third
week of school. Some positions are
to be filled with full-time workersâ€”
students' wives being the most nu
merous examples.
STUDENTS CAPABLE
"Today's students are able to
handle part-time work," Mrs. Ed- %
wards said, "because they have
more skills, are more mature, and |
can handle more responsibility. Em- |
ployers appreciate these advan
tages."
Because of the wide diversity of
skills among Stanford applicants, !
the student employment office
wants to list all students with un
usual abilities: On the other side
of the ledger are many jobs of an
unusual category, such as a position
in tutoring judo now open.
"Student employment office func
tions as a neutral third party," Mrs.
Edwards explained. It introduces

the students to the employers and
lets them carry on from there.
STUDENTS CO-OPERATE
"Our service is successful," she
emphasized, "because Stanford stu
dents make it so. With few excep
tions, students realize they have the
co-operation of both their Univer
sity and their employers as the ba
sis for their hiring."
"We feel quite proud," she con
tinued, "when local employers call
upon the student employment of
fice time after time to supply ca
pable applicants for full or part
time employment."
JOBS A MUST
"Mijny students," Mrs. Edwards
added, "would be unable to remain
in school were it not for the scores
of positions they hold to meet nec
essary expenses. They do not work
to have a larger bank account, but
because it means the difference be
tween schooling or no schooling."
"It is, then, their courtesy, service,
and consideration to employers that
make jobs available year after year
to Stanford students," Mrs. Edwards
summed. "We hope it will always
be that way."
