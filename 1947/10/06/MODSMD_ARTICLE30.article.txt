plained that the organization stands
for complete support of UN and is
against unilateral action taken by
any country.
PCA is opposed to the Taft-Hart
ley law and is for health insurance,
public housing, and nationalization
of those basic industries upon which
the economic health of the country
depends, explained Kees 801, chair

in PCA, and were there solely to
disrupt the organization. Their mo
