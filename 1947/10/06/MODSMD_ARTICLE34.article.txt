# Wolverines Swamp Indians, 49-13; Last Minute Pass Wins for Frosh
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Any doubt Stanford's Indians might have had about Michigan
being one of the nation's top-ranking teams, or any deep-buried
hope they might have entertained of doing to the Wolverines
what Idaho did to them, died a sudden death in Ann Arbor Sat
urday afternoon, as Michigan lived up to all its glowing press-

notices with a 49 to 13 victory ovei
the Cardinals.
Fritz Crisler's power-laden Dig
Nine aggregation handed Stanford
one of its worst beatings in modern
times, and the score might have
been a lot worse had not Crisler
relented in the third and fourth
quarters.
His first and second strings ran
up 42 points in the first half, and
seemed capable of making it a hun
dred. But Crisler eased up, sub
stituted freely, and Stanford came
on courageously in the last half.
CARDS SCORE TWICE
The Indians tallied once in both
the third and fourth periods, and
held Michigan's subs to one touch
down, which injected at least a
small measure of cheer into an oth
erwise gloomy day.
Michigan ripped and roared to
four touchdowns in the first quar
ter. On the second play after the
kickoff, the Wolverines' all-Ameri
can candidate, Bob Chappuis, took a
lateral and heaved a long pass from
his own 31-yard-line to end Len
Fold, who galloped into the end
zone.
A Stanford fumble gave Michi
gan its second scoring chance.
Starting from the Indian 36, the
Wolverines ground down to the 10,
and (hen a flat pass from Chappuis
to Bump Elliott went for the dis
tance.
WOLVERINES AGAIN
One and a half minutes later,
Michigan had another touchdown,
when fullback Jack Weisenburger
boomed through the center of the
line all the way from his own 39.
Just before the end of the first
quarter Chappuis tossed from the

Wolverine 4.'} to end Dick Rifenburg,
who pranced into the end zone. 28
to 0.
Following the same general pat
tern, Michigan added 14 more points
in the second period.
After that, the one-sided affair
began to look more like a ball game,
as Stanford fought on slight better
than even terms against Michigan's
third and fourth strings.
CARDS RALLY
The Indians broke into the scoring
column in the third quarter. Quar
terback A 1 Morris started the drive

Another man is out of action
for the Indians â€”Mickey Titus.
The bruising halfback came up
with a knee injury during last
week's Michigan fray, and is
definitely out for a few weeks.
Last week, Coach Marchie
Schwartz used Aubrey Devine,
Jr., to replace the injured sopho
more.

toward the goal line with a 13 yard
pass completion to end Gene Martin
on the Michigan 38. Two plays later,
Mickey Titus skirted left end to the 8.
Three smashes into the line put
Stanford inside the 5 yard line, and
then, on fourth down, little Wayne
Erickson slanted into paydirt around
right end. Marty Feldman's con
version try was wide.
Stanford's showing, lopsided as the
score might be, was certainly no
disgrace. The Indians did not have
the services of left halfback Bob
Anderson.

In a rough battle featured by
a story book climax, Stanford's
freshman football team edged
out Santa Clara, 6 to 0. A pass
from Tom Shaw to Boyd Benson
netted 95 yards and victory for the
Indian papooses.
For 59 minutes and 50 seconds,
drive after drive had been termin
ated by the two big lines of Stanford
and Santa Clara. With ten seconds
remaining, Stanford had once again
halter a Bronco goal drive, and took
over on its own 5-yard line.
SHAW PASSES
At this point, Shaw faded back
into the end zone and flipped a pass
into the receptive arms of Benson,
who picked up superb blocking and
was off to the races. At midfield,
the Indian halfback had shaken
loose from all would-be tacklers,
and from there on his flight re
sembled a 50-yard dash.
The game was featured by out
standing defensive play by both
sides. Stanford's offense Was kept
deep in its own territory until the
waning moments of the first half.
HALT EARLY DRIVE
An early Bronco drive was halted
on the Stanford four, and two others
were thwarted within the 15 yard
marker. Late in the first half, Stan
ford, with Shaw and Buck passing,
drove to the Bronco 12.
Two third quarter Bronco drives
reached the 2 yard line, where Stan
ford's defense shone again. Later, a
touchdown pass from Shaw to Ben
son was called back, as the defending
Broncos were off side.
The final Santa Clara threat came
just before the finish, as they drove
more than forty yards to the 5 once
again to meet a stone wall.
