# Bob Gardner Wins State Amateur Golf
## 
### 
PEBBLE BEACH, Oct. 5 (UP).â€”
Robert Gardner, University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles student, won
the 36th California state amateur
golf championship today, defeating a
deflated Smiley Quick of Inglewood,
2 and 1, but only after blowing most
of a 5-up lead he held at the end
of 27 holes.
With an almost unbelievable ex
hibition of flubbed golf, Gardner
cashed in the magnificent margin
he had built up by winning six of the
first nine afternoon holes.
He almost saw his long-wanted
state championship evaporate.
Then by playing desperately for a
halved hole at No. 17, he managed
to put a stop to Quick's last minute
drive an annex his first big tourna
ment.
