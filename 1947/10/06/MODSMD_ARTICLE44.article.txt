# Reese and Casey Bums' Stars As Dodgers Even Series, 8-6
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 5 (UP).—Little
j Pee-wee Reese and the mighty
i Hugh Casey, long-time favorites in
Flatbush, lifted the fading Brooklyn
Dodgers ofT the floor today with the
power and pitching that blasted the
New York Yankees 8 to (i and
squared the World Series at three
games all.
For it was little Pce-wee, the
Dodgers' steady shortstop, who
came through with a two-run single
which ultimately proved to be the
ball game before a roaring record
crowd of 74,0(55 fans.
And it was Casey, who twice be
fore in this hectic series had gone
in to still the booming bHts of the
Bronx Bombers, who strode in
through the purple haze of evening
and once more slammed the door
on the Yankees.
They were the big ones in the
longest nine - inning game in the

history of the classic, an ever
changing battle which took three
hours and 19 minutes and broke the
3:05 record these same two clubs
chalkcd up in Thursday's third
game.
But it was a team victory, too, for
the Battling Burns from along (he
Gowanus.
There was squat, young A 1 Gion
friddo, who raced to the left field
bull pen and pulled down a Joe Di-
Maggio drive which at one point
seemed destined to soar into (he
stands and tie the score. There was
venerable Dixie Walker, who
backed up to the right field to lake
another smash off (he bat of Tommy
Henrich. And there was the power
hitting in the clutch of old Cookie
Lavagetto and young Bobby Bra
gan, who kept the winning rally
alive at its most critical point.
