# Farrer-Grannis Series Begins Today
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily this week has the privi
lege of presenting a series of five articles
written by Lawrence Grannis and Bill Farrer
telling of some of the highlights of their trips
to Europe this summer.
Grannis and Farrer were sent by the ASSU
on the two and one-half months tour. Grannis
visited England, France, Holland, Belgium, and
Spain. Farrer traveled in Italy, Greece, Czech
oslovakia, Poland, and Austria.
Both have definite opinions on the European
student situation as well as specific sugges
tions as to what the students of Stanford can
do towards creating better understanding
among nations.
They reached their conclusions after talk
ing to the students, statesmen, and people of
the countries they visited. They saw Ameri
can university sponsored programs in action.
They support some, criticize others.
Their articles are filled with descriptions of

some of their more memorable moments on
the tour. However, five articles do not give
much room for telling the complete experi
ences of a summer trip.
Consequently, Farrer and Grannis plan to
address the student body this Thursday even
ing. Following this opening address the two
law students will inform the Stanford student
body of their conclusions through many talks
to smaller groups.
Both Farrer and Grannis believe they have
something that should be told. They think
their reaction to the trip is the same that any
Stanford student would reach under similar
circumstances.
The Daily believes that the entire campus
should read the articles by Farrer and Grannis
and also attend their talks. It's an opportunity
to learn about post-war Europe from two per
sons who go to school with you and think the
way you do.
