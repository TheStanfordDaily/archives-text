# BULL SESSION

Dear Mr. Editor:
The other morning, poking our head out of the
sleeping bag that we had laid out at History eorner
in order to get a good start on the Winhigler Handi
cap, we suddenly withdrew it and began to eheck
our pulse, for sweeping past us was what appeared
to be a cargo parachute without the shrouds. After
our heartbeat returned to normal, we ventured an
other peep, and there, towering before us, was a
miniature of Ringling's big top, with an otherwise
well-endowed woman protruding from the trapeze
section. Mustering our adrenals, we tugged at this
ocean of fabric and asked this pretty what is the
scoop. Leaning over as far as her whalebones would
allow, she hissed, "It's the New Look, silly." We
said something inane about we didn't follow the
picture magazines; she gave us the Scornful Look,
and waltzed or rather billowed away. We shambled
down to the drug store, bought a bottle of bismuth
and paregoric, and by taking a still shot every time
we saw a New Looker, managed to get through the
day.
Now as everybody knows, women at women's
colleges go around looking like the wrath of God,
while women at co-ed schools manage to be primped
and prettied most of the time. We figurd that the
difference is MEN. And if this shrouding of limbs is
a thrill to the men, then we think we'd better have
an operation.
Naturally saying that women dress for men will
bring shrill denials. Okay, they don't. We don't
provoke. It's like saying that women come to college
to get married. All it gets you in is fights, and a left
hook barbed with a solitaire can cut a man something
nasty.
Whoever the women are dressing for now, it is the
men who are get ling cheated, and we have a good
idea about what to do. Provide every man on campus
with a handy, pocket-size pair of pinking shears.
Whenever lie calls for his own true, or temporary,
love, he could halt her on the spot and pink her

prettiments to a prudent degree of seductiveness. Of
course, non-pinking shears could be used if a man
didn't care about his date ravelling. Thus, in a mat
ter of hours, the heavy-daters would be in evidence
by their pinked wardrobes. Since no girl wants to
be thought a non-heavy-dater, there would be a
mass-repairing to the northwest campus cloisters,
and the rate of private pinking would be prodigious.
Now we don't want anybody to think that we're
old-fashioned. We've tolerated funny hats for years.
The difference is that when a hat obscures your view,
you can ask the wearer to take it ofT without being
misunderstood.
Of course there would be a problem of surplus
disposal in the pinked remnants. We have a solution
ihat might not occur to a person right off. We hap
pen to know that in Uzbekistan (a Soviet affiliate)
thousands of Uzbek moppets run immodestly bare
bottomed for lack of proper covering. The path lies
clear. Bundles for Uzbeks! We'll charter a surplus
LST, paint it red (for Stanford, not Stalin), re
christen it Old Look 1947, and sail it in triumph to
Uzbekistan. (We're checking to see whether they
have any salt-water ports.) Practically the only
other expenses would be a piece of airplane luggage
for Senator Rankin, just to keep him safe, and a
private arrangement with the British to be sure that
the pinkings aren't ofT-loaded at Cyprus.
By the way, we'd better make it clear right now
that we are not of Uzbek extraction and neither is
any of our family, except possibly an uncle down in
Glcndale that we've never been sure of. The only
thing that's in this for us is a few more thrills be
tween classes.
There is one thing more we want to mention, a
fact that might be overlooked: The New Look comes
from Paris. It doesn't take much brains to sec that
it's Un-American.
Hopink that this finds you fat'n happy, we remain
ever
Yr. obt. svt.,
Cyrus Stanislaus 111.
