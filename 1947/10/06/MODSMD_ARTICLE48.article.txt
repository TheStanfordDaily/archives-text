(From ;i Registration-Day Student Policeman)
Our positions on Registration Day were akin to
those of defenders of a harem beseiged—and just as
unpleasant. Within the "ad" building were the spoils
for the victors; without were the howling masses
demanding entry. Between the two unhappily stood
we.
To you to whom our actions seemed sparked by
a desire to persecute, to inflict irreparable injury, or
to wreak vengeance to you to whom we appeared
as devils incarnate- we plead our cause. The mo
mentary relationship between you and us—from
your viewpoint—was as one individual to another,
and might therefore have appeared to justify indi
vidual consideration of any extenuating circumstances
attending the encounter. Surprisingly enough, how
ever, some eight thousand students assailed the
doors, each admirably equipped with "extenuating
circumstances."
You stood not for twenty hours at a door plainly
nuuked "EXIT to watch some eight thousand
students carefully pt ruse the placard, and then react
in a manner requiring countless repetition of the
fact that the poster was NOT in error. You were not
bombarded as by a mount of "twin forties"—with
the insistent demands of an entire student body that
each of them, to the exclusion of the others, be
promptly admitted to see the Registrar, Cashier,
Student Employment Service, Appointment Service,
Janitor. Business Oflice, Dean of Students, Chief
Counselor feu - Women, Records Office, Senator Stan
ford. or "just to go to the head."
You were not blasted into immortality by the
incandescent stare of some few momentarily-un
recognized faculty for whom no red rug had been
lolled. Nor did you quail before the outraged dignity

of a minor cog in the Farm machinery whose identi
fication you DARED question. You absorbed not a
garbage-chute-full of abuse from the collegiate intel
ligentsia whenever conditions demanded that you
momentarily suspend entries.
And when seemingly-justifiable "exceptions" were
made, yours was not. the pleasure of watching the
angelic, middle-aged student-matron, who'd gained
entry "to make an urgent phone call" (we hope she
reads this), disappear promptly into the book line;
nor the chap who posed as a faculty member, to be
admitted accordingly; nor the countless other sub
scribers to the muchly-touted Honor Code who, con
gratulating themselves upon their "cleverness" (any
lead-head can lie) in effecting an admission on the
basis of concocted "appointments," blithefully gaining
an unfair advantage over their more honorable
cohorts without.
Because one's disposition often mirrors his im
mediate environment, we hasten to recall that fact,
and to add that perhaps our original, carefully
dustcd Ipana smiles gave way to glassy grimaces
only as a matter of subconscious reciprocity—for,
'twas really quite a battle.
