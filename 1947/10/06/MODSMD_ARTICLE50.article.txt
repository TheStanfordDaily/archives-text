# Chief Davis Reveals Farm Traffic Laws
## 
### 
Campus Chief of Police Gordon Davis today called upon students for
co-operation in observance of parking rules and other traffic regulations
on the campus.
Chief Davis said that many students, apparently those trying to park
as close as possible to classrooms, are parking by white curb lines, near
fire hydrants, overtime in time-limit â™¦

zones, or in reserved zones.
The white curb lines are for pick
ing up and discharging passengers
only, and the driver must remain in
the car, the chief said. He pointed
out that only cars bearing black
stickers are eligible to park in the
reserved areas during the normal
class day.
fie also asked students to be care
ful about parking in narrow alleys,
where parked cars block access to
fire hydrants or to private garages.
Most of the alleys have offstreet
parking facilities which should be
used.
For the benefit of new students,
the chief noted that parking viola
tions on the campus or at Stanford
Village entail a $2 fine which was
set by Excom and is payable etiher
at Men's Council or at the police
station in the Corporation Yard.
Davis said that the campus traf
fic situation would be greatly helped
if on-campus students would walk
to and from classes. With the pres
ent record registration, hundreds of
students living off campus are
forced to drive to and from school
and need all available parking
space.
Speeding is penalized on a mile
per-hour basis. The first offense
costs an offender 50 cents for each
mile an hour over the legal limit;
the second offense, 75 cents; the
third offense, $1; and the fourth of
fense, banning of a vehicle from the
campus, although there has never
been a case where this last measure
was necessary.
Another rule to which Chief Da
vis called students' attention is that
cycling on the Quad is not permit
ted, and that motorcycles and mo
torscooters are considered in the
same class as automobiles and are
subject to the same rules. Their
drivers must stay on regularly
traveled streets, and are expected to
observe arm - signal and speeding
regulations.
During the last academic year.
Davis pointed out, there was only
one serious personal injury acci
dent on the campus, and enforce
ment of the traffic regulations is the
only way to prevent recurrence of
such accidents.
