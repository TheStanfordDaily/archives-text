# Complete Reorganization Marks Stanford Museum
## 
### 
Behind the locked doors of Stan
ford's Museum, closed for over a
year, a complete reorganization, re
classification, and inventory of the
25,000 objects is in progress, accord
ing to Mrs. Robert Cross, associate
director.
The Museum, now part of the Art
Department, has never been reor
ganized since the earthquake, when
two wings of the building were de
stroyed. The material was stored in
the basement and forgotten, said
Mrs. Cross.
Under the direction of Dr. Ray
Faulkner, executive head of the Art
Department, Dr. Millard Rodgers,
new professor of Oriental art, is re
classifying the Chinese and Japa
nese collections; Dr. Felix M. Kee
sing is working on the anthropo
logical exhibits, and Dr. Hazel Han
sen, professor of classics, is reclassi
fying over 5.000 pieces of Cyprian
pottery.
Dr. Hansen, now in Greece with
an archaeological expedition, has
been taking inventory of the pot
tery for two years. She expects to
spend three more years classifying
it.
A large collection of Coptic tex

tiles, cloth woven in Egypt between
the first and fifth centuries, was re
cently discovered in the Museum
and is now being classified. Many
specimens were recently given to
the Museum, and in ifcldition to the
textiles found in the basement, the
collection is now about the finest in
the world, according to Mrs. Cross.
The textiles were woven by the
Copts, a group of Christians in
Egypt, and they were well pre
served in the warm, dry sands of
Egyptian burial grounds.
No opening date for the Museum
is in sight, Mrs. Cross said, but when
it is finally opened, work in art
classes and the humanities will be
co-ordinated with the Museum. "No
museum on the West Coast has
j comparable collections," Mrs. Cros.i
| said.
