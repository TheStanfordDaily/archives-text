# Jury Acquits Beulah, Gollum

### 
SANTA ANA, Oct. 5 (UP).â€”
Heiress Beulah Louise Overell, 18,
and her one-time sweetheart George
(Bud) Gollum, 21, were acquitted
late today of charges of murdering
her wealthy parents, and the girl
said she had junked plans to marry
her codefendant.
A jury of six men and six women
acquitted the young couple of state
charges they bludgeoned to death
her wealthy parents, financier and
Mrs. Walter Overell, "for greed and
lust," and sank their yacht, the
Mary F,., in Newport Harbor March
19 to hide the crime.
The girl, by the acquittal verdict,
becomes heiress to a half-million
dollar fortune willed to her by her
parents. Under California law, she
would have lost it if convicted.
The jurors, in four ballots taken
since they got the case at 4:17 p.m.
on Friday, apparently believed the
defense theory that Overell set off
the blast himself, cither accidentally
or in a suicidal plan.
