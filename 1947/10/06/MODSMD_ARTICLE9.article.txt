# Arab Threat Called Hoax

### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 5
(UP). â€”The United Nations was told
tonight, on the eve of important de
velopments in the Palestine contro
versy, that the Arabs' promise of an
armed revolt against a Jewish state
in Palestine was "largely an empty
threat."
A special memorandum filed at
UN headquarters said the 30,000,000
Arabs of the Middle East could not
possibly stage a revolt unless they
were "equipped and led by some
outside power."
The document contended that the
present Arab leaders, the benefi
ciaries of oil concessions in the
Middle East, were far too satisfied
with their present position to
change it in retaliation for a Pales
tine decision disliked by the Arabs.
Between tomorrow and Thursday
the United States must climb off the
fence and indicate which way it will
lean in the 25-year-old fight over
the future of the Holy Land.
