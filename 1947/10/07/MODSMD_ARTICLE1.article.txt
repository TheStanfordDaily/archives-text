# Harvard Student Project In Austria Earns Praise: Farm Urged to Copy Plan

(This is llie second in the series of articles by Bill Fairer and
Lawrence Grannis.)

The Harvard Student Council at Salzburg was the finest thing
I saw done by an individual American group in Europe this sum
mer for European students. Starting as a student project last fall,
it soon found faculty support. It provided for bringing together
90 European students from 19 countries for the supervision of

professors and teaching assistants
from Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Princeton, and Rutgers.
In addition to offering seminars in
American literature, history, eco
nomics, government, sociology, and
music there were various guest lec
turers including Margaret Mead,
Lyman Bryson, and Karl Gruber,
the Austrian Foreign Minister.
CASTLE RENTED
For its headquarters the group
secured Castle Leopoldskron (a
former residence of Louis II of
Bavaria and purchased by the late
Max Reinhardt) from Mrs. Rein
hardt for $1,000 a month. Its 44
rooms provided living accommoda
tions, classrooms, and libraries for
the seminar. The castle is within 20
minutes walking distance of the cen-

ter of Salzburg and is in a beautiful
wooded area faeing a small lake.
The funds for the program were
privately raised and the running
budget was set at $25,000. Of this,
$9,000 was set aside for food (which
was purchased in Switzerland and
Czechoslovakia), $3,000 for rent,
$l,f)00 for repair, $7,000 for trans
portation of the American and Euro
pean staff, $1,000 for books, and
$2,000 for administrative costs.
FURNITURE LOANED
The Austrian government assisted
in loaning beds, linen, tables, and
i hairs. The American Military Gov
ernment provided the project with
an APO thus permitting savings in
lime and money. All in all, the
project met with the greatest co
operation everywhere, he European
students I talked to were delighted
with the success of the program and
the Harvard people were anxious to
see a West Coast university set up
a similar project.
All arrangements for the physical
plant were made through ISC offices
in Geneva. While in that city I
contacted them and they were anx
ious (o offer their services should
Stanford wish to follow a similar
program.
LOCATION ADVISED
As far as my observations went I
felt that it would have been a little
more successful had more American
students been present. As it was,
the staff did not number more than
20, with 3 or 4 of that number stu
dents. There is one major draw
back to this suggestion and it is that,
whenever Americans get abroad they
stick together rather than with the
Europeans. However, since this
would be such an opportunity to
talk and study with students from
all over Europe, it might not happen.
As far as a locai ion is concerned,
1 felt that Italy or Czechoslovakia

woulrl be best should Stanford decide
on such a program. I am also sure
that a castle or an appropriate place
could be obtained gratis from one of
Ihe governments, thus making quite
a saving over Harvard expenses. We
might go together with either the
University of California or the
schools in the Bay Area and run
such a project for $20,000.
Students for the project from
European universities were selected
on the basis of scholastic achieve
ment and ability to speak English,
and were given priority if they in
tended to become teachers of Ameri
can civilization or to enter into
public careers.
SCHOOLS LONG CLOSED
In considering education and in
formation about the United States
as being so vital, one does well to
remember that a majority of the
schools in Europe were closed from
1939 to 1945 and that since 1922 in
Italy and since 19153 in Germany
there has been no fair presentation
of the United States and democracy.
Since students from Hungary were
included in the project it also might
permit some of those from behind
the Russian propaganda sphere to
see the other side.
I sincerely place understanding of
America on the same plane as send
ing food to Europe and do think the
former should not be neglected at
this time.

The Harvard Student Council at Salzburg was the finest thing
I saw done by an individual American group in Europe this sum

it soon found faculty support. It provided for bringing together
90 European students from 19 countries for the supervision of

professors and teaching assistants
from Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Princeton, and Rutgers.
In addition to offering seminars in
American literature, history, eco
nomics, government, sociology, and
music there were various guest lec

Lyman Bryson, and Karl Gruber,
the Austrian Foreign Minister.

For its headquarters the group

former residence of Louis II of
Bavaria and purchased by the late
Max Reinhardt) from Mrs. Rein

wooded area faeing a small lake.
The funds for the program were
privately raised and the running
budget was set at $25,000. Of this,
$9,000 was set aside for food (which
was purchased in Switzerland and
Czechoslovakia), $3,000 for rent,
$l,f)00 for repair, $7,000 for trans
portation of the American and Euro
pean staff, $1,000 for books, and
$2,000 for administrative costs.
FURNITURE LOANED
The Austrian government assisted
in loaning beds, linen, tables, and
i hairs. The American Military Gov
ernment provided the project with
an APO thus permitting savings in
lime and money. All in all, the
project met with the greatest co
operation everywhere, he European
students I talked to were delighted
with the success of the program and
the Harvard people were anxious to
see a West Coast university set up
a similar project.
All arrangements for the physical

in Geneva. While in that city I

As far as my observations went I
felt that it would have been a little
more successful had more American
students been present. As it was,
the staff did not number more than
20, with 3 or 4 of that number stu
dents. There is one major draw
back to this suggestion and it is that,
whenever Americans get abroad they
stick together rather than with the
Europeans. However, since this
would be such an opportunity to
talk and study with students from
all over Europe, it might not happen.
As far as a locai ion is concerned,

woulrl be best should Stanford decide
on such a program. I am also sure
that a castle or an appropriate place
could be obtained gratis from one of
Ihe governments, thus making quite
a saving over Harvard expenses. We
might go together with either the
University of California or the
schools in the Bay Area and run
such a project for $20,000.
Students for the project from
European universities were selected
on the basis of scholastic achieve
ment and ability to speak English,
and were given priority if they in
tended to become teachers of Ameri
can civilization or to enter into
public careers.

In considering education and in

such a project for $20,000.
Students for the project from
European universities were selected
on the basis of scholastic achieve
ment and ability to speak English,
and were given priority if they in
tended to become teachers of Ameri
can civilization or to enter into
public careers.
SCHOOLS LONG CLOSED
In considering education and in
formation about the United States
as being so vital, one does well to
remember that a majority of the
schools in Europe were closed from
1939 to 1945 and that since 1922 in
Italy and since 19153 in Germany
there has been no fair presentation
of the United States and democracy.
Since students from Hungary were
included in the project it also might
permit some of those from behind
the Russian propaganda sphere to
see the other side.
I sincerely place understanding of
America on the same plane as send
ing food to Europe and do think the
former should not be neglected at
this time.

The Harvard Student Council at Salzburg was the finest thing
I saw done by an individual American group in Europe this sum
mer for European students. Starting as a student project last fall,
it soon found faculty support. It provided for bringing together
90 European students from 19 countries for the supervision of

professors and teaching assistants
from Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Princeton, and Rutgers.
In addition to offering seminars in
American literature, history, eco
nomics, government, sociology, and
music there were various guest lec
turers including Margaret Mead,
Lyman Bryson, and Karl Gruber,
the Austrian Foreign Minister.
CASTLE RENTED
For its headquarters the group
secured Castle Leopoldskron (a
former residence of Louis II of
Bavaria and purchased by the late
Max Reinhardt) from Mrs. Rein
hardt for $1,000 a month. Its 44
rooms provided living accommoda
tions, classrooms, and libraries for
the seminar. The castle is within 20
minutes walking distance of the cen-

ter of Salzburg and is in a beautiful
wooded area faeing a small lake.
The funds for the program were
privately raised and the running
budget was set at $25,000. Of this,
$9,000 was set aside for food (which
was purchased in Switzerland and
Czechoslovakia), $3,000 for rent,
$l,f)00 for repair, $7,000 for trans
portation of the American and Euro
pean staff, $1,000 for books, and
$2,000 for administrative costs.
FURNITURE LOANED
The Austrian government assisted
in loaning beds, linen, tables, and
i hairs. The American Military Gov
ernment provided the project with
an APO thus permitting savings in
lime and money. All in all, the
project met with the greatest co
operation everywhere, he European
students I talked to were delighted
with the success of the program and
the Harvard people were anxious to
see a West Coast university set up
a similar project.
All arrangements for the physical
plant were made through ISC offices
in Geneva. While in that city I
contacted them and they were anx
ious (o offer their services should
Stanford wish to follow a similar
program.
LOCATION ADVISED
As far as my observations went I
felt that it would have been a little
more successful had more American
students been present. As it was,
the staff did not number more than
20, with 3 or 4 of that number stu
dents. There is one major draw
back to this suggestion and it is that,
whenever Americans get abroad they
stick together rather than with the
Europeans. However, since this
would be such an opportunity to
talk and study with students from
all over Europe, it might not happen.
As far as a locai ion is concerned,
1 felt that Italy or Czechoslovakia

woulrl be best should Stanford decide
on such a program. I am also sure
that a castle or an appropriate place
could be obtained gratis from one of
Ihe governments, thus making quite
a saving over Harvard expenses. We
might go together with either the
University of California or the
schools in the Bay Area and run
such a project for $20,000.
