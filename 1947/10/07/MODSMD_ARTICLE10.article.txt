# Stanford Post Office Is Flooded in Ocean of Canceled Stamps; Revenue and Business Attributed to 'Historic Registration'
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Christmas has comc to tho
Stanford campus. It has come
in the form of countless pack
ages and letters which have
transformed the Stanford Post
Office into a sea of cancelled stamps
'inrl postal notices.
"As far as 1 can see it, Christmas
started with the first day of this
quarter," John J. Callahan, post
office superintendent, declared yes
terday. "Right now, we're pressed
for adequate space."
Callahan then turned postal guide
and edged his way among the out
going mail pouches and rows of un
claimed -as-yet packages.
"You should have been here early
this morning," he said, "and you
would have seen four times as many
packages."
SKRVIC ES MANY PEOPLE
lhe post office, situated at the
corner of Lasuen and Santa Teresa
Streets, is now servicing more than
11,000 people who are students, fac
ulty members, and employees of the
university, Callahan said.
Since 1!)42, the rate of allowable
receipts, meaning the annual sale
of stamps, envelopes, and post cards,
has increased more than 20 per cent.
Estimates of between $100,000 and
$12!i,000 were made concerning the
forthcoming yearly total allowable
receipts.
"Everything lias increased," Cal
lahan said, "lhe amount of outgoing
; nd incoming mail, receipts, the
number of employeesâ€”everything
but the size of the post office build
ing."
The present enrollment of more
than 8,100 students will be a tem
porary problem to postal officials
and employees because the Stanford
post office is inadequate for the
amount of business it must transact,
Callahan said.
NEW OFFICE WINDOW
There are 18 employees on duty

i to handle the daily run of postal
I business. More than 8,000 pieces of
j mail leave the campus daily in con
trast to the more than 14,000 pieces
which are addressed to the Stanford
i office.
To accelerate the increasing gen

eral delivery call window, anothe
window has been added on the eas
side.
"This speeds up the lines," Cal
lalum said, "since it splits the num
ber of daily callers in two."
Postal boxes are a current prob

lem in thai there are more requests
for boxes than there are boxes. At
present, there are 1,833 boxes avail -
able to rent.
Number one sub-station of the
Farm office is Stanford Village Posl
Office which was instituted to les
sen the burden on campus. Village
postal superintendent Willard Walk
er and his two assistants are in
operation for ' the Village's 2,000
inhabitants."
WHEELER CI I IFF CLERK
Claude Wheeler, former superin
tendent at Camp Stoneman during
the war years, is the person in charge
of clerks. He was seated at a desk,
the newest furniture acquisition in
years, as he put it, and he shook his
head wonderingly "at the pile of
packages that lay idle in a heap in
the center of the office."
Wheeler has been at Stanford lit
years and has seen many a group
of classes come and go.
"Students have had little of which
to complain," Callahan declared,
"because they seem to be good-na
tured, non-complaining, and gen
erally cooperative with us."
Back in there were only six
employees when Callahan was ap
pointed as local superintendent. Al
that time, the spirit of Yuletide
never advanced beyond its normal
date.
FORESEES Itl(i CHANCE
"How times have changed!" Cal
lahan was wont to remark. "But I
foresee a day in the future when we
will eventually have a new office."
At closing time yesterday after
the last student had quietly departed,
the office doors were closed tight.
Inside were the same stock pile of
packages, the numerous pouches
ready for delivery next, day, and a
general feeling that perhaps Cal
lahan was right.
"Everywhere we look, everything
we handle means only one thing to
me. Maybe Christmas has come a
little early!"


BERT QUINN, Stanford Post Office clerk, is in the process of doing
a daily task, that of distributing the mail for a section of the office's
1,8.13 postal boxes.
