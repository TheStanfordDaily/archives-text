# Largest Grain Markets Act on Truman Request
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (UP). —President Truman asked the
nation's major grain market to raise their margin requirements to
non-speculation levels today and three of the largest—the Chi
cago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis exchanges -quickly com
plied with his request.
All three agreed to double their margins to per cent of the total
purchase price in an effort to prevent grain speculators from profiteering
on the European hunger crisis. The increases are effective tomorrow.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest grain market, was
the first to grant Mr. Truman's request. The Chicago exchange usually
sets the pattei n for the other marts, and the Minneapolis and Kansas City
exchanges quickly followed its example.
Mr. Truman's instructions were telegraphed to officials of the 10 major
grain exchanges by the Commodity Exchange Commission. Although it
was in the form of a "request," it was unmistakably clear the President's
suggestion was to be considered as an order.
The Chicago Board of Trade recently adopted a sliding scale of margins,
but the Administration said that this was not sufficient to keep speculators
out of the market.
