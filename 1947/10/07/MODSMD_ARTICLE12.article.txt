Labor President William Green today sounded the keynote of the
! AFL's national convention by calling for outright repeal of the
Taft-Hartley Law and defeat of every member of congress who

answer those charges in 1948.

the convention to establish election
day, .15)48, as a holiday, so the work

"We have the votes," he said. "If
we can only got them to the ballot

boxes, there can he no doubt of the
outcome of the elections."
Green warned industry against
attempts to destroy organized labor
by legislation, claiming ihat those
who have oppressed labor in other
countries have at the same time suc
ceeded in bringing about the down
hill of organized labor.
