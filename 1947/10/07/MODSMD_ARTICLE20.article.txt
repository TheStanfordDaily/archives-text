# 'Crossfire' Misfires; Plot Misses Source of Hatred
## 
### 
"Crossfire" is a film about which there has been a good deal
of excited comment lately, and, in some instances, the praise
which the picture has received is well deserved. But if one pokes
beneath the highly polished surface of this tight, compact little
drama, the shallow foundation upon which it is built becomes

exposed.
The film concerns itself with the
problems of racial prejudice set
against a background of war-bred
passions and hatreds which have
suddenly lost their target and which
begin to batter furiously against all
Ihe old scape-goats.
SHOWS HACK HATRED
Anti-Semitism provides the main
object of the racial hatred here, and
it is summed-up in the blind, vi
cious hatred of an Army sergeant
for Jews.
"Crossfire" tackles the deeply -
rooted problem with all the sincer
ity in the world, but in this case
good intentions aren't enough. If
the purpose of the picture were to
remind us that the issue of preju
dice is still a burning one, we would
have no quarrel with its makers.
NOT A CUKE
But in these troubled times, the
essential thing is to understand the
question involved, and try to dis
cover the wherefore of hatred. If
the issue is not understood, it will
not be cured.
The case against prejudice is
stated far too simply in "Crossfire,"
and much of the point is lost in
this rapid-fire, hard-hitting story
of a Jew's murder and the search for
his killer. It has frequently been
the fault of American film-makers
to state their themes in glaring
black and while and then to hide
their heads in the box-office. Many
extraneous elements have been in
troduced into the film and serve
only to distract the interest from
the main issue.
LACKS EMPHASIS
It is too bad that RKO thought
they had to have a cleverly con
trived story to support their preach
ment on racial prejudice. It would
have been far more effective if they
had given more care to the subtle
shadings and complexities of why
one man hates another.
Robert Ryan gives a terrifying
performance as the soldier domin
ated by hate. He is so convincing
that you overlook the one-sided
ness of his personality. He pre
sents prejudice as being mere blind
brutality, and we are given to be
lieve that race hatred is only a
matter of how hard a sledge-ham
mer can hit. The fault is not Ryan's,
but that of the picture.
All in all, the film is about as
subtle as an article in Pravda, but
it is certainly one of the better items
in the regular crop of trivia.—Kee

problems of racial prejudice set
against a background of war-bred
passions and hatreds which have
suddenly lost their target and which
begin to batter furiously against all
Ihe old scape-goats.
SHOWS HACK HATRED
Anti-Semitism provides the main
object of the racial hatred here, and
it is summed-up in the blind, vi
cious hatred of an Army sergeant
for Jews.
"Crossfire" tackles the deeply -
rooted problem with all the sincer
ity in the world, but in this case
good intentions aren't enough. If
the purpose of the picture were to
remind us that the issue of preju
dice is still a burning one, we would
have no quarrel with its makers.
NOT A CUKE
But in these troubled times, the
essential thing is to understand the
question involved, and try to dis
cover the wherefore of hatred. If
the issue is not understood, it will
not be cured.
The case against prejudice is
stated far too simply in "Crossfire,"
and much of the point is lost in
this rapid-fire, hard-hitting story
of a Jew's murder and the search for
his killer. It has frequently been
the fault of American film-makers
to state their themes in glaring
black and while and then to hide
their heads in the box-office. Many
extraneous elements have been in
troduced into the film and serve
only to distract the interest from
the main issue.
LACKS EMPHASIS
It is too bad that RKO thought
they had to have a cleverly con
trived story to support their preach
ment on racial prejudice. It would
have been far more effective if they
had given more care to the subtle
shadings and complexities of why
one man hates another.
Robert Ryan gives a terrifying
performance as the soldier domin
ated by hate. He is so convincing
that you overlook the one-sided
ness of his personality. He pre
sents prejudice as being mere blind
brutality, and we are given to be
lieve that race hatred is only a
matter of how hard a sledge-ham
mer can hit. The fault is not Ryan's,
but that of the picture.
All in all, the film is about as
subtle as an article in Pravda, but
it is certainly one of the better items
in the regular crop of trivia.—Kee

"Crossfire" is a film about which there has been a good deal
of excited comment lately, and, in some instances, the praise
which the picture has received is well deserved. But if one pokes
beneath the highly polished surface of this tight, compact little
drama, the shallow foundation upon which it is built becomes

exposed.
