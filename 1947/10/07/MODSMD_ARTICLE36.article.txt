# Bronx Bombers Win Series Finale, 5-2; Relief Hurler Page Stills Dodger Bats
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 6 (UP). — The New York Yankees won the J
World Series today when two of their old pros, fireman Joe Page
and big Tommy Henrich, came through in the clutch and finally
flattened the battling Brooklyn Dodgers, 5 to 2, in the seventh ;
and deciding game.
In the climactic game of the bitterly fought, fantastic Series 1

Which saw the embattled underdogs
from Flat bush come up off the floor
time anil time again, big Tommy
slashed a fourth-inning single with
the bases loaded that provided the
ultimate margin of victory.
And Page, with $75,000 riding on

every pitch, went to the hill in relief
in the fifth before a roaring crowd
of 71,548 baseball fanatics and shut
the desperate Dodgers out all the
rest of the way.
MacPHAIL RETIRES
Another sensation came just as
the game ended when Larry Mac-
Phail, talkative, red-headed presi
dent of the Yankees, announced his
retirement from baseball. He said
he was leaving on his own free will
for his own reasons but his an
nouncement recalled his several
embroilments with Baseball Com
missioner A. B, (Happy) Chandler
during the season.
The burly Joe Page had sat away
out there in the right field bull pen
through four frantic innings. And
he had seen the Dodgers jump into
the lead off the deliveries of two of
his mates.
But then Henrich put the Yanks

in front, and they sounded the alarm
for old Joe.
PAGE COMES RUNNING
He came a-running and had just
what they needed.
Through the fifth, the sixth, the
seventh and the eighth the battling
Bums came up to the plate swinging
bats which looked as big as violins.
But the cool, calculating Page went
into his windup and fired the baf
fling change of pace ball which had
won 14 games for him during the
regular season and saved another
dozen for the Bombers.
So the Dodgers went down in or
der, without getting anything close
to a hit—until the ninth. And then
it looked as if maybe old Joe was
going to get the same treatment
which had brought the Dodgers up
from the canvas in yesterday's
game.
MIKSIS BREAKS SPELL
For with one away, young Eddie
Miksis belted a single to center, and
the crowd filled the stadium with
its roaring encouragement to the
courageous Dodgers. But that didn't
bother Page. He sent down his
curve ball and husky Bruce Ed
wards, who had gotten two hits in a
row before Joe went to the hill,
clouted into a game-ending double
play.
Little Scooter Rizzuto came up
with the ball, flipped it to George
Stirnweiss, and the little second
baseman fired it over to George Mc-
Quinn. The new world champions
swarmed off the bench and carried
Page from the park.
Page's relief job. which made him
the winner, meant plenty to the
Yankees. For besides the fame of
being kings of the baseball world,
this was the richest World Series of
them all and the difference in the
two player pools came close to $75,-
000.
HEART-BREAKING FINISH
It was a heart-breaking finish for
the battling Bums. They had drop
ped the first two games, squared it
up at Ebbets Field, but dropped the
fifth game in their home lot. Re
turning to the stadium yesterday
they once more fought even—and
then began today's game with a lead
that made it look like they would
win.
So ended what started out to be
one of the worst World Series on
record and wound up as one of the
best.

the crowd filled the stadium with
its roaring encouragement to the
courageous Dodgers. But that didn't
bother Page. He sent down his
curve ball and husky Bruce Ed
wards, who had gotten two hits in a
row before Joe went to the hill,
clouted into a game-ending double
play.
Little Scooter Rizzuto came up
with the ball, flipped it to George
Stirnweiss, and the little second
baseman fired it over to George Mc-
Quinn. The new world champions
swarmed off the bench and carried
Page from the park.
Page's relief job. which made him
the winner, meant plenty to the
Yankees. For besides the fame of
being kings of the baseball world,
this was the richest World Series of
them all and the difference in the
two player pools came close to $75,-
000.
HEART-BREAKING FINISH
It was a heart-breaking finish for
the battling Bums. They had drop
ped the first two games, squared it
up at Ebbets Field, but dropped the
fifth game in their home lot. Re
turning to the stadium yesterday
they once more fought even—and
then began today's game with a lead
that made it look like they would
win.
So ended what started out to be
one of the worst World Series on
record and wound up as one of the
best.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6 (UP). — The New York Yankees won the J
World Series today when two of their old pros, fireman Joe Page
and big Tommy Henrich, came through in the clutch and finally
flattened the battling Brooklyn Dodgers, 5 to 2, in the seventh ;
and deciding game.
In the climactic game of the bitterly fought, fantastic Series 1

Which saw the embattled underdogs
from Flat bush come up off the floor
time anil time again, big Tommy
slashed a fourth-inning single with
the bases loaded that provided the
ultimate margin of victory.
And Page, with $75,000 riding on

every pitch, went to the hill in relief
in the fifth before a roaring crowd
of 71,548 baseball fanatics and shut
the desperate Dodgers out all the
rest of the way.
MacPHAIL RETIRES
Another sensation came just as
the game ended when Larry Mac-
Phail, talkative, red-headed presi
dent of the Yankees, announced his
retirement from baseball. He said
he was leaving on his own free will
for his own reasons but his an
nouncement recalled his several
embroilments with Baseball Com
missioner A. B, (Happy) Chandler
during the season.
The burly Joe Page had sat away
out there in the right field bull pen
through four frantic innings. And
he had seen the Dodgers jump into
the lead off the deliveries of two of
his mates.
But then Henrich put the Yanks

in front, and they sounded the alarm
for old Joe.
PAGE COMES RUNNING
He came a-running and had just
what they needed.
Through the fifth, the sixth, the
seventh and the eighth the battling
Bums came up to the plate swinging
bats which looked as big as violins.
But the cool, calculating Page went
into his windup and fired the baf
fling change of pace ball which had
won 14 games for him during the
regular season and saved another
dozen for the Bombers.
So the Dodgers went down in or
der, without getting anything close
to a hit—until the ninth. And then
it looked as if maybe old Joe was
going to get the same treatment
which had brought the Dodgers up
from the canvas in yesterday's
game.
MIKSIS BREAKS SPELL
For with one away, young Eddie
Miksis belted a single to center, and
the crowd filled the stadium with
its roaring encouragement to the
courageous Dodgers. But that didn't
bother Page. He sent down his
curve ball and husky Bruce Ed
wards, who had gotten two hits in a
row before Joe went to the hill,
clouted into a game-ending double
