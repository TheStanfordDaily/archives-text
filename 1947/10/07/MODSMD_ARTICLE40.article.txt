# Cardinals Near Home in High Spirits, Look Forward to Santa Clara Game
## 
### FRED WEINTZ Senior Football Manager 
ABOARD CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, OGDEN, Utah, Oct. 6,-.Despite
their convincing setback Saturday, the Stanford footballers are in good
spirits and rarin' to go against the Broncos as they return from Ann Arbor.
Team members feel that although the first eight minutes of the Michi
gan game were a nightmare, they partially made up for it in the second

half by their greatly improved of
fensive and defensive work. They
point out that Stanford outscored
the Wolverines in the last two quar
ters, playing against Michigan's first
and second teams some of the time.
Atherton Phleger, first - string
right tackle, spoke for many when
he said that he enjoyed playing
against Michigan. "They are a great
team," he said. "We learned a lot
playing against them, and I half
wish they had let Chappuis and the
rest play the whole game. Wistert
was the best lineman on the field
and that Ford was terrific too."
Every member of the 37 - man

traveling squad, save Bob Ander
j son and George Quist, played in the
: game, and they all gained valuable
j experience.
The opinion of some observers is
that the Stanford team which fin
' ished the game was a far different
squad from the one that started it.
And the team can be confident
that no game they play this year
will be any tougher than the Ann
Arbor affair. Most of the coast teams
will look relatively easy to the In
dians after this one.
The team arrives in Palo Alto at
1 12:17 p.m. today.
