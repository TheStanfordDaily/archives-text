# Lunny Greets 25 Aspirants
## 
### 
Ray Lunny, Stanford's new box
ing coach, welcomed 25 boxers into
the fold as initial signups were com
pleted for the '47-'4B Indian boxing
varsity.
Returning from last season's ag
gregation are Elia Long and Joe
Cranmer, light-heavyweights; Fred
Ten Eyck, middleweight; Pete Wil
lett and Willie Altus, welterweights;
and Bill Edwards, heavyweight.
These six returning lettermen will
form a good nucleus for this year's
squad, but Coach Lunny emphasizes
that a number of new men, particu
larly in the lighter weight divisions,
will be required if the Farm team
is to win many matches this season.
Lunny, who reigned as California
state lightweight champion before
he retired from the ring in 1943,
will be assisted in his coaching
chores by Mai Mynderse, former
Stanford boxer.
Tentative plans are in the making
for a novice tournament to be held
toward the end of autumn quarter.
Any beginning boxer is eligible to
compete.
