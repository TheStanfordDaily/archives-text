# Common Sense Can Prevent Fire
## 
### 
Stanford's Public Enemy Number One is
the careless smoker.
A large part of campus fires can be traced
to the casual cigarette dropped into a waste
paper basket or the indiscriminate match
thrown from a car.
Fire Chief John M. Marston and his Stan
ford Fire Department are joining with organi
zations throughout the nation in the observ
ance of Fire Prevention Week, proclaimed by
President Truman for the week of October
5-11.
Chief Marston has warm praise for the co
operation his department has always received
from students, but at the same time he urges
that the student body as a whole double its
efforts to prevent needless loss of life and
property from fire.
A dormitory fire at this time would be
doubly disastrous. Not only would there be
possible loss of life, but a number of students
would be deprived of a place to live. One
careless smoker at Encina, Roble, a Village
building, or a Row house could deal a serious
blow to the already critical housing situation.
Vigilance of the campus fire department,
coupled with student cooperation cut the 1946-
1947 fire toll to $1,983.43, one of the lowest

figures in recent years. Continued coopera
tion will cut this year's figures even lower.
While the campus fire situation is under
control, the national picture is startling, with
fire loss figures running 300 per cent over the
1937 figures.
The anticipated 1947 fire loss will reach over
700 million dollars, while more than 11 thou
sand people will lose their lives in fires.
The money lost through fires every year is
enough to pay the wages of the working
population of the city of Oakland for two years,
while time lost on the job because of fires
would build one million badly-needed auto
mobiles.
Fire is dealing a crippling blow to the hous
ing crisis; nearly 1,000 American homes are de
stroyed by fire every day.
The real tragedy of these figures is brought
into sharp focus when it is realized that more
than 90 per cent of all fires in which Americans
are dying and suffering, and in which their
homes, factories, and stores are being de
stroyed, can easily be prevented. Careless
ness and indifference —the"it can't happen to
me attitude" —are the chief causes.
Common sense is the first line of defense
against fire.—D.D.

coupled with student cooperation cut the 1946-
1947 fire toll to $1,983.43, one of the lowest

figures in recent years. Continued coopera
tion will cut this year's figures even lower.
While the campus fire situation is under
control, the national picture is startling, with
fire loss figures running 300 per cent over the
1937 figures.
The anticipated 1947 fire loss will reach over
700 million dollars, while more than 11 thou
sand people will lose their lives in fires.
The money lost through fires every year is
enough to pay the wages of the working
population of the city of Oakland for two years,
while time lost on the job because of fires
would build one million badly-needed auto
mobiles.
Fire is dealing a crippling blow to the hous
ing crisis; nearly 1,000 American homes are de
stroyed by fire every day.
The real tragedy of these figures is brought
into sharp focus when it is realized that more
than 90 per cent of all fires in which Americans
are dying and suffering, and in which their
homes, factories, and stores are being de
stroyed, can easily be prevented. Careless
ness and indifference —the"it can't happen to
me attitude" —are the chief causes.
Common sense is the first line of defense
against fire.—D.D.
Stanford's Public Enemy Number One is
the careless smoker.
A large part of campus fires can be traced
to the casual cigarette dropped into a waste
paper basket or the indiscriminate match
thrown from a car.
Fire Chief John M. Marston and his Stan
ford Fire Department are joining with organi
zations throughout the nation in the observ
ance of Fire Prevention Week, proclaimed by
President Truman for the week of October
5-11.
Chief Marston has warm praise for the co
operation his department has always received
from students, but at the same time he urges
that the student body as a whole double its
efforts to prevent needless loss of life and
property from fire.
A dormitory fire at this time would be
doubly disastrous. Not only would there be
possible loss of life, but a number of students
would be deprived of a place to live. One
careless smoker at Encina, Roble, a Village
building, or a Row house could deal a serious
blow to the already critical housing situation.
