### WAYNE SARGENT 
I wonder what ever happened to the football yell
floating around here last year that went: "Fight
fiercely; struggle, struggle. Stow 'em in the teepee—
ugh, ugh!" Every so often one of these gridiron
miscarriages pops up like: "City college, city college,
the institute of health and knowledge—chess, check
ers, and shufileboard—rah, rah!"
I don't know, maybe it's all right. Maybe I've
got the wrong kind of fighting spirit.
You take a yell like "How do you like your
oysters—raw, raw, raw!" See what I mean. It lacks
virility.
My nomination for yells that never should have
been is, "Rattle, rattle, rattle, pop-corn-bag!"
Speaking of the aspects of football that do not
directly concern the players, I want to be the first
this season to voice protest against the seating ar
rangement in the stadium. This is no official critic
ism of the Rally Com by The Stanford Daily, merely
my own opinion. Let the women, bless their long
sskirts, wave their pom poms in my eyes, I don't
mind. At the Idaho game, my girl was the only one

of the two of us that had enough cash to buy a bottle,
and I had to sit with her. You didn't think of that
possibility, did you? I could have worn my wedgies
with the built in hot plates, but that's a poor way
of keeping warm.
By the time the two of us got seats together we
were so high (geographically speaking) that I was
getting spirit messages.
There's an old gag about the Rally Com issuing
oxygen masks to people seated in the top few rows.
True or not, I don't know, but when I hit row 120
my nose started to bleed. I saw a few inches of space
that looked as though it might be made into room
for two, so I asked a gentleman if he would move
over. He asked me to shut up. He didn't, and I did,
and the seat I finally got was on the rim of the
stadium. That's too high. I'm not complaining, but
the guy next to me was flying the mail to Denver.
All in all I still like football. It's the only season
of the year when you can walk down the street with
a girl on one arm, a blanket on the other, and no
one looks at you suspiciously.

and I had to sit with her. You didn't think of that
possibility, did you? I could have worn my wedgies
with the built in hot plates, but that's a poor way
of keeping warm.
By the time the two of us got seats together we
were so high (geographically speaking) that I was
getting spirit messages.
There's an old gag about the Rally Com issuing
oxygen masks to people seated in the top few rows.
True or not, I don't know, but when I hit row 120
my nose started to bleed. I saw a few inches of space
that looked as though it might be made into room
for two, so I asked a gentleman if he would move
over. He asked me to shut up. He didn't, and I did,
and the seat I finally got was on the rim of the
stadium. That's too high. I'm not complaining, but
the guy next to me was flying the mail to Denver.
All in all I still like football. It's the only season
of the year when you can walk down the street with
a girl on one arm, a blanket on the other, and no
one looks at you suspiciously.
I wonder what ever happened to the football yell
floating around here last year that went: "Fight
fiercely; struggle, struggle. Stow 'em in the teepee—
ugh, ugh!" Every so often one of these gridiron
miscarriages pops up like: "City college, city college,
the institute of health and knowledge—chess, check
ers, and shufileboard—rah, rah!"
I don't know, maybe it's all right. Maybe I've
got the wrong kind of fighting spirit.
You take a yell like "How do you like your
oysters—raw, raw, raw!" See what I mean. It lacks
virility.
My nomination for yells that never should have
been is, "Rattle, rattle, rattle, pop-corn-bag!"
Speaking of the aspects of football that do not
directly concern the players, I want to be the first
this season to voice protest against the seating ar
rangement in the stadium. This is no official critic
ism of the Rally Com by The Stanford Daily, merely
my own opinion. Let the women, bless their long
sskirts, wave their pom poms in my eyes, I don't
mind. At the Idaho game, my girl was the only one

of the two of us that had enough cash to buy a bottle,
and I had to sit with her. You didn't think of that
possibility, did you? I could have worn my wedgies
with the built in hot plates, but that's a poor way
of keeping warm.
