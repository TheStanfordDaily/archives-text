[I is impossible not to sympathize with the people
of Europe. Many of them eat less in a day than we eat
for breakfast. The great majority of them live in
poverty, hunger, and dirt.
Leaving Christian sentiments aside, we must
still help them, for a hungry and insecure Europe
would sooner or later lead to a hungry and insecure
America.
However, there are certain things we ought to
watch if we don't want to waste vast sums of money.
First, we should require the governments of
England, France, Italy, and the other nations in the
Marshall Plan to use all possible means of self-help.
This they have steadfastly refused to do up to now.
For instance, Europeans own six billion dollars
worth of our securities.
These are lying idly, profiting only an insignifi
cant minority. The governments could take them
and sell them to us for six billion dollars worth of
food.
French fashion designers are forcing both their
own people and us to spend millions for new ward
to lies. Without now considering questions of beauty,
we should inform these people that if they have
enough money for new dresses they can also buy
their own food.
Essential to any successful aid program is the
stopping of black markets. Reports from all coun
tries, except England, show that plenty of food and

clothing is available —for a price. While Tony Min
elli, Italian, wonders where his next day's spaghetti
will come from, a few unscrupulous characters are,
us usual, benefiting from the misfortunes of the
many Tonys.
11 we cannot gel this safeguard and assure fair
and efficient administration of relief, a heavy propor
tion of our aid will never reach those for whom it
is intended.
We should cut grain speculation in this country
to a minimum. Within the last few weeks people
could and did- triple their investment through mar
gin buying. We feel the effects in higher and higher
prices. Not only European but American profiteers
must be stopped.
Lastly, we have announced our intention of using
food as a political weapon by giving it only to those
whose governments meet our approval.
One cannot but wonder how impressed the people
of these countries will be with our politics in view
of our selling arms to Peron, whom even the State
Department recognizes as a Latin American Hitler,
aiding a tyrannical Chinese bandit, and supporting
governments in Spain, Greece, and Turkey that
cannot be called democratic by the largest stretch
of the imagination.
Throughout the world people are somewhat puz
zled at our new technique of strengthening demo
cracy by aiding dictatorship.

Leaving Christian sentiments aside, we must
still help them, for a hungry and insecure Europe
would sooner or later lead to a hungry and insecure
America.
However, there are certain things we ought to
watch if we don't want to waste vast sums of money.
First, we should require the governments of
England, France, Italy, and the other nations in the
Marshall Plan to use all possible means of self-help.
This they have steadfastly refused to do up to now.
For instance, Europeans own six billion dollars
worth of our securities.
These are lying idly, profiting only an insignifi
cant minority. The governments could take them
and sell them to us for six billion dollars worth of
food.
French fashion designers are forcing both their
own people and us to spend millions for new ward
to lies. Without now considering questions of beauty,
we should inform these people that if they have
enough money for new dresses they can also buy
their own food.
Essential to any successful aid program is the
stopping of black markets. Reports from all coun
tries, except England, show that plenty of food and

clothing is available —for a price. While Tony Min
elli, Italian, wonders where his next day's spaghetti
will come from, a few unscrupulous characters are,
us usual, benefiting from the misfortunes of the
many Tonys.
11 we cannot gel this safeguard and assure fair
and efficient administration of relief, a heavy propor
tion of our aid will never reach those for whom it
is intended.
We should cut grain speculation in this country
to a minimum. Within the last few weeks people
could and did- triple their investment through mar
gin buying. We feel the effects in higher and higher
prices. Not only European but American profiteers
must be stopped.
Lastly, we have announced our intention of using
food as a political weapon by giving it only to those
whose governments meet our approval.
One cannot but wonder how impressed the people
of these countries will be with our politics in view
of our selling arms to Peron, whom even the State
Department recognizes as a Latin American Hitler,
aiding a tyrannical Chinese bandit, and supporting
governments in Spain, Greece, and Turkey that
cannot be called democratic by the largest stretch
of the imagination.
Throughout the world people are somewhat puz
zled at our new technique of strengthening demo
cracy by aiding dictatorship.
[I is impossible not to sympathize with the people
of Europe. Many of them eat less in a day than we eat
for breakfast. The great majority of them live in
poverty, hunger, and dirt.
