# Row Gives Annual Financial Report
## 
### 
All but one of Stanford's 24 fra
ternity houses had an excess of in
come over expenses for the year's
operation, according to a report
submitted yesterday to the Inter
l'raternity Council by Warren Tur
ner, auditor. Any excess will be
used in part, for keeping the houses
and furniture in Rood repair, and in
part against future possible losses.
Eleven of the houses ended up
the year with no unpaid bills from
house members, and 10 of the re
maining houses had less than $150
owing in unpaid bills. None of the
fraternities has any outstanding
current obligations to local mer
chants, and each of them has money
in the bank, the total for the 24 fra
ternities being $40,673.33, an aver
age of $1,027 each, either in savings
or commercial accounts.
