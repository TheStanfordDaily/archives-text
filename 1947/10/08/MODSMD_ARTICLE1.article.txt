### 
(The Daily presents the t<-xt of I)r. Donald It, Tresidtier's address,
"No Freedom for the Weak," delivered yesterday morning before an all
campus assebly in Memorial Auditorium.)
Men and women of Stanford. On behalf of the faculty I am filad to
welcome all of you to Stanford. Today, with 8,18!) students enrolled, we
have the largest registration in our history. In this we are not unique.
Before the war our colleges and universities had about 1,600,000. Today,
with an unprecedented registration of 2,500,000 students, they are all
bursting at the seams. We are acutely aware of the dislocations that are
the inevitable consequence of our own rapid expansion, but with the Stan
ford Village and a campus that is an integral part of a 9,000 acre farm,
we are more fortunate than many of our sister institutions. 1 cherish the
memory of Stanford of twenty-five years ago with its student body of
2,000, but I am immensely proud of the Stanford which has moved so
boldly to do its full share in this educational crisis.
ACADEMIC STANDARDS IIIGH
Never have we had a better opportunity to select highly qualified stu
dents. The standard of academic work at Stanford has never been higher.
The faculty have spared no effort to see that every one of you possesses
both the ability to do university work and a serious intention to make the
most of your educational opportunities here. 11, despite our lx;st efforts
wi have erred in any instance, we urge you to steal away quietly into the
night. The times are too critical to countenance any efforts except your
best.
We live here together on the farm in an atmosphere of harmony and
peaceful pastoral beauty, but none of us can wholly escape the impact of
the confusion, doubt, and premonition of new disasters that have developed
since V-J Day.
In World War II when we fought for our lives we were a united
nation. Our purposes were clear, and cooperation with our allies was
easy. Today we have little more than an armed truce in many countries.
Our dream of one world i.i slowly dissolving in the face of the growing
schism between Russia and ourselves. The foreign news about ourselves
is not reassuring. In some parts of the world we are viewed with sus
picion, Fear and even hatred. Even as we extend generous aid in the

dillicull task of restoring libraries, laboratories and educational plants
abroad we hear whispered charges of American cultural imperialism.
All is not well on the home front either. The end of the war has seen
a return in aggravated form of the ailments which plagued us in the period
between the two world wars. Our industrialization was accompanied by
mass unemployment, racial tensions, class hatred and extensive social
disorganization. Strong minority groups influenced our government to an
alarming extent. Cynicism and confusion were widespread. Local and
state governments were unable or unwilling to cope with our economic
problems with the result that there was a vast extension of federal power
over our affairs.
Every thoughtful American is coming to realize that we are in deadly
peril from two directions. Both dangers must be overcome if we are to
retain the freedom which distinguishes us from most of the rest of the
world today. Our first and most important task is to cooperate in the early
establishment of a stable peace. In this effort, whether we like it or not, we
are cast in a major role, possibly even a decisive one, and no discourage
ment must be permitted to turn us against cooperating with all people of
good will in the restoration of order and freedom in the world.
DANGER AT HOME
The second danger to which I have referred is here at home. Our
economic aliments are severe, and the American pople will not be denied
a satisfactory solution indefinitely. During the past fifty years the trend
toward collectivism in the world has been unmistakable. Will we in
America be forced to go down that road in the end? Excluding the
paramount problem of war, this is the sixty-four dollar question of our
generation. Can we maintain a prosperous American economy with just
and fair benefits to our citizens and still preserve the freedoms that we
have always enjoyed? If we can, then we need not fear the subversive
activities of Communist groups in this country. If we cannot, then sub
versive efforts from abroad will not be required for us to embrace col
lectivism.
No one can doubt that our present undertaking demands the exertions
of our full national strength. This strength is not exclusively a matter
of military power, industrial might and wealth. It rests primarily upon

the health, unity, and character of our citizens. Tension and disunity lead
to disintegration and collapse. Before we can hope to exercise our full
power and influence abroad we must cast out the mote in our own eye.
We must be strong.
STANFORD IN FRONT LINE
In this critical hour Stanford is in the front line trenches fighting
squarely on the side of freedom and the preservation of our democracy.
By freedom I do not mean an absolute unrestricted riyht to exploit the
weak or to act in one's selfish interest without restrain. I speak of free
dom to think, to discuss, to worship and to act responsibly. In theory, at
least, and we hope in practice as well, we are training an intellectual
elite for the task of responsible leadership in our democracy in the years
ahead. We expect, of course, to provide you with the special tools which
you require lor your special occupation in life, but we will have failed in
our primary purpose if you do not go forth as a free citizen determined
to do your part for the common welfare.
By what plan does Stanford expect to accomplish this aim? Time per
mits no exploration of formal curriculum and subject matter. 1 deal
here with only one aspect of the plan. First of all, your faculty believes
profoundly in the American way of life. We have differing political views.
Some of us are left of center and some are far to the right in social phil
osophy. This is as it should be. Freedom advocates a different point of
view. Diversity of beliefs are essential elements in a university, but on
the question of whether we cherish freedom, restrained only by common
welfare, you will find us all united.
We are concerned not alone with the knowledge to be gained from
books, lectures, and laboratory exercises, indispensable as such knowledge
is. There is another kind of knowing equally invaluable that is much more
difficult to acquire. It is derived from experience, from actual trial and
error and from close observation of people. Stanford has spared no effort in
its attempt to facilitate the acquisition of this knowledge of experience by
its students.
It was pursuant to this plan that the faculty delegated to its students
the management of their affairs. The Honor Code stems from this same
desire to have the students gain knowledge of experience. Now I realize

there are times when students feel they do not have absolute freedom of
action. On the other hand, we faculty sometimes feel that we hear more
from you about your "rights" and privileges than we do about your
serious responsibilities. On the whole, however, I think we all agree that
the student government here is a success.
A college community moves and acts in the spirit of the times. We see
reflected here in minor degree all the weaknesses and strengths of our
democracy. Many students are indifferent to their own government,
springing into action only when they are affected personally. Some con
fine their group participation to their own house or to a special sport or a
specialized activity. This is your privilege but I suggest that by failing
to participate in the broad purposes of the University you are missing an
opportunity to acquire insight into human nature, to develop social skills
and to practice self restraint. You will spend some of your formative
years with us. You have the time to study, to explore fields of interest
and to test your aptitude.
CRYSTALIZE AMBITIONS
Here you can develop an interest in art and music and recreation.
There is a rich opportunity to give and receive criticism, to discuss affairs
with scholars and fellow students. These should be the years in which you
crystallize your life ambitions and develop a philosophy of living. Stanford
can supply the faculty, the educational plant, and appropriate surround
ings. Only you can supply the incentive, the seriousness of purpose.
What is the ideal Stanford graduate whom we envision? 1 picture him
or her as a person with a great, zest for life, skilled in communication
with his fellows, self-disciplined and responsible. He is able to assemble
facts and to interpret them accurately. With these facts in hand he is
able to develop a plan of action with several alternatives in reserve. Out
graduate is trained "to see life steadily and to see it whole," yet. he is
fully armed against disillusionment and cynicism. He tempers sober
realism with tolerance and a generous understanding of human nature. He
is discriminating in his tastes and his judgement of values. Above all else
he cherishes freedom. Such a man or woman is fully armed to take his
place as a working member of our society. He is strong. There is no
freedom for the weak.
