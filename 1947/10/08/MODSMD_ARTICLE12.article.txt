# 'Frosh Bible' Expands To Four Times Old Size, Presents Survey of Stanford Activities, Traditions
## 
### RUTH DIMICK 
The "Frosh Bible" has grown up.
Now including pictures of student
body officers and campus resi
dences, the new book for freshman
orientation is four times as large
as any in the past and includes a
more complete coverage of campus
news and traditions.
The readers will have to concen
trate on the inside, however, instead
of admiring the cover, since a grey
paper binding has replaced the tra
ditional white composition covering.
Gordon Johnson, who handled
publication of the booklet this year,
explained that in the past one-half
the cost of printing the "Bible" went

into the cover. This year the com
mittee felt that the money could
be better spent on pictures of scenes
around the Farm and cartoons of
the Indians in action.
ORGANIZATIONS DESCRIBED
Complete coverage of student, ac
tivities in an "outside the class
room" section includes a description
of all official campus publications,
international institutes, YWCA
groups, music, radio, and dramatic
departments, religious organiza
tions, committees, and clubs func
tioning at Stanford. Purposes of the
groups, work done, and qualifica
tions for joining each activity are
included. In addition student lead

ers of each group for the year are
listed.
Realizing that students spend
much of their time away from the
books and extra-curricular activi
ties, the "Bible" committee included
a description of campus recreation
spots and nearby places of relaxa
tion.
DIAGRAM INCLUDED
An animated map of the entire
Farm, naming all student resi
dences, Quad buildings, and other
campus locations, covers the middle
two pages of the book.
Sections on campus traditions, of
ficial regulations, student govern
ment organizations, sports, and

school songs and yells arc also in
eluded in the 80-page "Bible."
Since the booklet answers many
questions which every new member
of the Family asks, such as what to
wear and what to do on his first day
at Stanford, copies were sent to all
new students before they arrived on
the Farm. In the past the books
have been distributed just before
Reg Day.
Seven hundred copies of the
"Bible" are left, but the ASSU com
mittee has not yet decided whether
to save these for students entering
winter or spring quarter, or to dis
tribute them to students already on
campus.

DIAGRAM INCLUDED
An animated map of the entire
Farm, naming all student resi
dences, Quad buildings, and other
campus locations, covers the middle
two pages of the book.
Sections on campus traditions, of
ficial regulations, student govern
ment organizations, sports, and

school songs and yells arc also in
eluded in the 80-page "Bible."
Since the booklet answers many
questions which every new member
of the Family asks, such as what to
wear and what to do on his first day
at Stanford, copies were sent to all
new students before they arrived on
the Farm. In the past the books
have been distributed just before
Reg Day.
Seven hundred copies of the
"Bible" are left, but the ASSU com
mittee has not yet decided whether
to save these for students entering
winter or spring quarter, or to dis
tribute them to students already on
campus.
The "Frosh Bible" has grown up.
Now including pictures of student
body officers and campus resi
dences, the new book for freshman
orientation is four times as large
as any in the past and includes a
more complete coverage of campus
news and traditions.
The readers will have to concen
trate on the inside, however, instead
of admiring the cover, since a grey
paper binding has replaced the tra
ditional white composition covering.
Gordon Johnson, who handled
publication of the booklet this year,
explained that in the past one-half
the cost of printing the "Bible" went

into the cover. This year the com
mittee felt that the money could
be better spent on pictures of scenes
around the Farm and cartoons of
the Indians in action.
ORGANIZATIONS DESCRIBED
Complete coverage of student, ac
tivities in an "outside the class
room" section includes a description
of all official campus publications,
international institutes, YWCA
groups, music, radio, and dramatic
departments, religious organiza
tions, committees, and clubs func
tioning at Stanford. Purposes of the
groups, work done, and qualifica
tions for joining each activity are
included. In addition student lead

ers of each group for the year are
listed.
Realizing that students spend
much of their time away from the
books and extra-curricular activi
ties, the "Bible" committee included
a description of campus recreation
spots and nearby places of relaxa
tion.
