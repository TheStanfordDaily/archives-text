# Farm Follows Nation In Meatless Menus
## 
### STU FITCH 
University dining halls will follow the nation with meatless
Tuesdays and poultry-less, eggless Thursdays, Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls and Stanford Union, said yester
day.
■This means Union, Roble, Branner, Encina, Lagunita, the

Cellar, and Stanford Village have
taken up the fight and cut out the
scarce items, listed by President
Truman, on two of their daily
menus.
Initial action took place last night
at living group house meetings when
Stanford students patted their tum
mies after a good roast beef dinner
and decided it could tide them over
for a couple of days.
Student co-operation and decision
to adopt the plan was voiced by all
students in University dorms, said
Miss Ricker. She reminds student
eaters the move does not mean re
straint of hunger at any prepared
meal, as the cutting down will be
taken care of in food planning.
EAT THAT BREAD'
"So, that extra piece of bread sit
ting on the plate might as well be
eaten up; it is just if the bread isn't
there that the saving is taking
place," she said.
The use of eggs in cooking will
continue on the eggless days, said
Miss Ricker, and the only loss to
student appetites will be felt in the
lack of individual egg servings.
. INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
Decision on the Row to adopt the
Truman Plan has been left up t'»
the individual houses, where the
men seem to be talcing the lead.
Eight of (he fraternities have al
ready decided on meatless, fowl

future swing.

MISS CHRISTINE KICKER,
dining room director.
University dining halls will follow the nation with meatless
Tuesdays and poultry-less, eggless Thursdays, Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls and Stanford Union, said yester
day.
■This means Union, Roble, Branner, Encina, Lagunita, the

Cellar, and Stanford Village have
taken up the fight and cut out the
scarce items, listed by President
Truman, on two of their daily
menus.
Initial action took place last night
at living group house meetings when
Stanford students patted their tum
mies after a good roast beef dinner
and decided it could tide them over
for a couple of days.
Student co-operation and decision
to adopt the plan was voiced by all
students in University dorms, said
Miss Ricker. She reminds student
eaters the move does not mean re
straint of hunger at any prepared
meal, as the cutting down will be
taken care of in food planning.
EAT THAT BREAD'
"So, that extra piece of bread sit
ting on the plate might as well be
eaten up; it is just if the bread isn't
there that the saving is taking
place," she said.
The use of eggs in cooking will
continue on the eggless days, said
Miss Ricker, and the only loss to
student appetites will be felt in the
lack of individual egg servings.
. INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
Decision on the Row to adopt the
Truman Plan has been left up t'»
the individual houses, where the
men seem to be talcing the lead.
Eight of (he fraternities have al
ready decided on meatless, fowl
less, eggless flays, with the remain
ing 10 house-spokesmen hinting a
future swing.
Hilltop House, graduate women's
dorm, leads the individual women':;
league with a decision to cut. the
scarce supplies out of their Tues
day-Thursday diet. But women's
Row is still without final affirmative
answer, in spite of a voiced opinion
that they too would be changing be
fore long.
