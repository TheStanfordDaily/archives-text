# Union Hashers Display Speed, Efficiency in Serving Patrons
## 
### DICK BIESER 
Every day when that noon whistle
blows, the patrons of the Union
main dining room see a staff of
white-coated hashers come burst
ing forth from the kitchen. Led by
Jim Michaels, head hasher, they
serve a luncheon with speed that
enables both patrons and hashers to
make one o'clocks.
Again at (» p.m. the dining room is
open to the public and both students
and faculty members have dinner
in an atmosphere that is more like
n quiet restaurant than a university
dining hall.
The dining room is open to any
one on campus, and aside from the
many casual patrons there are a
number of regular customers.
MOATED DISCUSSIONS
Until this quarter Dr. Thomas S.
Barclay was almost invariably seal
ed in his chair at the head of the
faculty table. Some good discus
sions hike place at that table, as well
as the tables where law and politi
cal science groups have their lunch
eon meetings.
Other frequent customers are Dr.
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of
geology; Dr. Leßoy Abrams, pro
lessor emeritus of botany; Dean J.
Hugh Jackson of the Graduate
School of Business; and Dr. Virgil
K. Whitaker, associate professor of
English.
STUDENTS HASH
Scores of Farm students have
earned their meals by hashing at the
Union. Dean of Students Lawrence
A. Kimpton recalls that he was a
;;ul)stitute hasher at Union during
his undergraduate days. Basketball

star Hank Luisetti was n Union
hasher.
Students also work in the dish
room und in the kitchen itself.
Back in 1922, when Herbert Hoo
ver gave the building to the Univer
sity, it became the dining hall for
everyone who didn't live in either
a fraternity or sorority house. At.
the time it was built there was no
Encina Commons, Lagunita, or
Branner.


A typical Stanford Hashing Peril.
