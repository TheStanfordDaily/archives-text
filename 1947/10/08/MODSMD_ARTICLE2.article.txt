"We had a war here too."
Foreign visitors to present day Spain often hear this remark
from Spaniards seeking to explain their country's present plight,
for the evidences of war are everywhere so abundant that it's
hard for foreigners to remember that Spain was a noncombatant
in World War 11.

In fact, Spain today appears every
bit as badly off as its neighbors to
the north. Just as in Fi'ance, food is
scarce and fantastically expensive,
and the average Spaniard is hard
put to purchase even a minimum
subsistence diet at present prices.
With eggs at sixty cents apiece and
cooking oil selling for nearly $5 a
quart, the white-collar worker, who
considers himself relatively well paid
with a salary of around $2 a day,
is barely able to exist. Even in the
agricultural areas this pattern of in
flation and malnutrition is repeated
again and again.
PLENTY FOR SOME
But if the visitor is impressed with
the hard-lot of the people, he is
equally impressed with the relative
plenty enjoyed by a few groups.
Traditionally, Spain has always had
a stratified society with but a few
groups at the top—such as the land
owners and the Church. These
groups continue to enjoy special
privileges and their numbers are
augmented by the new elite — the
officialdom of the Falange. Inci
dently, it is the Falange which has
the complete control over the all-im
port ant ration books.
CAUTION USED
Naturally; under such conditions,
Spanish students discuss their coun
try's present situation with almost
painful caution. Entirely absent
from our talks was the easy give
and take which marked bull-sessions
with students in other parts of
Western Europe. And strangely

I enough, despite (heir positions of
privilege, none of them seemed really
enthusiastic about Spain's present or
future. In fact, the nearest they
came to commending the present
regime was to say they felt that
Spain was being "picked on" by
other countries—particularly France
which had closed the border.
A few others criticized the U.S.
for not including Spain in the Mar
shall Plan talks. One or two seemed
almost embarassed by the pictures
of Franco and the violent pro-
Franco propaganda posters we would
sec everywhere in the streets, shops,
and even in the stately library of the
University itself. A very small
number ventured to criticize by in
direction, commenting on the gen
eral poverty and Spain's failure to
come back after the Civil War or else

GRANNIS' IMPRESSIONS
Naturally, any generalizations are
apt to be inaccurate, but the over-all
impression this writer received of
them was that they are discouraged,
dissatisfied but fearful to say so, and
feel frustrated by the lack of real
freedom to say whatever they think.
Considerably more interesting,
were the young men of the "Demo
cratic Alliance" to whom the writer
had letters of introduction from
friends and relatives exiled in
France. Composed of Republicans,
Anarchists (similar in name only to
the U.S. variety), and Communists,
the Democratic Alliance is an illegal
united-front anti-Franco organiza
tion whose only purpose is'to oust
the present government. Although
careful where they talked, they were
very voluble when they began. They
vehemently denounced Franco and
the Falange as "Fascists and mur
derers." With respect to Franco's
claim to the outside world that he
alone.can save Spain from commun
ism, one young republican said:
"Remember, before the war, there
were but a few thousand Commun
ists in all Spain. They were out
numbered many times by Republi
cans and Monarchists—and they still
are. What most of us want is neither
Communism nor Facism, but some
kind of a moderate government—
perhaps republican like yours, per
haps monarchist."

GRANNIS' IMPRESSIONS
Naturally, any generalizations are
apt to be inaccurate, but the over-all
impression this writer received of
them was that they are discouraged,
dissatisfied but fearful to say so, and
feel frustrated by the lack of real
freedom to say whatever they think.
Considerably more interesting,
were the young men of the "Demo
cratic Alliance" to whom the writer
had letters of introduction from
friends and relatives exiled in
France. Composed of Republicans,
Anarchists (similar in name only to
the U.S. variety), and Communists,
the Democratic Alliance is an illegal
united-front anti-Franco organiza
tion whose only purpose is'to oust
the present government. Although
careful where they talked, they were
very voluble when they began. They
vehemently denounced Franco and
the Falange as "Fascists and mur
derers." With respect to Franco's
claim to the outside world that he
alone.can save Spain from commun
ism, one young republican said:
"Remember, before the war, there
were but a few thousand Commun
ists in all Spain. They were out
numbered many times by Republi
cans and Monarchists—and they still
are. What most of us want is neither
Communism nor Facism, but some
kind of a moderate government—
perhaps republican like yours, per
haps monarchist."

cratic Alliance—the united front
Anti-Franco movement.

"We had a war here too."
Foreign visitors to present day Spain often hear this remark
from Spaniards seeking to explain their country's present plight,
for the evidences of war are everywhere so abundant that it's
hard for foreigners to remember that Spain was a noncombatant
in World War 11.

In fact, Spain today appears every
bit as badly off as its neighbors to
the north. Just as in Fi'ance, food is
scarce and fantastically expensive,
and the average Spaniard is hard
put to purchase even a minimum
subsistence diet at present prices.
With eggs at sixty cents apiece and
cooking oil selling for nearly $5 a
quart, the white-collar worker, who
considers himself relatively well paid
with a salary of around $2 a day,
is barely able to exist. Even in the
agricultural areas this pattern of in
flation and malnutrition is repeated
again and again.
PLENTY FOR SOME
But if the visitor is impressed with
the hard-lot of the people, he is
equally impressed with the relative
plenty enjoyed by a few groups.
Traditionally, Spain has always had
a stratified society with but a few
groups at the top—such as the land
owners and the Church. These
groups continue to enjoy special
privileges and their numbers are
augmented by the new elite — the
officialdom of the Falange. Inci
dently, it is the Falange which has
the complete control over the all-im
port ant ration books.
CAUTION USED
Naturally; under such conditions,
Spanish students discuss their coun
try's present situation with almost
painful caution. Entirely absent
from our talks was the easy give
and take which marked bull-sessions
with students in other parts of
Western Europe. And strangely

I enough, despite (heir positions of
privilege, none of them seemed really
enthusiastic about Spain's present or
future. In fact, the nearest they
came to commending the present
regime was to say they felt that
Spain was being "picked on" by
other countries—particularly France
which had closed the border.

"We had a war here too."
Foreign visitors to present day Spain often hear this remark
from Spaniards seeking to explain their country's present plight,
for the evidences of war are everywhere so abundant that it's
hard for foreigners to remember that Spain was a noncombatant
in World War 11.

In fact, Spain today appears every
bit as badly off as its neighbors to
the north. Just as in Fi'ance, food is
scarce and fantastically expensive,
and the average Spaniard is hard
put to purchase even a minimum
subsistence diet at present prices.
With eggs at sixty cents apiece and
cooking oil selling for nearly $5 a
quart, the white-collar worker, who
considers himself relatively well paid
with a salary of around $2 a day,
is barely able to exist. Even in the
agricultural areas this pattern of in
flation and malnutrition is repeated
again and again.
PLENTY FOR SOME
But if the visitor is impressed with
the hard-lot of the people, he is
equally impressed with the relative
plenty enjoyed by a few groups.
Traditionally, Spain has always had
a stratified society with but a few
groups at the top—such as the land
owners and the Church. These
groups continue to enjoy special
privileges and their numbers are
augmented by the new elite — the
officialdom of the Falange. Inci
dently, it is the Falange which has
the complete control over the all-im
port ant ration books.
CAUTION USED
Naturally; under such conditions,
Spanish students discuss their coun
try's present situation with almost
painful caution. Entirely absent
from our talks was the easy give
and take which marked bull-sessions
with students in other parts of
Western Europe. And strangely

I enough, despite (heir positions of
privilege, none of them seemed really
enthusiastic about Spain's present or
future. In fact, the nearest they
came to commending the present
regime was to say they felt that
Spain was being "picked on" by
other countries—particularly France
which had closed the border.
A few others criticized the U.S.
for not including Spain in the Mar
shall Plan talks. One or two seemed
almost embarassed by the pictures
of Franco and the violent pro-
Franco propaganda posters we would
sec everywhere in the streets, shops,
and even in the stately library of the
University itself. A very small
number ventured to criticize by in

seemed to wish to do.
GRANNIS' IMPRESSIONS
Naturally, any generalizations are
apt to be inaccurate, but the over-all
impression this writer received of
them was that they are discouraged,
dissatisfied but fearful to say so, and
feel frustrated by the lack of real
freedom to say whatever they think.
Considerably more interesting,
were the young men of the "Demo
cratic Alliance" to whom the writer
had letters of introduction from
friends and relatives exiled in
France. Composed of Republicans,
Anarchists (similar in name only to
the U.S. variety), and Communists,
the Democratic Alliance is an illegal
united-front anti-Franco organiza
tion whose only purpose is'to oust
the present government. Although
careful where they talked, they were
very voluble when they began. They
vehemently denounced Franco and
the Falange as "Fascists and mur
derers." With respect to Franco's
claim to the outside world that he
alone.can save Spain from commun
ism, one young republican said:
"Remember, before the war, there
were but a few thousand Commun
ists in all Spain. They were out
numbered many times by Republi
cans and Monarchists—and they still
are. What most of us want is neither
Communism nor Facism, but some
kind of a moderate government—
perhaps republican like yours, per
haps monarchist."
