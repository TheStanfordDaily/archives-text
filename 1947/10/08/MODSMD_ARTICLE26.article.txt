## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
"Everyone in a university should participate fully in campus life; an j
important part of that life is interest in religion in relation to studies,
campus, and personal daily life," declared Stanford's new visiting chaplain,
Robert Minto, formerly of Glasgow, Scotland.
In his student days Chaplain Minto was president of the University oi

Glasgow's Student Christian Move- *
ment, a group of students interested
in religion, and members of this
group were active in practically ev
ery activity on campus.
"I don't know Stanford yet, but I j
hope that the students here take a
similar interest in both religion and .
campus life," he went on.
After studying at Trinity College i
at the University of Glasgow and at j
Union Theological Seminary in New
York, Chaplain Minto spent two j
years in Scotland. He was then sent j
to Penang in Malaya as "colonial j
chaplain," or minister to the Euro- j
peans in Malaya, Siam, and Suma
tra. |
Leaving the Far East after four J
years, the chaplain became minister j
at North Church in Buffalo, New
York. He was also the first chaplain
at the University of Buffalo. During
World War II be returned to Britain
to become chaplain in the Royal
Navy.
Stanford is his first civilian pas
torate since that time.
"My own participation in student
activities at a big university led me |
to feel I would like the opportunity
to be with students again in the ca
pacity of chaplain," he explained.
Chaplain Minto was president of
the Student Union at the Univer
sity of Glasgow, a society similar
to the ASSU, in addition to acting
as a delegate to both the Warsaw
conference on student housing and
the first Anglo - American confer
ence on international affairs held at
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
"This is my first trip to Califor
nia," he admitted. "The closest I
had been to it before was Honolulu
when I was on my way back from
the Far East."
When asked how he liked it here,
this tall, rather distinguished-look
ing Presbyterian minister ex
claimed, "I like the sunshine best;
we don't have much of that in Scot
land." Warnings that the California
sunshine sometimes fails did not
daunt him, though. "I'm used to
rain," he said.
Chaplain Minto, his wife, who is
from Norfolk, Virginia, and their
two little daughters, ages 4 years
and 9 months, have moved into the
University Chaplain's residence at
532 Lasuen, the first house on the
right going up from the Post Office, j
"We will be glad to see anybody at j
any time, day or night," he stated.
"I am delighted to be at, Stan
ford," he added. "I enjoyed the
service Sunday in your magnificent
church and am looking forward to
meeting the students."
