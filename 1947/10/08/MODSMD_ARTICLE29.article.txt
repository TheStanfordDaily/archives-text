# Cards Field International Soccer Team
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Internationalism on the Stanford
campus is well typified on the soccer
field. Five nights a week one can
see men from Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, India, and China playing the
game that is the connecting link
with athletics at home. In these
countries soccer is looked upon as
a major sport rather than one in
which a player can earn only a
minor letter.
A preliminary report by student
coach Dave Tappan shows that five
of the six probable starters on this
season's eleven hail from across the
waters.
TREJOS RETURNS
Ricardo Trejos, who calls Costa
Rica home, plays center forward
and was the leading scorer on last
year's team. He won this distinction
even though he was injured midway
in the fourth game and saw no fur
ther action in that season.
Stanley Hodge, a newcomer from
South America, plays the right in
side position on the five-man for
ward line and is expected to give
Trejos plenty of competition as the
team's leading scorer. Hodge is a
six-footer plus who is capable of
slamming the ball into the net with
either foot.
Another forward is Ara Gual
staun. This diminutive lad, the
shortest man on the team, learned
his soccer playing in his homeland
of India. He is said to make up for
his lack of altitude with tremendous
speed.
Still another foreign lad is Nica
raguan Tony Ortega. This small,
aggressive light winger played on
the national Nicaraguan team which
met a Costa Rican outfit in 1942.
Pat McDonnell has spent a good
deal of his life in China and it was
there that he learned to play the
game. He is regarded as a strong
defensive fullback.
HUDSON TOP GOALIE
Goalie Randy Hudson is the only
lad of these six veteran players who
learned the game here in the United
States. Coach Tappan gives him as
the chief reason that Stanford's goal
line was violated but five times in
last year's contests.
When asked about his starting
lineup, Tappan commented that the
.six men mentioned here were the
chief "probables," but that it was
too early to name any others. He
added, "We have a large, willing
group of men out now and could
beat last year's record of three won
and two lost." The first game is
scheduled Oct. 18 with San Fran
cisco JC.

either foot.
Another forward is Ara Gual
staun. This diminutive lad, the
shortest man on the team, learned
his soccer playing in his homeland
of India. He is said to make up for
his lack of altitude with tremendous
speed.
Still another foreign lad is Nica
raguan Tony Ortega. This small,
aggressive light winger played on
the national Nicaraguan team which
met a Costa Rican outfit in 1942.
Pat McDonnell has spent a good
deal of his life in China and it was
there that he learned to play the
game. He is regarded as a strong
defensive fullback.
HUDSON TOP GOALIE
Goalie Randy Hudson is the only
lad of these six veteran players who
learned the game here in the United
States. Coach Tappan gives him as
the chief reason that Stanford's goal
line was violated but five times in
last year's contests.
When asked about his starting
lineup, Tappan commented that the
.six men mentioned here were the
chief "probables," but that it was
too early to name any others. He
added, "We have a large, willing
group of men out now and could
beat last year's record of three won
and two lost." The first game is
scheduled Oct. 18 with San Fran
cisco JC.
Internationalism on the Stanford
campus is well typified on the soccer
field. Five nights a week one can
see men from Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, India, and China playing the
game that is the connecting link
with athletics at home. In these
countries soccer is looked upon as
a major sport rather than one in
which a player can earn only a
minor letter.
A preliminary report by student
coach Dave Tappan shows that five
of the six probable starters on this
season's eleven hail from across the
waters.
TREJOS RETURNS
Ricardo Trejos, who calls Costa
Rica home, plays center forward
and was the leading scorer on last
year's team. He won this distinction
even though he was injured midway
in the fourth game and saw no fur
ther action in that season.
Stanley Hodge, a newcomer from
South America, plays the right in
side position on the five-man for
ward line and is expected to give
Trejos plenty of competition as the
team's leading scorer. Hodge is a
six-footer plus who is capable of
slamming the ball into the net with
either foot.
