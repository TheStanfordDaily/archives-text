# Footballers Start Work For SC Game
## 
### ART LUBIC 
Romping through yesterday's
slightly wet practice session, Stan
ford's far-from-downtrodden grid
men shook ofl the last effects of the
Michigan jaunt and buckled down
to serious duty in preparation for
Saturday's fray with Santa Clara.
Coach Marchie Schwartz an
nounced a one-for-one swap on the
casualty list, moving Bobbie Ander
son back on the active list and
placing Ainslie Bell in the hors-de
combat circle. Bell reinjured his
trick knee against the Wolverines
and will sit out the Santa Clara
game. X-rays later in the week will
reveal the exact extent of the dam
age.
George Quist and his successor at
right halfback. Mickey Titus, are
sidelined for at least another week.
Headman Schwartz has some jug
gling to do in the backfield to fill
this gaping hole. His first move was
to switch letterman Aub Devine
from quarterback.
BACKFIELD SHUFFLE
A 1 Morris should get the call at
the ball-handling post with Bell out.
Bob Anderson returns to left half,
replacing Wayne Erickson, and
Marty Anderson will be at fullback.
Marty's understudy, Jim Nafziger,
brought back two bad "charley
horses" from Ann Arbor but is ex
pected to be ready for part-time
duty Saturday.
The forward wall came out of the
Michigan game battered but intact.
End Gene Martin, a leg casualty,
suited up a id will be in shape for
the Broncos.
The line showed improvement, as
much as could be expected, against
their powerhouse Big Nine oppo
nents.
READY TO ROLL
The Cards came out of the Michi
gan game in a good frame of mind
and are ready to roll against future
competition. Santa Clara, UCLA,
Washington, Oregon State, USC,
Oregon, and Cal still remain on the
slate.
