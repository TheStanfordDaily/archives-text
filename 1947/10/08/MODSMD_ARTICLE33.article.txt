# Intramural Managers To Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight at 7:30 all representatives j
and team managers of men's living i
groups planning to enter intramural
activities this quarter will meet
with Chuck Taylor, intramural di
rector, to work out league assign
ments and schedule regular nights
of play.
The meeting will be held in room
41 of flie SAC and will mark the
final time for team managers to turn
in their lists of entrants for this
quarter's sports.
In order to follow up the enthu
siasm shown in last yar's intramural
competition and the benefits en
joyed by all concerned. Taylor has
planned an enlarged program in
cluding seven football leagues, if
signups are sufficient to warrant
that number, besides league play in

i handball, volleyball, golf, bowling,
and table tennis.
VARIETY OF SPORTS
Taylor still hopes that men inter
ested in horseshoes will show their
preference so that the league or
ganized for that activity may be
carried through. Golf matches will,
of course, be held on the University
links and the volleyball contests are
planned for night play, perhaps in
the Basketball Pavilion so that it
will not conflict with other sports.
Handball will be in back of the
SAC, touch football is slated for
the intramural field, while bowling
will again be continued on the Stan
ford Village alleys.
An advisory board consisting of
one member each from the Row, the
Village, independents, Encina, and

Toyon will be elected to help direct
intramural activity this quarter. The
point system will remain virtually
the same as last year, but a com
plete set of the formal rules will be 1
given out to all those attending to- '
night's meeting.
FOOTBALL CLINIC
Taylor has also announced that he
will conduct a football clinic every
Thursday night in the SAC in order
to instruct anyone interested in the
fundamentals of seven - man foot
ball.
Each group entering intramural
play this quarter should be repre
sented at tonight's meeting by a
team manager and a representative,
or a team manager and his alter
nate, but for those groups which
have not yet elected a manager for

this quarter, it is permissible to be
represented by only one man.
Referee signups are still being ta
ken in the SAC where further in
-1 formation is available.
