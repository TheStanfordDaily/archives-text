# The 						Daily Looks Ahead
## 
### 
At a meeting of Publications Council last
week two requests presented by The Daily
were approved.
They were: (1) the request that The Daily
be allowed to send a reporter on all confer
ence football games, and (2) that $150 of the
$10,000 profit which The Daily will make this
year be used to make photo engravings of
prominent administration, faculty, and student
leaders.
Both of these requests fit into the long-range
program for improving The Daily. Like a uni
versity, a government, or a politician, it takes
a long time for a newspaper to gain prestige.
It is short-sighted to state that something is
acceptable now and to ask why spend money
to improve it. The result is a period in which
everything looks well, superficially, followed
by a rapid deterioration era.
The building housing The Daily has already
fallen victim to shortsighted planning, It is a
discredit to Stanford, a menace from a fire
hazard viewpoint, and would cost a huge sum
to get back into acceptable condition. If cor
rectly kept up it could have been an accept
able office for The Daily.
The Daily at present receives about one
third of its income from students, the remain

der from advertising. It will make $10,000 for
the university this year. Actually not the uni
versity itself—the money goes into a building
fund for a new publications building—but cer
tainly for the university.
Economic conditions are such that this
profit will probably not be as large in future
years.
When the minutes of Publications Council
came up before Excom for approval they met
with varying degrees of support. The Daily
requests as written in the minutes were ap
proved.
The Daily believes that if Stanford is to
maintain its position as a leading university it
must soon rebuild many of its integral parts.
The Stanford Daily is an integral part of Stan
ford.
It will take money to keep the Stanford Daily
from falling by the wayside. Why not spend
this money now when there is a profit?
Three hundred dollars wisely spent now will
save the ASSU many thousands of dollars
later. Small improvements each year certainly
fit into a long-range rebuilding program—a
long-range program of which The Daily is in
dire need.

third of its income from students, the remain

der from advertising. It will make $10,000 for
the university this year. Actually not the uni
versity itself—the money goes into a building
fund for a new publications building—but cer
tainly for the university.
Economic conditions are such that this
profit will probably not be as large in future
years.
When the minutes of Publications Council
came up before Excom for approval they met
with varying degrees of support. The Daily
requests as written in the minutes were ap
proved.
The Daily believes that if Stanford is to
maintain its position as a leading university it
must soon rebuild many of its integral parts.
The Stanford Daily is an integral part of Stan
ford.
It will take money to keep the Stanford Daily
from falling by the wayside. Why not spend
this money now when there is a profit?
Three hundred dollars wisely spent now will
save the ASSU many thousands of dollars
later. Small improvements each year certainly
fit into a long-range rebuilding program—a
long-range program of which The Daily is in
dire need.
At a meeting of Publications Council last
week two requests presented by The Daily
were approved.
They were: (1) the request that The Daily
be allowed to send a reporter on all confer
ence football games, and (2) that $150 of the
$10,000 profit which The Daily will make this
year be used to make photo engravings of
prominent administration, faculty, and student
leaders.
Both of these requests fit into the long-range
program for improving The Daily. Like a uni
versity, a government, or a politician, it takes
a long time for a newspaper to gain prestige.
It is short-sighted to state that something is
acceptable now and to ask why spend money
to improve it. The result is a period in which
everything looks well, superficially, followed
by a rapid deterioration era.
The building housing The Daily has already
fallen victim to shortsighted planning, It is a
discredit to Stanford, a menace from a fire
hazard viewpoint, and would cost a huge sum
to get back into acceptable condition. If cor
rectly kept up it could have been an accept
able office for The Daily.
The Daily at present receives about one
third of its income from students, the remain
