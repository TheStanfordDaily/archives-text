There is getting to be altogether 100 much activity
that we don't know about inside the human body.
Every day we are told of some new change that is
going on in our cells—chromosomes reproducing,
genes ringing bells, and blowing whistles—until, com
pared with what goes on in a living organism, the
night following the big game is like Monday after
noon in the ceramics room of the Stanford Museum.
It will soon be so that a man can't call his body
his own without having a chat-chat with a bunch of
sub-microscopic cells to find out if it's OK with them.
ELUSIVE GENES
It wouldn't be so bad if you had face to face con
tact with them, but they are harder to locate than a
pretty coed. Most of us even had to go to college to
find out they were there.
Scientists tell us that genes are what keeps us
from reproducing cows and jackasses instead of boys
and girls. My father doesn't know yet what genes
are, and he has two boys, one of which is all right,
so I recommend a course in social hygiene before one
in genetics anyway.
What makes me leery is that, up until recently

(comparatively, that is), the gene has been frankly a
theoretical entity in the minds of the scientists. They
talked about them but weren't sure there were such
things. No one had ever seen a gene wearing a "Vote
for Hoover" button. No one had ever seen a gene.
They might as well have called them "Garlns" or
"Narfs."
MIGHTY FRUIT FLY
Then somebody got a fruit-fly drunk, and calling
it a Drosophila Melanogaster, took apart one of its
chromosomes and claimed to have discovered 2,500
genes in it.
In other words, they first talked about genes, and
then, to save their collective face, discovered them.
Why don't we go back and begin all over again,
and recognize only those organic changes that we
can see like mumps, pink-eye, and athlete's foot.
There's enough to worry about right there. And if
any of you know of persons who are reproducing
cows and jackasses with any regularity let me know.
I've got contacts and can get them a job with the
4-H club.
