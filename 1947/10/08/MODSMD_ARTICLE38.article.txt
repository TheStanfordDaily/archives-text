### ALLEN BLETZ 
The UN has, for the present, ceased to bo an
agency and has become an arena. Actually, it is now
a place of confrontation. I realize that this is an
appalling thing to have to say, but the world might
have been a little more at ease three weeks ago if
it had been postponed because the roof leaked, or the
planes with their passengers did not arrive.
If there had been no meeting we would have
been spared much inconclusive storming and gloom.
For the UN no longer comes together for a specific
purpose; it merely comes together. It is not always a
happy thought to bring two parties known to be in
anger into the same room. Often, I have been taught,
the most constructive thing to do is to keep them
from meeting until circumstances change. The fact
that the member nations have to meet according to
a strict timetable, is not in the least a guarantee of
peace. Sometimes if there is no fight scheduled, the
chief result is that there is no fight. It is said that
at least the United States and Russia are debating
the great issues of the clay before the "conscience of
mankind" at the UN. That is not quite so.
COMPROMISE NEEDED
These two nations are under no compulsion to
settle anything at these meetings, or even to speak
on the same subjects. In terms of content, Mar
shall's speech and Vishinsky's had very little to do
with each other. Each side listens like "true sports
men'" to each other's speeches, but neither party will
consider the other's policy seriously. The points put
forth are not expected to be accepted; they are ex
pected to be rejected. Marshall knows good and well
that Russia will absolutely not abandon the veto; and
on the other hand, Vishinsky knows we are not going
to curb our freedom of speech to put down "war
mongers," a term he would certainly apply to all
critics of Russia.
PEACE TREATY WITHOUT WAR
The United Nations can be restored to its
original function only by a peace treaty between
Russia and the United States. Yes, it is true that
there has been no war between these nations. But

it would be very eivilized to have- a peace treaty
without a war. We have dropped many traditions
in our time, and perhaps we can drop the one that
says there has to be a war before the peace. Let us
now consider that there has been a stalemated war,
both sides would have to revise certain attitudes. We
would have to give up the comedy routine in which
we are continually rediscovering that Russia is Com
munist. What on earth did we think it was, theoso
phist? Mr. Vishinsky operates along this line also,
as in the speech in which he made his babyish de
mand that we suppress critics of Russia. He in
formed us, with every aspect of horror and surprise,
that we have corporations in America, that these
same corporations really make profits, and that
some of them do not care lor Communism. That is
hot news too.
WARTIME ALLIANCE PROMISING
But the whole point of the wartime alliance be
tween these two countries is that it was an alliance
between a capitalist country and a Communistic one.
That, in my opinion, is what made it so remarkable,
and also so promising. This same kind of accord
between opposites is very necessary for a stable
peace. That, and only that, is the problem. If that
problem did not exist, there would not be any prob
lem. Vishinsky is wholly unconvincing when he re
acts to his discovery of corporations in America as if
he had found (lies in his soup. What did he expect
to find here? The smooth pretense that we ought to
be in some way different from what we are is an
absurdity; it is Mr. Vishinsky's problem to make
peace with us as we are, just as it is ours to make
peace with his country. If he fails, and hostilities
come, the responsibility will be his responsibility,
too; and he cannot avoid it by pretending to work
hard at some other problem than the one which
actually exists.
Our present need is for a peace treaty without a
conflict, and also to revive the original functions of the
United NNations. Until this task can be accomplished
the UN stands on extremely shaky ground and black
clouds will continue to lay inside this house of peace.
