To the Editor, The Stanford Daily:
In "History 1947" yesterday, George Brunn gives
us a sample of some typical fellow-traveler thinking.
In Europe, for instance, he wants six billion dollars in
European-owned American securities (that is his
figure, not mine) confiscated by the various govern
ments before we give them any help. In other words,
our aid should go to those nations which have
adopted communistic measures, instead of being in
tended to combat communism.
He criticizes our support of the governments of
Greece, Turkey and China. True, they are far from
perfect. But without our aid, or hope of it. these
governments would soon fall into the hands of pup
pets ol Moscow. Personally, I think this would be a

I
calamity, but it would make some people quite happy.
I wonder how it would make Mr. Brunn feel.
We arc not aiding "a tyrannical Chinese bandit,"
as the article states. Chiang Kai-Shek (whom I sup
pose is meant) has done more than anyone else to
suppress banditry in China, expose weaknesses in his
own government, and bring into being a democratic
constitution modeled after our own. The amount
of our aid to China right now is insignificant. During
the war and immediately afterwards we gave far
more aid to Stalin, Tito, etc. than we gave to China.
Mr. Brunn's list of undemocratic countries to which
we have given aid omitted Russia, Jugoslavia, Ru
mania, etc. Was this due to lack of space?
