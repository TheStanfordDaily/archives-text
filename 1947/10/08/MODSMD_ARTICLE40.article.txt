(This is Hhe first of two articles oil the role of Stanford in the inter
national picture.)

A special feature of the post-war Stanford is the interest
shown by students in International affairs and their desire to
actively participate in them. As a result we have a large number
of international organizations and student participation in them
on the campus. It was last fall quarter that these activities started

and within one year we have a very
efficient Institute of International
Relations at Stanford.
Stanford always had a number of
foreign students and an International
Club which provided opportunities
for them to mix socially with Ameri
can students. Last fall, a few stu
dents felt the need of more student
participation and understanding of
national and international events.
The purpose of ISC was to send
some Stanford students abroad
every year to get a first hand ac
quaintance and understanding of
foreign people and events. Excom
also selected and sent delegates to
the Chicago convention of the Na
tional Students Organization. Stan
ford delegates took a very active
part in that convention.
YM-YW CONFERENCE
Meantime, more than twenty stu
dents attended the Regional YMCA
YWCA Asilomar Conference and
came to the conclusion that students
at Stanford must take more inter
est in the world and also help the
people and students of war-torn
countries. These students met in
January again and decided to call a
conference on International Rela
tions at Stanford.
That meeting decided to increase
the scope of international activities
on the campus. Excom supported the
idea very strongly and appointed
Beth Mac Vicar, a former Daily edi
tor, to coordinate all such activities
and evolve a central organization.
After various open meetings and
with the active cooperation of Niel
Allen, chairman of ISC, Chuck Mar
tin and Ralph Hovis, Mac Vicar
chalked out the plans for the Insti
tute of International Relations which
was to coordinate and supervise all
other international organizations on
the campus.
.NEW COMMITTEES
Various new committees were
formed during the Winter quarter
to take up international activities
while the old committees, namely
International Survey committee and
the International Club remained as
active as ever under the new set up.
First new committee to be formed
was International Conference Com
mittee. Headed by Cliff Nelson and
Mary V. Pond as co-chairmen, the
committee organized the first stu
dent Conference on International
Relations to be held at Stanford on
May 9, 10, and 11. The conference
was addressed by various Stanford
and outside professors and was at
tended by nearly 1500 students.
