# Assembly Set For Grannis, Farrer Talks
## 
### 
A comprehensive report of their
European experiences will be made
to the student body tomorrow night,
by Lawrence Grannis and Bill Fai
rer. The meeting will be held in
the Cubberley Auditorium at 7:30
p.m.
Grannis and Fairer were sent by
the students on student body funds
to view the conditions and needs of
present - day Europe. Plans were
begun by the International Students
Committee, but the two tours were
under direct student sponsorship af
ter a referendum on the ISC plans
passed in last May's elections.
A series of talks to the students is
a part of the two men's program.
This first talk, under the auspices
of the ISC, is merely a beginning,
according to Bob Hoyt, ISC chair
man. Farrer and Grannis will ac
cept two speaking engagements a
week on campus, if there is a call
for them, Hoyt stated.
Between addresses, the two men
will compile a written report on
their travels. Because of the inter
est other schools have shown in this
program, these reports will be dis
tributed to colleges and universi
ties all over the country. Decisions
on whether other students should
be sent abroad will be based on
their observations.
Tomorrow Grannis and Farrer
will discuss their itinera, their costs
and methods, schools in Europe, and
the reception they received abroad.
A question period will follow the
meeting.
The two men's second talk is set
for the International Club Sunday
night.
