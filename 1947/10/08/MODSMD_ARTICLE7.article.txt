train time. Nevertheless, the loyal fans swarmed from under the shel
tering eaves toward the last car of the commuter's train.
Perhaps there was no joy in Mudville on that fateful night, but at the
Paly station it was a different story. The two hundred rooters puddle
jumped toward the team, climbed trucks for a better view, and gurgled
out a "Stanford varsity, rah" to the accompaniment of a wet glockcn
speil.
Ignoring the weather, the team made a mighty splash in their new
traveling jackcts of cardinal color.
There were those modest Cardinals like Marty Anderson, Vie C'onde,
Afherton Phleger, and Pete August who bad hopped an earlier train.

Yet despite such rumors and nconveniences the valiant two hundred
stuck it out to the end at the station. No tears al this homecoming—just
'rain.
