# Marshall Lists Purge Code; Attlee Fires Eleven Ministers

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (UP).—
The State Department, openly fear
ful of espionage within its ranks, to
day laid down a formal security
code providing for the immediate
firing of any "questionable" officer
or employee, including Communists, |
Fascists, and their fellow-travelers, j
The regulations, which put the ,
burden of proof upon the suspected I
individual, arc probably the most
drastic and far - reaching ever
adopted by any U.S. government
service in peacetime.
They were drawn up "in the in
terest of the United States," a
spokesman said, because the dc- j
partment has become "a vital tar- I
get" for spies and subversives.
The announcement followed close
ly word from Poland that the leaders
of world Communism have revived
the Communist International (Com
intern) for the avowed purpose of
fighting American "dollar imperial
ism" as typified by the Marshall
Plan for European reconstruction.
State Department officials thus far
have had no comment, on the reor
ganization of the Comintern, which
Moscow ostensibly disbanded in
1943.
Under the regulations, Secretary
of State George C. Marshall can dis
miss spies, traitors, subversives,
members of Communist, Fascist, or
Nazi organizations and their sym
pathizers, and even employees who
have contributed funds to any of
those groups or signed a political
petition for them.

LONDON. Oct. 7 (UP). —Prime
Minister Clement Attlee tonight
dismissed 11 ministers, shifted nine,
and appointed 13 new ones in a
major governmnet shakeup.
Fuel Minister Emanuel Shinwell,
widely blamed for last winter's coal
crisis, was forced out of the cabinet.
Two other cabinet ministers fired
were Joseph Westwood, Secretary
of State for Scotland, and Lord In
man, Lord Privy Seal—along with
three senior ministers of non-cabi
net rank. These were War Secre
tary Frederick Bel longer, Supply
Minister John Wilmot, and Pension
Minister John Burns Hynd.
