# Bids to '50 Dance Go on Sale Today
## 
### 
Today glamorous squads of young
girls especially selected from the
ranks of the Class of '50 will begin
"on Quad" sales of bids for '50's
Red and White Dance, ticket chair
man Nancy McClure announced.
"Sales tables set up at the History
corner and in the Union's 'Side
walk Cafe' will operate from 10
o'clock on," Miss McClure stated,
"dispensing bids at the ridiculously
low price of only $1.80. My uncle is
Madman Muntz," she added by way
of explanation.
"Remember," she threatened, "this
is the only all-campus function this
Saturday and the number of tickets
is limited."
