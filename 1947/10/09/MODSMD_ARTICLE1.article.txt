"We Poles have a very short memory, I'm afraid," said Mag
dalene as v/e stood viewing the ruins of what once was Warsaw.
Her Jewish relatives had been shipped off to Dachau and death.
Her schoolmates had been slaughtered during the insurrection
of 1944; she had traveled in the sewers from the Ghetto to the

city and back many times during
that month of horror; and she had
been there when student nurses and
Red Cross workers were machine
gunned just three years ago—but
still, she just shrugged her shoul
ders when 1 said, "You must hate
the Germans."
Beaten by the Nazi war machine
and now dominated by the Russians,
just what opportunities and future
do these students of Warsaw have?
They go to school, they study all
they can, they exist from hand to
mouth . . . and when I asked how
they could be so eager with what
surrounded them, seemingly with
out much of a prayer of recovery, I
got the same reply I had heard in
Vienna, in Munich, in Milan, and in
Athens: "Knowledge is the one
thing that cannot be taken from
us."
The Rector of the University and
the president of the students had
heard little or nothing of the World
Student Relief activities, and prac
tically all information regarding
America's part in assistance of any
sort was lacking.
The TB rate has reached 5 per
cent, while 2 per cent is considered
the danger level. Medical supplies
are low and medical equipment is
almost nil at the university. They
need TB equipment, X-ray films,
vitamin and cod liver oil prepara
tions, and dental cabinets. There is
one major lecture room remaining,
all others having been destroyed,
yet 9,000 are enrolled this fall. The
only major structure in existence is
the library, filled with 1,000,000 vol
umes.
CROWDED HOUSING
As far as the housing situation is
concerned, it would be funny if it
were not so tragic. In place of the
dormitories that housed 3,000 non
residents back in 1939, there is a
lone student house jammed with
(iOO. These, who are the more for
tunate, occupy a building (which
they have repaired) about the size
of a Stanford Village dorm. The
others have the choice of living in
bombed-out buildings, cellars, or
caves in the city or of going into
the country and commuting up to
50 miles a day by street car or
train.
(In reading this and wondering
why students go through the priva
tions they do, one must remember
that the universities wore closed
from 1939 to 1945, although the un
derground did operate universities
from 1940 to August of 1944 in War
saw and Posnan.)
The students are organized into
an association called the Bratnia
Pomoc Studentow, and although
they have a great deal of freedom
within the university they are han
dicapped through lack of funds to
offer much to the student body. In
addition to the student house, this
association has a dining hall on the
campus. They do the best they can,
but facilities are so inadequate that
it takes from three to four hours
to permit the students to eat each
meal.
INADEQUATE DIET
Breakfast consists of coffee (they
used to get UNRRA milk), bread,
and marmalade. Dinner includes
soup and vegetables and on rare oc
casions a little meat. The supper

meal is often a repetition of break
fast. Calories total about 1,500 per
day. Badly needed are dried milk
and eggs, fats, and dried vegetables.
Incidentally, it might be pointed
out that Poland operates on a "free
market" for about 75 per cent of the
population, with no rationing and
uncontrolled prices, whereas the
other 25 per cent (primarily gov
ernment employees) are permitted
to buy certain commodities at fixed
prices. Unfortunately, university
students do not fall into this cate
gory and thus their supplies must be
purchased on the inflated "free
market."
To "exist," a student requires a
minimum of 6,000 Zlotyes a month.
Since the average student wage is
200 a day, a full-time job is needed
in order to get by, and 85 per cent
of them work. Most of them have
lost their homes, many of their fam
ilies have been repatriated to the
"new" territory recovered from
Germany, others have no family at
all.
Speaking of Zlotyes, it might be
interesting to note that though they
are officially pegged at 100 to the
dollar, they have run as high as
1,300 on the black market. I stepped
onto a bus and gave the conductor
20 Zlotyes. I found that though the
fare was only 15 Zlotyes, they are
worth so little one doesn't expect
change. Apples (which were plenti
ful) brought 30 Zlotyes each, shoes
12,000 a pair, a fair meal at a local
restaurant 350, and one in a hotel
650.
SCHOLASTIC OPPORTUNITIES
Getting students out of Poland is
a rather difficult matter. In June of
1946 the Swiss University of Fri
berg awarded five scholarships to
Polish students at the University of
Warsaw. It was not until July of
1947 that the passports were given
to them. The Universities of Zurich
and Bern have also offered scholar
ships but as yet the approval of the
Polish government has not been
forthcoming. It might also be noted
that Polish students invited to the
Harvard seminar at Salzburg were
not permitted to leave the country.
The only opportunity. for Ameri
can students to study in Poland
comes through a combination of
teaching English and studying
Slavic languages. At present there
are Americans in this venture, with
the Polish government providing
8,000 to 10,000 Zlotyes a month for
assistance.
The Polish press is uniformly
anti-American, and although the
Gazetta Lidova (the mouthpiece of
the Peasants' party) is still pub
lished, it is vitriolic in its denuncia
tion of the Western powers.
All the students I saw were un
believably poorly informed about
the United States. I asked about the
Marshall Plan and they had heard
nothing of its contents other than
that it was an imperialistic Ameri
can venture to rearm Germany. But
then they did confess they realized
that they were reading only what
the Moscow-dominated press want
ed published.
DISPIRITED ATTITUDE
Everywhere I went I felt general
discouragement at the fact that the
United States refused to offer its aid
. . . but just what can the Poles do
about their plight? Sandwiched in
between the USSR and the Soviet
zone of Germany, they are in a
hopeless position that of necessity
calls for a friendly policy toward the
USSR. Anything else would be
suicide.
Before I left the university I al
most had to laugh at a pathetic little
donkey-cart, overloaded with bricks
that had been cleared from a pile
of rubble, being brought over to as
sist students who were repairing
another one with the most priimtive
methods possible. It quite reminded
me of the students who were work
ing at the University of Munich.
There, when I asked how long it
would take to rebuild, I was met
with a well-considered "15 years."
Here, with a little hesitation, the
answer I got was "perhaps never."

out much of a prayer of recovery, I
got the same reply I had heard in
Vienna, in Munich, in Milan, and in
Athens: "Knowledge is the one
thing that cannot be taken from
us."
The Rector of the University and
the president of the students had
heard little or nothing of the World
Student Relief activities, and prac
tically all information regarding
America's part in assistance of any
sort was lacking.
The TB rate has reached 5 per
cent, while 2 per cent is considered
the danger level. Medical supplies
are low and medical equipment is
almost nil at the university. They
need TB equipment, X-ray films,
vitamin and cod liver oil prepara
tions, and dental cabinets. There is
one major lecture room remaining,
all others having been destroyed,
yet 9,000 are enrolled this fall. The
only major structure in existence is
the library, filled with 1,000,000 vol
umes.
CROWDED HOUSING
As far as the housing situation is
concerned, it would be funny if it
were not so tragic. In place of the
dormitories that housed 3,000 non
residents back in 1939, there is a
lone student house jammed with
(iOO. These, who are the more for
tunate, occupy a building (which
they have repaired) about the size
of a Stanford Village dorm. The
others have the choice of living in
bombed-out buildings, cellars, or
caves in the city or of going into
the country and commuting up to
50 miles a day by street car or
train.
(In reading this and wondering
why students go through the priva
tions they do, one must remember
that the universities wore closed
from 1939 to 1945, although the un
derground did operate universities
from 1940 to August of 1944 in War
saw and Posnan.)
The students are organized into
an association called the Bratnia
Pomoc Studentow, and although
they have a great deal of freedom
within the university they are han
dicapped through lack of funds to
offer much to the student body. In
addition to the student house, this
association has a dining hall on the
campus. They do the best they can,
but facilities are so inadequate that
it takes from three to four hours
to permit the students to eat each
meal.
INADEQUATE DIET
Breakfast consists of coffee (they
used to get UNRRA milk), bread,
and marmalade. Dinner includes
soup and vegetables and on rare oc
casions a little meat. The supper

meal is often a repetition of break
fast. Calories total about 1,500 per
day. Badly needed are dried milk
and eggs, fats, and dried vegetables.
Incidentally, it might be pointed
out that Poland operates on a "free
market" for about 75 per cent of the
population, with no rationing and
uncontrolled prices, whereas the
other 25 per cent (primarily gov
ernment employees) are permitted
to buy certain commodities at fixed
prices. Unfortunately, university
students do not fall into this cate
gory and thus their supplies must be
purchased on the inflated "free
market."
To "exist," a student requires a
minimum of 6,000 Zlotyes a month.
Since the average student wage is
200 a day, a full-time job is needed
in order to get by, and 85 per cent
of them work. Most of them have
lost their homes, many of their fam
ilies have been repatriated to the
"new" territory recovered from
Germany, others have no family at
all.
Speaking of Zlotyes, it might be
interesting to note that though they
are officially pegged at 100 to the
dollar, they have run as high as
1,300 on the black market. I stepped
onto a bus and gave the conductor
20 Zlotyes. I found that though the
fare was only 15 Zlotyes, they are
worth so little one doesn't expect
change. Apples (which were plenti
ful) brought 30 Zlotyes each, shoes
12,000 a pair, a fair meal at a local
restaurant 350, and one in a hotel
650.
SCHOLASTIC OPPORTUNITIES
Getting students out of Poland is
a rather difficult matter. In June of
1946 the Swiss University of Fri
berg awarded five scholarships to
Polish students at the University of
Warsaw. It was not until July of
1947 that the passports were given
to them. The Universities of Zurich
and Bern have also offered scholar
ships but as yet the approval of the
Polish government has not been
forthcoming. It might also be noted
that Polish students invited to the
Harvard seminar at Salzburg were
not permitted to leave the country.
The only opportunity. for Ameri
can students to study in Poland
comes through a combination of
teaching English and studying
Slavic languages. At present there
are Americans in this venture, with
the Polish government providing
8,000 to 10,000 Zlotyes a month for
assistance.
The Polish press is uniformly
anti-American, and although the
Gazetta Lidova (the mouthpiece of
the Peasants' party) is still pub
lished, it is vitriolic in its denuncia
tion of the Western powers.
All the students I saw were un
believably poorly informed about
the United States. I asked about the
Marshall Plan and they had heard
nothing of its contents other than
that it was an imperialistic Ameri
can venture to rearm Germany. But
then they did confess they realized
that they were reading only what
the Moscow-dominated press want
ed published.
DISPIRITED ATTITUDE
Everywhere I went I felt general
discouragement at the fact that the
United States refused to offer its aid
. . . but just what can the Poles do
about their plight? Sandwiched in
between the USSR and the Soviet
zone of Germany, they are in a
hopeless position that of necessity
calls for a friendly policy toward the
USSR. Anything else would be
suicide.
Before I left the university I al
most had to laugh at a pathetic little
donkey-cart, overloaded with bricks
that had been cleared from a pile
of rubble, being brought over to as
sist students who were repairing
another one with the most priimtive
methods possible. It quite reminded
me of the students who were work
ing at the University of Munich.
There, when I asked how long it
would take to rebuild, I was met
with a well-considered "15 years."
Here, with a little hesitation, the
answer I got was "perhaps never."

"Shorty" Oannis.)

"We Poles have a very short memory, I'm afraid," said Mag
dalene as v/e stood viewing the ruins of what once was Warsaw.
Her Jewish relatives had been shipped off to Dachau and death.
Her schoolmates had been slaughtered during the insurrection

that month of horror; and she had
been there when student nurses and

still, she just shrugged her shoul

Beaten by the Nazi war machine

just what opportunities and future

were not so tragic. In place of the
dormitories that housed 3,000 non
residents back in 1939, there is a
lone student house jammed with
(iOO. These, who are the more for
tunate, occupy a building (which
they have repaired) about the size
of a Stanford Village dorm. The
others have the choice of living in
bombed-out buildings, cellars, or
caves in the city or of going into
the country and commuting up to
50 miles a day by street car or
train.
(In reading this and wondering
why students go through the priva
tions they do, one must remember
that the universities wore closed
from 1939 to 1945, although the un
derground did operate universities
from 1940 to August of 1944 in War
saw and Posnan.)
The students are organized into
an association called the Bratnia
Pomoc Studentow, and although
they have a great deal of freedom
within the university they are han
dicapped through lack of funds to
offer much to the student body. In
addition to the student house, this
association has a dining hall on the
campus. They do the best they can,
but facilities are so inadequate that
it takes from three to four hours
to permit the students to eat each
meal.
INADEQUATE DIET
Breakfast consists of coffee (they
used to get UNRRA milk), bread,
and marmalade. Dinner includes
soup and vegetables and on rare oc
casions a little meat. The supper

meal is often a repetition of break
fast. Calories total about 1,500 per
day. Badly needed are dried milk
and eggs, fats, and dried vegetables.
Incidentally, it might be pointed
out that Poland operates on a "free
market" for about 75 per cent of the
population, with no rationing and
uncontrolled prices, whereas the
other 25 per cent (primarily gov
ernment employees) are permitted
to buy certain commodities at fixed
prices. Unfortunately, university
students do not fall into this cate
gory and thus their supplies must be
purchased on the inflated "free
market."
To "exist," a student requires a
minimum of 6,000 Zlotyes a month.
Since the average student wage is
200 a day, a full-time job is needed
in order to get by, and 85 per cent
of them work. Most of them have
lost their homes, many of their fam
ilies have been repatriated to the
"new" territory recovered from
Germany, others have no family at
all.
Speaking of Zlotyes, it might be
interesting to note that though they
are officially pegged at 100 to the
dollar, they have run as high as
1,300 on the black market. I stepped
onto a bus and gave the conductor
20 Zlotyes. I found that though the
fare was only 15 Zlotyes, they are
worth so little one doesn't expect
change. Apples (which were plenti
ful) brought 30 Zlotyes each, shoes
12,000 a pair, a fair meal at a local
restaurant 350, and one in a hotel
650.
SCHOLASTIC OPPORTUNITIES
Getting students out of Poland is
a rather difficult matter. In June of
1946 the Swiss University of Fri
berg awarded five scholarships to
Polish students at the University of
Warsaw. It was not until July of
1947 that the passports were given
to them. The Universities of Zurich
and Bern have also offered scholar
ships but as yet the approval of the
Polish government has not been
forthcoming. It might also be noted
that Polish students invited to the
Harvard seminar at Salzburg were
not permitted to leave the country.
The only opportunity. for Ameri
can students to study in Poland
comes through a combination of
teaching English and studying
Slavic languages. At present there
are Americans in this venture, with
the Polish government providing
8,000 to 10,000 Zlotyes a month for
assistance.
The Polish press is uniformly
anti-American, and although the
Gazetta Lidova (the mouthpiece of
the Peasants' party) is still pub
lished, it is vitriolic in its denuncia
tion of the Western powers.
All the students I saw were un
believably poorly informed about
the United States. I asked about the
Marshall Plan and they had heard
nothing of its contents other than
that it was an imperialistic Ameri
can venture to rearm Germany. But
then they did confess they realized
that they were reading only what
the Moscow-dominated press want
ed published.
DISPIRITED ATTITUDE
Everywhere I went I felt general
discouragement at the fact that the
United States refused to offer its aid
. . . but just what can the Poles do
about their plight? Sandwiched in
between the USSR and the Soviet
zone of Germany, they are in a
hopeless position that of necessity
calls for a friendly policy toward the
USSR. Anything else would be
suicide.
Before I left the university I al
most had to laugh at a pathetic little
donkey-cart, overloaded with bricks
that had been cleared from a pile
of rubble, being brought over to as
sist students who were repairing
another one with the most priimtive
methods possible. It quite reminded
me of the students who were work
ing at the University of Munich.
There, when I asked how long it
would take to rebuild, I was met
with a well-considered "15 years."
Here, with a little hesitation, the
answer I got was "perhaps never."
(This is (lie fourth in a scries of articles by Bill Fairer and Lawrence
"Shorty" Oannis.)

"We Poles have a very short memory, I'm afraid," said Mag
dalene as v/e stood viewing the ruins of what once was Warsaw.
Her Jewish relatives had been shipped off to Dachau and death.
Her schoolmates had been slaughtered during the insurrection
of 1944; she had traveled in the sewers from the Ghetto to the

city and back many times during
that month of horror; and she had
been there when student nurses and
Red Cross workers were machine
gunned just three years ago—but
still, she just shrugged her shoul
ders when 1 said, "You must hate
the Germans."
Beaten by the Nazi war machine
and now dominated by the Russians,
just what opportunities and future
do these students of Warsaw have?
They go to school, they study all
they can, they exist from hand to
mouth . . . and when I asked how
they could be so eager with what
surrounded them, seemingly with
out much of a prayer of recovery, I
got the same reply I had heard in
Vienna, in Munich, in Milan, and in
Athens: "Knowledge is the one
thing that cannot be taken from
us."
The Rector of the University and
the president of the students had
heard little or nothing of the World
Student Relief activities, and prac
tically all information regarding
America's part in assistance of any
sort was lacking.
The TB rate has reached 5 per
cent, while 2 per cent is considered
the danger level. Medical supplies
are low and medical equipment is
almost nil at the university. They
need TB equipment, X-ray films,
vitamin and cod liver oil prepara
tions, and dental cabinets. There is
one major lecture room remaining,
all others having been destroyed,
yet 9,000 are enrolled this fall. The
only major structure in existence is
the library, filled with 1,000,000 vol
umes.

offer much to the student body. In
addition to the student house, this
association has a dining hall on the
campus. They do the best they can,
but facilities are so inadequate that
it takes from three to four hours
to permit the students to eat each
meal.
INADEQUATE DIET
Breakfast consists of coffee (they
used to get UNRRA milk), bread,
and marmalade. Dinner includes
soup and vegetables and on rare oc
casions a little meat. The supper

meal is often a repetition of break
fast. Calories total about 1,500 per
day. Badly needed are dried milk
and eggs, fats, and dried vegetables.
Incidentally, it might be pointed
out that Poland operates on a "free
market" for about 75 per cent of the
population, with no rationing and
uncontrolled prices, whereas the
other 25 per cent (primarily gov
ernment employees) are permitted
to buy certain commodities at fixed
prices. Unfortunately, university
students do not fall into this cate
gory and thus their supplies must be
purchased on the inflated "free
market."
To "exist," a student requires a
minimum of 6,000 Zlotyes a month.
Since the average student wage is
200 a day, a full-time job is needed
in order to get by, and 85 per cent
of them work. Most of them have
lost their homes, many of their fam
ilies have been repatriated to the
"new" territory recovered from
Germany, others have no family at
all.
Speaking of Zlotyes, it might be
interesting to note that though they
are officially pegged at 100 to the
dollar, they have run as high as
1,300 on the black market. I stepped
onto a bus and gave the conductor
20 Zlotyes. I found that though the
fare was only 15 Zlotyes, they are
worth so little one doesn't expect
change. Apples (which were plenti
ful) brought 30 Zlotyes each, shoes
12,000 a pair, a fair meal at a local
restaurant 350, and one in a hotel
650.
SCHOLASTIC OPPORTUNITIES
Getting students out of Poland is
a rather difficult matter. In June of
1946 the Swiss University of Fri
berg awarded five scholarships to
Polish students at the University of
Warsaw. It was not until July of
1947 that the passports were given
to them. The Universities of Zurich
and Bern have also offered scholar
ships but as yet the approval of the
Polish government has not been
forthcoming. It might also be noted
that Polish students invited to the
Harvard seminar at Salzburg were
not permitted to leave the country.
The only opportunity. for Ameri
can students to study in Poland
comes through a combination of
teaching English and studying
Slavic languages. At present there
are Americans in this venture, with
the Polish government providing
8,000 to 10,000 Zlotyes a month for
assistance.
The Polish press is uniformly
anti-American, and although the
Gazetta Lidova (the mouthpiece of
the Peasants' party) is still pub
lished, it is vitriolic in its denuncia
tion of the Western powers.
All the students I saw were un
believably poorly informed about
the United States. I asked about the
Marshall Plan and they had heard
nothing of its contents other than
that it was an imperialistic Ameri
can venture to rearm Germany. But
then they did confess they realized
that they were reading only what
the Moscow-dominated press want
ed published.
DISPIRITED ATTITUDE
Everywhere I went I felt general
discouragement at the fact that the
United States refused to offer its aid
. . . but just what can the Poles do
about their plight? Sandwiched in
between the USSR and the Soviet
zone of Germany, they are in a
hopeless position that of necessity
calls for a friendly policy toward the
USSR. Anything else would be
suicide.
Before I left the university I al
most had to laugh at a pathetic little
donkey-cart, overloaded with bricks
that had been cleared from a pile
of rubble, being brought over to as
sist students who were repairing
another one with the most priimtive
methods possible. It quite reminded
me of the students who were work
ing at the University of Munich.
There, when I asked how long it
would take to rebuild, I was met
with a well-considered "15 years."
Here, with a little hesitation, the
answer I got was "perhaps never."
(This is (lie fourth in a scries of articles by Bill Fairer and Lawrence
"Shorty" Oannis.)

"We Poles have a very short memory, I'm afraid," said Mag
dalene as v/e stood viewing the ruins of what once was Warsaw.
Her Jewish relatives had been shipped off to Dachau and death.
Her schoolmates had been slaughtered during the insurrection
of 1944; she had traveled in the sewers from the Ghetto to the

city and back many times during
that month of horror; and she had
been there when student nurses and
Red Cross workers were machine
gunned just three years ago—but
still, she just shrugged her shoul
ders when 1 said, "You must hate
the Germans."
Beaten by the Nazi war machine
and now dominated by the Russians,
just what opportunities and future
do these students of Warsaw have?
They go to school, they study all
they can, they exist from hand to
mouth . . . and when I asked how
they could be so eager with what
surrounded them, seemingly with
out much of a prayer of recovery, I
got the same reply I had heard in
Vienna, in Munich, in Milan, and in
Athens: "Knowledge is the one
thing that cannot be taken from
us."
The Rector of the University and
the president of the students had
heard little or nothing of the World
Student Relief activities, and prac
tically all information regarding
America's part in assistance of any
sort was lacking.
The TB rate has reached 5 per
cent, while 2 per cent is considered
the danger level. Medical supplies
are low and medical equipment is
almost nil at the university. They
need TB equipment, X-ray films,
vitamin and cod liver oil prepara
tions, and dental cabinets. There is
one major lecture room remaining,
all others having been destroyed,
yet 9,000 are enrolled this fall. The
only major structure in existence is
the library, filled with 1,000,000 vol
umes.
CROWDED HOUSING
As far as the housing situation is
concerned, it would be funny if it
were not so tragic. In place of the
dormitories that housed 3,000 non
residents back in 1939, there is a
lone student house jammed with
(iOO. These, who are the more for
tunate, occupy a building (which
they have repaired) about the size
of a Stanford Village dorm. The
others have the choice of living in
bombed-out buildings, cellars, or
caves in the city or of going into
the country and commuting up to
50 miles a day by street car or
train.
(In reading this and wondering
why students go through the priva
tions they do, one must remember
that the universities wore closed
from 1939 to 1945, although the un
derground did operate universities
from 1940 to August of 1944 in War
saw and Posnan.)
The students are organized into
an association called the Bratnia
Pomoc Studentow, and although
they have a great deal of freedom
within the university they are han
dicapped through lack of funds to
offer much to the student body. In
