# 'Break Down Russian Wall,' Anderson Says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. H (UP).—
The United Slates must "break
down" Russia's political and econ
omic wall through Central Europe
ur keep feeding the western dem
ocracies for a long time to come, Sec
retary of Agriculture Clinton P. An
derson said today.
The only other alternative, he
said, is to withdraw from Europe
completely.
"It just so happens," he said,
"that the principal grain produc
tion areas of Europe—Germany,
Austria and the rich Danube basin,
lie within the Russian zone, and the
deficit areas which must import
food are in the British, French and
American zones."
RUSSIAN SURPLUS
He said he understands that Rus
sia will have 2,000,000 tons of food
for export this year which presum
ably will go to Finland, Romania,
Czechoslovakia and other Soviet
dominated countries.
"We must either break down that
sort of a wall or face the prospect
of exporting grain for a long time
to come," he continued. "We cither
have to get out of Europe, or, if we
remain to try and rehabilitate those
nations, we must recognize the ex
porting problem."
FOOD CONSERVATION
Charles Luckman, chairman of the
President's Food-Conservation Com
mittee, reported meantime that the
drive was "off to a first-rate start."
Highlights on the save food front:
1. A majority of whisky distil
lers reacted angrily to the Presi
dent's demand for a 60-day liquor
making "holiday," but an industry
source said they probably would
have to go along because distillers
are "a vulnerable target."
2. The Methodist church board of
temperance endorsed the holiday on
grounds there is "ample whiskey in
storage to make everyone drunk at
least twice a week for a long time
to come."
