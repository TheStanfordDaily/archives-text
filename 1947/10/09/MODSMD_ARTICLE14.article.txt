# American Way Amazes Brit on Here on Exchange

### BOB CATUDIO 
The virility of America ... its
fast tempo on avenues of agility . . .
and its wealth of greatness mixed
by "the oldness of Europe."
These are the things which have
amazed Bob Heiling, 27-year-old
economics student from London,
England. And to add a touch of
reality to it all, Bob is apt to re
mark unhesitatingly that '"every
thing has been swell'' during his
two weeks in the United States.
Bob is living at Theta Chi and
will be studying at Stanford for one
year, the result of an inter-frater
nity exchange plan which sent one
student from Stanford to England.

"One of the most noticeable things
in America is that most of the peo
ple are not as politically minded as
in London," Bob said. "And the
volatile feeling Americans have for
certain social activities like plays,
athletic games, and parties, is sim
ply astounding.
'"I still can't got used to it all. I

shall want to travel and see as many
things as possible in the time I shall
be here. You just can't comprehend
how much of a break it is to be in
the United States."
The soft-spoken Heiling, an up
per division transfer from the Uni
versity of London, spent more than
six years in the Royal Air Force, "a
period of existence which one can
not reclaim."
He spoke of England—its mass of
historical lore marked on every
building, of Churchill and the
Thames, and of Shakespeare and the
splash of color in the countryside.
FASHION SITUATION
He became involved in the latest
Yankee chinfest, that of discussing
the long-skirted trend in American
women's fashions.
"English women are not too hnp
py in this 'long skirt' change. Fact
is, they do well to dress in a fashion
that is decent and becoming. The
I men are opposed to the trend, but
for purely masculine reasons.'
I While restored to a serious vein of

thought, Heiling was rather sur
prised at the method of teaching
here as compared with the Univer
sity of London.
"In London I took what courses
I thought would benefit me. There
was a plan of educational require
ment, but it was somewhat clastic.
"'Right now. I find one is commit
ted to take certain courses in many
other fields."
FINDS FRIENDLINESS
"In one respect I discovered that
I was very much welcomed here,
quite unlike an attitude of antipathy
I had expected the people of Amer
ica would have in regard to a per
son from England."
He waved his hands in a semi-arc
to indicate the friendliness of the
men at Theta Chi. At times, he has
even had to bar the door at the
deluge of invitations to dine out.
"My letters home are becoming
filled each day with little notes per
taining to incidents that arise dur
ing the day -like the political dis
cussion I had in front of the snack

bar at the Union. It very much .sur
prised me!
"The war did shake England ;i bit,
and I'm sure it has changed since
the Americans came over in such
huge numbers.
"And another thing, I guess you
might say I very much favor a plan
for a bigger student exchange from
different countries. One would learn
much more of nations by actually
visiting them as students or visi
tors."
Bob stood up in the center of his
room staring out over the palm
dotted landscape. He was now a
Stanford student, as he had re
marked so often during the past
week.
One of these days, he would re
turn to England, never to forget the
virile gentlemen at Theta Chi, poli
tics at the Union, or the plain hon
esty and curiousness of the guy next
door who related the history of the
Stanford rough in seven hazy les
sons.
Hut for now. he remains one man '
who "still can't get used to it all." |

The virility of America ... its
fast tempo on avenues of agility . . .
and its wealth of greatness mixed
by "the oldness of Europe."
These are the things which have
amazed Bob Heiling, 27-year-old
economics student from London,
England. And to add a touch of
reality to it all, Bob is apt to re
mark unhesitatingly that '"every

Bob is living at Theta Chi and
will be studying at Stanford for one
year, the result of an inter-frater

"One of the most noticeable things
in America is that most of the peo
ple are not as politically minded as
in London," Bob said. "And the
volatile feeling Americans have for
certain social activities like plays,
athletic games, and parties, is sim
ply astounding.
'"I still can't got used to it all. I

shall want to travel and see as many

The soft-spoken Heiling, an up
per division transfer from the Uni
versity of London, spent more than
six years in the Royal Air Force, "a
period of existence which one can
not reclaim."
He spoke of England—its mass of
historical lore marked on every
building, of Churchill and the
Thames, and of Shakespeare and the
splash of color in the countryside.
FASHION SITUATION
He became involved in the latest
Yankee chinfest, that of discussing
the long-skirted trend in American
women's fashions.
"English women are not too hnp
py in this 'long skirt' change. Fact
is, they do well to dress in a fashion
that is decent and becoming. The
I men are opposed to the trend, but
for purely masculine reasons.'
I While restored to a serious vein of

thought, Heiling was rather sur
prised at the method of teaching
here as compared with the Univer
sity of London.
"In London I took what courses
I thought would benefit me. There
was a plan of educational require
ment, but it was somewhat clastic.
"'Right now. I find one is commit

other fields."
FINDS FRIENDLINESS
"In one respect I discovered that
I was very much welcomed here,
quite unlike an attitude of antipathy
I had expected the people of Amer
ica would have in regard to a per
son from England."
He waved his hands in a semi-arc
to indicate the friendliness of the
men at Theta Chi. At times, he has
even had to bar the door at the
deluge of invitations to dine out.
"My letters home are becoming
