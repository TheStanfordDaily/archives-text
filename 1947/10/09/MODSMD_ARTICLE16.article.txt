# Farrer, Grannis to Speak On Education in Europe
## 
### 
After three months abroad ob
serving principally student condi
tions in European universities, Bill
Farrer and Lawrence Grannis will
bring their first report to the stu
dent body tonight at 7:30 in Cub
berley Auditorium.
The two men lived with univer
sity students, saw the black market
in operation, and learned at first
hand the misconceptions of Ameri
cans held by most Europeans. Their
talk tonight will include suggestions
as to how Americans can combat
this ill feeling so prevalent on the
Continent.
Grannis covered England, France,
Spain, Belgium, and Holland, while
Farrer traveled through Poland,
Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy,
and Czechoslovakia. Farrer left
Athens the first week in September.
The two tours were sponsored by
the ASSU, and Grannis and Farrer
were sent on student body funds
with the approval and assistance of
the administration. The plans were
originally set up by the Interna
tional Students Committee but
turned over to the students after
they passed a referendum in favor
of the plans at last May's elections.
This first report will be as inclu
sive as possible, according to Bob
Hoyt, ISC chairman, but every
phase of the trips could not be pos
sibly covered in one hour. The two
speakers agree that tonight's discus
sion is only a beginning.
Both men want to continue these

discussions with groups all over the
campus', and will accept two speak
ing engagements a week if there is
a demand for them. Their second
talk will be delivered at the Inter
national Club Sunday night.
In addition to describing student
conditions abroad, Farrer and Gran
nis will deal with their itinera, their
costs, and the methods they used in
traveling.
Between talks, the two second
year law students will compile a
written report on their experiences.
These observations will be sent out
to universities and colleges all over
the country and will serve as the
basis for decisions as to whether
other schools will send students
abroad next summer.
A question period will follow the
Farrer-Grannis talk.
