cluding a children's Sunday School
and an adult forum to be held on
Sunday evenings. Questionnaires

handed out to be distributed among
the council members' units. A com
mittee of nine was elected to work
further on the subject.
LAUNDRY NEGLIGENCE
The council warned that negli
gence in the use of the Bendixes at
the laundry must be discontinued.
It is imperative that the traps on
the machines be cleaned after each
use as a protection to the clothes and

the machines. It is hoped that the
men from the dorms, as well as the
wives, will observe this precaution.
Parents were also requested to have
Iheir small children refrain from
throwing rocks in the machines. It
was announced that if outsiders con
tinue to use the laundry it may be
necessary to issue laundry passes to
village residents.
A resolution was passed to keep
solicitors out of the village. Any
solicitors approaching a village fam
ily should be reported to the Coun
sellor's office.
FIRST GRADE MOVED
It was announced that there have
been some necessary changes in
the original children's school plan.
It has been learned that a state law
prohibits both private and public
schools to operate in the same build
ing. Therefore, the first grade has
been moved to the public school in
Menlo Park. However, the kinder
garten will continue to function in
the same building with the nursery
school, remaining under the juris
diction of the School of Education.
At the present time it is hoped that
more can be accepted soon.
In connection with the school, it
was announced that there is to be a
playground erected on the school
grounds. All village children may
use it after school and on weekends
when supervised by their parents.
It was requested that all wet gar
bage be wrapped before disposal in
the unit receptacles.

FIRST GRADE MOVED
It was announced that there have
been some necessary changes in
the original children's school plan.
It has been learned that a state law
prohibits both private and public
schools to operate in the same build
ing. Therefore, the first grade has
been moved to the public school in
Menlo Park. However, the kinder
garten will continue to function in
the same building with the nursery
school, remaining under the juris
diction of the School of Education.
At the present time it is hoped that
more can be accepted soon.
In connection with the school, it
was announced that there is to be a
playground erected on the school
grounds. All village children may
use it after school and on weekends
when supervised by their parents.
It was requested that all wet gar
bage be wrapped before disposal in
the unit receptacles.
