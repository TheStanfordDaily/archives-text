# UN Group Suggests Balkan 'Watchdog'
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 8. (UP).- The United Nations political
committee voted tonight to establish a permanent UN commission to
patrol the Balkans.
The full UN General Assembly must vote.on the proposed "watchdog"
I commission, but the vote in the committee indicated clearly that the

â–º United States could win the two
thirds Assembly vote necessary to
establish the commission.
The committee approved another
paragraph to authorize the commis
sion to call a special session of the
j UN General Assembly, if necessary,
to consider the Greek problem.
The overwhelming vote in favor
of the "watchdog" commission was
an important American victory over
Russia, which has fought bitterly
against any UN "interference" in
the Balkans.
Russia, however, was expected to
be able to put up much stronger re
sistance to an American proposal to
blame Yugoslavia, Albania, and
Bulgaria for Balkan troubles. The
United States offered to drop the
"aggressor" charges if Greece's
northern neighbors would co-oper
ate with the new commission.
