### 
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Oct. B~A busi- i
nessman here finally obtained de
livery on a swanky new automobile ,
by agreeing to accept about $500
worth of "extras," most of which
were additional lights. Besides the
usuals it had two spot lights, two
fog lights, two interior lights, an
emergency brake warning light, two
lights under the hood, a rear com
partment and two rear direc
tional lights.
The second night out he was
pulled up by a cop, who pointed oul
what might be called a lack of hind
sight—the car had no tail light.
