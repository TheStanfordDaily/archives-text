# Chief Warns Careless Smokers

The careless smoker is Public En
emy No. 1, according to the Na
tional Fire Protection Association.
"He alone is responsible for over
100,000 fires every year, with a total
loss of nearly $40,000,000," an NF
PA spokesman said.
Stating that in 1946 the sale of
cigarettes reached the astronomical
total of 351 billionâ€”almost seven a
day for every man, woman, and
child in the United States, the NF
PA points out that this means at
least an equivalent number of
matches were used to light cigar
ettes; every match and every glow
ing butt an incipient breeder of a
destructive fire.
NFPA warns against smoking in
bed and urges every family to have
plenty ol ashtrays handy. They also
ask that every person make sure
that the match or the butt is out
before discarding it, and that
matches be kept out of reach of
small children.
