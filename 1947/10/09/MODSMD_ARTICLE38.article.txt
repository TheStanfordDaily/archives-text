# End Martin Leads PCC Receivers
## 
### 
Gene Martin, Stanford's ace pass
snagging end, upheld Indian honors
as the PCC individual statistics re
leased today. Martin has caught
seven passes and holds a healthy lead
over his conference opponents in
the number of yards gained from
passes.
Gene's seven passes have account
ed for two touchdowns placing him
second in the league in total points
scored. A 1 Morris, who is scheduled
to take Ainslee Bell's quarterback
post in the Santa Clara game, has
completed 16 out of 37 passes for a
net gain of 178 yards and places
high in this department.
Mike Durket, Stanford's punting
discovery, has averaged 35.5 yards
per kick, which is excellent for the
beginning of the season.
Leading in total offensive yard
age for the Pacific Coast is Idaho's
triple threat tailback, Bill Williams.
Williams' 423 yards gained in 115
passing and rushing plays gives him
a Slight lead over Norm Van Brock
lin of Oregon. Van Brocklin tops
the Conference passers with 28 com
pletions for a total of 368 yards.
George Murphy of USC has the
highest percentage of pass comple
tions, making good 7 out of 13 throws
for 54 percent.
The hard-charging California line
men enabled Bear captain Johnny
Graves to pile up 184 yards from
rushing against the St. Mary's Gaels
Saturday and take over the Confer
ence rushing lead. His season total
to date of 236 yards in 25 carries
places him on top in yardage gained,
and second to Bruin Cal Rossi in
average gain per play.
