# Church Organist to Give First of Four Recitals
## 
### 
Organist Warren D. Allen will
j present the first of four recitals of
Baroque music today at 4:15 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
The program will include "Fanta
sia in Echo Style," composed by Jan
j Pieter Sweenlinch. The piece makes
| use of the echo which was much
i used in the 16th century because it
afforded the only expression change
| possible before the introduction of
the crescendo.
Mr. Allen will play "Toccata for
j the Elevation," by Girolamo Fresco
baldi, twice: first without dynamic
changes, and then in the modern
manner with more romantic tone
colors.
