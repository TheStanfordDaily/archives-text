# Durocher or Shotten?
## That's Rickey's Problem 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (UP).—Brooklyn Dodger President Branch Rickey
got around to send a mildly unenthusiastic telegram of congratulations
to the New York Yankees for winning the World Series today, then re
vealed the not too startling news that "I positively will have a manager
by March 1." • «
Rickey, refusing to be backed into a corner on reports that he is abso-

lutely through with Leo Durocher
and that neither the noisy playboy
nor 63-year-old Burt Shotton will
be at the helm of the club next year,
simply was evasive.
Asked point blank if Durocher
would return to run the club now
that his one-season suspension from
baseball has been lifted by Com
missioner A. B, (Happy) Chandler,
Rickey replied, "Frankly, I don't
know."
"And I'm not giving you double
talk," he added. '"Last year I signed
my manager in October and wound
up at the start of the season with
out one. This year I positively will
have a manager by March 1, but not
necessarily before then."
Durocher conferred with Rickey
briefly tonight. However, a Dodger
spokesman described the visit as "a
social call," and said that Lippy im
mediately left for the airport where
he was scheduled to leave for Cali
fornia at midnight.
Rickey conferred at length with
Shotton and other Dodger officials,
including scouts, coaches, and minor
league farm club heads, and it was
indicated that a number of players
would be shifted to the parent
Dodger club. It also was emphasized
that a number of the players who
were with the club in their gallant
but futile stand against the Yankees
might be transferred or sold.
One rather sizzling report which
could not be either confirmed or
denied here or in Boston was that
the Braves had made a bid for Pis
tol Pete Reiser, the Dodger center
fielder, who failed to play up to ex
pectations in the World Series be
cause of injuries.
