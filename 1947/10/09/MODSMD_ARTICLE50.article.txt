# Student-Administration Meeting
## 
### 
Monday night three members of the admin
istration and five student represntatives met
at the home of President Donald B. Tresidder
in the first meeting for this guarter of what
has been called "the student-administration
forum."
The University administration was repre
sented by Vice-president Alvin C. Eurich and
Dean of Students Lawrence Kimpton, in addi
tion to Dr. Tresidder.
Students present were Tom Martzloff, presi
dent of the student body, Guyla Runyon, vice
president of the student body, Bob Berryman,
president of Cardinals, Phyllis Sutherland,
president of Women's Conference, and George
Caulfield, editor of The Daily.
The student-administration meetings are in
formal. No policies are established. No regu
lations are put into effect.
The meetings allow a discussion of the mis
understandings and problems which arise
between the students and the administration.
They also provide a sounding board for the
ideas of both groups.
Monday night most of the discussion cen

tered upon two subjects. Martzloff announced
that a student policy on campus political ac
tion groups would be decided at the Excom
meeting Wednesday night (last night). All
present expressed their views on different
aspects of the topic.
Berryman asked for the constructive critic
ism of several phases of the Homecoming
Week program. Cardinals is working to make
this year's alumni homecoming during the
Big Game weekend something the graduates
will long remember.
All representatives agreed that the name
"forum" inaccurately describes this type of
meeting. Alternatives suggested included
"conference" and "round-table."
Dean Kimpton expressed a desire to see "a
free flow of information between students and
administration." He said the forum can do
much along this line.
Monday's student-administration meeting
was a success in all respects. These meetings
will lead to better student-administration un
derstanding and will prove highly beneficial
to the students of Stanford in the years to
come.
