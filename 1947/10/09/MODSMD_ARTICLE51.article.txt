### WAYNE SARGENT 
Hello Horselovers, are you broke again? Did you
go to summer school, when you know full well you're
big enough to lift a shovel, and earn a salary?
We got something for you today in the 6th at
Golden Gate that will pay off like Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
This horse has been held baek like a pall bearer's
laugh. He's ready. The name of this wonder is
Pickle Face. He'll open like an alligator's mouth and
close the same way. The judges said the way for
Pickle Face to win a race is to put the reins in the
horse's mouth and the bit and saddle on the jockey.
That's because he lost his last race. He had an acci
dent. He came out of the stall backward and ran the
track clockwise. It could happen to anyone.
At the gate old Pickle Face will be 50 to 1, so
get your prunes on this pony.
Lay a double on Pickle Face, vets, and collect
your bonus for all future wars.
He's hotter than a Chinese laundry on a Saturday
August morning. Every hair in his inane is a torch,
and every hoof a train depot stove. The horse has
a personal interest in the race. If he loses he won't
be able to go home and face fodder.
You might think we like Pickle Face in the 16th.

We do. His mother is a personal friend. Maybe you've
seen pictures of the horse taken with his name-sake,
the owner. The owner usually stands on the left.
We heard from him that the nag is a shoo-in.
Pickle Face is tuned up like the Philharmonic at
8:29 for an 8:30 concert. The jockey's a Stanford
graduate. Bet the family silver. The horse is an old
age pension with legs.
And for those of you who have been playing "The
Day's Best Bets" (now on sale in the Daily shack for
25c), forget what happened yesterday. Remember the
story about the farmer who was going to shoot a
fly oil a cow's back. When he missed and killed the
cow he said:
"Hellâ€”that's only my first shot."
We all make mistakes. Some days even Stanford
doesn't make money. As a consolation, all losers in
vited to a barbecue tonight. We're having porter
horse steak.
Also we're selling stock in a newly organized glue
factory. The raw material is abundant.
But don't forget Piekle Face. Double up on him
and get your watch out of hock. He's more certain
than a Saturday football score on a Monday morning.
He's as sure as California rain. And when it rains, a
jockey's best friend is his mudder.
