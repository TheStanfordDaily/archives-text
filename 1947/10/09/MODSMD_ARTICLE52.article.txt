### CECIL ROSPAW 
After having a comparatively quiet summer of
almost monastic seclusion, broken only by a stray
copy of "Vogue" magazine which somehow got con
fused with my subscription copy of "Gags, Inc."
(much better than any of the comic books) imagine
my surprise to come back to this great campus, which
is supposedly training the men and women who will
be the future leaders, etc., and to find that even
"Vogue" magazine at its worst couldn't predict the
dire calamity that would overtake the bright young
women of Stanford.
After leaning on three telephone poles that moved
away I put on my glasses and realized that the worst
was really true. Although they were well-hidden, I
deciphered that they were really women and those
long draperies were not hiding someone preparing
for an afternoon wedding, but actually honest-to
goodness everyday go-to-school skirts.
Madame Saperelli isn't selling enough clothes in
Paris (where only a few can afford them anyway)
(Those Communists!) and exclaims in a loud, and
probably nauseating voice that skirts will be longer
this year—and what do our bright young things
do but run right down to Moe's and buy out every
old wedding dress he has been holding in the specials
department since most of their mothers were coeds.
They were keeping the men away in droves by exactly
the same type of clothing then. (Clothing! it is closer
to tenting.)
But there are political implications all wrapped
lip in these new wrap around house-coats that are

now "polite"' wear. It was in the early twenties —
or light after the last war—when skirts took the
same type of nose-dive. Women became ashamed of
being women, and men had to turn to something, so
they started making money and speculating. The
stock market rose, men became more interested in
money, women got tired of being ignored, shortened
their skirts and started looking like women again.
The men ignored the markets, and money, and what
happened? Crash and depression. All because wo
men must tamper with their skirts.
I would like to make a prediction. Soon broom
manufacturers will have to go out of business be
cause all floors will be swept clean from the swish of
the "new" spring silhouette. The broom manufactur
ers will complain. At the same time the depression
cycle will have been started. (Ask some econ major
how this works—l am confused—l wish so many
people wouldn't agree with that last statement.) The
old women vs. money cycle will also go through its
sad routine once more. When skirts arc high again
look for the darndest depression we have ever seen.
Long skirts are, and this will shock most of Stan
ford, the result of an insidious Communist plot. The
Commies know that they can only take over a chaotic
Europe. By using up twice as much material they
figure that only half as many people will be clothed.
Unclothed people will be more than ripe for com
munism. Therefore anyone caught wearing long
skirts is helping further Communist domination of
Europe.
