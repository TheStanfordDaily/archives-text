To the Editor, The Stanford Daily:
Some of my party-line acquaintances have de
nounced me as a "decadent bourgeois reactionary'
because I didn't agree that Russians were angels
Now Mr. MiddlekaufT says I think like a fellow
traveler because I don't consider the Truman Doctrinc
very highly. 1 refuse to endorse aggresive nation
alism, either Stalin's or Truman's brand, and niv
therefore fated to have mud slung at me by botl
sides.
I know as well as Mr. MiddlekaufT that Russi;
and her satellites are not very democratic and thai
they are aggressive. This does not justify our sup
port of dictatorships abroad any more than it justifiec

English. French, and American ;iid to Hitler during
prewar years.
Perhaps Mr. MiddlekaufT doesn't remember that
we not only allowed the Nazis to get strong but
materially aided tlicm in order to have a bulwark
against Bolshevism. I'm sure Mr. MiddlekaufT re
members the results of that effort.
If we must aid Greece, Turkey, et al, we should
at least make sure that the people of these countries
obtain democratic rights similar to ours. Or is Mr.
MiddlekaufT interested in protecting the sovereignty
of tyrants.' And do we also have to protect Spain
and Argentina against the Soviets?
