# Frosh Protest Election Date
## 
### 
Members of the freshman class
showed an early interest in the
affairs of their government yester
day when approximately 400 new
students, or one-third of the class,
voiced protest, in the form of a pe
tition, to the election date which
was set for them by Excom at its
Wednesday nigh meeing.
Boiled down, the proest was one
against "action without represen
tation," since the. frosh had no
classmen there at the time. Student
sponsors attending the session spoke
up for their wards, but to no avail.
Excom set the date for the prima
ries for Oct. 22 if four nominations
were received for each office. The
final election date was then sched
uled for Oct. 29. The freshmen
claimed that since nominations
would have to be made soon, not
enough time had been allotted the
class of '51 to get acquainted enough
to choose qualified leaders from
their ranks of 1,200.
To be elected arc class officers
and representatives on Excom.
The signers of the petition, ad
dressed to the editor of The Daily,
quoted the constitution as setting
the election time for the sixth week
of the quarter, although the elecions
can be held four weeks before or
after that, time.
