# 'Stalled' Cardinal Pigskinners Will Tangle With Santa Clara
## Bob Anderson May Start; Bell, Titus, Nafziger Out of Game Tomorrow 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
Solidly entrenched in the win basement, Stanford's stalled
Indians come back in their own class tomorrow when they
tangle with Santa Clara's inept Broncos at the Farm Stadium.
For the second week in succession the Cardinals go into a
game at less than half strength. This time the long injury list adds

the names of quarterback Ainslie
Bell, halfback Mickey Titus, and
fullback Jim Nafziger. Add to this
list right half George Quist and the
backfield picture is anything but
bright.
808 ANDERSON BACK
On the credit side of the ledger,
cripple Bob Anderson comes back
into action at left half. Still sport
ing a pretty tender shoulder, Bob
suited up this week but watched
two days of intensive scrimmage
from the sidelines. He is tentative
ly slated to start tomorrow's game.
The news from the Santa Clara
camp oozes gloom. Tom Payne, the
Bronco's best tackle, has failed to
recover from lime burns suffered in
the Fresno State contest and top
halfback Hall Haynes is still hob
bling around on gimpy legs. Never
an optimist, Coach Len Casanova
practically concedes the game to the
Indians after watching his club
scrimmage Wednesday. Casanova
is reported to have said: "I'd start
the freshman team against Stanford
if I could."
INDIANS "GET TOUGH"
A little more optimistic than Cas
anova, Marchie Schwartz sent the
Indian first and seconds against the
B squad in a "get tough" scrimmage
Wednesday evening. The emphasis
looked to be on blocking and tack
ling, a football item the Card:;
showed little of in their first two
games against Idaho and Michigan.
Last week's Michigan debacle,
although a crushing defeat for the
Redmen, did have its compensating
factors. Several unknowns on the
Indian roster came through in the
second half to play sparkling ball
against the Wolverines. Newcomers
lJan Mervin and Bob Ghilotti looked
good at ends, Harry Davison, a
tackle, showed promise and Ken
dall Peck, Julian Field, and Fred
Parsons in the backfield showed
they will be able substitutes for
Marehie Schwartz's eleven.
MORRIS HEARS LOAD
The man with the heavy load to
morrow will be quarterback A 1 Mor
ris. 7 he,25-year-old San Franciscan
was a standout in the Michigan en
counter completing 10 passes in 24
attempts for 112 yards gained. Don
Campbell gets the call at the right
half spot with Marty Anderson start
ing at fullback. It will probably be
Bob Anderson at left half but he's
not a sure starter. Just in case
"Rapid Robert" is not ready Wayne
Erickson goes for the Red.

Indians come back in their own class tomorrow when they
tangle with Santa Clara's inept Broncos at the Farm Stadium.
For the second week in succession the Cardinals go into a
game at less than half strength. This time the long injury list adds

the names of quarterback Ainslie
Bell, halfback Mickey Titus, and
fullback Jim Nafziger. Add to this
list right half George Quist and the
backfield picture is anything but
bright.
808 ANDERSON BACK
On the credit side of the ledger,
cripple Bob Anderson comes back
into action at left half. Still sport
ing a pretty tender shoulder, Bob
suited up this week but watched
two days of intensive scrimmage
from the sidelines. He is tentative
ly slated to start tomorrow's game.
The news from the Santa Clara
camp oozes gloom. Tom Payne, the
Bronco's best tackle, has failed to
recover from lime burns suffered in
the Fresno State contest and top
halfback Hall Haynes is still hob
bling around on gimpy legs. Never
an optimist, Coach Len Casanova
practically concedes the game to the
Indians after watching his club
scrimmage Wednesday. Casanova
is reported to have said: "I'd start
the freshman team against Stanford
if I could."
INDIANS "GET TOUGH"
A little more optimistic than Cas
anova, Marchie Schwartz sent the
Indian first and seconds against the
B squad in a "get tough" scrimmage
Wednesday evening. The emphasis
looked to be on blocking and tack
ling, a football item the Card:;
showed little of in their first two
games against Idaho and Michigan.
Last week's Michigan debacle,
although a crushing defeat for the
Redmen, did have its compensating
factors. Several unknowns on the
Indian roster came through in the
second half to play sparkling ball
against the Wolverines. Newcomers
lJan Mervin and Bob Ghilotti looked
good at ends, Harry Davison, a
tackle, showed promise and Ken
dall Peck, Julian Field, and Fred
Parsons in the backfield showed
they will be able substitutes for
Marehie Schwartz's eleven.
MORRIS HEARS LOAD
The man with the heavy load to
morrow will be quarterback A 1 Mor
ris. 7 he,25-year-old San Franciscan
was a standout in the Michigan en
counter completing 10 passes in 24
attempts for 112 yards gained. Don
Campbell gets the call at the right
half spot with Marty Anderson start
ing at fullback. It will probably be
Bob Anderson at left half but he's
not a sure starter. Just in case
"Rapid Robert" is not ready Wayne
Erickson goes for the Red.
Solidly entrenched in the win basement, Stanford's stalled
Indians come back in their own class tomorrow when they
tangle with Santa Clara's inept Broncos at the Farm Stadium.
