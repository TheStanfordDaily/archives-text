Molly Shaw and Bill Dirker, co
chairmen of the Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization, will at
tend the World Student Service
Federation regional meeting at Ma
rin Junior College this Sunday as
Stanford's official representatives, it
has been decided by Excom.
"We would rather send the chair
man of our coming all-in-one fall
quarter drive," Tom Martzloff, AS
SU president, said last night. "But
we got the notice of the conference
too late to appoint a drive commit
tee head. Our drive isn't until No
vember."
Of particular interest to Stanford
is the part of the confab devoted to
drive campaign technique, accord
ing to Martzloff. "7'hat is why we
particularly wanted our drive head
to go," he said. "But Molly and
Bill are certainly capable. They will
report to Excom when they get
back."
Shaw and Dirker will also serve
in advisory capacities to the drives
committee when it is formed
Botli WSSF, which is holding the
convention, and SIRO, the group
Shaw and Dirker head, will prob
ably receive chunks of the contri
butions to the one big drive.
Martzloff also expressed an inter
est in the part of the convention
conducted by the National Studentr-'
Association, in which Stanford is
contemplating membership.
"We need as much information a;
possible about the NSA so that we
can intelligently decide whether to
associate with it or not," Martzloff
said.
