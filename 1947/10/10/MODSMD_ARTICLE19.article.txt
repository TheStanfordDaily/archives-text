I.en ! i. is the Class of '64 complet
ing its first week this morning
;it (he Stanford Village Nursery
.School.
Thrust into a world of toy blocks
and dolls while "papa goes to col
logo," the youngsters, some 40 in
number, are top billing in a plan
conit— true fostered by the Stanford
School of Education.
The School of Education, fortu
nately enough, is supplying the
school at the Village with certain
liccessary materials as well as lend
ing an unlimited amount of moral
support.
SOCIAL PATTERN PRESENT
"We at the Village think it to be
n fine venture," Herbert Wunder
lich, Village resident counselor for
men, said yesterday. "There now
exists a feeling that there is a social
pattern within the Village."
Aside from the instructor, Stan
ford Village mothers and members
of I he Peninsula Junior League are
having quite a time watching over
the children.
Classes are held from 9 to noon
nnd from 1 to 4 in the afternoon, the
curriculum consisting of free recre
ation, supervised play, story listen
ing, and moments of cat napping
and rushes toward the graham
cracker snack bar.
After telling the story of a run
away train, Lucy Millette, "dear
loechur" to the youngsters, stood

near the doorway, arms akimbo.
This was her first week of school.
LISTENING TO CHILDREN
"You can learn quite a lot from
small children just by watching
them and listening to what they
say," she said. "Naturally, they are
in a new atmosphere — that of a
school—but they are as active as
ever.
"And it's fun working with them.
In time, they'll acquire a co-opera
tive spirit . . . and they'll be attend
ing grade school soon enough."
Mrs. Mallette, who is not alien to
the ways of child psychoolgy, re
ceived the A.B. from Pomona Col
lege and last year was awarded the
M.A. from Smith College.
In a former non-com officers'
club, the nursery is a vast wonder
land of artists' paper "canvasses,"
small furniture sets, and paint-chip
ped replicas of Clara the Cow.
INFANT ARTISANS
Clothing lockers were once wood
en crates and a wide, low table, cov
ered with blue oilcloth, serves as a
table where would-be clay artisans
ply their childish ingenuity.
Most of the students, ranging in
ages from 2 to 4, are not too bash
ful to tell visitors that "my daddy
goes to school, too!" And they
dance veritable jigs when their

mothers call for them at 4 each af
ternoon.
Despite the never-ending laugh
ter of the youngsters, Mrs. Mallette
is perhaps the happiest person in
the school. There are numerous
times when she has soothed a nur
sery freshman in blue rompers from
the after-effects of a battle over a
metal toy machine with the freckle
faced four - year - old senior from
Apartment 1500.
"I'm not from a large family my
self," Mrs. Mallette said in a gay,
festive mood that accentuated
naught but love of duty. "Maybe
it's because I love to be with chil
dren—to help them."
MAGIC TOUCH EVIDENT
The venture • into "Operations
Nursery School" has been met with
near unanimous approval from all
concerned. In a community of more
than 2,000 people, the sight of chil
dren has added a kind of magical
touch of goodness to the populace.
Perhaps it is the pained repro
ductions of infant Picasso canvases
that brighten the nursery corners.
Perhaps it is the sound of chil
dren's voices shouting to the winds.
But what ever it is, they have
christened it"the Class of '64."
