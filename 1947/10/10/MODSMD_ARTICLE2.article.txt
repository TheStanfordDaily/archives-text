# Holland Still Suffers From War Ravages

Lawrence Grannis.)

Stanford students today would
not find Holland a vacationer's par
adise. They wouldn't, for the Neth
erlands have riot, yet repaired the
economic and physical damage
wrought by years of war and occu
pation.
Moreover, they are now faced
with the loss of their colonial pos
sessions— the mainspring of their
prosperity for years past. Hence
their task is a double one—revive
and rebuild at home and find eco
nomic substitutes for their colonies
overseas.
Right now it's anybody's guess if
they will succeed —if Holland can
come back before the assets abroad
she is now liquidating (to finance
foreign purchases) are exhausted.
In short, it is a huge gamble, and I
gathered from the business men I
met that the odds are about the
same as drawing to an inside
straight at poker.
HOLLAND HAS SHORTAGES
In terms of everyday life, it
means that the familiar Western
European pattern is repeated in
Holland — stringent rations, liigh
prices and high taxes, shortages, and
black markets.
The experiences of Franz and
Connie, a young couple I visited in
The Hague, are fairly representa
tive. Connie is an American girl
and an ex-Wave; Franz, a young
lieutenant in the Dutch navy. They
met when Franz passed through
Mare Island after three years as a
POW in Japan—but on arrival in
the Netherlands, any similarity their
story might have to those you see
in the Ponds Soap ads abruptly
ceased.
t'OUPLIi I SNI) APARTMENT
They found an apartment only af
ter months of searching: two rooms
and a half bath plus a small room
F'Yanz made into a kitchen. (When
they want to take a bath they ride
the trolley across the city to the
apartment of Franz's mother.)
Connie does her cooking on a
couple of burners. There is no re
frigerator, nor is there any hot wa
ter. At that, they feel exceptionally
lucky to have found the place; while
the government limits each couple
to two rooms (three with children),
many are still homeless.
FOOD PROBLEM
Despite the fact that Franz gets
slightly larger rations because of his
navy service, food is a constant
problem. Meat, sugar, coffee, fate,

and even cheese are all bu missing
from the menu. Fish and bread are
fairly plentiful, and in summer
there are many fresh vegetables in
the markets.
While they laugh about it now,
last winter was a trying ordeal. The
scanty coal ration combined with an
especially bitter winter forced them
literally to live in one room. Con
nie would put on her heavy coat
and step into the kitchen only long
enough to cook. The crowning blow
fell when the water taps froze; for
weeks the only water they had was
contained in two buckets hauled up
from three flights below.
BERLIN HUNGRY
With all this, Franz and Connie
counted themselves lucky to be liv
ing in Holland rather than in the
neighboring states of Western Eu
rope, excepting Belgium. And it is
true there are more plentiful and
more varied foods in Holland than
in England,' and at much lower
prices than in France. Compared to
nearby Germany, Holland seems al
most flourishing. At least there is
no hunger as in Berlin and, to a
lesser degree, in Paris.
About the future, Franz is hope
ful but not really optimistic because
Holland's position, at best, is shaky.
But if stolid patience, courage, and
energy count in the Europe of 1947,
the hopes of Franz and his country
men may be rewarded—and this
once-rich country may regain to a
reasonable degree its former pros
perity.
