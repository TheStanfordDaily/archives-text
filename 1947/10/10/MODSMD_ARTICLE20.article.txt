# 'A Dream Come True'--Stanford Village History
## 
### FRANK SARLES 
Stanford Village is the modern j
version of a phenomenon common j
to early California history — the j
thriving boom - town. Unlike its |
Gold Rush predecessors, however, it
did not spring into being us a law
less conglomeration of individuals.
Rather, it was a carefully planned j
model of democratic government.
As soon as the University as
sumed control of the Army's Dibble
General Hospital on Aug. 1, 1946,
plans were formulated for setting
up an off - campus housing unit
which would enjoy the degree of
self - government common to »I1
Farm organizations, but which
would become an integral part of
the Stanford Family.
The first student interest in the
new project materialized in a con
test to find a name for it. "Stanford
Village" won out over such intrigu
ing entries as '"Stanvetford," "Last
Resort," and "Litchfield."
The first -single students were ad
mitted to the Village on Sept. 19,
1946, and by Sept. 27 there was a
total student population of 1,313. As
each of the 300 apartments was
completed, it was occupied by a
student family. The last apartment
was finished in May, 1947.
At a meeting of the Village Coun
cil on Oct. 15, 1946, the present con
stitution was drawn up and sent to

ASSU for approval. It provided for
house officers — president, social
chairman, treasurer, and athletic
chairman — and a Village Council
composed of house presidents.
When it became evident that the
apartment residents would have |
problems of their own, a Village
Family Council was founded for
their use. Through natural proc
esses —as any married man can af
firm—this organization has evolved
into a matriarchy. It concerns itself
with such unique college problems
as garbage disposal, fences, and pre
natal advice.
The Village extra-curricular pro
gram has evolved rapidly. Present
activities include touch football,
basketball, tennis, volleyball, bowl
ing, a camera club, and an extreme
ly active International Club.
The Village is more nearly self
sufficient than most communities of
its size. Soon after opening, it was

equipped with a post office, baby
clinic, barber shop, haberdashery,
"general store," cleaners and laun
dry, soda fountain, self - service
t laundry, bowling alley, and cafe
teria. A grocery store, meat mar
ket, nursery, and kindergarten have
been added in the last few months.
Despite the present record popu
lation of 2,45)0 faculty, students,
wives, and children, the Village
continues to function efficiently as a
University unit. This is due in large

measure to the competence of
Counselor Herbert Wunderlich, As
sistant Counselor Clair E. Cunning
ham, Director Dwight B. Adams,
and their staff. It is also a tribute
to the give-and-take spirit evinced
by most of the residents.
"Self-government and behavior in
the Village have been of the highest
order and give promise of a real ex
perience in tolerance and under
standing for the larger society," said
Wunderlich.

to early California history — the j
thriving boom - town. Unlike its |
Gold Rush predecessors, however, it
did not spring into being us a law
less conglomeration of individuals.
Rather, it was a carefully planned j
model of democratic government.
As soon as the University as
sumed control of the Army's Dibble
General Hospital on Aug. 1, 1946,
plans were formulated for setting
up an off - campus housing unit
which would enjoy the degree of
self - government common to »I1
Farm organizations, but which
would become an integral part of
the Stanford Family.
The first student interest in the
new project materialized in a con
test to find a name for it. "Stanford
Village" won out over such intrigu
ing entries as '"Stanvetford," "Last
Resort," and "Litchfield."
The first -single students were ad
mitted to the Village on Sept. 19,
1946, and by Sept. 27 there was a
total student population of 1,313. As
each of the 300 apartments was
completed, it was occupied by a
student family. The last apartment
was finished in May, 1947.
At a meeting of the Village Coun
cil on Oct. 15, 1946, the present con
stitution was drawn up and sent to

ASSU for approval. It provided for
house officers — president, social
chairman, treasurer, and athletic
chairman — and a Village Council
composed of house presidents.
When it became evident that the
apartment residents would have |
problems of their own, a Village
Family Council was founded for
their use. Through natural proc
esses —as any married man can af
firm—this organization has evolved
into a matriarchy. It concerns itself
with such unique college problems
as garbage disposal, fences, and pre
natal advice.
The Village extra-curricular pro
gram has evolved rapidly. Present
activities include touch football,
basketball, tennis, volleyball, bowl
ing, a camera club, and an extreme
ly active International Club.
The Village is more nearly self
sufficient than most communities of
its size. Soon after opening, it was

equipped with a post office, baby
clinic, barber shop, haberdashery,
"general store," cleaners and laun
dry, soda fountain, self - service
t laundry, bowling alley, and cafe
teria. A grocery store, meat mar
ket, nursery, and kindergarten have
been added in the last few months.
Despite the present record popu
lation of 2,45)0 faculty, students,
wives, and children, the Village
continues to function efficiently as a
University unit. This is due in large

measure to the competence of
Counselor Herbert Wunderlich, As
sistant Counselor Clair E. Cunning
ham, Director Dwight B. Adams,
and their staff. It is also a tribute
to the give-and-take spirit evinced
by most of the residents.
"Self-government and behavior in
the Village have been of the highest
order and give promise of a real ex
perience in tolerance and under
standing for the larger society," said
Wunderlich.
