# 'Legs, Lover' Here Sunday
## 
### 
A decade ago the Hays office ob
jected to it; this week, Farm Sunday
Movie-goers will be delighted by
it. It's Marlene (Legs) Dietrich's
famous bathtub scene in the 1936
color film, "The Garden of Allah."
The theme of this epic, starring
Miss Dietrich and Charles (The
Lover) Boyer, is a variation of that
old, old story. A wealthy orphan,
Dietrich, raised in a convent, is sent
off into the desert at the suggestion
of the Mother Superior. There she
soon meets a renegade monk, Boyer,
who proposes marriage without giv
ing any details as to his personal
background.
The couple enjoy the life of the
North Sahara until a French army
officer recognizes the monk, provid
ing a somewhat unusual end to the
story.
The program will include selected
short subjects and the second thrill
packed chapter of the exciting serial
"Flash Gordon." The Lover will un
doubtedly get out of the desert, and
Legs may or may not get out of the
tub, but will Flash be able to escape
the horrible pit into which the cruel
Emperor Ming has dropped him?
The answer is obvious; however, the
method remains to be seen.
The doors of the Memorial Au
ditorium will open at 7 Sunday eve
ning, and the program will start
promptly at 7:30, according to mov
ie manager Bob Manning. Admis
sion is 20 cents, including tax.
