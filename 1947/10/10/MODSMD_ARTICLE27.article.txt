# Indians, Bears, Dons, Illinois Rated Choices for Weekend
## 
### 
The Daily sports staff, all puffed up with pride over a re
spectable prognostication performance last week, herewith pre
sents its considered judgments on this weekend s leading foot
ball games.

STANFORD - SANTA CLARA:
The 10 writers polled unanimously
pick the Indians to register their first
victory of the season at the expense
of the Broncos. For both teams, it
seems to b a case of good offensive
weapons and poor defensive strength.
Consensus: Stanford by !) points.
ARMY-ILLINOIS: Seven staff
members predict that the Cadets
long unbeaten record will come to
an end against the Illini. The other
three stick with West Point.
Consensus: Illinois by 5 points.
NAVY-DUKE: Navy, after a bril
liant losing stand against Army last
year, seems to have slipped back in
to its losing ways.
Consensus: Duke by '•) points.
USF-IVIISSISSIPPI STATE: Tex
McKeever's undefeated Dons run
into a tough one tomorrow, but the
spoils staff—nine to one —picks them
to win.
Consensus: USE by 7 points.
CAL-WISCONSIN: The Badgers
may prove to be the first real test
lor Lynn Waldorf's Bears. Wiscon
sin is hot a particularly strong team,
as far as Big Nine competition is
concerned, but any Big Nine team
can be, and too often is potential
poison to a West Coast eleven.
Consensus: California by !) points.
USO-01110 STATE: Another one
of "them things"—a West Coast and
Big Nine meeting. And again the
sports staff climbs out on a shaky
limb and sides with the western rep
resentative.
Consensus: USC by 7 points.
UCLA-OREGON: The Bruins are
mad at the world after their 27-26
whisker-thin defeat at the hands of
Northwestern last week. It is Ore
gon's tough luk to have to serve as a

recipient of the Uclans fury.
Consensus: UCLA by 27 points.
WASHINGTON - ST. MARY'S:
Wedemeyer & Co. aren't the fast
striking outfit they were during the
war. That much was proved last
week at Berkeley. And, what is
more, Washington—a good team —is
just about due to break out into a
scoring rush.
Consensus: Washington by 14
points.
Other consensus predictions:
Michigan State over Washington
State by 8 points.
Minnesota over Northwestern by
1 point.
Notre Dame over Purdue by 29
points.
Oregon State over Idaho by 1G
points.
Last week's prediction record:
Nine games picked. Six correct.
Two wrong. One tie. Percentage
.750.
