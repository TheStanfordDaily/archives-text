# Broncs Provide R-R-R-Rough Football History for Cardinals
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Number 29 in the series of Stan
ford-Santa Clara backyard rivalries
will be airborne for posterity to
morrow afternoon along a route
that has been paved with thrills
since lf>l4.
The men of Stanford —the Nev
erses, Corbuses, Alberts, Erbs,
Lawsons, and Crayons—are in the
shadow of eras past.
And the men of Jesuit learning—
the Falaschis, Bealses, Doughertys,
and Sehiechles — will populate the
sidelines turning over many a re
membrance of other Card - Bronco
battles.
BEGAN IN 1914
In the twilight portion of 1914 was
born the beginning of the Stanford-
Santa Clara rugby football relation
ships. The provincials turned back
the Broncos 13 to 0, but not without
a fight.
The Daily printed the following:
"Better than any of the scoring
plays was the lunge with which
Danny Carroll sent Voight to touch
in-goal after his 40-yard race to
ward the line, with Wallace, which
made the cipher on Santa Clara's
scoreboard nervous . . ."
In brief, highlights of some of the
games past would appear thusly:
194G — The Cards defeated the
Broncos in an offensive battle, 33 to
2G. Remember a man named Mev
riman?
FREITAS TOO GOOD
1942—A tall, novice named Roy
Hammett had yet to attain peak

performance. Mortals like Jess |
Freitas, A 1 Beals, and A 1 Santucci '
won out in a closie for the Broncos, j
14 to 6.
1941 —Too much Frank Albert and
Buck Fawcett, the Shaughnessy
Tribe winning, 27 to 7.
1940 —A scare for the Shaughnes
sy legions: Stanford 7, Santa Clara
6. Pete Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor
were worth the one-point differ
ence.
The Indians, starting in 1930, au-

I thored five wins and a tie, thanks
' to a legendary group later to lie
I known as the "Vow Boys." Bobby
Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Monk
Moscrip, and Keith Topping! The
Cards could do no wrong.
TIIRKE IN HOW
The scene creeps further back
into faded remembrances, like the
year of 191G, when Charley Austin's
southern charges unraveled the
Cards, 2H to 5, in 70 minutes of rug
by football.

ward the line, with Wallace, which
made the cipher on Santa Clara's
scoreboard nervous . . ."
In brief, highlights of some of the
games past would appear thusly:
194G — The Cards defeated the
Broncos in an offensive battle, 33 to
2G. Remember a man named Mev
riman?
FREITAS TOO GOOD
1942—A tall, novice named Roy
Hammett had yet to attain peak

performance. Mortals like Jess |
Freitas, A 1 Beals, and A 1 Santucci '
won out in a closie for the Broncos, j
14 to 6.
1941 —Too much Frank Albert and
Buck Fawcett, the Shaughnessy
Tribe winning, 27 to 7.
1940 —A scare for the Shaughnes
sy legions: Stanford 7, Santa Clara
6. Pete Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor
were worth the one-point differ
ence.
The Indians, starting in 1930, au-

I thored five wins and a tie, thanks
' to a legendary group later to lie
I known as the "Vow Boys." Bobby
Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Monk
Moscrip, and Keith Topping! The
Cards could do no wrong.
TIIRKE IN HOW
The scene creeps further back
into faded remembrances, like the
year of 191G, when Charley Austin's
southern charges unraveled the
Cards, 2H to 5, in 70 minutes of rug
by football.
Number 29 in the series of Stan
ford-Santa Clara backyard rivalries
will be airborne for posterity to
morrow afternoon along a route
that has been paved with thrills
since lf>l4.
The men of Stanford —the Nev
erses, Corbuses, Alberts, Erbs,
Lawsons, and Crayons—are in the
shadow of eras past.
And the men of Jesuit learning—
the Falaschis, Bealses, Doughertys,
and Sehiechles — will populate the
sidelines turning over many a re
membrance of other Card - Bronco
battles.
BEGAN IN 1914
In the twilight portion of 1914 was
born the beginning of the Stanford-
Santa Clara rugby football relation
ships. The provincials turned back
the Broncos 13 to 0, but not without
a fight.
The Daily printed the following:
"Better than any of the scoring
plays was the lunge with which
Danny Carroll sent Voight to touch
in-goal after his 40-yard race to
ward the line, with Wallace, which
made the cipher on Santa Clara's
scoreboard nervous . . ."
