# 'Ivory Tower' Charge Made

"Our major failure as far as Eu
rope is concerned," International
Survey Committee Representative
Bill Fairer said, "is that American
students have failed to take an ac
tive part in the world's political
scene."
Speaking before an assembly of
students and faculty members last
night at the Cubberley Auditorium,
both ISC representatives Farrer and
Lawrence Grannis emphasized that
"We do not pretend to be experts
after our short analysis of the Eu
ropean scene."
"But just from our short trip,"
Grannis continued, "we were able
to note the need for material aid
to Europe by the United States and
the need for a more complete un
derstanding between Europeans and
Americans."
Grannis said the American story
is not being told in Europe as well
as it might be presented. Instead it
is the Communist viewpoint that is
gaining ground.
"If American student bodies were
to unite to help Europe rebuild,"
Farrer said, "we should support the
Marshall Plan, support the Srtatton
Bill to bring in displaced persons,
and support all State Department
activities."
As far as Stanford participation is
concerned, Farrer advised that the
Farm organize political support for
the needed bills. We should spon
sor an education project in Europe
similar to Harvard University's
Salzberg, Austria, project.
"In the third place," Farrer con
tinued, "Stanford should sponsor a
program to bring students to the
United States on a scholarship basis.
Every Farm living group could
sponsor at least one foreign stu
dent."
"Finally,"he said, "Stanford
should definitely promote more
Stanford Students to go to Europe
for study in foreign universities."
