### United Press 
Poor Jim Aiken and his Univer
| sity of Oregon Ducks!
They migrate south to tangle with
one of the most disgusted, most sur
! prised, most shucked, and most
fighting mad UCLA football teams
in the history of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Of all the guys who hate the Big
Nine, Coach Bert Laßrucherie of
the Bruins probably rates at the
I head of the class. And, inasmuch as
he hasn't been able to do much
about beating the Big Nine, the
chances are he'll be taking it out
on poor Oregon Saturday afternoon
in Los Angeles.
After taking that unceremonious
beating in the Rose Bowl on New
j Year's Day.the Bruins got oft to a
I good start this season by trimming

lowa—and things looked rosy.
Then along came Northwestern to
pull one of the surprises of the
year and annex a one-point victory
over the Bruins.
Blessed with a good line and
very fine backs, UCLA may well

turn out to be the toughest team in
the West again this year—at least
of Western earns.
On the other hand, Oregon is
anything but a shining light. Barely
able to squeeze past Montana State
in the opener, the Ducks lost to
Texas and Nevada on successive
Saturdays And thy'll probably drop
theii third in a row this weekend.
