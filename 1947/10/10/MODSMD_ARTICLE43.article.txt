# The 						Routine Behind The Daily
## 
### 
Each weekday morning 7,000 copies of The
Stanford Daily are regularly distributed around
the campus. Few of the readers know the
routine which makes this possible.
The basic work on an edition begins on the
morning preceding the day it is to appear.
The Managing Editor prepares an assignment
sheet which shows the stories that are to be
written for the edition and also lists the re
porters who will write the stories.
The actual work in The Daily Shack begins
at 3 in the afternoon. The "team" for that
edition begins to arrive and the assigned sto
ries start to pour in.
The night editor is the key man on the
"team." He plans the page makeup and de
cides which stories should receive top play.
His immediate assistant is the head copy
editor, who distributes the work of writing
heads, copyreading, and proofreading to a
group of copyreaders who are assigned work
ing hours by the staff editor.
At the same time that the night editor and
the head copy editor are organizing their desk,
two other groups are beginning to work. The
sports desk editor supervises a crew of sports
writers and copyreaders. He also makes up
the sports page "dummy."
The United Press editor is meanwhile receiv

ing copy over the wire service. This is copy
read by a group of UP desk workers.
All three desks are under the supervision of
the associate editor for the night.
By four in the afternoon, copy is sent to the
backshop for "setting up." A member of the
business staff rushes the ad "dummy" to the
night editor. The ad "dummy" shows the
locations of all the advertisements for the day.
Besides the assigned stories, special fea
tures are assembled by the feature editor.
Columns such as bull session and history, and
editorials, are routed to the back shop also.
Around 7 the night editor and the UP editor
confer. A decision is reached on what wire
service stories should be used.
By 8 most of the material has been written
and the copyreaders drift back to their dorms.
But the work of the night editor has just begun.
He now moves to the back shop where he su
pervises the actual making up of the pages.
About midnight the paper is "put to bed"
and the few remaining staff members leave the
Shack.
Early in the morning the circulation manager
and his assistants pick up the papers and dis
tribute them around the campus.
Later that morning preparations are started
for the next day's paperâ€”a new list of stories,
a new "team," but the same routine.
