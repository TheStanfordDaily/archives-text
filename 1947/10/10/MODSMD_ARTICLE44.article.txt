# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
Do you remember the drive-in waitress last year
who wrote an article in The Daily deploring the un
couth conduct of Stanfordites, male and female,
drunk and sober?
Believe me, not all catsup spilled in drive-ins is
done by the sons of the Red, and not all waitresses
are as perfecting.
I sneaked up on an El Camino joint the other day
called Louie's Lower Level (where the finks meet
for drinks).
To my left as I entered there was a guy eating
soup with his knife. I questioned him about the un
usual arrangement, and says he:
"My fork leaks."
So right oft' I knew it was a high classed place.
I sat down at the counter, and this sassy, gum
chewing redhead looks me over and says:
"Sumptun ta eat bud?"
"Yeah" says I, unabashed by her accent, "got
any sandwiches?"
"Shuah we got sandwiches," says she, deflecting
her bubble gum from incisor to bicuspid, "what
kind ya' want?"
"What kind ya' got", I retorts, not to be outdone
in this witty verbal battle.
"All kinds," she smirks, putting the repartee back
in my lap.

"Got any meat sandwiches," I says.
"Yeah bud, we got meat sandwiches," she says
making me drop into a 5-3-2-1 defense.
"What kind of meat sandwiches?" I ask weakly.
Says she: "We got ram. ham, spam, and lamb;
beef, buffalo, bear, and bull*."
Seeing she had scored a strike for the proletariat,
I changed the subject faster than a Burbank strip
teaser changes costume.
"Got any pie?"
"Shuah we got pie," she says blowing a bubble.
"What kind of pie?"
"All kinds," she says popping the bubble.
"Got any berry pie?"
"Yeah we got berry pie." Second bubble.
"What kind of berry pie ya' got," I says in a
desperation similar to guessing at true and false
questions.
Says she: "We got raz, daz, huckle, dew, blue,
goose, and straw." Strike two for the common
people.
"Well, you see that piece of raisin pie at the end
of the counter," I replied, "I'll take that."
"That ain't no raisin pie," says she gesturing
wildly in its direction. "Shoo fly! That's coconut."
Hit by a pitched ball, and next time I'll cat at
the Union.
