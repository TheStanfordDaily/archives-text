# HISTORY 1947
## 
### ALLEN BLETZ 
After my discourse on the United Nations Or
ganization was printed in Wednesday's paper, I
was beseiged with statements from Stanford "poli
ticians" that I was maliciously attempting to sabo
tage the UN with false propaganda. Actually, my
only criticism was that, for the present, the UN had
lost sight of its original function. However, I strong
ly feel that if the American people have a little
patience and lend their complete moral support to
the cause of this organization, the UN can succeed
in its work.
The United Nations organization was born in a
spirit of high aspiration and endeavor, but history
will record that it started as an association of allied
powers engaged in a desperate fight against a vicious
enemy. It is common knowledge that an interna
tional organization can function successfully only
if members are willing to surrender a degree of
their sovereignty. But it is also common knowledge
that a nation imperiled by military defeat will make
concessions, but when the danger passes jealous
nationalism will return.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OBSCURED
Major attention has been focused upon the failure
of the UN to achieve a feeling in the world that it is
not threatened by war, and the shadow of this fear
obscures other accomplishments—accomplishments
such as creating trusteeships, progress by the Econ
omic and Social Council in bettering international
health, economic, cultural, and social conditions.
Formal war is not being waged today, but in much
of Asia various types of conflict destroy life and
property as effectively as in 1944, and it is tragically
apparent that the Security Council is impotent to do
anything about it. The Security Council's list of
actions is a roster of failures—atomic control, UN
police force, disarmament, the Balkans, Indonesia,
Albania, Spain, and Trieste to mention a few of
their failures.
The United Nations developed in a fashion not

foreseen. The excessive use of the veto was not
contemplated. The UN charter provides that in the
Security Council, approval requires an affirmative
vote of seven of the eleven members, but the seven
must include all the five permanent members—the
United States, Great Britain, Russia, France, and
China; lacking anyone of these five, the measure is
defeated. The veto has been exercised 18 times
by Russia and twice by France.
COUNCIL HAS POWER
Material power is vested in the Security Council.
The General Assembly may discuss and recommend,
but the single vote in the Security Council serves to
nullify the action of the Assembly. Friends of the
United Nations expect that the mere weight of world
opinion will force recalcitrants to mend their ways.
But, certainly, it was not the weight of world opin
ion which crushed Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo.
As a national policy, Americans are attempting to
aid world peace. We plan to hold no areas of con
quest, except certain strategic atolls in the Pacific;
we have granted the Philippines independence; we
have reduced our military arm almost to impotence;
and we have adopted a policy of economic philan
thropy in the world. Surely, our sincerity must be
obvious.
Great Britain has fallen from her high estate
and she is withdrawing from India and plans with
drawal from Burma and Egypt. China and France
are, more or less, minor powers except for their
seats on the Security Council. Russia has annexed
274,000 square miles, and 24,000,000 people of her
conquests dominate a dozen states, and her armed
forces are kept near war level.
Perhaps, as I mentioned previously, we are im
patient. The UN has been given the power to achieve
peace, and it needs the moral support of this nation
to see it through this time of crisis. With patience,
all may work out well. But for the present, we can
only "sit tight" and hope that the UN can meet its
task successfully.

As a national policy, Americans are attempting to
aid world peace. We plan to hold no areas of con
quest, except certain strategic atolls in the Pacific;
we have granted the Philippines independence; we
have reduced our military arm almost to impotence;
and we have adopted a policy of economic philan
thropy in the world. Surely, our sincerity must be
obvious.
Great Britain has fallen from her high estate
and she is withdrawing from India and plans with
drawal from Burma and Egypt. China and France
are, more or less, minor powers except for their
seats on the Security Council. Russia has annexed
274,000 square miles, and 24,000,000 people of her
conquests dominate a dozen states, and her armed
forces are kept near war level.
Perhaps, as I mentioned previously, we are im
patient. The UN has been given the power to achieve
peace, and it needs the moral support of this nation
to see it through this time of crisis. With patience,
all may work out well. But for the present, we can
only "sit tight" and hope that the UN can meet its
task successfully.
After my discourse on the United Nations Or
ganization was printed in Wednesday's paper, I
was beseiged with statements from Stanford "poli
ticians" that I was maliciously attempting to sabo
tage the UN with false propaganda. Actually, my
only criticism was that, for the present, the UN had
lost sight of its original function. However, I strong
ly feel that if the American people have a little
patience and lend their complete moral support to
the cause of this organization, the UN can succeed
in its work.
The United Nations organization was born in a
spirit of high aspiration and endeavor, but history
will record that it started as an association of allied
powers engaged in a desperate fight against a vicious
enemy. It is common knowledge that an interna
tional organization can function successfully only
if members are willing to surrender a degree of
their sovereignty. But it is also common knowledge
that a nation imperiled by military defeat will make
concessions, but when the danger passes jealous
nationalism will return.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OBSCURED
Major attention has been focused upon the failure
of the UN to achieve a feeling in the world that it is
not threatened by war, and the shadow of this fear
obscures other accomplishments—accomplishments
such as creating trusteeships, progress by the Econ
omic and Social Council in bettering international
health, economic, cultural, and social conditions.
Formal war is not being waged today, but in much
of Asia various types of conflict destroy life and
property as effectively as in 1944, and it is tragically
apparent that the Security Council is impotent to do
anything about it. The Security Council's list of
actions is a roster of failures—atomic control, UN
police force, disarmament, the Balkans, Indonesia,
Albania, Spain, and Trieste to mention a few of
their failures.
The United Nations developed in a fashion not

foreseen. The excessive use of the veto was not
contemplated. The UN charter provides that in the
Security Council, approval requires an affirmative
vote of seven of the eleven members, but the seven
must include all the five permanent members—the
United States, Great Britain, Russia, France, and
China; lacking anyone of these five, the measure is
defeated. The veto has been exercised 18 times
by Russia and twice by France.
COUNCIL HAS POWER
Material power is vested in the Security Council.
The General Assembly may discuss and recommend,
but the single vote in the Security Council serves to
nullify the action of the Assembly. Friends of the
United Nations expect that the mere weight of world
opinion will force recalcitrants to mend their ways.
But, certainly, it was not the weight of world opin
ion which crushed Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo.
