# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
As members of the Class of '51, we wish to pro
test against the scheduled election for officers of the
Freshman Class and representatives to Excom. We
feel justified in this protest because we feel it is
impossible to select qualified leaders from 1200 class
mates after only a few weeks of acquaintanceship.
Since there were no representatives from the
Frosh Class on Excom when the schedule for the
election was drawn up, we feel that we have not had
a fair voice in the matter. This is our class and we
should have some say in how it is to be run.
Sponsors from Roblc and Encina were present
at Excom meeting and tried to tight this issue but

did not get anywhere in trying to stop the election.
The ASSU constitution provides that elections for
Freshman officers are to he held the sixth week of
fall quarter, but also provides that this election
may he held four weeks before or four weeks after
that date. Considering that the time previous to the
actual election is required for nominations and
primaries, it seems only logical that the actual
election should be scheduled as late in the quarter
as possible.
Showing that this protest meets with the approval
of the Freshman Class, we have collected the signa
tures of as many members as we could contact in
such a short time. (277 Frosh signatures)
