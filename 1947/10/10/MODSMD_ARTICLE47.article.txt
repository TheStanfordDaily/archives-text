### 
Debate advisers Kenneth W. Run
kel and David Grant opened the
Debating Club's first meeting last
Wednesday with the promise of a
good year.
"Stanford debaters have been in
vited to McGill University," de
clared coach Leland Chapin. All
debate members will be given a
chance to try out for the Quebec
trip.
Student debate manager John
Menzel and his assistants, Hudson
Bowlby, John Hines, Jim Lenhart,
Kenneth Cundy, Walter Landauer,
and Maty Kilbourne, promised a
program of competitive debates with
other universities. Also scheduled
for this year are hour discussions
every Wednesday night.
Lawrence Grannis and Ronald
Klein are scheduled to lead the de
baters in a discussion of world
problems at next Wednesday's
meeting in room 35 of the Educa
tion Building.
Dow Carpenter, who met Hawaii
in debate last year, presented both
the affirmative and negative sides of
"Resolved, that a federal world gov
ernment should be established" at
last Wednesday's meeting.
"The debaters must work even
more closely with the student body
this year," declared Chapin. It was
suggested that a discussion on stu
dent government be presented for
the student body.
"Stanford is noted for its high
level of debating," Chapin said. The
team fights not only to win, but to
pursue the truth. The Oxford Un
ion type of organization is used by
the debaters.
