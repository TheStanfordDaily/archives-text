Tonight is the night for all good
Injuns to really let go at the big
Santa Clara game rally, which begins
at 8 in the Pavilion, according to
Dave Heyler and Barbara Carter,
Rally Com co-chairmen.
A highly unusual program has
been planned, which will include
The Stanford Men's Glee Club, the
Stanford Band, and a surprise theme.
Freshmen and new students are
urged to become well versed in
Stanford songs and hymns for the
rally and game.
Song sheets will be distributed
before the game Saturday.
It will be necessary to wear a
white shirt, blouse, or sweater to the
game to be admitted into the rooting
section, asserts Miss Carter, and
men are urged to wear rooters' caps
and women to bring pom-poms.
Women with pom-poms will be seat
ed in the men's rooting section to
form a large Block "S," she added.
Pom-poms may be purchased at
the Rally Com office, second floor
of the Student Union, and rooters'
caps are on sale at the Roos Shack.
Fourteen card stunts, one depict
ing the mission at Santa Clara, will
he performed during the half time
period, according to Rally Com.
The following rules are to be ob
served by Indian rooters in regards
to the stunts:
1) Please co-operate with the
Rally Com on seating arrangements.
2) Cards, along with instruction
cards, will be tacked to the seats.
Sit directly over the cards and do
not move them until half time.
3) Line up quickly with bottom
row before half time period begins.
4) Many of the stunts will be
animated; for these remember your
row number. This number will be
found on the top of your instruction
card.
5) Notify a Rally Com member of
any vacant scats.
6) For the flip card stunts hold
the card for the present stunt in
one hand and place the card for the
next stunt on the back of this card
so it will be in a position to be
flipped into the next stunt.
7) At the end of the game pass
back the cards to the Rally Com
members in the aisle.
