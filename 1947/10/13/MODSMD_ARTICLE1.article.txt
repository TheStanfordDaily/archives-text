# Hunger Plagues Europeâ€”Grannis
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Ol six countries visited by Lawrence Grannis this summer
under the ISC program, only Switzerland stood ahead of all
other European nations in prosperity Only in that single coun
try did the people have near the proper diet required to main
tain minimum health standards.
"But in the rest of Europe," Grannis said Thursday night ;

in Cubberly Auditorium, "the
.still live amidst the wreckage of
World War 11. While the hunger
prevalent in all major cities is not
the spectacular type better known in
India and China, it is one of a creep
ing variety. II is a hunger extend
ing over a long period of time,"
Grannis said.
COM M UNI SIS ACTIV E
"Political developments in France
are becoming graver every day,"
Grannis continued. "Communist
threat of taking over France en
larges each day because the party
has not restricted its activity only
to talking. Political favors granted
to ordinary citizens by influential
communists holding office are gain
ing much good will for the party.
While the communists have taken
no stand on the Catholic church,
they have said that the people can
retain ownership of their homes ami
personal belongings. Not everyone
believes this.
Grannis pointed out that if the
communists do gain control of
France it will be because of Franco's
lack of understanding of the United
States and because of the commun
ists' efficient program in which they
seem to have an answer to every
problem.
MISCONCEPTIONS OF U.S.
French public has many miscon
ceptions of the United States. They
saw how well equipped our foot
soldiers were and from this sight
they have concluded that the low
est American workers are far
wealthier than most Frenchmen.
The French see American movies in
which the typical American family
has two or three servants, a sleek
car, and a dinner table sagging with
food.
Last spring's Greensboro lynch
ing of a negro and the lynchei's'
subsequent acquittal led Frenchmen
to believe that the United States is
at virtual civil war against the Ne
groes. The communist press has
helped germinate this idea.
"But the most serious misconcep
tion of all," Grannis summed, "is
the belief by all European countries
with the exception of England that
the U.S. will withdraw American
aid from Europe if serious economic
trouble arises in the United States.
"This all adds up to one conclu
sion: The American story is not be
ing told to Europe as it should be
presented.
ONE CHANCE KILLED
"Our one chance to present the
American view was cut short last
spring when Congress slashed the
throat of U.S. foreign policy by halv
ing funds for the State Department's
Information Bureau. At that time
the Bureau was needed the most."
Boiling down the problem in Eur
ope to two points, Grannis said,
"Problems on a national scale con
fronting the United States are Eur
ope's need for materials and the need
for an understanding between the
people of Europe with those in this
country.
A second of two articles concern
ing the ISC reports will appear to
morrow.

MISCONCEPTIONS OF U.S.
French public has many miscon
ceptions of the United States. They
saw how well equipped our foot
soldiers were and from this sight
they have concluded that the low
est American workers are far
wealthier than most Frenchmen.
The French see American movies in
which the typical American family
has two or three servants, a sleek
car, and a dinner table sagging with
food.
Last spring's Greensboro lynch
ing of a negro and the lynchei's'
subsequent acquittal led Frenchmen
to believe that the United States is
at virtual civil war against the Ne
groes. The communist press has
helped germinate this idea.
"But the most serious misconcep
tion of all," Grannis summed, "is
the belief by all European countries
with the exception of England that
the U.S. will withdraw American
aid from Europe if serious economic
trouble arises in the United States.
"This all adds up to one conclu
sion: The American story is not be
ing told to Europe as it should be
presented.
ONE CHANCE KILLED
"Our one chance to present the
American view was cut short last
spring when Congress slashed the
throat of U.S. foreign policy by halv
ing funds for the State Department's
Information Bureau. At that time
the Bureau was needed the most."
Boiling down the problem in Eur
ope to two points, Grannis said,
"Problems on a national scale con
fronting the United States are Eur
ope's need for materials and the need
for an understanding between the
people of Europe with those in this
country.
A second of two articles concern
ing the ISC reports will appear to
morrow.
Ol six countries visited by Lawrence Grannis this summer
under the ISC program, only Switzerland stood ahead of all
other European nations in prosperity Only in that single coun
try did the people have near the proper diet required to main
tain minimum health standards.
"But in the rest of Europe," Grannis said Thursday night ;

in Cubberly Auditorium, "the
.still live amidst the wreckage of
World War 11. While the hunger
prevalent in all major cities is not
the spectacular type better known in
India and China, it is one of a creep
ing variety. II is a hunger extend
ing over a long period of time,"
Grannis said.
COM M UNI SIS ACTIV E
"Political developments in France
are becoming graver every day,"
Grannis continued. "Communist
threat of taking over France en
larges each day because the party
has not restricted its activity only
to talking. Political favors granted
to ordinary citizens by influential
communists holding office are gain
ing much good will for the party.
While the communists have taken
no stand on the Catholic church,
they have said that the people can
retain ownership of their homes ami
personal belongings. Not everyone
believes this.
Grannis pointed out that if the
communists do gain control of
France it will be because of Franco's
lack of understanding of the United
States and because of the commun
ists' efficient program in which they
seem to have an answer to every
problem.
