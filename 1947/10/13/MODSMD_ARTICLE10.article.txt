# '51 Voting Is Delayed
## 
### 
Freshman election has been post
poned until the seventh week of this
quarter. At a special meeting Fri
day night Excom voted to delay
voting for the freshmen serving as
Excom representatives and class of
ficers after a large portion of the
frosh criticized the earlier date.
Election Board Chairman Gordon
Ness said all freshman nominations
handed in are void. "Only nomina
tions returned by students running
for Excom from off-campus District
1 remain valid," Ness said.
While dates for freshman nomina
tions and election will be decided at
the next Excom meeting, Wednes
day night, dates for the District 1
election remain the same. If Dis
trict 1 nominations exceed four,
voting on Oct. 22 will serve as a
primary. The final election will then
follow on Oct. 29, Ness added.
Students from District 1 may
qualify for the Excom post if they
have at least a "C" average and live
off campus. Nomination blanks,
available on the Engineering corner,
must bear 15 signatures and be re
turned to the box on the same cor
ner.
While each candidate is limited to
$10 for campaign expenses, he must
file his "expected" costs within 48
hours after nomination, on a blank
printed in Thursday's Daily.
Nominations for off-campus (Dis
trict 1) are open and will remain
open until 5 p.m. tomorrow.
