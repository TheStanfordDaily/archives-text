# Davies Clarifies Farm Football 'Yell' Policy
## 
### ELEANOR LAWRENCE 
"The aim of the yell leaders at Stanford this year has been
and will continue to be to carry out those policies which best
represent the wishes of the entire student body," Head Yell
Leader Jack Davies declared yesterday in clarification of root
ing section proceedings.
Emphasizing that nothing had been done with "snap judg-

ment" and that policy formulation
had been initiated during the sum
mer by weeks of consultation, Davies
reviewed the discontinuation of yells
for substitute players.
BASIC POLICY
Basic purpose of the new policy
is to raise yelling from a casual
noise to the point wherein every
yell, every rooter really counts. For
this reason, substitution yells lose
their value when it is realized that
substitutions came largely from the
backfield and largely among the
same persons in the backfield. By
this same token, linesmen, who may
play the major part of a game, would
not receive their fair share of cheer
ing.
Disgruntled rooters should also
become aware that under the new
substitution rule, the coach may ex
change players at will. Unless each
yell is therefore made an important
thing, yelling will be going on all
the time, Davies said.
SPONTANEOUS YELLS
"In regard to injured players, I.
believed that the most spontaneous
and sincere display of appreciation
possible occurs when, as followed
John Clark's injury, the entire mol -
ing section stood and upplaudei? in
rising ovation."
This would be a genuine demon -
stration of the student body's feel
ings toward an injured player. In
view of the fact that the student
body prefei's a yell, we will natural
ly in the future call for a yell in
such cases.
"We have attempted to introduce
new ideas into the rooting sections
the method of delivery of certain
yells has been changed; women now
assist in leading; and we are plan
ning more new yells arnd an addi
tional song yet this season. As a
step to insure a minimum of errors
and closer co-ordination between
the band and Rally Com, a full-time
spotter will be placed by the micro
phone to call players."
ATTEMPT TO SATISFY
"At the Santa Clara game, when
the public address system did not
work satisfactorily, we were aware
of it and four times attempted to
have it corrected. At such times, 1
can say we have had the fullest sup
port of Rally Com in trying to
make the Stanford rooting section
this year stand out for spirit and
ingenuity."
"Being human, we make mis
takes. Our decisions will be directed
to satisfy our rooting section. To
those who feel strongly about the
matter and in line with our desire
for student body support, we will
make every effort to satisfy them and
the student body in the job they
want done."

rising ovation."
This would be a genuine demon -
stration of the student body's feel
ings toward an injured player. In
view of the fact that the student
body prefei's a yell, we will natural
ly in the future call for a yell in
such cases.
"We have attempted to introduce
new ideas into the rooting sections
the method of delivery of certain
yells has been changed; women now
assist in leading; and we are plan
ning more new yells arnd an addi
tional song yet this season. As a
step to insure a minimum of errors
and closer co-ordination between
the band and Rally Com, a full-time
spotter will be placed by the micro
phone to call players."
ATTEMPT TO SATISFY
"At the Santa Clara game, when
the public address system did not
work satisfactorily, we were aware
of it and four times attempted to
have it corrected. At such times, 1
can say we have had the fullest sup
port of Rally Com in trying to
make the Stanford rooting section
this year stand out for spirit and
ingenuity."
"Being human, we make mis
takes. Our decisions will be directed
to satisfy our rooting section. To
those who feel strongly about the
matter and in line with our desire
for student body support, we will
make every effort to satisfy them and
the student body in the job they
want done."
"The aim of the yell leaders at Stanford this year has been
and will continue to be to carry out those policies which best
represent the wishes of the entire student body," Head Yell
Leader Jack Davies declared yesterday in clarification of root
ing section proceedings.
Emphasizing that nothing had been done with "snap judg-

ment" and that policy formulation
had been initiated during the sum
mer by weeks of consultation, Davies
reviewed the discontinuation of yells
for substitute players.
BASIC POLICY
Basic purpose of the new policy
is to raise yelling from a casual
noise to the point wherein every
yell, every rooter really counts. For
this reason, substitution yells lose
their value when it is realized that
substitutions came largely from the
backfield and largely among the
same persons in the backfield. By
this same token, linesmen, who may
play the major part of a game, would
not receive their fair share of cheer
ing.
Disgruntled rooters should also
become aware that under the new
substitution rule, the coach may ex
change players at will. Unless each
yell is therefore made an important
thing, yelling will be going on all
the time, Davies said.
SPONTANEOUS YELLS
"In regard to injured players, I.
believed that the most spontaneous
and sincere display of appreciation
possible occurs when, as followed
John Clark's injury, the entire mol -
ing section stood and upplaudei? in
rising ovation."
This would be a genuine demon -
stration of the student body's feel
ings toward an injured player. In

body prefei's a yell, we will natural
