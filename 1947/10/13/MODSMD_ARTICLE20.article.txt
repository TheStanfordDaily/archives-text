# Villagers All Have Bunks— just Barely

### OR APPERSON 
A chapter in Stanford Village's
1 book of books—the saga of a grow
! ing populace—was thrust into the
hands of the Village publishers this
i week with a Standing Room Only
sign pinned to the frontispiece.
The Village, they have begun to
shout, "is full to capacity." And
with an eye to the statistics, it seems
that they are right. In June of 1947
there were 950 single men residents.
By August some 1,000 applications
had been received, and on Sept. 25,
1,800 deposits were on hand at the
counselor's office.
Despite 200 rejections, 1,500 hope
fuls turned up, trying to crowd into
accommodations set up for 1,400.
These accommodations included tar
paper shacks with lockers and beds
installed. So the extra 130 men
wouldn't have to sleep in the bath
tubs, if there were any, beds and
lockers were hurriedly placed on
I the screened-in sleeping porches.
By the end of the first week 91 men
were still there.
PLUS TWENTY-TWO
After 50 men checked out and 72
men moved into the dayroom
porches at the ends of several build
ings, the situation began to clear up.
The administration even plans to
close one of the tarpaper shacks.
Complete population figures —
proving that the Village has as large
a population as some towns—are not
available, but as near as can be es
timated there are 1,430 single men,
110 single women, 300 families in
apartments, 50 married couples in
rooms, and between 15 and 20 fac
ulty families living at the Village.
Modern improvements now deco
rate the Village since the installa
tion of a grocery store and meat
market, and the opening of several
new parking areas. Some of the
men's houses are getting Bendix
washers.
DRAW ONE
A lottery at the end of spring
quarter placed most of the return
ing Villagers where they are now,
and the new students were assigned
to their rooms. Each student living
at the Village has had a personal
interview about his assignment and
can, at any time, get further infor
mation. It is a Village policy to
give as much personal attention as
posisble to each Villager.
Although the crowding in the Vil
lage has made studying difficult and
sometimes impossible, the students
themselves are taking over the
problm and some have already es
tablished quiet hours.
The Village is known to be the
best emergency housing project in
the nation, and it has been the work
of those in the administration office
that has made it so.

timated there are 1,430 single men,
110 single women, 300 families in
apartments, 50 married couples in
rooms, and between 15 and 20 fac
ulty families living at the Village.
Modern improvements now deco
rate the Village since the installa
tion of a grocery store and meat
market, and the opening of several
new parking areas. Some of the
men's houses are getting Bendix
washers.
DRAW ONE
A lottery at the end of spring
quarter placed most of the return
ing Villagers where they are now,
and the new students were assigned
to their rooms. Each student living
at the Village has had a personal
interview about his assignment and
can, at any time, get further infor
mation. It is a Village policy to
give as much personal attention as
posisble to each Villager.
Although the crowding in the Vil
lage has made studying difficult and
sometimes impossible, the students
themselves are taking over the
problm and some have already es
tablished quiet hours.
The Village is known to be the
best emergency housing project in
the nation, and it has been the work
of those in the administration office
that has made it so.
A chapter in Stanford Village's
1 book of books—the saga of a grow
! ing populace—was thrust into the
hands of the Village publishers this
i week with a Standing Room Only
sign pinned to the frontispiece.
The Village, they have begun to
shout, "is full to capacity." And
with an eye to the statistics, it seems
that they are right. In June of 1947
there were 950 single men residents.
By August some 1,000 applications
had been received, and on Sept. 25,
1,800 deposits were on hand at the
counselor's office.
Despite 200 rejections, 1,500 hope
fuls turned up, trying to crowd into
accommodations set up for 1,400.
These accommodations included tar
paper shacks with lockers and beds
installed. So the extra 130 men
wouldn't have to sleep in the bath
tubs, if there were any, beds and
lockers were hurriedly placed on
I the screened-in sleeping porches.
By the end of the first week 91 men
were still there.
PLUS TWENTY-TWO
After 50 men checked out and 72
men moved into the dayroom
porches at the ends of several build
ings, the situation began to clear up.
The administration even plans to
close one of the tarpaper shacks.
Complete population figures —
proving that the Village has as large
a population as some towns—are not
available, but as near as can be es
timated there are 1,430 single men,
110 single women, 300 families in
apartments, 50 married couples in
