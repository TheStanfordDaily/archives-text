A bunch of the boys were whoop
ing it up
At the Longbarn, south of Paly
When out of the night and into the
glare
Stepped a gal called Stanford
Sally.
Now, this Roble miss was a sight
to see.
And the boys stopped all their
laughter.
They tried to pitch but to no avail;
'twas a Longbarn steak she was
after!
