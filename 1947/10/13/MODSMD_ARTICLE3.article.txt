# Dr. Staub On Farm

Dr. Hans Staub of the Stanford
Physics Department has recently
returned from a trip to Switzerland
and England. The primary purpose
of the trip was to visit his parents
in Zurich, but he also visited the
Federal Institute of Technology and
the University of Basle in Switzer
land, where he observed experi
ments in nuclear physics.
After leaving Switzerland, Dr.
Staub attended a conference on nu
clear physics at the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment at Harwell,
England. In a talk delivered at the
Journal Club of the Physics Club
last Thursday, Dr. Staub told of the
experiments he had observed in
Switzerland and of those reported
at the conference in England.
At Harwell Dr. Staub reported on
the work he and Dr. Nicodemus
have been doing with the Stanford
cyclotron on the polarization, mag
netic moment, and angular velocity
of neutrons.
While he was at Harwell, a
"GLEEP," or "Graphite Low En
ergy Experimental Pile," was
brought up to a power of 100 kilo
watts. This is a comparatively low
power level compared to the piles
now being operated in the United
States for the production of pluto
nium.
Dr. Staub returned to Stanford on
September 27. He has been with
the Physics Department since 1938,
except for a period from 1943 to
1946 which he spent at the Los Ala
mos atomic bomb project.
