# Ex-Cardinals Making Names For Selves on Pro Gridirons
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Cardinal football followers can
well be proud of two members of
last year's varsity eleven who are
currently making themselves out
standing as rookies in the ranks of
professional football.
Bill Hachten and Fred Boensch,
both starting linemen on Coach
Marchie Schwartz's '46 squad, are
now making their blocks and tackles
for the New York Giants and the
Washington Redskins respectively.
Hachten, who was nominated to
the All-Coast team at guard last
year, has elevated himself into a
starting position in the Giants' pow
erful forward wall. Coming into his
own during the Giants' victory over
the Eastern College All-Stars, Big
Bill has been a permanent fixture
ever since.
BOENSCH A SKIN
Playing for the rival Washington
Redskins, Boensch has been throw
ing his massive 240 pounds irfco ac
tion at the'tackle spot. Boen. ;h was
quite a rookie sensation at the Skins'
summer training camp. Largest In
dian regular last year, Fred should
help fill the hole in the Redskins'
front line.
While at Stanford, Boensch and
Hachten were the fastest men in
their respective positions, although
both weighed over 210 pounds.
These two additions to the play
for-pay boys league brings to nine
the number of Stanfordites now
playing pro ball. Two other ex-In
dians are coaching in the after grad
uation ranks.
49'ers HAVE STARS
All American quarterback Frank
Albert is directing the attack for the
San Francisco 49'ers. All-Coast end
Hank Norberg, guard Bruno Ban
ducci, and plunging fullback Norm
Standlee are also on the Bay squad.
Albert, Bunducci, and Standlee were
all starters in the memorable 1941
Rose Bowl game, in which Stanford
clipped Nebraska 21-13.
The two halfbacks of the '40 won
der backfield, Automatic Pete Kme
tovic and Hugh Gallarneau, are dig

ging their cleats into the fields of
the National Professional Football
league. Pete is with the Detroit
Lions, while Hugh is performing for
the World Champion Chicago Bears.
POOL HELPS ROCKETS
Vic Lindskog, All-Coast center in
1940, is in the pivot spot for the
Philadelphia Eagles.
Veteran end Hampton Pool, after
many years competition in both
leagues, is now tutoring the ends for
the Chicago Rockets. Pool was a
team mate of Chuck Taylor, now
Stanford freshman coach, when both
played for the Miami Seahawks last
year.
Dud De Groot, who was Allâ€”
American center at Stanford many
years ago, is head coach of the Los
Angeles Dons. Dud's son, Dud De
Groot Jr., is a halfback on this year's
Stanford varsity.


BILL HACHTEN, stellar guard
on the 194(i Stanford grid squad
and all-Coast selection, is playing
with the New York Giants of the
National League this season.
Machlen, lured East by play-for
nioney offers, has lefl a space in
the Cardinal line which has yet
to he filled.
