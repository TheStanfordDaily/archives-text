## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 12 (UP).
—The renaissance of Pacific Coast
football was complete today and the
major teams of the West settled
down to the business of conference
competition, now that they had
proved themselves in intersection
a Is.
With California and USC leading
the way, the PCC teams had emer
the way, the PCC teams had
emerged from their 1946 year of

lethargy and the belief now is gen
eral that the West can hold its own
with any teams in the country.
| WEST COAST BETTER
Compared with 1946, when East,
Mid-West, South, and Southwest
teams shellacked the Westerners
with monotonous regularity, an
even break can at least be consid
ered a moral victory for the fans
out this way who at one time con
sidered their football far and away
the best in the world.
The stamp of approval, of course,
I came Saturday when undefeated
J and untied California drenched
Wisconsin of the Big Nine. 48-7; and
University of Southern California
! blanked Ohio State, 32-0.
CONFERENCES EVEN
That was the clincher and gave
the PCC a record for the year of
; three wins and three losses aaginst
i the Big Nine. From now on it's
i mostly conference play until that
i all-important New Year's Day Rose
Bowl engagement pitting the win
ners of the two conferences against
| each other in the big pay-off battle.
California's first conference tilt is
against Washington State, and the
Boars get their closest thing to a
breather this year. USC, which has
a tie with Rice to mar its record,
i gets the acid test against the loop
leading Oregon State club, which
1 humbled Idaho, 33-6, yesterday.
