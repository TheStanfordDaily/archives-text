# Red Machine Still Clogged As Santa Clara Hands Farm Third Straight Defeat, 13 to 7
## 
### JACK CASHEL BOB CATUDIO 
Four hard-charging ends led by Captain Cy Smith, a bevy of
plunging Bronco backs, and a marked defensive weakness in
the middle of the Stanford line, all added up to the Indians'
third consecutive '47 defeat as Santa Clara won the 25th game
of the" intra-valley series, 13 to 7, last Saturday afternoon.

As a bit of solace, it can be pointed
out that the lengthy Stanford injury
list undoubtedly left big holes
and helped dull Coach Marchie
Schwartz's offensive thrusts. Half
backs Mickey Titus and George
Quist, and quarterback Ainslee Bell
did not get into play during the
afternoon.
The Indians rolled up but 82 yards
rushing and passing during the game,
and for a while it looked as if they
would draw a complete blank on the
scoreboard.
CARDS SCORE ON BREAK
And they very conceivably could
have been were it not for a break
which occurred midway in the fourth
quarter.
Santa Clara had just finished stop
ping a short Indian drive and took
over with a first and ten on its own
sixteen. An offside penalty and a
four yard loss pushed the Broncs
back to their own seven.
On the next play a backfield mix
up between quarterback Stubby
Crowley and half Vern Hare caused
Crowley to fumble, and Stanford
tackle Sid Smith recovered for the
touchdown. Dan Mervin converted,
giving the Indians their seventh
point.
Except for one other point in the
game, when the Cardinal line rose
en mass to hold the Broncs after they

left tackle for the touchdown.
Chavez missed the extra point.
Even though the Broncos out
gained the Indians nearly three to
one, Santa Clara showed no continu
ous power for any long drives. But
when they needed it, fullback Bill
Prentice, who averaged five yards
per try in 17 carries, and the other
Bronc backs had little trouble pick
ing up yardage.
LONG ROAD AHEAD
Experience may be what the
Cards, especially the line, needs
most. But from here on in the road
is long and rough.
The Indians meet UCLA, Wash
ington, Oregon State, USC, Oregon,
and California on successive Satur
days. And each of these teams is
much stronger, at least on paper,
than Santa Clara.

had gained a first down on the Stan
ford four yard line, Indian rooters
had little to cheer about.
BRONCS' SCORING
Santa Clara's scoring went like
this:
Early in the second quarter, Stan
ford's Mike Durkett attempted to
kick out from his own end zone.
Rushed heavily by Captain Smith,
Durkett fumbled a low pass from
center, Hennessy recovering for the
Broncs on the Indian one foot line.
Bill Prentice plunged over guard for
the score. Moses Chavez success
fully converted.
Ten minutes later. Santa Clara
center Bill Renna intercepted A 1
Morris' pass on the Stanford 43, and
raced all the way to the two before
being tackled by Pete August. Two
plays later Vern Hare went through

Deep-rooted gloom waltzed uninvited into the Stanford
dressing zoom for the third straight time Saturday and the Cards,
to a man, "are none too happy about the situation."
"An inexperienced line," Marchie Schwartz said unwaver
ingly, "hurt us a bit. Sure, Santa Clara played a heads-up game.

Their line was outcharging us, and
they were on their toes all the way." |
Marchie was on edge to say the
least. He talked slow and his mien
became one of a boy provincial
tutor aging fast.
"Not that I'm offering any alibis,"
he continued, "but injuries have hurt
us considerably."
STERLING STARS
The line play of guard Vern Ster
ling of the Broncos was cited by
Schwartz in nothing short of a forth
right mortal eulogy.
The man was nothing short of ter
rific on defense, slashing through the
Card line time and time again in
rushing the passer.
"Sterling was most outstanding,"
Marchie said, "and there were those
ends, Smith, Hennessey, and Keck,
and Bill Renna, the center. Bill
Prentice, of course, was another
good boy."
For the men of the Farm, Dan
Mervin, former Santa Rosa Junior
College end, was given a verbal sal
vo for both his defensive and offens
ive play.
"Our game with Michigan last
week had nothing to do with the
way we played against Santa Clara,"
Marchie said. He even went so far
I as to disprove the theory that the
j "unworkable timer on the score-
I board" had an effect on the quar
terback's sense of game timing.
During the summer months,

Schwartz had issued the following
sympathy-tinged statement: "I'll
make no bones about Stanford hav
ing a 'line,' because we just haven't
one."
Players trudged into the locker
room in twos and in threes, helmets
were tossed against the wall al
legedly "to let off steam." Even the
sound of "Come Join the Band" be
ing played outside the dressing room
had more of a death knell tone than
anything else.
"It was a tough one to lose,"
Marchie declared.
And with that terse remark, the
gloom swallowed every portion of
the room, for the men of Stanford
next week face the task of arrest
ing the march of UCLA's Bruins.

ATHERTON "DUTCH"' PIILE
GER, towering 215-pound Indian
tackle, is carrying a full share of
line duties this season.
Four hard-charging ends led by Captain Cy Smith, a bevy of
plunging Bronco backs, and a marked defensive weakness in
the middle of the Stanford line, all added up to the Indians'
third consecutive '47 defeat as Santa Clara won the 25th game
of the" intra-valley series, 13 to 7, last Saturday afternoon.

As a bit of solace, it can be pointed
out that the lengthy Stanford injury
list undoubtedly left big holes
and helped dull Coach Marchie
Schwartz's offensive thrusts. Half
backs Mickey Titus and George
Quist, and quarterback Ainslee Bell
did not get into play during the
afternoon.
The Indians rolled up but 82 yards
rushing and passing during the game,
and for a while it looked as if they
would draw a complete blank on the
scoreboard.
CARDS SCORE ON BREAK
And they very conceivably could
have been were it not for a break
which occurred midway in the fourth
quarter.
Santa Clara had just finished stop
ping a short Indian drive and took
over with a first and ten on its own
sixteen. An offside penalty and a
four yard loss pushed the Broncs
back to their own seven.
On the next play a backfield mix
up between quarterback Stubby
Crowley and half Vern Hare caused
Crowley to fumble, and Stanford
tackle Sid Smith recovered for the
touchdown. Dan Mervin converted,
giving the Indians their seventh
point.
Except for one other point in the
game, when the Cardinal line rose
en mass to hold the Broncs after they

left tackle for the touchdown.
Chavez missed the extra point.
Even though the Broncos out
gained the Indians nearly three to
one, Santa Clara showed no continu
ous power for any long drives. But
when they needed it, fullback Bill
Prentice, who averaged five yards
per try in 17 carries, and the other
Bronc backs had little trouble pick
ing up yardage.
LONG ROAD AHEAD
Experience may be what the
Cards, especially the line, needs
most. But from here on in the road
is long and rough.
The Indians meet UCLA, Wash
ington, Oregon State, USC, Oregon,
and California on successive Satur
days. And each of these teams is
much stronger, at least on paper,
than Santa Clara.

Santa Clara's scoring went like
this:
Early in the second quarter, Stan

kick out from his own end zone.
Rushed heavily by Captain Smith,
Durkett fumbled a low pass from
center, Hennessy recovering for the
Broncs on the Indian one foot line.
Bill Prentice plunged over guard for
the score. Moses Chavez success
fully converted.
Ten minutes later. Santa Clara
center Bill Renna intercepted A 1
Morris' pass on the Stanford 43, and
raced all the way to the two before
being tackled by Pete August. Two
plays later Vern Hare went through

Deep-rooted gloom waltzed uninvited into the Stanford
dressing zoom for the third straight time Saturday and the Cards,
to a man, "are none too happy about the situation."
"An inexperienced line," Marchie Schwartz said unwaver
ingly, "hurt us a bit. Sure, Santa Clara played a heads-up game.

Their line was outcharging us, and
they were on their toes all the way." |
Marchie was on edge to say the
least. He talked slow and his mien
became one of a boy provincial
tutor aging fast.
"Not that I'm offering any alibis,"
he continued, "but injuries have hurt
us considerably."
STERLING STARS
The line play of guard Vern Ster
ling of the Broncos was cited by
Schwartz in nothing short of a forth
right mortal eulogy.
The man was nothing short of ter
rific on defense, slashing through the
Card line time and time again in
rushing the passer.
"Sterling was most outstanding,"
Marchie said, "and there were those
ends, Smith, Hennessey, and Keck,
and Bill Renna, the center. Bill
Prentice, of course, was another
good boy."
For the men of the Farm, Dan
Mervin, former Santa Rosa Junior

Marchie was on edge to say the
least. He talked slow and his mien

he continued, "but injuries have hurt

STERLING STARS
The line play of guard Vern Ster
ling of the Broncos was cited by
Schwartz in nothing short of a forth
right mortal eulogy.
The man was nothing short of ter
rific on defense, slashing through the
Card line time and time again in
rushing the passer.
"Sterling was most outstanding,"
Marchie said, "and there were those
ends, Smith, Hennessey, and Keck,
and Bill Renna, the center. Bill
Prentice, of course, was another
good boy."
For the men of the Farm, Dan
Mervin, former Santa Rosa Junior
College end, was given a verbal sal
vo for both his defensive and offens
ive play.
"Our game with Michigan last
week had nothing to do with the
way we played against Santa Clara,"
Marchie said. He even went so far
I as to disprove the theory that the
j "unworkable timer on the score-
I board" had an effect on the quar
terback's sense of game timing.
During the summer months,

Schwartz had issued the following
sympathy-tinged statement: "I'll
make no bones about Stanford hav
ing a 'line,' because we just haven't
one."
Players trudged into the locker
room in twos and in threes, helmets
were tossed against the wall al
legedly "to let off steam." Even the
sound of "Come Join the Band" be
ing played outside the dressing room
had more of a death knell tone than
anything else.
"It was a tough one to lose,"
Marchie declared.
And with that terse remark, the
gloom swallowed every portion of
the room, for the men of Stanford
next week face the task of arrest
ing the march of UCLA's Bruins.


ATHERTON "DUTCH"' PIILE
GER, towering 215-pound Indian
tackle, is carrying a full share of
line duties this season.
Four hard-charging ends led by Captain Cy Smith, a bevy of
plunging Bronco backs, and a marked defensive weakness in
the middle of the Stanford line, all added up to the Indians'
third consecutive '47 defeat as Santa Clara won the 25th game
of the" intra-valley series, 13 to 7, last Saturday afternoon.

As a bit of solace, it can be pointed
out that the lengthy Stanford injury
list undoubtedly left big holes
and helped dull Coach Marchie
Schwartz's offensive thrusts. Half
backs Mickey Titus and George
Quist, and quarterback Ainslee Bell
did not get into play during the
afternoon.
The Indians rolled up but 82 yards
rushing and passing during the game,
and for a while it looked as if they
would draw a complete blank on the
scoreboard.
CARDS SCORE ON BREAK
And they very conceivably could
have been were it not for a break
which occurred midway in the fourth
quarter.
Santa Clara had just finished stop
ping a short Indian drive and took
over with a first and ten on its own
sixteen. An offside penalty and a
four yard loss pushed the Broncs
back to their own seven.
On the next play a backfield mix
up between quarterback Stubby
Crowley and half Vern Hare caused
Crowley to fumble, and Stanford
tackle Sid Smith recovered for the
touchdown. Dan Mervin converted,
giving the Indians their seventh
point.
Except for one other point in the
game, when the Cardinal line rose
en mass to hold the Broncs after they

left tackle for the touchdown.
Chavez missed the extra point.
Even though the Broncos out
gained the Indians nearly three to
one, Santa Clara showed no continu
ous power for any long drives. But
when they needed it, fullback Bill
Prentice, who averaged five yards
per try in 17 carries, and the other
Bronc backs had little trouble pick
ing up yardage.
LONG ROAD AHEAD
Experience may be what the
Cards, especially the line, needs
most. But from here on in the road
is long and rough.
The Indians meet UCLA, Wash
ington, Oregon State, USC, Oregon,
and California on successive Satur
days. And each of these teams is
much stronger, at least on paper,
than Santa Clara.

BRONCS' SCORING
Santa Clara's scoring went like
this:
Early in the second quarter, Stan
ford's Mike Durkett attempted to
kick out from his own end zone.
Rushed heavily by Captain Smith,
Durkett fumbled a low pass from
center, Hennessy recovering for the
Broncs on the Indian one foot line.
Bill Prentice plunged over guard for
the score. Moses Chavez success
fully converted.
Ten minutes later. Santa Clara
center Bill Renna intercepted A 1
Morris' pass on the Stanford 43, and
raced all the way to the two before
being tackled by Pete August. Two
plays later Vern Hare went through
