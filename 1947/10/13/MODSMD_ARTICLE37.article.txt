The "mistake -of - the - week -
award" in The Daily went to sports
writer George "Spook" Newell
who very carefully labeled Marty
Feldman's picture, "Marty Ander
son" in Friday's paper. When last
seen, Newell was heading in the
general direction of Siberia with
Marty A. in hot pursuit. Before
he left Newell desperately claimed
"eye-trouble."
How near sighted can you get?
