# Let's Not Lose in the Stands
## 
### 
The Stanford rooting section made itself
conspicuous Saturday, but not for its sports
manship, consideration, and cooperation.
Farm rooters have always been quick to
criticize bad sportsmanship in other schools.
Saturday's rooting section did not live up to
the Stanford tradition of "good sportsmanship
even when losing."
Dual blame must be attached to the con
fusion which occurred during the card stunts.
Instructions to the rooters should have been
more explicit. The public address system was
not adequate. Rally Committee, in a special
meeting yesterday, made plans to correct
these mistakes for the UCLA game next Sat
urday.
The lack of cooperation and rudeness with
which some of the rooters treated the request
to save the stunt cards almost made it im
possible to have card stunts at the Big Game.
More cards cannot be ordered this year.
Rally Committee is attempting to iron out
the problems apparent Saturday. Because of

student criticism, the center rooting section
for this week's game will not include the pom
pom block S. All women rooters will be seat
ed at the side of this section. The ushering
system will be improved. After these changes
are made, the success or failure of the rooting
section to make a good showing is up to the
students.
Head yell leader Jack Davies has made an
appeal to Stanford rooters on page one of to
day's Daily. Spirit in a rooting section cannot
be forced, but courtesy is expected.
There are few Stanford traditions as evi
dent to people not connected with the Uni
versity as that of good sportsmanship. What
the rooting section does at a football game is
seen by a large crowd. Rooters reflect the
attitude of a school.
This tradition of courtesy and loyalty is
worth keeping. Let's show that, winning or
losing, we can mke the Farm rooting section
conspicuous for its spirit and good manners.
