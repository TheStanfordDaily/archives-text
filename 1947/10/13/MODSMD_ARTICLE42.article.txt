### WAYNE SARGENT 
Got an inspiration for a great national anthem
yesterday. Came to me right between International
Organizations 147, and Music appreciation 1.
I jumped on my two wheel Cadillac and raced out
Palm Drive, buzzed down University, over on Mid
dlefield, up on Addison, left on Regalia, back on
Regalia, back down Addison (I missed my turn),
over on Johnson to a friend's who owns a piano.
Stopping only to put a padlock through the
spokes, I rushed in the door and hollered:
"Penelope—l've got it —I'm ready—l've been
inspired."
Penelope squealed slightly, grabbed a bathrobe
and retired behind a door.
"Let's not play games now," I admonished, "Where
did you hide the piano?"
"In the basement," she said disappointedly.
"My national anthem'can't wait. Thousands of
marching feet may be out of step because they have
no music to march to," I said counting cadence the
last few steps to the piano.
"Can you play in the key of A flat?" asked
Penelope.
"Baby, I can play in any flat if I have the right
key," I quipped, striking a diminished seventh.

"Francis Scott Key-rist but that theme has power.
What an anthem," I said playing it over. "Pader
ewski and I have something in common."
"Yes," remarked Penelope, "you both have two
hands. As a matter of fact you have a two finger ad
vantage—Paderewski only has five on each hand."
"Enough of your banal remarks," I snorted. "You
have no feeling, no imagination. Doesn't this give
you a feeling of power? Think of the Canadian
Royal Mounted Police, think of marching armies,
think of the Michigan football team."
"Sounds like Korsakoff rolling over the keys on
his Rimskis," she said strumming the upper register
with her toes.
"Get off the piano and put some shoes on," I de
manded.
"All right for you," she said playfully throwing a
lump of coal at my head.
Ah, 'twas ever thus. Talent must always face
obstacles, art must always be harassed. That's what
keeps nudging genius over the thin line into insanity.
I wonder if I'll ever get it written —an anthem you
can sing without climbing a ladder for the high notes.
Oh well, maybe one of the fraternities needs a drink
ing song.
