### BIPAN CHANDRA 
So much has been said in the American press
about the use and abuse of veto that people have
nearly forgotten what it stands for. The Principle
of Unanimity which was later shortened to "veto"
was introduced in the United Nations Organization
by the Big Five in recognition of the fact that under
the existing political division and organization of
the world, it is impossible to enforce any provisions
or regulations unless the Big Five are agreed,
ethics of this principle may be questioned; but, as
the world stands today, nearly every country is
agreed to the reality that a worid divided by different
standards of economic, political, and social good, can
not be treated as a homogeneous unit. World at pres
ent is united only by the desire of the people of the
world to have an enduring peace.
The importance and necessity of this Principle of
Unanimity in the U.N. is demonstrated by the fact
that such divergent countries as the United States,
Britain, Russia, France, and China advocated it at
San Francisco and all other nations of the world
agreed to it. Even now, in spite of the Indo-Ameri
can denunciations of the use of this principle by
Russia, none of the major countries has come out
against it. U.S. state department and U.S. news
papers have objected to the Russian vetoes because
U.S. didn't like to be vetoed on those particular
issues. So far not a single official word has come out
of U.S. foreign office against the veto itself. Per
haps they realize that they might have to use veto
sometimes in the future.
Russia has been very much criticised for its
more than twenty vetoes. It has been said that when
the world agreed to the veto principle, it had no idea
that veto would be used so many times. May I re
mind these people that at San Francisco the world
had also no idea how soon the talk of fighting com
munism will start in this country. Nor did the
world know that the power alinements, like the
Arab block, or the Russian block or the American
block, will take place too soon. At present, the block
of 20 South American nations can block any move in
the U.N. How can any major country let its fate be
decided by a group of small nations—most of whom
dare not follow an independent foreign or internal
policy- is certainly beyond me.
It has begun to be a bit boring the way the Ameri
can press cries about the world public opinion.

Every day one reads about the way world people
arc crying against the veto. But it seems funny
when the only proof we get of this public opinion is
from American newspapers. A fairly impartial study
of the world press will show to the reader that though
people all over the world are divided on this issue, a
majority of them realize the importance and necessity
of the Principle of Unanimity. Of course, this can
be disproved by showing that all pro-veto news
papers are red or red-inspired or fellow travellers.
Whenever Russia has applied veto to any issue,
the majority of the American press has neglected to
mention all the issues involved. In one of the recent
cases, Russia vetoed the American proposals to put
the blame of the Greece situation on Yugoslavia,
Bulgaria, and Albania. This stand was vindicated
by the General Assembly of U.N. recently, when it
refused to put the blame on these countries. Ameri
can people were also not told the counter proposals by
Russians to correct the Greece situation. Russian
proposal was to set up an international commission
to assure that no foreigners interfere in Greece
except to give food. That meant that neither Yugo
slavia, Bulgaria, and Albania—whose past interfer
ence is doubtful—nor the U.S. and Britain—whose
interference is apparent—will interfere in Greece.
It will be left to the Greek people to settle their own
problems. Surely there is nothing wrong with the
principle that all peoples have a right to chose their
own economical, political, or social way of life. This
proposal, when enforced, would have removed all
danger of outside communist interference in Greece,
which is all that American and other people of the
world desire. Surely, U.N. docs not provide that
America should "save" other nations from internal
communists. But perhaps, this proposal was re
jected by the U.S. state department because it might
have stopped its own interference in Greece.
This case can be followed up by other examples.
I do not mean to suggest that Russia has been all
yood and America all bad; but ccrtainly the vice
versa is not true either. This applies to the principle
of veto too. Lastly in order to forstall those readers
who might rush to their typewriters and say that I
am defending Russia, I beg to say that I am defending
Russia and am also suggesting that Russia is not as
black or the U.S. as white as the American press
and its "public opinion" would have us believe.
