According to the experts, the
"first two weeks of college are the
roughest," so the thousand brand
new members of the Stanford Fam
ily can breathe a sigh of relief. The
Class of '51 has been duly initiated
into the traditions, excitement, and
confusion of registration.
The freshmen have had busy days
since their arrival on the campus
Friday morning, Sept. 2G.
With a welcoming assembly and a
rally on the date of their coming;
with exams, a football game, ex
change dinner, community singing,
and a jolly-up on Saturday; and
with a chapel service, campus tours,
and a barbecue on Sunday, the
Class of '51 was introduced to the
Farm.
Registration day, with its confu
sion and seat card lines, was met
with few of the "How do I get to
Roble?" and"I say, is Encina in that
direction?" questions. By Wednes
day, Oct. 1, the class was settled
and ready to "swing to."
