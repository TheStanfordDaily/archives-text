# Council Makes Policy Change; Conference to Revamp Rulings
## 
### 
Only minor changes in policy for
this year were enacted by Women's
Council at their first meeting last
week.
It was decided that only one slip
would be required for girls wlio are
signing out for both an overnight
and a 1:30. Changes in the key sys
tem for Row girls to be printed later
were also agreed upon.

more money, since the expense of
printing late-leave slips has drained
the budget.
