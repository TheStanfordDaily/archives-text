# SIRO Plans More Relief For 1947-48
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
To facilitate and encourage relief
and to adopt a foreign university so
as to alleviate its conditions, are the
two phases of the program of the
Stanford International Relief Or
ganization, declared Bill Dirker and
Molly Shaw, SIRO co-chairmen.
The principles of the organization,
they said, are: (1) to extend relief
activities throughout the student
body on a personal basis; (2.) to re
main non-controversial; and (3) to
operate in a continuing manner
rather than with sporadic concen
tated activity.
SIRO TAKING NAMES
SIRO collects relief material for
shipment to persons in need of aid
and will pay the postage on all re
lief parcels submitted by members
of the student body. The recipients
of packages are friends and relatives
of faculty and students who submit
ted names and addresses for the
SIRO files. Names may now be
taken to the SIRO office in the Rray
shack near Encina Commons, Mon
days and Thursdays from 4 to 6 p.m.
SIRO sent 140 11-pound packages
this summer and some 200 during
spring quarter. Workers are needed
to wrap the packages and collect the
donations from the campus resi
dence.
STANFORD ADOPTS SCHOOL
SIRO works with the World Stu
dent Service Fund and the Co-op
erative for American Remittances to
Europe (CARE). Through the WS
SF Stanford decided to adopt the
University of Naples for relief ac
tivities.
SIRO packages have been sent
to Japan, China, the Philippines,
Bulgaria, Poland, Finland, Yugosla
via, Hungary, Greece, Italy, Austria,
Germany, Czechoslovakia, France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Great Britain.
Letters, thanking SIRO for help
ing them in their need, have been
received from many of the recipi
ents. Some of the great apprecia
tion is shown in the excerpts from a
letter by a student in Amsterdam,
Holland.
DUTCH GIRL WRITES
."Dear Unknown! When I yester
day came back from my holidays,
I found such a fine packet coming
from California. What a surprise!
... I can't guess who is the friend
ly giver—nevertheless many thanks
for it!! Of course you know very
well how difficult it is here to be
come clothes, especially if you don't
have much money. I am wearing
clothes made before the war and
most rather bad. So you understand
that I am very glad with the packet.
Especially the red woolen dress is
wonderful! How did you know that
I am fond of red clothes? My feet
are already in the slippers and my
father admires my blue skirt and
fine blouse. I am really a fine lady
now! All fits me very well—how
did you know my size? . . . •
"Sorry, this was the first English
letter I wrote in my life, there will
be many blunders! Rebecca van
