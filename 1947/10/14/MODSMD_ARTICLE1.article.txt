# 'Y' Opens Membership Drive Among Campus Living Units
## Group Seeks All Out Aid 
### 
The YW C A membership
drive starts today, Peg Milnor,
president of the "Y," announced
yesterday. It will end Thurs
day.
A membership representative from
each living group on campus will
collect a dollar from each girl to
day, tomorrow, and Thursday for a
year's membership. One hundred
per cent houses will be announced
in The Daily tomorrow.
The "Y" cabinet stresses that
membership doesn't only mean giv
ing a dollar. "This dollar is a stand
ardized contribution from you to
support people and organizations on
campus that we consider worthy.
The fact that you understand our
purpose, and believe that your cam
pus "Y" is doing a good job, is as
important to us as your dollar,"
Sidney Morgan, vice-president of
the "Y" adds.
Each membership will make possi
ble:
1) The 55th year of continuous
extra-curricular activities for wo
men on campus.
2) Intercollegiate conferences,
membership in National YWCA, af
filiation with World Student Chris
tian Federation, and Social Affairs.
'.)) Contributions to social projects,
community and campus services,
emergency relief programs.
4) Office overhead.
The "Y" officers believe that the
Christian purpose of the "Y" is
sometimes lost sight of by its mem
bers, and wish to restate it here:
"We unite in the desire to realize
full and creative life through a
knowledge of God. We determine to
have a part in making this life possi
ble for all people. In this task we
seek to understand Jesus and to
follow him."
