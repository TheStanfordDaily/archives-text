# Proposal to Divide Palestine Meets with Russian Approval
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 13 (UP).â€”Russia, in a major policy
statement, today approved the principle of dividing Palestine
into Jewish and Arab states.
The Soviet stand, announced before the United Nations Palestine com
mittee, put Russia and the United States in basic agreement on a major
UN issue for the first tithe at this session and heightened the possibility
that a partition plan may win UN approval.
REVIVE INVESTIGATION
Russia, while favoring the idea of partition, objected to the boundaries
recommended by a UN investigating committee and suggested that spe
cific Soviet recommendations would be forthcoming later. Russia, like the
United States, failed to say how partition should be enforced.
JOINT STATE UNWORKABLE
Russia previously favored a joint Arab-Jewish state in Palestine if
that were practical, but Soviet Delegate S. K. Tsarapkin said today that
high tension now existing between Arab and Jewish interests made a
joint state unworkable.
Russia also:
1. Demanded that the British mandate over Palestine end as soon as
possible.
2. Asked the UN to agree on an authority to rule Palestine while the
country is being divided.
3. Pleaded for solution of the Palestine problem on "a broad political
basis," rather than on "academic" arguments over whether Jews or Arabs
were in Palestine first.
