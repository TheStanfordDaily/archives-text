# AFL President Green Rejects CIO Plea for Political Union
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13 (UP).—For the third time, in 10
months AFL President William Green today rejected a plea
from CIO President Phillip Murray for joint political action to
win a labor congress in 1948.
Murray appealed from the Cl|o convention at Boston to the

American Federation of Labor con
vention here for a joint AFL-CIO
Railroad Brotherhood program.
But Green insisted that "there
first must be organic unity before
we can have joint political action."
He said that he had "pleaded in vain
with Mr. Murray to meet again to
work out organic unity" which

would bring the CIO unions back
into the AFL.
The AFL executive committee
meanwhile went ahead with its own
political action program, and sub
mitted a proposal for a million dol
lar advertising attack on the Taft-
Hartley Act.
A one-cent per month increase in
the per capita membership tax was
recommended by the council to
raise the fund to battle the contro
versial 1947 labor law with a long
range educational and public re
lations program.
Grff.cn said that the AFL "Labor's
educational and political league"
would "definitely" oppose every
member of congress who voted for
the Taft-Hartley Act, but would not
endorse a presidential candidate.
