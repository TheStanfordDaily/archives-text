# 'Remove Debris,' Says Fire Chief
## 
### 
Is your room a fire trap? If you
have an accumulation of trash and
debris, your room is the potential
starting place of a fire, said Fire
Chief John M. Marston in connec
tion with Fire Prevention Week
which ended Saturday.
Mr. Marston urged that all stu
dents eliminate debris from their
rooms in an effort to promote fire
safety. Around campus and in the
dormitories students should be par
ticularly careful about not smoking
in restricted areas, particularly in
classrooms.
Last year the Fire Department
established uniform procedures for
conducting fire drills in all of the
University dormitories and houses.
Mr. Marston further emphasized
that students should learn these
procedures and familiarize them
selves with the location of the near
est alarm box and the Fire Depart
ment telephone number (PA 5111).
Fireproof construction is also
planned for all future buildings for
the University, including Crothers
Hall, the new residence for law
students. This feature will help
eliminate many of the hazards ex
isting in the older campus buildings,
the chief concluded.
