# German and Australian Students Need U.S. Books, Professors To Learn Fundamentals of Running A Democracy: Farrer
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
"Students in Germany and
Austria have no opportunity to
learn the fundamentals of run
ning a democracy." ISC repre
sentative Bill Farrer said, "be
cause they have no American
professors or textbooks."
In the American and British zones
of the two countries, any teachers :
with Nazi backgrounds were ban- j
ned. In the French zone of occupa- !
tion. however, these professors have
been welcomed to resume their
teaching, with the result that the j
French area has the best schools in 1
the Germany-Austria region.
ITALY
American tourists and soldiers ai t
disliked by Italians because of the ,

Americans' wealth and attitude of
superiority.
Greatest weapon against the U.S.
in Italy is the powerful Communist
press. Americans do not attempt to
combat the one-sided attacks made
by Red papers.
The Italian system of black mar
kets, he said, fluctuates with the ar
rival of American shipments in Ital
ian ports. Operating on a cigarette
economy, a large shipment of goods
forces the high prices down until
another scarcity arises.
GREECE
Because freedom of speech and
press prevails in Greece, Commu
nist papers are to be found on all
newsstands. Until last spring the
Greek people felt at odds with the
U.S. for supporting their reaction
ary government. Since then, how
ever, the United States supported

the liberal Sophoulos government.
POLAND
Unlike Greece, there are no op
position papers in Poland. The Red
star is to be seen everywhere. No
Poles can leave the country.
During his visit to Poland, Farrer
spoke to the student body president
of the University of Warsaw. The
student sairl that it would be impos
sible for him to study in any foreign
country under a scholarship be
cause his political position in the
university would bar his obtaining
! permission to leave Poland.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
In the center of Europe is Czecho
slovakia. Bearing a sympathy for
the U.S., the country is a testing
ground in Central Europe. Czecho
slovakia is not behind the iron cur
tain despite its Communist premier.
The Czechs are bothered by one

pressing problem—the rebirth of
German heavy machinery. Even
though the country is surrounded
on three sides by Russia or coun
tries within the Soviet sphere, the
Czechs fear a strong Germany ca
pable of rearming another military
machine.
WHAT ( AN WE DO?
Three plans exist for Stanford in
taking an active part in the world
scene, Farrer explained. The first is
to sponsor a school in Europe simi
lar to Harvard's Salzberg project.
Harvard spent $15,000 this sum
mer instructing 120 European stu
i dents in American government. We,
j too, could sponsor such a school,
teaching democratic principles to
students anxious to learn, he said.
Secondly. Stanford could sponsor
I a program to bring students to this
I University on scholarships. Each

living unit could support one such
student.
Finally, Farrer concluded, Farm
students could learn more about
Europe by going over there to
study. Foreign governments have
made arrangements whereby Ameri
can students can easily study in Eu
ropean universities at a reasonable
cost. Tuition and traveling costs are
very low.
Students studying in Italy under
the GI Bill, for example, report
that they are able to subsist on the
$(55 monthly subsistence allowed.
A group of 44 Stanford students
formed into a co-operative group
can charter a DC-4 plane for $340
round trip—a fare lower than third
class transport on ships in the
Queen Elizabeth and America cate
gory.
