# Activities Office Informs Students
## 
### 
Many students and a few organi
zations took advantage of the newly
completed Activity Files yesterday,
announced Cam Sanders, head of
the Activity Files office.
Many students, especially those
who entered Stanford this quarter,
came to the Activity Files office in
room one, ASSU Building, for in
formation. The question asked most
frequently was "Which 'I' Club is
which and what arc the functions
of each?"
Users of the files were given in
formation as to who is the president
of the organization in which each
was interested, and when and where
the next meeting would be.
Students are filed and tabbed ac
cording to 18 groups, including lit
erature, drama, language clubs, mu
sic, and photography.
