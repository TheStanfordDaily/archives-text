# NSA Becomes Active Organization; Convention Delegate Gives Report
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
The bureaucratic initialdom which has saturated the American public for more than a decade
has not failed to leave its imprint on Stanford.
There have been the ISC, WSSF, SIRO, lIR and so on. And there are excoms, vocoms, and
women's committees which sometimes are jocularly, but unofficially, called sexcoms.
As true as it is of the American public, it is equally true of Stanford students these initials

frequently fail to jar a knowledge
id thai l'ii which they stand into the
c.i: 11f11 observer's mind.
Now there comes to Stanford a
i,i w set dI initials —NSA . . . National
Siiidcnts' Association.
I (At MUCH APATHY
The history of NSA really starts
now. The group was on campus last
v :ii . under the aegis of its first
el:, inium, Marilyn Sidwell. But it
never really got started: too much
| ailis too little organization.
Ilnl I his summer Miss Sidwell and
lli e other students represented
Sianlord at a convention in Madi

Now Miss Sidwell is ending her
tenure with the NSA. She got it
■ i:trted, she kept it going, and now
Ihiil the huge convention has given
tin NSA a backbone —a constitution
AND a set of goals, she is stepping
down.
I iul let Ginny Tilus, blond, good
looking member of excom tell you
the story of the convention where
NSA, the organization which—if
Kxcom okays it —will have you and
you and you as its members, too,
j-ot started.

"II was a huge, heterogeneous
i (invention," Ginny said. "There were
720 delegates, the cream of the
country's crop, believe me. Every
viewpoint was represented. Most
schools were represented by their
presidents or vice-presidents.
"The amount done . . . the spirit
with which they tackled seemingly
insurmountable differences , . . the
amazing interest . . . the drama and
emotion . . . the light moments that
eased the tension when everybody

up.

"But they—from the extreme
rightists and leftists, from the south

they got together and reconciled
their differences and synthesized a

back.
"Stanford must back the NSA, too.
It is what its name implies ... a vast
union of students in this country for
the purpose of school helping school,
student helping student . . . each
student being united in common
pursuit of practical ideals . . . giv

"My answer is this: I don't think

"But the first thing we want to
do is get the respect of the students.
We are going to start out with goals
that can be accomplished. We are
not going to make the mistake of so
many organizations—that of too

"We are out to help the students

The bureaucratic initialdom which has saturated the American public for more than a decade
has not failed to leave its imprint on Stanford.
There have been the ISC, WSSF, SIRO, lIR and so on. And there are excoms, vocoms, and
women's committees which sometimes are jocularly, but unofficially, called sexcoms.
As true as it is of the American public, it is equally true of Stanford students these initials

frequently fail to jar a knowledge
id thai l'ii which they stand into the
c.i: 11f11 observer's mind.
Now there comes to Stanford a
i,i w set dI initials —NSA . . . National
Siiidcnts' Association.
I (At MUCH APATHY
The history of NSA really starts
now. The group was on campus last
v :ii . under the aegis of its first
el:, inium, Marilyn Sidwell. But it
never really got started: too much
| ailis too little organization.
Ilnl I his summer Miss Sidwell and
lli e other students represented
Sianlord at a convention in Madi
: on, Wisconsin.
Now Miss Sidwell is ending her
tenure with the NSA. She got it
■ i:trted, she kept it going, and now
Ihiil the huge convention has given
tin NSA a backbone —a constitution
AND a set of goals, she is stepping
down.
I iul let Ginny Tilus, blond, good
looking member of excom tell you
the story of the convention where
NSA, the organization which—if
Kxcom okays it —will have you and
you and you as its members, too,
j-ot started.
wide representation
"II was a huge, heterogeneous
i (invention," Ginny said. "There were
720 delegates, the cream of the
country's crop, believe me. Every
viewpoint was represented. Most
schools were represented by their
presidents or vice-presidents.
"The amount done . . . the spirit
with which they tackled seemingly
insurmountable differences , . . the
amazing interest . . . the drama and
emotion . . . the light moments that
eased the tension when everybody
thought the convention might crack
up.
1)11 lERENCES RECONCILED
"But they—from the extreme
rightists and leftists, from the south
and the north, from all religions—
they got together and reconciled
their differences and synthesized a
workable set of ideals which every
student in the United States can
back.
"Stanford must back the NSA, too.
It is what its name implies ... a vast
union of students in this country for
the purpose of school helping school,
student helping student . . . each
student being united in common
pursuit of practical ideals . . . giv
ing strength and meaning and sig
nificance to the pursuit of those
ideals.
"Of course, what the Stanford stu
dent is bound to ask is: 'What is in
it for me? Why should these in
itials mean more than the others to
me?'
I .EARN FROM OTHERS
"My answer is this: I don't think
we should put ourselves on a pedes
tal and feel we have nothing to
gain . . . But we can get help from
schools who have good student un
ions in planning ours; in revamp
ing our constitution we can look over
Ihe best of the other schools'.
