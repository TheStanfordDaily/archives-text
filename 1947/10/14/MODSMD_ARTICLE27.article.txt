follow then, and NSA operated un
der Excom.
It served then as a sort of problem
committee, trying to give informa
tion about campus problems to per
sons capable of acting on them. It
also endeavored to acquaint Stan
ford with NSA goals.
HASHING REPORT
The Hashing Report made to Ex
com is an example of NSA work
here last spring. As a result of this
report the hiring of hashers is now
determined primarily by the need of
the student, eliminating the hiring
of hashers because of personal
friendships.
The NSA program as outlined at
the convention this summer will in
clude a commission which will work
to strengthen student government
systems in American colleges. It
will do research on problems of de
lects in student governments, and
will keep a file of student constitu
tions throughout the country.
STUDENT RIGHTS
A program of student rights as
outlined by NSA includes that all
students have a right: (1) to an op
portunity for a college education;
(2) to conduct research freely and
to exchange findings; (3) to form
and belong to outside organizations;
(4) to a statement of contractual
rights and obligations before enter
ing college; (5) to establish publi
cations free of pressure; and (f>) to
an equal opportunity to enjoy these
rights without regard to race, color,
sex, national origin, or religious or
political beliefs.
On the subject of academic free
dom, NSA believes that a teacher is
entitled to freedom: (1) of research
and in publication of its results; (2)
in the classroom to discuss his sub
ject; (3) to join outside organiza
tions without discrimination, pro
viding the organizations are not il
legal under the civil statutes.
STUDENT-FACULTY RELATION
To improve student-faculty-ad
ministration relationships, NSA rec
ommends periodic meetings of stu
dents, faculty, and administration,
open to all students.
A survey of comparative educa
tional opportunities of white and
Negro students in the South was also
recommended at the convention. In
other states, NSA will endeavor to
investigate and act to eliminate dis
criminatory educational practices.
More courses dealing with the
moving factors in the world scene
and involving discussion of world

problems are recommended by
NSA. A course dealing with stu
dent government is being consid
ered also.
A third phase of NSA, interna
tional activities, was also outlined
at the convention. The delegates
voted to affiliate with the Interna
tional Union of Students. This un
ion, the largest student organization
in the world, is composed of stu
dents from all European countries
as well as countries in Africa and
Asia.
Through IUS, the National Stu
dent Association will have direct
contact with students in all sections
of the world and will also have ac
cess to IUS facilities in relation to
student relief, travel tours, ex
change student and faculty plans,
and many other fields in which IUS
has been active.
