"This is the Farm — one of the
greatest universities in the world,"
read the caption under a half-page
topside picture of the Stanford cam
pus in the San Francisco Chronicle's
"Airphoto Report: Stanford" yester
day.
Again the many-times told story
of Stanford was repeated by Robert
de Roos with a review of the Stan
lui'd.s' struggle to start and maintain
a young university, mixed with the
more timely observations of the
Farm in the post-war world.
When Stanford was proposed,
Easterners thought it was a joke to
"have a college in a cow pasture,"
said De Roos. The New York Mail
and Express thought that Stanford
professors would "lecture in marble
halls to empty benches."
De Roos observed that the Uni
versity in its growth and breadth
has proven these first criticisms to
be wrong in their judgments, be
cause "Stanford's towers were sand
stone, not ivory."
In the Airphoto Report, the
Chronicle included photographs of
the entire campus, one of the Inner
Quad, and one front-page shot of
the Hoover Tower.
