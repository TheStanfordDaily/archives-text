# Communistic Coup d'Etat in Italy Might Awaken U.S., Says Brandt
## 
### 
A "Communist coup d'etat victory i
in Italy" could be the "Pearl Har
bor" awakening of the American
public in the present war between
Russia and the United States and
allied democracies, according to Dr.
Karl Brandt, faculty member of the
Stanford University Food Research
Institute.
Dr. Brandt feels that food will be
the vital political factor in a Europe
facing another cold winter. "Europe
is facing the last few minutes before
zero hour," he said, "and the crisis
must be met by the U.S.'s helping
hand—filled with food."
"Europe will pay dividends in
many ways if the United States j
comes through at this time, for it j
is a mistake to believe that the Eu
ropean economy is so shot that it
can't be repaired," he declared.
Admitting that the continent has
sustained great damage, Brandt felt
that because it still has the nucleus ;
of an industrial plant, help from the |
United States would mean the dif- '

ference between failure and recov
ery.
Dr. Brandt has recently returned
from a trip to Europe where he
participated in an international con
ference of economists in Switzer
land. He served as economic ad
viser to the food and agriculture
branch of AM(J for Germany and
was a professor at the University of
Berlin until IJKI3. He has been a
Staniord laculty member since 19158.
The Marshall Plan should lie
supported, and much of it could be
financed privately, he believes. He
took issue with President Truman's
food conservation requests by stat
ing that the nation should eat more,
not less bread, and thereby less
meat. It takes seven pounds of
grain to grow one pound of meat,
he concluded.
