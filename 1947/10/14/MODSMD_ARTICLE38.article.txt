# Cardinal Crewmen Begin Workouts
## 
### 
The Stanford crew's fall quarter
machinery officially started rolling
yesterday afternoon, as more than
75 men went through their initial
work-outs. The executive part of
the group was set in motion when
the varsity squad elected officers for
the coming year. Jarvis Gates was
appointed captain; Jimmy Smith
took on the vice-captain's role; and
George Benedict was elected as
manager.
As for the seven-man crew coun
cil to handle the club's policy, Bene
dict stated that elections will not be
held until next week, when the oars
men have become better acquainted.
Four of the council's members must
be lower-division, the other three
being upperclassmen.
MNDSEY OUT
Lou Lindsey, last year's energetic
coach, has been forced to the side
lines with a back injury which will
necessitate an operation in the near
future. He will be out for the entire
quarter, and no definite successor has
been named yet. However, Lt.
Comm. Clark of the Navy contingent
here, who rowed on the Middie boat
for four years, will help out on the
coaching staff. Bob Merril, a four
year U.C.L.A. shell man, will coach
the 50 frosh oarsmen.
In an effort to get the freshmen
on the water as soon as possible the
varsity group spent yesterday after
noon putting the finishing touches on
the crew's equipment down on San
Francisco bay. The training scow
will be in shape for use Thursday
afternoon.
TWO NEW SHELLS
In addition to the five scarred
shells the club owns, a pair of new
boats, donated anonymously this
year, is expected to arrive some time
this month. A group of varsity men
will take out a boat for a tune-up
run this afternoon while the frosh
are expected to continue their cal
isthenic workouts of yesterday, in an
effort to work some of the summer
kinks and stiffness out.
Varsity engagements have been
scheduled for the season with Cali
fornia, Washington, U.C.L.A., and
Oregon State. Frosh tiffs are in the
offing although few have been set
definitely. A battle with the Cali
fornia fledglings is assured, however,
but although varsity opinion favors
the Indian freshman boat to win,
they will make no such predictions

Varsity engagements have been
scheduled for the season with Cali
fornia, Washington, U.C.L.A., and
Oregon State. Frosh tiffs are in the
offing although few have been set
definitely. A battle with the Cali
fornia fledglings is assured, however,
but although varsity opinion favors
the Indian freshman boat to win,
they will make no such predictions
The Stanford crew's fall quarter
machinery officially started rolling
yesterday afternoon, as more than
75 men went through their initial
work-outs. The executive part of
the group was set in motion when
the varsity squad elected officers for
the coming year. Jarvis Gates was
appointed captain; Jimmy Smith
took on the vice-captain's role; and
George Benedict was elected as
manager.
As for the seven-man crew coun
cil to handle the club's policy, Bene
dict stated that elections will not be
held until next week, when the oars
men have become better acquainted.
Four of the council's members must
be lower-division, the other three
being upperclassmen.
MNDSEY OUT
Lou Lindsey, last year's energetic
coach, has been forced to the side
lines with a back injury which will
necessitate an operation in the near
future. He will be out for the entire
quarter, and no definite successor has
been named yet. However, Lt.
Comm. Clark of the Navy contingent
here, who rowed on the Middie boat
for four years, will help out on the
coaching staff. Bob Merril, a four
year U.C.L.A. shell man, will coach
the 50 frosh oarsmen.
In an effort to get the freshmen
on the water as soon as possible the
varsity group spent yesterday after
noon putting the finishing touches on
the crew's equipment down on San
Francisco bay. The training scow
will be in shape for use Thursday
afternoon.
TWO NEW SHELLS
In addition to the five scarred
shells the club owns, a pair of new
boats, donated anonymously this
year, is expected to arrive some time
this month. A group of varsity men
will take out a boat for a tune-up
run this afternoon while the frosh
are expected to continue their cal
isthenic workouts of yesterday, in an
effort to work some of the summer
kinks and stiffness out.
