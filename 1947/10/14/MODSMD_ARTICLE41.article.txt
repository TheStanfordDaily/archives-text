# Indians In Late Scrum
## 
### 
The Stanford football team started
| its preparation for the UCLA game
j this weekend with a scrimmage ses
j sion which extended into the early
evening. Coach Marchie Schwartz
was working his men hard after the
disappointing loss to Santa Clara.
Combination first and second
| string teams drilled against a third
string eleven in an attempt to iron
out offensive and defensive faults
; which showed up in the Bronco
| tilt.
Status of the men on the Indians'
injured list is still in doubt. Added
' to the three holdovers who missed
j last week's tilt, is John Clark, first
string guard, who got a bad leg
injury Saturday. The three men
who were out of the Bronco game
: are Ainslee Bell, first string quar
terback, and George Quist and
Mickey Titus, No. 1 and No. 2 right
halfbacks, respectively.
BELL HAS CHANCE
It is still questionable whether
any or all of the four will be ready
to go against the Bruins. Bell, who
worked out in uniform yesterday, is
| given the best chance.
There were few rays of light for
, the Cardinals in the gloom of Sat
' urday's defeat. In the absence of
Bell, even their passing attack,
which brought them two touch
downs in the Michigan game was
weak. However team members are
determined that they will win a few
games despite their poor start, and
I morale remains high.
UCLA, coast conference champions
last year, brings a powerful team
to the Farm for Saturday's game.
The Bruins have a won 2 and lost
1 record, the only loss being a one
point defeat by Northwestern. Sat
urday the Uclans ran over Oregon,
â–  24 to 7.
HOISCII RAMBLES
The southerners' attack in the

Oregon game was led by A! Hoisch,
who at one time attended Stanford.
Other Bruin backfield stars are
quarterback Cal Rossi and fullback
"Moose" Myers.
Leading the Bruin line is end Tom
F'ears, candidate to succeed last
year's UCLA great, Burr Baldwin,
as Ail-American. Another standout
is center Don Paul.
