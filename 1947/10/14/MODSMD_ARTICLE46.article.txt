# Chuck Taylor, Former Card All-American, Returns to Farm as Freshman Grid Coach
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Another Stanford gridiron great of
the past returned to the Farm when
Chuck Taylor, former AU-American
guard accepted a position with the
Department of Athletics.
Born 27 years ago at Portland,
Oregon, Chuck moved south to Cal
ifornia at an early age and attended
schools in nearby San Jose. He grad
uated from San Jose High School and
entered Stanford in September, 1939.
Taylor, who played quarterback
his first year here, entered the Uni
versity at the same tima as Bruno
Banducci. Bruno proved to be his
future pjil, Delta Chi fraternity bro
ther, and Rose Bowl team mate.
The Indian frosh team of 1939 had
a great season, in contrast to the
varsity's record which ushered out
the 7-year Tiny Thornhill regime.

The yearlings, under the tutelage
of Harry Shipkey, and boasting such
! future stars as Hank Norberg, A 1
| Cole (who was killed during the
| war), and Milt Vucinich, in addition
j to Banducci and Taylor, gave new
j hope to victory-starved Cardinal
I football fans that year.
Taylor, as a sophomore in 1940,
was shifted to guard. As a regular
on the "Wow Boys" aggregation of
that year which swept over all com
petition including Nebraska in the
I Rose Bowl, he was practically a

I unanimous choice for all-Coast
honors.
In 1941, the defending champions
returned, minus Standlee, Gallar
neau, and Graff. The squad lost two
contests that season. The following
year, and Chuck's last for the Card
inals, they surged on to take their
lust six games after dropping the
opening four decisions.
Taylor was named to All-Coast
teams in each of his three varsity
years at Stanford, and was an All-
America selection in 1942. He also
played in the annual East-West
Shrine classic on New Year's Day of
1943.
CHUCK STEALS BALL
Taylor's greatest thrill came in
the U.S.C. game of 1942. According
to the Daily of the following Mon
day morning, "All was glorious foot
ball madness and Rose Bowl fever
as Saturday's locker room gang rang
out the aftermath of a thrilling 14-6
Stanford victory over favored South
ern California. Coach Marcbie
Schwartz had more smiles than usual
and big Charles "Red" Taylor had
the biggest of 'em all—you remem
ber, he was the man who stole the
ball from Mickey McCardle and
romped over the goal line for the
Indians' second touchdown.
"Taylor, who's been a non-titled
all-American for three years any
way, grabbed the pigskin and tallied

in a heads-up play that should tip
off the experts to their first-string
left guard position on the 1942 na
tional choice list."
Taylor graduated in March of 19411,
and within a matter of days joined
the United States Navy.
