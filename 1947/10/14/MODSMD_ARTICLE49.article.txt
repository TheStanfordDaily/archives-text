### GEORGE BRUNN 
Rents are going up in Louisville. By itself this
doesn't seem very important. But Louisville's rent
control board, in giving its OK to a s'/r increase,
is the first in any large city to do this and its action
is expected to set the pattern throughout the country.
While apartment house owners rub their hands
in glee John Doe swears and digs deeper into his
pockets. He knows the owners are entitled to a
fair profit but he also knows that they have been
better ofl in recent years than in any prewar year.
The same isn't true of John himself who is just about
as well off as in '39 since his higher wages have been
almost completely absorbed by higher prices.
The landlords argue that since everything is go
ing up, they too need an increase. Sounds fair enough
at first glance. But they neglect to tell you that be
fore the war many of their houses stood half empty
while now they have waiting lists for the next five
years. Even if they make a little less money per
apartment they are renting a lot more of them.
There is another thing John Doe might well
wonder about. He looks at the people who are on
Louisville's board and finds out that there are two
real estate men, two lawyers, and a banker. The
property interests seem to be well represented, but
who speaks for John?
If he looks at the boards of other towns he will

find that they are composed of pretty much the
same peopleâ€”a preponderance of realtors, bankers,
and lawyers. To take an example close to home:
at least five of the six members of the San Jose
board have real estate interests. Can John expect
a square break?
John might then think of all the denouncing
the Republicans have done of "bureaucratic New
Deal controls." If it weren't for them, they used to
say, prices would soon come down. So they did
away with OPA and today John pays at least 25'/r
more for his food than a year ago.
Then they did away with bureaucratic New Deal
rent control and established non-bureaucratic Old
Deal rent control. Result: John's rent is going up.
GOP prophecies would be funny if their results
weren't so tragic for so many. Yet we continue to
listen to the men who have been continually wrong
for the past twenty years, who said first that Mus
solini wasn't so bad, then that the depression was only
a mild recess, then that Hitler wasn't dangerous, then
that we shouldn't stop selling scrap iron to the Japs,
then that there was no sense in fortifying Pacific
Islands because there wouldn't be any war, and
finally that prices would soon drop if we only took
their advice and abolished controls. What's their
next prophecy?
