# New Associate Director of 'Y' Likes Informality of Stanford
## 
### JACKIE MILNOR 
Young enough to be mistaken for
a freshman and as pretty as a Chap
pie Queen is Mrs. Robert Fess, the
YWCA's new associate director, as
sisting Miss Pat Davidson, execu
tive secretary of the "Y."
Mrs. Fess' background has made
her well suited for an associate "Y"
director's duties. She was graduat
ed from UCLA in 1946 and was
vice-president of the student body
there. A member of the Delta Gam
ma sorority and of Mortar Board,
she was also on the board of direc
tors of the Los Angeles chapter of
the Red Cross and chairman of the
college unit of the Red Cross of
UCLA.
She thinks the Farm is "wonder
ful" and was impressed with its
friendly and informal atmosphere.
She believes that because UCLA is
closer to a city, rather than being
isolated as is Stanford, UCLA has
more the appearance of sophistica
tion. "But I like the informality,"
she quickly adds.
Mrs. Fess was bewildered at first

;ind had trouble finding her way
around, but she went with all the
freshmen to their first assembly and
now is almost thoroughly acclimat
ed. However, she never had trouble
finding her way to the Biz School,
for her husband, Robert Fess, a
Stanford Delt, is beginning his first
year of graduate study there.
She is very enthusiastic about her
work and particularly her "wonder
ful boss, Miss Pat." She is to work

with the newly organized class "Y"
cabinets and advise and help them
with their projects, such as the new
sophomore leadership council, now
sponsored by the Sophomore "Y."
She is particularly anxious to
meet all the members of the "Y"
and urges that "everyone come up
and have a chat" in her offices in the
"Y" rooms.
