To the Editor:
While the subject is still raising ruff, another
word about women's wardrobes. Maybe the men
don't like the New Look and length; maybe women
don't like it either, but the fact remains that the
fashion is IN. If no reason, there is rime.
Though instigated in Paris, can it be called un-
American? It seems, rather, quite characteristic of
Americans. What other nation of women would be
dictated to so willingly, after just enough struggle to
make resignation delicious. What other body of
women still play "dress-ups" in a grown up world.
(Dress-ups: the game we played for hours when ten
years old of dressing up in our mother's old clothes
pretending to be what we weren't.) At least at ten
we knew what we were pretending to be. Women
arc enjoying the new swirls and sweeps as they
would have delighted in the blinking blue glass
eyes of a new doll, enjoying them for themselves,
without any recognition of their relation to the
American pattern of living, or the impact this ap
parent indulgence may have upon the opinions
forming in the minds of women in the world to whom
life means pain and sacrifice. Not more.
If women are to be chided for following the
fashion in such an adolescent frame of mind . . .
their attitude is no more adolescent than the irre
sponsible behavior of occupation troops, or the in
effective diplomacy of the U.S., or the sunny optim
ism that prevented honest anticipation of Russia's
moves, or the way American students do not rise to
fulfill the light of expectancy in the eyes of their
foreign comrades, or the way G.l.'s came home and
tied themselves discontentedly back onto their mo
thers' apron strings instead of relating their world
experience to living here right now.
The American is non-selfconscious of himself as
the obligee of the world. He ignores the pleading
world as a teenage girl might ignore the boy whom
she adored until she won him. That is adolescent.
Hope always finds a ripple in a stagnant pool
from which to drink. And the change in fashion
shows that woman has sensed a need to be refemin
i/.ed. Maybe it was instigated by others for purely
esthetic or more probably economic reasons, yet she
has accepted them. The new trend emphasizes her
natural form—full hips, rounded shoulders, soft
curves, and a lengthened swing in the skirt is not
only attractive; it is graceful. (If the former sweater
and sox girl knows how to walk with grace.) Com
ing from France perhaps it is a healthy indication
that women's denial of the function of woman-hood
in society is having something to do with the degen
eration of national life on all levels. So maybe wo
men are discovering their real fort of power, intu
itively of course, in the new flounce and flare. Maybe
from this beginning they will go on to discover their
near-vacant place as delighters, makers of comfort,
conditioners for inspiration, blockers for another
on his path to greatness, molders of harmony, moth
ers of men, fountains of understanding.

Mystery cloaks woman's nature anyway. So why
not make moment of it. Why not make herself an
enticing complement to the man she hunts, instead
of a competitive pest.
This sense of being feminine runs deep, much
deeper than the pseudo-masculine attitudes of the
past decade or so. So when we bring down our
skirts and bead our lapels, take heart. We're not
just playing dress-ups, but may someday grow to be
mature women, realizing that fashioning begins un
der the cover of clothes and under the shape that
fills them. Ann Kimber
To the Editor:
Last October the Los Angeles Coliseum rocked
with Indian yells as a Stanford team fought a losing
battle against the Uclans. Our Indians trailed by a
lopsided score nt half time. Hopes of winning the
game had been abandoned. "Yet when the second half
opened the Indian team came out fighting, and the
stands cheered as loudly as they had for the kickoff.
After the game the Stanfords roared out of the sta
dium singing and cheering.
As we drove away from the stadium, we were
asked the score of the game. When we replied, 26-6,
we were amazed to hear, "Did you beat them that
badly!" "No, they beat us." Stanford spirit was tre
mendous. Even in losing, we could fool the citizens
of Los Angeles. The LA papers talked at length of
how the little Card rooting section had kept itself 011
even terms with the vast Bruin student body. And
the spirit remained terrific throughout the season.
In 1946 there was no feud between Rally Com
and the student body.
Last Saturday a lot of students went to the game
early in hopes of getting desirable seats somewhere
in the 30th and 40th rows. They found themselves
listening to papers being shuffled in the press box.
That, in itself, wouldn't have been too bad. But the
Rally Com boys who shoved them into those seats
were not courteous. To really look the part they
played, they should have been carrying rifles with
fixed bayonets. Yet Rally Com demands courtesy
from the rooters.
If any Rally Com members happened to notice
where the card throwing began, they will undoubted
ly remember that it was from those seats which first
fall within the shadow of the press box. It was not
a display of dissatisfaction with the team. It was a
protest against the methods used by Rally Com. The
crying on the part of the Committee in Monday's
Daily seems to indicate that they were not sharp
enough to interpret it as such.
The simple fact is: Wo did not chose to go to the
military academy, and we will continue to refuse to
be regimented like cadets.
I'll stick my neck out and predict that Rally Com
will get roughly the same cooperation and courtesy
from the student body that it is willing to give to the
student body.

deeper than the pseudo-masculine attitudes of the
past decade or so. So when we bring down our
skirts and bead our lapels, take heart. We're not

mature women, realizing that fashioning begins un

Last October the Los Angeles Coliseum rocked
with Indian yells as a Stanford team fought a losing
battle against the Uclans. Our Indians trailed by a
lopsided score nt half time. Hopes of winning the
game had been abandoned. "Yet when the second half
opened the Indian team came out fighting, and the
stands cheered as loudly as they had for the kickoff.
After the game the Stanfords roared out of the sta
dium singing and cheering.
As we drove away from the stadium, we were
asked the score of the game. When we replied, 26-6,
we were amazed to hear, "Did you beat them that
badly!" "No, they beat us." Stanford spirit was tre
mendous. Even in losing, we could fool the citizens
of Los Angeles. The LA papers talked at length of
how the little Card rooting section had kept itself 011
even terms with the vast Bruin student body. And
the spirit remained terrific throughout the season.
In 1946 there was no feud between Rally Com
and the student body.
Last Saturday a lot of students went to the game
early in hopes of getting desirable seats somewhere
in the 30th and 40th rows. They found themselves
listening to papers being shuffled in the press box.
That, in itself, wouldn't have been too bad. But the
Rally Com boys who shoved them into those seats
were not courteous. To really look the part they
played, they should have been carrying rifles with
fixed bayonets. Yet Rally Com demands courtesy
from the rooters.
If any Rally Com members happened to notice
where the card throwing began, they will undoubted
ly remember that it was from those seats which first
fall within the shadow of the press box. It was not
a display of dissatisfaction with the team. It was a
protest against the methods used by Rally Com. The
crying on the part of the Committee in Monday's
Daily seems to indicate that they were not sharp
enough to interpret it as such.
The simple fact is: Wo did not chose to go to the
military academy, and we will continue to refuse to
be regimented like cadets.
I'll stick my neck out and predict that Rally Com
will get roughly the same cooperation and courtesy
from the student body that it is willing to give to the
student body.

While the subject is still raising ruff, another
word about women's wardrobes. Maybe the men
don't like the New Look and length; maybe women
don't like it either, but the fact remains that the
fashion is IN. If no reason, there is rime.
Though instigated in Paris, can it be called un-
American? It seems, rather, quite characteristic of
Americans. What other nation of women would be
dictated to so willingly, after just enough struggle to
make resignation delicious. What other body of
women still play "dress-ups" in a grown up world.
(Dress-ups: the game we played for hours when ten
years old of dressing up in our mother's old clothes
pretending to be what we weren't.) At least at ten
we knew what we were pretending to be. Women
arc enjoying the new swirls and sweeps as they
would have delighted in the blinking blue glass
eyes of a new doll, enjoying them for themselves,
without any recognition of their relation to the
American pattern of living, or the impact this ap
parent indulgence may have upon the opinions
forming in the minds of women in the world to whom
life means pain and sacrifice. Not more.
If women are to be chided for following the
fashion in such an adolescent frame of mind . . .
their attitude is no more adolescent than the irre
sponsible behavior of occupation troops, or the in
effective diplomacy of the U.S., or the sunny optim
ism that prevented honest anticipation of Russia's
moves, or the way American students do not rise to
fulfill the light of expectancy in the eyes of their
foreign comrades, or the way G.l.'s came home and
tied themselves discontentedly back onto their mo
thers' apron strings instead of relating their world
experience to living here right now.
The American is non-selfconscious of himself as
the obligee of the world. He ignores the pleading
world as a teenage girl might ignore the boy whom
she adored until she won him. That is adolescent.
Hope always finds a ripple in a stagnant pool
from which to drink. And the change in fashion
shows that woman has sensed a need to be refemin
i/.ed. Maybe it was instigated by others for purely
esthetic or more probably economic reasons, yet she
has accepted them. The new trend emphasizes her
natural form—full hips, rounded shoulders, soft
curves, and a lengthened swing in the skirt is not
only attractive; it is graceful. (If the former sweater
and sox girl knows how to walk with grace.) Com
ing from France perhaps it is a healthy indication
that women's denial of the function of woman-hood
in society is having something to do with the degen
eration of national life on all levels. So maybe wo
men are discovering their real fort of power, intu
itively of course, in the new flounce and flare. Maybe
from this beginning they will go on to discover their
near-vacant place as delighters, makers of comfort,
conditioners for inspiration, blockers for another
on his path to greatness, molders of harmony, moth
ers of men, fountains of understanding.

Mystery cloaks woman's nature anyway. So why
not make moment of it. Why not make herself an
enticing complement to the man she hunts, instead
of a competitive pest.

(Dress-ups: the game we played for hours when ten
years old of dressing up in our mother's old clothes
pretending to be what we weren't.) At least at ten
we knew what we were pretending to be. Women
arc enjoying the new swirls and sweeps as they
would have delighted in the blinking blue glass
eyes of a new doll, enjoying them for themselves,
without any recognition of their relation to the
American pattern of living, or the impact this ap
parent indulgence may have upon the opinions
forming in the minds of women in the world to whom
life means pain and sacrifice. Not more.
If women are to be chided for following the
fashion in such an adolescent frame of mind . . .
their attitude is no more adolescent than the irre
sponsible behavior of occupation troops, or the in
effective diplomacy of the U.S., or the sunny optim
ism that prevented honest anticipation of Russia's
moves, or the way American students do not rise to
fulfill the light of expectancy in the eyes of their
foreign comrades, or the way G.l.'s came home and
tied themselves discontentedly back onto their mo
thers' apron strings instead of relating their world
experience to living here right now.
The American is non-selfconscious of himself as
the obligee of the world. He ignores the pleading
world as a teenage girl might ignore the boy whom
she adored until she won him. That is adolescent.
Hope always finds a ripple in a stagnant pool
from which to drink. And the change in fashion
shows that woman has sensed a need to be refemin
i/.ed. Maybe it was instigated by others for purely
esthetic or more probably economic reasons, yet she
has accepted them. The new trend emphasizes her
natural form—full hips, rounded shoulders, soft
curves, and a lengthened swing in the skirt is not
only attractive; it is graceful. (If the former sweater
and sox girl knows how to walk with grace.) Com
ing from France perhaps it is a healthy indication
that women's denial of the function of woman-hood
in society is having something to do with the degen
eration of national life on all levels. So maybe wo
men are discovering their real fort of power, intu
itively of course, in the new flounce and flare. Maybe
from this beginning they will go on to discover their
near-vacant place as delighters, makers of comfort,
conditioners for inspiration, blockers for another
on his path to greatness, molders of harmony, moth
ers of men, fountains of understanding.

Mystery cloaks woman's nature anyway. So why
not make moment of it. Why not make herself an
enticing complement to the man she hunts, instead
of a competitive pest.
This sense of being feminine runs deep, much
deeper than the pseudo-masculine attitudes of the
past decade or so. So when we bring down our
skirts and bead our lapels, take heart. We're not
just playing dress-ups, but may someday grow to be
mature women, realizing that fashioning begins un
der the cover of clothes and under the shape that
fills them. Ann Kimber

Last October the Los Angeles Coliseum rocked
with Indian yells as a Stanford team fought a losing
battle against the Uclans. Our Indians trailed by a
lopsided score nt half time. Hopes of winning the
game had been abandoned. "Yet when the second half
opened the Indian team came out fighting, and the
stands cheered as loudly as they had for the kickoff.
After the game the Stanfords roared out of the sta
dium singing and cheering.
As we drove away from the stadium, we were
asked the score of the game. When we replied, 26-6,
we were amazed to hear, "Did you beat them that
badly!" "No, they beat us." Stanford spirit was tre
mendous. Even in losing, we could fool the citizens
of Los Angeles. The LA papers talked at length of
how the little Card rooting section had kept itself 011
even terms with the vast Bruin student body. And
the spirit remained terrific throughout the season.
In 1946 there was no feud between Rally Com
and the student body.
Last Saturday a lot of students went to the game
early in hopes of getting desirable seats somewhere
in the 30th and 40th rows. They found themselves
listening to papers being shuffled in the press box.
That, in itself, wouldn't have been too bad. But the
Rally Com boys who shoved them into those seats
were not courteous. To really look the part they
played, they should have been carrying rifles with
fixed bayonets. Yet Rally Com demands courtesy
from the rooters.
If any Rally Com members happened to notice
where the card throwing began, they will undoubted
ly remember that it was from those seats which first
fall within the shadow of the press box. It was not
a display of dissatisfaction with the team. It was a
protest against the methods used by Rally Com. The
crying on the part of the Committee in Monday's
Daily seems to indicate that they were not sharp
enough to interpret it as such.
The simple fact is: Wo did not chose to go to the
military academy, and we will continue to refuse to
be regimented like cadets.
I'll stick my neck out and predict that Rally Com
will get roughly the same cooperation and courtesy
from the student body that it is willing to give to the
student body.
