# Cardinal's Workings Revealed to Campus
## 
### MARGE SAMPSON 
If the freshmen have read their Frosh Bible diligently they
should know what Cardinals is and does, which is probably more
than one can say for the remaining students on campus. And
even at that, more people know what Cardinals is, than what
it does.
Thirteen years ago, when Cardinals was started, it had the

idealistic and abstract aim of keep
ing alive Stanford spirit. This was
supplemented by a few concrete
functions.
CON HOME
Cardinals has always had the job
of putting over the Convalescent
Home Drive every spring quarter,
and this was climaxed last year when
the drive topped all previous rec
ords under committee chairman Bob
Coate.
This committee at one time han
dled the reg dances, until it was de
cided to let a group in financial need
put them on. This follows another
duty of Cardinals: that of promoting
any campus activity in need of as
sistance.
This fall quarter Cardinals' main
worry is the Big Game Homecoming.
Previously Homecoming was held
every other year with the USC game,
and Cardinals now wants to establish
the tradition of holding Homecom
ing on the alternate years when the
Big Game is played at Stanford.
CARDINAL SUPERVISION
Rally Com, which is under the di
rect supervision of Cardinals, will
make its Big Game plans in conjunc
tion with the Homecoming. The
topic of the Big Game parade will
carry this out with its theme being
"Stanford Cavalcade."
One of the lesser known duties
of Cardinals is that of being in
charge of the guide service which
welcomes visitors on campus. Card
inals also usher at assemblies when
asked.
Although there are normally thir
teen students on the committee, only
ten are true Cardinals. ASSU vice
president, and the Rally Com co
chairmen each attend meetings and
have a vote.
0:4 RATIO
The group of ten Cardinals is made
up of four women and six men, not
more than five of whom shall have
senior standing. ASSU Constitution
suggests that of the five juniors,
three be men and two women.
Cardinals elects its own members
once a year, during spring quarter,
and holds replacement tryouts dur
ing the year when needed.
Qualifications for Cardinals are
elastic, sincere interest in Stanford's
welfare and spirit and capability to
conduct University activities on an
all-campus scale being the prime
requisites.
Cardinals is a group composed of

student leaders who are truly inter
ested in the activities of the school,
and do their best to coordinate those
activities into a well-balanced intel
lectual, social, and cultural program.

topic of the Big Game parade will
carry this out with its theme being
"Stanford Cavalcade."
One of the lesser known duties
of Cardinals is that of being in
charge of the guide service which
welcomes visitors on campus. Card
inals also usher at assemblies when
asked.
Although there are normally thir
teen students on the committee, only
ten are true Cardinals. ASSU vice
president, and the Rally Com co
chairmen each attend meetings and
have a vote.
0:4 RATIO
The group of ten Cardinals is made
up of four women and six men, not
more than five of whom shall have
senior standing. ASSU Constitution
suggests that of the five juniors,
three be men and two women.
Cardinals elects its own members
once a year, during spring quarter,
and holds replacement tryouts dur
ing the year when needed.
Qualifications for Cardinals are
elastic, sincere interest in Stanford's
welfare and spirit and capability to
conduct University activities on an
all-campus scale being the prime
requisites.
Cardinals is a group composed of

student leaders who are truly inter
ested in the activities of the school,
and do their best to coordinate those
activities into a well-balanced intel
lectual, social, and cultural program.
If the freshmen have read their Frosh Bible diligently they
should know what Cardinals is and does, which is probably more
than one can say for the remaining students on campus. And
even at that, more people know what Cardinals is, than what
it does.
Thirteen years ago, when Cardinals was started, it had the

idealistic and abstract aim of keep
ing alive Stanford spirit. This was
supplemented by a few concrete
functions.
CON HOME
Cardinals has always had the job
of putting over the Convalescent
Home Drive every spring quarter,
and this was climaxed last year when
the drive topped all previous rec
ords under committee chairman Bob
Coate.
This committee at one time han
dled the reg dances, until it was de
cided to let a group in financial need
put them on. This follows another
duty of Cardinals: that of promoting
any campus activity in need of as
sistance.
This fall quarter Cardinals' main
worry is the Big Game Homecoming.
Previously Homecoming was held
every other year with the USC game,
and Cardinals now wants to establish
the tradition of holding Homecom
ing on the alternate years when the
Big Game is played at Stanford.
CARDINAL SUPERVISION
Rally Com, which is under the di
rect supervision of Cardinals, will
make its Big Game plans in conjunc
