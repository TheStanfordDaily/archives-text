# To Speak as You Think'--Farm Looks at World
## 
### 
"Those who won our independence believed that the final
end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties;
and that in its government the deliberative forces should prevail
over the arbitrary. . . .
"They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak
as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread
of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discus
sion would be futile; . . .
"They recognized the risks to which all human institutions
are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely
through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous
to discourage thought, hope, and imagination; that fear breeds
repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable
government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to dis
cuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and

that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. ..."
—Chief Justice Louis D. Brandeis
Whitney vs. California, 1926.
