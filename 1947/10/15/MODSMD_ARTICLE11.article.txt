# TEN NAMES PUT ON FILE FOR EX COMMITTEE POST
## 
### 
Ten Farm students filed their nominations for the vacant District 1
(off-campus) Excom seat yesterday before the time limit, Eligibility Chair
man Jane Hillman announced.
"While none of the students involved has been checked by the board
for eligibility," she continued, "we believe there will be more than four

candidates. This will automatically
make the Oct. 22 voting a primary
election. The final election will fol
low on Oct. 29 when the top four
candidates vie for the seat."
CANDIDATES TO MEET
Candidates for Excom will meet
tomorrow at 1 p.m. in Tom Martz
loff's office in the Student Union,
Election Board chairman Gordon
Ness said. Official candidates for the
election will be announced in
Thursday's Daily.
"Village students are not consid
ered as off-campus residents," Ness
advised. "Only those men and wom
en living in non-University homes
are considered as off-campus. This
includes students living in private
homes on campus, in Palo Alto, San
Mateo, or any other town," he
added.

derson, Merlen W. Baker, Alan L.

ed expenses for campaigning within
48 hours of their nomination, on
blanks printed in last Thursday's
Daily. Costs must not exceed $10,
Ness added.
Election Board will announce the
date of the freshman election later
