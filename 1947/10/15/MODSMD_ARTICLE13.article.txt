# Rent Decontrol Policy Reversed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP).—
Rent Director Frank Creedon, in an
apparent reversal of an earlier pol
icy decision, today rejected decon
trol recommendations of a Clovis,
N.M., local rent board and laid down
four rules to govern the scrapping
of rent controls.
The board's proposal to remove
rent ceilings in the Clovis-Portales
area was turned down because it
had not been "properly substanti
ated."
Creedon told newsmen that the
rent law specifically empowers him
to determine what constitutes "pro
per findings" by local boards and
he intends to exercise that authority
to the limit.
(Regional Rent Control board, San
Jose, told The Daily, "Our Board
is not yet completely organized un
der the new law. So far there have
been no changes made in rents in
the Palo Alto area. Until the board
is complete and until we have di
rectives we will not know what
action is to be taken if any.")
