# Japanese Need More Food'-Bennett
## 
### 
An adequate food supply for Japan
remains a No. 1 problem of our oc
cupation forces, Dean Merrill K.
Bennett told a Tuesday Evening Se
ries Audience last night in Me
morial Auditorium.
Dean Bennett, head of the School
of Social Sciences and executive di
rector of the Food Research Insti
tute, thought that the food situation
was precarious and highly uncom
fortable, but could not be called dis
astrous or even immediately damag
ing to life and health.
JUST RETURNED FROM JAPAN
A leading authority on food econ
omics, Dean Bennett has just re
turned from a six-week stay in
Japan as a member of a six-man
commission studying the democrat
ization of Japanese research. He
thought that (he food situation will
cause trouble for everybody, occupa
tion forces and Japanese alike, al
though he admitted that it may be
a just infliction.
"I would be inclined to question
statistics which show that Japan is
living on three-fourths of its normal
food supply, with the urban popula
tion living on considerably less than
three-fourths of its normal supply,"
he said.
Dean Bennett felt that these fig
ures could be overly pessimistic, be

cause the Japanese officials who
estimate domestic crops, and the
farmers who grow them, have every
incentive to underestimate output
and no incentive to overestimate it.
"What I saw," he said, "was a
conspicuous absence of fat people of
all ages, some babies excepted, and
some emaciation among the old. I
could see no difference at all be
tween urban people and rural peo
ple."
SHORTAGE BRINGS INFLATION
Domestic crop acreage has been
somewhat increased, rather than de
creased as official Japanese statistics
indicate, Dean Bennett thought.
Fish output is below prewar levels,
he said, since the Japanese are now
greatly restricted as to the waters in
which they can fish.
"As to important items," he said,
"about all that comes in is the bare
minimum of grain, largely wheat
and corn. This is controlled by the
occupation authorities and released
at strategic moments, and its volume
is of immense political importance."
"In the presence of shortages,
though not by reason of them alone j
inflation of prices is a dominant [
feature of life in Japan," he con
tinued.
He reported that many members j
of the academic group were leading I
an "onion life" in which they peel J

off and sell layer after layer of their
possessions; including clothing, and
weep as they peel.
Dean Bennett said that he be
lieves that the current Japanese po

litical leadership is oriented towards
peaceful international relations and
toward democracy as distinguished
from autarchy in any form, including
communism.

JUST RETURNED FROM JAPAN
A leading authority on food econ
omics, Dean Bennett has just re
turned from a six-week stay in
Japan as a member of a six-man
commission studying the democrat
ization of Japanese research. He
thought that (he food situation will
cause trouble for everybody, occupa
tion forces and Japanese alike, al
though he admitted that it may be
a just infliction.
"I would be inclined to question
statistics which show that Japan is
living on three-fourths of its normal
food supply, with the urban popula
tion living on considerably less than
three-fourths of its normal supply,"
he said.
Dean Bennett felt that these fig
ures could be overly pessimistic, be

cause the Japanese officials who
estimate domestic crops, and the
farmers who grow them, have every
incentive to underestimate output
and no incentive to overestimate it.
"What I saw," he said, "was a
conspicuous absence of fat people of
all ages, some babies excepted, and
some emaciation among the old. I
could see no difference at all be
tween urban people and rural peo
ple."
SHORTAGE BRINGS INFLATION
Domestic crop acreage has been
somewhat increased, rather than de
creased as official Japanese statistics
indicate, Dean Bennett thought.
Fish output is below prewar levels,
he said, since the Japanese are now
greatly restricted as to the waters in
which they can fish.
"As to important items," he said,
"about all that comes in is the bare
minimum of grain, largely wheat
and corn. This is controlled by the
occupation authorities and released
at strategic moments, and its volume
is of immense political importance."
"In the presence of shortages,
though not by reason of them alone j
inflation of prices is a dominant [
feature of life in Japan," he con
tinued.
He reported that many members j
of the academic group were leading I
an "onion life" in which they peel J

off and sell layer after layer of their
possessions; including clothing, and
weep as they peel.
Dean Bennett said that he be
lieves that the current Japanese po

litical leadership is oriented towards
peaceful international relations and
toward democracy as distinguished
from autarchy in any form, including
communism.
