yesterday in his running battle
with the AFL executive council.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14 (UP).
— The AFL today slapped down
John L. Lewis by voting to amend
its constitution to change the vice
presidents' title to executive board
member in order that federal labor
unions can obtain the services of
the National Labor Relations Board.
Daniel W. Tracy, president of the
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
was the leading contender for the
board position left open by Lewis.
The action followed two hours of
bitter debate between Lewis, presi
dent of the United Mine Workers,
Secretary-Treasurer George Meany,
AFL President William Green,
Teamsters' President Daniel Tobin,
and David Dubinsky, president of
the Ladies' Garment Workers' Un
ion.
ALL OPPOSE LEWIS
All were opposed to Lewis and
their victory means that Green and
Meany will comply with the Taft-
Hartley Law by signing non-Com
munist affidavits. The action will
benefit 290,000 members in federal
unions.
During the sometimes bitter de
bate. Meany accused Lewis of fight
ing against Communism with his
right arm but "between 1935 and
1940 when he 1940 when he led the
CIO with his left hand he gave aid
and comfort to Harry Bridges, Jul
ius Emspak, Michael Quill, and
Louis Merrill and all the other
stinking American-haters who love
Moscow."
The four men named arc CIO un
ion leaders.
END CONSCRIPTION
The convention called for an end
to peacetime conscription in all
countries, changes in the UN to
abolish the veto power, the free in
terchange of information between
countries, and the principles of the
Atlantic Charter used as a guide to
international relations.
The series of resolutions topped
off a surprise request for another
$2,000,000 to add to a political edu
cation fund that may reach a total
of $10,000,000 to combat "anti-labor"
Congressmen and elect a labor Con
gress in 1948.


JOHN L. LEWIS lost a round
yesterday in his running battle
with the AFL executive council.
