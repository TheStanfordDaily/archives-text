# 'Lift Minimum Wage to 75c'
## 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. J4 (UP).â€”Secre
tary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellen
bach put the administration on rec
ord today in favor of an immediate
increase in the federal minimum
wage to 75 cents per hour.
He made his recommendation,
more liberal than he had previously
advocated, in a speech before the
ninth annual CIO convention here.
He spoke after Walter Reuther,
president of the United Automobile
Workers and CIO vice president, had
served notice that the CIO would see
U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft, R., 0.,
"in hell before we'll see him in the
White House."
Schwellenbach recalled he had
asked Congress last year and this
year to raise the present 40 cents
an-hour minimum wage t.o 65 cents
with a gradual step up later to .75.
Criticizing Congress for cutting
Labor Department appropriations,
he told the convention that a bill to
raise the minimum wage would be
"a phoney" unless Congress pro
vider! adequate funds to enforce the
new law.
Without naming the communists,
he criticized them for a course of
"reactionaryism" in the labor move
ment.
As he did before the AFL con
vention last week, Schwellenbach
denied that wage increases alone
could be blamed for rising prices.
He said increased profits must bear
"a substantial part of the burden."
After Sehwellenbach's speech, the
convention heard CIO president
I Philip Murray and other delegates
j denounce the Taft-Hartley Bill in
j bitter terms. The more than 000 del
egates then rose as one in a unani-
J mous standing vote approving a res
| olution pledging the CIO to fight
for repeal of the act.
When Murray announced the re
| suit was unanimous, the delegates
J cheered and applauded loudly.
