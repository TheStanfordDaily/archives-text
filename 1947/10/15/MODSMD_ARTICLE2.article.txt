# Vishinsky Knocks UN 'Little Assembly'
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 14 (UP). â€”The American move to set up a
year-round United Nations "Little Assembly" today touched off a fiery
personal debate, pitting John Foster Dulles against Andrei Y. Vishinsky,
the Soviet spokesman who previously had called Dulles a leading U.S.
"war-monger."
Dulles, top Republican adviser on foreign affairs, amplified the American

plan, first presented by Secretary of
State George Marshall, with the
warning that UN would fail in its
peace-keeping duties unless it sets
up new machinery to handle world
problems which the General As
sembly is not meeting.
'PLANNED BY REACTIONARIES'
Vishinsky leaped up to attack the
whole plan as one concocted by re
actionary circles which hope to
sidestep the veto, weaken UN, and
aid warmongers.
Dulles, in opening the debate,
pointed out that' the General As
sembly meets only about two
months a year. This, he said, was
not long enough to solve the stag
gering world problems.
He proposed a continuing "Little
Assembly" of all 57 UN members,
who could take action by a two
thirds majority.
UN PLOTTING'
Vishinsky protested that the
United States was plotting a "noto
rious" new organization which
would "clutch to itself" the duties
of the 11-nation Security Council,
where the veto prevails. He charged
but an "empty shell," despite the
fact that the UN charter envisioned
the Council as the chief guardian
of the peace.
He called ihe American proposal
a "farce" which would be laughed
off (he floor except for the strong
discipline of diplomatic courtesy.
