# 'FARM STUDENTS PROMISED --BUT HAVEN'T DELIVERED'
## Shaw Blasts Rich Drives No Money Sent To Naples School 
### 
Stanford University has yet, to
send a "red cent" of relief to the
University of Naples — the Italian
school which it? lIR adopted as its
student service stepchild last spring,
Molly Shaw, SIRO co-chairman,
disclosed last night.
llR—the Institute of International
Relations —is the executive board
controlling all of Stanford Univei
sity's student'international activity.
"It is getting the all-too-conven
tional stepchild treatment," Miss
Shaw said. "While the richer, more
publicized charities have a wide
range of support, the University oT
Naples and the WSSF — through
which we adopted them —is sup
ported solely by students.
"We had hoped to get an indi
vidual drive for the WSSF and the
U. of N. but it looks as if tins 1.
impossible in view of the traditional
all-in-one fall campaign for Four
Feathers.
"But we definitely committed
ourselves through WSSF to help the
University of Naples when the In
ternational Institute passed on it
spring quarter.
CONFERENCE USEFUL
"I just returned from a regional
WSSF conference at Marin JC," she
said. "It was informative and use
ful. They are willing to go all out
and help us with our drive, but wr
have to reciprocate in our WSSF
project—Naples.
"They provided us with 'how to
answer questions while canvassing"
booklets, organizational hints, dis
cussion methods, publicity sugges
tions, a motion picture—'Seeds of
Destiny'—and even leaflets to drop
from planes.
"University of Naples may get a
share of the Four Feathers drive,
but it might only be half a feather.
They need help now—badly.
STUDENTS NEED SUPPORT
"They have four times their nor -
mal enrollment, and 30 per cent of
the students—who can't find jobs,
what with more than 2,000,000 un
employed in the immediate area
depend completely on the Univer
sity for support.
"Stanford can't save the world,
but wo havp an obligation to it and
it starts with Stanford's own pet
project, the University of Naples.

Stanford University has yet, to
send a "red cent" of relief to the
University of Naples — the Italian
school which it? lIR adopted as its
student service stepchild last spring,
Molly Shaw, SIRO co-chairman,
disclosed last night.
llR—the Institute of International
Relations —is the executive board
controlling all of Stanford Univei
sity's student'international activity.
"It is getting the all-too-conven
tional stepchild treatment," Miss
Shaw said. "While the richer, more
publicized charities have a wide
range of support, the University oT
Naples and the WSSF — through
which we adopted them —is sup
ported solely by students.
"We had hoped to get an indi
vidual drive for the WSSF and the
U. of N. but it looks as if tins 1.
impossible in view of the traditional
all-in-one fall campaign for Four
Feathers.
"But we definitely committed
ourselves through WSSF to help the
University of Naples when the In
ternational Institute passed on it
spring quarter.
CONFERENCE USEFUL
"I just returned from a regional
WSSF conference at Marin JC," she
said. "It was informative and use
