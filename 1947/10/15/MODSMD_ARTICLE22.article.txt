# Village Traffic Headaches Plague Local Police

### JACK COLEMAN 
"The situation is bad!"
Dwight B. Adams, Village direc
tor, was referring to traffic problems
neated by Stanford Village.
A year ago, with about 1,400 per
sons and 550 automobiles concen
trated within the two gates of a for
mer Army hospital, the problem
was acute. This year there are
over <2,600 persons with more than
HOO cars.
At the crux of the problem is the
absence of a traffic signal at El
â€¢ < 'amino Heal and Ravenswood Ave
nue, better known as the Standard '
Station corner, Adams said.
I I- ( AMINO BOTTLENECK
From 7:30 to 9 every morning
ihere is usually a line of automo
biles on Ravenswood extending
from El Camino across the railroad

tracks. Except for about an hour
every day when an officer directs
traffic, each driver must pry into the
El Camino traffic.
In an attempt to partially allevi
ate this condition, the Menlo Park
police department began to station
two officers on Ravenswood Avenue
late last year to direct cars onto El
Camino and keep them off the rail
road tracks.
"But," points out Adams, "the
Menlo police cannot afford to have
officers posted there continuously."
Village officials have been urging
wide use of the Middlefield Road
gate to help relieve the "El Camino
cramp."
In 1946, before the opening of the
Village, Stanford University officials
anticipated the need for a traffic
signal and, according to Adams, sub

mitted a request to the l\jenlo Park I
police department. Because El Ca
mino is a state highway, the request
was turned over by Police Chief J.
O. Yount to the State Highway De
partment, which in turn dispatched
engineers to investigate the need.
"After about a year of survey,"
states Adams, "they reported that
there are other places in California
in more dire need of traffic signals,
and due to the expense and short
age of materials it will be necessary
for the Village to wait until some
time in 1948.
STATE PASSES BUCK
The University had appropriated
$"{,OOO, which according to Chief
Yount is one-third of the state's es
timate of the cost of a traffic light.
The entire cost of a traffic signal on
a state highway is supposed to be

the state's financial burden, Adams
said. Meanwhile Menlo police and
the Village are forced to maintain
an expense which is actually the
state's arid from which inadequate
results are obtained.
The Highway Department's sur
vey, conducted on Dec. 11, 1946, was
unfortunately made on an unrepre
sentative day because it was during
finals week when traffic distribution
according to hour was abnormal and
to day abnormally light. However,
the Highway Department agreed
there was a definite need for a
traffic signal.
There is the train menace, not
only during morning and noon rush
hours and when there are lines of
automobiles, but also during the
winter months when there are
heavy fogs: Adams and Chief Yount

have urged the railroad company to
erect traffic gates at the Ravens
wood crossing, and a plan is now
under study by Menlo Park, Palo
Alto, the State Highway Depart
ment, and railroad company engi
neers to construct an underpass in
the vicinity of Cambridge Avenue
connecting Willow Road with El
Camino Real. Under this plan the
Alma Street crossing would be elim
inated.
"If Willow Road were made to go
all the way through, heavy traffic
would be taken from the El Camino
and Ravenswood intersection and
from University Avenue," asserts
Chief Yount.
As for financing the project, Chief
Yount believes an arrangement is
being attempted whereby Menlo
Park, Palo Alto, the railroad, and

| the State Highway Department
' would share expenses in varying
proportions.
CHILDREN A PROBLEM
"Besides the tremendous increase
in the number of cars over last year,
there are more than 300 children in
the Village between the ages ol one
and two. This demands extra cau
tion on the part of students," Adams
warned.
"Fortunately, there have been no
accidents yet," he continued, "but we
can't rest on our laurels. The trial
is yet ahead of us."
"My main concern is holding
speed down on the highway." said
Chief Yount emphatically, citing the
wreck last month on El Camino
near Marquard's in which two per
sons were killed, as an an example
of his problem.
