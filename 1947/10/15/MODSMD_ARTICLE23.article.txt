Yuli and Rod Rogaway can do
each other some good.
Rod is the new chairman of NSA
National Students' Association —
: l Stanford. He has three main
projects scheduled this quarter.

And he needs some manpower.
One on Rod's list is the student
union.
"Through the aid of NSA's na
tional chapter a campus committee
will make a definitive survey of the
problem, solutions at other colleges,
and Stanford needs. Then we hope
| to come up with two or three al

' practical and workable—to put be
j fore Excom," said Rod.

"If you are interested in getting
I a new student union for Stanford
i here is a chance to be of help ac-
I tively and constructively," he said.
Number two on Rod's list is a
J "great issues" course. "It is a sort of
i contemporary world affairs arrange
ment which would cut across de
partmental lines and encompass
technology, economics, politics, and
so forth. The committee is going to

work with the School of Education
on this. Dartmouth now has such a
course," he went on to say.
Number three for NSA this quar
ter is a local investigation of the
privilege card plan.
TRAVEL PLAN
This plan, if it goes into effect na
tionally, will enable students to
travel overseas at greatly reduced
rates by purchase of a dollar card
from NSA.
During summer quarter the NSA
office in the Union was appropriated
by another ASSU group. Since it
has no headquarters, interested stu
dents are requested to leave their
names and phone numbers in the
ASSU office in the Old Union. Rod
will get in touch with thein.
