NEW YORK, Oct. 14 (UP).—Win
ston Churchill said tonight that So
viet Russia and its satellites may
withdraw from the United Nations
—thereby creating two worlds—but
that such a split need not lead to
war.
The former British Prime .Minis

"world" wants peace, war will not
result from this withdrawal which
may come "at some moment or
other."
Churchill said, in effect, that Rus

be a good thing because then both
sides would know exactly where
they stood.
