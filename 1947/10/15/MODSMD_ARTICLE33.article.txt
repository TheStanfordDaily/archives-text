A Popular Fall Sport Is Here Again;
If« Open Season on College Coaehes
Oil up the shootin' irons, brother malcontents. Unleash the hounds.
It's fall again, and that great outdoor sport—the annual open season on
college football coaches—has rolled around once more.
From all reports the hunting should be excellent this year. There
seems to be a superabundance of vulnerable targets, and you won't even
have to tramp around in the thorny underbrush to find them.
Just grab yourself a grandstand perch at one of the nearby college
.stadiums some Saturday. Run your telescopic sight along the players'
bench of the losing team, set your crosshairs on the most harassed
looking individual in View, and blast away with both barrels.
It's easy.
there's just one safety precaution, however, that you should remem
ber to observe. Be sure you pull the trigger on the defeated team's coach.
Don't make the fatal mistake of taking a potshot at a victorious mentor.
He may look every bit as worried as his unlucky rival, but he is not
legal game.
Winning coaches are protected by an unwritten law which specifically
states that they can do no wrong—as long as they continue to produce a
satisfying percentage of triumphs.
Of course, as soon as they have tasted defeat two or three times in a
row, the statute no longer applies.
One nice thing about this sport. There doesn't seem to be any sort, of
stigma attached to the hunter who succeeds in bagging his quarry.
A Convenient Target Is at Hand
The coach is the obvious, conspicuous targot. If he can't manage to
come up with a winner, it's his fault primarily. Anyway, that s the way
a great many trigger-happy arm-chair strategists figure. And they can
point to the University of California as proof of their theory.
Didn't the Bears stage a remarkable comeback this year, under a
new coach, with practically the same roster that couldn't win for losing
in 1946?
The simple substitution of Lynn Waldorf for Frank Wickhorst in Cal's
coaching line-up wrought the miracle, supposedly. And incidentally, poor
Mr. Wickhorst is generally listed as the prize "kill" of last year's hunt
in these parts.
This season's high-priority object of critical "buckshot" on the West
Coast appears to be St. Mary's head coach, Jimmy Phelan. As far as we
know, no one has yet demanded Phelan's scalp. But the day may not
be far off.
Give Bob Fitzgerald, sports editor of the St. Mary's Collegian, the
dubious credit of having unleashed the first barrage.
He wrote a sizzling editorial the other day for the Collegian, charging
in effect that Phelan is teaching outmoded football, and advocating that the
Gaels go back to the rough, bruising type of play which characterized
St. Mary's teams back in the days of Slip Madigan.
Now, it seems to us that Phelan's record in his present job is cer
tainly nothing for him to be ashamed of. In 1945 and 1946 his "Whiz
Kids" lost only three regular games, and were honored with Bowl bids
each season. .
Phelan's Team Riins into Trouble
This year the Gaels have been meeting with stiffer opposition all along
the line. They won their first two starts, trouncing Portland University
26 to 13, and running over the University of Hawaii, 27 to 7.
But then the tide began to run out. Cal buried Phelan's charges un
der a 45 to 6 deluge, and the University of Washington beat them last
Saturday, 26 to 6.
That made it two defeats in a row, and Jimmy Phelan was therewith
proclaimed legal game.
Phelan is not the only target of attack. Ralph "Pest" Welch, who
succeeded him a few years ago at the University of Washington, has also
been "flushed" out into the open.
Huskie fans are not at all satisfied with their team's showing, and
they are beginning to blend voices in the all-too-familiar "Blame the
coach" refrain.
The season is still young. Phelan and Welch have already been placed
in jeopardy, and there's no telling how many more coaches will join them
during the course of the 1947 campaign.
Yes, indeed, it looks like a banner year.
Good hunting, men!
And please accept a well-meant word of advice. Be sure to wear
your red cap if you decide to ride along with the chase. You wouldn't
want to be mistaken for a coach.
The results might be fatal.
