Stanford's freshman football team
entrains for Los Angeles this week
to meet the highly touted U.S.C.
Trobabes. The contest will precede
the Trojan-Oregon State battle in
the Coliseum Saturday afternoon.
Freshman Coach Chuck Taylor is
pleased with the steady improve
ment shown by his charges during
the past two weeks. Recent prac
tices have stressed protection for
passers, in an effort to smooth out
rough spots in the already potent
papoose aerial attack, which features
quarterbacks Tom Shaw and Wayne
Buck tossing to four rangy ends,
Tom August, Bob Scott, Dick
Schulze, and Tom Vasilatos.
Among the 33 squadsmen who will
make the trip, all are in top condi
tion except Gordon White, hefty
regular tackle, and Ken La Crose,
speedy reserve halfback. It is doubt
ful whether either will be able to
play much in the U.S.C. fray. John
Poulson has been moved over to left
tackle to fill in for the injured White.
