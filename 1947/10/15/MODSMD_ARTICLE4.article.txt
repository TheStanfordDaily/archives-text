TABRIZ, Iran, Oct. 14 (UP).â€”The
jittery Iranian government, fearful
of a Soviet-inspired revolt in oil
rich Azerbaijan, has removed thou
sands of suspected Communists to
southern Iran to prevent formation
of a fifth column, police disclosed
today.
Scores have been arrested each
day and held temporarily behind a
10-foot, mud wall at Haj Feraj Gar
dens under guard until a six-man
tribunal decides whether they are
guilty of attempting to undermine
the government.
