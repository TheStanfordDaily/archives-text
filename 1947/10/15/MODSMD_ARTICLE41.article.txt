# Indians Work Hard for Bruins
## 
### 
Coach Marchie Schwartz sent his
Stanford gridders through their sec
ond straight day of scrimmage yes
j terday afternoon, in preparation for
the Indians' second conference game
of the season against the UCLA
Bruins this weekend.
While the rock-'em, sock-'em play
continued on the local practice fields,
| UCLA tub-thumpers and Los An
geles sports writers in general con
tinue to look upon the Indian-Bruin
game as something much easier than
a breather for the Uclans.
Frank Finch, sportswriter for the
Los Angeles Times, comments:
"It's just a coincidence that the
Bruins are getting out of town this
week while the Trojans are moving
back in. It's not that the Biuins
are afraid of their cross-town pals,
but they have to go up to Palo Alto
to play what has been tentatively
identified as Stanford's football
team."
Finch continues:
"If the Uclans have a breather on
their nine-game schedule, this is it.
Marchie Schwartz's Indians haven't
been able to buy a victory this year,
bowing to Idaho 19-16, Michigan 49-
13, and Santa Clara 13-7."'
HOISCH IN. FEARS OUT
Reports from the City of the An
gels state that Jerry Shipkey, Bruin
fullback, who was held out of the
Oregon game' because of a bad

thumb, will be ready to roll against
the Cards.
And A 1 Hoisch, who led (he UCLA
offense in their 24-7 rout of the Ore
gon Ducks with an eleven yard aver
age for 10 tries, is in tip-top condi
tion.
But despite the unbounded optim
ism raging in the South, Coach Bert
La Brucherie sent his Bruins
through a rugged scrimmage yester
day. And it was announced from
Bruin headquarters that stellar end

Tom Fears will definitely be out of
the Stanford game with a shoulder
reparation.
LINEUP UNCERTAIN
Coach Schwartz is still not set on
his starting lineup for this coming
Saturday, but will depend on the
showings in the contact work this
week.
Neither Mickie Titus nor George
Quist, injured Farm right halfbacks,
suited up for yesterday's practice
session.

the Indians' second conference game
of the season against the UCLA
Bruins this weekend.
While the rock-'em, sock-'em play
continued on the local practice fields,
| UCLA tub-thumpers and Los An
geles sports writers in general con
tinue to look upon the Indian-Bruin
game as something much easier than
a breather for the Uclans.
Frank Finch, sportswriter for the
Los Angeles Times, comments:
"It's just a coincidence that the
Bruins are getting out of town this
week while the Trojans are moving
back in. It's not that the Biuins
are afraid of their cross-town pals,
but they have to go up to Palo Alto
to play what has been tentatively
identified as Stanford's football
team."
Finch continues:
"If the Uclans have a breather on
their nine-game schedule, this is it.
Marchie Schwartz's Indians haven't
been able to buy a victory this year,
bowing to Idaho 19-16, Michigan 49-
13, and Santa Clara 13-7."'
HOISCH IN. FEARS OUT
Reports from the City of the An
gels state that Jerry Shipkey, Bruin
fullback, who was held out of the
Oregon game' because of a bad

thumb, will be ready to roll against
the Cards.
And A 1 Hoisch, who led (he UCLA
offense in their 24-7 rout of the Ore
gon Ducks with an eleven yard aver
age for 10 tries, is in tip-top condi
tion.
But despite the unbounded optim
ism raging in the South, Coach Bert
La Brucherie sent his Bruins
through a rugged scrimmage yester
day. And it was announced from
Bruin headquarters that stellar end

Tom Fears will definitely be out of
the Stanford game with a shoulder
reparation.
LINEUP UNCERTAIN
Coach Schwartz is still not set on
his starting lineup for this coming
Saturday, but will depend on the
showings in the contact work this
week.
Neither Mickie Titus nor George
Quist, injured Farm right halfbacks,
suited up for yesterday's practice
session.
