This week The Daily is running a series of
articles on the NSA (National Students' Asso
ciation).
A constitution which was drawn up by the
association this summer at a convention at
the University of Wisconsin will come up for
approval before Excom soon—probably next
Wednesday night.
All members of Excom have already re
ceived mimeographed copies of the constitu
tion from NSA members on campus. An at
tempt has been made to see that Excom will
be well-informed on the subject before voting.
The constitution of any organization which
is to be recognized by the ASSU must be ap
proved by Excom. As NSA is a national or
ganization rather than just a campus group
its constitution will naturally fall under care
ful surveillance.
The four Stanford students who attended the

convention in Madison are enthusiastic about
NSA. They believe that Stanford should be
represented in the organization.
Later this month a regional meeting of NSA
representatives will be held at Stanford.
The articles in The Daily will cover the work
of NSA on the Stanford campus prior to this
quarter, the reaction of the Stanford delegates
to the Wisconsin convention, the plans the
local NSA group has for the future, and a
general summary of the NSA program.
These articles have not been written in an
effort to "sell" NSA to the campus nor to
oppose its entry into Stanford. They have
been written with the goal in mind of inform
ing the student body of NSA.
The Daily hopes that this series will aid
Stanford in identifying NSA by its program
rather than just by its initials.
