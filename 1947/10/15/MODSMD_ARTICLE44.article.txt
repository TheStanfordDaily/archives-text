### WAYNE SARGENT 
It took me two hours Saturday to get from the
game to Rickey's Studio Club. That's longer than it
look the Indians to make a first down. That's a long
time to spend getting to a drink and organ music.
In that traffic, I needed both by the time I got there.
You can't trust these California drivers any fur
ther than you can nudge the Normandy.
I trusted one yellow convertible, and I got side
swiped. I saw his two-tone car today—yellow body
and black fenders—my fenders. You know what a
convertible is—that's a $15000 tent with a girl under
it. It's a combination topless body, gutless driver,
and a finance company.
Of course, I've got three bumpers, counting his.
Walking is a possible solution, but it makes
me as nervous as a pregnant fox in a forest fire. The
only time a pedestrian has the right of way in Cali
fornia is after the ambulance picks him up.
I read about a Scotchman who got his by a local
motorist. As the car bore down on him, he rolled
over on his side so they could bury him with a crease

in his pants. Like the dead bird dog, that story has
no point, but is printed by the request of a friend
of mine who is half Scotch. The other half is soda
with a twist of lemon.
And speaking of drinking while motoring I heard
a story about three Stanford roughs who went into a
bar for a drink. (Don't stop me if you've heard this
one—l want to hear it again myself.)
Says the first rough, slapping the bar:
"Gimme a straight coke."
Says the second he-man:
"Gimme a straight coke."
Says the third:
"Make mine milk, I'm driving."
I don't say that California drivers are dumb,
though. On the contrary, they are very motor
minded. They probably have more brains per square
head than any place in the country. I just wish
they didn't try to prove it.
What this country needs, besides a ten cent beer,
is more defenders, and fewer bent ones.

it. It's a combination topless body, gutless driver,
and a finance company.
Of course, I've got three bumpers, counting his.
Walking is a possible solution, but it makes
me as nervous as a pregnant fox in a forest fire. The
only time a pedestrian has the right of way in Cali
fornia is after the ambulance picks him up.
I read about a Scotchman who got his by a local
motorist. As the car bore down on him, he rolled
over on his side so they could bury him with a crease

in his pants. Like the dead bird dog, that story has
no point, but is printed by the request of a friend
of mine who is half Scotch. The other half is soda
with a twist of lemon.
And speaking of drinking while motoring I heard
a story about three Stanford roughs who went into a
bar for a drink. (Don't stop me if you've heard this
one—l want to hear it again myself.)
Says the first rough, slapping the bar:
"Gimme a straight coke."
Says the second he-man:
"Gimme a straight coke."
Says the third:
"Make mine milk, I'm driving."
I don't say that California drivers are dumb,
though. On the contrary, they are very motor
minded. They probably have more brains per square
head than any place in the country. I just wish
they didn't try to prove it.
What this country needs, besides a ten cent beer,
is more defenders, and fewer bent ones.
