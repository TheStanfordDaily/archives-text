In (he column '"History 1947" on Oct. 10 Allen
Bletz offered us this advice, "For the present we can
only sit tight and hope that the UN can meet its
task successfully." There could be no easier way to
insure another war than this policy of drifting. Con
trary to Mr. Bletz's assumption, the UN has not been
given the power to achieve peace, as it has well dem
onstrated by its past record. The UN as it is pres
ently constituted has proven that it is incapable of
stopping conflict; so the course that we, as citizens
of America, must take, is to call on our government
to assume the lead in constructing something that
will work.
The United Nations is the foundation, but no more,
of an effective international organization. While we
cannot expect a foundation to keep out the rain,
it would be foolhardy to rip it up; rather we must add
to it. In other words we must strengthen the UN by
turning it into a limited federal world government
with powers adequate to prevent war.
In our own nation we recognize that law nec
essitates government to enact, interpret, and enforce
that law. The same truth applies to international
relations. If we want international law we must have
World Government.
To achieve this goal we must act, not sit! There
are resolutions in Congress advocating strengthening
the UN (Senate Concurrent Resolutions Nos. 23 and
24; House Concurrent Resolutions 59 to G8 inclusive)
which should be supported by letters; there is a great
job of education to be carried out (43 percent of the
American people, according to a Gallup poll, do not
know what the veto power is), and there is public
opinion which must be mobilized. This is a job that
must be accomplished, and accomplished as rapidly
as possible, since every passing day widens the rift
between the United States and Russia. The first
and second world wars could have been prevented,
but not as late as 1913 and 1938. The shape of events
had been cast a decade before. If we are to prevent
World War 111, we must act now! The future belongs
only to those who prepare for it.

essitates government to enact, interpret, and enforce
that law. The same truth applies to international
relations. If we want international law we must have
World Government.
To achieve this goal we must act, not sit! There
are resolutions in Congress advocating strengthening
the UN (Senate Concurrent Resolutions Nos. 23 and
24; House Concurrent Resolutions 59 to G8 inclusive)
which should be supported by letters; there is a great
job of education to be carried out (43 percent of the
American people, according to a Gallup poll, do not
know what the veto power is), and there is public
opinion which must be mobilized. This is a job that
must be accomplished, and accomplished as rapidly
as possible, since every passing day widens the rift
between the United States and Russia. The first
and second world wars could have been prevented,
but not as late as 1913 and 1938. The shape of events
had been cast a decade before. If we are to prevent
World War 111, we must act now! The future belongs
only to those who prepare for it.

To (ho Editor:
In (he column '"History 1947" on Oct. 10 Allen
Bletz offered us this advice, "For the present we can
only sit tight and hope that the UN can meet its
task successfully." There could be no easier way to
insure another war than this policy of drifting. Con
trary to Mr. Bletz's assumption, the UN has not been
given the power to achieve peace, as it has well dem
onstrated by its past record. The UN as it is pres
ently constituted has proven that it is incapable of
stopping conflict; so the course that we, as citizens
of America, must take, is to call on our government
to assume the lead in constructing something that
will work.
The United Nations is the foundation, but no more,
of an effective international organization. While we
cannot expect a foundation to keep out the rain,
it would be foolhardy to rip it up; rather we must add
to it. In other words we must strengthen the UN by
turning it into a limited federal world government
with powers adequate to prevent war.
In our own nation we recognize that law nec
essitates government to enact, interpret, and enforce
that law. The same truth applies to international
relations. If we want international law we must have
World Government.
