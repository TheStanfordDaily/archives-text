To the Editor:
The controversy between George Brunn and Jack
MiddlekaufT in "History, 1947" and "Campus Opin
ion" is a shining example of one thing: the current
wave of anti-communist hysteria is not merely di
rected at the communists, but at all liberals who
dare to disagree with American foreign policy.
Hitler used the red bogey to further his influence.
Now America is the one who wants to "save the
world from communism"â€”which we are doing by
pursuing an imperialistic policy and giving aid to
fascist countries. Anyone who does not like this
method is a "red." In spite of Mr. Brunn's denun
ciation of Communists, I doubt whether he could
hold a State Department job very long. Who knows?
Stanford might get the F. 8.1, on its neck one of these
days because of the subversive lines in "Come Join
the Band":
"Each loyal comrade brave and true,
With might and main
Sing the refrain
Forever and forever'SLanford Red."
