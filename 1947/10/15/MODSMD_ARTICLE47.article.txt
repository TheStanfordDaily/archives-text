To the Editor:
"Mystery cloaks woman's nature anyway. So
why not make moment of it."
Though we are not exactly certain wh;it Miss
Ivimber is trying to prove by this statement, her
general idea seems to be that woman should pro
ceed to the next step and cloak not only her nature
but also her form in mystery, to be accomplished by
hiding inside something akin to a large, ground
sweeping sack, complete with padding and inches

alternately arranged in theoretically strategic por
tions. This is supposed to make her "enticing," is it.'
The net result anyway, and apparently the great end
so ardently desired, is to make woman's silhouette
as seen on the beach, clad in a bathing suit, as re
mote as possible from the same woman's silhouette
when dressed for town and the Farm. Sort of a
female zoot suit.
Ah well, perhaps we can get a lot of studying
in between now and spring when, it is to be hoped,
the caterpillars will turn into butterflies and once
more issue forth from their ugly little cocoons.
