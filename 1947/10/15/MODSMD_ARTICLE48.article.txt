To the editor:
I sincerely admire the broadmindedness in the
letter of Mr. Brunn in the Oct. 9th Daily. What is
strange is that such broadmindedness hardly seems
to square with the broad generalizations that the
author has been making these last days. In his first
statement he branded Turkey, my country, as "not
democratic by the largest stretch of the imagina
tion." In his second one he implied that there ex
isted in Turkey "a sovereignty of tyrants." To say
that this is simply not true is most difficult on a
campus on which students have the habit of asking
you whether the Turkish language is the same as
Arabic, whether Turks dress like Europeans, and
whether Turkish is written from right to left.
Understanding each other presupposes a know
ledge of certain facts common to both parties en
gaged in a conversation of discussion. I am afraid
that the author does not possess tliis kind of know
ledge or he would have known the fact that Turkey
has passed in the last thirty years from the stage
of an absolute monarchy to that of a republic with
a single party at first, and subsequently to that of
a republic with two active parties. He would also
appreciate the fact that about a month ago a cab
inet representing the majority party (with 2(50 seats
in the Turkish national assembly) was forced to
resign by parliamentary pressure brought about by
the Turkish Democratic Party (with only (50 seats).
The fall of this cabinet was brought about partly
by the excellent organization of the opposition party,
and partly by the fact that many members of the
party in power, prompted by public opinion, had
voted against the cabinet on a vote of confidence.
One of the less relative measures of democracy
today is that of the freedom of the press. There are
few countries in which as much criticism of the
government is to be found as in the Turkish press.
I am ready to present documentary proof of this to
anybody who would be interested in the subject.
At this point I would like to quote a member of
the American Investigation commissions working on
the Marshall plan. The commission headed by Sen
ator Alexander Smith (Rep.) of New Jersey and
Representative Mundt (Rep.) of South Dakota ar
rived in Istanbul recently. In a press conference on
Oct. 2 Mr. Mundt said:
"I have attentively followed happenings in Tur
key since my last visit to that country in 1945. It
has been a pleasure to report both in England and
the U.S. on the impressions that I have received as a
result of this interest. The country that comes the
nearest to having a two party system in Europe is
Turkey. When I made my impressions known in
such capitals as Paris and Oslo a few people were
amazed and some refused to believe me. Today this
still remains my personal conviction based on my
special interest in Turkey and my investigations in
this field."
That mistakes have been committed by the Turk
ish government in the last twenty years I freely
admit, and it is probably because the author of
"History 1947" has not kept abreast of recent changes
in Turkey that he has come to his odd conclusion
concerning the Turkish government but this is not
an excuse for making hasty generalizations without
any factual basis.

appreciate the fact that about a month ago a cab
inet representing the majority party (with 2(50 seats
in the Turkish national assembly) was forced to
resign by parliamentary pressure brought about by
the Turkish Democratic Party (with only (50 seats).
The fall of this cabinet was brought about partly
by the excellent organization of the opposition party,
and partly by the fact that many members of the
party in power, prompted by public opinion, had
voted against the cabinet on a vote of confidence.
One of the less relative measures of democracy
today is that of the freedom of the press. There are
few countries in which as much criticism of the
government is to be found as in the Turkish press.
I am ready to present documentary proof of this to
anybody who would be interested in the subject.
At this point I would like to quote a member of
the American Investigation commissions working on
the Marshall plan. The commission headed by Sen
ator Alexander Smith (Rep.) of New Jersey and
Representative Mundt (Rep.) of South Dakota ar
rived in Istanbul recently. In a press conference on
Oct. 2 Mr. Mundt said:
"I have attentively followed happenings in Tur
key since my last visit to that country in 1945. It
has been a pleasure to report both in England and
the U.S. on the impressions that I have received as a
result of this interest. The country that comes the
nearest to having a two party system in Europe is
Turkey. When I made my impressions known in
such capitals as Paris and Oslo a few people were
amazed and some refused to believe me. Today this
still remains my personal conviction based on my
special interest in Turkey and my investigations in
this field."
That mistakes have been committed by the Turk
ish government in the last twenty years I freely
admit, and it is probably because the author of
"History 1947" has not kept abreast of recent changes
in Turkey that he has come to his odd conclusion
concerning the Turkish government but this is not
an excuse for making hasty generalizations without
any factual basis.

To the editor:
I sincerely admire the broadmindedness in the
letter of Mr. Brunn in the Oct. 9th Daily. What is
strange is that such broadmindedness hardly seems
to square with the broad generalizations that the
author has been making these last days. In his first
statement he branded Turkey, my country, as "not
democratic by the largest stretch of the imagina
tion." In his second one he implied that there ex
isted in Turkey "a sovereignty of tyrants." To say
that this is simply not true is most difficult on a
campus on which students have the habit of asking
you whether the Turkish language is the same as
Arabic, whether Turks dress like Europeans, and
whether Turkish is written from right to left.
Understanding each other presupposes a know
ledge of certain facts common to both parties en
gaged in a conversation of discussion. I am afraid
that the author does not possess tliis kind of know
ledge or he would have known the fact that Turkey
has passed in the last thirty years from the stage
of an absolute monarchy to that of a republic with
a single party at first, and subsequently to that of
a republic with two active parties. He would also
appreciate the fact that about a month ago a cab
inet representing the majority party (with 2(50 seats
in the Turkish national assembly) was forced to
resign by parliamentary pressure brought about by
