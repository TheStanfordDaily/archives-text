# Indian Girl Rejects Western 'New Look'
## 
### 
While the American girls are still
wavering between the old and the
"new look," Medha Yodh is not im
pressed by either of them. Dressed
in a green beige, hand-woven silk
sari, the first Indian girl to attend
Stanford told us that she "intends
to stick to the Indian dress." "West
ern dress is not temperamentally
and culturally suited to the Indian
temperament," she added.
Miss Yodh, a small and beautiful
maiden of 20, hails from Bombay
where she graduated in chemistry
from the Royal Institute of Science.
"How do you feel at a coeducational
institution like Stanford?" we asked
her.
Waving her bangled arm rather
impatiently, she said, "That is noth
ing new to me. From my grammar
school to my college, I have gone to
mixed schools."
"As a matter of fact, most of the
colleges in Bombay are coeduca
tional," she added.
WILL SERVE INDIA
A graduate student of biochemis
try at Stanford, the ambition of Miss
Yodh is to serve India, which ac
cording to her is in great need of
scientific personnel. She intends to
follow her scientific career as a re
search or educational worker even
after her marriage.
When informed of the great
American interest in the red, round
thing she and other Indian women
wear on their foreheads, she told us
that "it is merely a traditional
beauty mark which goes well with
the Indian dress."
"There is a great misunderstand
ing here that it is a caste mark; that
is entirely wrong," she added. She
explained to us that in India it is
called "tikki" or "bindi" and is
something like nail polish.
WOMEN NOT GLAMOROUS
"You know," she confided in us,
"when I was in India, I used to
think after reading American maga
zines like 'Life' that American
women are very glamorous and
sophisticated. But I was surprised
to find that they are not like that
but are just like common people
anywhere else in the world."
"What about politics?" we asked.
Miss Yodh smiled and waved her
hand. "I am not too interested in
politics. But you may put me down
as a liberal or progressive," she re
plied.
Miss Yodh is a very accomplished
Indian dancer and singer, and plans
to study some modern dancing at
Stanford. After seeing a friendly
dance performance by her recently,
we can say that Stanford will get a
pleasant surprise whenever she
agrees to give a public performance.
We also gathered from talking with
her that it will not be too difficult
to persuade her.
NO DATING LIKE US
"Dating!" she exclaimed when
that question was asked. "We don't
have the American sort of dating in
India, for our culture is entirely dif
ferent."
"Of course, boys and girls go out,
but in an entirely different fash
ion," she added.
This brought in the question of
sex appeal. "How do Indian girls
manage to 'sex-appeal' men when
they are so much wrapped up in
their dress?" we asked.
"Sex appeal, as you call it, does
not play an important part in our
social life," Miss Yodh replied. "And
you should know that," she said
laughingly.
Miss Yodh at present is living at
the Village with another delightful
foreigner, Ruth Friedlander, an
Austrian student studying medicine
at Stanford.

sari, the first Indian girl to attend
Stanford told us that she "intends
to stick to the Indian dress." "West
ern dress is not temperamentally
and culturally suited to the Indian
temperament," she added.
Miss Yodh, a small and beautiful
maiden of 20, hails from Bombay
where she graduated in chemistry
from the Royal Institute of Science.
"How do you feel at a coeducational
institution like Stanford?" we asked
her.
Waving her bangled arm rather
impatiently, she said, "That is noth
ing new to me. From my grammar
school to my college, I have gone to
mixed schools."
"As a matter of fact, most of the
colleges in Bombay are coeduca
tional," she added.
WILL SERVE INDIA
A graduate student of biochemis
try at Stanford, the ambition of Miss
Yodh is to serve India, which ac
cording to her is in great need of
scientific personnel. She intends to
follow her scientific career as a re
search or educational worker even
after her marriage.
When informed of the great
American interest in the red, round
thing she and other Indian women
wear on their foreheads, she told us
that "it is merely a traditional
beauty mark which goes well with
the Indian dress."
"There is a great misunderstand
ing here that it is a caste mark; that
is entirely wrong," she added. She
explained to us that in India it is
called "tikki" or "bindi" and is
something like nail polish.
WOMEN NOT GLAMOROUS
"You know," she confided in us,
"when I was in India, I used to
think after reading American maga
zines like 'Life' that American
women are very glamorous and
sophisticated. But I was surprised
to find that they are not like that
but are just like common people
anywhere else in the world."
"What about politics?" we asked.
Miss Yodh smiled and waved her
hand. "I am not too interested in
politics. But you may put me down
as a liberal or progressive," she re
plied.
Miss Yodh is a very accomplished
Indian dancer and singer, and plans
to study some modern dancing at
Stanford. After seeing a friendly
dance performance by her recently,
we can say that Stanford will get a
pleasant surprise whenever she
agrees to give a public performance.
We also gathered from talking with
her that it will not be too difficult
to persuade her.
NO DATING LIKE US
"Dating!" she exclaimed when
that question was asked. "We don't
have the American sort of dating in
India, for our culture is entirely dif
ferent."
"Of course, boys and girls go out,
but in an entirely different fash
ion," she added.
This brought in the question of
sex appeal. "How do Indian girls
manage to 'sex-appeal' men when
they are so much wrapped up in
their dress?" we asked.
"Sex appeal, as you call it, does
not play an important part in our
social life," Miss Yodh replied. "And
you should know that," she said
laughingly.
Miss Yodh at present is living at
the Village with another delightful
foreigner, Ruth Friedlander, an
Austrian student studying medicine
at Stanford.


MEDIIA YODH is the first
Indian girl to attend Stanford.
While the American girls are still
wavering between the old and the
"new look," Medha Yodh is not im
pressed by either of them. Dressed
in a green beige, hand-woven silk
sari, the first Indian girl to attend
Stanford told us that she "intends
to stick to the Indian dress." "West
