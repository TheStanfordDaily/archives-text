# ASSU Secretary Bids Goodbye to Stanford
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
From atop Hoover Library tower,
the landscape is a ragged pattern of
sandstone stucco and tarnished
green, and it meets the eye like a
fresco of tangled spectrums.
This is the view, above all others,
which will be best remembered by
Marjorie Langford when she leaves
campus tonight bound for Anaheim
to begin a career of being an ordi
nary housewife.
Mrs. Langford this morning starts
her "last day" of fulfilling the du
ties as full-time civilian ASSU secre
tary, a span of good fortune which
began last March 13.
HATES LEAVING FARM
She was seated at a desk near an
unused fireplace, a worrisome look
on her face otherwise marring a
brand of friendliness and unassum
ing charm for which she is best
known.
"Honestly, I just hate to leave.
Maybe that's why I'm in such a
sympathetic mood."
The ASSU office, she will tell you,
is a gathering spot for everything
from "an unclaimed hand saw hang
ing forlornly on the side of a locker,"
to a gilded trophy on the mantel
piece, a reminder of the '34 Frosh-
Soph Mud Fight.
"See what I mean," Marge said,
"it's so different here and I could
n't work in any better atmosphere."
There would be no more steno
graphic reports of Excom, and no
more high speed laughter at belated
deliveries of Flash Gordon film ser
ials to the ASSU office.
She leaned forward a bit and rat
tled ofT a synopsis on the whys and
wherefores of the office.
"BANKING HOUSE"
"Really, I don't know where to
start, but I guess you can say the
ASSU office acts as a 'banking
house' for all campus organizations,
except the living groups.
"We sell tickets for student dances,
do a little correspondence, and in

form new students on the traditions
of the Farm."
The University and its seeming
touch of austerity, she points out,
docs impress one at first, but one
soon becomes accustomed to it all.
Walks down Lasuen sidestepping

the rushes between classes, and the
sound of bells tolling the hour of
day throughout the Quad will soon
be lost in the backrush of an item
called memories.
"I'm going home," she said, "but
I'll be back—someday!"

Maybe that's why I'm in such a
sympathetic mood."
The ASSU office, she will tell you,
is a gathering spot for everything
from "an unclaimed hand saw hang
ing forlornly on the side of a locker,"
to a gilded trophy on the mantel
piece, a reminder of the '34 Frosh-
Soph Mud Fight.
"See what I mean," Marge said,
"it's so different here and I could
n't work in any better atmosphere."
There would be no more steno
graphic reports of Excom, and no
more high speed laughter at belated
deliveries of Flash Gordon film ser
ials to the ASSU office.
She leaned forward a bit and rat
tled ofT a synopsis on the whys and
wherefores of the office.
"BANKING HOUSE"
"Really, I don't know where to
start, but I guess you can say the
ASSU office acts as a 'banking
house' for all campus organizations,
except the living groups.
"We sell tickets for student dances,
do a little correspondence, and in

form new students on the traditions
of the Farm."
The University and its seeming
touch of austerity, she points out,
docs impress one at first, but one
soon becomes accustomed to it all.
Walks down Lasuen sidestepping

the rushes between classes, and the
sound of bells tolling the hour of
day throughout the Quad will soon
be lost in the backrush of an item
called memories.
"I'm going home," she said, "but
I'll be back—someday!"
From atop Hoover Library tower,
the landscape is a ragged pattern of
sandstone stucco and tarnished
green, and it meets the eye like a
fresco of tangled spectrums.
This is the view, above all others,
which will be best remembered by
Marjorie Langford when she leaves
campus tonight bound for Anaheim
to begin a career of being an ordi
nary housewife.
Mrs. Langford this morning starts
her "last day" of fulfilling the du
ties as full-time civilian ASSU secre
tary, a span of good fortune which
began last March 13.
HATES LEAVING FARM
She was seated at a desk near an
unused fireplace, a worrisome look
on her face otherwise marring a
brand of friendliness and unassum
ing charm for which she is best
known.
"Honestly, I just hate to leave.
Maybe that's why I'm in such a
sympathetic mood."
