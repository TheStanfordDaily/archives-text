# British Warn Arab Armies

### 
LONDON, Oct. 14 (UP). â€”Great
Britain was reported today to have
warned Arab states that a move to
carry out the Arab League decision
to mass troops along the Palestine
border may have drastic conse
quences.
The Foreign Office revealed that
British representatives "informally"
told the Syrian government that
Britain sharply disapproves Syrian
troop "maneuvers" in the direction
of the Palestine frontier. There were
strong indications here that similar
"advice" had been handed to other
Arab states.
"All the Middle Eastern countries
are now fully aware of our posi
tion," a Foreign Office spokesman
said.
The British action carried an im
plied threat that 100,000 British
troops in the Holy Land would take
ruthless steps to put down any Arab
revolt within the borders of Pales
tine while Britain was still respon
sible for maintenance of order.
Diplomatic sources said Russia's
outright approval of partition was
another blow to Arabs who expect
ed a measure of Soviet support for
their aim of an undivided Arab
state.
Strong British disapproval of
Arab troop movements was regard
ed here as almost certain to quash
effectively Arab plans to ring Pal
estine with troops.
