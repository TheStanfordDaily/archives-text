# More European Aid Urged By Marshall
## 
### 
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 15 (UP).—
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall today made a fresh plea for
emergency economic aid to Europe.
"The basic issue is simply wheth
er or not men are to be left free to
organize their social, political and
economic existence in accordance
with their desires," Marshall said,
"or whether they are to have their
lives arranged and dictated for them
by small groups of men who have
arrogated to themselves this arbi
trary power."
Marshall also advised labor to
light dictatorial regimes because la
bor would be the first victim. "If
labor can be confused or embittered,
if labor can be made to lose faith in
the community of which it forms a
part, then the core of any national
society is threatened. The enemies of
democracy know this; and it ex
plains the efforts they make to un
dermine the confidence of the labor
element in the stability of our in
stitutions and the soundness of our .
traditions."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 UP).—
President and Mrs. Truman have

program, the White House an

Mrs. Edith Helm, the First
Lady's social secretary, told a

of world recovery is production. . . .
The immediate requirements at this
time are food and coal."
Marshall that Europe was
entering a "precarious" winter, and
must "make every possible effort to
reach the production rates" now en
visioned.
He said Europe could not wait for
long - range economic aid to be
worked oul: "There now exists the
urgent necessity for positive interim
measures to prevent a fatal dete
rioration in Europe—political, eco
nomic and psychological."
