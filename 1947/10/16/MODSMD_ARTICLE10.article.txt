# Excom Ban On Political Groups Set
## 
### 
Sotting a definite ASSU policy to
ward "political action" groups, Ex
com last night, after hearing the
views of Dr. Donald B. Tresidder
and Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton, and after vigorous debate
both from the floor and by mem
bers, adopted a resolution stating
that "Excom adopts, as a general
policy, that it will approve no par
tisan political action organizations."
Before Dr. Tresidder and Dean
Kimpton spoke, the meeting was
"closed" to all but Excom members,
and a, large contingent from PCA
(Progressive Citizens of America)
and other interested groups were
asked to leave the room.
The resolution passed by an 8-3
vote and will be a "yardstick" for
the consideration of any political
groups in the future.
A special committee was appoint
ed by Martzloff to meet with the

PCA to determine its status in the
light of the newly adopted Excom
policy. Ted Norton will head the
committee, which will consist of
Jack Rich, Bob Hoyt, and Bob
Brown.
Four appointments to Cardinals
were approved by Excom last night.
The appointments as presented by
Cardinals President Bob Berryman
were: Robert Levison, senior; Diana
Powers, Joe Pickering, and Joe Zu
kin, juniors.
Dates for the freshman class fall
elections were presented by Elec
tion Board Chairman Gordon Ness
and approved by Excom. Nomina
tions for frosh offices will open Oct.
23 and close Oct. 28, with the final
date for declinations Oct. 2fl. The
freshman primary is scheduled for
Nov. 5, with the finals, if necessary,
Nov. 12.
