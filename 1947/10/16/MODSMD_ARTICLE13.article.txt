# Al Masters Urges Walking to Games
## 
### 
For the sake of personal con
venience and courtesy to off-cam
pus visitors, Athletic Director Al
Masters today urged all Stanford
students to leave their cars at
home and walk to football games
on the campus.
"We have less parking space
than ever before," says Masters.
•■'Students will save time and
trouble for themselves and leave
available parking areas for people
who live off the campus if they
will not drive to the games."
