## 
### 
A clash between Stanford and
USC chapters of the National Stu
dents' Association loomed last night
when both delegations announced
their intention to seek control of the
International Commission when the
NSA regional convention starts Oct.
25 on the Stanford campus.
"Stanford certainly deserves to
head the region on the international
level. What other school has done
as much as Stanford and its Insti
tute of International Relations?"
asked Ginny Titus, NSA delegate
and Excom member.
UNIVERSITY HOST
Meanwhile, Rod Rogaway, NSA
chairman at Stanford, together with
student officers and administration
officials, is forming final plans to
host universities from California,
Nevada, and Hawaii.
Miss Titus, while enthusiastic
about Stanford's lIR accomplish
ments, had no praise for its all-over
NSA action.
"This convention will be the time
for Stanford to show whether it is
or is not the class of the West," Miss
Titus said.
"We'll get that International panel
or die trying."
FAST ACTION
"Stanford has got to wake up—
and I don't mean in the general and
hackneyed sense of 'awareness.' I
mean that all the other schools are
ahead of us physically and mate
rially on this NSA and we must
move awfully fast if we want to
make a good showing at this con
ference, much less assume any lead
ership," Miss Titus stated.
Dick Heggie, incumbent regional
chairman from the University of
California, Berkeley, is preparing a
regional constitution for approval
at the conference.
