# New Plans For Football Seating Told
## 
### 
Now plans for entering the sta
dium have been set up by the ath
letic department for Saturday's
game, Dave Heyler, Rally Com co
chairman, said last night.
Under the new plan, men will en
ter through gate I and move along
in front of the bleachers to the
men's section. Women will continue
to enter as before, he said, and as
the Block S has been abandoned,
will sit in a separate section next to
their male cohorts.
CARD STUNTS PLANNED
As card stunts are planned for
half-time, the men's rooting section
must be filled, he emphasized. But
men are now to be given a choice
of seats, governed only by a few
simple rules.
According to Heyler, the men's
section will be divided into two
parts by a rope running up the mid
dle of the section. Men may sit at
any level they wish, but seats must
be filled from the rope out toward
the aisle.

line, Nov. 2',i, 1947: 'Indians Fail
to Present Card Stunts for Big
Game." Don't let this happen to
you. Save those stunt cards.

No seats will be saved, he said,
and rooters should take places di
rectly over the cards, which will be
tacked under the seats. Under the
new plan there should be no "holes"
in the section, but in case of a slip
up, a member of Rally Com should
be notified of vacant seats.
Many of the stunts will be ani
mated, said Heyler, and for this rea
son rooters should remember their
row number. This number appears
on the top of the instruction card.
For the flip card stunts students
should hold the card for the first in
the series up, with the card for the
flip backed to it. Should a third
change occur, the student may slip
the third card in while holding up
the second, he said.
FLIP STUNTS
Heyler promises to announce flip
stunts in advance so rooters will
have a chance to get ready for the
animated stunt. It is planned to
have a better public address system
this week.
When the stunts are over, cards
must be passed to the Rally Com
members in the aisles. "If card
stunts are to be continued at the
games, co-operation in saving the
cards for the next week is neces
sary," he said. After last week's
spontaneous throw over 1,000 cards
were lost.
As a pre-game feature, Rally Com
will pass out megaphones and feath
ers to Stanford roters, said Heyler.

men's section. Women will continue
to enter as before, he said, and as
the Block S has been abandoned,
will sit in a separate section next to
their male cohorts.
CARD STUNTS PLANNED
As card stunts are planned for
half-time, the men's rooting section
must be filled, he emphasized. But
men are now to be given a choice
of seats, governed only by a few
simple rules.
According to Heyler, the men's
section will be divided into two
parts by a rope running up the mid
dle of the section. Men may sit at
any level they wish, but seats must
be filled from the rope out toward
the aisle.

No seats will be saved, he said,
and rooters should take places di
rectly over the cards, which will be
tacked under the seats. Under the
new plan there should be no "holes"
in the section, but in case of a slip
up, a member of Rally Com should
be notified of vacant seats.
Many of the stunts will be ani
mated, said Heyler, and for this rea
son rooters should remember their
row number. This number appears
on the top of the instruction card.
For the flip card stunts students
should hold the card for the first in
the series up, with the card for the
flip backed to it. Should a third
change occur, the student may slip
the third card in while holding up
the second, he said.
FLIP STUNTS
Heyler promises to announce flip
stunts in advance so rooters will
have a chance to get ready for the
animated stunt. It is planned to
have a better public address system
this week.
When the stunts are over, cards
must be passed to the Rally Com
members in the aisles. "If card
stunts are to be continued at the
games, co-operation in saving the
cards for the next week is neces
sary," he said. After last week's
spontaneous throw over 1,000 cards
were lost.
As a pre-game feature, Rally Com
will pass out megaphones and feath
ers to Stanford roters, said Heyler.
Now plans for entering the sta
dium have been set up by the ath

game, Dave Heyler, Rally Com co
chairman, said last night.
Under the new plan, men will en

in front of the bleachers to the
men's section. Women will continue
