# Stanford Relief Controversy Settled; Naples Will Get Support from Farm; SIRO to Head All-in-One Drive
## 
### 
Controversy concerning Stanford's
committment to send direct relief
to the University of Naples was
cleared up last night when Excom
voted to devote 30 percent of the
funds collected from this fall's Four
Feathers drive to the Italian School.
in addition, 20 percent of the funds
will go to World Student Service
Fund, making a total of 50 percent
of the anticipated $10,000 to $12,0000
fund available for foreign relief.
Molly Shaw, Stanford Relief co
chairman charged in yesterday's
Daily that Naples had not received
"a red cent" of Stanford money since
it "adopted" Naples last spring.
It was found by review of Excom
minutes that direct relief money tab
bed for Naples in Spring quarter
had been channeled to other sources.
But this technicality was rectified
at last night's meeting and Naples
will get all that is coming to it,
according to Tom MartzlofT, ASSU
president.
Date for the fall drive has been set.
from Nov. 10 to 14.
The drive will be conducted un
der the auspices of ihe Stanford
International Relief Organization

beaded by Miss Shaw and Bill
Dirker.
"There is a fundamental disparity
between international relief and our
own charities here," Dirker said dur
ing the meeting. "International re
lief is a charity for peace —an at
tempt to project Stanford actively
into the world situation. Charity here
is on a different scale for a different
purpose—just charity."
"Thus it is too bad that wc couldn't
get two separate drives, but at least
this way wc will be doing as well
as possible by all concerned."
"Everybody is happy now, and
everybody is getting a square deal,"
was the joint statement issued by
Miss Shaw and Dirker after the
meeting.
In addition to the 50 percent dis
tributed between general relief and
Stanford's specific project, 40 par
ent, th largest single chunk, will
go to the Community Chest and 10
percent will go into an emergency
floating fund of the ASSU.
Before Excom met last night, stu
dent leaders had the following
statements on Miss Shaw's disclos
ures:
Tom Martzloff, ASSU president:

[112 wc made a committment and did
n't back it, it. would be nice if we
did. But I don't know all the facts.
I haven't looked into the matter
thoroughly and don't want to express
a premature view on it.
Gene Mitguard, ASSU business
manager: The ASSU appropriated
money for the University of Naples
and the Stanford International Re-

Bent Jorgensen, editor of an
underground newspaper in occu
pied Denmark who played the
game of life or death with the
Gestapo not so long ago, will visit
the campus today and tomorrow.
Under the auspices of WSSF—
World Student Service Fund—he
will visit campus groups and local
leaders. Mr. Jorgensen has just
returned from Yugoslavia.

lief Organization last spring. But
summer Excom, at the instigation
of SIRO's Marky Cleck, changed its
mind as to disposition of it. Any
way, it went to relief just the same.
It just didn't go to Naples.
Ted Norton: Miss Shaw made an
interesting statement and has a good
point. But I don't think the problem
has been fully presented yet.


MOLLY SHAW yesterday dis
closed that University of Naples,
Stanford's adopted student serv
ice stepchild, hadn't received a
"red cent" of relief. But every
thing was cleared up at Excom
meeting last night and Stanford
will fulfill its obligation.
