# Martin Seeks Student Help for IIR Program
## 
### 
"Stanford can effectively take the lead over the whole west
coast in international student activities.
The statement is that of Chuck Martin, president of the Ins*j
tute of International Relations; the proof of these words lies with
Stanford's 8,000 students.
1500 students listed international organizations as their first

choice on the activity cards, accord
ing to Bob Von Pagenhardt, IIR
vice-president. "We want as many of
these people as possible at our spec
ial meeting today, a meeting to ac
quaint students with the workings
and functions of our different com
mittees."
The meeting will be held from 2
to 4 this afternoon in the Geography
Building behind the Quad Office.
Students who will contribute their
work are the basic need of the lIR if
Stanford is to make a success of its
extensive international program
The lIR, on behalf of Excom and
the Associated Students, coordinates
and directs the activities of the stu -
dent body in international affairs.
Every student is a member of the
IIR; he may exercise this member
ship by participating in any or all
of the six general committees of the
lIR.
SUB-COMMITTEES
These sub-committees are: 1) In
ternational Club which brings to
gether American and foreign stu
dents; 2) International Conference
Committee which conducts a con
ference on international affairs
every spring. It is now engaged iri
arranging a Western College Con
gress next month.
3) International Survey Commit
tee which sent two students abroad
last summer; 4) International Dis
cussion Committee which presents
world-wide issues for student con
sideration.
5) International Information Com
mittee which has a collection of ma -
terial on education, travel, and em
ployment abroad, maintains a file
of foreign correspondents, and is
now working on the creation of ex
change scholarships; 6) International
Relief Organization (SIRO) which
carries out all welfare activities.
COORDINATION AND SERVICE
In addition the lIR has a secretar
iat which coordinates and services
these committees.
Each committee desperately need;;
more workers, Von Pagenhardt
stated. An hour a week from in
terested students would suffice, ac
cording to the vice-president.
The aims of the lIR are as fol
lows: 1) vigorous support of all re
lief workers; 2) beginning a foreign
scholarship program; 3) investiga
tion of the possibility of exchange
professorships; 4) promotion corres
pondence between American and
foreign students; 5) formulating
plans for students to travel abroad.
