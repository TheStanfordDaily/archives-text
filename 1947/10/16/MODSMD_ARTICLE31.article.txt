# Farm Press of Today Is a Far Cry From Single-Press Shop of 1893
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
'Way back in 1893 Stanford was
just a toddling infant, but there were
a lot of people helping it to toddle in
I he l ight direction. One of these was
Julius Andrew Quelle, a sophomore
who saw the Farm's need for a
newspaper.
Quelle, an amateur printer, bought
a printing press, set up shop in a
112 orner of the power plant, and began
publishing the Daily Palo Alto. He
graduated in IP'js • ' continued his
printing at it.l 1927.
I'RKSK l
In 1013 the University bought
Quelle's little shop, which had been
moved to a tiny shack behind the
Union, and the Stanford University
Press was founded. From Andrew
Que-lle's single printing press came
the modern, efficient organization of
today.
The University Press now has a
staff of 113, eleven printing presses
o! various types, and an unusually
capable director in Donald P. Bean,
who assumed the direction of Stan
lord's press in August 1945, having
managed the Publicity Department
ol the University of Chicago Press
• nice 1927.
I RAINING SYSTEM
Bean, since coming to Stanford,
lias become particularly enthusiastic
over the fine training system pro
vided by the University Press and
its resulting academic value. He
estimates that in the field of Graphic
Arts a larger percentage of Stan
lord graduates have attained success
than in many schools specializing in
the' Graphic Arts.
Bean believes that the academic
success of the University Press is
largely due to the fact that it is the
only university press that has han
dled student publications throughout
its existence. In addition, the cen
tralized grouping of the press, the
Daily shack, Quad offices, and Chap
parul offices facilitates more efficient
handling of these student publica
tions. Recently, for this reason, Di
rector Bean successfully opposed a
movement to change the location of
the Press' offices.
Besides publishing the Chapparal,

Daily, Quad, Alumni Review, and
the Stanford Calendars, the Univer
sity Press is pre-emminently en
gaged in the publishing of scholastic
works.
Between Sept. 1, 1946, and Aug.
31, 1947, the University Press
published 31 books and pamphlets
dealing with subjects ranging from
"The Psychobiological Program of
the War Shipping Administration" to
"Mammals of California."
"The Ancient Maya," by Sylvanus
G. Morley, published in November

last year, has been a best seller, with
over 10,000 copies selling at $10.00
each. Life Magazine recently feat
ured a lengthy story about the An
cient Maya and the Atlantic Month
ly called the author "the greatest
champ the Maya ever had."
Last year, with 3,000 charter sub
scribers, the University Press began
publication of "The Pacific Specta
tor," which is published quarterly
for the Pacific Coast Committee for
the Humanities and is sponsored by
23 educational institutions.

Currently rolling off Stanford's
presses are: "The Gifted Child
Grows Up," the fourth in a series
of significant psychological works by
Dr. Lewis M. Terman and Melita
Oden; "San Francisco Is Your
Home," by Samuel Dickson; "Gold,
Guns, and Ghost Towns," by Sehal
fant; and "Scholarship and Cata
clysm," a summary of research and
teaching in the field of American
History in the colleges and universi
ties of the United States by Edgar
Eugene Robinson.
