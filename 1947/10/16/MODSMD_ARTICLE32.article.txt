"Going, going, gone! For two dol
lars, a book worth $1.50!" In the
excitement of Hurlburt House's
auction last night, a second-hand
book went for more than its original
price.
'Hie auction, an idea of House
President Betty Barlow, was held to
i lean up Hurlburt's attic, replenish
the treasury, and fill the girls' rooms
wilh articles they didn't know they
wanted.
A bolt of gray and red-striped
awning material was bought by one
girl to upholster her boy friend's
car.
Another girl bought, a half-filled
box of Petty girl stationery to write
to her boy friend in the East.
The girls decided they had no real
need for a little red wagon filled
with a set of baby's building blocks
eo they voted to give it to the Con
Home.
Midi Sawyer, auctioneer, in trying
to sell a book written in French,
said that it would be useful for a
trip to France and showed love of
culture. It Wen 4 ""t 40 cents. Two
dollars and a Half was paid for a
cook book.
A pair of rubber boots was bid
up to two dollars until one bidder
remembered she already had a pair.
But what hurt most was when
one girl bought her own radio for
50 cents.
