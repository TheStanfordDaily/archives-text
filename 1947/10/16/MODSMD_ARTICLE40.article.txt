Among the books published re- j
j cently by the Stanford University
j Press is "General Education in the I
i Negro College" by Irving A. Der- I
' bigny, administrative dean at the
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The
first intensive study of general edu
cation in the American Negro col-*i
lege, this book considers aims, cur- j
riculum, patterns, general education j
courses, and guidance.
Of the 118 Negro colleges in
I America, 20 were chosen as the i
basis for the study. They included j
teachers' colleges, liberal arts col- j
leges, technical colleges, and gen- J
eral universities. The studies were
made through written material, ob- j

servation, interview, and group dis
cussion. From the material gathered
observations were made as to the
status of the colleges today and
their needs.
In listing their important aims, 12
colleges mentioned fundamental in
formation, that is, a broad cultural
knowledge, while only two felt the
need to stress the selection of a vo
cation. This shows that these are
more than trade schools, and want
to provide for the Negro an educa
tion equivalent to that provided in
any other college.
From his survey, Mr. Derbigny

has been able to draw many con
clusions as to the improvements
which can be made in these schools.
Included in this is the need for a
more definite policy concerning
specific aims of educational pro
grams and a better understanding of
the individual student and his
needs.
