story prize contest. Millard Sheets,
nationally known artist and mem
ber of the Claremont College fac
ulty, has designed the Spectator's

and universities. Contributors in
clude many recognized names in

Dean John W. Dodds, of the
School of Humanities, answers an
article by Hartzell Spence which
appeared in the last issue. Spence
discounted criticism of radio by
claiming most of it comes from in
tellectuals who listen least to the
radio and comprise only 12 per cent
of its audience.
In preparation for his article,
Dean Dodds listened for 16 consecu
tive hours to radio broadcasts. He
deplores the quality of the pro
grams, alleging that what sells and
not what the public wants gets on
the air.
Other contributors to the Specta
tor in this issue include Bernard
DeVoto, MacKinley Helm, Virgil
Whitaker, and Lewis Mumford.
