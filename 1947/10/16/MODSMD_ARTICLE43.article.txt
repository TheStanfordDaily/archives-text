# Alameda Nips Jayvees, 19-12
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
It was too much Joe Perry for Jim Cox's Stanford junior var
sity yesterday as they bowed to a hard charging Alameda Naval
Air Station football team by a 19 to 12 score on the local gridiron.
Before the game started, the rumor made the rounds that
Buck Shaw, head coach of the professional San Francisco 49'ers,

unci liis assistant coach, Jim Lawson,
were present for the sole purpose of
viewing one Joe Perry.
PERRY KIINS WILD
Perry lived up to all advance ex
pectations. Behind a mediocre line
and against a green Stanford outfit,
Perry, an all-state jaycee star in
1944 and 1945 at Compton, figured in
all three of the Navalair Hellcats'
touchdowns. He passed for two,
plunged over from the three for the
third marker, and in general proved
himself to be the be:;t back to play on
the Stanford campus this year. His
passes connected with amazing reg
ularity, he called the plays, did the
kicking, and carried the ball 150
yards from scrimmage.
The contest started out in a man
ner that was to continue throughout
the game as Perry sliced off tackle
for a 47 yard jaunt that carried him
from the Hellcats' 33 to Stanford's
20. Two plays later the fleetfooted
Negro took the ball to the three
yard line and then, after a teammate
failed to dent the JV forward wall,
he plunged through the center for
the first touchdown of the game.
The try for point was good and the
score stood at 7-0 in favor of the
sailors.
JAYVEES COME BACK
The Jayvees opened the second
quarter by piling up six consecutive
first downs on a sustained march to
the Hellcats' 20 from which spot Ron
James tossed to Van Johns, who
stepped over for the Cards' first
marker. The try for point was
blocked after a high center.
Five minutes later right half Mc-
Killip scored from the 10 to make
il 12 to 7 in favor of the Farm lads.
SAILORS NUDGE AHEAD
With less than one minute to play
in the first half, the Card nemesis,
Perry, threw a perfect strike to end
Jack Davenport in a play good for
50 yards to put the sailors ahead
by a 13-12 mark.
ll was as if everyone on the field
was co-operating to give Buck Shaw
a show when, in the fourth quarter,
Perry rounded his own right end
with all the blocking that can be
gained from a single wingback
formation and gave a brilliant dis
play of open field running as he car
ried the ball 45 yards to the Stan
ford 10. The big left half then pro
ceeded to pass to his backfield mate,
Bert Lewis, for the last TD of the
game. The conversion kick was
blocked, leaving a final score 19 to
12.
JUNIORS SHOW PROMISE
It was the first game for the In
dian juniors who showed a great
deal of fight and tackling that should
make their elders on the varsity sit
up and take notice. The difference of
the two teams was Perry, who was
a very hard man to stop after he
passed that scrimmage line.
The Juniors could take some so
lace in the fact that they were
beaten by a club that had piled up
173 points while allowing only 33 to
be scored against them in four games.
These points were scored by a strong
California Rambler outfit that de
feated the Alameda men by a 33 to 13
count earlier in the season. The
sailors had shut out Mare Island, San
Francisco State and Hamilton Field
in previous encounters.

by a 13-12 mark.
ll was as if everyone on the field
was co-operating to give Buck Shaw
a show when, in the fourth quarter,
Perry rounded his own right end
with all the blocking that can be
gained from a single wingback
formation and gave a brilliant dis
play of open field running as he car
ried the ball 45 yards to the Stan
ford 10. The big left half then pro
ceeded to pass to his backfield mate,
Bert Lewis, for the last TD of the
game. The conversion kick was
blocked, leaving a final score 19 to
12.
JUNIORS SHOW PROMISE
It was the first game for the In
dian juniors who showed a great
deal of fight and tackling that should
make their elders on the varsity sit
up and take notice. The difference of
the two teams was Perry, who was
a very hard man to stop after he
passed that scrimmage line.
The Juniors could take some so
lace in the fact that they were
beaten by a club that had piled up
173 points while allowing only 33 to
be scored against them in four games.
These points were scored by a strong
California Rambler outfit that de
feated the Alameda men by a 33 to 13
count earlier in the season. The
sailors had shut out Mare Island, San
Francisco State and Hamilton Field
in previous encounters.
It was too much Joe Perry for Jim Cox's Stanford junior var
sity yesterday as they bowed to a hard charging Alameda Naval
Air Station football team by a 19 to 12 score on the local gridiron.
Before the game started, the rumor made the rounds that
Buck Shaw, head coach of the professional San Francisco 49'ers,

unci liis assistant coach, Jim Lawson,
were present for the sole purpose of
viewing one Joe Perry.
PERRY KIINS WILD
Perry lived up to all advance ex
pectations. Behind a mediocre line
and against a green Stanford outfit,
Perry, an all-state jaycee star in
1944 and 1945 at Compton, figured in
all three of the Navalair Hellcats'
touchdowns. He passed for two,
plunged over from the three for the
third marker, and in general proved
himself to be the be:;t back to play on
the Stanford campus this year. His
passes connected with amazing reg
ularity, he called the plays, did the
kicking, and carried the ball 150
yards from scrimmage.
The contest started out in a man
ner that was to continue throughout
the game as Perry sliced off tackle
for a 47 yard jaunt that carried him
from the Hellcats' 33 to Stanford's
20. Two plays later the fleetfooted
Negro took the ball to the three
yard line and then, after a teammate
failed to dent the JV forward wall,
he plunged through the center for
the first touchdown of the game.
The try for point was good and the
score stood at 7-0 in favor of the
sailors.
JAYVEES COME BACK
The Jayvees opened the second
quarter by piling up six consecutive
first downs on a sustained march to
the Hellcats' 20 from which spot Ron
James tossed to Van Johns, who
stepped over for the Cards' first
marker. The try for point was
blocked after a high center.
Five minutes later right half Mc-
Killip scored from the 10 to make
il 12 to 7 in favor of the Farm lads.
SAILORS NUDGE AHEAD
With less than one minute to play
in the first half, the Card nemesis,
Perry, threw a perfect strike to end
Jack Davenport in a play good for
50 yards to put the sailors ahead
by a 13-12 mark.
