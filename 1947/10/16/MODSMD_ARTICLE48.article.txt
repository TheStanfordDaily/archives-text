# She's Cute and Can Swim That's Frosh Pat Geary
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
She was basking in the sunlight
near Union Court, and she said her
name was Pat Geary.
She was smiling like a naiad bent
on mischief, and she spoke in a
satiny voice fraught with a kind of
homespun sincerity.
"It would be nice if I could go to
London and the Olympic Games
next year," she said.
Despite being a member of the
Class of '51, it must be pointed out
now that Pat is also one of the na
tion's best bets for aquatic laurels
on the Olympics-bound U.S. wom
en's swimming squad.
SOUTHERN CAL GIRL
Pat is a Long Beach girl, a day
dreamer of sorts, and one who is
decidedly given to "keeping in
training." An advocate of fostering
international good neighborliness,
she has a remarkable sense of per
fected timing when she speaks.
Most of the better swimmers have
more gold, silver, and bonze medal
lions than one can shake a diving
boacl at, and Pat is no exception.
"I've been swimming since I was
five years old," she remarked. "Com
petitively, though, I've been swim
ming since 1939."
Her dark green eyes became riv
eted to a cluster of ivy clinging to
a stucco wall nearby. She lowered
her voice.
"It's so wonderful here. And four

years won't seem so long!"
The beauteous Miss Geary then
shifted vocal gears and drove on
to a mesa labeled "seriousness."
IMPRESSIVE RECORD
Swimming under the banner of
the Southern Pacific Amateur Ath
letic Association, Pat has either
won or placed near the zenith in
such local classics as the Open
Southern California, the Long Beach
pier to pier, the Belmont Shore, and
numerous others.
She has swum freestyle or breast
stroke, but confesses a liking to ca
vorting in either the 200- or 400-
meter backstroke.
Swimming several days a week at
the women's pool, Pat has been
heard to remark: "One can get aw
fully 'dull' by swimming every day.
With me, anyhow, it's best not to
swim too much while in training."
Having already completed a brief
spell as a fashion model, Pat fur
nishes enthusiastic evidence of one
day becoming "an American career
girl."
"I've never tired of the ordinary
things of life," she said. "Seems like
I'm always happy."
The affable Miss Geary, who in
tneds becoming an international re
lations major, later admitted hav
ing trouble with Western Civ, but
was resigned to one thing.
"It would be nice to go to the
Olympics, wouldn't it?"

vorting in either the 200- or 400-
meter backstroke.
Swimming several days a week at
the women's pool, Pat has been
heard to remark: "One can get aw
fully 'dull' by swimming every day.
With me, anyhow, it's best not to
swim too much while in training."
Having already completed a brief
spell as a fashion model, Pat fur
nishes enthusiastic evidence of one
day becoming "an American career
girl."
"I've never tired of the ordinary
things of life," she said. "Seems like
I'm always happy."
The affable Miss Geary, who in
tneds becoming an international re
lations major, later admitted hav
ing trouble with Western Civ, but
was resigned to one thing.
"It would be nice to go to the
Olympics, wouldn't it?"
She was basking in the sunlight
near Union Court, and she said her
name was Pat Geary.
She was smiling like a naiad bent
on mischief, and she spoke in a
satiny voice fraught with a kind of
homespun sincerity.
"It would be nice if I could go to
London and the Olympic Games
next year," she said.
Despite being a member of the
Class of '51, it must be pointed out
now that Pat is also one of the na
tion's best bets for aquatic laurels
on the Olympics-bound U.S. wom
en's swimming squad.
SOUTHERN CAL GIRL
Pat is a Long Beach girl, a day
dreamer of sorts, and one who is
decidedly given to "keeping in
training." An advocate of fostering
international good neighborliness,
she has a remarkable sense of per
fected timing when she speaks.
Most of the better swimmers have
more gold, silver, and bonze medal
lions than one can shake a diving
boacl at, and Pat is no exception.
"I've been swimming since I was
five years old," she remarked. "Com
petitively, though, I've been swim
ming since 1939."
Her dark green eyes became riv
eted to a cluster of ivy clinging to
a stucco wall nearby. She lowered
her voice.
"It's so wonderful here. And four

years won't seem so long!"
The beauteous Miss Geary then
shifted vocal gears and drove on
to a mesa labeled "seriousness."
IMPRESSIVE RECORD
Swimming under the banner of
the Southern Pacific Amateur Ath
letic Association, Pat has either
won or placed near the zenith in
such local classics as the Open
Southern California, the Long Beach
pier to pier, the Belmont Shore, and
numerous others.
She has swum freestyle or breast
stroke, but confesses a liking to ca
vorting in either the 200- or 400-
meter backstroke.
