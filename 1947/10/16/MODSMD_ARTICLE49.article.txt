# San Jose Water Poto Squad Dumps Injuns
## 
### 
A Stanford athletic team tasted defeat in a different form
yesterday afternoon when the Farm water polo squad faltered
in the second half to drop a 7-5 thriller to San Jose State at the
Encina Pools.
The Indians started fast, with Fritz Maurer and Harry Borchers

leading the way with three quick
baskets in the first quarter. Maurer
scored first on a neat shot from the
center of the pool to put the Cards
into an early lead which they held
throughout the first half.
It was getting dark when the two
teams came out for the second half,
and with the coming darkness, the
tide of victory seemed to change
too. The Spartans no longer seemed
to be dazzled by the terrific speed
which Stanford stiowed in the first
half.
The San Jose goalie, playing his
first intercollegiate game, learned

fast during the first half, and by the
third quarter was making some
miraculous stops.
The Stanford Freshmen team
built up an early lead and coasted
home to an 8-4 victory over the
San Jose Frosh in the 3:30 prelim
inary game.
