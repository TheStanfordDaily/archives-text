"I'm in favor of bringing red-hot
Communists over here. I'm not
afraid they'll convert us, and they
should have a chance to see for
themselves what democracy really
means."
"With this sentiment, Bill Farrer
and "Shorty" Grannis stressed the
need for exchange of students and
ideologies between countries at last
night's informal meeting of the
YWCA cabinet.
Farrer said that each living group
should pay living expenses for one
foreign student, the University
should waive tuition, and Excom
arrange for passage. Speaking to
the women, he emphasized that
there are few women students in
foreign universities, and therefore
only the outstanding women would
benefit.
Grannis outlined a few of the op
portunities for summer European
travel for women. He mentioned
the Experiment in International
Living, in which American girls
lived in foreign homes for the sum
mer, the Youth Hostels, and sum
mer sessions in the Universities of
Prague, Geneva, and the Sorbonne.
