# Men's Council Cracks Down
## 
### 
Men's Council decided this week to "get
tough" with any house which tolerates "wa
terbagging" by its members.
The penalties it established are severe.
There may be difficulty in enforcing this edict
against waterbagging.
However no one can argue that Men's Coun
cil is unjustified. Waterbagging has grown to
such proportions that it has become danger
ous in addition to being St nuisance. It has
gone past the boundary of good clean fun.
Several houses, much to their own dis

credit, have been unable to discourage their
members from the practice.
Men's Council has been forced to carry
the ball. The student body should back the
council 100 percent in its efforts to make the
campus a better place to live.
The penalties decided upon by Men's Coun
cil may be severe but who cares . . . the only
ones affected will be a small minority who
should have grown out of their childhood
habits long ago.
