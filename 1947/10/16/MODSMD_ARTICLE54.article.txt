# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
Things have come to a pretty past. A pretty past
but gloomy future. One of Stanford's long standing
customs is about to be outlawed. A custom that is
more dear to our hearts than Sunday teas at , the
Tresidders, more dear than the Honor Code, even
more dear than the fond memory of Doodles
Weaver-— namely, waterbagging.
Men's Council (my nose isn't blue, I've been
drinking ink) has made waterbagging as illegal as
Ben Franklin's children.
They undoubtedly dreamed up this ruling on the
basis that college students are mature men and
women, and that waterbagging as such has no place
in their lives.
I am here to refute this line of thought. College
students aren't mature, they're just cynical which
makes them look more mature. Or maybe its the
long dresses that make the girls look like little old
ladies.
The average college girl of today doesn't know
any more about a needle and thread than the college
girl of any other year. This fact is justified only by
the fact that the men don't know any more about
a bucksaw. This strikes me as being conclusive
proof of something or other.
I heard a story about a waterbagging incident,
which, like most stories, probably bears no truth.
Seems that some freshman dropped a water bag on
an unsuspecting figure. With a cry of outrage the
voice came up from below:

"Young man, I'll have you punished for this.
Do you know who I am?"
"No," said the upstairs bombardier.
"I'm the dean of men" snapped the drenchee.
There was a short silence, and the freshman
spoke:
"Well, do you know who I am?"
"No," said the dean.
"And that's a damn good thing," said the frosh,
closing the window.
Under this new ruling, the penalty for a first
offense waterbagging would be $5.00 from each
person living in the place that had the water to
fill the bag, and the window from which to drop it.
The second offense fine is doubled to ten prunes for
each person in the living residence.
Personally I'm against the punishment of the
crowd for the crime of the individual, but it sounds
like a hell of a fine way to make money for some
body.
Certainly no one can deny that waterbagging is
a good CLEAN sport. I know one guy that didn't
have to take a bath all quarter. He got a second
story baptism one night though, and was plenty mad
about it—it was only Friday.
All of which proves the Men's Council is unsani
tary. At five and ten bucks a throw, cleanliness
is no longer "next to Godliness," it's next to poverty.
I think somebody's all wet on this deal, which
serves them right for walking so close to the building.
