The one encouraging aspect of the still recurrent
outbreaks of race oppression in the deep South is
that they are at last, in one way or another producing
a healthy reaction toward improvement. In the past,
they were folded into a dark fog of bigotry as some
thing nobody could, or would be, allowed to do any
thing about. Now we find, more and more, just and
liberal minded people in the South itself determined
to stamp out the spread of these destructive fires.
The latest example comes from Georgia, where the
State Board of Corrections has just abolished its
highway convict camp system.
On July 11, near the city of Brunswick, Ga., eight
Negro convicts were shot to "death by camp guards in
what was described as an "escape attempt." As was
expected, a Superior Court grand jury exonerated
the warden of the camp and five guards as "justified
in their action." Yet, the Glynn County Commis
sioner, a Mr. Sam Levine, now dares to go before
the Prison Board and testify that this slaughter was
an absolutely needless massacre. The true story of
this whole set-up is that the Negroes had been
brought back to the camp not for refusing to work,
but because they feared to enter a snake-infested
ditch. These prisoners were not bent on escape.
County policemen who were present at the camp
refused the warden's order to open fire, but the

guards of the camp emptied their shotguns into the
group of nearby Negroes. The Board of Corrections
promptly voted to close two of its worst man-traps,
including the one in which these eight Negroes met
their tragic death.
True, this step forward does not accomplish too
much, but at least it shows progress, though not as
much as the rest of the nation would like to see.
Georgia abandoned her notorious chain-gangs four
years ago, but she still retains her eighty-nine county
controlled convict labor camps, which, undoubtedly, is
the most ancient penal system in the United States
(dating all the way back to the year 1848). Yet, to me,
it is interesting to speculate on what might have
happened had the arrogate Governor, Herman Tal
madge, still been in officeâ€”most likely nothing at all.
The influence of the new Governor, Melvin Thomp
son, is milder and much more advanced. Even the
exonerating Glynn County grand jury was shamed
into a recommendation to close its vicious "home
grown" camp.
Thus in Georgia, as in the rest of the South, the
area of enlightenment perceptibly spreads, and
slowly, very slowly in this section of the United States
which has always breeded and supported racial
prejudice, precedents are falling along the roadside
and "freedom" is slowly broadening.
