# CAMPUS OPINION

To I he Editor:
I note that you invite contributions to your
Campus Opinion column, not excluding (either
through graciousness or oversight) those of alums.
So I am hopping in to endorse the present YWCA
membership drive on campus, from the point of view
of an alum who joins yearly (there are other mav
ericks like that) from sheer appreciation of its value
in raising citizens. I hope all YW-raised Stanford
girls settle in Palo Alto. We can use them. And I
congratulate all other communities that get them.
The contributions of their program are visible
on campus. Their potential future contributions in
terest us, who like to feel Stanford raises yearly
crops of helpful and selfless leaders. In the frantic
war years, war-concerned organizations in Palo Alto
grabbed anyone who volunteered to help, since you
can use anyone for something.
If she was a Stanford woman who had been active
in her campus life you felt good about her, shoved
more work on her quicker, explained less. You
were fairly sure she would be objective, not thin
skinned, would get on with people, would not do her
work in a mirror (so to speak) could separate prin
ciples from people, including herself. In a word,
she would have the know-how of leadership, and
the can-do with it. She would not need to practice
on your organization and she would fit in. Very of
ten, if you explored, you would find she had learned
her trade, trained herself in leadership, under the
Y, and used it in other campus work.
Your Y, your Miss Pat. and now her young part
ner (j.g ), Mrs. Fess, are perhaps better assets to the
future usefulness of campus women than you may
realize, being so properly pre-occupied with your
present as you are. But the town of Palo Alto seems
to realize it. The Stanford Y is included, for its

professional and Board Budget, in the town's Com
munity Youth Fund Drive.

To the Editor:
The communists have made it plain to all who
will listen that they intend to bring the entire world
under their control. They have used, and will con
tinue to use, the most unscrupulous methods to carry
out their program. Posing as a liberal is merely a
mild every-day example of these methods.
This fact makes it necessary for the true liberal
to clearly state his position. Lest he be mistaken for a
communist in disguise, the liberal must take a def
inite stand against communism. This is especially
important when his liberal convictions lead him to
agree with some of the communists' stated objectives.
George Brunn is a case in point. It was not until
I took him to task in my letter in the Daily, Oct. 8,
that he added to his condemnation of Spain, Argen
tina, Greece, Turkey, and China, a similar condem
nation of Russia. (At that, he was praising with
faint damns, refusing to endorse "either Stalin's or
Truman's brand" of "aggressive nationalism.")
Now Gelsomina Smith brings up my name in con
nection with "anti-communist hysteria." Let me
assure Miss Smith, then, that I am not hysterical
when I assert the following: The current communist
line is to (1) compare American foreign policy with
Hitler's; (2) ridicule the F. 8.1.; (3) pooh-pooh the
"red bogey." Miss Smith does all three of these in
her letter. Yes, this arouses suspicions in my mind.
It makes me wonder whose side she is on in the
present struggle between democracy and communism.
There can be no neutrality between freedom and
tyranny.
