# Evolution of Farm Fraternity System Recalled As Council Plans Program
## 
### STU FITCH 
Again this quarter the Interfra
ternity Council and Board of Con
trol are swinging into action to ma
neuver the Farm's 24 fraternities
into a program of full co-operation
with campus activities.
And the fraternity situation at
Stanford is a far cry from the pio
neer days, when rushing started on
the train at Menlo, terminated at
the Paly station, and pledging start
ed the moment the neophyte reached
the campus. This was eventually
followed by Hell Week, and the guy
was in . . . without a chance.
PRESIDENT'S CONFERENCE
This was the situation which led
to the establishment of the Presi
dent's Conference of Young Men in
1908, and the Interfraternity Coun
cil which grew from it in 1921.
In 1923 the council, made up of

all fraternity presidents, was dis
carded except as a discussion group
to determine policies concerning
problems of an academic, social, fi
nancial, and general nature. Its for
mer disciplinary powers were taken
over by the Interfraternity Board of
Control, composed of six fraternity
men, two alumni, two faculty mem
bers, and the dean of men.
DAZING OUTLAWED
Among revisions made by the
board was the outlawing of hazing
in 1936, when pre-initiation period
took its place. In 1940 the board
outlawed the use of the paddle and
"pre" was dropped from the period
title.
Prime in the eyes of all Row men
and interested freshmen is rushing,
the period set aside for both groups
to get acquainted. To govern this
period, the board has established a
set of conduct rules which is trans
mitted to freshmen and Row through
The Daily and the Interfraternity
Magazine.
DEFERRED RUSHING
The rushing system at Stanford is
unusual in that it is a deferred set
up. This method allows the new
rough to become adjusted to Uni
versity life, and gives both house
and freshman a chance to size each
other up.
Under this plan, the first-quarter
freshmen may not pledge until win
ter quarter, when all houses go
through a period of formal rushing
and pledging.
Realizing the necessity of a get-

I acquainted period, Interfraternity
Council has slated three open houses
for this quarter. This will allow
freshmen to "think it over" during
Christmas vacation when parents
and friends are around to give ad
vice if such is needed.
But rushing is only one function
of the council. Important is the
maintenance of fraternity scholar
ship averages on a par with hall
men's averages.
STUDY TABLES
Each house keeps an eye on the
performance of its members, and ti
necessary sets up a study table for
delinquent brothers. This function
was enlarged in the recently inaug-
I urated resident-adviser plan. This
graduate member acts as liaison be
tween house and administration,
and serves to insure proper conduct
of the chapter.
In 1934 the Interfraternity Coun
cil established a competitive frater
nity scholarship fund to the mem
ory of Bruce Tarver. This fall a
Stanford man is attending the Uni
versity of London, and his exchange
student has moved into his frater
nity house for a year on the Farm.
NATIONAL CRITERION
Behind all interfraternity activi
ties lies the criterion of the national
conference:
"We consider the fraternity re
sponsible for a positive contribution
to the primary functions of the col
leges and universities."
Now at Stanford when a guy
joins a house ... he has had a
chance.

NATIONAL CRITERION
Behind all interfraternity activi
ties lies the criterion of the national
conference:
"We consider the fraternity re
sponsible for a positive contribution
to the primary functions of the col
leges and universities."
Now at Stanford when a guy
joins a house ... he has had a
chance.
Again this quarter the Interfra
ternity Council and Board of Con
trol are swinging into action to ma
neuver the Farm's 24 fraternities
into a program of full co-operation
with campus activities.
And the fraternity situation at
Stanford is a far cry from the pio
neer days, when rushing started on
the train at Menlo, terminated at
the Paly station, and pledging start
ed the moment the neophyte reached
the campus. This was eventually
followed by Hell Week, and the guy
was in . . . without a chance.
PRESIDENT'S CONFERENCE
This was the situation which led
to the establishment of the Presi
dent's Conference of Young Men in
1908, and the Interfraternity Coun
cil which grew from it in 1921.
In 1923 the council, made up of

all fraternity presidents, was dis
carded except as a discussion group
to determine policies concerning
problems of an academic, social, fi
nancial, and general nature. Its for
mer disciplinary powers were taken
over by the Interfraternity Board of
Control, composed of six fraternity
men, two alumni, two faculty mem
bers, and the dean of men.
DAZING OUTLAWED
Among revisions made by the
board was the outlawing of hazing
in 1936, when pre-initiation period
took its place. In 1940 the board
outlawed the use of the paddle and
"pre" was dropped from the period
title.
Prime in the eyes of all Row men
and interested freshmen is rushing,
the period set aside for both groups
to get acquainted. To govern this
period, the board has established a
set of conduct rules which is trans
mitted to freshmen and Row through
The Daily and the Interfraternity
Magazine.
DEFERRED RUSHING
The rushing system at Stanford is
unusual in that it is a deferred set
up. This method allows the new
rough to become adjusted to Uni
versity life, and gives both house
and freshman a chance to size each
other up.
Under this plan, the first-quarter
freshmen may not pledge until win
ter quarter, when all houses go
through a period of formal rushing
and pledging.
Realizing the necessity of a get-

I acquainted period, Interfraternity
Council has slated three open houses
for this quarter. This will allow
freshmen to "think it over" during
Christmas vacation when parents
and friends are around to give ad
vice if such is needed.
But rushing is only one function
of the council. Important is the
maintenance of fraternity scholar
ship averages on a par with hall
men's averages.
STUDY TABLES
Each house keeps an eye on the
performance of its members, and ti
necessary sets up a study table for
delinquent brothers. This function
was enlarged in the recently inaug-
I urated resident-adviser plan. This
graduate member acts as liaison be
tween house and administration,
and serves to insure proper conduct
of the chapter.
In 1934 the Interfraternity Coun
cil established a competitive frater
nity scholarship fund to the mem
ory of Bruce Tarver. This fall a
Stanford man is attending the Uni
versity of London, and his exchange
student has moved into his frater
nity house for a year on the Farm.
