## 
### 
Abnormal psychology will be
treated in dramatic form by mem
bers of the Studio Theater when
they open a four-day run of Au
gust Strind berg's "The Father" on
Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater, announced student director
Walter Krumm.
Leading roles of Adolf and Laura,
a cavalry captain and his wife, will
be taken by Mel Ellett and Elaine
Maltzmann. Their daughter Bertha,
who figures as the pivot of conflict,
will be interpreted by Nancy De
Groot. The part of the nurse Mar
garet will be played by Miriam
Worland.
Newcomers to the Stanford stage
who will take part in the production
will include Ralph McCormick as
the doctor, George lokimedes as the
pastor, Michael lokimedes as Nojd,
and Norman Wilner as the orderly.
Originally produced on the West
Coast in 1940 at San Jose State Col
lege, "The Father" depicts the
struggle between husband and wife
for control of their only child. The
play is Strindberg's answer to Ibsen,
who believed in the emancipation of
women. Taking the opposite view,
the Swedish dramatist contended
that woman should be merely the
mother of the race, and thus the
creative force of civilization.
Priced at BO cents, tickets may be
purchased in room 202, Memorial
Hall.
With Shakespeare's "Richard III"
scheduled for complete rehearsals,

diers, including Donald Biggs, Nor
