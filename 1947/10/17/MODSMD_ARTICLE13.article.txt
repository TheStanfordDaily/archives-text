REDWOOD CITY. Oct. lfi (UP).
—A 20-year-old Polish war bride,
held on suspicion of slaying her
male companion in a speeding auto
and charged with robbery, sat stoi
cally in her jail cell today and re
marked, "I died in a Nazi prison
camp — now they can kill me in
America."
Pert, dark-haired Jadwiga Curtin,
who said she was interned by the
Nazis at Frankfurt, shot George W.
Conner, 25-year-old ex-GI and fa
ther of three children, in his auto
early yesterday while they strug
gled over a gun.
She said the gun belonged to her
boy friend, Howard Durham, of Saf
ford, Ariz. She met Conner in a bar
and took a ride with him, she con

tinued, and had to point the gun at
him "because he drove like mad."
She was charged today with rob
bing George Caulfield, Stanford stu
dent, who identified her and Dur
ham as the couple who robbed him
of $40 and a wrist watch along a
highway near San Bruno Sunday
night. Durham also was charged
with robbery.
Caulfield said he took a ride with
Mrs. Curtin at her suggestion. They
stopped on a lonely road where she
suggested they go walking, Caul
field said, and when they returned
to the car a man he identified as
Durham was waiting with a gun and
robbed him.
Conner was collection manager of
a San Francisco loan company. His

wife, Shirley, said "he was a very
intemperate man," and she planned
to divorce him. His body was to be
taken by plane tonight to Jackson,
Miss., then to Kosciusko, Miss., for
burial.
Mis. Curtin said she worked with
her father in the Polish under
ground, and one time helped blow
up a bridge. She was picked up by
the Germans, who she said tortured
her in an effort to learn about the
underground, and was sent to a
concentration camp.
After she was liberated, she said
she married George Curtin, an
American soldier. She came to the
United States to live with him at
Havre, Mont., but left him after a
quarrel last fall. She went to Saf
ford, Ariz., where she met Durham.
