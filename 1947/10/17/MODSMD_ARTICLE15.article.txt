# Vast Student Needs Shown
## 
### 
In a world where drinking water
is, in some places, at a premium and
where students are lucky if they
can copy notes from microfilmed
books flashed against walls by lan
tern slide, there is not enough that
a Stanford student—or all the stu
dents in the United States—can do
or give, Bent Jorgensen said last
night.
Mr. Jorgensen, a Danish under
ground newspaper editor who
played hide and seek with Gestapo
agents during the war, told the
facts of foreign students' lives to
two groups of women students on
the Stanford campus last night.
He spoke to a combined group of
70 Cubberley and Hurlburt women
and then addressed a sparse audi
ence of 25 of Roble's 230 women.
"It's a little fantastic when you
come from Europe to this country,"
he said. "For one thing it's just
amazing to see everyone going
around in cars.
"In Europe it's an incredibly sim
ple, hard life ... it equalizes peo
ple ... a small room barren of
furniture —no beds, tables, lamps,
chairs —that is luxury for six stu
dents I know.
DON'T WANT PITY
"They are badly off, but they
don't want pity from you in Amer
ica . . . they don't want people who
pity them to help them.
"Those students are accused of
having strange attitiides by some.
But you must understand-—in terms
of the whole backwash of a pene
trating total war experience.
"They are too absorbed in the
task of rebuilding their country to
bother with anything that isn't com
pletely essential.
"These students that you at Stan
ford are attempting to help through
the WSSF are more than the future
leaders of Europe. They are mak
ing the decisions now. And if the
United States wants to make contact
with them, they can do it only by
aiding in the immense task of re
building the shattered existence
that is theirs," he said.
FIVE MILLION NEEDED
"Five million dollars would just
care for the barest needs of univer
sity students alone over there. So
far American students have given
half a million. They are grateful.
They will be more grateful to you
when the million dollars WSSF has
budgeted this year from the U.S.
gets over there," Jorgensen said.
"It will be substance—food, roofs
over heads, and the most essential
need . . . books.
"You perhaps would not believe
it but they would rather have books
than food.
"I didn't come here to tell you
horror stories," he said. "But I tell
you only an average occurrence
when I tell you that an Italian girl
could go to school only every other
day last winter because she had to
share a lone, battered pair of shoes
with another girl.

night.
Mr. Jorgensen, a Danish under
ground newspaper editor who
played hide and seek with Gestapo
agents during the war, told the
facts of foreign students' lives to
two groups of women students on
the Stanford campus last night.
He spoke to a combined group of
70 Cubberley and Hurlburt women
and then addressed a sparse audi
ence of 25 of Roble's 230 women.
"It's a little fantastic when you
come from Europe to this country,"
he said. "For one thing it's just
amazing to see everyone going
around in cars.
"In Europe it's an incredibly sim
ple, hard life ... it equalizes peo
ple ... a small room barren of
furniture —no beds, tables, lamps,
chairs —that is luxury for six stu
dents I know.
DON'T WANT PITY
"They are badly off, but they
don't want pity from you in Amer
ica . . . they don't want people who
pity them to help them.
"Those students are accused of
having strange attitiides by some.
But you must understand-—in terms
of the whole backwash of a pene
trating total war experience.
"They are too absorbed in the
task of rebuilding their country to
bother with anything that isn't com
pletely essential.
"These students that you at Stan
ford are attempting to help through
the WSSF are more than the future
leaders of Europe. They are mak
ing the decisions now. And if the
United States wants to make contact
with them, they can do it only by
aiding in the immense task of re
building the shattered existence
that is theirs," he said.
FIVE MILLION NEEDED
"Five million dollars would just
care for the barest needs of univer
sity students alone over there. So
far American students have given
half a million. They are grateful.
They will be more grateful to you
when the million dollars WSSF has
budgeted this year from the U.S.
gets over there," Jorgensen said.
"It will be substance—food, roofs
over heads, and the most essential
need . . . books.
"You perhaps would not believe
it but they would rather have books
than food.
"I didn't come here to tell you
horror stories," he said. "But I tell
you only an average occurrence
when I tell you that an Italian girl
could go to school only every other
day last winter because she had to
share a lone, battered pair of shoes
with another girl.
In a world where drinking water
is, in some places, at a premium and
where students are lucky if they
can copy notes from microfilmed
books flashed against walls by lan
tern slide, there is not enough that
a Stanford student—or all the stu
dents in the United States—can do
or give, Bent Jorgensen said last
night.
