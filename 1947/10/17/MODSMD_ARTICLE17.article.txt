# SCHWARTZ JUGGLES UCLA GAME LINEUP
## Reserves, Even Jayvees Move Up to First String! 
### BILL ALLEN 
Stanford's winless Indians get their fourth chance of the
season tomorrow afternoon when they meet a heavily favored
UCLA team in the Stadium.
If the weather clears up, a crowd of some 30,000 is expected
to be on hand for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff. They will see a Stanford

lineup made over almost complete
ly because of injuries, and on the
basis of performances in the three
intensive days of scrimmages
through which Coach Marchie
Schwartz put his squad this week.
Five new names are listed in the
tentative starting lineup named by
Schwartz.
At left guard for the Indians will
be Bob Rohrer, switched last week
from end to guard and brought up
from the jayvee squad. Rohrer, an
aggressive 180-pounder, looked es
pecially impressive in scrimmage.
PLENTY OF NEW NAMES
Scheduled to start at right guard
is either Don Fix or Jack McKittrick.
At right tackle is Harry Ferris, cap
tain for the game. In the backfield
new faces are Dud DcGroot, Jr., an
other reserve who went well in
scrimmage, at right half, and Jack
Barnes at fullback.
These five will be joined by Whit
Budge at left tackle, Dick Flatland
at center, Dan Mcrvin, right end;
and in the other backfield spots, Al
Morris at quarter, and Bob Anderson
at left half. All of these men have
started in one or more of the Card
inals' first three games.
INJURY LIST LONG
If Gene Martin is sufficiently re
covered from a cold which has kept
him in bed part of the week, he will
be the starting left end. Otherwise
it will be Bob Ghilotti.
Stanford's discouragingly long cas
ualty list now includes two right,
guards, Marty Fcldman and Paul
Stremic; two right halfbacks, George
Quist and Mickey and two
fullbacks Jim Nafziger and Chuck
Coker. Also questionable are quar
terback Ainslie Bell and left guard
.Johnny Clark.
Coker and Stremic arc the most

recent additions to the wounded I
group. The former has a bad char
ley horse, while the latter has a knee
which has not responded to treat
ment as well as expected. Clark is
given the best chance of getting in
tomorrow's game.
BRUINS ARRIVE TODAY
UCLA's 42-man travelling team
is scheduled to arrive here this |
morning. They will stay at the'
Benjamin Franklin Hotel in San i
Mateo and plan to work out in the I
Stadium sometime today.
The Bruins, defending Coast Con
ference champions, have a record of
two won and one lost for the sea
son. Last week they polished off'

Oregon 24 to 7, in their first con
ference game.
A multitude of fast powerful backs
feature the titleholders' attack; an
attack which has brought Coach
Bert La Brueherie's charges <an av
erage of 24 points per game this
year.
Oniy one member of the three and
four deep baekfield is out of tomor
row's game, Chuck Page, right half.
Also out is Tom Fears, high-ranking
candidate for Ail-American honors
at end.
A wet field would hamper the
attack of both teams. The Uclans
depend on fast breaking, all-the
way plays, while the Cardinals have
banked heavily on their passing.

Budge at left tackle, Dick Flatland
at center, Dan Mcrvin, right end;
and in the other backfield spots, Al
Morris at quarter, and Bob Anderson
at left half. All of these men have
started in one or more of the Card
inals' first three games.
INJURY LIST LONG
If Gene Martin is sufficiently re
covered from a cold which has kept
him in bed part of the week, he will
be the starting left end. Otherwise
it will be Bob Ghilotti.
Stanford's discouragingly long cas
ualty list now includes two right,
guards, Marty Fcldman and Paul
Stremic; two right halfbacks, George
Quist and Mickey and two
fullbacks Jim Nafziger and Chuck
Coker. Also questionable are quar
terback Ainslie Bell and left guard
.Johnny Clark.
Coker and Stremic arc the most

recent additions to the wounded I
group. The former has a bad char
ley horse, while the latter has a knee
which has not responded to treat
ment as well as expected. Clark is
given the best chance of getting in
tomorrow's game.
BRUINS ARRIVE TODAY
UCLA's 42-man travelling team
is scheduled to arrive here this |
morning. They will stay at the'
Benjamin Franklin Hotel in San i
Mateo and plan to work out in the I
Stadium sometime today.
The Bruins, defending Coast Con
ference champions, have a record of
two won and one lost for the sea
son. Last week they polished off'

Oregon 24 to 7, in their first con
ference game.
A multitude of fast powerful backs
feature the titleholders' attack; an
attack which has brought Coach
Bert La Brueherie's charges <an av
erage of 24 points per game this
year.
Oniy one member of the three and
four deep baekfield is out of tomor
row's game, Chuck Page, right half.
Also out is Tom Fears, high-ranking
candidate for Ail-American honors
at end.
A wet field would hamper the
attack of both teams. The Uclans
depend on fast breaking, all-the
way plays, while the Cardinals have
banked heavily on their passing.
Stanford's winless Indians get their fourth chance of the
season tomorrow afternoon when they meet a heavily favored
UCLA team in the Stadium.
If the weather clears up, a crowd of some 30,000 is expected
to be on hand for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff. They will see a Stanford

lineup made over almost complete
ly because of injuries, and on the
basis of performances in the three
intensive days of scrimmages
through which Coach Marchie
Schwartz put his squad this week.
Five new names are listed in the
tentative starting lineup named by
Schwartz.
At left guard for the Indians will
be Bob Rohrer, switched last week
from end to guard and brought up
from the jayvee squad. Rohrer, an
aggressive 180-pounder, looked es
pecially impressive in scrimmage.
PLENTY OF NEW NAMES
Scheduled to start at right guard
is either Don Fix or Jack McKittrick.
At right tackle is Harry Ferris, cap
tain for the game. In the backfield
new faces are Dud DcGroot, Jr., an
other reserve who went well in
scrimmage, at right half, and Jack
Barnes at fullback.
These five will be joined by Whit
Budge at left tackle, Dick Flatland
at center, Dan Mcrvin, right end;
and in the other backfield spots, Al
Morris at quarter, and Bob Anderson
at left half. All of these men have
