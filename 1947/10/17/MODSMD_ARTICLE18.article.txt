# Opinions Differ On Marshall Plan
## 
### 
Split on many major issues, and
political implications, the five mem
bers of the AVC panel on the Mar
shall Plan in Cubberley Auditorium
last night, agreed in principle that,
there was a definite need in Europe
today, that assistance should be
forthcoming, and that internation
alization of the Ruhr, and German
Industry, should be a major part of
such a plan.
Although agreeing that the hu
manitarian principles of the plan
were fine, Mr. George Hitchcock
warned that: "our Foreign Policy is
now being run for investment bank
ers, and not for humanitarian prin
ciples; that a revitalized Germany
could prove to be equally as danger
ous to this generation as the last."
Hitchcock is an instructor of phil
osophy at California Labor School.
Portions of last night's AVC
panel on the Marshall Plan will
be re-I) road cast on KSU al 8
tonight.
Dr. Raymond Lawrence supported
the plan in principle and pointed out
that the gathering of 16 nations in
coordinated action in Western Eur
ope constituted a virtual revolution
in the diplomacy of states. He also
was firm in stating that we, the
American people, must divorce our
thinking on the Marshall "Ap
proach' from similar plans for short
term relief.
