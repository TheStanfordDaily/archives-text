•■SOCIAL PORTRAITS"
Two portraits by Thomas Law
icnce, neat seventeenth century
English painter, and Sir Peter Lily
typiiy the English tendency of
painting what is referred to as a
' orial portrait,"and not a person
alized portrait. In their paintings
cif noblemen one sees the subject's
■orial position, rather than his indi
viduality.
In the evolution of portraiture,
Ml i: ' have come to realize that
"the individual is more important
than hi social position." More mod
em examples of these can be ob
■ rved in two portraits of Evelyn
'i hompson by two different artists,
one impressionistic and the other in
conventional style. The first, by F.
W. B i.. man, pictures the girl of the
3930':; lacing a dark, dismal world
with a somber background of unful
filled dreams. The second, by Jan
ire Tworkov, has portrayed the girl
.several years earlier, still in prep
; hool, giving no thought to the out
side world.

personality; a self-portrait by Victor

Fanner, whose style seems to exhibit
an almost perfect brush technique.
Dating frorm the first and second
century A.D. are two "Egyptian
Mummy Paintings." Although they
; appear to have been done in oil,
they were actually painted with
I some kind of tempera, an opaque
I water color mixed with egg.
Full of personality and warmth
of character are the two family
j portrayals of the Quevadas. The one
i of the weathered old man is by Ram
irez, and the portrait of the old
[ woman by Gutierraz.

larshly down upon the students
