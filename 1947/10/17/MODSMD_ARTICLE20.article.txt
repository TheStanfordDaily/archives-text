# Dry Skiing Class Prepares for Action
## 
### 
"There were just too many skiing
accidents!" So Miss Luell Weed,
instructor in physical education,
decided to do something about it,
and in 1937 the first college dry .ski
ing class was started at Stanford.
"My idea was to condition the
skiers during fall so that they
would be better prepared for Yo
semite's first snow," Miss Weed said.
Straw was spread on ihe ground so
that rocks wouldn't injure the skis,
and 40 students started doing exer
cises which Miss Weed devised.
This year the class includes the
greenest beginners as well as some
very experienced Class A skiers. Tu
add tu the variety, it is one of the
Farm's few coeducational physical
education classes.

On rainy days the class retreats
into the gym to practice without
skis or listens to lectures on the
care of skis, skiing safety, races, ski
etiquette, and ski organizations.
Although not directly connected
with the Stanford Ski Club, the
class attends meetings in order to
see skiing movies which are shown.
Among the students who practice
jump turns, high turns, and tele
marks each Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon are Jim Brehler, captain
of this year's ski team; Margaret
Vorse, a Class A skier from Utah;
and Bartow File, a promising frosh
skier.
Since the dry skiing course was.
first initiated at Stanford 10 years
ago, interest has grown throughout

the country in similar courses. Nine
universities now have dry skiing
listed among their curricula.
Miss Weed, whose brain child
the course was, is publishing a
pamphlet this fall, "Coeducational
Skiing in Colleges and Universi
ties," which is now being litho
graphed by the Stanford press.
In answer to the question, "Has
the course prevented skiing acci
dents?" Miss Weed answers, "A
student who takes dry skiing fall
quarter will be better prepared, not
only by having conditioned himself
with exercises, but also will have
learned skills and precautions which
will be valuable to him in actual
skiing."


Miss Weed, originator of the plan for Stanford's dry skiing classes, is shown here adjusting the bindings
of one of her student's skis while the other girls look on to pick up some helpful pointers.
