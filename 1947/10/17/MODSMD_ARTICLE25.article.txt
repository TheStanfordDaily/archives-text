rest from the books.
Nine out of 12 wing presidents

social dance and smoker last week,
and the social committee will con

The Pajamarino committee will
meet soon to combine ideas which
will make the colorful show of
nightclothes a bigger and better af

last year, according to committee
chairman Dudley Kenworthy.
School spirit appeared to be at an
all-time high in the five-story sand
stone hall when the residents turned
out to display their vocal talents be
fore the Frosh coeds at Roble Wed

Tuesday evening's fire drill was
an example of the good cooperation

campus authorities. Fire Chief John
M. Marston told sponsor chairman
Don Corr that he was very pleased
with the results of the practice.

Corr plans to meet with the corri
dor presidents at 5 p.m. Monday for
a "bull-session," from which he
hopes to smooth out any rough spots
that have developed. Corr stated
"Although somewhat rigid control
has been kept on Encinu activities
so far by the sponsors, the latter
plan to grant, ihe freshmen more
and more self-rule as they become
fcetter acquainted with campus gov
ernment, customs and traditions."
The hall executive committee, to be
elected in November, will take over
completely sometime during the
winter quarter, Corr added.
