# Lagunita Voting Still Deadlocked
## 
### 
Voting for the post of Lagunita
Court secretary was still deadlocked
today, after the polls had been re
opened twice, according to Ellen
Magnin, elections chairman.
The first election saw none of the
candidates gain a majority, so the
two girls with the highest vote total,
Jane Allen and Nancy Ferguson,
were forced into a run-off election.
But at the end of that day's voting
they were tied. Polls were opened
again—and they tied again.
The issue will be settled today by
the drawing of lots, the Lagunita
Steering committee decided. Both
girls are equally well qualified for
the position, committee members felt,
and therefore agreed that the only
way the contest could be settled
fairly was by lot.
