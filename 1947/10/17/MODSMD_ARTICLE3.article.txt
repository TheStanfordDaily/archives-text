Music for the ATO "Hog Wallow"

son, chairman. "This will probably
be Bender's last appearance on the
Stanford campus."
Plaid shirts and levi's are proper

continued. "But anything will do

. . . burlap sack, even a dark suit
or tux." Richardson, however, cau

the Fundamental Standard.
Bids for the dance are not neces

Richardson added; "everyone is in
vited, and it is free." .
Sigma Nu will present Les Brown

appearance on the Stanford campus,
stated dance chairman Bob Long
well.
Men should wear either suits or

The SAE's will present Charles
Sabelle and his orchestra, a five

ace Hotel; and food will be served
to hungry rooters, said Jim Brett,
social chairman. It is an open house;
the whole campus is invited and it's

The SAE's are trying to start
something new in football season
open houses, said Brett. Hours have
been arranged so that students may
attend other campus dances later
in the evening.
The Lathrop girls promise warm
welcomes to all Stanford students
and visitors from Bruin-land. "We
have the prettiest gals on campus
and they are all sure anxious to be
friendly," Ginny Titus, Lathrop
chairman, admitted last night.
"We've got refreshments, too,"
she said.
