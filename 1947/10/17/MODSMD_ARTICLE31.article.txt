# Angry Rooters, Furious Frosh; Excom Problems, Then & Now
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
It might be the Cardinal forever today, but had the first Excom
had its way fifty-six years ago, the loyal sons and daughters of
fair Stanford might be singing the glories of the "purple and
gold."
Wednesday night Excom busied itself with the problem of

non-chartered organizations; on Oct. !
23, 1891, the first meeting of the
group debated the school colors. Ex
com approved the choice of purple
and gold, but later rallied to the
choice of the whole university when
dissident groups appeared at the
first football game waving Cardinal
Ked handkerchiefs.
FRESHMAN OBJECTORS
The freshmen petitioned Excom
for an election change last week;
President Charles Chadsey and his
new Excom of 1891 had their tribu
lations with the freshmen too.
Stanford's proposed constitution
had a clause debarring freshmen
from holding office. When the frosh
heard of this restriction, they walked
out of an Excom meeting in a body,
only to return later to vote out the
objectionable clause.
Stanford has not always enjoyed
Ihe amount of self-government it
now possesses. Even with the func
tioning of an Excom, student con
trol at first meant just freedom from
faculty control in matters of per
sonal conduct.
WOMEN JUDICIAL COUNCIL
The women of Stanford started
the move for self-government in
1911 when they set up a student ju
dicial council to try women. The
first case before the Judicial Board
of Women's Conference was that of
a young woman swearing. A men's
judicial council followed shortly.
The nation has its Congress, Stan
ford has its Executive Committee
composed of student. legislators
elected from each of the 12 Excom
districts plus one graduate member
and student officers.
BASIS OE REPRESENTATION
Representation on Excom was
formerly based on classes, but when
class lines became indistinct in 1945
a referendum changed membership
to living group representation.
Excom controls a great number of

subsidiary organizations with their
power lying mainly in its right to
approve or disapprove disbursement
of ASSU funds, to amend the ASSU
constitution, and to review the policy
] of its committees.
Members' duties are to gather the
reaction and suggestions of students
j living in their areas to proposed
legislation. All students are invited
to attend the open meetings to voice
their opinions or make recomrnenda-
I lions for action.

choice of the whole university when
dissident groups appeared at the
first football game waving Cardinal
Ked handkerchiefs.
FRESHMAN OBJECTORS
The freshmen petitioned Excom
for an election change last week;
President Charles Chadsey and his
new Excom of 1891 had their tribu
lations with the freshmen too.
Stanford's proposed constitution
had a clause debarring freshmen
from holding office. When the frosh
heard of this restriction, they walked
out of an Excom meeting in a body,
only to return later to vote out the
objectionable clause.
Stanford has not always enjoyed
Ihe amount of self-government it
now possesses. Even with the func
tioning of an Excom, student con
trol at first meant just freedom from
faculty control in matters of per
sonal conduct.
WOMEN JUDICIAL COUNCIL
The women of Stanford started
the move for self-government in
1911 when they set up a student ju
dicial council to try women. The
first case before the Judicial Board
of Women's Conference was that of
a young woman swearing. A men's
judicial council followed shortly.
The nation has its Congress, Stan
ford has its Executive Committee
composed of student. legislators
elected from each of the 12 Excom
districts plus one graduate member
and student officers.
BASIS OE REPRESENTATION
Representation on Excom was
formerly based on classes, but when
class lines became indistinct in 1945
a referendum changed membership
to living group representation.
Excom controls a great number of

subsidiary organizations with their
power lying mainly in its right to
approve or disapprove disbursement
of ASSU funds, to amend the ASSU
constitution, and to review the policy
] of its committees.
Members' duties are to gather the
reaction and suggestions of students
j living in their areas to proposed
legislation. All students are invited
to attend the open meetings to voice
their opinions or make recomrnenda-
I lions for action.
It might be the Cardinal forever today, but had the first Excom
had its way fifty-six years ago, the loyal sons and daughters of
fair Stanford might be singing the glories of the "purple and
gold."
Wednesday night Excom busied itself with the problem of

non-chartered organizations; on Oct. !
23, 1891, the first meeting of the
group debated the school colors. Ex
com approved the choice of purple
and gold, but later rallied to the
choice of the whole university when
dissident groups appeared at the
first football game waving Cardinal
Ked handkerchiefs.
