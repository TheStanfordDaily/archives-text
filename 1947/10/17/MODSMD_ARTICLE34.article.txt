# Paid Food Tasters Enjoy Stanford Lab Research
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Would you like to be paid for eat
ing? (
Or does being paid three hours
wages for ten minutes' work appeal
to you?
Such jobs are not limited to the
son-in-law of the bank president,
but are open to any Palo Alto or
Stanford housewife with a "taste
that is not too dull and an imagina
tion that is not too vivid."
The quote is that of William E.
Rand, assistant director of the Food
Laboratory of the Stanford Research
Institute; the job is that of a food
taster.
PEA SOUP AND BEANS
The institute, the first of its kind
on the West Coast, will concern itself
with the kind of pea soup preferred
by housewives in Menlo Park or the
taste of Walla Walla citizens as to
preference in canned string beans.
This week marks the beginning
of Stnford's "Gallup poll of food,"
a survey which will tabulate the
tastes of gourmets up and down the
West Coast. The first year will
primarily be devoted to research, and
no attempt will be made, at first, to
get a perfect cross-section of the
country's eaters.
200 APPLICANTS
Subjects for the laboratory's first
project will be housewives who will
determine the difference between
various frozen foods.
From the 200 applicants, Rand will
choose approximately 50 housewife
testers. These women, divided into
panels of 15, will work in three
hour shifts.
On questionnaires, these women
will list their preference as to color,
texture, odor, and flavor of speci
fied foods. For example, housewives
will compare three varieties of

frozen strawberries one hour, and
three varieties of sour pickles the
next.
TEN MINUTES' WORK
The spicier the food tested, the
longer the rest period between ex
periments, according to Rand. In
fact, a woman may be in the labora
tory three hours, but actually work
at tasting only ten minutes of this
time.
This non-profit organization has
been instituted to determine poten
tial markets for canners or produc
ers. The foods laboratory saves the
company the cost of going out to the
consumers themselves. However,
the producer must pay all expenses
incurred by the testing lab.
"We're not always going to use
housewives for our experiments,"
Rand stated. "In fact, the university
itself can provide us with a wide
range of students from different
geographical regions. The only
problem is that the majority of
Stanford's students are from the
same age and income level."
FRESH FOOD NEXT
The lab will, during Its outset,
concern itself primarily with frozen
and canned foods, and it will be
some time before it will investigate
fresh food.
A full time psychologist, physiol
ogist, and dietician are employed by
the laboratory.
The fact that Westerners prefer
their tomato juice more sweetened
than Easterners may not change the
course of national progress, but it
does help provide the American con
sumer with the right product at the
right place.

UUman prepare the food that will be sampled by a panel of 15 Palo Alto
and Stanford housewives. It's part of Stanford's Food Acceptance
program to determine preferences in canned, frozen, and fresh foods.

Rand stated. "In fact, the university
itself can provide us with a wide
range of students from different
geographical regions. The only
problem is that the majority of
Stanford's students are from the
same age and income level."
FRESH FOOD NEXT
The lab will, during Its outset,
concern itself primarily with frozen
and canned foods, and it will be
some time before it will investigate
fresh food.
A full time psychologist, physiol
ogist, and dietician are employed by
the laboratory.
The fact that Westerners prefer
their tomato juice more sweetened
than Easterners may not change the
course of national progress, but it
does help provide the American con
sumer with the right product at the
right place.


Just testing! Lab assistant Dorothy Jameson and Dietician Phjiis
UUman prepare the food that will be sampled by a panel of 15 Palo Alto
and Stanford housewives. It's part of Stanford's Food Acceptance
program to determine preferences in canned, frozen, and fresh foods.
Would you like to be paid for eat
ing? (
Or does being paid three hours
wages for ten minutes' work appeal
to you?
Such jobs are not limited to the
son-in-law of the bank president,
but are open to any Palo Alto or
Stanford housewife with a "taste
that is not too dull and an imagina
tion that is not too vivid."
The quote is that of William E.
Rand, assistant director of the Food
Laboratory of the Stanford Research
Institute; the job is that of a food
taster.
PEA SOUP AND BEANS
The institute, the first of its kind
on the West Coast, will concern itself
with the kind of pea soup preferred
by housewives in Menlo Park or the
taste of Walla Walla citizens as to
preference in canned string beans.
This week marks the beginning
of Stnford's "Gallup poll of food,"
a survey which will tabulate the
tastes of gourmets up and down the
West Coast. The first year will
primarily be devoted to research, and
no attempt will be made, at first, to
get a perfect cross-section of the
country's eaters.
200 APPLICANTS
Subjects for the laboratory's first
project will be housewives who will
determine the difference between
various frozen foods.
From the 200 applicants, Rand will
choose approximately 50 housewife
testers. These women, divided into
panels of 15, will work in three
hour shifts.
On questionnaires, these women
will list their preference as to color,
texture, odor, and flavor of speci
fied foods. For example, housewives
will compare three varieties of

frozen strawberries one hour, and
three varieties of sour pickles the
next.
TEN MINUTES' WORK
The spicier the food tested, the
longer the rest period between ex
periments, according to Rand. In
fact, a woman may be in the labora
tory three hours, but actually work
at tasting only ten minutes of this
time.
This non-profit organization has
been instituted to determine poten
tial markets for canners or produc
ers. The foods laboratory saves the
company the cost of going out to the
consumers themselves. However,
the producer must pay all expenses
incurred by the testing lab.
"We're not always going to use
housewives for our experiments,"
Rand stated. "In fact, the university
itself can provide us with a wide
range of students from different
geographical regions. The only
problem is that the majority of
Stanford's students are from the
