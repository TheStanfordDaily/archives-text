Stanford Debating Society Wednes
day night voted to accept the af
firmative of the resolution 'that
this house favors a federal world
government."
Affirmative speaker Robert Ben
nett asked those present to bear
with his idealism, quoted the late
Justice Brandeis, and outlined the
functions that he feels a federal
world government must have.
According to Bennett, this gov
ernment should be an international
body which could control interna
tional trade, monetary supply, in
ternational armament, and would
have the power of taxation to per
petuate itself economically. And it
should have the power to create, in
terpret, and enforce its laws, he said.
Ronald P. Klein chose not to op
pose the resolution, but merely to
offer an amendment to it.
Klein's amendment was that the
proposal be accepted at such time
"when and if all major existing po
litical and social systems show in
dication of compromise and com
mon ground has been established
among them.
The amendment was debated at
length and later was defeated.
