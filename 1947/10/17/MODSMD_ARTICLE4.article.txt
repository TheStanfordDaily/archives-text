# Green Heads AFL 24th Time Despite Bitter Lewis Boycott
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO'. Oct. 16 (UP).—
The AFL wound up its 6(sth annual
convention today after re-electing
President William Green for his 24th
term despite a bitter boycott, by
Mine-Worker's president John L.
j Lewis that climaxed one of the
worst inter-organization splits in 11
j years.
The vitriolic Mine - Worker's
! chieftain bolted the executive coun
j cil and sulked in his hotel room
j while for the first time since he took
i up with the AFL a union other than
I the United Mine Workers nominated
the aging Green. The convention
! delegates unanimously voted Green
| into the presidency.
Whether the bushy-browed mine
worker's boss had decided to per
! manently walk out of the AFL, as
he did little more than a decade ago
in the fight over the CIO, was not
known. A spokesman close to Lewis
1 said he had not. At any rate, the
I UMW could not take a walk with
out ratification of their national
i convention next October in Cleve
j land.
But Lewis was definitely no longer
a member of the AFL executive
council. Replacing him by council
vote was Dan Tracy, president of the
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and former assistant secretary of
I labor.
He reportedly late today was still
in high dudgeon over the shellack
ing he took from AFL Secretary-
Treasurer George Meany who led
the fight to whip Lewis and put over
! a constitutional amendment that
| stripped the mine boss and 12 other
vice-presidents of their titles.
Lewis had announced two days
ago that he would not be a candidate
for the executive council if that
happened. The convention floor had
j done just that, voting in the execu
, tive council's amendment so that

290,000 members of federal unions
could obtain the services of the
National Labor Relations Board.
Had Lewis remained on the coun
cil as a vice-president, the Taft-
Hartley Act, requiring all union of
ficers to file non-communist affi
davits, would have prevented federal
unions from appealing to the NLRB.

SAN FRANCISCO'. Oct. 16 (UP).—
The AFL wound up its 6(sth annual
convention today after re-electing
President William Green for his 24th
term despite a bitter boycott, by
Mine-Worker's president John L.
j Lewis that climaxed one of the
worst inter-organization splits in 11
j years.
The vitriolic Mine - Worker's
! chieftain bolted the executive coun
j cil and sulked in his hotel room
j while for the first time since he took
i up with the AFL a union other than
I the United Mine Workers nominated
the aging Green. The convention
! delegates unanimously voted Green
| into the presidency.
Whether the bushy-browed mine
worker's boss had decided to per
! manently walk out of the AFL, as
he did little more than a decade ago
in the fight over the CIO, was not
known. A spokesman close to Lewis
1 said he had not. At any rate, the
I UMW could not take a walk with
out ratification of their national
i convention next October in Cleve
j land.
But Lewis was definitely no longer
a member of the AFL executive
council. Replacing him by council
vote was Dan Tracy, president of the
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and former assistant secretary of
I labor.
He reportedly late today was still
in high dudgeon over the shellack
ing he took from AFL Secretary-
Treasurer George Meany who led
the fight to whip Lewis and put over
! a constitutional amendment that
| stripped the mine boss and 12 other
vice-presidents of their titles.
Lewis had announced two days
ago that he would not be a candidate
for the executive council if that
happened. The convention floor had
j done just that, voting in the execu
, tive council's amendment so that

290,000 members of federal unions
could obtain the services of the
National Labor Relations Board.
Had Lewis remained on the coun
cil as a vice-president, the Taft-
Hartley Act, requiring all union of
ficers to file non-communist affi
davits, would have prevented federal
unions from appealing to the NLRB.
