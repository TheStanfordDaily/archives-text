# Bruins 'Easy Bait' For Cards of Old
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
The UCLA Bruin as of today has grown up into a horrendous package
of football meanness that contrasts with "(hose days of satisfaction which
found Stanford continually kicking the Bruins to death.
It started in 1925, Pop Warner's Farm hands facing the charges of Bill
Spaulding. Cagey Pop started an "all-Southern California line-up which
paraded before the stadium to the tune of 82 points for Stanford, none for
UCLA.
Series relations were severed until 1028 when the Cards again domi
nated the Bruins, 45 to 7. A pair of hard-charging guards—Seraphim Post
;ind Don Robesky were largely responsible for one ol the strongest Indian
teams in history, a Rose Bowl squad, no less, which humbled mighty Pitts
burgh 7 to (5 on New Year's Day.
loop's Teams Were Oh So (*oo<l
And again, in 11)29 and 19:50, the Stanford production toppled the Uclans,
57 to 0 and 20 to 0, respectively.
Wily Bill Spaulding, who was later to build the Bruins into a big-time
organization, was heard to remark on the 29 thumping:
"Holy mackerel, what can a guy do against Pop's team? Thank good
ness, we don't play them more than once a season.'
The inevitable was fashioned in 19152 when Bre'r Bruin up and defeated
Stanford 13 to (i on the strength of two blocked kicks. Tackle Clay Yearick
smothered the second kick, which was later converted into a TD via a
one-yard plunge by Walt Clark.
During the reign of the Vow Boys, the Cards were tagged with a 7 to (i
loss iii 1935, thanks to the sudden appearance of "a mystery man" named
Ted Key. Mr. Key, later reported to be a wrestler and man of odd jobs,
scored the seven points that nearly cost the Cards a Rose Bowl fracas.

In 19119, the two teams struggled to a 14 to 14 tie, the game being
heralded as a battle between Stanford's Frankie Albert and Norm Standlee
against fleet Jackie Robinson. Needless to say, the Bruins took advantage
of several Redskin mishaps to deadlock the over-confident Injuns.
The ye.y Clark Daniel Shaughnessy came to Palo Alto, he look the
worst team in the West and directed an undefeated season with even the
surly Bruin falling by the wayside, 20 to 14. The Alberts, Banduccis,
Standlees, Gallarneaus, and Lindskogs did the trick.
In '41, minus Standlee and Gallarneau, the Cards routed the Southern
ers, 33 to 0, as easily as a Liszt rhapsody being played by a man named
Liszt. Albert had a great day and Pistol Pete Kmetovic was never better
as shouts of "On to the Rose Bowl" struck the Farm,
(Jrlans Roar Into llie Arroyo of llie Roses
But the Bruins, hardened by interminable beatings and abuses, arose
with a vengeance in the '42 campaign, with Bobby Waterfield providing
the sparkle and a strong right aerial whip to down the locals, 21 to 7.
Time had indeed changed! The Uclans sailed into the "arroyo of the
roses" with speed to spare.
The time: last year. The place: the Los Angeles Coliseum. And Stan
ford, with lopsided wins over Idaho and USF, was faced with Bert La-
Brucherie's zenith-scoring Bruins.
It was Ernie Johnson, the Sacramento Flyer, who sailed into the In
dians like a man possessed. He ran eight yards around left end for a score
in the first four minutes of play, and later passed to End Roy Kurrasch
for the second marker.
Mammoth Jerry Shipkey and an Ernie Case to Burr Baldwin to Kur
rasch forward and lateral combo were registered for the benefit of the
"hometown crowd" which numbered 89,000.
Fullback Lloyd Merriman scored for the Indians, who wound up on the
short end of a 2(5 to (5 setback.
Horrendous Itruins Overpower Li 1 Injun
The experts were claiming the "Bruins were too good." They had
posted 50 to 7 and 39 to 13 wins over Oregon State and Washington, and
they talked of roses, Pasadena vintage, as no other Bruin squad had done
in years.
The fabulous Baldwin, who caught six out of seven passes thrown by
Quarterback Case, was awarded national "Linesman of the Week" honors.
And tomorrow, both teams will meet for the eighteenth time, the Cards
having a statistical advantage of having won 11 and being tied once. Stan
lord has scored 3(59 points to the Westwood aggregate of 127 points.
Ol interest to some 30.000 of the curious tomorrow will be the first
appearance ol former Card back Al Hoisch on the Stanford arena since
transferring to the Westwood institution during the war years.

And again, in 11)29 and 19:50, the Stanford production toppled the Uclans,
57 to 0 and 20 to 0, respectively.
Wily Bill Spaulding, who was later to build the Bruins into a big-time
organization, was heard to remark on the 29 thumping:
"Holy mackerel, what can a guy do against Pop's team? Thank good
ness, we don't play them more than once a season.'
The inevitable was fashioned in 19152 when Bre'r Bruin up and defeated
Stanford 13 to (i on the strength of two blocked kicks. Tackle Clay Yearick
smothered the second kick, which was later converted into a TD via a
one-yard plunge by Walt Clark.
During the reign of the Vow Boys, the Cards were tagged with a 7 to (i
loss iii 1935, thanks to the sudden appearance of "a mystery man" named
Ted Key. Mr. Key, later reported to be a wrestler and man of odd jobs,
scored the seven points that nearly cost the Cards a Rose Bowl fracas.

In 19119, the two teams struggled to a 14 to 14 tie, the game being
heralded as a battle between Stanford's Frankie Albert and Norm Standlee
against fleet Jackie Robinson. Needless to say, the Bruins took advantage
of several Redskin mishaps to deadlock the over-confident Injuns.
The ye.y Clark Daniel Shaughnessy came to Palo Alto, he look the
worst team in the West and directed an undefeated season with even the
surly Bruin falling by the wayside, 20 to 14. The Alberts, Banduccis,
Standlees, Gallarneaus, and Lindskogs did the trick.
In '41, minus Standlee and Gallarneau, the Cards routed the Southern
ers, 33 to 0, as easily as a Liszt rhapsody being played by a man named
Liszt. Albert had a great day and Pistol Pete Kmetovic was never better
as shouts of "On to the Rose Bowl" struck the Farm,
(Jrlans Roar Into llie Arroyo of llie Roses
But the Bruins, hardened by interminable beatings and abuses, arose
with a vengeance in the '42 campaign, with Bobby Waterfield providing
the sparkle and a strong right aerial whip to down the locals, 21 to 7.
Time had indeed changed! The Uclans sailed into the "arroyo of the
roses" with speed to spare.
The time: last year. The place: the Los Angeles Coliseum. And Stan
ford, with lopsided wins over Idaho and USF, was faced with Bert La-
Brucherie's zenith-scoring Bruins.
It was Ernie Johnson, the Sacramento Flyer, who sailed into the In
dians like a man possessed. He ran eight yards around left end for a score
in the first four minutes of play, and later passed to End Roy Kurrasch
for the second marker.
Mammoth Jerry Shipkey and an Ernie Case to Burr Baldwin to Kur
rasch forward and lateral combo were registered for the benefit of the
"hometown crowd" which numbered 89,000.
Fullback Lloyd Merriman scored for the Indians, who wound up on the
short end of a 2(5 to (5 setback.
Horrendous Itruins Overpower Li 1 Injun
The experts were claiming the "Bruins were too good." They had
posted 50 to 7 and 39 to 13 wins over Oregon State and Washington, and
they talked of roses, Pasadena vintage, as no other Bruin squad had done
in years.
The fabulous Baldwin, who caught six out of seven passes thrown by
Quarterback Case, was awarded national "Linesman of the Week" honors.
And tomorrow, both teams will meet for the eighteenth time, the Cards
having a statistical advantage of having won 11 and being tied once. Stan
lord has scored 3(59 points to the Westwood aggregate of 127 points.
Ol interest to some 30.000 of the curious tomorrow will be the first
appearance ol former Card back Al Hoisch on the Stanford arena since
transferring to the Westwood institution during the war years.
The UCLA Bruin as of today has grown up into a horrendous package
of football meanness that contrasts with "(hose days of satisfaction which
found Stanford continually kicking the Bruins to death.
It started in 1925, Pop Warner's Farm hands facing the charges of Bill
Spaulding. Cagey Pop started an "all-Southern California line-up which
paraded before the stadium to the tune of 82 points for Stanford, none for
UCLA.
Series relations were severed until 1028 when the Cards again domi
nated the Bruins, 45 to 7. A pair of hard-charging guards—Seraphim Post
