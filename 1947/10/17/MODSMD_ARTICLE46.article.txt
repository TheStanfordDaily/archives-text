# Farm Soccerites Scramble With JC Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
The curtain will be drawn on the
Farm's 11)47 soccer season tomorrow
morning at 10 a.m. when the local
lads meet San Francisco Junior Col
lege on the soccer field across the
street from the Encina Gym.
Coach Dave Tappan's Stanford
squad will enter its season opener
without advance information as to
their opponents' strength or weak
nesses. This encounter will also be
the first game of the year for the
invading Junior Collegians.
While most coaches would decry
the fact that their present starting
team carries only four returning vet
erans, Tappan figures that his pres
ent aggregation will be much strong
er than last year's conference sec
ond placers. A wealth of transfers
and new turnouts are given as the
basis for this feeling of strength.
The four men who will start to
morrow's contest wo played on last
year's squad are Randy Hudson, Pat
McDannell, Tony Ortega, and Ri
cardo Trejos. Hudson will be the
goalie. McDonnell plays from the
right fullback slot, while Ortega and
Trejos are stationed in the five man
forward line.
Godfrey Gregg, who played for
California before the war, will han
dle the chores of the other fullback.
The three halfback posts will be cov
ered by newcomers in the persons of
Charles Hirsch, David Blumberg,
194G captain of the University of
Chicago's soccer team, and Ted Belk
nap, a transfer from Western Re
serve College.
The remaining three forwards, in
addition to Trejos and Ortega, are
Stanley Hodge, Don Salvador, and
Edward Wasson. Wasson played his
last soccer at Princeton University.
Tomorrow's tilt will be the first
of a schedule that will see Stanford
playing each Saturday for the next
seven weeks. Tappan's shinkickers
of last year found themselves in the
runner up position behind Califor
nia. Other members of the league
are San Jose State, San Francisco
J.C., University of San Francisco,
San Mateo J.C., Cal Aggies, and
San Francisco State.
