# Mighty Uclans Have Arrived! Promise to Annihilate Indians; Hope for 'Reverse Rose Bowl'
## 
### ART LUBIC 
If you hear a mighty rumble this morning it's probably
UCLA's shaggy Bruins, 42-strong, setting up their advanced bat
tle station in San Mateo. Coach Fifi Laßrucherie's musclemen,
trained up from Westwood last night for their football match with
the local Indians tomorrow.
The Southlander's are reportedly "out for Bear" but, fortun-

ately for Marchmont Schwartz's
stalwarts, it's that upstart Berkeley
Bear from across the creek. While
Laßruch sends his men through the
motions on the Stanford greensward
his entire scouting staff will be
paiked in Cal Stadium with pad and
pencil eyeing the Glolden Bear-
Washington State proceedings. Con
versely, Pappy Waldorf will prob
ably have a slew of inside men on
hand here.
The Uclans did come up for a foot
ball game. Although bemoaning the
fact that All-American end candi
date Tom Fears will sit this one
out and guard Les Steiner and half
back Chuck Page are on the "in
jured but available" list, the Bruins
will enter the game a rather sub
stantial favorite.
UCLANS HAVE CiOOD RECORD
Here's a brief recap on UCLA's
record to date:
First game: defeated Big Nine
darkhorse lowa 22-7—after a leth
argic first half the Bruins came to
life with three touchdowns and a
field goal in the second chapter to
swamp the Hawkeyes.
Sccond game: upset by Big Nine
doormat Northwestern 27-26 in one
of the year's big surprises—the La-
Brucheries were run off the field
by an inspired Wildcat eleven which
chalked up two long TD runs and
a 50 yard pass play plus some able
conversion booting to tumble the
Westwooders.
Third game: waltzed over Oregon
24-7 —here's where the third-string
ers saw , much action with Jerry
Shipkey and Skip Rowland on the
sidelines.
The well-balanced Bruins are
three-deep in talent at every corner
Nevertheless Northwestern rele
gated UCLA into the background
and enabled Cal and USC to step up
for their share of the limelight.
CAN BE BEATEN
That the Uclans can be beaten is
a certainty—lllinois proved that in
conclusive fashion on New Year's
Day and Northwestern backed 'em
up. Bui whether a Stanford eleven
beaten three times can do the trick

is another question.
Two apparent reasons for UCLA's
hot-and-colcl showing this year are
Ernie Case and Don Paul. La Bru
cherie misses his able All-American
field general who not only went
through the motions of his position
with precision but was a heady guy
to boot. Paul, one of the top centers
in the nation last year, is the life
blood of the UCLA line. With husky
Don in there the Bruins seem to
hold—but when he's out that last
word becomes fold.
In the backfield Laßrucherie has
a trio of T-merchants filling Case's
shoes. Thus far only a hair has sep
arated the abilities of Bennie "Punt
er" Reiges, Carl "Passer" Benton,
and Roy "Spark" Nagel.
PLENTY OF SPEEDSTERS
Left half is the speed burner de
partment and there's Gene Rowland,
A 1 Hoisch, Johnny Roesch, and Er
nie Johnson all ready to roll. Don't
shudder, but Hoisch has picked up
110 yards in 11 tries, Johnson 58 in
4 attempts, and Rowland had an 80
yard run called back and returned
six punts, a total of 100 yards, in the
Oregon game.
At right half are 1945 All-Coaster
Cal Rossi and former SC fullback
Chuck Page. And the fullbacks are
Jerry Shipkey, Jack ' Moose" My
ers, and Jerry Whitney. Shipkey
dislocated a thumb, missing the
Webfoot tilt, but is ready for to
morrow.
Starting with the line the ends
come first — with so much depth
and talent All-Americans Burr
Baldwin and Roy Kurrasch are
hardly missed. Tom Fears will be
Ihe bench but Bill Hoyt, Phil Tins
ley (1944 Georgia Tech A-A), Bill
Clement, and Dave Dobro will hold
the fort.
Don Malmberg is missing from
'4(> but West Matthews, Bill Cham
bers, George "Porky" Pastre, and
Bob Mike are still around to man
the tackle slots.
Mike Dimitro, John Nickcevich,
Les Stainer, and A! Capp are the
top guards and Don Paul and Leon
McLaughlin will handle the pivot.
