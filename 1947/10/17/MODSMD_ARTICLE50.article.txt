Slippery fields, hobbled passes, nnd
bad breaks marked yesterday after
noon's intramural games.
In the feature contest of the af
ternoon Sigma Nu broke a 0 to 0
deadlock to whip a determined Phi
Kappa Sig team (J to 0. Long passes
and a tricky offense kept the Sigma
Nu team deep in Phi Kappa Sig
territory most of the game and late
in the second half a long pass from
Bob Theed to Jack Wood gave them
their winning tally.
The Sigma Nu outfit, relying on
hlocking backs Herb Johnson and
Bill Edlund, were able to register
gains on end runs. Twice, during
the course of the fracas, the victors
punched over two touchdowns, but
in both cases the referee, who seem
ed somewhat confused about the
exact location of the end zone, re
fused to call them tallies.
The lone Phi Kappa Sig scoring
threat came in the second half when
Dick Brewer fired a series of short
passes to Ronnie Funk, but the
aerial drive finally fizzled inside the
Sigma Nu ten yard line, the last
pass falling dead in the end zone.

In a game featured by fumbles and
incompleted passes the Kappa Al
phas and Village 312 battled on even
terms for almost forty minutes. In
the closing seconds of the tilt, Curt
Tarr, Kappa Alpha, nailed a vil
lager behind the goal line, to give
the KA seven a 2 to 0 win. A muddy
field slowed down both teams and
the men had a rough time staying on
two feet.
In a third contest, Carlisle Bar
ringer, Myles Chute, Norman Nourse,
Ben Brundred, and A 1 Kircher
passed and ran the powerful Deke
seven to a 27 to 0 victory over Vil
lage 119, scoring in both stanzas of
the game.
In another scheduled fray the
Alpha Delts won over a late-showing
Encina 2W team by virtue of a for
feit. This is in accordannce with the
previously announced ruling that
all teams must be ready to play ball
at the designated time. The first
games start at four and the night
caps begin at five.
