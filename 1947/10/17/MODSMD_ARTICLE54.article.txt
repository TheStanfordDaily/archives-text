# '51 Footballers Off for LA To Scrap with Trobabes
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
The Farm's freshman football
squad, 33 men strong, entrains for
Los Angeles this afternon at 12:15
for tomorrow's all-important game
with USC's powerful Trobabe
eleven. The battle is scheduled to
get under way at 11 a.m. in the
huge Los Angeles Coliseum as a
preliminary to the crucial Oregon
State-USC conference tilt.
Arriving in Los Angeles at 9:30
night, the frosh will be quartered at
the Roosevelt Hotel during their
stay there. The team is expected to
arrive back in Palo Alto at 5:30
Sunday evening.
Frosh coach Chuck Taylor is
pleased with the spirited showing of
the yearlings this past week. The
popular mentor plans to start prac
tically the same team which took
the field in the victory over Santa
Clara two weeks ago. Two possible
changes in the first eleven may be
made at the left tackle and right
end positions.
Gordon White, powerful regular
tackle, and an all - stater from
Houston, Texas, is still injured and
it is doubtful whether he'll be able
to start against the Trobabes. In
«is absence, John Poulson will be
moved up. Bob Scott, massive 6 ft,
4 in. right end, has looked so im
pressive in recent scrimmages that
he may be moved up to receive the
starting call at that position.
Taylor has announced that the
following men will make the trip:
Ends — Schulze, Vasilatos, Watkin
son, Echman, Scott, August, and
Wallace; tackles — White, Harder,
Watters, Beeger, and Poulson;
guards — Lucas, Galvin, Paulson,
Hunt, Hagen, and Pinnotti; centers
—Abraham and Chez; quarterbacks
—Buck and Shaw; halfbacks—Ben
son, Odneal, Holloway, Nielson,
Banks, Hayes, and Boucher; full
backs — MacLachlan, Altick, Puck
et t, and Dodson.
