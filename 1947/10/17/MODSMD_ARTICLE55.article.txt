# Heavy Scores Indicated For Coast Contests
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16 (UP).
—Man the dikes, men, and get ready
for the biggest touchdown parade
of the season this weekend!
California and UCLA, two of the
West Coast's gridiron behemoths,
draw their weakest opposition of
the season and when the counting is
over for the day there may be some
scoring records set.
One that may turn into a lop-
Jed affair is the Nevada - St.
Mary's encounter at Kezar in San
Francisco on Sunday. The Wolf
pack, starved for a victory over the
Gaels for many years, are primed
for this one and come off victories
over Oregon and Portland Univer
sity in their last two outings.
On the other side of the ledger,
there are promises of some close
contests, too. The USC vs. Oregon
State clash, which highlights the
day's card, promises to be close—
and the scoring for the winning
team probably will be under 20
points.
Up in the north country in an
other Pacific Coast Conference clash
Washington meets Oregon at Port
land in their traditional encounter.
The Huskies are the favorites and,
given a good turf, may have quite
an edge on the Webfeet.
Among the other encounters that
should be close are: Santa Clara at
College of Pacific, Montana U. vs.
Montana State College at Butte;
USF at Marquette, and Hawaiian
All-Stars at Fresno State.
Saturday games: Portland at Ida
ho, Pomona at Laverne, Occidental
al San Diego State, Cal Aggies at
Whiltier, San Francisco State at Cal
Poly, Eastern Washington at St.
Martin's, Western Washington at
Pacific Lutheran, British Columbia
at Willamette, College of Puget
Sound at Whitman. Pacific at Lin
field, College of Idaho at Eastern
Oregon, Arizona at Texas Mines,
Oregon College at Southern Oregon.
