RICHMOND SURREY. En?., Oct.
1G (UP). —Members of the British
Ryder cup team, with the exception
of little Charley Ward, revealed
today that they will remain in the
United States after the cup matches
at Portland, Ore., Nov. 1 and 2, to
take a crack at the golfing gold
along America's winter golfing trail.
The lure of dollars, as well as pres
tige and experience and a "go at
American food" are the chief baits
which will keep the British players
in the U.S. But at the same time,
they said that if they cannot earn
expenses, they will have to cut their
stay short because of the govern
ment restrictions on the amount of
currency they can take with them.
Most of the British golfers, in
cluding Capt. Henry Cotton and Dai
Rees, will enter the winter tourneys
in the hope of earning enough money
to keep them in the States, but Fred
Daly hopes also to capitalize on his
British open title by lining up ex
hibition matches.
Their decision to try for the win
ter circuit dollars in the U.S. came
after their final practice matches
today in which they defeated a
team of the Oxford and Cambridge
Golfing Society, which included
two former British amateur cham
pions, Robert Sweeny and Cyril
Tolley, nine matches to four with
two halved. The British team will
sail on the Queen Mary Saturday.
