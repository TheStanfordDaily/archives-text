# HUSKIES PREP FOR DUCKS
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”Coach
Ralph Welch started to work his
University of Washington Huskies
indoors today, but quickly moved
them outdoors into the rain when
he learned that rain also was falling
in Portland .scene of this Saturday's
encounter with Oregon.
His forecaster also predicted rain
for Saturday, and so Welch ran his
squad through a lull scrimmage
drill on the rain-swept field. The
varsity concentrated on offensive
plays exclusively while outdoors.
