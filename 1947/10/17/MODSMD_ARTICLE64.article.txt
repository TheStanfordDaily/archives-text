# Experts Close Eyes--Forecast Bruin Win
## 
### 
The Daily's sports experts, moti- |
vated on one hand by partiality to- ■
ward Stanford and on the other l
hand by sincere conviction, let the
latter win out. As a result the prog
nosticators, in predicting the Indian-
UCLA game, give a unanimous nod
to the Bruins.
And, even if inclement weather
should slow down the action, the j
margin of victory for the Bruins is
expected to be almost four touch
downs wide.
Consensus: UCLA by 23 points.
CALIFORNIA-WSC: The Bears,
making their first conference start,
are expected to have little trouble
downing the punchless Cougars.
Consensus: Cal by .'5O points.
USC-OREGON STATE: Jeff Crav
ath's Trojans, riding high after a
32 to 0 rout of Ohio State last week,
may have their hands full against
the Beavers tomorrow, but only one
of the 11 sportswriters polled tabbed
OSC to win.
Consensus: USC by !( points.
ST. MARY'S-NEVADA: This one
should be close. Three scribes fa
vored the Gaels, and the other eight
sided with the Wolfpack.
Consensus: Nevada by 1 point.
WASHINGTON-OREGON: A bat
tle between a hapless Webfoot team
and an unimpressive Huskie eleven,
which has yet to exhibit its real
power-potential.
Consensus: Washington by 10
points.
MICHIGAN - NORTHWESTERN
The nation's number one team gets
a chance to fatten its average against
Northwestern's Wildcats. Fritz Cris
ier's Wolverines are expected to un
leash their dynamite at full force,
something which they did not do
against Stanford two weeks ago. The
score could be astronomical.

Consensus: Michigan by 2!) points.
NOIRE DAME-NEBRASKA: The
nation's number two team, with a
passionate ambition to get back on
top in national rankings, takes on a
breather this week.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 27 [
points.
ILLINOIS-MINNESOTA: Minne- |
sota surprised last Saturday with a !
convincing .17 to 21 win over North
western. Illnois was held to a dis
appointing scoreless tie by Army.
However, the Fighting Illini are
given a close one-touchdown margin
over the Gophers.
Consensus: Illinois by 7 points.
lOWA-OHIO STATE: These two
teams, highly regarded on pre-sea
son dope charts, have not lived up to
their press notices. The Buckeyes
have looked anything but impress
ive, and lowa has been only a little
better.
Consensus: lowa by 15 points.
TEXAS-ARKANSAS: Powt • r -1 a -
den Texas, with All-American can
didate Bobby Layne, is an over
whelming choice over the Razor
backs.
Consensus: Texas by 37 points.
ALABAMA-TENNESSEE: South
ern teams have been extremely dif
ficult to appraise this season. Seven
sportswriters favored Tennessee,
three leaned toward Alabama, and
one threw up his hands and settled
for a tie.
Consensus: Tennessee by 3 points.
PENNSYLVANIA - COLUMBIA:
Penn slaughtered Dartmouth last
week, 32 to 0, while Columbia was
losing a relatively close game to
Yale. The Quakers are a unanimous
choice.
Consensus: Pennsylvania by IS
points.
