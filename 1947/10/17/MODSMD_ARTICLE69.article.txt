# 'New Spirit' Can Win
## 
### 
A new spirit in the stands tomorrow is in
order.
The Stanford football team now more than
ever needs the undivided support of the stu
dent body. This kind of support is not possible
with the rooters quibbling with Rally Com,
Rally Com quibbling with the rooters, and
general quibbling with the Yell Leaders.
The Yell Leaders, Rally Com, and the Band,
spent many hours in pre-game preparations,
making every effort to produce the best yells,
card stunts, spirit, and music. Unfortunately
these hours of work and weeks of planning
mean nothing without unified rooter support.
Last week's fiasco in the stands must not re
occur. Rally Com has made arrangements
with the athletic department to get an im
proved public address system which will solve
part of the problem.
Stadium traffic tie-ups will be kept to a
minimum this week if the new Rally Com
system is followed. Men rooters will enter
the Stadium through gate I, rather than through

Gate G as in the past, and move along in front
of the bleachers to the rooting section.
Traffic bottlenecks to-and-from the game
can also be kept to a minimum if students
with cars comply with a request to walk to the
game. .
If more cards are lost tomorrow there will
be no more card stunts this year. More than
1,000 cards—and they're expensive and hard
to get —were lost due to the Santa Clara frolic.
If this is repeated there will be no Big Game
card stunts. The next step will be for Stan
ford rooters to follow our across-the-bay
friends' example and rip the bleachers out of
the Stadium.
The huge contingent of UCLA students who
will be here for the game have promised
"terrific card stunts." Rally Com has prepared
stunts that will outdo the Bruins, but only if
the Farm rooters forget their "gripes" and
help out.
And who knows if we "win" the game in
the stands, the Indians may pull an "Idaho"
on the rampaging Bruins. ■ —D.D.
