# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
One of the things we admire in the college student
of today in his analytic approach to a situation, his
ability to take a definite stand and defend it.
It is wonderful to see the impulsive, emotional
flightiness of the old college student being replaced
by the shrewd, rational insight of the modern college
student.
On the basis that one should ask the people who
really know, I took the privilege of interviewing a
few of the students on campus as to their analyza
tion of the Stanford campus, and their keen criticism
of campus situations.
Slim Scherdling, brilliant young freshman from
Cucamonga High, expressed his opinion of Stanford
Campus:
"Certainly is a suhwelll place. It gets me. Some
body sure knew what they were doing. You don't
see a place like this everyday."
When asked her opinion on the status of future
student-administration relations, Sophomore Marge
Inal Selling said with intelligence and vision:
"Relations are and will remain just as they have
always been. There's a fine feeling of—l don't know
how to say it. Sure Stanford is high priced, but
then there's a lot of dough down here. When things
are bad you've got to remember that things have

been bad before, ,and they could be worse."
Star baseballer, Baisonne Balls, a transfer student
from Ebbets field, gave voice to his seasoned opinion
on college sports:
"Can't find a thing wrong. Seems to me things are
just about as they should be, all factors considered.
There are, of course, lean years and fat years, but
then spilt milk is 90 percent water, and as that great
Roman said: 'Solus Rangarum clamat: Altus-yo
Angarum'."
What do you think of school spirit was asked of
Ima Rahgirl, popular young deb from Cape Cod,
Southhampton, Nassau, and Stanford:
"I'm glad you asked me about that. There has
been a lot of comment offered on this subject, and I
feel that for the most part it's just right. It's a dif
ficult question but if I had to put it bluntly I would
say 'yes'."
My last interviewee v/as Mac Hine, known to his
friends as "the big Red." I asked Mac what he
thought about Bull Session interviews as an instru
ment of student enlightenment. Said Mac:
"Drop dead you should. Twice!"
But then there is always someone in any organi
zation who has nothing to offer in a constructive
line.

tion of the Stanford campus, and their keen criticism
of campus situations.
Slim Scherdling, brilliant young freshman from
Cucamonga High, expressed his opinion of Stanford
Campus:
"Certainly is a suhwelll place. It gets me. Some
body sure knew what they were doing. You don't
see a place like this everyday."
When asked her opinion on the status of future
student-administration relations, Sophomore Marge
Inal Selling said with intelligence and vision:
"Relations are and will remain just as they have
always been. There's a fine feeling of—l don't know
how to say it. Sure Stanford is high priced, but
then there's a lot of dough down here. When things
are bad you've got to remember that things have

been bad before, ,and they could be worse."
Star baseballer, Baisonne Balls, a transfer student
from Ebbets field, gave voice to his seasoned opinion
on college sports:
"Can't find a thing wrong. Seems to me things are
just about as they should be, all factors considered.
There are, of course, lean years and fat years, but
then spilt milk is 90 percent water, and as that great
Roman said: 'Solus Rangarum clamat: Altus-yo
Angarum'."
What do you think of school spirit was asked of
Ima Rahgirl, popular young deb from Cape Cod,
Southhampton, Nassau, and Stanford:
"I'm glad you asked me about that. There has
been a lot of comment offered on this subject, and I
feel that for the most part it's just right. It's a dif
ficult question but if I had to put it bluntly I would
say 'yes'."
My last interviewee v/as Mac Hine, known to his
friends as "the big Red." I asked Mac what he
thought about Bull Session interviews as an instru
ment of student enlightenment. Said Mac:
"Drop dead you should. Twice!"
But then there is always someone in any organi
zation who has nothing to offer in a constructive
line.
One of the things we admire in the college student
of today in his analytic approach to a situation, his
ability to take a definite stand and defend it.
It is wonderful to see the impulsive, emotional
flightiness of the old college student being replaced
by the shrewd, rational insight of the modern college
student.
On the basis that one should ask the people who
really know, I took the privilege of interviewing a
few of the students on campus as to their analyza
tion of the Stanford campus, and their keen criticism
of campus situations.
