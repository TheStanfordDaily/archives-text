### GEORGE BRUNN 
It has been contended that I am talking through
may hat when I call Turkey a dictatorship. I am
aware that the citizens of most countries like to
think of their own government as democratic. The
Russians, for instance, constantly call themselves a
democracy. They point to a constitution which
looks wonderful—in print. The rest of the world
isn't fooled.
The Turks, too, have a great constitution on paper.
It is a little difficult, however, to take their claims
to democracy very seriously in view of the facts
that most of the liberal opposition is in jail, that the
only opposition is the one that the government tem
porarily tolerates, that martial law is the rule rather
than the exception, that the government's control
over the country's economy is similar to Mussolini's
in Italy, and that the farmers are not even allowed
to walk on the sidewalks of the city that was built
with their taxes.
Turkey's demands for aid are as meaningless, if

not more so, than their assertions of democracy.
Unlike most of the people in Europe, the Turks are
at least as well off today as before the war. They are
not starving, need no food. While the people of other
nations fought the Germans and had their towns
destroyed and their economies wrecked, the Turks
stayed neutral till just before the war ended, making
handsome profits off both sides and immobilizing
Allied divisions in the near East for fear that Turkey
might join the Axis.
Turkish political leaders have been extremely
capable in exploiting the Red scare. "Help us or the
Russians will rush in," is the familiar cry. Congress
was impressed, and while we can't get houses for
vets, we can get guns for Turks. This despite the
fact that the Turkish army is more than twice the
size of our own prewar army, though the population
is only one seventh of ours.
Do we want to help Europe recover and build
a peaceful world, or is it our desire to turn it into
an armed camp leading to another war?
