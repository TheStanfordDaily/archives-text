# CAMPUS OPINION

To The Editor:
The letter by Serif Arif Mardin in Wednesday's
"Campus Opinion" adds substance to the cry heard
in many quarters that Americans do not know
enough about the other nations of the world. I for
one would like to see "History 1947" temporarily re
placed by a series of articles written by the foreign
students attending Stanford describing the politics,
economics and the stand their countries are taking
in (he present cold war.
We have a large number of these students here
and it is my guess that they would be willing to tell
those of us who have not set ourselves up as inter
national experts, some of the facts about their
native lands.

Dear Editor:
During the war, Congress held closed meetings.
That is to be easily understood: secrecy is of the

utmost importance during a w;u\ But what is im
possible to understand is that Excom would have a
closed meeting.
The meeting of Excom on Wednesday, October 15,
1947. was closed during the main discussion between
Dr. Tresidder and Excom on the very explosive mat
ter of PCA. Surely there can be no justifiable rea
son. in democratic procedure, for having a closed
meeting.
When the people who represent the Associated
Students of Stanford University are afraid to allow
members of that student body hear what is going
on at a regular meeting (and what else may we
assume?), then here is cause to wonder and fear
what will happen at the next meeting of our repre
sentatives. Was this closed meeting for the purpose
of allowing Excom to receive in private their weekly
directive from the Front Office?
