dents. The words to a new song en
titled "Stanford Forever" will be
introduced by Roble and Encina.
The song has been played by the
band at all of this year's games. A
new yell called the "Volume Yell"
will be introduced by the cheer
leaders, stated Miss Cox.
Coach Marchie Schwartz will give
a short talk.
It is hoped that all loyal Indians
will attend the rally to help reju
venate the Stanford fighting spirit.
Dave Heyler announced that un
der the new seating plan at tomor
row's game, men are to enter the
Stadium through Gate I and move
along in front of the bleachers to
the men's section. Women will con

tinue to enter their separate sec
tions as before. The Block S will no
longer be used.
Card stunts are planned for half
time; therefore the men's rooting
section must be filled, he said. Men
are now to be given a choice of
seats, governed by only a few sim
ple rules.
The men's section will be divided
into two parts by a rope running up
the middle of the section. Men may
sit at any level, but seats must be
filled from the rope to the aisle.
No seats may be saved, Heyler
said, and rooters should sit directly
over the cards, which will be tacked
under the seats. A Rally Com mem
ber should be notified of vacant
seats.
Rooters are requested to remem
ber their row number for the ani
mated card stunts. This number
appears on the top of the instruc
tion card.
For the flip card stunts students
should hold the card up for the first
in the series, with the card for the
flip backed to it. Should a third
change occur, the student may slip
the third card in while holding up
the second, he said.
Heyler promises to announce flip
stunts in advance so rooters may
prepare for the animated stunts.
When the stunts are over, cards
must be passed to the Rally Com
members in the aisles. If card
stunts are to be continued, co-op
eration in saving the cards is neces
sary, Heyler emphasized. Last week
over 1,000 cards were lost.
Before the game Rally Com will
pass out megaphones and feathers to
Stanford rooters, he said.

dents. The words to a new song en
titled "Stanford Forever" will be
introduced by Roble and Encina.
The song has been played by the
band at all of this year's games. A
new yell called the "Volume Yell"
will be introduced by the cheer
leaders, stated Miss Cox.
Coach Marchie Schwartz will give
a short talk.
It is hoped that all loyal Indians
will attend the rally to help reju
venate the Stanford fighting spirit.
Dave Heyler announced that un
der the new seating plan at tomor
row's game, men are to enter the
Stadium through Gate I and move
along in front of the bleachers to
the men's section. Women will con

tinue to enter their separate sec
tions as before. The Block S will no
longer be used.
Card stunts are planned for half
time; therefore the men's rooting
section must be filled, he said. Men
are now to be given a choice of
seats, governed by only a few sim
ple rules.
The men's section will be divided
into two parts by a rope running up
the middle of the section. Men may
sit at any level, but seats must be
filled from the rope to the aisle.
No seats may be saved, Heyler
said, and rooters should sit directly
over the cards, which will be tacked
under the seats. A Rally Com mem
ber should be notified of vacant
seats.
Rooters are requested to remem
ber their row number for the ani
mated card stunts. This number
appears on the top of the instruc
tion card.
For the flip card stunts students
should hold the card up for the first
in the series, with the card for the
flip backed to it. Should a third
change occur, the student may slip
the third card in while holding up
the second, he said.
Heyler promises to announce flip
stunts in advance so rooters may
prepare for the animated stunts.
When the stunts are over, cards
must be passed to the Rally Com
members in the aisles. If card
stunts are to be continued, co-op
eration in saving the cards is neces
sary, Heyler emphasized. Last week
over 1,000 cards were lost.
Before the game Rally Com will
pass out megaphones and feathers to
Stanford rooters, he said.
Serpentines will originate at vari
ous points on campus tonight to
lead Indian rooters to the UCLA
rally at Union Court, according to
