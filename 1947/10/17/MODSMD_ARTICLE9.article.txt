# NSA Can Fill Stanford's Need For New Union—Ginny Titus
## 
### 
Student officials have been work
ing on a new student union for
Stanford for more than a year now.
But if you ask the typical Stan
ford student what he knows about
it, he'll look at you and shrug his
shoulders in bewilderment, Ginny
Titus, NSA delegate and Excom
member charged last night.
NSA—National Students' Associa
tion —is the nationwide group which
is currently trying to gain recogni
tion on the Stanford campus.
''What we need is some straight
information on this," Miss Titus
said. "Even if student leaders are
working on the problem as they
say them are, few students ever
know about it.
"Let's hear what is going on.
"Furthermore, the whole program
should be progressing much more,
rapidly. It seems ages since Patty
Whittemore (now out of school)
started collecting information from
other schools," she said.
"If Excom approves NSA when it
comes up for ratification next week,
we will immediately attempt to
rectify this situation in the inter
ests of all concerned—the adminis
tration, student officials, and the
'just-plain Stanford student.'
"NSA can be a real expediter in
this case, particularly with the strong
national information service at its
disposal," Miss Titus stated.
"Stanford students want, 1 think,
a new student union. That's what
NSA wants to give them—in the
best, fastest, and most practical way
possible."
