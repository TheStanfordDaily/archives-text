# Communists Losing In French Elections
## 
### 
PARIS, Monday, Oct. 10 (UP).â€”Gen. Charles De Gaulle's anti
communist union of the French people gained an imposing lead
in Sunday's nationwide municipal election, polling 40 per cent
of slightly less than 3,000,000 votes tabulated by 3:45 a.m.
Of the 2,874,821 votes counted, the communists gained 28.8

percent; socialists, 19.5; Foreign Min
ister George's Bidault's popular Re
publican party, once considered De-
Gaulle's party, 9 per cent.
ANTI-COMMUNIST VOTE
The combined anti-communist
vote by the De Gaulle's Rassemble
ment du Peuple Francaise (RPF)
(CQ), socialists and Popular Re
publicans (MRP) totalled approxi
mately 1,970,000 against the com
munists' total of slightly more than
827,000. The remainder of the votes
were scattered among minor parties.
De Gaulle's party, testing its
straight anti-communist platform for
the first time, was showing its great
est popularity in Paris. Despite the
heavy communist vote in tradition
ally Red suburbs of Paris, DeGaulle
garnered 57 percent out of the first
(>41,000 votes counted or 264,570.
MRP LOSES
Of the slightly more than 2,000,000
votes reported counted in the prov
inces, Dc Gaulle obtained more than
35 percent as compared to the 29 per
cent polled by the communists.
Most of De Gaulle's success
seemed to be gained largely at the
expense of Bidault's popular Repub
licans. The MRP, which ran second
to the communists in the last gen
eral election, had polled only 9 per
cent of the total votes counted.
De Gaulle himself, while not a
candidate for office, was swept in as
municipal councillor of his country
home, Colombey les Deuz Eglises,
on a write-in vote by townsfolk.
TEST OF STRENGTH
The purely local elections were
De Gaulle's first test of strength in
a campaign which was also a test of
French support for the United
States or Russia. Contrary to pre
dictions, abstentions were higher
than in general elections, running
up to 25 per cent in Paris and 32 per
cent for France as a whole.
