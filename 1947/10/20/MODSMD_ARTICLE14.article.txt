### 
Studio Theater players will add
expressionistic writing to their re
pertoire with the opening of August
Strindberg's drama "The Father"
Wednesday evening at 8:15 in the
Little Theater.
Under the direction of Walter
Krumm, graduate student in speech
and drama, the players will bring
the work of "the only genuine
Shakespearean modern dramatist"
to the West Coast stage for the first
time since 1940.
Often referred to as "the father of
the modern psychological drama,"

the American public, mainly be
cause of his violent antipathy to
ward women. He viewed relations
between the sexes as constant strife,
characterized by simultaneous at
traction and repulsion.
Such strife forms the core of "The
Father," in which a cavalry captain
and his wife struggle for control of
their daughter. Leading parts will
be played by Mel Ellett, Elaine
Maltzman, and Nancy De Groot.
Miriam Worland, Ralph McCor
mic, George foakimedes, Michael
loakimedes, and Norman Willner
will complete the cast.
