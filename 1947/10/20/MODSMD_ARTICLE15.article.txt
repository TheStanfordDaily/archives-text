"We can't get any more desperate
for an orchestra," says Don Shef

"If some good musicians don't
apply pretty soon for the 22-piece
band, there won't be any Gaieties,"
Sheffey added. Anyone interested
should see him any night before 9
in the Ram's Head room.
Women dancers will meet tonight
at 8 in the Ram's Head room,
George Eckstein, Gaieties director,
stated.
The dancers are: Caroline John
ston, Adelita Pel las, Diane Brown,

The chorus will meet at 7:30 to
morrow night, Sheffey said.
''Anyone who is interested in do
ing orchestration or
paying jobs â€” should contact me,"
