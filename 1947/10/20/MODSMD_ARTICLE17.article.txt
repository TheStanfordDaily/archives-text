# Chaplain Assigned To The Village
## 
### JOE WILLIAMSON 
Stanford Village is a community,
and there is a task for the church
in any community. The University
has given tangible evidence of its
recognition of that fact.
In September, the Rev. Gale Win
ton Engle, recently a regional sec
retary of the New England Student
Christian Movement, was appointed
associate chaplain of the Memorial
Church, and assigned to the Village.
BORN IN COAL COUNTRY
Mr. Engle, a Presbyterian minis
ter, was born in Beaver, Pennsyl
vania, and received his degree at
Allegheny College in Meadville,
Pennsylvania. His theological edu
cation began at Yale University and
at Union Theological Seminary, and
developed with lectures in psychi
atry at Cornell Medical School and
a seminar on "Youth and the Oc
cupational Situation" at Antioch
College.
EUROPEAN TRAVELS
In 1939, Mr. Engle traveled
through Germany and Austria,
France and England, getting a last
look at a "peaceful" world. In the
fall of 1945, he went to Europe again
as a field secretary of the World
YMCA. In that position he worked
at educational, religious, social, and
recreational activities among the
displaced persons in the British zone
of Germany.
His work in the church has been
concentrated in and around New
York City, having served on the
staffs of the First Presbyterian
Church, Brooklyn, and the Central
Presbyterian Church, Manhattan,
His first year in the ministry was

spent in the coal fields of western
Pennsylvania.
For the most part, Mr. Engle's
work has been with young people.
During the past summer, he served
as co-director of an International
University Student Work Camp in
'Brantford, Ontario.
CHURCH AND VILLAGE
What can the church hope to ac
complish in the Stanford Village?
"This is a question which might
have many answers," Mr. Engle
said. "One might hazard at least
one or two answers in terms of the
aims."
One aim will be to give the resi
dents of the Village an opportunity
to explore the Christian faith in

order to see its claims upon the
inner personal life, and its ethical
claims upon our common life, at all
points — economic, social, political,
international.
A second aim will be to help each
other think through the relation be
tween faith and morality. The third
aim will be to discover the meaning
and depth of Christian fellowship.
In what tangible ways are these
aims to be realized?
First, it was necessary to have a
center or headquarters. By arrange
ment with the Director of {Stanford
Village, Dwight Adams, an office has
been redecorated and furnished. It
is called the Chaplain's Office and
is fortunately placed at the Village
Center.
OFFICE OPEN TO ALL
This office will become the nerve
center of the church in the Village.
Here, planning for student Christian
group activities will materialize;
student committees will develop
programs designed to represent the
needs and interests of the Village;
personal counseling will be avail
able; a library can be used; and
practical Christian service will be
conceived and carried on.
Mr. Engle emphasized that the
purpose of the church will be to
exercise a ministry to all, without
exception. He hopes to have occa
sional events geared to a clearer
understanding of the Catholic, the
Protestant, and the Judaic creeds.
WORK STARTED
The operations of the church have
already begun. A committee of
married students is at work plan
ning for the development of a

church school for children and is
exploring the prospect for a com
bined Fireside Forum Series and
social events.
A number of single students have
also indicated interest in (he or
ganization of a Village Christian

Anyone in the Village interest
ed in developing groups under
Mr. Engle's guidance is invited to
attend a meeting for that purpose
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the chap
lain's office. Possibilities of an
adult forum, social events, and
other activities will he discussed.
The Family Council meeting
scheduled for the same time has
been postponed one week.

Association which will promote ac
tivities, discussions, forums, social
events, and world interest services.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
"We have a capital opportunity
here in the Village to develop an
honest-to-goodness Student Chris
tian Program," Mr. Engle declared.
"We will, in time, want to identify
ourselves with the purposes of the
World Student Christian Federa
tion, which sees Christianity not
merely as a dogma but as a life to
be lived, a faith which each student
must make his own by honest intel
lectual effort, a pattern of the ideal
community toward which each must
strive by concrete deeds of love, and
a faith which should be realized in
the church. It welcomes into its fel
lowship those who believe in Chris
tianity and those who wish to test
it."

Village, Dwight Adams, an office has

is called the Chaplain's Office and
is fortunately placed at the Village
Center.
OFFICE OPEN TO ALL
This office will become the nerve
center of the church in the Village.
Here, planning for student Christian
group activities will materialize;
student committees will develop
programs designed to represent the
needs and interests of the Village;
personal counseling will be avail
able; a library can be used; and
practical Christian service will be
conceived and carried on.
Mr. Engle emphasized that the
purpose of the church will be to
exercise a ministry to all, without

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
"We have a capital opportunity
here in the Village to develop an
honest-to-goodness Student Chris
tian Program," Mr. Engle declared.
"We will, in time, want to identify
ourselves with the purposes of the
World Student Christian Federa
tion, which sees Christianity not
merely as a dogma but as a life to
be lived, a faith which each student
must make his own by honest intel
lectual effort, a pattern of the ideal
community toward which each must
strive by concrete deeds of love, and
a faith which should be realized in
the church. It welcomes into its fel
lowship those who believe in Chris
tianity and those who wish to test
it."


REV. GALE WINTON ENGLE,
new Village chaplain.
Stanford Village is a community,
and there is a task for the church
in any community. The University
has given tangible evidence of its
recognition of that fact.
In September, the Rev. Gale Win
ton Engle, recently a regional sec
retary of the New England Student
Christian Movement, was appointed
associate chaplain of the Memorial
Church, and assigned to the Village.
BORN IN COAL COUNTRY
Mr. Engle, a Presbyterian minis
ter, was born in Beaver, Pennsyl
vania, and received his degree at
Allegheny College in Meadville,
Pennsylvania. His theological edu
cation began at Yale University and
at Union Theological Seminary, and
developed with lectures in psychi
atry at Cornell Medical School and
a seminar on "Youth and the Oc
cupational Situation" at Antioch
College.
EUROPEAN TRAVELS
In 1939, Mr. Engle traveled
through Germany and Austria,
France and England, getting a last
look at a "peaceful" world. In the
fall of 1945, he went to Europe again
as a field secretary of the World
YMCA. In that position he worked
at educational, religious, social, and
recreational activities among the
displaced persons in the British zone
of Germany.
His work in the church has been
concentrated in and around New
York City, having served on the
staffs of the First Presbyterian
Church, Brooklyn, and the Central
Presbyterian Church, Manhattan,
His first year in the ministry was

spent in the coal fields of western
Pennsylvania.
For the most part, Mr. Engle's
work has been with young people.
During the past summer, he served
as co-director of an International
University Student Work Camp in
'Brantford, Ontario.
CHURCH AND VILLAGE
What can the church hope to ac
complish in the Stanford Village?
"This is a question which might
have many answers," Mr. Engle
said. "One might hazard at least
one or two answers in terms of the
aims."
One aim will be to give the resi
dents of the Village an opportunity
to explore the Christian faith in

order to see its claims upon the
inner personal life, and its ethical
claims upon our common life, at all
points — economic, social, political,
international.
A second aim will be to help each
other think through the relation be
tween faith and morality. The third
aim will be to discover the meaning
and depth of Christian fellowship.
In what tangible ways are these
aims to be realized?
First, it was necessary to have a

ton Engle, recently a regional sec
retary of the New England Student
Christian Movement, was appointed
associate chaplain of the Memorial
Church, and assigned to the Village.
BORN IN COAL COUNTRY
Mr. Engle, a Presbyterian minis
ter, was born in Beaver, Pennsyl
vania, and received his degree at
Allegheny College in Meadville,
Pennsylvania. His theological edu
cation began at Yale University and
at Union Theological Seminary, and
developed with lectures in psychi
atry at Cornell Medical School and
a seminar on "Youth and the Oc
cupational Situation" at Antioch
College.
EUROPEAN TRAVELS
In 1939, Mr. Engle traveled
through Germany and Austria,
France and England, getting a last
look at a "peaceful" world. In the
fall of 1945, he went to Europe again
as a field secretary of the World
YMCA. In that position he worked
at educational, religious, social, and
recreational activities among the
displaced persons in the British zone
of Germany.
His work in the church has been
concentrated in and around New
York City, having served on the
staffs of the First Presbyterian
Church, Brooklyn, and the Central
Presbyterian Church, Manhattan,
His first year in the ministry was

spent in the coal fields of western
Pennsylvania.
For the most part, Mr. Engle's
work has been with young people.
During the past summer, he served
as co-director of an International
University Student Work Camp in
'Brantford, Ontario.
CHURCH AND VILLAGE
What can the church hope to ac
complish in the Stanford Village?
"This is a question which might
have many answers," Mr. Engle
said. "One might hazard at least
one or two answers in terms of the
aims."
One aim will be to give the resi
dents of the Village an opportunity
to explore the Christian faith in

order to see its claims upon the
inner personal life, and its ethical
claims upon our common life, at all
points — economic, social, political,
international.
A second aim will be to help each
other think through the relation be
tween faith and morality. The third
aim will be to discover the meaning
and depth of Christian fellowship.
In what tangible ways are these
aims to be realized?
First, it was necessary to have a
center or headquarters. By arrange
ment with the Director of {Stanford
Village, Dwight Adams, an office has
been redecorated and furnished. It
is called the Chaplain's Office and
is fortunately placed at the Village
Center.
OFFICE OPEN TO ALL
This office will become the nerve
center of the church in the Village.
Here, planning for student Christian
group activities will materialize;
student committees will develop
programs designed to represent the
needs and interests of the Village;
personal counseling will be avail
able; a library can be used; and
practical Christian service will be
conceived and carried on.
Mr. Engle emphasized that the
purpose of the church will be to
exercise a ministry to all, without
exception. He hopes to have occa
sional events geared to a clearer
understanding of the Catholic, the
Protestant, and the Judaic creeds.
WORK STARTED
The operations of the church have
already begun. A committee of
married students is at work plan
ning for the development of a

church school for children and is
exploring the prospect for a com
bined Fireside Forum Series and
social events.
A number of single students have
also indicated interest in (he or
ganization of a Village Christian

Anyone in the Village interest
ed in developing groups under
Mr. Engle's guidance is invited to
attend a meeting for that purpose
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the chap
lain's office. Possibilities of an
adult forum, social events, and
other activities will he discussed.
The Family Council meeting
scheduled for the same time has
been postponed one week.

Association which will promote ac
tivities, discussions, forums, social
events, and world interest services.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
"We have a capital opportunity
here in the Village to develop an
honest-to-goodness Student Chris
tian Program," Mr. Engle declared.
"We will, in time, want to identify
ourselves with the purposes of the
World Student Christian Federa
tion, which sees Christianity not
merely as a dogma but as a life to
be lived, a faith which each student
must make his own by honest intel
lectual effort, a pattern of the ideal
community toward which each must
strive by concrete deeds of love, and
a faith which should be realized in
the church. It welcomes into its fel
lowship those who believe in Chris
tianity and those who wish to test
it."
