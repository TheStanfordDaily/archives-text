### 
The epidemic of common colds
which is currently spreading around
the campus has thus far hit at least
25 per cent of the student body, ac
cording to recently released Health
Service information.
The majority of the cases have
been mild, with very few complica
tions in evidence.
Health Service officials pointed
out that such epidemics almost al
ways occur in the fall when school
first starts. The epidemic usually
hits its peak a few weeks after reg
day, and then goes into a rapid de
cline.
Health Service recommended the
avoidance of extreme fatigue as the
best possible cold preventative.
