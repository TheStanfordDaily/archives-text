LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 19
(UP). â€” Behind-the-scenes dicker
ing set the stage tonight for a break
in the bitter East-West deadlock in
the United Nations General Assem
bly over the election of Poland's
successor in the UN Security Coun
cil.
At the same time a Soviet official
disclosed that Deputy Foreign Min
ister Andrei Vishinsky would de
liver an important address to the
57 United Nations tomorrow, when
delegates hold their first plenary
session in nearly three weeks at the
big assembly hall in Flushing
Meadows.
The spokesman would not disclose
the contents of Vishinsky's speech,
but it was believed to contain a new
blast at the Western powers, either
for their trying to keep a Soviet sat
ellite off the Security Council or
for their activities in Greece.
