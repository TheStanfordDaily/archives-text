# Western Delegates Seek National Approval in First Regional Meeting
## 
### 
Delegates from more than 10 colleges in California, Nevada,
and Hawaii will converge on the Stanford campus this weekend
for the first regional conference of the NSA.
NSA—the National Students' Association—is the union of
American students that is seeking recognition on college cam-

'puses throughout the nation.
Operating under tentative ap
proval from Excom, the Stanford
chapter will be host to more than
70 delegates from this region.
NSA officials will bring their na
tional constitution up for ratification
by Excom this Wednesday.
PROGRESS MADE
In an effort to coordinate student
action on the NSA, Ken Gallagher,
student body president of UCLA,
conferred with Tom Martzloff, ASSU
president, last weekend. Both stu
dent leaders declared they were
pleased with the progress made.
So Excom may understand all the
implications of NSA membership,
Dick Heggie, regional chairman from
the University of California, Berke
ley, will appear before the pre-Ex
com meeting this afternoon for a
question and answer session.
ORGANIZATION DISSOLVED
"The organization left over from
j last spring is completely dissolved
| now." Miss Titus said, "and we arc
again starting from scratch.
"Now is the time when relatively
new persons will be able to attain
positions of much responsibility on
NSA."
Preliminary to the weekend con
clave, NSA officials on campus will
undertake a widespread orientation
program so that student leaders and
"just the plain student" will know
more about what NSA can do for
them if Stanford joins.
Miss Titus lists the following con
crete reasons:
"1. Our whole International pro
gram can have wider effect and
greater success if put on a national
level. ,
"2. Stanford has a responsibility
to the rest of the colleges to make
this organization as strong as pos
sible.
"3. United States students must
make their representation to stu
| dents in the rest of the world re
liable. NSA is the reliable organi
zation needed.
"4. NSA can facilitate travel at
lower cost for Stanford students.
"5. NSA can provide the informa
tion exchange — communication —
that is lacking among American uni
versities.
"6. By entering and becoming a
leader, Stanford can gain prestige
and eminence among American
schools. A reputation is built on
action. This is the time for Stanford
to act."
