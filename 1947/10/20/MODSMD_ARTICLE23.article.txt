A plan for placing one European
student in each fraternity house
was presented to Interfraternity
Council last week by the Phi Gam
ma Deltas, according to Chuck Mar
tin, president of the Institute of In
ternational Relations.
If the project, sponsored by the
lIR, is accepted, it would be put into
operation next year. Under present
plans, the student's "board and room
would be paid by the fraternity
housing him; the ASSU would pay
for transportation, with the Univer
sity waiving all tuition.
Each of the three stipulations
must be agreed upon by the organi
zation concerned before the project
can be given an official OK, Martin
stated.
Sending Stanford students to Eu
rope is another phase of llR's plans
for the coming year. One plan con
cerns students spending their junior
year abroad; another, getting un
dergraduates to take summer cours
es in European universities.
The lIR will also investigate the
Possibilities of working abroad and
traveling with hostel groups.
With an eye on Harvard's Salz
burg experiment, the lIR would like
to set up a Bay Region project sim
ilar to that of the Eastern univer
sity. Harvard has organized a sem
inar on American culture for out
standing European students in
structed by American professors.
At the lIR meeting last Thurs
day, Bill Farrer and Lawrence
Grannis presented plans for compil
ing a series of booklets on their
experiences, dealing mainly with
their traveling conditions and the
problems confronting Europe's uni
versities.
The institute announced that SI
RO (Students' International Relief
Organization) would handle the
Four Feathers Drive in co-opera
tion with the lIR. SIRG's book and
clothing drive, however, is on con
tinuously. The relief organization
also hopes to formulate a definite
project for the University of Naples.
