# Farm IIR Will Sponsor Western College Congress
## 
### 
The preservation of peace being one of the most important
problems of our time, the Institute of International Relations at
Stanford is sponsoring the Western College Congress to be held
here Nov. 24, 25, and 26.
This congress will consider different aspects of this guestion

and make resolutions as to what
should be done, said Cliff Forster,
president of the congress.
Feeling that we, the young, have
the greatest stake in the future and
possibly the best imagination to com
prehend the meaning of another war,
the Congress will gather together the
best thinking of college students.
It will try to provide an occasion to
deal with these questions as intel
ligently, courageously, and realistic
ally as possible, Forster added.
Forty major four-year colleges
and universities in California, Ari
zona, Nevada, Utah, and Hawaii
have been invited to send two stu
dent delegates each. In order to
provide for a continuing yearly
Congress, it is desirable that not
more than one of the delegates be a
senior.
LATER MEETS PROBABLE
Although the lIR at Stanford has
a . umed leadership for the meeting
this year, students from nearby col
leges will assist in the planning. At
trie first meeting of the Congress
lans will be made whereby subse
quent meetings may be held from
year to year at different schools.
There will be both Working Sec
tions and Program Meetings at the
Congress. The working sections will
dual with fairly specific approaches
to the problem of world peace.
They will consist of not more than
20 delegates, and the agenda will
be formulated by the planning com
mittee. Suggested topics are: World
political and legal organizations,
Keoriomic affairs, Security, and So
i ial Problems and human rights.
Sections will be asked to express
their recommendations as specific
resolutions. On the last day of the
Congress, resolutions from the var
ious sections will be brought before

the entire Congress for discussion
and vote.
While at Stanford, delegates will
lave an opportunity to hear ad
lresses by prominent authorities,
ontact is being made with possi
ble speakers at the present time,
nd their names will Le revealed
soon, said Forster.
OVER-ALL REPORT
Following the Congress, delegates
will secure a referendum on the
various resolutions from their own
student bodies. The results will be
compiled into an over-all report for
distribution to newspapers, maga
zines, radio commentators, officials
jf the State Department, members
of Congress, and others interested.
Two delegates from the Congress as
a whole will personally convey the
resolutions to the American Dele
gation to the United Nations in New
York.
The Congress follows closely the
Pacific Northwest College Congress
held at Reed College in Portland
last spring. The first conference of
its type, the Reed Congress was able
to make many recommendations to
the United Nations delegates. It is
hoped that crolleges throughout the
nation will hold conferences of this
type, for the problem of maintaining
peace is vital, and the results to
date have been encouraging, Forster
commented.
