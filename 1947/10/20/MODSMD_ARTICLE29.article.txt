# Farm Electronics Machine Shop Aids Federal Research Projects

### 
A new electronics machine shop is now in full-scale operation at
Stanford, turning out parts for government-sponsored research projects,
according to Dean Frederick E. Terman <0 the School of Engineering.
The building which houses the shop was completed this summer at a
cost of $25,000. It is located between the electronics laboratory and the

Guggenheim aeronautical labora
tory, near the old clock tower. A
third of the building is used as a
student instruction laboratory, and
the machine shop occupies the rest
of the 3.700 square feet of floor
space.
Terman said that the shop does
research for the School of Engi
neering, but the major portion of,its
time is devoted to projects in con
nection with government-sponsored
electronic research. The Air Force,
Navy, Bureau of Standards, and the
Signal Corps each have special re
search programs in the Stanford
electronics department.
STUDENT SHOP
Faculty members and many of the
114 graduate students in electrical
engineering work on the projects.
The research is part of the program
of instruction and graduate stu
dents are used whenever possible,
stated Terman.
The new shop employs six full
time machinists, who work in pairs
on projects such as high-frequency
oscillators and traveling wave tubes,
under the supervision of the re
searchers. Students do not use the
facilities of the machine shop in the
sense of doing the actual work, he
declared. Graduate students, as well
as faculty members, can call on the
machinists for parts as needed, it
was explained, and in addition there
is a separate student machine shop.
SURPLUS EQUIPMENT
Plans for the shop were formu
lated during August and September,
194(3, when crowded classroom con
ditions indicated a pressing need
for a separate machine shop build
ing. The move from the old, smaller
quarters into the present location
was completed this summer.
The machine shop is equipped al
most entirely by war surplus equip
ment. Among the equipment now
being used are four lathes, a verti
cal milling machine, a horizontal
milling machine, a jig borer, and
four drill presses.

equipment. The machinists working at the lathe arp Wilfred Walters,

The research is part of the program
of instruction and graduate stu
dents are used whenever possible,
stated Terman.
The new shop employs six full
time machinists, who work in pairs
on projects such as high-frequency
oscillators and traveling wave tubes,
under the supervision of the re
searchers. Students do not use the
facilities of the machine shop in the
sense of doing the actual work, he
declared. Graduate students, as well
as faculty members, can call on the
machinists for parts as needed, it
was explained, and in addition there
is a separate student machine shop.
SURPLUS EQUIPMENT
Plans for the shop were formu
lated during August and September,
194(3, when crowded classroom con
ditions indicated a pressing need
for a separate machine shop build
ing. The move from the old, smaller
quarters into the present location
was completed this summer.
The machine shop is equipped al
most entirely by war surplus equip
ment. Among the equipment now
being used are four lathes, a verti
cal milling machine, a horizontal
milling machine, a jig borer, and
four drill presses.


Stanford's new $25,000 electronics machine shop is shown in full
operation as expert machinists turn out finely tooled parts for research
equipment. The machinists working at the lathe arp Wilfred Walters,
in the foreground, Fred Smith, and Edward Stcfanski.
A new electronics machine shop is now in full-scale operation at
Stanford, turning out parts for government-sponsored research projects,
according to Dean Frederick E. Terman <0 the School of Engineering.
The building which houses the shop was completed this summer at a
cost of $25,000. It is located between the electronics laboratory and the

Guggenheim aeronautical labora
tory, near the old clock tower. A
third of the building is used as a
student instruction laboratory, and
the machine shop occupies the rest
of the 3.700 square feet of floor
space.
Terman said that the shop does
research for the School of Engi
neering, but the major portion of,its
time is devoted to projects in con
nection with government-sponsored
electronic research. The Air Force,
Navy, Bureau of Standards, and the
Signal Corps each have special re
search programs in the Stanford
electronics department.
STUDENT SHOP
Faculty members and many of the
114 graduate students in electrical
engineering work on the projects.
