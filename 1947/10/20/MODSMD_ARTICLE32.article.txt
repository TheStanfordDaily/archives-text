"Applications for the Stanford
School of Medicine and the schedule
of interview hours of the members
of the Medical Admission Commit
tee are available at the Registrar's
Office," Miss Bernice Ewell, statis
tical secretary, has announced.
Miss Ewell urges students who
are applying for 1948 to file appli
cations and arrange for interviews
as soon as possible, as the large
number of applicants will make it
necessary to process the applica
tions of Stanford students well in
advance.
The Professional Aptitude Test of
the Graduate Record Office, which
is sponsored by the Association of
American Medical Colleges, must
be taken by students applying to
medical schools for 1948 who have
not taken the test previously, Miss
Ewell continued.
Arrangements for taking the test
should be made with her in room
IG4H, Administration Building.
