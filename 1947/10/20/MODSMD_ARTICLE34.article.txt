To make ski mountaineering trips
and summer mountain vacations
more enjoyable, or for, just plain
good sport on Sunday afternoons,
meet with the Stanford Alpine Club
Sunday for practice and instruction
in rock-climbing, Ulf Ramm-Eric
son, vice-president, said today.
No experience is necessary, and !
the danger element in the local |
practice climbs is always kept fully I
under control by use of an "upper
belay"—a stout rope handled by an
experienced climber at the top of
the rock.
Since rock-climbing is a coeduca- '
tional activity, an important social
function is usually held each Sun
day evening after the climb.
Climbers who live on campus i
meet in front of the Administration
Building and proceed from there to
pick up Village climbers who meet
at the Ravenswood entrance. Time
of meeting is specified in the follow
ing schedule:
