# Honors Program Prepared
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
An experiment is going on in tlie
Humanities Department.
It's on a small scale, and not too
many persons know about it. But it
may have University - wide effect
and significance if it proves what
Professor Virgil Whitaker hopes it
will.
It's called the Honors Program—
but it has little relationship to Phi
Beta Kappa.
It is the Humanities Department's
answer to those critics of Stanford
education who are prone to differ
entiate between the Farm's and the
"Eastern kind of education."
BETTER PLAN FOR STUDENTS
"We are attempting to give these
students who are our scholastic
guinea pigs a better planned, more
cohesive education," says Mr. Whit
aker, who is heading the program
this year while Dean John Dodds,
who brought the idea to Stanford, is
away on leave.
"We relate the student's elective
courses to his major. We give them
a senior comprehensive exam cov
ering their whole course of study.
And we finally challenge them to
synthesize their personal expression
and original ideas with their total
studies by writing a senior thesis.
"Together with this we offer them
the opportunity of knowing their
professors more intimately by ex
tensive advising and by frequent in
formal gatherings at the homes of
the various professors directly con
cerned with the program.
IDEA MIGHT SPREAD
"If this honors program shows the
results we hope it will, we might
work out many of the ideas in it on
a University-wide scale. Certainly
something is needed to overcome
the dizzy round of courses at Stan
ford.
"Too much of the 'thank God the
quarter is over' attitude shows that
the sense of continuity of education
is lost at Stanford.
"The comprehensive exam is one
sure way to tie a college experience
together. A college education has
to add up to something. Too often
a liberal education is confused with

a scattered education. In practice
a college education will turn out to
be a collection of superficial infor
mation.
STUDENTS MASTER IDEAS
u ln the honors program the stu
dent gains a genuine mastery of a
whole body of ideas.
"Furthermore the validity of
purely vocational education is vast
ly overrated," Mr. Whitaker com
mented, referring to the always
present conflict of genera! versus
vocational training.
"When you get right down to it,
a reasonably high proportion of col
lege graduates enter occupations
they didn't even dream of in col
lege. A student who isn't com
pletely sure what field he will enter
when he leaves school — and that
includes most of them—needs in
telligence and adaptability ... a
knowledge of human beings and
their problems."
TWO TRY NEW PROGRAM
So far the Honors Program has
produced two finished products:
Nancy Erbit and Roger Til ton have
taken the first senior comprehen
sives ever to be given by the Hu
manities Department and have had

(heir senior theses approved.
A.s far as they are concerned the
Honors Program has proved its
merit. They think they were fortu
nate to get in on it.
Mr. Whitaker is looking for some
more members, too — "particularly
freshmen and early sophs, because
the program is more successful if
j students can devote all four years
I to it."
Students who are interested in
learning more about the program
can sit down and talk it over with
Mr. Whitaker. He is anxious to see
them. The only rigid requirement
is a B average and a real interest
in the goal of the program.
"We don't want the program to get
out of hand," said Mr. Whitaker,
"and lose the value that its intimacy
brings it. But there is room for
about 20 more students.
"We're not looking necessarily for
| the straight A types, for I don't
think the correlation between
grades and education is too high.
"We want to provide an animated
education for a stimulating group
. . . one that is interested in the
provocative questions of human ex
perience."
