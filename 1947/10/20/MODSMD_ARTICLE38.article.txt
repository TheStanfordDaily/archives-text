A kiss means nothing: (1) let
X equal a kiss. (2) Civing a kiss
is the same as receiving a kiss. (3 >
Civing a kiss equals minus X. (4)
Receiving a kiss equals plus X. (5>
substituting in (2) : minus X equals
plus X. (6) Transposing: (2 X
equals 0.) < 7) therefore X equals
0. A kiss means nothing; even two
kisses mean nothing. —H.P.
