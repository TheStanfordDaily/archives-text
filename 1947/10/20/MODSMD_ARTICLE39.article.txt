# Uclans Too Much for Stanford Though Farm Spirit Impresses
## 
### ART LUBIC 
A game but outclassed Stanford eleven bowed before the superior might of the UCLA Bruin,
39 to 6, in Stanford Stadium Saturday. For the record it was the fourth straight defeat for the
Indians, their second in conference play, and the most topheavy PCC verdict returned against
the locals in many a moon.
But the crowd of 30,000 cheered for the rejuvenated Indians all the way. The score' didn't

reflect the new fight and hustle
shown by the Cards, their vastly im
proved line play, and general over
all improvement which bodes evil
for future opposition. It's an im
provement which might manifest it
self into an Indian victory next Sat
urday when Stanford meets the
Washington Huskies in Seattle.
Coach Marchie Schwartz trooped
a starting lineup on the field under
captain Harry Ferris that included
lour new starters—guards Don Fix
and Bob Rohrer, right half Dud De
Groot, and fullback Jack Barnes.
Before the afternoon was over the
partisans were well acquainted with
this quartet and some other hith
erto unknowns—ends Bob Childs
and W;dt Whipple, guard Mac Mc-
Kittrick, and scatback Dave Field.
DURKET KICKING STAR
George Quist, appearing briefly,
sparked the Indian defense and Mike
Durket's brilliant punting kept
Stanford out of hot water and in the
ball game at several stages.
Although the tackling on the whole
was singled out by Coach Marchie
Schwartz as being shoddy, end Bob
Childs broke through and dumped
Bruin passers viciously for long
losses on three occasions. Childs
also went down under a Durket punt
and dropped receiver Ernie Johnson
in his tracks, and later nailed Ben
nie Reiges when the Bruin quarter
intercepted an A 1 Morris aerial.
UCLA scored in every quarter,
crossing the goal twice in the first
and third stanzas. Stanford's big
moment came late in the final quar
ter when the Indians pushed over a
TD and averted a shutout.
FARM SCORES
With little over four minutes re
maining in the fray UCLA quarter
Clifl Schroeder fumbled the pigskin
and Gene Martin recovered for
Stanford.
Here's how the score came about.
Fields was stopped for no gain.
Morris was thrown for a seven yard
loss and then tossed an incomplete
pass. Then Durket entered the
game on fourth down, ostensibly to
punt, but passed instead to scatback
Field who rambled all the way to
the Bruin 20.
Morris' pass to the right fell in
complete. DeGroot cracked the line
for four. Then DeGroot passed—in
complete. Fourth down again, but
the Indians were not to be denied.
Morris faded, then hit his target,
Gene Martin, and it was first down
on the Westwood seven.
DeGroot tightened the Bruin de
fense with a four yard stab through
the center. The stage was set and
Morris' passed to Martin in the left
hand pocket for the score.
UCLA STARTS FAST
The Bruins started off like a house
afire in the opening stanza with two
quick touchdowns.
On the first Bruin play Carl Ben
ton faked the Indian secondary in,
then lofted an aerial to Bill Clements
standing all by his lonesome on the
opposite side of the field and the
Bruin end loped over for the score.
Later in the first quarter little
Al Hoisch, who played frosh ball on
the Farm and was a Bruin co-cap
tain for the afternoon, picked up
three to the 34, then scooted through
the middle for 66 yards and sec
ond UCLA score. Rowland con
verted to make it 14-0.
INDIANS RALLY
The Indians fought back and
pushed the Bruins around through
most of the second quarter. With
Ainslie Bell in the driver's seat the
Farm lads drove all the way to the
UCLA eight. Bell completed passes
to Dan Mervin, Bob Anderson, and
Barnes for healthy gains en route.
Then misfortune overtook the
Redmen when Barnes lost four and
Al Turriziani fumbled and recovered
a lateral for a 13-yard loss. Came
two incomplete passes, and the Bru

in.s took the ball over on downs.
Statistically Stanford appeared
very mueh in the ball game. The
Indians amassed 10 first downs to
UCLA's 11 and racked up 128 yards
in the air compared to the victors'
16.'}. But the Bruin ground attack
stood out, netting 4200 yards, while
the Stanfords came out five plus, in
cluding 77 lost.
