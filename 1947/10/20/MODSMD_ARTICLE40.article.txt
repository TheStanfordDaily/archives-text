# Marchie Says Cards Better
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Heads were higher Saturday, and
despite singing the same refrain of
a losing ball game, the Cards were
a darn sight happier than they have
ever been this year.
UCLA's thumping of the Stan
fords promptly impelled Marchie
Schwartz to decorate an empty feel
ing of silence and sympathy with:
"We have never played a better
game. Yeah, I guess you can say
this was our best game this season.
"But we still have a lot of work
to do. Our blocking and tackling
are still off."
"The Bruins are just as good as
last year," Marchie said. "Of course,
Ernie Case was better than any
UCLA quarterback now. But those
UCLA men (Carl Benton and Bonnie
Reiges) will be 'quite good' at the
end of the year."
For the Indians, Marchie singled
out a bevy of individuals including
Mike Durket, Bob Roher, and Bob
Childs, who previous to Saturday
was cavorting with the "B's."
