several ex-teammates, Stanford's
water polo team was turned back,
15 to 6, last Friday night by the
Olympic Club mermen at the
Winged-O pool.
Although the Cards outsped the
Winged-O men, they were subdued
by the experience of such water
polo veterans as Emmet Cashin,
sparkplug of last year's Stanford
squad, Don Beanston, former Uni

i versity of California star, and Bud
! Richards. Clubman A 1 Weeden,
also formerly of Stanford, did not
play.

Bud Richards led the Olympic Club
with four.
