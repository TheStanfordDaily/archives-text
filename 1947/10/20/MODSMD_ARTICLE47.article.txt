# Partisan Political-Action Groups
## 
### 
Last Wednesday Excom decided, as a gen
eral policy, that it will not recognize any
"partisan political-action organizations."
Organizations which are not recognized by
the ASSU cannot solicit funds on campus. This
does not, however, prevent them from meet
ing on campus nor advertising their meetings.
Generally speaking most members of Ex
com opposed either a policy of allowing all
political groups to belong to the ASSU or one
of prohibiting all such groups from being
recognized.
Those who spoke on allowing political
action groups on campus emphasized:
(1) that a college should strive for complete
"freedom of speech,"
(2) that organizations which are not recog
nized by Excom are strengthened by being
forced "off the campus,"
(3 and, that political thought and action
should be encouraged at this time, not dis
couraged.
Those who opposed the entry of political
action groups onto the campus said:
(1) that outside groups dictating to local
campus groups would create an unwanted
situation,
(2) that political organizations using the
University's name can be detrimental to the
school,
(3) and, that students, so desirous, may join
Palo Alto or Bay Area groups at any time.
After the discussion it was obvious that
neither extreme stand would be approved by
members of Excom. A compromise wording
was necessary.
Although all Excom members realized that
the wording of "partisan political-action
groups" in the resolution they approved made
it flexible, they believed that in its flexibility
lay its value. Admittedly the phrase will be

studied each time an organization asks for
ASSU recognition.
Excom apparently plans to refuse to recog
nize those groups which are figureheads for
national organizations with pre-conceived
political policy. A Democratic or Republican
party chapter would be disapproved. It will
not recognize groups which do not allow in
dividual freedom of expression on all political
issues.
Excom, on the other hand, stands ready to
recognize any organization which is some
thing more than a "front" for a national group,
which advocates free political thinking, and
which does not act merely as a rubber stamp
for a program already outlined.
Excom had a tough problem. It came out
with a solution. The solution won't please
everyone. It can be torn apart by many, but
no one has come forth with a more adaptable
solution for this particular highly-controversial
issue.
In the long run Stanford should benefit by
Excom's action of last Wednesday night.

Generally speaking most members of Ex
com opposed either a policy of allowing all
political groups to belong to the ASSU or one
of prohibiting all such groups from being
recognized.
Those who spoke on allowing political
action groups on campus emphasized:
(1) that a college should strive for complete
"freedom of speech,"
(2) that organizations which are not recog
nized by Excom are strengthened by being
forced "off the campus,"
(3 and, that political thought and action
should be encouraged at this time, not dis
couraged.
Those who opposed the entry of political
action groups onto the campus said:
(1) that outside groups dictating to local
campus groups would create an unwanted
situation,
(2) that political organizations using the
University's name can be detrimental to the
school,
(3) and, that students, so desirous, may join
Palo Alto or Bay Area groups at any time.
After the discussion it was obvious that
neither extreme stand would be approved by
members of Excom. A compromise wording
was necessary.
Although all Excom members realized that
the wording of "partisan political-action
groups" in the resolution they approved made
it flexible, they believed that in its flexibility
lay its value. Admittedly the phrase will be

studied each time an organization asks for
ASSU recognition.
Excom apparently plans to refuse to recog
nize those groups which are figureheads for
national organizations with pre-conceived
political policy. A Democratic or Republican
party chapter would be disapproved. It will
not recognize groups which do not allow in
dividual freedom of expression on all political
issues.
Excom, on the other hand, stands ready to
recognize any organization which is some
thing more than a "front" for a national group,
which advocates free political thinking, and
which does not act merely as a rubber stamp
for a program already outlined.
Excom had a tough problem. It came out
with a solution. The solution won't please
everyone. It can be torn apart by many, but
no one has come forth with a more adaptable
solution for this particular highly-controversial
issue.
In the long run Stanford should benefit by
Excom's action of last Wednesday night.
Last Wednesday Excom decided, as a gen
eral policy, that it will not recognize any
"partisan political-action organizations."
Organizations which are not recognized by
the ASSU cannot solicit funds on campus. This
does not, however, prevent them from meet
ing on campus nor advertising their meetings.
