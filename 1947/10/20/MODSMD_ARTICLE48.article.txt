# The
						'New Spirit' in Action
## 
### 
If spirit rather than touchdowns were shown
on the scoreboard, Stanford would have won
the UCLA game.
If the spirit, and the hard work, shown by
the team, the rooters, the Yell Leaders, Rally
Com, and the Band were shown, the score
board story would've been far different.
From the baritone-voiced rough to the sweet
sopranoed Robleite—from the white sweat
ered Rally Comrner to the third trombonist—
from the peppy Yell Leader to the enthusiastic
pom-pom waver—from the Game Captain to
the lowliest sub—the "new spirit" was in the
best Stanford tradition.—D.D.
