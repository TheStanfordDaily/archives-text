"Marshall Plan, Yes or No" was the subject dis
cussed by an AVC sponsored panel in Cubberley
Auditorium last Thursday. The panel did not agree
on a definite answer to the main question, but it did
come to some very interesting conclusions on the
general idea of aid to Europe.
These conclusions become all the more important
when we look at the men constituting the panel.
Easton C. Rothwell, vice-chairman of the Hoover
Institute and a former member of the State Depart
ment, acted as the moderator and explained "The
Marshall Plan." Raymond Lawrence, chief editorial
writer for the Republican Oakland Tribune, de
fended the Plan. George Hitchcock, instructor in
philosophy at the California Labor School, opposed
the Plan. Bill Farrer and "Shorty" Grannis, Stan
ford representatives in Europe this summer, also
expressed their views.
All these men came to the conclusion that to re
vive the economy of Europe it may be necessary to
revive the German industry; but, in order to allay the
lears of other European countries and suppress the
rebirth of a military-minded Germany, it is necessary
that German industry should not fall into the hands
of the people who financed Hitler.
The panel members proposed two plans to achieve
this internationalization of German coal and steel
industries, or internationalization of the Ruhr and
nationalization of German steel. Even Mr. Lawrence
agreed to the first suggestion.
The most important suggestion, that the panel
made was that no political strings should be at
tached to any monetary aid given by United States
to western European nations.
Grannis, drawing upon his recent experiences in
Fiance, pointed out that any such conditions would

not only be disastrous but would be playing directly
into the hands of the Communist press.
Realizing fully that any aid to Europe is bound to
have some political influence, we agree with the AVC
panel that any open political interference in Euro
pean countries will result in no good will towards
the United States.
While any material aid to Europe will produce
better results than propaganda and can result in the
drawing together of European and American people,
any type of apparent interference in European in
ternal politics will be regarded by those people in a
hostile manner.
People of the aided countries will think that
America is trying to buy their "souls" with gold and
food. No people like to feel as if they are selling
their souls.
But unless the people in this country make their
wishes felt, there is a danger that the Congress
might start attaching conditions to any such aid. To
people who think that any such move would be dis
astrous, the remarks made by Senator Bridges at a
press conference in Paris should be a warning and
a call for some action.
Senator Bridges said the price of American aid
might be a guarantee "that (he money goes where
we want, for the purpose we want." Saying this
information came from a "highly authoritative
source," Bridges added that future assistance may
be given "by some sort of indirect method with
more supervision."
This statement could not have been made at a less
opportune timeâ€”French municipal elections were
only 48 hours away.
It is the duly of Stanford students as citizens to
do something about this part of the Marshall Plan.
