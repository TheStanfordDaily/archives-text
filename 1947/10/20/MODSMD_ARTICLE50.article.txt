# CAMPUS OPINION

Open Letter to the Administration and the ASSU
Excom: ,
We, the students of Stanford University, inter
ested in domestic and international policies, wish to
know the reason behind the banning of political
parties on campus. We feel that the representation oi
political groups would stimulate interest and in
telligent thinking on contemporary matters. Since
college life is supposedly preparation for citizenship,
why should these groups, the embodiment of po
litical expression in our country, be prohibited?
It is not that we are necessarily advocates of the
particular group in question, but that we are con
cerned with the principle of the decision.
We would like an answer from the Administration
and A.S.S.U. Excom on this question.
Signed by 224 students.
To the Editor:
From the Daily, Oct. lfi, 1947:
"Excom, last nii»ht . . . adopted a resolution stating
that 'Excom adopts, as a general policy, that it will
approve no partisan political action organization.'"
From the Daily, Oct. 17, 1947:
"Split on many major issues and political implica
tions. the five members of the AVC panel on the
Marshall Plan in Cubberley Auditorium last night,
agree in principle that there was a definite need in
Europe today, that assistance should be forthcoming,
and that internationalization of the Ruhr and German
Industry, should I*' a major part of such a plan."
We are puzzled.
Is the AVC a "partisan political action organiza
tion?"

1j" so, what shall Exeom policy be concerning such
organizations which already hold churtcrs?
If not, what is?
I am sure the student body would appreciate a
clarification of the new policy, and a definition of the
terms used therein.

To the Editor:
In an editorial in the October 16th issue of the
Stanford Daily re: waterbagging you said: "The
penalties decided on by Men's Council may be severe
but who cares . . . the only ones affected will be a
small minority ..." I personally don't care; I live
in a one-story barracks in the Village; but I object
to the severity of the ruling and also to the contra
dictory reporting concerning it.
As I remember it, there was a previous article
which stated that for a first offense a $5 tine would
be levied on each member of a living group if one
of said members should throw a waterbag. The pen
alty is not only severe, as you have pointed out, but
obviously unfair. Why should innocent parties pay
for the breaking of a law by some mental incompe
tent in their ranks?
Therefore, your "ones affected'' will not be the
"small minority" who actually threw the bombs, but
a whole group of people who happen to live in the
house with the offender, people whose only sin is
being his or her house-mate.
Something is wrong with such a ruling.

Open Letter to the Administration and the ASSU
Excom: ,
We, the students of Stanford University, inter
ested in domestic and international policies, wish to
know the reason behind the banning of political
parties on campus. We feel that the representation oi
political groups would stimulate interest and in
telligent thinking on contemporary matters. Since
college life is supposedly preparation for citizenship,
why should these groups, the embodiment of po
litical expression in our country, be prohibited?
It is not that we are necessarily advocates of the
particular group in question, but that we are con
cerned with the principle of the decision.
We would like an answer from the Administration
and A.S.S.U. Excom on this question.
Signed by 224 students.
To the Editor:
From the Daily, Oct. lfi, 1947:
"Excom, last nii»ht . . . adopted a resolution stating
that 'Excom adopts, as a general policy, that it will
approve no partisan political action organization.'"
From the Daily, Oct. 17, 1947:
"Split on many major issues and political implica
tions. the five members of the AVC panel on the
Marshall Plan in Cubberley Auditorium last night,
agree in principle that there was a definite need in
Europe today, that assistance should be forthcoming,
and that internationalization of the Ruhr and German
Industry, should I*' a major part of such a plan."
We are puzzled.
Is the AVC a "partisan political action organiza
tion?"

1j" so, what shall Exeom policy be concerning such
organizations which already hold churtcrs?
If not, what is?
I am sure the student body would appreciate a
clarification of the new policy, and a definition of the
terms used therein.

To the Editor:
In an editorial in the October 16th issue of the
Stanford Daily re: waterbagging you said: "The
penalties decided on by Men's Council may be severe
but who cares . . . the only ones affected will be a
small minority ..." I personally don't care; I live
in a one-story barracks in the Village; but I object
to the severity of the ruling and also to the contra
dictory reporting concerning it.
As I remember it, there was a previous article
which stated that for a first offense a $5 tine would
be levied on each member of a living group if one
of said members should throw a waterbag. The pen
alty is not only severe, as you have pointed out, but
obviously unfair. Why should innocent parties pay
for the breaking of a law by some mental incompe
tent in their ranks?
Therefore, your "ones affected'' will not be the
"small minority" who actually threw the bombs, but
a whole group of people who happen to live in the
house with the offender, people whose only sin is
being his or her house-mate.
Something is wrong with such a ruling.
