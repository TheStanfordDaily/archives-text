# 'Operations Alumni' Will Disclose Plans
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
"Operations Alumni," steeped in plans reaching as far east as New
York and w;iy points, makes ready to disperse its contents this week.
And chief among the leading alumni roles cast on the Farm is the
one assigned to Peggy Boothe, Class of '44 and current assistant alumni
director at Stanford, who returned to campus last Friday morning after

a 16-day tour of Stanford alumni
groups throughout the United
States.
She appeared a bit travel weary,
but good-naturedly went on to dis
cuss segments of her journey—the
hotel employees' strike in Philadel
phia providing the most humorous
I incident.

"Generally speaking, wherever I
went, alumni groups were quick to
bombard me with all sorts of ques
tions about Stanford," she said.
"There is a decided interest in Stan
ford, especially if one lives in the
East.
"Of course, I talked mainly with
women's groups, women who are
graduates of later years. I was ex
ceedingly pleased to find alumni of
Stanford curious in regard to cur
rent happenings on campus."
Starting in alumni activities in
her home town of Modesto, Miss
Boothe divulges an attentive con
cern in keeping track of "thousands
of Stanford diploma bearers."
FASHIONABLE REPORT
A good-looking, well-dressed
young lady, she frowned upon com
pletely talking business and was
given to tossing a bit of fashionable
advice to campus women.
"It was a funny thing," she said,
starting to batter the "new look"
trend, "but I had expected to see
Eastern women sticking 1o the pres
ent style of fashions more so than
we out here. But it was quite the
opposite. One could hardly distin
guish any change."
Of the more than 45 Cardinal
alumni centers in the United States,
there are about 11,000 active mem
bers smitten with an intense desire
to find out "if there is any water in
Lake Lagunita yet."
"Many of the people with whom

I talked were amazed to know
Stanford's registration had jumped
to 8,000 students," Miss Boothe said.
'BIG GAME' WEEK
''Our biggest job now is prepar
ing for a Homecoming Day during
'Big Game' week. Stanford alumni
will be invited to return to campus,
visit the various houses, and be
come 'reaequainted' with the fac
ulty and their friends."
"It was a wonderful trip," she
said, and laughing, continued: "I
reached Philadelphia from New
York and I didn't, at the time, real
ize was a hotel employees'
strike.
"So you can picture me stepping
from a taxi, two huge suitcases, two
coats, and a heavy briefcase under
my arms . . . and not one person
stepping forward to help me."
She sighed and shook her head,
casually prophesying "alumni af
fairs have taken a decided turn for
the best."

"Generally speaking, wherever I
went, alumni groups were quick to
bombard me with all sorts of ques

"There is a decided interest in Stan
ford, especially if one lives in the

women's groups, women who are
graduates of later years. I was ex
ceedingly pleased to find alumni of
Stanford curious in regard to cur
rent happenings on campus."

her home town of Modesto, Miss
Boothe divulges an attentive con

FASHIONABLE REPORT
A good-looking, well-dressed
young lady, she frowned upon com
pletely talking business and was
given to tossing a bit of fashionable
advice to campus women.

opposite. One could hardly distin

"Many of the people with whom

I talked were amazed to know
Stanford's registration had jumped
to 8,000 students," Miss Boothe said.
