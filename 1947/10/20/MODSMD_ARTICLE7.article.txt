# Float Ideas Taken This Wednesday
## 
### 
First come, first serve will be the
order of signing up floats for the
"Big Game" parade. Floats will fol
low the general theme of "Stanford
Cavalcade," announced Phyllis Gra
ham, float chairman.
fdeas for floats will be taken from
Wednesday until October 31 in the
ASSU office. Duplicate ideas will
not be taken; therefore, those houses
that hand in their ideas first will
have a better chance of having them
accepted by Cardinals. Houses that
submit an idea already turned in by
another house must change their
ideas to something not already used,
said Miss Graham.
Houses, except those in Union
Unit, will not be allowed to com
bine in making floats, as they did
last year, stated Miss Graham.
Themes for the decorations of the
houses are optional, said Phyllis
Graham, and do not have to follow
the idea used on the floats. Fire laws
must be obeyed, and all paper used
in or near the houses must have
cold water paint sprayed on each
side; fireproof crepe paper must be
used. Decorations on the lawns in
front of the houses need not be
fireproof.
Floats do not have to be fireproof
unless a fire (such as Osky burn
ing at the stake) are essential to
the float*, in that case the fire chief
must be consulted.
Miss Graham suggested that since
the parade will be at night, it won't
be necessary to have minute details
on the floats; because they will prob
ably not be seen.
