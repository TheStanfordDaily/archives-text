# U.S. Plan for Korea Rejected by Russia

### 
UNITED NATIONS HALL, Flushing, N.Y., Oct. 20 (UP).—Russia
today rejected the American plan for Korean independence, and demanded
anew that all American and British personnel leave Greece.
Soviet Vice-Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky appealed to the
full United National General Assembly to oust Anglo-American repre
sentatives from Greece on grounds that they are the real trouble-makers in
the Balkans.
Vishinsky charged that Anglo-American representatives have "intim
idated" the Greek voters and the Greek government. They have been
so successful at this intrigue, said Vishinsky, that the United States now
proposes to hold elections in Korea, set up a Korean government, and only
then withdraw its troops.
"In other words, the American government is determined to hold
elections in Korea on the Greek model under the cover of its armed
forces," Vishinsky said. "Really, bad examples arc infectious!"
This was the first formal Soviet statement on an American plan for
freeing Korea, which now is split into Soviet and American occupation
zones. Russia has proposed that Soviet and American troops withdraw
simultaneously and let Koreans decide their own fate. But the United
States fears that communists would seize the country, which was wrested
from Japan during the war.
Vishinsky brought up the Korean problem as a side-issue to the Gen
eral Assembly's opening debate on the Greek problem. Up for assembly
action was an American resolution —which already had won committee
approval—to set up a permanent "watchdog" commission in the Balkans.
Vishinsky charged that the resolution was just a cover-up to hide
Anglo-American interference in Greece. He insisted that the assembly
approve a Soviet resolution, already rejected in committee, to force the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece, and establish a UN commission
to administer American financial aid to Greece.
