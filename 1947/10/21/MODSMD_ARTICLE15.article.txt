SEOUL, KOREA, Oct. 20 (UP). —The Soviet Union abruptly withdrew
its delegation from the joint United States-Soviet Commission on Korea
today and said the U.S. delegation's position made impossible the creation
of a "united independent Korea."
Col. Gen. Terenty F. Shtikov, chief of the Soviet delegation, personally
informed Maj. Gen. Albert E. Brown, chairman of the American delega
tion, that his group had been ordered to return to Pyongyang, capital of
the northern Russian occupation zone.
Shtikov said that the position taken by the American delegation made
impossible realization of the Moscow decision of 1945 "toward creating a
united independent Korea under guidance of a provisional Korean demo
cratic government," and that the Soviet delegation had "exerted all its
efforts toward the speediest fulfillment" of the agreement.
The commission, which has been deadlocked for more than two years
on the question of what Korean political groups would be permitted to
participate in their own government, was adjourned Saturday after the
United States proposed a "recess" until called upon for aid by a possible
United Nations commission.
Shtikov's brief statement left unclear whether the Soviet withdrawal
was actual acceptance of the American proposal or unilateral action signi
fying an end to the commission.
