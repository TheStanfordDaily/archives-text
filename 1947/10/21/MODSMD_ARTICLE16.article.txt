UNITED NATIONS HALL, Flushing, N.Y., Oct. 20 (UP).—American
Delegate Herschel Johnson, speaking on the radio during a recess of the
United Nations General Assembly, said that if Soviet-dominated Balkan
countries persist in aggression against Greece, the United States "will
be prepared to cooperate with other members of UN in putting into
effect whatever measures are recommended by the General Assmbly for
the protection of Greece."
Johnson did not specifically discuss the use of troops, but an American
spokesman said Johnson had this in mind when he spoke.
It was emphasized, however, that American troops would be used
only in cooperation with other nations, and upon a General Assembly rec
ommendation, which would have to be made by a two-thirds majority.
Johnson told his radio audience that failure to set up the "watch
dog" commission would be "an invitation to additional aggressions against
Greece and new aggressions against other states."
