### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is (lie first in a series of
three articles on the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum. Currently
closed for inventory, the museum
is in the process of "getting ready"
to again open its doors in the near
future. The idea of the museum
and the reasons for its construc
tion arc told in the opening ar
ticle.)
Within the marble recesses of Le
land Stanford Junior Museum are
found the pageantry and historical
lore of a world of yesterday . . .
the roaring Ws with their boule
vards of trail dust and sand, and a
fabulous turn of the century which
led an America from the wilderness.
These arc the tintypes of another
era.
And one will glimpse the senti
ment and clash of civilizations that
formed the background for Leland
Stanford Jr.
As a boy, young Leland began a
normal childhood practice of col
lecting things — small metallic art
objects, different specimens of rock,

and assorted souvenirs from places
he had visited.
TIIE PRACTICAL DREAMER
Young Stanford, son of a state
governor and sportsman, accus
tomed to the florid attention be
stowed upon boys in his station in
life, was, in a sense, a youthful
dreamer of practicalities.
Being the only son of the Senator
and Jane Stanford, he was encour
aged to further his hobby. And on
the top floor of his father's palatial
Nob Hill mansion in San Francisco,
young Leland was given two huge
rooms to use as a "museum work
shop."
The boy took delight in amassing
showcase after showcase full of
"something picked up in Versailles,"
or "a relic from a trader's caravan
that crossed the Gobi."
For the boy, accompanied by his
mother, traveled far and wide, his
collections increasing by acquisi
tions in the shadow of Vesuvius and
on the shores of the historic Rhine.
HOMESICK FOR C ALIFORNIA
But he was still the boy who

wrote his father, requesting the
Senator to "please don't forget to
feed my dog." Cast on an earthly
platform, he was still homesick for
the California that was a growing
giant in the days of Reconstruction.
On March 13, 1884, Leland Stan
ford Jr. died in Florence, Italy, at
the age of sixteen!
The Senator was grief stricken.
His son, who he had hoped some
day would follow in his footsteps,
was gone, and only the "specimen -
filled" showcases on the top floor of
the Nob Hill mansion remained.
The Stanfords, who once had
fashioned the idea of building a mu
seum in San Francisco and present
ing it to the city, were faced with
gnawing remembrances of "a boy
and his newest rock specimen, fresh
from a lead diggings in Colorado."
MUSEUM PLANS GROW
The plan of a museum named
after the late young man grew into
realization proportions. They'd call
it Leland Stanford Junior Museum.
And after months of sporadic
progress, the museum was made

ready to open its massive doors in
March, 1891. Situated on Lomita
Drive, north of the Chemistry
Building, the museum, ?tt that time,
was a complete quadrangle extend
ing hack to the present Medical
Building.
During the earthquake of 1906,
the east and west wings of the mu
seum were destroyed and with it,
numerous collections of art objects
and paintings.
The Senator, nursing memories of
a colossal era, died in 189. T. leaving
Mrs. Stanford to shoulder the bur
den alone.
OBSESSED WITH A DREAM
There have been some people who
said the Stanfords were obsessed
with a dream—an impossible dream
that was tinged with a multitudi
nous chain of love and salvation.
There have been others who have
bowed to a realistic monument of
endeavor.
But there remains a chapter of the
past in whose pages is printed the
story of "a dream come true."
