### 
The question of woman's emanci

evening when the Studio Theater
players present their version of Au
gust Strindberg's most popular
three-act play, "The Father," at 8:15
in the Little Theater.
Scheduled for a four - day run,
"The Father" "shows what happens
when women share the same privi
leges that men do." In this case,
the woman is uncompromising and
fights her husband bitterly for the
control of their only child.
Eugene O'Neill has called Strind
berg, whose work contains the
seeds of existentialism, "the most
modern of the moderns, the greatest
interpreter in the theater of spirit
ual conflict." The Little Theater pro
duction will be the first example of
the Swedish dramatist since 1940.
Elaine Maltzman will character
ize the woman who fights against
her position, while Mel Ellett will
be seen as her cavalry-captain hus
band, Adolf. The center of their
quarrel, their daughter Celia, will
be played by Nancy De Groot, with
Miriam Worland taking the part of
the nurse, Margaret.
Graduate student Walter Krumm
will design and direct the produc
tion as part of his Master's thesis
in the department of speech and
drama.
Priced at 60 cents, tickets may be
purchased in room 202, Memorial
Hall.
