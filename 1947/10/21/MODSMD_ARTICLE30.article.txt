# U.C. Student Reports On NSA Ideals, Action
## 
### 
The National Students Association is a national clearing houso
that will facilitate student action on student problems, Dick Heg
gie told last night's Pre-Excom meeting.
Heggie, chairman of the NSA for California, Nevada, and
Hawaii, will officiate at the regional conference of more than 40

"schools at Stanford this weekend.
In a question and answer session
with the members of Excom, Heggie,
together with local NSA representa
tives, gave a briefing of the ideals,
methods and practical considera
tions of the organization.
WELFARE BETTERMENT
"Basically the NSA seeks the bet
terment of student cultural, social
and intellectual welfare," Heggie
said. "Toward this broad goal, in
dividual campuses, working through
the facilities of NSA, can satisfy then
individual needs and personal prob
lems better and faster.
"You'll have the help of every
college in the country if you de
cide, for instance, to get a new
student union."
But don't get the idea that NSA
is all taking and no giving, Marilyn
Sidwell, first Stanford chairman of
NSA, told Excom members.
"Stanford can give and give and
give some more," she said. "In times
like these we can't afford to be
stand-offish."
FARM RESPONSIBILITY
"If we do have much that, other
schools don't have, we have the
responsibility of helping them reach
our level. They want our help and
we cannot legitimately deny it to
them."
Heggie, who is a student at the
University of California at Berkeley,
stressed that NSA is a non-partisan
political organization.
"Furthermore," he said, "Stan
ford is not bound to participate in
every project that NSA undertakes.
Some of them are relevant to your
campus and some aren't. You pick
your shots and you act the way you
see fit, as long as it is consistent with
| the general ideals expressed in the
[ NSA constitution."
PROPOSED ACTION
"And if you ever disagree with
proposed action by other members
of NSA, you are perfectly free to
disassociate yourself from the par
ticular channel involved. You can
publicize your disapproval of a spe
cific NSA action, if you so wish.
NSA's constitution will be brought
before Excom tomorrow night..
Meanwhile, plans to host the more
than 50 delegates that will converge
on Stanford continued last night.
"We hope NSA gets Excom's OK,"
Ginny Titus said. "And if it does, it
is going to show results—tangible
results."

them."
Heggie, who is a student at the
University of California at Berkeley,
stressed that NSA is a non-partisan
political organization.
"Furthermore," he said, "Stan
ford is not bound to participate in
every project that NSA undertakes.
Some of them are relevant to your
campus and some aren't. You pick
your shots and you act the way you
see fit, as long as it is consistent with
| the general ideals expressed in the
[ NSA constitution."
PROPOSED ACTION
"And if you ever disagree with
proposed action by other members
of NSA, you are perfectly free to
disassociate yourself from the par
ticular channel involved. You can
publicize your disapproval of a spe
cific NSA action, if you so wish.
NSA's constitution will be brought
before Excom tomorrow night..
Meanwhile, plans to host the more
than 50 delegates that will converge
on Stanford continued last night.
"We hope NSA gets Excom's OK,"
Ginny Titus said. "And if it does, it
is going to show results—tangible
results."
The National Students Association is a national clearing houso
that will facilitate student action on student problems, Dick Heg
gie told last night's Pre-Excom meeting.
Heggie, chairman of the NSA for California, Nevada, and
Hawaii, will officiate at the regional conference of more than 40

"schools at Stanford this weekend.
In a question and answer session
with the members of Excom, Heggie,
together with local NSA representa
tives, gave a briefing of the ideals,
methods and practical considera
tions of the organization.
WELFARE BETTERMENT
"Basically the NSA seeks the bet
terment of student cultural, social
and intellectual welfare," Heggie
said. "Toward this broad goal, in
dividual campuses, working through
the facilities of NSA, can satisfy then
individual needs and personal prob
lems better and faster.
"You'll have the help of every
college in the country if you de
cide, for instance, to get a new
student union."
But don't get the idea that NSA
is all taking and no giving, Marilyn
Sidwell, first Stanford chairman of
NSA, told Excom members.
"Stanford can give and give and
give some more," she said. "In times
like these we can't afford to be
stand-offish."
FARM RESPONSIBILITY
"If we do have much that, other
schools don't have, we have the
responsibility of helping them reach
our level. They want our help and
we cannot legitimately deny it to
them."
