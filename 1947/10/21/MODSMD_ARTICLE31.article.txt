WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 (UP).â€”
President Truman's food committee
tonight turned down a poultry in
dustry request to end chicken less
Thursday but left the door open If)
possible elimination later on of this
controversial phase of the grain
for-Europe drive.
Committee Chairman Charles
Luckman, following a five - hour
meeting with the poultrymen, said
he thought they were sincere in
their program to save grain.
But he said their proposals were
not specific enough to warrant drop
ping poultryless days at this time.
"I do not regard the issue as
closed," Luckman said, "and it will
he constantly reviewed and recon
sidered when the industry's repre
sentatives bring back a set, of more
specific proposals."
The food chief said he had offered
to meet again with both the poul
trymen and representatives of the
feed-grain industry tomorrow af
ternoon. He said he believed that
they would submit a new proposal
at chat time.
