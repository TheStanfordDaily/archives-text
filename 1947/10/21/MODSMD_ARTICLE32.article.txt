for their floats for the Big Game
parade tomorrow and sign-ups will
continue through Oct. 31 at the
ASSU office, said Phyllis Graham,
float chairman.
Duplication of ideas for floats will

better chance of having them ac
cepted. Floats will follow the gen
eral theme of "Stanford Cavalcade,"
according to Miss Graham.
Houses that submit an idea al
i eady turned in by another house
must change their ideas to some
thing not already used, stated Miss
(iraham.
No houses but Union Unit will be
allowed to combine to make floats.

proof crepe paper must be used in
accordance with fire laws, said Miss
Graham. Decorations on the lawns
in front of the houses need not be
fireproof. Floats need not be fire
proof unless they carry torches; in
this case the fire chief should be
consulted.
