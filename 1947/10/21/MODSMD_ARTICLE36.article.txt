# Students Warned of Poison Oak; Lake Lagunita Worst Danger Spot
## 
### 
Poison oak is currently the second
most important cause of student dis
ability, according to Dr. George
Houck, director of the Stanford
Health Service. Only the common
cold is rated ahead of the poisonous
plant as a campus public enemy.
Dr. Houck pointed out that the ,
poison oak situation is causing the
Health Service more concern than
the cold epidemic. Colds have been
relatively mild, while several poi
son oak cases have been so serious
as to require hospitalization.
"It is absurd that the second most
common campus disabler should be
a disease which is preventable by
| simple recognition," Dr. Houck said.
"I have been shocked to find that a
large number of students cannot
recognize the poison oak plant, and
have thus come in contact with the
growth unnecessarily. Had they
had the barest knowledge of the
plant's appearance, they might have
completely avoided contraction of
the disease."
Dr. Houck pointed out that the
Health Service is now conducting a
campaign to familiarize every stu
dent with the plant. Mounted speci
mens are being prominently dis
played in the Health Service of
fices, and all campus residents who
cannot recognize the growth are
urged to study the cellophane-en
closed specimens as soon as possible.
Dr. Houck named the area imme
diately adjacent to the shores of
Lake Lagunita as the biggest danger

spot on the campus proper. Traces
of the plant on the golf course have
been virtually destroyed by a poi
soning campaign recently conducted
by hte SAC.
There are luxuriant growths
throughout the hills surrounding
the campus.
