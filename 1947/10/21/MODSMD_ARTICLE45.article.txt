# French Communists Threaten General Strike

### 
PARIS, Oct. 20 (UP).â€”Commu
nist leaders tonight threatened to
cripple all France's industry with a
general strike and appealed for the
Socialist party to merge with them
to help stop Gen. Charles de
Gaulle's victorious anti-Communist
Union of the French People.
The Communists called off their
week-old subway and bus strikes
earlier today alter the French army
alerted troops in the capital. To
night, however, a spokesman for the
Communist - dominated General
Confederation of labor announced
that "all industries" would demand
the 15 to 20 per cent wage increases
asked by transport workers.
In appealing for a Socialist party
merger, a Communist statement
said:
"Our two parties still group more
than half the electoral body and if

the Socialists and Communists unite
they can still play a decisive role
in French politics."
Observers believed the Socialists
would reject the Communist appeal.
The paralyzing transport strike
was canceled when the Communists
failed to budge the government with
a threat of a general strike and de
spite an overwhelming vote to re
ject government peace offers arid
continue the walkout by 25,000
transit workers at a mass meeting
this morning.
Early today the government
rushed troops to the capital to re
| inforce city police and mobile
j guards in crushing possible trouble
between Communist - led workers,
stung by defeat, and De Gaullists.
Late tonight soldiers were still mov
! ing in and were stationed at pre
! viously designated security points.

More than half the Parisians, who
walked during the strike, supported
De Gaulle's anti-Communist Union
of the French People (RPF) in Sun"
day's balloting. At midnight to
night, with 4,400,393 votes tabulated,
De Gaulle's party had 411.15 per cent,
the Communists 30.4, the Socialists
15.5, and the Popular Republicans
10.8 per cent.
Even if the cabinet of Socialist
Premier Paul Ramadier resigned,
D<? Gaulle has no parliamentary
party to support him in forming a
new government. His RPF was
born just six months ago, and As
sembly deputies have been forbid
den by party edicts to throw their
weight to De Gaulle.
