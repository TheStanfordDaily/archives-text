# Delts Topple Phi Psi 13-0; SAE's, Phi Delts Triumph
## 
### 
In a game spotlighted by long aerials and strong ground play,
Delta Tau Delta's touch football squad downed a fighting Phi
Kappa Psi seven 13-0 for the Delt's second straight win of the
intramural schedule.
Alert pass defense work on the part of the Phi Psi backfield

kept the Delts out of scoring terri
tory during the first half, but early
in the second stanza Clyde Ding
fielder intercepted Phi Psi George
Yardley's toss to Ben Garside to
ramble into pay dirt for the Delt's
first tally. Bob Nava's pass to
Johnny Rysdorp was complete for
the extra point.
DELTS SCORE AGAIN
Minutes later the Delts got their
second scoring chance when Rysdorp
recovered Bill Arce's onside kick
on his own forty yard stripe. Nava's
unerring arm was responsible for

two more connections, first to Milt
Iverson and finally to John Hall for
the second Delt score.
Lanky Steve Stephenson spark
plugged a last ditch Phi Psi rally by
completing heaves to Dave David
son, Glen Holtby, and Norm Barnes.
SAE'S LOOK STRONG
In a second intramural tilt last
night, a strong SAE club topped the
Theta Xi's by a 13 to 0 margin.
Touchdowns were scored on a pass
from John Brudie to Jim Brett and
on a center buck by Jim Rose.
Other SAE standouts included Cal
Smith, Frank Casella, Ed McKean,
and Bob Lindsay.
