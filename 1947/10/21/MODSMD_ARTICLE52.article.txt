# Waldorf Wants More Fumbles

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20 (UP).
—The "recovered fumble" play, one
of the most important in the game
of football, has been responsible for
the University of California's vic
tories in its last two games, says
Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf, Bear head
coach.
"And unless University of South
ern California co-operates with us
in fumbling on Saturday, I fear we
are in for a bad time," Waldorf told
the regular Monday luncheon of
the Northern California Football
Writers' Association.
FUMBLES REALLY COUNT
"Wisconsin fumbled and we re
covered six times, and that was one
of our major offensive weapons in
that victory," said Pappy.
"Against Washington State last
Saturday, the Cougars fumbled five
times in the first half and we re
covered every one. They even made
one of their fumbles in the air, en
abling Cunningham to recover it
and run 82 yards for a touchdown
without even stooping."
Waldorf said his scout. Nibs Price,
had told him that the USC team of
1947 is one of the best in Trojan
history.
HOW STRONG IS CAL?
"It compares favorably with those
put out in the Howard Jones era,"
Waldorf reported, "and that means
it is a powerhouse of the first water.
"In any event, this game will tell
whether Cal has just an average ball
club, or a darned good one. That's
the question before the house."
