# Dean Eyes 50 Cage Prospects, 4 Starters
## 
### 
Basketball practice started yesterday when coach Everett
Dean greeted some 50 varsity aspirants, among whom were nine
lettermen, and proceeded with the job of cutting the number to
a workable squad.
Four of last year's starting team turned out for the initial

practice. Dick Berlin, the fifth start
er, is not out for basketball this
year.
lIIGGINS CAPTAIN-ELECT
The four returning lettermen are
Babe Higgins, captain-elect of the
'48 squad, Dave Davidson, Morley
Thompson, and Bill Stephenson.
Other returning lettermen are
Milt Iverson, Gus Chavalas, Bob
Lewis, and Bill Drehobl, all of
whom played on last year's squad,
and Bob Penn, a two-year letter
man in 1941-42. George Yardley, a
tall lad up from last year's junior
varsity, is also listed as a strong
contender for a varsity berth. The
lettermen worked out in the Pa
vilion.
DEAN EYES CANDIDATES
Coach Dean put the remainder of
the turnoutees through a series of
five - minute games in the Encina
Gym. The purpose of this practice
was to enable the basketball mentor
to get an idea as to the abilities of
the newer lads as well as to hold a
practice.
The first game, that with the
Stanford Alumni team, is scheduled
for Nov. 24.
