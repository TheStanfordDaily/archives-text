# Cards Hold Light Scrimmage; Casualty List Disappears!
## 
### 
Their spirit at a new high, Stan
lord's football varsity romped
through a light contact scrimmage ,
yesterday afternoon as preparations I
got under way for Saturday's impor
tant tussle with the Washington
Huskies at Seattle.
The Indians suited up at full
strength for the first time since the |
I Idaho game. Six boys who sat out ;
j the UCLA game were ready fur
action â€”backs Mickey Titus, Jim
Natziger and Chuck Coker, and |
linemen Marty Feldinan, John Clark,
i and Paul Stremic.
Three of Marchie Schwartz's stal
warts needed attention after the
Bruin encounter. Dick Flatland and
Walt Whipple nursed sprained an
kles and Ainslie Bell bumped his
trick knee again, but the trio will
be in top shape by game time.
Both Washington and Stanford are
having a tough time breaking into
\ the win column, and the game with
I the Huskies is an all-important one.
I The Indians figured on crashing in
j to the victory ledger against Ore
gon, but the Webfeet showed sur-
I prising strength in holding UCLA
to a 24-7 count and then upsetting
i Washington 6-0 last weekend.
Daily sports desk editor George
j Newell will make the Seattle trip
I with the team.
