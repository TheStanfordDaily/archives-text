# Husky Eleven Rounds Into Top Shape
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 2ft (UP). â€”Coach
Ralph Welch moved today to keep
his University of Washington
Huskies out of the Pacific Coast
Conference cellar by working them
'hard for Saturday's Stanford
game here.
And, for the first time in two
weeks, Welch had a full squad 011
hand. Ready for action were
tackle Doug Vickcry, halfbacks
Whitey King and Fred Provo, end
Dick Ilagcn, guard George Myers
and even quarterback Fred Whede,
who has had a broken finger.
