# A 						Six-Page Daily Every Day
## 
### 
Like many newspapers today The Stanford
Daily has too much, rather than not enough,
news to fill its pages.
Many campus activities and departments
find that they receive much less publicity than
they believe they warrant. No groups feel that
they are over«-publicized.
The biggest problem The Daily has is in
deciding which stories will be printed. Policy
is to run about three wire service stories each
issue, several so-called "feature" articles, edi
torial matter, columns, and campus opinions.

The balance of the paper is devoted to local
news items.
If The Daily could buy more newsprint the
problem wouldn't exist. At present only one
six-page paper a week can be printed. The
news available would warrant a six-page paper
daily.
The forced alternative is to cut down all
stories which are received. In many instances
stories are condensed to their barest essen
tials.
In the future the shortage of newsprint will
be eliminated and what is now a problem will
disappear.
