# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
As I understand it, it is considered quite proper
in some countries to belch when you have finished a
meal.
This shows your host that you have enjoyed the
repast, and that your digestive system is working like
a Model A Ford with a V-8 engine.
And yet in this country, such a culinary rebate
would bring cold glances from the other members
of the table. That's too bad.
Over in the Union the other day I was watching
a distinguished gentleman eating and enjoying his
meal. Upon finishing the waiter said:
"How did you find the steak, sir?"
"I merely looked under one of the cream peas
and there it was."
Right away I could see that the gentleman was
loaded with talent, but what pleased me most is he
then took a deep breath and burped loud enough to
shake the custard desserts in the kitchen.
I know of very few things which are as impressive
and as awesome as an honest and healthy burp, which
echoes back and forth across the dining room like
a rifle shot in Carlsbad Caverns.

Who was it said:
" 'Tis better to burp and bear the shame." He's
right.
This is really a problem for the education depart
ment. The idea of teaching our youngsters that belch
ing is rude, is, next to the sight of a coed with slip
showing three inches, one of the more heathenish
mores of our civilization.
Irving Tressler tells of a favorite uncle of his
that used to dine at his home:
"One of the pleasantest memories of my child
hood is the picture of Uncle Toby leaning far back
in his chair after a meal, placing his thumbs in his
vest pockets, waiting until everyone at the table was
still and expectant, and then belching until every
cat in the block howled."
This was undoubtedly the sign for the womenfolk
to clear the table, and for father to break the seal
on a new pinochle deck.
A good burp stems from the inside, and has a
soullike quality. A smile may be forced, a frown
may be pure sham, a laugh may lack feeling, but a
burp is always at least a sincere thing.
Joe, please pass the finger bowl.
