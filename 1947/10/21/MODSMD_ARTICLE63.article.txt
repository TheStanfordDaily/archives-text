# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Last Wednesday night, the well-known politieal
vacuum on the Stanford campus was officially ap
proved by Excom. From now on let there be no
ambitious promises by budding nationally- (or inter
nationally-) minded groups on campus that THIS
time they will really make Stanford aware. For at
the root of whatever they try to do there will always
be this official negativism that really doesn't want
Stanford to know what is going on; a fear of where
even the most minor changes might lead. Let there
be no accusations that students are neglecting their
"training for democracy" by ignoring student gov
ernment, a little plaything cut down to their size,
when they could be getting real training for demo
cracy by having a little contact with real issues.
Even so, at critical moments the student govern
ment is usually taken out of their hands —witness
the closing of the Excom meeting on Wednesday
night. I can understand, as Martzloff explained, that
Tresidder had things to say which should not go be
yond that meeting, but it seems pretty bad that on an
issue which affects the whole campus he should
choose to approach the subject in that way. From
the very restricted information which we have we
can gather that there is perhaps a fear of "bad pub
licity" and consequent bad effects on University
finances through a loss of donors.
It seems to me that the purpose of a university
is still the freeing and opening of minds, and that
even though the average student cannot donate mil
lions for new residences, he is still the reason the
university exists. (I may be wrong on that.) Per
haps we should remember that there can be more
than one kind of bad publicity. It depends on whether
wealth is counted in a gift from one man, or in po
tential millions of future students.
Through the whole meeting there was an aroma
of official power being used to get rid of personally
disliked ideas. The atmosphere was notable for a
lack of concrete facts; all sorts of vague threats and
dangers were brought in—if political organizations
were allowed on campus they would become the
"tools" of "outside powers!" Evidently nobody
dreamed of doing a little investigating of how political
activity had worked out on other college campuses.
There seems to be a feeling that if the University
allowed a group on campus the conclusion would be
that the University automatically subscribed to the
views of that group!
If free political activity were allowed resulting
in many and varied organizations, it would be seen
that this idea is ridiculous. Some of the Excom mervi
bers made protestations that none of them had pre
conceived opinions—of course they had preconceived
opinions, just as did most of the observers there.
One especially who stood out, both for his efforts at
whitewashing himself and pthers, and for his rather
curt answers to speakers from the floor, as if they
could not possibly have any point to argue, was Nor
ton. (If you don't think he had any preconceived
opinions, read some of his old articles in the Daily.)
I wonder if his predictions of the results of politi
cal activity on campus were as good as his predic
tions last year that prices would come right down as
soon as OPA was taken off? Despite Excom's rather
naive contention that the ban on partisan political
organizations would have "no effect" on free speech,
there is a big moral issue involved here, which
Excom cleverly tried to side-step. Someone said to
me, "Is Stanford a part of the US or isn't it? And do
we or do we not get the same rights in political
activity as any other citizen?" I would like to echo
tho&e questions.

Another UCLA game. Another fighting Stanford
team. And a fine showing by Rally Com.
Thanks for the reorganization. The new system
shows a really sincere effort on the part of Rally
Com to give the rooters what they want. In spite
of the "mooing" in cattle chute "I," we rooters
think Rally Com did a good job. Especially with the
card stunts. The word from the other side of the
stadium was that they looked good from there, as well
as in the pictures.
Last week's main gripe seems to have been over
come. At the Santa Clara game I only ran into one
Rally Com member (I'd like to mention his name,
Gordy Luce) who seemed to be trying to get along.
There probably were lots more, but I didn't happen to
see them. Saturday, however, the same committee
not only tried to get along, they did. End feud.
The only bad spot came from the stands. But the
boos were justified, if they ever are. (Which remains
a controversial question.) Morris took Tinsley out
with a beautiful block, and a clean one, or I can't
read the NCAA Official Football Guide. I can't
complain. I booed loudly myself.
Here we are, at the bottom of the conference
pile. But we've got a coach who, in spite of injuries,
graduation, and pro football, picked out a fighting
team if I've ever seen one. We've got a Rally Com
who put on a fine pre-game rally, and did a good
job in the stadium. And above all, we've got that
fightin' team. Any group of men who can put on a
last ditch show like those fellows did Saturday de
serves to be supported. We've got a lot to cheer about
even if we do lose. Let's go, Indians.

To the Editor:
During the past few weeks, we have witnessed a
variety of excellent talks, discussions, and articles
inspired by travelers Farrer and Grannis. This will
probably continue for several weeks to come.
However, it is not too soon for us to consider the
question: Was it worth it? And secondly: Should we
do it again?
The basic issue is this: We, the student body
authorized the expenditure of $1,500 to obtain first
hand information on conditions in Europe. Last
spring, we felt that this was the way in which we
could best lend help to Europe.
Before our travelers went overseas, we knew that
Europe was hungry, poor, and destitute. Our own
lIR wants money for the University of Naples. These
are the same people who last spring would rather
spend $1,500 in junketing. Other organizations are
pleading for food for Europe. But our money went
for junketing.
Was it worth it? Should we do it again?

To the Editor:
If the sign saying "To the Village" were restored !
on the corner of Palm Drive where there is now
only a sign saying "To Palo Alto," drivers willing to
share their cars could tell more easily whether peo
ple standing there wished to go to Paly or the
Village.
It's only a little thing, but it would make it a lot
easier for those who want to give the rest of us lifts.
Also, how about an office for the off-campus
Excom member, so his constituents could get in
touch with him easily? It's easy for members of
living groups to see each other, but 3,000 off-campus
people don't get together very often.

come. At the Santa Clara game I only ran into one
Rally Com member (I'd like to mention his name,
Gordy Luce) who seemed to be trying to get along.
There probably were lots more, but I didn't happen to
see them. Saturday, however, the same committee
not only tried to get along, they did. End feud.
The only bad spot came from the stands. But the
boos were justified, if they ever are. (Which remains
a controversial question.) Morris took Tinsley out
with a beautiful block, and a clean one, or I can't
read the NCAA Official Football Guide. I can't
complain. I booed loudly myself.
Here we are, at the bottom of the conference
pile. But we've got a coach who, in spite of injuries,
graduation, and pro football, picked out a fighting
team if I've ever seen one. We've got a Rally Com
who put on a fine pre-game rally, and did a good
job in the stadium. And above all, we've got that
fightin' team. Any group of men who can put on a
last ditch show like those fellows did Saturday de
serves to be supported. We've got a lot to cheer about
even if we do lose. Let's go, Indians.

During the past few weeks, we have witnessed a
variety of excellent talks, discussions, and articles
inspired by travelers Farrer and Grannis. This will
probably continue for several weeks to come.
However, it is not too soon for us to consider the
question: Was it worth it? And secondly: Should we
do it again?
The basic issue is this: We, the student body
authorized the expenditure of $1,500 to obtain first
hand information on conditions in Europe. Last
spring, we felt that this was the way in which we
could best lend help to Europe.
Before our travelers went overseas, we knew that
Europe was hungry, poor, and destitute. Our own
lIR wants money for the University of Naples. These
are the same people who last spring would rather
spend $1,500 in junketing. Other organizations are
pleading for food for Europe. But our money went
for junketing.
Was it worth it? Should we do it again?

If the sign saying "To the Village" were restored !
on the corner of Palm Drive where there is now
only a sign saying "To Palo Alto," drivers willing to
share their cars could tell more easily whether peo
ple standing there wished to go to Paly or the
Village.
It's only a little thing, but it would make it a lot
easier for those who want to give the rest of us lifts.
Also, how about an office for the off-campus
Excom member, so his constituents could get in
touch with him easily? It's easy for members of
living groups to see each other, but 3,000 off-campus
people don't get together very often.

To the Editor:
Last Wednesday night, the well-known politieal
vacuum on the Stanford campus was officially ap
proved by Excom. From now on let there be no
ambitious promises by budding nationally- (or inter
nationally-) minded groups on campus that THIS
time they will really make Stanford aware. For at
the root of whatever they try to do there will always
be this official negativism that really doesn't want
Stanford to know what is going on; a fear of where
even the most minor changes might lead. Let there
be no accusations that students are neglecting their
"training for democracy" by ignoring student gov
ernment, a little plaything cut down to their size,
when they could be getting real training for demo
cracy by having a little contact with real issues.
Even so, at critical moments the student govern
ment is usually taken out of their hands —witness
the closing of the Excom meeting on Wednesday
night. I can understand, as Martzloff explained, that
Tresidder had things to say which should not go be
yond that meeting, but it seems pretty bad that on an
issue which affects the whole campus he should
choose to approach the subject in that way. From
the very restricted information which we have we
can gather that there is perhaps a fear of "bad pub
licity" and consequent bad effects on University
finances through a loss of donors.
It seems to me that the purpose of a university
is still the freeing and opening of minds, and that
even though the average student cannot donate mil
lions for new residences, he is still the reason the
university exists. (I may be wrong on that.) Per
haps we should remember that there can be more
than one kind of bad publicity. It depends on whether
wealth is counted in a gift from one man, or in po
tential millions of future students.
Through the whole meeting there was an aroma
of official power being used to get rid of personally
disliked ideas. The atmosphere was notable for a
lack of concrete facts; all sorts of vague threats and
dangers were brought in—if political organizations
were allowed on campus they would become the
"tools" of "outside powers!" Evidently nobody
dreamed of doing a little investigating of how political
activity had worked out on other college campuses.
There seems to be a feeling that if the University
allowed a group on campus the conclusion would be
that the University automatically subscribed to the
views of that group!
If free political activity were allowed resulting
in many and varied organizations, it would be seen
that this idea is ridiculous. Some of the Excom mervi
bers made protestations that none of them had pre
conceived opinions—of course they had preconceived
opinions, just as did most of the observers there.
One especially who stood out, both for his efforts at
whitewashing himself and pthers, and for his rather
curt answers to speakers from the floor, as if they
could not possibly have any point to argue, was Nor
ton. (If you don't think he had any preconceived
opinions, read some of his old articles in the Daily.)
I wonder if his predictions of the results of politi
cal activity on campus were as good as his predic
tions last year that prices would come right down as
soon as OPA was taken off? Despite Excom's rather
naive contention that the ban on partisan political
organizations would have "no effect" on free speech,
there is a big moral issue involved here, which
Excom cleverly tried to side-step. Someone said to
me, "Is Stanford a part of the US or isn't it? And do
we or do we not get the same rights in political
activity as any other citizen?" I would like to echo
tho&e questions.

Another UCLA game. Another fighting Stanford
team. And a fine showing by Rally Com.
Thanks for the reorganization. The new system
shows a really sincere effort on the part of Rally
Com to give the rooters what they want. In spite
of the "mooing" in cattle chute "I," we rooters
think Rally Com did a good job. Especially with the
card stunts. The word from the other side of the
stadium was that they looked good from there, as well
as in the pictures.

issue which affects the whole campus he should
choose to approach the subject in that way. From
the very restricted information which we have we
can gather that there is perhaps a fear of "bad pub
licity" and consequent bad effects on University
finances through a loss of donors.
It seems to me that the purpose of a university
is still the freeing and opening of minds, and that
even though the average student cannot donate mil
lions for new residences, he is still the reason the
university exists. (I may be wrong on that.) Per
haps we should remember that there can be more
than one kind of bad publicity. It depends on whether
wealth is counted in a gift from one man, or in po
tential millions of future students.
Through the whole meeting there was an aroma
of official power being used to get rid of personally
disliked ideas. The atmosphere was notable for a
lack of concrete facts; all sorts of vague threats and
dangers were brought in—if political organizations
were allowed on campus they would become the
"tools" of "outside powers!" Evidently nobody
dreamed of doing a little investigating of how political
activity had worked out on other college campuses.
There seems to be a feeling that if the University
allowed a group on campus the conclusion would be
that the University automatically subscribed to the
views of that group!
If free political activity were allowed resulting
in many and varied organizations, it would be seen
that this idea is ridiculous. Some of the Excom mervi
bers made protestations that none of them had pre
conceived opinions—of course they had preconceived
opinions, just as did most of the observers there.
One especially who stood out, both for his efforts at
whitewashing himself and pthers, and for his rather
curt answers to speakers from the floor, as if they
could not possibly have any point to argue, was Nor
ton. (If you don't think he had any preconceived
opinions, read some of his old articles in the Daily.)
I wonder if his predictions of the results of politi
cal activity on campus were as good as his predic
tions last year that prices would come right down as
soon as OPA was taken off? Despite Excom's rather
naive contention that the ban on partisan political
organizations would have "no effect" on free speech,
there is a big moral issue involved here, which
Excom cleverly tried to side-step. Someone said to
me, "Is Stanford a part of the US or isn't it? And do
we or do we not get the same rights in political
activity as any other citizen?" I would like to echo
tho&e questions.

Another UCLA game. Another fighting Stanford
team. And a fine showing by Rally Com.
Thanks for the reorganization. The new system
shows a really sincere effort on the part of Rally
Com to give the rooters what they want. In spite
of the "mooing" in cattle chute "I," we rooters
think Rally Com did a good job. Especially with the
card stunts. The word from the other side of the
stadium was that they looked good from there, as well
as in the pictures.
Last week's main gripe seems to have been over
come. At the Santa Clara game I only ran into one
Rally Com member (I'd like to mention his name,
Gordy Luce) who seemed to be trying to get along.
There probably were lots more, but I didn't happen to
see them. Saturday, however, the same committee
not only tried to get along, they did. End feud.
The only bad spot came from the stands. But the
boos were justified, if they ever are. (Which remains
a controversial question.) Morris took Tinsley out
with a beautiful block, and a clean one, or I can't
read the NCAA Official Football Guide. I can't
complain. I booed loudly myself.
Here we are, at the bottom of the conference
pile. But we've got a coach who, in spite of injuries,
graduation, and pro football, picked out a fighting
team if I've ever seen one. We've got a Rally Com
who put on a fine pre-game rally, and did a good
job in the stadium. And above all, we've got that
fightin' team. Any group of men who can put on a
last ditch show like those fellows did Saturday de
serves to be supported. We've got a lot to cheer about
even if we do lose. Let's go, Indians.

During the past few weeks, we have witnessed a
variety of excellent talks, discussions, and articles
inspired by travelers Farrer and Grannis. This will
probably continue for several weeks to come.
However, it is not too soon for us to consider the
question: Was it worth it? And secondly: Should we
do it again?
The basic issue is this: We, the student body
authorized the expenditure of $1,500 to obtain first
hand information on conditions in Europe. Last
spring, we felt that this was the way in which we
could best lend help to Europe.
Before our travelers went overseas, we knew that
Europe was hungry, poor, and destitute. Our own
lIR wants money for the University of Naples. These
are the same people who last spring would rather
spend $1,500 in junketing. Other organizations are
pleading for food for Europe. But our money went
for junketing.
Was it worth it? Should we do it again?

If the sign saying "To the Village" were restored !
on the corner of Palm Drive where there is now
only a sign saying "To Palo Alto," drivers willing to
share their cars could tell more easily whether peo
ple standing there wished to go to Paly or the
Village.
It's only a little thing, but it would make it a lot
easier for those who want to give the rest of us lifts.
Also, how about an office for the off-campus
Excom member, so his constituents could get in
touch with him easily? It's easy for members of
living groups to see each other, but 3,000 off-campus
people don't get together very often.

Last Wednesday night, the well-known politieal
vacuum on the Stanford campus was officially ap
proved by Excom. From now on let there be no
ambitious promises by budding nationally- (or inter
nationally-) minded groups on campus that THIS
time they will really make Stanford aware. For at
the root of whatever they try to do there will always
be this official negativism that really doesn't want
Stanford to know what is going on; a fear of where
even the most minor changes might lead. Let there
be no accusations that students are neglecting their
"training for democracy" by ignoring student gov
ernment, a little plaything cut down to their size,
when they could be getting real training for demo
cracy by having a little contact with real issues.
Even so, at critical moments the student govern
ment is usually taken out of their hands —witness
the closing of the Excom meeting on Wednesday
night. I can understand, as Martzloff explained, that
Tresidder had things to say which should not go be

job in the stadium. And above all, we've got that
fightin' team. Any group of men who can put on a
last ditch show like those fellows did Saturday de
serves to be supported. We've got a lot to cheer about
even if we do lose. Let's go, Indians.

During the past few weeks, we have witnessed a
variety of excellent talks, discussions, and articles
inspired by travelers Farrer and Grannis. This will
probably continue for several weeks to come.
However, it is not too soon for us to consider the
question: Was it worth it? And secondly: Should we
do it again?
The basic issue is this: We, the student body
authorized the expenditure of $1,500 to obtain first
hand information on conditions in Europe. Last
spring, we felt that this was the way in which we
could best lend help to Europe.
Before our travelers went overseas, we knew that
Europe was hungry, poor, and destitute. Our own
lIR wants money for the University of Naples. These
are the same people who last spring would rather
spend $1,500 in junketing. Other organizations are
pleading for food for Europe. But our money went
for junketing.
Was it worth it? Should we do it again?

If the sign saying "To the Village" were restored !
on the corner of Palm Drive where there is now
only a sign saying "To Palo Alto," drivers willing to
share their cars could tell more easily whether peo
ple standing there wished to go to Paly or the
Village.
It's only a little thing, but it would make it a lot
easier for those who want to give the rest of us lifts.
Also, how about an office for the off-campus
Excom member, so his constituents could get in
touch with him easily? It's easy for members of
living groups to see each other, but 3,000 off-campus
people don't get together very often.

To the Editor:
Last Wednesday night, the well-known politieal
vacuum on the Stanford campus was officially ap
proved by Excom. From now on let there be no
ambitious promises by budding nationally- (or inter
nationally-) minded groups on campus that THIS
time they will really make Stanford aware. For at
the root of whatever they try to do there will always
be this official negativism that really doesn't want
Stanford to know what is going on; a fear of where
even the most minor changes might lead. Let there
be no accusations that students are neglecting their
"training for democracy" by ignoring student gov
ernment, a little plaything cut down to their size,
when they could be getting real training for demo
cracy by having a little contact with real issues.
Even so, at critical moments the student govern
ment is usually taken out of their hands —witness
the closing of the Excom meeting on Wednesday
night. I can understand, as Martzloff explained, that
Tresidder had things to say which should not go be
yond that meeting, but it seems pretty bad that on an
issue which affects the whole campus he should
choose to approach the subject in that way. From
the very restricted information which we have we
can gather that there is perhaps a fear of "bad pub
licity" and consequent bad effects on University
finances through a loss of donors.
It seems to me that the purpose of a university
is still the freeing and opening of minds, and that
even though the average student cannot donate mil
lions for new residences, he is still the reason the
university exists. (I may be wrong on that.) Per
haps we should remember that there can be more
than one kind of bad publicity. It depends on whether
wealth is counted in a gift from one man, or in po
tential millions of future students.
Through the whole meeting there was an aroma
of official power being used to get rid of personally
disliked ideas. The atmosphere was notable for a
lack of concrete facts; all sorts of vague threats and
dangers were brought in—if political organizations
were allowed on campus they would become the
"tools" of "outside powers!" Evidently nobody
dreamed of doing a little investigating of how political
activity had worked out on other college campuses.
There seems to be a feeling that if the University
allowed a group on campus the conclusion would be
that the University automatically subscribed to the
views of that group!
If free political activity were allowed resulting
in many and varied organizations, it would be seen
that this idea is ridiculous. Some of the Excom mervi
bers made protestations that none of them had pre
conceived opinions—of course they had preconceived
opinions, just as did most of the observers there.
One especially who stood out, both for his efforts at
whitewashing himself and pthers, and for his rather
curt answers to speakers from the floor, as if they
could not possibly have any point to argue, was Nor
ton. (If you don't think he had any preconceived
opinions, read some of his old articles in the Daily.)
I wonder if his predictions of the results of politi
cal activity on campus were as good as his predic
tions last year that prices would come right down as
soon as OPA was taken off? Despite Excom's rather
naive contention that the ban on partisan political
organizations would have "no effect" on free speech,
there is a big moral issue involved here, which
Excom cleverly tried to side-step. Someone said to
me, "Is Stanford a part of the US or isn't it? And do
we or do we not get the same rights in political
activity as any other citizen?" I would like to echo
tho&e questions.

To the Editor:
Another UCLA game. Another fighting Stanford
team. And a fine showing by Rally Com.
Thanks for the reorganization. The new system
shows a really sincere effort on the part of Rally
Com to give the rooters what they want. In spite
of the "mooing" in cattle chute "I," we rooters
think Rally Com did a good job. Especially with the
card stunts. The word from the other side of the
stadium was that they looked good from there, as well
as in the pictures.
Last week's main gripe seems to have been over
come. At the Santa Clara game I only ran into one
Rally Com member (I'd like to mention his name,
Gordy Luce) who seemed to be trying to get along.
There probably were lots more, but I didn't happen to
see them. Saturday, however, the same committee
not only tried to get along, they did. End feud.
The only bad spot came from the stands. But the
boos were justified, if they ever are. (Which remains
a controversial question.) Morris took Tinsley out
with a beautiful block, and a clean one, or I can't
read the NCAA Official Football Guide. I can't
complain. I booed loudly myself.
Here we are, at the bottom of the conference
pile. But we've got a coach who, in spite of injuries,
graduation, and pro football, picked out a fighting
team if I've ever seen one. We've got a Rally Com
who put on a fine pre-game rally, and did a good
job in the stadium. And above all, we've got that
