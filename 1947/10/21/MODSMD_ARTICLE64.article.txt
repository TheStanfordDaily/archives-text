### BIPAN CHANDRA 
"More than anything else, the students in China want to get
education," said Te Fen Shou, a graduate student in political sci
ence and a recent arrival at Stanford from Peiping, China.
"But the economic conditions in our country make this goal
of students nearly impossible of achievement," added Chien-
Kuan Yeh, who travelled with Te Fen from China to San Francisco
and is living with him in a sun-porch at Stanford Village.
Explaining the recent strikes by the Chinese students against

the government in Shanghai, Te Fen
said:
"The students lack food, books,
scientific equipment, and most of all,
trained professors. Students wanted
all these things without which they
could not study, so they organized
themselves and tried to get help from
the government."
"But students do not depend on
outside aid alone," enthusiastically
added Chien, who is known as "Y"
in building 316.
"Recently they have organized
student self-help programs. Students
in Shanghai, Nanking, Peiping, and
other big cities organize societies
which produce hand-made goods
and thus finance the education of
the needy students. Moreover all
such societies are entirely student
managed."
UNREST HINDERS PROGRESS
"The Chinese students want to
study very, very much so that they
can help in making China a prosper
ous nation," emphasized Te Fen,
who intends to learn the western
knowledge at Stanford and then go
back and teach its good points to the
Chinese students.
Asked about the political situation
in China, Chien replied that "civil
war is too unfortunate for China.
The blame for civil war lies on the
Communists, who are a party of
unrest," he added.
He explained that the cure for the
economic ills of China lies in in
dustrialization and the development
of its resources.
"For all this we need America's
help, but America's action is many
times too slow and sometimes not to
the point," said Chien, who also
added that America is the most pop
ular and best-liked country.
AMERICAN WAYS SURPRISING
Changing the subject, we asked
Te Fen what he thought of American
society in general and American
women in particular.
"Well, it seems to me that Ameri
can men love their wives more than
their Chinese counterparts," he re
plied.
Te Fen is a married man of 26
himself. His wife, a bride of one
year's standidng and an ex-classmate
of her husband, is working in a
bank in Shanghai. She intends to
join him at Stanford when the Chi
nese dollar situation eases up.
"One thing that surprises the
Chinese people is the way American
young people don't take care of
their old people. In China we al
ways live with our parents and
grand-parents in order to help them
in their old-age," said Chien.
In their month-old stay in Ameri
ca, Te Fen and Chien have been very
much interested by the coin-oper
' ated machines. "In China we not
only have no coin machines but no
coins either," said Te Fen smilingly.
STANFORD FAMOUS IN CHINA
Both Te Fen and Chien arc pri
vate students and intend to study in
Stanford for at least two more
years.
"We came to Stanford because in
China it is considered one of the
most famous universities in tihe
world," they said.
"Moreover many of our national
leaders are Stanford graduates."
