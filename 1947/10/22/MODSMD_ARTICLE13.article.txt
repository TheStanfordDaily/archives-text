# Plane Nears Sound Harrier

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21 (UP).â€”
Man's conquest of space advanced
today as the world's most powerful
jet bomber made its maiden hop, a
rocket ship neared the speed of
sound, and a jet-propelled Super
fortress was readied for its initial
flight.
The Army's 44-ton Flying Wing
bomber, powered by eight jet en
gines, took off from Hawthorne and
some 35 minutes later landed at the
Muroc Army Air Base, on the Cali
fornia desert.
JOINS ROCKET SHIP
There it joins the tiny Bell XS-1
rocket ship, which has been coming
closer by the day to the speed of
sound and may break through that
barrier at any time.
At the same time, the Army Air
Force in Washington announced
that Boeing in Seattle had the XB
-47 bomber, jet-propelled successor
to the Flying Superfort, ready for
its test flight.
The boomerang - shaped Flying
Wing, the YB-49, is expected to de
velop speeds of more than 400 miles
an hour while carrying a crew of 13
persons and a pay load of more than
100,000 pounds.
EIGHT JET ENGINES
The tailless plane has its crew
compartments and cargo spaces in
side the giant wings. It was lifted
into the air today by Northrop test
pilot Max Stanley after a 3,000-foot
run down the field at Hawthorne.
The eight jet engines belched black
sqnoke as the plane roared down the
runway and the odd-shaped plane
easily lifted into the air and headed
north for the Army base on the
desert.
Little is known of the perform
ance possibilities of the plane. But
aviation engineers said its range
probably will surpass that of any
bomber ever built becau.se of the
large fuel load it can carry.
