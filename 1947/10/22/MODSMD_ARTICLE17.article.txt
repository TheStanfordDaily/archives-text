## 
### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Oct. 21
(UP). â€”Brazil broke diplomatic re
lations with the Soviet Union today
and a few hours later it was an
nounced in Santiago that Chile also
had severed diplomatic ties not only
with Iho USSR but also with Cze
choslovakia.
The almost simultaneous breaks
by Brazil and Chile, and the fact
that the head of the Argentine dip
lomatic mission has left Moscow os
tensibly on a tour of Europe while
the Soviet ambassador left Buenos
Aires, appeared to bear out persist
ent reports that the U ABC" powers
were adopting a common attitude
toward the Soviets.
