## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS HALL, FLUSHING, N.Y., Oct. 21 (UP).—The
United Nations General Assembly, over bitter Soviet objection, tonight
set up an 11-nation commission to patrol the Balkans and protect Greece
from interference by Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania.
The vote of 40 to 6, with 11 countries abstaining, was a victory for the

* United States which had demanded
UN intervention in the Balkans.
Russia and Poland were placed on
the 11 -nation "watchdog" commis
sion, but they have announced that
they will not sit on it. Yugoslavia,
Albania, and Bulgaria are not ex
pected to co-operate with it. Other
members of the commission will be
Australia, Brazil, China, France,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan,
Great Britain, and the United
States.
RUSS BLOC VOTES NO
Only the Soviet bloc voted against
the commission which will watch
for border incidents, try to get
Greece and her northern neighbors
to establish normal diplomatic rela
tions, and co-operate on the solution
of refugee and frontier problems.
After accepting the American-in
spired "watchdog" commission, the
General Assembly defeated a Polish
resolution calling for the withdraw
al of all AnglQ-American personnel
from Greece. The vote against the
Polish resolution was 34 to 7, with
16 countries abstaining.
Then the Assembly quickly dis
carded a Russian resolution to set
up a special UN commission to ad
minister American economic aid to
Greece.
The United States lias failed to
win majority support for only one
major proposal—a clause branding
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania
guilty of aggression against Greece.
GUILT CLAUSE OUT
The United States, faced with
mounting opposition on this "guilt"
clause, finally struck it from the
U.S. resolution on the Balkans. The
rest of the resolution, despite a tre
mendous thunder of Soviet invec
tive, sailed through the UN political
committee by a wide margin, and
won final endorsement today from
the full General Assembly.

came close to surpassing the speed of sound in tests made yesterday.
