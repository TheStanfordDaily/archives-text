# UN Reorganizes Palestine Groups
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 21
(UP). —The United Nations Pales
tine committee, avoiding a quick
showdown on the Palestine prob
lem, tonight set up three subcom
mittees to study rival proposals for
the Holy Land's future.
One group will study proposals to
partition Palestine into separate
Arab and Jewish states. Another
subcommittee will consider propo
sals for a joint Arab-Jewish state,
while the third subcommittee will
consider the possibility of conciliat
ing Arab and Jewish claims on the
Holy Land.
Russia, backed by the United
States in a rare display of big power
agreement, asked the committee to
decide first whether it wanted par
tition, but the committee voted that
down, 2fi to 14.
Then the Soviet-American dele
gates voted side by side in each bal
lot on the three subcommittees, and
joined in voting for the subcommit
tee to study partition, which was
approved, 35 to 0, with eight states
—including Great Britain and the
Arabs—abstaining.
Russia and the United States also
voted together in opposing a sub
committee to study a single Jewish-
Arab state, but this was voted any
way, 114 to 10, with six abstaining.
