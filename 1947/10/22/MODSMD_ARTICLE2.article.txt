# Four Represent Farm for NSA
## 
### 
A reshuffling of delegate represen
tation for the National Students'
Association regional conference at
Stanford this weekend has left, the
Farm with only four official seats.
Ginny Titus announced last night.
"But we'll probably be granted
six for future purposes," Miss Titus
said.
Stanford's four representatives
will be Tom Martzloff and Guyla
Runyan, ASSU president and vice
president; Ginny Titus, Excom
member from the Row and national
NSA delegate; and Chuck Martin,
head of Stanford's International pro
gram.
Martzloff will have no statement
about the NSA till after the con
vention, he said last night.
"Anything 1 say can be construed
as representing the students and
Excom officially," he said. "And as
yet, Excom has made no decision on
whether Stanford will join NSA or
not."
