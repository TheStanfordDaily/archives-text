# Debaters to Discuss Government Policies
## 
### 
Student body government will be
debated tonight at 7:30 in room 35
of the Education Building, accord
ing to John Hines, assistant debate
manager.
Members of the debating society
will discuss the question, "Should a
student legislature supersede the
now existing Executive Committee
of the Stanford student body?"
The affirmative will be presented

by Forden Athearn. "With the rapid
growth of the student body, certain
reforms might well be considered,"
stated Athearn, "and among them
some means of having a better rep
resentation of the student body."
Marshall A. Small is scheduled to
offer an amendment to Athearn's
resolution. He will probably give
some defense of the existing stu
dent body system, offering minor
changes, Hines said yesterday.
"At all times the student body
government will be discussed in the
light of constructive criticism," he
added.
Tonight's meeting is an open
meeting, and will be presided over
by George Velliotes, parliamenta
rian and KSU commentator.
