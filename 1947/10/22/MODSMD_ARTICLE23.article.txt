# Ex-Polish Envoy Asks for 'American Action Now' Against Communist Policy of Expansion
## Ovation Greets Tuesday Talk Ciechanowski: 'U.S. Must Show Power' 
### 
The time for the United tSatcs to
take action against Russian expan
sionism is now. America must dis
play its power to remind the Snvirt
Union that we are still the world's
most powerful nation.
This was the assertion of former
Polish ambassador Jan Ciechanow
ski when he spoke before an esti
mated 800 persons in Memorial Au
ditorium last night.
In a speech which drew enthusi
astic ovations from his audience hr
lashed out strongly against Ameri
can appeasement policies, charging
that Poland and Hungary had been
forced to accept Communist gov
ernments against the will of the
people.
"Not one of the leaders of thr
present Polish regime was elected,
and only two of them have not been
Communists," he declared.
WORDS NOT ENOUGH
Truman's harsh words thrown at
the Soviets, in which he tabbed the
recent Hungarian coup an "out
rage," are not enough, Mr. Ciecha
noski said, claiming that the Rus
sian government "ignores verbal
protests."
Several nations which could have
unhesitatingly given their full sup
port to the United States have wa
vered of late because thoy are not
yet sure of this country's desire to
stem the expansion program of the
Russians, he declared.
We need to rally other freedom
loving nations around the United
States and state our policies firmly,
he said, showing Russia that we
mean to carry out those policies.
"Military power is a regrettable
thing, but it is the Russians who
are arming and not the United
States. We must be strong to be
respected."
Proof that we are the strongest of
the United Nations, he said, is
shown by the fact that we can al
ways obtain a majority in UN ses
sions. He claimed that the United
States does not need the veto power.
RUSSIA OR UNITED STATES
The people of the world are
forced to choose between either
Russia or the United States, Mr.
Ciechanowski said. There are no
other powers. "Let them choose the
right side â€” let them choose the
United States."
In reference to Russian charges
that the United States is a warmon
gering nation, Mr. Ciechanowski
said that "they are acusing you of
many things of which you are not
guilty, for you want peace and not
war.
"You have done everything pos
sible to make peace. You have sac
rificed and you have the light to
assert yourselves."
In a speech two nights ago before
a crowd at the University of Cali
fornia, Mr. Ciechanowski's state
ments were greeted with both boos
and cheers.
Before beginning his lecture ho
paid tribute to ex-President Hrbrt,
Hoover, Stanford alumnus, whom
he called "one of the greatest Amer
icans and the greatest of your hu
manitarians."
