# Stanford Museum—Home of Wonders
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is the second in a series
of articles on the I.eland Stanford
Junior Museum. Currently closed
fur inventory, the museum is in
(he process of again "opening its
doors" to the public in the near
I uture. Some of the exhibits and
a portrait of their historical ori
gins are told in today's article.)
One of the first impressions one
receives in the huge marble lobby
is one that borders akin to "amaze
ment," because of the Roman-style
;it" terity which first meets the eye.
From the case-filled lobby, there
i a labyrinth of exits which lead
to howrooms hidden now by heavy
• ;lM!inf> oak panel doors.
The wonders of the world attired
in an invisible cloak of past history
may be found in every room—mo
;iics, plaques, Turkish margelehes,
!Vvres jars, onyx from Lucerne, and
i re old Delftware.
>;? TIIOIHCAL COLLECTION
I ollowing the 1900 earthquake,

there began a start of exhibits
which later resulted in methodical
collections of mid-Victorian furni
ture, objects of Californiana, Orien
tal, Egyptian, Civil W;ir, and"the
Golden Age of Greece."
To the casual visitor, the show
rooms appear to be a complex pat
tern of neatly lined showcases dis
playing a seeming overabundance of
museum pieces.
There is exploited a sense of edu
cation and history passing in re
view before one's eyes.
CHILDHOOD ACQUISITIONS
The most interesting room is one
in which are found many of the
original and early acquisitions of
Leland Stanford Jr., housed in ma
ple-colored showcases which were
moved from the family's Nob Hill
mansion in 1891.
Lying stationary in a room off the
east wing is the Governor Stanford

No. 1, the first engine to be shipped
to California, later used on the
Senator's railroad. When the engine
reached Sacramento in 1868 a salute
of 35 guns was immediately ordered
by Capitol officials.
At the present moment, the mu
seum is in the throes of a kind of
spring housecleaning. Several of
the showrooms "are in the process"
of being fully stocked with varied
displays.
DKKA.YI OF CONQUEST
Many art objects and paintings
were destroyed during the Great
Earthquake, and those collections
which were untouched were stored
in the basement.
The task of transferring huge
stores of displays from the basement
to the individual showrooms is a
project seemingly as large as the
"Senator's dream of conquest" in
building the railroad.


NEW RULER — Princess Eliza
beth was officially presented to
the Itritish Empire yesterday as
its heiress apparent. Her dehut in
the new office, a subtle distinction
from heiress presumptive which
she had been until today, took
place at 11 a.m. at the opening of
Parliament when she followed the
King and Queen into the House
of Lords and seated herself on a
throne at the King's right hand.

CHILDHOOD ACQUISITIONS
The most interesting room is one
in which are found many of the
original and early acquisitions of
Leland Stanford Jr., housed in ma
ple-colored showcases which were
moved from the family's Nob Hill
mansion in 1891.
Lying stationary in a room off the
east wing is the Governor Stanford

No. 1, the first engine to be shipped
to California, later used on the
Senator's railroad. When the engine
reached Sacramento in 1868 a salute
of 35 guns was immediately ordered
by Capitol officials.
At the present moment, the mu
seum is in the throes of a kind of
spring housecleaning. Several of
the showrooms "are in the process"
of being fully stocked with varied
displays.
DKKA.YI OF CONQUEST
Many art objects and paintings
were destroyed during the Great
Earthquake, and those collections
which were untouched were stored
in the basement.
The task of transferring huge
stores of displays from the basement
to the individual showrooms is a
project seemingly as large as the
"Senator's dream of conquest" in
building the railroad.
