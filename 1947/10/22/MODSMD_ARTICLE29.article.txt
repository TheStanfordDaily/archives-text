# All Houses on Campus Must Register Floats
## 
### 
Float sign-ups for the Big Game
parade begin this morning in the
ASSU office at 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
will continue through October 31.
All houses on campus are asked to
enter a float, but no houses except
Union Unit can combine to make a
float, and there can be no duplica
tion of ideas, stated Phyllis Graham,
float chairman.
Floats for the parade are to fol
low the general theme of "Stanford
Cavalcade." Decorations for the
houses need not follow this theme.
But all paper decorations in and
near the houses must be sprayed
with cold water paint on both sides
or must be of fireproof crepe paper,
said Miss Graham. Decorations on
the floats must be fireproof if the
float is to carry a torch; in this case
the fire chief must be contacted,
stated Miss Graham.
