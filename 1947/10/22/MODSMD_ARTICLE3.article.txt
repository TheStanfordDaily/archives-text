LAMENT IN SONNET FORM
Methinks a woman has the best of
it:
No woolen suit wears she, on burn
ing days,
Lest it be bathing suit. She drinks
sun rays,
Whilst man must go cach day into
the pit.
Man. brainless crcature that he is,
will slave
To earn some feeble female's fool
ish grin,
Her crudest ruse will swiftly take
him in;
The women crack their whips, and
men behave.
I, too, alas, am such a witless
one—
Consigned forever to my evil fate —
The crying always for a perfect
mate;
Yet knowing well that when she's
found. I'm done.
And yet despite these words. I'm
blue, you sec.
Why won't some woman make a
fool of me?
