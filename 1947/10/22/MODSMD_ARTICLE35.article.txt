### 
SIRO needs at least 300 workers
to collect money and work on ex
hibits, displays, and special events
for the Four Feathers Drive from
Nov. 10 to 14, said Bill Dirker and

mons from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. Mon

in Geneva. Another 20 per cent will
go to the WSSF general fund, 40
per cent to the Community Chest,
and 10 per cent to miscellaneous

SIRO is continuing to send pack
ages of clothing abroad to friends
and relatives of Stanford students
and faculty, whose names have been

The great appreciation of these
parcels is shown in the following
translation of a letter from Ham
burg:
"Dear Sirs: The American Red
Cross for the district of Hamburg
has sent us your package, for which
good fortune please accept our
heartfelt thanks for the clothing it
brought us. . . . When I am a
grandmother I shall still tell my
grandchildren what great joy your
gift has given me. My daughter and
sister also wish to express their
great joy—for my son was lost in
1944 and my husband in 1914, and
this has given us new courage to
go on living. Once again, thank you
for everything. Your grateful, J.
Krull."
