## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP).â€”
President Truman today invited
Congressional leaders of both par
ties to another White House con
ference Thursday to re-examine the
problem of getting emergency help
for Europe.
White House Press Secretary
Charles C. Ross announced the con
ference call without explanation.
Congressional sources, however,
believed the President might be
seeking a pledge from Republican
chieftains that no "extraneous" bus
iness, such as the long-range Mar
shall Plan for European rehabilita
tion or domestic price controls,
would be introduced if he decides
to call a special session to raise
emergency relief funds.
Mr. Truman was expected to re
port to the delegation on the prog
ress he has made toward' easing the
western European crisis by execu
tive action and other measures not
requiring Congressional approval.
