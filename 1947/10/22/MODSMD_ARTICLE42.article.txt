# Varsity Scrimmages Against Jayvees; Unbeaten Frosh Drill for UCLA Tilt
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Stanford's unbeaten freshman
football squad is drilling this week 1
for Saturday's crucial battle with
power-laden UCLA. The Papooses,!
who have edged the Santa Clara and 1
USC frosh elevens, meet a rugged j
Bruin frosh aggregation which
rolled over highly-touted Santa !
Monica City College and boasts a j
depth of talent at every position.
The frosh classic will feature the'
week-end's local sports activity, 1
since the varsity gridmen will be in
Seattle struggling with Washington's
Huskies. The game, scheduled for
2:130 p.m. in the Stanford Stadium,
will be preceded by a contest send
ing the Stanford junior varsity
against the soldiers of Fort Ord.
TAYLOR FEARS BRUINS
Frosh Coach Chuck Taylor, com
menting on last week's 19 to 7 win
over the USC freshmen, said, "Our
running attack was very good, and |
the spirited play of the line pro- j
vided the margin of victory." How- !
ever, Taylor warned that "USC was !
a much over-rated squad and UCLA ;
will undoubtedly furnish us with |
the toughest competition so far this
season."
The entire UCLA squad, along
with Head Coach George Dickenson
and Backfield Coach Art Reichle, I
watched last week's Stanford-USC
clash, so the Papooses have been
well-scouted.
Sparking the UCLA yearlings' at- i
tack is "Hustlin* Howie" Hanson,
185-pound light fullback, who scored
18 of the 32 points against Santa
Monica. Quarterback Larry Lamp- I
kin directs the swift offense of Dick- |
erson's ensemble.
The Papooses are trying this week ;
to eliminate a blocking weakness ex
hibited in the USC game. The pass
ing attack has been a shining spot
in their attack so far, with Tom
Shaw and Wayne Buck continuing
to chuck with accuracy from the
key quarterback spot.
ABRAHAM MAY BE OUT
Dick Abraham, all-city star from
San Francisco, and first-string cen
ter, was injured early in last week's
contest and may be kept, out of the
UCLA game with a shoulder separ
ation.
Among (he linemen who stood out |
in the USC clash and will be ready
to go against the little Bruins are
three towering ends, Dick Schulze,
Bob Scott, and Tom August, guard
Don Lucas, and center Fred Chez.
Tackles Gordon White and Walt j
Watters, both scaling over the 200- j
pound mark, are expected to get the .
call again. In the backfield last Sat- j
urday, Pay Dodson's coffin-corner
kicking was remarkable, while half
backs Boyd Benson and Wally Od- i
ileal performed well.

With the junior varsity lads doing
the tossing, coach Marehie Schwartz
pitted his first string varsity against
a pass offense much like that the
Indians expect to encounter in their
battle with the University of Wash
ington Huskies in Seattle on Satur
day in yesterday's practice. â€¢
Schwartz gave Bob Anderson a
light workout from the fullback
position so that the star halfback
would be able to take over that spot
if called upon to do so in Seattle.
"We will know Wednesday when
we send Mickey Titus through a full
speed workout if he is ready to go,"
the Card mentor said. If so, although
Anderson will start at his usual
left half spot, lie may be shifted to
fullback with Titus handling the
left half chores in the Washington
game.
While the first string men were
scrimmaging the junior varsity un
der the eye of assistant coach Ray

Hammett, Schwartz and line coach
Phil Bengston were running two
teams through a 45 minute scrim -
j mage on the varsity practice field,
j Don Campbell played from the quar
j terback position on offense for one
team with Ainslie Bell handling the
I signal calling job for the other. A 1
; Turiziani and Wayne Erickson were
j standouts on offense with Bob Childs
j showing well at end on defense.
Barring accidents, Schwartz will
field his strongest team of the sea
son against a Washington outfit that
has been bolstered by the return of
| star halfback Fred Provo and start
ing end Dick Hagen, both of whom
have been on the injury list and did
not play in the Oregon game.


CHUCK COKER, lighting Farm
fullback, out of UCLA game with
injuries, returns Saturday against
Washington to holster rejuvenated
Indians.
