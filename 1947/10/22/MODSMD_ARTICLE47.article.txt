# Phi Delts Score Mural Grid Win
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta's second team eked out an 8-7 victory yes
terday over a hard-fighting Village 212 squad in a see-saw game
highlighted by an overabundance of pass interceptions.
The Villagers' Jack Coe started the ball rolling in the first
half by stopping a Phi Delt heave on his own goal line and
rambling up to the 10.

The cards were stacked against
the 212 men at this stage of the
game, however, as on the following
play their wing-back fumbled the
pass from center and was caught
behind his goal by fast-charging Phi
Delt Hu Hudson for a safety.
VILLAGERS MAKE FIRST TD
Revenge came for the Village sep
tet a few minutes later when a
touchdown drive begun by Lloyd
Bishop's interception of Phi Delt
Raleigh Andrews' toss was climaxed
by an aerial from Bishop to Coe for
six big points. Bishop scampered
around right end for the extra point.
The remainder of the first half re
sembled a game of catch between
the opposing backfields, as nearly
every other throw found its way
into the arms of an unintended re
ceiver. Marshall McDaniel of the
Phi Delt group shone especially on
pass defense.
INTERCEPTION BRINGS SCORE
The pass - snagging game finally
paid off for the Phi Delt group early
in the second stanza when Ed Hall
tucked one of 212er Jack Coe's lobs
under his arm and trotted over to
the goal to ring up six more points
for his colleagues. The Phi Delts
hung onto their one-point lead until

the final whistle, although anxious
moments were provided by Village
backs Coe, Bishop, and Newbrough.
