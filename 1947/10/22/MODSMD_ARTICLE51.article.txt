# Concerning Seating Arrangements
## 
### 
The Daily is printing three letters today
which criticize the seating plan for Saturday's
game.
The criticism alleges that:
(1) couples did not have as good seats as
unescorted students,
(2) the policy of having male students enter
through Gate I is unnecessary, and
(3) too many policemen were employed to
show the students to their seats.
Each complaint is unjustified by the facts.
Couples during the Santa Clara game were
allowed to sit together throughout the rooting
section by reason of the "S" formation of
women within the men's section.
However, the "S," although advocated by
Rally Com, had to be dropped for the UCLA
game because of opposition and lack of co
operation on the part of the main body of
students.
As a result, couples attending the game on
student tickets Saturday were in a section
below the fifty yard line.
Rally Com did not purposely force couples
into the worst seats. It was simply a case of
doing the best job for the most people ... if it
were arranged differently the majority of stu
dents could have rightly risen in protest.
In answer to criticism number two ... for the
Santa Clara game male students entered
through the gate at the "fifty yard line." The
resulting congestion made it impossible for
students to be seated before the game started.
Both Rally Com and the Department of Ath
letics realized that something should be done
for the UCLA game. The department sug
gested that male students be directed to enter
through the gate at the end of the field as this
would relieve the congestion around the cen
tral gates and allow each student to be seated
faster.
As a result of the change students were all
seated by game time. Although at times the

path through the tunnel at the end of the
stadium was crowded, the overall picture was
improved considerably. The general reaction
to the entrance through Gate I was favorable..
As far as having too many policemen to di
rect students to the rooting section . . . The
Daily believes in individual rights also. But
the small "infringement" upon the rights of
the "self-disciplined Stanfordite" was justified
when one considers that it allowed the student
body as a whole to be seated by the time the
game started.
Rally Com made some mistakes in the Santa
Clara game. They realized they had and they
set out to make improvements. In cooperation
with the Department of Athletics changes
were made. The result was the elimination of
much of the congestion of the previous week.
These changes appear justified by the facts.
