# An Intelligent Choice
## 
### 
Excom changed its method of representa
tion from class to area with the idea that
through the living group an Excom member
could more completely represent his constitu
ents.
The primary election today for Excom Dis
trict 1 (off-campus students) is the most im
portant of all District elections, because off
campus students are not in living groups.
They are the most widespread uncoordinated
group on campus.
Thus it is essential that these students have
an active interested student representing them
on the student body's highest governing body.
It is also essential that this member should
have a means of communicating with his con
stituents, so that he may feel his opinions have
some authority.
Maybe an office for off-campus students'
informal meetings with their representative is
needed. Certainly an intelligent choice today
is necessary.â€”M.H.
