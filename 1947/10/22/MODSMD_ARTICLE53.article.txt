# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
Some of the old-timers about campus might re
member a slight smear campaign we started against
the campus yellow-jackets a couple of weeks back.
It wasn't much, just a suggestion to apply birth con
trol against the beasts.
Unbelievable as it may seem, the drones can
read —even The Daily. And with prompt efficiency
they retreated for a second honeymoon, recuperated,
and have now returned with new vigor and vim.
First to suffer from this counter attack were our
beloved campus dogs—the ones with four feet.
These shaggy pooches have formed an integral
part of this school for so long that some of them are
practically third-generation Stanford dogs. Hardly
a football game or an Econ lecture would be com
plete without canine enrollment, and now these ani
mals are also being attacked by the bees. They arc
geting their painful stings in front of the cellar, not
while drinking coffee as you might think, but while
engaging in their social activities of the day.
Of course the dogs are not alone in their predica
ment. The rest of the students are still suffering, too.
Two gil ls collided head-on while trying their escapes
from the bees with pure bursts of speed, and one
young man found an ingenious new way to keep his
gal warm. He merely drenched her with hot coffee
and claimed the bees had upset him, which all added
to the total result: Increase in cleaning bills and de
crease in coffee.
But this bee situation is not the only bone of con
tention around campus. Have you tried to get inside

tho tiny Post Office shack during noon lately? I
have—and the age of miracles isn't past yet. I'm still
here to tell about it.
If the post office had any ingenuity at all, they
would have mail-call, Army style, and inject a little
action into this situation. First of all we'd dismiss
classes at 11 o'clock every day, and clear the Union
lawn of all late sleepers. Then we'd turn off the
sprinkler system before the mail truck pulls up to
the steps.
The back of the truck would open, and our chief
clerk could step to the built-in platform. The Hoover
Tower bells would start chiming "It's good to hear
from you," and the ceremony could get under way.
"Welcome to this mid-morning mail call," the
clerk will begin. "I have in my hand several letters
that are particularly heavy. Undoubtedly they're
your laundry being returned from home. Will so
and-so please pick it up."
After the letters and the postcards, the clerk
could pass out the CARE packages being sent to the
residents of Encina Hall, distribute copies of the
New York Times to the Poly Sci 20 students, and
sell money orders to the top income bracket of the
faculty.
And one of the biggest advantages of such a
mail call would be for late sleepers. KSU could
broadcast the show each noon, and if you had no
mail you'd never have to bother to come to classes.
You'd also not get stung by bees.
