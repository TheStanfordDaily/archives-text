To the Editor:
At the Stanford-UCLA game, we were given our
choice of sitting above the 2S)th row on the 10-yard
line, or below the 9th row in the end zone. This was
not because we had leprosy or hoof-and-mouth dis
ease, but simply because we were classed as "cou
ples," since we happen to be married, engaged, or
fortunate enough to have a date.
When we questioned Rally Com as to the reason
for the seating arrangement, we were told that it
was arranged by Mr. Al Masters, so that alumni, pos
sessors of the "almighty dollar" (as phrased by the
Rally Com member), could be seated in the better
scats near the rooting section.
Al other schools, graduation brings a diploma; at
Stanford, graduation brings an assurance of the best
scats at football games.

Dear Editor:
We would like to offer a few suggestions to Jack
Davies and Rally Com in anticipation of their weekly
press statement concerning the rooting section's
actions last Saturday. The routing of the male root
ers via the end zone was a lot of fun for all con
cerned, but we feel that the novelty of this entrance
will soon wear off. At the next game why not have all
men rooters enter high up on the far side of the
stadium—close to where the grammar school fans
arc fenced in —and take one lap around the top of
the stadium in single file before sitting down in the
Stanford rooting section. This would not only give
the spectators on the other side of the field an op
portunity to see white-shirt examples of Stanford
manhood, but it would enable the sporting members
of the student body to pick up the latest odds and a

few bets from the opposing rooting section as they
pass by.
This one-lap entrance would soon become tire
some if used by Rally Com on too many successive
Saturdays, so we submit an alternative plan. With
the cooperation of one of the dirigibles circling the
field, Rally Com (with the aid of parachutes) could
drop 4.000 male rooters right on the 50-yard line a
few minutes prior to game time. The cooperation of
the blimp crew would be assured if each "para
rooter" landed 011 the green gridiron with a jumbo
can of Rancho Soup in his hand.
If these two novel entrances become boresome,
we submit "Plan X" for consideration. The strategy
of this unique entrance requires that the entire stu
dent body be on hand at the stadium before 12 noon
on the day of the game. The 7,000 rooters will all
clutter up the aisles and show the honored members
of Rally Com to their seats when they arrive.
And finally, if all these ideas are ruled out, we
can always resort to the old-fashioned method of
merely walking down the aisles somewhere near the
50-yard line and quietly finding a place to sit, with
out the aid of Rally Com or dirigibles.
Sincerely,
Ed. Wilson Jim Nash
To the Editor:
It seems to me that methods used to direct the 1
men rooters to their section last Saturday were
neither necessary nor in the interest of the current j
effort to bolster Stanford spirit. The cordons of cops
and their assistants, bent on keeping order, not only
created an unpleasant feeling of regimentation which
could only dampen a student's affection for and gen
uine loyalty to his school, but their presence was
sadly inconsistent with President Tresidder's ideal j
of the self disciplined Stunfoidite.
