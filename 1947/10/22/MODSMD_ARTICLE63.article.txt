# Candidates 'Let Stanford People Know'
## 
### 
Campaign statements from the
candidates competing in today's pri
mary election for off-campus Ex
com representative appear below.
ALAN BALDWIN I am definite
ly against last Wednesday's Excom
decision to ban all organized politi
cal discussion on campus. If I am
elected, I shall consider it a man
date against that decision and do
all I can to get it reversed.
KEN CROFT—As is the case in
any by-election where proponents
of different views are alert to catch
any change in public opinion, this
campaign has an issue which calls
for a definite stand. That issue is
one of freedom of assembly and
peaceful political activity. The most
recent action of our present Excom
in ruling so-called "partisan politi
cal groups" out of the Stanford
sphere is to me nothing less than

I suicidal, a further dampening of po
j litical awareness.
In relation to what our travelers
Fairer and Grannis have brought
back to us about the shameful lack
of political acuity and poor expres
sion of public opinion here in the
U.S., it seems that such an arbitrary
ruling is unwise, and to use a some
what hackneyed yet descriptive
word, "reactionary." No comment is
needed upon the "lock-out" and ad
ministration "briefing" last Wed
nesday night, as Miss Willoughby
covered it well in her "Opinion" let
ter Tuesday.
Local problems of off-campus stu
dents and all students must also be
considered. This calls for real rep
resentation. Our present member of
Excom, Bob Hoyt, is doing a swell
job. I've wached him in action, and

j I hope to be able to keep up the
pace.
Some suggestions have been re
ceived for facilitating activities: the
establishment of an office where the
3,000 of us can clear ideas; a pos
sible installation of a juke box in
the Nitery for an inexpensive eve
ning of dancing with light refresh
ments; and a concerted effort by
students and administration to bring
about a more equitable local bus
with the prime issue of whether or
not we have a STUDENT govern
ment. So cast your vote and let
your wishes be known.
WINSTON 11. ESIILEMAN—I be
lieve in the following policies: (1)
Excom should provide an office for
off-campus students to contact their
representative concerning off-cam
pus problems. (2) The law banning

| political organizations on campus
should be repealed.
GORDON FENNELL—There are
; approximately 3,000 off-campus stu
dents making up the largest group
on Excom. Their representative
should do a real job of representing,
and this, quite simply and without
fanfare, is my objective. I would
like to promote, in every way I can,
the earnest, level-headed, straight
forward student government which
is in keeping with the desires and
opinions of those I would represent.
Go to the polls today, and again
next Wednesday—and see that you
are well represented.
CARL FlELD—Regarding prepa
ration for the office, I have had ex
tensive dealings with Excom in the
past as vice-president of Encina
Hall, summer quarter 1946, and as
I an individual spectator at meetings.

It has always been my opinion
that Excom action should be more
independent of the administration's
influence. Recent example: the lim
ning of partisan political groups on
campus. In last week's banning of
partisan political groups on campus,
Excom enjoyed the dubious privi
lege of a closed session with the ad
ministration prior to the final vote.
Regardless of the virtues of the
policy then established, 1 feel that
the atmosphere surrounding this
decision is all too typical and leaves
much to be desired.
CHARLES TALBOT —As far as
Excom is concerned, I have no pre
conceived program. I feel that all
issues should be settled as they
arise, on their individual merits, and
should nqt be judged by a rigid
policy.

Excom is concerned, I have no pre
conceived program. I feel that all
issues should be settled as they
arise, on their individual merits, and
should nqt be judged by a rigid
policy.
Campaign statements from the
candidates competing in today's pri
mary election for off-campus Ex
com representative appear below.
ALAN BALDWIN I am definite
ly against last Wednesday's Excom
decision to ban all organized politi
cal discussion on campus. If I am
elected, I shall consider it a man
date against that decision and do
all I can to get it reversed.
KEN CROFT—As is the case in
any by-election where proponents
of different views are alert to catch
any change in public opinion, this
campaign has an issue which calls
for a definite stand. That issue is
one of freedom of assembly and
peaceful political activity. The most
recent action of our present Excom
in ruling so-called "partisan politi
cal groups" out of the Stanford
sphere is to me nothing less than

I suicidal, a further dampening of po
j litical awareness.
In relation to what our travelers
Fairer and Grannis have brought
back to us about the shameful lack
of political acuity and poor expres
sion of public opinion here in the
U.S., it seems that such an arbitrary
ruling is unwise, and to use a some
what hackneyed yet descriptive
word, "reactionary." No comment is
needed upon the "lock-out" and ad
ministration "briefing" last Wed
nesday night, as Miss Willoughby
covered it well in her "Opinion" let
ter Tuesday.
Local problems of off-campus stu
dents and all students must also be
considered. This calls for real rep
resentation. Our present member of
Excom, Bob Hoyt, is doing a swell
job. I've wached him in action, and

j I hope to be able to keep up the
pace.
Some suggestions have been re
ceived for facilitating activities: the
establishment of an office where the
3,000 of us can clear ideas; a pos
sible installation of a juke box in
the Nitery for an inexpensive eve
ning of dancing with light refresh
ments; and a concerted effort by
students and administration to bring
about a more equitable local bus
with the prime issue of whether or
not we have a STUDENT govern
ment. So cast your vote and let
your wishes be known.
WINSTON 11. ESIILEMAN—I be
lieve in the following policies: (1)
Excom should provide an office for
off-campus students to contact their
representative concerning off-cam
pus problems. (2) The law banning

| political organizations on campus
should be repealed.
GORDON FENNELL—There are
; approximately 3,000 off-campus stu
dents making up the largest group
on Excom. Their representative
should do a real job of representing,
and this, quite simply and without
fanfare, is my objective. I would
like to promote, in every way I can,
the earnest, level-headed, straight
forward student government which
is in keeping with the desires and
opinions of those I would represent.
Go to the polls today, and again
next Wednesday—and see that you
are well represented.
CARL FlELD—Regarding prepa
ration for the office, I have had ex
tensive dealings with Excom in the
past as vice-president of Encina
Hall, summer quarter 1946, and as
I an individual spectator at meetings.

It has always been my opinion
that Excom action should be more
independent of the administration's
influence. Recent example: the lim
ning of partisan political groups on
campus. In last week's banning of
partisan political groups on campus,
Excom enjoyed the dubious privi
lege of a closed session with the ad
ministration prior to the final vote.
Regardless of the virtues of the
policy then established, 1 feel that
the atmosphere surrounding this
decision is all too typical and leaves
much to be desired.
