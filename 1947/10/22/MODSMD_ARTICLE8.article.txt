# U.S. Shows Jet-Power as 'Spy' Charges Fly
## 'Super-Sonic Plans Lifted' 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 21 (UP).—
The House hearings on Communism
in Hollywood exploded into a movie
style bedlam today when a promi
nent literary agent was accused of
spying into supersonic plane se
crets and a West Coast lawyer was
tossed out for shouting his contempt
for the proceedings.
The outbreak came in the midst of
testimony by anti-Communist film
critic John Moffitt, who followed
actor Adolphe Mcnjou to the wit
ness chair to tell what he knew
about the activities of pro-Commu
nist writers in the movie colony.
TEST PILOT TRICKEI)
Moffitt told the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee (hat lit
erary agent John Weber tricked an
unsuspecting test pilot into writing
an article about a secret, supersonic
American military plane.
The witness said the article was
not censored by U.S. military au
thorities and was relayed by Weber
to Communist headquarters in New
York.
He identified Weber as head of
the literary department of the Wil
liam Morris agency, and the pilot
as Chalmers (Slick) Goodlin, who
flew the supersonic RS-1 in its first
20 test flights at Muroc Dry Lake,
Calif.
Weber said test pilot "Slick"
Goodlin, who had written the ar
ticle, came to the William Morris
agency on his own initiative and
purely for commercial purposes.
"We were under the impression
that he already had orders from na
tional magazines," Weber said.
"What John Charles Moffitt charges
are the product of his own irrespon
sible imagination."
NO SECRETS REVEALED
Air Force officials said the pilot
did violate security by writing
about the plane but that it was not
a serious breach and he was let off
with a reprimand. They said the
article contained no secrets of de
sign that would be of great inter
est to any foreign power.
The information Goodlin wrote
have been released later to the
press, anyway.
Goodlin stopped testing the XS-1,
they explained, because Bell Air
craft completed the first phase of
the tests and turned the plane over
to the military.

the tests and turned the plane over
to the military.
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 21 (UP).—
The House hearings on Communism
in Hollywood exploded into a movie
style bedlam today when a promi
nent literary agent was accused of
spying into supersonic plane se
crets and a West Coast lawyer was
tossed out for shouting his contempt
for the proceedings.
The outbreak came in the midst of
testimony by anti-Communist film
critic John Moffitt, who followed
actor Adolphe Mcnjou to the wit
ness chair to tell what he knew
about the activities of pro-Commu
nist writers in the movie colony.
TEST PILOT TRICKEI)
Moffitt told the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee (hat lit
erary agent John Weber tricked an
unsuspecting test pilot into writing
an article about a secret, supersonic
American military plane.
The witness said the article was
not censored by U.S. military au
thorities and was relayed by Weber
to Communist headquarters in New
York.
He identified Weber as head of
the literary department of the Wil
liam Morris agency, and the pilot
as Chalmers (Slick) Goodlin, who
flew the supersonic RS-1 in its first
20 test flights at Muroc Dry Lake,
Calif.
Weber said test pilot "Slick"
Goodlin, who had written the ar
ticle, came to the William Morris
agency on his own initiative and
purely for commercial purposes.
"We were under the impression
that he already had orders from na
tional magazines," Weber said.
"What John Charles Moffitt charges
are the product of his own irrespon
sible imagination."
NO SECRETS REVEALED
Air Force officials said the pilot
did violate security by writing
about the plane but that it was not
a serious breach and he was let off
with a reprimand. They said the
article contained no secrets of de
sign that would be of great inter
est to any foreign power.
The information Goodlin wrote
have been released later to the
press, anyway.
Goodlin stopped testing the XS-1,
they explained, because Bell Air
craft completed the first phase of
the tests and turned the plane over
to the military.
