# Artist Murray Bookstore Guest
## 
### 
Justin Murray, artist, was in the
Bookstore yesterday to autograph
copies of his new book, "Cable Car
Daze." He is a native San Francis
can and, from experience, in the
book gives his impressions in draw
ings with captions, of the present
situation of the cars.
In "Cable Car Daze," cartoons de
pict the ancient cars, the passen
gers, and the crew as they scale the
hills. He contrasts these with the
busses, about which he is a fanatic,
showing them as having no charac
ter or colors.
During the war, he did a series
called "Birds of Our Times," which
are watercolors of Hitler, Churchill,
Stalin, and other world leaders.
"Cable Car Daze" is on sale in the
Bookstore for $3.50.
