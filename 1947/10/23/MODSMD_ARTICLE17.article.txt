# Future Stanford Museum Envisioned As True Paradise for Art Collectors

### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is the last in a series of three articles on the Iceland Stanford
Junior Museum. The museum, however, is closed for inventory. A
picture of the museum of tomorrow and"the men behind the story
arc the subjects of today's articlc.)

A spell of historical dress rehearsal has crept into the Stanford
Museum and only the passage of time can foretell what will be
accomplished in the years to come!
"The Big Show," Dr. Ray N. Faulkner, professor of art in charge

of the museum, was wont to say,
"has yet to begin. We arc working
on various details in getting the col
lections ready for display."
The project of supervising, reas
signing, and cataloguing the numer
ous subjects of art is one that ap
proaches "an Herculean task." Sev
eral collections are in need of au
thoritative confirmation in regard to
their status of antiquity.
"As long as the museum is closed,
collections from the Museum can
easily be transferred to the Art Gal
lery for exhibition," Dr. Faulkner
said. "In that way, one would see a
portion of the objects in concentrated
form, so to speak."
There is the glowing possibility

that students may make use of the
museum for research on anthropo
logical studies. And there was fore
cast a plan for inaugurating "mu
seum technique" courses in the near
future for Stanford students.
The local museum, despite being
closed for more than two years, is
still acknowledged as one of the best
museums in the country.
"Of course, we're not in a position
to defend our standing," Dr. Faulk
ner declared, "but, generally speak
ing. I do believe this museum is bet
ter than most college buildings of a
like nature."
Visitors from distant regions on

touring the Farm have hocn annoyed
;il "not being able to sec the inside
of the museum."
"However," Dr. Faulkner contin
ued, "despite being sorry about, the
whole matter, people must believe
we Hie not in any position to open
the museum as yet."
A look into the future concerning
the museums of tomorrow was un
veiled in enthusiastic overtures, for
no more will the superabundance of
items in collections be stressed.
"Instead," he said, "directors will
try to have the most significant and
interesting articles on display with a
complete and careful story telling
of their importance to mankind.
"There are numerous instances
where people get tired even before
they stall looking at the second
display. Take away all the insignifi
cant items. Stress the interesting
objects. That will do the trick!"
Ambition and a tense longing to
have the doors drawn aside is evi
dent. Patience must be maintained,
museum officials have declared, for
tomorrow may be the day for a
"glimpse of the yesterdays."
