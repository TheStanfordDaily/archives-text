# Activity Committee Requests Data From Campus Organization Heads
## 
### 
A request for the name, living
group, and telephone number of the
president of each campus organiza
tion was made yesterday by Jean
Strong, co-chairman of Activity
Committee.
"We are now servicing almost 100
activity groups," commented Miss
Strong, "and this information is vital
to insure efficiency in handling re
quests."
The Activity Files, consisting of
the names and qualifications of some
1800 student volunteers are available
for use Mondays and Wednesdays
from 1 to 3 p.m. in room 1 of the
Student Union.
EXHAUSTIVE LIST
"By means of these files," Miss
Strong continued, "activity chairmen
have at their disposal an exhaustive
list of student volunteers, their in
terests, and capabilities. Typists,
filers, musicians, speakers, polylin
guists, composers, writers, and en
tertainers are only a few of the ca
pabilities listed."
Miss Strong stressed the fact that
as soon as the more pressing needs
of the activity groups had been met,
the emphasis of the committee will
be on acquainting the student body
as a whole with the wealth of ac-

tivity groups open to their partici
pation.
RECREATIONAL CLUB
"One Rood example is the 16 rec
reational clubs," she remarked.
''Most students seem to feel that
with the exception of dances and
open-houses they must leave the
campus for recreational activity.
When the functions of these recrea
tional clubs have been publicized
and the students are more aware of
what they have to offer, we feel cer
tain the benefit to all will be sub
stantial."
The other major groups also
scheduled to be publicized are
speech, drama, and debate; radio;
publications; musical activities; spe
cial student agencies; international
relations groups; religious organi
zations; national student organiza
tions; special studies or interest
groups; and honorary and profess
ional societies.
