# Village Christian Group Sets Plans
## 
### 
About 20 people attended a meet
ing of what is tentatively being
called the Village Christian Associ
ation last Tuesday night. This is the
group Gale Englc, Village chaplain,
called together to lay plans for re
ligious activities at the Village.
A program committee under the
chairmanship of Larry Brott, Build
ing 2(WA, is going to arrange for a
series of fireside forums to be held,
most likely, in the Village Club
house. The discussion will include
international affairs, theological sub
jects, and social problems.
An attempt was made at the
meeting to decide just what the
group is. The "Village Christian As
sociation," as they arc calling them
selves now, hopes to include more
than church-goers. It Ls also meant
to be non-denominational.
During the past week the Sunday
school committee has been develop
ing plans for a Sunday school for
Village children. At present, chil
dren of primary school age would
be expected to attend a Sunday
school on campus, which would also
be for the children of ofT-campus
students. However, a school for kin
dergarten-age children could he set
up in the Village. Chaplain Engle
and Mrs. James Cross, Building 213,
Apt. 10, arc interviewing people for
the position of Sunday school teach
er.
