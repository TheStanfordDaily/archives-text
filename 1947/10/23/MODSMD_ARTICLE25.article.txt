# Farm Delegation Named; Chairman Resigns Post
## 
### 
More than 8,000 Stanford students provisionally joined the
National Students' Association when Excom voted 8-to-l last
night to join the organization contingent upon the Stanford dele
gation's report on the regional conference to be held on campus
this weekend.

► The following persons were ap
proved last night by Excom as
delegates to the regional confer
; ence of the NSA:
Tom MarUlofT, Guyla Runyan,
(«inny Titus, Chuck Martin, Hill
Fairer, and Sandy Stuart.
The following persons were se
lected as alternates:
Cary Fisher, Pat DeYoung, Bet
j sy Brown, Sally Brown, Emmy
Harding, and Ann Kiinber.
Rod Rogaway, who has been
chairman of NSA since spring quar
ter, announced his resignation last
night. Rogaway, a graduate history
student, had been named to the post
to succeed Marilyn Sidwcll, who or
ganized the Stanford NSA chapter.
NO SUCCESSOR YET
Since Rogaway's resignation wa.
not brought up at Excom meeting,
no action has yet been taken to find
a successor.
The amount of dues Stanford
would have to pay if it joined the
organization proved the chief point
of doubt last night. Dues would
amount to about $320 a year, which
would go to the national body, and
approximately $130, which would
go into the regional treasury.
Some members of Excom thought
that the amount was too high and
suggested investigation of the issue.
POLITICAL QUESTION
Another point of contention cen
tered around the political nature of
the lUS (International Union of
Students). NSA has sent a commis
sion to lUS to work out ratification
proceedings now.
lUS is "red-hot" politically, Rill
Fairer told Excom. It was further
argued thai this would indirectly
bind Stanford to its political views
However, an American minority re
port may be appended to any lUS
political statement which is not in
accordance with American student*'
views, contended Ginny Titus.
