# Sequoia Hall, First Coed Dorm, Now Empty; Housed Modest Girls and Immortal Roughs
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Sequoia Hall may be an old shell now, but more than 50
years ago, when it housed Farm coeds, Stanford's first social
event was held there.
At that time Sequoia—oops, it was Roble then—women wel
r omed men students to a reception at the hall on Oct. 9, 1891.

lint the story does not end there.
Encina freshmen decided they
hould return the compliment to the
Roble women, and a dance at Encina
was slated for the following Oct. 28.

men of later years, these first-year

was postponed.
Before the quarter ended, acquain
tances were undoubtedly made, for
Roble's kitchen had not been com

was served at the Encina kitchen.
HAI,L CONDEMNED
Sequoia Hall, now standing empty
following a University condemna
tion two years ago, is only a shadow
of the building the Stanfords had
once planned to build.
Back in 1891 Mrs. Stanford wanted
the Farm to be co-educational as
soon as facilities existed. Sched
uled for its grand opening Oct. 1,
1891, Stanford blueprints called for
only one completed dormitory—En
cina, for men.
The Stanfords had planned on a
women's dorm to be the duplicate
of Encina down to the last door knob.
Early in 1891 they decided to follow
a recommendation that the admission
of women be delayed for a year or
I wo in order to complete the hall.
Because construction of the large
women's hall proceded so slowly,
Mrs. Stanford decided that if women
were to be admitted at all they had
better come in at the same time as
the men on a status of perfect
equality.
SIZE CUT DOWN
Dr. Jordon confirmed her opinion.
Here began the reas6n Sequoia is

only a shadow of what it was sup
posed to be. Work on the duplicate
of Encina was suspended, and in
May a concrete structure of about
a third its size was begun. By Oct
1, 1891, the old Roble Hall, now
known as Sequoia, opened its doors
to the Farm's first women.
Sequoia housed women from 1891
till 1918 when the new Roble Hall
was constructed. After 1918 the
famed Sequoia Roughs took charge
of the renamed hall and racked up
a history as enlightening as that
possessed by the freshmen's Encina.
R()l?<;ilS RETURN AXE
Of course the favorite honor
notched in the dorm's history is that
of the "Immortal 21" who recaptured
the Axe from Cal on April 3, 1930,
as the trophy was being returned to
the American Trust Company bank
in Berkeley.
When the Roughs returned to Se

quoia with the Axe, the dorm's resi
dents examined the famous blade,
called a celebration, and paraded
their trophy throughout, the campus
for the first time in 31 years.
Sequoia was condemned by the
University in September, 1945, after
a group of engineers made a thor
ough examination of the hall. Drill -
ing tests made by the group revealed
the walls' unsoundness. It was
found throughout the dorm that the
concrete was crumbling and pow
dery.
RAZING FORECAST
Eventually the historic dorm will
have to be torn down, the President's
Office said. The building cannot be
redeemed because decay has vir
tually eaten it away. While some
sections on the lower floor are used
for light# storage, the use is only of
a minor nature, the Office said.
When Sequoia will be torn down
is unknown at present. But since
the building is causing no one any
trouble, the University will prob
ably let it stand until finances war
rant the hall's destruction.

of women be delayed for a year or

were to be admitted at all they had

the men on a status of perfect
equality.

of the building the Stanfords had
once planned to build.
Back in 1891 Mrs. Stanford wanted
the Farm to be co-educational as
soon as facilities existed. Sched
uled for its grand opening Oct. 1,
1891, Stanford blueprints called for
only one completed dormitory—En
cina, for men.
The Stanfords had planned on a
women's dorm to be the duplicate
of Encina down to the last door knob.
Early in 1891 they decided to follow
a recommendation that the admission
of women be delayed for a year or
I wo in order to complete the hall.
Because construction of the large
women's hall proceded so slowly,
Mrs. Stanford decided that if women
were to be admitted at all they had
better come in at the same time as
the men on a status of perfect
equality.

Dr. Jordon confirmed her opinion.
Here began the reas6n Sequoia is

only a shadow of what it was sup
posed to be. Work on the duplicate
of Encina was suspended, and in
May a concrete structure of about
a third its size was begun. By Oct
1, 1891, the old Roble Hall, now
known as Sequoia, opened its doors
to the Farm's first women.
Sequoia housed women from 1891
till 1918 when the new Roble Hall
was constructed. After 1918 the
famed Sequoia Roughs took charge
of the renamed hall and racked up
a history as enlightening as that
possessed by the freshmen's Encina.
R()l?<;ilS RETURN AXE
Of course the favorite honor
notched in the dorm's history is that
of the "Immortal 21" who recaptured
the Axe from Cal on April 3, 1930,
as the trophy was being returned to
the American Trust Company bank
in Berkeley.
When the Roughs returned to Se

quoia with the Axe, the dorm's resi
dents examined the famous blade,
called a celebration, and paraded
their trophy throughout, the campus
for the first time in 31 years.
Sequoia was condemned by the
University in September, 1945, after
a group of engineers made a thor
ough examination of the hall. Drill -
ing tests made by the group revealed
the walls' unsoundness. It was
found throughout the dorm that the
concrete was crumbling and pow
dery.
RAZING FORECAST
Eventually the historic dorm will
have to be torn down, the President's
Office said. The building cannot be
redeemed because decay has vir
tually eaten it away. While some
sections on the lower floor are used
for light# storage, the use is only of
a minor nature, the Office said.
When Sequoia will be torn down
is unknown at present. But since
the building is causing no one any
trouble, the University will prob
ably let it stand until finances war
rant the hall's destruction.
Sequoia Hall may be an old shell now, but more than 50
years ago, when it housed Farm coeds, Stanford's first social
event was held there.
At that time Sequoia—oops, it was Roble then—women wel
r omed men students to a reception at the hall on Oct. 9, 1891.
