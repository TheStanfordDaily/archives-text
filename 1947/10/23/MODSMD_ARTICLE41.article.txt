# Card Gridders Hit Husky Trail Today
## 
### 
Coach Marchie Schwartz and 37 Indian footballers leave for
Washington this afternoon, with hopes of annexing their first
win of the current season against the University of Washington
Huskies Saturday.
Among other things they will run into in the Northwest will

be :iri old nemesis in the form of
Musky end Dick Hagen. Last year,
it may be remembered, Hagen was
virtually immovable as Washington
edged the Cards 21-15.
Also back on the Washington ros
ier are half Fred Provo and center
Ciordy Berlin. On Provo, who star
red in last January's Shrine East-
West classic, rests much of Coach
Pest Welch's vaunted running at
tack.
SCHWARTZ NOT OPTIMISTIC
Yesterday afternoon, Coach
Schwartz didn't sound too opti
mistic. Team injuries, although not
of the serious variety, still keep the
top backfield men from performing
at peak efficiency.
"We have to s juggle the backs
constantly," he said. "How long
they can last depends on just how
rough the going is."
Bob Anderson, who is just round
ing into form after an injurious
start this season,, may run a few
plays from the fullback spot. George
Quist, slightly wounded Indian
right half will be used primarily on
defense.
Washington's seasonal standing is
not much brighter than the Indians'.
After outplaying Minnesota in their
opening game, only to lose 7-(>, the
Huskies dropped games to Oregon
and Oregon Slate, while winning
only one, that against the Saint
Mary's Gaels.

Washington Huskies won't lie
seeing KEN PECK this weekend.
The redheaded right half pulled
a muscle in practice and will not
make the northern trip with the
Indians.
Coach Marchie Schwartz and 37 Indian footballers leave for
Washington this afternoon, with hopes of annexing their first
win of the current season against the University of Washington
Huskies Saturday.
Among other things they will run into in the Northwest will

be :iri old nemesis in the form of
Musky end Dick Hagen. Last year,
it may be remembered, Hagen was
virtually immovable as Washington
edged the Cards 21-15.
Also back on the Washington ros
ier are half Fred Provo and center
Ciordy Berlin. On Provo, who star
red in last January's Shrine East-
West classic, rests much of Coach
Pest Welch's vaunted running at
tack.
SCHWARTZ NOT OPTIMISTIC
Yesterday afternoon, Coach
Schwartz didn't sound too opti
mistic. Team injuries, although not
of the serious variety, still keep the
top backfield men from performing
at peak efficiency.
"We have to s juggle the backs
constantly," he said. "How long
they can last depends on just how
rough the going is."
Bob Anderson, who is just round
ing into form after an injurious
start this season,, may run a few
plays from the fullback spot. George
Quist, slightly wounded Indian
right half will be used primarily on
defense.
Washington's seasonal standing is
not much brighter than the Indians'.
After outplaying Minnesota in their
opening game, only to lose 7-(>, the
Huskies dropped games to Oregon
and Oregon Slate, while winning
only one, that against the Saint
Mary's Gaels.
