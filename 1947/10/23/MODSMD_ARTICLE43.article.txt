# 'Mural Rules Reorganized
## 
### 
All intramural team managers are
requested by director Chuck Taylor
to pick up a complete copy of the
revised rules for intramural compe
tition in the Intramural Director's
office in the SAC.
The revised rules are the result
of the managers' meeting held last
Monday night, when the new league
assignments were also announced.
Although five teams have dropped
from their leagues, it is impossible
at this late date to include any more
teams in their place, Taylor added.
VILLAGE TEAMS IJKOP
Village 110 and Village 210 (II)
have both dropped their volleyball
teams from Leagues X and IX,
respectively, and the remaining
squads in those leagues which were
originally scheduled to play these
two clubs now draw an automatic
bye.
Village 108 has now been added to
League V in touch football compe
tition, filling that league out to its
full complement of six teams, so
that all organizations in that league
formerly assigned a bye will play
Village 108. Similarly, the Village
157 footballers have been substitut
ed in League X for the Encina 4E
(2) aggregation, and will replace the
men's dorm in all games yet to be
played in that league.
SATURDAY SCHEDULE
The final placings in League XI,
the gridmen who square off every

Saturday morning, have been set as
follows: Village 308, Breakers, Kap
pa Alpha (2), Toyon 135, and Vil
lage 214, with Toyon 135 taking the
place of Village 108.
The main alteration provided by
the new regulations covers the af
termath of a safety, when the team
on which the two points were scored
now gets to put the ball in play on
their own 15-yard fine with either
a free kick, or take one play to make
a first down on the 20-yard line.
