# 310 Tramples Encina, 31-0
## 
### 
A well-organized Village 310 team
swamped Encina 2W 31-0 yesterday
as the Encinainen were unable to
cope with the backfield speed and
passing efficiency of the Villagers.
Gregg Beemis climaxed the first
Village scoring drive by sweeping
around end for a touchdown. On the
next kick-off, an on-side kick was
recovered by the Villagers, and alter
a series of short gains, White, find
ing a big hole through center, scamp
ered all the way for the score.
LEASE TO CRIST
On the first play from scrimmage
in the second half, Pat Lease flipped
a short pass to Robb Crist who
rambled the remaining distance to
pay dirt. Two long pass plays, Lease
to Harris and Beemis to Lease set
up the final two tallies for the
villagers.
The Freshmen never threatened to
score, but the passing of Bob Chase
and Emil Teyssier produced several
long gains.
