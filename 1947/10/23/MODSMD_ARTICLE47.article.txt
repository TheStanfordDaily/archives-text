# Dunkers Meet UCLA Friday
## 
### 
The Encina Pools will be the site
of feverish water activities this
weekend, as Stanford's southern di
vision championship water polo
team begins its conference season
against UCLA tomorrow afternoon,
and then tangles with Fullerton JC
in a non-conference tilt Saturday
morning.
Despite their record of two losses
and no wins in early season non
conference play, the winless Indians
are favored to score their first vic
tory at the Bruins' expense. Al
though vastly improved over last
season's basement squad, the luck
less Westwoodians are not tabbed
to finish much higher this season.
Fullerton JC. on the other hand,
while perpetually a water polo
threat, is an unknown quantity so
far this year.
The Fullerton coach, James
Smith, is a nationally recognized
authority and writer on the sport,
and is widely respected for the
many chapionship squads that he
has turned out.
