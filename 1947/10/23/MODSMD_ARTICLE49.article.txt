MORAGA, Oct. 22 (UP).—An un
dermanned St. Mary's football team
suffered a crippling blow today
when two first - stringers, fullback
Willie Modrcin and center Jack Fla
german, withdrew from school.
Coach Jimmy Phelan said Mo
drcin was dissatisfied after the Gaels
lost three straight games, and plan
ned to transfer to another college
after a year. Flagermun said he had
been ill with a recurrence of mala
ria, losing 30 pounds in weight from
his normal 215.
At Berkeley, Johnny Graves, Cal
ifornia's speedy fullback and the
West's best groundgainer, was suit
ed up again today in practice—
quelling fears that he might not
play against Southern California in
the coast "football game of the year"
here Saturday.
Coach Lynn Waldorf said he had
given Graves a one-day rest to re
cover from a "slight bruise" suffered
against Washington State last week.
The Golden Bears again ran through
new plays they plan to hurl against
use.
