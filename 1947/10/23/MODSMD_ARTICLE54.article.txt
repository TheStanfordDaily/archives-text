Student Government without student inter
est and cooperation is futile.
How can Excom be a truly representative
and effective organization if its members are
elected by only a handful of the student elect
orate, with the majority displaying either
apathy or antagonism toward student govern
ment in general, and Excom in particular?
The ultimate in apathy was displayed when
only 279 of close to 3,000 off-campus students
voted in the election to fill the District 1
Excom vacancy.

If this condition was confined to off-campus
students, the problem would be less serious.
But it is a campus-wide situation.
The election for Student Body President,
with all its colorful personal and political side
lights, will draw the voters to the polls. But a
less colorful or allegedly less important elec
tion draws only a minority of the voters.
Why should student government exist at
all, if the students themselves have little or no
interest in it D.D.
