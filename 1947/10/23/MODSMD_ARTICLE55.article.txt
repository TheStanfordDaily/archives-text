# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
I see that 25 percent of the students are having
colds. In other words 3 out of 4 people today aren't
having colds, and in my case it's 6, because I have
my cold and somebody else's, too.
My dear old grandmother used to have a recipe
for roast chicken which she claimed was a sure cure
for a cold. You roast the chicken in the oven, and
after the first 10 minutes you take it out and baste it
with half a pint of bourbon. Roast for ten minutes
more and baste with half a pint of rum. Roast a
little longer, and then baste with half a pint of
brandy. After 15 minutes the chicken is ready. The
best bet is to throw the chicken away and drink the
gravy. If it doesn't cure your cold it will at least
put you in the frame of mind where you don't
care.
Somebody during the day always manages to
say:
"My, that's a nasty cold you have. What are you
doing for it?"
The answer, of course, should be:
"Not a damn thing. What's it doing for me?"
It has been said that if every man, woman, and
child that had a cold last year were laid end to end,
it certainly would have been more comfortable than

walking around blowing your nose every two minutes.
What a boon to the tissue paper companies. I've got
the only loose leaf binder at Stanford with a built
in Kleenex dispenser. Every time a driver blows his
horn I automatically open the binder.
Then too, there's always the possibility that a cold
will develop into something bigger and better like
double petunia.
For those of you who haven't heard what double
petunia is it goes something like this:
A petunia is a flower like a begonia. A begonia
is a meat like a sausage. A sausage and battery is a
crime. Monkeys crime trees. And trees a crowd.
And the rooster crowd in the morning and made a
big noise. Your noise is on your face like your eyes.
Horses also got eyes. Horses also got colts some
times. So you go to bed thinking you've got a colt,
and when you wake up in the morning it's double
petunia.
At any rate I'm fed up with my cold. My nasal
passages are closed tighter than a Pullman window,
and the old proboscis is as red as a Hollywood in
vestigation.
Anyone interested in sharing expenses to Ari
zona can get in touch with me in the rest home,
starting tomorrow.
