# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As a graduate student and a Resident Assistant
having a fair idea of student opinion, I would like
to make personal exception to one statement in Joan
Willoughby's letter in Campus Opinion on October
21st. She said, "student government, a little play
thing cut down to their size ..." This is, I believe,
both an untrue and unfair statement.
Those of us who have attended other colleges are
particularly convinced that Stanford student gov
ernment is truly of, for, and by the students, and,
having heard in person representative opinion of the
administration, I know they do back this opinion.
It's a training ground for good citizenship in any
part of the world, in any business, social, political
or any other kind of organization. This, Joan must
know if she has taken the opportunity to become an
active part of student government.
