Bravo Joan Willoughby! She took the words

Betty Berzon
To the Editor:
Recent Campus Opinion letters seem to be inter
ested in filling an alleged political vacuum in political
consciousness here at Stanford through the activity
here of national political organizations, set up on the
same basis as any other student club.
Two and a half weeks ago I attended an open
meeting of one such organization, the proposed Stan
ford chapter of the Progressive Citizens of America,
whose application for an ASSU charter was the im
mediate cause fur Excom's Wednesday night action.
Three times, in presenting the general policy of the
organization and later, in answer to two specific
questions from the floor, the directors of this meeting
.stated that the policy of the Stanford chapter would
be determined solely by its student members here.
This being contrary to the PCA constitution else
where, which states that all local chapters must
comply with the objectives of the national organiza
tion, I questioned a few of the meeting's leaders pri
vately on the point.
The first, the one who had read the policy state
ment to the meeting, admitted what seemed to me
and others who heard him, a deliberate misrepresent
aiton of the facts, lie said it was true that the major
points listed on (heir mimeographed "platform'

were determined by the national organization and
had to be adhered to by the local organization,
although the latter could debate the resolutions
before rubber-stamping them. He apologized for
what he admitted were misleading statements —but
said that it was too late to rectify the erroneous im
pression left with those who had attended the
meeting.
The second PCA-cr was more belligerent. He in
formed me brusquely that anyone who joined the
organization would obviously support such PCA
policies as the condemnation of the American Foreign
policy and the Taft-Hartley Bill, along with the other
11 items on the PCA "Program of Action," or not
join in the first place. He forgot about the objective,
discussions with no preconceived conclusions which
had been promised all of us just half an hour before.
Does an organization which paints a picture of
independent political thought with one hand while the
other force-feeds we politically immature college
students with one side, the left side, of such im
portant and controversial questions represent any
one's conception of "training for democracy?" Re
member, each member is going to be counted,
whether he likes it or not, among those supporting
the entire PCA program. At this open meeting, the
PCA organizers voiced strong objections to the
entire Taft-Hartley Labor Bill. Yet, all of them
together seemed to be able to name only four or five
of the fourteen clauses in the bill to all of which
they claim to be unequivocally opposed. Are they
really thinking these issues through, or just climbing
up a rainbow after some high-sounding ideals about
"progress/" and "humanity," and the "oppressed
worker," —who happens to be a little better off now
than ever before, despite higher taxes and living
costs? Is that political education—or indoctrina
tion?
Don't underestimate our students. I'm sure that
the PCA can't present any more convincing argu
ments for its proposals than it did the other night,
and the great thinking majority of Stanford students
will refuse to be misled by such nebulous idealism.
For this reason it's probably unimportant whether
any political organization meets on campus or not.
But if we must have a political club here, why
not make it independent and its actions really free?
If any of us have any political action to take which
needs a party organization, there are plenty of them
in Palo Alto which would welcome us.
Stanford is an educational institution. That in
cludes politics. But let's get the facts and learn for
ourselves, not take the word of some national com
mittee that some certain action stands for "Prog
ress" and that anyone who disagrees is hopelessly
lust to thr forces of reaction.

what he admitted were misleading statements —but
said that it was too late to rectify the erroneous im
pression left with those who had attended the
meeting.
The second PCA-cr was more belligerent. He in
formed me brusquely that anyone who joined the
organization would obviously support such PCA
policies as the condemnation of the American Foreign
policy and the Taft-Hartley Bill, along with the other
11 items on the PCA "Program of Action," or not
join in the first place. He forgot about the objective,
discussions with no preconceived conclusions which
had been promised all of us just half an hour before.
Does an organization which paints a picture of
independent political thought with one hand while the
other force-feeds we politically immature college
students with one side, the left side, of such im
portant and controversial questions represent any
one's conception of "training for democracy?" Re
member, each member is going to be counted,
whether he likes it or not, among those supporting
the entire PCA program. At this open meeting, the
PCA organizers voiced strong objections to the
entire Taft-Hartley Labor Bill. Yet, all of them
together seemed to be able to name only four or five
of the fourteen clauses in the bill to all of which
they claim to be unequivocally opposed. Are they
really thinking these issues through, or just climbing
up a rainbow after some high-sounding ideals about
"progress/" and "humanity," and the "oppressed
worker," —who happens to be a little better off now
than ever before, despite higher taxes and living
costs? Is that political education—or indoctrina
tion?
Don't underestimate our students. I'm sure that
the PCA can't present any more convincing argu
ments for its proposals than it did the other night,
and the great thinking majority of Stanford students
will refuse to be misled by such nebulous idealism.
For this reason it's probably unimportant whether
any political organization meets on campus or not.
But if we must have a political club here, why
not make it independent and its actions really free?
If any of us have any political action to take which
needs a party organization, there are plenty of them
in Palo Alto which would welcome us.
Stanford is an educational institution. That in
cludes politics. But let's get the facts and learn for
ourselves, not take the word of some national com
mittee that some certain action stands for "Prog
ress" and that anyone who disagrees is hopelessly
lust to thr forces of reaction.

Recent Campus Opinion letters seem to be inter
ested in filling an alleged political vacuum in political
consciousness here at Stanford through the activity
here of national political organizations, set up on the
same basis as any other student club.
Two and a half weeks ago I attended an open
meeting of one such organization, the proposed Stan
ford chapter of the Progressive Citizens of America,
whose application for an ASSU charter was the im
mediate cause fur Excom's Wednesday night action.
Three times, in presenting the general policy of the
organization and later, in answer to two specific
questions from the floor, the directors of this meeting
.stated that the policy of the Stanford chapter would
be determined solely by its student members here.
This being contrary to the PCA constitution else
where, which states that all local chapters must
comply with the objectives of the national organiza
tion, I questioned a few of the meeting's leaders pri
vately on the point.
The first, the one who had read the policy state
ment to the meeting, admitted what seemed to me
and others who heard him, a deliberate misrepresent
aiton of the facts, lie said it was true that the major
points listed on (heir mimeographed "platform'

were determined by the national organization and
had to be adhered to by the local organization,
although the latter could debate the resolutions
before rubber-stamping them. He apologized for
what he admitted were misleading statements —but
said that it was too late to rectify the erroneous im
