# Bobby-Sox' Humor Misses the Mark
## 
### BUD KEENAN 
Whatever humor once existed in
regard to that peculiar American
phenomenon, the bobby-soxer, has
been thoroughly exploited and re
duced to its final absurdity in "The
Bachelor and the Bobby - Soxer."
Obviously Hollywood has felt a cer
tain duty toward a confused post
war world and has attempted, in
this gleaming little package of gen
teel nonsense, to clear up the tan
gled mores of unsettled peoples.
POTATO SACKS AND IIOT RODS
For we have, in this comedy of
potato-sack races and hot-rod cars,
a final summing-up of all that bob
by-soxers ever were or ever hope to
be. This harmless little picture
calmly points out the maladjust-

j ments and purposeless drudgery of
| adult existence and comes all out
for the sort of life that is practiced
| among the soda-fountain set.
"The Bachelor and the Bobby-
Soxer" springs directly from such
ancestral films as "Janie," "Kiss and
Tell," and "Dear Ruth," in which
the terrorizing of helpless parents
by their over - glandular offspring
was the usual formula. But it now
seems that the bobby-soxers and
their cohorts have grown consider
ably wiser through the years and
that grown-ups are seriously think
ing of turning to their little ways
| for the 112 uller appreciation of life.

Cary Grant and Shirley Temple
' handle the title roles (respectively)

and Myrna Loy, in the part of a
judge, joins in the fun as soon as
she sees the light and discards her
judicial inhibitions. Besides the
aforementioned trio, the story con
cerns a frustrated basketball player,
an ardent district attorney, and an
old family doctor who knows what's
going on all along. There is also, to
ward the end of the film, a picnic
in which the whole thing is
straightened out with games and
good fun for everybody.
If you're still able to get around
and aren't too encrusted with ma
turity, you might get a few laughs
out of this offering, but they're pret
ty far apart.

Whatever humor once existed in
regard to that peculiar American
phenomenon, the bobby-soxer, has
been thoroughly exploited and re
duced to its final absurdity in "The
Bachelor and the Bobby - Soxer."
Obviously Hollywood has felt a cer
tain duty toward a confused post
war world and has attempted, in
this gleaming little package of gen
teel nonsense, to clear up the tan
gled mores of unsettled peoples.
POTATO SACKS AND IIOT RODS
For we have, in this comedy of
potato-sack races and hot-rod cars,
a final summing-up of all that bob
by-soxers ever were or ever hope to
be. This harmless little picture
calmly points out the maladjust-

j ments and purposeless drudgery of
| adult existence and comes all out
for the sort of life that is practiced
| among the soda-fountain set.
"The Bachelor and the Bobby-
Soxer" springs directly from such
ancestral films as "Janie," "Kiss and
Tell," and "Dear Ruth," in which
the terrorizing of helpless parents
by their over - glandular offspring
was the usual formula. But it now
seems that the bobby-soxers and
their cohorts have grown consider
ably wiser through the years and
that grown-ups are seriously think
ing of turning to their little ways
| for the 112 uller appreciation of life.
GRANT AND TEMPLE STAR
Cary Grant and Shirley Temple
' handle the title roles (respectively)

and Myrna Loy, in the part of a
judge, joins in the fun as soon as
she sees the light and discards her
judicial inhibitions. Besides the
aforementioned trio, the story con
cerns a frustrated basketball player,
an ardent district attorney, and an
old family doctor who knows what's
going on all along. There is also, to
ward the end of the film, a picnic
in which the whole thing is
straightened out with games and
good fun for everybody.
If you're still able to get around
and aren't too encrusted with ma
turity, you might get a few laughs
out of this offering, but they're pret
ty far apart.
