# Photo Club Plans Meeting Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford Camera Club will
hold its first meeting of the year
this evening at 7:'50 in the Village
Auditorium. Enrollment of mem
bership and a slide-illustrated lec
ture on "How to Make an Enlarge
ment" will be the main items on the
agenda.
This first meeting, club president
Jim Joseph announced, will not last
more than one hour, and all stu
dents interested in photography are
urged to attend. Joseph will de
liver a lecture prepared by the
Eastman Kodak Company.
The main purpose of this meeting,
it was announced, is to organize the
club's activities for the coming year.
A special questionnaire has been
prepared to determine what phases
of photography club members want
to study. Most plans for the future
will await the election of new offi
cers at the first meeting in Novem
ber.
The enrollment of the club mem
bers and the distribution of mem
bership cards will also include the
payment of dues. The membership
fee is $1, and an additional $1 is
charged for the use of the club
darkrooms.
The club now owns a fully equip
ped and insured darkroom in the
Village and is working on another.
Joseph stated that he would like to
see a darkroom built on the cam
pus, possibly in Encina or Toyon,
but no concrete plans have yet been
formed.
