# YWCA Holds Membership Meet Today
## 
### 
''The YWCA takes an active and
personal part in the life of every
Stanford woman. Come to our mem
bership meeting today and find out
what part it can take in your life."
Thus stressing the importance of
the individual in the new expanded
"Y" program, Sydney Morgan, vice
president, invited all members and
those interested in joining to the
meeting this afternoon at 4:15 in the
"Y" rooms.
PURPOSES EXPLAINED
The purposes of the "Y," both
Christian and practical, will be ex
plained by Peg Milnor, president, at
a mass meeting. Following this,
small discussion groups will learn of
the practical means planned by the
commissions for attaining these
ends.
The YWCA's program is centered
around the Christian faith, which
is divided into four groups repre
senting the four sections of each in
dividual's life: Social Responsibility,
Personal and Campus Affairs, Chris
tian Heritage, and World Related
ness. At last week's cabinet retreat,
a definite program for these commis
sions was planned.
FIRST MEETING
Miss Morgan emphasized that the
meeting this afternoon will be the
first by any of these commissions.
Urging everyone to attend, she
said:
"If we have a thousand members,
but only affect 20 or 30, we won't
feel our program has been success
ful. Come to the meeting and find
out what the "Y" can do for you.
Besides, we're serving refreshments."
