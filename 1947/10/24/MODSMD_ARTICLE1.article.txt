# Indian Varsity to Invade Huskies' Home Territory; Ainslie Bell Captains Injury-Ridden Aggregation
## 
### 
Stanford's football varsity, 37
strong, invades the great North
west tomorrow, in a battle with the
University of Washington Huskies
which could conceivably decide the
1947 basement championship of the
Pacific Coast conference.
Neither the Huskies nor Indians
have hit winning ways in conference
play as yet this season, Washington
dropping two games, Oregon and

Stanford's varsity gridders, on
their way north to engage the
Washington Huskies this week
end, escaped injury when their
bus struck a car near San Carlos
yesterday afternoon.
The acident occurred when the
driver of the bus swerved to avoid
a heavy truck, and hit the car
driven by Ruth Radkc of Wil
liams. The team continued on
their way to the train in Oakland
in another bus.
(See story by George Newell
on page 5.)

Oregon State, and Stanford losing to
UCLA and Idaho.
The prospect of wet weather Sat
urday has helped shove Seattle bet
ting odds to 5-1 in favor of the
Huskies, with even money at 18
points.
For Washington has played a ma
jority of its games in the rain. In
fact, in their season's opener with
Minnesota, the Huskies completely
outplayed the Gophers in a torren
tial downpour, only to lose 7-6.
Hopes of Stanford backers took

another nose-dive with the an
nouncement that right halfback Ken
Peck and guard Marty Feldman
would not make the trip due to
injuries.
Also Card starting center Dick
Flatland, and backs Jim Nafziger,
George Quist and Mickie Titus will
not be performing at peak efficiency
due to minor hurts.
Biggest one-two punch in Coach
Pest Welch's Husky offense is com
posed of Quarterback Dick Ottele
and halfback Fred Provo. On Ot
tele's right arm rests much of Wash
ington's passing attack, while stocky
Fred Provo packs most of the run
ning power down the middle.
Center Gordy Berlin, held out of
last week's game with Oregon but
okayed by the doctors for the Stan

ford tilt, tackle Arnie Weinmeister
and end Dick Hagen, are the main
bulwarks in the Husky line.
Weinmeister, a 230 pounder, was
converted from fullback to tackle
this season, and has proved to all
that the new position is very much
to his liking.
It may be that the best Stanford
scoring opportunities may be found
through the air. Both quarterbacks,
A 1 Morris and Ainslee Bell stand
high in conference statistics on pass
completions.
But the Washington coaching stall
has done their job well, for the
Huskies top the list for pass defense
in the PCC.
Ainslee Bell has been appointed
game captain for the Indians tomor
row.

Minnesota, the Huskies completely
outplayed the Gophers in a torren
tial downpour, only to lose 7-6.
Hopes of Stanford backers took

another nose-dive with the an
nouncement that right halfback Ken
Peck and guard Marty Feldman
would not make the trip due to
injuries.
Also Card starting center Dick
Flatland, and backs Jim Nafziger,
George Quist and Mickie Titus will
not be performing at peak efficiency
due to minor hurts.
Biggest one-two punch in Coach
Pest Welch's Husky offense is com
posed of Quarterback Dick Ottele
and halfback Fred Provo. On Ot
tele's right arm rests much of Wash
ington's passing attack, while stocky
Fred Provo packs most of the run
ning power down the middle.
Center Gordy Berlin, held out of
last week's game with Oregon but
okayed by the doctors for the Stan

ford tilt, tackle Arnie Weinmeister
and end Dick Hagen, are the main
bulwarks in the Husky line.
Weinmeister, a 230 pounder, was
converted from fullback to tackle
this season, and has proved to all
that the new position is very much
to his liking.
It may be that the best Stanford
scoring opportunities may be found
through the air. Both quarterbacks,
A 1 Morris and Ainslee Bell stand
high in conference statistics on pass
completions.
But the Washington coaching stall
has done their job well, for the
Huskies top the list for pass defense
in the PCC.
Ainslee Bell has been appointed
game captain for the Indians tomor
row.

Stanford's football varsity, 37
strong, invades the great North
west tomorrow, in a battle with the
University of Washington Huskies
which could conceivably decide the
1947 basement championship of the
Pacific Coast conference.
Neither the Huskies nor Indians
have hit winning ways in conference
play as yet this season, Washington
dropping two games, Oregon and

Stanford's varsity gridders, on
their way north to engage the
Washington Huskies this week
end, escaped injury when their
bus struck a car near San Carlos
yesterday afternoon.
The acident occurred when the
driver of the bus swerved to avoid
a heavy truck, and hit the car
driven by Ruth Radkc of Wil
liams. The team continued on
their way to the train in Oakland
in another bus.

Oregon State, and Stanford losing to
UCLA and Idaho.
The prospect of wet weather Sat
urday has helped shove Seattle bet
ting odds to 5-1 in favor of the
Huskies, with even money at 18
points.
For Washington has played a ma
jority of its games in the rain. In
