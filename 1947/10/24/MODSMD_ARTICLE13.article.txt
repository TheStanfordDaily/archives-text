# Riding Horses Replace Racers at Big Red Barn; Students Learn Horsemanship in Equitation Class
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
They brought 35 riding horses to
the Farm and painted the huge barn
a dark-stained red.
And when September fashioned a
carpet of leaves for atmospheric
purposes, "the big red barn" was
open for business.
Thus was reborn the Stanford
riding stable doctored by Mr. and
Mrs. Allan Ross, who are in their
second year of teaching the funda
mentals of horsemanship to Stan
ford students.
The Rosses are well versed in
stable operations, having had their
own barn in Placer County and la
ter near Lake Tahoe.

A moonlight horseback ride and
wiener roast will he held Wed
nesday for Stanford equitation
students. Riders will leave the
red barn at 7:30 p.m., with horses
saddled and ready to move. Fur
flier information may be obtained
by calling PA 2-5713.

Embracing an approximate 64
j acres, the stable area is complete
with training corrals, jumping bar
riers, and sawdust - filled arenas
such as one is apt to find inside a
circus tent.
More than 100 students are now
enrolled in equitation, the some
what horsey colloquialism that
could well be labeled "horseback
riding."

"When we first started out, we |
only had 43 students," Mr. Ross said, i
"And as soon as people get used to
the idea of being able to ride again, |
we should have an increase in equi- j
tation sign-ups."
Students are put in the saddle |

and are considered dudes until their
horsemanship approaches a quality
that is best indicated by the manner
in which the better students ride
over the 8,800-acre Stanford Farm.
The red barn, located a half-mile
away at the northern extremity of

Santa Teresa Street, is the same
building which housed many of Le
land Stanford's champ racers and
trotters.
The Senator, a sportsman as well
as a public official, purchased the
Palo Alto Stock Farm in 1876 to
shelter his herd of 20 stallions and
200 mares.
And ready to remind people of
the crinoline and parasol era is a
weather-tinged statue of Sherwood,
one of the Senator's prize racers.
The statue stands veritably em
bossed in the center of what was
once a neat and orderly equine
graveyard.
Despite the traces of moss in the
cobwebbed corners, the Rosses have
transformed the barn into a triple j
combination paddock, office, and
equipment storeroom.
Both Western and English style
saddles arc carefully hung on pegs
driven into the barn wall, and
there is an air of exactness in the
names of the horses painted on
cardboard thumbtacked to the still j
doors.
The quarterly equitation fee is i
i $45, and the course is counted as i
credit toward fulfilling the physical '
education requirement.
But for all of this, the most remi- !
niscent of people will recall a day
j when sleek - lined racers like old
I Sherwood roamed uninhibited |
about the two-story "old red barn." i

as a public official, purchased the
Palo Alto Stock Farm in 1876 to
shelter his herd of 20 stallions and
200 mares.
And ready to remind people of
the crinoline and parasol era is a
weather-tinged statue of Sherwood,
one of the Senator's prize racers.
The statue stands veritably em
bossed in the center of what was
once a neat and orderly equine
graveyard.
Despite the traces of moss in the
cobwebbed corners, the Rosses have
transformed the barn into a triple j
combination paddock, office, and
equipment storeroom.
Both Western and English style
saddles arc carefully hung on pegs
driven into the barn wall, and
there is an air of exactness in the
names of the horses painted on
cardboard thumbtacked to the still j
doors.
The quarterly equitation fee is i
i $45, and the course is counted as i
credit toward fulfilling the physical '
education requirement.
But for all of this, the most remi- !
niscent of people will recall a day
j when sleek - lined racers like old
I Sherwood roamed uninhibited |
about the two-story "old red barn." i


The Old Red Barn—Once famous as (he home of Senator Stanford's
renowned thoroughbreds, is gaining prominence as the huh of the Farm's
riding classes.
They brought 35 riding horses to
the Farm and painted the huge barn
a dark-stained red.
And when September fashioned a
carpet of leaves for atmospheric
purposes, "the big red barn" was
open for business.
Thus was reborn the Stanford
riding stable doctored by Mr. and
Mrs. Allan Ross, who are in their
second year of teaching the funda
mentals of horsemanship to Stan
ford students.
The Rosses are well versed in
stable operations, having had their
own barn in Placer County and la
ter near Lake Tahoe.

A moonlight horseback ride and
wiener roast will he held Wed
nesday for Stanford equitation
students. Riders will leave the
red barn at 7:30 p.m., with horses
saddled and ready to move. Fur
flier information may be obtained
by calling PA 2-5713.

Embracing an approximate 64
j acres, the stable area is complete
with training corrals, jumping bar
riers, and sawdust - filled arenas
such as one is apt to find inside a
circus tent.
More than 100 students are now
enrolled in equitation, the some
what horsey colloquialism that
could well be labeled "horseback
riding."

"When we first started out, we |
only had 43 students," Mr. Ross said, i
"And as soon as people get used to
the idea of being able to ride again, |
we should have an increase in equi- j
tation sign-ups."
Students are put in the saddle |

and are considered dudes until their
horsemanship approaches a quality
that is best indicated by the manner
in which the better students ride
over the 8,800-acre Stanford Farm.
The red barn, located a half-mile
away at the northern extremity of

Santa Teresa Street, is the same
building which housed many of Le
land Stanford's champ racers and
trotters.
