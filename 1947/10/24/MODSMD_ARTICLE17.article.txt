(The following statement con
cerning NSA was issued last
night, following Excoin's approval,
by Ginny Titus, Excom member
and NSA national delegate.)
What does Excom's approval of
NSA mean? Approval in itself
means nothing! Passive affiliation
into a national student group as po
tentially strong as NSA is not only
ineffective but. actually dangerous.
Furthermore, $500 a year Ls too
much to pour into any organization
if we don't intend to make it give
us plenty in return.
To me the most vital asset NSA
has to offer is the position it will
be in to represent American stu
dents in Europe. United States
delegates, sent from political
groups such as the American
Youth for Democracy, have so far
done more to discredit the Ameri
can student than if no one had
spoken for us. These people ac
tually have only a fraction of
student support, but since they
are the sole delegates from the
United States at annual youth
festivals and meetings of Euro
pean student unions, it appears
that they speak for all American
students.
In the International Union of Stu
dents, the largest student group in
the entire world, the Communistic
elements have assumed complete
leadership and the democratic del
egations from such countries as
Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada
have either withdrawn or declined
to join. Here is the same story of
the democracies letting the red-hots
run the show until it's too late and
they realize they have to fight for
the very principles they've been too
.negligent to support. Instead of
playing the 1920 game of isolation
ism again, let's get in and fight these
"guys" who find it so easy to con
trol the show.
Here we have a potentially strong
national student group that is in an
ideal position to send really repre
sentative delegates. But what is to
guarantee that these delegates will
represent schools like Stanford!
Herein lies the danger of passively
joining NSA.

cerning NSA was issued last
night, following Excoin's approval,
by Ginny Titus, Excom member
and NSA national delegate.)
What does Excom's approval of
NSA mean? Approval in itself
means nothing! Passive affiliation
into a national student group as po
tentially strong as NSA is not only
ineffective but. actually dangerous.
Furthermore, $500 a year Ls too
much to pour into any organization
if we don't intend to make it give
us plenty in return.
To me the most vital asset NSA
has to offer is the position it will
be in to represent American stu
dents in Europe. United States
delegates, sent from political
groups such as the American
Youth for Democracy, have so far
done more to discredit the Ameri
can student than if no one had
spoken for us. These people ac
tually have only a fraction of
student support, but since they
are the sole delegates from the
United States at annual youth
festivals and meetings of Euro
pean student unions, it appears
that they speak for all American
students.
In the International Union of Stu
dents, the largest student group in
the entire world, the Communistic
elements have assumed complete
leadership and the democratic del
egations from such countries as
Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada
have either withdrawn or declined
to join. Here is the same story of
the democracies letting the red-hots
run the show until it's too late and
they realize they have to fight for
the very principles they've been too
.negligent to support. Instead of
playing the 1920 game of isolation
ism again, let's get in and fight these
"guys" who find it so easy to con
trol the show.
Here we have a potentially strong
national student group that is in an
ideal position to send really repre
sentative delegates. But what is to
guarantee that these delegates will
represent schools like Stanford!
Herein lies the danger of passively
joining NSA.


Left to right—Guyla Runyan (ASSU vice-president and confcrence
delegate), Cary Fisher (conference alternate), Ginny Titus (national
NSA delegate), Marilyn Sidwell, and Rod Rogaway (outgoing chairman
of NSA) look over the proposed regional NSA constitution which will
he up for ratification at the conference this weekend.
