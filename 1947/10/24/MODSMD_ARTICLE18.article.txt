SOCIETY FORMED
In lho next three hours the Ham
mer and Coffin society was formed
for the purpose of publishing the
Chaparral, to be composed of senior
• taft members of the magazine, and
to be carried over from year to year.
Early in the morning—April 16,

■ ociety lurched home. A few hours
I■ ■ 1 • •)' the new-born Old Boy took
the first swing with his hammer.
And the whole Bay Area fell to the
ground.
No Hammer and Coffin man or
woman ever entertains the least
doubt that the great San Francisco
earthquake and fire were nt di
) ectly caused by the Old Boy's first
testing of his strength. Since then,
lie has been careful with the Ham
mer and has never again knocked
the buildings of the whole Bay Area
down around the ears of its residents.
MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM
The society has also had its influ
ence on Stanford itself—an influence
whose most noticeable result is the
.Tcmorial Auditorium. In the early

30's the Old Boy decided that Stan
ford needed an adequate auditorium.
He opened a campaign for such, a
two-year crusade which resulted
in the raising of funds and the build
ing of the Mem Aud.
The Chaparral, itself, began in
1899, when Bristow Adams decided
that Stanford needed a| magazine
devoted entirely to humor, one
which would keep a cynical but tol
erant eye on "the Stanford farm in
particular and the foibles of man
kind in general."
The first editorial began with the
famous words "Now that," and every
Chappie editorial since then has be
gun with the same words.
OLD BOYS LAUGHS
As the years passed, the concept
of the Old Boy grew and crystalized.
From the first he was there in his
jester's suit and with his hammer.
As the years passed he changed his
beer mug for a mirror, symbol of
the fact that although the Old Boy
laughs continuously at the world,
the first person he laughs at is him
self. His hammer has always been
ready to knock the stuffed shirts,
the pompous, the smug, the hypo
critical—a pastime he has indulged
in from the beginning and which is
his real purpose in life.
The Old Boy is now entering his
48th year. Editors come and go with
the passing years, but the Old Boy
lives on in the Chappie offices and
the Chaparral still laughs at life.
" 'Tis better to have lived and
laughed than never to have lived
at all."

MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM
The society has also had its influ

whose most noticeable result is the
.Tcmorial Auditorium. In the early

30's the Old Boy decided that Stan

He opened a campaign for such, a
two-year crusade which resulted
in the raising of funds and the build

The Chaparral, itself, began in
1899, when Bristow Adams decided
that Stanford needed a| magazine
devoted entirely to humor, one
which would keep a cynical but tol
erant eye on "the Stanford farm in
particular and the foibles of man
kind in general."
The first editorial began with the
famous words "Now that," and every
Chappie editorial since then has be

OLD BOYS LAUGHS
As the years passed, the concept
of the Old Boy grew and crystalized.
From the first he was there in his
jester's suit and with his hammer.
As the years passed he changed his
beer mug for a mirror, symbol of
the fact that although the Old Boy
laughs continuously at the world,
the first person he laughs at is him
self. His hammer has always been
ready to knock the stuffed shirts,
the pompous, the smug, the hypo
critical—a pastime he has indulged
in from the beginning and which is
his real purpose in life.
The Old Boy is now entering his
48th year. Editors come and go with
the passing years, but the Old Boy
lives on in the Chappie offices and
the Chaparral still laughs at life.
