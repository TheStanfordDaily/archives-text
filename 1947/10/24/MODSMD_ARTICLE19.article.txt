# War Libe Dislays Anti-Nazi Papers
## 
### 
A rare collection of underground
anti-Nazi propaganda is on display
in tlie entrance hall of the Hoover
vVar Library tliis week. Secret
sabotage reoorts. deri
ive cartoons, and false ca
pers printed in France, Belgium,
Denmark, Holland, and Norway are
supplemented with photographs of
the opposition presses and Iheir
hu/ito-d editors and workers.
A sabotage report of the FFI lists
il' railed trains, grenade attacks on
1 jf-rman officers, the release of pris
oners, and the destruction of power
• Nations and high-tension wires. The
i cport also numbers the Nazis killed
< r wounded in each underground
action and totals the hours of costly
delay to the German war economy.
Other publications plead for the
French patriot to resist labor depor
tation to Germany and instruct him
<>n methods of aiding Allied flyers.
A Belgian resistance paper of the
first World War reappeared in 1940
with the elusive "responsible editor
—Peter Pan." To supply the appal
ling lack of reliable information in
' onquered Europe, one Danish press
reprinted page after page of head
lines cut from foreign newspapers.
The six-case display also includes
Allied occupation pamphlets, Four
Power regulations—printed in four
languages—and one of the original
copies of the United Nations Char
ter.
