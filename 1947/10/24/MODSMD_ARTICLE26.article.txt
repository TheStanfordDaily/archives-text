# Study of New Pacific Island Territories Centered at Stanford's Naval School
## 
### 
More than a year has passed since
the christening of the post - war
School of Naval Administration on
the Stanford campus. Yet few have
recognized the actual significance of
the blue - coated officers who ap
peared briefly as temporary stu
dents to make Stanford the out
standing center for the study of
American island territories in the
Pacific.
"From this unique six - months
program, 165 officers have now been
graduated. They were prepared to
dear the war debris from the is
land administration and to aid in
stimulating self - government and
co-operative enterprises in those
territories," said Dr. Felix Keesing,
in charge of the teaching program
of the SONA.
DIRECTOR
With Dr. H. H. Fisher as director
and Commander Ralph Ramey as
executive officer for the Navy, the
training was undertaken at Stanford
in April, 1946.
"The Stanford program," said Dr.
Keesing, "is an American equiva
lent of the training given by the
British, Dutch, and French to their
colonial personnel and brings to
gether many phases of scientific
knowledge and administrative expe
rience." The original naval officer
staff was composed of men who had
had actual administrative experi
ence in the islands.
IJN CONSULTANT
Dr. Keesing spent two months
this summer in western Samoa as a
consultant to the United Nations.
There he studied problems of self
government facing that island which
was formerly under mandate to
New Zealand.
"In their recent transfer from
military government to civilian gov
ernment the island territories find
themselves faced with innumerable
administrative and economic prob
lems," he said.
CONTROL OF ISLANDS
Naval authorities are now respon
sible for administrative control of
Guam, Samoa, and the ex-Japa
nese-mandated islands of the Caro
line and Marianas groups, Truk,

Saipan, Tinian, and Yap (held by
the United States by trusteeship
under the UN).
"These latter present the most
complex administrative problems,
with some 80 inhabited islands, most
of them varying greatly in language
and culture.' Japanese is the only
approach to a common language for
the 80,000 islanders," Dr. Keesing
explained.
Administrators graduated from
the Stanford school have found that
their training was only a beginning.
At present they are actively en
gaged in an educational program,
stressing the teaching of English. A
vigorous health program is also un
der way with an already increasing
population on some of the islands,
particularly Saipan.
SELF-GOVERNMENT
The administrative plan, said Dr.
Keesing, also includes training the
islanders themselves in government,
and in developing councils and sys
tems of regional self - government.

In fact, self - government bills are
now in Congress for both Guam and
American Samoa.
"Despite their relative economic
dependency upon the U.S., the is
landers do not look to us for doles
and handouts, but for help in de
veloping a stable life in the world,"
he declared.
The Navy now appropriates mon
ey for administration, and trade is
run by the U.S. Commercial Com
pany under the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation with co-opei'a
tive stores. However, the islands'
main resources for export (handi
crafts, copra, and some phosphate)
have not yet found much of a U.S.
or world market.
"Food is no problem, as most of
the islanders are self-sufficient with
fishing and gardens. But as in other
countries, consumer goods are bad
ly needed." he said.
While the present quota of ad
ministrative officers has been filled
from the Stanford SONA with the
last class in August, the resident
naval staff continues to engage in
research and to write handbooks
about the islands for the Navy and
government.
In addition to the Administration
school, Stanford also serves as the
Pacific Coast springboard for an un
ending stream of scientists and
scholars headed for the Pacific. This
group has included 45 anthropolo
gists in a Pacific Science Board un
der the National Research Council
who stopped over for a three-week
orientation program before leaving
for the islands.
TRAINING PROGRAM
Here they may study documents
of island government, all stored in
the Hoover Library, and may use
the facilities and information of
fered by the naval staff.
Dr. Keesing further probes the
American island territories' prob
lems in his contribution to the just
published "Problems of American
Policy in the Pacific," written in
collaboration with 11 other eminent
specialists in Pacific affairs. Here he
mentions the Stanford school as vi
tally important to the rehabilitation
of those strategic island possessions.

ey for administration, and trade is
run by the U.S. Commercial Com
pany under the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation with co-opei'a
tive stores. However, the islands'
main resources for export (handi
crafts, copra, and some phosphate)
have not yet found much of a U.S.
or world market.
"Food is no problem, as most of
the islanders are self-sufficient with
fishing and gardens. But as in other
countries, consumer goods are bad
ly needed." he said.
While the present quota of ad
ministrative officers has been filled
from the Stanford SONA with the
last class in August, the resident
naval staff continues to engage in
research and to write handbooks
about the islands for the Navy and
government.
In addition to the Administration
school, Stanford also serves as the
Pacific Coast springboard for an un
ending stream of scientists and
scholars headed for the Pacific. This
group has included 45 anthropolo
gists in a Pacific Science Board un
der the National Research Council
who stopped over for a three-week
orientation program before leaving
for the islands.
TRAINING PROGRAM
Here they may study documents
of island government, all stored in
the Hoover Library, and may use
the facilities and information of
fered by the naval staff.
Dr. Keesing further probes the
American island territories' prob
lems in his contribution to the just
published "Problems of American
Policy in the Pacific," written in
collaboration with 11 other eminent
specialists in Pacific affairs. Here he
mentions the Stanford school as vi
tally important to the rehabilitation
of those strategic island possessions.


Dr. 11. 11. Fisher, director of the
post-war School of Naval Admin
istration.
More than a year has passed since
the christening of the post - war
School of Naval Administration on
the Stanford campus. Yet few have
recognized the actual significance of
the blue - coated officers who ap
peared briefly as temporary stu
dents to make Stanford the out
standing center for the study of
American island territories in the
Pacific.
"From this unique six - months
program, 165 officers have now been
graduated. They were prepared to
dear the war debris from the is
land administration and to aid in
stimulating self - government and
co-operative enterprises in those
territories," said Dr. Felix Keesing,
in charge of the teaching program
of the SONA.
DIRECTOR
With Dr. H. H. Fisher as director
and Commander Ralph Ramey as
executive officer for the Navy, the
training was undertaken at Stanford
in April, 1946.
"The Stanford program," said Dr.
Keesing, "is an American equiva
lent of the training given by the
British, Dutch, and French to their
colonial personnel and brings to
gether many phases of scientific
knowledge and administrative expe
rience." The original naval officer
staff was composed of men who had
had actual administrative experi
ence in the islands.
IJN CONSULTANT
Dr. Keesing spent two months
this summer in western Samoa as a
consultant to the United Nations.
There he studied problems of self
government facing that island which
was formerly under mandate to
New Zealand.
"In their recent transfer from
military government to civilian gov
ernment the island territories find
themselves faced with innumerable
administrative and economic prob
lems," he said.
CONTROL OF ISLANDS
Naval authorities are now respon
sible for administrative control of
Guam, Samoa, and the ex-Japa
nese-mandated islands of the Caro
line and Marianas groups, Truk,

Saipan, Tinian, and Yap (held by
the United States by trusteeship
under the UN).
"These latter present the most
complex administrative problems,
with some 80 inhabited islands, most
of them varying greatly in language
and culture.' Japanese is the only
approach to a common language for
the 80,000 islanders," Dr. Keesing
explained.
Administrators graduated from
the Stanford school have found that
their training was only a beginning.
At present they are actively en
gaged in an educational program,
stressing the teaching of English. A
vigorous health program is also un
der way with an already increasing
population on some of the islands,
particularly Saipan.
SELF-GOVERNMENT
The administrative plan, said Dr.
Keesing, also includes training the
islanders themselves in government,
and in developing councils and sys
tems of regional self - government.

In fact, self - government bills are
now in Congress for both Guam and
American Samoa.
"Despite their relative economic
dependency upon the U.S., the is
landers do not look to us for doles
and handouts, but for help in de
veloping a stable life in the world,"
he declared.

government facing that island which
was formerly under mandate to
New Zealand.
"In their recent transfer from
military government to civilian gov
ernment the island territories find
themselves faced with innumerable
administrative and economic prob
lems," he said.
CONTROL OF ISLANDS
Naval authorities are now respon
sible for administrative control of
Guam, Samoa, and the ex-Japa
nese-mandated islands of the Caro
line and Marianas groups, Truk,

Saipan, Tinian, and Yap (held by
the United States by trusteeship
under the UN).
"These latter present the most
complex administrative problems,
with some 80 inhabited islands, most
of them varying greatly in language
and culture.' Japanese is the only
approach to a common language for
the 80,000 islanders," Dr. Keesing
explained.
Administrators graduated from
the Stanford school have found that
their training was only a beginning.
At present they are actively en
gaged in an educational program,
stressing the teaching of English. A
vigorous health program is also un
der way with an already increasing
population on some of the islands,
particularly Saipan.
SELF-GOVERNMENT
The administrative plan, said Dr.
Keesing, also includes training the
islanders themselves in government,
and in developing councils and sys
tems of regional self - government.

In fact, self - government bills are
now in Congress for both Guam and
American Samoa.
"Despite their relative economic
dependency upon the U.S., the is
landers do not look to us for doles
and handouts, but for help in de
veloping a stable life in the world,"
he declared.
The Navy now appropriates mon
ey for administration, and trade is
run by the U.S. Commercial Com
pany under the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation with co-opei'a
tive stores. However, the islands'
main resources for export (handi
crafts, copra, and some phosphate)
have not yet found much of a U.S.
or world market.
"Food is no problem, as most of
the islanders are self-sufficient with
fishing and gardens. But as in other
countries, consumer goods are bad
ly needed." he said.
While the present quota of ad
ministrative officers has been filled
from the Stanford SONA with the
last class in August, the resident
naval staff continues to engage in
research and to write handbooks
about the islands for the Navy and
government.
In addition to the Administration
school, Stanford also serves as the
Pacific Coast springboard for an un
ending stream of scientists and
scholars headed for the Pacific. This
group has included 45 anthropolo
gists in a Pacific Science Board un
der the National Research Council
who stopped over for a three-week
orientation program before leaving
for the islands.
TRAINING PROGRAM
Here they may study documents
of island government, all stored in
the Hoover Library, and may use
the facilities and information of
fered by the naval staff.
Dr. Keesing further probes the
American island territories' prob
lems in his contribution to the just
published "Problems of American
Policy in the Pacific," written in
collaboration with 11 other eminent
specialists in Pacific affairs. Here he
mentions the Stanford school as vi
tally important to the rehabilitation
of those strategic island possessions.

post-war School of Naval Admin
istration.
More than a year has passed since
the christening of the post - war
School of Naval Administration on
the Stanford campus. Yet few have
recognized the actual significance of
the blue - coated officers who ap
peared briefly as temporary stu
dents to make Stanford the out
standing center for the study of
American island territories in the
Pacific.
"From this unique six - months
program, 165 officers have now been
graduated. They were prepared to
dear the war debris from the is
land administration and to aid in
stimulating self - government and
co-operative enterprises in those
territories," said Dr. Felix Keesing,
in charge of the teaching program
of the SONA.
DIRECTOR
With Dr. H. H. Fisher as director
and Commander Ralph Ramey as
executive officer for the Navy, the
training was undertaken at Stanford
in April, 1946.
"The Stanford program," said Dr.
Keesing, "is an American equiva
lent of the training given by the
British, Dutch, and French to their
colonial personnel and brings to
gether many phases of scientific
knowledge and administrative expe
rience." The original naval officer
staff was composed of men who had
had actual administrative experi
ence in the islands.
IJN CONSULTANT
Dr. Keesing spent two months
this summer in western Samoa as a
consultant to the United Nations.
There he studied problems of self
government facing that island which
was formerly under mandate to
New Zealand.
