# Pros and Cons of the Present Farm Government Debated
## 
### 
A more representative student
government was the keynote of the
debate Wednesday night in room 35
of the Education Building.
The house favored a proposal by
Fordcn Athearn that a student
legislature replace Excom; a body
which would more adequately rep
resent student opinion.
Athearn cited the inequality of
representation on Excom, varying
from about 300 constituents in some
cases to as many as 1,500 in others.
He said that it is a physical impos
sibility for one person to properly
represent so large a constituency.
STUDENT FEELS UNIMPORTANT
"The student begins to feel that
he is some unimportant cog in the
constituency of a BMOC," Athearn
concluded.
Under the tightly knit Excom, lit
tle opposition is allowed to be
heard, he said.
Athearn proposes a representative
for each 200 students. This would
give a greater cross section of stu
dent opinion, more open debate, and
an opportunity for organized oppo
sition, he said.
SUGGESTS CHANGES
Marshall A. Small, presenting the
negative side, warned against turn
ing student government into, a de
bating society. He said that in view
of Excom's large agenda each week,
it is doubtful if a larger body could
work with the same efficiency.
He stated that under the present

ASSU constitution we have all the
tools we need for moulding a satis
factory student government. He rec
ommended that we retain our pres
ent student government with the
following suggestions.
They are: (1) amendments to the
constitution providing for the initia
tive and referendum; (2) strength
ening of present means of contact
between the students and their rep
resentatives; and (3) increased pub
licity of Excom and investigation of
the possibility that interested stu
dents might view Excom in action.
In a roll call of the house, Ath
j earn's resolution was passed by 18
I to 15.
With the passage of the resolu
tion, ASSU President Tom Martz
| loff will be invited to state his views
I on the resolution, according to John
I Hines, assistant manager.
George Velliotes presided as
I chairman.

bating society. He said that in view
of Excom's large agenda each week,
it is doubtful if a larger body could
work with the same efficiency.
He stated that under the present

ASSU constitution we have all the
tools we need for moulding a satis
factory student government. He rec
ommended that we retain our pres
ent student government with the
following suggestions.
They are: (1) amendments to the
constitution providing for the initia
tive and referendum; (2) strength
ening of present means of contact
between the students and their rep
resentatives; and (3) increased pub
licity of Excom and investigation of
the possibility that interested stu
dents might view Excom in action.
In a roll call of the house, Ath
j earn's resolution was passed by 18
I to 15.
With the passage of the resolu
tion, ASSU President Tom Martz
| loff will be invited to state his views
I on the resolution, according to John
I Hines, assistant manager.
George Velliotes presided as
I chairman.
A more representative student
government was the keynote of the
debate Wednesday night in room 35
of the Education Building.
The house favored a proposal by
Fordcn Athearn that a student
legislature replace Excom; a body
which would more adequately rep
resent student opinion.
Athearn cited the inequality of
representation on Excom, varying
from about 300 constituents in some
cases to as many as 1,500 in others.
He said that it is a physical impos
sibility for one person to properly
represent so large a constituency.
STUDENT FEELS UNIMPORTANT
"The student begins to feel that
he is some unimportant cog in the
constituency of a BMOC," Athearn
concluded.
Under the tightly knit Excom, lit
tle opposition is allowed to be
heard, he said.
Athearn proposes a representative
for each 200 students. This would
give a greater cross section of stu
dent opinion, more open debate, and
an opportunity for organized oppo
sition, he said.
SUGGESTS CHANGES
Marshall A. Small, presenting the
negative side, warned against turn
ing student government into, a de
bating society. He said that in view
of Excom's large agenda each week,
it is doubtful if a larger body could
work with the same efficiency.
