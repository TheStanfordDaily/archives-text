# Stanford-Washington Rivalry Dates Back to 1893
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Once upon a time there was a
football coach who led a troupe of
Stanford Indians to Seattle on "a
sightseeing venture." But as long as
the men knew how to play football,
why not do two things at once!
The coach, old Pop Bliss, did just
that.
So historians are now writing of
Stanford's 40 to 0 thumping of the
Washington Huskies in 1893.
"Old Pop had a good year," they
said, "but it's a. shame he has to
leave next year. Hear tell a fellow
by the name of Walter Camp is
going to coach Stanford in '94."
Stanford-Washington gridiron re
lations were held in check for 27
years- the No. 2 game in the series

I being played in 1920.
The Cardinals nipped Stub Alli-
I son's eleven, 3 to 0, on the strength
of Dink Templeton's field goal. Both
| clubs were east in a brawl which
loomed more like a stalemate than
: anything else.
Then the incomparable Dink, with
unusual poise, booted a 25 - yard
."three-pointer" in the second panel.
HUSKIES EMBARRASSED
It was downright embarrassing
for the Huskies to keep losing to
the Stanfords, and no one was more
aware of this fact than Husky tutor
Enoch Bagshavv.
Sparked by aerial-minded Leon
ard Ziel, the northerners ripped the
Cards, 12 to 8, in 1922, with Bob
Ingram and Bill Grimm being
awarded four-star plaudits for the
Seattle group.
After being humbled by a 13 to 0
margin in 1f.25, the Stanfords, tu
torial by Pop Warner, routed the

Huskies, 29 to 10, in one of the most
J hair-raising games in Card - Husky
I histpry.
Tied at 10-all early in the final
quarter, the Indians rose from the J
Stadium turf to roar into the end
zone three times. "Irish Mike" Mur
phy tallied twice following a pair of i
Husky offensive thrusts that failed
to materialize.
BOGUE AND HOFFMAN STAR
Fullback George Bogue and Biff
I Hoffman, via their performances
I that day, could well have been
i elected chancellors of Encina for
| the rest of the quarter.
In the next three years, the Cards
knitted a three-year winning streak,
| authoring 13 to 7, 12 to 0, and (i to 0 I
j wins, respectively, with 1930 yet
to come.
Remember redoubtable Phil Mof- 1
I'att? Flashy Moffatt, who had a j
craving for juicy, three-inch-thick I
steaks smothered in French fries,

was the first Card halfback to be
"selected an Ail-American."
Aided by burly Bill Simkin, Mof
fatt led the Redshirts to a 25 to 7
win. a tidy present for Washington
Coach Jim Phelan.
On a rainy field at Seattle in '33,
the Huskies staged one of the few
defeats inflicted upon the then
beardless Vow Boys. An ordinary
guy named Smith—Bill Smith, to be
exact —booted two field goals to lead
a G to 0 upset win oyer the Indians.
The following year, faced with
the leering grin of a Washington
powerhouse, the Vow Boys ham
mered the Huskies, 24 to 0. Bobby
Grayson and Monk Moscrip played
inspired ball, but it was the choppy
stepping Grayson who piloted the
Indians into the end zone.
BOBBY SCORES TWICE
Grayson ran to two TD's on inter
cepted passes, and placed the Cards
in scoring position with another in
terception with an assist by half
back Buck Van Dellan.
When the Vow Boys were gone,
and after a 14 to 14 deadlock the
following season, the Cards took ad
vantage of several breaks to beat
Washington, 13 to 7, in 1937.
Credit ends Grant Stone and Bill
Willard with the successful task of
smothering Husky Fritz Waskowitz'
aerial game into the sod. A blond

kid by the name of Bill Paulman
returned to action that day and
booted the Stanfords out of numer
ous holes.
A baseball score 8 to 5 win was
posted by the northerners in 1939,
Tiny Thornhill's last year on the
Farm. Dean McAdams and Rudy
} Mucha combined to arrest the am
bitious locals, despite the promise
! shown by Stanford's Norman
i Standlee.
The season Clark Dan'l Shaugh
nessy crossed the San Francisquito
from out Chicago way, the scene
was enlivened by the Cinderella
saga of "a bid for the bowl."
The Wow Boys trimmed the Hus
kies, 20 to 10, after staging one of
those second - half rallies coaches
dream of every night. QB Frank
Albeit and Pistol Pete Kmetovic,
and the likes of Bruno Banducci and
Dick Palmer were enough to tilt
the scale in favor of the locals.
INDIANS WIN A(iAIN
In 1941, the Indians again turned
back the Huskies, 13 to 7, with
guard Loren LaPrade, a castaway
from Los Angeles, and fullback Will
Sheller dominating the Sunday
morning clippings.
The year's most surprising squad,
j the Indians of '42, toppled the
charges of Pest Welch, 20 to 7, as
Chuck Taylor won a line battle over
center Walt Harrison. Ray Ham
<nett, seated on the bench at the
| game's beginning, roared into action
j for one of his best performances of
the campaign.
As a matter of public record,
i Washington humbled the Stanfords,
21 to 15, last year, overcoming an
| early second-half lead built up by
I the Cards.
PIIOVO RUNS WILD
Fred Provo ran like a wild man,
the scribes reported, and Dick Ha
gen, an end of ferocious repute,
combined with him to spark the
northern offensive in successive
spurts.
Lopin' Lloyd Merriman of Clovis
and halfback Bob Anderson scored
for Stanford. A possible Stanford
win was swept aside when Merri
man's TD gallop of some 44 yards
was rejected by the officials in the
fourth canto.
No. 24 in the series will be enact
ed on the Seattle arena tomorrow,
with the Indians searching for their
14th win, three games having ended
| in ties.
The Farm hands have scored 28G
; points to Washington's 157 points.
And as long as the series continues,
it must be remembered that it all
started "once upon a time."

Lopin' Lloyd Merriman of Clovis
and halfback Bob Anderson scored

No. 24 in the series will be enact

The Farm hands have scored 28G

And as long as the series continues,
it must be remembered that it all
started "once upon a time."
Once upon a time there was a
football coach who led a troupe of
Stanford Indians to Seattle on "a
sightseeing venture." But as long as
the men knew how to play football,
why not do two things at once!
The coach, old Pop Bliss, did just
that.
So historians are now writing of
Stanford's 40 to 0 thumping of the
Washington Huskies in 1893.
"Old Pop had a good year," they
said, "but it's a. shame he has to
leave next year. Hear tell a fellow
by the name of Walter Camp is
going to coach Stanford in '94."
Stanford-Washington gridiron re
lations were held in check for 27
years- the No. 2 game in the series

I being played in 1920.
The Cardinals nipped Stub Alli-
I son's eleven, 3 to 0, on the strength
of Dink Templeton's field goal. Both
| clubs were east in a brawl which
loomed more like a stalemate than
: anything else.
Then the incomparable Dink, with
unusual poise, booted a 25 - yard
."three-pointer" in the second panel.
HUSKIES EMBARRASSED
It was downright embarrassing
for the Huskies to keep losing to
the Stanfords, and no one was more
aware of this fact than Husky tutor
Enoch Bagshavv.
Sparked by aerial-minded Leon
ard Ziel, the northerners ripped the
Cards, 12 to 8, in 1922, with Bob

After being humbled by a 13 to 0
margin in 1f.25, the Stanfords, tu

I histpry.
Tied at 10-all early in the final
quarter, the Indians rose from the J

Aided by burly Bill Simkin, Mof
fatt led the Redshirts to a 25 to 7
win. a tidy present for Washington
Coach Jim Phelan.
On a rainy field at Seattle in '33,
the Huskies staged one of the few
defeats inflicted upon the then
beardless Vow Boys. An ordinary
guy named Smith—Bill Smith, to be
exact —booted two field goals to lead
a G to 0 upset win oyer the Indians.
The following year, faced with
the leering grin of a Washington
powerhouse, the Vow Boys ham
mered the Huskies, 24 to 0. Bobby
Grayson and Monk Moscrip played
inspired ball, but it was the choppy
stepping Grayson who piloted the
Indians into the end zone.
BOBBY SCORES TWICE
Grayson ran to two TD's on inter
cepted passes, and placed the Cards
in scoring position with another in
terception with an assist by half
back Buck Van Dellan.
When the Vow Boys were gone,

why not do two things at once!
The coach, old Pop Bliss, did just
that.
So historians are now writing of

Washington Huskies in 1893.

; points to Washington's 157 points.
And as long as the series continues,
it must be remembered that it all
started "once upon a time."
Once upon a time there was a
football coach who led a troupe of
Stanford Indians to Seattle on "a
sightseeing venture." But as long as
the men knew how to play football,
why not do two things at once!
The coach, old Pop Bliss, did just
that.
So historians are now writing of
Stanford's 40 to 0 thumping of the
Washington Huskies in 1893.
"Old Pop had a good year," they
said, "but it's a. shame he has to
leave next year. Hear tell a fellow
by the name of Walter Camp is
going to coach Stanford in '94."
Stanford-Washington gridiron re
lations were held in check for 27
years- the No. 2 game in the series

I being played in 1920.
The Cardinals nipped Stub Alli-
I son's eleven, 3 to 0, on the strength
of Dink Templeton's field goal. Both
| clubs were east in a brawl which
loomed more like a stalemate than
: anything else.
Then the incomparable Dink, with
unusual poise, booted a 25 - yard
."three-pointer" in the second panel.
HUSKIES EMBARRASSED
It was downright embarrassing
for the Huskies to keep losing to
the Stanfords, and no one was more
aware of this fact than Husky tutor
Enoch Bagshavv.
Sparked by aerial-minded Leon
ard Ziel, the northerners ripped the
Cards, 12 to 8, in 1922, with Bob
Ingram and Bill Grimm being
awarded four-star plaudits for the
Seattle group.
After being humbled by a 13 to 0
margin in 1f.25, the Stanfords, tu
torial by Pop Warner, routed the

Huskies, 29 to 10, in one of the most
J hair-raising games in Card - Husky
I histpry.
Tied at 10-all early in the final
quarter, the Indians rose from the J
Stadium turf to roar into the end
zone three times. "Irish Mike" Mur
phy tallied twice following a pair of i
Husky offensive thrusts that failed
to materialize.
BOGUE AND HOFFMAN STAR
Fullback George Bogue and Biff
I Hoffman, via their performances
I that day, could well have been
i elected chancellors of Encina for
| the rest of the quarter.
In the next three years, the Cards
knitted a three-year winning streak,
| authoring 13 to 7, 12 to 0, and (i to 0 I
j wins, respectively, with 1930 yet
to come.
Remember redoubtable Phil Mof- 1
I'att? Flashy Moffatt, who had a j
craving for juicy, three-inch-thick I
steaks smothered in French fries,

was the first Card halfback to be
"selected an Ail-American."
Aided by burly Bill Simkin, Mof
fatt led the Redshirts to a 25 to 7
win. a tidy present for Washington
Coach Jim Phelan.
On a rainy field at Seattle in '33,
the Huskies staged one of the few
defeats inflicted upon the then
beardless Vow Boys. An ordinary
guy named Smith—Bill Smith, to be
exact —booted two field goals to lead
a G to 0 upset win oyer the Indians.
The following year, faced with
the leering grin of a Washington
powerhouse, the Vow Boys ham
mered the Huskies, 24 to 0. Bobby
Grayson and Monk Moscrip played
inspired ball, but it was the choppy
stepping Grayson who piloted the
Indians into the end zone.
BOBBY SCORES TWICE
Grayson ran to two TD's on inter
cepted passes, and placed the Cards
in scoring position with another in
terception with an assist by half
back Buck Van Dellan.
When the Vow Boys were gone,
and after a 14 to 14 deadlock the
following season, the Cards took ad
vantage of several breaks to beat
Washington, 13 to 7, in 1937.
Credit ends Grant Stone and Bill
Willard with the successful task of
smothering Husky Fritz Waskowitz'
aerial game into the sod. A blond

kid by the name of Bill Paulman
returned to action that day and
booted the Stanfords out of numer
ous holes.
A baseball score 8 to 5 win was
posted by the northerners in 1939,
Tiny Thornhill's last year on the
Farm. Dean McAdams and Rudy
} Mucha combined to arrest the am
bitious locals, despite the promise
! shown by Stanford's Norman
i Standlee.
The season Clark Dan'l Shaugh
nessy crossed the San Francisquito
from out Chicago way, the scene
was enlivened by the Cinderella
saga of "a bid for the bowl."
The Wow Boys trimmed the Hus
kies, 20 to 10, after staging one of
those second - half rallies coaches
dream of every night. QB Frank
Albeit and Pistol Pete Kmetovic,
and the likes of Bruno Banducci and
Dick Palmer were enough to tilt
the scale in favor of the locals.
INDIANS WIN A(iAIN
In 1941, the Indians again turned
back the Huskies, 13 to 7, with
guard Loren LaPrade, a castaway
from Los Angeles, and fullback Will
Sheller dominating the Sunday
morning clippings.
The year's most surprising squad,
j the Indians of '42, toppled the
charges of Pest Welch, 20 to 7, as
Chuck Taylor won a line battle over
center Walt Harrison. Ray Ham
<nett, seated on the bench at the
| game's beginning, roared into action
j for one of his best performances of
the campaign.
As a matter of public record,
i Washington humbled the Stanfords,
21 to 15, last year, overcoming an
| early second-half lead built up by
I the Cards.
PIIOVO RUNS WILD
Fred Provo ran like a wild man,
the scribes reported, and Dick Ha
gen, an end of ferocious repute,
combined with him to spark the
northern offensive in successive
spurts.
Lopin' Lloyd Merriman of Clovis
and halfback Bob Anderson scored
for Stanford. A possible Stanford
win was swept aside when Merri
man's TD gallop of some 44 yards
was rejected by the officials in the
fourth canto.
No. 24 in the series will be enact
ed on the Seattle arena tomorrow,
with the Indians searching for their
14th win, three games having ended
| in ties.
