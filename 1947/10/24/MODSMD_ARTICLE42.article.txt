# Mermen Face Busy Schedule
## 
### 
Turned back by San Jose State
and the Olympic Club in their first
two attempts, Stanford's varsity wa
ter poloists will get two more
chances to notch their initial win
this weekend when both the UCLA
Bruins and Fullerton J.C. invade the
Encina Pools for a busy two days of
water polo activity.
The Indians will square off with
their first conference opponent,
UCLA, this afternoon at 3:30, and
tomorrow morning's non-conference
battle between the Indians and the
ever-dangerous squad from Fuller
ton J.C. is slated for a 10 o'clock
getaway.
UCLA was downed 13-9 last Fri
day by the University of California
in a free scoring battle in the West
wood Pool. On paper, however, the
Indians look slightly the stronger
team despite the fact that they have
been twice beaten in non-conference
play.
CARDS IMPRESSIVE
The Cards looked impressive in
the San Jose game despite the fact
that they were edged by the Spar
tans 7-5; and the small, saltwater
filled Olympic Club pool has always
been a tough nut for opposing teams
to crack.
Coach Don Park's Uclan squad is
built around letterman forward Jim
Couzens, who tallied five of the
Bruins' nine goals against Cal, and
the fine goal keeping of Ray Nixon.
Ron Davis and John Reynolds will
start at the other two forward spots,
while Roberts, Ellis and Romer are
expected to fill out the starting Bruin
line-up.
SAME LINEUP FOR INDIANS
Farm Coach Tom Haynie plans to
stand pat with his starting lineup of
Jim Armstrong, Harry Borchers,
and Fritz Maurer, forwards; Ralph
Sala and Dick Narver, guards; Wal
ter Lull, centerback; and Don Hes
ter, goalie.
The Fullerton J.C. squad, although
an unknown quantity this season, is
always a strong threat under the
tutelage of Coach Jimmy Smith.
There will be no admission charge
for either game.
