# Unbeaten Frosh Gridders Fake on UCLA Tomorrow
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Tomorrow afternoon Stanford's unbeaten freshmen meet the
powerful UCLA frosh eleven at Stanford Stadium. Chuck Tay
lor's Papooses bump into their toughest foe of the season when
they tackle George Dickerson's power-laden Brubabe ensemble.
In the absence of the varsity gridmen, this attraction will

feature the Farm's weekend of
sports. Also, since admission is free,
a large turnout is anticipated for
this battle of two top yearling
squads.
The visitors boast a first-string
line which averages more than 210
pounds per man, and is reputed to
be as fast as it is big. At ends will
be 200-pound Brock Stroscheim, all -
CIF from Alhambra, and Darrt-I
Riggs.
RUGGED TACKLES
A pair of 220-pound musclemen,
Roy Jenson and Guy Way, stand out
as the tackles. Burly Ray Lewand
and Fred Barr are found at the
guards; and big Gayle Pace appears
as potentially one of the Coast's
finest centers.
The Brubabe Lackfield is loaded
with dangerous talent. Flashy Larry
Lampkin runs the T from his quar
terback post, passing the ball oft to
a host of swift-running halfbacks,
including. Billy Duffy, Bob Bland,
Bob Boyd, and Herbie Wiseneck.
Hal Braly, 200-pound power runner,
works from the fullback spot.
Duffy, fast and slippery at IGO
pounds, has been the ace openfield
sprinter in games to date, while Bob
Boyd, All-City from North Holly
wood, also displays talent packing
the pigskin.
SAME COMBINATION
Taylor, popular tutor of the Stan
ford frosh, will probably start the
same combination which edged out
Santa Clara, 0 to 0, and upset an
over-rated USC eleven, 19 to 7,
last week. Stressing blocking this
past week, Taylor will field a strong
first eleven, but it is doubtful whe
ther they'll be able to cope with the
onslaught of the Uclans, who have
such a wealth of reserve strength.
Among those who should see
plenty of action for Stanford are
ends Dick Schulze, Tom August, Bob
Scott, and Tom Vasilatas. Gordon
"Tex" White and Walt Watters will
answer the call at tackles. Don Lu
cas and Harry Hunt share the guard
burdens; and Fred Chez or Dick
Abraham, providing the latter has
recovered from a shoulder separa
tion sustained last week, will he
working at center.
Tom Shaw, brilliant passing quar
terback, Boyd Benson, John Banks,
and Gordon MacLachlan round put
the starting backfield for the Pa
pooses. However, southpaw pitcher
Wayne Buck, Wally Odneal, who
performed brilliantly last week
against USC, Ken La Grose, and
punting wizard Ray Dodson are ex
pected to see plenty of action against
the Brubabes.

Riggs.
RUGGED TACKLES
A pair of 220-pound musclemen,
Roy Jenson and Guy Way, stand out
as the tackles. Burly Ray Lewand
and Fred Barr are found at the
guards; and big Gayle Pace appears
as potentially one of the Coast's
finest centers.
The Brubabe Lackfield is loaded
with dangerous talent. Flashy Larry
Lampkin runs the T from his quar
terback post, passing the ball oft to
a host of swift-running halfbacks,
including. Billy Duffy, Bob Bland,
Bob Boyd, and Herbie Wiseneck.
Hal Braly, 200-pound power runner,
works from the fullback spot.
Duffy, fast and slippery at IGO
pounds, has been the ace openfield
sprinter in games to date, while Bob
Boyd, All-City from North Holly
wood, also displays talent packing
the pigskin.
SAME COMBINATION
Taylor, popular tutor of the Stan
ford frosh, will probably start the
same combination which edged out
Santa Clara, 0 to 0, and upset an
over-rated USC eleven, 19 to 7,
last week. Stressing blocking this
past week, Taylor will field a strong
first eleven, but it is doubtful whe
ther they'll be able to cope with the
onslaught of the Uclans, who have
such a wealth of reserve strength.
Among those who should see
plenty of action for Stanford are
ends Dick Schulze, Tom August, Bob
Scott, and Tom Vasilatas. Gordon
"Tex" White and Walt Watters will
answer the call at tackles. Don Lu
cas and Harry Hunt share the guard
burdens; and Fred Chez or Dick
Abraham, providing the latter has
recovered from a shoulder separa
tion sustained last week, will he
working at center.
Tom Shaw, brilliant passing quar
terback, Boyd Benson, John Banks,
and Gordon MacLachlan round put
the starting backfield for the Pa
pooses. However, southpaw pitcher
Wayne Buck, Wally Odneal, who
performed brilliantly last week
against USC, Ken La Grose, and
punting wizard Ray Dodson are ex
pected to see plenty of action against
the Brubabes.

Tomorrow afternoon Stanford's unbeaten freshmen meet the
powerful UCLA frosh eleven at Stanford Stadium. Chuck Tay
lor's Papooses bump into their toughest foe of the season when
they tackle George Dickerson's power-laden Brubabe ensemble.
In the absence of the varsity gridmen, this attraction will

feature the Farm's weekend of
sports. Also, since admission is free,
a large turnout is anticipated for
this battle of two top yearling
squads.
The visitors boast a first-string
line which averages more than 210
pounds per man, and is reputed to
be as fast as it is big. At ends will
be 200-pound Brock Stroscheim, all -
CIF from Alhambra, and Darrt-I
Riggs.
