### 
Delta Tail Delta's smooth-clicking
passing and running plays proved
too much yesterday afternoon for a
scrappy Phi Alpha Delta squad as
the Delts won their third straight
game by a score of 20 to 0.
John Hall of the Delt squad be
gan his team's victory march early
in the first half when he took a
lateral from Jimmy Bradshaw and
swivel-hipped around right end into
pay dirt. Mill Walkup snagged Brad
shaw's toss in the left flat for the
extra point.
Bill Dale, Irv Hellman, and Jiin
Edwards stood out for the losers.
