# Spirit High As Indians Head North
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
EN ROUTE TO SEATTLE ON
HOARD THE CASCADE WITH
THE INDIANS, DAVIS, Oct. 23.—
Stanford's Indians got off to an aus
picious start for Washington today
as the team bus, on the way to
Oakland to contact the "Cascade,"
collided with an automobile at San
Carlos on the Buyshore Highway.
No one on the team was hurt, al
though many of the players were
badly shaki n up.
A quick exchange of buses was
made, the team arriving at the Oak
land Mole just three minutes before
train time.
Spirit on the squad is line. The
send-off given the boys at the gym,
although of the junior-grade vari
ety, seemed to turn the trick.
They were laughing and joking
on the train at dinner, full of confi
dence and scoffing at the 18-point
odds against them.
Bay Area sports writers accom
panying the team seem to have
caught the spirit also.
They made the following com
ments:
DICK FRIENDLICII, Chronicle—
"I think Stanford has a much better
chance to win than the personnel
comparison and the odds indicate. I
will be surprised il the Indians don't
score twice."
IIAKKY BORBA, Examiner
"Washington should win, but not by
18 points. If Stanford improves on
its tackling, there's no telling how
the game might turn out. Washing
ton's line is weak at the tackles and
guards. IT the Indians can stop Pro
vo and Hatch, I think they will have
a chance."
WALT DALEY, Call - Bulletin—
"We all know Bob Anderson loves
the water. We remember him as a
rnudder against Oregon State last
year. I can't pick Stanford as a solid
bet to win, but they certainly have
a chance. Eighteen points is ab
surd, particularly if the field is
slow. Stanford has an improved de
fense. Taking everything into con
sideration, I'll have to the Hus
kies a slight edge."
BILL DUNBAR, Oakland Tribune
- "Stanford definitely has a chance.
The Indians will have a good de
fense against Washington's ground
attack. If they get a fairly dry field
and have a chance to use Titus,
Quist, and Nafziger on defense, they
can stop the Huskies' dangerous
freddy Provo. I'd say Washington
by one touchdown if the weather
and the field are dry."
But they don't call Seattle the
rainiest city in the West lor noth
ing. It has been raining there since
Wednesday, and from all reports it
looks like rain for the game Sat
urday.

badly shaki n up.
A quick exchange of buses was
made, the team arriving at the Oak
land Mole just three minutes before
train time.
Spirit on the squad is line. The
send-off given the boys at the gym,
although of the junior-grade vari
ety, seemed to turn the trick.
They were laughing and joking
on the train at dinner, full of confi
dence and scoffing at the 18-point
odds against them.
Bay Area sports writers accom
panying the team seem to have
caught the spirit also.
They made the following com
ments:
DICK FRIENDLICII, Chronicle—
"I think Stanford has a much better
chance to win than the personnel
comparison and the odds indicate. I
will be surprised il the Indians don't
score twice."
IIAKKY BORBA, Examiner
"Washington should win, but not by
18 points. If Stanford improves on
its tackling, there's no telling how
the game might turn out. Washing
ton's line is weak at the tackles and
guards. IT the Indians can stop Pro
vo and Hatch, I think they will have
a chance."
WALT DALEY, Call - Bulletin—
"We all know Bob Anderson loves
the water. We remember him as a
rnudder against Oregon State last
year. I can't pick Stanford as a solid
bet to win, but they certainly have
a chance. Eighteen points is ab
surd, particularly if the field is
slow. Stanford has an improved de
fense. Taking everything into con
sideration, I'll have to the Hus
kies a slight edge."
BILL DUNBAR, Oakland Tribune
- "Stanford definitely has a chance.
The Indians will have a good de
fense against Washington's ground
attack. If they get a fairly dry field
and have a chance to use Titus,
Quist, and Nafziger on defense, they
can stop the Huskies' dangerous
freddy Provo. I'd say Washington
by one touchdown if the weather
and the field are dry."
But they don't call Seattle the
rainiest city in the West lor noth
ing. It has been raining there since
Wednesday, and from all reports it
looks like rain for the game Sat
urday.
EN ROUTE TO SEATTLE ON
HOARD THE CASCADE WITH
THE INDIANS, DAVIS, Oct. 23.—
Stanford's Indians got off to an aus
picious start for Washington today
as the team bus, on the way to
Oakland to contact the "Cascade,"
collided with an automobile at San
Carlos on the Buyshore Highway.
No one on the team was hurt, al
though many of the players were
badly shaki n up.
