# Welch to Field Veteran Team
## 
### ART LUBIC 
Conch Ralph "Pest" Welch and
his Washington Huskies have a one
won, three lost seasonal record but
they'll have a few surprises in store
for Stanford in their PCC "battle
for the basement" ;it Seattle tomor
row.
The Huskies move into the Indian
fray at full strength for the first
time this year which sounds much
like Marchie Schwartz's battle cry.
Among the top men to return to the
fold after missing the Oregon game
hist week are Diek Ilagen and Fred
Provo.
Hagen is lated the best defensive
end in the West, and Provo one of
the finest halfbacks. The duo made
All-Coast, honorable mention All-
American, ;ind ran two-three in the
press-box balloting for the out
standing player of last year's East-
West game.
TIGHT PASS DEFENSE
Washington figures to do a good
job bottling up Stanford's passing
game. The Huskies have allowed 20(5
yards net gain from opponent pass
ing in four games this year, or a 51.5
per game average.
Stanford's aerial artists, A 1 Mor
ris and Ainslie Bell, can look for
ward to a rough afternoon if theirs
is the fate of Norm Van Brocklin.
The Huskies stopped the Oregon pass
sensation cold last week.
The Husky offense is built around
the running of halfbacks Provo,
Larry Hatch, and Brooks Biddle,
with T-quarterback Dick Ottele
handling almost all the passing.
Welch relies almost entirely upon a
strong ground attack that has aver
aged 202 yards per game, placing the
Huskies a step behind the PCC's
Big Three -Cal, UCLA, and USC.
Hagen's return at end will move
either Ernie Stein or Gail Bruce to
the bench. Former All-Coast full
back Arnie Weinmeister moved his
2155 pounds into a tackle slot this
year with Doug Vickery on the other
side of the line and Burnett, Bayer,
Prcchek, and Tadich in reserve.
EX-QB AT GUARD
Alf Hemstad and Art Levenhagen
will see action at guards. A 1 112 oper
ated at quarterback in nthe 15)4(5
campaign. The centers are the very
able Gordy Berlin, Bill McGovern.
and Carl Fennema. This trio ranks
with the best in the conference and
is one of the Husky strong points.
The starting backfield has Ottele
at quarter, Provo or Larry Hatch
and Biddle at the halves, and hard
hitting Marshall Dallas at lull. Top
