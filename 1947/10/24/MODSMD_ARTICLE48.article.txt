# Forecasters Tab Washington, Trojans as Weekend Winners
## 
### 
Members of the Daily's sports j
stair, dopesters deluxe, tackle this
weekend's top games throughout the
nation with a conflicting mental
mixture of confidence and doubt.
The confidence has been developed
by the past weeks' predictions, in
which the staff has compiled an en
viable over-all percentage of .7915,
with 23 wins, C losses, and 4 ties.
The doubt is due to the tough line
up of football "crueials" on tap for
this week's ratings — Stanford vs. i
Washington, USC vs. University of
California, Alabama vs. Georgia,
Duke vs. Wake Forest—all exceed
ingly difficult contests to predict.
But the sports scribes, courageous\
to a fault, herewith unhesitatingly F
take the fatal leap into uncertainty:
STANFORD - WASHINGTON;
This is a battle for the Conference
basement. The Indians will be look- j
ing for their first win of the so-far
disastrous season, and the Huskies
will be trying to break into the
win column for the second time this |
year, and the first time in confer
ence play.
Two scribes, showing the proper |
school spirit, give their votes to J
Stanford. One predicts a tie. There- I
maining eight call a close Washing- [
ton victory—nothing comparable to
the five to one odds, even on 18 j
points, beiug quoted in the San
Francisco newspapers.
Consensus: Washington by !> I
points.
USC - CALIFORNIA: A game J
which might well decide the PCC's
Rose Bowl representative. Cal is
unbeaten, untied—one of the few
major teams in the country with a
perfect record. USC has only one
tie -a 7 to 7 deadlock with Rice—to
mar its clean slate. But the Trojans'
crushing 48 to 6 win over Oregon
State last week was enough evidence
for our experts. Eight of them
jumped to USC's side of the fence.
Three picked the Bears.
Consensus: USC by 3 points.
UCLA-SMU: Southern Methodist
has brilliant Doak Walker. The Bru
ins have Benton, Rossi, Shipkey,
Hoisch, ad infinitum. Walker's repu
tation almost evened the scales, but
not quite.
Consensus: UCLA by 4 points.
OREGON-USF: The Webfoot ag
gregation surprised last week with
a (> to 0 victory over Washington.
USF is a high-class outfit, despite
its disappointing loss to Mississippi
State.
Consensus: USE by 8 points.
TEXAS-RICE: A case of a good
team against what may very well be
a great team. The Longhorns have,
among other stars, Bobby Layne—
and what more could any coach ask?
Consensus: Texas by 9 points.
S. F. 49ERS - CLEVELAND: As
Frankie Albert goes, to use a trite
saying, so go the 49ers. II Albert is

"on" the San Francisco eleven could
run away with the game. II not, the
Browns could do likewise. The
scribes seem to think Sunday will be 1
Albert's day.
Consensus: San Francisco by 2
points.
ALABAMA - GEORGIA: The
Crimson Tide looked strong last
week in winning against Tennessee.
Georgia took Oklahoma A&M over
the jumps handily. Five sportswrit-
I ers tabbed Georgia; six sided with
Alabama.
Conjjepsus: Georgia by 1 point.

DUKE-WAKE FOREST: The lat
ter is unbeaten and untied, the for
mer unbeaten but tied once, by
Navy. This one is so close we'd like
to call it a deadlock, but a choice has
to be made.
Consensus: Duke by 1 point.
ILLINOIS-PURDUE: The Boiler
makers are a traditional threat in
! the underdog role, and against llli
| nois they could register an upset,
j But the scribes were unanimous in
j choosing the Fighting Illini.
Consensus: Illinois by 15 points.
PENN-NAVY: The Midshipmen
| showed last week against Cornell
that they could win il given the
proper opportunity. But the scribes
j are fairly certain the powerful Penn
I team will cut off Navy's vifctory
I "streak" at one game.
Consensus: Penn by 19 points.
NOTRE DAME-IOWA: The Irish
should win as they please. lowa, a
pre-season dark horse in the Big
Nine, is now regarded as just another
also-ran.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 21
points.
MICHIGAN - MINNESOTA: Frit/,
j Crisler's Wolverines roll on. They
may buck into a little more compe
| tition this weekend than they are
used to, but the Golden Gophers
cannot entertain much hope of doing
anything more than keeping Michi
! gan from making the game a com-
I plete runaway.
Consensus: Michigan by 15 points.


Stanford's running attack in the Washington game will depend
heavily on speedy, powerful left-halfback 808 ANDERSON. Bob is
scheduled to try a few plays from the fullback spot tomorrow as a pre
lude to a possilde Indian backiield of Bell, Titus, Quist, and Anderson.

Members of the Daily's sports j
stair, dopesters deluxe, tackle this
weekend's top games throughout the
nation with a conflicting mental
mixture of confidence and doubt.
The confidence has been developed
by the past weeks' predictions, in
which the staff has compiled an en
viable over-all percentage of .7915,
with 23 wins, C losses, and 4 ties.
The doubt is due to the tough line
up of football "crueials" on tap for
this week's ratings — Stanford vs. i
Washington, USC vs. University of
California, Alabama vs. Georgia,
Duke vs. Wake Forest—all exceed
ingly difficult contests to predict.
But the sports scribes, courageous\
to a fault, herewith unhesitatingly F
take the fatal leap into uncertainty:
STANFORD - WASHINGTON;
This is a battle for the Conference
basement. The Indians will be look- j
ing for their first win of the so-far
disastrous season, and the Huskies
will be trying to break into the
win column for the second time this |
year, and the first time in confer
ence play.
Two scribes, showing the proper |
school spirit, give their votes to J
Stanford. One predicts a tie. There- I
maining eight call a close Washing- [
ton victory—nothing comparable to
the five to one odds, even on 18 j
points, beiug quoted in the San
Francisco newspapers.
Consensus: Washington by !> I
points.
USC - CALIFORNIA: A game J
which might well decide the PCC's
Rose Bowl representative. Cal is
unbeaten, untied—one of the few
major teams in the country with a
perfect record. USC has only one
tie -a 7 to 7 deadlock with Rice—to
mar its clean slate. But the Trojans'
crushing 48 to 6 win over Oregon
State last week was enough evidence
for our experts. Eight of them
jumped to USC's side of the fence.
Three picked the Bears.
Consensus: USC by 3 points.
UCLA-SMU: Southern Methodist
has brilliant Doak Walker. The Bru
ins have Benton, Rossi, Shipkey,
Hoisch, ad infinitum. Walker's repu
tation almost evened the scales, but
not quite.
Consensus: UCLA by 4 points.
OREGON-USF: The Webfoot ag
gregation surprised last week with
a (> to 0 victory over Washington.
USF is a high-class outfit, despite
its disappointing loss to Mississippi
State.
Consensus: USE by 8 points.
TEXAS-RICE: A case of a good
team against what may very well be
a great team. The Longhorns have,
among other stars, Bobby Layne—
and what more could any coach ask?
Consensus: Texas by 9 points.
S. F. 49ERS - CLEVELAND: As
Frankie Albert goes, to use a trite
saying, so go the 49ers. II Albert is

"on" the San Francisco eleven could
run away with the game. II not, the
Browns could do likewise. The
scribes seem to think Sunday will be 1
Albert's day.
Consensus: San Francisco by 2
points.
ALABAMA - GEORGIA: The
Crimson Tide looked strong last
week in winning against Tennessee.
Georgia took Oklahoma A&M over
the jumps handily. Five sportswrit-
I ers tabbed Georgia; six sided with
Alabama.
Conjjepsus: Georgia by 1 point.

that they could win il given the
proper opportunity. But the scribes
j are fairly certain the powerful Penn
I team will cut off Navy's vifctory

NOTRE DAME-IOWA: The Irish
should win as they please. lowa, a
pre-season dark horse in the Big

also-ran.

heavily on speedy, powerful left-halfback 808 ANDERSON. Bob is
scheduled to try a few plays from the fullback spot tomorrow as a pre
lude to a possilde Indian backiield of Bell, Titus, Quist, and Anderson.
Members of the Daily's sports j
stair, dopesters deluxe, tackle this
weekend's top games throughout the
nation with a conflicting mental
mixture of confidence and doubt.
The confidence has been developed
by the past weeks' predictions, in
which the staff has compiled an en
viable over-all percentage of .7915,
with 23 wins, C losses, and 4 ties.
The doubt is due to the tough line
up of football "crueials" on tap for
this week's ratings — Stanford vs. i
Washington, USC vs. University of
California, Alabama vs. Georgia,
Duke vs. Wake Forest—all exceed
ingly difficult contests to predict.
But the sports scribes, courageous\
to a fault, herewith unhesitatingly F
take the fatal leap into uncertainty:
STANFORD - WASHINGTON;
This is a battle for the Conference
basement. The Indians will be look- j
ing for their first win of the so-far
disastrous season, and the Huskies
will be trying to break into the
win column for the second time this |
year, and the first time in confer
ence play.
Two scribes, showing the proper |
school spirit, give their votes to J
Stanford. One predicts a tie. There- I
maining eight call a close Washing- [
ton victory—nothing comparable to
the five to one odds, even on 18 j
points, beiug quoted in the San
Francisco newspapers.
Consensus: Washington by !> I
points.
USC - CALIFORNIA: A game J
which might well decide the PCC's
Rose Bowl representative. Cal is
unbeaten, untied—one of the few
major teams in the country with a
perfect record. USC has only one
tie -a 7 to 7 deadlock with Rice—to
mar its clean slate. But the Trojans'
crushing 48 to 6 win over Oregon
State last week was enough evidence
for our experts. Eight of them
jumped to USC's side of the fence.
Three picked the Bears.
Consensus: USC by 3 points.
UCLA-SMU: Southern Methodist
has brilliant Doak Walker. The Bru
ins have Benton, Rossi, Shipkey,
Hoisch, ad infinitum. Walker's repu
tation almost evened the scales, but
not quite.
Consensus: UCLA by 4 points.
OREGON-USF: The Webfoot ag
gregation surprised last week with
a (> to 0 victory over Washington.
USF is a high-class outfit, despite
its disappointing loss to Mississippi
State.
Consensus: USE by 8 points.
TEXAS-RICE: A case of a good
team against what may very well be
a great team. The Longhorns have,
among other stars, Bobby Layne—
and what more could any coach ask?
Consensus: Texas by 9 points.
S. F. 49ERS - CLEVELAND: As
Frankie Albert goes, to use a trite
saying, so go the 49ers. II Albert is

"on" the San Francisco eleven could
run away with the game. II not, the
Browns could do likewise. The
scribes seem to think Sunday will be 1
Albert's day.
Consensus: San Francisco by 2
points.
ALABAMA - GEORGIA: The
Crimson Tide looked strong last
week in winning against Tennessee.
Georgia took Oklahoma A&M over
the jumps handily. Five sportswrit-
I ers tabbed Georgia; six sided with
Alabama.
Conjjepsus: Georgia by 1 point.

DUKE-WAKE FOREST: The lat
ter is unbeaten and untied, the for
mer unbeaten but tied once, by
Navy. This one is so close we'd like
to call it a deadlock, but a choice has
to be made.
Consensus: Duke by 1 point.
ILLINOIS-PURDUE: The Boiler
makers are a traditional threat in
! the underdog role, and against llli
| nois they could register an upset,
j But the scribes were unanimous in
j choosing the Fighting Illini.
Consensus: Illinois by 15 points.
PENN-NAVY: The Midshipmen
| showed last week against Cornell
that they could win il given the
proper opportunity. But the scribes
j are fairly certain the powerful Penn
I team will cut off Navy's vifctory
I "streak" at one game.
Consensus: Penn by 19 points.
NOTRE DAME-IOWA: The Irish
should win as they please. lowa, a
pre-season dark horse in the Big
Nine, is now regarded as just another
also-ran.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 21
points.
MICHIGAN - MINNESOTA: Frit/,
j Crisler's Wolverines roll on. They
may buck into a little more compe
| tition this weekend than they are
used to, but the Golden Gophers
cannot entertain much hope of doing
anything more than keeping Michi
! gan from making the game a com-
I plete runaway.
