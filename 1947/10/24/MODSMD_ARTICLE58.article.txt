# A 						Strong Block 'S' Society
## 
### 
Block "S" award winners, led by Pete Aug
ust, are now laying the groundwork for a re
vitalized Block "S" society at Stanford.
Organizations composed of varsity letter
winners are strong on most campuses and
could be powerful at Stanford.
Properly organized, the Block "S" Society
would take the lead in furthering Stanford's
intercollegiate sports program. It would de
velop a spirit of camaraderie among those
who represent Stanford on the athletic field.
It would add importance to the Block "S"
sweater.
The Block "S" Society also could have an
active and enthusiastic alumni group similar
to those of many schools.
Those who are behind the move to revive
the Block "S" Society realize the potentialities

of the organization. They have plans and the
energy to carry them out.
The Stanford campus will rightly welcome a
rejuvenated Block "S" Society.
