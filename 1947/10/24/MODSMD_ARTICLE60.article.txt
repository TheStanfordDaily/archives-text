### GEORGE BRUNN 
Your first reaction, if any, to the French elections
might be: ah, good, the Commies got put in their
place.
Your second reaction is not likely to be quite so
joyful. For while the figures show that De Gaulle's
"Rally of the French People" emerged as the strong
est party, the figures also show that the Communist
vote did not decrease and may even have increased
slightly.
The big losers were the Socialists (a rather con
servative party in France) who got only ten percent
of the total vote, and the middle-of-the-road MRP
which was practically wiped out.
Thus De Gaulle, an outspoken believer in strong
government—see, for example, his Bourdeaux speech
last spring—drew most of his support from the cen
ter parties. As a result France finds itself in the rather
unfortunate position where the two most powerful
political groups are opposed to democratic govern
ment although they are willing to utilize it for the
moment to gain their ends. While De Gaulle has
no exact counterpart here, imagine Gerald L. K.
Smith and William Foster as our leading politicians.
De Gaulle campaigned on a strict anti-Commun-

ist platform. He wasn't for anything in particular, he
was just "agin." According to him the issue was
America or Russia. He managed to convince a
goodly proportion of the French people that we are
on his side. It is to be hoped that this is not true.
One of our most cherished democratic principles
is that the end does not justify the means. Applied
to European politics this means that we cannot fight
Communism any way we please, particularly not by
supporting extremists on the other side.
Aside from philosophy, if we consider Commun
ism as a disease we must be aware that it can only
be cured by attacking its causes. To lend our assist
ance to De Gaulle's aspirations to become Napoleon
IV would be like trying to cure scarlet fever with
diphtheria.
Communism springs primarily from discontent,
hunger, and unemployment. It can be weakened by
strengthening the European economy. It cannot be
weakened by telling the people of France and the
other nations on the continent that bread lines will
form on the right. Hitler, the shining example of
the anti-Bolshevik messiah, didn't stop the Reds
but almost stopped us. Let's not try that stunt again.

De Gaulle campaigned on a strict anti-Commun-

ist platform. He wasn't for anything in particular, he
was just "agin." According to him the issue was
America or Russia. He managed to convince a
goodly proportion of the French people that we are
on his side. It is to be hoped that this is not true.
One of our most cherished democratic principles
is that the end does not justify the means. Applied
to European politics this means that we cannot fight
Communism any way we please, particularly not by
supporting extremists on the other side.
Aside from philosophy, if we consider Commun
ism as a disease we must be aware that it can only
be cured by attacking its causes. To lend our assist
ance to De Gaulle's aspirations to become Napoleon
IV would be like trying to cure scarlet fever with
diphtheria.
Communism springs primarily from discontent,
hunger, and unemployment. It can be weakened by
strengthening the European economy. It cannot be
weakened by telling the people of France and the
other nations on the continent that bread lines will
form on the right. Hitler, the shining example of
the anti-Bolshevik messiah, didn't stop the Reds
but almost stopped us. Let's not try that stunt again.
Your first reaction, if any, to the French elections
might be: ah, good, the Commies got put in their
place.
Your second reaction is not likely to be quite so
joyful. For while the figures show that De Gaulle's
"Rally of the French People" emerged as the strong
est party, the figures also show that the Communist
vote did not decrease and may even have increased
slightly.
The big losers were the Socialists (a rather con
servative party in France) who got only ten percent
of the total vote, and the middle-of-the-road MRP
which was practically wiped out.
Thus De Gaulle, an outspoken believer in strong
government—see, for example, his Bourdeaux speech
last spring—drew most of his support from the cen
ter parties. As a result France finds itself in the rather
unfortunate position where the two most powerful
political groups are opposed to democratic govern
ment although they are willing to utilize it for the
moment to gain their ends. While De Gaulle has
no exact counterpart here, imagine Gerald L. K.
Smith and William Foster as our leading politicians.
