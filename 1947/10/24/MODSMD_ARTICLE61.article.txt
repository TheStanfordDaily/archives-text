To the Editor:
Your editorial of October 20 states: "Organiza
tions which are not recognized by the ASSU cannot
solicit funds on campus. This does not, however,
prevent them from meeting on campus nor adver
tising their meetings." Events have proved this state
ment incorrect.
PCA's last meeting was to be held in the Stan
ford Village Club Room. Arrangements for such a
meeting had been approved by Village authorities on
the condition that the ASSU office had no objec
tions. PCA was informed by Guyla Runyan, Vice-
President of ASSU, that the meeting could be held if
there were to be no off-campus speakers, and if no
mention of it was made in The Stanford Daily. Miss
Runyan said that she would notify the Village of
ASSU's approval. Complying with these requests,
PCA went ahead and notified its members.
The day before the planned meeting, PCA was
told by an Administration official at the Village that
it could not have the Club Room. It was then too
late to notify the members. The meeting was held on
the Village tennis courts.
There is deep concern today over the prohibiting
of political groups on campus. The recent action by
Excom, and the last Sunday night "tennis court"
incident have transcended the PCA question. The
right of all to organize for the purpose of dissem
inating a particular political idea and their right
of formal assembly, are the issues on our campus
today.
Joining Joan Willoughby and those who addressed
an open letter to the Administration and ASSU Ex
com, I would also like to see an answer to these
problems.
