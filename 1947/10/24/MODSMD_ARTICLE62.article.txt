There are ghosts on the Farm these days.
In every classroom at Stanford, in every campus
dining hall and over every counter and table where
food is served to hungry students at mealtime, there
are ghosts—ghosts of people who as you read these
lines have died of starvation somewhere in the world.
During the coming winter, while we follow the
pursuits of "higher learning," those ghosts will in
crease in number—men, women and children will die
because they could not get enough to eat.
Those ghosts should haunt the consciences of
Stanford students and of all Americans, for we have it
in our power to enable a great many of these people
who would otherwise die to live.
With these considerations in mind, the following
recommendations are made:
(1) It should be considered a crime to waste
food. Every slice of bread or scrap of food thrown
into the garbage of a campus dining hall should be

looked upon as contributing to the starvation of
some person overseas.
(2) Clubs, fraternities, living groups—all campus
organizations should make every effort to send food
packages abroad at least once a month. CARE, the
government-approved agency set up for this purpose,
has specially-packed boxes available. For informa
tion contact the San Francisco office at 444 Market
Street.
(3) Every student and faculty member should
write to his representatives in Congress urging an
immediate special session for the purpose of passing
an emergency relief measure to stave off starvation
until the Marshall Plan goes into operation. Every
day of delay in the passage of such a measure means
more lives lost.
(4) Excom should give special consideration to
the matter of bringing the situation to the attention
of all students and faculty and conducting a cam
paign for action along these or similar lines.
