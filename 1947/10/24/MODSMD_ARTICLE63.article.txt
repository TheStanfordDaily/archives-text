To the Editor:
Last spring the AVC attempted to arrange a cam
pus address by Mr. Henry Wallace. The administra
tion rejected the proposal on grounds of the "par
tisan" nature of Mr. Wallace's views. Last week a
secret meeting of Excom placed in considerable doubt
the approval of a political affairs organization on the
basis of "partisan" activities.
At the last Tuesday evening lecture, the chair
man of the board of trustees enthusiastically pre
sented Mr. Jan Ciechanowski, former undersecretary
of foreign affairs in the Polish exile government.
The speaker's address was a vehement condemna
tion of the Soviet Union and a spirited challenge to
the U.S. to assume world "leadership" and "dom
inance." He advocated atomic threats in negotiations
and American support without exception of all gov
ernments taking up the banner of anti-communism.
Beyond one's agreement or disagreement with
these views, he must concede their partisan nature.
In the Chronicle's words, the speaker is avowedly
a "forthright opponent of 'appeasement' of Russia."
Indeed, the emotional tone of Mr. Ciechanowski's
address was far more that of the didactic preacher
than of the world affairs analyst.
Why, then, was the "partisan" rule invoked in Mr.
Wallace's case and not in Mr. Ciechanowski's? Each
is bent on propagating a political message. Each is
best known publicly for his opposing views on the
Russian problem.
The reason for the selective treatment is, per
haps, quite obvious in the nature of Stanford's fin
ancial support. But beyond that question, why is the
administration not at least frank about its position?
Why does it not come out clearly and publicly in a
definition of those views dangerous to the school's
interests? Why can we not be told precisely and
honestly just whom we can hear and why?
