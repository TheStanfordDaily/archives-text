# Stanford Law Students Hold 'No Decision' Trial Nov. 19
## 
### 
The Supreme Court of Stanford
will decide the case of plantiff Paul |
C. Roberts versus a Negro, John
Henry, for buying and occupying a j
house in a racially-restricted zone, j
Nov. 19, at 7:30 p.m., Cubberley Au- i
ditorium.
Law students M. L. Silvers. R. E.
Lyon, R. N. Achor, and F. L. Smee,
selected by the Moot Court Board j
in previous tryouts, will argue the I
case. Plaintiff's counselors, Smee and |
Achor, will try to prove the racial |
restrictions law is not void and un
enforceable, to set aside the sale of
the house to the Negro and force
him to leave. Silvers and Lyon
will attempt to sustain the lower
court's decision that the law is con
trary to the public policy of Stan
ford and the United States.
Justice Jesse W. Carter, Supreme
Court of California, Judge Maurice
T. Dooling Jr., and Judge C. J.
Goodell, both of the California Dis
trict Court of Appeals, comprise the
body of distinguished California j
jurists who will decide which of the

four competitors argues his case
best. $100 is the first prize, $50
second, and $25 third and fourth.
No actual decision will be handed
down as many similar cases are
pending in California courts at the
present time.
