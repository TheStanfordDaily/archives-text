# Dances Are Slated By Hawaiian Club
## 
### 
A closed dance and a sukiyaki
dance are the next events on the
Hawaiian Club roster.
The Stanford Hawaiian Club is
making plans to contact its sister
club at the University of Oregon.
Members of the Oregon club will be
invited to attend the dance which
is tentatively set for Nov. 5.
Some of the members suggested a
debate on Hawaiian statehood. A
slogan offered was: "Hawaiian State
in '48." However, no one at the
j meeting seemed inclined to take the
I con side.
Moving pictures taken in the Ha
| waiian Islands are scheduled for the
next few meetings. One of the pic
tures will depict the latest eruption
of Mauna Loa. All persons who are
interested in the islands are invited
to attend.
