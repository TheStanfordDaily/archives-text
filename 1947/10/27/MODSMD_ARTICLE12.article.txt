# 'Body' Found Near Roble
## 
### 
A dummy which had been miss
ing for two weeks from the San Jose
State Health Office was found last
Thursday by Don Armitstead, Stan
ford anatomy student, hanging in a
tree near Roble.
Armitstead took the mannikin to
his I'oom at the home of E. W. Van
Gorder, greenskeeper of the golf
course. Van Gorder's daughter
learned from a San Jose student
that the Health Office was shy one
dummy.
BODY' VALUED AT $1,000
Armitstead and Mrs. Van Gorder
notified Dr. Carl Duncan, San Jose
State Health Director, and the pro
fessor came to identify the "body."
"I recognized the little fellow im
mediately," Dr. Duncan said.
"The manikin is made of papier
mache. It would cost between $1,000
and $1,500 to replace the dummy,
but it would be impossible to secure
another of the same quality," said
Miss Margaret Twombly of the San
Jose State Health Office.
BKAINS MISSING
"The poor thing! His brains arc
missing and his left clavicle is
broken, but otherwise he seems to
be in good shape," Miss Twombly
exclaimed.
It is thought that perhaps the
brains were dropped some place on
campus, and the San Jose State
Health Office asks that if anyone
finds them, he return them either
to the state college or to The Daily.
DETECTIVES SEARCH
An extensive search had been
carried on for the mannikin during
the two weeks that he was missing.
The San Jose police department was
notified and the detective bureau
took over the case.
The mannikin was placed in an
inner office of the Health Office on
his return, so that he might not
stray again.
When it was discovered that the
mannikin had lost his brains at
Stanford a San Jose student re
marked, "Well, it's no wonder. He
didn't need any up there."
