# Cal 'C' Painted Red By Unknown Visitors
## 
### 
Daylight yesterday morning in
Berkeley revealed a red-striped
Cal "C" instead of the usual gold
symbol emblazoned on the hills
above the University of California
campus, reports from the world's
largest university said.
Cal campus observers, absorbed
in the morning-after blues, could
not say whether the pseudo-ar
tists, who obviously ran out of
the well - known cardinal color,
had been apprehended.
"We didn't even notice it this
morning," said the representa
tive, "and we don't know what
campus the group was from."
