LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 26
(UP). â€” Anti-Franco forces in the
United Nations are considering ask
ing the 57 UN countries to refrain
from new trade agreements or oth
er commercial arrangements with
Spain, it was learned tonight.
A formal proposal embodying
such steps may be introduced in the
57 - nation political and security
committee of the UN General As
sembly when it takes up for the
second straight year the hot potato
of relations between UN countries
and Franco Spain.
Proponents of such a step, it was
understood, want to rally substan
tial support for their plan before
actually calling on the Assembly to
debate it. They already have given
up the idea of trying once more to
get through the Assembly a recom
mendation for the severance of dip
lomatic relations between all UN
countries and the government of
Generalissimo Francisco Franco.
Leaders in the anti-Franco fight
which has arisen at every session of
the Assembly have been Russia, Po
land, the other Soviet bloc states,
and several Latin American coun
tries. It was known that represen
tatives of these nations have been
consulting each other.
