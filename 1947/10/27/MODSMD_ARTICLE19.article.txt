# Martin Elected To Leading Post
## 
### 
One of the most important single
jobs in the California, Nevada, Ha
waii region of the National Stu
dents' Association landed in Stan
ford's possession last night.
The regional convention voted
unanimously to give Stanford the
Commission on International Af
fairs.
Chuck Martin, Stanford's lIR
head, was unanimously voted chair
man of the commission.
The other of the two major com
missions — Domestic Affairs — was
voted to Loyola. Gene Nye of that
school was elected chairman.
A conflict between USC and Stan
ford was headed off in a caucus
when SC agreed to support Stanford
for the commissionship if Stanford
would agree to make it a rotating
job.
So Stanford will keep the Inter
national Commission for two years,
at the end of which it may be voted
to another school.
The Southern California delega
tion had headed north with instruc
tions to secure the commission for
SC, but Bob Stevens, delegate from
Troy, agreed that Stanford was
much better equipped to handle the
commission immediately.
Martin presented a seven - point
regional program which includes
sponsorship of the Western College
Congress to be held at Stanford
Nov. 24-26, an information project
in Europe next summer along the
lines of Harvard's Salzburg project,
a Council on Atomic Implications
(at SC), and a bulletin of inter
national information to be published
at Stanford.
The convention further approved
Martin's recommendations that each
school (1) have its own specific re
lief project like Stanford's adoption
of Naples University, (2) have a
foreign scholarship exchange pro
gram, and (3) organize forums or
conferences to awaken international
interest among students.
