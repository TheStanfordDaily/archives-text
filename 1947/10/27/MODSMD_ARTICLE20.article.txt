"Wednesday's sun dawns bright
and happy. Lucky students, pet
your Chappie," crowed the Old
Boy in Esperanto.
The first issue of Chaparral will
come out Wednesday to startle
freshmen and tickle all, he an
nounced.
"There will be 48 pages of scin
tillating wit. hunior. fantasy, sat
ire, and whimsy—plus four cov
ers!" chortled a staff member.
"Stories, poems, cartoons—we got
scads of 'em."
No less than 21 editors-in-chief
collaborated on the first issue. It
will sell at five campus spots for
25 cents, or a special wholesale
price of $.'$ a dozen.
