# NSA Draws Approbation
## 
### 
Following statements were made
during the NSA convention:
TOM MARTZLOFF, ASSU presi
dent: I'm impressed by this con
ventionâ€”the intelligence and qual
ity of the delegates is high and all
the schools seem to have taken hold
of NSA solidly.
I am for NSA's ratification and
will recommend that action to Ex
com.
Our main job, as I see it, is to
impart our enthusiasm to all the
students on campus and to bring
Stanford's participation up to the
level of the other schools. We must
form a strong NSA organization
here. Its nucleus should be the 12
delegates and alternates to this
convention. They have the back
ground. But all the students have
to take part to make NSA a work
ing reality at Stanford.
While Guyla Runyan (ASSU
vice-president) and I cannot take
charge of all -details attendant to
the NSA chapter at Stanford, we
can put the support of student gov
ernment here behind them.
GUYLA RUNYAN, ASSU vice
president: There are a few very
minor questions that have yet to
be answered to my complete satis
faction. But I would say that I am
considerably impressed by the cali
ber of representatives that the
schools sent. I can see the worth
of Stanford's joining.


TOM MARTZLOFF, ASSU
president and delegate to the re
gional NSA convention, said last
night he would recommend rati
fication of the organization to Ex
com.
