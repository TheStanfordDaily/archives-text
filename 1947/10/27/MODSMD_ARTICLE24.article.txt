# Excom Gives Political Group Policy
## 
### 
Bocau.se of the misunderstanding
engendered by the recently an
nounced policy with regard to par
tisan political action groups, Exec
utive Committee I'eels it necessary
to write this open letter to the stu
dent body.
This policy does not bar from the
campus political discussions by non
partisan forums, panels, debates,
etc., which give students valuable
information and experience.
Summer quarter, attempts were
begun at organizing a Stanford
chapter of the Progressive Citizens
of America. The matter was con
sidered then, and taken up at one
of the first Excom meetings this
quarter. The question of chartering
this group as a Stanford student or
ganization brought up the whole
problem of politics on campus and
Excom felt it necessary to adopt a
general policy in regard to such ac
tivities.
In a discussion extending over
several weeks many arguments
were presented and several things
became apparent. It was generally
agreed that subversive groups
should not be allowed. The conclu

sion was also reached that it was
not proper or desirable for Excom
to classify groups as radical or non
radical. Therefore, if any political
groups were to be allowed on cam
pus it was felt that all such groups
must be allowed.
In the discussion of the unde
sirability of allowing partisan po
litical-action groups, it was pointed
out that most of these groups are
committed in advance to a single
point of view and are not interested
in free speech as such. National po
litical-action groups aim at using
the students and the name and rep
utation of their university to sup
port these groups' outside objec
tives. The use of Stanford's name
and of Stanford students as such
would involve the University in the
activities of these groups.
It was at this point that the in
formation was given that a provi
sion in the Founding Grant states,
"None of the assembly halls, build
ings, or grounds of the University
shall be used for political or parti
san addresses or gatherings," and
that an addition to the Founding
Grant was made by court decree at

Mrs. Stanford's request that, "The
University shall forever be kept out
of politics . .
Since the Executive Committee
cannot act contrary to the Founding
Grant, we felt it imperative that
precise information be obtained
from the administration on this
point. Dr. Tresidder and Dean
Kimpton attended a meeting of Ex
ecutive Committee at Excom's re
quest in order to answer questions.
It was agreed that the meeting
should be closed.
Because the meeting was closed,
Dr. Tresidder and Dean Kimpton
were able to speak more freely, to
support, their points of view with
incidents and personalities, and to
answer the close questioning by the
members of Excom.
At the open meeting which fol
lowed, recognizing the undesirable
aspects of partisan political - action
groups, facing the problem of ad
mitting all or none, and facing the
clear provision of the Founding
Grant, Executive Committee formu
lated its policy.
