Carroll L. Blacker, superintendent
of buildings and grounds, announced
that 20.3 per cent of construction
work on the new underground elec
trical development has been com
pleted. He also said that he has no
idea when the entire job will be
finished and ready for campus use,
since certain electrical equipment is
not expected to be available for
some time. The project is being car
ried on with a skeleton crew of five
men both because of this lack of
equipment and due to the fact that
the Corporation Yard is pressed for
personnel and cannot spare more
men.
The superintendent said that the
main reason for undertaking (he es
timated $175,000 project is that the
present system is outmoded and ob
solete. He elucidated this statement
saying that our wiring system as it
stands today is not only incapable
of carrying the current we need
now. but also of being divided into
subsidiary mains which could illu
minate and empower future Farm
buildings.
The new system, ultra modern in
all respects, will remedy many de
fects, and will be "set up to provide
for future needs as well. There is
under construction an entirely new
substation which will receive all
electricity direct from P. G. and E.
lines, and< parcel it out through the
various subterranean mains to all
campus areas.
