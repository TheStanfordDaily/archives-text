# Shoe Shop Keeps Standfordites in Step
## 
### HAL NININGER 
The press of activity in the Book
store every day is well matched by
a hustle-bustle around the corner
in the Campus Shoe Shop.
"It's the old, endless scramble for
knowledge in there," says Maurice
Delyon, the proprietor, motioning
toward the 'Bookstore, "but sooner
or later I get them back here when
the other extremity needs atten
tion."

Delyon estimates that in the last
10 years he has repaired enough
shoes to reach, laid end to end, to
the far turn of the Bay Meadows
race track.
Furthermore, samples of his work
are no doubt well scattered over the
globe as exchange students, return
ing home to Rio, Delhi, London,

Canton, and points in between, are
apt to be sporting one of his half
sole jobs.
Delyon, a native of the Bay Area,
first started working in the shop in
1938 when his uncle owned it. Eut
rafter his uncle's death in 1945 Mau
rice took over. The original shop,
on the campus since 1912, became
as much a Farm landmark as the
big redwood.

"More Stanford people are getting
shoes repaired than ever before,"
says Delyon, glueing on an O'Sul
livan. "If this keeps up they're gon
na have to throw beach sandals at
the weddings."
"Women, especially, bring thier
shoes in. They naturally prefer re
treads to paying these high tariffs

for such fragile merchandise."
But when asked whether he
thought men or women were the
hardest to satisfy, Delyon admitted
that women had the edge on being
fussy about footgear, "although in
prom season we get a heavy play
from particular parties of both sex
es," he added.
SPRING BRINGS RUSH
The campus shop has its busiest
season from January until April, tin l
wet months, when a doughnut sole
is a beckon to pneumonia.
"But for that matter, we're always
'busiest'," laughs Delyon, who with
his assistant not only repairs shoes
but fixes everything from ski boots
and concha belts to notebook bind
ers.

SHOP CLOSES FOR GAME
On Saturday afternoons during
the fall quarter when the "Shop
Closed" sign is in the window, cus
tomers can be assured that Delyon
is at the game.
"I was here nine years before I
saw a game," he stated, skiving off
a piece of sole leather with a cob
bler's knife, "so last year I decided
it was about time I saw the Indians
in action. After all, who has a bet

race track.
Furthermore, samples of his work
are no doubt well scattered over the

Canton, and points in between, are

sole jobs.
Delyon, a native of the Bay Area,
first started working in the shop in
1938 when his uncle owned it. Eut
rafter his uncle's death in 1945 Mau
rice took over. The original shop,
on the campus since 1912, became
as much a Farm landmark as the
big redwood.
BUSINESS INCREASES
"More Stanford people are getting
shoes repaired than ever before,"
says Delyon, glueing on an O'Sul
livan. "If this keeps up they're gon
na have to throw beach sandals at
the weddings."
"Women, especially, bring thier
shoes in. They naturally prefer re
treads to paying these high tariffs

for such fragile merchandise."
But when asked whether he
thought men or women were the
hardest to satisfy, Delyon admitted
that women had the edge on being
fussy about footgear, "although in
prom season we get a heavy play
from particular parties of both sex
es," he added.
SPRING BRINGS RUSH
The campus shop has its busiest
season from January until April, tin l
wet months, when a doughnut sole
is a beckon to pneumonia.
"But for that matter, we're always
'busiest'," laughs Delyon, who with
his assistant not only repairs shoes
but fixes everything from ski boots
and concha belts to notebook bind
ers.

SHOP CLOSES FOR GAME
On Saturday afternoons during
the fall quarter when the "Shop
Closed" sign is in the window, cus
tomers can be assured that Delyon
is at the game.
"I was here nine years before I
saw a game," he stated, skiving off
a piece of sole leather with a cob
bler's knife, "so last year I decided
it was about time I saw the Indians
in action. After all, who has a bet
ter residential right to cheer for the
home team?"
The press of activity in the Book
store every day is well matched by
a hustle-bustle around the corner
in the Campus Shoe Shop.
"It's the old, endless scramble for
knowledge in there," says Maurice
Delyon, the proprietor, motioning
toward the 'Bookstore, "but sooner
or later I get them back here when
the other extremity needs atten
tion."

Delyon estimates that in the last
10 years he has repaired enough
shoes to reach, laid end to end, to
the far turn of the Bay Meadows
race track.
