A young fellow we know came
home from high school in the mid
dle of the day and told his mother:
"I got into an argument with my
English tescher, and she sent me to
Mr. Murnie, and finally I told him
to go to hell." The mother, rather
horrified, arranged a conference the
next day with the principle, Mr.
Murnie, and her son. "I'm sure
Philip regrets telling you to go to
hell," she apologixed. "That wasn't

Murnie tensely. ' What he really
said was, 'Mr. Murnie, you can go
to hell and you tan take Miss Cud
lip with you'."
