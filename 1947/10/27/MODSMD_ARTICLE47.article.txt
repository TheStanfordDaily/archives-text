home from high school in the mid
dle of the day and told his mother:
"I got into an argument with my
English tescher, and she sent me to
Mr. Murnie, and finally I told him
to go to hell." The mother, rather
horrified, arranged a conference the
next day with the principle, Mr.
Murnie, and her son. "I'm sure
Philip regrets telling you to go to
hell," she apologixed. "That wasn't

said was, 'Mr. Murnie, you can go
to hell and you tan take Miss Cud
lip with you'."
