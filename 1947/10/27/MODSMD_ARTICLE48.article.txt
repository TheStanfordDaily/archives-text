# Great Greate Teammates Not; Farm Loses Fifth Straight Tilt to Washington, 25 to 0
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
ABOARD THE BEAVER WITH THE STANFORD INDIANS,
Oct. 26—Stanford made more mistakes Saturday afternoon than
any football team should make all season, that is with the excep
tion of a big blonde halfback named George Quist.
While his teammates fell apart beneath Washington's 25-

point ground attack, Quist, playing
in a purely defensive role, roamed
from one side of the line to the other
smashing down Washington ball car
riers as they sifted through the
weak Indian forward wall.
But George couldn't handle it all.
Gents like Sam Robinson, Fred
Provo, Larry Hatch and Marshall
Dallas, behind a Husky line that
was opening up wide holes, just
poured through into the Card sec
ondary in such numbers that it
would have taken five Quist's to
stop them.
GOOD START
After the initial kickoff, which the
Indians received, it looked like the
men from the Farm were in for a
good afternoon. From his own 22,
Bobby Anderson l ipped of! 11 yards
at right tackle on the first play.
Wayne Erickson, the best offensive
back on the Farm squad, poured
through a huge hole at right guard
but was tripped up after three
yards. Bob Anderson tried the same
play but stumbled and fell after two
more yards were gained. Then Dur
ket came in the ball game to kick.
Mike got off a good kick of 45
yards to Fred Provo who returned
to his own 35. What happened after
that happened all day. Provo hit
right end for five. Robinson ripped
through center for another five and
a first down on the 45. Provo rat
tled through left tackle for three and
then moved around the other end for
12 yards and another first down on
the Indian 40.
WASHINGTON SCORES
Then, with all the Cards looking
in the opposite direction, Herb Har
low tore through right tackle for
20 more yards to the Stanford 20.
With the partisan crowd of 32,000
getting their money's worth Sam
Robinson bulled through right tac
kle, eluded Bob Anderson and John
Barnes, swung right and kept right
on goging into the corner of th end
zone standing up for a touchdown.
Bob Mikalson's conversion attempt
was wide.
The Indians got their hands on the
ball three times alter that in the
first quarter but were unable to get
started. A pass from Ainslie Bell to
Bob Anderson for 23 yards put the
Cards close to the 50-yard stripe but
a Provo interception stopped the
drive before it started.
HOSTS SCORE AGAIN
Near the end of the first half
Washington rooters were once again
on their feet as a sustained drive
carried the Huskies from their 49
to the Indian 21.
Brooks Biddle, Washington half,
tried light tackle and ran into Quist
for a one yard gain. Larry Hatch
tried right end and met Quist but
picked up five. Washington was
then penalized 15 yards for holding.
With the ball on the Card 26-yard
line and the Indian secondary close
to the line expecting another run
ning play, Dick Hagen sneaked be
hind the Indian backs and reached
across the goal line all by himself
ready to receive a pass from Fred
Provo. Don Campbell, racing back
to cover his position, didn't get
within 10 yards of the big All-Coast
end but Hagen dropped the ball and

all hands breathed easy once more.
They breathed a little too easy,
though, for on the next play Provo
circled right end for 26 yards and
a score. This time Mikalson's con
version was good and the Huskies
led 13 to 0.
INDIANS DRIVE
At the start of the second half
the Indians looked like Clark
Shaughnessey's 1940 T machine.
Starting from the 27, this is the
way it looked: Chuck Coker at left
tackle for 11, Bob Anderson through
right guard for four, Coker punch
ing right tackle for three and Erick
son around left end for seven more
yards and another first down on the
Washington 48.
It was then that Bob Anderson
almost put the Redmen back in the
ball game. He took a neat handoft
from Bell, slipped through a nice
hole at right tackle, cut back to the
left at full speed and got into the
clear. He appeared to be going all
the way, but Provo, coming from
the outside, cut him down on the
Husky 28.
It went for naught, however, as
referee Bill Fisher caught an Indian
holding and the ball went back to
the Stanford 37.
CARDS STOPPED
The Cards had shot their bolt. Two
plays later Bell flipped a quick pass
out in the left flat where Washing
ton center Gordy Berlin was stand
ing. The big fellow gobbled the
ball up on his own 45 and plodded 55
yards more to paydirt. Chuck Coker,
the only man who could make a race
out of it, was live yards behind
when Berlin crossed the goal. Mik
alson's conversion was good.
The climax of the day that sent
the Washington i-ooters home happy
occurred in the fourth quarter when
Durket, back to punt on his own 10-
yard line, received the ball at prac
tically the same time Husky full
back Marshall Dallas arrived. The
ball and Dallas reached the end zone
together and the 25th point went
up on the scoreboard.

ABOARD THE BEAVER WITH
THE STANFORD INDIANS, Oct.
26.—They didn't look like they had
lost the ball game. Of course, the
Stanford dressing room after the
Husky contest didn't resound with
the cheers and slaps on the back
that go with a winner. After five
straight losses the Cards seem to
have resigned themselves to the
fact that — "Well, maybe we just
don't have it."
Coach Marchie Schwartz stood ex
pressionless in one corner of the
dressing room answering questions
from the press. "We made a lot of
mistakes today—no, Washington was
not 25 points better than us.
"In the line Martin and Mervin
at ends and tackle Whit Budge
played well . . . for Washington
guard Hemsted, center Berlin and
back Sam Robinson looked good . . .
Injuries? It looks like we've lost
Wayne Erickson and Bob Rohrer for
the Oregon State game. Both have
pulled shoulder muscles."
