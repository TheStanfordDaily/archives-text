# JV's Trample Fort Ord, 71-0; Use 48 Men in Scoring Parade
## 
### 
Ability to run the Fort Ord ends
at will plus the general ineptitude
of the soldier eleven enabled Stan
ford's junior varsity to run up a 71
to 0 win in its first regular game of
the season in Stanford Stadium
Saturday.
The Jayvoes thoroughly outplayed
the visiting eleven, scoring 25 points
in the first quarter, 20 in the second
canto, 13 in the third, and 13 in
the last period. Coach Jim Cox
gave every one of his 48 squadsmen
a chance to see action.
Only once did the soldiers pene
trate into Indian territory and then

only to the 45-yard line where they
lost the ball on a pass interception.
Standing out among Indian line
men were guards Harry Dahlberg
and A 1 Mannon, and end Bill Far
rar. Backs Van Johns, Jack McKil
lip, John Leslie, Pete Peckharn, and
Bob Bohlman ran the hapless sol
[ diers ragged.
After the game, mentor Cox com
| mented, "We won all right, but I
J was not satisfied with the blocking.
| Our tackling was pretty good,
though." Although outweighed by
the slow-moving Fort Ord eleven,
the Stanford Jayvees exhibited vast
superiority in all departments.
