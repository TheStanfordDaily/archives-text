# Win Two in Water Polo
## 
### 
Finally hitting the winning trail
j after two initial setbacks, Stanford's
varsity water polo team rebounded
with a vengeance over the weekend
to scuttle game but outmanned
invading squads from UCLA and
! Fullerton J.C.
In their first conference game, the
j Cards dropped the Uclans, 9 to 1,
I Friday afternoon, and came back
Saturday morning for a repeat 7 to 3-
non-conference win over the Ful
lerton J.C. Hornets.
In the Uclan game, the Indians
started slowly but overcame the
UCLA defenses early in the second
quarter and scored practically at will
in the final three stanzas of what
was probably the most rough and
tumble battle staged in the Encinn
Pools in many a season â€”a game
marked by many fouls which were
overlooked by the referee.
Card mentor Haynie substituted
freely in the last quarter and the
reserves hit for two points after the
starters had compiled a seven-point
lead.
The Fullerton game was almost a
carbon copy of the preceding after
noon's battle, with Stanford taking
! the lead early in the second quarter
I and building it up throughout the
j remainder of the game.
Big Walter Lull, playing forward
s for the first time this season, gar
nered seven goals over the week
end to lead the Stanford attack in
both contests.


TOM lIAYNIE has entered an
other strong contender for Pacific
Coast water polo honors this sea
sun. Don't be misled by the ser
ious countenance above, because
(lie youthful, genial aquatic mentor
has plenty to smile about after
the Cardinal mermen's double vic
tory last weekend.
