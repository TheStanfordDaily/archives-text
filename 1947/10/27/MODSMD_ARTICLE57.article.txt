King Football had his day Satur
day when he ruled supreme over the
Farm. In addition to the double
header played in the Stanford sta
dium, three titanic games were
fought out on the intramural sand
lots.
Most thrilling of these poor men's
gridfests was the Kappa Alpha-Vil
lage 306 tussel, in which the Row
boys nipped the Village dwellers
6 to 0.
In other morning mural mixups
the Alpha Sigs rolled over Encina
5W 8-0, and Toyon 135 fell victim
to the Breakers 16-0.
In volleyball, the smooth running
ATO team took two quick sets, 15-4
and 8-0, from the Sigma Chi's in a
Friday afternoon net battle.
In the opener, Crayton Jones'
aerial serves accounted for eight of
his team's 15 points, with six of them
coming consecutively.
In the second game the Sigma
Chi's had a hard time getting around
lanky Hal Simonsen and dropped
the game.
The honor of scoring the net sea
son's first double shutout went to
the Phi Sigma Kappa's when they
clipped the Breakers 11-0, 11-0.
Results of other Friday tilts:
Delta Upsilon 15-15, Encina 5E
8-8; Alpha Sigma Phi 11-12-15,
Kappa Alpha B's 0-15-11; Village 117
! (Ill) 0-15; Delta Tau Delta (I) 15-
15, Encina 1W 2-6; Phi Delta Theta
(I) 15-15, Village 151 6-1; Zeta Psi
15-11, Village 314 5-0.
