SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26 (UP).—
Quarterback Otto Graham put on
i one of the greatest passing exhibi
| tions in football history here today as
he led the Cleveland Browns to a
! 14-7 victory over the San Francisco
Forty-niners and undisputed pos
session of first place in the western
division of the All-American Con-
I ferencc.
The score might have been greater
! except for a pair of great goal-line
stands by the Forty-niners—once in
the first period and again in the
' fourth.
The 49ers scored in the second half
when Norm Standlee plunged over
i from the one-yard line.
