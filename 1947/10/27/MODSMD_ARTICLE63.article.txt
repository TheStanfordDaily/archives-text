# Give Football Back to the Players
## 
### 
The 1947 football season will go down in
the record books as the season of the extended
half-time intermission.
With the apparent assumption that the actual
football game is but a preliminary or follow-up
to the real entertainment of the afternoon—
the colorful halftime ceremonies—college
bands this year have strived to take the
game away from the football players.
A typical example of the mis-managed half
time proceedings which have plagued college
stadia this fall was in evidence at the Stanford-
UCLA game. A more flagrant violation ap
peared during the University of California-
USC battle Saturday.
In the UCLA game here at Palo Alto the
southern school's band retired from the field
only after both teams returned to the field, the
officials had motioned to it that its place was
now on the sidelines, and a mounting roar of
disapproval from the stands descended upon
the brightly-clad musicians.
This is not aimed at the UCLA band alone,
however. The Stanford band also appeared
on the field, but, representing the home school,
it managed to show its wares first.
At Berkeley, the USC band attempted to
imitate Barnum, Rose, or at least the Olympic
Games, with a time-consuming pageant which
was a pleasure to see—but at some time when
your pocket didn't contain ticket stubs which

supposedly allowed you to watch a football
game.
The blame falls upon the planners of the
mid-game programs. With good intentions
they plan these extravaganzas. But you don't
pack stadia with good intentions.
Take heed! The customer pays to see foot
ball, not to hear music and to watch sprightly
young bandsmen prove that it isn't easy to
march and make noise at the same time.
The football player reaches his psycho
logical peak in the first half and finds a drawn
out halftime detrimental. He yearns to get
back into the game—dislikes to stand around
while the bands finish the last 135 bars of the
college fight song.
With professional football making inroads
in the box office receipts, college football—
let's admit it, it brings in a lot of money—
can't afford to offer the football spectator some
thing he doesn't like in anything other than
small doses.
Why not limit the rival bands to eight min
utes apiece on the greensward at halftime. If*
they still want to show each other up give
them a vacant lot somewhere and let them
match bugle calls at fifty paces.
But give the fan a break. He wants to see
a football game—and still get home the same
day.

out halftime detrimental. He yearns to get
back into the game—dislikes to stand around
while the bands finish the last 135 bars of the
college fight song.
With professional football making inroads
in the box office receipts, college football—
let's admit it, it brings in a lot of money—
can't afford to offer the football spectator some
thing he doesn't like in anything other than
small doses.
Why not limit the rival bands to eight min
utes apiece on the greensward at halftime. If*
they still want to show each other up give
them a vacant lot somewhere and let them
match bugle calls at fifty paces.
But give the fan a break. He wants to see
a football game—and still get home the same
day.
The 1947 football season will go down in
the record books as the season of the extended
half-time intermission.
With the apparent assumption that the actual
football game is but a preliminary or follow-up
to the real entertainment of the afternoon—
the colorful halftime ceremonies—college
bands this year have strived to take the
game away from the football players.
A typical example of the mis-managed half
time proceedings which have plagued college
stadia this fall was in evidence at the Stanford-
UCLA game. A more flagrant violation ap
peared during the University of California-
USC battle Saturday.
In the UCLA game here at Palo Alto the
southern school's band retired from the field
only after both teams returned to the field, the
officials had motioned to it that its place was
now on the sidelines, and a mounting roar of
disapproval from the stands descended upon
the brightly-clad musicians.
This is not aimed at the UCLA band alone,
however. The Stanford band also appeared
on the field, but, representing the home school,
it managed to show its wares first.
At Berkeley, the USC band attempted to
imitate Barnum, Rose, or at least the Olympic
Games, with a time-consuming pageant which
was a pleasure to see—but at some time when
your pocket didn't contain ticket stubs which

supposedly allowed you to watch a football
game.
The blame falls upon the planners of the
mid-game programs. With good intentions
they plan these extravaganzas. But you don't
pack stadia with good intentions.
Take heed! The customer pays to see foot
ball, not to hear music and to watch sprightly
young bandsmen prove that it isn't easy to
march and make noise at the same time.
The football player reaches his psycho
logical peak in the first half and finds a drawn
out halftime detrimental. He yearns to get
back into the game—dislikes to stand around
while the bands finish the last 135 bars of the
college fight song.
