# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL MUNK 
Before I say another word and come forth with
Ibis sputtered complaint and accusation against every
coed that clutters up this fair institution, may I claim
that it's not personal experience that's driving me to
utter this truth, but pure, unadulterated, altruistic
emotions.
After that prelude by A-sharp minor, down to
business and facts in this grand expose. (Boy, I
wonder if this will rival some of those Congressional
committee farces going on down Washington way.)
Anyway, I accuse the women of this ivory-walled
community of turning on too much of that power that
wilts the campus males. Of late the femmes have
turned it on so strong that the eager men have for
gotten their pride completely, and gone slightly hay
wire.
The result of this general madness has been that
the drooling men have gone and dated the girls as
much as two, three, and even four weeks in advance.
Top contenders for the booby prizes in this ridiculous
competition goes to the jokers, and there are some on
campus, who have started making dates for Christ
mas and New Years' Eve.
For Christopher's sake, will this scourge never
cease! At this rate I suggest that when prc-reg time
comes around for winter quarter, blanks be issued so
each girl can get her winter dates all planned out
before Christmas.
If all the men would unite in a non-profit organ
ization to fight this unfair practice, this gruesome sit
uation might yet be checked. Otherwise, all is lost
and our free enterprise system will be overthrown
by tyranny and slavery. Never underestimate the

power or a woman, for if she gets the chance she
will do the men dirty.
Gone are the days when a simple phone call or
chance meeting on Quad were sufficient to get a
date for the weekend, those wonderful days when
life was so simple and cheap. Compare that to the
present when you can't go out and guzzle (censored)
with a girl unless you were thirsty 17 days before!
Rally to the cause, comrades, and regain your
self-respect and standing. Don't let the odd ration, I
mean ratio, upset your common sense. Don't give the
women the self-satisfaction of thinking they're so
sought after that men worry about them.
Down with the eager beavers! Give the rest a
chance. (Since this finishes my social life on campus,
I'll be available in the Libe every Friday and Sat
urday night the rest of the year. Come in and tell
me your stories of woe. We can cry on each other's
shoulders. What fun!)

Spread-of-confusion Dept.: Overheard near the
cellar at noon, one young thing indicated that
parents, too, suffered from confusion. Examining a
letter she had just received, she noted, "Why, my
father is forgetting himself. This letter is addressed
to my sister; she graduated from Stanford in '45."

Special Care Dept.: If any more outbreaks of
poison oak occur, I'll form my own conclusions. The
student body has been sufficiently warned by the
Health Service that "there are luxuriant growths (of
poison oak) throughout the hills surrounding the
campus."
For the last time, keep off those hills. You know
it's bad business.
