To the Editor:
Wc think that in Campus Opinion, Oct. 23, per
haps Miss Boyle has misinterpreted the significance
of Joan Willoughby's statement on student govern
ment at Stanford. What Miss Willoughby appeared,
to us, to imply was that the issues student govern
ment deals with are relatively insignificant compared
to those which would be faced by political groups.
This is not saying that Stanford student govern
ment does not represent the students fairly, or that
it is not effective in the sphere in which it acts. It
does not imply that student government docs not
deserve the support of the students. But it does
say that student government is an entirely inade
quate substitute for the experience with national
issues which political groups could give the students.
Is it sufficient for a citizen to deal solely with local
affairs, necessary and valuable as they might be, or
should he not also have a chance to deal with the
broader and deeper issues confronting the nation?
