To the Editor:
Peonies to Wayne Sargent for his timely defense
of (he burp. Too long has the burp languished in
disrepute. Who dares say how many millions inhabit
America's mental hospitals today because their nat
ural and healthy desire to burp was frustrated by
bigoted society?
I well remember an unhappy incident of my ado
lescence. I was attending a birthday party with sev
eral other future leaders of the nation. Just after
consuming my third portion of banana cream shish
kebab (a mystic Oriental dish). I felt one of my more
potent burps approaching. I remembered my mother's
strict instructions in this crisis and stepped quickly
into the washroom. Seconds later the house rocked
on its foundations and the lights went out.
"My God," shrieked our nost's mother as she
ran into the room carrying a candle, "and we're
right on the San Andreas fault! Under the table,
children!"
But the fatal shock did not come. Then all was
made clear as I appeared in the doorway, dabbing
contentedly at my lips with my napkin. Alas for
liberty! I was ejected on the spot and told never to
darken their door again.
So great was my mortification that I thought my
mind would give way. It did. As I write these
words from behind the stern granite walls of the
Little Monster Home for the Insane, the birds twitter

peacefully in the far away and the odor of burning
flash is wafted gently to me from the electro-shock
therapy department.
Therefore I say unto you: Sanctify the burp, and
you will empty the nation's sanitariums.
