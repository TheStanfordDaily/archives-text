To the Editor:
The arguments expressed in Wednesday's editorial
concerning student-couple seating is typical of the
stand taken by writers whose points of view are not
above question. These arguments stating that facts
substantiate the claims always overlook the relevancy
of the facts and the actual questions they are pur
portedly answering.
The only fact in question was why student cou
ples were forced to sit in a section of the stands ex
tending from the 10 yard line through the end zone.
The editorial's reason that the most good was done
for the largest number by such an arrangement,
failed to explain the presence of a very large block
of general admission seats between the Stanford stu
dent rooters and the Stanford couple section. Cer
tainly if the most good was to be done, the entire
student section including the rooters should be moved
to the end zone allowing 4,000 more $P>.oo seats for
the general public, whose attendance, though small,
certainly outnumbered the student by 3 to I—this
we are not advocating, but Rally Com is missing a bet
for the Big Game if such a plan is not adopted.
In recapitulation, the facts that should be an
swered in an attempt to show the complaints of this
letter to the unfounded are —
(1) Why were the student couples' seats not only
poor but separated from the rest of the student body I
by a large block of general admission seats?
(2) If the alumni's dollar means so much to j
athletic officials, why aren't all students given
equally as poor seats, leaving the 50 yard-line seats
for the money bags?

(I'lditor's note: One reason why the rooting sec
tion is partially divided by a "general admission"
section is the increased enrollment. Ticket sales
begin well before registration day. The rooting
section was planned for a student body equal to
that of last year. The Increased enrollment necessi
tated the addition of another block of seats to the
section. The best seats remaining at that dale vvtic
the ones now used for couples.)

athletic officials, why aren't all students given
equally as poor seats, leaving the 50 yard-line seats
for the money bags?

(I'lditor's note: One reason why the rooting sec
tion is partially divided by a "general admission"
section is the increased enrollment. Ticket sales
begin well before registration day. The rooting
section was planned for a student body equal to
that of last year. The Increased enrollment necessi
tated the addition of another block of seats to the
section. The best seats remaining at that dale vvtic
the ones now used for couples.)
