# Farm Dancer Wins Award
## 
### 
Miss Elizabeth Spies, who was
graduated from Stanford last spring,
recently won a dancing scholarship
with Jose Limon in New York, ac
cording to a letter received by Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, assistant professor
of physical education.
Before the war Limon was the
outstanding male dancer of the
Charles Weidman troupe. Miss
Spies spent the summer dancing at
Ted Shawn's school, Jacob's Pillow,
and while there she was observed
by Limon. Later in the season when
she applied for the Limon scholar
ship, Limon remembered her and
awarded her the honor.
In addition to her dancing, Miss
Spies is writing her Master's thesis
on German dance.
The work for her thesis is partic
ularly difficult because she is hav
ing to translate most of her material
from German.
In a history and philosophy class
last year, Miss Spies translated from
German into English the book "Das
Mary Wigman-Werk," by Rudolph
Bach. It is a biography of Mary
Wigman, the person who originated
modern dance and introduced it into
this country, said Mrs. Lidster.
While on campus Miss Spies was
a member of Orchesis. She did the
choreography for a Gershwin con
certo for the Spring Sing.
