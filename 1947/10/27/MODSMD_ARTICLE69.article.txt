The artistry of the Paganini
String Quartet dazzled a capacity
audience at Cubberley Hall Friday
evening in the second concert pre
sented by Friends of Music at Stan
ford.
The program included the Quartet
in B Flat Major, Opus (J4, No. 3, by
Haydn; Beethoven's Quartet No. 8
in E Minor. Opus 59. No. 2 (Rasou
mowsky No. 2); and the String
Quartet of Debussy.
The Beethoven quartet, one of
three in that form written for
Prince Rasoumowsky, received a
performance which will be long re
membered by all who heard it. The
players' richness of tone and pre
cision of attack brought forth all the
deep emotional content of the work
in an ideal performance.
Debussy's quartet demands flaw
less interpretation on the part of all
the players as well as perfect tone
control. If it is overdone, it be
comes a vulgar mass of tone, and if
underplayed, it is totally ineffective.
However, when it is performed as
beautifully as it was Friday eve
ning, it shines in all its subtle splen
dor.
The concert proved to all that the
Paganini Quartet is definitely to be
placed among the world's finest.
