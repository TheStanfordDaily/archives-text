"I still like Indian food better j
than American food," declared Ko- j
jakully Shivarama Hegde, in refer
ence to one of the Hindustan Club's
typical Indian dinners. "We use
much more spices and rice in our
food."
"I'm getting used to American
food, though," he added, "and after
two years at Stanford I don't miss
Indian food as much as I used to."
Preparing typical Indian dinners
are special events for members of
the Hindustan Club, and 200 stu
dents attended the last one, given on
Aug. 15, Indian Independence Day.
ORGANIZED HERE IN '45
The dinners are one of many so
cial functions of the local club,
which was organized here in 1945
for the purpose of integrating the
social lives of Indian students on
campus and establishing friendships
with other students.
"Hindustan clubs are found in
colleges throughout the country,"
said Hegde, "to help serve the more
than 2,000 Indians studying in the
United States."
The club has shown many Indian
made movies, which resemble
American movie "shyrts." They con

sist mainly of Indian music and |
dancing, Hegde said.
NO SOCIAL DANCING
The Indians do not have social
dancing. All dancing is done for
the sake of performance and can be
most closely compared to folk danc
ing, he pointed out.
"Medha Yodh, the Indian girl at
Stanford, is accomplished in the In- .
dian dances," Hegde said, "and a |
program of Indian dancing is being
planned for the whole campus.
