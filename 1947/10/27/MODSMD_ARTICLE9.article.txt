Problems of watcrbagging and
quiet hours will face Encina spon
sors when they convene in the En
cina library at 7:15 p.m. Monday,
according to Don Corr, head spon
sor.
Suggestions for various forms of
"legalized" watcrbagging were made
at a recent meeting of corridor
presidents, but at the present time
it seems doubtful that such a meas
ure will be approved by the Encina
council, Corr said. At the present
time, the policy of the council is
that all waterbagging is forbidden.
The council will also attempt to
arrive at some method of controlling
and enforcing quiet hours in view
of the fact that the quiet period has
not been well observed by residents.
