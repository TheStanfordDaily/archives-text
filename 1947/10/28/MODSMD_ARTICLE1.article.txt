rescuers reported today.
The four-engined DC-4 airliner ploughed into the upper slopes

of 3,500-foot Mt. Evzones. The crash
and the explosion were so violent
that human remains, fragments of
wreckage, and torn scraps of luggage
were scattered over the mountain
side for a distance of more than 1,000
feet.
