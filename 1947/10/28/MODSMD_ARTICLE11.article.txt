BOSTON, Oct. 27 (UP).â€”Physi
cist Albert Einstein today demanded
that America outlaw the atomic
bomb and proceed with the forma
tion of a limited world government
"with or without the Russians."
Writing in the November issue of
Atlantic Monthly magazine, Einstein
said that the United States "has
been solemnly invited to renounce
the atomic bomb . . . and has de
clined to do so unless its terms are
met ... I believe this policy is a
mistake."
"In refusing to outlaw the bomb
while having the monopoly of it,
this country suffers ... in that it
fails to return publicly to the ethi
cal standards of warfare formerly
accepted previous to the last war,"
he said.
