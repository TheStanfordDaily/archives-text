contact Jean Strong, Russell House,
or Margaret Powers, Union Resi

In response to yesterday's appeal
for transportation, Coate announced
that a caravan of grocery store push
carts supplemented by a jeep pla

need now are pushers," Coate re
iterated.

ment, announced that an exhaustive
supply of ice cream novelties had
been obtained. "Bombers, Atom
bars, Popsicles, Dixie cups, even a
South American novelty with a

day afternoon and continue till
10:30, barring rain, Coate an
