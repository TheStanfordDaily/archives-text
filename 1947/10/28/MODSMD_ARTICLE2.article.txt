planes and other private aircraft,
ranged low across the Alaskan and
Canadian coasts in hopes of spotting
signal flares—or the wreckage—of
the four-engined Skymaster.
The plane, carrying 13 passengers,
including an infant child, has been
missing since 1:44 p.m. (PST) yes
terday when Pilot Capt. A. N. Mon
son gave up an attempt for a laud
ing at Annette Island, across Ton
gass Narrows from Ketchikan, be
cause of extreme turbulence.
