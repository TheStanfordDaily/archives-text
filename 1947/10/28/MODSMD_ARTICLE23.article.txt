# Journal Tells Minority View
## 
### 
"To have tolerance, we must
work together." This is the creed
of "The Mincom," a new student
newspaper, published by 10 gradu
ate students to explore the prob
lems of minority groups.
The publication of the mimeo
graphed weekly (the second issue
appeared yesterday) was underta
ken by a group of seminar students
in Dr. Lawrence Thomas' course in
educational sociology who have or
ganized themselves into a Minority
Committee as a class project. They
are using "The Mincom" as a me
dium to make "experience a process
of education."
"We hope to instigate a movement
which will not only benefit the mi
nority group, but the educational
sociology class and Stanford itself,"
declared Wayne M. Mann, chairman
of the group.
The first two issues of "The Min
com" have included reports of out
side readings upon minority prob
lems dealing with Negro popula
tions and their treatment, study of
elementary schools' inequality of
education, and anti-Semitism.
Divided into political, economic,
and social squads, each division of
the Minority Committee deals sepa
rately with problems of its respec
tive subgroups and is currently
interviewing Palo Alto citizens to
ascertain trends and minority prob
lems in this area.
