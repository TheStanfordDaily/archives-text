The stifTcst competitor the Stan- !
ford Flying Club pilots will face in j
Saturday's Pacific Coast Intercolle- !
legiate Air Meet at Livermore ap
pears to be the University of Cali- I

fornia Flying Club, Walt Lull, Farm
club president, prophesied yester
day.
"With a large number of former
military pilots in their fold," he

continued, "the California squad
will be keyed up to avenge last
May's air defeat when Stanford
took the long end of (he score 73 to
45 at Concord.

California is counting on their
large supply of former military and
Civil Air Patrol members to bring
home the big silver cup for the
Bears.
"With only two war pilots enter
ing the meet for Stanford," Lull
added, "we appear to be quite an
underdog. But on the basis of last
May's meet, the Farm's civilian
trained pilots should prove to be
quite an asset."
Easiest event for the California
club to capture may be the dive
bombing contest. Several Bear fly
ers received ample practice when
they worked for the Navy Ail" Force
during the war.
Thursday night,,the Stanford Fly
ing Club will hold its final pro
meet conference at 7:30 in the third
floor lounge of the Women's Club
house, Lull announced. "We will
welcome any student to attend the
meeting," Lull said, "especially
those students who flew during the
war and could give us aid in plan
ning the events.''
Complete property damage and
| public liability insurance belongs to
I the Farm air club. Every club pilot
j flying at any time for the Stanford
| group comes under policy coverage,
he said.
Friday night six of the 12 Farm
pilots entering the meet will go to
I Piedmont for a pro-meet dinner at
j the home of one of the California
I pilots. Last-minute changes in pro
cedure will be announced at that
I time.


Stanford Flying Club pilots and their guests gather around their rented, club-owned, and privately owned
planes before taking oIT for a beach picnic and swim at Capitola. Picnics, air meets, and sight-seeing trips
were commonplace last spring when rains disappeared for the season. 'I his quarter the Hying club will
transfer their activities to movies, guest speakers, and "field trips." Such a trip is planned later in the year to
MoiTett Field when club members will inspect Naval operation of ground controlled approach, the newly
[ developed method of directing planes to a safe, blind land.

Stanford Flying Club pilots and their guests gather around their rented, club-owned, and privately owned
planes before taking oIT for a beach picnic and swim at Capitola. Picnics, air meets, and sight-seeing trips
were commonplace last spring when rains disappeared for the season. 'I his quarter the Hying club will
transfer their activities to movies, guest speakers, and "field trips." Such a trip is planned later in the year to
MoiTett Field when club members will inspect Naval operation of ground controlled approach, the newly
[ developed method of directing planes to a safe, blind land.
The stifTcst competitor the Stan- !
ford Flying Club pilots will face in j
Saturday's Pacific Coast Intercolle- !
legiate Air Meet at Livermore ap
pears to be the University of Cali- I

fornia Flying Club, Walt Lull, Farm
club president, prophesied yester
day.
"With a large number of former
military pilots in their fold," he

continued, "the California squad
will be keyed up to avenge last
May's air defeat when Stanford
took the long end of (he score 73 to
45 at Concord.

California is counting on their
large supply of former military and
Civil Air Patrol members to bring
home the big silver cup for the
Bears.
"With only two war pilots enter
ing the meet for Stanford," Lull
added, "we appear to be quite an
underdog. But on the basis of last
May's meet, the Farm's civilian
trained pilots should prove to be
quite an asset."
Easiest event for the California
club to capture may be the dive
bombing contest. Several Bear fly
ers received ample practice when
they worked for the Navy Ail" Force
during the war.
Thursday night,,the Stanford Fly
ing Club will hold its final pro
meet conference at 7:30 in the third
floor lounge of the Women's Club
house, Lull announced. "We will
welcome any student to attend the
meeting," Lull said, "especially
those students who flew during the
war and could give us aid in plan
ning the events.''
Complete property damage and
| public liability insurance belongs to
I the Farm air club. Every club pilot
j flying at any time for the Stanford
| group comes under policy coverage,
he said.
Friday night six of the 12 Farm
pilots entering the meet will go to
I Piedmont for a pro-meet dinner at
j the home of one of the California
I pilots. Last-minute changes in pro
cedure will be announced at that
I time.
