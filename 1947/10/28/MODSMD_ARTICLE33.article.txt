# S.F. Opera's 25th Season Closes
## 
### BUD KEENAN 
When the Opera House's famous
j uld curtain came clown on the last
act of "Louise" two weeks ago, the
Silver Anniversary season of the
? n Francisco Opera Company
came to an end. Ever since the per
formance of "La Boheme" back in
1923, grand opera has been steadily
flourishing in San Francisco, and
the local company now holds the
admirable record of 25 years of un
broken performances.
BRILLIANT SEASON
On the whole, the past season was
a brilliant and distinguished one,
bringing back many operas not seen
here for years, and introducing sev
eral new ones. Some operas like
"Pelleas et Melisande," "L'Amore
dei tre Be," and ''La Gioconda" are
not usually found in the operatic
repertoire, but this year they were
enthusiastically welcomed back and
proved wise choices.
One wonders why Debussy's "Pel
leas" is not more frequently per
formed, because it is a music-drama
of great beauty and lyric melody.
As performed by Lawrence Tibbett,
Bidu Sayao, and Martial Singher, it
was close to perfection.
DON GIOVANNI' REWARDING
The season was opened by Verdi's
"La Traviata," and it was a pleas
ure to note that this operatic work
horse has been re-staged. The per
formance I saw was a repeat, and
unfortunately the occasion found
the star, Licia Albanese, in poor
form. When she wasn't flatting, she
sang the role of Violetta with her
customary bravura, and was ably
■ upported by Charles Kullman and
Leonard Warren.

The most rewarding of all the
operas was, to my mind, Mozart's
"Don Giovanni." The music flows
evenly and beautifully through this
tragi-comic story and, as sung by
a splendid cast, proved an inspiring
event. Outstanding among the sing
ers were Ezio Pinza in the title role,
Regina Resnik and Nadine Conner
as two of his conquests, and Salva
tore Baccaloni as the man-servant.
Kullman sang Don Ottavio excel
lently, and can be a very good tenor
when riot required to sing above his
range.

This year also saw the return of
"Tristan und Isolde" with Helen
Traubel and Set Svanholm as the
star-crossed lovers. Miss Traubel
lacks Kirsten Flagstad's perfection,
but she is far more human. In spite
of the music and the excellent sing
ing, "Tristan" is an opera you
couldn't take very often. It is long
and itring, in the best German style.
FAUST' DISAPPOINTING
The most disappointing opera,
strangely enough, was "Faust." It
seemed to me a clumsy, unmoving,
and of ten-burlesqued piece of mu
sic. The score sounded forced and
uninspired, and the dramatic cli
maxes were all too choppy. The oc
casion was notable chiefly for the
appearance of Ezio Pinza's daugh
ter, Claudia, as Marguerite. She did
her best with a dull and stuffy part,
but the story of Faust, as Gounod
tells it, seems a let-down.
"La Boheme" appeared toward
the end of the season and was
promptly ruined by Jan Peerce. He
tried and tried to play Rodolfo, but
just couldn't make it. To me, he is
a greatly overrated singer, but he's
still one of the better ones avail
able.
OPERA ON UPSWING
The Silver Anniversary season
was one of the finest we've ever had,
due especially to increased emphasis
on acting and to the tasteiul and
imaginative re-staging of several
operas.
Opera in America seems to be
emerging from its shiny showcase
setting and into the minds and
hearts of the people. This is an en
couraging sign.

HIDII SAYAO, who sang i.i De
bussy's "Pelleas et Melisande,"
given by the San Francisco Opera
Company this season.
When the Opera House's famous
j uld curtain came clown on the last
act of "Louise" two weeks ago, the
Silver Anniversary season of the
? n Francisco Opera Company
came to an end. Ever since the per
formance of "La Boheme" back in
1923, grand opera has been steadily
flourishing in San Francisco, and
the local company now holds the
admirable record of 25 years of un
broken performances.
BRILLIANT SEASON
On the whole, the past season was
a brilliant and distinguished one,
bringing back many operas not seen
here for years, and introducing sev
eral new ones. Some operas like
"Pelleas et Melisande," "L'Amore
dei tre Be," and ''La Gioconda" are
not usually found in the operatic
repertoire, but this year they were
enthusiastically welcomed back and
proved wise choices.
One wonders why Debussy's "Pel
leas" is not more frequently per
formed, because it is a music-drama
of great beauty and lyric melody.
As performed by Lawrence Tibbett,
Bidu Sayao, and Martial Singher, it
was close to perfection.
DON GIOVANNI' REWARDING
The season was opened by Verdi's
"La Traviata," and it was a pleas
ure to note that this operatic work
horse has been re-staged. The per
formance I saw was a repeat, and
unfortunately the occasion found
the star, Licia Albanese, in poor
form. When she wasn't flatting, she
sang the role of Violetta with her
customary bravura, and was ably
■ upported by Charles Kullman and
Leonard Warren.

The most rewarding of all the
operas was, to my mind, Mozart's
"Don Giovanni." The music flows
evenly and beautifully through this
tragi-comic story and, as sung by
a splendid cast, proved an inspiring
event. Outstanding among the sing
ers were Ezio Pinza in the title role,
Regina Resnik and Nadine Conner
as two of his conquests, and Salva
tore Baccaloni as the man-servant.
Kullman sang Don Ottavio excel
lently, and can be a very good tenor
when riot required to sing above his
range.

This year also saw the return of
"Tristan und Isolde" with Helen
Traubel and Set Svanholm as the
star-crossed lovers. Miss Traubel
lacks Kirsten Flagstad's perfection,
but she is far more human. In spite
of the music and the excellent sing
ing, "Tristan" is an opera you
couldn't take very often. It is long
and itring, in the best German style.
FAUST' DISAPPOINTING
The most disappointing opera,
strangely enough, was "Faust." It
seemed to me a clumsy, unmoving,
and of ten-burlesqued piece of mu
sic. The score sounded forced and
uninspired, and the dramatic cli
maxes were all too choppy. The oc
casion was notable chiefly for the
appearance of Ezio Pinza's daugh
ter, Claudia, as Marguerite. She did
her best with a dull and stuffy part,
but the story of Faust, as Gounod
tells it, seems a let-down.
"La Boheme" appeared toward
the end of the season and was
promptly ruined by Jan Peerce. He
tried and tried to play Rodolfo, but
just couldn't make it. To me, he is
a greatly overrated singer, but he's
still one of the better ones avail
able.
OPERA ON UPSWING

was one of the finest we've ever had,
due especially to increased emphasis
on acting and to the tasteiul and

OPERA ON UPSWING
The Silver Anniversary season
was one of the finest we've ever had,
due especially to increased emphasis
on acting and to the tasteiul and
imaginative re-staging of several
operas.
Opera in America seems to be
emerging from its shiny showcase
setting and into the minds and
hearts of the people. This is an en
couraging sign.

Company this season.
