# Conference Held On European Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP).â€”
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall and other top government offi
cials met today with nearly 100
prominent private citizens at a
"close door seminar" on the for
eign aid program rapidly being
whipped into shape for presentation
to Congress.
Representatives of business, labor,
agriculture, and the general public,
who attended the all-day secret ses
sion in the East Wing of the White
House, said "nothing startling" was
divulged.
They confirmed the report of
Charles A. Ross, White House press
secretary, that the meeting was "a
sort of seminar, for the sole purpose
of presenting facts." And there was
general agreement that the admin
istration leaders had not asked the
visitors to support the Marshall
Plan for European recovery.
Although the conferees were re
luctant to discuss the addresses of
Marshall, Secretary of Commerce
W. Averell Harriman, Secretary of
Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson,
and World Bank President John J.
McCloy, it was reported that the
"seminal'" disclosed:
1. The administration is consider
ing asking Congress for legislative
authority to revive allocations of
some vital materials, notably steel.
But no final decision has been made.
2. The Marshall Plan will be fi
nanced on a "year to year" basis,
with the heaviest outlay in the first
year. But the administration will
give Congress a "yard-stick" esti
mate of the total cost of the entire
four-year program mapped out by
the 16 - nation Paris conference.
Other sources said this estimate
might be as high as $20 billion.
