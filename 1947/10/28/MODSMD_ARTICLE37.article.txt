# 'Hot Time' Slated For Encina Dance
## 
### 
Dancers are in for a hot time at
Encina's big "To H - - - with '51"
affair in the dorm lounge Nov. 15, ac
cording to Bob Lehmann, sponsor
social chairman. -
The theme has been adopted from
the familiar gibe thrown at Encina
by passing sophomores, and the
dance committee promises that the
atmosphere will be a close takeoff
of the land across the Styx. Final
arrangements concerning band and
admission have yet to be made. The
name has been approved by the En
cina council.
Lehmann asks that freshmen in
terested in art and publicity work
join the dance committee.
QUIET HOURS ENFORCED
Quiet hours will be rigidly en
forced in the future by corridor
presidents and sponsors in the fu
ture, Don Corr, head sponsor, stated
following the meeting of the council
Monday night. Quiet hours have
been established for the period fol
lowing 8 p.m. on week nights by the
council.
In conformity with the policies set
for other living quarters on the cam
pus, the ban on waterbagging will
remain in effect by council decision.
STUDY ROOMS SOUGHT
Sponsors, during wing meetings
last night, announced to the fresh
men that an attempt will be made to
obtain two or three study rooms on
the quad for students wishing to do
late studying. Rooms would remain
open and lighted until 12 midnight
or after. All students desiring this
facility were asked to contact Mrs.
Ellen J. Sumner, house mother, who
will make the arrangements if
enough students wish it.
