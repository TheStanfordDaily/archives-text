# Float Entries Due at ASSU Office Friday
## 
### 
Friday is the deadline for ideas for |
floats to be turned in at the ASSU
office, stated Phyllis Graham, fioat
chairman. Theme for the Big Game
parade will carry out the idea of
nomecoming with "Stanford Caval
cade." Houses are expected to fol
low this theme in building their
floats, said Miss Graham.
Representatives from the houses
signing up float ideas at the ASSU
office should check that some other
house has not already asked for
that theme. If there are duplica
tions Cardinals will notify the houses
that will have to change, said Miss
Graham.
Houses, except for Union Unit,
will have to construct their floats
by themselves, instead of combining
with another house as they did last
year.
The parade will be held at night,
and Miss Graham suggested that de
tails should be left off the float as
they will not be able to be seen.
The over-all effect of the float will
be considered in the judging, and
not minute details.
Themes for the decorations of
houses need not follow the "Stanford
Cavalcade" idea. Decorations in or
near houses must be fireproof, but
decorations on lawns or floats need
not be, unless danger of fire is in
cluded in the decoration. In that
case the fire chief must be consulted,
said Miss Graham.
