# Seniors Urged to Keep Picture Appointments
## 
### 
"Seniors—don't forget your photo
appointments for the 1948 Quad!"
Business Manager George Bergland
warned yesterday.
Only a trifle more than 50 per
cent of the students have appeared
at the proper time, he explained.
Photos will be taken in the Quad
shack through Nov. 13.
