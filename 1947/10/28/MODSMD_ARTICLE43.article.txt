# Frosh Bar Cal 'Raid'
## 
### KENT OSMON 
Amid the shouts of "Here Comes
Cal" and "Moider the Bums," fever
ish preparations were made Sunday
night at Encina as the "Dawn Pa
trol" left to mount sentry duty at
the various barricades set up
against the rumored Cal raid.
How did these proceedings start?
There was a vague rumor that per
sons unknown painted the Cal "C"
cardinal red. The frosh were afraid
that the upset Californians might
become annoyed about the whole
procedure, and suspect Stanfordites.
Bundled in coats, sweaters, and
stocking caps, the men of '51 moved
out to the barricades, complete with
a battery of flashlights. They indus
triously stopped cars and searched
occupants for painting equipment.
If any student was found who could
sing the second verse of "Come Join
the Band," he was deemed subver
sive.
One of the suspected Cal offend
ers was found to be Torn Mart/.loff,
ASSU president.
