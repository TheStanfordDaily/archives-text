## Items of Interest to Students of Science and Engineering Industrial Organic Applications of Metallic Sodium 
### 
There would seem to be a consider
able gap between the electrolysis of
salt to make sodium, and research in
the field of organic chemistry. How
ever, at Du Pont as much emphasis
is placed on organic research to de
velop outlets for sodium as on its in
organic uses.
For more than 15 years, intensive
work on industrial uses for sodium
has been carried on in Du Pont lab
oratories and plants by chemists,
physicists, chemical, mechanical and
electrical engineers.
In the organic field, this research
has contributed a number of impor
tant uses for sodium such as the re
duction of fatty esters, particularly
of natural glycerides, to alcohols.

Du Pont organic chemists have
found that sodium with selected sec
ondary alcohols, such as methyl amy 1
alcohol, in the presence of toluene or

xylene, eliminates shortcomings of
the classical method involving ethyl
alcohol and sodium. Practically quan
titative yields of the higher molec
ular weight alcohols are obtained.
This new method is especially use
ful in preparing unsaturated alcohols
not easily made by catalytic hydro
genation. The process can be carried
out at atmospheric pressure and
compares favorably with catalytic
hydrogenation of saturated, higher
fatty esters because of the simplicity
of operation and equipment.
The discovery of the new reaction
conditions has led to the use of mil
lions of pounds of sodium annually
for manufacture of long-chain alco
hols for wetting and emulsifying
agents and synthetic detergents.
Other important processes devel
oped by Du Pont organic research
include the use of sodium for reduc
tion of fatty esters to corresponding
long-chain acyloins, and reduction
of nitriles to primary amines.

Du Pont has also contributed to
the development of many other uses
for sodium and its simple derivatives,
such as in the manufacture of tetra
ethyllead, used in high-grade motor
fuels, dyestulfs synthesis, and de
scaling of alloy steels. In the form of
sodium hydride or sodium alkoxides,
sodium is a catalyst for many Claisen
condensations, useful in the manu
facture of barbiturates, sulfa drugs,
vitamins, keto-acids and diketones.


Sodium for organic reactions is shipped in 90,000-lb. quantities. It is pumped into the car, solidi
fied by cooling and melted by hot oil for removal.
