WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP).—
Movie spokesman Erie Johnston tp
day accused the House Unaiperican
Activities committee of aiding a
"smear campaign" against Holly
wood, but the congressional investi
gators reported today that they in
tended to expose "a lot more" movie
land reds.
Johnston made these main points
in his prepared statement and in
response to questions from commit
tee counsel Robert J. Stripling:
1. Hollywood is not "running over"
with communists, and the commits
tee should exonerate the industry
of that charge.
2. No "flagrant communist propa

ganda films" have been made. If
the committee knows of any such
films it should name them and give
the industry a chance to disprove
the charges. Paul V. McNutt, sjXH'ial
counsel for the industry, made this
same demand yesterday.
3. The Movie Producers Associa
tion which Johnston heads was no
"propaganda" section to determine
whether harmful preachment are in
jected into pictures. The associa
tion's code, he said, is limited to mat
ters of morals and decency and is
not intended to censor political ex
pression.
