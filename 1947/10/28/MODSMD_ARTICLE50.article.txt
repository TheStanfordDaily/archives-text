# Big Red Machine Whips Sig Chi's, 19-6; DU's Win
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
In the only two intramural football games played yesterday
the Big Red Machine of Building 117, Village, and the DU's
emerged victorious. The Machine Men downed the Sigma Chi's
19-6 while the DU's disposed of the Kappa Sigmas 18-6.
The Big Red Machine dominated most of the offensive action

against the Sigma Chi's. In the first
half two of Jack Reed's passes found
their mark, Mick Lachenbrueh and
Bob Teall each snagging one for
touchdowns. The Machine Men's
third and final score came on a 10-
yard gallop into pay dirt by Sam
Paine.
The lone Sigma Chi tally was pro
duced when Bud Richter, climaxing
a sustained drive, sped around end
for a score.
On the opening kick-off of the
DU-Kappa Sig game, Norm Lattin,
with the aid of a key block by Mike
Coonan, went all the way for a
touchdown to give the DU's an early
advantage. The Kappa Sigmas came
back to tie it up on a pass from
Bob Kone to Ric Johnson. How
ever, in the second half Preston's
pass to Gearhart gave the DU's a
lead which they never relinquished.
In the closing seconds of the game
Preston circled end for the final DU
tally.
