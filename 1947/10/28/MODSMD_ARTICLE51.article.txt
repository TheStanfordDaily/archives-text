### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27 (UP).—
Jeff Cravath, coach of the victorious
University of Southern California
football team, today said he would
n't like to pit his Trojans against
University of California again, de
spite USC's 39 to 14 win Saturday.
The Trojan coach said "Nix" when
California Coach Lynn Waldorf re
marked he would like to see the two
teams meet again this coming week
end.
"California is the finest team
we've played this season," Cravath
told the Southern California Foot
ball Writers' Association. "They
are far better than Rice or Ohio
State."
CRAVATH WARNS liERT
Cravath warned Coach Bert La-
Brucherie that his UCLA Bruins are
in for some touble when they tangle
with California here next Saturday.
He also expected a rough afternoon
in meeting Washington at Seattle.
If anything, Cravath said, Califor
nia was keyed at too high a fever
pitch for the game, and after they
ran the first scrimmage play to a
touchdown they may have relaxed
a little, giving the Trojans a chance
to get rolling, he added.
But despite the victory, Cravath
refused to call his team the best in
the world or the nation or even to
compare it with outstanding teams
coached a Souhorn California by the
late Howard Jones.
"They have fine spirit and ambi
tion," he said. "The boys play hard
and with a fairly good line and a
somewhat fast back field, we've been
able to win a few games. I don't
know how long we can keep on
winning. That remains to be seen.
BEARS TAPE HANDS
Asked if he had protested against
the first three California teams com
ing into the game with their hands
taped, Cravath drily said he had not.
He pointed out that the rules pro
vide hand injuries may be taped
and he assumed California had a
lot of men with hurt hands.
"It was a matter i*or the referee
to determine. I guess he was satis
fied they all had hurt their hands
because he let them play with the
bandages. Besides, I don't think
anything like that wins or loses a
ball game," Cravath commented.
I'CLA PLAYS BEST GAME
Coach Laßrucherie said his UC
LA team played its best game of
the season in losing 0-7 to Southern
Methodist and he felt they should
have won except for unexpected
bobbles. Although the Mustangs'
great back, Doak Walker, was bot
tled up most of the afternoon, La-
Brucherie termed him a great half
back and dangerous every time he
got the ball.

football team, today said he would
n't like to pit his Trojans against
University of California again, de
spite USC's 39 to 14 win Saturday.
The Trojan coach said "Nix" when
California Coach Lynn Waldorf re
marked he would like to see the two
teams meet again this coming week
end.
"California is the finest team
we've played this season," Cravath
told the Southern California Foot
ball Writers' Association. "They
are far better than Rice or Ohio
State."
CRAVATH WARNS liERT
Cravath warned Coach Bert La-
Brucherie that his UCLA Bruins are
in for some touble when they tangle
with California here next Saturday.
He also expected a rough afternoon
in meeting Washington at Seattle.
If anything, Cravath said, Califor
nia was keyed at too high a fever
pitch for the game, and after they
ran the first scrimmage play to a
touchdown they may have relaxed
a little, giving the Trojans a chance
to get rolling, he added.
But despite the victory, Cravath
refused to call his team the best in
the world or the nation or even to
compare it with outstanding teams
coached a Souhorn California by the
late Howard Jones.
"They have fine spirit and ambi
tion," he said. "The boys play hard
and with a fairly good line and a
somewhat fast back field, we've been
able to win a few games. I don't
know how long we can keep on
winning. That remains to be seen.
BEARS TAPE HANDS
Asked if he had protested against
the first three California teams com
ing into the game with their hands
taped, Cravath drily said he had not.
He pointed out that the rules pro
vide hand injuries may be taped
and he assumed California had a
lot of men with hurt hands.
"It was a matter i*or the referee
to determine. I guess he was satis
fied they all had hurt their hands
because he let them play with the
bandages. Besides, I don't think
anything like that wins or loses a
ball game," Cravath commented.
I'CLA PLAYS BEST GAME
Coach Laßrucherie said his UC
LA team played its best game of
the season in losing 0-7 to Southern
Methodist and he felt they should
have won except for unexpected
bobbles. Although the Mustangs'
great back, Doak Walker, was bot
tled up most of the afternoon, La-
Brucherie termed him a great half
back and dangerous every time he
got the ball.
