Kappa Alpha's volleyball experts
i took two games in a row from the
Fiji team on the local courts yes
terday afternoon. Spectacular net
play by lanky Curt Tarr and high
! serves by Dave Milton proved to be
i the margin of victory for the KA's,
l who won the first game 15 to 8 and
came from behind to win the hard
fought second game 15 to 11. Dick
Bartle and Dick Robertson turned
in good performances for the win-
I ners.
Beta Thety Pi had little trouble in
J drubbing the Theta Xi's in two suc
| cessive games, with A 1 Robbins,
I Tom Winters, Bob Davis, and Fred
Ten Eyck making some neat "spike"
I shots. Starring for the losers were
j Jack Voogte, Bob Mills, Dick Remy,
and Bob Peck. The Betas won the
j first game 15 to 5 and took the sec
ond 15 to 8.
In a scheduled evening contest
