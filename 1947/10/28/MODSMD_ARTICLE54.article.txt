# Slippery Rock Knocked Off Perfect List
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 27 (UP).—Only
31 college football teams were
around to answer the roll call on the
! perfect record list tonight and the 13
absentees from last week's list were
not playing hookey either—they just
weren't members in good standing
any more.
Gone was good old Slippery Rock,
Pa.. Teachers —but so were tbe Cali
fornia Bears, who until they cracked
up against the truckin' Trojans of
Southern California were hailed as
the West's new wonder team.
Still leading the way among the
nation's major elevens were Texas,
Notre Dame, Michigan, Penn State,
Southern Methodist, Georgia Tech,
Virginia, and Utah, and not neces
sarily in that order either.
Although all of these big fellows
survived, none except Georgia Tech
got by with any particular ease, and
the Engineers had the next best
thing to a day off since they breathed
past the Citadel. Texas was shaky
in topping Rice, Notre Dame either
was operating in low gear or had
underestimated lowa, Michigan had
the dickens of a time beating Min
nesota, Southern Methodist just
squeezed past UCLA in the last pe
riod. and Utah was tioubled at times
against Wyoming.
Along with these powerhouses
were the proud little toughies, the
dauntless Dusties from Ellendale,
N.D., Normal, the busy Blue Raiders
from Middle Tennessee State Col
lege of Murfreesboro with their all-
Irish coach Charley Murphy, and
dashing Denison of Granville, 0..
about whom a fan writes "This is a
big time small college team in the
same class with Muhlenberg, Le
high, and Lafayette."
The Midwest still led with perfect
record teams showing a total of 13.
The East was second with seven,
there were four in the South, four
in the Southwest, two on the Pa
cific Coast, and one in the Rocky
Mountains.
