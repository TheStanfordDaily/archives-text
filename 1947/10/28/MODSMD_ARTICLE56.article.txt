Although it's still early in the
season and the boxing team's first
match isn't scheduled until Janu
ary, the Stanford boxers are slowly
rounding into shape according to
coach Ray Lunney.
Fifteen men turned out for the
varsity team, Lunney said, and seven
| of the men earned letters in boxing
I last year.
"However, we are lacking men in
the bantam (125 pounds), feather
1 (130 pounds) and lightweight (135
; pounds) classes," Lunney added.
I "We need men in all these divisions
and if anyone with experience in
these weight classes comes out for
the team, he certainly will be wel
come."
The returning lettermen are light
heavyweights Elia Long, Joe Cran
mer, and Bill Edwards, middle
weights Fred Ten Eyck and Erwin
Rosa, senior wei'&rweigfyt Willie
Altus, and welterweight Pete Wil
let.
Long was undefeated last year,
winning most of his bouts via the
technical knockout route. He has
been tabbed by Lunney as "prob
ably the team's top boxer and one
of the potentially great lightweights
in collegiate circles today." Altus
also sported an undefeated record
j last year.
The new Stanford boxing coach
also announced that there were sev
( cral other boys who have shown
promise thus far. He classed Dick
Stanton, Orin Rush, Dick Hoffman,
j and Kent Osmon in this category.
