# Stanford Begins Prep For Oregon Stale Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's chances against Oregon State this coming week
end slightly but noticeably staried on the upswing yesterday,
with the announcement that the long black injury list which has
plagued the Indians through lour games this season may be lop
ped off near the top.
Marty Feldman, Aub Devine, and Ken Peck, all of whom

missed last weekend's northern trip,
are expected to round back into a
semblance of shape during the week.
Injured in the Husky game were
guard Bob Rohrer, half Wayne
Erickson, and center Dick Fiat land.
FLATLAND ANKLE READY
Flatland, who suffered a recur
rence of an old ankle injury, should
be ready to go by the end of the
week. And it is hoped Erickson's
shoulder hurt may mend and allow
him to get into the game.
Chief switch in yesterday's prac
tice session was the moving of Ted
Burke from end to right tackle,
which may help bolster the sagging
Indian line.
OSU COMES BACK
Oregon State, after losing their
season's opener to an underdog Utah
team, came back on following Sat
urdays to romp over Washington and
Idaho. The Beavers then lost to the
University of Southern California,
and last week handily downed Port
land University, 47 to 0.
