Stanfod students will be able to
reap three times as much benefit
from its international program than
was thought possible only a few
weeks ago when the National Stu
dents Association is ratified here,
Ginny Titus predicted last night.
Miss Titus, a member of NSA ex
ecutive council for California, Ne
vada, and Hawaii will bring up NSA
for final ratification by Excom this
Wednesday night. NSA status here
is provisional. Final okay depends
upon the report of the Stanford
delegation to last weekend's regional
conference.
MARTZLOFF PRO NSA
Student body president, Tom
Martzloff, has gone on record as
fayoring NSA's approval at Stanford.
"Shorty Grannis and Bill Fairer
came back from their trip to Eur
ope last summer with three concrete
proposals," Miss Titus said. "But
Stanford could have-supported only
one because of limitations of funds,
personnel and interest.
"But with the NSA International
Commission located at Stanford and
with the help of about 40 other
schools along the coast, Stanford will
be able to lead and gain from all
three."
UNANIMOUS APPROVAL
The three major projects that
Fairer and Grannis recommended
were accepted unanimously at the
NSA regional convention tost week
end.
They are:
(1) an educational project in Eur
ope staffed by American professors—
along the lines of Harvard's Salzburg
project.
(2) An exchange scholarship pro
gram under which a large number of
foreign students will be able to study
in schools on the Pacific slope. By
getting schools to waive tuition fees
and living groups to undertake room
and board for visitors, NSA hopes
to cut expenses sharply and extend
the program greatly.
CUT-RATE TRAVEL
(3) A centralized organization to
provide information and cut-rate
travel facilities for students who
will travel to Europe next summer.
This will eflcet a mass exodus to
Europe next summer, Miss Titus
hopes.
"Now we have proved that send
ing Shorty and Bill to Europe last
summer has paid off," Miss Titus
said.
"The information and proposals
they iorought back have resulted in a
sweeping program with at least 40
schools behind it."

(1) an educational project in Eur
ope staffed by American professors—
along the lines of Harvard's Salzburg
project.
(2) An exchange scholarship pro
gram under which a large number of
foreign students will be able to study
in schools on the Pacific slope. By
getting schools to waive tuition fees
and living groups to undertake room
and board for visitors, NSA hopes
to cut expenses sharply and extend
the program greatly.
CUT-RATE TRAVEL
(3) A centralized organization to
provide information and cut-rate
travel facilities for students who
will travel to Europe next summer.
This will eflcet a mass exodus to
Europe next summer, Miss Titus
hopes.
"Now we have proved that send
ing Shorty and Bill to Europe last
summer has paid off," Miss Titus
said.
"The information and proposals
they iorought back have resulted in a
sweeping program with at least 40
schools behind it."
Stanfod students will be able to
reap three times as much benefit
from its international program than
was thought possible only a few
weeks ago when the National Stu
dents Association is ratified here,
Ginny Titus predicted last night.
Miss Titus, a member of NSA ex
ecutive council for California, Ne
vada, and Hawaii will bring up NSA
for final ratification by Excom this
Wednesday night. NSA status here
is provisional. Final okay depends
upon the report of the Stanford
delegation to last weekend's regional
conference.
MARTZLOFF PRO NSA
Student body president, Tom
Martzloff, has gone on record as
fayoring NSA's approval at Stanford.
"Shorty Grannis and Bill Fairer
came back from their trip to Eur
ope last summer with three concrete
proposals," Miss Titus said. "But
Stanford could have-supported only
one because of limitations of funds,
personnel and interest.
"But with the NSA International
Commission located at Stanford and
with the help of about 40 other
schools along the coast, Stanford will
be able to lead and gain from all
three."
UNANIMOUS APPROVAL
The three major projects that
Fairer and Grannis recommended
were accepted unanimously at the
NSA regional convention tost week
end.
They are:
(1) an educational project in Eur
ope staffed by American professors—
along the lines of Harvard's Salzburg
project.
(2) An exchange scholarship pro
gram under which a large number of
foreign students will be able to study
in schools on the Pacific slope. By
getting schools to waive tuition fees
and living groups to undertake room
and board for visitors, NSA hopes
to cut expenses sharply and extend
the program greatly.
