# UC and Stanford Agreed

Ever since the rivalry between the Farm and
Cal developed there have bepn "raids" on
bonfires, for paint jobs, for retaliation, to regain
the Axe, particularly around Big Game time.
On the surface these things are a part of
college life, harmless if rather sophomorish.
They create "spirit" and uphold the traditional
rivalry.
This is only on the surface. In 1936 Stanford
freshmen painted the big "C." A sophomore
"guard" was injured. And a near disaster was
averted when threats to call off the Big Game
dampened the enthusiasm of a California re
taliatory cavalcade of mass proportions.
With an eye for future Big Games and the
maintenance of a fair and sportsmanlike atti
tude between the two schools the respective

student body presidents signed an intercol
legiate agreement and the following statement
was incorporated into the by-laws of the
ASSU constitution.
"As a result of the existing intercollegiate
agreement between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, any disturbance, any act of
vandalism, and defacement of property on the
University of California campus, by Stanford
students, is prohibited and may be punished
by expulsion from the University for the quar
ter in which the act occurs, or by such other
disciplinary measures on which the appropri
ate Councils for Student Control may decide."
Then, as now, Big Games were won in Cali
fornia Memorial Stadium, or in the Stanford
stadium, not at the Big "C."â€”M.H.
