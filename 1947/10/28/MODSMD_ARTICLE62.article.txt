### BIPAN CHANDRA 
More than three weeks have passed since Bill
Farrer and Lawrence Grannis returned from Europe
and started reporting their findings to the Stanford
student body. In this time they have talked to most
of the interested students.
In my opinion it is high time we started to analyze
the results of their visit. A student has already
voiced his disapproval and dissatisfaction of their
visit in The Daily campus opinion. Has their visit
really produced no results?
We sent Farrer and Grannis to Europe to find
about its material and intellectual condition; we sont
them so that Americans and Europeans may be drawn
nearer. They spent ten weeks in two different parts
of Europe meeting and talking to all sorts of Euro
peans. Most of the things they learned might have
been learned through books and newspapers, but
they got a first hand account of what was happening
in Europe. This they have faithfully relayed to the
Stanford student body through The Daily, public
lectures, and private contact.
The food situation as it exists in Europe was very
vividly related by them in a talk they gave in the
Cubberley Auditorium a few days back. They have
also described the political situation of Europe as they
saw it to any student who took care to listen to them.
The question whether their visit has been a suc
cess or a failure depends on the Stanford students.
They were not supposed to do any miracle and they
haven't done it. If Stanford students learn anything
from what they have said and then maybe put some

action into their thoughts and schemes, the visit of
Farrer and Grannis will surely have achieved its
purpose.
One of the most important things they discovered
was the misconceptions that most of the Europeans
have about America and Americans. This, they ex
plained was mainly due' to lack of correct information
given to Europeans by American private and gov
ernmental sources. There must be more information,
they concluded.
Grannis also came out strongly in favor of Ameri
can aid to Europe. Without such aid Western
Europe might go communistic, he explained. Both
Farrer and Grannis, pleaded for a greater exchange
of students and professors between America and
Europe.
But all these measures require strong student
support. Some of these measures can be put into
operation only by the government and other agencies
over which Stanford students have no direct con
trol. To achieve some of these objectives, students
have not only got to support them but use all the
political pressure they have for the support of such
measures.
Farrer said in the Cubberley meeting that their
visit would prove to be of no use unless Stanford
backs it up with action and especially political
action. He said that students must organize po
litically in order to make their voices effective in
national and international affairs.
I agree with Farrer entirely. Farrer and Grannis
have done their part of the job; it is for us to do ours.

have not only got to support them but use all the
political pressure they have for the support of such
measures.
Farrer said in the Cubberley meeting that their
visit would prove to be of no use unless Stanford
backs it up with action and especially political
action. He said that students must organize po
litically in order to make their voices effective in
national and international affairs.
I agree with Farrer entirely. Farrer and Grannis
have done their part of the job; it is for us to do ours.
More than three weeks have passed since Bill
Farrer and Lawrence Grannis returned from Europe
and started reporting their findings to the Stanford
student body. In this time they have talked to most
of the interested students.
In my opinion it is high time we started to analyze
the results of their visit. A student has already
voiced his disapproval and dissatisfaction of their
visit in The Daily campus opinion. Has their visit
really produced no results?
We sent Farrer and Grannis to Europe to find
about its material and intellectual condition; we sont
them so that Americans and Europeans may be drawn
nearer. They spent ten weeks in two different parts
of Europe meeting and talking to all sorts of Euro
peans. Most of the things they learned might have
been learned through books and newspapers, but
they got a first hand account of what was happening
in Europe. This they have faithfully relayed to the
Stanford student body through The Daily, public
lectures, and private contact.
The food situation as it exists in Europe was very
vividly related by them in a talk they gave in the
Cubberley Auditorium a few days back. They have
also described the political situation of Europe as they
saw it to any student who took care to listen to them.
The question whether their visit has been a suc
cess or a failure depends on the Stanford students.
They were not supposed to do any miracle and they
haven't done it. If Stanford students learn anything
from what they have said and then maybe put some

action into their thoughts and schemes, the visit of
Farrer and Grannis will surely have achieved its
purpose.
One of the most important things they discovered
was the misconceptions that most of the Europeans
have about America and Americans. This, they ex
plained was mainly due' to lack of correct information
given to Europeans by American private and gov
ernmental sources. There must be more information,
they concluded.
Grannis also came out strongly in favor of Ameri
can aid to Europe. Without such aid Western
Europe might go communistic, he explained. Both
Farrer and Grannis, pleaded for a greater exchange
of students and professors between America and
Europe.
But all these measures require strong student
support. Some of these measures can be put into
operation only by the government and other agencies
over which Stanford students have no direct con
trol. To achieve some of these objectives, students
have not only got to support them but use all the
political pressure they have for the support of such
measures.
