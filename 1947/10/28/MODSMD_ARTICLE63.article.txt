Hurrah! Bravo Hardin Holmes! He took the
words right out of my mouth!

To the Editor:
A high degree of disinterest in their own affairs
was shown by the freshmen men Thursday night.
At first they fooled everyone by signing petitions
somebody shoved at them, about the early class
elections. But now it becomes evident that all the
interest in student government lies in Roblc.
The sponsors of the class of '51 arranged a meet
ing for freshmen at which many of the campus lead
ers were to explain matters of student government.
It was a fine meeting and well worth while.
The attendance reveals this political apathy. I
counted at least 125 from Roble and only about 25
from Encina, which houses three times as many.
And there was no conflicting event which could have
kept so many from the meeting. The obvious reason is
just plain lack of interest.

To the Editor:
In the midst of all this discussion of political ac
tivity. we would like to introduce a subject of interest
to all students.
Why must men pay all the expenses on dates?
Why do women insist on their own rights, yet retain
all of their former ones? Believing in equality be
tween the sexes, it is hypocritical for women to ex
pect men to pay the full cost of dating. Wouldn't it
be better if both the man and woman shared ex
penses?
In the good old days when political and economic
rights were men's exclusive province, it made sense
that they should also assume financial responsibility.
But now that women have won political and economic
freedom, they are no longer dependent on the male.
We realize that this would be a departure from
social custom, but why should such an absurd cus
tom endure?
Here at Stanford, the average girl has at least as

much money to spend as the average man, and prob
ably more. Therefore, it seems logical to us that
dates be Dutch.

Mr. Bud Kecnan didn't like the picture. The
adults in the audience did. I'm referring, of course,
to THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER and
to Mr. Keenan's review of it.
While eating up most of monthly $65 in a down
town hash-house I overheard a college freshman
describe Myrna Loy as being "intensely bovine
throughout," and words to the effect that Shirley
Temple in the last few years had become hypermam
miferous.
Well, I went to the movie in spite of the freshman
condemnation. There were a lot of college boys and
girls in the audience. They smiled at times. The
"maturity encrusted" citizens of Mr. Keenan had a
whale of a time. And, Dear Editor, I know that I
laughed.
Having attended three co-ed universities by grace
of the U.S. Navy and four on my own hook, I feel
relatively qualified to pass judgment on the typical
American undergraduate. I find him (and or her) to
be emotionally unstable, snobbish, and very very
much inclined to poke raucous fun at those things
which pierce his newly acquired armor of sophistica
tion. The B & B-S hurt, didn't it, Bud Keenan?
I knew something rang the bell, but until I'd read
your reviewer I couldn't define it. The movie was
about Stanford, of course. The producer visited the
Village and talked to some unmarried vets. Then
he talked to some saddle shoes in the Union. And
then he drove to San Francisco and talked to some
women. There he had his three principal characters,
i.e., Cary Grant, Shirley Temple, Myrna Loy.
Thanks for a sympathetic movie, Mr. Producer.
Thanks for crystallizing things, Bud.
