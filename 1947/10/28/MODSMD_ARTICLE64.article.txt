# Roble's 'Miss La', Farm Grad, Likes Directing Frosh Women
## 
### MARY LOU MORITZ 
Speak to Roble women about Miss Lucy Lataillade, director
of Roble Hall, and they might not know whom you're talking
about. But ask them about "Miss La" and they know right away.
For "Miss La" is a stickler for informality. At Roble's first
house meeting she requested that the girls call her by her nick-

name, and told them how she first <
came by it.

"A few years ago, all the girls
struggled over pronouncing my
whole name," she chuckled. "One
day a gwl was asking me a ques
tion and in saying my name, got as
far as Miss Laâ€” and could go no
further.
"I answered her question," she
continued. "Later in the conversa
tion the same thing happened again.
From then on the name spread as
such things do in a large dormitory,
and within a day, everyone was
calling me Miss La."
A Stanford graduate, "Miss La"
held the post of Roble assistant di
rector a few years ago. From here
she went to Pomona College for two
years, and in the winter of '46 she
returned to the position she now
holds.
"Miss La" is very happy with her
job at Roble, that of supervising its
three large wings and the 256 girls
who live in them. "I like having
the chance of meeting a new group
of people each year. Each class
seems better to me than the last
one.
"But," she hastened to add, "that's
just the way it seems. They've all
been superior in different respects."
She insists she's strictly impartial.
She particularly likes the idea of
all women living together their
freshman year, adding that it's not
a common practice in other uni
versities.
She emphasized her approval of
Roble's system of sponsorship. The
girls are governed by sponsors for
the first quarter and a half, and then
take over government of their own
hall themselves.
In other words, she just plain likes
Roble, and Roble girls will hasten
to assure you that the feeling is
mutual.
