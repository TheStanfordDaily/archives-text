## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 27 (UP). â€”A
Navy football scout, revealing that
Notre Dame has one major weak
ness, predicted today the undefeated
Irish will have to go, all out against
the battered Middies at Cleveland
Saturday to preserve their rating as
the No. 1 team in the nation.
The weakness, reported Ensign
Ben Martin, is in Notre Dame's run
ning attack where Coach Frank
Leahy is pressed for a "bruising
fullback who can make that three
yards a crack" when a first down is
required.
"So far, Notre Dame hasn't been
tested," Martin said. "Why, Johnny
Lujack hasn't even had his uniform
dry-cleaned so far this year. No
body has knocked him down to get
it dirty.
"There'll be some dry-cleaning
done down there this week," he
promised.
