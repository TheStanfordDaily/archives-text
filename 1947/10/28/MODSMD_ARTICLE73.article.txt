# 'New Look' Good? Bad?
## 
### 
Roble Hall lounge will be the
scene tonight of what promises to
be one of the most earnest debates
of the season as advocates of "the
new look" meet those who are op
posed to it.
John flines and Dorothy Thomas
will take their stands in favor of the
new fashion, and Dorothy will be
wearing a long dress to support her
case, according to manager John
Menzel.
Mary Lou LeVan and George
Velliotes are scheduled to present
points against the descending hem
line. Mary Lou will be wearing a
short dress to add fuel to their ar
guments, Menzel said.
Erskine Childers will be the
strictly neutral chairman. Childers
registered at Stanford from Dublin,
Ireland, and his presence will bring
an international flavor to the fo- j
rensic affair.
