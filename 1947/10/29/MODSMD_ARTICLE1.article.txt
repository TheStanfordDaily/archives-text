# 'Aggressor Must Pack Bigger Atomic Punch'

"It is doubtful if any nation or group ol nations will over again engage in
conflict until the aggressor, at least, has atomic weapon skill and believes that
he has either superior skill or strength, or sufficient stealth to render his op
ponent helpless in this matter," said Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, Stahford pro
fessor of physics on leave as director of the Los Alamos bomb project, at the
Tuesday Evening Series last night.
"I hope it is clear," said Dr. Bradbury, "that there is little distinction to the
man who is killed whether or not he is killed by a 'nice' TNT bomb or an
'uncivilized' atom bomb! This is a point sometimes overlooked by those who
wish to outlaw atomic energy but who have come to accept high explosive
weapons as just one of the cruel hazards of modern living." ,
There is no need to conceal, or to attempt to conceal, the fact that atomic
energy, up to the present time, has had primarily military significance, he
said.
Its impact upon the world arises from its potential military uses and the
Atomic Energy Commission has announced that it considers the study of the
military application of atomic energy foremost among its immediate objectives.
Up to the present time, the use of atomic energy for military purposes has

been confined exclusively to the production of enormous explosives through
the release of large amounts of energy in exceedingly small times, Dr. Brad
bury said.
The resultant effect of such explosions is to generate an expanding shock
wave in the surrounding medium, be it air, water, or ground, of extremely
high intensity.
This shock or blast interacts with objects in its path and damages, knocks
dov/n, or destroys them to a greater or less degree.
"It may also be noted," he said, "that when used as an aerial bomb, as in
the last war, a very much greater amount of energy is actually released by
the bomb than appears in the nuclear process."
This energy is essentially stored in the standing structures knocked down
by the bomb, and the potential energy of the city thus released is enormous
even in comparison with the energy of the weapon itself, he added.
"If we accept the premise that the national psychology of the United States
is strongly against deliberate aggression, we may have some hope that an
effective and vigorous program of atomic energy may actually be a vigorous
and effective defense against its ultimate use," he said.
