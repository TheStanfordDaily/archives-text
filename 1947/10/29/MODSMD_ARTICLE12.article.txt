# Spotlight Plays on Communists As Strife Shakes 'One World'
## Chiang Squelches China Democrats 
### 
NANKING, Oct. 28 (UP).—Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek out
lawed the Democratic League today
with the Communists. Leaders of
the League were arrested, and the
telephone lines of its headquarters
were cut.
A spoksman for the Central
Government said the Democratic
League was instigating a revolt in
Manchuria, arming rebels, and stir
ring up strikes—all in the interests
of the Communists.
Lih Siang-Fu, speaking for the
League, denied all these charges.
He said Chiang had been appealed
to vainly for a month to produce
evidence to support his longstand
ing charge that the League was aid
ing the Communists.
Outlawing of the Democratic
League left only two parties in
China, outside of Chiang's Kuomin
tang, that are considered legal.
These are the Young China party
and the Democratic Socialists, an
offshoot of the League.
(Mrs. Mary Wright, special rep
resentative of the Hoover Institute,
who has returned from five years
in China, told The Daily: "The
Democratic League was a harmless
and unarmed league of students.
While it opposed the war against the
Chinese Communists, the league
as not in agreement with the Com-
Communists on most issues. Chiang
Kai-shek, in order to strengthen his
dictatorship, chose to disband it be
cause it was the only effective op
position party.")


THIS IS THE BOSS. His name
is Joseph Stalin. Yesterday his
followers, according to such di
verse personalities as J. Parnell
Thomas, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles
De Gaulle, and John Foster
Dulles, brought new irritations to
world trouble spots.
