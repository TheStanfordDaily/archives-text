# Film Writers Won't Talk

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP).—
Three more big-time movie writers,
all accused of being Communist
party members, appeared before the
House Un - American Activities
Committee today and defiantly ac
cepted contempt of Congress cita
tions rather than testify whether
they have Red affiliations.
Apparently inviting a, court test
of the committee's power to inquire
into their political beliefs, Holly
wood scenarists Dalton Trumbo, Al
bert Mahz, and Alvah Bessie fol
lowed the example set, yesterday by
their colleague, John Howard Law
son, and refused to say whether
they were Communists.
The wrathful committee members
immediately introduced documen
tary evidence purporting to show
that each of the writers had held a
Communist party membership card
and was active in a wide variety of
Red front organizations.
Then they cited all three for con
tempt of Congress —as they did
Lawson yesterday—making each li
able to penalties of one year and a
$1,000 fine.
He said it was his opinion that
only the Kremlin knew—if anyone
did — when the next war would
start.
