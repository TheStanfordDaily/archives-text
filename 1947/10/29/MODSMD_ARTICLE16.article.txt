LAKE SUCCESS, NY., Oct. 28
(UP). —A Soviet-American conflict
over Korea went before the United
Nations today, with the United
States asking UN intervention and
Russia demanding that all Soviet
and American troops leave Korea
by Jan. 1.
The two major powers collided as
soon as the UN political committee
opened debate on the future of Ko
rea, which was wrested from Japan
during the war.
American Delegate John Foster
Dulles asked UN to set up a special
commission to sponsor free elections
in Korea by March 31. Only after
a Korean government is established
would Russian and American occu
pation forces leave.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
protested that UN had no business
interfering in Korea. He renewed
his proposal for American and Rus
sian troops to withdraw from Korea
by Jan. 1, leaving Koreans free to
work out their own future.
Korea is now divided into Soviet
and American occupation zones.
Under a 1945 agreement Soviet-
American officials were to arrange
a government to guide Korea to in
dependence, but have failed to
agree. The territory has developed
into a major friction point between
the two powers.
