# '8 Out of 10 Gals Have Ugly Knees and Hips'---SHE Says
## 
### 
"The New Look" reveals only the
most attractive part of the leg, from
the ankle to the calf, John Hines,
affirmative speaker, said.
"It does away with that 'burlap'
look that most women acquired
during the war," he added.
"The New Look" has a spiritual
and psychological effect on us all, he
insisted. Hines then introduced two
models from Joseph Magnin's de
partment store. They were outfit
ted in the best traditions of "The
New Look," one wearing an after
noon dress and the other an even
ing dress.
"Eight out of ten women have
ugly knees and hips out of propor

tion to the rest of their bodies," said
Dorothy Thomas speaking in favor of
"The New Look" in the Lounge of
Roble Hall last night.
"The New Look gives these women
a chance," she concluded.
Mary Lou LeVan, speaking against
the change in fashions, said that the
impression of a Navajo blanket
would be just as impressive as that
new "draped" look.
"The girl who pads *er hips a. J
corsets her waist is likely to deceive
you ; < other things as well," she
said.
"I am speaking from the standpoint
I of the objective philosopher," oppo
| sition speaker George Velliotes

said.
"There is a rumor circulating that
you women have accepted "The
New Look" because it does your
housework for you," he said.
"And thei'e is another vicious
rumor that reason isn't reason at
all—women don't have much reason.
The New Look originated in Paris
and was accepted by the French
women during the war to discourage
the German occupation," he con
cluded.
A roll call vote disclosed that
"That New Look" is here to stay,
and the proposition "Is the New Look
a Good Look?" was almost unani
mously accepted in the affirmative.

liotes wonders if long dresses will ever replace brooms. Debaters Dorothy Thomas (left) and Mary Lou
LcVan (right) look on. The models are Carle Forslew (left) and Doris Stoner (right).

"The New Look gives these women
a chance," she concluded.
Mary Lou LeVan, speaking against
the change in fashions, said that the
impression of a Navajo blanket
would be just as impressive as that
new "draped" look.
