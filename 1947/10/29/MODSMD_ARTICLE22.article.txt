# U.S. and Cohorts Send Vast Relief Supplies To Europeans, Senator Byrd Tells Congress
## 
### 
WASHNGITON, Oct. 28 (UP).—
During the past fiscal year the
United States sent food to other
nations at the rate of B.G per cent of
its total production, or the equiva
lent of 271 pounds for every man,
woman and child under the Ameri
can flag.
The stupendous role American
farmers and food-processors are
playing in feeding war-torn Europe
and Asia was revealed in a survey
made by Sen. Harry F. Byrd, D.,
Va.
It is based on figures supplied by
federal departments and agencies
and may loom large in congressional
consideration of President Truman's
emergency aid and Marshall long
t ange plans.
The greatest portion of foodstuffs
from wheat to nuts —was shipped
for civilian feeding by U.S. Army

authorities in the Anglo-American
zone in Germany, in Italy, and in
the U.S. occupation territory in Aus
tria. This total was 3,481,000 long
tons.
Other nations which followed the
American lead were:
Britain, 1,052,000 long tons; India,
1,003,000 long tons; the Latin Amer-
I ican republics, 2,322,000 long tons,
| and France, including French North
Africa, 771 long tons.
The survey did not differentiate
between those goods which passed
through the noimal channels of for
eign trade and were paid for, and
I those which were supplied as out
right relief.
Byrd's report, along with those to
be supplied congress by the Krug,
Harriman and Nour.se National Re
sources committees, will comprise
j the "facts and figures" which con

gress is expecting to use in meeting
Mr. Truman's request for new for
eign aid to meet the European dollar
shortage, help world reconstruction,
and check the processes of totali
tarian governments.
Release of the survey coincided
with these developments on the for
eign aid front:
1. Senator Robert A. Taft, R., O.,
predicted at Boston, Mass., .that
congress might take final action on
the Marshall Plan, as well as an an"-
to ci pa ted request of $1,100,000,000 for
stop-gap aid, before Dec. 19.
2. A high-ranking Senate Demo
cratic spokesman believed that con
gress would be unwilling and unable
to do much about the Marshall Plan
in the special session.
3. Tom Connally, D., Tex., ranking
minority member of the Senate
Foreign Relations committee, pre
dicted quick action on the stop-gap
bill and others forecast that congress
might trim the President's request
if it tops the $1,000,000,000 mark.
4. It was revealed that the admin
istration believes that more than
one-third of the estimated $6,000,-
000,000 needed for the Marshall Plan
in 1940 will have to be in outright
grants, rather than loans.

WASHNGITON, Oct. 28 (UP).—
During the past fiscal year the
United States sent food to other
nations at the rate of B.G per cent of
its total production, or the equiva
lent of 271 pounds for every man,
woman and child under the Ameri
can flag.
The stupendous role American
farmers and food-processors are
playing in feeding war-torn Europe
and Asia was revealed in a survey
made by Sen. Harry F. Byrd, D.,
Va.
It is based on figures supplied by
federal departments and agencies
and may loom large in congressional
consideration of President Truman's
emergency aid and Marshall long
t ange plans.
The greatest portion of foodstuffs
from wheat to nuts —was shipped
for civilian feeding by U.S. Army

authorities in the Anglo-American
zone in Germany, in Italy, and in
the U.S. occupation territory in Aus
tria. This total was 3,481,000 long
