# Conservation Program Going Well—Luckman
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 28 (UP).—
Charles Luckman, chairman of the
Citizens' Food Committee, said to
night that the food conservation pro
gram is rolling along so well he ex
pects to achieve his goal of saving
one hundred million bushels of
wheat for foreign relief by the end of
this year.
However, Luckman could not say
whether this would mean the end
of voluntary rationing and meatless
and poultryless days. That he said
is up to President Truman and his
administration.
Luckman said there would be an
announcement tonight or tomorrow
of a new organization combining the
facilities of all farm groups to work
out a unified program to help farm
ers save grain.
He emphasized that the govern
ment was protecting American in
dustries which conserve food, and
pointed to the State Department
which has asked foreign govern
ments to.stop imports into this coun
try of whiskey during the (50 days
U.S. distillers will be closed down.
