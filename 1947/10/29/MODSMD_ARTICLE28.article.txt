# Board Eliminates Disputed 'Confidential' Censorship
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28,-Presi
dent Truman's security advisory
board disclosed today that it has
shelved plans to classify as "confi
dential" any government informa
tion which, it divulged, would cause
"serious administration embarass
ment."
The proposal was dropped after
the American Society of Newspaper
Editors denounced it as a "gag rule"
and several columnists had objected
that it might be used to conceal ad
ministration errors and inefficiency.
Sot up earlier this year as part
of the president's purge of disloyal
persons on the Federal payroll, the
board was instructed among other
things to draft standards for safe
guarding "classified information"—
that which should be kept from the
public.
The security plan itself has been
classified as "confidential" and Board
Chairman Hamilton Robinson re
fused to make public all of the regu
lations. But the board, through a
government spokesman, gave a
thumb-nail description of the four
classifications covered —top secret,
secret, confidential and restricted—

and revealed changes made in re
sponse to adverse criticisms.
One amendment eliminates the
"Administration embarrassment"
phrase from the definition of "con
fidential" information.
Another drops from the "top sec
ret" classification any information
which, if revealed, might endanger
the "prestige of the nation." Such in
formation still could be classified as
"secret" or "confidential."
