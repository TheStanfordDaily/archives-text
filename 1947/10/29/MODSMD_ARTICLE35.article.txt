# Freshmen To Be Given Best Vocational Advice
## 
### 
Freshmen who are yet undecided
as to what line of work they will
study for at Stanford will receive in
formation concerning various occu
pations from specialists this winter
as the vocational guide program
starts to roll.
Assemoiies will be held at which
top men in several fields will speak
to the students and answer their
questions, according to Sam Brenner,
sponsor chairman of the program.
Arrangements will be made by a
committee which will be formed
within the next two weeks, Brenner
said. On the group beside Chair
man Brenner will be one wing presi
dent, one residential assistant and
probably two sponsors, all from En
cina.
Brenner, who was co-chairman of
the program in 194(5, stated that the
purpose of vocational guidance was
to assist the many fellows who come
to college not knowing what they
tame for and have no definite plans
for the future. "The object of the
meetings is to allow the freshmen to
gel acquainted with different fields
and to talk to experts in those fields,"
Brenner added.
Last year, first year of the pro
grain suice the war, several speak
ers talked about such subjects as
law, medicine, engineering and busi
ness. While the meetings were form
erly held in the spring, they will be
staged in mid-winter this year so
that the students may plan their
schedules further in advance, ac-
to the chairman. Vocational

guidance was initiated by a sugges
tion of the Encina council in 194(5.
In speaking on the occupations,
the lecturers will tell of the require
ments, advantages and chances for
advancement. Last spring the pro
gram was well attended by fresh
men, many of whom had already
chosen their own field but who
wanted to get acquainted with other
occupations, Brenner said.
Brenner had high praise for the
administration in the support they
gave and "will give the program."
He attributed much of the success of
