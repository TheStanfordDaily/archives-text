# Villagers Whip Encina Team, 31-0
## 
### RAY SAMUELSON 
In a game complicated by slippery
footing and a wet ball, Village 108's
Legal Eagles steamrollered over an
Enc-ina IE aggregation yesterday af
ternoon by a score of 31 to 0.
Jim Roberts proved to be the
sparkplug of the Village group by
figuring in each Village touchdown
and conversion. His unerring arm
was responsible for two paying tal
lies in (he 'first half on tosses to
Benny Favoro and Don Fretz and
a conversion to Irv Rovens.
In the first part of the second
stanza Favoro took a reverse from
Roberts to score and a few minutes
later Joe Hodges worked the same
play to push the count up to 25-0.
The final Lawyer tally was on a
heave from Roberts to Dick Al
berton.
The Encina squad was handi
capped by being forced to field a
six man squad which proved to be
too light and inexperienced for the
Village club. Dick Cameron of the
Encinamen stood out especially in
passing and running plays.
The Sigma Nu's won their filt with
Encina T>W by forfeit as did Village
312 over Encina Basement. Other
teams with games scheduled failed
to show up.
