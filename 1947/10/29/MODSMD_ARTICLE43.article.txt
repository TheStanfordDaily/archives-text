# Titus May Return For OSC Game
## 
### 
Coming back to 'he Indian lineup
for the first time since the Michigan
game, i ight halfback Mickey Titus
is expected to add his strength to
the thus far weak Stanford varsity
that meets Oregon State Saturday.
Coach Marchie Schwartz said he j
intended to use the chunky blonde j
in either a fullback or a halfback j
role. Four weeks ago Titus, after ,
| playing ;a great defensive game
J against Michigan, failed to recover
! rapidly from a knee iniury. Yester
j dav he looked faster in practice than !
I at any time since the injury and
looks ready for the Beaver scrap at
; the Farm stadium.
On the unlikely list for the con
\ lest is left half Wayne Erickson.
i He and guard Bob Rohrer are suf
fering from shoulder injuries that
] only time can heal. Their chances
of playing are practically nil.
DURKET AT QUARTERBACK
Mike Durket steps out of his fa
j miliar kicking role to assume a big
ger duty this weekend. He will get
the call from Coach Schwartz to
share the offensive quarterback spot
with Ainslee Bell and A 1 Morris.
: Mike was some shucks as a passer
when he attended Santa Monica
Junior College and depending upon
his showing in practice this week
he will be given a chance to move up
the ladder.
No scrimmage has been scheduled
for the remainder of the week al
though a defensive scrimmage
against Oregon State plays may
j take place tomorrow afternoon.
{ Those in better shape will also par
! ticipate in a live tackling session.
QUIST CAPTAIN SATURDAY
Movies of the Washington game
j shown yesterday afternoon gave an
other uncomfortable hour to Messrs.
] Schwartz, Bengston, Hammett and
j Elward, but it also revealed some
i good play by ends Mervin, Martin
and Crahan. Whit Budge, the big
tackle, showed up well and of course
linebacker George Quist.
Quist, by the way, will captain
the Saturday game.
Quist was % also captain for the
Michigan game although he didn't
play.
