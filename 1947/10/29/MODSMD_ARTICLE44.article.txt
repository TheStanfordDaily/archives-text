# Seattle Wolves Howl For Huskies' Coach
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
(Editor's note: George Newell,
Daily sporlswriter, made the
Washington trip last week with
Stanford's football team. Besides
covering the game, he investigated
the persistent rumors that Ralph
"Pest" Welch. Iluskie head coach,
is on the way out.)

It looks as if that's all for "Pest"
Welch.
For 18 years now the big six foot
four inch genial Ralph Welch has
directed the fortunes of University
of Washington athletic teams. Today
his name is "box office poison" in
Seattle. They're after "Pest." They
want a winner in Washington.
How do you go about getting rid
of a coach? On Saturday morning I
went out to the Washington campus
to find out. What 1 saw and what
I heard turned my stomach.
HOW THEY ATTACK WELCH
First of all you need a football
team like the Huskies. Not a team
composed of 18- or 20-year-olds but
a team composed of ex-G.l.'s that
averages something like 22 years.
In this way you can field a team that
is tired of regimentation, a team that
refuses to recognize the authority of
the coach.
Then you start a whispering cam
paign against the coach. Don't talk
about his ability. Don't mention his
six year record with 25 wins, 13
losses and 3 ties. Just circulate
rumors about "team dissension,"
"poor morale" and "non-coopera
tion." Then find a sympathetic
newspaper which likes that sort of
thing and your campaign is in full
swing.
It won't take long to convince
people. One Seattle paper with
large circulation jumped on the "Get
Welch" bandwagon right away. One
of its sportwriters devoted a whole
column to "the trouble on the cam
pus." In its late edition the day be
fore the Stanford game, this paper
ran three one-column pictures, one
above the other. They were titled,
"The Coaching Cycle." Nothing
more. Just three words but the

reader would have to be a moron
| not to get the "subtle hint.'
NO CONCRETE FACTS
In talking to students, local mer
chants and Washington alumni I
could bring out no concrete facts
about "the trouble." One merchant
near the campus on University Road
told me he didn't like Welch "be
cause he is not colorful." Did he
know anything about football? No,
but he thought a coach should have
personality to run a team.
A group of students in a local cof
fee shop admitted "the team has a
lot of priina-donnas" but they in
sisted Welch should be able to solve
the problem. How? They didn't
know but they were sure a new
j coach could do it.
Among the alumni the story was
the same. Whoever wants Welch out
has circulated his "poison" well.
Talk has even gotten to the point
where alumni are saying openly,
"It's time for a change!"
INTO THE OPEN?
From what I gathered the "whis
pering campaign" is almost ready to
come out into the open. How long
Welch can last is hard to say. The
Stanford victory was a repreive. If
he can get over USC, and what s an
"if" that is, he might, last out this
j year and maybe next.
Whatever happens the skids have
been applied.

"poor morale" and "non-coopera
tion." Then find a sympathetic
newspaper which likes that sort of
thing and your campaign is in full
swing.
It won't take long to convince
people. One Seattle paper with
large circulation jumped on the "Get
Welch" bandwagon right away. One
of its sportwriters devoted a whole
column to "the trouble on the cam
pus." In its late edition the day be
fore the Stanford game, this paper
ran three one-column pictures, one
above the other. They were titled,
"The Coaching Cycle." Nothing
more. Just three words but the

reader would have to be a moron
| not to get the "subtle hint.'
NO CONCRETE FACTS
In talking to students, local mer
chants and Washington alumni I
could bring out no concrete facts
about "the trouble." One merchant
near the campus on University Road
told me he didn't like Welch "be
cause he is not colorful." Did he
know anything about football? No,
but he thought a coach should have
personality to run a team.
A group of students in a local cof
fee shop admitted "the team has a
lot of priina-donnas" but they in
sisted Welch should be able to solve
the problem. How? They didn't
know but they were sure a new
j coach could do it.
Among the alumni the story was
the same. Whoever wants Welch out
has circulated his "poison" well.
Talk has even gotten to the point
where alumni are saying openly,
"It's time for a change!"
INTO THE OPEN?
From what I gathered the "whis
pering campaign" is almost ready to
come out into the open. How long
Welch can last is hard to say. The
Stanford victory was a repreive. If
he can get over USC, and what s an
"if" that is, he might, last out this
j year and maybe next.
Whatever happens the skids have
been applied.
(Editor's note: George Newell,
Daily sporlswriter, made the
Washington trip last week with
Stanford's football team. Besides
covering the game, he investigated
the persistent rumors that Ralph
"Pest" Welch. Iluskie head coach,
is on the way out.)

It looks as if that's all for "Pest"
Welch.
For 18 years now the big six foot
four inch genial Ralph Welch has
directed the fortunes of University
of Washington athletic teams. Today
his name is "box office poison" in
Seattle. They're after "Pest." They
want a winner in Washington.
How do you go about getting rid
of a coach? On Saturday morning I
went out to the Washington campus
to find out. What 1 saw and what
I heard turned my stomach.
HOW THEY ATTACK WELCH
First of all you need a football
team like the Huskies. Not a team
composed of 18- or 20-year-olds but
a team composed of ex-G.l.'s that
averages something like 22 years.
In this way you can field a team that
is tired of regimentation, a team that
refuses to recognize the authority of
the coach.
Then you start a whispering cam
paign against the coach. Don't talk
about his ability. Don't mention his
six year record with 25 wins, 13
losses and 3 ties. Just circulate
rumors about "team dissension,"
"poor morale" and "non-coopera
tion." Then find a sympathetic
newspaper which likes that sort of
thing and your campaign is in full
