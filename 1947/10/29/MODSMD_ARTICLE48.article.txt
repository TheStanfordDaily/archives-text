# A 						Study of Life at Berkeley
## 
### 
Yesterday two representatives of The
Daily—Feature Editor John Averill and Night
Editor Paula Nusser—visited the University
of California campus gathering, material for a
special UC feature page which The Daily will
run soon.
Among the items which were investigated
on the Berkeley campus were student gov
ernment, various organizations similar to ones
we have at Stanford, the student union, UC

publications, and generally those campus
groups in which Stanford students would be
interested.
The free exchange of ideas between schools
should be advanced at all times. Through a
knowledge of what the students of other uni
versities are doing there will develop a greater
appreciation of those schools.
Be looking forward to this special page on
the University of California. There will be
items that will interest every Stanford student.
