The only thing as cheap today as it was in 1932 is
advice, so at absolutely no cost I'm dropping this
priceless bon mot in your midst.
No matter where you are living now, be happy
with it, on account of no matter where you move to
chances are it will be worse. You might even get
stuck with a deal like I've got.
I'm commuting to and from school each day.
Commuting—that means you take the wheel. I drove
the last 100 miles. A little later in the California
season it means you row for a while and let me bail
out the boat.
I'm so far away that I make the first 10 miles by
dog sled.
I had to get that far away from campus to find a
landlady who would let me keep girls in the house. I
told her I was a Stanford medical student, and the
women were for biological experimentation.
This landlady of mine has one of those California
rhythm houses—you know—swing and shake in our
next earthquake. The place is so old that every
time a truck rolls by the termites in the basement
form a ring and hold hands to keep the joint from
falling down.
1 use my room as a combination living quarters

unci office. It's so small that every time I return the
carriage on my typewriter it knocks the plaster off
the south wall. As a matter of fact, my room is so
small the mice commute from Alviso by Greyhound.
The only mouse that has lived there full time is
stunted.
In most boarding houses the guests try to get their
name on the door. I'm still trying to get a door. I
don't really mind, I just wish the parents would keep
their kids out of the hallway. A girl had the room
before I did, but she left when she found out the
landlady was charging admission.
And the meals are atrocious. Last night every
thing was cold but the ice cream, and when I found
a fly in that, the landlady remarked:
"Good—let the son-of-a-gun freeze to death. He
was in the salad last night."
Seems I get the worst of everything from the
landlady. I tried to make an impression by remem
bering her unusual name which is Hummuck. I kept
repeating to myself, Mrs. Hummuck fills my stomach,
Mrs. Hummuck fills my stomach. I don't think she
liked being called Kelly.
At any rate I'm being moved out, so if you hear
of a tent for rent or a couple of rooms with ad
joining towel, let me know.
