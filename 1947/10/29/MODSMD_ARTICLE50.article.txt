# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To the Editor:
Our campus disgrace, the Basketball Pavilion,
opened its season with the Shaw dancers Friday
night. As usual, the pavilion was hot, fetid, and
gamey. To say nothing of overcrowded. And un
comfortable.
It would seem that the expenditure of a rela
tively small sum should go a long way toward im
proving the ventilation. What we need, of course, is
a new, adequate pavilion. But lacking this, can't we
make a few improvements to relieve these major
discomforts?
James G. Cooper, 111.
To the Editor:
There are at least eighty-eight people at Stan
ford University who like the Stanford Band. But
those eighty-eight, the musicians and instrument
carriers in the Band, have been laboring under ser
ious misconceptions. Not until we read Monday's
Daily were we conscious of the "mounting roar of
disapproval" under which we worked. Strangely
enough, band members cling to the obviously out
moded notion that band music generates spirit and
that football fans even enjoy watching and hearing
bands at halftime. Last week when some members
of Rally Com openly praised the performance at the
UCLA game, I thought that the last active opposi
tion to the Band had ended. How wrong I was!
There were some errors in the Monday
and there was some amazing reading. I conclude that
the editor did not attend the UCLA game. The UCLA
band was NOT on the field at the beginning of the
second half: as do all visiting bands, they appeared on
the field first. If anyone was to blame it was the
Stanford Band, but I cannot recall being waved off
the field by officials to a chorus of boos.
The Daily editor proposes that each band parade
for eight minutes. The resulting sixteen minute per
iod would require one band to march through the
(irst two scrimmage plays of the third quarter.
Dick Bartle
To the Editor:
There is no reason why the administration of this
university, or its student body government, should
allow any group engaged in political or other activity,
which is out of sympathy with the principles of
Americanism under which the university was found
ed, to exist on its campus.
I am sure that the members of Excom, with the
expenditure of considerable time and effort, will soon
bo able to formulate policies governing partisan po
litical groups in its domain, which will not only
guarantee the preservation of the principles men
tioned above, but will also guarantee freedom of po
litical action to the members of the student body.
Excom is to be complimented on its expedient
action in the recent crisis brought about by the so
called "Progressive Citizens of America." However,
it was an action of expedience, and the time has
row come to broaden this action into an enlightened
policy supporting the principles of Americanism, the
most important of which is perhaps that guaranteeing

complete freedom of thought, speech, and action to
every American. Only by vigorously seeking to pre
serve and perpetuate this principle can the now
rampant "political licentiousness," which threatens
to overthrow the American System today, be com
pletely annihilated.
Stanford University cannot allow any threat to
be made to the ideals and prccepts of American Re
publicanism (or Democracy, call it what you will)
under which it was established, and under which it
has flourished, for more than half a century. "Die
Luft der Freiheit Weiht."

To the Editor:
Now, about AVC and Henry Wallace.
It was established by The Daily last spring that
no one had attempted to arrange an address by Mr.
Wallace. There was some speculation as to adminis
tration approval of such a speech. The administra
tion answer was no.
Neither the AVC chapter nor any of the members
with the knowledge or approval of the chapter were
connected with this issue.
Preston Burchard, vice-chairman,
Stanford chapter, AVC
To the Editor:
Why is it that any political organization not dis
tinctly old-line Democratic or Republican is now
termed Communistic? And why pursue the general
American Red-baiting activities on our campus?
From my one attendance at a PC A meeting, I gath
ered that the policies of the PCA are semi-Socialistic,
and Socialism is a far cry from Communism. Is the
administration really trying to keep partisan politics
off the Farm, or is it afraid of a Congressional in
vestigation?
Ferdinand Morton
To the Editor:
The address of the former Polish ambassador,
Jan Ciechanowski, demonstrates that not all parti
sanship has been banned from the Stanford campus.
Can we expect that the Tuesday Evening Series will
present another authoritative speaker witht a differ
ent perspective on international problems? Or, is
the middle ground of inquiry and discussion in
danger at Stanford? (That the rational, objective
approach has not disappeared altogether is proved
many times in The Daily and in the reports of
Farrer and Grannis.)
Is it mere redundance to suggest that the search
for truth may be threatened from the Right as well
as from the Left? As Mr. Holmes mentioned in last
Thursday's Daily, exposure to one point of view may
produce conditioning but not education. Without
freedom and opportunity to explore all aspects of
vital issues students may be forced into extremism.
If that shift is brought about, if the habit of action
based on wide knowledge is broken, not only a
great American ideal but America's promise to a
divided woild will be lost.

ford University who like the Stanford Band. But
those eighty-eight, the musicians and instrument
carriers in the Band, have been laboring under ser
ious misconceptions. Not until we read Monday's
Daily were we conscious of the "mounting roar of
disapproval" under which we worked. Strangely
enough, band members cling to the obviously out
moded notion that band music generates spirit and
that football fans even enjoy watching and hearing
bands at halftime. Last week when some members
of Rally Com openly praised the performance at the
UCLA game, I thought that the last active opposi
tion to the Band had ended. How wrong I was!
There were some errors in the Monday
and there was some amazing reading. I conclude that
the editor did not attend the UCLA game. The UCLA
band was NOT on the field at the beginning of the
second half: as do all visiting bands, they appeared on
the field first. If anyone was to blame it was the
Stanford Band, but I cannot recall being waved off
the field by officials to a chorus of boos.
The Daily editor proposes that each band parade
for eight minutes. The resulting sixteen minute per
iod would require one band to march through the
(irst two scrimmage plays of the third quarter.

To the Editor:
There is no reason why the administration of this
university, or its student body government, should
allow any group engaged in political or other activity,
which is out of sympathy with the principles of
Americanism under which the university was found
ed, to exist on its campus.
I am sure that the members of Excom, with the
expenditure of considerable time and effort, will soon
bo able to formulate policies governing partisan po
litical groups in its domain, which will not only
guarantee the preservation of the principles men
tioned above, but will also guarantee freedom of po
litical action to the members of the student body.
Excom is to be complimented on its expedient
action in the recent crisis brought about by the so
called "Progressive Citizens of America." However,
it was an action of expedience, and the time has
row come to broaden this action into an enlightened
policy supporting the principles of Americanism, the
most important of which is perhaps that guaranteeing

complete freedom of thought, speech, and action to
every American. Only by vigorously seeking to pre
serve and perpetuate this principle can the now
rampant "political licentiousness," which threatens
to overthrow the American System today, be com
pletely annihilated.
Stanford University cannot allow any threat to
be made to the ideals and prccepts of American Re
publicanism (or Democracy, call it what you will)
under which it was established, and under which it
has flourished, for more than half a century. "Die

Now, about AVC and Henry Wallace.
It was established by The Daily last spring that
no one had attempted to arrange an address by Mr.
Wallace. There was some speculation as to adminis
tration approval of such a speech. The administra
tion answer was no.
Neither the AVC chapter nor any of the members
with the knowledge or approval of the chapter were
connected with this issue.

Why is it that any political organization not dis
tinctly old-line Democratic or Republican is now
termed Communistic? And why pursue the general
American Red-baiting activities on our campus?
From my one attendance at a PC A meeting, I gath
ered that the policies of the PCA are semi-Socialistic,
and Socialism is a far cry from Communism. Is the
administration really trying to keep partisan politics
off the Farm, or is it afraid of a Congressional in
vestigation?

To the Editor:
The address of the former Polish ambassador,
Jan Ciechanowski, demonstrates that not all parti
sanship has been banned from the Stanford campus.
Can we expect that the Tuesday Evening Series will
present another authoritative speaker witht a differ
ent perspective on international problems? Or, is
the middle ground of inquiry and discussion in
danger at Stanford? (That the rational, objective
approach has not disappeared altogether is proved
many times in The Daily and in the reports of
Farrer and Grannis.)
Is it mere redundance to suggest that the search
for truth may be threatened from the Right as well
as from the Left? As Mr. Holmes mentioned in last
Thursday's Daily, exposure to one point of view may
produce conditioning but not education. Without
freedom and opportunity to explore all aspects of
vital issues students may be forced into extremism.
If that shift is brought about, if the habit of action
based on wide knowledge is broken, not only a
great American ideal but America's promise to a
divided woild will be lost.

Our campus disgrace, the Basketball Pavilion,
opened its season with the Shaw dancers Friday
night. As usual, the pavilion was hot, fetid, and
gamey. To say nothing of overcrowded. And un
comfortable.
It would seem that the expenditure of a rela
tively small sum should go a long way toward im
proving the ventilation. What we need, of course, is
a new, adequate pavilion. But lacking this, can't we
make a few improvements to relieve these major
discomforts?

There were some errors in the Monday
and there was some amazing reading. I conclude that
the editor did not attend the UCLA game. The UCLA
band was NOT on the field at the beginning of the
second half: as do all visiting bands, they appeared on
the field first. If anyone was to blame it was the
Stanford Band, but I cannot recall being waved off
the field by officials to a chorus of boos.
The Daily editor proposes that each band parade
for eight minutes. The resulting sixteen minute per
iod would require one band to march through the
(irst two scrimmage plays of the third quarter.

To the Editor:
There is no reason why the administration of this
university, or its student body government, should
allow any group engaged in political or other activity,
which is out of sympathy with the principles of
Americanism under which the university was found
ed, to exist on its campus.
I am sure that the members of Excom, with the
expenditure of considerable time and effort, will soon
bo able to formulate policies governing partisan po
litical groups in its domain, which will not only
guarantee the preservation of the principles men
tioned above, but will also guarantee freedom of po
litical action to the members of the student body.
Excom is to be complimented on its expedient
action in the recent crisis brought about by the so
called "Progressive Citizens of America." However,
it was an action of expedience, and the time has
row come to broaden this action into an enlightened
policy supporting the principles of Americanism, the
most important of which is perhaps that guaranteeing

complete freedom of thought, speech, and action to
every American. Only by vigorously seeking to pre
serve and perpetuate this principle can the now
rampant "political licentiousness," which threatens
to overthrow the American System today, be com
pletely annihilated.
Stanford University cannot allow any threat to
be made to the ideals and prccepts of American Re
publicanism (or Democracy, call it what you will)
under which it was established, and under which it
has flourished, for more than half a century. "Die

Now, about AVC and Henry Wallace.
It was established by The Daily last spring that
no one had attempted to arrange an address by Mr.
Wallace. There was some speculation as to adminis
tration approval of such a speech. The administra
tion answer was no.
Neither the AVC chapter nor any of the members
with the knowledge or approval of the chapter were
connected with this issue.

To the Editor:
Why is it that any political organization not dis
tinctly old-line Democratic or Republican is now
termed Communistic? And why pursue the general
American Red-baiting activities on our campus?
From my one attendance at a PC A meeting, I gath
ered that the policies of the PCA are semi-Socialistic,
and Socialism is a far cry from Communism. Is the
administration really trying to keep partisan politics
off the Farm, or is it afraid of a Congressional in
vestigation?
Ferdinand Morton
To the Editor:
The address of the former Polish ambassador,
Jan Ciechanowski, demonstrates that not all parti
sanship has been banned from the Stanford campus.
Can we expect that the Tuesday Evening Series will
present another authoritative speaker witht a differ
ent perspective on international problems? Or, is
the middle ground of inquiry and discussion in
danger at Stanford? (That the rational, objective
approach has not disappeared altogether is proved
many times in The Daily and in the reports of
Farrer and Grannis.)
Is it mere redundance to suggest that the search
for truth may be threatened from the Right as well
as from the Left? As Mr. Holmes mentioned in last
Thursday's Daily, exposure to one point of view may
produce conditioning but not education. Without
freedom and opportunity to explore all aspects of
vital issues students may be forced into extremism.
If that shift is brought about, if the habit of action
based on wide knowledge is broken, not only a
great American ideal but America's promise to a
divided woild will be lost.

Our campus disgrace, the Basketball Pavilion,
opened its season with the Shaw dancers Friday
night. As usual, the pavilion was hot, fetid, and
gamey. To say nothing of overcrowded. And un
comfortable.
It would seem that the expenditure of a rela
tively small sum should go a long way toward im
proving the ventilation. What we need, of course, is
a new, adequate pavilion. But lacking this, can't we
make a few improvements to relieve these major
discomforts?

To the Editor:
There are at least eighty-eight people at Stan
ford University who like the Stanford Band. But
those eighty-eight, the musicians and instrument
carriers in the Band, have been laboring under ser
ious misconceptions. Not until we read Monday's
Daily were we conscious of the "mounting roar of
disapproval" under which we worked. Strangely
enough, band members cling to the obviously out
moded notion that band music generates spirit and
that football fans even enjoy watching and hearing
bands at halftime. Last week when some members
of Rally Com openly praised the performance at the
UCLA game, I thought that the last active opposi
tion to the Band had ended. How wrong I was!
