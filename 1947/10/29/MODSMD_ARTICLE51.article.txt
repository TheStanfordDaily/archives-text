Hig (,<ime Float Ideas
Due to ASSU Friday
Float ideas for the Big Game
Homecoming parade must be signed
up at the ASSU office by 5 Friday
afternoon, stated Phyllis Graham,
float chairman.
Floats should follow the main
theme of the parade, "Stanford
Cavalcade." No duplications of
ideas will be allowed, said Miss
Graham, and those signing up for
their houses should check the list
to see that someone else has not
already asked for that idea. Floats
need not be fireproof unless they
are to carry fires of some sort; in
that case the fire chief should be
consulted, Miss Graham said.
