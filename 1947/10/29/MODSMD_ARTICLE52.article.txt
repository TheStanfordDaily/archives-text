# 'Foxes of Harrow' Poor Version of 'GWTW'
## 
### BUD KEENAN 
I never got around to reading
BVank Yerby's "The Foxes of Har
row" when it was a best-seller a
year ago, but the screen version of
the book looks pretty much like a
weak attempt to follow in the foot
steps of "Gone with the Wind."
There are a few interesting mo
ments in this picture, especially the
hints at discontent and rebellion
among the slaves on a Louisiana
plantation, and a beautifully photo
graphed scene of a sugar-cane crop
being salvaged in a thunderstorm.
But these elements have been sub
dued by the studio in favor of the
principal theme: the attempt by the
hero, Stephen Fox (gallantly played
by Rex Harrison), to revenge his
illegitimacy by establishing himself
as a solid member of the Creole
aristocracy in New Orleans.
PLANTATION AM) SLAVES
Due to his winning ways (espe
cially at cards) and his unconcealed
disregard for the orthodox, Fox
soon sets himself up on a fine plan
tation (Harrow} with a string of
slaves. But all this would hardly be
complete without the most ravish
ing, most unapproachable belle in

the Creole set, Lily d'Arecenceau, to
"preside over his table," as it is
coyly put in the picture.
The lady, of course, both hates
and loves Fox in true Southern
sytle, and finally marries him when
his will proves stronger than hers.
This mixture of love and hate be
comes mostly hate when he treats
her like a cad on their wedding
night. The rest of the film spends
itself waiting around until these

two proud souls can get together.
This almost happens when their
little son falls down the stairs dur
ing one of their quarrels and dies.
But when a financial panic threat
ens to ruin Harrow, they really see
eye to eye.
The cast does its best with hope
less dialogue, and Maureen O'Hara,
as Lily, continues to prove that she
is the screen's foremost interpreter
of glorified frigidity.
