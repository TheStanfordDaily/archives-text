# Europe Flight Plans Made
## UNESCO Wants Student Sign-ups 
### 
A special plane carrying Stanford
students to Europe this summer will
be chartered if 42 students sign to
travel on it, according to Lois Da
vidson, chairman of Council for
UNESCO.
The plane will cost $166 for a
one-way trip from New York to
Europe. Since the cheapest boat
travel is $165 and other plane trips
cost $320, this chartered plane will
save students both time and money.
Forty-two students are needed to
fill a plane, and 20 have already
signed up. If the demand is great
enough, two or more planes will be
chartered. This will enable different
departure dates and different desti
nations to be scheduled.
Students are asked either to con
tact Lois Davidson or sign the sheet
on the bulletin board in the Insti
tute of International Relations of
fice in the Quad shack if they wish
to ride in the plane. The office is
open daily from 2 to 4 p.m.
Since the cost of the trip will
have to be paid in full by Dec. 1,
students should have fairly definite
planÂ® before signing up. Council
for UNESCO will be unable to make
refunds.
Stanford is the first university to
arrange such a trip. While the plane
will be chartered especially for
Stanford students, students in other
colleges may be invited to join the
group.
Students will be free to go wher
ever they choose after the plane
lands in Europe.
