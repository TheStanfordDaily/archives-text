# Legal Revisions Crucial—Warren

### 
SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 29 (UP). —Governor Warren tonight
told members of a joint legislative committee to revise the state
constitution it has a "great responsibility involving great diffi
culties" in guaranteeing the people the type of government they
want.
"There was never a time that called for greater alertness and

ingenuity on our part to make dem
ocracy serve the public interest.
Our form of government today is on
trial," he said.
WARREN'S STATEMENT READ
Warren's statement was read to the
committee by Lt. Gov. Goodwin J.
Knight. The governor had planned
to attend the meeting but cancelled
his plans to fly here when weather
conditions were reported unsafe for
flying.
The governor said in his statement
that he personally would have pre
ferred the job of revising the consti
tution be done by a convention of
"delegates elected by the people for
that specific purpose."
RESPONSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC
He pointed out that the people in
J9.'!4 directed the legislature to call
a constitutional convention and that
"when the mandate of the people is
departed from, we assume an added
responsibility to protect them at all
costs from every influence that does
not square with broad public in
terest."
Warren cautioned the legislators
that "there is an underlying insist
ence" on the part of the people
"that their government keep itself
independent, alert to public need,
and prepared to meet the require
ments that are piling up for the fu
ture."
SIMPLE AND EXPRESSIVE
"Whether state government in
California will be able to keep faith
with, and squarely meet, the expec
tation of our people, depends largely
upon the content and the spirit of
its constitution," he said.
"I think we can all agree," he
said, "that the ideal would be to
make our constitution so simple that
it would be quite understandable to
our young people as they reach the
age of citizenship."
The governor warned, however,
that "whether a constitution be long
or short, clumsy or streamlined, and
whether its amendments have been
few or many, it is, nevertheless, a
solemn expression from the people
of their understanding with their
government."
GROWING CONSTITUTION
He pointed out the heart of any
constitution is its bill of rights—
"those provisions that secure to the
people their liberty of conscience,
of speech, of the press, of lawful as
sembly, and the right to uniform
application of the laws and to due
process of law."
He said above all, an approach to
constitutional revision must be made
with a view to a state that has
"grown twelvefold in population"
since the present constitution was
adopted, and "will continue to grow
from its present ten million to twenty
million, 1 am sure, within the next
few decades."
