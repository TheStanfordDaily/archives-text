##

wide at the base on each side and
40 feet in height, according to plans
drawn up by the freshman bonfire
committee.
Frosh men have been working for
over a week, stacking up a good
supply of fuel consisting of old box
es donated by a local packing plant.
Bob Levison is Cardinals member
in charge of the committee.

the large wood pile. There are truck,
arrangement, guard, recruiting, and
work committees. Each is headed
by three co-chairmen.

forget about sleep for the week to
prevent the wood from bursting into
flame prematurely, according to
Guy Schless, co-chairman of he
guard committee, who added, "This
is one of the most important fresh
man traditions, and we want every
freshman to support his class by
volunteering for guard duty."
