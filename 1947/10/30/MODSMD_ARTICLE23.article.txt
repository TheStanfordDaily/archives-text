# Chappie Girl 'Nabbed'; Fails to Identify Captors
## 
### 
By NED SACK and ALVIN BERRY
The El Cuadro Eating Club wait
ed in vain for the appearances of
Chappie Queen, and their Queen of
the Day, Marilyn Myerson. While
the eating club dabbled with the
Encina bill of fare, Miss Myerson
was enjoying the cuisine of one of
the Peninsula's better restauants.
The eating club, promising fabu
lous gifts—orchids, free meals, and
delightful companionship, had ar
ranged to escort the elusive Miss
Myerson to the Encina Commons at
6 p.m. yesterday. Shortly before 4,
however, Miss Myerson was tele
phond by someone who she believd
represented EI Cuadro. The un
identified voice changed the ap
pointment to 5:30.
At the new time, Miss Myerson
was picked up at Roble by three
"well-dressed" young men in a red
convertible. The car motor was kept
running, and the small group sped
rapidly away from the campus. Miss
Myerson stated that she thought
they were stalling for time until the
car was far from the campus and
one of her captors asked he, "Would
you be speechless if you knew we
were kidnapping you?" She said
she wouldn't be, and they sped on.
Miss Myerson described her "kid
nappers" as "wonderful." "They did
not look like Stanford men at all,"
she confessed. Her captors gave the
seemingly fictitious names of Dick
Bowers, Terry Smith, and Grunion
Schmeckenlipp.
Ralph Miller, president of El Cua
dro, announced that he considered
the evening's events a very good
joke. After presenting Miss Myer
son with a cluster of baby orchids
later in the evening, he invited the
Queen for another try on Sunday.
"We will establish a guard reminis
cent of the time when Cal stole the
Axe," Miller announced. He set the
time definitly at 5:45, and said all
jokers will be driven off.
The vivacious, green-eyed Chap
pie Queen concluded, "Everyone has
been wonderful. El Cuadro. mv un
identified companions, the Daily re
porters, and Dr. Tresldder."

The El Cuadro Eating Club wait
ed in vain for the appearances of
Chappie Queen, and their Queen of
the Day, Marilyn Myerson. While
the eating club dabbled with the
Encina bill of fare, Miss Myerson
was enjoying the cuisine of one of
the Peninsula's better restauants.
The eating club, promising fabu
lous gifts—orchids, free meals, and
delightful companionship, had ar
ranged to escort the elusive Miss
Myerson to the Encina Commons at
6 p.m. yesterday. Shortly before 4,
however, Miss Myerson was tele
phond by someone who she believd
represented EI Cuadro. The un
identified voice changed the ap
pointment to 5:30.
At the new time, Miss Myerson
was picked up at Roble by three
"well-dressed" young men in a red
convertible. The car motor was kept
running, and the small group sped
rapidly away from the campus. Miss
Myerson stated that she thought
they were stalling for time until the
car was far from the campus and
one of her captors asked he, "Would
you be speechless if you knew we
were kidnapping you?" She said
she wouldn't be, and they sped on.
Miss Myerson described her "kid
nappers" as "wonderful." "They did
not look like Stanford men at all,"
she confessed. Her captors gave the
seemingly fictitious names of Dick
Bowers, Terry Smith, and Grunion
Schmeckenlipp.
