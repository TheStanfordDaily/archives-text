# Too Many Seniors Miss Quad Dates
## 
### 
Seniors who have made photo ap
pointments for the 1048 Stanford
Quad are urgently reminded to
make every effort to appear at the
time for which they are signed up,
according to Business Manager
George Bergland. Almost half of
the students signed up for each day
have failed to appear so far, he ex
plained.
Photos will be taken in the Quad
shack, across from Geology corner,
through Nov. 7.
"We have appointments available
for only 100 students," he said.
"Anyone who will be graduated by
summer quarter of 1348, as well as
gaduate students in law, medicinc,
or business, should have a photo
graph made."
