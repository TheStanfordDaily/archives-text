Robert A. Helliwell and Laurence
A. Manning, members of the Stan
ford electrical engineering depart
ment faculty, have returned from
scientific meetings in the East.
Both read papers at the joint
meeting of the American section of
j the International Scientific Radio
i Union and the Institute of Radio
i Engineers at Washington, D.C.
Helliwell told of a pulse technique
for measuring the height of the
ionosphere, and Manning described
Stanford experiments which estab
lished that continuous-wave radio
energy in the 10-20-meter range is
reflected from the ionization trails
formed by meteors.
