# Village Restricts Bendix Machines' Use To Relieve Crowded Laundry Situation
## 
### 
Direct action on the problem of
the Village's overtaxed laundry fa
cilities was taken at Tuesday night's
meeting of the Village Family
Council.
Realizing that the crowded situ
ation at the laundry had become
virtually impossible, the group
passed on the following rules con
cerning the use of the Bendixes:
1. No one but Village residents
will be allowed to use the mafchines.
This ruling will be enforced by a
"Bendix patrol" under chairman
ship of Mrs. Patrick Dowling, Bldg.
425-7. The patrol will make daily
spot checks at the laundry and ask
outsiders to leave.
WEEKDAY WASH
2. Village housewives are asked
to wash on weekdays if possible,
leaving the weekends free for sin
gle students and working families.
3. An effort will be made to open
the laundry every evening.

4. Warnings will be placed in
Palo Alto and Menlo Park papers
to the effect that outsiders using the
Village laundry will be considered
as trespassers.
The big attraction of the Village
Bendixes is their low price. Public
self-service laundries charge from
twice to three times as much.
MACHINES USED READILY
Concerning on - campus students
using the Bendixes, Dwight Adams,
Village Director, said: "At no time
has an invitation to use the laundry
been extended to campus residents.
However, it was implied at one time
that the 'Stanford Family' would
not be thrown out. At that time
we felt that the machines were not
being used to full capacity, but
there are now 1,000 more people liv
ing in the Village than at any time
last year, and, needless to say, the
facilities are heavily overtaxed."
"Bendix machines are being

placed in mast of the single men's
dorms; at present there are 20 in
stalled—one for each house. The 32
machines at the laundry must serve
the remaining 320 single students
plus all of the families in the apart
ment area," Mr. Adams added.
The Council was also addressed
by Mis. Van Bergren of the Palo
Alto Red Cross Chapter. She told
of courses in nutrition and basic
home nursing courses being offered
by the Red Cross.

MACHINES USED READILY
Concerning on - campus students
using the Bendixes, Dwight Adams,
Village Director, said: "At no time
has an invitation to use the laundry
been extended to campus residents.
However, it was implied at one time
that the 'Stanford Family' would
not be thrown out. At that time
we felt that the machines were not
being used to full capacity, but
there are now 1,000 more people liv
ing in the Village than at any time
last year, and, needless to say, the
facilities are heavily overtaxed."
"Bendix machines are being

placed in mast of the single men's
dorms; at present there are 20 in
stalled—one for each house. The 32
machines at the laundry must serve
the remaining 320 single students
plus all of the families in the apart
ment area," Mr. Adams added.
