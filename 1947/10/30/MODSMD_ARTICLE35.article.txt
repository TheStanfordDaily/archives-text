# New Information Aids Fight On Cellar Wasps; Trap in Use
## 
### 
Some information on the
problem at the Cellar was brought
to The Daily last night by a lively,
blue-eyed lady who desired to be
known simply as "S. J. G." She was
a member of David Starr Jordan's
first Stanford class in 1891.
Her information, taken from a
Stanford University publication, "A
Contribution to the Biology of
North American Vespine Wasps,"
by Dr. Carl D. Duncan, reveals that
normally the wasps (yellowjaekets)
go into hibernation. The males all
die and the females live.
The lady asks, "Will the carefully
made 'beehive' at the Cellar Snack
Bar contribute to a deviation in the
life cycle of the pests?"

There are now by official count
15 less wasps to fall into your
apple juice and to menace your
mid-morning siesta.
El Cuadro yesterday offered to
exterminate the winged cellah
dwcllahs by constructing a bona
fide "bee trap."
Made of plywood and wire
screening, the trap lures its vic
tims by the enticing perfume of a
stale canned peach. It was sug
gested that another peach be add
ed for bait, to increase the casu
alty list.

Additional information for more
serious biology students is as fol
lows. The vespinal sub-family is
made up of yellowjackets, hornets,
and polistes wasps. Most of the spe
cies in the sub-family exhibit three
well - defined castes: males, fertile
females or queens, and infertile fe
males or workers.
Some species contain social para
sites and have no worker caste.
Queens of these species usurp es
tablished nests of other species, kill
the rightful queens, and depend on
the adopted workers to rear their
brood for them.
