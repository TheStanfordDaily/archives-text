# Guild to Open For Lawyers
## 
### 
A student chapter of the National
Lawyers' Guild, whose membership
includes Senator Claude Pepper,
Bartley Crum, and Robert Kenny,
former California Attorney General,
is in the offing for Stanford law stu
dents.
Benjamin Dreyfus, San Francisco
attorney and executive secretary for
the Guild, will speak Friday at 8
p.m. in room 100 to those students
interested.
The National Lawyers' Guild, con
trary to many national bar associa
tions, is open to any member of Ihe
Law School regardless of race, col
or, creed, or religion.
John Thome, member of the Law
School and one of the first advocates
of starting a Guild chapter at Stan
ford, said the Guild is a liberal, pro
gressive association which places
human rights above property rights.
One of its chief contentions is that
the law is a living and flexible in
strument. which must be adjusted to
the needs of the people.
Other aims of the National Law
yers' Guild are to raise professional
standards, to aid in the adoption of
laws for the economic and social
welfare of the people, and" to pro
mote world unity through collabo
ration among the bars of the mem
bers of the United Nations.
