# Chief Davis Urges Careful Parking
## 
### 
â€¢ There have been a considerable
number of parking violations re
cently, Chief of Police Gordon Davis
said yesterday. For the most part,
these were not deliberate, usually
occurring when a hurrying student,
late for class, inadvertently parked
in a reserved area or in a time limit
zone.
Chief Davis reports that the driv
ing record is good. No one has been
injured on campus so far this quar
ter.
Davis asks motorists to remember
the rules and regulations for safe
driving. The distance between any
two points on campus is short, so
only a few seconds can be saved by
bursts of speed. Often speed results
in a personal injury suit or in ex
pensive property damage, he warns.
Davis listed these simple safety
rules: stay in line, use arm signals
for stops and turns, give cyclists
and pedestrians every consideration,
drive with courtesy and good
sportsmanship. If these few rules
are observed, the school year will
end with a perfect record despite
the unprecedented numbers of pe
destrians, cyclists, and motorists on
campus, he concluded.
