It was work day for Marchie
Schwartz's Stanford gridmen yester
day on the rugby field. While Ray
Hammett and the jayvees ran
through Oregon State plays against
varsity defensive units under the
eye of Phil Bengtson, headman
Marchie Schwartz tried several
Lackfield combos on offense and
tossed in a few new plays for use
against Oregon State Saturday.
Schwartz then threw the Card
machine into second gear, the lights
on varsity field came on, and an of
fensive scrum took place.
DURKET SHINES
Both Mike Durket and Ted Burke
worked out in their new posts—
quarterback and tackle respectively.
Durket has shown rapid improve
ment since the week began in ball
handling and precision.
Hope was held out that Wayne
Erickson and Bob Rohrer would
both see action against the OSC
Beavers this weekend. Erickson
suited up without pads and ran
through his offensive plays at right
half.
George Quist hobbled around on
defense without pads. The husky
blonde, in on almost every tackle
last week against Washington, will
serve as game captain this Saturday.
BEAVERS STUNG BY USC
The Cards expect nothing but
trouble against Lon Stiner's Beavers.
The Oregon outfit is still smarting
from a 48 to (> pasting at the hands
of USC and took out their wrath on
little Portland U., 4(5 to 0, last week.
The Beavers build their offensive
strength around the optional pass
play employing both halfbacks (Don
Samuel and Don Campbell). War
ren Simas at quarter and Ken Car
penter at fullback round out an all
veteran backfield.
