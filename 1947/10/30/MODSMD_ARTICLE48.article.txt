# Villagers Win 25-0
## 
### 
In intramural football play to
day Village 210 rolled to a 25 to 0
win over Encina 3E in a League
VII game. With a heavy field mak
ing rushing almost impossible, the
passing of Dick Randall and Don
Thamer played an important part in
the Villagers' victory.
Early in the game Thamer tossed
a twenty yarder into the end zone
to Jim Zwerncman for six points.
Another pass to Steve Lee for the
conversion made the score 7 to 0.
RANDALL HITS TWICE
In the second half Randall threw
touchdown passes to Gene Tankers
ley and Stan Scott, and Zwerneman
ran ten yards on a delayed cut back
through center for the final six
pointer. For the losers the back
field razzle-daggle of Denny Tuf
fanelli and Ed Smith was a constant
threat.

racked up its first win by blanking
Encina 3W 14 to 0. Both scores came

from Don Bates to Vince Butler
and a 15 yard runback of an inter
cepted pass by Jack Martin. Passes
from Bates and Martin to Butler and
Bob Katz respectively capped both
touchdowns with extra points. Tony

serves of the Villagemen was too
much.
