KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., Oct. 29
(UP). — Oregon's Governor Earl
Snell, his immediate successor, and
the Oregon Secretary of State were
killed in the wreck of a private
plane whose veteran pilot, flying
thm to hunting grounds, lost his
way in bad weather and hit a tree,
state police reported last night.
A rescue party of police, sheriff's
deputies, and forest rangers came
across the shattered remains of the
red and silver Beechcraft scattered
in the snow beyond a sheared-off
pine tree 36 miles south of their in
tended destination at Lakeview,
Oregon.
Klled in addition to Snell were his
second in line of succession, Senate
President Marshall Cornett; Robert
S. Farrell, Jr., Secretary of State;
and plot Cliff Hogue.
The state executives had been on
a half-hour flight last night from
Klamath Falls, heading for a goose
hunting junket into the most rug
ged part of Oregon to relax from
their official duties.
"All aboard the plane are dead,"
was the brief word received from
the search party that pushed into
the relatively isolated area after pi
lot A. Adams, participating in Ore
gon's greatest air search for a miss
ng plane, spotted the smashed rem
nants south of Dog Lake.
This week, as soon as possible
after absolute identification is made,
a special session undoubtedly will
be called. Even before that John H.
Hall, Portland attoney and Speaker
of the Oregon House, will be sworn
in as Govei'nor to replace Snell.
