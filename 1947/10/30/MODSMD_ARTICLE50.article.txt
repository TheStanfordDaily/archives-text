# Penpushers, KSU Clash
## 
### 
Tension was mounting today and
a veil of secrecy hung over the Daily
shack, as Coach "Bronko" Catudio
began tapering off his 20 man scribe
seven for tomorrow's tilt with the
ether-wave heroes of Station KSU.
The long festering dispute between
the two local propaganda organs
came to a climax last week when one
of the KSU Commandos handed the
Daily "athletic staff" a blistering
ultimatum, challenging them to set
tle accounts on the gridiron.
Coach Art Levinson of the KSU
hucksters, in a brief interview yes
terday afternoon in the Frost Am
phitheater, where his varsity was
holding a secret workout, growled,
"Our disk jockeys are rarin' to go,
and we'll shove those linotype ma
chines down the mouths of those
manipulators of the typewriter. And
if our backfield stars are ready,
we'll undoubtedly take to the air."
Catudio, the Daily headman, was
busily engaged in working out new
play variations for the crucial game
on Friday, but found time # to say,
"Although my line is big, aggressive
and willing, it's definitely unbal
anced."
