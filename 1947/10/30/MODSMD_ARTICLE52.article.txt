# Poloists Meet SC
## 
### 
With a crucial weekend of water
polo on their minds, Coach Tom
Haynie and ten of his varsity water
poloists will board the Southern
Pacific Daylight this noon bound
for the all important southern series
with USC and UCLA.
A double win for the Cards would
put them x in undisputed possession
of first place in the conference stand
ings, whereas even a single loss, par
ticularly to the title hungry Trojans,
would make it difficult for the Stan
fordites to finish higher than sec
ond.
INDIANS MEET TROJANS
First stop for the Indian express
will be the USC pool tomorrow af
ternoon at 3:30, when the Farm mer
men will tangle with Coach Fred
Cady's Troy team for the first time
this season.
On the basis of the two teams'
showings against a common oppon
ent, Fullerton J.C., the Indians
should be given the edge. But this
is hardly enough to offset the Troy
advantage of playing in their own
pool. Stanford defeated Fullerton
last Saturday, 7 to 3, while USC
was dropped by the Hornets, 15 to
6, at the beginning of the season.
THEN THE BRUINS
A second attempt will be made to
derail the Indian victory train Sat
urday morning at the Westwood
pool of the UCLA Bruins.
Making the trtp for Stanford will
be Captain Dick Narver, Harry
Borchers, Ralph Sala, Walter Lull,
Fritz Maurer, Jim Armstrong, Don
Hester, Ken Fox, Ed Major, Hase
Rodenbaugh, and student manager
John Burch.
