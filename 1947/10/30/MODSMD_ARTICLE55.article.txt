# A 						'Walkout' Solution
## 
### 
For years Daily editorials have been hitting
at Cellar walkouts.
For as many years Chappie jokesters have
been burlesquing the same problem.
What has been the result? A few laughs
and a few more shrugged shoulders.
Thousands of honest Stanford students must
be getting a little tired of wordy warnings
about walkouts. This majority-group pay
their checks and need no prodding to do so.
Of course there is a minority faction who
either absentmindedly neglect to pay, or who
enjoy the sport of getting something for
nothing.
Strong editorials or Chappie cartoons
aren't going to cure absentmindedness, and

certainly they won't prevent dishonesty. Fac
ing the facts it must be admitted that there
are certain cellar-patrons who will walk-out
if given half a chance.
One adequate answer would be the install
ation of a turnstile system. Or perhaps a pay
when served set-up could be worked out.
To install turnstiles would not be admitting
any basic dishonesty of Stanford students
and it would not belittle the Fundamental
Standard or the Honor Code, it would simply
be good business.
This week, as in so many weeks in past
years, the Student Manager reports that Cellar
walkouts are soaring.
Let's have turnstiles instead of editorials.
