# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
After Monday's anti-feminine outburst against
dating women too far in advance, things really got
lough.
Most of the men seemed satisfied that I spoke the
truth, but the girls—oh Christopher, were some of
them blued off. One self-appointed Manzanita dele
gate personally gave ine a verbal thrashing, and fol
lowed it up with an invitation to all the campus males
without leprosy to avail themselves of an unexplored
gold mine, right here on campus.
If that's not a hint, I'll eat a candle for supper!

Another brilliant stunt was pulled on one of the
more gullible Storey girls very recently. This inno
cent little charmer was going to a party or some
deal with a bunch of the Alpha Delts the other night.
One of the gang, by the name of Don, said he'd call
her later in the week and let her know the details
of the party—what to wear, what to do, you know,
the usual stuff.
Anyhow, this Storey Miss came home from classes
one afternoon, and found a note in her box, saying
to phone up Don at Palo Alto so-and-so for the

details of the party. Aha, she thinks, now I get to
find out what gives.
Smart as she is, she heads for the nearest phone
booth and starts dialing the number, very deftly.
The ensuing conversation went something like this:
"Hello, may I speak to Don, please?"
"I'm sorry, but he's not in right now. Can I give
him a message, maybe?"
"Wellll, no, but didn't he leave a message for me?"
''No, I don't think Dr. Tresidder did. What was
your name?"
Stunned silence, and a receiver was rapidly banged
down.
All of which was bad enough, but it might have
been worse had "Don" answered the phone in person,
don't you think?

Ingenious El Cuadro eating club has done it again!
To the consternation of the bees in front of the
cellar coffee shop, a complicated "trap" has made its
appearance and is daily collecting its toll in dead
beasts.
Thanks, El Cuadro, we needed it more than Jack
Benny's moose needed a hatrack!

cent little charmer was going to a party or some
deal with a bunch of the Alpha Delts the other night.
One of the gang, by the name of Don, said he'd call
her later in the week and let her know the details
of the party—what to wear, what to do, you know,
the usual stuff.
Anyhow, this Storey Miss came home from classes
one afternoon, and found a note in her box, saying
to phone up Don at Palo Alto so-and-so for the

details of the party. Aha, she thinks, now I get to
find out what gives.
Smart as she is, she heads for the nearest phone
booth and starts dialing the number, very deftly.
The ensuing conversation went something like this:
"Hello, may I speak to Don, please?"
"I'm sorry, but he's not in right now. Can I give
him a message, maybe?"
"Wellll, no, but didn't he leave a message for me?"
''No, I don't think Dr. Tresidder did. What was
your name?"
Stunned silence, and a receiver was rapidly banged
down.
All of which was bad enough, but it might have
been worse had "Don" answered the phone in person,
don't you think?

Ingenious El Cuadro eating club has done it again!
To the consternation of the bees in front of the
cellar coffee shop, a complicated "trap" has made its
appearance and is daily collecting its toll in dead
beasts.
Thanks, El Cuadro, we needed it more than Jack
Benny's moose needed a hatrack!
After Monday's anti-feminine outburst against
dating women too far in advance, things really got
lough.
Most of the men seemed satisfied that I spoke the
truth, but the girls—oh Christopher, were some of
them blued off. One self-appointed Manzanita dele
gate personally gave ine a verbal thrashing, and fol
lowed it up with an invitation to all the campus males
without leprosy to avail themselves of an unexplored
gold mine, right here on campus.
If that's not a hint, I'll eat a candle for supper!
