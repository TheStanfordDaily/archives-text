### GEORGE BRUNN 
Call me tovarich —take me to a show. I went to
the movies the other night and I feel like a fugitive
from the Fourth International. Come to my aid, Mr.
Thomas, and bring your committee. Rescue me from
the clutches of Uncle Joe. Help me concoct Molotov
Cocktails to blast the Reds of the screen.
Unsuspecting I paid out my six bits, expecting a
couple hours of patriotic entertainment like any red
white-and blue-blooded American. Little did I know.
Those radicals work cleverly. First they showed what
appeared to be a harmless cartoon. About a cat chas
ing a mouse. But the theme soon became clear. It was
a big greedy power-drunk capitalist cat oppressing
a poor, innocent, hard working, ruthlessly exploited
mouse. Of course the mouse, representing the starv
ing but courageous proletariat. Well-organized and
with unswerving determination it beat the living day
lights out of the cat, I mean the cruel monopolist.
My rage cooled when the Western Hashed on the
screen. Nothing could be wrong here. I prepared to
relax. Lulled into a false sense of security, the blow
hit me doubly hard. The Western was but a variation
on the same theme, only less subtle.
Cats were replaced by cattle ranchers, mice by
homesteaders. The ranchers were shown in all their
arrogance, shooting, looting, exploiting at will. They
controlled the sheriff, ran the town. The poor, weak,
honest, industrious homesteaders were given an
awful time. But not for long. Soon they learned the
fundamental lesson of Communism—organize! Led
by Bill Lenin Bryan they pooled their resources, or
ganized a secret army and in a bloody finale over
threw the ranchers. Justice and collectivism tri
umphed. Arise ye wretched of the earth!

If that isn't inciting to revolution I don't know
what is. Mr. Thomas, please take' immediate steps to
insure that henceforth there shall be no more villains
iti Westerns. Except possibly foreigners. All Ameri
cans must be heroes.
Then came the final blow: the main feature. The
cartoon enraged me, the Western stunned me, but
the feature made me contact the F. 8.1, immediately.
It was about a steel worker. An honest, hard-work
ing steel worker. He was forced to murder a cruel
and cunning magician. All society went against him.
A thousand policemen besieged his house and after
a night of siege used tear gas to force him into sub
mission.
The Communists here threw all subtlety to the
winds. The Marxist lessons they preach are obvious.
First they show the decadence of our system, forcing
innocent men to commit murder. The magician
symbolized the monopolist with his same bagful of
clever tricks. Then the innocent worker is ruthlessly
hunted down.
Besides showing the viciousness of the system,
the film employs stark tragedy to show the worker
that he cannot fight it alone. It shows him that rotten
capitalism is shrewd, well-organized, and will slop at
nothing. It shows him that they have the power, the
guns, the money, that the system stacks all the cards
against him. Workers, our only hope is militant dis
ciplined organization. Get your party registration
cards in the lobby.
Here, Mr. Thomas, is first hand evidence of the
invidious lying propaganda the Reds spread by their
films. Save us before it is too late!

nothing. It shows him that they have the power, the
guns, the money, that the system stacks all the cards
against him. Workers, our only hope is militant dis

cards in the lobby.
Here, Mr. Thomas, is first hand evidence of the
invidious lying propaganda the Reds spread by their
films. Save us before it is too late!
Call me tovarich —take me to a show. I went to
the movies the other night and I feel like a fugitive
from the Fourth International. Come to my aid, Mr.
Thomas, and bring your committee. Rescue me from
the clutches of Uncle Joe. Help me concoct Molotov
Cocktails to blast the Reds of the screen.
Unsuspecting I paid out my six bits, expecting a
couple hours of patriotic entertainment like any red
white-and blue-blooded American. Little did I know.
Those radicals work cleverly. First they showed what
appeared to be a harmless cartoon. About a cat chas
ing a mouse. But the theme soon became clear. It was
a big greedy power-drunk capitalist cat oppressing
a poor, innocent, hard working, ruthlessly exploited
mouse. Of course the mouse, representing the starv
ing but courageous proletariat. Well-organized and
with unswerving determination it beat the living day
lights out of the cat, I mean the cruel monopolist.
My rage cooled when the Western Hashed on the
screen. Nothing could be wrong here. I prepared to
relax. Lulled into a false sense of security, the blow
hit me doubly hard. The Western was but a variation
on the same theme, only less subtle.
Cats were replaced by cattle ranchers, mice by
homesteaders. The ranchers were shown in all their
arrogance, shooting, looting, exploiting at will. They
controlled the sheriff, ran the town. The poor, weak,
honest, industrious homesteaders were given an
awful time. But not for long. Soon they learned the
fundamental lesson of Communism—organize! Led
by Bill Lenin Bryan they pooled their resources, or
ganized a secret army and in a bloody finale over
threw the ranchers. Justice and collectivism tri
umphed. Arise ye wretched of the earth!

If that isn't inciting to revolution I don't know
what is. Mr. Thomas, please take' immediate steps to
insure that henceforth there shall be no more villains
iti Westerns. Except possibly foreigners. All Ameri
cans must be heroes.
Then came the final blow: the main feature. The
cartoon enraged me, the Western stunned me, but
the feature made me contact the F. 8.1, immediately.
It was about a steel worker. An honest, hard-work
ing steel worker. He was forced to murder a cruel
and cunning magician. All society went against him.
A thousand policemen besieged his house and after
a night of siege used tear gas to force him into sub
mission.
The Communists here threw all subtlety to the
winds. The Marxist lessons they preach are obvious.
First they show the decadence of our system, forcing
innocent men to commit murder. The magician
symbolized the monopolist with his same bagful of
clever tricks. Then the innocent worker is ruthlessly
hunted down.
Besides showing the viciousness of the system,
the film employs stark tragedy to show the worker
that he cannot fight it alone. It shows him that rotten
capitalism is shrewd, well-organized, and will slop at
nothing. It shows him that they have the power, the
guns, the money, that the system stacks all the cards
against him. Workers, our only hope is militant dis
ciplined organization. Get your party registration
