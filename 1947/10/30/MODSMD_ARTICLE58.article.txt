To the Editor:
I have followed with increasing interest the noble
struggle of Encina Hall freshmen to maintain the
traditionally high standards of Stanford student free
dom and waterbagging. It is time, I feel, for the entire
student body to follow, dripping, behind them.
In spite of a very intelligent survey of waterbag
ging in a recent "Bull Session," a Daily this week re
ported that Encina Hall had been forced to submit
suggestions for "legalized" water throwing activities.
I am sure that it. was the acute lack of space that
forced the editors to omit the details of these sug
gestions, which, no doubt, would have been more
than revealing. But even these are reported un
likely of success. This is an unfortunate situation
since frustration at early stages of a college career
may lead to psychological complications and even . . .
shhh! is Congress listening? .... even to Com
munism. So there! I said it, and I'm glad.
Now my plan is simple so simple, in fact, that
"simple" is the only word to describe it.
1. An inter-collegiate waterbagging committee,
to be known as "Wets" should be organized. Its pur
pose to raise the general standards of waterbagging
in American universities.
2. Waterbagging should be directed against people
only this excludes professors.

3. Water must be directed only against willing
recipients. (Example: the student who has always
wanted to take a shower, but could never summon
up enough courage to make that fatal first move.)
Since it is often impossible to discover, from a safe
distance, whether or not the victim is willing, it
may become necessary to throw the water first.
Should the victim prove annoyed, he should be fur
nished a towel.
To critics of my plan, I am willing to admit bias. I
am a raincoat salesman.

To the Editor:
In quoting our University motto in a letter to the
Editor on Wednesday, Russell Noyes Jr. makes a
mistake which has cropped up several times in the
past. â€¢
The correct quotation is "Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht" and not "Die Luft der Freiheit Weiht." This
same mistake appeared in this year's Frosh Bible, and
the incorrect version translates that the wind of
freedom holifies."
Our correct motto reads: "The wind of freedom
blows."
