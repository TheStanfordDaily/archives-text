the Community Youth Fund of the
Palo Alto 7 Stanford area, which
supports the YWCA. YMCA, Boy

and 10 per cent to miscellaneous
charities.
Donations will he solicited in all
campus living groups and by mail
to ofT-campus students. There will
also be booths on campus and in
the Village to accept donations.
Drive contributions may be made
on the installment plan with the
second date being Dec. 4.
Volunteers to work at the booths
are asked to come to the SIRO
shack near Encina Commons be
tween 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. any

The goal, stated Dirker and Miss

between the amount of money
needed by the agencies coverd in
the drive and the amount that is
usually donated.
