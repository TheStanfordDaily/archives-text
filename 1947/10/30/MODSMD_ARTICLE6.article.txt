### 
Excom's stand on political groups
on the Stanfoi'd campus will be dis
cussed following the election of offi
cers in AVC's second meeting of
the quarter tonight at 7:30 in room
E53, Education Building.
Preston Burchard, vice-chairman
of the chapter, urged all members
and friends of the chapter to be
present, since an entire new set of
officers will be elected for the com
ing quarter. Bob Hoyt, outgoing
chairman, will preside for the last
time this evening.
Burchard further stated he was
sure that some concerted action and
expression of opinion would be
voiced by the chapter tonight, but
that no one could be sure whether
Excom would be upheld or not.
