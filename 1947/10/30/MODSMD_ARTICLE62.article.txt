To most people the bears wan
dering freely about Yoscmite Na
tional Park are a picturesque
sight indeed. But not to Ernie

elawed bis way through the top
of Ernie's convertible club coupe,
tore away the back seat uphol
stery, and pilfered the food stowed
in the luggage compartment.
Ernie said he was sleeping just
15 feet away during all the ruck
us. His friends at the Alpha Sig
house say this is entirely possible
since Ernie sleeps almost as sound
as a bear in hibernation.
