# French Vote Confidence For Ramadier Cabinet
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 30 (UP). — The
French National Assembly voted
confidence in Socialist Premier Paul
Ramadier's coalition government by
a small majority tonight, averting at
least temporarily a showdown be
tween the Communists and the
rightist forces grouped under the
resurgent banner of Gen. Charles
De Gaulle.
The Assembly gave Ramadier 300
votes against 280 for dissolution of
his cabinet, with 18 abstentions and
15 deputies absent. It was his small
est majority in seven confidence
votes since he became premier in
January.
Just before voting started, Ra
madier, a stooped, white - headed
figure visibly aged after nine gruel
ing months in office, mounted the
rostrum and, in a voice shaking with
emotion, appealed to the chamber
not to split France into hostile
"Russian and American camps."
Moderate and left-center parties
threw their support to Ramadier;
the extreme left ar.d extreme right
voted against him.
Party leaders backing Ramadier
made it clear they were not voting
for his financial and economic poli

cies but felt a vote against his gov
ernment would be tantamount to
calling for a knock-down, drag-out
battle between the Communists and
Gaullists for control of France.
The risk of civil war was men
tioned several times during a three
j hour debate preceding the confi
dence vote.
Answering De Gaulle's demand
for a national referendum, Rama
dier said: "It's a question whether
we are going to use the lie of pleb
iscite in order to overthrow the re
public."
Although the atmosphere was
tense and the chamber was jammed,
only one flare-up marked the de
bate—a brief spat between Com
munist spoksman Maurice Kricgel
j Valrimont and Foreign Minister
