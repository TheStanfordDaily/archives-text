# Two Houses Fined $150 Each; New Interfraternity Policy Set
## Improved Status Sought by Board 
### 
Two fraternity houses were fined
$150 each yesterday in what Pete
August, chairman of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control, termed
"the start of a constructive effort to
improve the status of fraternities
in the eyes of the public.
"The Board's move was taken in
the light of information that the
fraternities themselves had not to
ken satisfactory action in regard to
these obvious infractions of good
behavior," W. G. Mackenzie, alumni
member of the Board, stated.
UNBECOMING BEHAVIOR
"Certain unknown members" of
Delta Kappa Epsiion were found
guilty of removing furniture from
Stanford women's residences, at a
meeting of the Board Wednesday
night. A member of the accused
fraternity was present at the meet
ing.
Members of Phi Delta Theta were
found guilty of hosing passing cars
and pedestrians, banging on the
front doors of women's residences,
using obscene language and unbe
coming actions in view of the resi
dents of those houses, and brandish
ing and throwing bottles. The fines
must be paid to the Interfraternity
Board of Control by Nov. 15.
FUTURE ACTION
"Definite action by the Board will
be taken after this for any offenses
or misdemeanors committed on
campus by fraternities," stated Au
gust. "However, this should not be
taken as a threat. The Board is
willing to back any fraternity which
behaves itself. We are simply striv
ing to eliminate behavior which
gives the fraternities an unsavory
reputation in the eyes of others."
In accordance with Stanford cus
tom, fraternities are privileged to
solve their own problems of this
nature, he said. If they do not come
to a satisfactory solution, the Boai'd
must act. Interfraternity Board is
an independent body of fraternity
members, faculty, and alumni au
thorized by the University to con
duct fraternity affairs.
The board also passed a change
in the rule which stated that "a
man must he plus zero to move
into a fraternity house." The rule
as amended states that "a pledge
who is not more than minus 11
may move into a fraternity house.
Fraternity men who are on pro
bation for two consecutive quar
ters must move out of the house
for the third quarter." A student
must still be at least minus zero
to pledge a fraternity, August
pointed out.
The Board passed rushing rules
and decided on rushing dates for
fall and winter quarters of 1947-48.
Rushing dates are:
Fall quarter — Tuesday, Nov 11,
7 to 8:30 p.m.; Thursday, Nov. 13, 7
p.m.
Winter quarter—One open house,
on Thursday, Jan. 8, or Tuesday,
Jan. 13.
Six meal dates, three per week for
two weeks (including Preference
Dinner) —Thursday, Jan. 15; Tues
day, Jan. 20; Thursday, Jan. 22;
Monday, Jan. 26; Wednesday, Jan
28; Friday, Jan. 30 (Preference Din

front doors of women's residences,
using obscene language and unbe
coming actions in view of the resi
dents of those houses, and brandish
ing and throwing bottles. The fines
must be paid to the Interfraternity
Board of Control by Nov. 15.
FUTURE ACTION
"Definite action by the Board will
be taken after this for any offenses
or misdemeanors committed on
campus by fraternities," stated Au
gust. "However, this should not be
taken as a threat. The Board is
willing to back any fraternity which
behaves itself. We are simply striv
ing to eliminate behavior which
gives the fraternities an unsavory
reputation in the eyes of others."
In accordance with Stanford cus
tom, fraternities are privileged to
solve their own problems of this
nature, he said. If they do not come
to a satisfactory solution, the Boai'd
must act. Interfraternity Board is
an independent body of fraternity
members, faculty, and alumni au
thorized by the University to con
duct fraternity affairs.
The board also passed a change
in the rule which stated that "a
man must he plus zero to move
into a fraternity house." The rule
as amended states that "a pledge
who is not more than minus 11
may move into a fraternity house.
Fraternity men who are on pro
bation for two consecutive quar
ters must move out of the house
for the third quarter." A student
must still be at least minus zero
to pledge a fraternity, August
pointed out.
The Board passed rushing rules
and decided on rushing dates for
fall and winter quarters of 1947-48.
Rushing dates are:
Fall quarter — Tuesday, Nov 11,
7 to 8:30 p.m.; Thursday, Nov. 13, 7
p.m.
Winter quarter—One open house,
on Thursday, Jan. 8, or Tuesday,
Jan. 13.
Six meal dates, three per week for
two weeks (including Preference
Dinner) —Thursday, Jan. 15; Tues
day, Jan. 20; Thursday, Jan. 22;
Monday, Jan. 26; Wednesday, Jan

Two fraternity houses were fined
$150 each yesterday in what Pete
August, chairman of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control, termed
"the start of a constructive effort to
improve the status of fraternities
in the eyes of the public.
"The Board's move was taken in
the light of information that the
fraternities themselves had not to
ken satisfactory action in regard to
these obvious infractions of good
behavior," W. G. Mackenzie, alumni
member of the Board, stated.
UNBECOMING BEHAVIOR
"Certain unknown members" of
Delta Kappa Epsiion were found
guilty of removing furniture from
Stanford women's residences, at a
meeting of the Board Wednesday
night. A member of the accused
fraternity was present at the meet
ing.
Members of Phi Delta Theta were
found guilty of hosing passing cars
and pedestrians, banging on the
front doors of women's residences,
using obscene language and unbe
coming actions in view of the resi
dents of those houses, and brandish
ing and throwing bottles. The fines
must be paid to the Interfraternity
