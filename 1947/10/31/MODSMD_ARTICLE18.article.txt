# SAE to Feature Music, Costumes
## 
### 
A five-piece band and refresh
ments are offered costumed stu
dents at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Halloween dance tonight from 9 to
1, said Jim Brett, social chairman.
Paul Law and his orchestra will
provide the music, he said, and the
whole campus is invited . . . free.

It is not mandatory that costumes
follow the Halloween theme, Brett
continued. A prize will be awarded
the couple wearing the most origi
nal outfit. The dance will be held
at the SAE house.
