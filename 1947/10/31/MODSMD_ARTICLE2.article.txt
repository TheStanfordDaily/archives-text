# Indians Show Great Spirit in Practice; Have Chance To Beat Beat Beavers in Tomorrow's Gameâ€”Marchie
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Marchie Schv/artz is still optimistic.
His Stanford football charges have lost five straight games.
They are expected to make it six in a row against Oregon State
in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon. And yet Coach Schwartz,
with convincing sincerity, looks at the apparently black future
like this: I

"If the spirit shown in the last
several workouts means anything,
then we definitely have a chance to
win over the Beavers."
One thing is certain. Stanford will
take the field for the 2 o'clock kick
off in better shape physically than
they have been at any time since the
season started.
QUIST WILL PLAY
George Quist, rugged right half
back, will be used on defense as a
line backer. Marty Feldman, right
guard, has been given the trainer's
go-sign and will also be ready for
defensive duty. Feldman has been
out of action since the Santa Clara
game.
Sophomore halfback Mickey Titus,
sidelined with a knee injury since
the Michigan game, should be able
to get into action, at least on a
part-time basis.
On the other side of the injury
ledger are left half Wayne Eriekson
and guard Bob Rohrcr, both out
with shoulder pointers. There is a
chance that Eriekson may play, but
Rohrer is definitely incapacitated.
NAFZIGER ON DEFENSE
Jim Nafziger, still plagued with
charley-horses, will be employed as
defensive fullback, with Marty An

derson and Don Zappettini handling
that position on offense.
The Indians ran through light
drills in practice yesterday, smooth
ing out their offense and preparing
defensive set-ups to stop Oregon
State's attack.
The Beavers have been installed
as three to one favorites, and are ex
pected to win by approximately 15
points, but the weatherman predicts
rain for tonight and tomorrow
morning. That could change the
complexion of the game consider
ably.
A sloppy turf might well slow of
fensive action down to a walk and
turn the game into a pattern of
straight-ahead running plays and
a battle for line supremacy.
NINETEENTH REUNION
This will be the 19th meeting of
the two teams. Stanford holds a
commanding edge in the won-lost
statistics, with 13 victories to 3 for
Oregon State. There have been 2
ties.
And, although neither the Indians
or the Beavers are going any place
in the Pacific Coast Conference race,
a crowd of close to 20,000 is ex
pected to be on hand tomorrow.

team strength.)

They are expected to make it six in a row against Oregon State
in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon. And yet Coach Schwartz,
with convincing sincerity, looks at the apparently black future
like this: I

"If the spirit shown in the last
several workouts means anything,
then we definitely have a chance to
win over the Beavers."
One thing is certain. Stanford will
take the field for the 2 o'clock kick
off in better shape physically than
they have been at any time since the
season started.
QUIST WILL PLAY
George Quist, rugged right half
back, will be used on defense as a
line backer. Marty Feldman, right
guard, has been given the trainer's
go-sign and will also be ready for
defensive duty. Feldman has been
out of action since the Santa Clara
game.
Sophomore halfback Mickey Titus,
sidelined with a knee injury since
the Michigan game, should be able
to get into action, at least on a
part-time basis.
On the other side of the injury
ledger are left half Wayne Eriekson
and guard Bob Rohrcr, both out
with shoulder pointers. There is a
chance that Eriekson may play, but
Rohrer is definitely incapacitated.
NAFZIGER ON DEFENSE
Jim Nafziger, still plagued with
charley-horses, will be employed as
defensive fullback, with Marty An

derson and Don Zappettini handling
that position on offense.
The Indians ran through light
drills in practice yesterday, smooth
ing out their offense and preparing
defensive set-ups to stop Oregon
State's attack.
The Beavers have been installed
as three to one favorites, and are ex
pected to win by approximately 15
points, but the weatherman predicts
rain for tonight and tomorrow
morning. That could change the
complexion of the game consider
ably.
A sloppy turf might well slow of
fensive action down to a walk and
turn the game into a pattern of
straight-ahead running plays and
a battle for line supremacy.
NINETEENTH REUNION
This will be the 19th meeting of
the two teams. Stanford holds a
commanding edge in the won-lost
statistics, with 13 victories to 3 for
Oregon State. There have been 2
ties.
And, although neither the Indians
or the Beavers are going any place
in the Pacific Coast Conference race,
a crowd of close to 20,000 is ex
pected to be on hand tomorrow.
(See page 3 for starting line-ups
and an appraisal of Oregon State's
team strength.)
Marchie Schv/artz is still optimistic.
His Stanford football charges have lost five straight games.
