## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, NY., Oyt. 30
(UP). The United Nations political
committee voted today to send a
special commission to Korea and
Russia announced immediately that
the Soviet bloc would boycott it.
Russia announced the boycott on
grounds that the political committee
acted without first consulting repre
sentatives of the Korean people.
When the committee refused to
call 1 in Korean spokesmen, the So
viet bloc boycotted the voting.
When the commission was voted
anyway, the Soviet bloc announced
it would have nothing to do with the
commission
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
Said that it would be "impossible to
participate in the commission."
This apparently dashed any hopes
that the proposed commission would
be allowed to enter Soviet-occupied
northern Korea, which now is bar
led to almost all "outsiders.
The resolution voted by the po
litical committee, composed of all
57 UN members, would empower
the commission to travel through
both the Soviet and American oc
cupation zones to consult Koreans
on their desires for Korea's future.
