						Witch Would Have Just a Bit of an Itch

Ruble girls in ISC corridor
worked busily last night after
dinner decorating their hall for
a bewitching air to the festivities
and scattered sprays of autumn
leaves around to add to the
spooky atmosphere. The leaves
were the products of a long search
along the creek bed out near Ros
sotti's.
Roble's Halloween party had a
real live villain—the scourge of
Stanford—poison oak.
