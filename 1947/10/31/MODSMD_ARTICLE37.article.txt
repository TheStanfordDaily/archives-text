"Very unusual qualities," "lovely
work," "decided increase in depth
of personality and graphic character
study," "sure feelings" — these are
some oi' the comments made by stu
dents viewing the current exhibi
tion of Mendelowitz paintings in the
Art Gallery.
In the exhibit, entitled 'Retro
spectives." it is easy for beginner
and art student alike to recognize
Mendelowitz' development in style,
color, and control. His transition is
particularly apparent in his group
paintings of the same landscape in
different periods. For instance, his
treatments of "Foothills of Milpi
tas," done respectively in 1929, '31,
and '43, distinctly show his change
from thin, bright, detailed lines to
a dark, rich, simplified style. His
more recent versions of the foothills
are typified by depth of tone, se
verity, movement, and rhythm.
Mr. Mendelowitz prefers to paint
toward evening or on dark days,
which may account for the somber,
grey-bluish moods of his later work.
Most of his scenes have been taken
from this locality, except for some
paintings made while traveling in
the Northwest last summer. His
current works have a marine influ
ence throughout, depicted with
fluid, sweeping lines.
The portraits in his collection are
serious and realistic, with some of
the later pictures appearing brighter
and surer than the very first. One
portrait is particularly unusual, be
ing a brown monochrome in the
manner of the classic school.
Friends of Mr. Mendelowitz consid
ered his original sketch so effective
in brown and white that they per
suaded him to leave it thus.
Mr. Mendelowitz, a member of
the Stanford faculty, has had many
one-man exhibitions of his paint
ings in San Francisco. The current
showing in the Art Gallery will
continue to Nov. 16.
