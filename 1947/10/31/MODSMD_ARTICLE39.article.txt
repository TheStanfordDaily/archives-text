# Fred Glover, Director of Information, Keeps Press Happy and Well Informed
## 
### DICK BIESER 
Stanford's link with the metropol
itan press, home-town newspapers
of students, and with magazines is
located in busy offices on the second
floor of a building on the Outer
Quad, near the Engineering corner.
There is a city news room atmos
phere to the office—telephone jan
gling with calls from city newspa
pers, The Daily, or the Palo Alto
Times —as Fred Glover, Stanford's
director of information, and his as
sistants try to keep the press happy
—and informed.
The office tries to answer press
questions before they are asked by
getting out news releases on Stan
ford news developments, whether it
be faculty honors, science stories,
or student activities.
News stories and magazine arti
cles are turned out on copy paper
headed with the title in red letters
"Stanford University News, from
the Director of Information."
"Our main job is to help the press
get information on Stanford, wheth
er it be the Stanford Daily or the
New York Times," Mr. Glover ex
plained.
One of the jobs of Mr. Glover and
Mrs. Betty Bertelsen is to put out
the quarterly news bulletin, "Stan
ford Today." About 55.000 copies
are printed and approximately 41,-
000 are mailed to alumni in all parts
of the world.
EDITOR SCOOPS HIMSELF
It is a unique publication in that
the editor tries hard to scoop him
self. Every story in "Stanford To
day" has already been released to
as many outlets as the story war
ranted.
By sending out science stories
with a delayed release date of five
days, it enables the papers to de
velop individual stories, to take
more pictures if they wish, and to
conduct interviews of their own.
Before he came to Stanford in
November of last year Mr. Glover
was editor of the Burlingame Ad
vance. He has had ten years' news
paper experience on the Peninsula.
He was graduated from Stanford in
the Class of '33.
ANOTHER STANFORD GRAD
Mrs. Bertelsen, a Stanford jour
nalism graduate in 1942, has been
in the University Information Of
fice since September, 1944. She now
holds the post of Assistant Director
of Information.
The third member of the organi
zation is Mrs. Ann Elwick. She
takes care of the distribution of
news releases, filing, and steno
graphic work.
When a magazine wants a feature
story, when an alumnus wants a
Stanford sticker, when visiting dig
nitaries want Farm literature, they
all end up in the upstairs office of
Glover & Co.
CAN'T SCOOP SCIENCE
"There is a particular reason why
we can't scoop a scientific publica
tion," Mr. Glover said. "It is very
important for a professor to get his
paper in a scientific publication first.
And for this reason we have medi
cal stories that won't be released for
a year."
"In short," he said, "we co-oper
ate in any way we can with news
papers and make sure that they get
the stories as soon as possible and
get them right."

November of last year Mr. Glover
was editor of the Burlingame Ad
vance. He has had ten years' news
paper experience on the Peninsula.
He was graduated from Stanford in
the Class of '33.
ANOTHER STANFORD GRAD
Mrs. Bertelsen, a Stanford jour
nalism graduate in 1942, has been
in the University Information Of
fice since September, 1944. She now
holds the post of Assistant Director
of Information.
The third member of the organi
zation is Mrs. Ann Elwick. She
takes care of the distribution of
news releases, filing, and steno
graphic work.
When a magazine wants a feature
story, when an alumnus wants a
Stanford sticker, when visiting dig
nitaries want Farm literature, they
all end up in the upstairs office of
Glover & Co.
CAN'T SCOOP SCIENCE
"There is a particular reason why
we can't scoop a scientific publica
tion," Mr. Glover said. "It is very
important for a professor to get his
paper in a scientific publication first.
And for this reason we have medi
cal stories that won't be released for
a year."
"In short," he said, "we co-oper
ate in any way we can with news
papers and make sure that they get
the stories as soon as possible and
get them right."


FRED GLOVEIt is Stanford's director of information and the Farm's
publicity link with newspapers and magazines. He writes and sends
out all news releases on Stanford activities and answers the questions
that the press often has on Farm news.
Stanford's link with the metropol
itan press, home-town newspapers
of students, and with magazines is
located in busy offices on the second
floor of a building on the Outer
Quad, near the Engineering corner.
There is a city news room atmos
phere to the office—telephone jan
gling with calls from city newspa
pers, The Daily, or the Palo Alto
Times —as Fred Glover, Stanford's
director of information, and his as
sistants try to keep the press happy
—and informed.
The office tries to answer press
questions before they are asked by
getting out news releases on Stan
ford news developments, whether it
be faculty honors, science stories,
or student activities.
News stories and magazine arti
cles are turned out on copy paper
headed with the title in red letters
"Stanford University News, from
the Director of Information."
"Our main job is to help the press
get information on Stanford, wheth
er it be the Stanford Daily or the
New York Times," Mr. Glover ex
plained.
One of the jobs of Mr. Glover and
Mrs. Betty Bertelsen is to put out
the quarterly news bulletin, "Stan
ford Today." About 55.000 copies
are printed and approximately 41,-
000 are mailed to alumni in all parts
of the world.
EDITOR SCOOPS HIMSELF
It is a unique publication in that
the editor tries hard to scoop him
self. Every story in "Stanford To
day" has already been released to
as many outlets as the story war
ranted.
By sending out science stories
with a delayed release date of five
days, it enables the papers to de
velop individual stories, to take
more pictures if they wish, and to
conduct interviews of their own.
