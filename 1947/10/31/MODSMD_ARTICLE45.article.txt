# Single Wing OSC Beavers Are Deceptive, Quick
## 
### JACK CASHEL 
Among other things notable about
the Oregon State football team which
arrives 37 strong today, are mat it
often runs off the single wing, and
that it also boasts a head coach
with the longest coaching tenure
extant in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence.
Coach Lon Stiner, with 13 years
behind him at Corvallis, rolls into
town with a team which is firmly en
trenched in third place in PCC
standings, lagging only behind USC
and UCLA.
OSC FASTER
Irwin Harris, Beaver tub thumper
who pulled into the area earlier this
week, reports the OSC team this
year is faster, but lacks the exper
ience and depth of last season's
Beaver eleven which was nestled in
second place in the conference last
January 1.
But injuries have thrown a low
body block on the Beavers this sea
son, just as it has the Indians.
Three key linemen — end Dick
Lorenze, guard Paul Evensen and
tackle Bill Austin—are expected to
be in playable condition for the first
time since the disastrous USC game
two weeks ago.
LINEMAN WEIGH 20G
The starting Beaver line, which
weighs in at a tidy 208 average, will
probably be composed of Lorenz
and Dave Anderson at ends, Hal
Puddy and Bill Austin at tackles,
Evensen and Ray Crane at guards,
and Jim Swarbrick at center.
With Lorenz, who has been termed
"one of the best ends on the Coast,"
Evensen and Puddy, lies the secret
for much of OSC's line strength.
Puddy, a returning veteran, has
been outstanding in every Beaver
game this season. And Evensen, a
245-pounder from San Francisco,
has just shaken off the effects of an
injured leg, and is ready to roll at
full speed.
I)()\ SAMUEL STAR
Brightest light in Coach Stiner's
backfield is a Soph newcomer by the
name of Don Samuel. Samuel, who
runs from the right half spot, is a
fast l!)0-pounder who boasts the best
passing percentage mark in the con
ference, slightly over 50 percent.
Starting at quarterback is sopho
more letterman Don Mast. Mast
handles most of the punting chores
for the Beavers, and is also classed
as one of the best pass receivers on
the squad.
Ken Carpenter gets the nod at the
starting left half spot. A better than
average passer, Carpenter also

ranked 18th in the nation for indi
vidual rushing last fall.
MOORE AT FULL
A newcomer to the team, Duane'
Moore should start at full. Against
Portland last week, Moore averaged
over seven yards per try in 12 car
ries.
One of the best offensive weapons
utilized by the Beavers is an optional
run-pass play in which the right
half, who is left handed (Samuel is),
runs wide to his left, and sizes up
the situation as to whether pass or
run. The left halfback, who is right
handed (Carpenter is), does the
same thing in the opposite direction.

A newcomer to the team, Duane'
Moore should start at full. Against
Portland last week, Moore averaged
over seven yards per try in 12 car
ries.
One of the best offensive weapons
utilized by the Beavers is an optional
run-pass play in which the right
half, who is left handed (Samuel is),
runs wide to his left, and sizes up
the situation as to whether pass or
run. The left halfback, who is right
handed (Carpenter is), does the
same thing in the opposite direction.


Here is ALONZO "LON" STI
NER, coach of the Oregon Stale
Beavers. Lon has the rare dis
tinction of being the oldest coach
in length of service of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Among other things notable about
the Oregon State football team which
arrives 37 strong today, are mat it
often runs off the single wing, and
that it also boasts a head coach
with the longest coaching tenure
extant in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence.
Coach Lon Stiner, with 13 years
behind him at Corvallis, rolls into
town with a team which is firmly en
trenched in third place in PCC
standings, lagging only behind USC
and UCLA.
OSC FASTER
Irwin Harris, Beaver tub thumper
who pulled into the area earlier this
week, reports the OSC team this
year is faster, but lacks the exper
ience and depth of last season's
Beaver eleven which was nestled in
second place in the conference last
January 1.
But injuries have thrown a low
body block on the Beavers this sea
son, just as it has the Indians.
Three key linemen — end Dick
Lorenze, guard Paul Evensen and
tackle Bill Austin—are expected to
be in playable condition for the first
time since the disastrous USC game
two weeks ago.
LINEMAN WEIGH 20G
The starting Beaver line, which
weighs in at a tidy 208 average, will
probably be composed of Lorenz
and Dave Anderson at ends, Hal
Puddy and Bill Austin at tackles,
Evensen and Ray Crane at guards,
and Jim Swarbrick at center.
With Lorenz, who has been termed
"one of the best ends on the Coast,"
Evensen and Puddy, lies the secret
for much of OSC's line strength.
Puddy, a returning veteran, has
been outstanding in every Beaver
game this season. And Evensen, a
245-pounder from San Francisco,
has just shaken off the effects of an
injured leg, and is ready to roll at
full speed.
I)()\ SAMUEL STAR
Brightest light in Coach Stiner's
backfield is a Soph newcomer by the
name of Don Samuel. Samuel, who
runs from the right half spot, is a
fast l!)0-pounder who boasts the best
passing percentage mark in the con
ference, slightly over 50 percent.
Starting at quarterback is sopho
more letterman Don Mast. Mast
handles most of the punting chores
for the Beavers, and is also classed
as one of the best pass receivers on
the squad.
Ken Carpenter gets the nod at the
starting left half spot. A better than
average passer, Carpenter also

ranked 18th in the nation for indi
vidual rushing last fall.
