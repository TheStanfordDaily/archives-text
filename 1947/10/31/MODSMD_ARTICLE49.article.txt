# Farm Tankers Travel South For Troy Tilt

### BILL SWIGART 
"Sure we're going to win," said
youthful swimming mentor Tom
Haynie who was the picture of op
timism yesterday noon as he ush
ered his varsity water polo stalwarts
aboard the Daylight. The team left
for Los Angeles and a critical
weekend series with USC and UC
LA.
"All we have to do is knock off
USC in the Troy pool tomorrow af
ternoon, and repeat our last Friday's
victory over UCLA Saturday morn
ing, and we'll be sitting on top of
the league," genial Tom added.
There are, however, a few skep
tics who are inclined to take Coach
Haynie's outward appearance of op
timism with a grain of salt, and per
haps rightly so.
The Trojans, for example, boast
an impressive 9 to 7 victory over the
veteran University of California
team and have suffered no defeats
in league competition.
Led by high-scoring Dick Kol
hase, who scored four goals against
the Bears while playing with a
burst eardrum, and the fine goal
guarding of B. J "Big Man" Fin
ney, the Troymen have come up
with their strongest water polo
squad since pre-war days.
To match the terrific Stanford
speed, Harry Cameron and Don
Hanson have been promoted to the
first string, and will start at right
forward and right guard, respec
tively, against the Indians. Center
bacß Jack Erickson and left guard
Buster Bruce make up the balance
of Troy's starting line-up.
Farm Coach Haynie will counter
with Borchers, Lull, and Armstrong
at the forwards, Sala and Captain
Narver at the guads, Maurer at cen
terback, and Hester at goal — the
same starting line-up that carried
the Indians to a double win over
UCLA and Fullerton JC last week
end.
