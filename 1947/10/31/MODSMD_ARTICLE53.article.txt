# Frosh vs. Spartans In OSC Preliminary
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Frosh squads of Stanford and San Jose State clash tomorrow
morning at 11:30 in Stanford Stadium, as a preliminary to the
varsity tilt with Oregon State. Frosh coach Chuck Taylor dis
closed yesterday that the undefeated papooses will be at theii
lowest physical efficiency of the season for the Spartan fray.

Comprising the injured list are
halfbacks Holloway, Auble, La-
Crosse, Banks, and Boucher; full
backs MacLachlan and Altick; and
linemen Scott and White. Elb Puck
ett will be moved up from the third
string to handle the brunt of full
back chores.
Coach Bud Winters' Spartlet
eleven is considerably lighter than
the hefty Stanford squad, but has
demonstrated spe *d and power in
its two games this year. In their
opening dual, the Spartlets out
played the unbeaten Santa Cruz
Seahawks, a semi-pro club with
several Notre Dame lettermen in its
lineup, only to drop a I.') to 12 de
cision. They bounced back the next
week to pound out a 7 to 0 victory
over Cal Poly's frosh.
The San Jose attack, run from a
T, features light but speedy backs
and ends bolstered by an aggressive
forward wall. Ed Miller, 6'4", 230-
pound t;ickie, stands out in the
Spaitlet line. Probable starters in
the invaders' backfield will be
George Bergna, crafty signal-caller j
and accurate passer, at quarterback; i
Gil Mendoza and A 1 Clementina at !
the halfbacks; and fullback Ron !
Richardson, ISO-pound punting ace
and line plunger.

won the PAL championship three
consecutive years, and he has played
against ex-teammates in games this
year with USC and Santa Clara.
Student body president at Sequoia,
Bceger also boxed and ran the 440.
RAY GALVIN (5'9"-200 Guard)
Galvin is one of the few easterners
on the frosh squad. Prepping at
Tilden Tech in Chicago, which has
won the city championship five of
the last six years, Ray made all
city and received all-state mention.
Galvin also wrestled at Tilden.
FRED CHEZ (5'10"-178 Center)
Chez played center and quarterback
for Medford High School, which
placed third in the state of Oregon
last year. He also played basket

Frosh squads of Stanford and San Jose State clash tomorrow
morning at 11:30 in Stanford Stadium, as a preliminary to the
varsity tilt with Oregon State. Frosh coach Chuck Taylor dis
closed yesterday that the undefeated papooses will be at theii
lowest physical efficiency of the season for the Spartan fray.

Comprising the injured list are
halfbacks Holloway, Auble, La-
Crosse, Banks, and Boucher; full
backs MacLachlan and Altick; and
linemen Scott and White. Elb Puck
ett will be moved up from the third
string to handle the brunt of full
back chores.
Coach Bud Winters' Spartlet
eleven is considerably lighter than
the hefty Stanford squad, but has
demonstrated spe *d and power in
its two games this year. In their
opening dual, the Spartlets out
played the unbeaten Santa Cruz
Seahawks, a semi-pro club with
several Notre Dame lettermen in its
lineup, only to drop a I.') to 12 de
cision. They bounced back the next
week to pound out a 7 to 0 victory
over Cal Poly's frosh.
The San Jose attack, run from a
T, features light but speedy backs
and ends bolstered by an aggressive
forward wall. Ed Miller, 6'4", 230-
pound t;ickie, stands out in the
Spaitlet line. Probable starters in
the invaders' backfield will be
George Bergna, crafty signal-caller j
and accurate passer, at quarterback; i
Gil Mendoza and A 1 Clementina at !
the halfbacks; and fullback Ron !
Richardson, ISO-pound punting ace
and line plunger.
A quarter of the stellar Stanford
yearling linemen who have per
formed well in games to date, and
are expected to give the Spartans a
rough session tomorrow are:
808 SCOTT (6'4"-190 End)

Rangy Bob played for Fresno High
School, and last year for Kiski Prep
in Pennsylvania. At Kiski he played
against freshmen elevens of Navy,
Cornell, Pitt, and other eastern col
leges. Scott competed in the shot
put, discus, and high jump events
