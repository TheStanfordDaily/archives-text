# Want Saturday Grid Winners? Daily Dopesters Tell All
## 
### 
The Daily's prognostication de
partment, football subdivision, took
a terrible and confidence-shattering
beating on last week's game ratings.
Thirteen contests were called by
the self - styled experts but only
seven of them correctly. This dis
astrous showing plummeted their
overall percentage for the season
from a super-respectable .793 to an
only so-so .714, with a total of 30
wins, 12 losses, and 4 ties.
But the scribes, rapidly becoming
hardened to the uncertainties of col
lege football games, carry on un
daunted. They present their latest
crystal-gazings below:
STANFORD-OSC: Not even one
of the 11 experts picked the In
dians. Oregon State's backfield ver
:atility and comparatively strong
•ine make the Beavers a solid
choice.
Consensus: OSC by 1G points
UCLA - CALIFORNIA; Bruin
speed and deception against the
Bears' brute strength. Cal should
have little trouble opening holes in
UCLA's line for their backs to pour
through, and probably will grind
out a huge chunk of ground from
rushing.
However, the Bruins can and will

score from any point on the field
with their excellent pass plays and
all-the-way quick openers.
Six sportswriters favor UCLA;
five side with Cal.
Consensus: UCLA by 1 point.
USC - WASHINGTON: The Tro
jans are picking up momentum with
each game. Their 39 to 14 wallop
ing of California last week was just
a sample. If the field at Seattle is
dry, look out for a rout. If rainy
weather sets in, tab USC—but by
a much closer margin.
Consensus: USC by 1!) points.
OREGON-IDAI-IO: The Webfoots
pulled off a terrific surprise l?st
week by annihilating highly regard
ed USF, 34 to 7. Jim Aiken seems to
be on his way at Eugene after a
slow start, and Dixie Howell is be
ginning to settle back into the old
Idaho groove of defeats.
Consensus: Oregon by 24 points.
USF-SANTA CLARA: Here is a
tough one to pick. The Dons will be
fighting mad after their loss to Ore
gon, while Santa Clara should be
fresh and fit after a two-week lay
off from actual competition.
Consensus: USF by II points
MICHIGAN-ILLINOIS: The sports
staff is mad at llinois for being up
set by Purdue last week and help
ing to lower the prediction percent
age of precision.
Consensus: Michigan by 1.1 points.
NOTRE DAME-NAVY: The Irish
will be under wraps, as usual, sav
ing themselves for the Army game.
Navy will be trying hard, but there
is no place for "E" for Effort on a
football scoreboard.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 20
points.
TEXAS-SMU: Pobably the top
game of the day. Two undefeated,
united powerheuses from the
Southwest, one of the best football
areas in the country, hook up in
what should be a real thriller. SMU's
Doak Walker matches passing skill
with the Longhorns' Bobby Layne.
Something's got to give, and 10 tut
of 11 sportswriters think that
"something" will be SMU.
Consensus: Texas by (5 points.
COLUMBIA - CORNELL: Unless
the Lions are still stupefied by their
21 to 20 upset over Army last week
they should have an easy time with
Cornell.
Consensus: Columbia by 12 points.
