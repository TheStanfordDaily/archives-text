An Excom member must be well-informed.
He has many duties to perform aside from at
tending Wednesday night meetings. He must
keep in touch with all campus activities.
Anyone attending Excom meetings would
realize this. With primary elections for three
Excom positions scheduled next Wednesday
it would seem that candidates would want to
familiarize themselves with Excom, with the
idea that he would be more capable of assum

ing his duties immediately should he win a
seat on this committee. Excom meetings are
open to all.
Only four candidates, all of them women,
were at the last Excom meeting.
Are the people planning to represent you
running just for the glory, or do they want to
take an active part in student government?
You might think about this when it's time to
X your ballot Wednesday.—M.H.
