### WAYNE SARGENT 
Good morning, paupers.
Are you all looking for your G.I. checks and
monthly allowances from the old man. Pardon me
for talking like a man with a paper cerebellum.
Sometimes I wonder if college students don't form
the only true proletariat class in America. If you
are like me, your wallet is probably half way be
tween empty and absolutely. Even the administra
tion won't talk to me, which is a sure sign of in
solvency.
I sure envy the capitalists. That's any man with
more money than I. Some of these students are so
flush they can offord to play the dime jukeboxes.
On the other hand, some of the working class are
having a bad time. My neighbor, for example, is a
hod carrier and only makes $300 a week. That's
because the union won't let him work on Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday, and only half a day on Sat
urday.
"Times are getting tougher," he told me. "I'm only
managing to save $200 a week, and I'm spending all
the rest."
I naturally suggested a budget.
"What's that?" he asked, not having had the bene
fit of a college education.
"It comes from two old Lithuanian words 'budge'
and 'et' ", I told him, "and it means you give your
old lady only $50 a week, tell her to run the damn
house, and you salt the rest away in the bank."

I hope it will work out for the poor soul, but with
me a budget is merely a way of worrying before I
spend my money instead of after.
There are only two bright lights on the horizon
of poverty. The first is I've found out how to beat
the parking meters downtown and get anywhere from
30 to 60 minutes for a penny. Now if I only had
money enough to buy a car.
The second is that if I read enough books on
poetry I can probably win a free meal at Longbarn.
Hey Eddie, how do you like this one:
To the tables down at Eddie's, where the poets
all eat free,
To the tables filled with things to eat so swell
I don't know about the menu,
And doubtless it is fine,
One thing I know for sure —the poets smell.
Just a little something I rattled off, Eddie. If you
don't like it just let it lay there and die. I don't have
to do that sort of thing in order to eat, you know.
Not until tomorrow, anyway.
But money isn't everything, as long as you've got
dough. I've noticed that the people who say money
is the root of the tree of evil, are the first to buy fer
tilizer.
Or, as the old financial sage, Herman Schmiddling
says, money doesn't buy happiness—it merely eases
the sorrow of unhappiness.

the rest."
I naturally suggested a budget.
"What's that?" he asked, not having had the bene
fit of a college education.
"It comes from two old Lithuanian words 'budge'
and 'et' ", I told him, "and it means you give your
old lady only $50 a week, tell her to run the damn
house, and you salt the rest away in the bank."

I hope it will work out for the poor soul, but with
me a budget is merely a way of worrying before I
spend my money instead of after.
There are only two bright lights on the horizon
of poverty. The first is I've found out how to beat
the parking meters downtown and get anywhere from
30 to 60 minutes for a penny. Now if I only had
money enough to buy a car.
The second is that if I read enough books on
poetry I can probably win a free meal at Longbarn.
Hey Eddie, how do you like this one:
To the tables down at Eddie's, where the poets
all eat free,
To the tables filled with things to eat so swell
I don't know about the menu,
And doubtless it is fine,
One thing I know for sure —the poets smell.
Just a little something I rattled off, Eddie. If you
don't like it just let it lay there and die. I don't have
to do that sort of thing in order to eat, you know.
Not until tomorrow, anyway.
But money isn't everything, as long as you've got
dough. I've noticed that the people who say money
is the root of the tree of evil, are the first to buy fer
tilizer.
Or, as the old financial sage, Herman Schmiddling
says, money doesn't buy happiness—it merely eases
the sorrow of unhappiness.
Good morning, paupers.
Are you all looking for your G.I. checks and
monthly allowances from the old man. Pardon me
for talking like a man with a paper cerebellum.
Sometimes I wonder if college students don't form
the only true proletariat class in America. If you
are like me, your wallet is probably half way be
tween empty and absolutely. Even the administra
tion won't talk to me, which is a sure sign of in
solvency.
I sure envy the capitalists. That's any man with
more money than I. Some of these students are so
flush they can offord to play the dime jukeboxes.
On the other hand, some of the working class are
having a bad time. My neighbor, for example, is a
hod carrier and only makes $300 a week. That's
because the union won't let him work on Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday, and only half a day on Sat
urday.
"Times are getting tougher," he told me. "I'm only
managing to save $200 a week, and I'm spending all
the rest."
I naturally suggested a budget.
"What's that?" he asked, not having had the bene
fit of a college education.
"It comes from two old Lithuanian words 'budge'
and 'et' ", I told him, "and it means you give your
