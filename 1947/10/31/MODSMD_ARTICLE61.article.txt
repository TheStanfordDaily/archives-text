# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In his zeal to express his personal analysis and
views on PCA, Hardin Holmes' letter of last Thurs
day strayed from the issue put forth in the various
Campus Opinion letters he refers to. Generally those
letters had not raised the issue of any specific po
litical group, but rather the question of whether or
not students should have the right to organize and
participate in political activity on campus.
His letter presents a lengthy discussion of PCA
which ends with the conclusion that "it's probably
unimportant whether any political organization meets
on campus or not.'' This statement is not borne out
by statements from those students who went abroad
under the auspices of the ISC this past summer.
Neither docs it appear to be borne out by the Campus
Opinion column, if that be any criterion.
He finally suggests a political club along patterns
of his liking. And in this respect he seems to have
joined the many other students who have indicated
their desire for political expression on campus.
However, it seems apparent that the Administration
or Excom doesn't want any political groups on cam
pus. Yet I feel sure that a large share of democratic
ally thinking students would support Mr. Holmes in
seeking recognition for such an organization that he
proposes. By all means, if there is enough student
backing to make such an organization a functioning
one, then let it be accepted on the campus. But cer
tainly that Mr. Holmes doesn't agree with tenets held
by another organization is hardly grounds for his
intimating non-recognition simultaneously coupled
with his proposal for recognition of a political or
ganization which is to his liking.
The oft repeated suggestion that students can find
outlet for their political activity in Palo Alto organi
zations seems an evasion of the issue. Political action
is not something entirely separate from academic
life. There are many who feel it is an important part
of citizenship, and citizenship does not end when you
step on campus. The university is our arena, it is
supplied with good libraries and has superior men to
comment on domestic and international affairs. Cer
tainly it is an ideal situation for intelligent political
action.
In conclusion might I say that in some respects I
can appreciate Mr. Holmes' statements concerning
"we politically immature students." However, I shall
leave it to him and to those who attended the PCA
meeting to decide from what source the immaturity
was generally manifested.

This letter is directed at the brand of pictures
and those people who arrange to have them shown to
the Stanford students at the Sunday Evening Series.
The last three pictures shown as main features at
the Memorial Auditorium have been "Garden of
Allah," "Turnabout" and "Scarlet Street." All three
have been in questionable taste as to topics and the
most recent "Scarlet Street" I regard as downright
lewd.
It used to be the complaint that the same pic
tures were shown too often, to wit, "The Prisoner of
Zenda," which was shown two quarters running,
but this current type of picture exhibition appeals
to the lower nature of the human mind. Of course
the main reason to go to the Sunday evening show

is to see how Flash Gordon eseapes from Ming's
traps, but couldn't the enjoyment of the serial be
added to by the showing of some of the old-time
hits—even if it was necessary to go as far back as
the '"Conquerors."
The exhibition of such pictures as the three men
tioned above, which have all been condemned by the
National League of Decency, seems to me to be a di
rect attempt to coin money from the baser impulses
of those who go to the movies. As such I think that
their exhibition is a reflection on the moral standards
of Stanford University.
What do you think about this? Perhaps other let
ters to "Campus Opinion" might suggest a remedy
for the showing of movies which tend to affect student
morals adversely.

Met a friend of mine the other day. His name is
George.
"Hello, George," I said.
"H'lo," said George. He put down his shovel and
leaded on it.
"What's new?" said I.
"Bud's at it again."
"Bud who?"
"Bud Keenan," said George. He bit off a chunk
of his plug and offered me some.
"You mean the LSJU Daily copyreadcr?"
"Yup," said George profoundly. "He didn't like
'The Foxes of Harrow' either."
"No?"
"Yup."
"Why not?" I asked.
"Had a woman in it. Beautiful woman."
"Is that all?"
"Nup. Had a card shark in it, too."
"NO?"
"Yup." George was pretty tired. He sat down on
his shovel. "Said the picture was coy."
"Coy, eh? How did Bud and the movie's dialogue i
agree?"
"Hopeless."
"Which one?"
George offered me a chunk of his plug again.
George looked pretty bushed.
"Why do you look so tired, George?" I asked.
"Thinkin' 'bout all the work I got to do. ShovclinV'
I tried again. "Did Bud Keenan like Maureen
O'Hara?"
George didn't say anything else for a long time.
Finally he scratched his big hairy chest and let fly
a wad of Juice of the Plug. "Bud says she's frigid,"
said George.
George looked at me for a long time. Finally he
said, "You know Bud?"
I said I didn't.
"Oh," I said.
George fought to his feet. "Got to go," said he.
"Shoveling?"
"Yup."
"Where you working now, George?"
"Well," I said, "so long, George. Say hello to Bud
for me."
"Sure," George called over his shoulder. He
clutched his gig shovel. "Bud works under me."

Met a friend of mine the other day. His name is
George.
"Hello, George," I said.
"H'lo," said George. He put down his shovel and
leaded on it.
"What's new?" said I.
"Bud's at it again."
"Bud who?"
"Bud Keenan," said George. He bit off a chunk
of his plug and offered me some.
"You mean the LSJU Daily copyreadcr?"
"Yup," said George profoundly. "He didn't like
'The Foxes of Harrow' either."
"No?"
"Yup."
"Why not?" I asked.
"Had a woman in it. Beautiful woman."
"Is that all?"
"Nup. Had a card shark in it, too."
"NO?"
"Yup." George was pretty tired. He sat down on
his shovel. "Said the picture was coy."
"Coy, eh? How did Bud and the movie's dialogue i
agree?"
"Hopeless."
"Which one?"
George offered me a chunk of his plug again.
George looked pretty bushed.
"Why do you look so tired, George?" I asked.
"Thinkin' 'bout all the work I got to do. ShovclinV'
I tried again. "Did Bud Keenan like Maureen
O'Hara?"
George didn't say anything else for a long time.
Finally he scratched his big hairy chest and let fly
a wad of Juice of the Plug. "Bud says she's frigid,"
said George.
George looked at me for a long time. Finally he
said, "You know Bud?"
I said I didn't.
"Oh," I said.
George fought to his feet. "Got to go," said he.
"Shoveling?"
"Yup."
"Where you working now, George?"
"Well," I said, "so long, George. Say hello to Bud
for me."
"Sure," George called over his shoulder. He
clutched his gig shovel. "Bud works under me."

To the Editor:
In his zeal to express his personal analysis and
views on PCA, Hardin Holmes' letter of last Thurs
day strayed from the issue put forth in the various
Campus Opinion letters he refers to. Generally those
letters had not raised the issue of any specific po
litical group, but rather the question of whether or
not students should have the right to organize and
participate in political activity on campus.
His letter presents a lengthy discussion of PCA
which ends with the conclusion that "it's probably
unimportant whether any political organization meets
on campus or not.'' This statement is not borne out
by statements from those students who went abroad
under the auspices of the ISC this past summer.
Neither docs it appear to be borne out by the Campus
Opinion column, if that be any criterion.
He finally suggests a political club along patterns
of his liking. And in this respect he seems to have
joined the many other students who have indicated
their desire for political expression on campus.
However, it seems apparent that the Administration
or Excom doesn't want any political groups on cam
pus. Yet I feel sure that a large share of democratic
ally thinking students would support Mr. Holmes in
seeking recognition for such an organization that he
proposes. By all means, if there is enough student
backing to make such an organization a functioning
one, then let it be accepted on the campus. But cer
tainly that Mr. Holmes doesn't agree with tenets held
by another organization is hardly grounds for his
intimating non-recognition simultaneously coupled
with his proposal for recognition of a political or
ganization which is to his liking.
The oft repeated suggestion that students can find
outlet for their political activity in Palo Alto organi
zations seems an evasion of the issue. Political action
is not something entirely separate from academic
life. There are many who feel it is an important part
of citizenship, and citizenship does not end when you
step on campus. The university is our arena, it is
supplied with good libraries and has superior men to
comment on domestic and international affairs. Cer
tainly it is an ideal situation for intelligent political
action.
In conclusion might I say that in some respects I
can appreciate Mr. Holmes' statements concerning
"we politically immature students." However, I shall
leave it to him and to those who attended the PCA
meeting to decide from what source the immaturity
was generally manifested.

This letter is directed at the brand of pictures
and those people who arrange to have them shown to
the Stanford students at the Sunday Evening Series.
The last three pictures shown as main features at
the Memorial Auditorium have been "Garden of
Allah," "Turnabout" and "Scarlet Street." All three
have been in questionable taste as to topics and the
most recent "Scarlet Street" I regard as downright
lewd.
It used to be the complaint that the same pic
tures were shown too often, to wit, "The Prisoner of
Zenda," which was shown two quarters running,
but this current type of picture exhibition appeals
to the lower nature of the human mind. Of course
the main reason to go to the Sunday evening show

is to see how Flash Gordon eseapes from Ming's
traps, but couldn't the enjoyment of the serial be
added to by the showing of some of the old-time
hits—even if it was necessary to go as far back as
the '"Conquerors."

Opinion column, if that be any criterion.
He finally suggests a political club along patterns
of his liking. And in this respect he seems to have
joined the many other students who have indicated
their desire for political expression on campus.
However, it seems apparent that the Administration
or Excom doesn't want any political groups on cam
pus. Yet I feel sure that a large share of democratic
ally thinking students would support Mr. Holmes in
seeking recognition for such an organization that he
proposes. By all means, if there is enough student
backing to make such an organization a functioning
one, then let it be accepted on the campus. But cer
tainly that Mr. Holmes doesn't agree with tenets held
by another organization is hardly grounds for his
intimating non-recognition simultaneously coupled
with his proposal for recognition of a political or
ganization which is to his liking.
The oft repeated suggestion that students can find
outlet for their political activity in Palo Alto organi
zations seems an evasion of the issue. Political action
is not something entirely separate from academic
life. There are many who feel it is an important part
of citizenship, and citizenship does not end when you
step on campus. The university is our arena, it is
supplied with good libraries and has superior men to
comment on domestic and international affairs. Cer
tainly it is an ideal situation for intelligent political
action.
In conclusion might I say that in some respects I
can appreciate Mr. Holmes' statements concerning
"we politically immature students." However, I shall
leave it to him and to those who attended the PCA
meeting to decide from what source the immaturity
was generally manifested.

This letter is directed at the brand of pictures
and those people who arrange to have them shown to
the Stanford students at the Sunday Evening Series.
The last three pictures shown as main features at
the Memorial Auditorium have been "Garden of
Allah," "Turnabout" and "Scarlet Street." All three
have been in questionable taste as to topics and the
most recent "Scarlet Street" I regard as downright
lewd.
It used to be the complaint that the same pic
tures were shown too often, to wit, "The Prisoner of
Zenda," which was shown two quarters running,
but this current type of picture exhibition appeals
to the lower nature of the human mind. Of course
the main reason to go to the Sunday evening show

is to see how Flash Gordon eseapes from Ming's
traps, but couldn't the enjoyment of the serial be
added to by the showing of some of the old-time
hits—even if it was necessary to go as far back as
the '"Conquerors."
The exhibition of such pictures as the three men
tioned above, which have all been condemned by the
National League of Decency, seems to me to be a di
rect attempt to coin money from the baser impulses
of those who go to the movies. As such I think that
their exhibition is a reflection on the moral standards
of Stanford University.
What do you think about this? Perhaps other let
ters to "Campus Opinion" might suggest a remedy
for the showing of movies which tend to affect student
morals adversely.

Met a friend of mine the other day. His name is
George.
"Hello, George," I said.
"H'lo," said George. He put down his shovel and
leaded on it.
"What's new?" said I.
"Bud's at it again."
"Bud who?"
"Bud Keenan," said George. He bit off a chunk
of his plug and offered me some.
"You mean the LSJU Daily copyreadcr?"
"Yup," said George profoundly. "He didn't like
'The Foxes of Harrow' either."
"No?"
"Yup."
"Why not?" I asked.
"Had a woman in it. Beautiful woman."
"Is that all?"
"Nup. Had a card shark in it, too."
"NO?"
"Yup." George was pretty tired. He sat down on
his shovel. "Said the picture was coy."
"Coy, eh? How did Bud and the movie's dialogue i
agree?"
"Hopeless."
"Which one?"
George offered me a chunk of his plug again.
George looked pretty bushed.
"Why do you look so tired, George?" I asked.
"Thinkin' 'bout all the work I got to do. ShovclinV'
I tried again. "Did Bud Keenan like Maureen
O'Hara?"
George didn't say anything else for a long time.
Finally he scratched his big hairy chest and let fly
a wad of Juice of the Plug. "Bud says she's frigid,"
said George.
George looked at me for a long time. Finally he
said, "You know Bud?"
I said I didn't.
"Oh," I said.
George fought to his feet. "Got to go," said he.
"Shoveling?"
"Yup."
"Where you working now, George?"
"Well," I said, "so long, George. Say hello to Bud
for me."
"Sure," George called over his shoulder. He
clutched his gig shovel. "Bud works under me."

In his zeal to express his personal analysis and
views on PCA, Hardin Holmes' letter of last Thurs
day strayed from the issue put forth in the various
Campus Opinion letters he refers to. Generally those
letters had not raised the issue of any specific po
litical group, but rather the question of whether or
not students should have the right to organize and
participate in political activity on campus.
His letter presents a lengthy discussion of PCA
which ends with the conclusion that "it's probably
unimportant whether any political organization meets
on campus or not.'' This statement is not borne out
by statements from those students who went abroad
under the auspices of the ISC this past summer.
