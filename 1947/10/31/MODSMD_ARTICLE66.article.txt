### 
Float ideas for the Big Game
Homecoming parade must be signed
up at the ASSU office by 5 this af
ternoon, stated Phyllis Graham,
float chairman for Cardinals, which
is sponsoring Homecoming.
No duplications will be allowed,
and houses should check the sign
up list to see that someone else has
not already used their idea.
Floats should be fireproof if they
are to carry torches. In this case
the fire chief should be contacted.
