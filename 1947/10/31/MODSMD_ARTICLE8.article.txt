# Labor and Originality Are Trumps When Rally Com Shuffles Cards
## 
### AL BERRY 
The back room of Rossotti's hum
med with unusual activity. A dozen
members of Stanford's industrious
Rally Committee sat with bowed
heads around the long foam-cov
ered table. Suddenly one leaped to
is feet. "I've got it,"he yelled. "We
have a bear, see? Then we have an
Indian with a bottle of selzer water,
sec? Then they flip, and the Indian
is . .
"No!" shouted Dave Heyler, Pally
Com chairman. "Already it sounds
like an SC stunt."
Thus admonished, the frosh try
outee slunk back to his chair, and
the group returned to their brain
busting business of planning the
coming Saturday's card stunts.
Ever since that day in late No
vember, 192.'', when Stanford card
stunts first blasted their way into
ill-famed Strawberry Canyon, the
Farmers have built and maintained
the tradition of good and often great
card stunts. The responsibility for
maintaining this tradition falls to
the Farm's industrious Rally Com
mittee, who every football season
spend many long hours and sleep
less nights in wild efforts to perfect
and put on these half-time shows.
The toughest thing about Stanford
card stunts, according to Rally' Com
co-chairman Barbara Carter, is to
keep them original. New ideas have
to be conceived every week, and
once conceived put into action. Al
tly> ugh Stanfordites arc notorious
for thinking, bright ideas for stunts
are not as easy to manufacture as
dates on history testa.

"About a dozen of us get together
in some relaxing place," explained
chairman Heyler, "and dream up
and talk out ideas."
Heyler lit a cigarette and pointed
to the piles of graph paper which
littered the Rally Com oflice. "To
give an overall picture, each stunt
is sketched in full color on this
graph paper. Each square repre
sents a rooter in the rooting section,
so it is fairly easy to keep track of
what color for what stunt belongs
to which person sitting where."
When the ideas of the "brain
committee" have beert developed,
slashed, and accepted, the hours of
hard work and manual labor begin.
For a week before the stunt is to be
presented nearly the entire Rally
Committee work nine to ten hours
a day sorting cards, and writing the
card color scheme on the instruc
tion cards.
Dave Heyler looked tired; he
ground out his cigarette on the floor,
and continued. "It's hard to realize
just how much there is to do until
you stop to realize that each stunt
uses 2,040 cards. In the last UCLA
game we had 14 stunts; that makes
28.560 card color combinations. The
Cal game often has up to 30 stunts.
Thirty times 2,010 gives you way
over 01,000. Sixty-one thousand
card flashes is a lot of flashes and a
lot of cards."
"It makes a lot of work for us,"
smiled brown-eyed Barbara Carter,
but when the rooters co-operate
like they did for the UCLA game,
it's worth it."

Ever since that day in late No
vember, 192.'', when Stanford card
stunts first blasted their way into
ill-famed Strawberry Canyon, the
Farmers have built and maintained
the tradition of good and often great
card stunts. The responsibility for
maintaining this tradition falls to
the Farm's industrious Rally Com
mittee, who every football season
spend many long hours and sleep
less nights in wild efforts to perfect
and put on these half-time shows.
The toughest thing about Stanford
card stunts, according to Rally' Com
co-chairman Barbara Carter, is to
keep them original. New ideas have
to be conceived every week, and
once conceived put into action. Al
tly> ugh Stanfordites arc notorious
for thinking, bright ideas for stunts
are not as easy to manufacture as
dates on history testa.

"About a dozen of us get together
in some relaxing place," explained
chairman Heyler, "and dream up
and talk out ideas."
Heyler lit a cigarette and pointed
to the piles of graph paper which
littered the Rally Com oflice. "To
give an overall picture, each stunt
is sketched in full color on this
graph paper. Each square repre
sents a rooter in the rooting section,
so it is fairly easy to keep track of
what color for what stunt belongs
to which person sitting where."
When the ideas of the "brain
committee" have beert developed,
slashed, and accepted, the hours of
hard work and manual labor begin.
For a week before the stunt is to be
presented nearly the entire Rally
Committee work nine to ten hours
a day sorting cards, and writing the
card color scheme on the instruc
tion cards.
Dave Heyler looked tired; he
ground out his cigarette on the floor,
and continued. "It's hard to realize
just how much there is to do until
you stop to realize that each stunt
uses 2,040 cards. In the last UCLA
game we had 14 stunts; that makes
28.560 card color combinations. The
Cal game often has up to 30 stunts.
Thirty times 2,010 gives you way
over 01,000. Sixty-one thousand
card flashes is a lot of flashes and a
lot of cards."
"It makes a lot of work for us,"
smiled brown-eyed Barbara Carter,
but when the rooters co-operate
like they did for the UCLA game,
it's worth it."

The back room of Rossotti's hum

members of Stanford's industrious
Rally Committee sat with bowed
heads around the long foam-cov

is feet. "I've got it,"he yelled. "We
have a bear, see? Then we have an
Indian with a bottle of selzer water,
sec? Then they flip, and the Indian
is . .
"No!" shouted Dave Heyler, Pally
Com chairman. "Already it sounds
like an SC stunt."
Thus admonished, the frosh try
outee slunk back to his chair, and
the group returned to their brain
busting business of planning the
coming Saturday's card stunts.
