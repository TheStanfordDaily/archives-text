# Joke?

(Editorial)
There's nothing like a good
joke.
But when the joke steps on
the toes of a lot of hard-working
and well-meaning people the
humor is lost.
A small group of Stanford
"Roughs" has planned a rally
for the Stanford bridge team to
morrow. Presumably the rea
son for the rally is to spur the
cardplayers on in their coming
tournament with Cal Saturday.
It is evident, however, that
there is an underlying reason.
Perhaps the scheme is a protest
against Rally Corn's action in
not staging a rally for the Stan
ford - Oregon State football
game.
Whatever the reason, the
"joke" puts Rally Com, the Stan
ford football team, and the
Bridge Club in a bad light.
This group, under the lead
ership of "Head Cheer Leader"
Tom Elke has planned to hold
their rally at 11:50 today on the
steps of the Education Building.
They promise, according to
Elke, to present musicians,
yells, songs, and a talk by
"Coach Culbertson Blackwood"
to emphasize their slogan "Re
double the Bears."
It remains to be seen whether
the Stanford campus will take
it as a "joke," or whether their
reaction will be that Rally Com,
the Stanford football team, and
the Bridge Club have been
made ridiculous.—D.D.
