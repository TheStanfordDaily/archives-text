# Stanford Male Chorus Will Perform With SF Symphony at Opera House
## 
### 
Stanford's chorus will sing with
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra during the regular sym
phonic season in the San Francisco
Opera House, Professor William
Crosten, head of the Music Depart
ment, announced yesterday.
Pierre Monteux, conductor, and
Howard Skinne, manager, invited
the University to supply 100 male
voices for three concerts on Feb. 19,
20, and 21 for the Faust Symphony
by Franz Liszt. This will mark the
first appearance of a Stanford group
in the Opera House for the annual
concert series.
Howard Schmidt, associate pro
fessor of music and director of the
University Chorus, will organize the
new choral group. Members will be
recruited from the Glee Club, Uni
versity Chorus, Choir, and campus
at large. Rehearsals are expected
to begin late in November.
The Faust Symphony is consid
ered one of Liszt's most mature j
musical works, but it is rarely 1
heard because of its unusual choral
demands for the final movement.
These include a tenor solo as well
as the male chorus.
The three concerts in which the |

Stanford chorus will appear will be
directed by William Steinberg, con

ductor of the Buffalo Symphony
Orchestra, who will be guest con
ductor in the absence of Pierre
Monteux.
Mr. Schmidt, director of the cho
rus, came to Stanford this fall as
an experienced choral director. He
served as head of the music de
partment and choir conductor at
Western College and Fisk Univer
sity, supplying choruses for the Cin
cinnati Symphony Orchestra. He
formerly directed the Harvard Glee
Club which sang with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Schmidt
studied advanced conducting with
Eugene Goosens, director of the
Cincinnati Symphony, after study
ing choral conducting in Italy and
at Harvard.
Professor Crosten considers this
"a wonderful opportunity for Stan
ford students to sing with a major
symphony orchestra, giving them a
chance to see one of the world's
finest symphonies at close range."
Further plans are being discussed
for a large work for mixed chorus
to be presented by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, using
the Stanford University choral re
sources.
