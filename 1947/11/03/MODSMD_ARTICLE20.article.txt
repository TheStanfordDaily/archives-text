# English Tories Defeat Labor
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 2 UP).—Jubilant
Conservatives called tonight for a
general election—as the result of a
smashing Labor defeat in the na
tional election for municipal coun
cilors.
With results from parts of only
two boroughs missing out of 392, the
Conservatives had won a net gain
of 618 seats on English and Welsh
borough councils and the Laborites
had lost 644.
The importance of the first big
Conservative victory since the end
of the war was increased by the
fact that the entire campaign was
waged on national issues which
would be the basis for a parlia
tary election.
But the Labor government indi
cated strongly that, with a top
heavy majority and more than 2 x /i
years to go before the life of this
Parliament ends, it would stick to
office. Only a Commons defeat on
a major issue—a defeat involving
the desertion of its own supporters
—or a Labor decision to tftst na
tional sentiment could bring the
election which the Conservatives
want.
Latest returns showed the follow
ing results in the election, held
Saturday:
