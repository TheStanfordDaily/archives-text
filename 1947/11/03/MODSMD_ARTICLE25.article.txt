# Division of Corridors Planned for Encina
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Something is finally going to be done to separate Encina men into
small groups. For years there has been talk of an "entry system," and now,
according to planning director Eldridge T. Spencer, a modified form of
that system will be instituted.
In 1892, one year after the University's opening, ex-president White

of Cornell wrote this letter to the
Stan fords concerning Encina:
"For a family hotel, the hall is
perfect . . . but the fundamental
principle in erecting dormitories for
students is separation and segrega
tion. It is the practical outcome of
all experience here and at all other
universities in the world. In all
these institutions, old and new, the
plan is now adopted of having 'en
tries' with short cross halls and
stairs from top to bottom of the
building and only two to four dou
ble rooms at most on each landing.
This makes it difficult for students
to do much visiting with each other
. . . and the temptation towards too
much social enjoyment, with its
waste of time and suggestions of
mischief, is greatly decreased."
WHITE VISITS ENCINA
Dr. White gathered the informa
tion for the above letter while room
ing with the Encinaites during the
year previous to his report.
A solution to the problem was
formulated by the Board of Trustees
and presented to the faculty in 1905.
Their report read:
"The building is so constructed
as to invite disturbances, with long
halls and no partitions in the halls.
We are inclined to think that it
would be a good policy to spend a
lew thousand dollars in dividing the
building into three separate parts,
after which it would be easier to
control the students.
PROPOSAL IGNORED
This proposal, although it was or
iginated by such an official body
as the Board, failed to receive any
attention. In fact, between 1905 and
1941 there had been no decisive ac
tion taken in regard to the "entry"
question.
"It was in 1941," states Mr. Spenc
er, "that the present plan had its
real beginning. Since that time it
has been fully outlined and ap
proved. When the go-ahead signal
comes, we will be able to start con
struction immediately."
"ENCINA LIKE MOB"
In attempting to clarify reasons for
the undertaking, Mr. Spencer said:

"As a result of its large enrollment
and corridor arrangement, Encina
today is too much like one big mob.
A prime reason for dividing the
building into specific divisions with
separate entries, is that of getling
the students into smaller groups.
Thus, in one of these smaller groups,
the student will easily be able to
acquaint himself with the men
around him and thereby get a better,
more friendly, initiation into the
Stanford family pattern of campus
life."
The Director also said that the
division will insure, to a greater de
gree than at present, the safety of
the occupants.
WALLS ADDED
Mr. Spencer said, "The only real
alteration in Encina's construction
will be the inclusion of walls from
front to rear dividing the four sec
tions. From the outside, the build
ing will look virtually the same."
"The cost of the job," he said,
"will run roughly up into the hun
dreds of thousands, a far cry from
the "few thousand," the 1905 Board
of Trustees had figured on. Of
course, the total cost will represent
not only the partitions, but also the
work done in redecorating and re
furnishing the rooms "which are
in such dire need of repairs."
Mr. Spencer said that the business
office is waiting for costs to stabil
ize before giving the go-ahead sig
nal.
