# Cal Wins Flying Meet; Stanford Places Fourth
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Old Man Weather pushed four California flying clubs all around (he
Livermore Naval Air Station Saturday during the first postwar Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Air Meet. By the time Jupe Pluvius had dropped
the last of his rain, the meet was over with the University of California,
UCLA, San Jose State, and Stanford finishing in that order.
The meet never was too strong a contest. Thirty mile-an-hour winds

and driving rain squalls did not give
pilots a chance to fly their small 65
horsepower ships creditably.
ENJOYED FLYING
At any rate, all 50 participating
pilots enjoyed their flying. Stanford
was far off form with 135 points,
but California's 225 points were not
indicative of that team's flying dur
ing the day. Actually the best team
in proficiency was San Jose State
with 75 points plus another 74 count
ers in accuracy for a 149 total.
UCLA's score totaled 206 points.
California took four trophies back
to Berkeley after winning the level
bombing, barrier landing, and 180-
degree spot landing events and the
grand prize cup the Perpetual
Trophy—for taking the meet.
STANFORD SCORED
Second-place UCLA won the fifth
and sixth cup by v/inning the dive
bombing event. Third-place San
Jose State earned the most profic
iency points and the seventh trophy
after following flight rules better
than the other teams.
Stanford scored in every event—
both in proficiency and ability. In
the level bombing Warren Noteware
placed eighth out of the 12 pilots
with nine points. Jim Reed gathered
in eight counters, and Phyllis Riley
added four more to Stanford's score.
Jay McNeese, the Farm's high
scorer of the meet with Jim Reed,
won 23 points and third place in the
180-degree spot landings event.
Lori'y Lokey took fourth place and
16 points, while five more points
were added by Martin Vitousek.
Only one flyur from each team
participated in the six-foot string

barrier landing event. Ray Elsmore
snagged 20 points for the team in
that contest.
SPOT LANDINGS
On the 360-degree spot landings
McNeece took sixth place and nine
points, and Lokey held seventh
place with another nine points.
In the final event Farm flyer Jim
Reed tied McNeese in team points
by placing third in the event to win
32 points for Stanford.
