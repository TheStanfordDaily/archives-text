# Delts and Village 208 Winners In Saturday's Mural Football
## 
### 
Old Jupiter Pluvius, who even
reigns in California, turned all but
one of the Farm's scheduled Sat
urday mural football games into
complete washouts. In that contest
the more aquable Delta Upsilon
in udders out-navigated the El Toro
team 20 to 7.
Finding their land attack bogged
down due to weather conditions, the
Delts took to the skyways with
Jake Preston hitting his mud
packed receivers for three touch
downs and two conversions. The El
Toro seven proved to be the more
amphibious of the two, but except
for one long Rael-to-Kreiter pass,
they were unable to slide past the
Delts' defensive blockade.
In the only other game on Sat
urday, Village 208 beat Encina 2E,
7 to 6, in a playoff of a game that
had been scheduled for the previous
Tuesday*.

a touchdown shortly afterward. An
other interception, this time by Milt
Iverson, accounted for the second of
the Delts' scores.

Old Jupiter Pluvius, who even
reigns in California, turned all but
one of the Farm's scheduled Sat
urday mural football games into
complete washouts. In that contest
the more aquable Delta Upsilon
in udders out-navigated the El Toro
team 20 to 7.

down due to weather conditions, the
Delts took to the skyways with
Jake Preston hitting his mud
packed receivers for three touch
downs and two conversions. The El
Toro seven proved to be the more
amphibious of the two, but except
for one long Rael-to-Kreiter pass,
they were unable to slide past the
Delts' defensive blockade.
In the only other game on Sat
urday, Village 208 beat Encina 2E,
7 to 6, in a playoff of a game that
had been scheduled for the previous
Tuesday*.
