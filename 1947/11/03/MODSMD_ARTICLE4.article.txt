The Cal bridge team gained pos
session of the "Hatchet" Saturday
evening by trouncing the Stanford
duplicate bridge team at Stanford
Village, 882-678. In spite of the pep
slogans and spirited rally staged on
Friday, the local bridge players
were outclassed by the Cal men
who gained 15 out of the 26 high
hands.
High honors for the evening went
to Cal's Hans Ury. Also starring
for the Bears' triumphant team was
P. J. Smith, 1946 intercollegiate
bridge champion of the United
States. Mrs. Constance Ralston,
Cal's professional bridge coach, has
produced many experts in the Bay
area.
Herbert Hawk and Clark Palmer
were the outstanding contestants
for the home forces.
At the conclusion of the eve
ning, prizes and refreshments were
served. The two teams will meet
again at Berkeley during the spring
quarter.
