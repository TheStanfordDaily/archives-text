# Dons Whip Santa Clara
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 2 (UP).â€”
1 Dynamic little Forrest Hall, a mod
ern day "galloping ghost," fired up
a faltering University of San Fran
cisco eleven today for a second half
onslaught that crushed Santa Clara
20 to 9 before 40.000 fans in Kezar
I stadium.
i
The swift, fiery 155-pound half
back from Oil City. Pa., brought the
Dons from behind late in the third
quarter with a series of dazzling
runs that set up two touchdowns
and demoralized the bewildered
Santa Clarans. .
i San Francisco's decisive victory
over its Bay Area neighbor was the
first for the Dons since 1931 in a long
and bitter rivalry.
Coach Ed McKeever hugged and
kissed Hall emotionally after the
students carried Hall and McKeever
on their shoulders in a jubilant vic
tory parade as the game ended.
