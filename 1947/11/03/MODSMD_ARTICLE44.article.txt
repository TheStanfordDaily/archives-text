# Cardinals Show Improvement
## 
### BILL ALLEN BOB CATUDIO 
Stanford's Indians lost another game Saturday.
But they looked better in defeat than they have all season.
They put together 60 minutes of good football in losing to Ore
gon State, 13 to 7, and the score might just as easily have been
reversed.
The Cardinals have three tough games remaining on their

schedule, and their performance in
the Oregon State tilt makes it seem
possible that they will salvage
something from a dismal season by
winning one of them.
This week will be the toughest of
all, for the Indians travel south to
meet Southern California.
BLOCKED KICK WINS
Oregon State's margin of victory
was a blocked kick in the waning
minutes of the first half.
After almost a full half in which
each team had threatened but nei
ther had been able to score, the
Redskins had the ball, fourth down
on their own 24.
Mike Durket was sent in to punt,
but three OSC linemen, led by left
tackle A 1 Puddy, knifed through the
Stanford line, which, ironically,
gave Durket the best protection he
has had all year during most of the
game.
SAMUEL SCORES
Puddy blocked the kick, and the
Beavers took over on the Stanford
15. They went over in four plays,
Don Samuel going through left
tackle from the thm? for the score,
with one minute to play in the half.
The Northerners made their sec
ond touchdown early in the fourth
quarter. After keeping Stanford in
the hole through most of the third
period, OSC took over the ball on
the Indians' 45 when Samuel made
a nice runback of Durket's quick
kick. Eight plays and a timely pen
alty on Stanford were needed for
the visitors to score from that
point.
The Indians still had ten minutes
in which to tie or win the game,
and they went right at it with a
71 -yard drive to paydirt after the
kickoff.
CARDS DRIVE
Bob Anderson brought Simas'
boot back to his own 29, and the
Cards started to move. First it was
Martin Anderson at left tackle for
10 and a first down, and again for
five. Then Don Campbell hit the
same spot for six, and the Indians
had a first down at midfield.
Two plays later they were back
on their own 35 after a 15-yard
penalty for illegal use of hands.
It looked like another typical
abortive Stanford drive, but this
time it was diffei-ent. An Oregon
State offside brought the Indians
five yards, and one pass was in
complete.
KEEP UP DRIVE
Third and 20. and Bell gave the
ball to Marty Anderson on a beau
tiful fake pass, delayed buck hand
off which went for 15 yards. Then,
fourth and five, Bell tossed a sharp
pass down the middle to Bob Ghi
lotti for the required yardage and
10 extra.
First and 10 on the 30. Bell threw
one incomplete, but on the next
play it was Marty Anderson on the

same delayed buck for 17 yards and
a first down on the 13.
From here, the Anderson lads
took the ball over in three plays,
the payoff coming on Marty's pretty
end sweep from the lour. End Dan
Mervin kicked the extra point.
BREAKS STOP MARCHES
Aside from a first-half threat and
their touchdown drive, the Indians'
offensive bogged down before it was
well started throughout the game.
Always there was something â€” a
penalty, a fumble, or an intercep
tion.
Even so, improvement in back
field play was apparent. Bob An
derson was being sprung into the
clear on end runs, and he, Martin
Anderson, Don Zappetini, and
George Quist were effective through
the line.
The Stanford line played a game
which nobody could have expected
of them off their previous showings.
They were charging, blocking, and
tackling hard and well. Aided by
great line-backing by George Quist,
they held the Beavers to 83 yards
gained on the ground.
Threatening rains which kept the
crowd down to about 8,000 persons
materialized intermittently through
out the game, but the field was not
so wet as to seriously handicap or
aid either team.

"Oregon State has a fine, sharp,
short passing game," Schwartz de
clared. "And a lot of teams will
have a tough time trying to stop
Samuel and Carpenter."
He singled out as unfortunte the
blocked kick in the second quarter
which led to Oregon State's first
touchdown. "And that quick kick
of Durket's was a rarity. You sel
dom see a ball bounce back toward
the kicker on one of those."

The Farm's poloists saw no action
Saturday morning, for their sched
uled match with the Oakland Alder
ette squad was postponed because
of rain.

There may be no joy in Mudville, but the Stanford Indians,
despite dropping their sixth straight game, are beginning to
smarten up. "They (the Cards) played a swell game today and
I'm proud of them," Marchie Schwartz said.
The Indian head man was smiling for the first time in six

| game since 1942.
"Zap played a good game. I sorta
figured he could do the job. Quist
played a marvelous game. Our ends
played well.
"Our tackling and blocking have
improved 100 per cent. We're still
out to win a ball game, and we're
i not through yet."


MICKEY TITUS, seeing action
for the first time since tlie Michi
gan game, started the second half
at fullback, but reinsured his
knee on the lirst scrimmage play
and is out again indefinitely.
