# KSU Trounced By Pied Typers
## 
### 
A clean - living septet of "All-
American Boys" from The Daily
j soundly trounced a "semi - pro"
football outfit representing KSU, 8
to 6, in the annual Propaganda Bow'
classic Friday afternoon on one of
the campus intramural gridirons.
The journalists tallied early in the
first half on a long pass from
Eiselt to Jack Cashel, standing deep
in the end zone.
Then, a few minutes later, The
Daily's hard-charging line trapped
a KSU ball-carrier behind his own
goal line for a safety and the two
winning points.
