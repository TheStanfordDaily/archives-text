# A 						Healthy Sign
## 
### 
Stanford fraternities have again proven that
they can work out their own problems with
out Administration or ASSU interference.
The action of the Interfraternity Board last
week in fining two of its member houses is a
healthy sign. By taking the initiative in a
practical effort to improve their status in the
eyes of others, the fraternities have reaffirmed
their desire to continue as a strong and con
structive part of the Stanford campus.
The Interfraternity Council and the Board
have not taken primary control away from
the individual houses. Their aim is rather to

back up the houses and to take action only
when it is necessary to eliminate behavior
which would give fraternities in general an
unsavory reputation.
A second constructive action was taken by
the Board last week. Its rulings were changed
so that now a pledge who is minus may move
into a house. By doing this the fraternities will
have the opportunity to prove that they can
cope with scholastic problems.
The fraternities' policy points the way for
other student living groups and organizations
to meet their own problems without outside
interference.—D.D.
