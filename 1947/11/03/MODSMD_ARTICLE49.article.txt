What with the male to female ratio as it is, dating
is becoming a competitive sport.
And there are lots of men who couldn't stand the
competition so they legalized the girl-friend into a
wife and hoard her away in a most parsimonious
fashion. Sometimes they allow her to run down to
the store once a day to buy a head of lettuce or
something. Anyway, women certainly are scarce.
The point I'm leading up to is that amongst the
men left there is a feeling of rivalry and there are
bound to be men left over without women.
This, of course, has led them to make the state
ment that Stanford women are as ugly as a Hearst
editorial. This sour grapes statement makes them
feel better about the fact that they couldn't get a
coed to go out with them.
The relative ugliness and beauty of Stanford wo
men is a question which I have no inclination to
debate. I don't feel it's too dogmatic to say, however,
that most Stanford girls are the kind of girl men
like, providing you're the kind of man that likes
that kind of a girl.
The point in tow is if you're a man (and about 50
percent of the population can meet the qualification
biologically) you've got to have something on the ball
to get a coed.
Among these are: Good looks, fat bankroll, good
approach, fine character, fat bankroll, astute mind,
or fat bankroll.
On some of these it is too late to make improve
ments. Your mother should have thought of them
when you were but a gleam in father's eye. Some
times there are insurmountable odds. I know one un
popular boy who spent a year getting rid of halitosis
only to find out that wasn't the reason he was un
popular. It was because he had two heads.
There is one of the aforementioned attributes

which can be improved, however —namely the ap
proach.
Take, for example, the ruffian who upon being in
troduced to a girl, slaps her resoundingly on the rear
saying:
"Hello girlie, I think you got something there.
Your face is familiar but 112 can't quite place your
body."
He then fragments himself into spasms of laugh
ter while the rest of the group stands around em
barrassed.
You just don't do that sort of thing anymore, un
less of course, you are a fraternity pledge, or an
American Legionnaire at a convention.
Your introduction has got to be smooth like:
"Toss us your flipper kiddo, I go for your kind."
Or if people arc dancing say:
"Well mur-r-r-r-der chick, let's borrow your
carcass for the next struggle, and collar some of
these righteous kicks."
See what I mean. Something that puts everyone at
ease and lets them know that here is a poised gen
tleman:
As my dear old father used to say, "Son"—(he
always called me that—sort of a nickname) "Son,
every so often you've got to take inventory of your
self."
And I do just that. During last month's inven
tory I found two extra toes and a hangnail that
weren't there before.
I'm not sure that's exactly what old Dad meant,
but I'm telling you men to take inventory of your
collective approach if you want to get yourself a
coed.
And if you prefer checkers, call me any evening
for a game—l'm home practically every night.

biologically) you've got to have something on the ball
to get a coed.
Among these are: Good looks, fat bankroll, good
approach, fine character, fat bankroll, astute mind,
or fat bankroll.
On some of these it is too late to make improve
ments. Your mother should have thought of them
when you were but a gleam in father's eye. Some
times there are insurmountable odds. I know one un
popular boy who spent a year getting rid of halitosis
only to find out that wasn't the reason he was un
popular. It was because he had two heads.
There is one of the aforementioned attributes

which can be improved, however —namely the ap
proach.
Take, for example, the ruffian who upon being in
troduced to a girl, slaps her resoundingly on the rear
saying:
"Hello girlie, I think you got something there.
Your face is familiar but 112 can't quite place your
body."
He then fragments himself into spasms of laugh
ter while the rest of the group stands around em
barrassed.
You just don't do that sort of thing anymore, un
less of course, you are a fraternity pledge, or an
American Legionnaire at a convention.
Your introduction has got to be smooth like:
"Toss us your flipper kiddo, I go for your kind."
Or if people arc dancing say:
"Well mur-r-r-r-der chick, let's borrow your
carcass for the next struggle, and collar some of
these righteous kicks."
See what I mean. Something that puts everyone at
ease and lets them know that here is a poised gen
tleman:
As my dear old father used to say, "Son"—(he
always called me that—sort of a nickname) "Son,
every so often you've got to take inventory of your
self."
And I do just that. During last month's inven
tory I found two extra toes and a hangnail that
weren't there before.
I'm not sure that's exactly what old Dad meant,
but I'm telling you men to take inventory of your
collective approach if you want to get yourself a
coed.
And if you prefer checkers, call me any evening
for a game—l'm home practically every night.
What with the male to female ratio as it is, dating
is becoming a competitive sport.
And there are lots of men who couldn't stand the
competition so they legalized the girl-friend into a
wife and hoard her away in a most parsimonious
fashion. Sometimes they allow her to run down to
the store once a day to buy a head of lettuce or
something. Anyway, women certainly are scarce.
The point I'm leading up to is that amongst the
men left there is a feeling of rivalry and there are
bound to be men left over without women.
This, of course, has led them to make the state
ment that Stanford women are as ugly as a Hearst
editorial. This sour grapes statement makes them
feel better about the fact that they couldn't get a
coed to go out with them.
The relative ugliness and beauty of Stanford wo
men is a question which I have no inclination to
debate. I don't feel it's too dogmatic to say, however,
that most Stanford girls are the kind of girl men
like, providing you're the kind of man that likes
that kind of a girl.
The point in tow is if you're a man (and about 50
percent of the population can meet the qualification
biologically) you've got to have something on the ball
