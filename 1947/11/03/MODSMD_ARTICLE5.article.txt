### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (UP).â€”
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall today refused to intervene in
the dismissal of six of his employ
ees as bad security risks although
their attorney denounced the firings
as "unfair and un-American" and
"tragically analogous" to a police
state.
Acting in Marshall's behalf, Un
der Secretary of State Robert A.
Lovett rejected the attorneys' re
quest for a personal conference
with the Secretary and turned down
their demand that the Department
either:
1. Permit the employees to resign
"without prejudice," or
2. Present the charges against
them, and grant a full hearing with
the right of cross-examination and
the presentation of witnesses to "re
fute" the allegations.
Lovett conceded that the sum
mary discharges for "security rea
sons" might make it difficult for
the employees to find other jobs,
but he said that problem is pri
marily one for the Civil Service
Commission to resolve.
Names of the dismissed workers
have not been revealed, and the at
torneys would not divulge them so
as "not to aggravate the injury to
their personal positions." The law
yers protested that the Department
has never formally charged them
with being Communists or affiliated
with any Communist organization.
