To the Editor:
Ralph Council asks for a remedy for the showing
of Sunday movies which affect student morals' ad
versely. I agree with Ralph. I just certainly do
agree with Ralph.
Now let's see. We've got to eliminate profanity
and sex and absolutely everything not in accord with
the Bible. That's quite a job, but with maybe seven
thousand students behind us you just can't tell what's
likely to happen. Can you, Ralph?
Wc can begin by burning all of the books of Hem
ingway and Steinbeck. And Noel Coward uses bad
words so we'll have to get rid of him. Then there's
Phillip Wylie. Of course, he'll have to go. Well,
there's Shakespeare—oop, no. Chaucer? Anatole
France? Maupassant? Boccaccio? Gee, this is get
ling tough, Ralph. Taylor Caldwell? No. Halde
man-Julius? Great Scott! Oscar Wilde? Oedipus-
Sakes Alive! Balzac? George Sand? Ingersoll?
Huxley? Joseph McCabe? Goodness! How about
some help, Ralph? I'm getting in too deep. Well,
Flaubert? No. Checkhov? Voltaire? Euripides?
Help, Ralph! Sherwood Anderson? Hecht? Wait a
minute —here we go—Aesop, Robert Louis Steven
son, Lewis Carroll, Louisa Alcott, Horatio Alger,
and lots more.
And just in case people get tired of those (even
though we know they won't) we can throw out the
Sunday movies altogether and hold a Bible class.
I certainly do agree with you, Ralph. But we will
have to be careful, won't we? The Song of Songs
is—well, some people might not understand.
