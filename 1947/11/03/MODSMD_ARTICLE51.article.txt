To the Editor:
The election of last Wednesday was a success as
far as efficiency of the machinery and prompt an
nouncement of results. To say anything else would
be not only incorrect but in bad taste. In reference
to the turnout of voters however, anything in good
taste would be a waste of time.
That particular phenomena of 249 votes cast out
of an electorate of nearly 3,000 is the best answer
there could possibly be to why there is inefficiency
in governments. If what we are told is true, and
people respond in the "big world" as they tend to
in college, then those who "let George do it" will have
no recourse in conscience when George fouls-up the
detail.
There were, admittedly, many extenuating cir
cumstances which might appear to give off-campus
voters(V) an excuse for having no opinion in this
by-election. The impossibility of meeting the candi
dates and subsequent reluctance to vote blind being
chief among these.
On the other hand, to say that only 249 students
are interested enough to either look up a candidate
or at least inquire of someone who might know a little
more about them (Election Board, Student Body Of
ficers, statements in the Daily, etc.) is indeed a sad
commentary on the level of interest in current af
fairs. A rousing ovation is in order for those 249
who voted!
In the hope of stimulating a better degree of this
short commodity, interest, Excom has seen fit to
establish office hours for the Graduate and Off-Cam
pus representatives. It is hoped that The Daily will
frequently publish this information and that Stan
fordites will avail themselves of their rights and
i t spoti.sibilities.

To the Editor:
The front-page editorial in yesterday's Dippy
expressed the fear that the "rally" for the Bridge
Club's "Big Game" would make Rally Com ridicu
lous. My opinion is that such a stunt could not make
Rally Com or anyone else ridiculous, if they had not
supplied the ammunition themselves by looking
ridiculous on one or two occasions in the past.
Furthermore, since the "rally" turned out to be
one of the funniest things that has happened on cam
pus since somebody played "Riley's Daughter" on the
carillon, it's The Daily, much as it pains me to admit
it, that really looks ridiculous.
This is not a slam at the people on Rally Com,
the nature of their work, stirring up that ol' collitch
spirit, it always going to look ridiculous to some
people sometime. But let it be hoped, and let yes
terday's fun be a lesson, that institutions, organiza
tions, and officials, Rally Com and The Daily (and
Excom, too, for that matter) will learn not to take
themselves too seriously. A sense of humor and a
sense of perspective are wonderful things.
