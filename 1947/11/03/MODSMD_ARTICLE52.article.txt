To the Editor:
Whereas, the Ed Libe rally last Friday for the
benefit of the Stanford Contract Bridge Team showed
that Stanford has not lost its sense of humor; and
Whereas, the conduct of said rally was character
ized by extreme competence and skill;
Therefore, the Stanford CHAPARRAL bestows
on Tom Elke who sparkplugged said rally its highest
commendation, the Order of the Purple Bird (Hon
orary); and on those who assisted him, The Order of
the Purple Bird (Honorary) second class, popularly
known as the Magenta Bird; and on all those present
who laughed, The Order of the Purple Bird (Hon
orary) third class, known as the Cerise Bird; and
on all those who were very stuffy about it and who
made deprecatory statements that it was "not a
good joke," the CHAPARRAL bestows The Bird.
