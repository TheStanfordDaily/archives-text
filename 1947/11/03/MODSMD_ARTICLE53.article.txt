To the Editor:
This is a letter of applause for manifest discrim
ination to the directors of the Sunday Evening
Series of campus movies. The showing on campus
of such moving pictures as "Garden of Allah,"
"Turnabout," and especially "Scarlet Street" is the
introduction of many Stanford students to great
cinema art.
Those, like Ralph Connell, who complain of the
"lewdness" of the truly magnificent drama "Scar
let Street" must remember that "Oedipus the King"
of Sophocles or "Gargantua" of Rabelais or the
"Decameron" of Baccaccio were surely no less
"lewd."
That the showing of "Scarlet Street" on campus
should be, to quote Mr. Connell, "a reflection on the
moral standards of Stanford University," is no more
sound than that the reading of the works of Sophocles
in Greek should be a inflection on the moral stand
ards of Greece.
Aspects of great art are inspiring thought; c.f.
"Garden of Allah," wit, c.f. "Turnabout," and moving
human drama, c.f. "Scarlet Street." By these stand
aids the Sunday Evening Series has offered to mature
Stanford men and women, in addition to gripping
entertainment, excellent ail.
