# Clinic Helps Parents Tame Child Tarzans
## 
### MARY KILBOURNE 
If your child has the urge to fling spoonfuls of Cream of Wheat
at the living room drapes—don't worry.
And if your cousin's freckled-faced prodigy thinks he's any
kin to Tarzan of the Apes—don't worry.
The Stanford child guidance clinic, its offices and clinic located

on the top floor of the Education
Building, will hasten to the scene
of the "infant drama" in an effort to
solve all problems.
ADJUSTMENTS MADE
"Problem children are merely
children with problems," Frances
Orr, consulting staff psychologist,
declared. "The problem is solved
merely by trying to adjust a child's
world to reality.
"None of the cases is psychotic.
They are children within the range
of normalcy."
Clad in blue -green cotton gar
ments, with shoes polished to a
luster, children are rather dubious
when first visiting the clinic. But
gradually, they are delieved from
all tension in a series of clinical
treatments.
MAKE-BELIEVE PARADISE
A playroom replete with toys is
included in the clinic. Youngsters,
fearing the worst, are suddenly cast
into a world of make-believe.
"Of course, this is just a means
of letting the child express his pent
up emotions while in the play
room," Miss Orr said.
Extending its services to commu
nities along the Peninsula and San
ta Clara Valley, the Stanford Psy
chological Clinic offers two train
ing fellowships in clinical psychol
ogy, made possble through a grant
of $16,592 from the United States
Public Health Service.
Founded by Dr. Maud M. James,
the staff of five is aided immeasur
ably by numerous graduate stu
dents whose clinical aim is "even
tually making families happier by
making children happy."
"Parental attitude toward the
child is often the basic cause of the
children's difficulties," Miss Orr
said. "Many parents expect too
much of their children."
PARENTS IN INTERVIEW
Number one stop in the schedule
for parents and children is "the in
terview." Problems are unveiled
and the playroom doors are opened
for tousle-headed youngsters who
have a tendency to burst into tan
trums.
The clinic has listed fits of jeal
ousy, speech problems, failure in
school, wild rages, and spells of ex
cessive crying as the chief difficul
ties of its youthful patients.
Thrust into a joyful playland with
other children, the child watches
other children at play and associ
ates with them in playful co-opera

tion. This is part of a daytime slate
to unburden the child from
"thoughts of Tarzanic characters
sweeping from palm to palm on
University Drive."
SIMPLICITY DESIRED
The local clinic, fashioning a
complex pattern of ideas and treat
ments into a design of simplicity, is
fast becoming a favorite rendezvous
for worried parents and their chil
dren.
No more are parents being wor
ried by Junior's spoon - slamming
attitude toward his morning por
tion of Quaker Oats.
And gone forever are the days
when aerial-minded tots converted
the bannister into a "jet-propelled
slide."
Source of the remedy can be at
tributed to the Stanford child guid
ance clinic and its casual flashback
into the "problem children of yes
terday."

school, wild rages, and spells of ex
cessive crying as the chief difficul
ties of its youthful patients.
Thrust into a joyful playland with
other children, the child watches
other children at play and associ
ates with them in playful co-opera

tion. This is part of a daytime slate
to unburden the child from
"thoughts of Tarzanic characters
sweeping from palm to palm on
University Drive."
SIMPLICITY DESIRED
The local clinic, fashioning a
complex pattern of ideas and treat
ments into a design of simplicity, is
fast becoming a favorite rendezvous
for worried parents and their chil
dren.
No more are parents being wor
ried by Junior's spoon - slamming
attitude toward his morning por
tion of Quaker Oats.
And gone forever are the days
when aerial-minded tots converted
the bannister into a "jet-propelled
slide."
Source of the remedy can be at
tributed to the Stanford child guid
ance clinic and its casual flashback
into the "problem children of yes
terday."
If your child has the urge to fling spoonfuls of Cream of Wheat
at the living room drapes—don't worry.
And if your cousin's freckled-faced prodigy thinks he's any
kin to Tarzan of the Apes—don't worry.
The Stanford child guidance clinic, its offices and clinic located

on the top floor of the Education
Building, will hasten to the scene
of the "infant drama" in an effort to
solve all problems.
ADJUSTMENTS MADE
"Problem children are merely
children with problems," Frances
Orr, consulting staff psychologist,
declared. "The problem is solved
merely by trying to adjust a child's
world to reality.
"None of the cases is psychotic.
They are children within the range
of normalcy."
Clad in blue -green cotton gar
ments, with shoes polished to a
luster, children are rather dubious
when first visiting the clinic. But
gradually, they are delieved from
all tension in a series of clinical
treatments.
MAKE-BELIEVE PARADISE
A playroom replete with toys is
included in the clinic. Youngsters,
fearing the worst, are suddenly cast
into a world of make-believe.
"Of course, this is just a means
of letting the child express his pent
up emotions while in the play
room," Miss Orr said.
Extending its services to commu
nities along the Peninsula and San
ta Clara Valley, the Stanford Psy
chological Clinic offers two train
ing fellowships in clinical psychol
ogy, made possble through a grant
of $16,592 from the United States
Public Health Service.
Founded by Dr. Maud M. James,
the staff of five is aided immeasur
ably by numerous graduate stu
dents whose clinical aim is "even
tually making families happier by
making children happy."
"Parental attitude toward the
child is often the basic cause of the
children's difficulties," Miss Orr
said. "Many parents expect too
much of their children."
PARENTS IN INTERVIEW
Number one stop in the schedule
for parents and children is "the in
terview." Problems are unveiled
and the playroom doors are opened
for tousle-headed youngsters who
have a tendency to burst into tan
trums.
The clinic has listed fits of jeal
ousy, speech problems, failure in
school, wild rages, and spells of ex
