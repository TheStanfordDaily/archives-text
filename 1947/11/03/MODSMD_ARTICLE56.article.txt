Milt Haven, Stanford '20. who was
a columnist for the Stanford Daily,
edited the Chaparral, and wrote sev
eral campus plays, and who is now
a successful songwriter, is the sub
ject of an illustrated article by Dean
Jennings in "Collier's Weekly" issue
of Nov. 8.
The article deals with Hagen's
songwriting activities throughout
the world, but devotes considerable
space to his Stanford undergraduate
days before he assumed his suc
cessful nom de plume of "Sterling
Sherwin."
Hagen started the local chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, the men's jour
nalism fraternity, and was its first
president.
Chaparral still uses the editorial
masthead which he laid out, and the
Hammer & Coffin cuts between jokes
were his creation.
He won a gold medal prize for his
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
and wrote several Ram's Head plays.
