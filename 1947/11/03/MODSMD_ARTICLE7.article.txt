President Donald B. Tresidder
has recently returned after speak
ing to the Association of American
Medical Colleges at Sun Valley,
Idaho, on "The Aims and Purposes
of Medical Education."
| A thorough and exhaustive re
[ examination of both medical and
I premedical education was urged by
Dr. Tresidder. One of the weak
nesses in medical education, he said,
is that graduates are well trained
but in many instances poorly edu-
I cated.
"Another weakness," he contin
ued, "is that medical school gradu
ates often lack an adequate sense
of social responsibility, social skill,
and understanding of the complex
ity of modern society, a charge
| which in considerable degree is a
reflection of the weakness of gen
eral education."
"All our plans will fail if we do
not inculcate in our doctors an in
sight into the problems of our free
j society and the extent to which
| their own future activities/ will be
fraught with public interest," he
| stressed.
