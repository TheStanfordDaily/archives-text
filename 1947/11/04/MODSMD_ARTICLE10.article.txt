### 
CONCORD, N.H., Nov. 3 (UP). â€”John Gilbert Winant, 58, U.S. wartime
ambassador to Great Britain and three-time governor of New Hampshire,
committed suicide last night by shooting himself in the right temple with
a foreign-made pistol.
An official verdict of suicide was returned by county solicitor Ray
mond K. Perkins and corroborated by medical referee Clarence E. But
terfield of Merrimac county.
No message was found near the body and Perkins, after questioning
domestics in Winant's palatial, two-story colonial mansion on Pleasant
street, attributed the suicide to "despondency occasioned by extreme
fatigue and nervous tension."
Perkins said Winant killed himself with a 7.65-mm. Belgian automatic.
Only two persons besides Winant were in the house early last night
when the single suicide shot was fired. They were his personal secretary
and a maid.
