BERLIN, Nov. 3 (UP). â€”The American military government opened
its promised anti-communist campaign today with a full page newspaper
blast reporting a super-secret Russian-German agreement, reached one
week before the start of World War 11, on the division of eastern Europe.
The secret document, for the authenticity of which it was evident

highest American authorities
vouched, recognized Finland, Es- j
tonia, Latvia and Lithuania as being !
in Russia's sphere. A line of Rus- j
sian-German interest was fixed in j
Poland. Russia's interest in Roman
ian Bessarabia was recognized.
The text of the document, along
with other material and photo
graphs, was published in the Ameri
can-licensed German newspaper Dei-
Abend.
One photograph showed General
issimo Josef Stalin standing beside
Joachim von Ribbentrop, German
foreign minister who was hanged J
after the Nuernberg war crimes trial.
Another showed Russian foreign
minister Viacheslav Molotov beside j
Ribbentrop and Field Marshal Wil- |
helm Keitel, likewise hanged at
Nuernberg.
Publication of the agreement
marked the start of a carefully con- i
sidered campaign of reply to crit- I
icism by the Russians of the United j
States and its policies.
