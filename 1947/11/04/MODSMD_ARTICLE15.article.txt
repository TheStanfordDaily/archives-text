## 
### MEL HOFFMAN 
A Stanford Council for UNESCO
was formed last week. It will have
a working relationship with the Na
tional Commission for the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization.
Permission to organize was re
ceived recently from Dr. Milton Ei
senhower, chairman of the National
Commission for UNESCO. He
writes:
"I have heard of your Institute
of International Relations and the
"fine work it is doing, and I am
therefore particularly anxious to
encourage your proposed work
with regard to UNESCO. Certainly
we would like to have you enter
into a working relationship with the
National Commission."
PURPOSE DEFINED
What, then, is UNESCO?
It is an intergovernmental organ
ization kith permanent headquar
ters in Paris. One of the eight
"specialized agencies" recognized by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations, it has 31 member nations

at present.
The purpose of UNESCO is to
contribute to peace and security by
promoting collaboration among the
nations through education, science,
and culture.
UNESCO aims to remove the ig
norance, hatred, and fear which
breed war by -attacking them at
their sourceâ€”the individual mind.
It plans to bring all the aids of sci
ence, education, and culture to bear
on the problems of world peace.
PROJECTS LISTED
First on the list of 1947 projects
is the reconstruction and rehabili
tation of war-devastated countries.
UNESCO hopes to do this through
scientific and technical equipment,
by exchange of publications, and by
assistance in the field of arts and
letters.
Assisting countries that are at
tempting to establish higher stand
ards of education is a second 1947
UNESCO project. Help is now be
ing given in Haiti and British South
Africa toward the establishment of
better educational systems.

A third 1947 project is the promo
tion of international understanding.
This will be done through teacher
seminars, textbooks, clubs, adult

UNESCO's relation io the Stan
ford campus will be discussed to
night at 9 on KSU.
Speakers will be Dr. Jeffrey
Smith, associate professor of hu- i
inanities and philosophy; Robert
von Pagcnhardt, vice - president
of the Institute of International
Relations, and Lois Davidson,
chairman of the Council for
UNESCO.
They will be interviewed by
George CauHicld. Daily editor,
Don Davies, associate editor, and

education, international study cen
ters, and exchange of persons.
A study of the problems of living
in tropical areas is being made. Re
search for this fourth 1947 project
is being conducted in the Hylean
Amazon region of Latin America.
What is the relation between

UNESCO and the man in the
street?
UNESCO emphasizes individual
action because it feels that indi
vidual understanding of world
problems is a direct and effective
way of creating a permanent desire
for peace. It is hoped that if the
individual thinks straight today, the
world as a whole may think straight
tomorrow.
Each person should make his per
sonal opinion felt among his friends,
in his clubs, and in his community.
He should understand what he is
talking about and not be afraid to
speak frankly at meetings. Too
often those who attack the ideals of
peace have loud mouths but those
who defend them do not.
Th<> Stanford Council for UNES
CO will serve students hv giving
information on opportunities for
travel and study in Europe. It will
encourage Stanford students to
spend a few months in Europe in
the hope of promoting greater un
derstanding between the United
States and Europe.
