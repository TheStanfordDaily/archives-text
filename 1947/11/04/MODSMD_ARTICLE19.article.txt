# Soph Women to Assist Fund Drive, Handle Campus, Village Collections
## 
### 
The Sophomore Class will help get
the Stanford Relief Fund Drive off
to a flying start when '50 girls man
the campus and Village collection
booths during the opening three days
of the drive, sophomore collection
chairman Paula Smith announced
today.
"The Row houses and Union
should see Joan Donovan to sign

up," she continued. "Those in Lag
and Ventura should see either Suze
Ray or Carolyn Johnson, and Bran
ner girls should get in touch with
Ann KiefTer.
"We of the Row feel that we can
easily out-collect the rest of the
Sophomores," said Joan Donovan,
row collection chairman, "And we
hereby throw down the gauntlet and
issue them the challenge."
