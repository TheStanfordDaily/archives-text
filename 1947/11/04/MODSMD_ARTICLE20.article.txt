# 'Atom Biology' Will Be Series Lecture Topic
## 
### 
"Bikini and the Biological As
pects of Atomic Development" is
the subject of a lecture to be given
tonight by Dr. Douglas M. Whita
ker, dean of the School of Biologi
cal Sciences. The lecture will begin
at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium and
is open to the public.
Dean Whitaker, who headed the
biological unit of a scientific expe
dition to Bikini Atoll last
was one of five Stanford faculty
members who had major roles in
an Army - Navy survey conducted
there. Purpose of the expedition
was to determine the amount of ra
diation which remained among ma
rine plants and animal life in the
lagoon in which the Operation
Crossroads target fleet was sub
jected to atomic bombing last year.
During the course of the 45-day
j expedition Dean Whitaker made
i extensive studies of sea urchins
and other marine invertebrates to
| determine effects of atomic bomb
j radiation on reproduction and em
| bryological processes.
Other Stanfordites in the party of
' 90 civilian Scientists and technicians
participating in the investigation
were Dr. Lawrence R. Blinks, di
rector of the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion; Dr. Gilbert Morgan Smith and
Dr. George S. Myers, professors of
! biology; and Dr. Philip Brooks, staff
member of the Stanford Research
Institute.
Dr. Whitaker was chosen to head
the School of Biological Sciences in
March, 1946, to succeed the late
Dr. Charles Vincent Taylor. A
I member of the Stanford faculty
since 1931, he Ls a 1926 Stanford
graduate. He was awarded the
Ph.D. degree here in 1928.
