WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP).â€”
Proposals for some 4(5 major changes
in federal revenue-raising laws will
be laid before the. House Ways and
Means committee tomorrow, reliable
sources said tonight.
Chairman Harold Knutson, R.,
Minn., who already has announced
his determination to press for a
"quickie" income tax cut despite
strong administration objections,
called the committee together to
consider lung-range plans for gen
eral overhaul of the federal tax
structure.
The plans, said to include 33 pro
posals affecting individual incomes,
were prepared by a nine-man ma
jority of the special tax study com
mittee of private citizens, appointed
by Knutson last June.
