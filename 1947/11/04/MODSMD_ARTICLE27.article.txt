# A
						'Happy Birthday' Chorus, A Cake, and--Proves That Hashing Has Its Better Side

### DEE KEATLEY 
Hiding behind a dish-laden tray
and carrying a candle - bedecked
birthday cake is only half the job
for Stanford's hashers.
The other half involves the nicest
pastime ever conceived in Farm
history, namely that of "kissing the
demure coed who has reached the
age of 18."
They'll tell you it's the better side
of hashing.
"Happy Birthday" being sung in
choruses of surprise and happiness,
the dance of shadows on the ma
hogany tables, and the inevitable
buss on the lips from obliging hash
ers are all dominant segments of
"the best years of a hasher's life."
The custom of "birthday time
bussing" was inaugurated in the
sorority houses just before World
War II and spread rapidly to the
larger dormitories. It was discon
tinued in Roble and Lagunita in
1945 because there were too many
birthdays and too many hashers to
have it work out. The other houses
followed suit and today only one
third still follow this Farm tradi
tion.
WARTIME SHORTAGE
Along the Row in the first years
of the war, the head hasher was the
only one to have the honor of kiss
ing the birthday girl. Then the
other five hashers decided they
wanted their chances, too, and the
boys decided in the kitchen before
dinner who would be the lucky
one that particular birthday.
In the early days of Storey House,
formerly Delta Gamma sorority, all
six hashers rushed up and kissed
the girl. Then the custom died in
both the small and large houses, for
it began to be disagreeable either
to the hashers or to the girls.
"It came with a flash, and left
with a flash," explained Mrs. Emma
Maycomber, house mother at Cub
berley House, who was there during
that hectic period. "Hashers then
were chosen by the University, and
the girls and hashers were definite
ly unacquainted."
The tradition is still in sporadic
use at Union dining room and in
Hurlburt and Guthrie houses. In
Storey House the hashers kiss the

girls on every birthday, Ihe hashers
taking turns.
'JUST CUSTOM'
"It is just a custom, just one of
those things which has carried on,"
Mrs. V. Reynolds, Slorey house
mother, declared. "It can be drop
ped at any time."
Storey's Chinese cook, an affable
man named Frank, who has been at
the house since 1936, thinks that the
hashers started the custom.
"I wouldn't like it myself," he
admitted.
Branner Hall has carried on the
tradition since it was opened as a
girls' dormitory during the war.
The roommates of the birthday girl
choose the hasher who will bring
in the cake.
This fall Miss Ellen Hibbard, din
ing hall director, and Mrs. Inslee
Flickinger, hall director, issued a
directive that there would be no
more kissing on birthdays. But the
Branner hashers ignored the direc-

I live and so every birthday at Bran
ner is accompanied by a cake and a
| kiss.
HASHERS SATISFIED
The Branner hashers seem to be
well satisfied with the arrangement.
When asked why they went on with
the tradition this year, one hasher
replied, "It was one of those things
that was bigger than all of us."
The Branner girls seem to OK the
system too, although one girl re
marked, "It's a nice little tradition,
but it would be better if they kissed
you on the cheek."
A Roble sponsor is quoted as
having the following viewpoint:
"It's a very collegiate tradition —
kind of different, sort of interesting,
not at all necessary—but I think it's
a good idea."
Jesting opposition to the discon
tinuance was expressed this way:
"Although we're having meatless
Tuesdays and poultryless Thurs
days, why should there be kissless
| birthdays?"
