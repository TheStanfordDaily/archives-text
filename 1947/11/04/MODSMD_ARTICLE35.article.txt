# New Residence Hall Latest in Series Of Stanford Law School Achievements

### JERRY STAVIG 
One of the nation's foremost legal
institutions for more than half a
century, the Stanford School of Law
commences its fifty - fourth year
with a feeling of justifiable pride
in the past and the prospect of
greater achievement in the future.
Founded in 18£3, the law school
has grown from a small pioneer
class to a current enrollment of
over five hundred. The achieve
ments of its alumni present a tan
gible gauge of the school's merit.
They have become presidents of the
American and State Bar Associa
tions, Supreme Court judges, Con
gressmen —an extensive represen
tation in all three branches of the
government.
EFFICIENT FACULTY
The faculty, composed of 17 active
members and a group of non-resi
dent lecturers, is comparable to
that of any legal institution in the
country. Each professor has a back
ground of legal distinction in his
particular field. Under their super
vision almost 50 specialized courses
are offered to the law student, a
large percentage of these entailing
two and three quarters of continu
ous study.
In the library more than 60,000
books of the case, textual, reference,
and non-professional varieties are
available to the student. Exhaus
tive sets of reports from every Eng
lish-speaking country in the world
line the shelves. Legal volumes in
the original French, Spanish, Ger
man, and Italian are also on hand,
as well as a collection of works on
Roman law.
LIMITED ENROLLMENT
Throughout its history, the law
school has operated on a policy of
limiting enrollment, thereby enab
ling the student and instructor to
maintain a comparatively intimate
relationship. Consequently, from the
1,500 inquiries regarding admission
received this year, less than 15 per
cent were reviewed favorably and
ultimately approved. Such a selec
tive process enables the school to

maintain an excellent caliber of j
student personnel.
"Broadly stated, admittance is ]
granted to students who are fitted !
by their maturity and previous aca- j
demic training to pursue profes- 1
sional study under university meth
ods of instruction," commented Carl
B. Spaeth, law school dean.
"It has also been the aim of the
school to inculcate into its students
something beyond the bare compre
hension of legal concepts," Dean
Spaeth continued. "Since the law
yer's role takes him into all phases
of human endeavor, in business as
well as politics, the law school at
tempts to offer a curriculum that
will better enable its graduates to
step into almost any policy-making ■
field. The by-word is adaptability." I
FUTURE PLANS
Concrete plans for the future with
regard to the law school are three
fold: a law review, a new law school
building, and a dormitory for law
students.
The law review is at present un
dergoing a year's intramural trial
period. Thirty-five top-ranking sec
ond-year students, now in the pro
cess of preparing a series of initial
case comments to be criticized by
the faculty and other professional
men, are laying the groundwork for
the first circulated edition in No
vember of next year. The review
will be published subsequently on
a quarterly basis, each succeeding
class contributing its top students
as a board of editors.

A law review consists, in the
main, of three or four topic articles,
comments on current decisions of
general interest, and reviews of im
portant new books.
According to current plans, with
in a tentative period of two years
the Administration Building will he
converted into a five-floor edifice
for the law school. The building
will contain separate offices for each
member of the faculty, library stack
space and reading rooms, a law re
view workshop, a chamber espe
cially designed for moot court work,
student lounges, and classrooms.
Only the exterior of the present
building will remain unchanged.
DORM GIFT
Construction work has been un
der way since last month on Croth
ers Hall, a residential unit for grad
uate law students. The dormitory
was made possible by a gift to the
University from Judge George E.
Crothers of San Francisco. The 63-
room hall is to be a two - story
structure of the contemporary type.
Present plans slate occupancy for
next June. The building is being
constructed on Galvez Slrect in the
area back of Encina Hall.
Within a period of a few years,
then, Stanford law students will
find themselves in surroundings far
different from the inadequate fa
cilities of today. Outward appear
ances will indeed be changed, but
the school itself will continue in the
manner of fine tradition evidenced
by its past.
