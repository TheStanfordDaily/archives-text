COSTUME HIGHLIGHTS
Selma Chapmond, graduate stu
dent in drama, who is working on
the costumes for the production of
Shakespeare's great historical play,
promises that accuracy in costume
reproductions will be another of
the many highlights of "Richard
III."
Miss Chapmond has spent many
hours in the Stanford Library do
ing research on the heraldry of
Richard's period. Among other
things she discovered that Richard,
who thought of himself as looking
like a boar, used a silver boar as
his personal insignia.
"We have been especially care
ful in copying the heraldic devices
of Richard's time," Miss Chapmond
stated, "and these will be displayed
on the shields carried by the nobles
in our production. Of course, they
add greatly to the color of the pro
duction."
RICHARD IN RED
"For that matter," she added, "I
don't see how we could get more
colorful costumes. Richard and his
followers all have red costumes,
while Richmond and his followers,
are dressed all in blue. And, just
to complete the picture, Edward IV
and his followers arc dressed in
green."
The Stanford Players are going
all - out for realism, and "Richard
III" promises to be one of the finest
dramatic presentations ever seen at
Stanford.
Tickets are now on sale at the
office of the secretary of the Speech
and Drama Department, Memorial

addition, a few season tickets for all

tween the forces of the bloodthirsty

unusual lighting effects, will pro

stage manager of "Richard III."
COSTUME HIGHLIGHTS
Selma Chapmond, graduate stu
dent in drama, who is working on
the costumes for the production of
Shakespeare's great historical play,
promises that accuracy in costume
reproductions will be another of
the many highlights of "Richard
III."
Miss Chapmond has spent many
hours in the Stanford Library do
ing research on the heraldry of
Richard's period. Among other
things she discovered that Richard,
who thought of himself as looking
like a boar, used a silver boar as
his personal insignia.
"We have been especially care
ful in copying the heraldic devices
of Richard's time," Miss Chapmond
stated, "and these will be displayed
on the shields carried by the nobles
in our production. Of course, they
add greatly to the color of the pro
duction."
RICHARD IN RED
"For that matter," she added, "I
don't see how we could get more
colorful costumes. Richard and his
followers all have red costumes,
while Richmond and his followers,
are dressed all in blue. And, just
to complete the picture, Edward IV
and his followers arc dressed in
green."
The Stanford Players are going
all - out for realism, and "Richard
III" promises to be one of the finest
dramatic presentations ever seen at
Stanford.
Tickets are now on sale at the
