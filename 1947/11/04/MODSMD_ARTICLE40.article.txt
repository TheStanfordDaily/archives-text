LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3 (UP).—
UCLA Coach Bert Laßrucherie was
hailed as one of the nation's top
younger coaches last year but today
he was blamed by the campus
newspaper for his team's 6 to 0 de
feat by California.
Sports editor Bob Alford of the
Daily Bruin wrote that the game
was lost by Laßrucherie, not the
players, because he gave them no
chance to run the team independent
of the bench.
