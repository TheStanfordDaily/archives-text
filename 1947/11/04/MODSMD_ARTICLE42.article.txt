# Crew Needs More Shells
## 
### 
With a seambursting roster of 74
men remaining on the squad, the J
Stanford crew is faced with the |
problem of finding enough boats to
take care of all its sweepsters.
The pair of new racing shells, ,
which have been expected for sev- j
eral days, are still enroute, further
complicating the situation.
The crew's officers are eager to
get as many of the frosh in shells
as soon as possible. Plans had
called for the boating of all /'••esh
men this week, but the d./ayed
arrivals of the new boats has damp
ened this hope.
However, George Benedict, crew
manager, stated that at least one
shell will be filled with new oars
men by the end of the week.
Other improvements the group
plans include the installation of a
lighting system in the boathouse
and strengthening of the dock.
Meanwhile, two varsity eights
have been hitting the water every
Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
No assignments or ratings have been
made as yet, and definite first team
positions will not be assigned until
winter quarter.

When the new shells arrive some
time late this week the crew will be
; faced with the problem of finding
j enough oars to outfit all the seven
shells. An estimated $400 will be
J required to equip the boats.
