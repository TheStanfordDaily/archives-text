# Indians Prep For SC Tilt

### 
Coach Marchie Schwartz shoved
his Stanford football varsity, minus
a select few, through an hour and a
half scrimmage yesterday, in prep
aration for this weekend's invasion
of Southern California.
Excused from the scrum were a
handful of linemen and backs, all
of whom figured prominently in last
Saturday's tustsle with Oregon State.
For the rock-sock session, replete
even to down marker and yardage
chains, the skeleton varsity was
divided into halves and allowed to
go at it under practically game con
ditions.
End Gene Martin, victim of bur
sitis of the knee, is expected to be
in playable condition for the Trojan
game. Return of Martin will
strengthen the Card end positions,
although off their showing in the
OSC game the flanks were ably
manned.
Trainer Con Jarvis also hopes to
get guard Bob Rohrer off the sick
list by the end of the week.
But chances that Mickey Titus will
get into action are very slim. The
chunky right half reinjured his
knee in his first running play against
the Beavers.
Coach Jeff Cravath's Trojans are
flying high, and are odds-on favor
ites to receive the Rose Bowl nom
ination come the end of the season.


DON ZAPPETINI started the
Oregon State game at fullback
after being the "forgotten man" of
Stanford football for most of the
year. Zap proved Coach Marchie
Schwartz' hunch in starting him
was correct by tearing off many
substantial gains through the OSC
line.
