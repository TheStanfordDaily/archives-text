# POLOISTS WIN ONE, LOSE ONE
## 
### 
The weekend record of the Stan
ford water polo team read one win
and one loss as the Farm lads jour
neyed south to meet UCLA and
USC in Los Angeles.
On Friday, the Indians defeated
a hustling UCLA outfit by a 10 to 7
count, with Walter Lull leading the
Cards in scoring by hitting for four.
USC eked out a narrow 11 to 9
win in a contest that went into two
overtime periods. Leading by an 8
to 7 score with but 30 seconds to go,
the Stanford lads saw the game
knotted up by a USC free throw.
The first extra period ended in a
9-all tie, but the Trojans potted two
in the second to win, 11 to 9.
