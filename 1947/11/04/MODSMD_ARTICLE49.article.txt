# Razzing But Not Hazing
## 
### 
Tomorrow night belongs to the class of '51.
At 7:15 the frosh men will don pajamas and
march down the row to the Pavilion as part of
the annual Pajamarino.
Since its casual beginning in 1904, the Paja
marino has become an outstanding event of
the Farm football season. Last year, however,
after the destruction on the row and in the
Pavilion on the night of the rally it was ru
mored that the annual event might be can
celed.
It's logical and traditional that the older
students should give the frosh a razzing. But
breaking windows on the row and throwing
rotten tomatoes in the Pavilion are not a neces
sary part of the razzing.
The Pajamarino is a picturesque rally. It
arouses the ail-too dead class spirit and can be
a lot of fun for everyone who participates,
but doing harm to persons and property in an

event of this nature went out with the old-time
fraternity hazing.
Tomorrow night's rally will be a good show
even without a near riot in the Pavilion.—M.S.
