# Don't Waste Your Vote
## 
### 
Nobody wants to throw his vote away!
But it's a foregone conclusion that you have
to know whom you're voting for before you
can vote intelligently.
Tonight the sophomores are sponsoring the
second freshman pre-election rally in history.
We hope it will become a tradition.
The freshmen have a chance, both tonight
and tomorrow, to show the campus just how
interested they are in student government by
coming to the rally, meeting their candidates,
and then voting 100'r' .
It would be a welcome contrast to the last
election.â€”M.H.
