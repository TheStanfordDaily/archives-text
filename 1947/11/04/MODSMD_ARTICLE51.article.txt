### ALLEN BLETZ 
It was just a little over two years ago that a
single bomb dropped from the skies brought death
and destruction to the town of Hiroshima. The bomb
put a quick end to a slaughter which would have
been much greater without it and thereby justified its
use.
But the black cloud it left hanging over that now
stricken city still hangs over the whole world, and
the horror of its effects continues to spur the efforts
of men to gain control of this deadly force. For there
is no doubt possible, except for those of you who pre
tend not to see, that an atomic conflict would mean
the end of our civilization, and possibly it might
mean the end of man.
In that effort at control the United States, which
developed the atomic bomb and still holds a mon
opoly of it, has taken the lead. America has done this
in full consciousness of the great responsibility it
assumed when it undertook to guard the new weapon
from misuse by acting as its temporary trustee. But
we have done so also in full awareness that its mon
opoly can be only of short duration.
These considerations have guided American pol
icy ever since the day of Hiroshima. The problem
of protecting ourselves and the rest of the world
from this new weapon has been solved, but solved
only on a national scale—by the creation of the
United States Atomic Energy Commission under the
chairmanship of David Lilienthal.
This Commission has assumed monopoly control of
the production of both atomic bombs and atomic
power, and it is thereby guarding this new force from
falling into "evil ' hands. But despite two years of
work and many plans, little progress has been
achieved in international control, on which, in the
end, hangs our fate.
The plan of the Atomic Energy Commission vis
ions a strong and comprehensive international system
of control and inspection which would be able to
override both the sovereign and veto rights of any
nation; thus would be the beginnings of a world
government. For that purpose, the plan calls for a
treaty or convention which would create an inter
national agency endowed with all powers necessary to

discharge its duties, including the power to own,
manage, and control all atomic energy production,
and the right to send its representatives and in
spectors to all countries without hindrance.
In a definite contrast to this plan, Russia raises
the point of an inviolable national sovereignty, and
she rejects the plan as a violation of it. Despite
Premier Stalin's assurance that Russia is for strong
international control, she proposes that we turn the
secrets of the bomb over to her first, destroy our
own bombs, and then talk about international con
trol afterward.
The only international control Russia is willing to
admit would'be a gentleman's agreement against the
bomb—a gentleman's agreement which would pro
hibit atomic weapons, but would leave it more or
less to each nation to police itself, and she would
put punishment of violators in the hands of the
Security Council with the use of the veto possible.
In other words, while disarming the United States
and all other nations, Russia would be free to arm
herself behind her Iron Curtain, under her own "in
spection" system, and if caught violating the gentle
mans agreement could legally veto punishment of
herself.
This Russian plan has already been denounced by
competent American men as a "fraud on the people
of the world." But Russia's continued insistence on
it has created another deadlock which renders the
prospects of an early agreement unlikely.
However, one famous poet said, "While there is
lile there is hope,' and as long as Russia continues
to negotiate, there is a possibility that during this
period of negotiation she might see the light and
change her ways.
The American people and all the peoples of the
world must not and cannot turn their backs to this
ever-growing problem. The leaders of this nation,
in conjunction with the heads of the other foreign
powers, must act quickly and decisively in order to
spare the world from the ultimate tragedy of
atomic war. What happened in Hiroshima and Naga
saki must never occur again, anyplace; and now is
the time for all humanity to demand that steps be
taken to prevent such a disaster.

the end of our civilization, and possibly it might
mean the end of man.
In that effort at control the United States, which
developed the atomic bomb and still holds a mon
opoly of it, has taken the lead. America has done this
in full consciousness of the great responsibility it
assumed when it undertook to guard the new weapon
from misuse by acting as its temporary trustee. But
we have done so also in full awareness that its mon
opoly can be only of short duration.
These considerations have guided American pol
icy ever since the day of Hiroshima. The problem
of protecting ourselves and the rest of the world
from this new weapon has been solved, but solved
only on a national scale—by the creation of the
United States Atomic Energy Commission under the
chairmanship of David Lilienthal.
This Commission has assumed monopoly control of
the production of both atomic bombs and atomic
power, and it is thereby guarding this new force from
falling into "evil ' hands. But despite two years of
work and many plans, little progress has been
achieved in international control, on which, in the
end, hangs our fate.
The plan of the Atomic Energy Commission vis
ions a strong and comprehensive international system
of control and inspection which would be able to
override both the sovereign and veto rights of any
nation; thus would be the beginnings of a world
government. For that purpose, the plan calls for a
treaty or convention which would create an inter
national agency endowed with all powers necessary to

discharge its duties, including the power to own,
manage, and control all atomic energy production,
and the right to send its representatives and in
spectors to all countries without hindrance.
In a definite contrast to this plan, Russia raises
the point of an inviolable national sovereignty, and
she rejects the plan as a violation of it. Despite
Premier Stalin's assurance that Russia is for strong
international control, she proposes that we turn the
secrets of the bomb over to her first, destroy our
own bombs, and then talk about international con
trol afterward.
The only international control Russia is willing to
admit would'be a gentleman's agreement against the
bomb—a gentleman's agreement which would pro
hibit atomic weapons, but would leave it more or
less to each nation to police itself, and she would
put punishment of violators in the hands of the
Security Council with the use of the veto possible.
In other words, while disarming the United States
and all other nations, Russia would be free to arm
herself behind her Iron Curtain, under her own "in
spection" system, and if caught violating the gentle
mans agreement could legally veto punishment of
herself.
This Russian plan has already been denounced by
competent American men as a "fraud on the people
of the world." But Russia's continued insistence on
it has created another deadlock which renders the
prospects of an early agreement unlikely.
However, one famous poet said, "While there is
lile there is hope,' and as long as Russia continues
to negotiate, there is a possibility that during this
period of negotiation she might see the light and
change her ways.
The American people and all the peoples of the
world must not and cannot turn their backs to this
ever-growing problem. The leaders of this nation,
in conjunction with the heads of the other foreign
powers, must act quickly and decisively in order to
spare the world from the ultimate tragedy of
atomic war. What happened in Hiroshima and Naga
saki must never occur again, anyplace; and now is
the time for all humanity to demand that steps be
taken to prevent such a disaster.
It was just a little over two years ago that a
single bomb dropped from the skies brought death
and destruction to the town of Hiroshima. The bomb
put a quick end to a slaughter which would have
been much greater without it and thereby justified its
use.
But the black cloud it left hanging over that now
stricken city still hangs over the whole world, and
the horror of its effects continues to spur the efforts
of men to gain control of this deadly force. For there
is no doubt possible, except for those of you who pre
tend not to see, that an atomic conflict would mean
the end of our civilization, and possibly it might
mean the end of man.
