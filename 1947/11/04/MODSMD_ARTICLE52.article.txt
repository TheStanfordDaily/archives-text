To the Editor:
There are some questions in my mind concern
ing Ralph Council's letter in Friday's Daily. On
what basis does he make his criticism of the quality
of the pictures concerned? "Lewd" and "lower na
ture are harsh words. I also would like to know
wh;il Mr. Council was doing at the three pictures
concerned, if he considers the condemnation of the
"National League of Decency" to be valid. It is
evident that he does, since it is one of the references
which he gives us to u w e in judging the qualities of
the movios shown at Memorial Hall. If his "baser
impulses are disturbed he should stay away and let
the boys with water guns and plastic bubbles run
rampant oh their first trip away from mother.
If one goes to Memorial Hall on Sundays to see
a "morally perfect" world he will invariably be dis
appointed although Hollywood has tried. One should
rejoice when a little of the seamy side of life man
ayes to creep in, because the individual concerned
with seeing the movie can thereby broaden his prej
udices and misconceptions a bit. It is not just one's
"lower nature" that goes to a movie, but fortunately
the "whole works." As such the concern is with
understanding the world whether it be lewd or oth
erwise. A moral judgment on the condition por
trayed in a movie does not change that condition one
bit if the portrayal is true, but people actually see
ing the condition for the first time might be influ
enced into doing something about it if necessary.
To ignore the theme of say "Scarlet Street" is to
ignore the causes of, in this case, prostitution for
"which we all. as members of this culture, must take
a share of the blame.
I dare say that there are as many variations and
degrees of interpreting the "moral standard" as there
are people at Stanford University. As sueh I think
that these prejudices were formed long before Stan
ford got a hold of the present student body. Rather
than letting to have pictures which might affect

"morals adversely" shown we should attempt to im
prove the individual so that all of his "feelings or
failings" aren't projected on the screen. This starts
elsewhere than on the Stanford campus in most cases
and in any case the individual reaction to a given
movie is no reflection on (he "moral standards" of
Stanford University unless the reaction is so violent
that he must be restrained momentarily from injur
ing someone else.
