To the Editor:
In reply to Mr. Evan S. Council's letter of Monday
morningâ€”
I am objecting not to Mr. Council's views on the
subject of Sunday night movies, but rather to his
manner of expressing them.
Being an of realism, I personally see
nothing wrong with the Sunday night movies; nev
ertheless I can appreciate Mr. R. Connell's view
given from the standpoint of his own moral con
victions.
In disagreeing with Mr. Ralph Connell I can see
no need for Mr. Evan Connell to be so extremely sar
castic. Surely a supposedly adult man does not
have to resort to such a diatribe to put his point
across. It seems to me he could be just as effective
and institute much more good will by presenting his
views in a more tolerant, more objective, and less
highly emotional manner.
Although I acknowledge the validity of Mr. E.
Council's argument I feel he has lost his point by
vindictiveness.
Does it not seem reasonable that a man who is so
tolerant and broadminded concerning modern trends
of thought should feci the same way towards those
who disagree with him?
