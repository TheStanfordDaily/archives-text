# Ink Antics Cease As Room Turns Into Phone Booth
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
For years now, i ifle team aspir
ants have stolen into the ink room
of the Main Libe to get jn their
daily practice. This room, the scene
of many a raging battle, is located
to the right of the Main Libe en
trance and directly to the left of
the Engineering Libe. Today as the
innocent frosh opens the door of
this little cubbyhole to (ill his pen,
he is literally shocked at what he
sees.
Not only are the walls covered
with the splotches and tell - tale
stains of industrious past-year prac
tice, but wielders of the deadly Par
ker 51 have reached the very ceil
ing of the place and splotched and
spattered until its original color is
barely visible.
Over against one wall is a shelf
lined with sheet metal, and contain
ing what were formerly known as
"ink drawers." These drawers at
one time were filled with ink, and
through the holed openings in the
top of the shelf students would dip
and load their pens. '
And it wasn't enough just to load
up and fire volleys around the
room. Some of the more industrious
lads jimmied open the drawers and
started tossing them around. This
really inked things up.
Well, the good old days are over.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of j
buildings and grounds, says that the
firing range will be turned into a
telephone booth, and the "dead- i
eyes'* will have to look for another
practice range.
According to Mr. Blacker, "Even
if we converted the room back to
fit its original purpose, and out
lawed all the throwing around of
ink. the room still wouldn't be used.
Today most of the students have
their ink in their own rooms and
seldom figure on filling their pens
away from home."
