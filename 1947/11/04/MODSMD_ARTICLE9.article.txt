### BY UNITED PRESS 
With municipal elections scheduled for today in many cities
throughout California, voters in scattered areas also go to the
polls in special elections to fill vacancies in both houses of the
state legislature.
In San Francisco 373,153 voters are eligible to go to the polls
to elect a mayor, district attorney, sheriff, municipal judge and six super
visors.
They will also vote on 26 propositions, one of which will settle the
controversy of whether the cily will keep its picturesque, historic cable
cars.
Seven of the propositions call for a total of $87,000,000 in bond issues
for improvements to transportation, traffic, water and recreation facilities,
and have been dubbed the "progress bonds" by their backers. •
Chief interest has centered on the race for a successor to present
Mayor Roger Lapham, who is not seeking reelection. Three candidates who
have waged a hot, three-way battle are Chester R. MacPhee, a city
supervisor and businessman; Superior Judge Elmer E. Robinson, and
Representative Franck R. Havenner, D., Calif.
A fourth candidate is Frank A. Barbaria, Socialist Workers party
member.
