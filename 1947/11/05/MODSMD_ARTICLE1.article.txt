# Pajama Clad Frosh To Parade Tonight; Rally, Movie on Tap
## 
### 
A Mardi Gras spirit will descend upon the campus tonight
when the freshman class comes out in pajamas for its first big
class activity of the year.
A gala evening of parades, rallying, serenading, and movies
to help the new frosh give vent to their rapidly rising "Stanford

spirit" is being planned by Rally
Com under the chairmanship of Hap
Black and Nan Shepherd.
The Class of '51 will give its reply
to the campus's "To H with '51"
at an all-campus SC game rally in
the Pavilion, when frosh tradition
ally "raise the roof."
MEET AT ENCINA
The Pajamarino begins at 7:15
p.m., when all male frosh, including
those at the Village, gather in front
of Encina Hall dressed in pajamas.
With the band they will march up
to the Row, then down the Row,
singing and yelling above the jeers
of last year's freshmen.
At the Post Office the frosh wom
en, who will be led there from their
living groups by Rally Com mem
bers, will join the parade and
proceed to the Pavilion. Branner
women will meet the parade at the
corner in back of the temporary
buildings.
RALLY AT 3
The rally at the Pavilion begins
at 8 p.m. Art Rosenbaum, member
of the San Francisco Chronicle
sports staff, with Coach Marchie
Schwartz and plenty of yelling and
singing will highlight the pre-SC
game rally according to Black.
Immediately after the rally Bran- I
ner and Roble freshmen will go to
Roble Hall, where their pajama
decked classmates assisted by the
band will serenade them.
The evening's festivities will end
at the Cubberley Auditorium at the
showing of '41 Rose Bowl game
movies to the men of '51.

liootcrs are requested to cut
out this song and take it with
them to the Pajamarino tally and
on the trek to SC:
STANFORD FOREVER
On, men of Stanford,
The vict'ry awaits you.
Our foes shall tremble
As our valor they see.
Hail! Loval sons
Of the all-conquering Card'nal!
Stanford forever
Rings our cry of victory.

In the Pavilion the frosh men will
sit on the floor in the center, and
frosh women will sit in the stands
on the far side of the Pavilion to
ward the swimming pool, Black
said.
It Ls hoped damage to the campus
and Pavilion will be avoided by the
omission of hazing. The chairmen
ask frosh men to be especially care
ful in Cubberley Auditorium.
