# UN Admits Spain Delegates

### 
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 4 (UP).- I The UNESCO executive council voted
today to admit representatives of the Spanish republican government
to the organization's general assembly but said they may follow the work
of the assembly only "in an unofficial capacity."
The council refused a request of the Spanish republican government
on Oct. 10 that it be allowed to send an official observer. The council
said the assembly's rules of procedure prevented approval of the request.
Republican Spain is not a member of the United Nations.
The council also approved a motion to allow China to pay its annual
contribution to UNESCO entirely in French francs, which is the so-called
"working currency" of UNESCO.
