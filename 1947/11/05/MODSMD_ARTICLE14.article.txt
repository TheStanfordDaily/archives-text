### 
CHANGCHUN, Wednesday, Nov. 5 (UP).—The nationalist armies
in Manchuria will attempt a final, decisive offensive in the spring to clear
out all communist forces, General Pan Yu-Kun said today.
General Pan, who commands the famed First Army of Manchuria, said
a final defeat would be inflicted on the communists by attacking them
"wherever they may be found." This would mean a departure from the
usual nationalist tactics of sticking closely to railroad lines and roads,
and going out into open country after the enemy.
This may mean an attack upon the Harbin stronghold of the Reds,
Pan intimated, depending upon where the strength of the communists was
concentrated.
"Our present aim is not to occupy cities," he said, "but to destroy the
main communist strength. The outcome of the civil war will be decided
in Manchuria—the only stronghold remaining to the communists after
their defeat at Yenan."
