# Houses List 53 Floats
## 
### 
Fifty-three houses have entered
floats in the Big Game Homecoming
parade, stated Phyllis Graham, float
chairman for Cardinals, which is
sponsoring the Homecoming. Only
one campus group, Sigma Chi, failed
to enter a float. Of the 53 entries,
four houses will have to change their
themes because of a duplication or
some other difficulty.
THEME CHANGES
Changes in themes may he made
in the ASSU office until Friday by
any house already signed up, said
Miss Graham, just as long as they
are not duplications of ideas already
turned in. The general theme of the
parade is "Stanford Cavalcade."
Six floats from the Village have
also been entered in the parade, and
five Eating Clubs have entered
floats, stated Miss Graham.
HOUSE DECORATIONS
Miss Graham urge all campus
houses to decorate their houses, as
well as entering floats. House dec
orations need not follow the "Stan
ford Cavalcade" theme, she said.
All decorations in or near houses
should be fireproof, stated Miss
Graham, and the firechief should be
consulted.
Houses can rent trucks from Truck
Rental in Palo Alto for the parade,
said Bob Levison, parade chairman.
The judges' stand will be on the
left-hand side of the parade as it
goes between Quad and the Library.
Houses should construct their floats
with this in mind, said Miss Gra
ham.
FOOTBALL MOVIES
Cardinals sponsored movies of the
USC-Stanford football game will be
shown in Cubberley Auditorium
next Wednesday night at 7:30, stated
Bob Coate, Cardinal in charge of
football movies. The Oregon State
football movies will be shown this
week at a time to be announced
later, stated Coate.
