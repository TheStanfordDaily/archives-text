# Pursuit of Lone Frosh Starts Pajamarino Tradition
## 
### MARGE SAMPSON 
With nightshirts flying, a group of
freshmen chased one of the too-vo-
I coferous brethren all over the cam
i pus one night in 1004. And that was
Because the boys were freshmen,
the Pajamarino was an established
] tradition at Stanford.
Because the boys were feshmen,
; it was decided that they would hold
; the Pajamarino just before the Lit-
I tic Big Game, when the freshmen
' played the University of California.
The tradition developed its own rit
j uai as the years went by. until it
finally included the torchlight pa
rade down the Row. the rally at the
Pavilion, the serenading of Roble,
and the free show in Paly.
"Clad in the latest evening attire,
and hearing aloft, the pictured face
j of a freshman's dream, the class of
'34 swept down the Row to Roble
! last night in the first and last Stan
ford roughs' fashion parade of the
year," stated The Daily of Nov. 7,
1930.
But it wasn't until Nov. 4, 1932,
that the pajama - clad frosh were
invited to a free show in Paly. A
j special section of the theater was
' roped off for the frosh, and they
I were let in only if they were wear
j ing their p.j.'s.
But even more happened that
night. As The Daily put it: "Gal
j loping through the nethermost cor
| ridors of bedtime Roble, pajama

tails Hying, and with sponsors and
the Roble president in hot pursuit,
eighteen Encina yearlings last night
made the most intimate tour the
Bastille has experienced in the last
six years."
It was pure coincidence that the
Pajamarino ever became a part of
the USC-Stanford game. Until 1935
the rally had been held to raise the
spirit of the frosh for the Little Big
Game. That year the frosh game
and the USC game were to be held
the same day, and it was decided
to hold the rallies simultaneously.
The frosh took themselves a little
too seriously in 1936. and on Oct. 22
they proceeded to tear up the town.
After serenading Roble, the boys
went into Paly, smashed windows
and neon signs, and when the po
lice chased them out, the frosh went
into Menlo Park to do the same
thing. Drastic action was taken,
and the next year Excom decided
that "The annual freshman Pajama
rino will return to its old-time
"safe and sane" status when the pa
jama-clad of '41 caravan down Palm
Drive to a free show at the Varsity
Theater after the SC game rally
Nov. 4."
During the war. the Pajamarino
was discontinued, but it recovered
quickly in 1946 when the Class of
'50 carried on the tradition in fine
style, even managing to again in
vade Roble.


Freshmen prepare for tonight's traditional pajamerino. annual free-for-all rally which precedes the SC
game. The rally will include a torchlight parade down the row, a rally at the Pavilion, serenade of Ruble,
and a free show in Paly. Observers of the parade arc urged to watch out for tomatoes, water-bagging, and
flying missiles. Hie frosh state that anyone is fair game. —-Photo by Howard GarricU

But it wasn't until Nov. 4, 1932,
that the pajama - clad frosh were
invited to a free show in Paly. A
j special section of the theater was
' roped off for the frosh, and they
I were let in only if they were wear
j ing their p.j.'s.
But even more happened that
night. As The Daily put it: "Gal
j loping through the nethermost cor
| ridors of bedtime Roble, pajama

tails Hying, and with sponsors and
the Roble president in hot pursuit,
eighteen Encina yearlings last night
made the most intimate tour the
Bastille has experienced in the last
six years."
It was pure coincidence that the
Pajamarino ever became a part of
the USC-Stanford game. Until 1935
the rally had been held to raise the
spirit of the frosh for the Little Big
Game. That year the frosh game
and the USC game were to be held
the same day, and it was decided
to hold the rallies simultaneously.
The frosh took themselves a little
too seriously in 1936. and on Oct. 22
they proceeded to tear up the town.
After serenading Roble, the boys
went into Paly, smashed windows
and neon signs, and when the po
lice chased them out, the frosh went
into Menlo Park to do the same
thing. Drastic action was taken,
and the next year Excom decided
that "The annual freshman Pajama
rino will return to its old-time
"safe and sane" status when the pa
jama-clad of '41 caravan down Palm
Drive to a free show at the Varsity
Theater after the SC game rally
Nov. 4."
During the war. the Pajamarino
was discontinued, but it recovered
quickly in 1946 when the Class of
'50 carried on the tradition in fine
style, even managing to again in
vade Roble.


Freshmen prepare for tonight's traditional pajamerino. annual free-for-all rally which precedes the SC
game. The rally will include a torchlight parade down the row, a rally at the Pavilion, serenade of Ruble,
and a free show in Paly. Observers of the parade arc urged to watch out for tomatoes, water-bagging, and

With nightshirts flying, a group of
freshmen chased one of the too-vo-

Because the boys were freshmen,
the Pajamarino was an established
