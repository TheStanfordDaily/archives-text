# 'Cellar Pete' Tells Highlights Of Seven-Year Stay on Farm

j One of the first persons new
| Stanford students get to know is
Ivtcr Keesmaat, genial clerk be
! hind the counter at the Cellar.
Called "Pete" by everyone, he is
' the person who always has a smile
for students as they rush up to the
Cellar to buy cigarettes or candy
between classes. '
j Born in Amsterdam, Holland, 44
years ago, Pete came to America in
1!i23. He came to Stanford in the
fall of 1941, after having worked in
a store in Palo Alto for 10 years.
Speaking of working at Stanford,
Pete said, "Working here at Stan
ford is different than working in a
city store. You get to know every
body. Even though there is often a
large crowd, the students are easy
to wait on."
The most exciting experience that
has happened to Pete while he has
been on duty was the attempted
theft of the Stanford Axe in the
spring of 1946.
"I was just closing up the Cellar,"
said Pete. "It must have been
around 11 o'clock, when six fellows
came in and jumped on me. They
broke the case and took the Axe.
They started out of the Cellar, in
tending to take me with them.
When they got outside there was
an officer who arrested them and
rescued the Axe. He had been
called because someone had noticed
people trying to break in."
7 , he fellows turned out to be six
University of California students,
two of whom were members of the
varsity football team and were dis

qualified for part of the following
season.
"Fortunately," Pete added, ' I was
not (.n duty the night last year
when the Axe was successfully sto
len. One of those experiences is
enough for me."
Pete spoke hesitantly of the drive
which was held for him last year
for clothing which he sent to Eu
rope. Knowing that he had been
sending clothes to his family in
Amsterdam since the end of the
war, Union Unit sponsored an all
campus clothing drive last fall.
"It was wonderful," he said.
"Boxes of clothing came in all the
time. IL was a job getting them
ready to send to my family and
friends, but the responses I have re
ceived have made it seem like no
work at all. I hope that the Stan
ford students realize how much that
drive meant to everyone."
Pete was received by Princess
Juliana of the Netherlands when
she was visiting the Stanford cam
pus. Anthony Sokol, Germanic lan
guages professor, was escorting her
around and, realizing that he was
Dutch, asked her if she would like
to speak to him.
"I felt quite honored by the in
terview." said Pete. "Although we
had only a few minutes before she
had to leave, I found her very gra
cious and generous."
Pete said that he had noticed very
little difference between the stu
dents of war-time Stanford and the
present students, except of course
that there are many more of them
and they keep him very busy. He
mentioned how good it was to see
so many familiar faces returning to
the Farm after the war.
