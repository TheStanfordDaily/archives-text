# Naples University To Receive Funds
## 
### 
The University of Naples will re
ceive 110 per cent of the proceeds
from the Stanford Relief Fund
Drive which will be held from
Monday through Saturday nexrt
v/eek.
The university was founded in
1221 and its faculty has included St.
Thomas Aquinas, Bocaecio, and
Giambattista Vico, the Italian hu
manist.
LIBRARY BURNED
During the last war the Univer
sity was occupied by the Germans,
who attempted to burn it before
they evacuated Naples. They failed
to destroy the whole school but did
systematically burn the library in
cluding its books.
The university also suffered from
bombings by both Allied and Axis
planes. This has caused an acute
housing shortage for the record en
rollment of 27,000, four times the
normal number. Building materials
are also lacking to provide housing
facilities for these students, accord
ing to Molly Shaw, co-chairman of
the drive, who visited the univer
sity this summer.
FOOD NEEDED
Miss Shaw also said that the lack
of food and clothing was serious be
cause of the large number of people
there and the transportation diffi
culties. A faculty committee has
been set up at the university to aid
the students, but help is urgently
needed from abroad, Miss Shaw
said.
The students body officers of Na
ples are eager to find out about
American universities and the ac
tivities of the students. They would
also like to have correspondence
and exchanges between the schools
and their students on a permanent
basis, said Miss Shaw.
