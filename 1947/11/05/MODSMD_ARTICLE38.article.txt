# Pastries Wanted By Student Relief
## 
### 
Wanted! Homemade cakes and
pies!
Student Relief Drive is calling for
donations of cakes and pies from
any living group on campus to sell
at the all-campus feed on Nov. 14,
according to Betty White, chairman
of the feed.
The feed will give students a
chance to enjoy cake and coffee
| during their free hours and will
raise money for the drive.
For information about pie and
cake donations call Betty Fennin at
Storey House.
