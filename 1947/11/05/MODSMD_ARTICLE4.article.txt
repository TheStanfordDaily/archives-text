Dear Eddie:
You ask for a story, some jest, or
a yarn. You offer a dinner for two
at 010 Longbarn. < Where do you
get that two stuff???! But how can
I think of an interesting joke?
When already I am tired, hungry,
and broke.
—Jim?
Jim is getting his dinner (one*
when he sends in his last name.
—Ed.
<1 Cl ft <•
NEXT—Hcrt«ist and Horsa.
Hcngist and his brother Horsa
founded the Kingdom of Kent.
Since Hcngist Id. 488 outlived
Horsa <d. 455 , he was unable to
bequeath the rule to him, with
that stirring phrase, "My Kingdom
For a Horse." Neither of the broth
ers sent contributions to Eddie, and
thus arc little known to posterity.
