# Varsity Water Poloists, Olympic Clubbers Vie
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
With their season's record now standing at three won and
three lost, Stanford's varsity water poloists pit their superior
endurance and speed against the experience of the veteran
Olympic Club squad in a rematch tonight at 8:00 in the San
Francisco Crystal Plunge Pool. For the Indians, the game will be

by way of a warm-up for Friday's"
all-important conference tilt with
USC, as well as an opportunity
to avenge the 15 to 6 pasting they
took from the Flying-0 team at the
first of the season.
The Stanford mermen have the
advantage of playing the contest in
the large Crystal Plunge Pool, where
their greater speed will pay off to
better advantage. The more exper
ienced but slower Olympic Clubbers
are almost impossible to beat in their
own smaller pool because they don't
have to cover as much territory.
The Cards will go into this non
conference battle minus the services
of Harry Borchers, high scoring for
ward, who was struck in the eye
during the rough-and-tumble Troy
game in Los Angeles last weekend.
Borchers is expected to be ready to
go by Friday, but will be replaced
by Ken Fox in tonight's fracas.
Coach Tom Haynie will attempt
to stop such high-scoring Olympic
Clubbers as Em Cashin, Don Bean
ston, and Ken Richards with his
starting lineup of Jim Armstrong,
Walter Lull, and Fox at the for
wards, Fritz Maurer at centerback,
Dick Narvcr and Ralph Sala at the j
guards, and Don Hester at goal.
