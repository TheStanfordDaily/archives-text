# Indians Take to Air in Practice; Bell, Morris, Campbell Toss Pigskin
## 
### 
In an effort to add a little polish i
to their aerial attack the Stanford
varsity football team went through a
light passing drill in yesterday's
practice session. Coach Schwartz put
his lads though calisthenics drills
and stressed pass defense in the later
stages of the drill.
While quarterbacks Bell, Morris,
and Campbell were alternating the
first two strings on the overhead
attack, the remainder of the varsity
and the junior varsity went through
a hard scrum with each squad hit
ting paydirt once.
The Indians will practice today
and tomorrow and will leave tomor
row night on the Lark for Los An
geles. Schwartz expects to field his
strongest team of the year for the
USC contest, but will be.without the
services of Mickey Titus, Bob Rohrer
and John Whipple.

improved blocks (like GEORGE QUIST'S above) and tackles the Cards turned in their best performance to
date, and deserved a better fate than 1.'5 to 7 setback. —Photo by John Crown
