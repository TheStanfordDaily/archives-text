### WAYNE SARGENT 
Was talking to a coed the other day about beauty.
The feminine variety.
The discussion arose out of the statement by Doro
thy Thomas over at Roble that "eight out of ten
women have ugly knees and hips."
Every age has its own standards of beauty and
if this particular age doesn't correspond with what
I think of as beauty, then far be it from me to hold
up a classical example.
What I had in mind of course was Venus de Milo.
She was the goddess of love you know, and is said
to have risen from the foam of the sea. That's why
they sometimes call her Aphrodite, meaning foam
born.
Today she'd be more popular if she were the
goddess of hops and had risen from the foam of a 15
cent beer.
There has always been an argument as to why
she has no arms. Some say she was nervous and
bit her fingernails. Others say she owed the ad
ministration money. I don't know the real answer,
and I leave it to you to debate. It's an 'armless
question.
What I want to know is when did hips and knees
become ugly, or have they always been that way. I
used to enjoy looking at them myself, but now I
don't know.

Trouble is I have always been confused about
anatomy.
For example, I read in the paper where a woman
got "shot by a .22 rifle and the bullet was in her
yet." That sort of thing puts me to wondering. It's
terrible to be confused.
I'll find someone to put me straight on the deal.
I guess all this stuff about women's fashions being
forced on them by the designers is so much malarky.
What actually happened is some bright women found
out that knees and hips are ugly so they just decided
to hide them like alcohol breath at a Presbyterian
picnic. What gripes me is that I've been fooled
all these years into thinking knees and hips were
beautiful.
Come to think of it I only know one girl with an
hourglass figure. And with her all the sand is
clogged at 4 o'clock. That's an old gag, but the
girl I'm thinking about is no youngster herself.
And as far as the "new look" hiding the ugly
gibbosities of the feminine form, I think my old
English professor hit the nail on the head when he
said:
"A woman's dress and an english essay should be
similar in length. They both should be short enough
to be interesting and long enough to covcr the
subject."
