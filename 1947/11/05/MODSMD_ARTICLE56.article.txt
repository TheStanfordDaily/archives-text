"The greatest strength of the totalitarian state lies
in its ability to force imitation by its competitors."—
A.Hitler.
I haVe never been one to look on Mr. Hitler as a
great philosopher, or as a man that will go down
in history as an intellectual, although his name will
doubtless grace many tomes to haunt future West
ern Civ students.
But as a truism this statement seems to contain
much food for thought for all of those Americans
who have compounded U.S.S.R. and totalitarianism
and have come to the conclusion that A equals Band
B equals A and both equal C.
If Russia is the totalitarian state that most of our
"realistic" thinkers of the present era hold it to be;
and if there is but one choice for all good red-blooded
American citizens to take during the present "crisis,"
that is to follow the state department's lead and to
support the "cold war," the war of economic status
quo, then it also behooves these citizens to remem
ber Mr. Hitler's statement and watch other phases of
their country's policies and reactions to this "war."
Mr. Thomas convicts Hollywood writers by in
timidation; employees are dropped from government
payrolls for belonging to "front" organizations (a
general term at best); 100 top "leaders" in Washing
ton work out plans for a mobilization of our in
dustrial potential; citizens who continue to speak
out for their private opinions are labeled "reds" and
dismissed from public surveillance; and even on
the Stanford campus a group of not more than 25
"dangerous" characters are forced to meet in a tennis
court at the Village, which might mean something
to all those loyal readers of the causes of the French
Revolution (the oath of the tennis court at the meet-

ing of the estates-general by the then lowly bour
geoisie.
Something has gone wrong with our vaunted sys
tem of free speech, free assembly, and even freedom
of religion. It seems a new religion has taken over
lately, the religion of conformity. Everyone must have
not only the "new look," but the "new talk" as well.
If a man likes to hear Robeson sing, and after the
concert he is a member of an audience when Robeson
pleads for racial tolerance, which has also been
pleaded for recently by a man named Truman, this
man can be attacked by his neighbors as a "Com
munist" under Mr. Monjou's recent ruling. (And by
the way, who is Mr. Monjou? A nice little man, with
a brain to match that looked well in double-breasted
suits in 1921 and has looked and thought that way
ever since.)
We hear attacks on Russia every day. "No free
doms." "They all wear the same kind of clothes."
"They all think the same way." Are we supposed to
fall into a mould to destroy a mould?
We talk of democracy, of the overpowering
strength of ideas and ideals, of free nations and free
enterprise. Yet we spend half of our time looking
for new bogies and Vanzetti's to force our own people
to accept the very type of moulded thinking they
are supposed to be mobilizing against.
"Is life so dear, and peace so sweet as to be pur
chased at the price of slavery?" Patrick Henry said
no, and spoke out. How many Americans will say
no today and defend precious liberties within their
boundaries on the strength of a conviction that in
democracy there is strength, the sapping and growing
kind of strength that can defeat totalitarianism any
time, anywhere.

Something has gone wrong with our vaunted sys

lately, the religion of conformity. Everyone must have
not only the "new look," but the "new talk" as well.
If a man likes to hear Robeson sing, and after the
concert he is a member of an audience when Robeson
pleads for racial tolerance, which has also been
pleaded for recently by a man named Truman, this
man can be attacked by his neighbors as a "Com
munist" under Mr. Monjou's recent ruling. (And by
the way, who is Mr. Monjou? A nice little man, with
a brain to match that looked well in double-breasted
suits in 1921 and has looked and thought that way
ever since.)
We hear attacks on Russia every day. "No free
doms." "They all wear the same kind of clothes."
"They all think the same way." Are we supposed to
fall into a mould to destroy a mould?
We talk of democracy, of the overpowering
strength of ideas and ideals, of free nations and free
enterprise. Yet we spend half of our time looking
for new bogies and Vanzetti's to force our own people
to accept the very type of moulded thinking they
are supposed to be mobilizing against.
"Is life so dear, and peace so sweet as to be pur
chased at the price of slavery?" Patrick Henry said
no, and spoke out. How many Americans will say
no today and defend precious liberties within their
boundaries on the strength of a conviction that in
democracy there is strength, the sapping and growing
kind of strength that can defeat totalitarianism any
time, anywhere.
"The greatest strength of the totalitarian state lies
in its ability to force imitation by its competitors."—
A.Hitler.
I haVe never been one to look on Mr. Hitler as a
great philosopher, or as a man that will go down
in history as an intellectual, although his name will
doubtless grace many tomes to haunt future West
ern Civ students.
But as a truism this statement seems to contain
much food for thought for all of those Americans
who have compounded U.S.S.R. and totalitarianism
and have come to the conclusion that A equals Band
B equals A and both equal C.
If Russia is the totalitarian state that most of our
"realistic" thinkers of the present era hold it to be;
and if there is but one choice for all good red-blooded
American citizens to take during the present "crisis,"
that is to follow the state department's lead and to
support the "cold war," the war of economic status
quo, then it also behooves these citizens to remem
ber Mr. Hitler's statement and watch other phases of
their country's policies and reactions to this "war."
Mr. Thomas convicts Hollywood writers by in
