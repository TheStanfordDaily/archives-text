## ABOUT BRIDGE RALLY 
### 
To the Editor:
The much disputed editorial written presumably
by Don Davies about the rally for the bridge team
contained several excellent points. Mr. Davies, with
remarkable foresight, was able to see what a com
plete satire, on everything the alums hold dear, that
rally would be. True to his expectations, the pseudo
evil yell leader conducted a clever but thorough
fun-fest which involved all the time-honored tradi
tions as well as two contemporary teams.
Sure it was a good show . . . but what about the
feelings of the two teams at whose expense the
rally was held? How would the men who have been
kicked around in five straight games feel at the im
plications that the bridge team was more worthy of
a spirited rally than they?
And what about the bridge team that was ob
viously picked as the very opposite extreme in
intercollegiate endeavor? It was fortunate that the
spectators didn't read implications into the fifteen
minutes of fun . . . could the rally have been carried
off three weeks ago? Or was it successful merely
because the football season is considered ridiculous?
That's undoubtedly what the grid players are won
dering. Again the campus has seen evidences of the
mis-channeling of young Tom Elke's boundless
energy.
I admire Don Davies' courage in sticking his neck
out in defense of the minority rather than going
along with the gay, fun-loving throng. It always
'seems to me that the ones who think of others are the
ones who get kicked in the teeth. It is indeed for
tunate that the rally was successful for it could
easily have been the dismal failure to end all dismal

failures. Orchids to Davies for having the sensitivity
to sec how those very deeply involved would feel.
