# EUROPEAN RELIEF FUNDS
## 
### 
To the Editor:
On November 17 Congress will meet at the request
of the President. One of its purposes in convening
in special session will be to discuss and do something
about the imminent mass starvation and collapse of
the European people.
During the week of November 10 the Stanford
International Relief Organization will conduct a
Four Feathers' Drive. Fifty percent of the money
collected for this drive will be used for SIRO proj
ects, the rest for the Community Youth Fund and
miscellaneous charities.
During this past war the War Chest collected
and functioned as the central clearing house and
allocation board for all monies needed by the USO,
the Red Cross, the YMCA, etc.
It has been predicted that the coming discus
sion in Congress will be primarily political in nature,
and that no adequate bi-partisan program will evolve.
This must not happen if the people of Europe are to
live.
An organization comparable in structure, but
more far-reaching in its activities than the War
Chest, drawing support from all the people and or
ganizations in this country might possibly save this
continent. This, in addition to, or in combination
with, governmental funds which, although sure to be
forthcoming will be insufficient, might possibly save
western civilization,
