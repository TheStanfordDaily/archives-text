# Frosh to Parade Flashy Pajamas
## 
### 
Over at Encina and down at the
Village, Class of '51 men are un
wrapping their flashiest silken bed
wear and bringing the long woolens
out of the mothballs in preparation
for the traditional pajamarino to be
held as part of the send-off rally
program tonight.
In anticipation of the traditional
"serenade" at Roble, the Encinamen
and Village frosh have been relig
iously exercising their vocal cords
during thee past week so that the
pure strains of the old Stanford
favorites will float upward to wait
ing Roble Juliets in true harmony.
