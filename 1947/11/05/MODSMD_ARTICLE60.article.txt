# Two Financial Amendments Proposed for Village Charter
## 
### 
Two amendments to the Stanford Village Constitution were approved
for consideration at the Village Council's meeting Tuesday night. They
will be published at the various houses and voted on at the next meeting.
The first amendment states that all students living in the single
men and women's living units shall pay club dues of two dollars a quarter.

Under the second proposed
amendment a Village fund would
be established to finance the various
Village activities. The Village Coun
cil would be empowered to collect
a portion of each man's club dues
to provide for the fund. The amount
of the collection shall be determined
by a two-thirds vote of the total
Council membership.
It was also moved at the meet
ing to invite Excom to hold their
next meeting at the Village Auditor
ium on Wednesday, Nov. 12.
Dwight Adams, Village Director,
told the group that traffic rules in
the Village are going to be more
rigidly enforced. In addition to ci
tations for illegal parking, tickets
will be given henceforth for not
obeying stop signs, and for careless
driving.
