Bacteria and other low forms of
life will have a better chance to
survive than man in an atomic war,
Dr. Douglas M. Whitaker, dean of
the School of Biological Sciences,
told a Tuesday Evening Series au
dience ast night.
Speaking on "Bikini and the Bio
logical Aspects of Atomic Develop
ment," the Stanford zoologist, who
was a member of a scientific expe
dition to Bikini Atoll last summer,
stated that lower forms of plant and
animal life tolerate vastly greater
quantities of radiation than man and
other higher vertebrates.
LOWER FORMS PERSIST
"If man should eliminate himself
from the earth, which is highly un
likely," Dr. Whitaker said, "these
lower forms may still be expected
to persist."
In man, he said, atomic radiation
selectively damages those tissues of
the body which.are undergoing rap
id cell division. Accordingly, ab
normal embryos may be produced
and, in the adult body, sterility,
anemia, and inability to combat dis
eases caused by lack of white blood
cells commonly result from irradi
ation.
HEREDITARY CHANGES
"Even more important than dam
ages to the individual are the her
editary changes, known as muta
tions, that are induced by radia
tion," he continued.
"Most of them, however, will not
appear until the second or third
succeeding generations, and many
of them are expected to be elimi
nated by prenatal death and mis
carriage."
Japanese and American scientists
in Japan are making long - range
studies of this phase of radiation, he
declared.
EFFECTS CONTINUE
Radioactivity still persists at Bi
kini a year after atomic bomb tests
were completed, he stated, most of
it caused by the underwater bomb
â€”Test Baker. This is because sea
water retains great quantities of
radioactive materials instead of dis
persing them in the air.
