# Shakespeare's Tragedy 'Richard III' Opens Tonight For Three-Day Run on Memorial Auditorium Stage
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
"Richard III," the Stanford
Players' production of William
Shakespeare's great tragedy,
will open tonight at 8:15 in the
Memorial Auditorium, with add
itional showings tomorrow and Sat
urday. It promises to be one of the
finest productions ever seen at Stan
ford.
When the first-night curtain
goes up it will reveal a platform
stage similar to those used in Eliz
abethan times. Employed by Shake
speare in his Globe Theatre in Lon
don, this platform stage technique
utilizes multiple levels and plat
forms extending out into the audi
torium and facilitates rapid scenery
changes.
UNUSUAL SET
The set was designed by Dr. A.
Nicholas Vardac in an effort to catch
the robust color of Elizabethan stage
production and to make possible
practically continuous action, with
only one intermission.
"Richard HI" moves against the
background of the bitter English
Wars of the Roses and is the story of
the retribution which descends up
on the usurper, Richard 111, and the
House of York for their crimes
against the Lancastrians.
Roy Poole, a 25-year-old Army
veteran, will be starred in the title
role, having had considerable
perience in Shakespearean plays. He
is well-remembered for his splendid
portrayal of MacDufY in last year's I
production of "Macbeth" by the i
Stanford Players.
FINEST PART
Poole considers Richard the finest j
part he has ever played. "I doubt
trait you'll find a more malignant
man in the history of literature," he
stated. "Richard literally murders
his way to the throne of England,
and Shakespeare doesn't hesitate to
have the murders committed right
before the audience's eyes."
Co-starred with Roy Poole are
Nancy De Groot as Princess Ann;
Ruth Fisher, Queen Elizabeth;
Richard Egan, Duke of Buckingham;
Usher Wilson, Lord Hastings; Nancy
MacNaughl, Queen Margaret; Del
Carlson, Lord Cntesby; Mel Ellett,
Duke of Richmond; and Patrick
Shannon, King Edward IV.
The Stanford varsity fencing team
will be featured in the climactic
battle between the forces of Rich
mond, bent on saving England, and
Richard's followers.
ACCURATE COSTUMES
Another highlight of "Richard
III" will be accuracy in costuming.
The heraldic devices of Richard's
time have been carefully copied and
will be displayed on the shields car
ried by the nobles. Richard and his
cohorts will wear red costumes,
Richmond and his followers will be
garbed in blue, and Edward IV and
his retinue will be dressed in green.
The production staff for "Richard
III" includes Dr. Vardac, director
and set designer; James McCulloch,
light plot; Virginia Opsvig, costum
ing; and Skipworth Athey, sound.
Allen Fletcher is student stage man
ager.
ORIGINAL MUSIC
Original music for the production 1
has been composed and arranged by I
Dr. Leonard Ratncr, who will con- 1
duct a seven-piece orchestra in the !
incidental music.
The Stanford Players have gone
all-out in producing "Richard III".

DR. NICHOLAS VARDAC, di
rector of the Stanford Players'
production of "Richard HI," dis
cusses a fine point in stage tech
nique with Richard 111 and Prin
cess Ann, better known to Stan
ford as Roy Poole and Nancy Dc
Groot. "Richard III" opens to
night at 8:15 in the Memorial Au
ditorium.
"Richard III," the Stanford
Players' production of William
Shakespeare's great tragedy,
will open tonight at 8:15 in the
Memorial Auditorium, with add
itional showings tomorrow and Sat
urday. It promises to be one of the
finest productions ever seen at Stan
ford.
When the first-night curtain
goes up it will reveal a platform
stage similar to those used in Eliz
abethan times. Employed by Shake
speare in his Globe Theatre in Lon
don, this platform stage technique
utilizes multiple levels and plat
forms extending out into the audi
torium and facilitates rapid scenery
changes.
UNUSUAL SET
The set was designed by Dr. A.
Nicholas Vardac in an effort to catch
the robust color of Elizabethan stage
production and to make possible
practically continuous action, with
only one intermission.
"Richard HI" moves against the
background of the bitter English
Wars of the Roses and is the story of
the retribution which descends up
on the usurper, Richard 111, and the
House of York for their crimes
against the Lancastrians.
Roy Poole, a 25-year-old Army
veteran, will be starred in the title
role, having had considerable
perience in Shakespearean plays. He
is well-remembered for his splendid
portrayal of MacDufY in last year's I
production of "Macbeth" by the i
Stanford Players.
FINEST PART
Poole considers Richard the finest j
part he has ever played. "I doubt
trait you'll find a more malignant
man in the history of literature," he
stated. "Richard literally murders
his way to the throne of England,
and Shakespeare doesn't hesitate to
have the murders committed right
before the audience's eyes."
Co-starred with Roy Poole are
Nancy De Groot as Princess Ann;
Ruth Fisher, Queen Elizabeth;
Richard Egan, Duke of Buckingham;
Usher Wilson, Lord Hastings; Nancy
MacNaughl, Queen Margaret; Del
Carlson, Lord Cntesby; Mel Ellett,
