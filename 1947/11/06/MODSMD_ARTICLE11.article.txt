The Academy Award winning

lems.
A skit on the art of collection will

All workers, collectors, and living

RELIEF DRIVE OPENS MONDAY

Dirker stated that donors to the
drive may single out certain chari
ties for all their contributions or
exclude some entirely. This, he
said, applies especially to the fac

ed for donations to the Community
Youth Fund.
