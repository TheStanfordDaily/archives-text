# Burglars Enter Theta Chi House
## 
### 
The Theta Chi fraternity house
was robbed early yesterday morn
ing, sometime between 1 a.m. and
6:30 a.m., according to Gordon Da
vis, police chief. The robbery fol
lowed the pattern that, has become
familiar hereabouts: while the men
were asleep on a sleeping porch, an
unknown thief or thieves entered
the deserted bedrooms and rifled
their clothes, making off with $110
in cash and three wrist watches.
Exactly 11 days ago, on Oct. 2(5,
the Kappa Alpha house was bur
glarized. The method was the same:
while the men were asleep on a
sleeping porch, someone entered the
deserted bedrooms and "cleaned
out" their clothes.
There have been many such rob
beries over the years, particularly
during the last two or three years.
The thief or thieves seem to prefer
fraternity houses, so members are
particularly warned to devise somf
means of guarding their valuables
at night; above all, not to leave
them in a deserted bedroom, Davis
said.
Davis requests students to call the
police department, Palo Alto 3131,
if they see any suspicious charac
ters around their dwelling units,
either day or night.
If unable to detain the individual,
one should give the desk officer,
who is on duty day and night, all
pertinent information, a description
of the person, direction he is going,
and if he uses a car, a description
of it if possible. This will save the
officer the delay of first going to the
house.
