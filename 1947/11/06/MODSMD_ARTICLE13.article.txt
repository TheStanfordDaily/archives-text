# 'Gaieties' Promise Highest Quality In Costumes, Girls, Gags and Tunes
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
They'll be dancing in the streets down near Encina way, and
i there'll be cries of great joy playfully eddying in the breeze.
But the greatest proclamation of all will be a swiftly-paced
kind of Stanford laughter, the Gaieties of 1947, called "That's
Life."
Resplendent in fancy costumery and pretty girls, with a few

tunes and gags tossed here and
there, the Gaieties will herald the
birth of an ingenious plan of attack.
LIFE IS THEME
The entire show, currently basking
in the rays of rehearsal, will revolve
about a theme of Life, the magazine,
and its segments of departmentalized
entertainment.
"Life has finally come to the Gai
: eties," technical maestro Larry
| Frankley said, "and we're not kid
ding.
"We'll bo using a theatrical format
based on Life Magazine, a sort of

satire on the contemporary scene,"
he said.
DOMINANT FEATURES
Dominant features of the forth
coming Memorial Auditorium offer
ing are the state of the nation, the
United Nations, and the movie of
the week.
And if you become entangled in
an aura of expectancy, promises of
dancers, chorus girls, and Quad
trained singers will wash away the
dream.
Directed by George Eckstein, the
Gaieties show will open Nov. !!• as

a prelude to the Big Game.
With "H hour" but two weeks
away, the cast has been busily in
rehearsal nightly in the Ram's Head
room and on the Mem Aud stage,
i Huge canvas backdrops are lying
face down, and reams of music
scores arc strewn about the floor.
PEOPLE RUSHING
Everywhere people are rushing
; madly about to complete last minute
i details—revisions of scripts, casting
! of bits, and disseminating news of
; the affair about the campus.
"Life has comc to the Gaieties . ."
• That one big night when the fer
vor of autumnal madness is bathed
in "first nighter nervousness" will be
a moment one can remember until
the next Gaieties is born.
So oil up them thar shootin' irons,
brother, and make way for the Stan
ford Gaieties, a kind of campus
laughter that's been mighty hard to
forget.
