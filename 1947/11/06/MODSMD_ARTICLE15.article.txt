Stanford Flying Club members will meet on the third floor lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse tonight at 7:.'50 to discuss results of last
Saturday's Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Air Meet and to lay plans for
the club's future activity this quarter.
With winter weather closing in, club activities will pivot from
recreational flights to guest speakers, movies, ami bull sessions during
regular meetings in the Clubhouse.
While Saturday's air meet at the Livermorc Naval Air Station did
not enrich the club with any of the eight trophies, the contest did afford
the flyers a chance to pit their flying skill in near-impossible weather.
One of the events during (he meet aided by the stiff .'5O mile-per-hour
winds was the barrier landing contest. In the above picture Farm
pilot Ray Elsmore pulls bis plane over a six-foot string-streamer hurdle
before landing his 65-horsepower Acronca in as short a distance as
possible.
