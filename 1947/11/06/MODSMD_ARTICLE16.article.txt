# WORLD BRIEFS
## Elections Cheer Both Parties, Democrats Win in Kentucky 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 5 (UP).â€”
Republicans and Democrats alike
hastened to get on record with 1948
Presidential victory forecasts today
in the wake of yesterday's off-year
elections.
Neutral observers viewed the re
sults as significant but swamped by
too many state and local issues to
be taken as definite signposts for
next year's national campaign.
REPUBLICANS OUT
Chief interest was in Kentucky,
where the Democrats elected a
Governor and ended four years of
Republican rule. The Taft-Hartley
Labor Law was a prominent issue.
Democrats appeared to have
emerged from municipal voting
throughout the country with far
greater gains than the GOP. In San
Francisco, Superior Judge Elmer E.
Robinson, the conservative mayor

| alty candidate, soundly trounced
j labor-supported Franck Havenner.
RANKIN LOSES
Mississippi's stictly Democratic
fight for the late Theodore G. Bil
bo's Senate seat took top interest in
excitement. The result was in doubt
until late today when Circuit Judge
[ John C. Stennis finally was con-
J ceded victory over five other can
j didates.
Stennis had ignored the "white
| supremacy" tactics which made
Bilbo famous. His closest competi
tor was Rep. William M. Colmer,
who congratulated Stennis when
the latter showed no signs of losing
his lead. Rep. John E. Rankin, as
vocal as Bilbo on the race issue, was
out of the contest almost from the
start.
Three new House members were
elected in New York, Indiana, and
j Ohio without upsets.
