LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. 5 j
(UP). —Russia today lost its fight
against United Nations intervention
in Korea and then launched a heavy
attack on the American - inspired
United Nations "Little Assembly,"
protesting that the United States
had abandoned the principles of
Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam.
American Delegate John Foster
Dulles immediately replied that
war-time conferences of President
Roosevelt. Generalissimo Stalin, and j
Prime Minister Churchill "dealt de- j
cisively with the interests of smaller j
powers without their knowledge . . . I
behind their backs."
"We do not intend to meet in
secret and deal with and dispose of
the interests of third powers and I

we don't think anyone here would
approve such a system," Dulles said.
He said that such a system may
have been necessary in wartime,
but no longer practical, citing the
failure of direct negotiations be
tween the United States and Russia
on Korea as having forced the UN
to act.
The UN political committee today
approved a broad American pro
gram designed to lead Korea to in
dependence. It voted 46 to 0 to
create a nine-member commission
which would supervise Korean
elections before March 31, and pre
pare for withdrawal of Soviet-
American occupation forces within
! 90 days.
