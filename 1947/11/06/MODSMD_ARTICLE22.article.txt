# Rankin Declares Southern College Leadership Paves the Way for Recognition of Negroes
## 
### ELEANOR LAWRENCE 
College leadership is paving the
way to recognition of the true
worth of the Negro in the South,
contends Dr. Robert Rankin, visit
ing professor of political science
from Duke University, who • ap
plauds the improved attitude of
Southern students toward the Ne
gro.
Citing as an example the city of
Durham, North Carolina, which has
been called "the most progressive
city in the South," and which pro
vides environment for both Duke
and the University of North Caro
lina, Dr. Rankin points with pride
to a recent acclamation of his home
town by the Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
NEGROES IN CAMPUS
Proof of this progress was shown
by the action of two-thirds of
North Carolina's campus in voting
that they held no objections to ad
mitting Negroes ns students in the
university.

Gains are also being made in
non-academic activities, Dr. Rankin
explained, noting the election of
Negroes to several North Carolina
county offices last summer, and the
occasion of a Negro who placed
fifth in a field of 10 for the position
of county commissioner. Having
been conceded the right of suffrage,
at least theoretically, the Negro is
looking forward to the day when
he can hold office, not as an ex

| ception, but as a matter of course.
AGAINST WAY NEGRO VOTES
In actual practice, the South is
more against the way the Negro
votes than in the suppression of his
ballot rights, as witness, for ex
! ample, Ed Crump of Nashville

rounding up pro - machine Negro
voters from Shelby County when an
election runs close.
Much in the way of progress is
hampered by disagreement among
the Negrops themselves, however,
since a large faction would choose
an improved status in Negro-run
theaters, schools, banks, and busi
nesses in preference to semi-equal
ity in white institutions.
Dr. Rankin is teaching American
government, constitutional law, and
political parties at Stanford this
quarter.
