# Firehouse Boys Get an Education While Protecting Stanford Lands
## 
### ED BOOTH 
Some 9.000 acres of land, a popu- ■
lation of nearly 10.000, and an esti- ;
mated $25,000,000 worth of burnable i
property—these are the responsibili- |
ties of the Stanford University Fire :
Department. J
The fire department with a college |
education has progressed steadily |
since 1880, when Leland Stanford j
brought a hand pump from Boston j
to protect his stables and stock farm.
There was no real fire department
until 1890. Then, Stanford toasted
two hand-drawn hose carts. It was
not until 1913 that the department
acquired its first mechanized equip
ment.
MODERN EQUIPMENT
Today it is as modern and up-to- j
date as any fire department its size
in the country. The engine house of i
Santa Teresa Street has a brand ,
new pumping engine, a ladder truck. |
and two tank trucks which carry |
about 300 gallons of water apiece, j
Both tank trucks are equipped ;
with radio receiving sets to main- j
tain contact with the fire house at
all times. In addition, the chief's
car has a two way radio that not j
only keeps him in touch with the
station, but also with the Palo Altoj
police and fire departments and with
the fire warden's office in Redwood!

FIVE STARS
Fire Chief John Marston, the third i
chief in Stanford history, came he:!?,
in 1941 and wears five gold stars on
his uniform to attest to 22 years of !
service with various departments in i
the Bay Area. Once a volunteer
fireman, he was fire chief of Belmont
before coming here.
"The chief cause of fires on cam- j
pus has been carelessness with cig
arettes," said Chief Marston. "Such !
stunts as throwing lighted butts into !
waste baskets and dry grass caused
a majority of the fires that the de- !
partment handled. Even some auto
mobile fires were caused by lighted ;
butts getting into the upholstery.'" !
CHEM BUILDING FIRE
"The oddest fire we had was in the 1
Chem Building. We hustled over to
see gobs of smoke pouring out of j
the building, and before putting our j
hoses into play, discovered that the |
explosion had also scattered sodium j
all over the place and sodium, when I
united with water, explodes.
"We used high pressure fog to ex
tinguish the flames. However, even

the few water particles in the fog
were enough to set off explosions
that sounded like a Chinese new
year, and we lost a good-sized aud
ience. Everybody and his brother
took off for the hills with the first
bang," Marston said.

tectors of the Farm's 9,000 acres of land and 523.000.000 worth of
buildings.
