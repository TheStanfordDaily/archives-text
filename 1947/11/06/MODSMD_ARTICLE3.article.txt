There once was a lad from Enema
About Longbarn he couldn't have
been keener.
And whenever he wanted to take
her out,
You could always hear him shout,
"There is no placc finer for my
Evelina!"
—Barbara Moulton
F'givc me Barbara, I sure botched
it up.—Ed.
Winslow L. Christian says:
To have a thing is nothing if you've
not
The chance to show it.
And to know a thing is nothing
unless
Others know you know it.
