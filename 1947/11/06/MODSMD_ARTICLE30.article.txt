# Farm Greek Letter Fraternities Have Impressive Heritage from Founders
## 
### STU FITCH 
Even before the University had its official opening, Greek
letter fraternities were laying plans for chapters on the Stanford
campus. The first year saw the establishment of eight fraternities
and two sororities, boasting a total membership of 140 persons.
President David Starr Jordan, a fraternity man himself, ap-

proved of their establishment and
later felt that "the chapter houses
added much to the appearance of
the campus and have constituted an
important factor in Stanford's .so
cial life." Yet he also realized the
problems connected with independ
ent living groups.
ZETA PSI FIRST CHARTERED
The first fraternity to be char
tered on the campus was Zeta Psi,
followed closely by Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta,
and Sigma Nu. Later in the year
chapters of the Southern fraterni
ties Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Al
pha Tau Omega were established
and wished "a long life and pros
perity in a region so climatically
akin to the sunny birthplace of their
mother chapters."
Before the first chapter houses,
the Greeks continued to live at En
cina, but did arrange for separate
tables in the dining room. Then in
the spring of 1892 the University
began erecting a large campus club

house known as Lauro Hall, for the
unmarried professors who were liv
ing in Encina.
OLD MADRONO
But before the house was com
pleted it was found the professors
for whom it was intended would be
unable to shoulder the $100 monthly
rental, so Phi Delta Theta applied
for the house and got it with the
stipulation the unmarried profs be
allowed to live in certain sections
of the house.
GOOD FELLOWSHIP
Commentators on the first Stan
ford fraternities were impressed
with the good feeling not only be
tween rival Greeks, but between
the Row men and their non-frater
nity fellow students. Also notable
was the bent on learning shown by
the Farm fraternity men.
Prime in the eyes of early stu
dents. however, were the social out
lets provided by the fraternities.
"Mixed dancing," which had been

prohibited at the Encina and Roble
receptons, was not banned in the
fraternity houses.
'MIXED DANCING'
The social life was slow in start
ing the first year, but by the second
the tempo was increased and as
V>on as the fraternities had moved
into their houses dinners, recep
tions, and dances were chalked up
on the social calendar.
Roble and the two sororities made
a habit of being "at home" on Sat-
I urdays, and the Kappa Alpha The
tas even threw a Halloween party.

The enthusiastic old-timer nostal
gically remembers the monthly card
parties or dances given by Phi Del
ta Theta and their general recep
tion in May, "parties in the Phi
Gamma Delta house in the grove,
dances given by Sigma Alpha Ep
j silon, a Kappa Kappa Gamma party
j in Oakland at the home of the
Misses Chapman, and the Zeta Psi
hop at San Jose's Hotel Vendome,
with a special train!"
Sororities are now out, but today
at Stanford there arc 1,089 frater
nity members and pledges, 844 of
whom are living in the 24 men's
I Row houses.

'MIXED DANCING'

the tempo was increased and as

into their houses dinners, recep

The enthusiastic old-timer nostal

ta Theta and their general recep
tion in May, "parties in the Phi
Gamma Delta house in the grove,
dances given by Sigma Alpha Ep
j silon, a Kappa Kappa Gamma party
j in Oakland at the home of the
Misses Chapman, and the Zeta Psi
hop at San Jose's Hotel Vendome,
with a special train!"
Sororities are now out, but today
at Stanford there arc 1,089 frater
nity members and pledges, 844 of
whom are living in the 24 men's
I Row houses.
Time and fraternities march on.
Even before the University had its official opening, Greek
letter fraternities were laying plans for chapters on the Stanford
campus. The first year saw the establishment of eight fraternities
and two sororities, boasting a total membership of 140 persons.
President David Starr Jordan, a fraternity man himself, ap-

proved of their establishment and
later felt that "the chapter houses
added much to the appearance of
the campus and have constituted an
important factor in Stanford's .so
cial life." Yet he also realized the
problems connected with independ
ent living groups.
ZETA PSI FIRST CHARTERED
The first fraternity to be char
tered on the campus was Zeta Psi,
followed closely by Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta,
and Sigma Nu. Later in the year
chapters of the Southern fraterni
ties Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Al
pha Tau Omega were established
and wished "a long life and pros
perity in a region so climatically
akin to the sunny birthplace of their
mother chapters."
Before the first chapter houses,
the Greeks continued to live at En
cina, but did arrange for separate
tables in the dining room. Then in
the spring of 1892 the University
began erecting a large campus club

house known as Lauro Hall, for the
unmarried professors who were liv
ing in Encina.
OLD MADRONO
But before the house was com
pleted it was found the professors
for whom it was intended would be
unable to shoulder the $100 monthly
rental, so Phi Delta Theta applied
for the house and got it with the
stipulation the unmarried profs be
allowed to live in certain sections
of the house.
GOOD FELLOWSHIP
Commentators on the first Stan
ford fraternities were impressed
with the good feeling not only be
tween rival Greeks, but between
the Row men and their non-frater
nity fellow students. Also notable
was the bent on learning shown by
the Farm fraternity men.
