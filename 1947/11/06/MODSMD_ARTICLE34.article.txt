wlil return to the campus on Sun- |
day's noon Daylight.
SCRIMMAGE YESTEIDAY
Meanwhile the varsity worked |
out yesterday, holding their final ;
"heavy" scrimmage prior to Satur- >
day's game. Coach Schwartz has
been attempting to hold the injury
list, to as low a level as possible. At
present writing only Mickey Titus,
John Whipple, and Bob Rohrer are
in the "definitely out" category.
It's the borderline cases that have i
the coaching staff bothered—Wayne
Erickson, Marty Feldman, Ainslie
Bell. George Quist, et al. These boys
are ready to go but misfit be out
of there on the first good bump.
BEEES FOR SURE
That the Cards are walking into
■ a hornets' nest appears a certainty.

national title. Just where the line
j will he drawn no one knows.
C AL HOSTS HUSKIES
The Bay Area's football spotlight :
