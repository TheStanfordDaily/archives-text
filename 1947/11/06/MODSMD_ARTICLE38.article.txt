# Talented Head, Feet Needed For Grueling Game of Soccer Of soccer

### JOHN BREIR 
Better late than never as the j
saying goes. So, even though they
have only one home game remain- j
ing on the schedule, let's take this |
time to look over the Stanford soc- j
cer team and the game of soccer.
Headwork is important in every j
sport, but prehaps no sport makes |
greater use of the noggin, physically j
and mentally, as soccer.
In soccer, one of the truly inter- j
national games, a player can use
any part of his body except the
arms and hands to control the ball.
This is where the headwork comes I
in.
TAKE A I AST LOOK
But first let us consider the men j
and set up of soccer here at Stan- j
ford.
Coaching the 50 man' soccer squad
here on the Farm is 25-year-old
Dave Tappan, or "boy coach" Tap
pan as he is called by his men. Tap
pan is a graduate student in the
school of Business.
He learned the game in China
where he played with three of the
lads now playing for him. The four j
of them were attending a prep j
school there in 1938.
Eleven men comprise a soccer j
team. A typical formation for the j
attacking team is a 1-2-3-5 line up. j
The single man is the goalie. He j
tends a frame about 10 feet high and '
25 feet wide. He is the only man !
that can use his hands on the ball. !
and can do so only in the penalty [
zone (the large area that extends 18 !
yards out from the goal).
Randy Hudson, a slim six-footer, !
tends goal for the Indians, and is j
considered to be one of the best in j
the league.
McDonnell and gregg
In front of the goalie, the two full
backs play. Handling these chores
for the Indian shinkickers are Pat
McDonnell and Godfrey Gregg. The
fullbacks rarely leave their half of !

! the field, their job being to act as
i buffers in protection of the goal.
McDonnell's long, booming kicks arc
I one of the more thrilling parts of a
very exciting game.
The three halfbacks form a "V"
! with the center half the foremost
| man in respect to the enemy goal.
Starting halfbacks are David
| Blumberg, "Cosmic" Irani, and Ted
j Belknap. Blumberg is a transfer
! from the University of Chicago and
| Irani is an Indian student.
FORWARDS IMPORTANT
The five forwards form a "W"
I formation with the outsides and cen
! ter leading. These are the lads that
| operate for the most part in the op
j ponents' territory and do the scor
i ing. Perhaps the best man to play on
| the Stanford field this year is the
Indian center forward, Ricardo Tre
jos. Rick hails from Costa Rica and
is a past master at the art of "drib
bling" the ball down the field. In
soccer the forwards bring the ball
down field in short kicks or "drib
bles" when they have a clear field.
If not, they pass the ball either by
i kicking or tapping with the head or
! other parts of the body, but no
i hands allowed.
Soccer is a rugged game requiring
stamina, speed and presence of mind.
, Tripping, kicking, and jumping at a
j player are forbidden by rules, but
these rules do little to lessen the
i impact that results when two hard
i charging shinkickers collide. The
j nickname, shinkickers, is not an ex
i aggeration. Almost every player
I years a shin ' protector under his
j knee length stocking to provide some
; protection against the blows that
j come from friend and foe alike when
| a hard scrum takes place.
A soccer game is long, 88 minutes,
and under the old rules, there were
no substitutions. Now, however,
there is no limit as to subbing, but
the game has lost little of its rock-
I sock aspect.
