# Frosh Absorb Second Loss In Water Polo
## 
### 
Coach AI Weeden's Stanford
yearling water poloists dropped
their second game of the current
season yesterday, when Palo Alto
High School copped an 8 to 1 win.
PÂ«do Alto, coached by Nort
Thornton, former Stanford water
polo and varsity swimming coach,
kept a firm grip on the jinx which
they hoid over the frosh.
PALO ALTO WON FIRST
The Vikings have been the only
seven to whip the first - yearmen,
copping the first of the two-game
series between the two games a
short while ago.
Don Weeden scored the only tally
for the freshmen, while Dick Cul
lenward starred for the winners.

The Stanford varsity water polo
team went down in defeat last
night to the San Francisco Olym
pic Club by a 10 to 3 score. It was
the fourth loss against three wins
for the Farm lads.
The contest, which took place
in the Crystal Plunge Pool in San
Francisco, was under the control
of (he Flying-O team all the way.
Harry Botchers, star forward for
the Indian tankers, did not play
due to injuries sustained in last
week's U.S.C. contest and his loss
was felt by the losing Cards.
Jim Armstrong, Stanford for
ward, looked good in losing and
scored one of the three Indian
goals. Fritz Maurer and Walter
Lull each hit for one tally.
For the winning City team, it
was Peterson, Keller and an ex-
Stanfordite Enimett Cash in that
caused the trouble, each O.C'er
hitting for two counters.

Pierre Hathaway, himself a Palo
Alto graduate, captained the year
lings. Marsh Perlman turned in an
able performance at the goal posi
tion for the frosh.
CAL CUBS NEXT
Next game on the yearling sched
ule will be with the University of
California Cubs at Berkeley, one
week from Saturday.
The freshman game will be a pre
liminary for the big - game battle
between the Bear and Indian var
sities.
