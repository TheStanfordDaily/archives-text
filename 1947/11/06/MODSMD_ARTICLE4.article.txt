Eligibility for Farm fraternity men to live in their house while
on probation was explained last night by Pete August, Interfra
ternity Council president. Probation starts when a man goes
minus 11 or more.
If a man is living in the house and goes on probation, August
I said, he may live there one more*

quarter. If he brings his average
up to minus 10 or better duing
this second quarter, he may con
tinue to live in the house. If he docs
not go off probation, he must move
out.

Stanford's 21 fraternities will
host freshmen and non-fraternity |
men at open houses next week on
Tuesday from 7 to 9 p.m. and
Thursday from 7 to p.m.. re
minded Pete August, Interfratcr- \
nity Council president. The af- j
fairs are merely introductory, he j
said, and are not part of the fra- :
ternity rushing schedule. Men |
are urged to spend only 20 to .')0 |
minutes at each house.

In the case of a man living in
who goes on probation and moves
out of the house the next quarter,
he may not move back in the third
quarter if still minus 11, August j
said. Thus the "two quarters in" j
clause pertains only to two con- |
sccutive quarters.
Men on probation may not move
into the house if they are living
out at the time of going minus 11,
he concluded.
