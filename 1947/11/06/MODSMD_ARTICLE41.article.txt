# 22 Howl Games Staled; Rose Howl Closed Shop

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UP).—A
record number of 22 post-season'
football bowl games in which pro
moters already are bidding actively
for top-ranking teams, was lined
up today with the gala program to
begin early in December and wind
up with a grand flourish on New
Year's day.
A United Press survey indicated
that virtually all of the promoters
of bowl games which have previous
ly been staged are ready to do
business again and in addition at
least three new games will be held.
TOP FOUR GAMES
Naturally, the major teams whose
athletics boards permit post-season
play are interested in the top foifr
games and since the Rose Bowl at
Pasadena is a "closed shop" between
the Big Nine and the Pacific Coast
Conference, the scramble for the
other big ones should be terrific.
The Sugar Bowl has its eyes on
Georgia Tech, but the Orange Bowl
promoters, who have enlarged the
seating capacity at Miami to 60.000
and who have enjoyed most friendly
relations with the Southeastern Con
ference, also are seeking to land the
Ramblin Engineers. And though it
probably is wishful thinking, the
Sugar Bowl promoters still are try
ing actively io persuade Notre Dame
to corne to New Orleans, despite the
South Bend, Ind., school's avowed
opposition to post-season play.
Sam Corneswet, president of the
Sugar Bowl Association, is in South
Bend tHis week and he isn't up there
just to attend the Army-Notre Dame
game, either.
SMU IN COTTON BOWL
At Dallas, Texas, the Southwest
Conference champion, probably
Southern Methodist, is committed to
be host team in the Cotton Bowl
and efforts are being made to bring
in either a Southeastern Conference
team or a major eastern independent
as an opponent.
Significantly, the one team which
has been left completely out of all
bowl conversation, despite the fact
that it has a brilliant record, is un
beaten and untied Penn State. The
Staters have two negro players and
probably will not be asked to go to
any southern bowl game because of
ordinances which prohibit negroes
and whites from playing in public
athletic competition in most southern
cities.
The three new bowl promotions,
all being undertaken on a big time
scale, are the Delta Bowl at Mem
phis, Tenn., the Dixie Bowl at Bir
mingham. Ala., and the Great Lakes
Bowl at Cleveland.
GREAT LAKES GAME SET
Both opponents already have been
signed for the Great Lakes game

which will be on Dec. G. The Ken
tucky Wildcats will play the Villa
nova Wildcats oti the official ''kick
off 1 ' day of the bowl season.
Jn the Delta Bowl at Memphis,
Tenn., sponsored by the AMVETS
organization there, the University of
Mississippi signed to appear before
the start of the 1947 season, setting
some kind of a precedent. No op
ponent has been named but the pro
moters are after a "major team"
preferably from the East.
The Dixie Bowl at Birmingham,
Ala., would like to renew the lapsed
rivalry between the two big state
schools, University of Alabama and
Auburn, and Gov. James E. Folsom
has recommended that both teams
accept bids. The teams haven't met
for 40 years and it was considered
doubtful that they would renew re
lations now. The promoters, the
Birmingham Park and Recreation
Board and the local American Legion
post, have put out feelers to Georgia
Tech, Vanderbilt, Alabama, South
ern Methodist, Texas, Duke, Ken
tucky, and Wake Forest.
THE BOWL PICTURE
Gator Bowl. Jacksonville, Fla.—
J. B. Darby, chairman of the selec
tion committee said "we particularly
want a Southeastern Conference
team on the home side for our third
annual event and like Alabama,
Vanderbilt, or Mississippi State. On
the other side we now like Kansas,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma
or Virginia, but the picture may
change with future game results."
Sun Bowl, El Paso, Tex.—Border
Conference champion, probably
Hardin Simmons will be invited as
host team with strong little college,
preferably perfect record squad such
as Wesleyan of Connecticut, Middle
Tennessee State, or Valley City, N.D.,
Teachers a likely opponent.
Noire Dame Gets Nod
NEW YORK. Nov. 5 (UP)—Tear
ful Army may be hoping today for
a psychological wonder down at
South Bend. Ind.. Saturday but rain
or shine the pick of the week is
Notre Dame.
The Cadets, victim of an upset
by Columbia, have set a huge bear
trap for the Irish. Maybe they'll
spring it. All other signs point to
Notre Dame but in view of Army's
excellent line and its rushing rec
ord the 17''2-point spot handed the
Irish by the odds-makers appears
too high. Make it 20 to 7 on Johnny
Lujack's forward passing.
Around the nation, Georgia Tech,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Southern
Methodist, and Southern California
rate a winning nod.

Staters have two negro players and
probably will not be asked to go to
any southern bowl game because of
ordinances which prohibit negroes
and whites from playing in public
athletic competition in most southern
cities.
The three new bowl promotions,
all being undertaken on a big time
scale, are the Delta Bowl at Mem

Bowl at Cleveland.
GREAT LAKES GAME SET
Both opponents already have been
signed for the Great Lakes game

which will be on Dec. G. The Ken
tucky Wildcats will play the Villa
nova Wildcats oti the official ''kick
off 1 ' day of the bowl season.
Jn the Delta Bowl at Memphis,
Tenn., sponsored by the AMVETS
organization there, the University of
Mississippi signed to appear before
the start of the 1947 season, setting
some kind of a precedent. No op
ponent has been named but the pro
moters are after a "major team"
preferably from the East.
The Dixie Bowl at Birmingham,
Ala., would like to renew the lapsed
rivalry between the two big state
schools, University of Alabama and
Auburn, and Gov. James E. Folsom
has recommended that both teams
accept bids. The teams haven't met
for 40 years and it was considered
doubtful that they would renew re
lations now. The promoters, the
Birmingham Park and Recreation
Board and the local American Legion
post, have put out feelers to Georgia
Tech, Vanderbilt, Alabama, South
ern Methodist, Texas, Duke, Ken
tucky, and Wake Forest.

Noire Dame Gets Nod
NEW YORK. Nov. 5 (UP)—Tear
ful Army may be hoping today for
a psychological wonder down at
South Bend. Ind.. Saturday but rain
or shine the pick of the week is
Notre Dame.
The Cadets, victim of an upset
by Columbia, have set a huge bear
trap for the Irish. Maybe they'll
spring it. All other signs point to
Notre Dame but in view of Army's
excellent line and its rushing rec
ord the 17''2-point spot handed the
Irish by the odds-makers appears
too high. Make it 20 to 7 on Johnny
Lujack's forward passing.
Around the nation, Georgia Tech,

NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UP).—A
record number of 22 post-season'
football bowl games in which pro
moters already are bidding actively
for top-ranking teams, was lined
up today with the gala program to
begin early in December and wind
up with a grand flourish on New
Year's day.
A United Press survey indicated
that virtually all of the promoters
of bowl games which have previous
ly been staged are ready to do
business again and in addition at
least three new games will be held.
TOP FOUR GAMES
Naturally, the major teams whose
athletics boards permit post-season
play are interested in the top foifr
games and since the Rose Bowl at
Pasadena is a "closed shop" between
the Big Nine and the Pacific Coast
Conference, the scramble for the
other big ones should be terrific.
The Sugar Bowl has its eyes on
Georgia Tech, but the Orange Bowl
promoters, who have enlarged the
seating capacity at Miami to 60.000
and who have enjoyed most friendly
relations with the Southeastern Con
ference, also are seeking to land the
Ramblin Engineers. And though it
probably is wishful thinking, the
Sugar Bowl promoters still are try
ing actively io persuade Notre Dame
to corne to New Orleans, despite the
South Bend, Ind., school's avowed
opposition to post-season play.
Sam Corneswet, president of the
Sugar Bowl Association, is in South
Bend tHis week and he isn't up there
just to attend the Army-Notre Dame
game, either.
SMU IN COTTON BOWL
At Dallas, Texas, the Southwest
Conference champion, probably
Southern Methodist, is committed to
be host team in the Cotton Bowl
and efforts are being made to bring
in either a Southeastern Conference
team or a major eastern independent
as an opponent.
Significantly, the one team which
has been left completely out of all
bowl conversation, despite the fact
that it has a brilliant record, is un
beaten and untied Penn State. The

Sun Bowl, El Paso, Tex.—Border
Conference champion, probably
Hardin Simmons will be invited as
host team with strong little college,
preferably perfect record squad such

Teachers a likely opponent.
Noire Dame Gets Nod
NEW YORK. Nov. 5 (UP)—Tear
ful Army may be hoping today for
a psychological wonder down at
South Bend. Ind.. Saturday but rain
or shine the pick of the week is
Notre Dame.
The Cadets, victim of an upset
by Columbia, have set a huge bear
trap for the Irish. Maybe they'll
spring it. All other signs point to
Notre Dame but in view of Army's
excellent line and its rushing rec
ord the 17''2-point spot handed the
Irish by the odds-makers appears
too high. Make it 20 to 7 on Johnny
Lujack's forward passing.
Around the nation, Georgia Tech,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Southern
Methodist, and Southern California
rate a winning nod.
NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UP).—A
record number of 22 post-season'
football bowl games in which pro
moters already are bidding actively
for top-ranking teams, was lined
up today with the gala program to
begin early in December and wind
up with a grand flourish on New
Year's day.
A United Press survey indicated
that virtually all of the promoters
of bowl games which have previous
ly been staged are ready to do
business again and in addition at
least three new games will be held.
TOP FOUR GAMES
Naturally, the major teams whose
athletics boards permit post-season
play are interested in the top foifr
games and since the Rose Bowl at
Pasadena is a "closed shop" between
the Big Nine and the Pacific Coast
Conference, the scramble for the
other big ones should be terrific.
The Sugar Bowl has its eyes on
Georgia Tech, but the Orange Bowl
promoters, who have enlarged the
seating capacity at Miami to 60.000
and who have enjoyed most friendly
relations with the Southeastern Con
ference, also are seeking to land the
Ramblin Engineers. And though it
probably is wishful thinking, the
Sugar Bowl promoters still are try
ing actively io persuade Notre Dame
to corne to New Orleans, despite the
South Bend, Ind., school's avowed
opposition to post-season play.
Sam Corneswet, president of the
Sugar Bowl Association, is in South
Bend tHis week and he isn't up there
just to attend the Army-Notre Dame
game, either.
SMU IN COTTON BOWL
At Dallas, Texas, the Southwest
Conference champion, probably
Southern Methodist, is committed to
be host team in the Cotton Bowl
and efforts are being made to bring
in either a Southeastern Conference
team or a major eastern independent
as an opponent.
Significantly, the one team which
has been left completely out of all
bowl conversation, despite the fact
that it has a brilliant record, is un
beaten and untied Penn State. The
Staters have two negro players and
probably will not be asked to go to
any southern bowl game because of
ordinances which prohibit negroes
and whites from playing in public
athletic competition in most southern
cities.
The three new bowl promotions,
all being undertaken on a big time
scale, are the Delta Bowl at Mem
phis, Tenn., the Dixie Bowl at Bir
mingham. Ala., and the Great Lakes
Bowl at Cleveland.
GREAT LAKES GAME SET
Both opponents already have been
signed for the Great Lakes game

which will be on Dec. G. The Ken
tucky Wildcats will play the Villa
nova Wildcats oti the official ''kick
off 1 ' day of the bowl season.
Jn the Delta Bowl at Memphis,
Tenn., sponsored by the AMVETS
organization there, the University of
Mississippi signed to appear before
the start of the 1947 season, setting
some kind of a precedent. No op
ponent has been named but the pro
moters are after a "major team"
preferably from the East.
The Dixie Bowl at Birmingham,
Ala., would like to renew the lapsed
rivalry between the two big state
schools, University of Alabama and
Auburn, and Gov. James E. Folsom
has recommended that both teams
accept bids. The teams haven't met
for 40 years and it was considered
doubtful that they would renew re
lations now. The promoters, the
Birmingham Park and Recreation
Board and the local American Legion
post, have put out feelers to Georgia
Tech, Vanderbilt, Alabama, South
ern Methodist, Texas, Duke, Ken
tucky, and Wake Forest.
THE BOWL PICTURE

J. B. Darby, chairman of the selec

want a Southeastern Conference
team on the home side for our third
annual event and like Alabama,
Vanderbilt, or Mississippi State. On
the other side we now like Kansas,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma
or Virginia, but the picture may
change with future game results."
