Engineers from the telephone company are
on campus this week making arrangements
for the installation of new phones in Lagunita,
Union, Branner, Toyon, and Encina.
This is due largely to the efforts of Excom
member June Sword, who surveyed the cam
pus' telephone facilities and made a recom
mendation to the telephone company for 13
new phones in these five residences.
Last year when the telephone company first

decided to enforce its rules and install pay
phones at Stanford for all out-going calls there
was a shortage of equipment.
But it was a case of pay phones, or toll rates
as in a hotel, where each call would cost 7 to
10 cents. So pay phones were installed and
the situation was acute.
It should improve, however; this is the first
step in the right direction. Perhaps all that
was needed was a "motivating force." Con
gratulations, Excom.â€”M.H.
