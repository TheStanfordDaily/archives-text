# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
I would Â»like to call your attention to a glaring
mistake in the metropolitan press as of yesterday
regarding the Frisco election returns.
They forgot to list the 20 mental votes given to
"Honest BoId" Rankin of the Political Science de
partment by his Political Parties class.
Professor Rankin, a visiting fireman from Duke
was the sponsor of a political field trip to the city
on election day. Let me voice approval. I don't
think it's going to raise my grade, but let me voice
approval anyway.
Seems every time I read the campus opinion
section of The Daily someone is expounding the
idea that theoretical class room work is as useless
as telling a hair raising story to a bald-headed
man. Get out in the practical world to learn, they
say. Fine, I say. It will work in most classes except
Yogi Philosophy.
Twenty of us meandered around S.F. day before
yesterday trying not to look like college students,
and learned a great deal. Politicians are, as Bill
Rose puts it, about as "revealing as a Moscow press
release," but there are other ways to learn.
The place to find out that Robinson was going to
win the election was not in the newspaper or cam
paign offices. It was down in the basement at Market
and 11th, where the odds were 4 to 1 on Robinson,
and guys were shoving $50,000 bets across the
board to prove it.
I found out when I started playing marbles for

keeps that where large stakes were involved, the
guys running the show know what they are doing.
The student observers saw that Edmund Brown
had turned in his "victory statement" to the press as
early as 9 a.m. of election day, and that Robinson
had prepared food and drink for the celebrants
of his victory long before the polls closed. All of
which proved, to those who saw, that men like Ches
ter MacPhee, be they good or bad, didn't have as
much chance as a gallon of gas in a cellophane bag
in Hades.
A tour of the precincts took the groups from Nob
Hill down to the sea-level waterfront, at which point
it is rumored that a loyal Palo Altoan secured four
write in votes for Herb Hoover.
Meeting again in one body, dinner was enjoyed by
those who paid, and even more by those who didn't.
This gave the male members a chance to light up
their Democratic and Republican cigars respectively,
and to swipe the silverware under the cover of the
smoke that followed. (Any fraternity possessing sil
verware bearing the label "La Favorite Cafe" is in
violation of the Fundamental Standard.)
The party finally broke up when one of the boys
who is taking a Marriage and the Family course an
nounced that he had to get back to school do his
Lab. homework.
Most of us returned firmly believing that study
and pleasure can mix like good bourbon and water.
So vive la Rankin, vive la excusions, and a vote
for MacPhee is a vote for MacPhce.
