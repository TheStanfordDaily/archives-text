Within the past few months there have been def
inite signs that progress and improvement will be
forthcoming from the now dormant Middle East. It
appears, on the surface, that this section of the world
is finally awakening.
Under American inspiration and with American
help, Saudi Arabia proposes to embark on a pro
gram of modernization and development which could
eventually spark the regeneration of the whole
Middle East and place a new emphasis upon the
power of that region of the hemisphere.
According to Fuad Bey Hamza, the new Minister
of Development,his country intends to spend $270,-
000,000 in the next four years for the development
of new ports, new railroads and motor roads, new
power, electrification and irrigation projects, new
schools, agricultural experimentation stations, and
hospitals. The amount of money involved may not
seem large in this age of billions, but it is a great deal
in a country of five million impoverished inhabitants.
The Middle East has lain more or less dormant
for a thousand years, and in certain parts it has not
changed since the days of Abraham. Though changes
of climate and the poor condition of the soil are
partly responsible for this, the main reason for its
backward state has been the human factor.
This human factor of which I speak has expressed
itself in innumerable wars which massacred the pop

ulations and destroyed ancient irrigation systems
beyond the power of the present population to rebuild.
Also, a very important factor which cannot be ig
nored, is the way in which the many autocratic
regimes viewed modern progress with suspicion and
doubtfulness.
Now, however, a new element has entered the
Middle East. That new element is oil. On the one
hand, it has brought rival powers to this area; on the
other hand, it has introduced a new dynamism un
known there since the collapse of Arab power. This
big factor has definitely opened up the Middle East
to the innovations of the mechanical age.
There are unlimited opportunities ahead—in the
rebuilding of the irrigation systems of Mesopotamia,
in the construction of the proposed Jordan Valley
irrigation and power project, and even in desert
Arabia itself which at one time supported great
kingdoms.
King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, from what is told
about him, is not a democrat. He is known as a
ruler as absolute as any in the world. But in this
region where a patriarchal form of government is
still prevalent, and where the people themselves
have neither the means nor capacity of taking matters
in their own hands, it is from the rulers that progress
comes. I believe Ibn Saud is setting an example
for others to follow.

for others to follow.
Within the past few months there have been def
inite signs that progress and improvement will be
forthcoming from the now dormant Middle East. It
appears, on the surface, that this section of the world
is finally awakening.
Under American inspiration and with American
help, Saudi Arabia proposes to embark on a pro
gram of modernization and development which could
eventually spark the regeneration of the whole
Middle East and place a new emphasis upon the
power of that region of the hemisphere.
According to Fuad Bey Hamza, the new Minister
of Development,his country intends to spend $270,-
000,000 in the next four years for the development
of new ports, new railroads and motor roads, new
power, electrification and irrigation projects, new
schools, agricultural experimentation stations, and
hospitals. The amount of money involved may not
seem large in this age of billions, but it is a great deal
in a country of five million impoverished inhabitants.
The Middle East has lain more or less dormant
for a thousand years, and in certain parts it has not
changed since the days of Abraham. Though changes
of climate and the poor condition of the soil are
partly responsible for this, the main reason for its
backward state has been the human factor.
This human factor of which I speak has expressed
itself in innumerable wars which massacred the pop

ulations and destroyed ancient irrigation systems
beyond the power of the present population to rebuild.
Also, a very important factor which cannot be ig
nored, is the way in which the many autocratic
regimes viewed modern progress with suspicion and
doubtfulness.
Now, however, a new element has entered the
Middle East. That new element is oil. On the one
hand, it has brought rival powers to this area; on the
other hand, it has introduced a new dynamism un
known there since the collapse of Arab power. This
big factor has definitely opened up the Middle East
to the innovations of the mechanical age.
There are unlimited opportunities ahead—in the
rebuilding of the irrigation systems of Mesopotamia,
in the construction of the proposed Jordan Valley
irrigation and power project, and even in desert
Arabia itself which at one time supported great
kingdoms.
King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, from what is told
about him, is not a democrat. He is known as a
ruler as absolute as any in the world. But in this
region where a patriarchal form of government is
still prevalent, and where the people themselves
have neither the means nor capacity of taking matters
in their own hands, it is from the rulers that progress
comes. I believe Ibn Saud is setting an example
for others to follow.
