To the Editor:
Amongst those who write letters to the editor
there seems to be an unfortunate tendency towards
a precipitous rushing of their products into print
with no deliberation about what is to be said. This
wretched habit is particularly well exemplified by the
recent hysterical attacks upon the letter of Ralph
Connell.
It is my intention that this letter be one of support
of Ralph Connell; one of an expression of disgust
with Evan S. Connell (hereinafter to be known as
"Exhaust-pipe Connell"), Joel Franklin, Robert G.
King, and anyone else who feels compelled to cham
pion the cause of a Sunday night strip-tease; and
also one of defense rf culture and restraint.
Ralph Connell was viciously attacked because he
expressed a dislike for impurity. Those who attacked
him professed (in the words of one tacit supporter)
to be broadminded. modern-thinking, tolerant adults;
those who attacked him rejoiced when a little of the
seamy side of life managed to creep in; those who
attacked him found these silly pictures he named to
be moving human drama, capable of inspiring
thoughts (yeh); and Mr. Exhaust-pipe Connell, whose
coy letters we all have seen before, was not content
with the emotionally unstable, snobbish, and con
temptuous American undergraduate. To you who
read this: how well adjusted does Exhaust-pipe
Connell seem to you? How much does he respect the
opinions and criticisms of others? Let me tell you,
please Exhaust-pipe Connell is an intellectual snob

without intellect, one of the intelligentsia without
intelligence, a scoffer without a pot to scoff in.
Oh he's not alone. Those other esthetes arc almost
as reprehensible. One cannot be as irritated with
them, however, for they cannot have seen as much
of Life as Evan S., nor is it likely that they have
been exposed to as much academic training as he.
Let them examine their own consciences, therefore,
and discover for themselves that what is fine and
beautiful is never filthy. Perhaps they will say to
me that no good is all good, that no evil is all evil,
and that the merits of a movie that is implicitly
immoral outweigh the implicit immorality involved—l
am not shrewd enough to refute this sort of argument
satisfactorily. If the reason for the existence of
movies generally is not apparent to you people, then
nothing anyone could say would be effective. Mov
ies are intended to make money, children; they arc
not primarily intended to provide you with whole
some entertainment. To make money, movies must
appeal to more than a few. To appeal to all, they
make a slight-of-hand attempt to vicariously satisfy
a hunger for which they themselves are in a large
measure responsible. No one is saying that sex is
dirty, kids. But the deliberate manner in which this
aspect of our lives is contorted by the producers of
movies to satisfy this degrading prurience is pos
itively criminal and unclean. Young people, don't let
yourselves be taken in by facile arguments. Look
around you. There is too much to do. there is too
much to enjoy without resorting to pornography.

make a slight-of-hand attempt to vicariously satisfy
a hunger for which they themselves are in a large
measure responsible. No one is saying that sex is
dirty, kids. But the deliberate manner in which this
aspect of our lives is contorted by the producers of
movies to satisfy this degrading prurience is pos
itively criminal and unclean. Young people, don't let
yourselves be taken in by facile arguments. Look
around you. There is too much to do. there is too
much to enjoy without resorting to pornography.

To the Editor:
Amongst those who write letters to the editor
there seems to be an unfortunate tendency towards
a precipitous rushing of their products into print
with no deliberation about what is to be said. This
wretched habit is particularly well exemplified by the
recent hysterical attacks upon the letter of Ralph
Connell.
It is my intention that this letter be one of support
of Ralph Connell; one of an expression of disgust
with Evan S. Connell (hereinafter to be known as
"Exhaust-pipe Connell"), Joel Franklin, Robert G.
King, and anyone else who feels compelled to cham
pion the cause of a Sunday night strip-tease; and
also one of defense rf culture and restraint.
Ralph Connell was viciously attacked because he
expressed a dislike for impurity. Those who attacked
him professed (in the words of one tacit supporter)
to be broadminded. modern-thinking, tolerant adults;
those who attacked him rejoiced when a little of the
seamy side of life managed to creep in; those who
attacked him found these silly pictures he named to
be moving human drama, capable of inspiring
thoughts (yeh); and Mr. Exhaust-pipe Connell, whose
coy letters we all have seen before, was not content
with the emotionally unstable, snobbish, and con
temptuous American undergraduate. To you who
read this: how well adjusted does Exhaust-pipe
Connell seem to you? How much does he respect the
opinions and criticisms of others? Let me tell you,
please Exhaust-pipe Connell is an intellectual snob

without intellect, one of the intelligentsia without
intelligence, a scoffer without a pot to scoff in.
Oh he's not alone. Those other esthetes arc almost
as reprehensible. One cannot be as irritated with
them, however, for they cannot have seen as much
of Life as Evan S., nor is it likely that they have
been exposed to as much academic training as he.
Let them examine their own consciences, therefore,
and discover for themselves that what is fine and
beautiful is never filthy. Perhaps they will say to
me that no good is all good, that no evil is all evil,
and that the merits of a movie that is implicitly
immoral outweigh the implicit immorality involved—l
am not shrewd enough to refute this sort of argument
satisfactorily. If the reason for the existence of
movies generally is not apparent to you people, then
nothing anyone could say would be effective. Mov
ies are intended to make money, children; they arc
not primarily intended to provide you with whole
some entertainment. To make money, movies must
appeal to more than a few. To appeal to all, they
make a slight-of-hand attempt to vicariously satisfy
a hunger for which they themselves are in a large
measure responsible. No one is saying that sex is
dirty, kids. But the deliberate manner in which this
aspect of our lives is contorted by the producers of

itively criminal and unclean. Young people, don't let
