# First Novel by UC Grad Illustrates New Realism

### MAC MYERS 
Glorious In Another Day by Arthur Foff.
A recent graduate of the University of California, Mr. Arthur
Foff has written one of the outstanding novels of the last few
years. It is Mr. Foff's first novel and demonstrates unmistakably
his superior craftsmanship and artistry.
The principal characters of this book are all of great stature
and the situation is of universal ,

importance.
The central figure is the father,
Bull Housinan, an ex-heavyweight
prizefighter who could have been
champion of the world. The title
of the book is a key to his character.
His son, Tom, is 19 and resembles
his father in many ways, and is
almost as large physically and has
essentially the same ideas.
Conflict, however, develops be
tween these two as the immediate
result of an illegal dog-fight and
Tom's love affair with a beautiful
and sophisticated girl who is sepa
rated from her husband. The actual
cause of the conflict lies in Tom's
growing maturity and in the un
willingness of the father to recog
nize the necessity for a change in
their relationship. This situation has
universal applicability.
"Glorious in Another Day" as a
dramatic novel surpasses Stein
beck's "Of Mice and Men" because
of the greater significance of Mr.
Foff's characters. His parallel, that
of the dog fight, is an integral part
of the story and springs naturally
from his characters rather than be
ing, as in Mr. Steinbeck's book, an
event which takes place outside
their lives.
The novel is written in a simple
and beautiful style, which is per
fectly suited to its emotional and
factual content. The emotional
quality of Mr. Foff's description
and dialogue are genuine and pow
erful. It is factually accurate to the
neighborhood in which the story
takes place, but in a larger sense it

is true to every locale in every
lime.
The characters, who are continu
ously and powerfully developed,
are well drawn and none of them
may be categorized as either "good"
or "evil." They have a depth which
is so frequently lacking in recent
novels.
It is more than just an outstand
ing first novel; it is unquestionably
a work of art.

rated from her husband. The actual
cause of the conflict lies in Tom's
growing maturity and in the un
willingness of the father to recog
nize the necessity for a change in
their relationship. This situation has
universal applicability.
"Glorious in Another Day" as a
dramatic novel surpasses Stein
beck's "Of Mice and Men" because
of the greater significance of Mr.
Foff's characters. His parallel, that
of the dog fight, is an integral part
of the story and springs naturally
from his characters rather than be
ing, as in Mr. Steinbeck's book, an
event which takes place outside
their lives.
The novel is written in a simple
and beautiful style, which is per
fectly suited to its emotional and
factual content. The emotional
quality of Mr. Foff's description
and dialogue are genuine and pow
erful. It is factually accurate to the
neighborhood in which the story
takes place, but in a larger sense it

is true to every locale in every
lime.
The characters, who are continu
ously and powerfully developed,
are well drawn and none of them
may be categorized as either "good"
or "evil." They have a depth which
is so frequently lacking in recent
novels.
It is more than just an outstand
ing first novel; it is unquestionably
a work of art.
