# Dr. Greulich Returns From Study Of Atom-Bombed Japanese Children
## 
### 
Youthful victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs
are being made the subject of a long-range study to determine
the effect of atomic radiation on human growth, development,
and reproduction, it was disclosed yesterday by Dr. William
Walter Greulich, professor of anatomy.
Dr. Greulich has returned to the campus after spending five

weeks taking measurements and
extensive X-rays of more than 1,000
Japanese children, said that it is
planned to continue the joint
American - Japanese study over a
period of at least 10 years.
He was assisted by his wife, an
experienced research worker, in
the survey work done during the
late summer. This initial phase of
the survey was aimed at getting in
formation on methods to be used in
the large - scale study which will
begin next year, when the Greu
lichs and other research workers
return to Japan.
Besides weighing anql measuring
the children, the Greulichs took X
rays of seven different regions of
the bodies of the 250 children they
examined, in each of four cities.
The X-rays, now en route to Stan
ford by ship, will be examined to
determine the general develop
mental status of each child, and to
look for evidence of malnutrition.
Dr. Greulich said that there was
evidence on every hand —in both
Nagasaki and Hiroshima —in the
multitude of young babies and
pregnant women, that the atomic
blasts had no immediate detrimen
tal effects on human fertility.
