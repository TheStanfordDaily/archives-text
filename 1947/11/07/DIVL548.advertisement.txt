STANFORD
•
Longbarn volume is greater now
than it was in 1945 or 1946. We will
reach a gross of over a quarter of a
million dollars in 1947.
Longbarn profits are LESS than they
were in 1945 or 1946.
Because of food costs, Longbarn
dinner prices are high, and, for the
most part, out of the reach of Stanford
students (although every night finds
many of you eating here).
Therefore, as of this week, we are
inaugurating a policy which will bring
our dinners within a much wider
range.
Show the waitress your student
body card and she will deduct
20%
from your dinner check. This
applies for:
Monday - Tuesday - Wednesday -
Thursday - Friday.
Remember also that accepted con
tributions to The Space receive FREE
dinners, as hundreds of you have al
ready learned.
Also, a free you-know-what will be
given to any student or faculty mem
ber who brings in a new label for our
"sticker ceiling," or a menu for our
new menu wall.
Stanford Banquets get special re
ductions and, although our present
room seats only 65, our new banquet
room will seat up to 250.
Remember that the bell rings once
and sometimes twice a night every
night and 8 if you don't know what
that means, you're a square for sure.
Longbarn is starting its sth success
ful year and we sincerely hope our new
kitchen, new banquet room, and new
walled-in patio, will add more weight
to our slogan.

Has to Offer
