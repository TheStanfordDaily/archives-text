# Axe Is Returned To Cellar Stand
## 
### 
The Axe is to be officially re
turned by by Rally Com to tbe
Cellar this morning, where it will
be on display in a brand new case
situated near the cigar counter.
The new case, which measures
B8 x 24 inches, was specially con
stucted by Weber of Los Angeles
for about $700. Six men carried the
9. r >o-pound structure into the Cellar
Thursday noon, at which time the
Axe was to be installed. The pro
cedure was postponed due to a de
lay in the completion of the bronze
plaque, which is to be placed on
the front of the case, according to
W. G. Gunther. manager of the Cel
lar and Union Stores. The late ar
rival of the case itself was the result
of labor troubles in the Los An
geles plant.
Unbreakable, double plate glass
covers the display section of the
case, which is lighted by a fluores
cent bulb. Previously the Axe was
located in a smaller wooden box
under the mirror opposite the same
Cellar cigar counter. It has not
been on public exhibition since it
was stolen (by Cal students) in
194(5, beinc kent instead under lock
and key by Stanford police.
