## 
### 
Approximately $900 damage was
caused as a result of the "Pajama
rino Rally" which was held Wed
nesday night, according to Jim
Welch, president of Men's Council.
In Roble alone, ihere was $827
damage, not including personal
property. This figure includes bro
ken windows, doors torn down,
screens taken off and broken, dam
age to plants and shrubbery, and
theft of store supplies. The amount
of personal property damage is yet j
to be determined. Girls were asked j
to inform the residence director of !
losses.
Despite much fighting between
freshmen and upper classmen, dam- j
age to the Pavilion during the send
off rally was limited to $50. Most of
this was caused by a smoke bomb
thrown by a 14 - year - old boy,
which burned about four square
feet of the hardwood floor.
WINDOWS BROKEN
Other damage included n broken i

window in the home of Professor
Juan Pacl, $22, and smashed win
dows and fruit stains on the Row.
Three students were injured in
the mass fighting, one of whom had
to have three stitches taken on his
lip.
Freshmen at Roble and Encina
and students on the campus as a
whole were divided in their opin
ions as to whether the Pajamaino
should be continued as a tradition.
PETITION C IRCULATED
A petition circulated at Encina
last night called for the continuation
of the Pajamarino, stating that
should this 43 - year - old tradition
be discontinued now the Class of
'51 would receive a black mark be
cause of the actions of the whole
campus.
Welch said that Men's Council
will decide next week who should
pay for the damage. He added that
the council may hold a joint session
witli Women's Council as women
were also involved.
