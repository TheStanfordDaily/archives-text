### 
LONDON, Nov. 6 (UP).—Russian Foreign Minister Viacheslav
M. Molotov asserted tonight, to the ringing cheers of a Moscow
audience, that the secret of the atomic bomb has "long ceased
to exist."
He denounced the United States and Great Britain for-not out
lawing the bomb, "which as is known is not a means of defense
but a weapon of aggression."
"It is interesting that in expansionist circles of the United

States of America a new, peculiar
sort of illusion is widespread—while
having no faith in their internal
strength, faith is placed in the secrct
of the atom bomb, although this
secret has long ceased to exist."
He accused the United States of
grabbing offensive military bases
near Russia's borders as part of a
policy in which U.S. leaders, "with
such blindness, are plunging after
world domination."
" ... It is clear that creation of
military bases in various parts of
the world is not designed for de
fense purposes but as preparation
for aggression."
Defying western "imperialists,"
"expansion ists," "warmongers,"
"greedy profiteers" and "top capital
ist multi-millionaires," Molotov said
that Russia would "defend to the
end the interests of universal peace."
