(Editorial)

Wednesday night the Pajamarino developed
into a brawl. A preliminary estimate of the
damage was 51,000. This doesn't include dam
age to, or loss of, personal property.
No one has a good word for the Wednes
day night fracas. Reactions vary from pure
disgust to turbulent protestations.
The blame for Wednesday night's unfor
tunate episode does not fall on one group
alone. Certainly not upon the shoulders of the
Class of '51 which was in many respects the
unhappy victim of a long stream of incidents
leading to the battle at the pavilion and the
storming of Roble.
A list of the reasons behind the fight would
include the mention of: an over-zealous Class
of '50 trying to "make up" for last year's to
mato fight; a group of men from the Row who
started the hostilities by throwing "things" at
the pajama-clad freshmen as they were march
ing to the pavilion; over-publication of the
more undesirable portions of previous pa
jamarinos; and lack of foresight on the part of
those who planned the rally.
But the reasons for Wednesday's fighting
and vandalism are not important.
The important thing is what is going to be

done now that the campus is unanimous in its
opinion that Stanford can not afford to have
another Pajamarino like Wednesday night's.
Should Pajamarinos be eliminated entirely?
Should they be discontinued for several years?
Should another attempt at a peaceful Pa
jamarino be made?
Student Body President Tom Martzloff has
recommended to Excom that the Pajamarino
be cancelled for four years.
Excom appears willing to back Martzloff
unless a better solution is forthcoming.
One possible solution has been suggestedâ€”
a group could undertake to supervise next
year's Pajamarino.
The best group would be the Class of '51
itself.
If the Pajamarino tradition is to remain at
Stanford some group must take the responsi
bility.
Unless a spontaneous movement arises in
the next few days to support a "true-rally"
type of Pajamarino next year, Excom will do
well to follow the lead of the ASSU president.
There is no place at Stanford for any demon
stration such as that which marked the Wed
nesday night Pajamarino.
