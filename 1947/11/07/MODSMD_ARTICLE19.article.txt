As the new uniforms have not
arrived, the hand members arc
requested to wear their old uni
forms for the University of South
ern California football game. All
band members must be at the S.P.
station tonight at 7:15 if they arc
planning to go south for the game.
The Student Athletic Council

here for the Oregon-Stanford

Stanford Stadium a week from to
morrow.
If any difliculties concerning the
trip to S.C. arise, band members
should telephone Bill Warren at
