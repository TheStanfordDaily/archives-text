# Marchie's Winless Tribe Entrains for Los Angeles Girded for Battle with Rugged Trojan Favorites
## 
### JACK CASHEL 
The up-and-down Stanford foot
ball varsity, fresh off the apex of
its best showing of the season last
week against Oregon State, nudges
into just about the biggest and best
grid eleven on the Pacific slope
when they move into the Los Ange
les Memorial Coliseum tomorrow
against the University of Southern
California.
On the basis of a string of impres
sive victories since their second
game tie with Rice, Coach Jeff
Cravath's Trojans are heavy favor
ites to win the '47 conference crown
and Rose Bowl nomination.
On successive Saturdays, South
ern Cal has rolled over Ohio State
32 to 0, Oregon Slate 48 to 6, Cali
fornia 39 to 14, and Washington 19
to 0.
Although Stanford Coach Marchie

Schwartz concedes his Indians a
chance to upset the high - flying
southerners, dope sheets rate the
Trojans 33 - point favorites, and
sportswriters in San Francisco are
talking of the possibility of the
Indians holding SC below 39 points.
But the Card line and backfield
will be at just about the best de
fensive and offensive strength they
have hit all year.
Right halfback George Quist is
once more at playing peak, and off
his showings in the Washington and
Oregon State games has proven he's
one of the best in the league.
And game captain Bob Anderson
has begun to show flashes of his
1946 form.
Don Zappettini, one of the sur
prises in the Beaver game, once
again gels the starting nod at full
back. And behind him Marty An
derson and Jim Nafziger arc able
and well.
Nafziger gave evidence during
scrimmages last week that his legs,
which have bothered him since the
Michigan game, arc once again able
to carry offensive burdens.
Guard Bob Rohrer, halfbacks

Mickey Titus and Wayne Erickson,
and end Gene Martin are the only
Indians still on the casualty list.
Erickson, nursing an injui-ed shoul
der, and Martin, with bursitis of
the knee, will make the trip and
are expected to see action.
Rchrer, who reinsured his shoul
der during the past week, will not
go south with the traveling squad.
Titus will move with the team,
but will not play against the Tro
jans.
It may be that the Star ford
couching staff's plans call tor a
wide-open offensive battle. In this
they are well prepared, for the
traveling roster included 17 hack
field men.
The 38-man traveling squad:
Gene Martin, Bob Ghilotti, Boh
Childs, Whit Budjje, Harry Davison,
Jack McKittrick, Joe Scott, Ted Lil

go south with the traveling squad.
Titus will move with the team,
but will not play against the Tro
jans.
It may be that the Star ford
couching staff's plans call tor a
wide-open offensive battle. In this
they are well prepared, for the
traveling roster included 17 hack
field men.
The 38-man traveling squad:
Gene Martin, Bob Ghilotti, Boh
Childs, Whit Budjje, Harry Davison,
Jack McKittrick, Joe Scott, Ted Lil

John Rosenkrans, Don Fix.

The up-and-down Stanford foot
ball varsity, fresh off the apex of
its best showing of the season last
week against Oregon State, nudges
into just about the biggest and best
grid eleven on the Pacific slope
when they move into the Los Ange
les Memorial Coliseum tomorrow
against the University of Southern
California.
On the basis of a string of impres
sive victories since their second
game tie with Rice, Coach Jeff
Cravath's Trojans are heavy favor
ites to win the '47 conference crown
and Rose Bowl nomination.
On successive Saturdays, South
ern Cal has rolled over Ohio State
32 to 0, Oregon Slate 48 to 6, Cali
fornia 39 to 14, and Washington 19
to 0.
Although Stanford Coach Marchie

Schwartz concedes his Indians a
chance to upset the high - flying
southerners, dope sheets rate the
Trojans 33 - point favorites, and
sportswriters in San Francisco are
talking of the possibility of the
Indians holding SC below 39 points.
But the Card line and backfield
will be at just about the best de
fensive and offensive strength they
have hit all year.
Right halfback George Quist is
once more at playing peak, and off
his showings in the Washington and
Oregon State games has proven he's
one of the best in the league.
And game captain Bob Anderson
has begun to show flashes of his
1946 form.
Don Zappettini, one of the sur
prises in the Beaver game, once
again gels the starting nod at full
back. And behind him Marty An
derson and Jim Nafziger arc able
and well.
Nafziger gave evidence during
scrimmages last week that his legs,
which have bothered him since the
Michigan game, arc once again able
to carry offensive burdens.
Guard Bob Rohrer, halfbacks

Mickey Titus and Wayne Erickson,
and end Gene Martin are the only
Indians still on the casualty list.
Erickson, nursing an injui-ed shoul
der, and Martin, with bursitis of
the knee, will make the trip and
are expected to see action.
