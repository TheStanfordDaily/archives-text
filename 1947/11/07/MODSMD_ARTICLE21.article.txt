# Toyon Features Fund Drive Talks
## 
### 
Roberto Sangiori of the Romanic
languages department and Profes
sor Heinrich Blauth of the German
department will discuss current
conditions in Italy and Germany
the opening meeting of the Stanford
Relief Fund Drive to be held in
Toyon on Monday night at 7 p.m.
Mr. Sangiori, who last summer
made an extensive study of the Ital
ian situation and the University of
Naples, will center his talk on Na
ples. The University of Naples will
receive 30 percent of the proceeds
from the drive.
The Academy-award winning doc
umentary film "Seeds of Destiny"
will be shown immediately following
the speakers.
Molly Shaw, co-chairman of the
Stanford Relief Fund Drive, will
speak briefly on the aims and meth
ods of the drive. Afterwards Miss
Shaw will invite the audience to
participate in a general question
period.
Last year Toyon, the first living
group to do any organized relief
work, made an excellent showing,
said Ralph Miller, chairman of the
Drive in Toyon. Again this year an
equally good showing is expected of
the upper-class men's dorm when it
embarks on an intensive week-long
drive, he stated.
