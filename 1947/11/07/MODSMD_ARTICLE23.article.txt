# Annual Branner Contest Yields New Hall Song
## 
### 
Tuesday night at 10:30 Branner's lobby seemed quite unusual.
Mingling with pajama clad Brannerites were a mob of disreput
able looking hillbillies, a band of girls bundled up in raincoats,
and one stray individual in diapers.
The occasion was Branner's annual song contest and sing.

Each corridor concocts a song and
presents it at the sing. Judges choose
<,ne song to be learned and sung by
Branner girls throughout the year.
Corridor 2-south\Vest's entry was
chosen by judges. Peggy Milnor and
Betty Calender, both former Bran-
Dt rites, as the song most suitable to
be learned. The judges also cited
corridors 2-center and 1-southwest
for the most original songs and per
formances.
WINNING SONG
This is the song you will hear
Branner girls,* singing to the tune of
''MacNamara's Band":
Oh, the typists are clacking,
The brains are racking
To cool each ghastly quiz;
The Stanford curve has many a
swerve,
But that's the way it is!
Though we moan and groan
And sigh and cry,
It's not that bad at all—
A credit to dear old SU
Is our own Branner Hall.
Who cares if we're crammed in,
We're jellied and jamryed in,
(We're three girls in a room)
For everyone at Branner seems
To have a love in bloom.
Oh, the showers are singing,
The buzzers are ringing
For those with the telephone
calls,
Aritl the roughs who are await
ing them
In our own Branner Halls.

Yes, we're frosh and sophs and
juniors,
And we have two seniors, too.
Just one conglomeration of
Homogenized Branner Stew.
Our welcome is known, our
friendliness shown
By every open door.
We know we're lucky that we
drew 294!
