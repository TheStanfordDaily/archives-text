I'aula Smith, sophomore collection

Ventura take over the booths on
Tuesday, followed by the Branner

Joan Donovan, Row group head,
has issued a challenge to the other

Row and Union women wishing
to serve should contact Joan Dono

up with Suze Ray or Carolyn
Johnson, and Branner women get in
touch with Ann Keifer.
