# PIGEON IN PSYCH CLASSES
## 
### 
Instead of carrying lecture, notes
lo class Tuesday, Psychology 51
section leaders toted "Duchess," an
educated pigeon.
Duchess was used, as a living ex
ample of a conditioned response.
Knowing she will get fed when she
pecks at a pencil extended through
her cage bars, Duchess obediently
performs her duly. Pecking at black
spots on a piece of paper is another
of Duchess' specialties. This job is
also undertaken willingly because
Duchess is again assured of getting
her victuals if her task is success
ful.
