# Farm Mothers' Club Presents 'Calico Circus' This Afternoon
## 
### 
The old saying that "even his own
mother wouldn't recognize him"
will be neatly reversed this after
noon when the Stanford Mothers'
Club presents its "Calico Circus" at
the Women's Gym from 2 to 5:30.
While their offspring may try vain
ly to identify them, the mothers
will masquerade as bearded ladies,
living skeletons, wild men of Bor
neo, and clowns, according to Mrs.
Williagi Hawley Davis, president.
Even the faculty is not exempt
from the influence of the Big Top,
for a well-known Stanford profes
sor will attend costumed as the
"hillbilly papa" of the hayseed fam
ily, including his wife and the little
hillbillies.
MAGIC ENTERTAINMENT
Entertainment will be provided
by Robert Herton, a Stanford jun
ior, and his wife, who are billed
professionally as "Bob and Margie,
the Magic Makers." This clever
couple have baffled audiences from
the campus to Chicago with their
dexterity in magical feats.
Between the performances at 2:15
and 3:15, guests may partake of the
free dessert and coffee to be served
to ticket holders, purchase pink
lemonade, popcorn, and home
baked delicacies at the food booths,

while visiting Stanford this summer,
and later made them into blocks.

nurseries and members of the
Mothers' Club.
