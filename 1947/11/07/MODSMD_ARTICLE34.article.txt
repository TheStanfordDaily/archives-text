# Amorous Amber Falls Flat Without Bedroom Background
## 
### BUD KEENAN 
Nobody had any right to expect
anything much from the screen
version of "Forever Amber," al
though the production of the film
was accompanied by considerable
fanfare. In her racy account of the
life and times of a Restoration
courtesan. Kathleen Winsor ex
ploited almost every last ounce of
sex that she could read into the
pages of English history. By the
time code - bound Hollywood got
around to Amber, the famous hussy
had pretty well run her course.
Actually, the movie is no worse
and no better than the book, if you
leave out the romantic episodes, but
then you haven't got much left. The
content of "Forever Amber" was
pure trash when it appeared as a
book, and it is now equally trashy
on the screen.
EMPHASIS ON VISUAL' EFFECT
What remained in the script after
the necessary pruning has been
dressed up in some of the splashiest
Technicolor ever to hit the eye. The
emphasis is on visual effect, lest the
wandering mind begin to probe the
wobbly structure of this film. Spec
tacle follows spectacle in this loud
and florid picture, and when the
action slows, the music swells to

drown any surviving doubts.
Even though Amber runs through
a string of lovers, acquires a title,
and winds up in the arms of Charles
11, you can't help feeling the picture
is a let-down. Too much was cut
from the novel and not replaced in
the movie, leaving frequent gaps in
the action.
POLISHED HOKUM
While Miss Winsor was able to
cover up the hokum in her best
seller through flashes of good writ
ing and the eagerness of a hungry
war-time audience, Hollywood has
been far less successful in bringing
"Amber" to the screen. The hokum
in the film version has been pol
ished, decorated, and mounted to
the tune of $6,000,000, but it is still
hokum, and badly disguised at that.
Linda Darnell plays Amber with
a certain amount of verve, but she
J looks as if she's expecting a mo-
J mentary visit from the Legion of
| Decency. Cornel Wilde is pretty
wooden as Bruce, and gives the
i impression that he was trying to
get out of hi.4 contract all along.
George Sanders, as Charles 11. turns
in the picture's best performance,
and almost, but not quite, compen
sates for the general tedium of the
picture.

J mentary visit from the Legion of
| Decency. Cornel Wilde is pretty
wooden as Bruce, and gives the
i impression that he was trying to
get out of hi.4 contract all along.
George Sanders, as Charles 11. turns
in the picture's best performance,
and almost, but not quite, compen
sates for the general tedium of the
picture.
Nobody had any right to expect
anything much from the screen
version of "Forever Amber," al
though the production of the film
was accompanied by considerable
fanfare. In her racy account of the
life and times of a Restoration
courtesan. Kathleen Winsor ex
ploited almost every last ounce of
sex that she could read into the
pages of English history. By the
time code - bound Hollywood got
around to Amber, the famous hussy
had pretty well run her course.
Actually, the movie is no worse
and no better than the book, if you
leave out the romantic episodes, but
then you haven't got much left. The
content of "Forever Amber" was
pure trash when it appeared as a
book, and it is now equally trashy
on the screen.
EMPHASIS ON VISUAL' EFFECT
What remained in the script after
the necessary pruning has been
dressed up in some of the splashiest
Technicolor ever to hit the eye. The
emphasis is on visual effect, lest the
wandering mind begin to probe the
wobbly structure of this film. Spec
tacle follows spectacle in this loud
and florid picture, and when the
action slows, the music swells to

drown any surviving doubts.
Even though Amber runs through
a string of lovers, acquires a title,
and winds up in the arms of Charles
11, you can't help feeling the picture
is a let-down. Too much was cut
from the novel and not replaced in
the movie, leaving frequent gaps in
the action.
POLISHED HOKUM
While Miss Winsor was able to
cover up the hokum in her best
seller through flashes of good writ
ing and the eagerness of a hungry
war-time audience, Hollywood has
been far less successful in bringing
"Amber" to the screen. The hokum
in the film version has been pol
ished, decorated, and mounted to
the tune of $6,000,000, but it is still
hokum, and badly disguised at that.
Linda Darnell plays Amber with
a certain amount of verve, but she
J looks as if she's expecting a mo-
J mentary visit from the Legion of
| Decency. Cornel Wilde is pretty
