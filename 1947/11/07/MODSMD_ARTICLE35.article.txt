# Excom Review

### 
(Editor's Note: The following
story is a summary of the discus
sion held at Wednesday night's
Excom meeting. This summary
will he run weekly in order to
give a background of the deci
sions reached hy Excom.)
ASSU President Tom Martzloff
suggested to Excom Wednesday
night that the committee recom
mend to futue Excoms that the Pa
jamarino be canceled for the next
four years. He pointed out that the
constitution prohibits "Encina raids,
class rushes, mud-fights or similar
encounters," and that Wednesday
night's Pajamarino could be includ
ed in the latter category.
The present freshman class will
probably seek retaliation during
next year's Pajamarino, Martzloff
added. In order to prevent this re
taliation, he suggested that the
event be canceled for four years.
ACTION POSTPONED
Several of the members thought
this action too drastic, and suggest
ed that the parade down the Row
before the Pajamarino be elimi
nated, that an organization such as
the Block "S" Society assist in po
licing the event, or that it be elimi
nated for two years only. Action
was tabled until next week's meet
ing for further investigation.
To increase Excom's knowledge of
student opinions, it was recom
mended at the meeting Wednesday
night that Excom meetings be held
in a larger room when controver
sial subjects are on the agenda. A
suggestion box in which ideas and
complaints directed to Excom may
be placed will be set up in the AS
SU office this next week. Office
hours of off-campus, graduate, and
Village representatives will be

published frequently in The Daily
so that constituents will know
where to contact their Excom
member.
DISTRICTS REDEFINED
In a report on the living groups
included in District 111. Ted Norton
suggested that the district be re
defined to include the Boathouse,
Firehouse, and Chinese Club. He
explained that under the new dis
tricting system these houses have
been included in the off-campus
district although the residents live
on campus. It was also decided that
Election Board will clarify all Ex
com districts.
Guyla Runyan, chairman of the
new Social Committee, explained
that the committee members repre
sent living-group areas, organiza
tions, and classes. Each member
will be able to inform his group of
the committee's plans.
CARDINALS PLAN CALENDAR
Among the concrete work they
have started is the erection of a
social, cultural, and athletic events
calendar in front of the Cellar. Car
dinals is financing the calendar. A
second plan of the social committee
is to send every Farm social chair
man a weekly bulletin of student
events. In this way the committee
hopes to co-ordinate campus activi
ties, Miss Runyan stated.
