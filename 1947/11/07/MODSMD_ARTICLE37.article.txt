### 
California students apparently in
reprisal for the painting of the '"Big
C" by Stanford Frosh last week, in
vaded the campus Wednesday night,
painting a large blue "C" on the
sidewalk in front of the Hoover
Library and another on a wing of
Memorial Auditorium. The sign on
the highway near the turn-off to
the campus was also splashed with
blue paint.
One of the freshmen in charge of
the patrols that will go on duty some
time next week to protect the cam
pus from such attacks said that he
considered such early invasions "un
ethical." He urged all students who
will be walking or driving on cam
pus next week to be sure to carry
their student body cards to avoid
the humiliation of being suspected
as Cal students by patroling Fresh
men.
