# Alternate Social Slate Suggested by Ruble
## 
### 
An alternate social program for
freshman women, consisting of an
open day for each living area and
voluntary contacts between the
freshmen and the various houses,
was suggested by Roble sponsors
at Women's Conference meeting
yesterday.
To be used instead of the plan
of six functions per freshman
corridor, discussed last week in
Conference, this proposed pro
gram would leave it up to the
freshman women to take the ini
tiative in organizing social activi
ties with the houses that inter
ested them.
