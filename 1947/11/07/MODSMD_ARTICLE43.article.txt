# 'Little Big Game' Tomorrow! Indians Favored Over Bears
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Stanford's unbeaten frosh gridders wind up their abbreviated
season tomorrow morning in Berkeley, when they meet the
California freshmen in the first "Little Big Game' since the war.
Chuck Taylor's spirited Papoose eleven will meet a star-studded
Cal squad in the preliminary to the Cal-Washington struggle in

Memorial Stadium.
The Bearcub Model "T,' coached
by Harold Grant, boasts a depth of
talent in the backfield. The prob
able starting combination will leat
ure the running of Pete Schabarum,
Bill Greer, and Jim Monachino, and
the passing of A 1 Huber. Schabarum,
a southpaw, also passes.
A second Cal backfield quartet,
almost as good as the first, has Jim
Marino performing the aerial chores,
while Jim Howe, Tom Witter, and
Pearce Godfrey perform well in the
ball-lugginj- department.
MEDIOCRE LINE
The Cub line, not as strong as the
backfield, finds Fill Kitchim and
Bob Minahen a! ends; Bob Witter
and Ed Frye at lackles; Ed Hart and
Bob Knipiash at guards; and Foster
Weeks at center.
The Indian frosh held their last
hard scrimmage Tuesday night.
Since then, Chuck Taylor has been
.sharpening up his charges with a
minimum of heavy contact work.
Taylor feels that the Papooses will
win if, and only if, they enter the
game with the proper mental atti
tude.
Looking at the physical side of
Stanford frosh picture, John Banks,
regular right halfback, will definitely
be out, wiih a case of influenza;
back John Holloway injured his
ankle in practice this week, Bob
Scott has missed practices because
of a glandular illness, and first string
guard Harry Hunt has been out all
week with injuries from last Satur
day's San Jose tilt.
INDIAN STARTERS
Probable starting Stanford line
ups will include Dick Schulze and
Tom August at end; Gordon White
and Walt Watters at the tackles; Don
Lucas and Harry Hunt at guards;
and Dick Abraham at center.
Opening in the Papoose backfield
will be Tom Shaw at quarterback;
Boyd Benson and Jim Hayes or Jim
Auble at halfbacks; and Gordon
Mac Lachlan at fullback. Also slated
to see action for Stanford are Wayne
Buck, southpaw tossing ace at quar
terback; Wally Odneal and Ken La
Crosse, defensive halfbacks; and
Bob Altick, hard-running fullback.
Stanford will rely on line suprem
acy to maintain its perfect record.
Aggressive play by the forward wall,
when coupled with a terrific pass
attack, featuring the aerial offerings
of Shaw and Buck to the explosive
Benson, and a host of rangy ends,
has bowled over Santa Clara, USC,
and San Jose St;ite yearling elevens,
and battled the UCLA Brubabes to
a 14 to 14 tie'.
