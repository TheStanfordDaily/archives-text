# VOLLEYBALL

### 
The hard smashes and smooth
teamwork of the Delta Tau Delta
intramural volleyball team were too
much for a never-say-die Village
117 (II) squad as the Delts edged
the Villagers in two straight games
16 to 14 and 15 to 11.
Led by Davidson and Lamb, the
Delts remain undefeated in their
league. Fess, Boothe, Chavalas, Fitts,
Bradshaw, Dickinson, and Iverson
assured the victory for the Delts.
The fighting Villagers were Logan,
Adams, Payne, Holubar, Smith and
Hamilton.
In an afternoon game the Fiji's (II)
overpowered Encina 5E 15 to 7 and
15 to 9. Village 117 (III) beat En
cina IE by forfeit, while the Beta-
Sigma Chi tilt was postponed.
