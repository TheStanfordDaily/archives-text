### BILL SWIGART 
The battle of the Southern Divis
ion water polo gigantics—undefeat
ed Troy, apparently headed toward
its first title since pre-war days,
and the defending champions, Stan
ford—will take place in the Encina
Pools this afternoon at 3:30.
The Indians, once beaten in con
ference play, will have to avenge
their 11 to 9 overtime loss to USC if
they are to remain in contention.
If, on the other hand, the Trojans
emerge victorious this afternoon,
Stanford will be eliminated, and the
Troy tankers will have a downhill
coast to the title before them.
USC Coach Fred Cady brings
north one of the strongest water polo
s.quads ever to represent the Figu
roa Street Campus. The Troymen,
veterans all, are big, rugged, and
fast.
TROJAN GAME WRECKER
Trojan Dick Kohlhase, the man
who wrecked Stanford's chances last
Friday by scoring a game-tying goal
with but 30 seconds left to play, has
two seasons of conference water polo
experience behind him, and has been
going great guns at the left forward
spot this year.
Another man the Indians must
stop if they are to win is big cen
terback Jack Erickson. Jack scored
four goals against Stanford last
week.
Back into the Indian starting line
up goes the name of Harry Bor
chers, rugged splint who missed
the Olympic Club tilt this week be
cause of an eye injury sustained in
the Stanford-USC game last week
end. Harry's speed was sorely missed
Wednesday night as the Cards went
down to a 10 to 3 defeat at the hands
of the Olympic Clubbers.
BEST IN 25 YEARS
At the conclusion of last Friday's
Stanford-USC game which went in
to two overtime periods, the contest
was described by Troy swimming
mentor Fred Cady as being the best
that he had ever seen in twenty-five
years of coaching. All indications
point to a repeat performance this
afternoon at the Encina Pools.
