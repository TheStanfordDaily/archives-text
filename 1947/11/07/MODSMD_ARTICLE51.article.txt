# Card-Troy Series Goes into 28th Year With Each Team Boasting 13 Victories
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
El Trojan, attired in the robes be
fitting one of the nation's most pow
erful organizations, runs into the
crippled chief from Stanford, swath
ed in naught but bruises, bandages,
and six straight setbacks.
Tomorrow's contest is the tie
breaker—the 28th meeting of both
teams as both Troy and Stanford
have won 13 games apiece, one game
resulting in a tie.
The year the Stanfords ran
through a season undefeated in eight
games was the year the Trojans first
came to the Farm, the Cards, in 1905,
overpowering the Southerners, 16 to
0. Dutch Vanderwoort and speed-of
foot halfback Doc Slusher led the
Indians to their first triumph over
the Trojans.
From 1911 through 1913, the Red
shirts edged the men of Troy, (i to 3,
14 to 0, and 10 to 0, respectively.
FIRST TROJAN WIN
In the year following the first
"Great War," the Trojans, tutored
by crafty Bob Evans, humbled the
Cards via a 13 to 0 count.
Sparked by Bob Cravens and Chet
Dolley, El Troy managed to nip the
charges of Andy Kerr, 6 to 0, in
1922.
The series' initial tie was posted
On the books in 1927, the Trojans
and Stanford struggling to a 13 to
13 deadlock. USC All-American
Morley Drury quarterbacked the
Trojans to two TD's . before Stan
ford's Herb Fleishhacker could pitch
a TD aerial to Lou Vincenti in the
end zone.
INDIANS GET CLUBBED
During the 1928 year of the Her
bert Hoover-Al Smith election, the
Trojans, with Russ Saunders and
Don Williams forcing the issue,
clubbed the Indians, 10 to 0.
A 7 to 0 win in 1929 was engi
neered on the right arm of Trojan
halfback Marsh Duffield who pitched
successfully to End Francis Tap
paan for the game's lone six
pointer.
Worst defeat registered in the
Troy-Card history was seen in 1930,
the Trojans winning out, 41 to 12.
The Trojans rang up a pair of 19
to 13 and 13 to 0 wins in 1931 and
1932, the prelude era to the birth of
a "vow never to lose to USC."
ERA OF THE VOW BOYS
The Vow Boys, eager sophs, blood
and guts, too much Bobby Grayson
and Monk Moscrip edged into grid

iron history in the hoy-day of the j
quick three trips to the land of the |
Roses.
In '33, two field goals by All- |
American Guard Bill Corbus and a j
payoff run by Grayson humbled the '
men of Troy whose marquee was j
filled with All-Americans Ernie I
Smith, Aaron Rosenberg, and Cot- i
ton Warburton.
It was Grayson again in '34, dei
spite the brilliance of Halfback Inky j
Wotkyns and Captain Julie Bescos !
of the Trojans, and the Vow Boys !
registered a 16 to 0 win.
In the most thrilling of the series' i
engagements, in 1935, the Cards de- j
feated the Trojans, 3 to 0. in the last
30 seconds of play, Moscrip winning i
the game with a 13-yard field goal, j
USC wreaked vengeance .on the i
Grayson Era in 1936 by employing j
Amby Schindler to author a 14 to 7 !
win over the Farm hands. Schindler
showed how versatile he was that |
day by tossing to End Roy Wehba |
for the tie-breaker.
IMPORTANT CONVERSION
In 1937, Stanford upset the Tro
jans, 7 to 6, a 51-yard pass from Jim j
Groves to Pete Fay doing the trick. 1

Schindler scored for Troy, but an
extra point, booted by Doc Luckett
proved to be the margin of victory.
After two straight Trojan wins in
1938 and 1939, the Cards bounced
the USC'ers, 21 to 7, with Frank
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and Norm
Standiee leading the 1940 Shaug
nessy troops.
After the Cards battled their way
into Pasadena's Arroyo Seco on
January 1, 1941, the fortunes of "the
wow boys" continued to the tune of
a surprising 13 to 0 win later in the
same year.
Chuck Taylor's galloping theft of
(he football from the arms of Tro
jan Mickey McCardle, and the gen
ius of Ray Hammett, hit the Trojans
via a 14 to (> win at Kezar Stadium
in 1912.
Tin: happiest guy"
"Taylor's probably (he happiest
guy in the city tonight," one wag
ventured after the game which is
more than one might have said in
behalf of Jeff Cravath, USC coach.
Last year: USC 28, Stanford 20.
Leading early in the third panel,
the Cards blew the lid to USC on
line smashes by Hawaiian Johnny
Naumu and Veil Lillywhite.
Stanford touchdowns were regis
tered by Bob Anderson, who reeled
off a G3-yard effort, and Lloyd Mer
riman, who accounted for two
counters.
TOTAL STATISTICS
In total point scoring, the Trojans
have amassed 284 points to Stan
ford's 220 points. Both teams have
notched 13 wins apiece with but one
deadlock to mar the proceedings.
And tomorrow—it'll be the crip
pled Chief versus the high-flying
Trojans with only time and the for
tunes of gridiron war deciding the
outcome.


HALFBACK 808 ANDERSON
will l»e captain of the Indians in
their 2Xt!i football meeting with

gridders will celebrate the occas
ion hy wearing their new white
jerseys with red numerals.
