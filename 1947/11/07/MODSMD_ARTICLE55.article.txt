# Southern California Is Tough; Has Undefeated 1947 Record
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Marehmont Schwartz is a very optimistic gentleman. Last night at
the Pajamarino rally he predicted a Stanford win over the University of
Southern California in tomorrow's game at Los Angeles and that takes a
lot of nerve.
One man who can shed some light on the subject of Stanford's

chances in tomorrow's encounter is
Lon Stiner, whose OSC team was
smothered by the powerful USC
eleven 48 to 6. commented that he
believed Southern Cal should win
easily.
When pressed as to Stanford's
chance of pulling an upset, the soft
spoken football mentor said, "I'll
take Louis. You train some other
fighter." 'Nufi' said.
TOP THE CONFERENCE
The Trojans lead the Pacific Coast
Conference with lour straight wins
and are generally regarded as one
of the top three teams of the coun
try. In addition to the four confer
ence victories, the southern men
have defeated a weak Ohio State
team, 32 to 0, and have been tied
by Rice, 7 to 7.
A quick look at the current PCC
standings shows that the Trojans
rank second in total offense, having
piled up a neat 327-yard average
per game. While so doing they have
held their opponents to a 170-yard
average, which is the league's top
mark in that department. The Troy
outfit ranks second in passing of
fense with a 127-yard average.
In addition to having a well-bal
anced team which excells in both
offensive and defensive play, coach
Jeff Cravath mentors a squad which
contains several outstanding indi
viduals.
THUMP FOR CLEARY
Chief hope of Los Angeles sports
writers in placing an L.A. man on
one of the All-American teams is
Trojan end Paul Cleary. Cleary has
lived up to all his press notices and
appears to be one of the best ends in
Southern California football history.
His claim to fame is chiefly as an
offensive star, noted for his fine

faking ability while on the receiv
j ing end of SC aerials.

Schwartz has put himself far out on
a very weak limb.

per game. While so doing they have
held their opponents to a 170-yard
average, which is the league's top
mark in that department. The Troy
outfit ranks second in passing of
fense with a 127-yard average.
In addition to having a well-bal

offensive and defensive play, coach
Jeff Cravath mentors a squad which
contains several outstanding indi
viduals.
THUMP FOR CLEARY
Chief hope of Los Angeles sports
writers in placing an L.A. man on
one of the All-American teams is
Trojan end Paul Cleary. Cleary has
lived up to all his press notices and
appears to be one of the best ends in
Southern California football history.
His claim to fame is chiefly as an
offensive star, noted for his fine

faking ability while on the receiv
j ing end of SC aerials.

All in all it looks as if Marchie
Schwartz has put himself far out on
a very weak limb.
Marehmont Schwartz is a very optimistic gentleman. Last night at
the Pajamarino rally he predicted a Stanford win over the University of
Southern California in tomorrow's game at Los Angeles and that takes a
lot of nerve.
One man who can shed some light on the subject of Stanford's

chances in tomorrow's encounter is
Lon Stiner, whose OSC team was
smothered by the powerful USC
eleven 48 to 6. commented that he
believed Southern Cal should win
easily.
When pressed as to Stanford's
chance of pulling an upset, the soft
spoken football mentor said, "I'll
take Louis. You train some other
fighter." 'Nufi' said.
TOP THE CONFERENCE
The Trojans lead the Pacific Coast
Conference with lour straight wins
and are generally regarded as one
of the top three teams of the coun
try. In addition to the four confer
ence victories, the southern men
have defeated a weak Ohio State
team, 32 to 0, and have been tied
by Rice, 7 to 7.
A quick look at the current PCC
standings shows that the Trojans
rank second in total offense, having
piled up a neat 327-yard average
per game. While so doing they have
held their opponents to a 170-yard
average, which is the league's top
mark in that department. The Troy
outfit ranks second in passing of
fense with a 127-yard average.
