## 
### 
For the sixth consecutive week,
j The Daily's sports stall presents be
low its studied findings on the vi
! tally important subject, "Football
! Games: Who'll Win 'Em!"
The scribes have taken up the
prediction challenge, issued by no
one in particular, on five previous
occasions and have compiled an ,
■ overall record of 1)7 wins, 14 losses j
and 4 ties, for a percentage of .725.
Compared with other pickers that j
j mark is just average, but one of the j
staff members, Bill Swigart, boasts
a superhuman .840 individual per
centage, with 42 wins, 8 defeats and
I 2 ties.
i Following are the experts' (?) \
| prognostications for the week:
STANFORD-USC: The Indians 1
i show improvement with every game,
but they would have to work a near
miracle to match the Trojans to- I
morrow. Jeff Cravath's eleven is'
almost a sure thing for the Rose
Bowl.
Consensus: USC by 25 points.
CAL-WASHINGTON: California j
proved it was a real football team j
last Saturday by edging out UCLA. I
I (5 to 0, after being shellacked by USC
the previous week. Washington, as i
; we have mentioned before, has good
; potentialities and may nive the Bears
j a rough afternoon.
Consensus: California by 11 points.
UCLA-OSC: Our top man, Bill j
Swigart, looks for an upset in this
| one. He tabs Oregon State by one
| slim point. The other nine scribes
favor UCLA.
Consensus: UCLA by i:t points.
ARMY-NOTRE DAME: Reports
I from the Midwest indicate the Irish
have been saving themselves for j
Army and building up to a devastat- \
ing power display.
Consensus: Notre Dame by 15
I points.
NAVY-GEORGIA TECH: The
Ramblin' Wreck is still rolling along j
without a misfire, protecting an un
defeated, untied record. Navy is fa 1 - I
tering.
Consensus: Georgia Tech by 11 |
points.
OREGON - WASHINGTON
STATE: A breather for the l'ast
improving Webfoot eleven. Wash
ington State has had a very indif
erent season.
Consensus: Oregon by 17 points.
MICHIGAN - INDIANA: Our
weekly average-raiser. The Wol
verines have been held relatively in
check for the last two weeks by
Minnesota and Illinois. Tab them to
run wild against the Hoosiers.
Consensus: Michigan by 20 points.
SANTA CLARA - MICHIGAN
STATE: And another Pacific Coast
representative bites the dust.
Consensus: Michigan State by (i
points.

PURDUE - MINNESOTA: Two
tough teams hook up in one of the j
clay's top games. Purdue looked ter
rific in beating Illinois two weeks i
ago. and Minnesota came within one
touchdown of upsetting Michigan.
Consensus: Minnesota by 2 points."
IGVVA-WISCONSIN: The Badgers,!
after a slow start, are beginning to J
move. lowu has been a disappoint- |
ment.
Consensus: Wisconsin by <» points.
TEXAS-BAYLOR: Another per- i
centage pusher-upper. The Long- j
horns will be fighting mad after |
their loss last week to SMU. Poor
Baylor.
Consensus: Texas by 22 points.
SMU-TEXAS A&M: The Mus- j
tan«s are undefeated and appear to j
be the class of the Southwest Texas
A&M is good but not enough, j
Consensus: SMU by 12 points.
COLUMBIA-DARTMOUTH: Since |
upsetting Army 21 to 20 Columbia i
has been in seventh heaven. Dart- J
mouth, with a strong team, may j
bring the Lions back down to earth, j
but is not expected to win.
Consensus: Columbia by 12 points. |
