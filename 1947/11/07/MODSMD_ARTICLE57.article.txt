## 
### 
Frosh crewmen's spirits got a |
healthy shot in the arm yesterday 1
afternoon when the fledglings rowed i
in real shells lor ihe first time. For
the past five weeks the new oarsmen
have been straining in the crew's
"revered" training scow, absorbing i
the fundamentals of the shell sport. |
Their first attempt at rowing the
sleek 62-foot craft proved to them
that all is not as easy as the varsity j
men make it look. The first ragged, j
boat-tipping strokes gave way to
smoother pulling, however, as the |
eights got the feel of rowing.
