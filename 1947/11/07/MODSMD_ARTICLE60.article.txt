# The 						Ballot Boxes Were Full

### 
The lead story in yesterday's Daily should
not go unnoticed. The Wednesday election
results disprove the theory prevalent at Stan
ford that there is no interest in elections.
The Class of '51 registered a 78 per cent
vote. The men of lower Row went to the polls
in sufficient numbers to register a 50 per cent
turnout.
There is no apathy where 78 per cent and
50 per cent of the students vote.
Compare this with another university. At
USC with a student body of more than 21,000,
only 2,600-plus registered for student body
elections. Of that group less than 1,800 voted.
This all happened a few weeks ago at a cam
pus-wide election for offices similar to our
Excom. #
Perhaps in those Stanford elections where
the turnout is small the fault does not lie with
the student body. Maybe the candidates are
pariially responsible.

The lower Row candidates and the fresh
men apparently had no trouble in getting out
the vote.
