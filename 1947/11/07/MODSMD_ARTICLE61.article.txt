# The 						Unsung Heroes

Every drama has its heroes and villains.
Wednesday night's Pajamarino had more
villains than heroes.
But it had ten heroes. Byron Hovig and his
troup of nine student policemen, attempted the
impossible. They partially succeeded.
Their job was to maintain order at the Paj
amarino. They kept large quantities of fruit
from the pavilion. They slowed down the
fighting.
Later they stood their ground against the
hundreds of persons trying to storm Roble.
In an incident in which most of the char
acters were villains all the praise should go
to the ten student policemen.
