# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
I got up real early yesterday to come to school
so I could get a loge seat in the Reserve book room.
At 7:50 the fish pond was as close as I could get
to the front door of the libe. What a mob of people.
The ones in front of the line must have been there
20 minutes waiting, and when I got there the only
place the line was moving was from one foot to the
other. /
That's the trouble with students today. They're
too eager. Not only is that a sin per se, but it's
lowering my grade average.
I can remember when a librarian was pleased
to have a customer as early as 9:00. and no self
respecting senior was seen until 10:00, unless of
course he was just coming in from the night before.
And what alaout class room technique. What has
happened to the girls who used to sit in the front
row, cross their legs, and get good grades? They've
been replaced by eager young men (and women)
with bright inquisitive eyes and stenographic ma
chines for taking lecture notes.
There used to be a joke about a student who
says to another student:
"Hey Jim, let's cut class today."

Then says Jim to his friend:
"Can't do it. Bob—l need the sleep."
Try telling that to someone today and they react
like the Stanford rooting section after a Cal touch
down. Dead Silence. It has been so long since
anyone has slept in class that they don't even get
the joke. ,
Jake my friend Herman Schmiddling. He's in
Engineering and can't sign his name without the
help of a slide rule. I caught him the other day
going to class on a dead run. I forgave him for
this, since everyone runs to class these days.
"Don't stop me now," he says, "I've got to rush
over to the Professor to find out the advantages of the
overhead subway system."
Questions, questions, pertinent, impertinent, ev
erybody eager. What are we trying to do—solve the
world's problems before the quarter is over?
Why not slow down and live five years longer,
why not? Either that or drop dead so I can catch up.
Sometimes I think if every brain cell in my head
was an atom bomb I still wouldn't have enough to
blow my nose. From here I see only one road out.
Flunk early and avoid the rush.

And what alaout class room technique. What has
happened to the girls who used to sit in the front
row, cross their legs, and get good grades? They've
been replaced by eager young men (and women)
with bright inquisitive eyes and stenographic ma
chines for taking lecture notes.
There used to be a joke about a student who
says to another student:
"Hey Jim, let's cut class today."

Then says Jim to his friend:
"Can't do it. Bob—l need the sleep."
Try telling that to someone today and they react
like the Stanford rooting section after a Cal touch
down. Dead Silence. It has been so long since
anyone has slept in class that they don't even get
the joke. ,
Jake my friend Herman Schmiddling. He's in
Engineering and can't sign his name without the
help of a slide rule. I caught him the other day
going to class on a dead run. I forgave him for
this, since everyone runs to class these days.
"Don't stop me now," he says, "I've got to rush
over to the Professor to find out the advantages of the
overhead subway system."
Questions, questions, pertinent, impertinent, ev
erybody eager. What are we trying to do—solve the
world's problems before the quarter is over?
Why not slow down and live five years longer,
why not? Either that or drop dead so I can catch up.
Sometimes I think if every brain cell in my head
was an atom bomb I still wouldn't have enough to
blow my nose. From here I see only one road out.
Flunk early and avoid the rush.
I got up real early yesterday to come to school
so I could get a loge seat in the Reserve book room.
At 7:50 the fish pond was as close as I could get
to the front door of the libe. What a mob of people.
The ones in front of the line must have been there
20 minutes waiting, and when I got there the only
place the line was moving was from one foot to the
other. /
That's the trouble with students today. They're
too eager. Not only is that a sin per se, but it's
lowering my grade average.
I can remember when a librarian was pleased
to have a customer as early as 9:00. and no self
respecting senior was seen until 10:00, unless of
course he was just coming in from the night before.
