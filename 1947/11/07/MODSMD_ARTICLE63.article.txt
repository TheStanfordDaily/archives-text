# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
The letters which have been written in critic
ism of my missive published in "Campus Opinion
have all skirted or missed the main point of that
letter. The point on which I intended my letter to
be based was the improving of the quality of the
pictures shown at the Sunday Evening Scries by the
showing of pictures which have been past "hits' or
at least near "hits," and which derived their popu
larity from themes based on adventurous, historical,
humorous or other suitable topics. I am not object
ing to the usual love story plot of the majority of
pictures but I am to those which rely on the per
version of the sex topic for their drawing power.
In answer to Mr. Robert King, I'm the first to
agree that everyone should know that there exists
evils such as prostitution but I do not think that the
type of picture which "Scarlet Street represents is
tlic proper vehicle lor informing the public. I admit
the value of informative films concerning venereal
disease and similar topics such as the Army Training
Films portrayed. It is my belief that anyone with
intelligence enough to be admitted to Stanford knows
the existence of the "seamy side of life." I further
believe that the amount of entertainment provided
by the Sunday Evening Series can be greatly in
creased by the showing of the type of pictures I
suggested in the previous paragraph.
Further answering Mr. King, I wish to point
out that he has made a large presumption when he
inquires why I was at the three pictures I mentioned.
For his edification, the only picture I saw at the
Memorial Auditorium was "Scarlet Street" and this
picture I saw only in part—leaving when I decided
that I was wasting time by remaining. The know
ledge of the other two was derived from reviews,
including that of the "Stanford Daily," and from con
versations with people who saw them. After seeing
"Scarlet Street," I learned that it was condemned
by the National Legion of Decency (corrected name).
What I have written thus far serves in part as
an answer to Mr. Joel Franklin s letter, and I com
ment that, according to my informant, the acting in
"Scarlet Street" received favorable recognition from
the movie critics, though I don't recall any "Oscars'
were awarded for these performances—this recol
lection is subject to correction. But Mr. Franklin's
opinions such as "great cinema art." "gripping enter
tainment," and "excellent art," are, I think, too lavish
for the quality of acting to say nothing of the plot
and the various bedroom scenes of "Scarlet Street."
He is entitled to his opinion and I am to mine, which
I expressed in my original letter.
Lastly a word for the much-read graduate student
Connell from the senior Connell. I asked for a
remedy for the type of picture being shown and lack
ing that, a defense for that type of picture. I thought
we were discussing the movie pictures and not the
numerous book* which you mention. By the way,
you might read "Treasure Island" sometime, it is
one of Stevenson's best. Miss Vivian Mertz, in her
contribution to the present discussion has saved me
the trouble of saying what she said so ably.
I have not altered my convictions, moral and
otherwise, and I'm glad to say that I have received
unsolicited verbal support from a number of Stan
ford students.

To the Editor:
Saw George again the other day. "Hello, George,"
I said.
"H'lo," said George. He set down his shovel.
"Seen the LSJUD yet?"
"No. What did somebody say?"
"Pete Stuteville. Says you're precipitous, repre-

hcnsible, coy, wretched, disgusting, an intellectual
snob with no brains, a scoffer with no pot, coy, a
reprchensive esthete, coy, disgusting, ought to
examine your conscience, and you like strip-teases.
"Well, I do like strip-teases."
George bit off a chunk of tobacco. '"Pete don't
like you."
"He sounds hysterical—"
"Oh!" interrupted George, "Almost forgot—he
called YOU hysterical."
"My goodness, he used a lot of big words on me.
You know Pete?"
"Yup," said George. "You going over to pop him
on the beak?"
"Not me. I'm only four feet tall. Anyway, George,
Pete's just what I've been waiting for."
"How's that?"
"Did you real all three letters, George? Mine,
I mean."
"Yup. First one was snobbish, second one was
silly, third one was sarcastic." George thought for
a minute. (George is not very bright, but some
times he's a real deep thinker.) Finally he said,
"You knew that somebody with a dictionary and a
hot temper would jump down your throat. What
are you up to?"
"Well, George," I said, "you're right. It's like this.
Some folks run for a bar when they have a few free
minutes. Others sit on the porch and whistle at the
girls—the ones with the Old Look anyway. But me,
I just like to fish."
"Fish?"
"Sure. I just throw out some bait and wait to
see what kind of a fish will bite."
"What kind do you catch?" asked George nar
rowly.
"Suckers. Every time, George, every single damn
time I catch a sucker."
"You hooked a loud one Thursday."
"Suckers always make the most noise," I said.
"That's why they're so much fun."
"Pete thinks you're reprehensible." George got
back to the subject.
"Where did you learn all those big words,
George?"
"Studyin'. Pete and Vivien Meftz and Bud
Keenan and Ralph been coaehin' me."
"Say," I asked, "where is Bud Keenan these
days? I miss his movie reviews."
George looked at me for a long time. "Fishin'
again?" he asked softly.
"No, George," I protested. "But let's watch the
LSJUD for a while. We've got lots of bait."

To the Editor:
Having hysterically searched through a dictionary
I would like to make a mild retort to Mr. Stuteville.
Ralph Connell and Peter Stuteville judged the
movies concerned from the point of view of absolute
morality I believe. I would attempt to criticise any
movie on its technological aspects and on its prox
imity to reality, viz.: my sense impressions of the
world. 1 find it is not easy to judge as simply and
absolutely good or bad the actions in a movie that is
produced by a member of the fallible human family
for an audience that is just as fallible.
I certainly had no malice in mind concerning the
various viewpoints taken in this controversy. I
think it is good to air these questions in all their
ramifications since none of us has a monopoly on
seeking their answers. The issues are vital enough
that the argument shouldn't degenerate to name
calling in any case.
