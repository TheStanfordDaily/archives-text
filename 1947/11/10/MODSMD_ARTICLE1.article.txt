## Gaieties to Run For Three Nights 
### 
Tickets for the Big Game Gaie
ties will go on sale Wednesday
morning for $1.50, $1.20, and 90
cents, Paul Baker, dramatic man
ager, announced last night.
"Because of the Homecoming, we
are anticipating a three-night sell
out for the Gaieties," Baker said.
"Many alumni have already written
in for tickets, but students will be
given the first chance to buy tick
ets."
BUY TICKETS EARLY
Students are urged to buy their
tickets early, and to try to attend
the Thursday night performance,
for which better seats will be avail
able, Baker added.
Performance times for the three
night run will be 8:15 Wednesday
night and 9:15 Thursday and Fri
day nights, in order to allow stu
dents to attend other Big Game ac
tivities.
The first all-cast rehearsal for the
musical show was held yesterday,
George Eckstein, Gaieties director,
said. "I am very pleased with the
progress of the show so far," Eck
stein added.
GOOD SETS
In the tradition of good staging of
Stanford shows, good sets are
promised for this year's production,
Larry Frankley, technical director,
said.
"Life magazine format will be the
theme of the show," Eckstein said.
There will be take-offs on Life fea
tures, such as the Movie of the
Week, he stated. State of the Un
ion and United Nations skits will
satirize current events.
