# Libe to House Music Room
## 
### 
A new music listening room will
be constructed in the Main Library
to augment as well as to enlarge
the existing facility now available
in the Union, according to Carroll
Blacker, superintendent of build
ings and grounds.
Sixty-two new cigarette-butt re
ceptacles will also be installed at
various points on campus where
the need is greatest. Mr. Blacker
mentioned that in his personal sur
vey of needy areas, he was some
what dismayed at finding the Inner
Quad one of the most butt-littered
areas.
He stated that the receptacles will
be established there as well as in
other places in the hope that "they
will be used, not neglected."
