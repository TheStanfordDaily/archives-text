# Stanford's Radio 'Hams' Transmit Messages From Foreign Students and CI's in Pacific
## 
### 
The Stanford Radio Club with its
two transmitters and membership of
35 ardent "hams," though little no
ticed by the student body generally,
has rendered valuable services for

foreign students and Pacific - sta
tioned Gl's.
The club, under the leadership of
| Robert D. Smith, president, and Os
t wald G. Villard Jr., faculty adviser,

has a 1.000-watf transmitter, W6YX, i
located behind the campus near the
Ryan High-Voltage Laboratory. An
other transmitter, W6ZTE, of lower
frequency, is located on campus in
the Electronics Research Building.
Only the more highly skilled mem
bers are allowed use of the former.
URGENT MESSAGES
Though are activities of the club
for the most part arc routine foreign
contacts, an occasional "errand of
mercy" comes to hand. For exam
ple, an Argentine graduate student
being sent to the Farm by his gov- |
ernment recently was ordered to
the East just as his wife was strick
en with a serious illness. The Stan
ford Radio Club hurriedly made
short-wave contact with his par
ents, and through their influence he
was permitted to defer his trip until
his wife recovered.
The club is ready at all times to ;
transmit emergency messages for j
foreign students, Villard said. Since
contacts are sometimes difficult and
time-consuming, however, the mes
sages should be of urgent content.
CONTACTED GI'S
The club has also "monitored," i
i.e., passed on, many messages from I
GPs stationed in the Pacific. These
also are generally routine, but ur
gent messages are occasionally re
ceived.
The club set a worlds' record of
31 miles for ultra high-frequency |
(9-centimeter wave length) trans- j
mission early last summer, though j
it was soon broken by other opera- J
tors. The power used was less than i
is needed to light an ordinary
flashlight.
