# Relief Drive Funds to Aid U of Naples
## 
### 
The University o\ Naples will re
ceive 30 per cent of the proceeds
j from the Stanford Relief Fund
| Drive which opens today.
The university was founded in
1224 by Emperor Frederick II of
! Germany, then ruler of the king
] dom of Scicily. Frederick, a student
of the arts and sciences himself,
paid the instructors from his own
j pocket. At that time the school
! taught law, theology, medicine, and
; mathematics.
ILLUSTRIOUS FACULTY
The faculty of the university has
! included St. Thomas Aquinas,
! Giambattista Vico, the historian,
| and Francesco de Sanctis.
At present the schools in hte uni
i versity are law, political science,
letters and philosophy, medicine
and surgery, physical and mathe
matical sciences, pharmacy, engi
neering, architecture, agriculture,
and economics and commerce.
The present enrollment of the
university is 27,000. The students
' face great hardships due to the
j shortages of food, clothing, and
housing, and the great inflation that
has hit Italy, according to Professor
Roberto Sangiorgi who visited Na
ples this summer. Books that cost
20 lire before the war now sell for
1 400 lire.
UNIVERSITY BOMBED
j The university suffered greatly
from the bombing by both the Al
lies and the Germans. Four days
after the Italian armistice, the Ger
mans surrounded the university,
broke into the buildings, and set
[ them afire. The attack was made to
, destroy the most important center
| of learning in southern Italy, said
j Mr. Sangiorgi.
The Nazis also burned and de
! stroyed some of the most valuable
: documents that were removed from
| the university for protection against
i bombing. The archives destroyed
include those dating to Frederick 11.
Charles of Anjou, and Alfonso 111
of Aragon.
Sangiorgi stated that to the Ger
mans and Fascists the University of
Naples represented one of the most
important and powerful centers of
opposition against Fascism and the
war.
EQUIPMENT DESTROYED
The laboratory equipment was
totally destroyed as a result of Ger
man bombing attacks. The chemis
try department even lacks money
to purchase a chart of atomic
weights.
In promising substantial material
help to rehabilitate Italy economi
cally and politically, the United
States must not neglect to realize
that cultural reconstruction is also
essential, he said. A fine orientation
of democratic ideas is extremely de
sirable in this direction.
Mr. Sangiorgi continued that we
must realize the great spiritual iso
j lation that was imposed on Italy
! during the Fascist domination. A
helping hand from American stu
dents to Italian students, he said,
will serve a great deal to create
further sympathy between the
youth of both nations.
It would also create better rela
tions between the two countries to
exchange students, he said. The
University of Naples is one of the
universities in which the GI Bill
of Rights is effective.

j Mr. Sangiorgi.
The Nazis also burned and de
! stroyed some of the most valuable
: documents that were removed from

i bombing. The archives destroyed
include those dating to Frederick 11.
Charles of Anjou, and Alfonso 111
of Aragon.
Sangiorgi stated that to the Ger
mans and Fascists the University of
Naples represented one of the most
important and powerful centers of
opposition against Fascism and the
war.
EQUIPMENT DESTROYED
The laboratory equipment was
totally destroyed as a result of Ger
man bombing attacks. The chemis
try department even lacks money
to purchase a chart of atomic
weights.
In promising substantial material
help to rehabilitate Italy economi
cally and politically, the United
States must not neglect to realize
that cultural reconstruction is also
essential, he said. A fine orientation
of democratic ideas is extremely de
sirable in this direction.
Mr. Sangiorgi continued that we
must realize the great spiritual iso
j lation that was imposed on Italy
! during the Fascist domination. A
helping hand from American stu
dents to Italian students, he said,
will serve a great deal to create
further sympathy between the
youth of both nations.
It would also create better rela
tions between the two countries to
exchange students, he said. The
University of Naples is one of the
universities in which the GI Bill
of Rights is effective.
The University o\ Naples will re
ceive 30 per cent of the proceeds
j from the Stanford Relief Fund

The university was founded in
1224 by Emperor Frederick II of

] dom of Scicily. Frederick, a student
of the arts and sciences himself,
paid the instructors from his own
j pocket. At that time the school
! taught law, theology, medicine, and
; mathematics.
ILLUSTRIOUS FACULTY
The faculty of the university has
! included St. Thomas Aquinas,
! Giambattista Vico, the historian,

At present the schools in hte uni
i versity are law, political science,
letters and philosophy, medicine
and surgery, physical and mathe
matical sciences, pharmacy, engi
neering, architecture, agriculture,
and economics and commerce.
The present enrollment of the
university is 27,000. The students
' face great hardships due to the
j shortages of food, clothing, and
housing, and the great inflation that
has hit Italy, according to Professor
Roberto Sangiorgi who visited Na
ples this summer. Books that cost
20 lire before the war now sell for
1 400 lire.
UNIVERSITY BOMBED

from the bombing by both the Al
