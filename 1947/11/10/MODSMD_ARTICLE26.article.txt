Bill Dirker, co-chairman of the

ford students and faculty will realize
how far Iheir contributions will go
toward this same goal, and then con
| tribute as much as they are able."

charitics for their contributions, or
contribute the whole amount to

! chairmen of the drive. This ap

miscellaneous charitable works done
with the proceeds," Joan Eck, treas
urer of the drive stated, "This $200
came from the Emergency Floating
Fund, which will receive 10 per cent
of this year's drive."
