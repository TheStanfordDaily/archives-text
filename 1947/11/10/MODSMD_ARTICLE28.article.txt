# Lang Says UC Has 'Most Autonomous College Government'; Administration, Student Relations Rated Among Best in Nation
## 
### 
"Comparatively speaking, I believe that we have at Cal one
of the best set-ups in the country, both in regards to student
government and our relations with the administration."
Thus prefacing his remarks, Don Lang, ASDC president, de
scribed Cal's Ex Committee- Berkeley terminology for Excom—

which, though one of the voting
members is an administration rep
resentative of President Gordon
Sproul, has proved to be one of the
most autonomous assemblies in
American collegiate circles.
"Of course, the administration has
technically the final jurisdiction,
but we must behave quite well for
we've been able to operate with a
surprising degree of freedom, and
our relations with both faculty and
administration are excellent."
REPRESENTATIVES AT LARGE
In some respects, it was noted,
Cal's student council is much similar
to the Farm's Excom in that epre
sentation is by student body instead
of class. However, instead of elect
ing the representatives by district as |
at Stanford, UC elects its spokesmen j
11 om the student body at large.
In- comparison with the 13 district
members on Stanford's Excom, Cal's
22,000-odd students send only six
representatives to their Ex Commit
tee. Lang, Vice-president Ginny
Carpenter, and the administration
delegate bring the membership total |
to nine.
Instead of student finances being
handled by a Student Manager, the j
UC constitution provides for a Fi- |
nance Committee of six members of j
which Lang is chairman. The six
consist of Lang and two other stu- j
dent, the university's business man- |
ager, an alumni member, and a rep- j
resentative of the administration.
VETO POWER
We used to have four student
members until the Wickhorst I
fiasco of last year prompted the
administration to equalize voting
power by dropping off one stu
dent." Lang said. "However, Ex
committee can veto any decision
the committee may make."
Up to last year. Ex Committee i
hired, paid, and fired all athletic |
personnel. Lang said that last year's i
long search for a new coach was a I
hint to both students and administra- 1
tion that some type of permanent
athletic control was needed. In re
sponse, he said, two new offices \
were created. The title of Director |
of General Activities went to ex- !
student body president, Ed Welch. !
In answer to questions about Cal's !

international organizations, Lang
said that nothing definite has yet
been done by Ex Committee toward
forming permanent international
study groups. "We don't have any
thing equivalent to your lIR, but we
do have several embryonic commit
tees and groups waiting to be
strengthened. Most of them now
operate under Welfare Council."
HOPES FOR NSA
"We are in hopes that NSA will
prove the implement for effectively
consolidating and caring for these
groups."
"I believe NSA's greatest ac
complishment und foremost aim
should be in sending the most
brilliant students available abroad
as American delegates to exchange
ideas and thoughts with foreign
students."
Lang compared the Stanford tour
of the Berkeley campus to another
NSA aim which should be further
encouraged and fostered.
"I wish to thank Stanford stu
dents for this interest they have
shown toward our campus and to
congratulate them lor furthering
student-idea exchange within our
own sphere. I hope to see you
November 22."

"I believe NSA's greatest ac
complishment und foremost aim
should be in sending the most
brilliant students available abroad
as American delegates to exchange
ideas and thoughts with foreign
students."
Lang compared the Stanford tour
of the Berkeley campus to another
NSA aim which should be further
encouraged and fostered.

shown toward our campus and to
congratulate them lor furthering
student-idea exchange within our

Cal's executive committee at the meeting in which it was announced that Frank Wickhorst would no longer
be their football coach. Ed Welch, quarterback and last year's ASUC president is at the extreme right.
"Comparatively speaking, I believe that we have at Cal one
of the best set-ups in the country, both in regards to student
government and our relations with the administration."
Thus prefacing his remarks, Don Lang, ASDC president, de
scribed Cal's Ex Committee- Berkeley terminology for Excom—

which, though one of the voting
members is an administration rep
resentative of President Gordon
Sproul, has proved to be one of the
most autonomous assemblies in
American collegiate circles.
"Of course, the administration has
technically the final jurisdiction,
but we must behave quite well for
we've been able to operate with a
surprising degree of freedom, and
our relations with both faculty and
administration are excellent."
REPRESENTATIVES AT LARGE
In some respects, it was noted,
Cal's student council is much similar
to the Farm's Excom in that epre
sentation is by student body instead
of class. However, instead of elect
ing the representatives by district as |
at Stanford, UC elects its spokesmen j
11 om the student body at large.
In- comparison with the 13 district
members on Stanford's Excom, Cal's
22,000-odd students send only six
representatives to their Ex Commit
tee. Lang, Vice-president Ginny
Carpenter, and the administration
delegate bring the membership total |
to nine.
Instead of student finances being
handled by a Student Manager, the j
UC constitution provides for a Fi- |
nance Committee of six members of j
which Lang is chairman. The six
consist of Lang and two other stu- j
dent, the university's business man- |
ager, an alumni member, and a rep- j
resentative of the administration.
VETO POWER
We used to have four student
members until the Wickhorst I
fiasco of last year prompted the
administration to equalize voting
power by dropping off one stu
dent." Lang said. "However, Ex
committee can veto any decision
the committee may make."
Up to last year. Ex Committee i
hired, paid, and fired all athletic |
personnel. Lang said that last year's i
long search for a new coach was a I
hint to both students and administra- 1
tion that some type of permanent
athletic control was needed. In re
sponse, he said, two new offices \
were created. The title of Director |
of General Activities went to ex- !
student body president, Ed Welch. !
In answer to questions about Cal's !

international organizations, Lang
said that nothing definite has yet
been done by Ex Committee toward
forming permanent international
study groups. "We don't have any
thing equivalent to your lIR, but we
do have several embryonic commit
tees and groups waiting to be
strengthened. Most of them now
operate under Welfare Council."
