# Welfare Council Runs Cal 'I' Clubs
## 
### 
Cal's Welfare Council is the or
ganization that is the catch-all for
most of the university's interna
tional groups and committees.
"NSA will eventually take over
most of our duties as international
committee organizer and watch
dog," explained Welfare Council
Chairman Bunny Southern. "In
fact, if NSA proves the success we
are anticipating, I believe the coun
cil can expect a natural merger
with the association."
Welfare Council embraces a labor
board, a health board, a race-rela
tions board, a world affairs com
mittee, and a campus opinion sur
vey board.
