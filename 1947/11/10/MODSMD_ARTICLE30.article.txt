# UC's Union Plans for Improvements; Conditions Overcrowded at Present
## 
### 
i An 800-car garage and a 10-lane
bowling allley are no idle dream to
the University of California.
Both may well become a living
reality to Cal's 22,000 students when
the plans of their New Student Un
ion Committee are completed. At
present the committee has drawn
up no definite blueprints, but the
two aforementioned featues, which
are a part of University of Minne
sota's Union, may well be incorpo
rated.
Stevens Union is now proving in
adequate to Cal's growing needs,
but in many aspects would seem a
veritable paradise to the Stanford
student.
The Union houses a student store,
ASUC offices, meeting rooms, club
rooms, a taproom, and a cafeteria.
The student store in the base
ment, which they resent being
called a co-op, is quite comparable
to the Bookstore.
RED RUG
Stanford can well regard its neigh
bor's meeting rooms with envy.
The meeting rooms of the alumni
association and the executive com
mittee may well have been lifted
| from an old English manor. The
j most impressive room, however, is
the Memorial Room where installa
tions and music listenings are held.
The most striking features of the
| room are the 30-foot beamed ceil
ing, the paneled walls, the long vel
i vet cardinal-red daperies, and the
! thick red rug; no doubt the color
j scheme will be corrected in the new
! Union plans.
The three massive rooms deco-
J rated in modern motif comprising
the women's clubrooms would turn
any loyal Stanford woman green
with jealousy. Fireplaces, radios,
and low coffee tables are scattered
indiscriminately throughout the
j rooms.
EATING CONDITIONS
The men's cluboom, however, is
an entirely different matter. Its
cramped quarters were bulging
with men escaping from the rain on
the day of Stanford's visit. Paper
and wet raincoats littered the room,
and the only place for elbow room
was around the billiard table.
Another case of inadequate quar
| ters was to be found in the ASUC
| offices. Two tiny rooms comprised
j the working space for their stu-
I dent officers.

rooms, a taproom, and a cafeteria.
The student store in the base
ment, which they resent being
called a co-op, is quite comparable
to the Bookstore.
RED RUG
Stanford can well regard its neigh
bor's meeting rooms with envy.
The meeting rooms of the alumni
association and the executive com
mittee may well have been lifted
| from an old English manor. The
j most impressive room, however, is
the Memorial Room where installa
tions and music listenings are held.
The most striking features of the
| room are the 30-foot beamed ceil
ing, the paneled walls, the long vel
i vet cardinal-red daperies, and the
! thick red rug; no doubt the color
j scheme will be corrected in the new
! Union plans.
The three massive rooms deco-
J rated in modern motif comprising
the women's clubrooms would turn
any loyal Stanford woman green
with jealousy. Fireplaces, radios,
and low coffee tables are scattered
indiscriminately throughout the
j rooms.
EATING CONDITIONS
The men's cluboom, however, is
an entirely different matter. Its
cramped quarters were bulging
with men escaping from the rain on
the day of Stanford's visit. Paper
and wet raincoats littered the room,
and the only place for elbow room
was around the billiard table.
Another case of inadequate quar
| ters was to be found in the ASUC
| offices. Two tiny rooms comprised
j the working space for their stu-
I dent officers.


DON LANG. ASUC president


VIRGINIA CARPENTER, AS
UC vice-president, who explained
that her main duty was "to give
speeches when Don isn't around."
i An 800-car garage and a 10-lane
bowling allley are no idle dream to
the University of California.
Both may well become a living
reality to Cal's 22,000 students when
the plans of their New Student Un
ion Committee are completed. At
present the committee has drawn
up no definite blueprints, but the
two aforementioned featues, which
are a part of University of Minne
sota's Union, may well be incorpo
rated.
Stevens Union is now proving in
adequate to Cal's growing needs,
but in many aspects would seem a
veritable paradise to the Stanford
student.
The Union houses a student store,
ASUC offices, meeting rooms, club
rooms, a taproom, and a cafeteria.
