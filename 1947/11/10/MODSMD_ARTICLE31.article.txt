# Minority Fraternity Membership At Cal Serves Living, Social Needs
## 
### 
Can a fraternity system whose
members total only 12 per cent of
the male student body really help
to serve the social and living needs
of a large university?
'"Definitely so,'' stated Hal Walt,
president of Cal's Interfraternity
Council."I believe that the suc
cess of fraternities can, in part, be
measured by the fact that there has
never been any movement for the
abolition of the Greek societies."
FRATERNITY MINORITY
One cannot, however, point to
Cal alone as having a minority fra
ternity membership, for this is the
case today in most universities with
the system. Stanford, for example,
has 1.089 men or approximately 17
per cent of the male students living
on the Row.
The position of Cal's Interfrater
nity Council is similar in purpose to
that of Stanford's since they are
both affiliated with National Inter
fraternity Council. The council sets

â–  up all rushing and pledge dates, and
j serves as both a legislative and ju
i dicial board.
At present there are 44 Greek
houses at Berkeley with a member
ship of 2,100 men.
FROSH QUESTIONED
A questionnaire is provided each
, entering freshman interested in be-
I coming affiliated with a fraternity.
The information containing the
man's interests and background is
turned over to the Interfraternity
| Council which in turn passes on the
i material to the 44 fraternities.
Cal's rushing period differs from
' that of Stanford in that it begins
! before fall, - semester, whjle the
| Farm's rules set winter quarter for
I rushing.
Hell Week Jasts about three days,
i according to Walt. The name,
! however, has been changed to
| "Work Week" because of the un
| pleasant connotations associated
with the former name.
