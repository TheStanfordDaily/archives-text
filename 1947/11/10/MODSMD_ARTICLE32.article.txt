# High Standards OKâ€”Waldorf
## 
### 
"It is definitely not necessary to
lower academic requirements in or
der to produce high-caliber football
teams."
This is the opinion of Coach Lynn
Waldorf, new member of the Gold
en Bears of UC. Waldorf has proved
the validity of his assertion by
turning out high-powered teams at
Northwestern and at the Univer
sity of California, where high schol
arship standards prevail. In his first
season at the University of Califor
nia, lie has effectively disproved the
statement that "Cal is the grave
yard of coaches."
"It is a little harder to get desir
able material, since perhaps one out
of 15 high school foootball stars
makes the grade here," he said.
"But this doesn't necessarily mean
that football is hampered. The
search is a little wider and you have
to work a little harder with what
you have, but in the end there is
no| appreciable difference in the
teams over a period of years. The
tendency of all schools has been to
raise their academic standards."
Waldorf lauded the 50-year-old
California-Stanford football rivalry,
stating that "traditional rivalries
are really a fine thing." He seemed
generally pleased with the amount
of enthusiasm shown for the annual
classic, which will be played at
Stanford Nov. 22.
