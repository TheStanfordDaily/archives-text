# SC's Prestige Diminished By Indians' Performance
## 
### ART LUBIC Daily Sports Writer 
We can't get out and greet our returning football squad with "All hail the conquering heroes"
this morning, but each and every varsity gridster deserves the hero label, for a courageous,
hard-fighting Cardinal band dropped a close 14 to 0 decision to USC's power-laden Trojans in
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday.
What the score doesn't reveal is that a sturdy Stanford line squirmed all over Troy's stellar
speedster Don Doll, that Figueroa street All-American tackle John Ferraro looked like any
other Joe Blow opposite Pinky Phleger and Harry Ferris, and that Stanford's offense, both run
ning and passing, looked good against the formidable opposition.

Stanford played a great ball
game. There was no denying
it —the Cards turned in their
finest performance to date be
fore 57,749 in the Coliseum
Saturday.
The Redmen were very much in
the bull game at all stages. Coach
Schwartz at first refused to single
out any outstanding performers. "I
liked everybody. All my boys looked
good," he said.
Later, however, he singled out the
center section of the Card forward
wall—Pinky Phleger, Whit Budge,
Don Fix, Jack McKittrick, and Dick
Flat land. He also had words of praise
for Stanford's perennial "one-man
defense"—George Quist, and com
mented that he liked the defensive
work of Kendall Peck and Don
Campbell.
SCHWARTZ PI.EASED
Give credit where credit is due—
to the whole team. Schwartz sum
med it up with the general feeling
in his words to the press—"l liked
everybody out there today."
As far as the scoring went, un
beaten USC tallied in the wan
ing seconds of the first period and
again in the opening moments of
the final stanza.
The Trojans threatened right from
the start, taking the opening kick
off and marching right down to
Stanford's 43 where Bob Anderson
intercepted one of George Murphy's
passes. »
After the Indians came back with
a first down, Murphy intercepted a
lengthy Ainslie Bell pass and ram
bled from his own 37 to Stanford's
41-yard marker.
HALT TROJANS
A Trojan drive from there was
halted when a pass by Murphy was
intercepted by Don Campbell on the
Stanford two. Mike Durket rushed
into the fray and punted from the
end zone, McCardle returning the
kick seven yards to the Cardinal 34.
Jim Powers replaced Murphy and
ran McCardle through the line for
two plays, then carried the mail
himself around end and down to the
Stanford 19 and a first down. Doll
went off tackle all the way to the
one on the first play, then plunged
through guard for the score. Tom
Walker converted to make the count
7 to 0 with 20 seconds remaining in
the quarter.
CRAHAN SNAGS PASS
A sensational catch by Jack Cra
han on a 34-yard pass from Ken

In the victorious Trojan dress
ing room Jt'fV Cravath didn't have
much to say. The (JSC mentor
had gotten out of a sick bed to see
the contest.
"The only fellow whose per
formance I was pleased with,"
said Cravath, "was Tom Walker."
Walker is USC's place-kicking
specialist and enters games for
this purpose only. Ift* hooted both
of USC's extra points.
Cravath was impressed with
Stanford's performance and men
tioned Atherton Phleger as "a
thorn in our side all afternoon."
A trip hack into the Stanford
quarters for a few words with
trainer Con Jarvis revealed that
all the players came out of the
game in good shape. Phleger, the
hoy who made tackles all over the
field, was battered around the
mouth and Vic Conde, sub center,
threw his shoulder out of place—
hut in the excitement it snapped
hack into place again.

Peck carried Stanford into Trojan
territory, but three plays later
Powers intercepted Peck's next pass,
ending the threat.
The Indians came right back with
another offensive march beginning
on their own 20 and carrying into
SC territory. A 14-yard jaunt over
center by Marty Anderson and
Ainslie Bell's completed pass to Bob
Anderson accounted for most of the
yardage.
But the Trojan line rose up in
strength and Bob Hendren and John
Rea broke thi-ough on successive
plays to smother Marty Anderson
and Bell for big losses and force the
Indians to kick.
It was the same story the second
half. Both sides threatened but only
one touchdown resulted—for USC.
TROJANS DRIVE AGAIN
Midway in the third period USC
began the drive that eventually re
sulted in its second and final score.
The Trojans started on their own 32
and drove to Stanford's one-yard
line in a dozen plays. Here some
quick thinking really helped the
Indians.
George Quist, backing up the
Stanford line, pulled the gem of the
afternoon. Getting a running start
before the ball was snapped, Quist
so startled Murphy that the quarter
back fumbled the pigskin and ball
hawk Whit Budge rushed in and
recovered.
Durket punted out of bounds on
the Stanford 41 and the Indians
were out of danger, but only tem
porarily.
TROJAN'S LAST SCORE
The Trojan backfield of Murphy,
McCardle, Doll and Lillywhite was
not to be denied this time. Quist
stopped Lillywhite after five and
Phleger downed Doll after three
more. Then Murphy took the situa
tion in hand and, aided by some
fine offensive work by guards John

Clark and Fred McCall, carried the
pigskin over in three quarterback
sneaks.


ATHERTON PIHJIGEIt. power
ful Indian tackle, played a stand
out game against Southern Cali
fornia's Trojans Saturday. The
215-pound lineman played havoc
with the southerners' ground at
tack, and was singled out by SC's
coach, Jell Cravath, as the Farm's
toughest lineman.
