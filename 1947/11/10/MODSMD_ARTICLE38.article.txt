# Water Poloists Win Over SC
## 
### 
A fighting Stanford water polo
team remained very much in the
contention for its second straight
southern division championship last
Friday afternoon by knocking off a
favored USC seven, 6 to 5, in an
overtime thriller in the Encina Pools.
This win, coupled with the Tro
jan's upset 9 to 5 loss to California
Saturday, left the Cards all alone
on top of the southern division
standings with three wins against a
single defeat in league play.
Hero of the Stanford cause was
big forward Harry Borchers who
knotted the count at 5-all by scor
ing with less than 42 seconds re
maining. It was the same Borchers
who sent Stanford on to win with a
sensational shot past Troy goalie

Ed Finney halfway through the three
minute overtime period.
The Indians, now ahead by a single
tally, managed to control the play
pretty well until time ran out.
Afer Troy scored first, the Cards
had things pretty much their own
way throughout the remainder of
the first two quarters, and led at
halftime, 3 to 1.
The Southerners roared back af
ter the intermission, and successive
goals by Kohlhase, Hanson, Erickson,
and Kohlhase again. Troy went
ahead, 5 to 3.
Stanford finally rallied in the
fourth quarter when Captain Dick
Narver connected from close in, and
the stage was set for Borchers' ty
ing and winning tallies.
In the final minute of play six
men, five from Stanford and one
from USC, were ejected.
