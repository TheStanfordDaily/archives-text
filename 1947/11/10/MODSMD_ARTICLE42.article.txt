Stanford's Relief Fund Drive opens today
with a goal of 512,000 to be reached by Satur
day night.
The important fact about this drive is that
it is a project handled by students to help other
students. Proceeds will be divided so that 30
per cent will go to the war-torn University of
Naples, 20 per cent to the World Student Serv
ice Fund, 40 per cent to the Palo Alto-Stanford
Community Youth Fund, and 10 per cent to
miscellaneous charities including the Cancer
Fund and the March of Dimes.
Frequently in the past few months students
have asked the question, "What can I do
alone to help the international situation?" This
drive offers a real opportunity for every Stan
ford student to make a contribution to world
cooperation in more than a nebulous way.
The Farm has pledged itself through the
WSSF to give aid to the University of Naples.
The degree of help we can give to a school
that needs books, class rooms, and housing
facilities will depend on the success of this
week's drive.
Thursday's "Dime for a Meal" campaign,
Friday's cake sale, and the Blue Mood dance
on Saturday must be supported by the stu
dent body. The committees planning the drive

want active interest and participation from the
campus as well as the contribution of funds.
If anyone is in doubt of the great needs
which the drive is helping to fill, they should
attend a showing of the "Seeds of Destiny"
this week or hear the talks that wi'l be given
at Toyon tonight and the Village Wednesday.
Other west coast colleges are watching
Stanford's progress in the international activi
ties with great interest. Our success or failure
in this drive will be a good indication of the
"awareness" and interest of the Farm student
body in backing the aims of our international
committees.
Another important beneficiary of the drive
is the Community Youth Fund which sponsors
a council that aids veterans, in their search
for housing. Most of the applicants for this
service have been Stanford students.
The importance of the Cancer Fund and the
March of Dimes to each citizen of this country
needs no explanation. Every effort will be
made during the week to inform the campus
of where the drive collections will go and why
the success of the drive is necessary/
Is the Stanford student body still in its Ivory
Tower, or are we willing to do our part as
adults and citizens?â€”M.S.
