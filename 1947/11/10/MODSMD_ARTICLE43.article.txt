# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
With Big Game coming close, anti-Red activities on
(lie Bear campus are starting to move into gear. A
couple of us paid them a short visit the other day
just to see some old friends we're not too proud of,
and it might be good to issue a word of advice.
They're as childish as ever, the Bears.
Only last week preparations were being com
pleted for the erection of a radio tower on the
Berkeley campus. Just what need Cal has for broad
casting I can't see â€”with its overgrown student body
and Roos Bros, megaphones anything it wants to
say needs only yell leaders, not amplification!
But on the other hand I can see where they
might find some use for the radio tower after all,
and right on campus too. While browsing about,
we thought we'd take in a class at Cal. Not wishing
to arouse suspicion, we put silly looks on our faces
and passed the ticket-taker at the door unnoticed.

A sweet young usher pointed to the third aisle, row
53, where we found two good seats. It was a small
class that day, only 467 were present!
So maybe the radio tower would enable combin
ing some of those classes and broadcasting lectures!
But I'm getting off the story. When the UC au
thorities requested permission to put up this tower,
they were told by CAA officials that a red light
would have to mark the top of the tower in order
to warn low-flying planes. This was too much for the
Cal spirit, and they requested reconsideration.
They asked the CAA to let them put blue, or
even yellow, lights on top of the tower, but the
government stood pat and said no soap. So now poor
Cal has had it.
It's either red lights on Berkeley campus, or no
light at all!
(Cal's motto: "Let there be light.") You bet!
