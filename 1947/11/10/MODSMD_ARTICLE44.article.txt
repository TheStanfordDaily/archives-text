# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It is really too bad that The Daily is not equipped
with a two-color press. Mr. Rospaw's column of
last Wednesday certainly deserved a heavy red bor
der to set it oft from the ads and the Campus Opinion
which is currently devoted to the theme of not
hurting people's feelings with spontaneous outbursts
of campus spirit. I don't mean to imply that Mr.
Rospaw is a Red, I feel certain that he was not so
raised, nor is he currently a believer, nor as his
future unfolds and he receives a certain amount of
primary instruction in what the Reds stand for is he
likely to take on that hue. But whpn I read such
misguided drivel, I see red. My studying for the day
is over. I'm unhappy and upset. The red border
would be a simple warning to not read that par
ticular piece until my academic duties have been
accomplished for that day.
Mr. Rospaw apparently feels deeply about the
fact that currently some democratic-spirited Ameri
cans are taking positive steps to defend and preserve
our way of life. Perhaps he even sneered at his
typewriter in his lonely room, particularly when he
pecked at the quotation mark key to imply that "the
present 'crisis' " was no crisis at all, that the "'front'
organizations" weren't fronts at all, and that "100 top
'leaders' in Washington" weren't leaders at all.
I feel sure, Mr. Rospaw, that as you diligently
turn the pages of one book after another in the course
of your studies, that eventually you will come to
appreciate the validity and the implications of these
three facts (which you probably will find or deduce
from your texts): (1) that Fascism WAS the irra
tional organization of confusion, (2) that Sovietism
IS a political integration of the urge of the Russian
proletariat to dominate the world for its own benefit,
and (3) that Capitalist-Liberal-Democracy IS a
multi-faceted endeavor to preserve the rights of the
individual in the face of any and every conceivable
integrative effort that would destroy the infinite
variety of all those rights already won and yet to
be won.
No, we shall not "fall into a mould to destroy a
mould." Our way of life will always produce leaders
who in times of peace will strive in the public eye
to unmask those individuals who would toss our
achievements aside in favor of some outside ide
ology and who, when war is forccd upon us, will
lead free individuals from every walk of life to
victory. Some of us individuals may look a little
ridiculous in the process of developing our own in
dividuality, whether our names are Menjou, Thomas,
Rospaw, or Kirk, but did you ever read Whitman
on the subject? Especially where he says:
"the simple idea that the last, best dependence
is lo he upon humanity itself, and its own inherent,
normal, fullgrown qualities, without any supersti
tious support whatever. This idea of perfect in
dividualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and
gives character to the idea of the aggregate."
Or, in your contact with books, those communic
able residues of the conclusions of the greatest
thinkers, did you ever read E. E. Cummings' book
"Eimi" which autobiographically describes the dis
illusionment of an outspoken leftist which occurred
when he visited Moscow? You should do so some
time before you apply for that educational-travel

visa for your passport. It might save you time and
money.
Talk that over on the tennis court when the
committee of 25 next meets.
