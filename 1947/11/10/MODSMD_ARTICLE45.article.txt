To the Editor:
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Guttehen. Or is it
the Guttehen twins, Anne and Bob?
When you say during the past war the War Chest
collected and functioned as the central clearing
house and allocation board for all monies needed by
the USO, the Red Cross, the YMCA etc., I am afraid
that that is one-third inaccurate, and might cause
some future confusion.
The Red Cross was set up in America under a
Congressional charter to function in time of war, of
disaster, and peace as the instrument of the volun
tary helpfulness of the American people. Therefore
it yearly collects its own funds, in a national cam
paign, separate from all other organizations. This
remains true in war-time. It makes its own budget,
nationally and by chapters, its financial affairs are
triply audited, and the money is spent strictly for
the purposes for which it is asked.
Therefore Red Cross is never a part of "War
Chests" or Community Chests. There will be the
usual Red Cross drive in March 1948, wherein Stan
ford faculty and staff and "plant" will give through
the local chapter's campaign. Stanford students con
duct their own drive. Which has, incidently, always
gone over its top.
