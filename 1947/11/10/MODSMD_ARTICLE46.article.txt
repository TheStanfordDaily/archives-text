Dear Editor:
Congratulations on your excellent Campus Opin
ion section. The friendly, spirited rivalry that exists
there is another example of the freedoms that make
this country great. Those nasty old countries that
want to change our ways of life should take heed
of these letters and what they stand for. We Daily
readers are lucky to have such clear, level-headed
opinions and constructive advice. But just so you
won't think that this is a eulogy, aren't you over
doing it a teensy-weensy bit?
