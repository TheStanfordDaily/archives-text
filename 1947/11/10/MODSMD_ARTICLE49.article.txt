# 'Richard III' Production Has Professional Calibre
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
Last week the Stanford Players
opened their season with Shake
speare's "Richard III," and it was a
superb production throughout.
In the first place, the Players im
ported no "big name" actors to play
the leads, as has been the practice
in past years. Recognized veterans
of the stage have shown a marked
tendency toward disinterest when
starring in "mere college produc
tions," as in last year's lu'.ewarm
production of "Macbeth."
Roy Poole as Richard turned in
a really fine performance, support
ing the theory that an enthusiastic,
interested actor can more than com
pensate for the difference between
a comparatively inexperienced ac
tor and a veteran. Poole was as
sinister, malignant, and thoroughly
evil as Shakespeare's infamous vil
lain should be.
Richard Eagan as the Duke of
Buckingham and Ruth Fisher as
Queen Elizabeth were outstanding.
In no respect did their acting vary
from an impressive perception of
the roles potrayed. Also deserving
of great praise are Mel Ellett, who
played the Duke of Richmond: Al
ienee Fletcher, the Duke of Clar
ence; Patric Shannon, Edward IV;
and Marjorie ForkneV, the Duchess
of York. And little Jackie Sheehy,
cast as Richard, Duke of York, rates
high praise for his acting.
Dr. A. Nicholas Vardac and his
production staff deserve a lot of
credit for excellent costuming, a
very unique and colorful set, and
consistently impressive lighting ef
fects. Leonard Ratner's music, too,
contributed much to dramatic val
ues projected in the play and served
as an effective agent in heightening
moods.
