Oh here's to Stanford Village
With calories at the end of the line,
And here's to the brave-hearted
students,
That there must live and dine.
But when you're tired of calories,
And want some food that's fine,
Then pen an ode to ole Longbarn,
That won a meal like mine.

Jack and Jill went up the hill
They each had a buck'n a
quarter
Jill came down with two'n a half
Do you think they went up for
water?

Definition of Puppy Love,
Beginning of a dog's life.

NEXT—What happened to Archie?
You, too, can get lost by sending
high-class literary contributions to
Eddie care of the restaurant
LONGBARN
is where dinner costs Stanford
Students less than anywhere else.
