###

A predestined "Blue Mood" will
hit the campus en masse Saturday
when the Stanford Relief Fund
takes over the Women's Gymna
sium for an evening of dancing from
9 to 1 for the benefit, of the Farm's
relief project, stated arrangements
chairman Peter Koeliler.
Billed as a "new high in smooth,
romantic dances," the mood indigo
affair will spotlight the sweet and
low music of Gary Nottingham and
his orchestra.
Special decorations by Jane Bush
and committee, designed to lower
the gymnasium ceiling to a level
befitting the dance theme, will serve
to answer the traditional question,
''How dark can a dance get?"
As a change from the usual jello
wafer punch, cakes will be available
as refreshment for dancers, Koehlcr
explained.
Burma - Shave signs explaining
the advantages of dancing to the
"smooth, easy music" of Notting
ham's aggregation will point the
way for neophyte bid-buyers to the
ASSU office in Old Union, where
tickets to the affair may be pur
chased for $1.80. Bids are also on
sale at all Stanford relief contribu
tion booths.
Informality will be the keynote of
the dance, which will be scheduled
in celebration of the Oregon foot
ball game and which will bring to
a climax the Stanford Belief Fund
Drive, headed by Molly Shaw and
Bill Dirker.
