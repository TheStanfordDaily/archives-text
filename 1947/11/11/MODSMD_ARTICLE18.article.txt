# Boys' Town Choir Here Thursday
## 
### JERRY DANIELS 
Since that day shortly before
Christmas, 1917, when Father E. J.
Flanagan took three boys from the
juvenile court, rescued two more
from the street, and rented a ten
room house on the edge of Omaha's
business district, Boys' Town has
grown until now almost 1,000 boys
find a home in that city of little
men.
Out of this unique haven for the
homeless came the Boys' Town
Choir. Last year it toured through
out the East and Mid-West thrilling
more than 50,000 listeners in such
major music centers as Boston, Chi
cago, Cleveland, and finally Carne
gie Hall, New York.
Returning to Boys' Town, the
choir learned new repertoire to add
to the approximately 125 composi
tions already in command and prac
ticed singing to perfection without
scores. And this year the choir is
touring the West and West Coast.
Stanford will play host to this
nationally famous group of singers

in the Memorial Auditorium Thurs
day evening. The performance will
mark the opening of the 1947 Stan
ford Concert Series.
The choristers represent many
different, races, creeds, and ieli
gions. They range in age from 11
to 18, in voice through the soprano
alto-tenor and bass circuit, and in
repertoire from Palcstiina to
Gershwin.
Barbara Aitken, concert manager,
announced last night that tickets for
the Boys' Town Choir performance
may still be purchased in the Ni
tcry. The office hours are from 1 to
5. Students who purchased season
tickets arc reminded to pick up
their tickcts before Thursday's per
formance.
The choir was organized in 1936,
when the boys sang at church serv
ices. in school groups, and at sports
rallies. Their nationwide popularity
has been gained since the arrival of
Father Francis Schmitt as director.
