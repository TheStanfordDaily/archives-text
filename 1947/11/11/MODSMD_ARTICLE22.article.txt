### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP).—
President Truman told Congress to
day that the $400,000,000 Greek -
Turkish aid program has momen
tarily staved off Communist domi
nation and economic collapse in
Greece, but he said the overall sit
uation in the key Balkan state re
mains unimproved. He hinted that
more funds may be needed.
The report, prepared by the State
Department, said there has been
"an over-all worsening of the mili
tary situation" in the civil war be
tween the Greek government and
Communist-led guerrilla bands.
It said order cannot be restored
in Greece until the new United Na
tions Balkan commission "effective
ly seals the Greek border against
assistance to the guerrillas from
Greece's northern neighbors"—Yu
goslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania.
The report said American ship
ments of military supplies, plus the
"very presence" of a 206-nian U.S.
mission in Greece, "have been re- I
sponsible for the fact that Greece is
still free and that her people still
have a government of their own
ehoosinf?."
