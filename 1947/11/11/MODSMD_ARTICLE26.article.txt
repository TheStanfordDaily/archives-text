# Grid Star Plays Composer, Not End, In Gaieties 'Movie of the Week' Skit
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
A football player portraying a football player trying to act the
part of a piano-composer is news.
But when the hero of the piece is Gene Martin, and when the
setting is Stanford University, "the news becomes interesting."
It's all a part of the Gaieties—"Movie of the Week," they call

it. And our hero, the musically
minded Martin, goes through a ver
itable hell before the plot is born.
KIGIIT GUY ANI) GENIUS
He's a piano-composer, see! Not
one of (hem honky tonk, low jive
manglers, but a right guy and a
genius. He loves music and would
rather play than eat. That's why
he's so thin.
The movie, dressed with "The
Schmoery Story" label, bids fair
to providing monumental compe
tition to a recent celluloid opus
about "a .iazzy mammy singer."
Martin has the role of Leib, the
composer, with svelte Charlotte
Barrett cast as his wife. Of course,
there are other women in his life-
Jane Bush, Charlyn Pyles, Donna
Niehl, Joyce Oldham, and Joan Ash
ley.
LOCATION ON TIIE FARM
Gaieties' location troupes had
their cameras, props, and grips in
and about th« Lawrence Frost Me
morial Amphitheater and Dean
Lawrence Kimpton's home last
weekend filming the story.
I'iist curtain for the Gaieties goes
up the evening of Nov. 19 at Mem
orial Auditorium. A satirical glance
-I Life Magazine entitled, "That's
Life" will front an audience that
will take in "the saga of a football
player turned composer" as one of
I lie production's salient line skits.
But back to Martin and"The
Schmoery Story!"
LEIB MANAGES ABLY
Flashing musical inspiration of the
highest order in the midst of six
beautiful women, ole' Leib man
ages to write several smash hits pre
paratory to ending his career as a
downtrodden, penny - ante cymbal
player.
Which goes to prove that anybody
ran enact the role of a gridster mim
icking a sharps and flats author—and
that anybody can well be a guy
named Martin.


Technical directo* Larry Frankley lines up a sli«( for the epic Stanford cinematic achievement, "The
Kchmoery Story," which will he shown in this fall's (iaicties. (i< ne Martin, Indian grid star who plays the
leading role of a Hollywood composer in the movie, siis surrounded toy a hevy of beauties, Stanford style.
Krom left to right they are Joyce Oldham, Joan Ashley. Char Pyles, Donna Niehl, Charlotte Barrett and
