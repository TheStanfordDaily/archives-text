# Chief Davis Recalls 17 Seasons on Farm
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Stanford's 11-man police depart
ment goes into its l'Jth season this
year after having combatted every
thing from parking violations to
murder. Head man of the growing
organization is Chief "Gordy" Davis
with 17 notches carved (figurative
ly) in his gun since he arrived here
in 1930.
According to back files of The
Daily, the Farm's most serious and
sensational event for Stanford po
lice action was the 1933 Lamson
murder on Salvatierra Street. Uni
versity Press sales manager David
Lamson was freed of the charge of
murdering his wife after one mis
trial and two hung juries failed to
bring about a definite verdict.
But on the lighter side, Davis re
ferred to an incident last year when

the department came across its most
humorous incident—one that gained
international publicity from Ger
many to Tokyo.
IS HE COMING OR GOING?
Sgt. Edward Farmin rubbed his
eyes when he saw a student driving
a rented car in reverse up Palm
Drive from PaJo Alto. When the of
ficer halted the car and asked the
student "Why?" the boy explained
that the vehicle did not register
mileage on the speedometer when
the car traveled backward. "I save
10 cents a mile rental charge," he
told the surprised officer.
II Cal stages a raid this year be
fore the Big Game, Gordy said that
"it would be up to the students and
their government to handle the sit
uation. I We would step in only if
public injury or damage to public
property is threatened."
>1 ANY TWO-DOLLAR FINES
"Our less spectacular cases today
consist of two-dollar parking fines,"
Gordy continued, "and the basic ex
cuse is usually some form of the 'I
didn't know there was such a rule'
explanation. Although 4,000 cars
ride the campus roads daily, the de
partment's speeding violations num
ber less than pre-war citations."
"While we are on the subject of
auto population," Davis added, "I
remember when 1 first joined the
department in 1930 there were so
few cars that I could name the
driver by just seeing what model
car he piloted."

Davis" or "Chief Davis" place sec
ond to "Gordy" here at Stanford,
where most of the department's
contact is with students. "We are
part of Stanford, working with the
students," he said.
"If the department were to bo
called in by the students for aid in
an acute problem," Davis continued,
"we would lend a hand quickly.
Our eight patrolmen and two night
watchmen are not in conflict with
student government, but work with
it."
