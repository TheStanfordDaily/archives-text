# Poloists Want More Horsemen
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
"lf you can straddle a saddle and
hold your seat for a while, if you
like horses and especially polo,
brother, you'd better trot over right
quick to the 'Old Red Barn,' leave
your name with me, and get signed
up for a Saturday morning prac
tice."
So encourages Bill Decker, Stan
ford's number one poloist and stu
dent instructor, in his quest for
more and more polo enthusiasts.
And if you do choose to head over
past Roble arid Lagunita to the Big
Barn, former stables of Senator
Stanford's famous race horses,
you'll probably recognize genial
Bill running or riding around in his
usual garb.
As he puts it, "Ten-gallon hat,
levis, and boots are my standbys. I
wear them practically all the time,
except when I go over to the Quad
for classes." Bill slated that he was
a major in creative writing, some
thing many students find hard to
believe in view of his intense in
terest in polo.
POLO CLUB ORGANIZED
"Nevertheless," says he, "Bob
Lawson and I have found time to
get together and organize the Stan
lord Polo Association, and hope that
it will become one of the Farm's
leading extracurricular societies."
And it is true. Deckcr and Law
son are post-war pioneers of Stan
ford's war-dormant polo team. A;; |
Bill says,"The two of us met last
spring quarter and decided that
there must be plenty of other guys ]
and gals besides us who had 'polo
mania,' and would jump at the op- j
portunity to join such a club."
"You see," he went on, "polo is j
no longer an organized sport at
Stanford. Even from the time of its
inauguration in 1921 till its halt just
before the war, it was strictly an j
ROTC activity. The horses were !
Army, the instructors cavalry men.
and the players were required to j
be taking the RO course.
ANYBODY CAN JOIN
"In our present program, the only
requirement for admission is a basic j
knowledge of horsemanship and a
hankering to play 'hockey on horse- I
back'."
"But," continued Decker, "to get J
back to those first few formative j
days of our young organization, Bob \
and I were faced with two big
problems. The first was how to get (
the all-important horses for the as
sociation; and the second, how to
pay for these and other necessary j
items.
"As to our first difficulty, it was
surmounted with greater ease than
we had ever expected. Mr. Allen
Ross, who is now owner of all the j
Red Barn's ponies, came through i
with a timely rental proposition
giving us leave to rent a certain i
number of his animals each week.
DUES 512.50 PER MONTII
"With the inclusion of this figure |
in our budget, we were able to es
timate our total monthly expenses,
and after some tedious figuring, set
tled on a $12.50 per month fee as'
the final requisite for SPA mem
bership. This payment was calcu- j

lated to pay for all horse rental,
instruction, and equipment charges
for the average month, and amaz
ingly enough has stood the test of
time and remains to this day.
"So before we knew it. we were
organized. I began to teach classes
every Saturday, and as the quarter
progressed saw some definite signs
of improvement in almost all the
new members."
Bill mentioned that his teaching
program included four phases: (1)
basic horsemanship in polo; (2)
stick work; (3) theory of the game;
and (4) strategy. "In each of these
phases," he said, "emphasis is placed
on the x - esponsibility of each player
both to himself as an integral part
of the squad, and to the team as a
whole." He mentioned that the
safety angle is not overlooked, and
that to date there have been no
serious accidents on the field.
30 IN POLO CLASS
"Each man rides four hours a
week," he stated, "two on Saturday
and the rest by arrangement some
week-day afternoon. There are at
present 30 enrolled in the classes,
with room for lots more."
"As to the actual games," he said,
"most of them are played against
professional teams. College squads
arc hard to find, especially here in
Northern California." Decker ex
pressed the hope, however, that
soon, with the possible new mem
berships coming up, intersquad
games would be played. 'We would
also like to have an all - female
team." he said. 'I have known sev

era! excellent women polo players."
He mentioned that V. K. Thomp
son, instructor in architecture, is
the hard-riding referee for most of
the games.
LAWSON NUMBER ONE
In speaking of team personnel,
Bill mentioned first the name of his
cohort, Bob Lawson. "Bob poloed
with the crackerjack New Mexico
Military Institute team before com
ing to Stanford," he said, "and now
holds down the number one spot
on our club. Bill Dirker is number
two, Todd Helser number three,
and myself number four.
"Dirker, whose name is often
confused with Decker, starred on
the RO team before the war, and
is at present probably the associa
tion's most outstanding .player."
Decker said, "Sometimes the SPA
is confused with the University
sponsored riding school class in
polo. This course is also taught by
me, but in nearly every case is
taken to fulfill the physical educa
tion requirement." He said that he
hoped games could be arranged be
tween his two groups.
And with this, the Farm's chief
willow walloper rose from his wick
er chair and announced that, ''This
is about all I can say about polo at
Stanford. Just one thing more: if
anyone is interested in polo play
ing, get in touch with either Bob
Lawson or myself as soon as pos
sible. We both guarantee you a lot
of fun and plenty of thrills. If you
can't make the team, we'll be seeing
you at our games down at the Polo
Field behind the Stadium."
