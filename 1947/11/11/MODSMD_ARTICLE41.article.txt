# Indians Scrum For Duck Tilt
## 
### 
There seems to be no end to
Marchie Schwartz's worries about
the varsity football team's injury
list. The Stanford coach announced
yesterday that Marty Anderson, hard
hitting fullback and standout of the
Oregon State game two weeks ago,
injured his elbow while making a
tackle on the final play of Satur
day's game against USC.
Schwartz said that X-rays are
being taken to determine whether
or not Anderson chipped his elbow.
Also on the injury list is end Dan
Mervin, whose knee has been giving
him trouble, and halfback Mickey
Titus, who has been out for the
better part of the season.
Coach Schwartz excused the var
sity footballers who participated
against Southern California from
practice yesterday. However, the
gridders who did not see action
against the Trojans last Saturday
were put through a rough, hour-plus
scrimmage.
The final result showed A 1 Morris'
Reds defeating Don Campbell's
Whites by a 13-0 count. Fred Par
sons featured the Reds' offense as
he broke away for several long runs.
Dave Field was the standout for the
Whites. The little halfback was the
bulwark of the loser's defense until
he was injured slightly in a head-on
collision late in the scrum.
Schwartz said, that offense, not
defense, would be stressed in this
week's practices. "We're only plan
ning to devote one hour and a half
to defense," he said. "We are con
centrating on offense because we in
tend to score a couple of touch
downs against Oregon this coming
Saturday."
