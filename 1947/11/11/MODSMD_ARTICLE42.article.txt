# Delts Roll On, Down V-11OB
## 
### 
The Delta Tau Deltas continued
their winning ways yesterday as they
rolled over Village 11 OB 27 to 0 and
thus remained undefeated in mural
football competition.
The Delts scored in the first few
minutes of play as a pass from Jim
Bradshaw to Milt Walkup found its
mark. Another pass from Arce to
Bradshaw went all the way and
the fraternity men enjoyed a two
touchdown lead at half-time.
The third Delt score came on one
of the trickiest plays seen on the
mural fields this year. Arce took
the hand-back from center and re
versed to Bradshaw who, while run
ning laterally, flipped a pass to Arce
who ran between two defenders,
grabbed the ball and rambled the
remaining distance to pay-dirt. The
final six-pointer was produced by
the Bradshaw to Walkup pass com
bination.
In other games yesterday the
Theta Chis whipped Village 210,
12 to 0; Zela Psi defeated Toyon
248, 18 to 0, and the Firehouse
routed Village 119 50 to 0.
