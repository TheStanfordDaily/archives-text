# Frosh Grid Success
## 
### 
The underpublicized Stanford freshman
football squad climaxed one of the most suc
cessful seasons in Farm history Saturday with
a victory in the annual "Little Big Game."
Before dumping Cal the Papoose eleven
roared to victories over the freshman teams
from Santa Clara, USC, and San Jose State, and
held the UCLA Brubabes to a 14-14 tie.
Saturday's "Little Big Game" will be long
remembered as one of the most exciting and
hard-fought contests in the long history of the
Stanford-Cal rivalry. The young Indians were
forced to come from behind in the fourth quar
ter to win 33-27.
Too much praise cannot be given to the
team for their fine showing this year, and a

special bouquet is due Coach Chuck Taylor for
an outstanding coaching job.
No doubt some of this year's Frosh will be
sparkplugging the Farm's 1948 Varsity grid
machine.â€”D.D.
