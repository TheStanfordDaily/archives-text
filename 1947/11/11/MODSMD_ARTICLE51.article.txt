# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL MUNK 
This is a note of despair, pure unadulterated
despair!
I don't know how many are sharing this tragedy
with me, but I'm sure someone must. They can't
have picked on me alone—it isn't fair.
Things are getting so rough I can't even spare
a 3-eent stamp to write them a letter, so maybe
this will reach those villains on Fourth street in SF.
Yes, the Veterans Administration has snafued the
show again, and this time there'd better be a good
excuse. The last time those little green checks
from Uncle Sam were late everyone blamed Congress
for cutting appropriations. Can't be so this time,
Congress isn't even in special session yet, but Bull
Session is.
First of all, why all those innocent little post
cards that VA is sending us. The first in the current
series arrived about the first week of the month, and
said that all the papers were in order, but that
the checks would be held up till the 10th. Ok, fine,
but three days later another card gleefully announces
that the papers are still in order, but that the money
will be delayed an extra week.
And now I hear the third cards of the series are
starting to come in. Why add insult to injury! If
you don't wan't to send the checks, VA, don't! 2But
you don't have to rub it in. There can't be a short
age of personnel, or there wouldn't be enough help
to address and mail out all these notices to the vets.

There can't be a shortage of money in the country,
or Stanford would have closed down a long time ago.
So what I think really has happened is that the VA
has gone into cahoots with the loan sharks of the
Bay Area, and are splitting profits.
There are differences of opinion on whom to
blame this mess. The campus Democrats gleefully in
sinuate that if Congress hadn't cut down government
personnel so much, we would all have our little
checks by now, while the steadfast Republicans
maintain that if those in the VA now would do some
thing to earn their pay instead of playing around
with the postcards, all would be well.
Personally I can't make up my mind, but I think
the Communists are to blame. It's an obvious at
tempt to make "have-nots" out of some of us "have
littles," and it didn't take much. Of course, it could
also be a resurgent attempt of the Prohibitionists to
take their toll and to ruin the liquor industry by cut
ting the money circulation on campuses.
But now I see it clearly, quite clearly! It's Charles
"no soap"' Luckman who is at the bottom of all the
trouble. Luckman talks VA into holding back vets'
checks, which in turn cuts our income (completely?),
which in turn cuts the consumption of beverages,
which means less production and less use of wheat
and saves food for the needy of Europe!
Oh well, I guess we better quit our moaning, for
the VA is aiding the relief program. I'm a martyr!
This is a note of despair, pure unadulterated
despair!

checks by now, while the steadfast Republicans
maintain that if those in the VA now would do some
thing to earn their pay instead of playing around
with the postcards, all would be well.
Personally I can't make up my mind, but I think
the Communists are to blame. It's an obvious at
tempt to make "have-nots" out of some of us "have
littles," and it didn't take much. Of course, it could
also be a resurgent attempt of the Prohibitionists to
take their toll and to ruin the liquor industry by cut
ting the money circulation on campuses.
But now I see it clearly, quite clearly! It's Charles
"no soap"' Luckman who is at the bottom of all the
trouble. Luckman talks VA into holding back vets'
checks, which in turn cuts our income (completely?),
which in turn cuts the consumption of beverages,
which means less production and less use of wheat
and saves food for the needy of Europe!
Oh well, I guess we better quit our moaning, for
the VA is aiding the relief program. I'm a martyr!
This is a note of despair, pure unadulterated
despair!
I don't know how many are sharing this tragedy
with me, but I'm sure someone must. They can't
have picked on me alone—it isn't fair.
Things are getting so rough I can't even spare
a 3-eent stamp to write them a letter, so maybe
this will reach those villains on Fourth street in SF.
Yes, the Veterans Administration has snafued the
show again, and this time there'd better be a good
excuse. The last time those little green checks
from Uncle Sam were late everyone blamed Congress
for cutting appropriations. Can't be so this time,
Congress isn't even in special session yet, but Bull
Session is.
First of all, why all those innocent little post
cards that VA is sending us. The first in the current
series arrived about the first week of the month, and
said that all the papers were in order, but that
the checks would be held up till the 10th. Ok, fine,
but three days later another card gleefully announces
that the papers are still in order, but that the money
will be delayed an extra week.
And now I hear the third cards of the series are
starting to come in. Why add insult to injury! If
you don't wan't to send the checks, VA, don't! 2But
you don't have to rub it in. There can't be a short
age of personnel, or there wouldn't be enough help
to address and mail out all these notices to the vets.

There can't be a shortage of money in the country,
or Stanford would have closed down a long time ago.
So what I think really has happened is that the VA
has gone into cahoots with the loan sharks of the
Bay Area, and are splitting profits.
There are differences of opinion on whom to
blame this mess. The campus Democrats gleefully in
sinuate that if Congress hadn't cut down government
personnel so much, we would all have our little
checks by now, while the steadfast Republicans
maintain that if those in the VA now would do some
thing to earn their pay instead of playing around
with the postcards, all would be well.
