To the Editor:
To pursue the trend of thought advanced by Mr.
Rospaw in Wednesday's History column, develop
ments in the USSR itself during and since the war
have been such as to cause reasoning Americans to
have greater hopes for cooperation with that coun
try in the years to come. Having fought religion by
such devices as the substitution of a (i-day week (5
on, 1 ofT) so as to cause Sunday, with its religious
connotations, to be forgotten, in 1940 the 7-day week
was restored, with Sunday as the day of rest. In 1941-
1943 existing restrictions on religious organization
were removed so completely as to restore unhindered
freedom to all the churche. willing to act within
the framework df a single country. In an Associated
Press interview, July 31, 1940, Rev. L. D. Newton,
President of the conservative Southern Baptist Con
vention, stated from Moscow that "his personal
investigation in three major Russian cities has con
vinced him a member of his church can practice
his faith as openly in the Soviet Union as anywhere
in the world."
Roman Catholicism, which conceives of itself in
international terms of organization, is hindered in
that respect, but functions freely within the lands
comprising the USSR. Monsignor Reinis, Catholic
Archbishop of Vilna, reports that all 711 churches in
Lithuania are functioning, with 1332 priests. As
sumption service this year at the shrine of the Virgin
at Aglona, Latvia, which is held to have healing
powers, was attended by 120,000 persons. There are
31 Catholic monasteries and convents in the USSR,
including Jesuit, Franciscan, Salesian, Marian, Re
demptorist, Bernardine and Capuchin. The one
American Roman Catholic priest in Moscow, Father
George Antonio Laberge of Rhode Island, stated in
an Associated Press interview, March 17, 1947:
"I am allowed to go freely into houses and hos
pitals to minister to the sick. I preach freely the
Catholic doctrine without even the slightest degree of
interference. I was allowed four times within six
months to go to Leningrad and on three occasions
spent one week there with the avowed intention of
holding religious services in the French church."
In government, the Supreme Soviet ("Parliament"
or "Congress") adopted regulations for its Commit
tees on Legislation last February which specifically
state the right of minority report to the full House, for
the first time in the 30 years of the Soviet regime.
One of the first acts of these Committees (one in each

house) thereafter was to draft legislation specifying
the procedure for the exercise of the right of recall
by the electorate, provided in the 1936 Constitu
tion. In general, the translation into law of the pro
visions of that Constitution, which received much
praise abroad when it was adopted, has been re
sumed on a broad front, after a lapse caused by
preparation for defense against Germany and the war
itself.
Extra-constitutional measures adopted during the
war were dropped immediately upon its conclusion.
Chief among these was the abolition of the State
Committee of Defense (war cabinet), which existed
from July, 1941 to September, 1945, and had abso
lutely unrestricted powers. The complete abolition
of the death penalty last May (nor is life imprison
ment provided), the resumption of town meetings in
small communities, the re-entry of consumer crops
into the urban scene, and the resumption of union
contracts at the plant level, are other encouraging
developments.

To the Editor:
As if to top the recent series of letters on morality
and the Sunday evening series, a group of Speech
and Drama students are offering "Lysistrata," which
I can only describe as a classical Greek super sex
drama—proof positive that the Greeks had more
than words for it.
"Scarlet Street" and"The Garden of Allah" may
be bad in their way, but "Lysistrata" threatens to so
far overshadow these movie offerings that poor
Peter Stuteville will blush to the depths of his young
and tender soul.
Tomorrow evening "culture - loving" Stanford
students will neglect their pressing studies for rather
questionable entertainment at the Little Theater,
Memorial Auditorium.
They will be fared with a difficult ethical prob
lem. Does the antiquity of this play excuse the ob
vious licentiousness of its dialogue or the carnality
of its presentation? Whereas the movies trade in sex
for its own sake, can this classic be excused on the
pretext that it makes use of prurient lasciviousness
and lecherous salacity as a means of presenting an
underlying message of political satire so universal
that its applications are as valid today as in the times
of the ancient Greeks?

To pursue the trend of thought advanced by Mr.
Rospaw in Wednesday's History column, develop
ments in the USSR itself during and since the war
have been such as to cause reasoning Americans to
have greater hopes for cooperation with that coun
try in the years to come. Having fought religion by
such devices as the substitution of a (i-day week (5
on, 1 ofT) so as to cause Sunday, with its religious
connotations, to be forgotten, in 1940 the 7-day week
was restored, with Sunday as the day of rest. In 1941-
1943 existing restrictions on religious organization
were removed so completely as to restore unhindered
freedom to all the churche. willing to act within
the framework df a single country. In an Associated
Press interview, July 31, 1940, Rev. L. D. Newton,
President of the conservative Southern Baptist Con
vention, stated from Moscow that "his personal
investigation in three major Russian cities has con
vinced him a member of his church can practice
his faith as openly in the Soviet Union as anywhere
in the world."
Roman Catholicism, which conceives of itself in
international terms of organization, is hindered in
that respect, but functions freely within the lands
comprising the USSR. Monsignor Reinis, Catholic
Archbishop of Vilna, reports that all 711 churches in
Lithuania are functioning, with 1332 priests. As
sumption service this year at the shrine of the Virgin
at Aglona, Latvia, which is held to have healing
powers, was attended by 120,000 persons. There are
31 Catholic monasteries and convents in the USSR,
including Jesuit, Franciscan, Salesian, Marian, Re
demptorist, Bernardine and Capuchin. The one
American Roman Catholic priest in Moscow, Father
George Antonio Laberge of Rhode Island, stated in
an Associated Press interview, March 17, 1947:
"I am allowed to go freely into houses and hos
pitals to minister to the sick. I preach freely the
Catholic doctrine without even the slightest degree of
interference. I was allowed four times within six
months to go to Leningrad and on three occasions
spent one week there with the avowed intention of
holding religious services in the French church."
In government, the Supreme Soviet ("Parliament"
or "Congress") adopted regulations for its Commit
tees on Legislation last February which specifically
state the right of minority report to the full House, for
the first time in the 30 years of the Soviet regime.
One of the first acts of these Committees (one in each

house) thereafter was to draft legislation specifying
the procedure for the exercise of the right of recall
by the electorate, provided in the 1936 Constitu
tion. In general, the translation into law of the pro
visions of that Constitution, which received much
praise abroad when it was adopted, has been re
sumed on a broad front, after a lapse caused by
preparation for defense against Germany and the war
itself.
Extra-constitutional measures adopted during the
war were dropped immediately upon its conclusion.
Chief among these was the abolition of the State
Committee of Defense (war cabinet), which existed
from July, 1941 to September, 1945, and had abso
lutely unrestricted powers. The complete abolition
of the death penalty last May (nor is life imprison
ment provided), the resumption of town meetings in
small communities, the re-entry of consumer crops
into the urban scene, and the resumption of union
contracts at the plant level, are other encouraging
developments.

As if to top the recent series of letters on morality
and the Sunday evening series, a group of Speech
and Drama students are offering "Lysistrata," which
I can only describe as a classical Greek super sex
drama—proof positive that the Greeks had more
than words for it.
"Scarlet Street" and"The Garden of Allah" may
be bad in their way, but "Lysistrata" threatens to so
far overshadow these movie offerings that poor
Peter Stuteville will blush to the depths of his young
and tender soul.
Tomorrow evening "culture - loving" Stanford
students will neglect their pressing studies for rather
questionable entertainment at the Little Theater,
Memorial Auditorium.

drama—proof positive that the Greeks had more
than words for it.
"Scarlet Street" and"The Garden of Allah" may
be bad in their way, but "Lysistrata" threatens to so
far overshadow these movie offerings that poor
Peter Stuteville will blush to the depths of his young
and tender soul.
Tomorrow evening "culture - loving" Stanford
students will neglect their pressing studies for rather
questionable entertainment at the Little Theater,
Memorial Auditorium.
They will be fared with a difficult ethical prob
lem. Does the antiquity of this play excuse the ob
vious licentiousness of its dialogue or the carnality
of its presentation? Whereas the movies trade in sex
for its own sake, can this classic be excused on the
pretext that it makes use of prurient lasciviousness
and lecherous salacity as a means of presenting an
underlying message of political satire so universal
that its applications are as valid today as in the times
of the ancient Greeks?

To pursue the trend of thought advanced by Mr.
Rospaw in Wednesday's History column, develop
ments in the USSR itself during and since the war
have been such as to cause reasoning Americans to
have greater hopes for cooperation with that coun
try in the years to come. Having fought religion by
such devices as the substitution of a (i-day week (5
on, 1 ofT) so as to cause Sunday, with its religious
connotations, to be forgotten, in 1940 the 7-day week
was restored, with Sunday as the day of rest. In 1941-
1943 existing restrictions on religious organization
were removed so completely as to restore unhindered
freedom to all the churche. willing to act within
the framework df a single country. In an Associated
Press interview, July 31, 1940, Rev. L. D. Newton,
President of the conservative Southern Baptist Con
vention, stated from Moscow that "his personal
investigation in three major Russian cities has con
vinced him a member of his church can practice
his faith as openly in the Soviet Union as anywhere
in the world."
Roman Catholicism, which conceives of itself in
international terms of organization, is hindered in
that respect, but functions freely within the lands
comprising the USSR. Monsignor Reinis, Catholic
Archbishop of Vilna, reports that all 711 churches in
Lithuania are functioning, with 1332 priests. As
sumption service this year at the shrine of the Virgin
at Aglona, Latvia, which is held to have healing
powers, was attended by 120,000 persons. There are
31 Catholic monasteries and convents in the USSR,
including Jesuit, Franciscan, Salesian, Marian, Re
demptorist, Bernardine and Capuchin. The one
American Roman Catholic priest in Moscow, Father
George Antonio Laberge of Rhode Island, stated in
an Associated Press interview, March 17, 1947:
"I am allowed to go freely into houses and hos
pitals to minister to the sick. I preach freely the
Catholic doctrine without even the slightest degree of
interference. I was allowed four times within six
months to go to Leningrad and on three occasions
spent one week there with the avowed intention of
holding religious services in the French church."
In government, the Supreme Soviet ("Parliament"
or "Congress") adopted regulations for its Commit
tees on Legislation last February which specifically
state the right of minority report to the full House, for
the first time in the 30 years of the Soviet regime.
One of the first acts of these Committees (one in each

house) thereafter was to draft legislation specifying
the procedure for the exercise of the right of recall
by the electorate, provided in the 1936 Constitu
tion. In general, the translation into law of the pro
visions of that Constitution, which received much
praise abroad when it was adopted, has been re
sumed on a broad front, after a lapse caused by
preparation for defense against Germany and the war
itself.
Extra-constitutional measures adopted during the
war were dropped immediately upon its conclusion.
Chief among these was the abolition of the State
Committee of Defense (war cabinet), which existed
from July, 1941 to September, 1945, and had abso
lutely unrestricted powers. The complete abolition
of the death penalty last May (nor is life imprison
ment provided), the resumption of town meetings in
small communities, the re-entry of consumer crops
into the urban scene, and the resumption of union
contracts at the plant level, are other encouraging
developments.
