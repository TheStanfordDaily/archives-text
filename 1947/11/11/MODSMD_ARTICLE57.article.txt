# Redecorating Job Finished in Nitery
## 
### 
The ASSU made an appeal yes
terday for all students to keep the
redecorated Nitery clean.
At a total cost of more than $1,000
the floors have been sanded and re
finished, the walls repainted, the
furniture recovered, and various
accessories purchased, Jiggs Mc-
Caulley, acting student manager,
announced yesterday.
He urged all students using the j
Nitery to co-operate by putting
empty coke bottles in the racks
provided for them, paper cups in I
the trash cans, and cigarette butts j
in the ash trays, not on the floor.
He added that it is the duty of j
the students to keep the Nitery j
clean since it is their property.
An exhibit of photographs show- :
ing views of the student unions of
colleges and universities through
out America will be shown next
week in the main Union lobby, ac
cording to Miss Christine Ricker,
director of the Stanford Union.
Miss Ricker expressed a desire to j
see as many students as possible j
view the exhibit and offer sugges- I
tions for possible improvement of j
Stanford's Student Union.
The pictures are the property of ,
the Association of Student Unions. I
