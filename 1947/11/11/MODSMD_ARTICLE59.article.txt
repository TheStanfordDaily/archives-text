Wc love our competitors, but Art
seemed so hungry, that we print the
following for his sake only.
Some may go to Dinah
But for me there's someplace finah;
Some may go to L'Ommy
But that upsets my tommy;
Some may go to Rickey,
But Rickey is strictly icky;
For those who really give a darn
The choice is always LONGBARN!!

If you get her a lock-out, chum

Or a red cur-san-thuh-mum
Send her candy made by BLUM
Yum! Yum!
