Wc love our competitors, but Art
seemed so hungry, that we print the
following for his sake only.
Some may go to Dinah
But for me there's someplace finah;
Some may go to L'Ommy
But that upsets my tommy;
Some may go to Rickey,
But Rickey is strictly icky;
For those who really give a darn
The choice is always LONGBARN!!
—Art Lubic
Willie is going to throw me out of
the business after printing the
above.—Ed.

If you get her a lock-out, chum
Do not send a stick of gum
Or a red cur-san-thuh-mum
Send her candy made by BLUM
Yum! Yum!
—Lee Zeigler

C'mon gang, there's been plenty of
you getting 20% taken off your
dinner check, and we'd like to see
more of you in here saving a little
money. The waitress does the hon
ors.
