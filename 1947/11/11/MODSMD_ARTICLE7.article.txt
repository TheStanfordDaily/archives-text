# Fraternity Open Houses This Week
## 
### 
Non-fraternity men will get a
look at Farm fraternity life tonight
from 7 to 9 when Stanford's 24 fra
ternities hold open house, said Pete
August, president of Interfraternity
Council. A second open house ses
sion will be held Thursday from 7

The idea behind the autumn
quarter open houses is to give all
non-fraternity men, especially the
freshmen, a chance to view frater
nity life so they can "think it over"
during Chistmas vacation. "They
will then know whether they want
to go through rushing during win
ter quarter," explained August.

This is not part of rushing, he
emphasized, but is merely an intro

Non-fraternity men will get a
look at Farm fraternity life tonight
from 7 to 9 when Stanford's 24 fra
ternities hold open house, said Pete
August, president of Interfraternity
Council. A second open house ses
sion will be held Thursday from 7
to 8:30 p.m., and a third on Nov. 25.

quarter open houses is to give all
non-fraternity men, especially the
freshmen, a chance to view frater
nity life so they can "think it over"
during Chistmas vacation. "They
will then know whether they want
to go through rushing during win
ter quarter," explained August.
