LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. 11
(UP). —The Soviet bloc today began
a hard-hitting campaign for eco
nomic and political sanctions
against Franco Spain, but the Unit
ed States immediately objected that
any action might rally support for
the Spanish dictatorship.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko,
backed by Slav states and some
Latin American nations, demanded
that UN members ask the Security
Council to consider further action
against Franco. The Council would
have authority to order all UN
members to end diplomatic and
commercial relations with Spain.
Charles Fahy of the United
States, however, warned that such
action "would strengthen the Fran
co regime." and not bring about
"the results that we all desire—a
peaceful replacement of the Franco

regime by a government responsible
to the people."
"The Spanish people in their own
time and in their own way must
restore Spain to her historic posi
tion in the family of nations," said
Fahy.
