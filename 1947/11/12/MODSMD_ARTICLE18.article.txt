# Fraternities Open Doors To Rushees
## 
### 
Freshmen and other non-frater
nity men started their rounds of the
Farm's 24 fraternities last night in
the first open house session of the
newly inaugurated introductory pe
riod, said Pete August, Interfrater
nity Council president.
The majority of men started at
Upper Row this year and were
working their way down when 9
p.m. closed in. Fraternities again
open their doors on Thursday, when
men may complete their route from
7 to 8:30 p.m.
Upper Row houses boasted as
many as 100 visitors during the
evening, while Lower Row was
pushing an average of 50.
LESS THAN EXPECTED
Compared with the number of
freshmen (some 500 live at Encina),
the total was not as large as ex
pected. This "lag," August ex
plained, might be due to the fact
that freshman midquarters are now
going on.
The open house session this quar
ter was initiated by the fraternities
as purely an introductory function,
said August. It is not part of rush
ing, but merely serves to give the
non-fraternity man "something to
think about" over the Christmas
vacation. A third all-fraternity open
house session will be held Nov. 25.
Mimeographed rushing rules have
been distributed to Encina, Toyon,
Village, and fraternity houses, Au
gust said. The formal rushing pe
riod will begin with the first open
house of winter quarter.
URGED TO ATTEND
Under council rules, incoming
freshmen may not be rushed until
this open house, Jan. 8. Men with
less than 90 units, other than in
coming freshmen, may not be
rushed until they complete one
quarter at Stanford. Transfers with
90 units or more may be rushed at
any time.
No fraternity man shall enter En
cina or any other freshman hall ex
cept with the permission of a spon
sor not of his own house, August
continued. Freshmen must keep
out of fraternity houses except dur
ing open house or rushing periods.
All non-fraternity men are thus
urged to attend the open houses on
Thursday and on Tuesday, Nov. 25.
Men should try to visit all houses,
and limit visits to 20 minutes.
