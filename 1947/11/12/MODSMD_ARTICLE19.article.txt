# Village Men Devise Way to Stop Noise
## 
### 
A sure cure for people who come
in late, make noise, and turn on
lights was devised by the men of
Village 2068 last week. A habitual
late-comer came in to find his bunk
looking like a float in a parade.
His shirts, socks, shorts, and other
articles of clothing were on the
lower mattress of his double bunk.
The mattress was lifted and tied to
the bottom of the top bunk with
manila rope. Beneath this were his
golf clubs.
On the bare springs were strewn
books and papers, and his remain
ing possessions were on the top
bunk along with a chair, a trash
basket, and a bearded dummy made
of a hat, towel, and cotton. The
whole bed was blanketed with a
coat of trash-basket confetti.
