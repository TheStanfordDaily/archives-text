Tickets for the Big Game Gaieties

The Gaieties will be performed
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday,

are 8:15 Wednesday night and 9:15
Thursday and Friday nights in or
der to allow students to attend other
Big Game activities.
There will be no matinee this
year, Baker said.
"Many alumni have already writ
ten in for tickets, and we are antici
pating requests from many more,
since the Homecoming has been
combined with this year's Big Game
activities," he stated.
Because of the returning alumni
and the increased student body, a
three - night sell - out is expected,
Baker said. Better seats will prob
ably be available for Wednesday
and Thursday nights, he added,
urging all students who can to at
tend one of these performances in
stead of the Friday show.
"Theme of the Gaieties this year
is 'That's Life," George Eckstein,
director, said. "We are taking off
Life magazine," he stated.
