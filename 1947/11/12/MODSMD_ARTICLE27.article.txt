# Boys' Town Choir Represents Musical Ideal Brought to Being by Famed Father Flanagan
## 
### JERRY DANIELLS 
| The 40 citizens of famous Boys'
i Town, Nebraska, who will appear
I here tomorrow night represent mu
sically an ideal brought to being al
most three decades ago by the Right !
Reverend Monsignor E. J. Flana- j
nan, beloved throughout the world j
as Father Flanagan.
1 However, five years ago Father j
Flunagan placed Father Francis I

Schmitt in charge of the choir,
which at thnt time was a creditable,
home-singing group of 35 vocalists.
Under his guidance the choir has
grown to 100 voices, from which it
is his problem to select 40 for the
concert choir.
VOICES CHANGING
In addition to selecting the best
individual voices and being suie
they will blend best with each oth

| cr, Father Schmitt has other stand
i aids to satisfy. He very fairly gives
precedence to seniority in the choir,
! and the boy who has worked faith
fully with the group over a long pe
i riod is considered ahead of the nov
ice. A boy must have satisfactory
I grades. Also there is the problem of
' voice changing.
The boys practice an hour a day
and sing three times a week at
J services in the Dowd Memorial
1 Chapel at Boys' Town. Three times
a year the choir gives a concert. It
j was the excellence of these latter
performances — the Sacred Concert
on Easter Sunday, the Summer
"Pop" Concert, and the Twelfth
Night Concert during the Christmas
' holidays — which inspired music-
I loving outsiders to demand more
' Boys' Town music.
TOUR COUNTRY
Last year the choir toured
throughout the East and Mid-West
j enthralling over 90,000 listeners in
17 cities, 18 states, and the District
iof Columbia. Because last year's
tour was such a success, the choir
this year will entertain the West
and West Coast, appearing at the
Memorial Auditorium tomorrow
night at 8:15.
"Tickets for the Boys' Town Choir
program which will open the 1947
Stanford Concert Series are still
available," announced Barbara iAt
ken, series manager. They may be
purchased from 1 to 5 in the Nitery.

TOUR COUNTRY

throughout the East and Mid-West

"Tickets for the Boys' Town Choir
program which will open the 1947
Stanford Concert Series are still

concert choir.
