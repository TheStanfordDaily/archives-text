# Lagunita Excom Pushes Song Fest
## 
### 
Led by Mary Ellen Harding,
Lagunita excom and standing com
mittee members, clad in jeans and
plaid shirts, shuffled into the din
ing room last night and presented
the song "Lagunita Joy-House" to
the music of "Chattanooga Choo-
Choo."
The purpose of the performance
was to arouse interest in the song
contest now under way at Lagu
nita. Each casa is to present one or
more songs to be judged, and one
prize will be awarded at a Song
Fest on Dec. 2.
The girls created quite a sensa
tion in the dining room with their
colorful attire, and received loud
applause from the other tables.
