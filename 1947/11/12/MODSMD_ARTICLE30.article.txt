## 
### 
Chief of Police Gordon Davis
warns cyclists that since it is getting
dark earlier now, the danger of bi
cycling is increasing. If you must
ride a bicycle at night, use a tail
light, but by all means stay well to
the side of the road. A tail-light is
highly essential, because it is diffi
cult for a motorist to see a cyclist
at night, particularly when a car
coming toward him does not dim its
headlights.
