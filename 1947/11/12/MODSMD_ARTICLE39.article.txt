# 'Plenty of Room' Makes Gay, Humorous Revue
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Imbued with a vein of puckish merriment and freshness,
"Plenty of Room," a Straw Hat Theater intimate musical comedy
revue continues to amuse the patrons along the Golden Gate
Avenue strip in San Francisco.
It is, by all means, the gayest splash of buoyant entertainment j

to strike the Boy City in years Hard- |
working novices from the Univer
sity of California and other Bay
Area campuses fill out a two-hour
bill of fare singing, dancing, and
poking unpretentious fun at the
world.
BEST SONGS
Using the best songs and skits of '
previous., plays enacted out Lafa
yette way, "Plenty of Room" ably
manages to place a satirical chapeau
on the contemporary scene.
There is a skit called "News of
the Week of the World," in which
the newsreel film holdings receipt
for a goodnatured lampooning. Gor
don Connell, an amiable youth with
a yen for clever mimicry, does no
tably well as "a garrulous Senator
who just can't take an exit hint for I
the asking."
VOCAL MIMICS
A pair of vocally pliant perform- |
ers, Carole Brumm and Maurice
Engleman, do a number called
"Foreign Movie." Abetted by stage :
props and a smattering of foreign 1
phrases, the skit veritably jerks the !
foreign moviemakers' set from their
bootstraps. The pair do a takeoff
purportedly drawn upon Jean Ca
bin and Annabella.
Part of the cast, sporting a Pinole
Mixed Choral Society tag and look- !
ing like a Borah Minnevitch aggre
gation minus the harmonicas, ren
der "Music from the Dead Masters" j
in sporadic flashes of harmonizing
genius. Elizabeth Berryhill, who
serves double duty as director-ac- j
tress, does an exacting chore as the j
hands-Waving choral director.
YOUTHFUL TALENT
The revue hinges its success on
marrying youthful sure-fire tenaci- !
ty to a kind of bubbling subtlety.
Theater-goers will profit by seeing
"Plenty of Room."
There may be no room for a new |
type of straw hat entertainment cir
cuit iri Northern California. But
one feels reasonably certain that '
there is no scarcity of talent, youth,
and determination. Let vis hasten to j
add that, for the likes of the above. |
"there's plenty of room!"
