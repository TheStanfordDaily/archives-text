# Unbeaten Frosh Challenge Jayvee Grid Crew Today
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford's unbeaten freshman team will lay their record on
the line today at 4 p.m. when they take on Jim Cox's junior
varsity in what may well turn out to be the most exciting foot
ball game played on the Farm this season.
The contest, which will be a "post season" affair for the

yearlings, will take place on the*
JV practice field, located between
the sunken diamond and the cor
poration yard.
SIXTH ON FROSH SLATE
It will be the sixth game for the
frosh, who boast a four win and one
tie record, and the second for the j
junior varsity. Although classified I
as a practice tilt, the game will be
played complete with yard sticks '
and kickofTs.
As far as the coaching staffs of the
two squads are concerned, the game !
is a toss up, neither mentor being |
willing to predict a victory for his j
team.
Chuck Taylor's frosh will enter the j
contest riding high off a 33 to 27 vie- j
tory over California Saturday. In j
addition to the Bear win, the year- j
lings boast victories over San Jose j
State, Santa Clara, and Southern |
California elevens with only a 14 to I
14 tie with UCLA to mar an other- i
wise perfect record.
Taylor reports that his squad will
be at full strength with the excep
tion of left guard Harry Hunt, who
is sidelined with an injury.
FIRST JAYVEE TEST
The showing will be the first real
contest for the junior varsity lads
who have played only one game, a
tilt that they won easily from a
Fort Ord team by a score of 71 to 0. |
Although the jayvees have had
little actual game playing, they have
served as foils for the varsity in
practice scrimmages and have more
than once given the senior second
and third strings a hard fought bat
tle. In an informal scrum at the be
ginning of the season, the JV's
downed the frosh in a close contest, j

Stanford's unbeaten freshman team will lay their record on
the line today at 4 p.m. when they take on Jim Cox's junior
varsity in what may well turn out to be the most exciting foot
ball game played on the Farm this season.
The contest, which will be a "post season" affair for the

yearlings, will take place on the*
JV practice field, located between
the sunken diamond and the cor
poration yard.
SIXTH ON FROSH SLATE
It will be the sixth game for the
frosh, who boast a four win and one
tie record, and the second for the j
junior varsity. Although classified I
as a practice tilt, the game will be
played complete with yard sticks '
and kickofTs.
As far as the coaching staffs of the
two squads are concerned, the game !
is a toss up, neither mentor being |
willing to predict a victory for his j
team.
Chuck Taylor's frosh will enter the j
contest riding high off a 33 to 27 vie- j
tory over California Saturday. In j
addition to the Bear win, the year- j
lings boast victories over San Jose j
State, Santa Clara, and Southern |
California elevens with only a 14 to I
14 tie with UCLA to mar an other- i
wise perfect record.
Taylor reports that his squad will
be at full strength with the excep
tion of left guard Harry Hunt, who
is sidelined with an injury.
FIRST JAYVEE TEST
The showing will be the first real
contest for the junior varsity lads
who have played only one game, a
tilt that they won easily from a
Fort Ord team by a score of 71 to 0. |
Although the jayvees have had
little actual game playing, they have
served as foils for the varsity in
practice scrimmages and have more
than once given the senior second
and third strings a hard fought bat
tle. In an informal scrum at the be
ginning of the season, the JV's
downed the frosh in a close contest, j
