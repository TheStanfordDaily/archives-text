# Xmas Early—Varsity Crew Shells Arrive
## 
### BILL BETHKE 
■ Stanford's crew got its long await
ed present Monday afternoon when
a pair of glistening new shells ar
rived from the Seattle workshop of
George Pocock, master craftsman of
the rowing sport. The shells, which
were donated anonymously last year,
are the first new equipment the
crew has owned since its revival a
year ago.
The new boats, gleaming under
their clear shellac finish, were un
loaded from a special express car
at the Southern Pacific station on
Monday by half a hundred eager
and admiring oarsmen.
SLIM AND TRIM CRAFT
All of 62 feet long but only two
and-a-half feet wide and weighing
a slight 300 pounds, the duct pre
sented a transportation headache.
The problem was finally solved when
a flatbed semi-trailer was secured.
It was a two mile struggle with low
trees and sharp corners on the way
to the club's boathouse, but the
shells finally arrived unscathed.
Made of laminated plywood the
boats are lighter as well as stronger
than existing types of shells. The
new construction eliminates many
strengthening ribs while the lamina
tion retains the sturdiness of the
frame. In addition a new type of
rigger or oar-holding device has been
employed to give the oarsmen
greater control in rough water.
VARSITY LAUNCHES NEW BABY
Three of the crew's old shells have
been in the water this week and to
morrow one of the new craft will
be launched for the use of the var
sity eight.
The four will be divided between
the varsity and jayvee squads and
the 50 frosh. The shortage of row
ing spots for each man remains, for
there are still not enough shells or
oars to boat everyone.
