### 
Although X-rays revealed that Marty Anderson's elbow was
not chipped in last week's USC fray, Coach Marchie Schwartz
and his staff are not yet certain if the services of Dan Mervin or
Whit Budge will be available this Saturday,
Mervin, who has turned in some fine work at his end position

for the Cards this year, did not ♦
suit up for last night's practice be
cause of a knee injury. Budge, a
hero in the Trojan game, missed
practice with a cold and fever but
is expected to be ready for the Ore
gon tilt this weekend.
Mickey Titus was kept out of the
USC game due to a reinjury of his
knee but it is possible that the
spirited back will see action in the
Big Game.
Coach Schwartz continued to
stress offense this week in prepara- j
tion for the bettle with the power
laden Webfeet, although he plans
to work in some defensive drills
later this week.
In the hope of uncovering some
new front line material, Schwartz
sent his third-string men against
the junior varsity in a scrimmage
yesterday.
