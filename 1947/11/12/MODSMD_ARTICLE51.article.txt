# Where the Naples Money Went
## 
### 
A month ago Molly Shaw, co-chairman of
SIRO, said that last spring money had been
appropriated for Stanford's adoption of the
University of Naples, but that the University
had never received any of it.
That night Excom rectified matters by prom
ising 30 percent of the proceeds from the pres
ent Relief Fund Drive to the University of
Naples. The question of just where the money
appropriated last spring went was passed over.
In order to clear up any doubts in your mind,
or reluctance on your part to give more money
until you know where the rest went, this is an
explanation to the student body, based on a
statement from Miss Shaw and Bill Dirker, co
chairmen of SIRO.
5350 was appropriated to Naples last spring
to act as stop-gap aid until proceeds from the
fall relief drive were available. It was then
decided to delay spending the money until a
more accurate report of needs was sent back
by Stanford representatives in Europe, partic
ularly Miss Shaw, who visited Naples this
summer and conferred with student leaders
there.

Meanwhile during the summer the mailing
budget for clothing packages to Europe was
exhausted and this $350 was transferred to the
budget rather than let the clothes remain here.
At the beginning of this quarter an $800
mailing budget became effective and the or
iginally appropriated $350 was taken out of
this and used for the University of Naples in
two ways.
Confirmation of an order for 18 CARE pack
ages for Naples was received Sunday by SIRO.
These packages, 13 food, 4 blanket, and 1
woolen, were consigned to Alfred Cappozzi,
Naples student body president. This accounts
for $180 of the $350 appropriated for direct
relief last spring.
The remaining $170 will be spent on at least
one mimeograph machine and mimeograph
supplies. The machine is now being repaired,
and free passage to Italy for it has been ar
ranged. The necessary documents are being
prepared free by a San Francisco firm. If the
project proves inexpensive two machines will
be sent; otherwise the balance will be used for
CARE packages.—M.H.

Naples. The question of just where the money
appropriated last spring went was passed over.
In order to clear up any doubts in your mind,
or reluctance on your part to give more money
until you know where the rest went, this is an
explanation to the student body, based on a
statement from Miss Shaw and Bill Dirker, co
chairmen of SIRO.
5350 was appropriated to Naples last spring
to act as stop-gap aid until proceeds from the
fall relief drive were available. It was then
decided to delay spending the money until a
more accurate report of needs was sent back
by Stanford representatives in Europe, partic
ularly Miss Shaw, who visited Naples this
summer and conferred with student leaders
there.

Meanwhile during the summer the mailing
budget for clothing packages to Europe was
exhausted and this $350 was transferred to the
budget rather than let the clothes remain here.
At the beginning of this quarter an $800
mailing budget became effective and the or
iginally appropriated $350 was taken out of
this and used for the University of Naples in
two ways.
Confirmation of an order for 18 CARE pack
ages for Naples was received Sunday by SIRO.
These packages, 13 food, 4 blanket, and 1
woolen, were consigned to Alfred Cappozzi,
Naples student body president. This accounts
for $180 of the $350 appropriated for direct
relief last spring.
The remaining $170 will be spent on at least
one mimeograph machine and mimeograph
supplies. The machine is now being repaired,
and free passage to Italy for it has been ar
ranged. The necessary documents are being
prepared free by a San Francisco firm. If the
project proves inexpensive two machines will
be sent; otherwise the balance will be used for
CARE packages.—M.H.
