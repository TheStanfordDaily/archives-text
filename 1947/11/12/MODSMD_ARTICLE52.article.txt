Newspapers and their reporting are a very touchy
subject. When a reporter starts reporting carelessly
or without proper background of the "story"' this
subject becomes dangerous.
In most democratic countries, freedom of the press
is recognized; but the two elements that must go
along with this freedom are ignored. These two
elements are: an intelligent, enlightened, and edu
cated public; and, intelligent, enlightened, and free
newspapermen.
Whenever newspapers start distorting news, the
community as a whole suffers. In order to guard
against a deliberate or negligent misrepresentation of
any news, all countries have libel laws. Any person
can sue a newspaper in court if he feels that his
reputation has been willfully injured.
Another check on newspapers when they write
about affairs nearer home is that the readers under
stand those affairs better and too much distortion
might make the newspaper unpopular.
None of these checks apply when it comes to
reporting international events and the conditions and
affairs of foreign countries. Coupled with the fact
that usually foreign correspondents don't know
enough about the background of the countries they
are reporting, and the readers don't care to spend
too much time studying this background, it results
in pretty bad and damaging reporting of foreign
countries.
A very recent case of such reporting is the way
news stories have been handling the Sikhs and their
part in the Indian riots. In order to make an "easier"
reading story, a special and non-existent statue of a
Sikh has been formed in the minds of newspaper
reading Americans.
Sikhs have been represented as a tall, huge per
son with a flowing beard who starts to wave a
sabre above his head as soon as he sees a Moslem.
Sikhs have also been blamed for the riots inainly.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Having
lived with Sikhs all my life, I can talk with a cer
tain amount of authority. There are tall and huge
Sikhs, that is true, but there are a lot of short and
thin ones too. If the American correspondents had
decided to go a bit deeper into the history and class
structure of Punjab, they would have found that Cen
tral and Western Punjab is inhabited by peasants
known as Jats. There are Sikh Jats, Moslem Jats,
and Hindu Jats. The tough and ferocious qualities
apply, as far as such qualities can truthfully apply, to
Jats and not particularly to any community.
Now it happens that more than half of Sikhs
belong to this class, but there are an equal number
of Moslem Jats and quite a few Hindu Jats. Some
leaders of all the three communities have behaved
badly in recent days, but strangely we have been
reading the provocating statements of Sikh leaders
only.
To put the blame on Sikhs for starting the bloody
riots is even more sensational and misleading journal
ism. Again, all the three communities are to be
blamed to some extent; but, if the blame has to be
put on somebody, they, in my opinion, are least to
be blamed. After all they didn't start dividing the
country on a religious basis.
The case of the Sikhs is only one of the many
examples which make the case for some sort of check
on foreign reporting a bit stronger. The article on
India in the Oct. 27 issue of "Time" is another. I am
not suggesting censorship, but the problem is really
serious. It is so serious that the United Nations Edu
cation Scientific and Cultural Organization has had
it on its agenda for more than a year. But as long
as the solution is not found, we can help by refusing
to digest the oversimplified news story and by de
manding a higher level of stories from our news
papers. Meanwhile I can assure Stanford students
that Sikhs are people, just like other Indians living
in the Punjab.

that Sikhs are people, just like other Indians living
in the Punjab.
Newspapers and their reporting are a very touchy
subject. When a reporter starts reporting carelessly
or without proper background of the "story"' this
subject becomes dangerous.
In most democratic countries, freedom of the press
is recognized; but the two elements that must go
along with this freedom are ignored. These two
elements are: an intelligent, enlightened, and edu
cated public; and, intelligent, enlightened, and free
newspapermen.
Whenever newspapers start distorting news, the
community as a whole suffers. In order to guard
against a deliberate or negligent misrepresentation of
any news, all countries have libel laws. Any person
can sue a newspaper in court if he feels that his
reputation has been willfully injured.
Another check on newspapers when they write
about affairs nearer home is that the readers under
stand those affairs better and too much distortion
might make the newspaper unpopular.
None of these checks apply when it comes to
reporting international events and the conditions and
affairs of foreign countries. Coupled with the fact
that usually foreign correspondents don't know
enough about the background of the countries they
are reporting, and the readers don't care to spend
too much time studying this background, it results
in pretty bad and damaging reporting of foreign
countries.
A very recent case of such reporting is the way
news stories have been handling the Sikhs and their
part in the Indian riots. In order to make an "easier"
reading story, a special and non-existent statue of a
Sikh has been formed in the minds of newspaper
reading Americans.
Sikhs have been represented as a tall, huge per
son with a flowing beard who starts to wave a
sabre above his head as soon as he sees a Moslem.
Sikhs have also been blamed for the riots inainly.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Having
lived with Sikhs all my life, I can talk with a cer
tain amount of authority. There are tall and huge
Sikhs, that is true, but there are a lot of short and
thin ones too. If the American correspondents had
decided to go a bit deeper into the history and class
structure of Punjab, they would have found that Cen
tral and Western Punjab is inhabited by peasants
known as Jats. There are Sikh Jats, Moslem Jats,
and Hindu Jats. The tough and ferocious qualities
apply, as far as such qualities can truthfully apply, to
Jats and not particularly to any community.
Now it happens that more than half of Sikhs
belong to this class, but there are an equal number
of Moslem Jats and quite a few Hindu Jats. Some
leaders of all the three communities have behaved
badly in recent days, but strangely we have been
reading the provocating statements of Sikh leaders
only.
To put the blame on Sikhs for starting the bloody
riots is even more sensational and misleading journal
ism. Again, all the three communities are to be
blamed to some extent; but, if the blame has to be
put on somebody, they, in my opinion, are least to
be blamed. After all they didn't start dividing the
country on a religious basis.
The case of the Sikhs is only one of the many
examples which make the case for some sort of check
on foreign reporting a bit stronger. The article on
India in the Oct. 27 issue of "Time" is another. I am
not suggesting censorship, but the problem is really
serious. It is so serious that the United Nations Edu
cation Scientific and Cultural Organization has had
it on its agenda for more than a year. But as long
as the solution is not found, we can help by refusing
to digest the oversimplified news story and by de
manding a higher level of stories from our news
papers. Meanwhile I can assure Stanford students
that Sikhs are people, just like other Indians living
in the Punjab.
