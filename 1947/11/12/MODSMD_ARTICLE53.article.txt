To the Editor:
There is too much of a tendency, seen both in in
structors and in students, to speak lightly and glibly
of "World War Three" as if it were a foregone con
clusion that there will be one. It is not so. Wars are
not like spring and fall, the seasons, the rain, and
the turning of the earth on its axis—things which
go right ahead and happen whether we like them or
not. No. Wars are made by men and women, and
men and women can prevent wars.
True, world conditions are There is hunger,
there is unrest, there are sporadic outbreaks of vio
lence, and two great countries—United States and
Russia —eye each other with suspicion and distrust.
Extremists in both countries make inflammatory
speeches and give fuel to the smoldering fire of
distrust.
But there is still time to put out that fire. It does
not have to grow into a world conflagration. There
are plenty of level-headed people in both countries—
I do not believe that the extremists are typical in
either country. People who have good sense do not
want another world war; they realize that we have
hardly begun to clean up the wreckage from the last
one. And if we think the world is in sad shape now—
famines abroad, housing shortage at home, no de
livery on that new car until nobody knows when,
ninety dollars subsistence not going very far in the
face of mounting living costs—it is only a small cir
cumstance compared to the super-sad shape we would
be in after another world war.
World War Three is not inevitable. It will not
happen unless men and women are stupid enough
or careless enough to make it happen. Instead of re
signing ourselves to the prospect of another world
war, we should be using the best brain cells we pos
sess to figure out. formulate, and put into action a
world-wide policy which will effectively prevent
another world war. This must include feeding
hungry peoples and better still, helping them to
feed themselves. This is a large order. It will not
be easy, it will take a lot of doing, but it can be done*.

To the Editor:
I regret to note that Mr. David M. Kirk (Monday's
Campus Opinion) is made "unhappy and upset" by
the "Red" article of Mr. Rospaw's (under History
1947, Wed., Nov. sth). Everything but the ads and
the weather report should be removed so Mr. Kirk's
brain won't be taxed before he commences his
studies.
It is difficult, to see just what Mr. Kirk has to
say when his verbiage is cleared away. His main

points seem to be "1) that Fascism WAS the irrational
organization of confusion, and 2) that Sovietism IS a
political integration of the urge of the Russian pro
letariat to dominate the world for its own benefit,'
and these dictums sound more like Karl Marx than
any of Mr. Rospaw's statements. Moreover, it is
underestimating Fascism to blandly dismiss it as an
"irrational organization of confusion;'' while it is'
unrealistic to claim that the average Russian worker
is possessed "of the urge ... to dominate the
world . . ."
I believe that Mr. Kirk failed to get the gist
of Mr. Rospaw's remarks, no doubt owing to his
"seeing red." Mr. Rospaw was merely objecting to
the "religion of conformity" now sweeping the na
tion. and to the "moulded thinking" of the Hearsts
and McCormicks, whose "beware of the Red Menace"
bed-time stories no doubt are more soothing to Mr.
Kirk's frayed nerves.

To the Editor:
On conversing with Stanford "Roughs'" of late, I
have noted an increasing tendency of constant ob
jection to the physical attributes of the feminine
members of our great Stanford family. Such objec
tions I find highly discommendable.
Upon what dogmatic precepts are these illaud
able disapprobations based? Could it be that our
roughs are trying to draw a comparison between our
healthy, robust coeds and the undernourished,
pseudo-glamour girls of Hollywood? Don't be mis
led, roughs! True, our girls might not meet the
Hollywood standards of beauty, but if you should
pause to reflect a moment before saying "There goes
another sebaceous "pig'.'' you would discover they
have a wholesome beauty and exuberance character
istic only to Stanford and unknown to Hollywood.
Also try to bear in mind before making any further
outspoken judgements of our coeds that we re not
perfect ourselves, fellows.

To the Editor:
Since Mr. Truman has instituted a program of
food conservation, a problem has arisen. A friend of
mine has a duck-billed platypus which he hopes to
serve for dinner in the near future.
Inasmuch as this strange animal is fur-bearing,
lays eggs, and suckles its young, could you inform him
as to what day of the week it could be eaten without
offending the Piesidont?
