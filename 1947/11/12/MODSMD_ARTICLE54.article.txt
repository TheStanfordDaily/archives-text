# Hardships Fail to Hold Back Stanford Mountain Climbers
## 
### 
Severe hardships failed to stop three Stanford climbers — one of
them a girl—and a member of the Sierra Club during a climb in Yoseinite
over the last weekend.
The climbers went almost a day and one-half without food or water
in going the "direct route" on Washington Column, 2,000 vertical

feet of unusually long and difficult-<
climbing pitches. An idea of the
difficulty of the climb can be
formed by a comparison of Wash
ington Column with the Hoover
Tower. Washington Column is about
nine times as high, and almost as
steep. Once they started up, the
Alpiners refused to turn back, al
though the lack of water was pain
ful.
The only place that the climbers
could find to park overnight on the
sheer face of the column was a
ledge about the size of a living
room sofa, about two-thirds of the
way to the top. There Dave Harrah,
Freddy Hubbard, and Ulf Ramm-
Ericson, all of the Stanford Alpine
Club, and Jack Arnold of the Sierra
Club huddled for warmth during
the 13 hours of darkness. They had
no sleeping bags or extra clothing.
Miss Hubbard is the first woman
to accomplish the climb.
Food difficulty was attributed by
Ramm-Ericson to the lack of water.
With no water it was impossible to
chew the food brought along. Ra
tions for Saturday night were a
sardine and one-quarter per climb
er, he said.
