# Series Holds A-Bomb Panel
## 
### 
The main problems in the control
of atomic energy are not technical
ones, but those involving the politi
cal differences beteen Russia and
the United States.
All four members of the panel
discussion group which met last
night in Memorial Auditorium to
discuss "The Social and Political
Implications of Atomic Develop
ment" were in agreement on this
point. The belated development of
effective plans for the control of
atomic energy, they declared, is a
result of divided international goals
and conflicting ideologies.
PANEL MEMBERS
Members of the panel, besides
moderator Dr. Harold R. Fisher,
were Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, Dr.
William Walter Greulich, Dr. Leon
ard I. Schiff, members of the fac
ulty; and John Parks Davis, a San
Francisco attorney.
Russia must somehow be made to
understand, they said, that she must
give up her sovereignty to the ex
tent that the world as a whole will
have complete jurisdiction over the
atom bomb.
There are many vital points in the
Baruch or Majority Plan, stated Mr.
Davis, which will make it a real
preventative measure against an
atom war and not merely another
treaty. So far, he said, the Russians
refuse to accept these proposals and
are thus delaying the world's ef
forts to stave off an atom war.
BOMB NO SECRET
Other declarations made by the
four members of the panel:
1. The atom bomb is no secret.
Russian scientists, said Dr. Schiff,
made basic contributions to the dis
covery of the atomic energy secrets,
and there is no reason to suppose
that they are not capable of pro
ducing the bomb.
2. Many Americans erroneously
believe that military defense against
the bomb can still be expected.
There is no defense now, Dr. Schiff
stated, and no reason to expect that
there will be such a defense.
3. The matter of atomic control
plans should be carried into the
General Assembly of the United
Nations, according to Dr. Rothwell,
in order to marshall an internation
al plan for atomic control.
4. Congress still feels, said Dr.
Rothwell, that atom bomb plans
should remain in civilian control
with military assistance.
BARUCH PLAN
5. As matters now stand, the
United Nations vote would probab
ly be 43-6 in favor of the Baruch
or Majority Plan, said Mr. Davis.
6. It is the Americans and not
the Russians who would suffer the
most in an atomic war. Dr. Greu
lich declared, because of the con
centration of our population in
great cities.
Dr. Fisher concluded the panel by
stating that prevention of the de
velopment of destructive atomic en
ergy is the first step toward outlaw
ing war.

Nations, according to Dr. Rothwell,
in order to marshall an internation
al plan for atomic control.
4. Congress still feels, said Dr.
Rothwell, that atom bomb plans
should remain in civilian control
with military assistance.
BARUCH PLAN
5. As matters now stand, the
United Nations vote would probab
ly be 43-6 in favor of the Baruch
or Majority Plan, said Mr. Davis.
6. It is the Americans and not
the Russians who would suffer the
most in an atomic war. Dr. Greu
lich declared, because of the con
centration of our population in
great cities.
Dr. Fisher concluded the panel by
stating that prevention of the de
velopment of destructive atomic en
ergy is the first step toward outlaw
ing war.
The main problems in the control
of atomic energy are not technical
ones, but those involving the politi
cal differences beteen Russia and
the United States.
All four members of the panel
discussion group which met last
night in Memorial Auditorium to
discuss "The Social and Political
Implications of Atomic Develop
ment" were in agreement on this
point. The belated development of
effective plans for the control of
atomic energy, they declared, is a
result of divided international goals
and conflicting ideologies.
PANEL MEMBERS
Members of the panel, besides
moderator Dr. Harold R. Fisher,
were Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, Dr.
William Walter Greulich, Dr. Leon
ard I. Schiff, members of the fac
ulty; and John Parks Davis, a San
Francisco attorney.
Russia must somehow be made to
understand, they said, that she must
give up her sovereignty to the ex
tent that the world as a whole will
have complete jurisdiction over the
atom bomb.
There are many vital points in the
Baruch or Majority Plan, stated Mr.
Davis, which will make it a real
preventative measure against an
atom war and not merely another
treaty. So far, he said, the Russians
refuse to accept these proposals and
are thus delaying the world's ef
forts to stave off an atom war.
BOMB NO SECRET
Other declarations made by the
four members of the panel:
1. The atom bomb is no secret.
Russian scientists, said Dr. Schiff,
made basic contributions to the dis
covery of the atomic energy secrets,
and there is no reason to suppose
that they are not capable of pro
ducing the bomb.
2. Many Americans erroneously
believe that military defense against
the bomb can still be expected.
There is no defense now, Dr. Schiff
stated, and no reason to expect that
there will be such a defense.
3. The matter of atomic control
plans should be carried into the
General Assembly of the United
Nations, according to Dr. Rothwell,
in order to marshall an internation
al plan for atomic control.

Rothwell, that atom bomb plans
