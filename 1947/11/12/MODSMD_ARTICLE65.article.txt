Stanford assumes the responsibility
of parents to students attending the
University and for that reason has
a "Fundamental Standard" govern
ing their actions.
"This standard," Welch added,
"calls for conduct becoming to gen
tlemen, and such acts as stealing
road signs—which imperils drivers'
lives—cannot and will not be toler
ated."
ADDITIONAL SENTENCE
The punishment meted out by
Men's Council was in addition to a
30 - day suspended sentence from
Juvenile Judge A. R. Cotton of the
San Mateo County juvenile court,
two days spent in the Redwood City
