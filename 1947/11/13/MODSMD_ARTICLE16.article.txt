# Board of Trustees to deceive Financial Report; Division of Stanford Tuition Dollar Under Scrutiny
## 
### KEN PRATT 
Where does your 5166.65 go? How much of the cost of your education does it cover? Who
pays for team expenses? What chance have you for a scholarship? These questions demand
factual answers, for only an accurate and graphic statement can stamp out the jumbled myths of
Stanford finance.
While the specific distribution of the 1947-48 tuition dollar will not be announced until the
Board of Trustees meets on Nov.-

20, the general principles of Stan
ford finance can be determined from
past years.
The tuition paid by all Stanford
students goes into a general Uni
versity fund established in the Wells
Fargo Bank in San Francisco. The
pool of income includes gifts, tuition,
and endowment money.
MILLION IH)LLA|t INCOME
A tuition income of over two mil
lion dollars in 1946, for instance,
swelled the total income of the Uni
versity to nearly 4 million. That
same year, however, the University
spent more than 2 y /.- million on in
struction and research alone, and
with administration, upkeep, and
student service, the total costs of
the University that year and every
year far exceed tuition receipts.
The Office of the President reports
that a student today pays roughly
only 60 cents of every dollar spent
on his Stanford education. Origin
ally, Senator Stanford visualized an
institution where any student could
gain a higher education at nominal
tuition, and in the early years of the
Farm, financial limitation was no
serious barrier to entrance. At one
time the tuition at Stanford was $25
a quarter, and living expenses aver
aged $5 a week.

The cost of education has since
crept upward year by year, but the
same theory of subsidized educa
tion is still practiced. A University
bulletin of 1943 noted that "When
ever Stanford accepts a student's
application for admission, the Uni
versity is committing itself to an in
vestment in that student's career of
about $400 for each of four years.
The student, in other words, receives
an education that costs nearly twice
what he pays for it."
The academic cost of that Stanford
education is the sum of the expenses
of the individual Schools. In 1946
the Medical School with 447 students
led all Schools with an expense of
$500,000. The School of Humanities
with an enrollment of 468 followed
with $300,000, Social Sciences (1,071
students) spent $280,000, and Phy
sical Sciences (206 students) $221,000.
The Department of Physical Educa
tion cost more than half again as
much as the Business School or the
Law School or the School of Edu
cation.
DEI'ARTMENTAL ItESEARCII
The 2/> million dollars for "in
struction and departmental research"
includes faculty salaries; faculty
salaries alone at Yale University to
tal more than 3; million dollars.

The administrative cost of a Stan
ford education has sometimes been
exaggerated. The $180,000 admin
istration bill is but 4 percent of the
University expense of i'A million,
and that same 4 percent administra
tion-total expense ratio exists today
at Harvard.
ADMINISTRATIVE COST
Who pays for team expenses?
The Board of Athletic Control
before the war banked gate receipts
in an account from which it drew
i team expenses. During the war there
was no team and no gate receipts,
and the University paid the occas
ional athletic bills. When the Stan
ford Athletic Council (SAC) was
organized in Sept. 1945, all gate
receipts were to go lo the general
University fun; the University then
pays for team expenses. The 1945
j season was expensive—a coaching
staff, games, but no gate receipts.
| This last year showed a surplus, and
most of that surplus will pay off
that 1945 dcficit of $87,000. The Board
of Trustees cannot, however, si
phon off excess University funds
from gate receipts and use them for
academic expenses—a procedure for
which USC has been criticised.
What chances have you for a
j scholarship?

Approximately two hundred schol
arships are offered annually by the
University for undergraduates and
graduates; scholarship funds for
1946 totaled $02,000. Nearly all schol
arship funds arc for specific study,
for students of some specific locality,
or demand some other unique requi
site. Only fifteen schoolarships are
available for new undergraduate
students in freshman classes that
number more than 1.000.
TRADITION MOCKED
The present tuition at Stanford
mocks the tradition that "any stu
dent can work his way through the
University." Hopeful and talented
students without wealthy parents—
or a stretch with Uncle Sam—can
not consider Stanford University.
New funds this year might spread
scholarship aid, yet until the Uni
versity creates a comprehensive
scholarship program the odds for
such financial help arc slim.
With tuition and the number of
tuition collections at an all-time
high, new developments are possible
and expected in Stanford finance.
And when a student with a 16-unit
load now pays more than $1 an
academic hour, he can well watch,
and perhaps suggest, what is done
with that money.
The financial report for this last
year (the University fiscal year
ends in August) will reach the Board
of Trustees November 20. A care
ful examination of that report, some
critical thinking, and a few direct
suggestions can improve not only
our own classes, but the selection
and education of many future stu
dents at Stanford University.
