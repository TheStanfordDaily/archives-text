# Excom Names 'Pajama Com'
## 
### 
A committee to make definite
recommendations for handling the
1948 Pajamarino was appointed by
Excom last night.
Excom also decided last night I hat
the Axe, traditional symbol of Big
Game supremacy, will be displayed
in the Cellar beginning today.
The student legislative body ap
proved one Honor Code change
recommended by the Honor Code
Committee but rejected another
which would require students to
take exams in the classroom.
FRESHMAN REQUEST
Heading the Pajamarino commit
tee will be Gillian Duckworth, who
represented the freshman class last,
night in its request that the Paja
marino be continued.
Other members of the committee
will represent Excom, the sopho
more class, Encina, Roble and
Branner sponsors, the student po
lice, and Rally Com.
Included in the lengthy report of
recommendations presented by Miss
Duckworth were suggestions that,
the march down the Row be dis
continued, that a more definite rally
program be planned, and that a pre-
Pajamarino publicity campaign be
set up in order that freshmen will
enter the rally in a better spirit.
COUNCIL TO ASSESS
Excom derided to let the Council
for Student Control handle the
damages for last week's Pajama
rino. The assessments, as agreed
upon at an informal Monday meet
ing between leaders of interested
groups, were criticized by Excom
members.
Excom heard the report of Sun
Sargent concerning the case for the
Axe. The case which arrived was
not the correct size and Excom de
cided to display the Axe in a bor
rowed case rather than wait for
another case to be built.
The Axe will be returned to the
custody of the Stanford police de
partment nightly to safeguard it,
Acting Student Manager H. B. Mc-
Caullcy said.
HONOR CODE CHANGED
Cal Newman, chairman of the
Honor Code committee, read to Ex
com the recommendations of that
committee.
A recommendation that copies of
examinations be bound and placed
in the library was approved by Ex
com. Tliis will be subject to the
approval of the individual instruc
tor, Newman pointed out.
A second recommendation which
would require all tests to be taken
in the classrooms when space is
available was rejected by Excom by
a tight vote.
