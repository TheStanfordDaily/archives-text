# Graduate School of Business Enters Twenty-third Year of Campus Activity
## 
### JERRY STAVIG 
Now in its twenty-third year, the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness was founded in the autumn of
1925 largely through the aid of the
Hon. Herbert Hoover. Mr. Hoover's
work culminated several years of
formulative discussion by bringing
the need of financial support
squarely before a group of busi
nessmen on the Pacific Coast.
"The great future need of the
United States," averred the former
President, "is for men qualified to
lead in matters of economic states
manship. Our universities can do
much to satisfy the need by giving
dignity and deserved honor to men
who devote themselves to careers in
business and by further giving our
future business leaders that sound
foundation in the economic and so
cial sciences and arts from which
they may evolve balance and per
spective. Business then becomes
less a matter of black ink on the
balance sheet, and more a question
oi progress along lines by which we
measure national achievement."
FIVE OBJECTIVES
In order to attain this goal of
student preparation for effective
service in business, five broad ob
jectives were set:
(1) The development of an ap
preciation and understanding of the
human and material factors that
make up the subject matter of busi
ness.
(2) The training in operation of
the technical aids by means of
which business is administered and
controlled.
(3) The mastering of basic prin
ciples of business management by
practice in their adaptation and ap
plication to particular business sit
uations.
(4) The inculcation of the habit
of scientific analysis of technical
data.
(5; The stimulation of an apti
tude for intelligent and timely ac
tions, the essence of executive lead
ership.
Some f!0 specialized courses are
offered in the school by a highly
qualified staff of teaching person
nel. Supplementing the resident
faculty members, a group of ap
proximately 25 consulting profes
sors serve to cement the school's
association with industry. By this
means, the student is able to bene
fit from the wisdom and experience
of prominent business and indus
trial executives in actual "firing
line" situations.
FIELD TRIPS
Co-ordinated with textual instruc
tion, a series of visits to leading
business organizations in the vicin
ity aids in crystalizing for the stu
dent the constructive problems en
countered in the classroom. As a
part of this program, lectures by
successful businessmen are arranged
for the student's benefit.
Supplementary information is also
available in the library. Some 12,-
000 volumes of the more important

books in the field line its shelves.
A regular subscription to more than
600 current trade, financial, labor,
and general business periodicals is
also maintained.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Two important specialized activi
ties of the school are the Division
of Industrial Relations and the
Stanford Business Conference. The
former is devoted to gathering and
distributing impartial information
on current developments in the
field. Though largely dormant in
the several years of the war period,
the division again resumed full
time activity last year under Dr.
John P. Troxell.
The activities of the division en
tail instruction in industrial rela
tions, the development of a com
prehensive library on pertinent ma
terial, the preparation of current
reports on subjects of immediate in
terest to the field, and the supervi
sion of conferences for labor lead
ers and industrial relations execu
tives.
The Stanford Business Confer
ence was resumed last summer,
more than 200 business executives
registering throughout the confer
ence. "The Stanford Business Con
ference," according to Dean J. Hugh
Jackson, "has been and will contin
ue to be one of the most construc
tive services rendered to the busi

ness communities of the Pacific
Coast." Plans are already under
way for the conference to be held
next summer, July 19-23.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
Perhaps the best gauge of the
school's merit is evidenced by the
continuing flow of requests from
leading business concerns on the
Coast for its • graduates. "At the
present time," commented Dean
Jackson, "we are receiving almost
daily some request for the filling of
a position, and leading corporations
ure sending representatives to Stan
lord to seek out our graduates. It
now appears that this year we shall
have almost as many requests for
men and women as we have gradu
ates. We appreciate deeply this con
fidence which business and busi
nessmen have in the school."
Despite an unprecedented enroll
ment of some 550 students, the
Graduate School of Business is con
tinuing to maintain its excellent
standards and to render paramount
service to the students under its
supervision.
"The faculty," concluded Dean
Jackson, "approaches the future
with confidence and real anticipa
tion, in the belief that with each
passing year we shall continue to
contribute to the business life of the
nation a class of excellently trained
superior graduates."

ity aids in crystalizing for the stu

countered in the classroom. As a
part of this program, lectures by
successful businessmen are arranged
for the student's benefit.
Supplementary information is also
available in the library. Some 12,-
000 volumes of the more important

books in the field line its shelves.
A regular subscription to more than
600 current trade, financial, labor,
and general business periodicals is
also maintained.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Two important specialized activi
ties of the school are the Division
of Industrial Relations and the
Stanford Business Conference. The
former is devoted to gathering and
distributing impartial information
on current developments in the
field. Though largely dormant in
the several years of the war period,
the division again resumed full
time activity last year under Dr.
John P. Troxell.
The activities of the division en
tail instruction in industrial rela
tions, the development of a com
prehensive library on pertinent ma
terial, the preparation of current
reports on subjects of immediate in
terest to the field, and the supervi
sion of conferences for labor lead
ers and industrial relations execu
tives.
The Stanford Business Confer
ence was resumed last summer,
more than 200 business executives
registering throughout the confer
ence. "The Stanford Business Con
ference," according to Dean J. Hugh
Jackson, "has been and will contin
ue to be one of the most construc
tive services rendered to the busi

ness communities of the Pacific
Coast." Plans are already under
way for the conference to be held
next summer, July 19-23.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
Perhaps the best gauge of the
school's merit is evidenced by the
continuing flow of requests from
leading business concerns on the
Coast for its • graduates. "At the
present time," commented Dean
Jackson, "we are receiving almost
daily some request for the filling of
a position, and leading corporations
ure sending representatives to Stan
lord to seek out our graduates. It
now appears that this year we shall
have almost as many requests for
men and women as we have gradu
ates. We appreciate deeply this con
fidence which business and busi
nessmen have in the school."
Despite an unprecedented enroll
ment of some 550 students, the
Graduate School of Business is con
tinuing to maintain its excellent
standards and to render paramount
service to the students under its
supervision.
"The faculty," concluded Dean
Jackson, "approaches the future
with confidence and real anticipa
tion, in the belief that with each
passing year we shall continue to
contribute to the business life of the
nation a class of excellently trained
superior graduates."
Now in its twenty-third year, the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness was founded in the autumn of
1925 largely through the aid of the
Hon. Herbert Hoover. Mr. Hoover's
work culminated several years of
formulative discussion by bringing
the need of financial support
squarely before a group of busi
nessmen on the Pacific Coast.
"The great future need of the
United States," averred the former
President, "is for men qualified to
lead in matters of economic states
manship. Our universities can do
much to satisfy the need by giving
dignity and deserved honor to men
who devote themselves to careers in
business and by further giving our
future business leaders that sound
foundation in the economic and so
cial sciences and arts from which
they may evolve balance and per
spective. Business then becomes
less a matter of black ink on the
balance sheet, and more a question
oi progress along lines by which we
measure national achievement."
FIVE OBJECTIVES
In order to attain this goal of
student preparation for effective
service in business, five broad ob
jectives were set:
(1) The development of an ap
preciation and understanding of the
human and material factors that
make up the subject matter of busi
ness.
(2) The training in operation of
the technical aids by means of
which business is administered and
controlled.
(3) The mastering of basic prin
ciples of business management by
practice in their adaptation and ap
plication to particular business sit
uations.
(4) The inculcation of the habit
of scientific analysis of technical
data.
(5; The stimulation of an apti
tude for intelligent and timely ac
tions, the essence of executive lead
ership.
Some f!0 specialized courses are
offered in the school by a highly
qualified staff of teaching person
nel. Supplementing the resident
faculty members, a group of ap
proximately 25 consulting profes
sors serve to cement the school's
association with industry. By this
means, the student is able to bene
fit from the wisdom and experience
of prominent business and indus
trial executives in actual "firing
line" situations.

tinuing to maintain its excellent
standards and to render paramount
service to the students under its
supervision.
"The faculty," concluded Dean
Jackson, "approaches the future
with confidence and real anticipa
tion, in the belief that with each
passing year we shall continue to
contribute to the business life of the
nation a class of excellently trained
superior graduates."
Now in its twenty-third year, the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness was founded in the autumn of
1925 largely through the aid of the
Hon. Herbert Hoover. Mr. Hoover's
work culminated several years of
formulative discussion by bringing
the need of financial support
squarely before a group of busi
nessmen on the Pacific Coast.
"The great future need of the
United States," averred the former
President, "is for men qualified to
lead in matters of economic states
manship. Our universities can do
much to satisfy the need by giving
dignity and deserved honor to men
who devote themselves to careers in
business and by further giving our
future business leaders that sound
foundation in the economic and so
cial sciences and arts from which
they may evolve balance and per
spective. Business then becomes
less a matter of black ink on the
balance sheet, and more a question
oi progress along lines by which we
measure national achievement."
FIVE OBJECTIVES
In order to attain this goal of
student preparation for effective
service in business, five broad ob
jectives were set:
(1) The development of an ap
preciation and understanding of the
human and material factors that
make up the subject matter of busi
ness.
(2) The training in operation of
the technical aids by means of
which business is administered and
controlled.
(3) The mastering of basic prin
ciples of business management by
practice in their adaptation and ap
plication to particular business sit
uations.
(4) The inculcation of the habit
of scientific analysis of technical
data.
(5; The stimulation of an apti
tude for intelligent and timely ac
tions, the essence of executive lead
ership.
Some f!0 specialized courses are
offered in the school by a highly
qualified staff of teaching person
nel. Supplementing the resident
faculty members, a group of ap
proximately 25 consulting profes
sors serve to cement the school's
association with industry. By this
means, the student is able to bene
fit from the wisdom and experience
of prominent business and indus
trial executives in actual "firing
line" situations.
FIELD TRIPS
Co-ordinated with textual instruc
tion, a series of visits to leading
business organizations in the vicin
ity aids in crystalizing for the stu
dent the constructive problems en
countered in the classroom. As a
part of this program, lectures by
successful businessmen are arranged
for the student's benefit.
Supplementary information is also
available in the library. Some 12,-
000 volumes of the more important

books in the field line its shelves.
A regular subscription to more than
600 current trade, financial, labor,
and general business periodicals is
also maintained.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Two important specialized activi
ties of the school are the Division
of Industrial Relations and the
Stanford Business Conference. The
former is devoted to gathering and
distributing impartial information
on current developments in the
field. Though largely dormant in
the several years of the war period,
the division again resumed full
time activity last year under Dr.
John P. Troxell.
The activities of the division en
tail instruction in industrial rela
tions, the development of a com
prehensive library on pertinent ma
terial, the preparation of current
reports on subjects of immediate in
terest to the field, and the supervi
sion of conferences for labor lead
ers and industrial relations execu
tives.
The Stanford Business Confer
ence was resumed last summer,
more than 200 business executives
registering throughout the confer
ence. "The Stanford Business Con
ference," according to Dean J. Hugh
Jackson, "has been and will contin
ue to be one of the most construc
tive services rendered to the busi

ness communities of the Pacific
Coast." Plans are already under
way for the conference to be held
next summer, July 19-23.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
Perhaps the best gauge of the
school's merit is evidenced by the
continuing flow of requests from
leading business concerns on the
Coast for its • graduates. "At the
present time," commented Dean
Jackson, "we are receiving almost
daily some request for the filling of
a position, and leading corporations
ure sending representatives to Stan
lord to seek out our graduates. It
now appears that this year we shall
have almost as many requests for
men and women as we have gradu
ates. We appreciate deeply this con
fidence which business and busi
nessmen have in the school."
Despite an unprecedented enroll
ment of some 550 students, the
Graduate School of Business is con
tinuing to maintain its excellent
standards and to render paramount
service to the students under its
supervision.
