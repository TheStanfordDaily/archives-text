Several 15,000 - volt rectifiers,
power units which will be used in
the physics deparment for ad
vanced instruction and research in
microwaves, have been secured
through the War Assets Adminis
tration, it was announced yesterday
by Alf E. Brandin, University busi

The University's acquisition of
the units, which originally were
valued at. $22,400, involved three
months of negotiations and the co

Agency, War Assets, and the Hoff
man Hadio Corporation, which acts
as an agent for War Assets for the
distribution of highly specialized
electronic equipment.
A large quantity of other equip

million-volt X-ray machines, is still

wanted by the University.
Recently Stanford acquired six
trucks and four trailers containing
Army and Marine Corps radar
equipment which is also being used
