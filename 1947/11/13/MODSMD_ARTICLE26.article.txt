# Encina Preparing Saturday's Dance
## 
### 
Encina, "full of the spirit of the
devil," is making final preparations
today for the all-campus "To H
with '51" dance, scheduled for the
Encina lounge Saturday evening
from 9 to 1.
"Sophomores and upperclassmen
certainly will not be disappointed
with what has been done with their
taunting chant," stated John Hines,
dance chairman.
"Decorations and atmosphere will
give dancers the feeling that they
have been led to the underworld,
and the only relief they will get
will be from the 'cool' music of Er
nie Hecksher and his orchestra from
San Francisco," he added.
Ticket sales are lagging slightly,
according to Frank Manning, ad
mission chairman, but are expected
to pick up today. They are selling
for $1.80.
