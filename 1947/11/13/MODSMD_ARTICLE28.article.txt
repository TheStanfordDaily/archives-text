# Sailors to See Submarine Film

NROTC classes will Ret a behind
the-scenes account of the security
shrouded wartime activities of the
Pacific Fleet's "Silent Service"
when addressed tomorrow at the
SAC Building by Bill Granfield,
Graduate School of Business stu
dent. Granfield will use colored
movies taken aboard a combat sub
marine to illustrate his lecture.
Granfield saw duty as first lieu
tenant and damage control officer
aboard a sub which bagged 19 en
emy vessels, one of the famed "Red
Pirates of the China Coast," the
wolf pack which scourged Japanese
shipping and shore installations
from Tokyo Bay to the island of
Formosa. Their title originated in
a broadcast by an indignant "Tokyo
Rose" who violently deprecated
their activities.
His craft was depth - charged,
bombed by aircraft, run aground on
the Korean coast, and mistakenly
attacked by another U.S. sub. His
sub was also credited with a sam
pan sunk by ramming, and it dar
ingly destroyed by gunfire three
enemy ships lotiding at their docks.
Granfield is credited with the
hazardous plan of landing "spotters"
on enemy coasts to direct by radio
their craft's aggressive activities.
Granfield came to Stanford from
the Colorado School of Mines,
where he was an associate editor
of the school newspaper and held
intercollegiate conference boxing
honors.
