# Future Varsity Stars Gain Experience In Years Frosh Football Campaign
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Just how good were this year's
frosh gridders? Stanford's victory
starved grid fans optimistically look
forward to happier seasons in the
future and hope next year's sopho
mores will provide the necessary
punch to give the Indians a win
ning varsity.
The amazing Papeese have re
vealed a lot of talent which should
help bolster future Card elevens.
Rather than say next year's edition
of the Big Red Machine will go to
the Rose Bowl, let's say that Stan
ford should have a top-flight team
by 1949.
Before his season's opener, frosh
mentor Chuck Taylor just shook his
head when asked about his gridders.
The team looked ragged in pre-sea
son scrimmages, and continued to
look bad throughout the season in
week-day practice sessions.
FROKII COME TO LIFE
However, on five occasions (odd
ly enough each of these fell on a
Saturday) they came to life and
rolled over the best freshman elevens
in the state.
They stumbled through all but
10 seconds of a GO minute meeting
with Santa Clara in the opener.
Then, on the last play of the game,
a sensational pass from Tom Shaw
to Boyd Benson netted 95 yards and
a touchdown for a 6 to 0 Stanford
victory.
Next they journeyed south to meet
the much-publicized USC yearlings.
The Trobabes, boasting their usual
galaxy of stars, were humbled by a
spirited Stanford squad, 19 to 7.
Passes from Shaw to John Banks
and from Wayne Buck to John Hol
loway, along with a run by the ex
plosive Mr. Benson provided the
winning margin.
TIE STRONG BRUBABES
Meeting UCLA, the Papeese bat
tled the vaunted Brubabes to a
thrilling 14 to 14 tie. Two long
passes, one going from Buck to Jim
Hayes for 30 yards, and the other

from Shaw to Benson for 55, gave
Stanford its two touchdowns.
Their next encounter found them
rolling over San Jose's Spartlets,
33 to 23, in a wide-open game.
Benson's 98-yard kickoff return
featured this contest, although a

host of red-shirted frosh starred,
both through the air and on the
ground.
In last week's finale, the Papeese
met Cal at Berkeley in the "Little
Big Game." Banks ran for 10. Elb
Puckett for 1(5, Benson for 54, Hayes
for 40, and Gordon Mac Lachlan for
3, to give the Stanford frosh five
touchdowns and a 33 to 27 victory.
Stanford fans will be seeing many
of this year's high-spirited fresh
men in varsity roles during the next

I three years. Several boys are po
tential gridiron greats.
Four Chuck Taylor "graduates"
will add strength to Marchh?
Schwartz's flank positions next year.
Dick Schulze, Tom August, Bob
Scott, and Tom Vasilatas are all big
(over (i' 2" and 190 pounds), capable
pass receivers and hard-charging
defenders.
TACKLE PROSPECTS
Gordon White, 210-pound All-
Stater from Texas will help allevi
ate the tackle problem, along with
Walt Watters and Gerry Harder,
two other young giants. The de
pleted group of varsity guards will
1 welcome big, booming Gordon Lucas,
and Harry Hunt. Dick Abraham
I might prove to be the finest Stan
ford center since pre-war days.
Two brilliant quarterbacks will
j help direct next year's Stanford
| "T." Tom Shaw, according to many
J observers, passes better now than
I Frankie Albert ever did during his
college days. Shaw is equally accu
rate with short jump-passes and
long aerial offerings. Wayne Buck,
passing from the left side, should
also develop into a shining light.
If frosh grid statistics had been
! kept, Boyd Benson, galloping left
halfback, would probably have es
-1 tablished some kind of yardage rec
ords. Scoring from all over the field,
j the lean Renton, Washington speed
1 merchant is almost impossible to stop
| once he passes the line of scritn
j mage.
AIJBLE FASTEST
Other outstanding backs include
big Jim Auble, the fastest runner
on the squad, John Banks, hard-run
ning converted end, Jim Hayes, a
consistent yard-gainer, and Gordon
Mac Lachlan, driving fullback.
When these boys join the varsity
ranks next fall, Marchie Schwartz
will have less problems than he faced
this year. If he can find some addi
tional help in the line before next
autumn, the Indians should go a
long way.


Although FRANKIE ALBERT,
great Stanford quarterback| under
Clark Shaughnessy in 1940-41, is
generally considered the best T
formatinn passer in Farm grid
history, many experts are tabbing
Tom Shaw, sensational frosh
dinger, as his peer.
