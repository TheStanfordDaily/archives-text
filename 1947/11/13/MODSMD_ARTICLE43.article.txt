The Delta Tau Delta and Village
212 volleyball teams, campus final
ists in last year's tournament,
staged two of the most exciting net
games to date last night. The Delts,
who also won the matches last au
tumn, managed to win by 15 to 10
and 16 to 14 scores.
Kappa Alpha's volleyballers de
feated the Encina 5E team, 15 to 4
and 15 to 8, and the Sigma Chi's
easily downed the Theta Xi squad,
15 to 5 and 15 to 7, in the two af
ternoon games.
Alpha Sigma Phi and Village 117
(III) won over the Deke (A) and
Alpha Sigma Chi teams by default.
In the feature contest the Delts,
led by tall Bill Davidson, combined
effective setups with deadly spiking
to overcome the steady but less
consistent Villagers.
The team from the Row started
slowly in each game, but gradually
crept up and overcame the opposi
tion. The Delts Sextet is composed
of Milt Iverson, Jerry Lamb, Fer
ris Boothe, Jim Bradshaw, Bob
Fess, and the aforementioned Da
vidson.
The 212 team, with five members
of last year's Village champs, was
paced by Lou Gowans. Other squad
members included Jack Pierce, Jack
Coe, Howard PouJter, Dan Cook,
and Talu.
