# JV's Blast Frosh from Unbeaten List!
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford's freshman football team,
unbeaten in live games during its
regular season, absorbed a 20 to 7
defeat at the hands of the junior
varsity yesterday.
The contest was in the nature of a
post - season affair for the frosh,
and they were not at full strength,
but they nevertheless played a bang
up game. Statistics show that the
yearlings ran up 14 first downs to
i their elder's 7 and completed five
I passes to the jayvees' one.
The margin of victory for the
i JV's came in the form of a 60-yard
! touchdown gallop by halfback Em
ery Mitchell and two pass inter
ceptions, both of which led to jay
vee counters.
! The first touchdown of the con
test was scored by jayvee halfback
Van Johns who intercepted a frosh
pass and hit out for a 10-yard re
turn to the frosh 30-yard stripe. A
quick succession of short gainers
put the ball on the two-yard line,
from where left half Bobby Bahl
man scored on an end run. Kelton's
try was good and the score was 7
to 0.
The freshmen bounced back with a
sustained attack from their own 30
to the opponent's six-yard line, but
there the well-oiled offensive ma
chine broke down and they lost the
ball on downs.

Left half Boyd Benson aided the
yearling cause for a moment when he
sliced off his left tackle and broke
into the open for a 30-yard jaunt to
his own 34. With two minutes re
maining in the first half, quarter
back Wayne Buck took to the air
only to see his offering gathered in
by jayvee halfback Jack McKillip.
McKillip intercepted and tightroped
down the right sidelines to pay
dirt and the second score for the
junior varsity lads. The try for
point failed.
Starting off the second half in
the style of play that earned them
the plaudits of the crowd of approxi
mately 250, the frosh took over
from the jayvees and carried the ball
to the opponent's three-yard line,
where their attack once again fal

tered and they lost the ball on
downs.
The third and last jayvee counter
came in the third period when
Mitchell sliced inside his right tackle,
cut back, and romped CO yards for
the marker. Kelton's try was good
and the jayvees led, 20 to 0.
As if they wanted to show that
their previous drives to the JV goal
line had not been pure luck, Chuck
Taylor's yearlings received the kick
off and marched from their 25-yard
line to the JV nine. At that point,
with the time running out, Quarter
hack Tom Shaw faded all the way
back to his !50 and lofted a long pass
to end Laughton in the corner of
the end zone for the freshmen's only
tally.
