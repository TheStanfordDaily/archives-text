# It's Not So Dark in the Cellar

This is a pat on the back for each and every
Stanford rooter.
At the beginning of this football season The
Daily ran an editorial warning Stanford stu
dents of the danger of throwing away the
Farm's reputation for good sportsmanship and
loyalty in the rooting section. They have done
the opposite.
The enthusiasm and support that the Farm
student body has shown for the team in the
last few games has caused much comment
from our opponents, alumni, and other ob
servers.
In spite of Stanford's having a hold on the
cellar position of the Pacific Coast Conference,
the rooters have not failed to stand in back of
the team every Saturday afternoon. We sur
prised the visiting UCLA students. We out

yelled and out-fought the SC rooting section.
Several of the San Francisco sports writers
have commented on the fact that this student
body will not be bowed down by defeat. Bill
Leiser of the Chronicle said last Saturday,
"Stanford can take it . . . Students who can
take it and laugh and blame no one have what
it takes to see that the situation improves."
We have seen the football team improve
every week. The rooters have greeted their
efforts with enthusiasm. With two games to
go and morale at this height, the sky is the
limit.
Regardless of the outcome of the game,
Nov. 22, the 8,000 Stanford rooters, who have
proved themselves this season, are picked to
give 20,000 students from Cal a good fight.
