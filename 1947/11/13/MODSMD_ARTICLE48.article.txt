# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
They say we all learn as we grow older. One
thing I learned for sure the other night is not to get
into fights with people you know nothing about.
I got into a little squabble up in the city Friday
night. Nothing serious. The Doctor says I'll be able
to see out of my light eye before long.
Funny thing is he was so thin he looked like he
would have to glue his coat on. I was mistaken—it
was his brass knuckles that were glued on.
I've had a little boxing experience. Matter of fact
I've been knocked out of the ring so many times that
I'm the only fighter who can claim four hours flying
time. I was going to give this guy the old one one.
1 can't give him the old one two on account of I've
got two left hands. I told him 1 was a Stanford
Rough, but it didn't impress him—he hit me anyway.
All of this happened at a very swanky night
club. Everyone was dressed formal. I was wearing
shoes. It's the only night club I ever saw where
you get a beer with a cherry in it. And the prices—
the head waiter won't even look at you unless you've
got a face like Alexander Hamilton. If you've got
a bankroll big enough to choke a horse they'll give
vou food that will do the same thing. They don't

bring a plate for you to leave a tip on, they use a
safe deposit box.
I've got to go back next weekend to wash some
more dishes, but I don't really mind though. At least
I made a big impression with my girl. All you have
to do these days is spend a little dough and they're
impressed. I always say that up to the age of 21 a
girl is a minor. After that she's a gold digger. (That's
pretty subtle—watch out for it.)
Anyway the date turned out to be like a string
of pearls—necklace that is. She was a peach so I
figured the evening couldn't be fruitless, but I just
didn't know what kind of people you meet in San
Francisco night clubs.
And speaking of different people, there was one
guy who came in and ordered a Schmiddling special
with a strawberry in it. He drank the thing, got off
the stool, walked across the floor, up the north wall,
across the ceiling, down the south wall and out the
door.
"Say," I said to the bartender, "he is certainly a
queer person."
"Yeah," says the bartender, "he hardly ever says
goodnight."
