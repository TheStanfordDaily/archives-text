### ALLEN BLETZ 
While I was in Los Angeles this last weekend I
had the fortune or misfortune of attending an anti-
Universal Military Training meeting. The speakers,
who were outstanding men in the field of education
and noted church leaders, made several general
points against the adoption of universal training for
the youth of the United States. None of them, in
my opinion, are persuasive.
One point is that universal training is outmoded
in an atomic age. This restates the old fallacy that
we are in a push-button era that makes unnecessary
the mobilization of manpower. This is contrary to
the testimony of practically every military leader we
have. I prefer to take the word of Marshall, Eisen
hower. Nimitz, and other experts that we are a long
way now from push-button war, and that the more
war is mechanized the greater becomes the need for
trained men.
Another point that was brought out during the
meeting was that adoption by the United States of
universal training would help make inevitable a
new and titanic struggle. Did our military weakness
between the two World Wars help pevent the second
war, or our pacificism before 1014 help prevent the
first one? The answer here certainly seems obvious.
Another argument which this "select'' group pre
sented is that odoption of UMT would give us a feel-

ing and semblance of power without the reality and
would therefore tend to weaken our international
position. But no one who favors UMT has said, or
believes, that it will take the place of any other mili
tary arm. It is only part of a programâ€”the insurance
against a sudden emergency that otherwise would
find this country handicapped beyond repair.
The only real security for this country or any
country lies in the abolition of war through the es
tablishment of the "reign of law" among nations.
However, the anti-UMT groups attack this statement
whenever and wherever they can. They claim that
UMT is against American ideals and principles. I
do not think that it is.
It seems to me rather that this group which claims
to be fighting to keep America free from military
control is unrealistic; unrealistic when it sets up the
premise that there Ls in international relations today
any general acceptance of good intentions that are
not backed up by strength.
The best way to prevent war, in my opinion, is to
remove its causes. This nation is embarked on many
programs that have this fine aim. But it is an aim
not yet achieved. Until the goal is more clearly in
sight than it is today it would be well for this na
tion, and those other nations with like aims, to
remain strong in all ways, and not in good intentions
only.
