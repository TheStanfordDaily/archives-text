To the Editor:
What is this insidious element manifesting itself
through KSU's Cardinal Classics? Could it be per
haps that some unruly scoundrels have taken it upon
themselves to attempt to bring about a revolution
in music.
In the first place the announcer solemnly informs
us that we are now to hear Cardinal Classics, a pro
gram of serious music. Why is it that all music riot
playing on the nearest juke box is considered serious?
And surely it is more comparable to a farce when
we arc blithely presented alternate snatches of works
by say Mozart and Prokofiev until some fantastically
observant fellow notices that the labels aren't the
same color.
Even though we had spent the entire evening
listening to symphonies from remote stations fight
ing a losing battle with quiz programs from Salt
Lake or Los Angeles, anticipating at least clear
reception and tastefully selected music at 9:!50, we
would not complain about the occasional mix-ups had
it not been for the program Sunday night.
The little men seem to have at last come out of
hiding and executed a successful coup. At first every
thing seemed quite normal — "Cardinal Classics,
Serious Music," and a conventional opening number,
and we felt only a faint sense of suspicion as we suf
fered through that good old musical cliche Rhapsody
in Blue. Then all negotiations seemed to cease as
the revolutionists fired the first shot by shocking us
out of our lethargy with pure jazz. It seemed for a
moment as though the conservatives had suppressed
the upstarts when Waltz of the Flowers, of all things,
came next, but alas, we knew the battle was lost
when the announcer finally informed us (perhaps at
the point of a gun?) that the next fifteen minutes
would be devoted to popular music. The final blow
came at the end when the poor fellow, either crazed
by the battle or ittempting to hide the disgrace under
a cloak of normalcy, again quite seriously assured us
thai wi' had been listening to Cardinal Classics!
II KSU doesn't like classical music, O K, but

I
why beguile us into listening by presenting the pro
gram under such a deceptive title? Or if they are
serious in their intentions, why not present just one
hour of classical music unadulterated?

why beguile us into listening by presenting the pro

serious in their intentions, why not present just one

To the Editor:
What is this insidious element manifesting itself
through KSU's Cardinal Classics? Could it be per
haps that some unruly scoundrels have taken it upon
themselves to attempt to bring about a revolution
in music.
In the first place the announcer solemnly informs
us that we are now to hear Cardinal Classics, a pro
gram of serious music. Why is it that all music riot
playing on the nearest juke box is considered serious?
And surely it is more comparable to a farce when
we arc blithely presented alternate snatches of works
by say Mozart and Prokofiev until some fantastically
observant fellow notices that the labels aren't the
same color.
Even though we had spent the entire evening
listening to symphonies from remote stations fight
ing a losing battle with quiz programs from Salt
Lake or Los Angeles, anticipating at least clear
reception and tastefully selected music at 9:!50, we
would not complain about the occasional mix-ups had
it not been for the program Sunday night.
The little men seem to have at last come out of
hiding and executed a successful coup. At first every
thing seemed quite normal — "Cardinal Classics,
Serious Music," and a conventional opening number,
and we felt only a faint sense of suspicion as we suf
fered through that good old musical cliche Rhapsody
in Blue. Then all negotiations seemed to cease as
the revolutionists fired the first shot by shocking us
out of our lethargy with pure jazz. It seemed for a
moment as though the conservatives had suppressed
the upstarts when Waltz of the Flowers, of all things,
came next, but alas, we knew the battle was lost
when the announcer finally informed us (perhaps at
the point of a gun?) that the next fifteen minutes
would be devoted to popular music. The final blow
came at the end when the poor fellow, either crazed
by the battle or ittempting to hide the disgrace under
a cloak of normalcy, again quite seriously assured us
thai wi' had been listening to Cardinal Classics!
