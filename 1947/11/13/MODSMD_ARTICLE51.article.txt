To the Editor:
The article about Chancellor Robert M. Hutchins
in Tuesday's Daily was not quite up to date Today
Mr. Hutchins is neither a boy nor a president. He is
a man who has decided to do all that one intelligent
and responsible citizen can do to prevent the human
race from exterminating itself.
Some ten months ago in a talk called "The Good
News of Damnation," Mr. Hutchins made this state
ment: "After centuries of misconduct we now have
about five years in which to learn how to behave our
selves .... learning how to behave ourselves is
the only defense against the atomic bomb." By "we"
he meant the human race; by "learning how to behave
ourselves" he mean that survival depended on educa
tion. Therefore, since turning over the immediate
duties of running the University of Chicago to
President Colwell in 1945, Mr. Hutchins has been
mainly concerned with educating as many adults as
he could reach in all parts of the country through
the Encyclopedia Britannica, which he heads, and
the Great Books study program. Instead of being
"the most dangerous man in American education,"
Chancellor Hutchins is America's leading educator j
in the crusade to establish the kind of world society
in which American education can continue to exist.
Mr. Hutchins still holds the ideas set forth in his
"The Higher Learning in America," published in
1936. You may bo sure, however, that when he
speaks today he will apply those ideas to the
America of November 13, 1947: and he will do it with
a clearness and conciseness that few public figures
are capable of. My guess is that what Mr. Hutchins
has to say to Stanfordites will, to put it bluntly, j
scale tin' pants oil some ol us.
