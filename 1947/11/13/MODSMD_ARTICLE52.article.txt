# Cap and Gown Qualifications Include Activities, Scholarship

### JACKIE MILNOR 
"Women leaders on campus
should be active to be of use to
Stanfordâ€”not merely to exalt
themselves."
It was with this thought in mind
that the Cap and Gown society was j
formed, Mrs. Edith Ronald Mirrie
lees, one of the 12 original members i
said yesterday.
"So, one spring morning, the spring J
before the earthquake, a group of j
campus-minded women started a
society to bring together women
leaders. It would be a coherent body
to show each leader the proper place
of her activity in relation to the
rest of the Farm.
EARTHQUAKE COMES
"But," Mrs. Mirrielees continued,
"came the earthquake. And after
that, not much of anything went on!"
So, it was not until the next fall '
that a constitution was drawn up. )
"It was immediately lost," Mrs. Mir- j
rielees chuckled. "And do you know,
we've been doing that ever since. |
We make so many constitutions, and
lose them all!"
The embryo society felt that quali-

fication.i Tor membership should in
clude, not only leadership in campus
activities, but also scholarship.
"For without this, a girl who devot
ed all her time to activities would
have the edge on the more studious
girl," Mrs. Mirrielees explained.
QUALIFICATIONS LISTED
The third qualification is more in
tangible. "You can feel it, but can't
quite put your finger on it. We call
it "carrying on in a self-forgetful
fashion. Working for the good of
others, not just for self."
Cap and Gown sponsors four quar
ter scholarships. Money is raised
partly by the calendar sales, and
partly by contributions of self
earned money from each active
member. Graduate members of the
society usually attend open meet
ings. They have no vote, but they
feel that these meetings keep them
in contact with their old friends.
