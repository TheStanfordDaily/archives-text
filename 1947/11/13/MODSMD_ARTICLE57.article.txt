# Urgent Aid Asked for Austrian Students
## 
### 
"I wish that a student could
talk to all our Austrian universi
ties. Our young people would then
know how Americans have a heart,"
asserted Dr. Karl Komuczki, Aus
trian Red Cross official now sur
veying American Red Cross meth
ods for use by his own country.
The doctor was recently on the
Food Conservation Forum panel in
Palo Alto with Mrs. Helen Farns
worth, Miss Christine Ricker, and
Bill Fairer.
The young doctor explained that
Austria's three universities at Vi
enna, Innsbruck, and Gratz have
drastic food, housing, and supplies
problems. They lack the simplest
necessities â€” shoes, clothes, tooth
brushes, razors, soap, pencils, pa

per, and enough food for health.
The doctor said that Austrian stu
dents are deeply grateful for any
help given them, but what they
hunger for mostly are books, ideas,
and friendships.
America's universities obtained
textbooks chiefly from Leipzig be
fore the war. Now, as Leipzig is in
the Russian zone, the students need
dictionaries, and history, geography,
and technical books.
Dr. Komuczki said feelingly, "If
America's students will write to
them so they can understand, and
send them books about America,
and your magazines like Time and
Reader's Digest, and school books,
they would be very grateful."
"There aren't many medical

books available to European .stu
dents now," the doctor said in an
swer to a question. "The Nazis gave
so many of our young men a thor
ough medical training that now
they cannot support themselves or
their families, since the people who
need them cannot pay them a living
wage.
"They cannot get offices or medi
cal equipment. They go from door
to floor selling, or work in the fields
to get enough to eat."
