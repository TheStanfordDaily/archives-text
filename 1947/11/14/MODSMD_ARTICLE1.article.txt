# Van Brocklin vs. Bell—Aerial Warfare Expected On Stanford Stadium's Turf Tomorrow Afternoon
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
Aerial warfare, of the football
variety, seems in store for the
fans tomorrow when Oregon's
Webfeet and Stanford's Indians
clash for th 18th time at the
Farm stadium.
It's Norm Van Brocklin vs. Ains
lic Bell as the two teams will at
tempt to crack each other's rela
tively weak pass defenses. Right
now the Cards have the edge on the
passing defense statistics and after
last week's good showing down
south the Indians may tighten up.
INDIANS "IIIGIIT"
Psychologically the Cards look
right for this one. The spirit on the
squad is at a "winning" peak. Ac
cording to backfield coach Ray
Hammctt the team is not "looking
over" Oregon to the Cal game but
arc out to make this game the first
win of the season.
Good news from Card training
quarters shows the Indians at a 99
percent physical efficiency level.
Dan Mcrvin, big right end, will def
initely start against the Oregons.
Mcrvin suffered a knee injury in
the USC contest but it has healed
rapidly. The only Card that has no
chance to play will be Micky Titus,
and Coach Schwartz plans to save
his injured halfback for the Big
Game.
OREGON BET CHOICE
Up in Oregon the bet merchants
can't see the Indians in the same
ball yard with the Webfeet. Right
now they claim Oregon is riding

high. After a miserable season start
in which the Ducks lost three in a
row, Coach Jim Aiken has "shaken
up" the squad and they have been
playing winning ball ever since.
The one-two punch of the Duck
attack are two well known names in
coast football—Norm Van Brocklin
and Jake Leicht. Sophomore Van
Brocklin leads the Pacific Coast

Conference In passing and Jake
Leicht, enjoying his best season,
leads the show in rushing.
WKBFOOT LINE BIG
Up front the Webfoot line is big,
fast and rugged from tackle to
tackle. But they lack depth and
that may be the deciding factor in
tomorrow's contest. All season long
the Cards have met teams with two
or three strings of competent line
men. Tomorrow they arc going to
meet a ball club that will have to
play them 11 men, sixty minutes
right down to the wire.
