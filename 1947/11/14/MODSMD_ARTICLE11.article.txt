# Assembly Hears Hutchins' Address
## 
### 
Robert M. Hutchins called for
"one good world" based on
justice and acceptance of com
mon ideals and principles in an
address to Stanford students
and faculty yesterday.
Speaking before a standing
room-only throng in Memorial
Auditorium, the Chancellor of
the University of Chicago hit
out at the United States policy
of "peace by force, purchase,
and intimidation."
"We have now arrived at the
ult'matc stage of history. War
must be abolished now by world
government.
"There must be one good world
based on a world community of hu
manity. Every man is our neighbor.
We can no longer ask 'Should for
eigners be abolished or should we
save some to sell things to?'

The complete text of Dr.
Illltchins' speech was unavailable
to The Daily. 'Ihis is a conden
sation of it.

"There is a common principle in
the humanity of all mankind. There
must be patience, tolerance, and
good will. We may find this com
mon basis in the fact that they are
other human beings like ourselves.
"Before the atomic bomb we
thought we could wait for evolution
to bring us world government. But
we have reached the point where
another war will mean the end of
civilization. We must now reason

that world government is necessary
and therefore possible.
"We must at least start talking
about world government if we can
not accomplish it this morning. No
body knows about world govern
ment. The only way to find out if it
is practicable is to work at it and
talk about it.
"This is not an attack on the
United) Nations. The UN is the
first, highly tentative step in the
direction of world government.
"To criticize the UN in favor of
world government is to say the
baby carriage is supplanted by the
automobile.
"There is no secret of, or de
fense for. the atom bomb. Nei
ther side will win in an atomic
war.
"The era of force will end on the
day our monopoly of the atom bomb
is over. That day is not far away.
Yet we rely on the bomb more than
ever.
"We say not Met us be good,' but
'let us be powerful to make other
nations good.'
"We do not feed the starving be
cause it is right, but because we
don't want them to vote the Com
munist ticket.
"We have these alternatives.
Either we use the bomb at once
in a preventative war against
Russia or we must create a situa
tion where bombs cannot be used.
"Our policy of peace by intimi
dation has caused Vishinsky to re
sort to the reductio ad absurdum
of that concept—peace by vilifica
iton.
"Peace by purchase is possible
only where nations are purchase

able and will only last as long as
people are willing to sell their in
dependence for food.
"Furthermore we haven't been
buying peace, but allies for the
next war.
"We cannot have another war
and civilization.
"We must try peace through
justice. Human dignity forbids
the use of force except by law.
"We must remember that man is
neither a mcai-.s lo an end or is an
end himself. We must give every
man the rights of man.
"He must be free from want, free
from tyranny, oppression, and ex
ploitation. We must admit that
man's claims to life, liberty, and
dignity arc inalienable.
"We must establish a human
community from a common hu
manity.
"There are minimum moral and
spiritual requirements. They are
summed up in the word justice.
Men will fight, until they get rights.
IVace and justice stand and
fall together.
"We must rely on power of ex
ample. We must sacrifice some of
the prejudices dear to us. We will
have to give up many economic and
social advantages.
"We must pay for peace. The
price of peacc is justicc.
"At present there is no danger
from Russia or from Communism.
Now we are our own worst enemy.
"U.S. policy has been character
ized by hysteria and inertia. We
do not face the facts of life and we
do nothing about them.
"While we have the atomic
bomb monopoly we Ho not need

the frenzied military preparations
for war, and when the other na
tions have found the secret, our
preparations will do no good. This
is the strongest argument against
Universal Military Training.
"These preparations are, in fact,
dangerous to us. For they can be
used to convince other nations that
we are out to dominate the world.
"Our first obligation is to com
mand imitation of other nations by
doing good in our own country. We
must rework our system so that the
others will advance by imitation.
"The atomic bomb makes peace
by force — a Pax Americana — a
dream. It will give us not one
Rome by two Cartilages.
"The task of your generation is
peace. The Japanese at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki got no consolation
from being killed by Ph.D.'s.
"Our knowledge now exceeds
our capacity to use it for good.
But we must not slow down the
laboratories. Rather we must
quickly make our moral standard
equal to our intellectual advance
ment.
"Our problem is the establish
ment of good will. We must start
with justice at home and let it ex
tend through the world. The char
acter of our nation will be it.s best
defense. A moral tind intellectual
conviction and belief in what you
defend is necessary. We must not
defend peace as the American way
of life—by which we really mean
all the comforts of home—but we
must defend the cause of suffering
humanity everywhere.

world order and the basis of one
good world."
