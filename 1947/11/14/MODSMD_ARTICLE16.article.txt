Stanford Relief Drive donations neared the $3,000 mark to
day, with contributions coming in at an increased rate as the end
of the $12,000 drive draws near, Bill Dirker and Molly Shaw, co
chairmen of the drive, announced. "If more contributions such
those from Roble corridor 2A are made by Saturday night, the

drive will end very successfully"
Dirker staled. Each of the 2A giHs
gave an average of $6.23 apiece.
A total of $2,837.87 has been re
ceived by the relief fund office.
