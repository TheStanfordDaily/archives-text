# Stanford's 240 Acres of Golf Greens Rated Most Difficult in Bay Region
## 
### 
What makes a golf course?
Whether it's the 240 acres of roll
in;' fairways, the greens and haz
ard.. or the 6,700 yards of play, the
Stanford golf course has it.
The 18 - hole University - owned
and operated club on the western
i <ii ; p of Stanford's 8,800 acres has
consistently been rated by the
Northern California Golf Assoccia
-1 ion ... the most challenging to play
and one of the best all-round com
binations in the Bay Area.
The club was opened Jan. 1, 1929.
Funds were made available by the
rd of Athletic Control from
football ;irid other paid admission
atliletic activities. Townspeople and
ji embers of the administration and
faculty subscribed whole-heartedly
to the idea, and the townspeople
now compose an annual member
ship of 242 wilh dues of $140.
TWO <NK't RUCTORS
Kddie Twiggs, the club's profes
sion,il who bcciin hi.s duties in 19.12,
and a; istant Robert Stevens, who
has b< cm teaching the game to Stan-
J:,! .lit.': since 1936. compose the duo j
whoso instruction to neophyte stu- I
dent toilers has made more true
1h" phrase "duffers come and golf
ers l! O."
lii ~11 fairness, though, by no j

means all the players who have
shouldered or wheeled their clubs
over the four miles of fairways have
been beginners at the uame.
Lawson Little was holder of both

the National Amateur and British
Amateur titles during the time he
used the links as a student at Stan
ford. Pud Brownell, who held the
record of 63 for the par 71 course
before his death in the recent war;
Chuck Lever; Stuart Hawley, a
California state champion; and Art
Doering, now a pro at Evanston,
Illinois, are among those who have
taken advantage of the well-plan
ned terrain.
Not a country club, the Pro Shop,
a clubhouse with showering facili
ties for men and women, a soda
fountain, and an excellent putting
green complete the $244,000 worth
of facilities available for the recre
ation or serious study of members
and students.
A little more on the incidental
side, the services of 10 men are
needed to keep the course in top
condition. The greens of seaside
bent grass and fairways of Ken
tucky Blue and Pro Trivialis re
quire enough water from Felt and
Searsville Lakes during the dry
season to easily supply the needs of
a air-sized iown,
RIDING SCHOOL HAZARD
Its six water hazards and 45 sand
traps are connected in part by both
an underpass and an overpass, and
it is one of the few courses which
can boast a complete riding school
so centrally located that it occasion
ally becomes a major hazard.
Only one near fatality has been
witnessed, and that occurred when
an irate player threw his clubs into
the creek near the eighth hole with
such vigor that he fell and knocked
himself unconscious. He was re
vived by a nearby PG & E crew of
linemen.
Stanford has been chosen as the
site of the 1948 National Intercolle
giate Golf Tournament, the first
time the play has been scheduled
west of the Mississippi River. Coach
Twiggs says Stanford has the mak
ings of a good golf team. More than
that, they will have an opportunity
to show off the course of which the
University is justly proud.


KDDIK TWIGGS, Stanford golf
pro since 1932, is still making
"golfers from duffers."
