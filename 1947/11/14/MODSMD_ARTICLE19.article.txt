# Pajamarino Costs Money and Time
## 
### 
Carroll Blacker, Superintendent
of Buildings and Grounds, said yes
terday that last week's Pajamarino
rioters ought to know just exactly
how much time and money they
have cost the Corporation Yard.
The superintendent said, "Our
carpenter shop has been busy prac
tically all week replacing broken
1 windows and smashed-in doors. The
{ carpenters were months behind in
their work even before the unpre
meditated damage was done, and
now as a result of it are more be
hind than ever."
"When I was here at Stanford," the
superintendent continued, "the stu
dents would serenade the girls be
neath their windows and parade up
and down in front of their dorms;
but no thought was given to such
i gangsterism as was prevalent the
other night. As I remember, when
ever a few guys got unduly rough
and lost their heads, there was al
ways a larger, saner group to put
them down and keep the mob on an
I even keel.
"Evidently there was no restrain
ing faction the other night. Win
dows and doors were smashed and
rooms were rifled, all seemingly
without a word of protest from
those 'saner, supposedly mature
i university students.
Mr. Blacker continued. "The ac
tual cost amounts to $850, but the
time lost and the infamous, nation
: wide reputation gained amount to
| much more than that."
