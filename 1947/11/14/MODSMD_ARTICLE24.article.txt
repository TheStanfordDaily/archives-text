# NSA Speakers' Bureau Arranged for California
## 
### 
(The following is the first in a
series of articles which comprise
the report from the National Stu
dents Association regional Execu
tive Council meeting held from
November 1-3 in Los Angeles.
Stanford has two of the nine mem
bers on the Council . . . Chuck
Martin and Ginny Titus.)
The NSA regional Domestic Com
mission has set up a Speakers Bu
reau at Mills College and Occidental
College. NSA groups at these
schools will contact such organiza
tions as the Republican and Dem
ocratic state committees, the Cham
ber of Commerce, Southern Cali
fornia All-Year Club, etc. in com
piling a complete list of noted
speakers who will be coming to
California.
By maintaining a close eye, these
subcommissions hope to know at all
times what speakers are available
for speaking engagements. Any
schcol desiring a noted speaker on
any subject, political or otherwise,
needs only to notify the subcorh
mission of its need and the arrange
ments can be made.
However, to safeguard NSA's non
partisan stand, all schools are re
quired to invite two men, one on
each side of the issue to be dis
cussed. This can take the form of
! an open forum discussion or, if that
i is not feasible, two programs held
1 as closely together as possible.
In other words, if Stanford wished
to have Henry Wallace speak on
conditions in the Near East, another
man representing the opposing
stand would be listed. This policy
of free discussion will satisfy Ex
com's decision of barring political
action groups from the campus. It
will help fill the gap left by its de
cision and further its wish that po
litical thought of a nonpartisan na
ture be encouraged.
In addition the Speakers Bureau
subcommissions are working on a
manual to aid groups on the various
campuses who will be in charge of
.these forums. Included will be
helpful material on the technique
of handling open debates, success

f'ul methods of moderating, and sug
gestions oh ways o{ protecting the
speakers from unfair questions. In
this way, NSA hopes to more suc
cessfully handle these programs;
the speakers will feel they have
been courteously treated, and the
discussion which results from cor
rect handling of questions from the
floor will be of the most valuable
kind.
Internationally, NSA wishes to
announce the policy of furthering
international discussion and aware
ness programs. To implement this
policy, all material from the Novem
ber 13 conference of the Council on
Atomic Implications at University
of Southern California will be
mimeographed and distributed to
member schools with the request
that similar programs be sponsored.
Pertinent literature on hand at the
Council's office will be included.
The CAI will aid any school wish
ing to put on a like conference by
furnishing movie film. In addition,
a delegate from the CAI will pre
sent the results of this conference
to the Western College Congress
to be held here at Stanford by the
III! on November 23-5.

f'ul methods of moderating, and sug
gestions oh ways o{ protecting the
speakers from unfair questions. In
this way, NSA hopes to more suc
cessfully handle these programs;
the speakers will feel they have
been courteously treated, and the
discussion which results from cor
rect handling of questions from the
floor will be of the most valuable
kind.
Internationally, NSA wishes to
announce the policy of furthering
international discussion and aware
ness programs. To implement this
policy, all material from the Novem
ber 13 conference of the Council on
Atomic Implications at University
of Southern California will be
mimeographed and distributed to
member schools with the request
that similar programs be sponsored.
Pertinent literature on hand at the
Council's office will be included.
The CAI will aid any school wish
ing to put on a like conference by
furnishing movie film. In addition,
a delegate from the CAI will pre
sent the results of this conference
to the Western College Congress
to be held here at Stanford by the
III! on November 23-5.
(The following is the first in a
series of articles which comprise
the report from the National Stu
dents Association regional Execu
tive Council meeting held from
November 1-3 in Los Angeles.
Stanford has two of the nine mem
bers on the Council . . . Chuck
Martin and Ginny Titus.)
The NSA regional Domestic Com
mission has set up a Speakers Bu
reau at Mills College and Occidental
College. NSA groups at these
schools will contact such organiza
tions as the Republican and Dem
ocratic state committees, the Cham
ber of Commerce, Southern Cali
fornia All-Year Club, etc. in com
piling a complete list of noted
speakers who will be coming to
California.
By maintaining a close eye, these
subcommissions hope to know at all
times what speakers are available
for speaking engagements. Any
schcol desiring a noted speaker on
any subject, political or otherwise,
needs only to notify the subcorh
mission of its need and the arrange
ments can be made.
However, to safeguard NSA's non
partisan stand, all schools are re
quired to invite two men, one on
each side of the issue to be dis
cussed. This can take the form of
! an open forum discussion or, if that
i is not feasible, two programs held
1 as closely together as possible.
In other words, if Stanford wished
to have Henry Wallace speak on
conditions in the Near East, another
man representing the opposing
stand would be listed. This policy
of free discussion will satisfy Ex
com's decision of barring political
action groups from the campus. It
will help fill the gap left by its de
cision and further its wish that po
litical thought of a nonpartisan na
ture be encouraged.
In addition the Speakers Bureau
subcommissions are working on a
manual to aid groups on the various
campuses who will be in charge of
.these forums. Included will be
helpful material on the technique
of handling open debates, success

f'ul methods of moderating, and sug
gestions oh ways o{ protecting the
speakers from unfair questions. In
