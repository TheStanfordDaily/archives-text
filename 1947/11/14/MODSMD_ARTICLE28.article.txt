# Powerful Board of Trustees Celebrales 62nd Anniversary
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
The anniversary of ;ui extremely
powerful, much-feared, but little
known group oi men is being cele
brated on the Stanford campus to
day.
It is the Board of Trustees.
The Board is celebrating the U2nd

anniversary of iis first meeting on
Nov. 14, 1885. There is not much
noise, fanfare, or publicity attached
to this celebration.
The Board of Trustees is more
than an august body of bigwigs
whose names appeal' in I he front of
the Bawlout. They are the answer
to the frequently voiced query,
"Who runs this school?"
They do.
These 15 men run a plant worth
from 35 to 50 million dollars. For
undertaking and fulfilling this ex
treme responsibility these men re
ceive not a penny.
The trustees are Charles R. Blyth,
John Cushinp, Leland Cutler, Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel, George A. Ditz,
Paul C. Edwards, W. P. Fuller, Jr..
Mrs. Roger Goodan, Herbert Hoo
ver, Ira S. Lillick, C. O. G. Miller,
George F. Morell. Soeley G. Mudd,
Herman Phleger, and M. C. Sloss.
What do the trustees do? They
set the policy of the school and ad
ministrate according to it. They
spend the money and they make
decisions on critical issues. They
run it according to the purpose set

down by the Stanfords —to maintain
! a University of high degree.
They have made striking deci
sions, some of which will be re
membered by current students. It
was the trustees who decided to go
about obtaining Dibble Hospital
(Stanford Village) as emergency
I housing for the influx of war vets
|on the Farm. It was the trustees
I who decreed the fairly sweeping
I raise in faculty salaries. And it was
] the trustees who abolished sorori
j ties on the Stanford campus.
A trustee is qualified for his job
by a keen interest in Stanford and
the judgment, acumen, and leader-

| ship abilities that make him a suc
-1 cess in his own chosen field.
You can find men from the top
ranks ot business and professional
j life among them—they supplement
each other. They are lawyers, in
| vestment bankers, presidents of
I corporations, insurance experts,
newspaper editors, ex - Presidents,
and professors.
Being a trustee at Stanford isn't a
vague honor. It requires time and
work. Frequent committee meet
ings about finances, investment,
curricula, and so on, together with
regular full board monthly meet
, ings, demand more than casual par
ticipation.
The power of the trustees is de
rived from the grant of Stanford.
| At first, Mrs. Stanford exercised

complete power in the University
by virtue of her veto over board
decisions. But before she died, she
gave the final legal power over the
University irrevocably to the trus
tees.
All of the trustees have many af
filiations and interests aside from

their own jobs. There is a reason i
behind this. This reason illustrates
the peculiar quality which best '
qualities a man not only to admin- !
istrate the huge business of run
ning Stanford, but to lead and '
mould an institution of higher edu- j
cation:
I hey realize the Kind of world
in which they live—and they rec
ognize a vast responsibility to it.
Therefore it is with pride that :
they carry a heavier burden than \
most men. And it is with pride that j
they celebrate the anniversary of an j
institution—the Board of Trustees—
which allows them to fulfill that re
sponsibility.

to the frequently voiced query,
"Who runs this school?"
They do.
These 15 men run a plant worth
from 35 to 50 million dollars. For
undertaking and fulfilling this ex
treme responsibility these men re
ceive not a penny.
The trustees are Charles R. Blyth,
John Cushinp, Leland Cutler, Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel, George A. Ditz,
Paul C. Edwards, W. P. Fuller, Jr..
Mrs. Roger Goodan, Herbert Hoo
ver, Ira S. Lillick, C. O. G. Miller,
George F. Morell. Soeley G. Mudd,
Herman Phleger, and M. C. Sloss.
What do the trustees do? They
set the policy of the school and ad
ministrate according to it. They
spend the money and they make
decisions on critical issues. They
run it according to the purpose set

down by the Stanfords —to maintain
! a University of high degree.
They have made striking deci
sions, some of which will be re
membered by current students. It
was the trustees who decided to go
about obtaining Dibble Hospital
(Stanford Village) as emergency
I housing for the influx of war vets
|on the Farm. It was the trustees
I who decreed the fairly sweeping
I raise in faculty salaries. And it was
] the trustees who abolished sorori
j ties on the Stanford campus.
A trustee is qualified for his job
by a keen interest in Stanford and
the judgment, acumen, and leader-

| ship abilities that make him a suc
-1 cess in his own chosen field.
You can find men from the top
ranks ot business and professional
j life among them—they supplement
each other. They are lawyers, in
| vestment bankers, presidents of
I corporations, insurance experts,
newspaper editors, ex - Presidents,
and professors.
Being a trustee at Stanford isn't a
vague honor. It requires time and
work. Frequent committee meet
ings about finances, investment,
curricula, and so on, together with
regular full board monthly meet
, ings, demand more than casual par
ticipation.
The power of the trustees is de
rived from the grant of Stanford.
| At first, Mrs. Stanford exercised

complete power in the University
by virtue of her veto over board
decisions. But before she died, she
gave the final legal power over the
University irrevocably to the trus
tees.
All of the trustees have many af
filiations and interests aside from

their own jobs. There is a reason i
behind this. This reason illustrates
the peculiar quality which best '
qualities a man not only to admin- !
istrate the huge business of run
ning Stanford, but to lead and '
mould an institution of higher edu- j
cation:
I hey realize the Kind of world
in which they live—and they rec
ognize a vast responsibility to it.
Therefore it is with pride that :
they carry a heavier burden than \
most men. And it is with pride that j
they celebrate the anniversary of an j
institution—the Board of Trustees—
which allows them to fulfill that re
sponsibility.
