Tlie Honor Code Committee rec
ommendation Wednesday night at
Excom that students be required to
take an examination in the room
in which it is given if seating facili
ties are adequate, and subject to
the discretion of the instructor, was
not approved on the grounds that it
was not in keeping with the spirit
of the Honor Code.
The recommendation was made
by the committee because they felt
that the increased enrollment made
it impossible to carry to all students
the spirit of the Honor Code, and
thus it was wise to do away with
unnecessary temptation. The com
mittee also felt that there was a
lack of third-person responsibility
in taking exams out of the rooms.
Excom members believed that the
Honor Code is a unity which in
cludes individual responsibility, and
any restriction such as this would
lessen this responsibility.
\XE CASE
Tom Martzlofl said that the Axe
case will be shipped back to the
company, which will replace it at
their expense with a new case
which will met the specifications.
Excom voted to retain the origi
nal mounting for the plaque and the
Axe, since the new one didn't look
well, and a sentimental value was !
attached to the old mounting.
Excom rejected the charter of the !
proposed Stanford chapter of the
PCA upon the recommendation of
Ted Norton, who heads a committee
on charters and constitutions. Jack
Rich, Bob Hoyt, and Bob Brown are i
other members of this committee.
?CA CHARTER
This committee reported that the
proposed charter came within the
definition of Excom's policy against
partisan political action groups on
campus. Any local chapter of PCA
must either advocate or remain si

lent on national policies, and they
must advocate some of them or
there is no reason for their exist
ence. The national organization does
take a partisan stand on national is
sues.
PCA's primary objective is politi
cal action. Consequently the local
chapter was rejected, with one dis
senting vote, on all three points of
partisan, political, and action.
PAJAMARINO
There was general debate in the
Excom meeting as to who should
pay the damages for the Pajamarino
— the ASSU. or individual living j
groups. The recommended per
centages of assessment made in the i
Tuesday night meeting were unofli- j
cial and were only recommenda
tions to the Council for Student
Control.
After Jim Welch, Men's Council '
head, pointed out that the Council ;
could, and probably would, assess j
the ASSU for part of the damages,
Excom voted to turn the matter
over to them. Welch told students
that Council would call in witnesses
and that every living group consid
ered for assessment would be given [
an opportunity to speak for itself.
FROSH PLAN
The freshman plan for next year's
Pajamarino proposed that it be a
rally for the Little Big Game and
that it be only for freshmen and j
sophomores. It was pointed out that j
the Pajamarino has always been an j
all-campus function, and that it is i
not intended solely for the fresh- ;
men.
After various recommendations |
from the head of the student police |
and Excom members, the Pajama
rino committee was appointed.

must either advocate or remain si

lent on national policies, and they
must advocate some of them or
there is no reason for their exist
ence. The national organization does
take a partisan stand on national is

PCA's primary objective is politi

chapter was rejected, with one dis

partisan, political, and action.
PAJAMARINO
There was general debate in the
Excom meeting as to who should
pay the damages for the Pajamarino
— the ASSU. or individual living j
groups. The recommended per
centages of assessment made in the i
Tuesday night meeting were unofli- j
cial and were only recommenda
tions to the Council for Student
Control.
After Jim Welch, Men's Council '
head, pointed out that the Council ;
could, and probably would, assess j
the ASSU for part of the damages,
Excom voted to turn the matter
over to them. Welch told students
that Council would call in witnesses
and that every living group consid
ered for assessment would be given [
an opportunity to speak for itself.
FROSH PLAN
The freshman plan for next year's
Pajamarino proposed that it be a
rally for the Little Big Game and
that it be only for freshmen and j
sophomores. It was pointed out that j
the Pajamarino has always been an j
all-campus function, and that it is i
not intended solely for the fresh- ;
men.
After various recommendations |
from the head of the student police |
and Excom members, the Pajama
rino committee was appointed.

Tlie Honor Code Committee rec
ommendation Wednesday night at
Excom that students be required to
take an examination in the room
in which it is given if seating facili
ties are adequate, and subject to
the discretion of the instructor, was
not approved on the grounds that it
was not in keeping with the spirit
of the Honor Code.
The recommendation was made
by the committee because they felt
that the increased enrollment made
it impossible to carry to all students
the spirit of the Honor Code, and
thus it was wise to do away with
unnecessary temptation. The com
mittee also felt that there was a
lack of third-person responsibility
in taking exams out of the rooms.
Excom members believed that the
Honor Code is a unity which in
cludes individual responsibility, and
any restriction such as this would
lessen this responsibility.
\XE CASE
Tom Martzlofl said that the Axe
case will be shipped back to the
company, which will replace it at
their expense with a new case
which will met the specifications.
Excom voted to retain the origi
nal mounting for the plaque and the
Axe, since the new one didn't look
well, and a sentimental value was !
attached to the old mounting.
Excom rejected the charter of the !
proposed Stanford chapter of the
PCA upon the recommendation of
Ted Norton, who heads a committee
on charters and constitutions. Jack
Rich, Bob Hoyt, and Bob Brown are i
other members of this committee.
