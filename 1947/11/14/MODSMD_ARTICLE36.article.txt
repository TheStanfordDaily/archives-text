# Webfeet Fall Easy Prey To Cards of Yesteryear
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
At the turn of the century, when Fielding H. Yost, the Lafayette
terror, was directing the cardinal hue of the Stanfords, a small North
western college, Oregon by name, was introduced to its first setback of
the season.
Stanford pulverized the Lilliputian forces of Oregon, 34 to 0, despite
the efforts of Webfoot Rock Zeigler, a husky Oregon lineman who played
the best game of his career.
Perhaps it was the acknowledged supremacy of the Injuns, but it

wasn't until four years later when
Oregon and Stanford again paired
off.
The Cards poured a 35 to 0 shel
lacking onto the coals, the Ol'e
gonians remaining convinced they
could win. In 05. D. J. Chalmers,
fleet-of-foot halfback, sparked the
ebullient provincials to a 10 to 4
win.
After a relapse of some 15 years,
Stanford refaced the Ducks and
prevailed via a 10 to 0 triumph.
Dink won the ball game—Dink
Templeton, par excellence kicker
who booted a 30-yard field goal
and generally kept the Ducks deep
in their lines with successive, tow
ering punts.
During the Ernie Nevers Era,
the Red Shirts authored another
succession of wins, including a 35
to 13 win in 1925. Pop Warner
plummeted to the top of the coach
ing ladder with "the nation's most
baffling offensive."
The Indians rolled on unhindered.

If monotony was ever intended for Cardinal success, then here was
monotony indeed, as the Cards scored their tenth consecutive win of the
series in 1928 with a 2G to 12 win.
Another powerful Stanford squad, paced by Hulfback Herbie Fleish
hacker and Walt Heinecke ripped the Oregonians, 33 to 7 in 1929..
Oregon stayed at home during Stanford's Vow Boys Era, forcing
Oregon coach Prince Callison to remark later: ft s a damn good thing
we didn't play Stanford then."
The Cards met their "come-uppance" in 1936 when both teams
roared to a 7 to 7 deadlock. Joe Vigna scored for the Cards and swift
Arleigh Bentley counted for the Ducks with Dale Lasselle adding the
record-making extra point.
Oregon engineered its first win aver the Red Shirts in 1937 with a
7 to 6 decision. Jay Graybeal went over for Oregon and Guard Joe
Huston kicked the additional point.
Segments of the Wow Boys—Hugh Gallurneau, Norm Standlee, and
Stan Graff—dominated the 27 to 16 win which was directed by good
natured Tiny Thornhill.
In '39. Oregon, surprisingly enough, managed to upset the Cards,
10 to 0, Duke Iverson and Curt Mechain having a big hand in the prp
ceedings.
It is indeed useless to dwell upon Stanford's 13 to 0 win in 1940. Or
better still, one may casually recount tales of heriocs penned by Frank
Albert, Chuck Taylor, and Vic Landskog.
When the provincials returned from the Rose Bowl on the first day
it, 1941, Oregon again was waiting for the Injuns, waiting to receive a
19 to 15 loss. It was a strange season. The Cards were top heavy favor
ites and nearly blew the duke in Tex Oliver's bowout campaign in the
Northwest.
