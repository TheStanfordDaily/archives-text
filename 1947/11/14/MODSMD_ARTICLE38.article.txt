# Leicht's Runs, Van Brocklin's Passes Comprise the Ducks' One-Two Punch
## 
### 
Two of the finest backs 'on the
Coast will be on display tomorrow
afternoon in Stanford Stadium.
Norm Van Brocklin, top punter and
passer in the Conference, and Jake
Leicht, who leads the league in
rushing, scoring, and punt returns,
will spark the Oregon Webfeet in
in their meeting with Stanford.
Van Brocklin, a big sophomore
quarterback, is currently leading the
PCC punting department with an
average boot of 41.7 yards. He al
so leads the league passers, com
pleting 44.2 percent of his aerial
offering for 785 net yards gained.
Jack Leicht, speedy 165-pound
halfback, leads the league's ground
gaining 521 yards for an average of
5.6 per carry. He leads the scorers,
tallying 45 points on 6 touchdowns
and 9 conversions. Leicht is tops
in punt returns, having run back
28 punts 373 yards for a 13.5 aver
age. The diminutive Webfoot also
ranks second in kickoff returns.
Rounding out the probable start
ing Duck backfield will be Jim New
quist at right half and powerful
Bob Koch at fullback A second
quartet, nearly as good as the first,
finds 200-pound De Wayne Johnson
at quarter, Keith DcCourcey and
George Bell at the halves, and Bob
Sanders at fullback.
Oregon's rugged line averages 208
pounds. Dan Garza, one of the na
tion's top pass receivers, and Lou
Robinson are scheduled to open at
the flanks. Steve Dotur and Don
Stanton, a pair of 218-pound iron
men, will share the brunt of tackle
chores.
Ed Chrobot will open at left guard,
gainers. He is first in rushing,
while Jim Berwick and Ted Meland
alternate at right guard. Brad Eck
lund, a burly defensive standout,
holds down the center spot.
The Ducks, after a slow start,
have won their last four games.
Winning their opener against Mon
tana State, the Webfeet dropped
three in a row to mighty Texas, Ne
vada, and UCLA. However, they
bounced back into the win column
by upsetting Washington's Huskies,
and rolled over USC, Idaho, and
Washington State on the last three
Saturday afternoons.


Here is Oregon's JAKE LEICHT rated by many of the sports experts
as "professional'' in the collegiate ranks. Jake has been besieged by
pro scouts tbis year and for a good reason—he leads the conference in
scoring and rushnig. His next assignment: the Stanford Indians at
Palo Alto tomorrow.
