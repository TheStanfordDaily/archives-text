# Three Daily Experts Nominate --Of All Teams--Cards to Win!
## 
### 
The Daily's sports stuff hit the
prediction bulls-eye last week with
a perfect 13 winners out of 13 games
picked. As a result the pickers'
average has vaulted 56 percentage
points to .781, with a consensus to
tal of 50 wins, 14 losses and 4 ties.
"Bank-buster" Bill Swigart still
maintains his comfortable lead over
the rest of the scribes. He has a
fantastic .857 percentage for the
season.
This week's picks:
STANFORD-OREGON: This is
one prediction we wouldn't mind
being wrong on. Three experts tab
the Indians to notch their first win
of the season against the Webfoots,
but the other eight string along
with the favorite.
Consensus: Oregon by 4 points.
ARMY-PENN: The Quakers are
very strong this year. Army is way
past its war-time peak. The Cadets
have been beaten twice already in
the 15)47 campaign, and Penn should
make it three.
Consensus: Penn by 10 points.
MICHIGAN - WISCONSIN: The
Badgers have come a long way since
their humiliating defeat by Califor
nia. They now have the second best
team in the Big Nine. Who has the
best? Michigan.
Consensus: Michigan by 17 points.
SANTA CLARA - ST. MARY'S:
These two arch-foes get together
for their annual "Little Big Game"
Sunday in Kezar Stadium. As is the
case in all traditional rivalries, any
thing can happenâ€”and often does.
Nine scribes look for a Bronco vic
tory despite Santa Clara's recent
subnormal performances.
Consensus: Santa Clara by 7
points.
! CAL-MONTANA: A good big
team against a good little team.
Montana beat Washington Slate and
! Idaho in its only conference starts,
j but Cal should be able to put a con
! vincing end to the Grizzlies' un
beaten PCC string.
Consensus: California by 2(5 points.
UCLA - WASHINGTON: The
Bruins have been made unanimous
choice for this one, but in retro
spect the scribes are not so certain
their choice was a wise one. UCLA
might well be looking over the
Huskies toward the USC game next
week, and Washington is still a
threat despite its mediocre won
| lost record.
Consensus: UCLA by 14 points.
Other predictions:
ILLINOIS over Ohio State by 17.
MINNESOTA over lowa by 13.
NOTRE DAME over Northwest
ern by 22.
PURDUE over Pitt by 17.


liig JIM NEWQUIST runs from the right half spot for the University
of Oregon. Rated as one of the top backs on the coast last year, Jim has
gotten off to a slow start this season. He's starting to roll now and
according to Ins coach Jifcn Aiken he will give the Cards plenty of
trouble tomorrow at the Farm stadium.
