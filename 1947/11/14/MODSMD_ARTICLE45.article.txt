# Injury-Ridden Water Poloists Tackle Bears
## 
### 
With the services of three of its
key players in doubt, Stanford's
league leading varsity water polo
team will journey to Berkeley to
morrow morning, determined to
sweep both ends of their two game
series with Cal—a trick that their
Farm predecessors have been able
to turn only once in the past 13
years.
After Stanford won every water
polo contest it played with Cal for
21 years, the Bears finally snapped
the Indian string in 1934. Since that
time, under the tutelage of A 1 Dow
den, and more recently Hal Wea
therbe, the Cal Waterpoloists have

I been a tough nut for the Indians (
| to crack.
Now riding high atop the South- j
ern Division standings with 3 wins !
against a single defeat in conference
play, the Cards need a victory to- j
morrow in order to cinch at least a
tie for the crown.
The extent of the Indian success
tomorrow hinges largely upon the
number of "first string players that
Farm mentor Tom Haynie will be
able to play.
Starting forward Harry Borchers,
and captain Dick Narver, who have
been out all week with heavy colds,
were missed badly Wednesday night

when the Stanford squad dropped
a 10 to 7 decision to San Jose State
in the Spartan pool.
Then yesterday when it was an
nounced that Borchers would def
initely play against Cal, star for
ward Jim Armstrong turned up
with a broken thumb. X-rays must
be taken before any decision is I
made on Armstrong's playability. !
