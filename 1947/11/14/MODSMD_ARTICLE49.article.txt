# Let the Women Root, Too
## 
### 
The women rooters deserve a break.
Of the 1,800 women students at Stanford a
large percentage attend the foodball games.
Most of them would like to yell and sing along
with the male rooting section.
However, the three yell leaders group them
selves in front of the men, making it difficult
for the female contingent to follow the yells.
We are aiming for the best possible organized
rooting section. One yell leader standing in

front of the women would coordinate both
sections.
Other Pacific Coast Conference schools use
yell leaders in front of their entire rooting
sections, but Stanford leaves the women to fol
low as well as they can.
A loudspeaker pointing to the extra rooting
section and a yell leader situated in front of
it would increase the effectiveness of all the
songs and yells.—M.S.
