### ALLEN BLETZ 
The issue of military training is usually pre
sented as one between national security and moral,
philosophical, and political objections to brass hats.
If such training really is essential for our safety
then* can be little doubt that we should have it.
The burden of proof, however, is upon its advo
cates and they have not proved it satisfactorily.
Their arguments consistently ignore the nature of the
training.
What is now called UMT and what we used to
call "basic" has three purposes: to develop physical
stamina, to teach a minimum of military skills and
to build discipline.
The last of these aims has never been accom
plished. Under sufficient pressure from above sol
diers could be regimented but when they got up
to the front they became an extremely independent
minded fighting group. That they accomplished so
much on the battle fronts with relatively little dis
cipline speaks well for Americans and not so well
for West Point theorists.
Physical endurance is clearly of no significance
in a long-range peace-time program. Endurance is
a temporary quality. It is important only when you
send men directly from training into combat. Sup
pose you teach Joe Doakes this year to hike twenty
miles and sleep for a week in a mudhole without

getting pneumonia. This will be of no use to Joe
ten, or even five, years from now unless he eon
scientiously practices walking twenty miles and
sleeping in mudholes after he finishes training. Do
you seriously think he will?
Possibly military skills are retained longer than
physical stamina. In basic training we learned the
use and care of the M-l and were given a super
ficial familiarity with other weapons. When I got
up to the front they gave me a tommy gun which
I had never seen outside the movies.
But even if we grant that it is a good idea to
have all men know a little about the weapons with
which they will have to defend themselves in case
of attack, that does not prove that every young man
should spend a year or six months in the army.
Most of our infantry during the war had 17 weeks
training or less (many only five or six). They did
pretty well. Out of the total training time perhaps
one week was spent on weapons and other skills.
The rest was spent on marching, drilling, inspect
ing, KP. and lectures on various subjects which
were promptly forgotten the next day.
If the generals and their supporters would advo
cate a one week training I would back them. To
demand much more than that is to ask the Ameri
can people to waste their time, money, and energy
for the greater glory of braid and brass.
