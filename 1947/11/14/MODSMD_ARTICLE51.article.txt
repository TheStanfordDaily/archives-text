# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
A great majority of the campus undoubtedly will
contribute to this week's Relief Fund Drive, and
probably the drive will net its $12,000 goal. How
ever, very few people will have given a thought to
the meaning of their contribution.
Only too often self-satisfied students, after
rificing" a dollar, ask where the money is going;
or living groups, smug in the "spirit of giving,'' allo
cate funds out of the treasury; or individuals a.*;k
their friends what they have given, in order to dis
cover the "proper" sum to contribute.
This giving without thinking makes all Stanford
drives only partially successful. A truly successful
drive always contains two factors!
(1) Understanding and full awareness of the need
by every individual.
(2) Individuals endowed with financial resources.
At Stanford there is little of number one and lots
of number two. If Stanfordites with only vague good
intentions can contribute $12,000 for relief, think
what Stanfordites fully educated in and actively
sympathetic to the needs of charity would con
tribute. If such were ever the case, there would be
no need for fixed goals in drives. Thus drives at
Stanford usually reach their goals but never make
what they could and should make.
The current Stanford Relief Fund Drive is col

lecting money for worthy causes. Stanfordites should
acquaint ther. selves thoroughly with these causes.
They should give according to the need, not according
to the quota.
