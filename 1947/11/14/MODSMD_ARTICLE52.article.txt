To the Editor:
We agree, we agree heartily, but what can we
do? We don't like to make dates two weeks in ad
vance any better than the men do, but if we refuse
once, we aren't asked again.
We feel that there should be a gentlemen's agree
ment that no dates be made before Monday pre
ceding the weekend, except for special occasions,
e.g. Big Game weekend and formats. This gives
every man an equal opportunity. The men seem to
want this, and we women definitely do.
It will be necessary to carry the honor code over
to dating, because obviously this system won't work
unless every man, woman and child (class of '51)
observes this.
Let's make our slogan "N D T M N" (No dates
'til Monday night.)
