Warren said he would allow a
delegation pledged to him to be
entered in the California primary
election next year and would "be
proud to have it present my name
to the convention."
He said, however, that he would
not be active in the pie-convention

did not say what he would do if
others sought delegates for him in
other states, but said "there has
been no movement to do that that
I am informed of."

be placed in nomination.
