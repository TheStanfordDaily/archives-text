# Axe Yell's Origin 2,000 Years Old; Aristophanes Inspired Famed Chant
## 
### MARGE SAMPSON 
The origin of Stanford's "Axe
Yell'' goes back more than two
thousand years to the time when
Aristophanes wrote his play "The
Frogs." A constant refrain through
out this classical comedy, "Brek
i ek-koax-koax," was Will Irwin's
inspiration for "Give 'cm the A*xe,
I the Axe. the Axe," which has been
| the Indians' scalping cry since 180(j.
The yell taunted the California
rooting sections for three years be
fore Billy Erb, off - football season
cheer leader, fonnd an Axe to sym
bolize the yell. In 189!) George
Beckett, star and captain of the
baseball team, died just as the sea
son opened. Spirit dropped as Stan
ford faced a championship series
with California against heavy odds.
When the first game was lost, spirit
in both the team and the rooters
sank even lower.
In an attempt to revitalize school

spirit, Erb organized a rally just he
fore the next game. The Axe Yell
was to be the theme of the rally,
but Erb decided that something
more concrete was needed. The
Axe, a rusty, 10-pound, 16-inch
blade, was it.
The blade, states the best story
of the founding of the Axe, was
brought in from the outlying foot
hills as scrap metal for old engi
neering forges. The handle, a fu
gitive from the local wood pile, was
hammered into the Axe, and the
blade was painted a Cardinal red.
And, as a symbol of victory, the
edge of the Axe was ground razor
sharp and, to the tune of the Axe
Yell, was used to chop off the head
of a Golden Bear efligy.
After that, everywhere the team
went, and everywhere the Axe Yell
was given, the Axe itself was there,

chopping through streamers of blue
and gold.
Enraged by what they termed a
"rude yell," Cal men thought it
I was adding insult to injury to dis
play the Axe. They retaliated by
stealing the Axe and keeping it for
31 years, until the "Immortal 21"
recaptured it. During this time the
Axe Yell was taken over by the
men of California and thrown in
the faces of the Stanford rooters.
When Stanford men once again
got the Axe, they claimed the Yell
for their own. and have kept it ever
since, using it when things looked
the worst, to bolster lagging spirit
and urge the team to victory.
And the superstitious feeling
still persists that when the Axe Yell
is given, the team can't help but
| come back and stop the opposition.
| The Yell has an important place in
i Stanford life: it symbolizes the
I fighting spirit of the Indians.

of the founding of the Axe, was
brought in from the outlying foot
hills as scrap metal for old engi
neering forges. The handle, a fu
gitive from the local wood pile, was
hammered into the Axe, and the
blade was painted a Cardinal red.
And, as a symbol of victory, the
edge of the Axe was ground razor
sharp and, to the tune of the Axe
Yell, was used to chop off the head
of a Golden Bear efligy.
After that, everywhere the team
went, and everywhere the Axe Yell
was given, the Axe itself was there,

chopping through streamers of blue
and gold.
Enraged by what they termed a
"rude yell," Cal men thought it
I was adding insult to injury to dis
play the Axe. They retaliated by
stealing the Axe and keeping it for
31 years, until the "Immortal 21"
recaptured it. During this time the
Axe Yell was taken over by the
men of California and thrown in
the faces of the Stanford rooters.
When Stanford men once again
got the Axe, they claimed the Yell
for their own. and have kept it ever
since, using it when things looked
the worst, to bolster lagging spirit
and urge the team to victory.
And the superstitious feeling
still persists that when the Axe Yell
is given, the team can't help but
| come back and stop the opposition.
| The Yell has an important place in
i Stanford life: it symbolizes the
I fighting spirit of the Indians.
The origin of Stanford's "Axe
Yell'' goes back more than two
thousand years to the time when
Aristophanes wrote his play "The
Frogs." A constant refrain through
out this classical comedy, "Brek
i ek-koax-koax," was Will Irwin's
inspiration for "Give 'cm the A*xe,
I the Axe. the Axe," which has been
| the Indians' scalping cry since 180(j.
The yell taunted the California
rooting sections for three years be
fore Billy Erb, off - football season
cheer leader, fonnd an Axe to sym
bolize the yell. In 189!) George
Beckett, star and captain of the
baseball team, died just as the sea
son opened. Spirit dropped as Stan
ford faced a championship series
with California against heavy odds.
When the first game was lost, spirit
in both the team and the rooters
sank even lower.
In an attempt to revitalize school

spirit, Erb organized a rally just he
fore the next game. The Axe Yell
was to be the theme of the rally,
but Erb decided that something
more concrete was needed. The
Axe, a rusty, 10-pound, 16-inch
blade, was it.
The blade, states the best story
of the founding of the Axe, was
brought in from the outlying foot
hills as scrap metal for old engi
