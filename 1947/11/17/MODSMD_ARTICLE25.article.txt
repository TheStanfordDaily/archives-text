JERUSALEM, Palestine, Nov. 16
(UP). â€”Five hundred Jewish ille
gal immigrants managed to slip
through the British blockade Sat
urday night in a sailing schooner
disguised as a fishing boat, but an
other group of 704 aboard a second
vessel were intercepted at sea and
deported to Cyprus.
The refugees beached their small,
jam-packed craft on the Palestine
shore just north of the Jewish col
ony of Naljariya, five miles south of
the Lebanese border. They waded
ashore at 2 a.m. and were helped to
escape to Jewish settlements in
trucks provided by the under
ground army Haganah.
