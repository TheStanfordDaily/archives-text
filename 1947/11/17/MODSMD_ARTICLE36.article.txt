# Boys' Choir Rates Praise

### JERRY DANIELLS 
Father Flanagan's Boys' Town
Choir confirmed its nationwide mu
sical fame by turning in an able
performance Thursday night. The
audience appeared more than will
ing to remain in the Memorial Au
ditorium as long as the choir con
tinued singing.
The choir was at its best in the
presentation of Bruckner's difficult
"Te Deum Laudamus."
Under the direction of Father
Francis Schmitt, the masterfully
trained group presented the concert
without the use of a single score.
The range of the strong soprano
sections seemed to have no limit.
In Grieg's "Ave Maria Stella," the
boys took the high pitches with un
believable ease.
