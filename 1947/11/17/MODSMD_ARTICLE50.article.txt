the offensive punch to score and j
yielded the ball to the Kappa Sigs. \
The Kappa Sigs could not make |
their passing attack click and the j
see-sawed deadlock continued until !
late in the second period when Bob
Ro.sburg fired a long pass to Bob
Krohn, who caught the ball on the '
goal and stepped over for the score. '

drove to the Kappa Sigma 17, only
to have the threat choked off when
one of Rael's passes was intercepted.

the offensive punch to score and j
yielded the ball to the Kappa Sigs. \

their passing attack click and the j
see-sawed deadlock continued until !
late in the second period when Bob
Ro.sburg fired a long pass to Bob
Krohn, who caught the ball on the '

the first half and then held on the i
rest of the game to down a deter- j

moved the Kappa Sigs into a first
place tie with the DU's in League

El Toro took the opening kickofT

ning of Hank Rael. But they lacked j
the offensive punch to score and j
yielded the ball to the Kappa Sigs. \
The Kappa Sigs could not make |
their passing attack click and the j
see-sawed deadlock continued until !
late in the second period when Bob
Ro.sburg fired a long pass to Bob
Krohn, who caught the ball on the '
goal and stepped over for the score. '
In the second half the eating boys !

drove to the Kappa Sigma 17, only
to have the threat choked off when
one of Rael's passes was intercepted.
