# Santa Clara Wins
## 
### 
Santa Clara won yesterday's "Lit
tle Big Game" at Kezar Stadium
when it routed hapless St. Mary's,
33 to 9. Herman Wedemeyer, one
time Gael Ail-American, had a bad
day as his teammates found them
selves on the short end of a 19 to 0
count in tjie first quarter.
The licking was one of the worst
handed either team in the long his
tory of the rivalry. Len Casanova's
Broncos displayed a terrific open
ing burst of power and went on to
win easily.
