# Water Poloists Nose Out Cal In Hotly Contested 6 to 5 Tilt
## 
### 
Led by big forward Walt Lull, and
diminutive guard Ralph Sala, Stan
ford's powerful water polo varsity
team rolled on toward its second
straight southern division conference
championship last Saturday morning
as it downed a stubborn University
of California squad, 6 to 5, in the
Berkeley pool.
The victory assured the injury
ridden Indians a tie for the confer
ence crown and a possible undis
puted title, depending upon the out
come of next Friday's return fray
with the Berkeley Bears.
GAME A GOOD ONE
Saturday morning's contest was a
thriller all the way, with the lead
changing hands many times.
Striking with speed and deceptive
ncss, Cal tallied twice early in the
first period and appeared to be
headed for an upset win before the

Indian defenses stiffened and Stan
ford was able to strike back to tie
things up with successive goals by
Lull and Jim Armstrong.
The defenses then took over, but
Cal scored once more before the half
ended, and led at the intermission,
3 to 2.
CARDS COME BACK
In the third quarter, Stanford
roared back to tie the score on a
shot by Ralph Sala, and Walt Lull
put the Cards ahead with a beautiful
shot from the corner.
Led by high-scoring Stan Mor
ketter. the Bear mermen stubbornly
fought back to knot the count at
4-all.
Then Sala and Harry Borchers
each connected for the Indians. The
Farm men were never threatened af
ter that, although Cal managed to
score once more, before the final
whistle.
