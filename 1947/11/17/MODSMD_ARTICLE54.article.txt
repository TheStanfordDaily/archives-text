# Webfeet Too Strong for Indians; Farm Crew Suffers Eighth Defeat
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
The "new spirit" was there, but it wasn't enough, and so the
Injuns were handed their eighth straight loss, 21 to 6, by the hard
charging invaders from the University of Oregon last Saturday
afternoon in the Stadium before another sparse crowd.
But even in defeat, the Stanfordites continued to show im-

provement —their tackling was surer;
their blocking wds reliable; their of
fense was better coordinated than in
uny previous game this year. Yet
mere improvement alone was not
enough to handle the big, rugged
Oregon line that opened gaping holes
for its slashing, darting backs, and
gave ample protection for its passing
and kicking star, Norm Van Brock
lin.
Although it was Van Brocklin's
accurate arm that passed to two of
the Duck's three touchdowns, and
set up the third with an 18-yard
toss to the Stanford 13, it was the
effective Oregon ground attack, roll

ing up 223 yards from scrimmage,
that really hurt the Indian cause.
WEBFEET DRIVE
After both teams had threatened
briefly in the early minutes of the
first quarter, Oregon took the ball,
first-and-ten on (he Stanford 45-
yard line after Durket's kick had
gone out of bounds. Halfback Jim
Newquist smashed through center,
and speedy Jake Leicht slashed over
tackle for sizable chunks of yardage.
In all the Webfeet piled up three
first downs to the Indian 1(5.
Van Brock 1 in then calmly faded
back, and taking plenty of time,
threw a perfect strike to Leicht,
standing all alone on the two, who
waltzed over for Oregon's first score
without a single Indian defender
laying a hand on him. Leicht's place
ment was good, and the Webfeet led
7-0 with a minute left in the first
quarter.
Stanford's Marty Anderson re
turned Leicht's long kickoff 45 yards
right down the center and almost
broke into the clear, but was tackled
from behind on the Stanford 39. The
Indian attack failed to materialize,
and Durket was sent in to kick after
three downs had netted only seven
yards for the Indians.
STOPPED—TEMPORARILY
Oregon took over on its own 24,
and with George Bell and Leicht
alternating through center and
around right end for gains of 13,
five, 14, and 25 yards, the Ducks
rolled up three successive first downs
to Stanford's 1!) before the Indian
defenses stiffened.
Quist stopped Leicht after a four
yard gain through ccnter, Leicht's
pass to end Wayne Bartholemy was
too long, Van Brocklin's flat pass to
Bob Koeh netted only a yard, and
Dan Garza's end-around was stop
ped by Quist and Anderson inches
short of a first down.
But the Oregon team was not to
be denied. Alter both teams tem
porarily bogged down on the soggy
turf, the Webfeet again began to roll
toward the Indian endzone.
VISITORS SCORE AGAIN
Starting on their own 3G, with
Leicht, Bell, and Van Brocklin car
rying the offensive load, Oregon put
together four first downs to go to
the Indian 24.
Ihe Stanford line held on one
play over right guard, and after
Leicht juggled and dropped a long
pass from Van Brocklin in the end
zone, it appeared as if the Card de
fenses might hold again. But on the
next play, Van Brocklin again found
an Oregon receiver, end Larry Sto
ven, all alone on the goal line, and
the Webfeet had seven more points.
Stanford's only real first half
threat came in the opening minutes
of the first period when defensive
halfback Don Campbell intercepted
a pass on the Stanford 30. and be
hind some fine blocking by Bob An
derson returned 2(5 yards to the Ore
gon 44. Ken Peck shifted right end
for 16 yards and a first down on the

feet
Oregon 28 and it looked as if the
Indians were on their way.
However, the Red Machine sput
tered, choked, and died. Zappettini
lost one yard trying to run over
right guard. Bob Anderson was stop
ped for a two-yard loss by Oregon's
fine end Dan Garza, and Bell's
passes to Quist and Erickson were
knocked down.
Behind 14 to 0. the Indians re
turned stronger in the second half, j
but it was simply a case of locking
the barn after the horse had been j
stolen.
Stanford got its big chance when
Quist recovered an Oregon fumble i
on the Oregon 34, halfway through
the third period, but. the Indian
attack again faltered after several
quick openers by Bob Anderson, a
pass from Bell to Quist. and a nice
fake pass handoff to Marty Ander
son carried the ball down to the six.

Van Brocklin immediately kicked i
to Campbell who returned 10 to the I
Oregon 34 as the third quarter ended.
INDIANS TALLY
After a pass from Bell to Eiick
son and a line plunge by Bobby
Andersen netted the Indians a first ;
down on the 23. B *11 struck through
the air to hit end Dan Mervin in the
end zone for a Stanford touchdown.
However, it was ruled that the In
dian backfield had been in motion,
and the ball was taken back to the
27.
On the next play Bell was badly
rushed by the entire Duck forward
wall, but managed to get away a
high pass that was srmtched on the
one by Wayne Erickson, who fell
across the goal line for Stanford's
only score of the day. Mervin's try
for-point was wide.
The final score of the day came a
i few plays later when Oregon center
Brad Eklund intercepted one of
I Ainslie Bell's passes on the Stan-
I ford 30. Van Brocklin's pass was
| taken by Garza on the 13, and sub
| fullback Bob Sanders smashed hard
over his own right guard, cut back
sharply to the right, and sped across
] the goal line standing up.
Treated to a fine exhibition of good
backfield play, the Cards came out
of the contest a lot smarter and at
the same time no worse off phys
ically. For according to trainer Con
rad Jarvis, there were no injuries
outside of the usual bumps and
bruises.
Coaeh Marchie Schwartz stated
that he was pleased with the per
formances of linemen Dan Mervin,
j and Atherton Phleger, and with the
i defensive performances of Ken Peck,
George Quist, and Don Campbell.
Halfback George Quist has been

porarily bogged down on the soggy
turf, the Webfeet again began to roll
toward the Indian endzone.
VISITORS SCORE AGAIN
Starting on their own 3G, with
Leicht, Bell, and Van Brocklin car
rying the offensive load, Oregon put
together four first downs to go to
the Indian 24.
Ihe Stanford line held on one
play over right guard, and after
Leicht juggled and dropped a long
pass from Van Brocklin in the end
zone, it appeared as if the Card de
fenses might hold again. But on the
next play, Van Brocklin again found
an Oregon receiver, end Larry Sto
ven, all alone on the goal line, and
the Webfeet had seven more points.
Stanford's only real first half
threat came in the opening minutes
of the first period when defensive
halfback Don Campbell intercepted
a pass on the Stanford 30. and be
hind some fine blocking by Bob An
derson returned 2(5 yards to the Ore
gon 44. Ken Peck shifted right end
for 16 yards and a first down on the

feet
Oregon 28 and it looked as if the
Indians were on their way.
However, the Red Machine sput
tered, choked, and died. Zappettini
lost one yard trying to run over
right guard. Bob Anderson was stop
ped for a two-yard loss by Oregon's
fine end Dan Garza, and Bell's
passes to Quist and Erickson were
knocked down.
Behind 14 to 0. the Indians re
turned stronger in the second half, j
but it was simply a case of locking
the barn after the horse had been j
stolen.
Stanford got its big chance when
Quist recovered an Oregon fumble i
on the Oregon 34, halfway through
the third period, but. the Indian
attack again faltered after several
quick openers by Bob Anderson, a
pass from Bell to Quist. and a nice
fake pass handoff to Marty Ander
son carried the ball down to the six.

Van Brocklin immediately kicked i
to Campbell who returned 10 to the I
Oregon 34 as the third quarter ended.
INDIANS TALLY
After a pass from Bell to Eiick
son and a line plunge by Bobby
Andersen netted the Indians a first ;
down on the 23. B *11 struck through
the air to hit end Dan Mervin in the
end zone for a Stanford touchdown.
However, it was ruled that the In
dian backfield had been in motion,
and the ball was taken back to the
27.
On the next play Bell was badly
rushed by the entire Duck forward
wall, but managed to get away a
high pass that was srmtched on the
one by Wayne Erickson, who fell
across the goal line for Stanford's
only score of the day. Mervin's try
for-point was wide.
The final score of the day came a
i few plays later when Oregon center
Brad Eklund intercepted one of
I Ainslie Bell's passes on the Stan-
I ford 30. Van Brocklin's pass was
| taken by Garza on the 13, and sub
| fullback Bob Sanders smashed hard
over his own right guard, cut back
sharply to the right, and sped across
] the goal line standing up.
Treated to a fine exhibition of good
backfield play, the Cards came out
of the contest a lot smarter and at
the same time no worse off phys
ically. For according to trainer Con
rad Jarvis, there were no injuries
outside of the usual bumps and

But even in defeat, the Stanfordites continued to show im-

provement —their tackling was surer;
their blocking wds reliable; their of
fense was better coordinated than in
uny previous game this year. Yet
mere improvement alone was not
enough to handle the big, rugged
Oregon line that opened gaping holes
for its slashing, darting backs, and
gave ample protection for its passing
and kicking star, Norm Van Brock
lin.
Although it was Van Brocklin's
accurate arm that passed to two of
the Duck's three touchdowns, and
set up the third with an 18-yard
toss to the Stanford 13, it was the
effective Oregon ground attack, roll

ing up 223 yards from scrimmage,
that really hurt the Indian cause.
WEBFEET DRIVE
After both teams had threatened
briefly in the early minutes of the
first quarter, Oregon took the ball,
first-and-ten on (he Stanford 45-
yard line after Durket's kick had
gone out of bounds. Halfback Jim
Newquist smashed through center,
and speedy Jake Leicht slashed over
tackle for sizable chunks of yardage.
In all the Webfeet piled up three
first downs to the Indian 1(5.
Van Brock 1 in then calmly faded
back, and taking plenty of time,
threw a perfect strike to Leicht,
standing all alone on the two, who

Quist stopped Leicht after a four

GEORGE QUIST. 210 - pound

The "new spirit" was there, but it wasn't enough, and so the
Injuns were handed their eighth straight loss, 21 to 6, by the hard
charging invaders from the University of Oregon last Saturday
afternoon in the Stadium before another sparse crowd.
But even in defeat, the Stanfordites continued to show im-

provement —their tackling was surer;
their blocking wds reliable; their of
fense was better coordinated than in
uny previous game this year. Yet
mere improvement alone was not
enough to handle the big, rugged
Oregon line that opened gaping holes
for its slashing, darting backs, and
gave ample protection for its passing
and kicking star, Norm Van Brock
lin.
Although it was Van Brocklin's
accurate arm that passed to two of
the Duck's three touchdowns, and
set up the third with an 18-yard
toss to the Stanford 13, it was the
effective Oregon ground attack, roll

ing up 223 yards from scrimmage,
that really hurt the Indian cause.
WEBFEET DRIVE
After both teams had threatened
briefly in the early minutes of the
first quarter, Oregon took the ball,
first-and-ten on (he Stanford 45-
yard line after Durket's kick had
gone out of bounds. Halfback Jim
Newquist smashed through center,
and speedy Jake Leicht slashed over
tackle for sizable chunks of yardage.
In all the Webfeet piled up three
first downs to the Indian 1(5.
Van Brock 1 in then calmly faded
back, and taking plenty of time,
threw a perfect strike to Leicht,
standing all alone on the two, who
waltzed over for Oregon's first score
without a single Indian defender
laying a hand on him. Leicht's place
ment was good, and the Webfeet led
7-0 with a minute left in the first
quarter.
Stanford's Marty Anderson re
turned Leicht's long kickoff 45 yards
right down the center and almost
broke into the clear, but was tackled
from behind on the Stanford 39. The
Indian attack failed to materialize,
and Durket was sent in to kick after
three downs had netted only seven
yards for the Indians.
STOPPED—TEMPORARILY
Oregon took over on its own 24,
and with George Bell and Leicht
alternating through center and
around right end for gains of 13,
five, 14, and 25 yards, the Ducks
rolled up three successive first downs
to Stanford's 1!) before the Indian
defenses stiffened.
Quist stopped Leicht after a four
yard gain through ccnter, Leicht's
pass to end Wayne Bartholemy was
too long, Van Brocklin's flat pass to
Bob Koeh netted only a yard, and
Dan Garza's end-around was stop
ped by Quist and Anderson inches
short of a first down.
But the Oregon team was not to
be denied. Alter both teams tem
porarily bogged down on the soggy
turf, the Webfeet again began to roll
toward the Indian endzone.
VISITORS SCORE AGAIN
Starting on their own 3G, with
Leicht, Bell, and Van Brocklin car
rying the offensive load, Oregon put
together four first downs to go to
the Indian 24.
Ihe Stanford line held on one
play over right guard, and after
Leicht juggled and dropped a long
pass from Van Brocklin in the end
zone, it appeared as if the Card de
fenses might hold again. But on the
next play, Van Brocklin again found
an Oregon receiver, end Larry Sto
ven, all alone on the goal line, and
the Webfeet had seven more points.
Stanford's only real first half
threat came in the opening minutes
of the first period when defensive
halfback Don Campbell intercepted
a pass on the Stanford 30. and be
hind some fine blocking by Bob An
derson returned 2(5 yards to the Ore
gon 44. Ken Peck shifted right end
for 16 yards and a first down on the

feet
Oregon 28 and it looked as if the
Indians were on their way.
However, the Red Machine sput
tered, choked, and died. Zappettini
lost one yard trying to run over
right guard. Bob Anderson was stop
ped for a two-yard loss by Oregon's
fine end Dan Garza, and Bell's
passes to Quist and Erickson were
knocked down.
Behind 14 to 0. the Indians re
turned stronger in the second half, j
but it was simply a case of locking
the barn after the horse had been j
stolen.
Stanford got its big chance when
Quist recovered an Oregon fumble i
on the Oregon 34, halfway through
the third period, but. the Indian
attack again faltered after several
quick openers by Bob Anderson, a
pass from Bell to Quist. and a nice
fake pass handoff to Marty Ander
son carried the ball down to the six.

Van Brocklin immediately kicked i
to Campbell who returned 10 to the I
Oregon 34 as the third quarter ended.
INDIANS TALLY
After a pass from Bell to Eiick
son and a line plunge by Bobby
Andersen netted the Indians a first ;
down on the 23. B *11 struck through
the air to hit end Dan Mervin in the
end zone for a Stanford touchdown.
However, it was ruled that the In
dian backfield had been in motion,
and the ball was taken back to the
27.
On the next play Bell was badly
rushed by the entire Duck forward
wall, but managed to get away a
high pass that was srmtched on the
one by Wayne Erickson, who fell
across the goal line for Stanford's
only score of the day. Mervin's try
for-point was wide.

standing all alone on the two, who
waltzed over for Oregon's first score
without a single Indian defender
laying a hand on him. Leicht's place
ment was good, and the Webfeet led
7-0 with a minute left in the first
quarter.
Stanford's Marty Anderson re
turned Leicht's long kickoff 45 yards
right down the center and almost
broke into the clear, but was tackled
from behind on the Stanford 39. The
Indian attack failed to materialize,
and Durket was sent in to kick after
three downs had netted only seven
yards for the Indians.
STOPPED—TEMPORARILY
Oregon took over on its own 24,
and with George Bell and Leicht
alternating through center and
around right end for gains of 13,
five, 14, and 25 yards, the Ducks
rolled up three successive first downs
to Stanford's 1!) before the Indian
defenses stiffened.
Quist stopped Leicht after a four
yard gain through ccnter, Leicht's
pass to end Wayne Bartholemy was
too long, Van Brocklin's flat pass to
Bob Koeh netted only a yard, and
Dan Garza's end-around was stop
ped by Quist and Anderson inches
short of a first down.
But the Oregon team was not to
be denied. Alter both teams tem
porarily bogged down on the soggy
turf, the Webfeet again began to roll
toward the Indian endzone.
VISITORS SCORE AGAIN
Starting on their own 3G, with
Leicht, Bell, and Van Brocklin car
rying the offensive load, Oregon put
together four first downs to go to
the Indian 24.
Ihe Stanford line held on one
play over right guard, and after
Leicht juggled and dropped a long
pass from Van Brocklin in the end
zone, it appeared as if the Card de
fenses might hold again. But on the
next play, Van Brocklin again found
an Oregon receiver, end Larry Sto
ven, all alone on the goal line, and
the Webfeet had seven more points.
Stanford's only real first half
threat came in the opening minutes
of the first period when defensive
halfback Don Campbell intercepted
a pass on the Stanford 30. and be
hind some fine blocking by Bob An
derson returned 2(5 yards to the Ore
gon 44. Ken Peck shifted right end
for 16 yards and a first down on the

feet
Oregon 28 and it looked as if the
Indians were on their way.
However, the Red Machine sput
tered, choked, and died. Zappettini
lost one yard trying to run over
right guard. Bob Anderson was stop
ped for a two-yard loss by Oregon's
fine end Dan Garza, and Bell's
passes to Quist and Erickson were
knocked down.
Behind 14 to 0. the Indians re
turned stronger in the second half, j
but it was simply a case of locking
the barn after the horse had been j
stolen.
Stanford got its big chance when
Quist recovered an Oregon fumble i
on the Oregon 34, halfway through
the third period, but. the Indian
attack again faltered after several
quick openers by Bob Anderson, a
pass from Bell to Quist. and a nice
fake pass handoff to Marty Ander
son carried the ball down to the six.

Van Brocklin immediately kicked i
to Campbell who returned 10 to the I
Oregon 34 as the third quarter ended.
INDIANS TALLY
After a pass from Bell to Eiick
son and a line plunge by Bobby
Andersen netted the Indians a first ;
down on the 23. B *11 struck through
the air to hit end Dan Mervin in the
end zone for a Stanford touchdown.
However, it was ruled that the In
dian backfield had been in motion,
and the ball was taken back to the
27.
On the next play Bell was badly
rushed by the entire Duck forward
wall, but managed to get away a
high pass that was srmtched on the
one by Wayne Erickson, who fell
across the goal line for Stanford's
only score of the day. Mervin's try
for-point was wide.
The final score of the day came a
i few plays later when Oregon center
Brad Eklund intercepted one of
I Ainslie Bell's passes on the Stan-
I ford 30. Van Brocklin's pass was
| taken by Garza on the 13, and sub
| fullback Bob Sanders smashed hard
over his own right guard, cut back
sharply to the right, and sped across
] the goal line standing up.
Treated to a fine exhibition of good
backfield play, the Cards came out
of the contest a lot smarter and at
the same time no worse off phys
ically. For according to trainer Con
rad Jarvis, there were no injuries
outside of the usual bumps and
bruises.
Coaeh Marchie Schwartz stated
that he was pleased with the per
formances of linemen Dan Mervin,
j and Atherton Phleger, and with the
i defensive performances of Ken Peck,
George Quist, and Don Campbell.
Halfback George Quist has been

GEORGE QUIST. 210 - pound

hrilliani defensive performance
Saturday in Stanford's losing
struggle with Oregon.


MARTY ANDERSON, Stanford

last Saturday. The Cardinal back

153 yards gained against the Web-
The "new spirit" was there, but it wasn't enough, and so the
Injuns were handed their eighth straight loss, 21 to 6, by the hard
charging invaders from the University of Oregon last Saturday
afternoon in the Stadium before another sparse crowd.
But even in defeat, the Stanfordites continued to show im-

provement —their tackling was surer;
their blocking wds reliable; their of
fense was better coordinated than in
uny previous game this year. Yet
mere improvement alone was not
enough to handle the big, rugged
Oregon line that opened gaping holes
for its slashing, darting backs, and
gave ample protection for its passing
and kicking star, Norm Van Brock
lin.
Although it was Van Brocklin's
accurate arm that passed to two of
the Duck's three touchdowns, and
set up the third with an 18-yard
toss to the Stanford 13, it was the
effective Oregon ground attack, roll

ing up 223 yards from scrimmage,
that really hurt the Indian cause.
WEBFEET DRIVE
After both teams had threatened
briefly in the early minutes of the
first quarter, Oregon took the ball,
first-and-ten on (he Stanford 45-
yard line after Durket's kick had
gone out of bounds. Halfback Jim
Newquist smashed through center,
and speedy Jake Leicht slashed over
tackle for sizable chunks of yardage.
In all the Webfeet piled up three
first downs to the Indian 1(5.
Van Brock 1 in then calmly faded
back, and taking plenty of time,
threw a perfect strike to Leicht,
standing all alone on the two, who
