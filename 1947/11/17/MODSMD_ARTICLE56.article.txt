Scoring twice in the first seven
minutes of play, the Stanford jun
ior varsity defeated the California
Aggies by a 20 to 14 score before
a crowd of approximately 2,000 fans
in Davis on Saturday. It was the
I third win of the season for the
I Jayvees.
The victory sent the Jayvees into
the California Rambler game next
Saturday with an unblemished rec
ord.
The hard-fought contest was fea
tured by five touchdown runs, each
of which traveled over 40 yards.
Tiie Indian Jayvees hit paydirt
twice via the overhead route, once
by a 45-yard reverse, and once by
an intercepted Aggie lateral.
Card quarterback Dave Melton
threw to Van Johns for a 50-yard
counter and the first score of the
ball game in the opening minutes of

play.
Shortly after the initial tally, Van
Johns circled his own left end and
streaked 45 yards to score, making
the count stand at 13 to 0. Kelton's
try was good.
With the 14 to 0 lead, mentor Jim
Cox removed his first-stringers and
the Aggies retaliated by sending
their right half slicing off left tackle
to romp 70 yards for the home
towners' first score. Again in the
second canto, the Mustangs scored
by smashing over the goal line from
one yard out.
With the score knotted at 14-all,
Indian quarterback Ron James aer
ialed to left half Bobby Bahlman
who received on the Aggie 25 and
scooted the remaining 25 yards for
the Cards' third marker.
The only other points made dur
ing the afternoon wore made by In- j
dian fullback Don Lipelt, who in
tercepted a lateral in the Aggie
backfield and rambled 45 yards for
his team's last TD.
The big, soft - spoken Indian
coach, Jim Cox. had nothing but
praise for fullback Don Lipelt, cen- >
ter Jack Porter, and end A 1 Laakso.
