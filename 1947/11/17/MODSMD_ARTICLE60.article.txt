# We Have an Axe to Grind
## 
### 
Stanford won the Big Game last year.
But apparently someone forgot to tell the
game results to those in whose charge the Axe
was placed.
Governor Earl Warren presented the Axe to
ASSU president Martin Anderson following
the Stanford victory in last year's Big Game.
It was expected that the Axe would be dis
played on the Stanford campus. Isn't the Axe
tre traditional symbol of the Big Game? Doesn't
it represent the spirit of rivalry existing be
tween the University of California and Stan
ford?
However the Axe was not displayed. It was
cached away in the closets of the police
station.
Those in whose possession the Axe was
placed promised to display the Axe in a prom
inent spot on campus as soon as a suitable
case could be constructed.
The case did not arrive for eleven months.
When it finally reached the campus it was
found to be the wrong size and had to be re
turned.
But the Big Game Was approaching. All
agreed that the Axe would have to be dis

played anyway. Consequently, it now can be
seen daily in the Cellar.
But if you look close you will see that last
year's game results have not yet been in
scribed on the plaque.
Is this the way to treat the symbol of the
Big Game? Would the "Immortal 21" have
recaptured the Axe if they could have fore
seen a time when the Axe was to be treated
like a used textbook-

It merely is an attempt to state something
that must be obvious to every Stanford student
by now.
If we win the Big Game Saturday a definite
plan to supervise the handling of the Axe must
be prepared.
If we lose the Big Game and California gets
the Axe we must look forward to the time
when we will again regain it and make our
plans for that time.
A Stanford Axe, lying unattended for eleven
months of the year, will never challenge the
Little Brown Jug for top honors in the football
trophy division.
