Someplace in high school there should be a course
taught on taking class notes.
Last year I was a senior. This year I'm a junior.
If you're real broadminded you can call this progress,
and it all comes from my ability to take lecture notes.
Some professors are just naturally fast speakers;
-others cultivate the habit to confuse the students.
Some of them say nothing for 30 minutes and then
deliver the world almanac in the next 30.
And if you miss 10 seconds you're lost. Just the
other day, while I was pushing out another piece of
lead in my repeater pencil, the Assembly of the League
of Nations accepted four states as members, voted the
yearly budget, and decided on a beer bust at General
Smuts' home.
Of course when you miss something, the thing to do
is lean down the row and see if anybody else is doing
better than you are, and then copy.
If the professor notices enough people have missed
the point, he signals the reader of the course, who
jots the thing down as a question for the next test. This
is all in the process of separating the men from the
boys, and usually results in a well distributed curve.
The problem of determining the scope of the course
usually resolves itself in my case as to whether it is
better to know a lot about comparatively nothing, or
practically nothing about a little of everything.
Anyone reading my notes would say I had made
a concentrated effort to overlook, in so far as possible,
anything of significance or importance.
One of the best kind of note takers is the guy who
has the prof "all figured out." As he takes notes, cer-

tain statements ring mental bells, and with a smile as
bright as 60,000 on a pin-ball machine, the guy puts a
big star after the statement. This he will tell you later
in confidence is a "cinch question" and "worth 10
points on the exam."
What usually happens to this guy is the professor
louses things up by letting the reader make up the
exam.
This brings up another question as to whether it's
better to have the prof make up the test and have
the reader correct it, or have the reader make up the
test and have the professor correct it. Personally I
prefer to have them let me make up the test and
then anybody can read my bluebook that damn well
wants to.
At any rate the division of power and duties be
tween the reader and the professor is as mean a man
euver as promising an essay exam and then actually
giving an essay exam. Honesty is always an incalcul
able quantity in a professor.
The point of all of this is there should be uni
versal abbreviations for "dogmatic," "stigma," "early
history of," "reason behind," and all proper nouns
used in the course, and other like words and phrases.
There should be lessons in note organization for
people like myself, and a study of voice inflection so as
to pick out the meaty parts of the lecture.
I don't know, maybe it's an inherent fault of the
lecture system. Somebody once defined the lecture
system as being the shortest way of transferring the
instructor's notes into the student's notes, without
passing through the mind of either.
