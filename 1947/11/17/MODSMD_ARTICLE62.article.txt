## Atom Bomb Question 
### 
To the Editor:
Having been unable to attend the Atomic Energy
panel Tuesday evening, I must rely on the report in
Wednesday's Daily for a description of the views
presented there. It states that the distinguished group
of speakers were chiefly in accord on the idea that
"Russia must somehow be made to understand . . .
that she must give up her sovereignty to the extent
that the world as a whole will have complete juris
diction over the atom bomb.''
That concept involves maintaining the atom bomb
as a legal weapon of warfare, available for use, with
all its horrors of indiscriminate slaughter of those
incapable of contributing to a war effort in any way,
against a state held guilty of disturbing the peace.
Since, according to the panel speakers, there is no
defense against the bomb, and America would suffer
more than Russia in such a war, it would seem to me
that the Russian plan is not only more humanitarian,
but more in the American interest than that proposed
to Mr. Baruch. Moscow holds that (1) the bomb be
outlawed by international convention, thereby auto
matically placing the stigma of guilt on any nation
making or using it; (2) existing stocks and manufac
turing installations be destroyed; (3) UN inspection be
permitted without veto, provided that the Commission
state in advance its reasons for believing a given
installation to be engaged in illegal activities, so as to
make it impossible for the Commission to be used as a
means of old-fashioned economic espionage.
This proposal seems to me the more commendable
in that, according to Dr. Schiff of the panel, "there, is
no reason to suppose that they (the Russians) arc not
capable of producing the bomb." Soviet objection to
the American plan is based on the view that the veto
less Atomic Development Authority, having, as we
propose, a monopoly of all operations in this field,
could hinder atomic energy for the protection of the
investments of existing large oil, coal and power
interests.
