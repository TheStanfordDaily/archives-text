# Hutchins' Address
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The ovation given to Dr. Robert M. Hutchins Thurs
day was a tribute to the audience as well as to the
speaker. It showed a favorable response to a con
structive approach to present-day difficulties.
Dr. Hutchins made a clean sweep of the superflui
ties and went right to the core of our international
and national conflicts. One striking example was his
view on the question of universal military training. The
two predominant schools of thought are: 1) when the
next war comes, trained armies will be useless and
tend to lead to false security; therefore UMT is un
necessary; and 2) we must not lapse into the unpre
pared state of pre-world war two. and get caught
napping when the next war comes; therefore UMT

is accessary. Both schools presuppose that another
war is inevitable. Dr. Hutchins, however, starts with
the premise' that another war is impossible if our
civilization is to survive. "Peace by justice" is the
solution. World cooperation is necessary and therefore
possible.
Some say that this attitude is not realistic. Being
realistic means doing what you are really designed to
do. Are we designed to fight one another, or to live in
harmony with one another?
It seems that the unrealistic viewpoint is that an
other war will solve our problems. Look at the last
war and see if it solved the problem of the preservation
of our way of life. If it did, why are we contemplating
another war? If it didn't, let's look for a better solu
tion. That solution, as Dr. Hutchins points out, is to
be found in a world government based on justice and
goodwill. Our problem now, is to begin active work
toward the achievement of that goal.
