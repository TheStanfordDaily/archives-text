# 'Coops' Not 'Crops'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
A typographical error in your publication of my
letter in Tuesday's Daily must have made your
readers wonder what on earth the re-entry of con
sumer "crops" into the Soviet urban scene had to do
with the progressive trend in relations between gov
ernment and people I strove to document.
My carbon copy shows that I spelled it "coops" for
cooperatives, which was my intention. From 1935
until last year these cooperatives were barred from
the cities and relegated to the countryside where,
it is true, they had 36,000.000 members, varying
between 90 and 100 percent of the population in dif
ferent areas, and constituting the largest such move
ment on earth. However, as they were not allowed
in the cities, the urban consumer had little freedom
of choice in purchase, having to buy either in a des
ignated low-price government-owned ration-store,
or in a very high-priced non-ration government
"commercial" store, or in a fantastically high-priced
farmers' market. Only in the areas lost by Russia
after World War I, and re-acquired after World War
11, was private commerce permitted.
It is fascinating, and hopeful, that the re-entry of
the co-ops on to the urban scene was at the express
invitation of the government, which stated that it
desired this in order to compel better service,
through competition, in its own stores, and to force
down prices in the farmers' markets. It extended
credits to the co-ops which has enabled them to
open 24,000 retail outlets and 11.500 eating places in
9 months of this year. Incidentally, the International
Cooperative Alliance recognized the bona fide charac
ter of the Soviet movement, membership democracy
being the criterion, by electing a Russian as one of
its two vice-Presidents last year.
