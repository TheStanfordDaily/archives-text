# Fifty Year History Of Sororities Viewed
## 
### MARY LOU MORITZ 
Sororities, the feminine counterpart of the Greek letter fraternities,
are no longer on the Stanford campus, but for 50 years they played an
active part in Stanford life.
These social organizations were a part of Stanford from its very be
ginning, for in 1892, one year after classes began, the Kappa Kappa Gamma

and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorori
ties received charters from the Uni
versity. They were welcomed with
open arms by University officials
who saw in them a solution to the
critical housing problem.
HOUSING PROBLEMS
Housing problems faced the soror
ities too, for the Kappas had to con
tinue living in a section of Roble
Hall which they rented until they
were able to obtain a house of their
own.
A Theta, in a book she wrote on
early student life, tells how her sor
ority, transferring en masse from
University of the Pacific, immedi
ately rented a barn-like house some
distance from the campus.
"I and my roommate painted the
upstairs halls while the other girls
scrubbed the rooms with soap and
water in an attempt to make the
house presentable and homey."
The second year of the Thetas'
existence found them in a new house
in Palo Alto and the next year they
moved to the Stanford campus in a
house on the row.
LACK OF BITTERNESS
In the early days at Stanford,
there was not the bitterness between
the sororities which was becoming
a problem in the Eastern schools.
An early editorial in the Daily Palo
Alto commended the Kappas and
the Thetas on the friendliness they
showed in throwing a big party to
welcome the new Pi Beta Phis when
they received their charter in 1893.
There were other exchange parties
with the fraternities on campus and
the Kappa and Theta Halloween
parties were the social highlights of
the year.
In 1908, the freshman girle in Ro
ble, seeing how rushing was affect
ing their friends who were not sure
of being pledged, voted to refuse
bids to the houses and leave the
sororities without pledges. This re
volt was not successful, however.
PROTEST MADE
In 1943 a group of junior and
senior women, sorority and non-sor
ority Roble sponsors, presented a
written protest asking that sororities
be disbanded. At the time nine na
tional sororities, Alpha Omicron Pi,

Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta
Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi
Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi, had
chapters on campus.
For several weeks the extreme
feelings students felt for or against
the move were expressed in the
Campus Opinion column of The
Daily. The anti-sorority motto was,
"The winds of freedom do not blow
here," the opposite of Stanford's
motto, "Die Luft der Freiheit weht."
Committees were set up to study
the problem and suggest an alterna
tive to such a drastic move.
The furor died out in a year and
so it was a complete surprise to
Stanford women when on a rainy
night in April of 1944, Dr. Tresidder
informed them that Greek letter or
ganizations for women had been
abolished on the campus. He was
impressed by the ovation that came
from the assembled women who all
stood and sang the Stanford hymn
to reaffirm their school loyalty.

parties were the social highlights of
the year.
In 1908, the freshman girle in Ro
ble, seeing how rushing was affect
ing their friends who were not sure
of being pledged, voted to refuse
bids to the houses and leave the
sororities without pledges. This re
volt was not successful, however.
PROTEST MADE
In 1943 a group of junior and
senior women, sorority and non-sor
ority Roble sponsors, presented a
written protest asking that sororities
be disbanded. At the time nine na
tional sororities, Alpha Omicron Pi,

Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta
Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi
Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi, had
chapters on campus.
For several weeks the extreme
feelings students felt for or against
the move were expressed in the
Campus Opinion column of The
Daily. The anti-sorority motto was,
"The winds of freedom do not blow
here," the opposite of Stanford's
motto, "Die Luft der Freiheit weht."
Committees were set up to study
the problem and suggest an alterna
tive to such a drastic move.
The furor died out in a year and
so it was a complete surprise to
Stanford women when on a rainy
night in April of 1944, Dr. Tresidder
informed them that Greek letter or
ganizations for women had been
abolished on the campus. He was
impressed by the ovation that came
from the assembled women who all
stood and sang the Stanford hymn
to reaffirm their school loyalty.
Sororities, the feminine counterpart of the Greek letter fraternities,
are no longer on the Stanford campus, but for 50 years they played an
active part in Stanford life.
These social organizations were a part of Stanford from its very be
ginning, for in 1892, one year after classes began, the Kappa Kappa Gamma

and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorori
ties received charters from the Uni
versity. They were welcomed with
open arms by University officials
who saw in them a solution to the
critical housing problem.
HOUSING PROBLEMS
Housing problems faced the soror
ities too, for the Kappas had to con
tinue living in a section of Roble
Hall which they rented until they
were able to obtain a house of their
own.
A Theta, in a book she wrote on
early student life, tells how her sor
ority, transferring en masse from
University of the Pacific, immedi
ately rented a barn-like house some
distance from the campus.
"I and my roommate painted the
upstairs halls while the other girls
scrubbed the rooms with soap and
water in an attempt to make the
house presentable and homey."
The second year of the Thetas'
existence found them in a new house
in Palo Alto and the next year they
moved to the Stanford campus in a
house on the row.
LACK OF BITTERNESS
In the early days at Stanford,
there was not the bitterness between
the sororities which was becoming
a problem in the Eastern schools.
An early editorial in the Daily Palo
Alto commended the Kappas and
the Thetas on the friendliness they
showed in throwing a big party to
welcome the new Pi Beta Phis when
they received their charter in 1893.
There were other exchange parties
with the fraternities on campus and
the Kappa and Theta Halloween
parties were the social highlights of
the year.
