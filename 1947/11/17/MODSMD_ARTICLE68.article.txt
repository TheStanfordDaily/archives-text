SACRAMENTO. Nov. 16 (UP).â€”
Governor Earl Warren emphatically
denied as "pure nonsense" tonight
reports that his name might be sub
milted to California Democrats in
the 1948 Presidential primary elec
tion.
"The suggestion that my name
might be entered in the Democratic
as well as the Republican Presiden
tial primary in California is pure
nonsense," declared Warren in a
prepared statement. "I would not of
course consent to any such action.
It is contrary to the intent of our
national election process and is in
direct conflict with my own convic
tion."
