NOW HEAR THIS:
Open house at CARLUN'S
tonight!
Come on down around 9:00
or before if possible and glom
on to some delicious FREE
chow. Here's your chance
to meet your new hosts;
Mike and Emil on the open
er, and Jean Fisher in charge
of vittles.
Remember:
iFree parking lot. If you
get "tired" along 'bout that
hour, leave the car all night
—it's only a short walk back
to the campus.
A congenial fire in the
fireplace at all times—just
the thing for those "damp"
afternoons.
CARLUN'S
