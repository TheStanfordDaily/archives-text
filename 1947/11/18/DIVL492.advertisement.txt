Congion & Crome
STfITI ONERS
Dear Stoodents:
Just a note to those few Stanfords
// who might not know about "Cong
don & Crome, Stationers" to say:
// Don't let the "Stationers" part fool
y°"!
* Although we have the finest,
v\ • complete line of stationery items in
J J Palo Alto, we also have other things
of particular interest to students.
For instance, we have thousands of yards of crepe paper
for college dances; we'd as soon fix your brokervpen as
sell you a new one ; some days we cash more student checks
than all three banks toget'ner. (On bank holidays, that is.)
On the scholastic side, we have everything you need
in school supplies: accounting sup
plies, binders, desks, desk lamps, \
and—you name it. ( \ _ v \V"bC^f

We also have in stock a nice group — \
of gift ideas, as well as a wide selec- p. Jm AvV
tion of cards for "My-gosh-1-should- I I \\
have - sent - a - present - but - I - M
still - have - time - for - a - card" oc
casions. Jrj
Drop in and see us soon!
Cordially,
Clark Congdon
