lations. At the first meeting of each

The Western College Congress will meet at Stanford Monday, :
Tuesday, and Wednesday to focus the best thinking of college
students upon the more vital problems involving the United
States and the Soviet Union, Cliff Forster, president of the Con- .
gress announced.
Stanford hopes that from this Congress there will spring a

desire for the continuation of this <
of student opinion. "If it contributes
of student opinion. If it contributes
to a clearer understanding by the
delegates of the difficult problems of
Soviet-American relations, and the
delegates pass this information on,
the conference will have succeeded
immeasurably," said Forster.
In April, 194(i, and in March, 1947,
congresses were held at Reed Col
lege, Portland, to consider the prob
lem of strengthening world organi
zation for the preservation of peace.
They formulated proposals which
were presented to the United Na
tions. Stanford observers proposed
the establishment of a similar con
gress at Stanford, and leadership
was assumed by the Institute on
International Relations. Forty ma
jor colleges and universities in Cali
fornia, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and
Hawaii have been invited to send
two delegates each.
At the opening session of the con- j
gross welcoming addresses will be
made by Dr. Donald B. Tresidder,

Following this will be keynote
speeches by John R. Deane, Major
General, U.S. Army, retired, and
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman of
the Hoover War Library.

most important aspects of the gen
eral theme of Soviet-American re
lations. At the first meeting of each
section, a moderator chosen for his
special qualifications will present
the problem.
