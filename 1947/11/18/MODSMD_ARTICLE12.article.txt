PARIS, Nov. 17 (UP).â€”Commu
nist city councilman screamed pro
tests, hooted, shouted insults, and
walked out of the Paris municipal
council today when Pierre de
Gaulle, brother of Gen. Charles de
Gaulle, was elected council presi
dent by a two-to-one margin over
the Communist candidate.
After the Communists left, the
council made it a clean anti-Com
munist sweep by electing three oth
er De Gaullists and one Socialist
as vice-presidents.
Hundreds of police with heavily
armed, helmeted Mobile Guardsmen
in reserve surrounded the Paris
cnty hall during the council elec

lions, indicating the high tension
existing whenever there is a meet
ing between Communists and mem
bers of De Gaulle's Union of French
People (KPP^).
Pierre de Gaulle, swept, into the
Paris council in the recent RPF mu
nicipal election landslide, received
51 votes for president against 25
votes for Communist Councilor
Raymond Boussus. Socialist J. Ge
j vanean received eitfhl votes.
Announcement of the ballot re
sults set off the demonstration by
the Communist delegation of 25
councilors. Boussus leaped to the
floor and charged the RPF members
were "in the pay of bankers and the
200 families of France."
It was reported either former
Prime Minister Paul Reynaud or
aged Socialist Leon Blum might be
i called upon later this week to take
I over from Premier Paul Ramadier.
It was understood the political
leaders wanted a more effective
Center government to take over
j from Ramadier at once without cre-
I ating a major political crisis.
