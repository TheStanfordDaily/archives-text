# 'REVIVE WARTIME CONTROLS'--TRUMAN
## Wage-Price Ceilings Plus Rationing to Highlight Domestic Economic Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).—President Truman askcl
: Congress today for authority to impose 10 major inflation con
trols on the nation, including rationing and wage-price ceilings,
to safeguard not only domestic prosperity but his multi-billion
dollar foreign aid program.
He reguested the far-reaching grant of lower Republican-

controlled congress which convened
in emergency session at noon, for a
foreign and domestic policy debate
that will shape the help this coun
try grants to communist-threatened
j nations abroad.
The chief executive linked insep
arably the war against inflation at
home and the cold war against com
munism overseas.
He asked an emergency appropri -
j ation of $597,000,000 for stop-gap
winter relief in France, Italy, and
Austria and promised to submit,
"shortly" his detailed recommenda
tions for the long-range European
recovery program, which will mean
1 an American investment of perhaps
$20,000,000 in European freedom over
the next four years.
The President moved swiftly over
the emergency aid request, which
apparently is assured of approval,
and devoted the bulk of his address
to the domestic inflation controls.
He made it emphatically clear that
he wants the powers as a club-in
the-closet persuader to be brought,
into play only when and as they arc
needed to prevent an "economic
catastrophe" which might plunge this
country into depression and wreck
all chance of a peaceful world re
covery.
All) REQUESTED
The President saw no immediate
prospect of reinstating ceiling price;
on staple foods and clothing, and he
urged continuation of voluntary
measures as a good way to forestall
compulsory controls.
But the President justified his de
mands—far stronger than most
Washington observers had antici
pated—by pointing to the "alarming"
price rises which have occurred over
the past 18 months and to the urgent,
needs of non-communist Europe
which both parties have agreed must
be met.
"We cannot abandon foreign aid,
nor can we abandon our own people
to the ravages of unchecked infla
tion," he said.'
DEPRESSION LOOMS
"If we neglect our economic ills
at home, if we fail to halt the march
of inflation, we may bring on a de
pression from which our economic
system, as we know it, might not
recover.
"And if we turn our backs on na
tions still struggling to recover from
the agony of war, not yet able to
stand on their own feet, we may lose
for all time the chance to obtain a
world where free peoples can live
in enduring peace.
The President put the domestic in
flation problem squarely up to con
gress, and thus spotlighted it as
perhaps the top issue of the 1948
presidential 'election campaign in
which he is epected to be the Demo
cratic nominee.
ASSAILANTS
Republican leaders promptly as
sailed the program as designed to
give Mr. Truman dictatorial wartime
powers, revive the OPA, and put the
nation on the road to "totalitarian
ism." They predicted long, bitter
debate over virtually every step.
There was no expressed opposition
to Mr. Truman's emergency aid re
quest, which called for $42,000,000 for
Austria, $227,000,000 for Italy and
$328,000,000 for France to keep those
countries in food and fuel through
the winter.

There was no expressed opposition

Austria, $227,000,000 for Italy and
$328,000,000 for France to keep those
countries in food and fuel through
the winter.


PRESIDENT TRUMAN in an
address to a joint meeting of Con

There was Republican opposition.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).—President Truman askcl
: Congress today for authority to impose 10 major inflation con
trols on the nation, including rationing and wage-price ceilings,
to safeguard not only domestic prosperity but his multi-billion
dollar foreign aid program.
He reguested the far-reaching grant of lower Republican-

controlled congress which convened
in emergency session at noon, for a
foreign and domestic policy debate
that will shape the help this coun
try grants to communist-threatened
j nations abroad.
The chief executive linked insep
arably the war against inflation at
home and the cold war against com
munism overseas.
He asked an emergency appropri -
j ation of $597,000,000 for stop-gap
winter relief in France, Italy, and
Austria and promised to submit,
"shortly" his detailed recommenda
tions for the long-range European
recovery program, which will mean
1 an American investment of perhaps
$20,000,000 in European freedom over
the next four years.
The President moved swiftly over
the emergency aid request, which
apparently is assured of approval,
and devoted the bulk of his address
to the domestic inflation controls.
He made it emphatically clear that
he wants the powers as a club-in
the-closet persuader to be brought,
into play only when and as they arc
needed to prevent an "economic
catastrophe" which might plunge this
country into depression and wreck
all chance of a peaceful world re
covery.
All) REQUESTED
The President saw no immediate
prospect of reinstating ceiling price;
on staple foods and clothing, and he
urged continuation of voluntary
measures as a good way to forestall
compulsory controls.
But the President justified his de
mands—far stronger than most
Washington observers had antici
pated—by pointing to the "alarming"
price rises which have occurred over
the past 18 months and to the urgent,
needs of non-communist Europe
which both parties have agreed must
be met.
"We cannot abandon foreign aid,
nor can we abandon our own people
to the ravages of unchecked infla
tion," he said.'
DEPRESSION LOOMS
"If we neglect our economic ills
at home, if we fail to halt the march
of inflation, we may bring on a de
pression from which our economic
system, as we know it, might not
recover.
