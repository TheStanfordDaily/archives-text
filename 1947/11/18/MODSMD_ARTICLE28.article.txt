# School Exchange Ideas In Monthly NSA Bulletin
## 
### 
The monthly NSA regional bulletin, edited jointly by Natalie Nowell
and Bill Wright of the University of California, a member of the regional
domestic panel at Loyola University, and the regional international panel
of Stanford, will record progress in student affairs based upon a nation
wide inter-change of information.
The regional bulletin is to be the medium for exchange of informa
tion between schools in the region and between the regional and national
office. Financed by the regional treasury, the monthly bulletin should help
to mold California, Nevada, and Hawaii into an integrated group of stu
dent communities working together on the solutions to students' problems.
INTERNATIONAL DIVISION
The students affairs bulletin is to be divided into two sections: inter
national and domestic. The former will be edited in the main by Stan
ford's lIR. Specifically, three results of the Farrer-Grannis European
survey will be included: (1) an educational project in Europe staffed by
American professors along the lines of the Harvard Salzburg project; (2)
a centralized organization to provide information and cut-rate travel
facilities lor students who will travel to Europe next summer; and (3) an
extended exchange scholarship program that will facilitate maximum study
opportunities for foreign students on the Pacific Coast at a minimum cost.
With regard to the latter, the program includes plans for curtailment of
expenses by waiving tuition, supplying room and board through individual
living groups, and the incurring of traveling expenses by Ex-Com.
Student activities in the international sphere must be done on a large
scale to be effective. Through the regional bulletin, the work of lIR will
be projected on a region-wide screen. Large scale projects can be pushed
to a successful conclusion wilh tho forty schools in the region supporting
them through Stanford's lIR.
The National NSA bulletin on international activities is to be edited
at Harvard.
DOMESTIC DIVISION
The domestic division will bo handled largely at USC. The NSA sub
commission on Veterans' Affairs is located there. The ground work already
laid by AVC entotals a series of poll and panel discussions on the need for
an extension of GI subsistence. On the basis of this information, the need
lies primarily with the married veteran. A subsidiary issue under consid
eration is that of late Gl checks. Action to be taken in this regard pends
a more complete investigation of both issues.
The activities of each sub-commission in this region will gain wider
regional support through the publication of the regional bulletin. The
further success of NSA depends to a large degree on the constant exchange
of constructive proposals designed to improve student affairs. The regional
bulletin offers the most efficient medium by means of which this goal can
be achieved.

The students affairs bulletin is to be divided into two sections: inter
national and domestic. The former will be edited in the main by Stan
ford's lIR. Specifically, three results of the Farrer-Grannis European
survey will be included: (1) an educational project in Europe staffed by
American professors along the lines of the Harvard Salzburg project; (2)
a centralized organization to provide information and cut-rate travel
facilities lor students who will travel to Europe next summer; and (3) an
extended exchange scholarship program that will facilitate maximum study
opportunities for foreign students on the Pacific Coast at a minimum cost.
With regard to the latter, the program includes plans for curtailment of
expenses by waiving tuition, supplying room and board through individual
living groups, and the incurring of traveling expenses by Ex-Com.
Student activities in the international sphere must be done on a large
scale to be effective. Through the regional bulletin, the work of lIR will
be projected on a region-wide screen. Large scale projects can be pushed
to a successful conclusion wilh tho forty schools in the region supporting
them through Stanford's lIR.
The National NSA bulletin on international activities is to be edited
at Harvard.
DOMESTIC DIVISION
The domestic division will bo handled largely at USC. The NSA sub
commission on Veterans' Affairs is located there. The ground work already
laid by AVC entotals a series of poll and panel discussions on the need for
an extension of GI subsistence. On the basis of this information, the need
lies primarily with the married veteran. A subsidiary issue under consid
eration is that of late Gl checks. Action to be taken in this regard pends
a more complete investigation of both issues.
The activities of each sub-commission in this region will gain wider
regional support through the publication of the regional bulletin. The
further success of NSA depends to a large degree on the constant exchange
of constructive proposals designed to improve student affairs. The regional
bulletin offers the most efficient medium by means of which this goal can
be achieved.
The monthly NSA regional bulletin, edited jointly by Natalie Nowell
and Bill Wright of the University of California, a member of the regional
domestic panel at Loyola University, and the regional international panel
of Stanford, will record progress in student affairs based upon a nation
wide inter-change of information.
The regional bulletin is to be the medium for exchange of informa
tion between schools in the region and between the regional and national
office. Financed by the regional treasury, the monthly bulletin should help
to mold California, Nevada, and Hawaii into an integrated group of stu
dent communities working together on the solutions to students' problems.
