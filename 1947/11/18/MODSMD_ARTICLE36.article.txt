# Dorm Women Meet At Sunday Vespers
## 
### 
Vesper services, conducted every Sunday night in the lobbies
of Roble, Branner, and Union Residence, are under the general
supervision of the newly-appointed Memorial Church Board.
The services were begun last year in Union and Branner and
have been started this quarter in Roble. They are informal get-

togethers held by the students, be-4
ginning at 10:30 and ending about
10:45 Sunday evenings.
They are candlelight services, thai
consist in the playing of classical j
records, short talks on subjects such j
as friendship or faith, and a short
prayer.
Betty Rice, the group chairman, j
has charge of readings at Union,' .nd
Frances Beardsley at Roble. The girls
at Branner, directed by Marilyn j
Hopwood, are taking turns by cor- 1
ridors in the reading and writing of 1
the talks. Roble has taken the lead
with the formation of corridor choirs i
that conclude each program with a
hymn.
Miss Rice says that the members j
of the Board are hoping to begin
vesper services in the other living
groups. She suggests that anyone in
terested should contact the Memorial
Church Board.
