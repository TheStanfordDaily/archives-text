# Crew Hopes For New Era At Stanford
## 
### BILL BETHKE 
A new era of success for Stanford s
crew? This may be only a question
to most of the Farm s population, but
to the determined Indian oarsmen
it's the real thing. "Maybe we won't
be a big threat this year." they'll tell
you," but just wait a season or two."
Then plans and hopes unfold for
beating Cal and returning to the
athletic status of the great Stanford
crews of 1912 and 1913. In and
around the club's low, white boat
house on the Bay's muddy shore
there is the spontaneous enthusiasm
of men who love their sport. The
roster boasts 74 names, a turnout
second only to that of football. Ol
this number nearly 50 are freshmen
who will form the backbone of the
crews of the next few years.
STARTED LAST FALL
The rejuvenation of the Indian
crew began last fall after a revival in
1940 had been stopped by the war.
The driving spirit behind the enter
prise was Lou Lindsey, who pleaded
with alumni to write Stanford asking
for a crew. Lou followed these ef
forts up by training the oarsmen and
coxswains last fall.
Although Lindsey has been inact
ive this year because of a severe
back ailment, the reins are in capa
ble hands. George Benedict and Jar
vis Gates run the business and
maintenance ends of the group while
the coaching jobs rest on the shoul
ders of Mark Ancel, Bill Merril and
A. A. Clark.
FIVE SHELLS IN WATER
In accordance with this policy, the
officers have succeeded in getting
live shells in the water nearly every
afternoon. v
Like many other sports rowing is
not just a seasonal sport. Its dev
otees must turn out all during the
school year to get in shape for the
races in the spring. But perhaps no
other sport is as thoroughly a team
affair as is crew. No one man ever
stars, for all eight men in a shell
must pull together, recover together,
and have exactly the same body
rhythm.


While ten smiling crewmen look on, Maile Scott and Marilyn Spicer
of Casa Ventura prepare to officially christen the Cardinal, one of the
Stanford crew's new shells. Shown from left to right with the front one
sixth of the new hoat are Garry Vander Ende, llaoyn Kramer, Jim Smith,
crew prexy Jarvis Gales, club manager George Benedict, Miss Scott,
Miss Spicer. frosh coach Mark Ancel, A 1 Anderson, Norm Swanson, and
Jim Brannaman.
