# Defense Stressed for Big Game
## 
### 
Defense will be stressed in
this week's practices, head
coach Marchie Schwartz an
nounced yesterday. "We're go
ing to have to stop the powerful
California ofT-tackle and end runs,"
Schwartz said, "and we must work
on a defense for their passing game,
which is also very good."
The varsity football team came out
of Saturday's game in fairly good
shape, Schwartz said. The grid
mentor revealed that Mickey Titus,
injured halfbzack who has played
only one minute since the Michigan
game, would have his knee oper
ated on during the Christmas vaca
tion. It is still questionable whether

or not Titus will play against Cali- i
fornia this week.
Fullback Marty Anderson was
singled out by Schwartz as "the
hardest running back we've had in ,
the last two weeks." Andersou's el
bow, feared injured in the USC I
game, has completely healed and he j

will definitely play again this Satur

Mike Durket's booming punts fea
; turi'd yesterday's practice. The rest
! of the squad worked on defensive
I fundamentals. "We're in good shape
but we aren't physically capable of
j risking any injuries," Schwartz said.

I "Therefore, our practices this week
j will be scrimmageless."
Schwartz said that he was satis
fied with the team's showing against
Oregon last Saturday. "We played
an excellent game and with a couple
; of hreaks, it might have been a dif
ferent story." "For instance," he
asked, "isn't it a shame that the last
Oregon tackier had to get Marty An
derson on that kick-off return?"
The Stanford coach praised Ore
gon's fine team. "From tackle to
; tackle, they are the best in the
PCL," he said. He also said that
i with the exception of Bob Chap
pius (Michigan All-American),
quarterback Van Brocklin of Oregon
was the best passer Stanford has
faced this year.
