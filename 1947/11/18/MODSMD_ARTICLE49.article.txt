Here's a story that might interest you.
At a pre-Excom meeting last night a sample
agenda for Wednesday night's meeting was
passed around to the members.
Following this meeting the editor of the
Daily was asked by an ASSU officer to refrain
from publicizing one particular item which
was to be approved Wednesday night.
This item was one of vital importance to all
students and one which would affect students
for the duration of Stanford's existence as a
university.
There was no question of unfavorable pub
licity as the person who made the request was
informed by The Daily editor that all material
on the subject would be written in an objective
manner and he could personally see all arti
cles written on the subject prior to their pub
lication.
He was told this because the editor of The
Daily believes that the contemplated action
is probably in the best interests of the student
body.
The main argument against the publication
of the item was that the student body would
probably not understand what was being done
and would object.
The Daily has been asked before to keep
certain articles out of print. Seldom by admin
istration officials—largely by student body
officers, strangely enough.
For some unknown reason student body of

ficers once they have held office for a few
months begin to get a feeling that they have
an "inside track" on what is happening at
Stanford. They feel that their decisions are
the best decisions. They assume that an unin
formed student body will benefit by their un
heralded official action.
Let us cast aside this ungrounded belief.
Everything regarding ASSU and Excom action
should be publicized. That which can't be
explained so that the students of Stanford can
understand shouldn't be contemplated in the
first place.
There are too many flag-waving, quasi-lib
eral student officials today who fail to even
practice the first essentials of democratic ac
tion. They attempt to hide their actions under
a cloak of—"the students wouldn't understand
anyway."
Tomorrow The Daily editor, an ASSU officer,
and a member of the administration will meet
to discuss the matter. Possibly it will not come
up before Excom if it can not be slipped by
quietly.
The Daily goes to the meeting with one
stand from which it will not waver. If this
measure is to be passed by Excom it will be
publicized in The Daily.
The Daily has a responsibility to the stu
dents of Stanford. That responsibility does
not involve covering up the action of ASSU of
ficials, right or wrong.
