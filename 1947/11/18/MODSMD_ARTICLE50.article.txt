# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
These are critical days, chums!
Getting on and off campus will be harder and
harder as we approach that fateful moment when the
Bonfire lights the sky, and at times it'll be down
right dangerous.
You better not make any mistakes, either, or
they'll be using your hair to stuff the mattresses over
at Encina. Besides you'll catch a cold in the head,
and miss finals. Such tragedy!
But all kiddin' aside, you better start thinking
about the answers you'll have to give the frosh
guards when they put their searching glances on you
and your vehicle. Not once, not twice, but at least
as often a night as you head down Palm Drive to
cool your parched throats, the roving 51'ers will
shove pointed flashlights in your eyes, sneer at you
as they tear the seats out of your car, and ask you
for paroles and passwords you never heard of.
Yeah, I know they're looking for Cal raiders and
cans of blue paint—but occasionally they get lucky
and find a not-quite empty bottle left over from
last Saturday's party, which always involves a lot
of arguing and convincing cause the frosh never be
lieve me when I tell them that cokes now come in flat
bottles. (You leave a bottle of coke open for a day,
and see if it doesn't get flat; so there!)
But the frosh guards always come up with some
new ingenious method of deciding whether you're
from Cal or not. They're psychology boys, and too
many of them also know third degree ways. After

withdrawing the flashlight out of your eye socket,
they wait for the pupils to dilate. Then you're ready
for the cross examination, and a lanky frosh finger
stabs you in the ribs:
"Gimme your student-body card!"
"Yea, sure; see, it's been punched eight times
this quarter, which means I'm interested in student
government and read the Daily editorials."
"Cut the corn, Mac; who runs Rally Com this
quarter?"
"Say, that's easy. Heyler, Carter, and Elke!"
By now a couple of frosh pile into the back seat,
sniffle all over the place, paw the floor mat curiously
while disturbing a couple quietly sitting on the floor—
and think they're going to find paint brushes in the
ash-tray. Meanwhile Lanky Joe wants to ask some
more embarrasing questions:
"Why you wearing that blue tie? And why that
yellow tie clasp, huh?
"The blue tie was the only one my roommate
hadn't hidden away, and that's no yellow tie clasp—
that's solid gold; his mother gave it to him last
Christmas!"
"OK, bub, you better move on; but you keep on
the main streets and don't go pulling off into the
bushes or down short-cuts. And keep out of the
Cactus gardens! Encina's housemother is patrolling
that area tonight."
"Yea, sure, thanks; well, see you on Quad tomor
row, and I hope you catch some of the dirty
bums trying to sneak on campus."

"Yea, sure; see, it's been punched eight times
this quarter, which means I'm interested in student
government and read the Daily editorials."
"Cut the corn, Mac; who runs Rally Com this
quarter?"
"Say, that's easy. Heyler, Carter, and Elke!"
By now a couple of frosh pile into the back seat,
sniffle all over the place, paw the floor mat curiously
while disturbing a couple quietly sitting on the floor—
and think they're going to find paint brushes in the
ash-tray. Meanwhile Lanky Joe wants to ask some
more embarrasing questions:
"Why you wearing that blue tie? And why that
yellow tie clasp, huh?
"The blue tie was the only one my roommate
hadn't hidden away, and that's no yellow tie clasp—
that's solid gold; his mother gave it to him last
Christmas!"
"OK, bub, you better move on; but you keep on
the main streets and don't go pulling off into the
bushes or down short-cuts. And keep out of the
Cactus gardens! Encina's housemother is patrolling
that area tonight."
"Yea, sure, thanks; well, see you on Quad tomor
row, and I hope you catch some of the dirty
bums trying to sneak on campus."
These are critical days, chums!
Getting on and off campus will be harder and
harder as we approach that fateful moment when the
Bonfire lights the sky, and at times it'll be down
right dangerous.
You better not make any mistakes, either, or
they'll be using your hair to stuff the mattresses over
at Encina. Besides you'll catch a cold in the head,
and miss finals. Such tragedy!
But all kiddin' aside, you better start thinking
about the answers you'll have to give the frosh
guards when they put their searching glances on you
and your vehicle. Not once, not twice, but at least
as often a night as you head down Palm Drive to
cool your parched throats, the roving 51'ers will
shove pointed flashlights in your eyes, sneer at you
as they tear the seats out of your car, and ask you
for paroles and passwords you never heard of.
Yeah, I know they're looking for Cal raiders and
cans of blue paint—but occasionally they get lucky
and find a not-quite empty bottle left over from
last Saturday's party, which always involves a lot
of arguing and convincing cause the frosh never be
lieve me when I tell them that cokes now come in flat
bottles. (You leave a bottle of coke open for a day,
and see if it doesn't get flat; so there!)
But the frosh guards always come up with some
new ingenious method of deciding whether you're
from Cal or not. They're psychology boys, and too
many of them also know third degree ways. After

withdrawing the flashlight out of your eye socket,
they wait for the pupils to dilate. Then you're ready
for the cross examination, and a lanky frosh finger
stabs you in the ribs:
"Gimme your student-body card!"
"Yea, sure; see, it's been punched eight times
this quarter, which means I'm interested in student
government and read the Daily editorials."
"Cut the corn, Mac; who runs Rally Com this
