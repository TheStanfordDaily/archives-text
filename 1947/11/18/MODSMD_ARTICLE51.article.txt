## Keep the Pajamarino Spirit 
### 
To the Editor:
It takes more than clams to make a clambake,
more than pajamas to make a pajmrino; it's the spirit
that counts! The pajamarino may need certain re
strictions, but these should be designed to curb ex
cessive property damage without destroying the
urtique character and spirit of the pajamarino.
Certainly Miss Duckworth's proposal of discontin
uing the march down the Row would kill the spirit
of the pajamarino; for a little rough fun between
the Frosh and the Sophomores has become a part of
the pajamarino and does much to build up class unity.
Furthermore, the greater part and most objec
tionable part of the damage occurred at the Basket
ball Pavilion and at Roble Hall, so efforts might bet
ter be directed toward regulating these events.
With this in mind, I would like to suggest the fol
lowing changes in the schedule of next year's pa
jamarino: 1. The serenading of Roble should start the
program, while pajamas are clean and all in one
piece, and before a fighting spirit has been aroused.
2. That the program should be ended after the march
down the Row by a well organized rally at the
Pavilion for men only. This would allow the oppos
ing factions to enter and be seated on opposite sides
of the Pavilion with the Yell Leaders and the Rally
Com. holding the floor between them. Then a real
rally could be held and both sides given a chance to
cool off.
Let's not take the fun out of the pajamarino for
the class of '52; let's not make it a pansy affair and a
disgrace to Stanford. Let's make only minor revisions
and restrictions—let's keep the pajamarino spirit!
