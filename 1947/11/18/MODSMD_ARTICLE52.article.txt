# A 						Million Dr. Hutchins

To the Editor:
Dr. Hutchins' address of Thursday morning was
an eminently justified plea for world peacc, a plea
whose substance was close to that in the minds of
many of his less articulate admirers. Yet there was
a real danger in Dr. Hutchins' program for the sur
vival of civilization, for it was largely based upon an
abstraction: justice.
Certainly the need for justice is vital. But what
is justice? Is it justice to secure for all men immedi
ately equal rights, as Dr. Hutchins advocates, or is it
an act of moral whitewashing on our parts to do so?
Is it justice to give an infant a loaded revolver to
play with? Is it just and is it wise?
For we must face the fact that great masses of

human beings are closer to being confused animals
Ihan rational men. It is the responsibility of the
world first to bring awareness to all people. This is
no more than saying that human civilization must
be founded upon the one characteristic which dif
ferentiates, and elevates, man from all other living
things: civilization must be based upon the human
mind, and not upon the dollar sign, or the sword.
Man's common power of reason and insight and
judgement must be developed universally, and im
partially.
In this, and not in regard to universal military
training, should the United States set the example.
Let all Americans, and all peoples, be trained in the
knowledge of true values: in philosophy, psychology,
and sociology. There could be no imputation of
treachery to this program. A man who seeks truth |
is a dangerous man only to those who seek to sup
press truth. Enlightenment, as well as prejudice,
can be contagious.
This is not to say that the world will ever he
perfect: it never shall be; for no man is perfect, and
society is inescapably a reflection of individual men,
with their pride and greed and emotional astigma
tisms as well as their goodness and humanity. But
only if the day dawns when the majority of men are
able to understand and help themselves will there be
a hope for world peace and a world community
wherein men will be able to understand and help
each other, as well.
What civilization needs is more than one Dr.
Hutchins- it needs a billion Dr. Hutchins, black, and
yellow, and white; and if we do not provide the op
portunity for this, we are indeed blind and lost.
