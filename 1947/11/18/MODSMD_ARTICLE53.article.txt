# Big Game 'Investment'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It has always been a tradition here that on the
night of the Big Game, everyone goes out to one of
the better places on the Peninsula, has a good meal
and then proceeds to get nicely and politely soused
to the tune of about twenty bucks. Now I haven't
an objection in the world to Retting soused, whether
politely or impolitely, or having a change from
Campus food, but I've an idea.
Hero's the idea: instead of going out and spending
twenty bucks, we go out and spend ten bucks and
put the other ten into some form of foreign relief.
It boils down to this: are we willing to take half
of the dough we'd normally spend Big Game Night
and put it into the form of food and blankets, an
investment in future peacu?
