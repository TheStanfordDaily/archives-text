# Red-Faced Brainstorm Started Farm Artist on Way to Success
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Ten years ago a young University
Press artist accepted a Daily car
tooning assignment that started him
on the path to success on a "Big
City" newspaper.
Moyer "Tommy" Thompson gained
his success with a hot idea and sev
eral strokes of the brushâ€”and the
Farm's lovable Li'l Injun appeared.
From the football season of '37
through December, 1939, Tommy's
Li'l Injun drove his figurative
steamroller over Pacific Coast Con
ference elevens.
By 1938 the Li'l Injun strutted

into the social
limelight by ap
pearing in boat
house, movie,
and sports car
toons outside of
the football field.
As the Li'l In
jun, his steam
roller, and his
curvesome maid
en became wide
ly accepted as
campus charac
ters, so did Tom
my's popularity
rise. During the
rushing seasons

Farm fraternities, believing Thomp

son to be another student, vied to
draw him within their fold. And
each time Tommy had to explain
that he was a University Press em
ployee living in his own home in
Paly with his wife, and young
daughter.
For his ideas Thompson joined
Daily and Chappie staff members in
their bull sessions. During these
sessions he would conjure several
ideas that eventually led to another

cartoon on Tiny
Thornhill's Big
Red Machine.
Although the
grid squad's
nickname of the
Big Red Machine
goes back far
lx?yond Bob by

Grayson and the Vow Boys, Tom
my, and most of the cartoonists suc
ceeding him, have drawn every
thing from auto racers to rocket
ships in depicting the Stanford
eleven.
Thompson tried to break into the
art department of the San Francisco
Call-Bulletin in 1938 when he sub
mitted samples of his drawing. A
year later, when he had given up
bis chances for advancement, the
Call tapped Tommy on the shoulder

| and placed the cartoonist on the
sports stall.
When Jimmy Hatlo left the Call
sports staff to devote his full time
to "They'll Do It Every Time,"
Tommy stepped in with his brush
and pen, and to this day he draws
"before and after" football cartoons
for the Friday and Monday evening
Call.
I While the Li'l Injun's fabulous
I personality gained fame for Thomp-

son, other stu
dents seized
upon the idea
and developed
other uses for
the Farm's red
faced represen
tative.
Jack Dickson
created his ver-

sion of the snarling Indian, copy
righted the drawing, and fattened
his spending allowance with Book
store profits on decal transfers,
stickers, stationery designs, and ad
vertising cartoons.
Today the Li'l Injun is as much
an accepted part of this institution
j as the Axe, the pre-game rallies, or
the Big Game Bonfire. Few people
realize how the Indian has by
passed Stanford's original tagline of
> "Cardinals."
