# Axe Presentation To Climax Rally; Row Houses Open for Homecoming
## 
### 
Big Game Week, and the climax of the football season, sees
the arrival of its traditional parade, rally, bonfire, serpentines, axe
chants and other outward manifestations of the festering "spirit."
"Big Jim" Reynolds, famed Stanford alumn from Los Angeles,
will highlight the "biggest" rally since the beginning of the war

Thursday night, and the dramatic
climax will come with the presenta
tion of the Axe.
FIREWORKS
Fireworks, and the most gigantic
bonfire in our history will follow
the rally at Lake Lagunita, states
Sam Brenner, chairman of the com
mittee.
The evening of festivities begins
when two separate serpentines with
sections of the Band originate at
Lagunita Court and at the top of the
Row at about 7:15 p.m. Students
will join at any or all points. The
parades will end up at the rally, the
location of which is as yet unan
nounced.
AXE PRESENTATION
Besides Reynolds, Coach Marchie
Schwartz and the team captain will
speak. Jack Davies will act as mas
ter of ceremonies, and an impressive
presentation of the axe is being
planned.
Reynolds, a nationally known fig
ure, was active in athletics at Stan
ford and was instrumental in bring
ing many star athletes to the Farm.
At the bonfire, which starts im
mediately after the rally at the Lake,
there will be a large display of fire
works.
CARD STUNTS
Twenty-eight card stunts will be
executed at the game on Saturday,
reveals Barbara Carter, co-chair
man of Rally Com. Stanford root
ers will be seated on the sunny side
of the Stadium opposite the side of
the field regularly seating Stanford.
The men will be flanked on both
sides by women rooters, forming a
rooters cap Block S. Pompoms and
rooters caps are compulsory, stated
Miss Carter, and everyone must wear
white to be admitted into the root

to bring their megaphones and
feathers.
On the committee planning the
rally and bonfire are Sam Brenner,
chairman, Susan Ray, Rog and Ed
Wright, Ally Aitken, Craig Stolle,
and Ann Fraser.
CASH PRIZES
At the Big Game Parade, cash
prizes of $130 and $70 will be
awarded houses winning first and
second prizes, stated Joe Pickering,
chairman of the Cardinals-sponsored
parade.
Two perpetual trophies will also
be presented: one to the house win
ning first prize is being donated by
the Alumni Association, and another
to the best decorated house has been
given by Henry Jones of the Fire
house. The two trophies will be on
display in the Cellar as soon as they
arrive.
Floats should be built so that the
main theme is shown on the left
side, stated Pickering, in order that
the judges, who will be on the left
side of the parade, will be able to
see them.

This week is Homecoming, and along with the more con
spicuous events, such as parade, bonfire, Gaieties, and rally, is
one vital thing . . . food. So to make sure the Old Faces won't be
gaming it on an empty stomach, Stanford's living units are plan
ning open-houses and buffet luncheons for Saturday noon.

j "far back" as '47, have all been sent
! invitations to return and take a
| nostalgic look around.
Luncheon will be served from
11:30 to 12:30, and tickets may be
j secured at meal time or in advance
by the women having guests. The
i price is 75 cents.
DORMS OPEN
Encina, Toyon, and Village will
also open the dining room doors,
but no organized open-house hours
have been scheduled. But alumns
and friends will be welcome to drop
