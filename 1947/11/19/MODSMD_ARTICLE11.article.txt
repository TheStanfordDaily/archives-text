### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (UP).â€”
j Three key committees of the House
! and Senate went to work today on
! President Truman's plans for stop
gap aid to Europe, and all signs in
dicated the program will get a
thorough "shaking-down" before it
wins the approval of the emergency
session of Congress.
Chairman Jesse P. Wolcott, R.,
i Mich., announced today that the
[ Mouse Banking Committee may go
j to work early next week on Presi
dent Truman's anti-inflation pro-
J gram, but GOP leaders stood firm in
| opposition to selective price ceilings
and consumer rationing.
| Republicans kept up a steady fire
of criticism of Mr. Truman's drastic
10 - step plan to fight the high
cost of living, and Wolcott hinted
I strongly that the proposals would
remain under committee scrutiny
for a long time.
The Joint Congressional Econom
ic Committee, headed by Sen. Rob
ert A. Taft, R., 0., meets tomorrow
to work out a schedule of hearings.
Meantime, organized labor's first
i reaction was to urge the adminis
-1 tration to go slow on "extreme
! measures" of wage and price con
i trols.
William Green, president of the
i American Federation of Labor, cn
| dorsed virtually all of the Presi
dent's 10 steps except a proposal to
' set up authority to control wage
increases if necessary to keep the
! cost of living down.
