# Flaming Youth, Burlesque Featured In Past Gaieties
## 
### ELLIE LAWRENCE 
Back near the turn of the century,
when Boughs were Roughs and
women's skirts even longer than
nowadays, the Big Game Gaieties
had its initial staging in celebration
of the traditional struggle (rugby)
between Stanford and UC's mighty
fifteen.
Dippy readers of 1898 —the inaug
ural year—found notices of "At Gay
Coney Island," scheduled for per
formance at 8 at the Columbia The
ater the evening before Thanksgiv
ing, as well as an advertisement
from one Mrs. Ostrander who in
vited Farmites to "wear the Cardi
nal Crusher hat for the game for
$1."
RAM'S IIEAI) ORGANIZED
By 1911 the original Ram's Head
had been formed, and in 1917 it
presented pscudo - Gaieties entitled
"Football Jubilee," billed as the
"jazziest jazz ever jazzed with the
best saxies, banjos, and drums to
be found south of the Palace."
Saturday night "Football Froth -
ies" appeared in 1922 to bubble
across the stage in a "burlesque, of
the local variety, but not extremely
personal," according to its publicity
men. Included in this froth of cam
pus fun were "Javanese Twilight"

and "Birth of a Milkweed."
Campus favorite Lloyd Nolan,
'who had been touring the profes
sional vaudeville circuit, made a re
turn appearance in the 1925 Gaie
ties, entitled, appropriately enough,
"The Night Before the Big Game."
The show was advertised as "brim
ming over with that Big Game
Spirit" and pronounced the "best
football show yet produced on cam
pus" by the Daily reviewer.
THE GAIETIES GROW
The end of the roaring twenties
found the Indians right in line with
the rest of the world's flaming
youth. Opening with the number
"Three Little Redskins, or from
Plow Boy to President," 1929 Gaie
ties boasted a "cast of 1,929, includ
ing the ushers," with "(50 Giddy
Girls —count 'em 60)." A new foot
ball song, "Flaming Red," was in
troduced.
The season of 191)0 brought "an
intimate chorus of extraoardinary
appeal with smash song numbers
that will make you laugh and
shout," while 1936 spotlighted Doo
dles Weaver and the Pi Phi Quar
tet's still - popular "Stanford in
Spring."
Hollywood talent scouts invaded
the Farm in 1937 when Gaieties of

fered a take-off on the way things
are done in Gower Gulch. Dailies
for Big Game week ran stories of
$1.50 tickets being scalped for $4.
WHERE WAS WOOIXOTT?
"A Boor from Cal and a Bunch
of Smooth People from Stanford"
made their appearance in the 1940
Gaieties. Stanford produced a Rose
Bowl team, and the stage show pro
duced an element of authenticity in
"The Man Who Came to Sunday
Night Supper on Friday Night
When They Weren't Serving It."
The "cream of the ASTP" talent
took over during war year 1943 to
put on "At Ease." Profits went to
war bonds. Nan Tillson and the
male quartet made Stanford histoiy
with "Every Night Is Ladies' Night
at Belt's."
In 1945 the Big Red Machine
made its post-war debut, and a
peacetime Gaieties found its way to
the Mem Aud for the first time
since the fall of '41. Since the Big
Game had yet to be revived, a Navy
theme was used; the entire show
was built around "how the Navy
I ought to be" and the audience
followed Tom, Dick, and Harry
through Alaska, Russia, France,
I Venice. Cuba, and Stanford.

Campus favorite Lloyd Nolan,

The show was advertised as "brim

The end of the roaring twenties

"Three Little Redskins, or from
Plow Boy to President," 1929 Gaie

"A Boor from Cal and a Bunch
of Smooth People from Stanford"

Gaieties. Stanford produced a Rose

"The Man Who Came to Sunday
Night Supper on Friday Night
When They Weren't Serving It."
The "cream of the ASTP" talent
took over during war year 1943 to
put on "At Ease." Profits went to

In 1945 the Big Red Machine
made its post-war debut, and a
peacetime Gaieties found its way to
the Mem Aud for the first time

Back near the turn of the century,
