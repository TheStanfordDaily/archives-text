LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. 18
I (UP). — The United States today
proposed a year-long study of ways
to curb the Big Five veto power in
the United Nations, but Russia
made clear that it would veto any
attempt to change the basic rule of
Big Five unanimity.
The exchange came as the UN
political committee neared a bal
lot on proposals designed to put
some limit on the power of the Big
Five — the United States, Russia,
Great Britain, France, and China.
Any of these nations may block an
important decision in the UN Se
curity Council.
American Delegate John Foster
Dulles reaffirmed that the United
Slates was willing to drop the veto
power over all except the most
serious UN problems—such as the
ordering of sanctions or military
moves against an offending nation.
Dulles proposed specifically that
the veto over recommendations for
/■eaceful settlements of disputes be
abolished.
To start the ball rolling, Dulles
proposed that the 57-nation "Little
Assembly" study the whole veto
vet-up, and recommend changes to
next year's Assembly. He said the
Big Five should consult among
themselves over how to prevent
abuse of their power.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
promptly implied that the United '
States was playing politics with the
veto issue.
"The United States is well aware
that such a study cannot result in
anvthing that would contradict the
(UN) charter," Gromyko said.

CHICAGO, Nov. 18 (UP).—Sec
retary of State George C. Marshall
tonight accused Russia of deliber- !
ately blocking European recovery, i
and said the United States would j
refuse to "stand by and watch the j
disintegration of the international |
community to which we belong."
He asserted that the Soviets had
chosen to destroy American good ;
will built up for them during the 1
war, and now had goaded this coun
try almost to "active resentment" j
against their "brazen and eontemp- j
tuous" foreign policy propaganda.
He said, however, that despite its j
strength, the United Stales could j
"afford to discount the alarms and
excursions intended to distract us,
and to proceed with calm determi
nation along the path (to world
peace) which our traditions have j
defined."
