"What looks good to our eyes looks good to the Oriental eye," Millard
B. Rogers, assistant professor of art, told his Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night in Memorial Auditorium. He was speaking on "How to
Evaluate Chinese Art."
Chinese art is not as different from European art as most of us suppose,
he declared.
"The problems of the Chinese artist have not been different from those

â™¦of the European artist, and as a
result they have found similar solu
tions to those problems."
To illustrate his points Professor
Rogers made comparisons between
i Chinese and European art by means
of black and white slides. These
show, he said, that both forms of art
have followed similar patterns of
style although their content may be
different.
He followed up this statement,
however, by declaring that there is
no diffusion between European and
Chinese art. European artists, he
said, are more interested in details of
the human body as a biological or
ganism, while Chinese artists place
more importance on literal patterns
and steer clear of material aspects.
