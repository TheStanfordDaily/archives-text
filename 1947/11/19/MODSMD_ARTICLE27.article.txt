# Flu Vaccine Available Now
## 
### 
Preventative vaccine for influenza
has arrived at Student Health Serv
ice, and vaccinations on a voluntary
basis will be given to students at
the Health Service offices for the
balance of this week, Dr. George
Houck, Health Service director, an
nounced yesterday. Vaccinations
will be administered all day today,
tomorrow afternoon, and all day
Friday.
Dr. Houck strongly recommended
that every student take the vaccine
and be forearmed against the com
ing "danger months" of possible in
fluenza epidemics. Only one injec
tion is necessary for prevention; in
eight days the immunization is at
a high level, lasting from four to
five months.
The vaccine has no effect on the
common cold, strep throat, or any
respiratory diseases except the in
fluenza viruses "A" and "B," which
together cause about 90 per cent of
influenza disability.
Dr. Houck stressed the fact that
the vaccinations are to be given on
a strictly voluntary basis. "The vac
cine does cause a temporarily un
pleasant reaction in many cases," he
pointed out. "It will not be given to
persons who are highly allergic to
egg protein, since the vaccine virus
culture is grown in chicken em
bryos."
"The Health Service hopes that a
high percentage of the students take
the vaccine," Dr. Houck added. "We
cannot be sure that an influenza ep
idemic will occur, but it is better to
take preventive measures now than
to gamble with the problematical
chance that an epidemic will not
materialize this winter. Widespread
influenza can have a chaotic effect
on such a closely knit place as a
college campus."
