# IIR Explains Organization
## 
### 
The above diagram was issued by
the lIR office to explain the rela
tionship between the National Stu
dents' Association, the Associated
Students of Stanford, their Institute
of International Relations, and the
committees associated with the lIR.
Membership in the ASSU auto
matically includes membership in
the NSA and the lIR. Both organi
zations operate under their own
constitutions and are responsible to
the ASSU Excom.
NSA activities are organized un
der two general committees, the
Domestic Commission and the In
ternational Commission. The func
tions of the International Commis
sion will be assumed as one of the
duties of the lIR, saving the organi
zation of an additional NSA com
mittee duplicating much of the llR's
work. A separate Domestic Com
mission will be set up.
The lIR has nine voting members
and a secretariat, in addition to such
ex-officio members as the Excom
representative. The voting members
are the president, vice-president,
and treasurer of the lIR, and the
chairmen of the six committees or
ganized under it. The secretariat
combines the office staff, publicity
and procurement directors, and
similar activities.
The six committees include:
SIRO, which sponsored the recent
Stanford relief drive and is in
charge of foreign relief work; the
ISC, which sends Stanford students
to Europe to report on conditions
there; and the Council for UNES
CO, which provides students with
information on foreign travel and
educational opportunities and is
working to set up a foreign stu
dents' scholarship program here.
Others are the ICC, which plans
the Western College Congress and
the Stanford International Confer
ence; the IDG, which holds organ
ized discussions on controversial is
sues; and the "I"' Club, which fos
ters social relations among our for
eign students.
