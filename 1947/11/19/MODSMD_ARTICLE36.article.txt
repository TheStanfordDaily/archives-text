### BILL ALLEN 
Stanford Alumni will have a squad replete with big names
when they meet the' Stanford varsity basketball team in the
Indians' opening game next Monday.
Coach Everett Dean said yesterday that there was some
chance that either or both of Stanford's all-time All Americans,

Jim Pollard and Hank Luisetti, will
be on hand for the game.
Among those definitely scheduled
to play are four members of the
NCAA championship team of 1942,
forwards Don Burness and Jack
Dana and guard Bill Cowden and
center John Eikleman. Don Wil
liams, who played on the conference
champion team of 1941, is also ex
pected to be in the alumni's lineup.
TKIO WITH 191 (J IHTTNERS
Burness, Williams, and Pollard
played with the Oakland Bittners
of the AAU Conference last year.
Others from the good teams of the
late no's and early 40's who are ex
pected to play include forwards Fred
Linari and Fred Oliver, guard John
Alltucker, and towering center Dick
Taylor.
From further back there are
guards Bob Burnett and 11. B. Lee,
both of whom have been assistant
coaches at Stanford.
DEAN TIJIES COMBOS
Coach Dean has been working with
several five man combinations in
scrimmages the last week. Those
who will do the bulk of the work in
the Indians' first games include: for
wardsâ€”Morley Thompson, regular
last year; Milt Iverson and Bill Dre
hobl, reserves; George Yardley up
from the jayvees; and Bill Rose,
Menlo J.C. transfer.
At center Steve Stephenson, first
stringer of last season; Bob Penn,
veteran of the 1941 team; and Ralph
Carver, from the B team, lead the
candidates.
(APT BABE HEADS GUARDS
Captain Babe Higgins and Dave
Davidson of last year's first team;
Bob Lewis and Gus Chavalas re
serves last year; and Jack Scharfen
are the guards who figure most
prominently in Dean's plans.
In an informal scrimmage for non
lettermen last week again Moffett
Field, Yardley, Rose, Carver, and
Scharfen were especially impressive.
