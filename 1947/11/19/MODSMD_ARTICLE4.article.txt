# Where Is '51?
## 
### 
[ Editorial ]
The Big Game bonfire is set
for tomorrow night. In the past
three days only six members
of the class of '51 have showed
up to work on the bonfire.
It is a tradition that the con
struction and guarding of the
bonfire is left in the hands of
the frosh men. It is a big job.
Six people cannot possibly
manage it.
The success or failure of all
Big Game week activities de
pends upon the energy of a
large number of students. The
parade floats, house decora
tions, rally, and gaieties are the
product of a lot of work done
by a great number of students.
The student-body looks to the
frosh for a successful bonfire,
and the freshmen have always
come through.
A great deal of work must be
done on the bonfire to make up
for time lost in the past three
days. The class of '51 must turn
out in full force today and to
morrow.
Until this year no one has had
to urge the freshmen to do the
job of building or guarding the
bonfire during Big Game week.
It is up to the frosh to take over
their responsibiilty and make
their contribution to Big Game
week a success.—M.S.
