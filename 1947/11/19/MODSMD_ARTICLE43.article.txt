NEW YORK, Nov. 18 (UP).â€”Of
ficials investigating the Billy Fox-
Jake LaMotta fight were reported
today to have unearthed evidence of
the biggest betting scandal in sports
history.
At the same time a legislative in
vestigation of boxing in New York
State was demanded by the Demo
cratic party.
CHECK LAMOTTA FINANCES
Although there were no formal
announcements it was said the in
quiry into last Friday night's fight
at Madison Square Garden which
Fox won on a technical knockout in
the fourth round had led to a study
of LaMotta's finances. It was indi
cated that a move may be made to
impound his bank account.
Both the New York Boxing Com
mission, under chairman Eddie Ea
gan, and District Attorney Frank S.
Hogan began investigations into (he
bout. Hogan refused to reveal what
course his inquiry had taken, but it
was said that persons close to Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey had been inter
ested in the case because of the al
leged huge gambling coup.
ODDS SWING TO FOX
When the bout was arranged, La
Motta, who never before had been
knocked out, was favored but on the
afternoon of the fight the odds drop
ped to 6 to 5 and pick 'em. Later,
the odds favored Fox and when they
went as high as 3 to 1 on the Phila
delphia Negro, bookmakers refused
to accept any more Fox money. But
they continued to take LaMotta
money.
Millions were reported to have
been bet throughout the country
and one New York bookmaker
claimed that at least a week before
the fight the word was out that Fox
would win.
Eagan refused to reveal the wit
nesses who appeared before him or
what they said, with the exception
of Dr. Nicholas Salerno, LaMotta's
personal physician.
