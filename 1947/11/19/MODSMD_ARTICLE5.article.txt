# Workers Needed To Build Bonfire
## 
### 
Distressed wilh the slow progress
being made on the Big Game bon
fire, Bob Levison, chairman of the
freshman bonfire committee, yes
terday urged each freshman to do
his part in assuring its success.
"Thus far co-operation has been
very poor," he said. "I personally
urge every freshman to cut classes
Thursday, if necessary, so that he
can spend the entire day working
on the fire. It is up to the individ
ual frosh to see that the Class of
'51 will be distinguished for build
ing the biggest bonfire in the
school's history rather than for
shirking its duty."
"Workers are also desperately
needed today," Levison added.
"Any freshman who does not have
classes this afternoon should report
to the front steps of Encina at 1
o'clock. Freshmen living at the Vil
lage and off campus are expected to
do their part as well." he concluded.
Work will begin Thursday morn
ing at 8 o'clock and will continue
until nightfall at two locations: be-
hind the ROTC stables and at La-
gunita. Anyone able to furnish a
truck for hauling wood either to
day or Thursday is asked to contact
Levison or some other member of
the bonfire committee.
The bonfire will be lighted at 8:15
Thursday evening at Lake Lagu-
nita. following the team rally there
at 7:15.
