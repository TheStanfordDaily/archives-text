# Cards Working Hard for Cal; Injury List Skids to New Low
## 
### 
Trainer Connie Jarvis is just about.
the happiest man connected with j i
the Stanford varsity football team.
For the first time since the open
ing of the season, the Indians' injury
list is nearly down to rock bottom.
FELDMAN DEFINITELY OUT
Only guard Marty Feldman is def
initely out of the California game
this coming Saturday. Right half
hack Mickey Titus is a doubtful
player, depending on whether his
knee responds to workouts this week.
Meanwhile Coach March ie
Schwartz put his squad through a
combination offensive and defensive
workout yesterday in preparation for
the 50th Big Game.
HAMMETT TURNS BEAR
In the defensive drill, Assistant
Coach Ray Hammett was used to
help simulate part of the Golden
Bear backfield operating against
possible Cardinal defensive combina
tions.
The Bears, fresh off their fiO to 14
rout of Montana, have been installed
6-1 favorites, even money at 21
points, against the Cards. Cal has
captured eight out of nine contests
this year, losing only to the USC
Trojans 15!) to 14 in a mid-season Ti
tanic.
The Bears will be out to avenge
last year's 25 to 7 drubbing at Berke
ley and maintain their slim hopes of
winding up in Pasadena's Rose Bowl
net January I—contingent1—contingent upon a

UCLA win over USC in the PCC's
most important contest Saturday.
