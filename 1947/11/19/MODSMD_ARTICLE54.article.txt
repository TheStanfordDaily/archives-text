# Honor Code Revision Suggested
## 
### 
The Honor Code Standing Committee tonight
will submit to Excom for reconsideration a re
vision of the Honor Code.
The comniitie e recommends that "students
wishinq to take an examination outside the
assigned room first consult the instructor."
This revision is supported by Men's Council
also.
The committee believes that the change in
t l, e Honor Code will clarify the relationship be
/vveen student and faculty in the application of
the code.
]im Welch, chairman of Men's Council, says
that most violations of the Honor Code involve
persons leaving rooms to take exams. He be

lieves that when tests are taken outside of the
classroom the third-person responsibility which
is essential to the proper functioning of the
Honor Code is missing.
The Honor Code Committee particularly calls
attention to the fact that the revision does not
prohibit students from leaving class. It only re
quires that a student who.plans to take his exam
outside the class consult with the instructor.
Principal objection to the new revision is that
it weakens ihe Honor Code. The committee,
however, believes that the new clarification
coming from the students will add strength to
the Code and aid in its proper functioning.
