# 'Thought' Before 'Action'

Yesterday's editorial concerned a recommen
dation which was to be passed at tonight's Ex
com meeting—a recommendation which in ef
fect would be the opening wedge in a drive for
a new student union.
The recommendation is probably appropri
ate at this time. But the manner of its presen
tation Monday was not. It was hastily prepared
and no attempt had been made to answer the
questions upon which an intelligent vote would,
of necessity, depend.
The student union question may not come up
tonight. If no official action is taken The Daily
will not print any information which would in

jure the chances of eventually beginning a stu
dent union fund.
But just so there is no misunderstanding —The
Daily will severely criticize any action taken by
Excom tonight which will affect the Stanford
student body without prior publication of the
pros and cons of that action.
There have been too many cases at Stanford
where the students have paid dearly for the
mistakes, passive and active, that previous
ASSU officers made.
A good example in two words —Memorial
Auditorium.
