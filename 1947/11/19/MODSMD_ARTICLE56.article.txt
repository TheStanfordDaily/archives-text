Athletics. How I love them. Basketball, baseball,
track, and football. Hose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Gravy
Bowl, and Finger Bowl. Ebbets Field, Shilo Field,
Wrigley Field, and Marshall Field.
All year round this fighting spirit, and spiritful
lighting, struggling courage, and courageous struggle.
It all brings back days when I was quite an athlete.
Then 1 lost my yo-yo. How disappointed I was. They
hadn't yet invented the bub-a-loon set, so I went out
for the football team. But the girls kicked me off the
squad when they found out I was a boy. I knew I
couldn't go all season without a shower.
I never will forget the day I was calling a girl
in New York long distance from California. A piece
of elastic strap broke on that end, thus setting, unof
ficially of course, the longest completed pass on record.
How the crowd cheered. How I wish I could have been
there.
Then spring came, and I ran to the track coach.
"Coach, coach—l'm going out for track."
"Oh really," he mumbled.
"No. the pole vault," I laughed. But the laugh
echoed back hollow and I figured I was in some sort
of a mental canyon.
A canyon 1 told myself is a rut that got out of
hand, and a rut is a grave with both ends kicked out.

Get out of it now. I told myself, this isn't rutting reason.
I loved baseball. How I used to practice. Even in
grammar school I used to throw balls with a
curve. I was the only kid whose spit balls had the
Goodhousing Seal of Approval. I stood for clcan sports
manship.
Then I tried to play for the West Point ballclub,
but they said I would have to have an appointment to
the school from a politician.
"I'll call Mr. Lincoln," I told them.
"That will be hard to do," they said.
"No it isn't," I snickered, "I've got his Gettysburg
address."
"But he's dead," they chided, ignoring my little
mot.
"Aha — if not a good politician, then better a first
class corpse," I added, quoting from an old Poly Sci
text, a Greek philosopher, and the Republican hand
book.
But I didn't get in. and following Robert Hutchin's
advice I came to Stanford to play ball.
I didn't get on the team here either, but I've still
got the joyous enthusiasm, the enthusiastic joy, the
rewarding glory, and the glorious reward.
Besides, I found my yo-yo.
