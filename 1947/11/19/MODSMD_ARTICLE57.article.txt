# CAMPUS OPINION
## Rudechap Plan 
### 
To the Editor:
It would appear that chivalry, solid virtue of a
dimly remembered era may be in the process of a re
birth but this time championed by another sex. Three
young ladies (Daily Nov. 14), hearts aching at the
sight of throngs of dispirited young men milling about
on their doorstep, have suggested a revolutionary pro
posal which bids fair to tear up the roots of twentieth
century courting as it is known to us. Stanford men,
the campus over, unable to predict accurately the vol
ume of air in their billfolds 3 weeks hence or their
study load, would do well to give a standing vote of
thanks to the proponents of the measure that eager
dating be outlawed. All will thus be assured a chance
to compete on an equal basis and this is the Stanford
tradition. I should like to suggest that it be called
the RUDECHAP PLAN in honor of its co-authors, the
Misses Rukin. Denham, and Chapman.
One or two amendments, however, offered purely
in the spirit of cooperation may not be out of order.
(1) All male students interested in companionship
for the following Saturday night will proceed to the
Stadium parking area at 4 o'clock each Monday after
noon where they will be lined up in order of ascending
height. Football and track men will be assigned to the
end of the line and hobbled with 10 pound leg irons.
(2) At some prearranged signal such as "Go" men
will be permitted to depart for the women's living
group of their choice. Tripping, gouging, or clipping
from behind will not be tolerated and may be punish
able by the loss of 25 yards, or for severe infractions
forfeiture of the Saturday nights' privilege.
(?,) First aid stations will be set up at the library,
the post office and in front of Roble Hall with trained
nurses in attendance. Male hospital aides will be on
hand to look after the nurses.
(4) Those unfortunates who are unable to attain
their desired objective will be given a 2 minute head
.start and a AAA Priority (convertible class) the
following Monday.
Let us take fresh courage, fellows, then pass the
bottle along for brighter and better Saturday nights are
ahead for all.
