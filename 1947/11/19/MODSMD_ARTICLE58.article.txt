# Cardinal Classics

To the Editor:
In reply to Kathryn Parker's letter about the Car
dinal Classics program, about all I can do at the pres
ent time i- to apologize for the program a week ago
yesterday. Honest, Kitty, I was less happy about the

whole thing than you are when I heard that it had
been effectively loused up. The program planned for
that night was Beethoven's Symphony No. 6 and
Franck's "Variations Symphoniques."
A chap named Wheelon, from the Sigma Chi house,
had obligingly written the script, and so everything
Was all setâ€”or so I thought when I trundled me off to
the game Friday afternoon. Somewhere in the melee
either the music or the script got lost, and that was
that (have you ever dropped into the KSU offices on
Sunday night? Elsewhere is peace and quiet, but at
KSU even the mice can run typewriters and shout).
Even so, I was surprised to sec that somebody
noticed the difference. From the amount of suggestions
wo have been getting for selections to play on Cardinal
Classics, I thought that nobody listened to the pro
gram. Good Lord, how can you expect me to play
what you like, if I don't hear from you what you do
like? Personally, I detest Mozart's quartets, but since
I can't'get the program in the Village anyhow, I
thought we might as well play a little of the "old
masters." As for me, give me the soothing, restful
melodies of Shostakovich any day. How about you?
