# Class of '51
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The letter of Misses Sue Ruskin, Mary Denham and
Liz Chapman in November 14 campus opinion referred
to the "Children" of the class of '51.
The freshmen are the youngest people on campus.
Various individuals of dubious intelligence and ma
turity feel obliged to pass comment on this. Some
stand on the lawn of Encina and get hoarse yelling
"To Hell with '51." Others attempt humor in letters to
the Editor.
