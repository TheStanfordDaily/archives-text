# Axe Responsibility
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I agree with your editorial, "We Have an Axe to
Grind." Responsibility for care of The Axe should be
fixed with some group. I suggest for this honor Rally
Com or a rejuvenated Block "S" Society or a new
group with that sole responsibility to be known by
some such name as the Stanford Axe Society. Such a
group would not only look after the Axe during the
year but assume the important job of transporting it to
and from Big Games.
