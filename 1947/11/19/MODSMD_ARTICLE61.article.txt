# Women's Conference Furthers Interests of Stanford Women
## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Women's Conference, a governing
body, representative of Stanford
women, has its roots firmly embed- 1
ded in the past.
It originated as the Executive
Board of the Women's League, a
group organized on Jan. 24, 1902,
"to promote friendliness and co-op
eration among the women of the
University."
At that time, however, the Exec
utive Board was called the Presi
dent's Conference of Young Wom
en, a group made up of a chairman,
a secretary, and representatives of
the women's clubs and sororities,
which met at regular intervals with
the President of the University.
In 1910, the President's Confer
ence was dissolved on the grounds
that it was not a truly representa
tive body. The women then organ
ized themselves into the Organized |
Women Students with a legislative
body called Women's Student Con
ference. It consisted of 15 members, )
with one upperclass woman elected j
from each sorority, six upperclass j
women from Roble, and two upper
class women from the unorganized J
women. These were elected by j
women having at least one semes- j
ter's standing.
The Conference took its present |
form in 1930 as the legislative body i
of the Associated Women Students
of Stanford, with the presidents of
the women's residences and elected
representatives from the freshmen,
graduate, and off - campus women
representing the women students.
Today Women's Conference has
31 members, in addition to a presi
dent, vice-president, and secretary
who are elected at the regular
spring quarter election. Present of
ficers are President Phyllis Suther
land from Hurlburt House, Vice- !
President Taffy Countryman from

Lagunita, and Secretary Joan Max
well from Storey House. Treasurer
Shirley Calder from Roth House is
an ex-officio member appointed by
the president and Advisory Board.
With its purpose that of further
ing the interests of the Farm coeds,
Women's Conference must approve
all matters pertaining to women
students. It can recommend
changes in existing regulations and
by-laws and has power to make
rules to enforce ASSU by-laws af
fecting the women.
Standing committees of Confer
ence are Housing Committee, which
originated the new social program
for freshman women; Vocom, which
offers talks on vocational opportu

nitics for women during winter
quarter; and the Committee on So
cial regulations, which drew up the
social regulations passed the first
of the quarter.
Advisory Board, a smaller group
consisting of Conference officers
and representatives from each res
idence area, discusses the Confer
ence agenda before the regular
meeting.


To further the interests of Farm coeds is the purpose of Women's
Conference, whose present officers are from left to right, Taffy Country
man, vice-president, Phyllis Sutherland, president, Joan Maxwell, secre
