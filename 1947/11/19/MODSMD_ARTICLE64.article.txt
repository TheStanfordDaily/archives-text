# Candidates for New ISC Chairman To Be Interviewed Today at Union
## 
### 
Interviews for a new ISC chair
man will be continued today from
10 to 11 a.m. by present chairman
Bob Hoyt in the student body pres
ident's office in the Old Union.
Hoyt plans to retire his chairman
ship to take more time with his
studies and Exeom position. With
the slowest period of International
Survey Committee work coming up
this winter quarter, he will be able
j to turn the position over to a new
I chairman in time for the new leader
j to learn the ISC ropes.
Chief amount of work for an ISC
chairman, Hoyt said, lies in organ
izing the summer overseas survey
trip during the spring quarter and
compiling the data in the autumn.
Spare time plus organization ability
j make up the most important pre

requisites for the position. Class
position within the University does
not matter, Hoyt added.
This summer Bill Fairer and
Lawrence Grannis went through a
number of the European countries.
The two men are wining up their
reports now. After they are com
pleted, the reports will be distrib
uted to a number of Farm organiza
tions and to most of the Western
colleges and universities.
