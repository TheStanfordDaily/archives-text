Its Something
To Write Home About
All Right!
THE WAY Wilson s Southern chef and
staff of Southern cooks prepare chicken
or bake ham, "do up" a juicy steak, con
coct soups, toss salads, and bake those
wonderful hot biscuits (served with but
ter and honey) is "something to write
home about"!
And that's just what Stanford stu
dents have been doing for years and years
and years. And many, many of Stan
ford's families come to Wilson's for din
ner when they are visiting their Stanford
student offspring.
Next time you want a delicious din
ner with visiting relatives, bring them to
Wilson's.
