# Big Game Dance Ends Celebration
## 
### 
Big Game Weekend will end with
the Big Game dance, sponsored by
Cardinals, to be held Saturday in
the Pavilion from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m,.
featuring Ray Hackett. The dance,
part of the traditional Big Game
celebration, will be a semi-formal
affair, with dressy dresses, but not
formals, to be worn by the women,
and suits by the men.
Expenses for the Big Game week
end are traditionally split by the
couple, so that the man won't have
to stop eating for the rest of ihe
quarter. Bids for the Big Game
dance are being sold at the ASSU
office for $3.00. The fellows ought
to be able to dig up half of that if
the women can. Bids will be sold at
the door for those who decide to go
at the last minute.
