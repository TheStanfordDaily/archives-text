# Thirty Card Stunts Set
## 
### 
Thirty intricate card stunts will ,
|be flashed before the California !
j student body Saturday at the Big
Game, announced Dave Heyler, j
j Rally Com co-chairman.
"These 30 stunts will be executed
; in 20 minutes by a section 60 rows !
[ high and 50 seats across, said Hey- j
j ler, "the largest card section yet at- \
J tempted in the Pacific Coast Con- j
| ference. The co-operation and close >
I attention of the entire rooting sec
| tion will therefore be needed to
i make them a success."
IN TECHNICOLOR
"The stunts will also be filmed in '
| technicolor for possible showing all ;
â–  over the country," he added.
Among the animated and non-an
| imated stunts being planned are a i
big bear swinging merrily on a I
! swing and eventually being "dis- I
| posed of" by an ingenious little In
| dian, a signature stunt, and the ;
! painting of the Cal "C" red, Heyler
i revealed.
Rooters are reminded that the
i cards should be held at eye level i
I and should not be flipped until the |
I signal is given.
DON'T FORGET
Rooters are asked to remember
| their row number for the animated
j stunts. This number appears on the ;
i top of the instruction card. For the I
j flip card stunts students should hold
; the card up for the first in the
! series, with the card for the flip 1
backed to it.
Should a third change occur, the
j student may slip the third card in
! while holding up the second. Alter
j the stunts, cards should be passed
j to the Rally Com members in the -
j aisle.
There will be the traditional Big j
; Game split rooting sections, Heyler
: stated. Women will enter the Sta
dium at Gates A or Band will sit
in Section E. Men will come in by
Gale I and proceed along the desig
nated path to Sections D and DD.
DOWN THE MIDDLE
There will be a rope down the
| middle of the men's rooting section,
j and the men will be able to sit at
| any level in the section but must
, start the seating from the rope and
fill all the seats from the rope out
j ward, Heyler said. Rooters arc re
i quested to sit directly over the
cards, which will be tacked under
the scats. A Rally Com member
! should be notified of vacant seats.
Pompoms and rooters' caps are
, compulsory, and white must be
worn for admittance into the sec
| tions. Rooters are also urged to
j bring their feathers and mega
-1 phones.
