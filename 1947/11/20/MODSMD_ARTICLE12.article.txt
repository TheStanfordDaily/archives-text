Based on the theme of "Stanford
Cavalcade," 53 floats have been en
tered in the parade. A list of the
floats in their order of appearance
in the parade will be published in
tomorrow's Daily. Floats should be
lined up in that order on the far side
of Lagunita before the parade. A
place will be marked for each float.
Descriptions of all floats should
be turned in to the ASSU office,
stated Phyllis Graham, float chair
man, in order that (he judges will be
able to remember the floats.
