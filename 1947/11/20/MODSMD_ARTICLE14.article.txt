# Bonfire Tradition Continues 49 Years Undaunted by Cal, Wartime Austerity
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
"Bonfire Burns," a 1928 Daily
extra headline announced with
type usually reserved for dec
laration of war. Cal raiders were
blamed for the premature blaze,
and it was thought they had left
a time bomb which set off the
fire.
The Daily went on to say that ,
| '"before more than one member of [
Rally Committee had even appeared j
4 on the scene, there was already a j
well - organized sentiment for the |
rebuilding of the California funeral j
1 pyre."
I This second bonfire Jjuilt that day i
was said to be one of the most sue- j
cessful of the many, many Big
1 Game bonfires which Stanford has ;
burned.
WAY BACK WHEN
It all started back in 1898 when
I the women, who were Riving a pre- j

Big Game rally in old Roble, de
cided that the Roble living rooin
was too small. So it was moved
that they adjourn outside where the
"Zetes gallantly piled barrels for a
fire."
The burning of the "Big C" fence
was the highlight of the 1904 bon
fire rally. The Daily Palo Alto re
ports that "the fence was taken from
the Cal campus by a number of
Stanford men after the seizure of
the Stanford Axe five years ago. At
California it was as much esteemed
as the seniors' fence at Yale.
"The fence was brought around
the bay with great effort, but since
it has been on the campus not much
has been done with it because of its
unwieldiness."
11)11 CLASSIC
Rooters danced the serpentine on
Inner Quad in 1911 before the Stan
ford-Cal classic, that year rugby,
by the light of red fire and then
moved on to the bonfire, built by
the Class of 1915 behind the Inn,

Cal burned the bonfire in 1925,
too, but classes were dismissed for
the day, Palo Alto merchants sent
lumber and oil, and a second wood
en pile was soon erected.
Doodles Weaver's famous "Nuts
to Cal" yell was first heard at the
rally before the 1936 bonfire, and
1939 victory-hungry Indians were
told that moving the bonfire to the
field behind Branner would make it
lose none of its "Lagunita Lake
glory."
STANFORDITES UNCONVINCED
Wartime austerity failed to con
vince Stanford ites that bonfires
were not a necessary part of Farm
tradition—so, lacking a Big Game, a
bonfire was held on the Lagunita
Lake bed for the Stanford-Merchant
Marine game.
Last year, when Big Games were
resumed, the bonfire again became
the big event that it had been for
over half a century, and Stanford
once more burned "the dirty Golden
Bear" if not in reality, at least in
effigy.

I the women, who were Riving a pre- j

Big Game rally in old Roble, de

The burning of the "Big C" fence
was the highlight of the 1904 bon

ports that "the fence was taken from
the Cal campus by a number of
Stanford men after the seizure of
the Stanford Axe five years ago. At
California it was as much esteemed
as the seniors' fence at Yale.
"The fence was brought around
the bay with great effort, but since
it has been on the campus not much
has been done with it because of its
unwieldiness."

Rooters danced the serpentine on
Inner Quad in 1911 before the Stan
ford-Cal classic, that year rugby,

the Class of 1915 behind the Inn,

Cal burned the bonfire in 1925,
too, but classes were dismissed for
the day, Palo Alto merchants sent
lumber and oil, and a second wood
en pile was soon erected.
Doodles Weaver's famous "Nuts
to Cal" yell was first heard at the
rally before the 1936 bonfire, and
1939 victory-hungry Indians were
told that moving the bonfire to the
field behind Branner would make it
lose none of its "Lagunita Lake
glory."
STANFORDITES UNCONVINCED
Wartime austerity failed to con
vince Stanford ites that bonfires
were not a necessary part of Farm
tradition—so, lacking a Big Game, a
bonfire was held on the Lagunita
Lake bed for the Stanford-Merchant
Marine game.
Last year, when Big Games were
resumed, the bonfire again became
the big event that it had been for
over half a century, and Stanford
once more burned "the dirty Golden
Bear" if not in reality, at least in
effigy.
