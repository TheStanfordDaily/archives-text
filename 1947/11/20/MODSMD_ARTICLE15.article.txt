# Stanford's Tokyo Branch Stages Pre-Big Game Rally
## 
### 
A "Big Game" rally in Tokyo, by the Tokyo Stanford Club, last week
resulted in recordings of Stanford songs being shipped to Tokyo by KSU,
Stanford broadcasting station.
Lieut. Col. Hubert G. Schenck, spokesman for the group of Stanford
alumni now in that area, cabled the Alumni office on Nov. 11, that the
recordings were much desired for a rally previous to the Stanford-Cal foot
ball game Saturday. Filling of the request was complicated by two facts.
First, no commercial recordings of Stanford songs were available. Second,
Tokyo time is a day ahead of Stanford.
Byron S. Phillips, KSU manager, stated that special copies of private
station recordings were made. Arrangements were made with the Naval
Air Transport Service at Moffett Field to rush the package to Tokyo.
Lieutenant Wilson, Public Information Officer at Moffett, assured KSU
that the records would not follow regular air routes, but would be
passed personally from pilot to pilot in the fastest possible time.
In addition to standard renditions of the Stanford Hymn, the Stan
ford marching song, "Come Join the Band," and "Sons of the Stanford
Red," the records contained a special greeting from "Stanford Sadie"—
KSU's own sccret answer to the wartime "Tokyo Rose"—and a new
recording of Doodles Weaver singing his famous "Nuts to Cal" song.
From Charlie Leong in Shanghai, China we hear:
"Busy this week on publicity for the first full-fledged "Big-Game"
celebration in the Far East since the war. Stanford and Cal are really
going to have a time."


The leaping flames of the traditional Big Gaine bonfire will be wit
nessed by Stanford coeds and roughs tonight at S: 15 at Lake Lagunita.
