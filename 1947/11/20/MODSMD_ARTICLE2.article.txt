LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y.. Nov. 19 (UP).—Arab states demanded today
that the United Nations set up Palestine as an independent, Arab-con
trolled stale, and warned that any attempt to partition the Holy Land
would touch of? hostilities that would continue for some time.
The warning—the bluntest yet sounde'd—was contained in a 66-page
Palestine program written by six Arab states and the Moslem countries
of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The Arab plan called for:
1. End of British rule of Palestine and withdrawal of all British troops
within one year.
2. Creation of a single Palestine state, completely independent and ruled
by the Arab majority.
3. Ending of Jewish immigration to Palestine, except as part of a
world-wide program under which all nations would accept some refugees.
The Arabs challenged UN to ask the International Court of Justice
whether UN had a legal right to partition Palestine. The Arabs said
UN had no authority to carve up a state against the will of the majority
of its citizens.
