# Rally to Feature 'Dirty Bear' Song
## 
### 
These are the words to "The Dirty
Golden Bear," to be sung at the
rally tonight.
The dirty Golden Bear
Is losing all his hair.
His teeth are out;
He's got the gout;
He don't know what it's all about.
His eyes are made of glass;
He's losing all his (lass.
So down with California;
The Golden Bear has won his last.
