# Students Asked To Walk to Game
## 
### 
The police department anticipates
the biggest crowd in Big Game his
tory Saturday: 90,000 people and
26,200 automobiles. Chief of Police
Gordon Davis therefore requests
that students and other campus
residents park their automobiles
behind their living units and walk
to the game.
This would be advisable from the
students' point of view, too, because
more time would be spent tryirtg to
find parking space, than would have
been saved by driving.
Davis warns the residents of the
different living units, especially
fraternity members, about the dan
ger of leaving their houses un
guarded Saturday, because houses
in the past have been burglarized
when everyone left for the Big
Game.
He recommends that each house
arrange for the cook or someone else
to stay at home and listen to the
game on the radio, so as to be on
hand to "greet" visitors.
