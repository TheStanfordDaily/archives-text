"Their ability to compromise,
learned in handling family quarrels,
stands them in good stead in the
UN," she continued.
She told of the battle in the UN
for new members on the Security
Council. There was a deadlock be

twccn India and the Ukraine. The

wasn't going to be responsible for
dissension in the Security Council."
UNWILLING MEN
