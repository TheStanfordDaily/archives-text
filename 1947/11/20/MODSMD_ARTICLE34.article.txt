Providing an effective means for

the clinics follow the same line as

TO DIVIDE CLINICS
The clinics will be divided ac
| cording to location and interest; for
I example, Catholic schools from
Northern California will be mem
bers of a different clinic than junior
colleges in the North, and will only
occasionally meet with Catholic
1 schools in Southern California.
By making these divisions the

clinics can meet more frequently,
and by paralleling them into inter
est groups there would be a more
valuable exchange of information,
according to Ginny Titus, Stanford
NSA chairman.
