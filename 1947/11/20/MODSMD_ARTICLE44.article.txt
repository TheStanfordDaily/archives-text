# Jayvees Meet Ramblers Sat.
## 
### 
Furious last-minute preparations
for Saturday's football menu is not
confined to the varsity alone, for
the Stanford jayvees are propping
themselves for a contest that is
likely to prove every bit as tough
as their older brothers' game.
Yesterday's drill found the jun
iors running through dummy scrim
mage and practicing variations of
older plays. John Rosekrans has
been brought in from the varsity to
bolster the jayvees' center slot, and
is expected to give aid to Jack Por
ter, the hard working pivot man.
NO SCRIMMAGE SCHEDULED
The jayvees came out of last Sat
urday's 26 to 14 victory over Cali
fornia Aggies without injuries. But
Coach Jim Cox is scheduling no
heavy scrimmages for either tonight
or tomorrow, to keep his squad at
nearly full strength.
Only man on the Indian injury list
is Bill ShefTles, hard running full
back. The big fellow injured his
leg during the Fort Ord contest
earlier this year.
California's Ramblers, the coun
terpart to the Farm JVs, are ex
pected to give the Indian juniors a
very rough afternoon.
RAMBLERS HEAVY FAVORITES
On the basis of past performances,
the Ramblers are rated 20-point
favorites over the Cards.
But the local jayvees go into their
closing game on their schedule with
a three won-one lost record. The
Coxmen have rambled over Fort
Ord, the Stanford frosh. and the Cal
Aggie eleven, for their wins this
season.
