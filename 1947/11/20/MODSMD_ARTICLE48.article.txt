# Shinkickers Have Long History at Stanford; Foundations Laid by Harry Maloney in 1910

### JOHN BREIER 
The sun never seis on the British
Empire or the game of soccer.
From its humble beginning, lost
in the history of man, to its present
status as one of the world s most
widely played sports, the game of
soccer has prospered and spread to
the four corners of the world.
DATES BACK TO 1900
Stanford's contribution to the
sport dates back to the turn of the
century when the English game
was introduced to the campus. To
day, some 40 years later, the Indians
are readying themselves for the last
game of the year, their annual
meeting with the University of Cali
fornia.
in 1910, after the Stanford soccer
team had been taken into the Cali
fornia Football League. Excom voted
to give financial aid to the extent of
$15. Harry Maloney, the man who
is considered to be the father of
rugby and soccer at Stanford, was
coach at that time, and it was his
work that laid the foundations lor
the present day set up of those
sports here on the Farm.
Throughout the years the popu
larity of the sport at Stanford has
fluctuated with the game being rat
ed as tops as a spectator sport in
some years and waning in others.
SOCCER OLD SPORT
Soccer is the direct descendent
of the earliest games known to man;
the simple sport of kicking a ball
or inflated cow bladder. The game
as we know it today is attributed
to the British Isles. From there it
has spread in direct proportion to
the spread of the English Empire.
The name soccer Is a contraction
of the .word "association." In 1863
the argument as to whether the ball
could be picked up and carried led
to a parting of the ways between
the warring sections. The group
that advocated kicking formed the
"Rules of London Football Associa
tion." This became known as asso
ciation football and was later short
ened to "socker" and then to "soc
cer."
FOOTBALL DOOMS POPULARITY
Soccer has never gained the pop
ularity in America that it enjoys in
other parts of the world and any
chance of it ever becoming a major
sport was doomed with the advent of
American football.
At Stanford, soccer is in the minor
sport class; but as such it draws one
of the largest turnouts and is first
on the SAC budget for minor sports.
In 1946 Dave Tappan, a graduate
student in the School of Business,
took over the job of mentoring the
shinkickers and led them to a sec
ond place standing in their league.
This year's team has played but
three games, tieing one and losing'
two by close scores. Their oppon
ents of next Saturday, California,
boast an undefeated record in league
play and will be heavy favorites to
remain so after this week's tilt.
But the Cards will be taking aim

at stopping the Golden Bear's vie- I
tory march for the 1947 soccer sea- !
