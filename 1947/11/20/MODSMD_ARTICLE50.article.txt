## 
### 
Big Game week is well under way and along
with it comes the Farm's first Homecoming cel
ebration since pre-war days.
All Stanford alumni are invited to attend this
week's student sponsored activities. The re
maining two performances of the Gaieties, to
night's rally and bonfire, and tomorrow's par
ade will be presented for the alumni and the
student body alike.
In order to reacguaint the returning alumni
with the campus and introduce them to the
changes that have taken place, all living groups
are planning open houses and buffet lunches
before the game Saturday.

The Village has planned an over all "open
house" for the benefit of returning Stanford
men and women who would like to see how the
present University housing problem is being
solved.
The campus is going all out to welcome back
the "old timers." The next two days will be
filled with an exchange of reminiscences and
stories about the progress of the Farm.
The Homecoming tradition is an opportunity
for the members of many different Stanford
classes to get-together, an opportunity that
comes too seldom.
