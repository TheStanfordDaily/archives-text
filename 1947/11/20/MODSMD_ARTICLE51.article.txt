# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
I went lo see a Rally Com member the other day,
and found him reading a newspaper. As I approached
I saw the newspaper was upside down.
This struck me as being as unusual as a sober
delegate at a fraternity picnic, so I stood and watched.
After he had finished deciphering Mumbles from
the paper's inverted position, I said:
"Pardon me, but do you realize that you've been
reading your newspaper upside down?"
"Of course I do you damn fool," he sneered, "don't
you realize that it's harder to do that way? It's part
of Rally Com policy. That which you work hard for
is enjoyed more. People have things too easy. Do it
the hard way."
It occurred to me that he must have been a 2nd.
Lieut, during the war.
"Is that why I have to go way around the stadium
through gate I to get into the football games?" I asked.
"Certainly," he answered, pacing the floor on his
hands, "a detour is the longest distance between two
points. It makes you appreciate the game more
when you see it."
"But I didn't see all the game," I told him, "I met
a herd of Herefords coming south and didn't get
through the tunnel until half time."
"Alia," he said, lighting a cigarette with flint and
tinder, "but didn't you enjoy sitting in the rooting
section all the more because of the effort?"
"But I didn't get to sit in the rooting section," I said,
"I got a will, and we couldn't sit together except on
the 20-yard line."

"Makes you appreciate the girl more," he assured
me.
"And how come we haven't*got a bunch of dancing
girl yell leaders like the Oregon team had?" I asked.
"That's the easy way," he said, "it's a cinch to
arouse school .spirit with those flashy devices. It's much
harder to do, the way we run things.
"That's the trouble with college students—they're
getting soft. They don't know what it means to earn
their privileges. They want everything handed lo
them the simple way.
"Take me for example. I always put my shoes on
before I put my socks on. Sure it's a hard job, but
that's how I got to be the big success I am today—hard
work. This isn't an easy world, kid. You've got to
take punishment and still come out on top. Some
times I go home at night, and pound my thumb with
a hammer. That's no fun, but it feels so good when
I stop."
"Gee." I said, impressed, "I hadn't thought of it that
way before. But I see it now as clear as ringworm on
a burlesque queen."
"Sure, kid," he said, "work for your pleasures. Ef
fort is getting to be as dead as a classroom on Sun
day morning. Anyone can have holes in their socks.
It takes talent to have holes in your head. Do things
the hard way, kid."
"Yoah," I said, thinking of an old revolving door
I've always wanted to go through on skis, "the hard
way."
We turned and walked out of the room together on
our hands.
