# CAMPUS OPINION
## Rooting Suggestion 
### 
To the Editor:
The purpose of this letter is precisely this: If the
present tactics employed by the Stanford Yell Team are
continued the Big Game may well be the one at which
the Stanford rooting section will have received its fill of
the harsh, irritating, and thoroughly exasperating
haranguing of the Yell Leaders. If harmonious co
operation" between the rooting section and the yell
leaders is to be preserved there will have to be a
change in the present methods employed by Dave
Heyler & Co. in his effort to get the rooting section
to give forth with rousing rahs.
The suggestion offered to improve the existing
technique is this: (take it for what it's worth). If a
yell is desired as the team breaks the huddle why not
have a trumpeter blow three blasts as the center leaves
the huddle, then follow with three inspired rahs from
the rooting section? In this manner the constant hub
bub of stamping feet and raucous exhortations from
the yell leaders endeavoring to galvanize the rooting
section into action will be eliminated. The result
would be an asset to the yell leaders, the rooting sec
tion. and most important of all, the yell would be
completed before the quarter-back begins to call
signals, thereby benefiting the team by preventing the
drowning out of the voice of the quarterback as he
calls the signals.
Furthermore, this same technique could be used
with great success as each player is called to take
his position on the field at the beginning of the game.
Three loud trumpet blasts could follow the player's
name as it is called and the rooting section could counter
with the player's name, followed by three great rahs.
This is not my own idea; this technique was used
last week by the Wisconsin rooting section at the
Michigan game. Anyone who heard the game will
agree, I think, that the results were well worth the
effort.
