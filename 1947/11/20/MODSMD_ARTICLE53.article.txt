To (he Editor:
Wc want to thank the over 300 people who gave
.so much time and effort to the Stanford Relief Fund
Drive. Wo further want to thank the Administration
' 112 the University and many of the merchants of Pal >
Alto for their real cooperation and material assistance.

The results of the Drive are still incomplete. How
ever it is clear that this has been one of the finest
responses to an opportunity by the people of Stan
ford. It may yet prove to be a record.
The success or failure of the Drive is not some
thing that can be measured in tetfms of goals or
quotas. These are simply numbers picked out of the
air. This is a matter for individual decision. What
has your participation meant to you? Borrowing a
phrase from the film, "These are the seeds of your
own destiny."
A great many people have contributed very gen
erously. We know that some, making their own
analysis of Christmas, have contributed money that,
they would have spent for Christmas presents. To
these people, the Drive must surely be a success.
The Stanford Relief Fund presents a many-sided
story. There must be some phase of it that will strike
a response in almost everyone. If this response, in
certain instances, has not been forthcoming we must
apologize for failing to properly interpret the story
before the community.
We wish to emphasize that though the Drive is
over, the Stanford Relief Fund continues to exist as an
agency of the ASSU. Its services are available to
anyone who wishes to contribute to any or all of the
many organizations it represents here at Stanford. If
anyone wishes information or to contribute, write
to Box 2488, Stanford, or call at the SIRO office (grey
shack on the library side of Encina, Monday through
Friday 12:30 to 2:30).
