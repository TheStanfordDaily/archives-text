# Block 'S' Society

To the Editor:
Peter Allen's suggestion that the Block "S" Society
be responsible for the Stanford Axe is a very logical
choice. No other group on the campus is as close to
athletics or has the welfare of intercollegiate sports
so much at. heart. The symbol of a great intercollegiate
contest should be fittingly entrusted to such an organi
zation. I will present the new Stanford Block "S"
Society with the idea at our forthcoming charter meet
ing, Dec. 3 (to be formally announced later).
