# Pre-war Row Relics Recall Days At Del Monte Celebrating Big Game
## 
### JOE GRAHAM 
One of the-best stories in last
year's Big Game Chappie was
the one about Big Game Night
at Del Monte. Naturally, "all
: the ocelot skin upholstery,"
| etc., was a little overdone, but
1 the fact remains that those
were really the "good old
days."
Ask any of the few remaining
pre-war relics up tlie Row. the ones
who sit on their big leather chairs
and tap feebly on the window when
the girls go by, what they used to
do after the Big Game. With the
men who know the Big Night best,
it's always Del Monte.
DESTINATION MONTEREY
After the game you jumped in
the heap and headed off to Mon
terey with your woman of the
weekend. You Kot there fairly ear
ly in the evening, waded through
the check - in lines, haggled about
your reservations, and retired to
your rooms to change into tuxes
and formals for the night ahead.
INTO THE POOL
Sooner or later somebody always
fell (or got felled) into the swim
ming pool in their evening clothes,
to nobody's great dismay, and the
good people of Monterey were kept
from their beds most of the night
with the same old, but always fresh
| cheers and songs.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
Also, and this is really a big point.
I the Del Monte weekend system was
| DUTCH TREAT. The gal tradition
j ally paid her own way (grape juice
| and extras excepted, of course; that
' was actually paying your way, not
; hers). This is the point that really

makes the relics pine and sigh for
the "good old days." Somehow the
tradition has been misplaced in the
last few years.
What ever happened to the Big
Game nights at Del Monte? Well,
a combination of a lot of things. In
the first place, inflation makes the
$G.30 price tag look ridiculous. Sec
ondly, there are too damn many
people to go any one {.lace any
more. Third, there has been a lapse
in the tradition that had helped to
make the weekend what it was; and
possibly a fourth reason is that a
more serious-minded student body
isn't quite so thirsty any more for
that kind of thing. Also, Del Monte
has been taken over for a perma
nent rest and rehabilitation center
by the Navy.
I don't know, but it still seems to
me that the Navy has the right idea.

I the Del Monte weekend system was
| DUTCH TREAT. The gal tradition
j ally paid her own way (grape juice

' was actually paying your way, not

makes the relics pine and sigh for
the "good old days." Somehow the
tradition has been misplaced in the
last few years.
What ever happened to the Big
Game nights at Del Monte? Well,
a combination of a lot of things. In
the first place, inflation makes the
$G.30 price tag look ridiculous. Sec
ondly, there are too damn many
people to go any one {.lace any
more. Third, there has been a lapse
in the tradition that had helped to
make the weekend what it was; and
possibly a fourth reason is that a
more serious-minded student body
isn't quite so thirsty any more for
that kind of thing. Also, Del Monte
has been taken over for a perma
nent rest and rehabilitation center
by the Navy.
I don't know, but it still seems to
me that the Navy has the right idea.


IT'S A Bid WEEKEND for Gigi Marion and Brook Townscnd.—By Howard Garnick
One of the-best stories in last
year's Big Game Chappie was
the one about Big Game Night
at Del Monte. Naturally, "all
: the ocelot skin upholstery,"
| etc., was a little overdone, but
1 the fact remains that those
were really the "good old
days."
Ask any of the few remaining
pre-war relics up tlie Row. the ones
who sit on their big leather chairs
and tap feebly on the window when
the girls go by, what they used to
do after the Big Game. With the
men who know the Big Night best,
it's always Del Monte.
DESTINATION MONTEREY
After the game you jumped in
the heap and headed off to Mon
terey with your woman of the
weekend. You Kot there fairly ear
ly in the evening, waded through
the check - in lines, haggled about
your reservations, and retired to
your rooms to change into tuxes
and formals for the night ahead.
INTO THE POOL
Sooner or later somebody always
fell (or got felled) into the swim
ming pool in their evening clothes,
to nobody's great dismay, and the
good people of Monterey were kept
from their beds most of the night
with the same old, but always fresh
| cheers and songs.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
