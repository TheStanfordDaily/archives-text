Menu Memo
This is how my dinner goes
In the Restaurant
Always getting something else
For the tiling I want
Even so I would not mind,
It, when I was done.
I could ask them for a check
And know there wasn't one.
—S. H. Hurst J

Full of ice and snow.
Where flowers must,
A fur coat grow?

Answer: The Swiss Alps where
Edelweiss grows.
