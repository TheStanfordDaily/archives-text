# Excom Tables Student Union Fund Proposal
## 
### 
Excom voted last night to think
twice before taking the first step
in beginning a fund for a new stu
dent union.
Student Manager H. B. McCaul
lcy told Excom that Memorial Hall
is now fully paid for. Then a mo
tion sponsored by McCaulley and
ASSU President Tom Martzloff rec- j
ommending to the Board of Trus- I
tees that the dollar now paid by the |
students each quarter for the hall i
be put into a new student union I
fund was rejected.
Excom members thought that
more consideration should be given
to student opinion on the question
of a union before making a decision j
which would be binding later.

The recommendation presented
to Excom last night by Student
Manager 11. B. McCaulley will he
reviewed in a series of articles hy
Daily Editor George Caulfield
next week.

The Honor Code Standing Com
mittee, represented by Cal New
man, presented a recommendation
that students wishing to take exam
inations outside of assigned rooms
first obtain consent of the instruc
tor. The recommendation was de
feated, but at the same time it was
decided to investigate whether Ex
com or the Board of Student Con
trol (Men's and Women's Councils)
controls Honor Code policy.
