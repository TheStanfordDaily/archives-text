# Injuns A Pushover? Not If Fighting Spirit Counts
## Cardinals in Top Condition; Team Scoffs At 8 to 1 Odds 
### ART LUBIC 
Who's going to win the Eig Game tomorrow?
If you ride along with the consensus of experts you've got
to side with California in this 50th renewal of Northern Cali
fornia's greatest grudge battle. At that you wouldn't be all
alone, because Lynn Waldorf's once-bcaten eleven is an 8-1
betting favorite along Market Street and this startling guolalion
is expected to increase to 10-1 by game time.
Let's forget all this and hop aboard the Sianford bandwagon.
An improved fighting Card team could take home all the laurels
tomorrow. You don't have to go back very far for a precedent
either—witness Columbia's 21 to 20 win over Army and Pur
due's 14 to 7 triumph over Illinois this year, or Princeton's 17 to
14 upset of mighty Penn last year.
The Redshirts are at the peak of their physical condition for
the year. Team spirit will hit a new high by game time. A
green inexperienced line that rose to great heights against USC
two weeks ago should turn in an even greater performance
tomorrow.
How about the Stanford offense? Coach Marchie Schwartz
has been working patiently with the boys this week in an at
tempt to iron out the Cards' sputtering attack. A new sener;
of plays should help.
The Indian nassina aame is built around Quarterbacks Ainslie

Bell, Don Campbell, find A 1 Morris.
Ken Peek or one of the other right
halfbacks occasionally throws a long
one on a pitch-out play. All have*
been effective at times this season.
The Card running attack has
threatened to break out in a rash of
yardage all year. Bobby Anderson at
left half and Marty Anderson at full
back both have performed on the
brilliant side at moments and tomor
row could be the day for a coordin
ated effort.
Defensively Stanford can stop the
Golden Bears cold. A USC power
house that rolled up six touchdowns
and threatened to run Cal out of the
ball park in the second half could
only tally twice against the Red
shirts.
What does all this mean? Well,
we aren't predicting a Stanford vic
tory, but we do want everyone to
know that Stanford can do the job. j
The burden of proof rests on the j
capable shoulders of Captain George j
Quist and his teammates.

What does all this mean? Well,
we aren't predicting a Stanford vic
tory, but we do want everyone to
know that Stanford can do the job. j
The burden of proof rests on the j
capable shoulders of Captain George j
Quist and his teammates.

Who's going to win the Eig Game tomorrow?
If you ride along with the consensus of experts you've got
to side with California in this 50th renewal of Northern Cali
fornia's greatest grudge battle. At that you wouldn't be all
alone, because Lynn Waldorf's once-bcaten eleven is an 8-1
betting favorite along Market Street and this startling guolalion
is expected to increase to 10-1 by game time.
Let's forget all this and hop aboard the Sianford bandwagon.
An improved fighting Card team could take home all the laurels
tomorrow. You don't have to go back very far for a precedent
either—witness Columbia's 21 to 20 win over Army and Pur
due's 14 to 7 triumph over Illinois this year, or Princeton's 17 to
14 upset of mighty Penn last year.
The Redshirts are at the peak of their physical condition for
the year. Team spirit will hit a new high by game time. A
green inexperienced line that rose to great heights against USC
two weeks ago should turn in an even greater performance
tomorrow.
How about the Stanford offense? Coach Marchie Schwartz
has been working patiently with the boys this week in an at
tempt to iron out the Cards' sputtering attack. A new sener;
of plays should help.
The Indian nassina aame is built around Quarterbacks Ainslie

Bell, Don Campbell, find A 1 Morris.
Ken Peek or one of the other right
halfbacks occasionally throws a long
one on a pitch-out play. All have*
been effective at times this season.
The Card running attack has
threatened to break out in a rash of
yardage all year. Bobby Anderson at
left half and Marty Anderson at full
back both have performed on the
brilliant side at moments and tomor
row could be the day for a coordin
ated effort.
Defensively Stanford can stop the
Golden Bears cold. A USC power
house that rolled up six touchdowns
and threatened to run Cal out of the
ball park in the second half could
only tally twice against the Red
shirts.
