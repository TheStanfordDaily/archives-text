## 
### 
Sometime early yesterday morn- j
the Deke and the Delta Tau
Delta houses were burglarized, ac- j
eordini. l , to Chief of Police Gordon
Davis.
Some unknown person or persons !
w< iit through the deserted rooms
and rifled the wallets found in the
elothin'/. getting about $90 at the |
Dekes' and about $175 at the Delta
Tau Del! is', said Davis. These bur
claries in e identical with those at
the Kappa Alpha and the Thela Chi j
1 louse*' earlier this quarter, he re
marked.
The rolice department again!
urges the members of the different
living units to take steps to safe
guard money and valuables at night j
and to check up on movements or
noises during the late hours.
"Remember that any strangers i

found within the building will have
some plausible excuse about 'look
ing for a friend,' but detain him and
call the police department, PA
3131," said Davis. "Also keep in
mind that any such prowlers are
usually of college age, neatly
dressed, and have a personable ap
pearance."
He also warned residents of the
different living' units, especially fra
ternities, of the danger of leaving
their respective houses deserted to
morrow when they go to the Big
Game. In the light of these recent
burglaries, it would be wise to ar
range for the cook or someone else
to stay at home and listen to the
game on the radio, so as to be on
hand to greet possible "visitors," he
warned.
