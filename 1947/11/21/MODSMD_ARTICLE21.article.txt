A spirited class of '51 responded
enthusiastically to its obligations in
connection with the building and
guarding of the Big Game bonfire,
according to Bob Levison, chair
man of the freshman bonfire com
mittee.
"The freshman class deserves a
great deal of praise for their work

in building the bonfire, which un
doubtedly was one of the largest in
Stanford's history," Levison said.
