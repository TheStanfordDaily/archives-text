# 'That's Life' Humor Spotty
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
The Stanford Gaieties of 15)47,
currently anchored at Memorial
Auditorium, is, to put it frankly,
"no great shucks of a production."
A certain enthusiasm and buoy
ancy one comes to expect of Stan
ford undergruds is noticeably miss
ing. But a fresh, sprightly musical
score, presented by a trio of prom
ising singers—Nancy Toll, Bob Get
tys, and Roger Starr —piakes a val
iant effort to mend a so-so pattern
of lukewarm good cheer.
VOCAL ADS
Based on the page scheme of Life
magazine, "That's Life" kids its way
merrily from department to depart
ment, periodically ringing in a
quartet of vocal ad plugs, and final
ly relegating itself to a staid brand
of slapstick humor.
Better portions of the two-hour
production include a take-off on
Western Civ (can you see this red
line from back there?), Internation
al Affairs, Movie of the Week, and
"Life Goes to the Big Game."
A surprise treat is the brief ap
pearances of a few "Broadway stage
star luminaries," enacted in panto
mime by Bud Irving, George Spcl
vin, and Bobby Pettingill.
REPORT' MISSES
With a chance to exude definite
remembrances of comedy a la Mor
rie Ryskind, George S. Kaufman,
and Ira Gershwin, the "Life Re
ports to the Nation" sequence some
how misses connections, tumblers
Buck Thompson and Ted Knight
saving the act from sagging com
pletely with a clever demonstration
of subdued gymnastics.
Brightest skit of the evening re
volves about commercialism hitting
the classrooms, with variations of
big-time advertising (the Cellar and
Union Coffee Co.) mixed with
Western Civ taught in contempo
rary colloquialisms.
A handful of performers stand
out, among them Bob Blum, Hu
Heffner, Peggy Cox, John Zucker
man, Phil Pearce, Jane Allen, Rog
er Fipps, Fred Wheeler, Miriam
Worland, John Lawry, and Paul
Hostetler.
