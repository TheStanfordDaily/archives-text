# Freshmen Needed To Guard Campus
## 
### 
Although one of their biggest re
sponsibilities, that of building and
! guarding the Bin Game bonfire, has
I been successfully brought to an
j end, freshmen are still needed to
I protect the campus tonight against
a possible Cal invasion, according to
Tom August, president of the fresh
man class.
"Little damage has been done so
far, and freshmen should be espe
cially on the alert for vandals to
night," August said. "Freshmen
should report to the front steps of
Encina tonight at 7 for instructions."
The turnout for guard duty has
been increasingly larger with each
succeeding night, with the result
that property damage has been held
to a minimum.
In recent nights, as many as 100
! freshmen have been on duty. Pa
j trols composed of at least one auto
mobile and about eight men have
| been assigned to each entrance to
the campus. Freshmen have been
: guarding the Quad and individual
buildings on foot, and other roving
j automobile and bicycle patrols have
j been formed.
If an unidentified car does not
| stop at the signal given by a mem
; ber of the patrol, it is pursued until
| it either leaves the campus or is
| forced to stop.
