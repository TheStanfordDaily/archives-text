# History of Axe is Replete With Raids, Blood, Triumph, Dull Despair
## Origin of Axe 
### DICK BIESER 
That famous Axe of ours has a
long and stormy history. There are
various and conflicting stories as to
how it originated. Some tell how it
was specially forged while others
explain that it was bought for the
occasion of an important rally. But
the most seemingly authentic ver
sion of the story is that the Axe
was brought in from the outlying
foothills as scrap metal for the old
engineering forge.
Billy Erb, the Farm's off-football
season yell leader, and later New
York broker, organized the rally in
which the Axe first appeared.
BASEBALL OPENER LOST
It was in the spring of 1899.
George Beckctt, star and captain of
the Farm's baseball team, died just
prior to the season opening. Stan
ford faced a three-game champion
ship series with California against
heavy odds. The first game was
played on Thursday, April 13.
California won that first game.
With the series seemingly lost, the
spirit on the campus was at such a
definite low that Erb and his pal
Frank English organized a huge
rally in an attempt to bolster up the
lagging spirits of student rooters.
ERB DISCOVERS THE AXE'
Erb frantically searched for an
implement to give a material mean
ing to the Axe Yell. He came upon
the rusty, 10-pound, 15-inch blade.
He improvised a makeshift handle,
painted the blade red, and then
dashed to the rally grounds where
the first of the Big Game bonfires
was burning.
Someone realized that the dull
edge was not indicative of victory,
and hauled a grindstone to the fire
side. The Axe edge was sharpened
to razor-edge keenness as flames
from the bonfire leaped higher and
the shouting of the student body
grew louder and more frenzied.
Erb tested the weapon by defi
antly slicing off the head of a blue
and gold effigy with one bold
stroke.
AXK (JOES TO CAL
When the team went to San
Francisco on April 15, 1899,, the Axe
was very much in evidence in front i
of the Stanford rooting section. Erb
wielded it constantly, slicing up
yards of blue and gold ribbon on a
huge chopping block.
But Stanford lost the game in
spite of the new trophy. Forlorn
and disappointed, Erb relegated the
Axe to Carl Hayden, who in later
years became a U.S. Senator, but
who was only a lowly debater in j
those days.
AXE THEFT PLOTTED
The next few minutes raised the j
Axe from a threatened state of dis
honor to a spot of lofty reverence.
James Hopper, California '98, de
scribed the feeling of Cal students
toward this new weapon of the j
Farm rooting section:
'"Since 1896 the Stanford men had
been nettling us considerably with ;
their rude yell," he said. "And now
this damn -Axe."
Hopper and some of his cronies j
decided to seize the Axe. By this j
time most of the Stanford rooters 1
had left the field, but Tom McFad
den, a Stanford tackle, heard of the I
plan and rushed to Hayden's sides i
just as the Cal onslaught was clos- j
ing in.
PLOT IS SPRUNG
The boys from the Farm hung on
desperately as attackers pulled and ■
tugged from all sides. Finally the I
weapon was wrenched from them j
by the outnumbering force and was j
tossed to some Cal reinforcements |
who immediately raced from the j
grounds.
Among the fleeing group were j
Paul Castlethun, later a prominent :
San Francisco doctor, and Billy !
Drumm, Cal's ace track man. Hop
per, who was then California's
"wonder quarterback," ran inter
ference for the thieves against
Stanford pursuers. The heavy Axe,
easily tiring any person running
with it. was passed regularly back
and forth.
RECOVERY THWARTED
When Drumm tired, he slipped it
to a Cal man running beside him. It
turned out to be one Ernest Strout,
a Stanford man, who immediately
burst away from the horde in an
attempt to reach safe territory.
But Hopper, "with a 30-foot fly
ing tacklc," brought Strout to the
ground.
Again in possession of the Axe, 1

Hopper and his boys commandeered
a horse-drawn delivery wagon, and
then abandoned it in favor of a
speedier street car.
ONE-MAN PURSUIT
But even the street car was not
safe. Tailing the Berkeley crew was
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton, a Stanford
man then working on a San Fran
cisco newspaper. Hamilton saw his
chance when the boys stopped in a
Chinatown butcher shop to cut off
the troublesome axe handle. He de
scribed the struggle in an article
by Dink TcmpJeton:
"I forget whether the Axe was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time
I flunked. But I had had six months
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
AND HE (S ELIMINATED
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many
legs as I could. We came down in
a bunch and I hollered for the po
lice hoping that someone I knew
would come along. They punched
me around a bit and because I was
still obstreperous one of them
kicked me in the ribs for good
measure. I looked at him calmly
and said, 'I will kill you if I ever
see you again'; he bowed quite
gracefully, and they took the Axe
and went away, some of them re
maining a few moments longer on
my carcass discussing irrelevant
things. Then they also went and the
police came.
CAL ELUDES COPS
'T knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We began
arresting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Hopper relates in his article that
after stopping in the Chinatown
butcher shop, his group approached
the Ferry only to find it surrounded
by police and a hostile crowd of
Stanford reinforcements. Realizing
that only clever strategy could ever

get the Axe through the net, they
wrapped the blade itself in brown
wrapping paper and slipped it to
Clinton Miller, the one member of
the gang who was wearing an over
coat.
Miller gulped and headed for the
Ferry. Then he spied a nodding
acquaintance, an unescorted cced.
Joyfully he grabbed her arm and,
gazing down into her eyes with lov
ing care, he strolled unmolested
past the crowd into the building.
Hopper, the axe handle jammed
within a trouser leg, hobbled aboard
as a cl ippie. The coed responsible
for California's glory was never
identified.
The popular tale that the Axe was
carried on board the Ferry under
the coed's skirt is apparently just a
legend.


The Stanford Axe, long a symbol of rivalry between Stanford and the
University of California, will be presented to the winning school at the
close of the Big Game tomorrow afternoon.

and disappointed, Erb relegated the
Axe to Carl Hayden, who in later
years became a U.S. Senator, but
who was only a lowly debater in j
those days.
AXE THEFT PLOTTED
The next few minutes raised the j
Axe from a threatened state of dis
honor to a spot of lofty reverence.
James Hopper, California '98, de
scribed the feeling of Cal students
toward this new weapon of the j
Farm rooting section:
'"Since 1896 the Stanford men had
been nettling us considerably with ;
their rude yell," he said. "And now
this damn -Axe."
Hopper and some of his cronies j
decided to seize the Axe. By this j
time most of the Stanford rooters 1
had left the field, but Tom McFad
den, a Stanford tackle, heard of the I
plan and rushed to Hayden's sides i
just as the Cal onslaught was clos- j
ing in.
PLOT IS SPRUNG
The boys from the Farm hung on
desperately as attackers pulled and ■
tugged from all sides. Finally the I
weapon was wrenched from them j
by the outnumbering force and was j
tossed to some Cal reinforcements |
who immediately raced from the j
grounds.
Among the fleeing group were j
Paul Castlethun, later a prominent :
San Francisco doctor, and Billy !
Drumm, Cal's ace track man. Hop
per, who was then California's
"wonder quarterback," ran inter
ference for the thieves against
Stanford pursuers. The heavy Axe,
easily tiring any person running
with it. was passed regularly back
and forth.
RECOVERY THWARTED
When Drumm tired, he slipped it
to a Cal man running beside him. It
turned out to be one Ernest Strout,
a Stanford man, who immediately
burst away from the horde in an
attempt to reach safe territory.
But Hopper, "with a 30-foot fly
ing tacklc," brought Strout to the
ground.
Again in possession of the Axe, 1

Hopper and his boys commandeered
a horse-drawn delivery wagon, and
then abandoned it in favor of a
speedier street car.
ONE-MAN PURSUIT
But even the street car was not
safe. Tailing the Berkeley crew was
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton, a Stanford
man then working on a San Fran
cisco newspaper. Hamilton saw his
chance when the boys stopped in a
Chinatown butcher shop to cut off
the troublesome axe handle. He de
scribed the struggle in an article
by Dink TcmpJeton:
"I forget whether the Axe was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time
I flunked. But I had had six months
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
AND HE (S ELIMINATED
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many
legs as I could. We came down in
a bunch and I hollered for the po
lice hoping that someone I knew
would come along. They punched
me around a bit and because I was
still obstreperous one of them
kicked me in the ribs for good
measure. I looked at him calmly
and said, 'I will kill you if I ever
see you again'; he bowed quite
gracefully, and they took the Axe
and went away, some of them re
maining a few moments longer on
my carcass discussing irrelevant
things. Then they also went and the
police came.
CAL ELUDES COPS
'T knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We began
arresting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Hopper relates in his article that
after stopping in the Chinatown
butcher shop, his group approached
the Ferry only to find it surrounded
by police and a hostile crowd of
Stanford reinforcements. Realizing
that only clever strategy could ever

get the Axe through the net, they
wrapped the blade itself in brown
wrapping paper and slipped it to
Clinton Miller, the one member of
the gang who was wearing an over
coat.
Miller gulped and headed for the
Ferry. Then he spied a nodding
acquaintance, an unescorted cced.
Joyfully he grabbed her arm and,
gazing down into her eyes with lov
ing care, he strolled unmolested
past the crowd into the building.
Hopper, the axe handle jammed
within a trouser leg, hobbled aboard
as a cl ippie. The coed responsible
for California's glory was never
identified.
The popular tale that the Axe was
carried on board the Ferry under
the coed's skirt is apparently just a
legend.


The Stanford Axe, long a symbol of rivalry between Stanford and the
University of California, will be presented to the winning school at the
close of the Big Game tomorrow afternoon.
That famous Axe of ours has a
long and stormy history. There are
various and conflicting stories as to
how it originated. Some tell how it
was specially forged while others
explain that it was bought for the
occasion of an important rally. But
the most seemingly authentic ver
sion of the story is that the Axe
was brought in from the outlying
foothills as scrap metal for the old
engineering forge.
Billy Erb, the Farm's off-football
season yell leader, and later New
York broker, organized the rally in
which the Axe first appeared.
BASEBALL OPENER LOST
It was in the spring of 1899.
George Beckctt, star and captain of
the Farm's baseball team, died just
prior to the season opening. Stan
ford faced a three-game champion
ship series with California against
heavy odds. The first game was
played on Thursday, April 13.
California won that first game.
With the series seemingly lost, the
spirit on the campus was at such a
definite low that Erb and his pal
Frank English organized a huge
rally in an attempt to bolster up the
lagging spirits of student rooters.
ERB DISCOVERS THE AXE'
Erb frantically searched for an
implement to give a material mean
ing to the Axe Yell. He came upon
the rusty, 10-pound, 15-inch blade.
He improvised a makeshift handle,
painted the blade red, and then
dashed to the rally grounds where
the first of the Big Game bonfires
was burning.
Someone realized that the dull
edge was not indicative of victory,
and hauled a grindstone to the fire
side. The Axe edge was sharpened
to razor-edge keenness as flames
from the bonfire leaped higher and
the shouting of the student body
grew louder and more frenzied.
Erb tested the weapon by defi
antly slicing off the head of a blue
and gold effigy with one bold
stroke.
AXK (JOES TO CAL
When the team went to San
Francisco on April 15, 1899,, the Axe
was very much in evidence in front i
of the Stanford rooting section. Erb
wielded it constantly, slicing up
yards of blue and gold ribbon on a
huge chopping block.
But Stanford lost the game in
spite of the new trophy. Forlorn
and disappointed, Erb relegated the
Axe to Carl Hayden, who in later
years became a U.S. Senator, but

cisco newspaper. Hamilton saw his
chance when the boys stopped in a
Chinatown butcher shop to cut off
the troublesome axe handle. He de
scribed the struggle in an article
by Dink TcmpJeton:
"I forget whether the Axe was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time
I flunked. But I had had six months
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
AND HE (S ELIMINATED
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many
legs as I could. We came down in
a bunch and I hollered for the po
lice hoping that someone I knew
would come along. They punched
me around a bit and because I was
still obstreperous one of them
kicked me in the ribs for good
measure. I looked at him calmly
and said, 'I will kill you if I ever
see you again'; he bowed quite
gracefully, and they took the Axe
and went away, some of them re
maining a few moments longer on
my carcass discussing irrelevant
things. Then they also went and the
police came.
CAL ELUDES COPS
'T knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We began
arresting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Hopper relates in his article that
after stopping in the Chinatown
butcher shop, his group approached
the Ferry only to find it surrounded
by police and a hostile crowd of
Stanford reinforcements. Realizing
that only clever strategy could ever

get the Axe through the net, they
wrapped the blade itself in brown
wrapping paper and slipped it to
Clinton Miller, the one member of
the gang who was wearing an over
coat.
Miller gulped and headed for the
Ferry. Then he spied a nodding
acquaintance, an unescorted cced.
Joyfully he grabbed her arm and,
gazing down into her eyes with lov
ing care, he strolled unmolested
past the crowd into the building.
Hopper, the axe handle jammed
within a trouser leg, hobbled aboard
as a cl ippie. The coed responsible
for California's glory was never
identified.
The popular tale that the Axe was
carried on board the Ferry under
the coed's skirt is apparently just a
legend.


The Stanford Axe, long a symbol of rivalry between Stanford and the
University of California, will be presented to the winning school at the
close of the Big Game tomorrow afternoon.
That famous Axe of ours has a
long and stormy history. There are
various and conflicting stories as to
how it originated. Some tell how it
was specially forged while others
explain that it was bought for the
occasion of an important rally. But
the most seemingly authentic ver
sion of the story is that the Axe
was brought in from the outlying
foothills as scrap metal for the old
engineering forge.
Billy Erb, the Farm's off-football
season yell leader, and later New
York broker, organized the rally in
which the Axe first appeared.
BASEBALL OPENER LOST
It was in the spring of 1899.
George Beckctt, star and captain of
the Farm's baseball team, died just
prior to the season opening. Stan
ford faced a three-game champion
ship series with California against
heavy odds. The first game was
played on Thursday, April 13.
California won that first game.
With the series seemingly lost, the
spirit on the campus was at such a
definite low that Erb and his pal
Frank English organized a huge
rally in an attempt to bolster up the
lagging spirits of student rooters.
ERB DISCOVERS THE AXE'
Erb frantically searched for an
implement to give a material mean
ing to the Axe Yell. He came upon
the rusty, 10-pound, 15-inch blade.
He improvised a makeshift handle,
painted the blade red, and then
dashed to the rally grounds where
the first of the Big Game bonfires
was burning.
Someone realized that the dull
edge was not indicative of victory,
and hauled a grindstone to the fire
side. The Axe edge was sharpened
to razor-edge keenness as flames
from the bonfire leaped higher and
the shouting of the student body
grew louder and more frenzied.
Erb tested the weapon by defi
antly slicing off the head of a blue
and gold effigy with one bold
stroke.
AXK (JOES TO CAL
When the team went to San
Francisco on April 15, 1899,, the Axe
was very much in evidence in front i
of the Stanford rooting section. Erb
wielded it constantly, slicing up
yards of blue and gold ribbon on a
huge chopping block.
But Stanford lost the game in
spite of the new trophy. Forlorn
and disappointed, Erb relegated the
Axe to Carl Hayden, who in later
years became a U.S. Senator, but
who was only a lowly debater in j
those days.
AXE THEFT PLOTTED
The next few minutes raised the j
Axe from a threatened state of dis
honor to a spot of lofty reverence.
James Hopper, California '98, de
scribed the feeling of Cal students
toward this new weapon of the j
Farm rooting section:
'"Since 1896 the Stanford men had
been nettling us considerably with ;
their rude yell," he said. "And now
this damn -Axe."
Hopper and some of his cronies j
decided to seize the Axe. By this j
time most of the Stanford rooters 1
had left the field, but Tom McFad
den, a Stanford tackle, heard of the I
plan and rushed to Hayden's sides i
just as the Cal onslaught was clos- j
ing in.
PLOT IS SPRUNG
The boys from the Farm hung on
desperately as attackers pulled and ■
tugged from all sides. Finally the I
weapon was wrenched from them j
by the outnumbering force and was j
tossed to some Cal reinforcements |
who immediately raced from the j
grounds.
Among the fleeing group were j
Paul Castlethun, later a prominent :
San Francisco doctor, and Billy !
Drumm, Cal's ace track man. Hop
per, who was then California's
"wonder quarterback," ran inter
ference for the thieves against
Stanford pursuers. The heavy Axe,
easily tiring any person running
with it. was passed regularly back
and forth.
RECOVERY THWARTED
When Drumm tired, he slipped it
to a Cal man running beside him. It
turned out to be one Ernest Strout,
a Stanford man, who immediately
burst away from the horde in an
attempt to reach safe territory.
But Hopper, "with a 30-foot fly
ing tacklc," brought Strout to the
ground.
Again in possession of the Axe, 1

Hopper and his boys commandeered
a horse-drawn delivery wagon, and
then abandoned it in favor of a
speedier street car.
ONE-MAN PURSUIT
But even the street car was not
safe. Tailing the Berkeley crew was

man then working on a San Fran
cisco newspaper. Hamilton saw his

past the crowd into the building.
Hopper, the axe handle jammed
within a trouser leg, hobbled aboard
as a cl ippie. The coed responsible
for California's glory was never
identified.
The popular tale that the Axe was
carried on board the Ferry under
the coed's skirt is apparently just a
legend.


The Stanford Axe, long a symbol of rivalry between Stanford and the
University of California, will be presented to the winning school at the
close of the Big Game tomorrow afternoon.
That famous Axe of ours has a
long and stormy history. There are
various and conflicting stories as to
how it originated. Some tell how it
was specially forged while others
explain that it was bought for the
occasion of an important rally. But
the most seemingly authentic ver
sion of the story is that the Axe
was brought in from the outlying
foothills as scrap metal for the old
engineering forge.
Billy Erb, the Farm's off-football
season yell leader, and later New
York broker, organized the rally in
which the Axe first appeared.
BASEBALL OPENER LOST
It was in the spring of 1899.
George Beckctt, star and captain of
the Farm's baseball team, died just
prior to the season opening. Stan
ford faced a three-game champion
ship series with California against
heavy odds. The first game was
played on Thursday, April 13.
California won that first game.
With the series seemingly lost, the
spirit on the campus was at such a
definite low that Erb and his pal
Frank English organized a huge
rally in an attempt to bolster up the
lagging spirits of student rooters.
ERB DISCOVERS THE AXE'
Erb frantically searched for an
implement to give a material mean
ing to the Axe Yell. He came upon
the rusty, 10-pound, 15-inch blade.
He improvised a makeshift handle,
painted the blade red, and then
dashed to the rally grounds where
the first of the Big Game bonfires
was burning.
Someone realized that the dull
edge was not indicative of victory,
and hauled a grindstone to the fire
side. The Axe edge was sharpened
to razor-edge keenness as flames
from the bonfire leaped higher and
the shouting of the student body
grew louder and more frenzied.
Erb tested the weapon by defi
antly slicing off the head of a blue
and gold effigy with one bold
stroke.
AXK (JOES TO CAL
When the team went to San
Francisco on April 15, 1899,, the Axe
was very much in evidence in front i
of the Stanford rooting section. Erb
wielded it constantly, slicing up
yards of blue and gold ribbon on a
huge chopping block.
But Stanford lost the game in
spite of the new trophy. Forlorn
and disappointed, Erb relegated the
Axe to Carl Hayden, who in later
years became a U.S. Senator, but
who was only a lowly debater in j
those days.
AXE THEFT PLOTTED
The next few minutes raised the j
Axe from a threatened state of dis
honor to a spot of lofty reverence.
James Hopper, California '98, de
scribed the feeling of Cal students
toward this new weapon of the j
Farm rooting section:
'"Since 1896 the Stanford men had
been nettling us considerably with ;
their rude yell," he said. "And now
this damn -Axe."
Hopper and some of his cronies j
decided to seize the Axe. By this j
time most of the Stanford rooters 1
had left the field, but Tom McFad
den, a Stanford tackle, heard of the I
plan and rushed to Hayden's sides i
just as the Cal onslaught was clos- j
ing in.
PLOT IS SPRUNG
The boys from the Farm hung on
desperately as attackers pulled and ■
tugged from all sides. Finally the I
weapon was wrenched from them j
by the outnumbering force and was j
tossed to some Cal reinforcements |
who immediately raced from the j
grounds.
Among the fleeing group were j
Paul Castlethun, later a prominent :
San Francisco doctor, and Billy !
Drumm, Cal's ace track man. Hop
per, who was then California's
"wonder quarterback," ran inter
ference for the thieves against
Stanford pursuers. The heavy Axe,
easily tiring any person running
with it. was passed regularly back
and forth.
RECOVERY THWARTED
When Drumm tired, he slipped it
to a Cal man running beside him. It
turned out to be one Ernest Strout,
a Stanford man, who immediately
burst away from the horde in an
attempt to reach safe territory.
But Hopper, "with a 30-foot fly
ing tacklc," brought Strout to the
ground.
Again in possession of the Axe, 1

Hopper and his boys commandeered
a horse-drawn delivery wagon, and
then abandoned it in favor of a
speedier street car.
ONE-MAN PURSUIT
But even the street car was not
safe. Tailing the Berkeley crew was
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton, a Stanford
man then working on a San Fran
cisco newspaper. Hamilton saw his
chance when the boys stopped in a
Chinatown butcher shop to cut off
the troublesome axe handle. He de
scribed the struggle in an article
by Dink TcmpJeton:
"I forget whether the Axe was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time
I flunked. But I had had six months
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
AND HE (S ELIMINATED
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many
legs as I could. We came down in
a bunch and I hollered for the po
lice hoping that someone I knew
would come along. They punched
me around a bit and because I was
still obstreperous one of them
kicked me in the ribs for good
measure. I looked at him calmly
and said, 'I will kill you if I ever
see you again'; he bowed quite
gracefully, and they took the Axe
and went away, some of them re
maining a few moments longer on
my carcass discussing irrelevant
things. Then they also went and the
police came.
CAL ELUDES COPS
'T knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We began
arresting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Hopper relates in his article that
after stopping in the Chinatown
butcher shop, his group approached
the Ferry only to find it surrounded
by police and a hostile crowd of
Stanford reinforcements. Realizing
that only clever strategy could ever

get the Axe through the net, they
wrapped the blade itself in brown
wrapping paper and slipped it to
Clinton Miller, the one member of
the gang who was wearing an over
coat.
Miller gulped and headed for the
Ferry. Then he spied a nodding
acquaintance, an unescorted cced.
Joyfully he grabbed her arm and,
gazing down into her eyes with lov
ing care, he strolled unmolested
past the crowd into the building.

within a trouser leg, hobbled aboard
