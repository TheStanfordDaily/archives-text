# Bloody Years
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
There was literally a "hot time in
the town of Berkeley" that night in
1899 when the Axe was captured
and carried across the Bay. The fete
touched off the first of 31 Axe ral
lies.
But Stanford did not rest easily.
Yell Leader Billy Erb had heard a
rumor that Charlie Pringle, Cal's
football captain, had secured the
weapon at his Chi Psi house, and
gathering a group of Stanford co
horts, Erb raided the house.
'BANZAI'
Pringle, however, seeing the band
approach, grabbed an army sword
from the wall and dashed to the
head of the stairs shouting, "I'll
kill the first man who starts up
these stairs."
A hurled flower vase, however,
broke his composure, and instantly
the Stanford horde was upon him.
Erb, swinging the captured sword,
directed the ransacking of the
house. Using crowbars and ham
mers, they searched every conceiv
able hiding place except a strong
box containing fraternity secrets,
which nine Chi Psi's, on bended
knees, swore did not contain the
Axe.
TROPHY HIDDEN
The Axe was still secreted when
the disappointed Stanfordites left,
for Pringle, anticipating such a
plan, had placed it behind the pan
eling of a sliding door.
Raids between the two universi
i ties increased until the administra
i tions of both schools agreed that the
Axe was Cal's by right of conquest
| and outlawed further raids. Cal
[ stored the Axe in the Berkeley
j American Trust Bank and removed
! it only once each spring for the
rally preceding the Stanford-Cali
i fornia baseball game.
The Axe Yell was "taken over"
by the California rooting section.
! and on all occasions was thrown in
j the faces of its helpless owners.
WAIT 31 YEARS FOR THE '21'
Though hope of recovery persist
ed through the years, Stanford had
; to wait 31 years for the "Immortal
I 21" to recover their beloved trophy.
The successful raid resulted from
| a plan conceived in 1927 when 21
| boys from Sequoia Hall, under the
j leadership of Don Kropp, organized
; for the definite purpose of recover
ing the Axe.
PLANS COMPLETE IN 1930
After several unsuccessful at
■ tempts, the group had, by 1930,
j elaborate plans which they felt
I could n<st fail. Armed with fake
cameras and tear-gas bombs, the 21
motored quietly into Berkeley on
. the day of Cal's annual rally.
The occupants of one car were as
signed to the bank, the second
group joined the Cal freshman bank
guards, the third car parked two
blocks from the bank, while the
last band drove directly to the
Greek Theater, site of the rally.
'21' REFUTE CAL CLAIM
Some of the latter group edged
themselves close to the Axe, while
others stationed themselves around
the armored "Axe car."

At the rally a Cal spokesman
stated, "The Axe is just as safe this
year as last." When the ceremonies
were finished, the conspirators
joined the frosh guards on the run
ning board of the armored car.
POSE AS CAMERAMEN
Pretending to be newspapermen,
the group at the bank requested a
good "shot" of the Axe. Obligingly i
the guards parted, leaving Axe
Custodian Norm Horner with the
prize in his hand.
Instantly a tear-gas bomb con- j
cealed in a flashbulb exploded in !
Horner's face, while a Stanford
"guard" jumped from the armored
car onto his back, wrenching the
Axe from him. It was quietly slip- j
ped from one Stanfordite to another
until clear of the freshman circle.
GET-AWAY ACHIEVED
Free of interference, one of the
conspirators calmly tucked the Axe
under his sweater and strolled to
the waiting get-away car.
With the Stanford car away, one
Indian group ransacked the ar
mored car to make sure they hadn't
seized a fake, while the remainder of
the 21 set up road blocks in the j
streets. Acting as ringleaders, some [
of the Stanford men delayed pursuit
by giving misleading directions and |
calling for everyone to congregate j
at the Campanile for organization. 1
Scores of Cal automobiles at- j
tempted to intercept the Axe, but i
the get-away car arrived in Palo |
Alto unimpeded. Three other [
groups, however, were forced to de- j
tour and even crash several Cal j
road blocks before they reached !
Stanford.

at the Campanile for organization. 1
Scores of Cal automobiles at- j
tempted to intercept the Axe, but i
the get-away car arrived in Palo |
Alto unimpeded. Three other [
groups, however, were forced to de- j
tour and even crash several Cal j
road blocks before they reached !
Stanford.
There was literally a "hot time in
the town of Berkeley" that night in
1899 when the Axe was captured
and carried across the Bay. The fete
touched off the first of 31 Axe ral
lies.
But Stanford did not rest easily.
Yell Leader Billy Erb had heard a
rumor that Charlie Pringle, Cal's
football captain, had secured the
weapon at his Chi Psi house, and
gathering a group of Stanford co
horts, Erb raided the house.
'BANZAI'
Pringle, however, seeing the band
approach, grabbed an army sword
from the wall and dashed to the
head of the stairs shouting, "I'll
kill the first man who starts up
these stairs."
A hurled flower vase, however,
broke his composure, and instantly
the Stanford horde was upon him.
Erb, swinging the captured sword,
directed the ransacking of the
house. Using crowbars and ham
mers, they searched every conceiv
able hiding place except a strong
box containing fraternity secrets,
which nine Chi Psi's, on bended
knees, swore did not contain the
Axe.
TROPHY HIDDEN
The Axe was still secreted when
the disappointed Stanfordites left,
for Pringle, anticipating such a
plan, had placed it behind the pan
eling of a sliding door.
Raids between the two universi
i ties increased until the administra
i tions of both schools agreed that the
Axe was Cal's by right of conquest
| and outlawed further raids. Cal
[ stored the Axe in the Berkeley
j American Trust Bank and removed
! it only once each spring for the
rally preceding the Stanford-Cali
i fornia baseball game.
The Axe Yell was "taken over"
by the California rooting section.
! and on all occasions was thrown in
j the faces of its helpless owners.
WAIT 31 YEARS FOR THE '21'
Though hope of recovery persist
ed through the years, Stanford had
; to wait 31 years for the "Immortal
I 21" to recover their beloved trophy.
The successful raid resulted from
| a plan conceived in 1927 when 21
| boys from Sequoia Hall, under the
j leadership of Don Kropp, organized
; for the definite purpose of recover
ing the Axe.
PLANS COMPLETE IN 1930
After several unsuccessful at
■ tempts, the group had, by 1930,
j elaborate plans which they felt
I could n<st fail. Armed with fake
cameras and tear-gas bombs, the 21
motored quietly into Berkeley on
. the day of Cal's annual rally.
The occupants of one car were as
signed to the bank, the second
group joined the Cal freshman bank
guards, the third car parked two
blocks from the bank, while the
last band drove directly to the
Greek Theater, site of the rally.
'21' REFUTE CAL CLAIM
Some of the latter group edged
themselves close to the Axe, while
others stationed themselves around
the armored "Axe car."

At the rally a Cal spokesman
stated, "The Axe is just as safe this
year as last." When the ceremonies
were finished, the conspirators
joined the frosh guards on the run
ning board of the armored car.
POSE AS CAMERAMEN
Pretending to be newspapermen,
the group at the bank requested a
good "shot" of the Axe. Obligingly i
the guards parted, leaving Axe
Custodian Norm Horner with the
prize in his hand.
Instantly a tear-gas bomb con- j
cealed in a flashbulb exploded in !
Horner's face, while a Stanford
"guard" jumped from the armored
car onto his back, wrenching the
Axe from him. It was quietly slip- j
ped from one Stanfordite to another
until clear of the freshman circle.
GET-AWAY ACHIEVED
Free of interference, one of the
conspirators calmly tucked the Axe
under his sweater and strolled to
the waiting get-away car.
With the Stanford car away, one
Indian group ransacked the ar
mored car to make sure they hadn't
seized a fake, while the remainder of
the 21 set up road blocks in the j
streets. Acting as ringleaders, some [
of the Stanford men delayed pursuit
by giving misleading directions and |

Indian group ransacked the ar
mored car to make sure they hadn't
seized a fake, while the remainder of
the 21 set up road blocks in the j
streets. Acting as ringleaders, some [
of the Stanford men delayed pursuit
by giving misleading directions and |
calling for everyone to congregate j
at the Campanile for organization. 1
Scores of Cal automobiles at- j
tempted to intercept the Axe, but i
the get-away car arrived in Palo |
Alto unimpeded. Three other [
groups, however, were forced to de- j
tour and even crash several Cal j
road blocks before they reached !
Stanford.
There was literally a "hot time in
the town of Berkeley" that night in
1899 when the Axe was captured
and carried across the Bay. The fete
touched off the first of 31 Axe ral
lies.
But Stanford did not rest easily.
Yell Leader Billy Erb had heard a
rumor that Charlie Pringle, Cal's
football captain, had secured the
weapon at his Chi Psi house, and
gathering a group of Stanford co
horts, Erb raided the house.
'BANZAI'
Pringle, however, seeing the band
approach, grabbed an army sword
from the wall and dashed to the
head of the stairs shouting, "I'll
kill the first man who starts up
these stairs."
A hurled flower vase, however,
broke his composure, and instantly
the Stanford horde was upon him.
Erb, swinging the captured sword,
directed the ransacking of the
house. Using crowbars and ham
mers, they searched every conceiv
able hiding place except a strong
box containing fraternity secrets,
which nine Chi Psi's, on bended
knees, swore did not contain the
Axe.
TROPHY HIDDEN
The Axe was still secreted when
the disappointed Stanfordites left,
for Pringle, anticipating such a
plan, had placed it behind the pan
eling of a sliding door.
Raids between the two universi
i ties increased until the administra
i tions of both schools agreed that the
Axe was Cal's by right of conquest
| and outlawed further raids. Cal
[ stored the Axe in the Berkeley
j American Trust Bank and removed
! it only once each spring for the
rally preceding the Stanford-Cali
i fornia baseball game.
The Axe Yell was "taken over"
by the California rooting section.
! and on all occasions was thrown in
j the faces of its helpless owners.
WAIT 31 YEARS FOR THE '21'
Though hope of recovery persist
ed through the years, Stanford had
; to wait 31 years for the "Immortal
I 21" to recover their beloved trophy.
The successful raid resulted from
| a plan conceived in 1927 when 21
| boys from Sequoia Hall, under the
j leadership of Don Kropp, organized
; for the definite purpose of recover
ing the Axe.
PLANS COMPLETE IN 1930
After several unsuccessful at
■ tempts, the group had, by 1930,
j elaborate plans which they felt
I could n<st fail. Armed with fake
cameras and tear-gas bombs, the 21
motored quietly into Berkeley on
. the day of Cal's annual rally.
The occupants of one car were as
signed to the bank, the second
group joined the Cal freshman bank
guards, the third car parked two
blocks from the bank, while the
last band drove directly to the
Greek Theater, site of the rally.
'21' REFUTE CAL CLAIM
Some of the latter group edged
themselves close to the Axe, while
others stationed themselves around
the armored "Axe car."

At the rally a Cal spokesman
stated, "The Axe is just as safe this
year as last." When the ceremonies
were finished, the conspirators
joined the frosh guards on the run
ning board of the armored car.
POSE AS CAMERAMEN
Pretending to be newspapermen,
the group at the bank requested a
good "shot" of the Axe. Obligingly i
the guards parted, leaving Axe
Custodian Norm Horner with the
prize in his hand.
Instantly a tear-gas bomb con- j
cealed in a flashbulb exploded in !
Horner's face, while a Stanford
"guard" jumped from the armored
car onto his back, wrenching the
Axe from him. It was quietly slip- j
ped from one Stanfordite to another
until clear of the freshman circle.
GET-AWAY ACHIEVED
Free of interference, one of the
conspirators calmly tucked the Axe
under his sweater and strolled to
the waiting get-away car.
