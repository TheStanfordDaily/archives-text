# 'Immortal 21'
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
"The Axe is back."
With these four words, the Stan
ford campus was smothered in a
cloud of exitement. Auto horns
bleated, people yelled and sang, and
the "21 Men" from old Sequoia Hall
were fast becoming the heroes ol
the day.
It was the evening of April 3,
1930, a few hours after the precious
Axe had been recaptured by an
ingenious combination of Cardinal
students. In fact, the Axe was pil
fered under the very noses of a Cal
ifornia Axe guard.
REVELRY ON FARM
All through the night the Stan
ford campus reveled in a spirit of
impromptu rallies, parades, and
tales of how the Axe was retrieved.
The pajama - clad staff of the
Stanford Daily published an extra
at 3 the next morning.
For his dating deeds, each mem
ber of "the 21" was awarded a Block
"S" and a gold key chain. Gifts,
letters, and telegrams of congratu
lation were numerous, and alumni
interest mounted in waves of en
couragement.
But despite alleged reports that

"millions" would come from Berke
ley to get back the Axe, the Stan
ford rooters, blinded by the seem
ing miracle, continued celebrating
wildly.
Late on the evening of its return,
the Axe was stored in a room at
Roble as a preventive measure
against any possible University of
California retaliatory foray. The
next morning, it was lodged in a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Ameri
can Trust Bank.
"We've got the Axe and we're
going to hang on to it," was the
chant by Stanford people on and
about the Quad. California students,
in the meantime, developed a "hate
Stanford" complex which was evi
dent in editorials printed in the
Daily Californian.
What should be done with the
Axe? This was the problem of the
<My.
PROBLEM SOLVED
"Put it up as a trophy for the Big
Game, the winning team taking
possession of the Axe each year."
This was the general feeling ex
pressed by many Bear-Indian root
ers, for it was feared some "dam
aging blow to University property"
would result from an effort to seize
the Axe.
The 21 men from Sequoia, dubbed
the "Immortal 21," were toasted and

feted, and any publicity given them
was apportioned collectively to all
the members.
In 19153 an agreement was reached
whereby the Axe would be given
to the winner of the Big Game each
year.
The California Bears, by virtue
of a 20 to 0 win in that year, jubi
lantly took the Axe to Berkeley
where it remained until the inuians,
led by the "Wow Boys" of 1940,
edged the Blue and Gold, 13 to 7.
SURPRISING WIN
The Axe took turns on junkets to
Stanford and California, but in 11)42,
on the strength of a surprising 26 to
7 triumph, the fabulous Axe once
more came home to Stanford.
During the last five years, the
Axe has remained on Cardinal sod
—through the war years and by vir
tue of throttling the Bears, 2f) to (5,
last year in Memorial Stadium.
Tomorrow Stanford and Califor
nia prepare for their fiftieth Big
Game, with the Axe at stake.
The Axe, born in the mind of a
rabid Stanford rooter, is a symbol
of the tradition, good sportsman
ship, and native American spirit
which have been inherent ingredi
ents of both universities.
As such, its influence should last
as long as does the friendly rivalry
it symbolizes.
