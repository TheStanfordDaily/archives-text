## Indians vs. Bears 
### 
i
R E.-DAN MERVIN vs.
L.E.—VAN DEREN
The Farm's DAS MERVIN looks
across the lino at speedy FRANK
VAN DEREN here. Although Mer
vin, 185-lb. transfer from S;inta Rosa
JC, has the drive, he hasn't been I
the pass-catching ball hawk that Van ,
Deren has turned out to be. Then
100, the Bears can shove in ex-regu- J
lar KENNY GIIOEFSEMA when
Van Deren takes five. Mervin and j
his understudy, JACK CRAHAN,
will have their hands full. EVEN
K.K.—IH TC II PHLEGER vs.
L.T.—RON SOCKOLOV
ATIIERTON PHLEGER, if he's at
the peak he was in the SC game, is j
the boy who just might shove Cal's j
RON SOCKOLOV and big JIM
TURNER around tomorrow. After i
all, only one of Cal's two gents can J

play ;it a time. It's a tough assign
ment for Stanford's veteran 215—1b.
lineman, but wilh UCLA-game cap
tain HARRY FERRIS to spell him,
he may do it. EDGE: STANFORD
R.G.—DON I IX vs.
L.G.—JIM CULLOM
JIM CULLOM—at 220 lbs., the
heaviest regular Bear lineman—does
Cal's extra point kicking, and be
tween placements he plays lots of left
guard. Stanford's DON FIX hasn't
the experience or the weight (201
lbs.), but he's improved with every
game and doesn't like to be walked
over. Watch him. EDGE: CAL
CENTER
DICK I LATLAND vs.
DOUG DUNCAN
Indian DICK FLATLAND's play is j
spotty at times, and some of his cen- j
tors to Alike Durket are oil-target. I
But when lie's fired up (and he will |
be, tomorrow), he doesn't yield to i
anybody, not even Cal's DOUG ;
DUNCAN. Flatland is a mite heavier I
than Duncan (202 to 105), but that's
about all the advantage he has; both
men are veterans at their position.
Cal has better reserves in Rob Ilile
n:an and Harry Piper. EDGE: CAL. i
L.G.—JACK McKITTRICK vs.
R.G.—ROD FRANZ
JACK McKITTRICK carries the
Cardinal colors here. The 19-year- j
old starter's big "5" keeps getting I

under more and more pileups as the ,
season progresses, but against him 1
he has ROD FRANZ, a brilliant fix
ture of the Gold and Blue. It's an- j
other case of experience and weight i
favoring the Berkeley entry.
EDGE: CAL
L.T.—WHIT BUDGE vs.
r T — GENE FRASSETTO
Pappy has given out lhat 217-1 b.
GENE FRASSETTO will start foi* the
Bears, but if sidelined HANK BOR-
Glll can make it, he II be in there.
Both are terrors —and experienced.
Marchie has WIIIT BUDGE. But
who does he have to relieve him?
And if Frassetto and Borghi can't
do it, DON SLAVER can. Budge,
improved as he is, just has too much
depth to contend with. EDGE: CAL
L.E.—HARRY AGLER vs.
R.E. —GENE MARTIN
HARRY AGLER hasn't been one j
of the scoring stars of the Bears' 1947
touchdown parade, but the reliable
end has started every important
game and has handled his chores
with plenty of savvy. For the In
dians, GENE MARTIN is no slouch—
and glue-fingered 808 GHILOTTI
doesn't weaken Stanford's left end
when he plays, either. EDGE: CAL
QUARTERBACK
AINSLIE BELL vs.
DICK ERICKSON
AINSLIE BELL. He's the signal
caller and the southpaw passer who
makes the Red Machine click, when
it does. Last year, he was money in
the bank against Cal. and he's been
every bit as good this season. The
Bears will field 808 CELERi and
DICK ERICKSON. Celeri's aerials
(which were all that beat Washing
ton) have become a feature of the
Cal attack. Bell is also a deadly
passer; he just hasn't been given the
protection Celeri has gotten this
year. EVEN
LEFT HALFBACK
TED KEN FIELD—BOB ANDERSON
It looks like dangerous PAUL
KECKLEY will play most of, or all
of, his Big Game for Cal on the
sidelines, which is all right by the
Cardinals. TED KENFIELD. a nifty
pass receiver, isn't far behind Keck
ley in ability, which means the In
dians will have to watch the lf>s-Ib.
lad. BOBBY ANDERSON, while he
hasn t been the breftk-away runner.
he was last year for Stanford, is still
one of the wheels of the Red Ma
chine. This might be his game to go. i
EDGE: STANFORD
RIGHT HALFBACK
JACK SWANER—GEORGE QUIST
JACK SWANER, if you remember. 1
was the Bear who ran SC's opening j
kickofT back 65 yards for a score last
month. Yet he's been sharing the
post with 180-lb. GEORGE FONG
all along. Neither one can compare j
with the Farm's rugged GEORGE j
QUIST when it comes to backing up
the line. The 210-lb. clutch player !
was great in the Big Game la t

! year —he set up the first Farm TD
i which set the Bears back on their
I haunches. Still, the Berkeley buga
j boos have the best of it here, of
t lensively if not defensively. How
ever. if MICKEY TITUS, along with
WAYNE ERICKSON can help Quist
out, it might be a different story.
EDGE: CAL
FULLBACK
JACK JENSEN vs.
MARTIN ANDERSON
Cal's JOHNNY GRAVES is out,
leaving . . . JACK JENSEN, a driv
ing, bruising 190—lb. fullback if there
ever was one. Jackie "doesn't care
how high the score goes against
Stanford" — and the Indians don't
care how they make him eat his
words. The guy, nevertheless, is
good. DON ZAPPETTINI and MAR
. TIN ANDERSON, both lettermen,
j have been alternating at full for the
! Red Machine. The 178-1 b. Zappet
tini is (he Farm's closest approach to
a swivel-hip runner. EDGE: CAL
CONCLUSION: California has the
advantage in seven positions, Stan
ford has the advantage in two. Two
positions are about evenly matched.
The Indians, however, are not con
ceding anything. Why should they?

touchdown parade, but the reliable
end has started every important

AINSLIE BELL vs.

AINSLIE BELL. He's the signal

makes the Red Machine click, when
it does. Last year, he was money in
the bank against Cal. and he's been
every bit as good this season. The
Bears will field 808 CELERi and
DICK ERICKSON. Celeri's aerials
(which were all that beat Washing
ton) have become a feature of the
Cal attack. Bell is also a deadly
passer; he just hasn't been given the
protection Celeri has gotten this
year. EVEN

QUIST when it comes to backing up
the line. The 210-lb. clutch player !

FULLBACK
JACK JENSEN vs.

Cal's JOHNNY GRAVES is out,
leaving . . . JACK JENSEN, a driv

ever was one. Jackie "doesn't care
how high the score goes against
Stanford" — and the Indians don't
care how they make him eat his
words. The guy, nevertheless, is
good. DON ZAPPETTINI and MAR
. TIN ANDERSON, both lettermen,

CONCLUSION: California has the
advantage in seven positions, Stan
ford has the advantage in two. Two
positions are about evenly matched.
The Indians, however, are not con
ceding anything. Why should they?

JIM CULLOM—at 220 lbs., the

DICK I LATLAND vs.

Indian DICK FLATLAND's play is j

But when lie's fired up (and he will |
be, tomorrow), he doesn't yield to i
anybody, not even Cal's DOUG ;
DUNCAN. Flatland is a mite heavier I
than Duncan (202 to 105), but that's

Cal's JOHNNY GRAVES is out,

ever was one. Jackie "doesn't care
how high the score goes against
Stanford" — and the Indians don't

end has started every important
game and has handled his chores

QUARTERBACK
AINSLIE BELL vs.
DICK ERICKSON
AINSLIE BELL. He's the signal
caller and the southpaw passer who
makes the Red Machine click, when
it does. Last year, he was money in
the bank against Cal. and he's been
every bit as good this season. The
Bears will field 808 CELERi and
DICK ERICKSON. Celeri's aerials
(which were all that beat Washing
ton) have become a feature of the
Cal attack. Bell is also a deadly
passer; he just hasn't been given the
protection Celeri has gotten this
year. EVEN
LEFT HALFBACK
TED KEN FIELD—BOB ANDERSON
It looks like dangerous PAUL
KECKLEY will play most of, or all
of, his Big Game for Cal on the
sidelines, which is all right by the
Cardinals. TED KENFIELD. a nifty
pass receiver, isn't far behind Keck
ley in ability, which means the In
dians will have to watch the lf>s-Ib.

RIGHT HALFBACK
JACK SWANER—GEORGE QUIST
JACK SWANER, if you remember. 1
was the Bear who ran SC's opening j
kickofT back 65 yards for a score last
month. Yet he's been sharing the
post with 180-lb. GEORGE FONG
all along. Neither one can compare j
with the Farm's rugged GEORGE j
QUIST when it comes to backing up
the line. The 210-lb. clutch player !
was great in the Big Game la t

! year —he set up the first Farm TD
i which set the Bears back on their
I haunches. Still, the Berkeley buga
j boos have the best of it here, of
t lensively if not defensively. How
ever. if MICKEY TITUS, along with
WAYNE ERICKSON can help Quist
out, it might be a different story.
EDGE: CAL
FULLBACK
JACK JENSEN vs.
MARTIN ANDERSON
Cal's JOHNNY GRAVES is out,
leaving . . . JACK JENSEN, a driv
ing, bruising 190—lb. fullback if there
ever was one. Jackie "doesn't care
how high the score goes against
Stanford" — and the Indians don't
care how they make him eat his
words. The guy, nevertheless, is
good. DON ZAPPETTINI and MAR
. TIN ANDERSON, both lettermen,
j have been alternating at full for the
! Red Machine. The 178-1 b. Zappet
tini is (he Farm's closest approach to
a swivel-hip runner. EDGE: CAL
CONCLUSION: California has the
advantage in seven positions, Stan
ford has the advantage in two. Two
positions are about evenly matched.
The Indians, however, are not con
ceding anything. Why should they?

R E.-DAN MERVIN vs.
L.E.—VAN DEREN
The Farm's DAS MERVIN looks
across the lino at speedy FRANK
VAN DEREN here. Although Mer
vin, 185-lb. transfer from S;inta Rosa
JC, has the drive, he hasn't been I
the pass-catching ball hawk that Van ,
Deren has turned out to be. Then
100, the Bears can shove in ex-regu- J
lar KENNY GIIOEFSEMA when
Van Deren takes five. Mervin and j
his understudy, JACK CRAHAN,
will have their hands full. EVEN
K.K.—IH TC II PHLEGER vs.
L.T.—RON SOCKOLOV
ATIIERTON PHLEGER, if he's at
the peak he was in the SC game, is j
the boy who just might shove Cal's j
RON SOCKOLOV and big JIM
TURNER around tomorrow. After i
all, only one of Cal's two gents can J

play ;it a time. It's a tough assign
ment for Stanford's veteran 215—1b.
lineman, but wilh UCLA-game cap
tain HARRY FERRIS to spell him,
he may do it. EDGE: STANFORD
R.G.—DON I IX vs.
L.G.—JIM CULLOM
JIM CULLOM—at 220 lbs., the
heaviest regular Bear lineman—does
Cal's extra point kicking, and be
tween placements he plays lots of left
guard. Stanford's DON FIX hasn't
the experience or the weight (201
lbs.), but he's improved with every
game and doesn't like to be walked
over. Watch him. EDGE: CAL
CENTER
DICK I LATLAND vs.
DOUG DUNCAN
Indian DICK FLATLAND's play is j
spotty at times, and some of his cen- j
tors to Alike Durket are oil-target. I
But when lie's fired up (and he will |
be, tomorrow), he doesn't yield to i
anybody, not even Cal's DOUG ;
DUNCAN. Flatland is a mite heavier I
than Duncan (202 to 105), but that's
about all the advantage he has; both
men are veterans at their position.
Cal has better reserves in Rob Ilile
n:an and Harry Piper. EDGE: CAL. i
L.G.—JACK McKITTRICK vs.
R.G.—ROD FRANZ
JACK McKITTRICK carries the
Cardinal colors here. The 19-year- j
old starter's big "5" keeps getting I

under more and more pileups as the ,
season progresses, but against him 1
he has ROD FRANZ, a brilliant fix
ture of the Gold and Blue. It's an- j
other case of experience and weight i
favoring the Berkeley entry.
