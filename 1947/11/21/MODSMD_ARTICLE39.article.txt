## 
### BILL SWIGART 
"Big Game Fever," water polo
variety, will sweep the Eneina Pools
this afternoon at 3:150 when Stan
ford's varsity water polo squad
tackles the highly regarded Uni
versity of California team in the
championship-deciding conference
finale.
Already assured of at least a tie
for the Southern Division crown, the
Indian mermen will seek to make it
two in a row over their arch-rivals
from Berkeley, and thereby take
over the undisputed PCC title. If
the Indians lose, they will have to
be content to share conference hon
ors with the USC Trojans.
Despite their (j to 5 loss to Stan
ford at Berkeley last Saturday, the
Golden Bear swimmers have been
installed as the favorites in this af
ternoon's battle after their con
vincing 12 to 9 victory over the
previously undefeated Olympic Club
j Wednesday night.
In top physical shape for the first

time this season, the Stanford squac!
is given a good chance to win by its
coach, Tom Haynie, provided the
Indian swimmers can hold down
Cal's one-two scoring punch for
wards Stan Morketter and Jim Wid
man. Because the Bears have an ex
cellent goalie in Dave Mensing, the
Cards will have a better chance if
they can keep down the score.
As added attractions to the var
sity game, the Stanford freshman
team wiil face the Cal yearlings in a
2:30 preliminary game, and two
girls from the women's swimming
class will present a water ballet be
tween the halves of the varsity con
test, Coach Haynie announced.
Admission is free of charge, and
the gates will open at 2:15.
