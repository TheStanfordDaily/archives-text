# Dutch Treat Custom Reigns This Weekend
## 
### 
In order to lighten the load on
the Roughs' wallets during Big i
Game week, the tradition of the
girls paying half the expenses j
was inaugurated early.
This Dutch-treat tradition is an
old one, having started with the
I first Big Game. Everyone co
operates, buying drink for drink
and dinner for dinner.
