# Cal Soccer Team Rated Over Cards
## 
### JOHN BRIER 
A California soccer team that has
dropped but one contest in two
years will invade the Farm tomor
row to meet the Indian soccerites
in one of the oldest athletic series
between the two schools. Starting
time is scheduled for 10:30 at the
soccer field.
As in football, the Indian shinkick
ers must be rated far below the in
vading Bears, but this is one sport
in which the Farm lads are given a
chance to win.
Coach Dave Tappan, who with 20
of his men jfrurneyed to Berkeley
to see Cal's game with San Francisco
State, claims that his players, man
for man are better than the Bears.
The youngish mentor put it this
way, "Cal has won 23, lost 1 and
tied 4 games in two years of play
and that just about tells the story.
They play together in the league
and then play in the San Francisco
city legaue on Sunday. That's the
kind of practice that puts a team on
top."
He added that Cal starts playing
soccer in September and plays about
two games a week. We have only
had three games this year and are
not allowed to play in the city league
as the games are played on Sunday.
Tappan ran his men through a
light scrum yesterday and has a
passing drill slated for tonight. The
jayvees will meet the Cal juniors in
the preliminary at 9:15 tomorrow
morning.
