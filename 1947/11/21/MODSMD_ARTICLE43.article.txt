# 'We'll Win,' Say Angry Card Gridders
## 
### HOWARD RIPER 
The Stanford Indians are mad!
They think they are going to win tomorrow and they don't care
who knows it. Whoever thought up those eight to one odds in
favor of the Bears better take another long look at the Indians.
Here's what some of them had to say on the field yesterday:

GEORGE QLIST: "This team will
fight this Saturday more than it has
I fought on any previous Saturday
i and a fighting team always has a
i good chance to win."
GENE MARTIN: "We've got the
spirit and we certainly can take Cal.
Don't worry about them running up
I a score on us. Jensen was just talk
! ing. In fact, he has helped us. Our
! spirit all week has been on the theme
i of 'Get Jensen.' See those tackling
j dummies over there on the side
( lines? They've represented Jensen
all week and what a beating they've
I taken."
DICK I LATLAND: "We think we
| can take them and that's all we
i need -confidence. Jensen and Cal
| are just a little too cocky. We're
J going to ram those words right back
down their throats."
A!. MORRIS: "If anybody wants to
i win, it's our boys. I definitely think
| we'll win. One thing is certain, it
J isn't going to be any GO to 14 score.
We'll fight them until we drop and
! don't be surprised if they are the
! ones to drop first."
MARTY ANDERSON: "Man for
I man we're as good as Cal. We heat
j the same bunch of follows last year
I and there's no reason why we can't
Ido it again. The reason they've had
j so much better success than we've
I had this season is because they've
j played together better as a unit.
I But we're up for this game and this
time we'll be in there fighting all
j the way."
AINSLIE BELL: "We'll win.
j There's no reason why we should
! n't. We have as good a team and
I the boys are psychologically set for
j the game. This is the big one and
| we want to bring home a win. As far
I as Cal running up a big score on us,
j that's just a lot of baloney."
WAYNE ERICKSON: "We've been

pointing till season for this game and
; now that it's here, we just h;.vo that
feeling that we're going to win. All
we need is a couple of breaks be
| cause we have the fight and spirit
j to do it."
AUBREY DEVINE: "If we score
! (he first touchdown, we'll ho an aw
-1 ful tough team to beat. If they score
| the first touchdown? They did it
1 against Southern California and you
j remember what the final score of
' that game was.

Here is JAIKIi: JKNSEN, hi},'
California fullback. lie's the man
who said he "didn't care how high
the score went against the Indians
in the Hi# Game." The Cards will
he gunning for Jack tomorrow at
the Farm stadium.
The Stanford Indians are mad!
They think they are going to win tomorrow and they don't care
who knows it. Whoever thought up those eight to one odds in
favor of the Bears better take another long look at the Indians.
Here's what some of them had to say on the field yesterday:

GEORGE QLIST: "This team will
fight this Saturday more than it has
I fought on any previous Saturday
i and a fighting team always has a
i good chance to win."
GENE MARTIN: "We've got the
spirit and we certainly can take Cal.
Don't worry about them running up
I a score on us. Jensen was just talk
! ing. In fact, he has helped us. Our
! spirit all week has been on the theme
i of 'Get Jensen.' See those tackling
j dummies over there on the side
( lines? They've represented Jensen
all week and what a beating they've
I taken."
DICK I LATLAND: "We think we
| can take them and that's all we
i need -confidence. Jensen and Cal
| are just a little too cocky. We're
J going to ram those words right back
down their throats."
A!. MORRIS: "If anybody wants to
i win, it's our boys. I definitely think
| we'll win. One thing is certain, it
J isn't going to be any GO to 14 score.
We'll fight them until we drop and
! don't be surprised if they are the
! ones to drop first."
MARTY ANDERSON: "Man for
I man we're as good as Cal. We heat
j the same bunch of follows last year
I and there's no reason why we can't
Ido it again. The reason they've had
j so much better success than we've
I had this season is because they've
j played together better as a unit.
I But we're up for this game and this
time we'll be in there fighting all
j the way."
AINSLIE BELL: "We'll win.
j There's no reason why we should
! n't. We have as good a team and
I the boys are psychologically set for
j the game. This is the big one and
| we want to bring home a win. As far
I as Cal running up a big score on us,
j that's just a lot of baloney."
WAYNE ERICKSON: "We've been

pointing till season for this game and
; now that it's here, we just h;.vo that
feeling that we're going to win. All
we need is a couple of breaks be
| cause we have the fight and spirit
j to do it."
AUBREY DEVINE: "If we score
! (he first touchdown, we'll ho an aw
-1 ful tough team to beat. If they score
| the first touchdown? They did it
1 against Southern California and you
j remember what the final score of
' that game was.
