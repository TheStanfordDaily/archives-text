# Sad News-- Experts Tab Cal to Win
## 
### 
CALIFORNIA 15V 2.1 POINTS!
That, gloomy as it may sound, is the |
considered judgment of The Daily's j
sports staff. Not even one of the j
pickers felt emboldened enough to
tab the Indians for an upset, as alma
mater loyalty ran a sickly second to
the demands of logic.
Regarding the other top games ]
throughout the nation, the scribes
have come to the following eonclu- |
.
sions: â€¢
USC over UCLA by 8 points. The
Bruins looked vastly improved in
overwhelming Washington last week,
but USC has just too much power.
Oregon over Oregon State by 7
points. The VVebfoots showed a po- j
tent offensive against Stanford last
Saturday. Oregon State is an in
and-out club, mostly out.
Washington over Washington State !
by 7 points. The Cougars, however,
have a good chance to pull an upset.
Boston College over St. Mary's by
IS points. Wedemeyer & Co., even
with last Spike Cordeiro back in the
line-up, can't match the heavier, j
more talented Beantown team.
Michigan over Ohio Stale by 2t>. |
Notre Dame over Tulanc by 11.
Wisconsin over Minnesota by 2.
Alabama over Louisiana State by j
7.
Illinois over Northwestern by S.
Purdue over Indiana by 11.
Penn Statb over Pittsburgh by 18. !
Southern Methodist over Baylor i
by 15.
Rice over Texas Christian by 12.
To date The Daily's predictors
have amassed a total of 58 wins, |
15 losses, and 5 ties for an excellent j
.794 consensus.
