# DU Gridders, Firehouse in Scoreless Mural Tieâ€”-To Play Again Today
## 
### 
The "Fiqhtinq Firemen," Stanford's intramural football
champs, received a severe jolt to their title defense when a driv
ing DU seven fought them on even terms to a scoreless tie yes
terday. Both teams played conservative football throughout the
contest in hopes of getting off to a good start in the 1947 play-

ofl's, and as a result neither team
crossed their opponent's goal line.
Each team had one scoring oppor
tunity but failed to capitalize upon
the break. Early in the first half
Dude Angius nearly intercepted a
DU aerial but dropped the ball with
a clear field in front of him.
The DU's missed their chance
when Fireman Jack Barry knocked
a Jake Preston end-zone pass out
of the DU receiver's hands. Besides
these two scoring threats both teams
played an air-tight ball game; with
each team looking for another scor
ing break which never came.
Stalwarts for the DU's were
passer Jack Preston, and Mike Koo
nan and Jim Caldwell on defense.
For the Fire laddies, Webb and
Blown were outstanding in line play.
Lloyd Merriman, assistant intra
mural director, announced that the
Firehouse versus DU deadlock would
probably be played off today.
In other lootball playoffs five
league til lists emerged victorious,
while their respective opponents
were eliminated. In a first round

game the high powered Betas roared
to a 24 to 0 victory over the Phi
Delts' I team, with Bernard Woody
leading the way. In an upset, the
SAE's won over the favored Delta
Tau Deltas 15 to 7. and the Big Red
Machine ground under the Zeta Psi's
18 to 2. The Alpha Delts took a close
one, 8 to 6, from the Dekelets, and
the Sigma Nu's eliminated the Kap
pa Alpha ll's by a 33 to 0 conquest.
Winners of these games will con
tinue the playoffs until the three
top teams remain. These three will
play among themselves for the
championship, and each team must
suffer two defeats before they are
eliminated.

ofl's, and as a result neither team
crossed their opponent's goal line.
Each team had one scoring oppor
tunity but failed to capitalize upon
the break. Early in the first half
Dude Angius nearly intercepted a
DU aerial but dropped the ball with
a clear field in front of him.
The DU's missed their chance
when Fireman Jack Barry knocked
a Jake Preston end-zone pass out
of the DU receiver's hands. Besides
these two scoring threats both teams
played an air-tight ball game; with
each team looking for another scor
ing break which never came.
Stalwarts for the DU's were
passer Jack Preston, and Mike Koo
nan and Jim Caldwell on defense.
For the Fire laddies, Webb and
Blown were outstanding in line play.
Lloyd Merriman, assistant intra
mural director, announced that the
Firehouse versus DU deadlock would
probably be played off today.
In other lootball playoffs five
league til lists emerged victorious,
while their respective opponents
were eliminated. In a first round

game the high powered Betas roared
to a 24 to 0 victory over the Phi
Delts' I team, with Bernard Woody
leading the way. In an upset, the
SAE's won over the favored Delta
Tau Deltas 15 to 7. and the Big Red
Machine ground under the Zeta Psi's
18 to 2. The Alpha Delts took a close
one, 8 to 6, from the Dekelets, and
the Sigma Nu's eliminated the Kap
pa Alpha ll's by a 33 to 0 conquest.
Winners of these games will con
tinue the playoffs until the three
top teams remain. These three will
play among themselves for the
championship, and each team must
suffer two defeats before they are
eliminated.
