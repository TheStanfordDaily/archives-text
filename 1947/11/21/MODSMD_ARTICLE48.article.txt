## 
### 
Two undefeated football teams.
California's Ramblers and the Stan
ord junior varsity will meet to
norrow morning at 11:00 in the
Stanford Stadium with each out
fit desperately seeking the win that
vvill give it a perfect season.
If the betting odds are 8 to 1
against the Card varsity in tomor
row's contest, they should read
something like 10 to 1 against the
jayvees. The California team that
will invade the farm tomorrow
boasts a five won, no loss record,
having run up 18G points while al
lowing its opponents but four touch
down.
GOOD CHANCE EOR WIN
When queried as to his team's
â€¢fiances in tomorrow's game, Coach
Jim Cox stated, "I think we have
a very good chance to win. 1 know
that is what most coaches would
say when their team is about to
meet an opponent that is generally
considered to be very superior, but
4hat is the way I really feel."
The big ex-Indian gridder added,
"It's true that the Ramblers have
some men on their squad who played
a lot of varsity ball last year; and
it's also true that some of them,
such as Boots Erb and Rube Navarro
have seen some varsity action this
year, but they might be in for a sur
prise this week," The only common
opponent for the two squads is the
Cal Aggies. The Ramblers shut them
out by a 20 to 0 score and the Stan
fordites won by a 26 to 14 count.
