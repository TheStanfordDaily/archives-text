With that thought in mind, I ap
■ proach the subject of a Big Game
prediction with fear in my heart
and sweat on my brow. Stanford,
most consistent team in the United
States this .season, meets a California
j squad that has ranged from the
j heights of a tremendous walloping
| of Wisconsin to the depths of a hu
miliating defeat at the hands of USC.
I admire Stanford's consistency, de
i plore the lack of the same quality
: on the part of California.
On the basis of consistency Stan
ford must rate the role of people's
choice but in these games hallowed
by years of traditional rivalry any
thing may—and frequently does—
' happen. I expect to see California,

I aroused to its highest pitch of the
: year, register an upset victory. But
: Stanford, a team that has earned
j the plaudits for its gameness if
nothing else, will be no pushover.
I California will be lucky to win by
two touchdowns.
Jack McDonald, San Francisco
Call Bulletin—l hear it rumored Cal
ain't even gonna show up for the
Big Game, but if Marchie Schwartz
! would let the word get around that
he promises to punt on the first
| down after he is three touchdowns
ahead I think it would influence
Pappy's boys to bring the team down
j there for the game.
In conclusion I think there's a
good chance for Stanford to hold
Cal scoreless for one quarter. That
must be the fourth period because
I've doped the first three and the
Bears seem to be making headway
in each of those.
