# ...and There's the Kickoff
## 
### 
It's nearing kickoff time.
Memories of the 49 past Big Games drift down
upon a packed Stanford stadium. Memories of
that first game in San Francisco in 1892. Of the
1898 battle when California won its initial game
of the series. Or of 1906 when the Big Game
was changed from American football to rugby
for an eight-year period.
The last strains of the National Anthem de
scend upon an audience standing at silent at
tention.
Remember the losses suffered by Stanford
at the hands of the Wonder Teams of Andy
Smith? When Erb, and Muller, and Majors,
were the Jackie Jensens, the Jack Swaners, and
the Johnny Graves of the 1920'5. Or the 1924
Big Game when a gallant Indian team led by
Murray Cuddeback broke the reign of Cal by
fighting to a 20-20 standstill.
The officials are on the field talking with cap
tain George Quist and co-captains Johnny
Graves and Harry Agler.
Then in 1933 the Vow Boys led by Bobby
Grayson edged out the Bears. They were the
Rose Bowl champs of New Years Day in 1935,
after taking the measure of the Bears in '34. But
even as the Vow Boys were leaving Stanford, a

great team which was to represnt UC in the late
1930's was beginning to assemble.
The teams are lining up for the opening kick
off.
In 1937 Cal went to the Rose Bowl after Chap
man-Slockton-Bottari-Herwig and company ram
bled over the Indians at full speed. Memories
of Frankie Albert linger in the Stanford Sta
dium and remembrances of the seasons of
1940 and 1941 when "The Spirit of Stanford"
and the re-introduction of the T formation were
fodder for nationwide comment.
The 90,000 spectators are arisingâ€”90,000
pairs of eyes stare at 100 yards of turf in the
center of the arena.
Recall the 1942 game in which a surprisingly
strong Indian team whipped the Blue and Gold.
They still talk in Berkeley and on the Farm of
the 1946 victory that was Stanford's. How, com
ing back after three football-less years, a Car
dinal eleven led by Lloyd Merriman ran up a
25-6 marqin over an unsuccessful US squad.
The team captain of the receiving team sig
nals to the officials that his team is ready.
From the other end of the field eleven men
simultaneously start to run toward the midfield
stripe.
The Fiftieth Big Game is about to begin.
