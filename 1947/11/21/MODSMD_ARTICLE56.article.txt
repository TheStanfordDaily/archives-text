SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (UP).
— California's powerful Golden
Bears reversed their field today and
began touching up their passing at
tack for their 50th annual "Big
Game" with Stanford at Palo Alto
Saturday.
Coach Lynn Waldorf, harassed
and worried despite eight-to-oni
odds favoring California over the
Indian eleven that has lost eight
consecutive games, changed his
mind about concentrating on goal
line stands and gave the Bears a

new set of pass plays.
He said the Bears would not be
seriously "crippled" by injuries to
seven players, including fullback
Johnny Graves, because "we have
good men ready to step into their
shoes and do good jobs.
