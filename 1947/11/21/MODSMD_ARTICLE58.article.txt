# Ex-Injun Tells Of Big Game Premiere in '92

(The article below was written
especially for this issue of The
Daily hy the Kev. Ellsworth L.
Itifh, who was the starting left
tackle for Stanford in the first
liig Game, March 19, 1X92. All
cartoons with the article are pho
tographic copies of the originals,
which appeared in the San Fran
cisco Examiner March 20, 1892,

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you




These are (he II men who gave Stanford its first Big Game victory, in the fiisl Big Game ever played.
They were the first string of :ni Indian team which defeated the University of California, 14 to 10, on
March Ift, 1892. Back row (starting with the man with the mustache): C. C. ADAMS, right guard; A. 11.
BARNIIEISEL, center rush; S. I). BRIGGS, left guard; E. L. KIC'H, left tackle. Front row: ('. S. DOWNING,
right tackle; M. I). GROSII, right end; P. M. DOWNING, right halfback; J. R. WHITTEMORE (captain),
left hall hack; T. K. CODE, quarterback; C. L. CLEM ANS, fullback; C. 11. HOGG, left end.


manage to hold a winning team to
gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.

at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you




These are (he II men who gave Stanford its first Big Game victory, in the fiisl Big Game ever played.
They were the first string of :ni Indian team which defeated the University of California, 14 to 10, on

manage to hold a winning team to
gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need

days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you




These are (he II men who gave Stanford its first Big Game victory, in the fiisl Big Game ever played.
They were the first string of :ni Indian team which defeated the University of California, 14 to 10, on

manage to hold a winning team to
gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi

letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.
(The article below was written
especially for this issue of The
Daily hy the Kev. Ellsworth L.
Itifh, who was the starting left
tackle for Stanford in the first
liig Game, March 19, 1X92. All
cartoons with the article are pho
tographic copies of the originals,

cisco Examiner March 20, 1892,

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you




These are (he II men who gave Stanford its first Big Game victory, in the fiisl Big Game ever played.

gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a

to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.
(The article below was written

Itifh, who was the starting left
tackle for Stanford in the first

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you

gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook

love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En

towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
1946. page 176. excerpt from "My
Favorite Sport Stories") told the
athletic world that Herbert Hoover
was the moving spirit in the ear
liest days of Stanford football. I
am sure that I know "Herb" Hoo
ver (as we called him in college
days) well enough to know that he
—with many Stanford honors, the
honor of the United States Presi
dency, and also many world honors
would not want, to "purloin" the
honor of leading Stanford's first
football efforts.
Herb was manager of a later team
and did a good job, as one could
expect, but football was on its way
at that time —"down on the Farm."
Of course, it would boost Bill
Stern, to boost Herbert Hoover, but
I am sure that Hoover doesn't need
this extra honor, and will not claim
it. It belongs mostly to Whittemore,
who worked so tirelessly for that
first victorious Stanford football
yame in March of 1802.
(The article below was written
especially for this issue of The
Daily hy the Kev. Ellsworth L.
Itifh, who was the starting left
tackle for Stanford in the first
liig Game, March 19, 1X92. All
cartoons with the article are pho

cisco Examiner March 20, 1892,

The University of California had
heard of this proposed, new, won
derful Stanford University, and
thought to show her, in the very be
ginning, her proper place in Cali
fornia, which "Cal" herself had, to
111i . time, completely dominated.
She scut down a challenge for a
j'ame of football in the fall of 1891.
The challenge was read to the
];oy: iu Fncina Hall, and talked of
in thi- book store (which your writ
< > had in charge at that time). This
challenge found us in our swaddling
( lothes, but it stirred us about, and
v/c quick ly passed the diaper stage.
Thinking ourselves kids enough
1o piay football, we accepted the
challenge conditionally. It was then
; I most Thanksgiving time, so No
vember !801 was obviously an im
po;:ible month for the proposed
contest, yet we wanted to be a real
university, and finally agreed to a
i ate in Macrch 1892 for the first
or "1891 game." This game was
played on the field of the Haight
Street ball park in San Francisco.
Gcon/e Champlain of' Red Bluff,
n " 95," was our first business man-

;ger, and, with Captain Whittemore,
Jiad the team on the field — pre
pared, with football shoes and
muchly unpadded uniforms—ready
to play at game time —2 p.m. We
had no head-guarding helmet (and
neither did we have a man hurt se
riously in that first game, making
no substitutions through the whole
time). Some of the players wore
rubber nose guards because Jeff
Wilson (a good player, but too light
in tonnage to make the team) had

broken his nose in desperate play
»<n the practice squad of 13 to 15
men against whom we trained. (We
needed more resistance; hence, usu
ally 14 or 15 men for greater oppo
: ition in practice play.)
We stood (there being no
benches) at the sideline, ready to
i ush onto the field and be slaugh
tered, when up came George say
ing, "They forgot to bring a foot
bail." So we had to stand there for

j 15 to 20 minutes, exercising (more
[ or less) to keep from chilling in (he
San Francisco air, while the "Cal"
manager jumped a streetcar and
went down town to Spalding's to
bring back a ball in order thai play

might be started.
There's a shout at the gate, "The
football has arrived!!" The game is
about to be called, but before "kick
oft" let's listen. "Cal" is lustily
singing, to the tune of "Marching
through Georgia," about Dr. Jor
dans school boys, whom they are
going to thrash soundly and send
"back to the farm"—"to learn to
play football" . . . "While we are
marching through 'Jordan'."
Game was called, the two captains
agreeing on the procedure, as there
was no such animal as an annoying
referee with a whistle. When the
runner could proceed no farther
with six to a dozen men piled on
his back, he grunted "down" and
the players piled off — often too
slowly. Distance to be gained for
a first down was five yards, with
three downs to make it or surrender
the ball. (This proved too easy for
the offense, and a few years later
the rule was changed to the present
status: four downs—lo yards to go.)
. We played the seven-man line,
with one-two-one behind the line.
Our team (from left to right) was:
LE, Milt Grosh; LT, E. L. Rich; LG,
Stewart Briggs, C, Arthur Barnhi
sel: RG, Charlie Adams; RT, Claude
Downing; RE, Charlie Hogg; Q,
Tom Code; LH, Paul "Fat" Down
ing; RH, C. L. Clemans; F, John R.
Whittemore (captain).
We played much as they do now
—bucks at the line—center, guard,
or tackle, wherever we thought we
made it best, and around the end,
following interference. Then, of
course, we worked the criss-cross,

one half starting and passing the
ball to the other half or to the full
back to carry. We used no for
ward pass in those times.
The "Cal" backs (except Benson,
whom we counted not a clean play
er) were big men: Foulkes and
Sherman, halves; and Hunt, full.
They were good line blockers, but
our backs could "out-foot" them
around the ends. Kick-oft was from
the center of the field, and the goal
posts were on the goal line, not hav
ing been set. back 10 yards yet.
Time of play was one and a half
hours in two 45 - minute periods,
with only 10 minutes of rest at
half-time.
We had no coach or trainers, but
took good care of ourselves, ate well,
and had our practicing in "down on
the farm" sunshine. The "Cal" team
averaged 11 pounds per player
heavier than ours, but we had one
man at half, Clemans, who was re-

sponsible for much of our yardage.
He had a fine straight-arm jolt, but
best was his stride, which was very
long and deceiving.
At half-time, the score was Stan
ford 14, California 0. A touchdown
then scored five points, a goal (or
conversion) one point, and a safe
ty scored two points. All the boast
ful, betting "Cal" boosters had dis
appeared, and an old battered nick
el or a punctured dime could not
be found with a fine-tooth comb
among the "Cal" crowd.

In the second half, weight began
| to tell, and, with the .shorter dis
j tance of five yards for a first down
willi three tries to make the five

! yards, ''Cal" scored 10 points, mak
| ing the final score of the first game
i Stanford 14, California 10.
I have always maintained that
J first defeat of "Cal" in football did
I more for the University of Califor-
I nia than any other single influence
! that ever affected the State Univer
sity. Trustees, faculty, and alumni,
as well as students and friends of
the school, perked up and began to
ask how a new University, less than
a year old, could defeat them so
decidedly, and things began to hap
pen on the Berkeley campus.
In the second game (a 10 to 10
tie, played at the Haight Street
grounds), the "father of football,"
Walter Camp, was our coach. Thus
was begun Pacific Coast football—
by the Stanford boys "down on the
farm."
(I wish I had time to tell the
story of the "Farm" before the ex
istence of Stanford University, and
; even before Senator Stanford
1 owned any of the farm property.)
I There were no Washington or
I Oregon teams in early Pacific Coast
I football. No USC or UCLA in those
'< days, but only an Olympic Club
j team in San Francisco and a Mult
j nomah Club team in Portland, both
[ of which we played and defeated.
Now one asks, "How did you




These are (he II men who gave Stanford its first Big Game victory, in the fiisl Big Game ever played.
They were the first string of :ni Indian team which defeated the University of California, 14 to 10, on

manage to hold a winning team to
gether without coach or trainers?"
Well. I think it to be simple.
Stanford, from scratch, had a
wonderful "esprit de corps," due:
first, to the high regard for the
founders because of their great
love-gift to young people; second,
to the respect and love for President
Jordan and his fine faculty, heads
of the departments, such men as
Professors Swain, Elliot, Branner,
Gilbert, Jenkins, Marx, Sanford,
Stillman, Barnes, Anderson, Mur
ray, Wither Miller, and J. O. Griffin,
who warmly gave their confidence
to their students; third, because the
boys were so closely associated,
most of them living together in En
cina Hall—a few living in nearby
towns; and finally, because of the
splendid leadership of Captain John
R. Whittemore (now of Rosebrook
in Southern California).
Now far be it from me to seek a
difference with Bill Stern on ath
letics, and yet Bill, in a recent issue
of the Reader's Digest (November,
