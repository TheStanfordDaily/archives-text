# Bears, Indians Scrap for 50th Time; 20-20 Tie of 1924 Called 'Game of Games' as Cards Came Through in Closing Seconds
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
A Golden Year of football will
explode on the Cardinal arena to
morrow in all the pomp and pag
eantry and color which has marked
every California - Stanford tussle
since 1892.
It will usher in the "fiftieth game
of the aeries."
It will add a canopy of luster to
cast shadows upon heroics once
performed by the Larsons, Neverses,
Graysons, Corbuses, Alberts, Mid
lers, Herwigs, Riegelses, and Bot
taris.
It will draw more than 90.000 of
the curious to view the might of
California against the tight of Stan
ford.
ALL BEGAN IN 1X92
And it began in 1892, on the fog
lined sod of Haight Park in San
Francisco before a sprightly gath
ering of 5,000. Outweighed 11
pounds per man, the Stanfords,
fashioning a surprising piece of
legerdemain, defeated the Bears, 14
to 10.
It took the Blue and Gold six
years before they could win a game,
finully toppling the Cards, 22 to 0,
in 1898.
Rugby dominated the scene from
190ti through 1914, both schools per
forming equally on a basis of wins
and losses.
In 1920, the Berkeley Bears, can
ny Andy Smith at the helm, flat
tened the Stanfords, 38 to 0. The
Bears also dominated the statistics
by amassing 303 yards to Stanford's
19, bringing remembrances of Char
ley Erb, Brick Muller, and Cort
Majors of Cal.
The following year, California
walloped the Indians, 42 to 7, and
the Bears again waltzed into the
Rose Bowl.
BIGGEST OF THEM ALL
After two more setbacks, the
"game of games," called by the
critics the best Big Game, was
played in 1924.
An underdog Card squad, minus
the services of Ernie Nevers and
big Norman Cleaveland, battled to
a 20 to 20 standstill with the East
Bay provincials.
Murray Cuddeback's two field

goals and a Ted Shipkey TD
sparked the Stanfords to come from
behind in the last 10 minutes of
play.
Plagued by heavy-weighted Cal
triumphs, the 1926 Cardinals, with
Pop Warner at the reins, ran rough
shod over (he Bears, 41 to 8. Card

halfback Dink Hyland took the
opening kickoff and rambled some
46 yards to a score.
CARDS WIN, 41 TO (I
In 1930 Stanlord decisively waxed
the Bears, 41 to 0, as Phil Moffatt,
Harlow Rothert, and Ernie Caddell

I
ran all over the disorganized UC
eleven.
A touchdown by Hank Schaldach
provided the Bears with a meager 6
to 0 win in 1931, and with Schal
dach plagued with injuries the next
year, Cal and Stanford posted a
scoreless tie on the books.
The Vow Boys of Stanford edged
the Blue and Gold, 6 to 3, in 1933,
as Bobby Grayson, Monk Mgscrip,
Frank Alustiza, Woody Adams et al,
made their first appearances in Car- ;
dinal garments.
CARL SCHOTT THE HERO
A sub end won the '34 Big Game i
with a field goal. The kid, one Carl â– 
Schott, subbing for the injured |
Moscrip, booted a three - pointer '
from the 15-yard line.
California picked up steam dur
ing the 1933-37 period, casting the
likes of Sam Chapman, Bob Her
wig, John Meek, Vard Stockton, j
Dave DeVarona, and Vic Bottari
onto the gridiron.
Bottari's passing, Meek's block
ing, Herwig's defensive play all
combined to push the Bears into
the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. 1938.
Al Derian set off a 32 to 14 Cal I
win in 1939 by rambling some 57 !
yards to a TD.
THE WOW BOYS'' GAME
Need one say more than the fol- j
lowing: Stanford 13, California 7.
in 1940?

j With an unknown end, Clem To
merlin, sparking a sophomore line,
j the Cards managed to ouLscore the
( Bears and wind up in the Rose
Bowl. Frankie Albert, Chuck Tay
-1 lor, Fred Meyer, and Dick Palmer
lof the Stanfords effectively over
came a Bob Reinhard - led Cal
squad.
In '41, Reinhard played what was
i considered the best collegiate game
J of his career to throttle the Indians,
l(i to 0. Jim Jurkovich was the of-
J fensive big gun for Cal, coached by
! Stub Allison, the former Carleton
!Hash.
At season's end the next year,
i more than one expert said: "Stan-
I ford is the best team on the coast."
i A rangy QB, Ray Hammett, suc
cessor to two-time All - American
Albert, flanked by Milt Vucinich
and buck Fawcett, swamped the
Bears, 2(5 to 7.
NO GAMES DURING WAR
The second World War forced
i cancellation of the Big Game from
1943 through 1945, despite the fact
; that Cal continued with the sport.
And when the "era of discharge
points and ration books" faded, the
j Stanfords roared back to the light
' last year.
A cerise-topped fullback, Lloyd
Merriman, aided by a speed-01-loot
i backfield, engineered a surprise 25
to 6 decision over the Berkeleyans.
CARDS HOLD MARGIN
In the struggle lor statistics, the
! Stanfords have scored 534 points to
j California's 533. The Injuns have
won 23 contests, lost 18 to the Bears,
| while eight games have resulted in
j ties.
| Who knows what may be the

outcome of tomorrow's ha!tie?
Who knows who may emerge as
another game star to parallel the
feats of Schott, Cuddeback, Hoff
man, Imlay, Shlaucloman, and Vin
cent i?
"The Golden Year of California-
Stanford history!
The pomp and pageantry of a leg
end come true,
Attired in gridiron sequins of fate
Twixt Stanford red and the Berke
ley blue."


TED SHIPKEY was another
great Stanford end. lie was se
lected on the All-American team
o! 1026.


BRICK MULLER is generally
conceded to be the greatest Bear
of them all. He played end on
Andy Smith's wonder teams in
the early 1920'5. lYlullcr is an all
time Ail-American. *


Stanford's MONK MOSCKIP, |
deadly field goal booter and great |
end, was nominated to All-Amer
ican teams in both lfH4 and 1935. I
