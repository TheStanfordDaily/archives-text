# Fans Like Spirit; Many Predict Upset
## 
### 
A disastrous losing streak has
One little to dampen the enthusi
>m of the average Stanford root
r. Queried as to Stanford's chances
i the Bitf Game, campus personali
ps cross their fingers and almost
hanimously predict an Indian vic-
M-y.
Some consulted ouija boards,
rners went into a seance with a
fystal ball, but most of those in
(rviewed were impressed with the
nprovement and great spirit that
ke Card gridders have shown in
H:cnt weeks.
MARILYN SCHWARTZ ('5O —
ranner) says: "Sure we're going
> win. I don't know what the score
'ill be, but Stanford's revised team
birit is going to prove too much for
jal."
JAKE IRWIN (in charge of the
iicina Gym Store and equipment
pom): "In view of our fine show
kg against the powerhouse South
in Cal team, I'm inclined to agree
rith Marchie that we may take the
;ig Game. The spirit of the team is
igher now than it's been all sea
>n and we definitely have a chance
cainst California."
JOHN HUNEKE ('5l — Encina):
The odds are about 3 to 1 against
p but if our injury list is light, we
ave a possible chance of pulling
h upset."
MAURICE DEI.YON (Campus
Hoe repair shop): "I think it will
e close, with Stanford possibly
'inning by one or two points."
PHILIP T. MoLEAN (Librarian,
toover Library): "My wife gradu
ted from Cal. so she wouldn't agree
fith me, but I'd say that Stanford
ffis a pretty good chance of win
ing it."
TOM lIAYNIE (Swimming
joach) with the approval of his
bhort MYRON SPRAGUE said: "I
jiink we have an excellent chance."
BEN FOWLER (Encina Barber
hop): "It's happened more than
nee that Stanford has gone into the
ig Game as the underdog and
>me out on top. All of us in here
link it'll happen again this time."
GEORGE CASTRO (Village Bar
er Shop): "OfT the fight they
flowed against USC, I pick Stan
!>rd."
JOE LEDUC (Union Barber
hop): "I'm going to bet on Stan
>rd."
BARItARA HOSIvINS (graduate
iudent, Village): "I don't know

much about it, but I'm afraid we'll
lose."
BILL ROSS ('SO —Village): "If
we continue to improve, we stand
a good chance of winning. In fact,
unless everybody is crippled, we're
going to win."
JOHN MARSTON (Fire Chief):
"Optimist that I am, I think Stan
ford's going to take 'em in a rough,
close game. It may end up in a tie.

but if our boys play as well against
California as they did against USC,
we should come out on top."
JUNYA DOTY ('sl — Roble):
"The ouija board says that Stanford
will win by two touchdowns."
"BLACKIE" (in charge of the En
cina Cellar): "The Big Game is
something different. After watching
Stanford - California tussles for 20
; years, I know that past perform
ances don't mean a thing. This
year's game can go either way and
the difference will probably be an
extra point or a field goal."
SHIRLEY KAUFMAN (51
Branner): "I'm not sure who'll win
the game but I am certain that our
team will make a good showing
and, after all, that's the important
thing."
THOMAS NEWELL (instructor
in journalism department): "Be
cause it's the traditional game of
the year, Stanford has an excellent
chance for an upset victory. How
ever, let's face facts. California's
team looks a little too strong for us
to pull that upset."
RICHARD SCHUETTE ("49
Kappa Sigma): "After watching the
California team smash everybody
but USC in comparison to the hap
less and ineffective offense Stanford
has shown all year, it looks to me
like Cal by at least two touch
downs."
