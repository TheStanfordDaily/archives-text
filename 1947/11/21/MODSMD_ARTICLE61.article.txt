# 1918 Big Game Still Disputed
## 
### 
Looking back through the history
of the Cal-Stanford football panics, I
which began in 1892, we find that ,
there is a slight controversy as to
the number of games each school |
has won. J
Cal records show that the series
stands as 23 wins for Stanford, 19
wins for Cal, and 8 ties. However,
Stanford gives them credit for only
18 victories.
The questionable game goes way
back to 1918, when Stanford sent a
team from its Army Training Corps
to play Cal, and Stanford was
crushed (57 to 0. It was their first
game of American football since
1905.
A quote from the Daily Palo Alto
the day before the Big Game said, j
"If we are defeated tomorrow, it
will be no mar on Stanford's ath
letic record. A team playing an en
tirely new game, unfamiliar en- ;
tirely to many of its members, can
hardly be expected to go through a !
winning season.
