# Bears Out for Vengeance But Schwartz Has Hopes
## UC Sportswriter Says Cal Is Mad 
### PHIL GREGORY 
Sports Editor, Daily Californian
The Bears are mad. They're
miffed that this isn't going to be the
big one that sends them to the Rose
Bowl. But their main mad comes
from rnmpmbering what they can't
forget—last year's Big Game. And
the fact that most members of this
year's California club were on last
season's thoroughly humbled squad
bodes no good for the hated Cardi
nals in this installment of the famed
series.
A RADICAL CHANGE
Seldom does a team change so
radically in the space of one year
as has this Bear eleven which Stan
ford will be called upon to stop to
morrow. If you've been holed up
all season (and who could blame a
Stanford supporter for that?) then
possibly you haven't heard of the
"Wonderful Waldorf's," the "Come
back Kids" who bounced back from
possibly the worst football season
in the long history of California to
run up one of the best Bear records
ever.
If such is the case, then just take
a look tomorrow at a high-geared
team displaying a sound, well-or
ganized offense and a rugged and
aggressive defense.
SAME CAL PLAYERS
What is actually responsible for
this grid metamorphosis? Well,
there's the obvious answer of Lynn
Waldorf. Take that one and you
wouldn't be far wrong. But what of
the players. Can you leave them
out of the picture? We think not.
When California started out like a
house afire this year, there were
many who figured, "Well, they've
finally gone out and beat the bushes
for some players." But the fact is,
with only a few exceptions in late
returnees from the service, this sea
son's rejuvenated Bears are identi
cal with last year's bunch.
Under Waldorf the players felt
they would be judged on their suc
cesses and failures this season. They
felt their assertions regarding the
football situation at California
could be considered only moans at
the end of a dismal season only be
cause of their own fault. Most ob
servers this year now agree that the
players proved their point — and
then some.
KEY BEARS INJURED
A few weeks ago no one would
have given Stanford any chance at
all against this high - riding Bear
team. But the Indians have been
showing some signs of coming to
life these past few games while Cal
ifornia has come up with some in
juries to key men. This may crip
ple the Bears badly. But California
fans aren't feeling too bad about
this last item. They figure without
some sort of a handicap the Bears
might chase the Indians right out
of the stadium. As it is, they figure
their team can be pretty sure of
another Big Game victory.
But the Bears still aren't taking
anything away from this year's
bunch of Indians. Beaten at every
turn, the hated Cardinals have been
pathetic at times. With all that,
however, they had sufficient spirit
to keep going and show some late
season improvement, enough to
make a game out of it tomorrow.
Gridiron prosperity hasn't gone to
the heads of the Bears to the extent
of making them forget how it is to
flounder through a season.
No. the Bears haven't forgotten.
They haven't forgotten last year's
Big Game.
Come to think of It, maybe it
would be better for the Indians if
the Bears could forget it.
