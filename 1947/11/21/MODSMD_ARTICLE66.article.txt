What are the odds of Stanford
winning this year's Big Game?
Well, according to Head Coach
Marchie Schwartz, the Indians
"have a good chance against Cali
fornia" when the two teams meet
for the fiftieth time tomorrow in the
big Stanford bowl.
But the headman had nothing but
plaudits for the job Coach Lynn
"Pappy" Waldorf has done at Ber
keley.
"Waldorf has done an amazing
coaching job and has instituted a
terrific winning spirit on his team."
BEAR RECORD PRAISED
It is Waldorf who came to ''the
coaches' graveyard" last spring, af
ter one of the Golden Bears' most
disastrous seasons, and has led Cal
ifornia through nine games so far
this year, suffering only one defeat.
Coach Schwartz then turned back
to the Stanford roster, and singled
out some of his own players for spe
cial praise.
"George Quist has turned in ex
cellent defensive play this season,
and the progressive improvement of
Don B'ix and Jack McKittrick has
helped the team tremendously."
Oil, THOSE FRESHMEN
When the subject of this year's
Indian freshman football team was
brought up, the Stanford grid men
tor was especially liberal in his
praise.
"Those freshmen will help us a
lot next season. And Chuck Taylor
turned in an excellent coaching job
while leading his squad through an
undefeated season."
In closing, Coach Schwartz men
tioned the outstanding spirit shown
on the Farm this season. "Not only
the students, but the alumni and
members of the team itself, have all
shown wonderful spirit during the
games this season."
Marchie Schwartz is one of foot
ball's most colorful personalities.
His name has been linked with grid
successes, both as an All-American
player and as one of the game's top
mentors.
He was born 37 years ago in New
Orleans. He played for Notre
Dame, winning varsity football let
ters in 1929, IS3O, and 1931. He
played under the tutelage of the
immortal Knute Rockne during his
sophomore and junior years, and
under Hunk Anderson in his final
year with the Fighting Irish. ,
