# Both Teams Use Shaughnessy's 'T'
## 
### 
Stanford was the first college
team to use the modern "T" forma
tion from which both teams will
run their offenses tomorrow.
Clark Shaughnessy introduced
the "T" when he came to Stanford
in 1910. and the fabulously success
ful season the "Wow Boys" had us
ing il did much to give the forma
tion its current popularity.
It was developed by Shaughnessy
and George Halas, coach of the pro
fessional Chicago Bears.
Although Shaughnessy always
claimed that the ' T" is not intrinsi
cally better than any other forma
tion, and that its success depends on
the material available, a large ma
jority of college coaches have
adopted il as their basic attack.
