# Light, Speedy Indian Jayvee Backs Set for Bear Juniors
## 
### 
The lads pictured above comprise
the Stanford junior varsity's "pony"
baekfield, their hard-hitting center,
and their couch. The five football
ers are expected to see a good deal
of action in tomorrow's preliminary
to the Big Game, against the Cal
Ramblers.
Although, as in years past, the
main purpose of the jayvees is to
provide competition for their var
sity brethren, the Cox-coached jun
iors have had time to develop a high
scoring outfit of their own.
On the eve of their last contest of
the 1947 season, a brief thumbnail
sketch is given of five of the start
ing 11 men.

Coxmen this season. Don is a junior
in standing but has two years of el
igibility left if he chooses to use
them. He played on the '45 version
of the Big Red Machine as a first
string left half, and saw some var

JV coach at that time, he learned

JAMES AT QUARTER
A 19-year-old transfer from San
ta Rosa JC. by the name of Ron
James, handles the quarterbacking
chores for the JV's. Ron played
first - string quarterback for that
school last year and transferred to
the Farm last spring quarter. He is
a sophomore in standing and has
two years of eligibility. San Jose is
the home of the slim 155-pounder.
He is 5 ft. 9 in. tall.
One might not believe it to see
the speedy Bobby Bahlman romp
for long gainers, but the little left
half had never played football until
he donned a suit and reported for
practice last spring. Under the tu
telage of Pete Kmetovic, who was

JV coach at that time, he learned
the game and is now one of the best
backs on the squad. He is a junior,
but has two years oi play remain
ing if he chooses to use them. The
21-year-old, 165-pound scatback is
the only non - California!! in the
starting back field. His home is in
Portland, Orgeon.
The lad over the ball is 20-year
old Jack Porter. Jack played ball
for Haddonfield High School in New
Jersey for three years before his
folks moved to Davis. California,
where he now lives. The 185-pound
center is a sophomore and he also
has two years of play left.


FIVE MEMBERS OF THIS YEAR'S JV TEAM AM) TIIEIR COACH. Reading from It ft to rip lit they
are: Van Johns, right hall; Don Lipelt, fullback; Ron James, quarterback; Bobliy ISahlman, left half; and
Jim Cox, coach. Jack Porter is the center.
The lads pictured above comprise
the Stanford junior varsity's "pony"
baekfield, their hard-hitting center,
and their couch. The five football
ers are expected to see a good deal
of action in tomorrow's preliminary
to the Big Game, against the Cal
Ramblers.
Although, as in years past, the
main purpose of the jayvees is to
provide competition for their var
sity brethren, the Cox-coached jun
iors have had time to develop a high
scoring outfit of their own.
On the eve of their last contest of
the 1947 season, a brief thumbnail
sketch is given of five of the start
ing 11 men.
