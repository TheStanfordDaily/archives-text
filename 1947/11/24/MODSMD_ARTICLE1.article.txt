# 10-1 Odds? Scared Cal Wins, 21-18

### JOHN HUBBARD 
Marehie Schwartz was wrong.
lie had prophesied that the In
dians would win one game this year.
They didn't. They lost their ninth
in a row, the season's finale, the
Big Game, to California by the
slender margin of three extra
points, 21 to 18, before 85,000 deliri
ous onlookers in Stanford Stadium
Saturday.
But it doesn't really matter that
Marchie was wrong. It doesn't mat
ter at ;il!. Stanford's 10 to 1 under
dogs, on the shortest end of the
longest odds of any Big Game,'
pushed California all over the field,
had the Bears groggy and reeling,
had them shaken and frantic before
finally going down to defeat in the
fourth quarter of what may well
have been the greatest game in the
50-year history of this football clas
sic.
WEIRD FLAY
Victory came for the Be?rs on a
weird 80-yard pass play from full
hack Jack Jensen to halfback Paul

Keckley, with less than four min
utes remaining in the final period.
Up to that point it had been any
body's ball game, and even more
unbelievable than that, for some
eight impossible, amazing minutes
in the fourth quarter it had been
Stanford's ball game, 18 to 14.
Then, while the massive Califor
nia rooting section sat stunned and
silent at the prospect of a Stanford
triumph, Jensen took a shovel-lat
eral from quarteback Bob Celeri,
ran to his right and threw diago
nally across the field to Keckley.
standing in the clear on Stanford's
40. His pass was short. Keckley had
to come back toward the line of
scrimmage and make an almost
shoestring catch of the ball.
He wriggled through the Indian
secondary and sprinted 60 yards to
the end zone, with Stanford's Ken
dall Peck making a desperate at
tempt at a leaping tackle from be
hind on the five-yard line.
CULLOM CONVERTS
Jim Cullom, big California guard,
calmly booted home the conversion,
as he had done twice before in the
game, and the Bears had their
twenty - first point, and that was
that.
It was a California victory — as
expected, but it was a very hollow
victory.
The close-to-capacity crowd had
expected an overwhelming display
of California power. Instead it saw
inspired Stanford power.
The crowd had expected Jensen,
Celeri. Dick Erickson, and George
Fong to run and pass the Bears to
a leisurely, lopsided win. Instead it
saw brilliant Indian performances
by game captain George Quist. by
quarterbacks Ainslie Bell and Don
Campbell, and by a Stanford line
that held tenaciously on defense and
opened gaping holes on offense—
performances that almost earned for
Stanford the biggest upset in half
a century of Big Games.
BEARS SCORE EARLY
While the late arrivals were still
looking for their seats, the Bears,
starting from their 36 - yard line
after receiving the opening kickolT,
marched 64 yards to their first
touchdown in six plays. When half
hack Ted Kenfickt broke through

over his own right tackle and
dashed the last 30 yards into pay
dirt, the game was only three and
a half minutes old.
Cullom added the extra point to
make the score 7 to 0, and the
crowd settled back to watch a
good old - fashioned, scientific
slaughter.
Then Stanford got its first offen
sive chance after Martin Anderson
returned the Bears' kick off to the
Indian 27. Marty tried the center of
the line with that beautiful and pre
viously successful fake pass and
handoff play from Ainslie Bell. He
didn't gain an inch. Bob Anderson
attempted to skirt right end on sec
ond down, but he too was held for
no gain. Bell passed incomplete on
third down. Three plyas with no
gain at alll.
It looked like the same feeble, in
effectual Indian offense that had
had its nose rubbed into the dirt by
every opponent Stanford had met
this season.
CARDS REVIVE
But just before the end of the first
quarter the Indians did a complete
about - face and began to move.
Starting from their on 32 after Quist
had lost three yards on a running
play, Bell whipped a long pass to
end Dan Mevin, good for 40 yards
and a first down on California's 28.
Quist hit right tackle for four. Dave
Field galloped around right end to
the 17, aided by a perfect block by
tackle Atherton Phleger, and Stan
ford had another first down as the
second quarter got under way.
- Quist was held for a two-yard
gain at right guard. Martin Ander
son lost one yard at right tackle.
Wayne Erickson made five yards to
the 11 around left end. Then, on
fourth down with four yards to go.
Bell shot a pinpoint pass to Wayne
Erickson, who made the catch in the
end zone behind the guarding of
Cal's Jim Muir.
Quist's conversion attempt was
wide, and the Bears still led, 7 to 6.
LONG DRIVE
They went further out in front
in the waning minutes of the first
half, on a sustained drive which
carried from the California 20. Fong
made the touchdown through right

| guard from the one-yard line. Cul-
I loin's conversion was good. Cali
| fornia, J 4 to 6.
In the third quarter, Stanford's
I surprisingly effective defense kept
! California completely bottled up in
in its own territory—stopping the

j Finally the te-rific pressure ap
plied by the Indians began to pay
off. Stanford took .ver after a Jen
sen punt on the Cafornia 36. Bell
passed to end Gene Martin for 1(5
yards and a first down on the 20.

KICK BLOCKED
Quist's conversion attempt was
| blocked. But Stanford had nar
rowed down the gap, 11 to 12.
What happened after that was ab
solutely unbelievable. Center Dick
Flatland recovered a California
fumble on Stanford's 34-yard line,
| and Stanford went all the way to its
I third touchdown in eight plays, cli
maxed by Don Campbell's over
the-center pass to Bob Anderson in
the end zone from 11 yards out.
Quist missed again on the extra
I point try, but nobody cared. Stan
| ford was actually ahead, 18 to 14.
And they stayed ahead for eight
1 glorious minutes, while the Indian
I rooting section, alumni, and well
! wishers went stark, raving mad
with joy.
' But it couldn't last. California
j would not be denied. The Bears
1 connected on that nightmare Jensen
! to Keekley pass minutes before the
j final gun, and that's the way it
I ended. California 21, Stanford 18.
The Indians lost the Big One as
: they had lost the eight others. But
|in losing they played one of the
i greatest games of football ever wit
i nessed in Stanford Stadium, or on
I any gridiron, for that matter.


WAYNE ERICKSON is about to catch Ainslee liell's pass on the goal
line to score Stanford's first touchdown in the second quarter of the Big

Game Saturday. The catch brought the score to 7-6. The Cal man
shown is Jim Muir, reserve quarterback.
