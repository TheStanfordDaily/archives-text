# Student Union Fund Plan Deserves Critical Study
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
Acting Student Manager H. B. "Jiggs" McCaulley sponsored a move
to begin a "new student union fund" at Excom Wednesday night.
It developed in this manner. McCaulley first announced that Memorial
Hull is now paid lor. Then he said the Board of Trustees have already
i idicated that they would consider putting the students' quarterly dollar

contribution to the Memorial Hall
debt into a "new student union fund."
One dollar of each student's tuition
ince the mid-1930's has gone into
the Memorial Hall fund.
He moved that Excom recommend
to the Board of Trustees that the
dollar be set aside for the new
Union Fund.
Tin re are many things hinging
on the recommendation that should
b- openly discussed before any of
ficial ASSU action is taken. But
both McCaulley and ASSU presi
dent Tom Mailzloff wanted the
recommendation approved at that
meeting; neither wanted to have
Excom study the recommendation.
So let's study it now.
PURPOSE CLEAR
First, there should be no doubt in
anyone's mind that in opening a
"new student union fund" the first
step towards the eventual erection of
the union is being taken.
If it is not a step toward a union,
we are just putting money into a
: iu h fund for no reason at all.
I! il is the first step why not con
sider it more carelully?
NEW PAVII-ION?
Do we want a new student union?
K: coin member Gus Chavalas said
Wednesday that he had heard many
students express an interest in hav
ing a new pavilion rather than a
new union.
Excom member Robert Hoyt asked
if any consideration had been given
an International House.
Martzloff intimated that the union
was favored by the students. He
referred to an informal poll taken
last year which was at best, hap
hazard.
QUESTIONS UNANSWERED
Some questions which were asked
McCaulley which he failed to an
swer indicated that he had given the
question little prior thought.
If your money is to go into a "new
student union tund" wouldn't you
be interested in knowing what type
of union was in nlind? Or how
much it would cost? Or when it
would be built?
The only semi-definite portion of

McCaulley's proposal, as stated by
himself, was an outline of a plan for
financing the new union.
FINANCING PLANNED
Briefly, he indirectly suggested
that the union could be financed by:
(1) the ''Mem Aud Dollar," (2)
Union profits, (3) ASSU surplus,
(4) interest from the fund, and (5)
donations.
Two of these five are logical, two
are highly questionable, and a fifth
is not in accord with university
policy.
The use of the Memorial Hall dol
lar is a good way of building up a
| "new student union fund." The
: interest from this fund should also
j be used although it is a relatively
minor source of revenue.
The ASSU surplus should not be
j used for financing a new student
union. It is questionable as to whe
' ther there should be any ASSU sur
j plus.
UNION PROFIT
The Union profit part in the fund
j also hedges on the border of "ques
| tionable finances." These will both
be investigated in later articles or
editorials.
The donations, however, bring up
another point. A point which either
Martzloff or McCaulley should know.
Last spring when a War Memorial
was being considered, a War Me
morial committee studied plans for
a new student union. It was agreed
that the financing of the project
through public soliciting would be
impractical considering other uni
! versity needs.
GIFTS NEEDED
But yet McCaulley intimated to
Excom that a substantial portion
of the money needed to build a
new union would be gotten through
gifts.
If this was impractical last spring
why is it practical now?
Conclusion: Any proposal which
would tie up students' money for
years to come should be examined
critically from all angles. The "new
student union fund" is such a pro
posal.
