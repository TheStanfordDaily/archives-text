# Trustees Agree On Board Raise
## 
### 
An increase of $15 a quarter in
board rates has been approved by
the Board of Trustees, Business
Manager All' E. Brandin announced
yesterday. The new rates, effective
Jan. 1, will be $150 a quarter in
campus dining halls instead of $135,
and $140 a quarter instead of $125
at (he Village.
Skyrocketing food prices were
(he cause of the action, Brandin
said.
'"Our dining hall operations for
this quarter will show a loss. Dur
ing the past 17 months, while food
costs have spiraled upward, board
rates have continued the same. The
last increase in board rates was
made in June of 194(!," he said. "The
proposal to increase the Univer
sity's board rates was considered by
the board before the start of -faH
quarter, but was rejected at that
time in the hope food costs would
be stabilized, but they have contin
ued to go higher."
