# Writers Praise Indians' Spirit

"Indians 10-1 Underdogs" laughed the city papers Saturday morning,
i Stanford plus 26 points read the dope sheets. The worst football season
I for many, many years groaned old grads as they thought of eight straight
! losses.
Yet when the Stanford Band struck up the Hymn at the close of the
50th Big Game, 85,000 spectators knew they had seen one of the greatest
Stanford teams of all time—the 10 to 1 underdogs who had outplayed Cali
fornia's Golden Bears for 53 out of 60 minutes. Sportswriters dipped deep
into Webster to describe the "fight, fire, force, flair, and flamboyance"
of the Indians.
Said Bill Lciscr in the Chronicle, " . . . . this incredible Stanford
team which has been weakened by the most incredible series of injuries
on and o(T the football field on record . . . will go down on the books as
one of the most successful ever produced on the Farm."
"Man, how those Indians have improved. With any luck they'd have
won. The touchdown that swell end, Mervin, just missed, for instance."
"A wild punch, thrown with the desperation of a beaten fighter rising
grogily from the ring floor, averted the Big Game's all-time greatest up
! set here today," wrote Examiner's Prescott Sullivan.
In the same paper Harry Borba said, "California's celebrated Golden
Bear varsity discovered this afternoon that it is very uncomfortable trying
to sleep on press clippings . . . This was a changed, composed, cocksure
Indian with an offensive wallop and daring."
Art Rosenbaum wrote in the Chronicle: "A lot of pie-game statements
came marching, ghostlike, back into memory today—as Jackie Jensen's

remark that 'We don't care how much we score on those guys!' "
They all quoted Marchie, too. One said: "Here's my quote of the
week . . . 'This is the greatest team to ever represent the University.' "
And this: " 'If you could have seen the big bonfire rally the kids put on
for the team here Thursday night you would understand what made these
boys play inspired ball.'"
Plaudits were also handed to the Stanford rooting section. Said John
Allen in the Examiner: "What 85,000 people saw here today made fools
of the experts and left a Stanford rooting section calling vociferously for
a coach whose team had lost nine in a row ... A bunch of California
boys rushed out to tear down the red and white wrapped goal posts. Maybe
they had it coming."
In the Chronicle: "Even the Stanford cheering section, outnumbered
considerably, was a good match for the Cal'side of the house. Bear l oot
ers make lots of noise, but they were most 'eloquent' in the middle of the
fourth quarter when Stanford was leading by 18-14. Such silence from
15,000 fear-stricken throats! You could have heard a child munching
popcorn out of the new noiseless plastic bag, it was that hushed."
"A Stanford card stunt asked rather plaintively 'leave our seats alone
The reference was to a California habit of tearing up seat , in the glee of a
winning game. All but one row of Stanford seats remained in place after
yesterday's game."
California's Coach "Pappy" Waldorf said what everyone knew when
the game ended: ". . . those Stanford underdogs . . . deserved to win this
ball game."

considerably, was a good match for the Cal'side of the house. Bear l oot
ers make lots of noise, but they were most 'eloquent' in the middle of the
fourth quarter when Stanford was leading by 18-14. Such silence from
15,000 fear-stricken throats! You could have heard a child munching
popcorn out of the new noiseless plastic bag, it was that hushed."
"A Stanford card stunt asked rather plaintively 'leave our seats alone
The reference was to a California habit of tearing up seat , in the glee of a
winning game. All but one row of Stanford seats remained in place after
yesterday's game."
California's Coach "Pappy" Waldorf said what everyone knew when
the game ended: ". . . those Stanford underdogs . . . deserved to win this
ball game."
"Indians 10-1 Underdogs" laughed the city papers Saturday morning,
i Stanford plus 26 points read the dope sheets. The worst football season
I for many, many years groaned old grads as they thought of eight straight
! losses.
Yet when the Stanford Band struck up the Hymn at the close of the
50th Big Game, 85,000 spectators knew they had seen one of the greatest
Stanford teams of all time—the 10 to 1 underdogs who had outplayed Cali
fornia's Golden Bears for 53 out of 60 minutes. Sportswriters dipped deep
into Webster to describe the "fight, fire, force, flair, and flamboyance"
of the Indians.
Said Bill Lciscr in the Chronicle, " . . . . this incredible Stanford
team which has been weakened by the most incredible series of injuries
on and o(T the football field on record . . . will go down on the books as
one of the most successful ever produced on the Farm."
"Man, how those Indians have improved. With any luck they'd have
won. The touchdown that swell end, Mervin, just missed, for instance."
"A wild punch, thrown with the desperation of a beaten fighter rising
grogily from the ring floor, averted the Big Game's all-time greatest up
! set here today," wrote Examiner's Prescott Sullivan.
In the same paper Harry Borba said, "California's celebrated Golden
Bear varsity discovered this afternoon that it is very uncomfortable trying
to sleep on press clippings . . . This was a changed, composed, cocksure
Indian with an offensive wallop and daring."
Art Rosenbaum wrote in the Chronicle: "A lot of pie-game statements
came marching, ghostlike, back into memory today—as Jackie Jensen's

remark that 'We don't care how much we score on those guys!' "
They all quoted Marchie, too. One said: "Here's my quote of the
week . . . 'This is the greatest team to ever represent the University.' "
And this: " 'If you could have seen the big bonfire rally the kids put on
for the team here Thursday night you would understand what made these
boys play inspired ball.'"
Plaudits were also handed to the Stanford rooting section. Said John
Allen in the Examiner: "What 85,000 people saw here today made fools
of the experts and left a Stanford rooting section calling vociferously for
a coach whose team had lost nine in a row ... A bunch of California
boys rushed out to tear down the red and white wrapped goal posts. Maybe
they had it coming."
In the Chronicle: "Even the Stanford cheering section, outnumbered
considerably, was a good match for the Cal'side of the house. Bear l oot
