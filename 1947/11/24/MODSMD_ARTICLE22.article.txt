The work of Aristide Maillol, not
ed French sculptor, will be dis
played in a sound movie today at
4:15 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
The film, sponsored by the art de
partment, will be shown to the pub
lic without charge.
The most notable quality of Mail
lol's sculpture, according to critics,
is its serene beauty. He strives to
ward the classical rather than the
modern ideals of sculpture.
