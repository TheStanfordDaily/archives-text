# Airplanes 'Raid' Cal
## 
### 
University of California students
craned their necks skyward Friday
noon as three low - flying planes
showered 50,000 leaflets in the Sa
ther Gate area and around the
Campanile, while a fourth smoke
writing plane fought unfavorable
winds and a hazy sky to spell out
"Down with Cal; Stanford Hail!"
The three leaflet-dropping planes,
flying as low as 500 feet above
the campus, throttled their motors.
Then, as thousands of Cal students
were coming from their classes, the
"bombardiers" began discharging
their leaflets, which read:
"California Bear thought him had
career,
Until got Injun arrow inum royal
rear.
DROP DEAD, CAL!"
"It took us 15 minutes to throw
the leaflets on the campus," Lorry
Lokcy, one of the pilots, said. "Af
ter we left Berkeley we headed for
San Francisco, where we dropped a
couple of thousand over the city."
The leaflets, originated by Allen
Bletz, Lokey. and Gordon Ness,
were financed by the class of '51 and
various living groups on campus.
The smoke-writing stunt, planned
by Tom August and Jay Hughes
and sponsored solely by the class of
*51, was originally planned as a sep
arate attack. Wednesday, however,
the two groups decided to join
forces for the airborne invasion of
Cal.
"Since the raid wasn't malicious
in character, we don't believe it vio
lates the anti - raiding agreement
between Stanford and Cal," Gordon
Ness, bombardier, added.
