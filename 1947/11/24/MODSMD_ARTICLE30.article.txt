# Card Soccerites Shut Out Cal; Bears' Loss Is First of Year
## 
### 
Showing a complete disregard for
past records arid performances, the
Stanford soccer team downed a
hitherto undefeated California ag
gregation by a 3 to 0 count here
Saturday.
The Cal men. boasting a record of
23 wins, one loss, and four ties in
two years of play, invaded the Farm
expecting little trouble from an In
dian outfit that had lost two and
tied one game thus far in the sea
son.
But the Card soccerites put to
gether their good showings into one
contest and, true to the prediction
of Coach Dave Tappan, completely
outplayed the visiting Bears.
HODGE SCORES
Before the game was five minutes
old, Indian center forward Stan
Hodge had heeled a tally by the de
fending Cal goalie for the first Stan
ford score.
Late in the last half, the Stan
fordites were awarded a penalty
kick to the right of the Bear goal.
Ricardo Trejos kicked to Gaul
staun who passed to Hodge. Hodge
headed one into the net fo his sec
ond marker of the game and Stan
ford led, 2 to 0.
In the second half, the Cal men
came back, but brilliant defensive
play by Pat McDonnell and God
frey Gregg, Card fullbacks, saved
the day time and again for the In
dian shinkickers.
LAST TALLY
Seventeen minutes into the final
quarter, the Cards scored their last

point of the tilt when right outside
forward Jery Taylor, after having
one try blocked by the goalie, fol
lowed it up and slammed the ball
into the net from about four yards
out for the final tally.
Tappan had nothing but praise for
his charges and when asked to men
tion who he thought looked good,
said, "They all looked good. I knew
these fellows had it in them to beat
Cal and they more than proved it
today."
Perhaps the best remark of the
1 after - game congratulations was
spoken by the California goalie.
Said he,"I don't see how you guys
lost to those other teams."
The contest was the last on the
Indians' schedule, but top kick Tap
pan has said that there might be
several more post-season contests
if opponents can be found.

teammates is PAT IMcDONNELL, one of Stanford's rugged fullbacks,

lowed it up and slammed the ball
into the net from about four yards
out for the final tally.
Tappan had nothing but praise for
his charges and when asked to men
tion who he thought looked good,
said, "They all looked good. I knew
these fellows had it in them to beat
Cal and they more than proved it
today."
Perhaps the best remark of the
1 after - game congratulations was
spoken by the California goalie.
Said he,"I don't see how you guys
lost to those other teams."
The contest was the last on the
Indians' schedule, but top kick Tap
pan has said that there might be
several more post-season contests
if opponents can be found.

Showing a complete disregard for
past records arid performances, the
Stanford soccer team downed a
hitherto undefeated California ag
gregation by a 3 to 0 count here
Saturday.
The Cal men. boasting a record of
23 wins, one loss, and four ties in
two years of play, invaded the Farm
expecting little trouble from an In
dian outfit that had lost two and
tied one game thus far in the sea
son.
But the Card soccerites put to
gether their good showings into one
contest and, true to the prediction
of Coach Dave Tappan, completely
outplayed the visiting Bears.
HODGE SCORES
Before the game was five minutes
old, Indian center forward Stan
Hodge had heeled a tally by the de
fending Cal goalie for the first Stan
ford score.
Late in the last half, the Stan
fordites were awarded a penalty
kick to the right of the Bear goal.
Ricardo Trejos kicked to Gaul
staun who passed to Hodge. Hodge
headed one into the net fo his sec
ond marker of the game and Stan
ford led, 2 to 0.
In the second half, the Cal men
came back, but brilliant defensive
play by Pat McDonnell and God
frey Gregg, Card fullbacks, saved
the day time and again for the In
dian shinkickers.
LAST TALLY
Seventeen minutes into the final
quarter, the Cards scored their last

point of the tilt when right outside
forward Jery Taylor, after having
one try blocked by the goalie, fol
lowed it up and slammed the ball
into the net from about four yards
out for the final tally.
