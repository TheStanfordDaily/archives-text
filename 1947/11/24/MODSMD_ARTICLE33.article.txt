# 'Stanford Deserved To Win'—Waldorf
## 
### GEORGE NEWELL 
White-haired Pappy Waldorf was
leaning against the wall in the Cal
dressing room with a smile of relief
on his face.
"Oh, Lord," he said, "I feel like
I've been dragged through a wring
er." He was talking to newsmen as
he mopped his forehead. "You think
players need a shower after a game
! —I'm wringing wet!"
Pappy wavd his hands in the air
las he talked of Stanford. "That
I Quist —he was magnificent . . . the
| Stanford team deserved victory
i without a doubt!"
Over in the Stanford dressing
room the Indians sat on the wooden
benches hardly moving.
Alumni, ex-Stanford players, and
students walked quietly around the
room patting ball players on the
back. There were some angry tears
of frustration but most of the team
just sat expressionless. They had
played the greatest game of their
I lives and lost.
They just shook their heads in
j disbelief.
Most of them said nothing.
