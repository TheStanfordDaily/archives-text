# Varsity Hoopmen Open Against Alumni Tonight
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Cage fans will get their first look at Stanford's 1947-48 bas
ketball team tonight when the Indians meet a Farm alumni ag
gregation in the Pavilion at 8 p.m.
The varsity game will follow a preliminary game between the
Farm frosh and the reserves, beginning at 6:15.

Four first string players are back
from last year's squad which took
third place in the southern division
of the Coast Conference.
For the fifth starting spot, left
vacant by Dick Berlin's decision not
to play ball this year, Dean has three
standout candidates. They are Bob
Lewis, letterman from last year,
George Yardley, standout on last
year's B team, and Bill Rose, a minor
sensation at Menlo J.C. last season.
One of these three will pair with
the sharp-shooting Thompson at fur
ward. Stephenson, the tall hook
shot artist, will start at center, and
Davidson and Higgins, both ag
gressive ball-hawks and good shots,
will hold down the guard spots. Hig
gins was nominally a forward last
season, but he played much of the
time at guard—so the position will
not be new to him.
ALUMNI SQUAD STRONG
The alumni have a host of big
names on their pickup squad. Ex
pected to start are Jack Dana, Stan
ford frosh coach, and Don Williams,
late of the Oakland Bittners, at for
ward; Don Burness, who also played
for the Bittners at center; and Bill
Cowden and John Alltucker at
guard. All these men played on the
great Stanford teams of the early
'40's.
Backing them up will be such
players as H. B. Lee and Bob Bur
nett, diminutive guards of a decade
ago, and such more recent graduates
as big Dick Taylor, Fred Oliver,
Fred Linari, and John Eikelman.
As always with alumni teams, the
starting lineup and squad list are
subject to change without notice.
LLISETTI MAY SUIT UP
The great Hank Luisetti, Stan
ford's all-time Ail-American eager,
will probably be on hand to suit up
for the game, but chances are that
he won't play. Hank has been out
of competition for some time after
leading Stanford to three conference
championships in 1935-36-37, and
starring with outfits like the Olym
pic Club, Phillips Oilers, and St.
Mary's Pre-Flight.
Stanford should be strong on re
serve strength this year. Behind
the starting forwards are Milt Iver
son and Bill Drehobl, both of whom
have varsity experience. Backing
up Stephenson are Bob Penn, who
played with some of the alumni team
members in 1942, and Ralph Carver,
up from the B team.
Gus Chavalas, a hustler who
played a lot of ball last season, and
Jack Scharfen, who starred in the
San Francisco prep league a few
years back and has impressed in
practice scrimmages, will spell off
Davidson and Higgins.

'40's.
Backing them up will be such
players as H. B. Lee and Bob Bur
nett, diminutive guards of a decade
ago, and such more recent graduates
as big Dick Taylor, Fred Oliver,
Fred Linari, and John Eikelman.
As always with alumni teams, the
starting lineup and squad list are
subject to change without notice.
LLISETTI MAY SUIT UP
The great Hank Luisetti, Stan
ford's all-time Ail-American eager,
will probably be on hand to suit up
for the game, but chances are that
he won't play. Hank has been out
of competition for some time after
leading Stanford to three conference
championships in 1935-36-37, and
starring with outfits like the Olym
pic Club, Phillips Oilers, and St.
Mary's Pre-Flight.
Stanford should be strong on re
serve strength this year. Behind
the starting forwards are Milt Iver
son and Bill Drehobl, both of whom
have varsity experience. Backing
up Stephenson are Bob Penn, who
played with some of the alumni team
members in 1942, and Ralph Carver,
up from the B team.
Gus Chavalas, a hustler who
played a lot of ball last season, and
Jack Scharfen, who starred in the
San Francisco prep league a few
years back and has impressed in
practice scrimmages, will spell off
Davidson and Higgins.
Cage fans will get their first look at Stanford's 1947-48 bas
ketball team tonight when the Indians meet a Farm alumni ag
gregation in the Pavilion at 8 p.m.
The varsity game will follow a preliminary game between the
Farm frosh and the reserves, beginning at 6:15.

Four first string players are back
from last year's squad which took
third place in the southern division
of the Coast Conference.
For the fifth starting spot, left
vacant by Dick Berlin's decision not
to play ball this year, Dean has three
standout candidates. They are Bob
Lewis, letterman from last year,
George Yardley, standout on last
year's B team, and Bill Rose, a minor
sensation at Menlo J.C. last season.
One of these three will pair with
the sharp-shooting Thompson at fur
ward. Stephenson, the tall hook
shot artist, will start at center, and
Davidson and Higgins, both ag
gressive ball-hawks and good shots,
will hold down the guard spots. Hig
gins was nominally a forward last
season, but he played much of the
time at guard—so the position will
not be new to him.
ALUMNI SQUAD STRONG
The alumni have a host of big
names on their pickup squad. Ex
pected to start are Jack Dana, Stan
ford frosh coach, and Don Williams,
late of the Oakland Bittners, at for
ward; Don Burness, who also played
for the Bittners at center; and Bill
Cowden and John Alltucker at
guard. All these men played on the
great Stanford teams of the early
'40's.
