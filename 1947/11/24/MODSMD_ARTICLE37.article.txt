### 
Stanford's junior varsity gridders
i almost set the theme for their big
| brothers Saturday moning as they
J won a thrilling 32 to 27 victory over
j the highly favored California Ram
blers in the Farm Stadium.
With two minutes left in the final
quater and Cal leading 27 to 26,
the JV's climaxed an 81-yard march
sending Van Johns around end for
a touchdown.
LAST MINUTE SUSPENSE
The game then assumed the sus
! pense that the Big Game to follow
was to have. The Indians kicked off
i and Stanton Webster received the
i ball on his own 20. He shook off
j tackier after tackier as he sped up
| the field. As he broke into the clear
J on the 36, the last Stanford man,
i Van Johns, tripped him ud.
Two plays later Webster swept
I around right end for 32 yards to the
I Indian 30. The clock read 36 sec
onds to go as the junior Bears hud
dled. On the first play Don Brown,
Rambler quarterback, heaved a long
pass into the end zone incomplete.
Three plays later he flipped again

and this time Webster got into the
clear over the goal but he dropped
the sure touchdown pass. That end
ed the threat and the Indians took
over the ball on their own 20 as the
gun sounded.
JV'S OUTPLAY RAMBLERS
The closeness of the score does
not indicate the picture of the game.
The Stanford juniors kept their un
defeated record intact by clearly
outplaying the overconfident Ram
blers.
The other decisive Indian score

came after three minutes in the
third quater. Lipelt ran the Cal
kickoff back to the Cal 47 and from
there the Cards rolled to the Hum
bler goal in eight plays. A pass
from Ron James and a beautiful
falling catch by end Hal Walker in
the end /one climaxed the drive.
Don Lipelt was just one of the
many standouts for the Jayvees
Saturday as the Ramblers went
down to defeat.
