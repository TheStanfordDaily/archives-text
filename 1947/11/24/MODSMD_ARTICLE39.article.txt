# Who's Got the Spirit?
## 
### 
"Who's got the Axe, who's got the Axe?"
jeered jubilant California rooters at the end of
Saturday's game.
"Who's got the spirit?" was the hoarse reply
that came from the tired but happy Stanford
stands.
The biggest and rowdiest rooting section in
the world couldn't answer that one.
The gold-and-blue capped men and women
on the field stared in amazement as the coach
who hadn't won a game all year was boosted up
in front of the rooting section—to be told by the
expressions on the faces in front of him that
they thought he was a great football coach and
a great guy.
"Over at Berkeley, we want our coaches to
get results," someone said.
"We're proud of Marchie; he didn't let us

down," said a fellow who had yelled himself
half silly since 2 o'clock.
Outside the locker room, a UC girl asked:
"Why do you stand out here, waiting to see a
team that lost even to little Idaho?"
Why? Because they're our team, because
they put every last bit of energy and thought
into playing good football, hard football, hon
est football. Because they went into every
game, even against the Rose Bowl team, with
the determination to win.
From Carmel to Marin, Stanford students
were celebrating the end of another football
season Saturday night. If it had been a season
of nine straight victories and a trip to the Rose
Bowl, we couldn't have been any prouder of
our team and our coach.—J.T.
