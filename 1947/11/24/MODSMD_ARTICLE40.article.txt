# Three $40,000 Questions

Do you like to read about campus financial
matters?
Last week when Tom Martzloff and H. B.
McCaulley suggested that a "new student union
fund" be started they said the Union Board of
Governors had already voted to put the year's
profits into such a fund.
The Union board is an administration-stu
dent group. Martzloff, McCaulley, and Dick
Bartle are the student representatives.
McCaulley estimated this year's Union profit
as $40,000.
At first hearing one would say "that's a fine
gesture on the part of the Union board." But
give it some thought. Particularly on three
major questions:
(1) From where does this money come?
(2) How does the Union BoSlrd of Governors
happen to control such a large sum of money?
(3) Where would the money go if it were
not placed in a "new student union fund"?
In answer to number Iâ€”For a long time the
Union has been making large profits. For some
reason each male student contributes $1 out of
his tuition to the Union, accounting for a good
percentage of that profit. Actually this dollar is
a hidden assessment for whatever the Board
decides to do with its profits.
Question 2 is an interesting one. Previously,
the board gave a large percentage of the Union

profits to the ASSU to aid in paying for Me
morial Hall. This year Memorial Hall is paid for.
The board suddenly finds itself with $40,000
on its hands with no precedent to tell them
where to spend it.
Any group with $40,000 to spend in one direc
tion can easily become the biggest pressure
group on campus.
Question 3 is an intriguing one. An Excom
member asked Martzloff and McCaulley that
question at Excom Wednesday night. Neither
had an answer.
The question is a little embarrassing to the
Board. There aren't many groups on campus
with $40,000 to spend.
No matter how carefully worded editorials
are, certain individuals will always take them
to be personal insults. This editorial is not
aimed at any individual or any group of indi
viduals. It merely is attempting to criticize a
system which allows a group to control large
sums of money with no strings attached other
than those of common sense.
The three questions above were written with
the intention of creating a little interest in the
financial story of the Union Board of Governors.
Give them a little thought when you pay 30
cents for your milkshake tomorrow afternoon.
Keep them in mind when you read next
week's editorial on the Board.
