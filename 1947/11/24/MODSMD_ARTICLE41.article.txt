# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
This is something that belongs in Fables of the
Farm in the Chaparral. But it's too good to wait, so
we'll print it here, and let Chappie steal it along with
the rest of their stuff for next issue.
A friend of mine, a happy-go-lucky character who
is minus 15, will do anything for a laugh.
So we're sitting in the Reserve Book Room, and
he says:
"Say, want to see me make a girl get up and leave
the library?"
"Sounds like a good stunt," I says, playing along
with the gag, "do you know this girl?"
"Hell no," he says, "Matter of fact I won't even
speak to her face to face."
"All right,'' says I, "go ahead, which girl is it?"
"Well," he says, "she just left her seat a minute ago,
but she's coming back."
So my punchy friend meanders over to her desk,
and leaves a note which he had previously written.
We sat and waited and soon the girl comes back
and sits down. She's a queen, with a figure that was
built on a plan laid down by Navy specifications. She
looked as though she were poured into her dress and
someone forgot to say when.
She sees the note, reads it, and looks hastily around
the room. We pretend to be reading but watch her
carefully out of the corner of our eyes. She reads, then
looks around. Reads a couple more lines and looks
around. Finally she packs up her books and walks
out.
"That's pretty good" I says, "What did you write
her?"
The note that he wrote went something like this:
"A friend and myself have been watching you.
Perhaps you think we are extremely rude, but we
cannot help but admire your beautiful body. We have

been from coast to coast and have yet to see a chasis
so well constructed—built from the ground up, and
made to last.
"You'll forgive us if we just sit here looking and
admiring."
The poor girl finally gave way under the pressure,
and left, it's a good gag if your mind is sufficiently
warped, and at all ends a cute story.
It reminds me of an old newspaperman who was
working the night side. He was mad at the whole
world because he was forced to stay awake while the
rest of the population was sleeping. His favorite
joke was to dig amongst the files until he found some
innocent married couple. Then he would phone their
house about three in the morning. In most cases the
husband, being the gallant soul that he is. would get
up to answer the phone. The newspaperman, in a
drunken dialect, and addressing the man's wife by
first name, would say:
"Hello, hello — ish Margie there?"
The husband more than likely would reply:
"Yes, she is here. Who is this calling, please?"
The old Nightsider would answer:
"Thish ish Private Firsht Class Jones. I saw Mar
gie's name on the men's room wall at the train shtation,
but you ain't Margie. I guesh I got the wrong num
ber."
Then he would hang up, and let the husband go
back to bed to listen to his wife's futile explanations.
"We break up more happy homes that way," he
would laugh.
Seems to me there ought to be a defense against
that sort of thing embodied somewhere in the Bill of
Rights or the Four Freedoms.
How can you live a happy life with forces like these
working against you?
