# CAMPUS OPINION
## Strengthening the Honor Code 
### 
To the Editor:
The following was submitted to Excom Wednes
day night:
"The Honor Code Standing Committee recom
mends that a student wishing to take an examination
outside of the assigned room first secure the consent
of the instructor."
The Honor Code Committee's purpose was not to
revi.se the Code, undermine its spirit, or weaken it in
any way. We thought that we were suggesting an
administrative procedure that would strengthen the
workings of the Code.
I believi that we were wrong. I first became con
vinced of this after our recommendation was printed

and after I had a chance to sample campus opinion.
The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students and
it can succeed only with the strong and whole-hearted
support of every member of the student body. The
student body was not behind our proposal and there
fore it was faulty. Also, I became convinced that our
suggestion would violate the spirit of the Code and be
harmful to it,
For these reasons, I read the committee's recom
mendation to Excom and then personally reneged,
suggesting that Excom reject the motion.
Excom and the student body have shown their
faith in Stanford's Honor Code by refusing to com
promise it in any way.
