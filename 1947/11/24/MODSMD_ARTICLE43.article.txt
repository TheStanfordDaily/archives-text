## 
### FRANK SARLES 
On Saturday night, Sept. 4, 1915, the Stanford Swimming Club
gave an all-campus dance to celebrate the opening of the recently
completed Encina Gymnasium. One hundred couples attended
but, according to the Daily Palo Alto, "despite the large crowd,
there was plenty of room for everyone" in the building. Farm

enrollment at that time was 2054. ♦
The $100,000 structure, complete
with swimming pool and 1200 lock
ers, filled an urgent need of the
growing University. It was the
third men's gym built on campus.
The first was a wooden building ;
in the field behind Encina. It was j
built immediately after the Univer- 1
sity opened in 1891, and served the
needs of the small student body :
well.
$500,000 GYM
By 1905, enrollment had increased
to greatly that the need for a larger i
gymnasium became manifest. Con- j
struction was begun on a huge and !
elaborate building north of the j
present Frost Memorial Amphithe
ater. This impressive $500,000 j
gymnasium, which resembled noth- j
ing so much as the national capitol |
building, was almost completed on j
April 18, 1906, when the "greatest
earthquake of modern times" I
brought terror and destruction to
the entire Peninsula. The gym it- ■
self was damaged beyond repair, j
and the students were forced to i
continue using the old Encina Gym ■
until 1915.
The present capacity of the gym is
3,000 lockers, including those of '
the team rooms, according to Jake
Irwin, manager of the gym store.
In view of the predominantly male
post-war influx, a policy of doub
ling-up some lockers became nec
essary in 194G.
PERSONNEL LISTED
Personnel of the building include
three storekeepers and a general
maintenance man. Five coaches j
also maintain offices in the gym.
Jake Irwin, present manager of the
store, is a 1926 Farm graduate and
has been connected with the gym i
since 1939. Bill Phillips, who joined
the staff in 1926, is assistant store
manager, and Woody Slater is the j
third worker. A 1 Moffitt is the gen- j
eral maintenance man.
Coaches who maintain offices in j
the Encina Gym are: Elwyn Bugge, !
tennis and fencing; Ray Lunney. I
boxing; Tom Haynie and Myron
Sprague, swimming; and D. Conrad
Jarvis, trainer. Other coaches have '
offices in the BAC building.
Facilities of the gym are open to I
faculty, students with student body j
cards, and student without student |
body cards (upon payment of a
special fee of $3.50), said Irwin.
Any of the above persons may check
out equipment from the equipment
room between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on I
weekdays.

On Saturday night, Sept. 4, 1915, the Stanford Swimming Club
gave an all-campus dance to celebrate the opening of the recently
completed Encina Gymnasium. One hundred couples attended
but, according to the Daily Palo Alto, "despite the large crowd,
there was plenty of room for everyone" in the building. Farm

enrollment at that time was 2054. ♦
The $100,000 structure, complete
with swimming pool and 1200 lock
ers, filled an urgent need of the
growing University. It was the
third men's gym built on campus.
The first was a wooden building ;
in the field behind Encina. It was j
built immediately after the Univer- 1
sity opened in 1891, and served the
needs of the small student body :
well.
$500,000 GYM
By 1905, enrollment had increased
to greatly that the need for a larger i
gymnasium became manifest. Con- j
struction was begun on a huge and !
elaborate building north of the j
present Frost Memorial Amphithe
ater. This impressive $500,000 j
gymnasium, which resembled noth- j
ing so much as the national capitol |
building, was almost completed on j
April 18, 1906, when the "greatest
earthquake of modern times" I
brought terror and destruction to
the entire Peninsula. The gym it- ■
self was damaged beyond repair, j
and the students were forced to i
continue using the old Encina Gym ■
until 1915.
The present capacity of the gym is
3,000 lockers, including those of '
the team rooms, according to Jake
Irwin, manager of the gym store.
