# Women's Clothing Set by Tradition
## 
### 
Women are reminded not to wear
jeans, shorts, or pedal pushers on
Quad or below the post office, said
Phyllis Sutherland, president of
Women's Conference, at the confer
ence meeting Thursday.
If a woman must wear them past
the post office, going on a field trip
or to a lab, she should wear a long
coat over them, Miss Sutherland
explained. This is not a set rule but
has long been the policy of Stanford
women.
The conference also discussed
scholarship lists and a leadership
booklet to explain the conference's
leadership program.
