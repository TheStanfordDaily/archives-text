### 
LONDON, Nov. 2:5 (UP).—West
ern Allied leaders have determined
to keep on seeking agreement with
Russia on Germany's future even if
the Big Four Foreign Ministers'
Conference fails, responsible sources
said tonight as Soviet Foreign Min
ister Viacheslav Molotov arrived for
Tuesday's opening meeting
The conference is to take up:
1. Economic principles and the
level of German postwar economy.
This is the core of German prob
lems. There is no sign the Russians
will abandon their demand for $10,-
000,000 in reparations and for a
j voice in control of the industrial
j Ruhr.
2. Form and scope of a provision
lal political organization for Ger
many. Russia wants a strong cen
j tral government. France wants vir
tually no central government at all.
The United States and Great Britain
want a federal setup like that in
America.
3. United States draft disarma
ment and demilitarization treaty for
Germany. Russia does not even
want this question put on the pro
gram. Britain and France will sup
port it—probably without much en
thusiasm.
4. Report of the Allied Control
Council for Germany. This would
include such things as progress on
denazification, democratization, and
return of prisoners of war.
5. Germany's frontiers. This rais
es the delicate Geman-Polish fron
tier question. The United States
wants Germany to have some of the
land turned over to Poland two
years ago.
6. Procedure for preparation of a
i German treaty. This involves the
detailed complications of a future
peace conference.
7. Treaty for Austria. Disagree
ment over what alleged German as
sets in Austria will be used as rep
arations is the chief sticking point.
Russia seeks about everything that
Germany grabbed from Austria by
the Nazis, calling it "German" prop
erty.
