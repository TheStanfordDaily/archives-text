# Vandenberg Urges Senate To Approve $597,000,000 European Relief Program
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (UP). —Calling for immediate passage
of the $597,000,000 European emergency aid program, Senate
President Arthur H. Vandenberg, R., Mich., said today that "Com
munist aggression is on the march" and must be halted by
American economic might to prevent another world war.
In a challenging speech that went even beyond administration

leaders in stressing the urgency of
unstinted help to Europe, the GOP
foreign policy spokesman warned
his Senate colleagues that continu
ing world peace may rest upon their
decision.
He admitted frankly that great
risks are involved in both the in
terim aid program and the long
range $20,000,000,000 Marshall Re
covery Plan, and that a single mis
calculation by any of the big pow
ers "might light the guns again."
POSTPONE ULTIMATE CONFLICT
But, he said, if Congress rejects
those risks and withholds American
help it "may only postpone an ulti
mate conflict which otherwise need
never occur and which should never
be allowed to occur."
Vandenberg endorsed both the
$597,000,000 emergency program and
the broad principles of the Marshall
Plan, which Congress will take up
later. But, in an apparent conces
sion to the objections of some Re
publicans, he emphasized that any
Senator could vote for the emer
gency bill without committing him
self to support the Marshall Plan.
FINE-TOOTII COMBING
, Senate passage of the emergency
measure without serious opposition
was expected by Wednesday, but it
appeared to be in for a fine-tooth
combing by the Senate Appropria
tions Committee, which must okay
the actual appropriation.
: Chairman Styles Bridges, R.,
N.H., of the Appropriations Com
mittee, accused President Truman
of infringing upon the powers of
Congress by asking for rationing
and price control authority along
with a "blank check" fo interim aid
to France, Italy, and Austria.
COMMITTEE GOES TO WORK
: His committee went to work com
piling an inventory of American
grain supplies and crop prospects to
insure that exports to needy peo
ples abroad will not injure this
[country's domestic economy.
• The House Foreign Affairs Com
'mittec, meanwhile, plowed ahead
jwith the writing of its own version
.'of the $597,000,000 aid bill. Mem
jbers hoped they could complete the
ijob by Wednesday evening.
| The House body reportedly was
split over two main points: how to
tie the emergency program into the
Marshall Plan, and how to admin
ister local currencies which each
recipient country will pay for goods
received from the United States.
