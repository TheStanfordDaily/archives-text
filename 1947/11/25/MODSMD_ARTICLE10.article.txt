# U.S. to Ask Big Four to Settle Austrian Pact
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 24 (UP).—Secre
tary of State George C. Marshall
will demand that the Big Four For
eign Ministers, at their critical
meeting which opens tomorrow,
concentrate on writing an Austrian
treaty and agree on questions of
principle regarding Germany, re
sponsible informants said tonight.
To this end, it was said, Marshall
is prepared to sidetrack for the
present the United States proposal
for a four-year pact to enforce Ger- I
man disarmament.
MEET NEAR ELIZABETH'S HOME
The Big Four meet tomorrow in i
Lancaster House, across the street i
from the future home of Princess
Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, at a time when the
break between East and West is
nearly complete and the Russian
press and radio are pouring out an
incessant stream of anti-American
abuse.
Nevertheless, it was said authori- i
tatively, Marshall has determined to
do his best and will flatly oppose j
all suggestions for a separate peace
with Germany even if the confer- \
ence breaks up in failure.
CLAY AGREES WITH MARSHALL
General Lucius D. Clay, Ameri
can commander-in-chief in Ger
many, agrees with Marshall and
likewise opposes any policy which
might cause a break in continued
diplomatic talks with Russia over
the German problem.
Both Marshall and British For- j
eign Secretary Ernest Bevin are be
lieved ready to give Russian For
eign Minister Viacheslav Molotov
tacit assurance that there will be no j
Anglo - American - French separate j
peace with western Germany if this I
conference fails.
GERMANY'S ECONOMY
Marshall regards agreement on .
German economic principles, in
cluding reparations and the future
level of industrial production, as I
the number one problem.
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault
of France arrived today to join his
colleagues.
Marshall, Bidault, and Molotov
paid courtesy calls on Bevin to dis
cuss arrangements for tomorrow's
session while their hundreds of
aides prepared their documents for
the arguments which will follow.
TO SPEND WEEK ON PROGRAM
The Big Four were expected to
spend most of this week deciding [
on their program. Even this cle- ;
mental subject probably will cause j
bitter disputes between Molotov j
and other delegates.
"By next week," an American in
formant said, "we should know
whether this will be a very short
or a very long meeting" — whether]
disagreement with Russia will prove j
insurmountable, at this time, or
whether there will be weeks of j
bickering exchanges with some j
hope of progress at the end.
