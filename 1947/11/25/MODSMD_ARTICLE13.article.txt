## Fisher Sees 'Cold War' Between U.S., Soviet 
### 
Both the Soviet government
and the United States recognize
the existence of a state of war,
and both agree that it is a "cold
war" and not a "hot war," said
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman
of the Hoover War Library, as
he addressed the delegates of
the Western College Congress
yesterday.
Each claims that its aim is to
preserve the independence of the
weaker countries against the ag
gression of the other, Dr. Fisher
added.
POLITICAL CONFLICTS
Although some conflicts come from
competing political and economic
systems, others come purely from
power politics. They would have
existed if there were no commun
ism, and are working at present
because only two great powers, the
Soviet Union and the United States
remain strong enough to influence
world politics, Dr. Fisher continued.
Consequently, the US and Russia
are facing each other on many
fronts.
Communistic ideologies and tac
tics are being used to promote poli
cies in the line of power politics, but
they are not the cause of these
policies. The cure for power poli
tics lies in the strengthening of world
government.
IDEOLOGY IMPORTANT
Ideology plays a very important
part in Russia's policy, Dr. Fisher
added. They believe firmly that
communism and capitalism will
eventually conflict, that capitalism
loads to imperialism, that capitalism
breeds wars, that their country is
the greatest power in the world,
and that Stalin is infallible.
This dogma of infallibility makes
it possible for the government to
change policies from time to time.
They have changed from extreme
isolation, to alliances with Germany,
and to alliances with the Allies.
SUBTLE EXPANSION
The Communists are very subtle
in their international expansion,
added Dr. Fisher. They take "the
movement, in each country step by
step, seldom causing real revolutions.
The Communist Party is active in
ternationally once again, although
they claim that the new organiza
tion differs from the old Commintern.
In conclusion Dr. Fisher stated,
"We must be prepared not only to
defend our basic position with
force if force is used against us, but
at the same time we must try to
create a true recognition of the
reality of the world community and
to strengthen the institutes for its
government."

preserve the independence of the
weaker countries against the ag
gression of the other, Dr. Fisher
added.
POLITICAL CONFLICTS
Although some conflicts come from
competing political and economic
systems, others come purely from
power politics. They would have
existed if there were no commun
ism, and are working at present
because only two great powers, the
Soviet Union and the United States
remain strong enough to influence
world politics, Dr. Fisher continued.
Consequently, the US and Russia
are facing each other on many
fronts.
Communistic ideologies and tac
tics are being used to promote poli
cies in the line of power politics, but
they are not the cause of these
policies. The cure for power poli
tics lies in the strengthening of world
government.
IDEOLOGY IMPORTANT
Ideology plays a very important
part in Russia's policy, Dr. Fisher
added. They believe firmly that
communism and capitalism will
eventually conflict, that capitalism
loads to imperialism, that capitalism
breeds wars, that their country is
the greatest power in the world,
and that Stalin is infallible.
This dogma of infallibility makes
it possible for the government to
change policies from time to time.
They have changed from extreme
isolation, to alliances with Germany,
and to alliances with the Allies.
SUBTLE EXPANSION
The Communists are very subtle
in their international expansion,
added Dr. Fisher. They take "the
movement, in each country step by
step, seldom causing real revolutions.
The Communist Party is active in
ternationally once again, although
they claim that the new organiza
tion differs from the old Commintern.
In conclusion Dr. Fisher stated,
"We must be prepared not only to
defend our basic position with
force if force is used against us, but
at the same time we must try to
create a true recognition of the
reality of the world community and
to strengthen the institutes for its
government."
Both the Soviet government
and the United States recognize
the existence of a state of war,
and both agree that it is a "cold
war" and not a "hot war," said
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman
of the Hoover War Library, as
he addressed the delegates of
the Western College Congress
yesterday.
Each claims that its aim is to
preserve the independence of the
weaker countries against the ag
gression of the other, Dr. Fisher
added.
