# Russian Leaders Fail In Agreementsâ€”Deane
## 
### 
The leaders of the Soviet
Union do not have very much
respect for agreements made
by men, said General John R.
Deane, former head of the
American Military Mission to
Moscow as he addressed the
delegates of the Western Col
lege Congress at its opening as
sembly yesterday.
As examples of this statement,
General Deane told of the prom
ised shuttle bombing bases in West
ern Russia, the sea bases near Ger
man submarine headquarters, and
the land bases in Manchuria from
which the Western Allies were to
have bombed Japan. All of these
were promised over and over again,
said Deane, but these promises were
followed by excuse after excuse.
Speaking from his experiences in
wartime Russia, Deane told of the
factors which aided the Communist
program and the reasons why he
felt, it might not work. The fact that
Russia has a unanimity of purpose,
a very strong army, and she obtained
all immediate objectives at the end
of the war are all in her favor.
FACTORS AGAINST SUCCESS
Factors which tend to weaken
the possibility of success are that
the people themselves are not fully
behind the policy of the leaders, the
industry in Russia will remain
largely potential for a long time,
there is pressure in the country
against so many false promises, and
that there is no way of being certain
what type of government will suc
ceed the present one when Stalin
leaves.
General Deane is the author of the
current best seller "Thr Strange Al
liance," in which he tells of his ex
periences in Russia.
FOUR POINT POLICY
Deane advised the- Americans t<>
follow a four point policy in com
bating the influence of Communist
Russia. The first point is to support
the United Nations completely in an
effort If) solve all disputes by paci
fic means. Second we should build
up a good intelligence service, with
the best minds of the country at
work. Third, we should keep the
American people fully informed of
all developments through releases
from the State Deparmtenl.
The last and most important thing
which is necessary is a very highly
developed system of National De
fense. This involves scientific re
search, an Air Force above all, a
Navy large enough' to control the
seas, and a small land army which is
very highly trained to seize bases.

Moscow as he addressed the
delegates of the Western Col
lege Congress at its opening as
sembly yesterday.
As examples of this statement,
General Deane told of the prom
ised shuttle bombing bases in West
ern Russia, the sea bases near Ger
man submarine headquarters, and
the land bases in Manchuria from
which the Western Allies were to
have bombed Japan. All of these
were promised over and over again,
said Deane, but these promises were
followed by excuse after excuse.
Speaking from his experiences in
wartime Russia, Deane told of the
factors which aided the Communist
program and the reasons why he
felt, it might not work. The fact that
Russia has a unanimity of purpose,
a very strong army, and she obtained
all immediate objectives at the end
of the war are all in her favor.
FACTORS AGAINST SUCCESS
Factors which tend to weaken
the possibility of success are that
the people themselves are not fully
behind the policy of the leaders, the
industry in Russia will remain
largely potential for a long time,
there is pressure in the country
against so many false promises, and
that there is no way of being certain
what type of government will suc
ceed the present one when Stalin
leaves.
General Deane is the author of the
current best seller "Thr Strange Al
liance," in which he tells of his ex
periences in Russia.
FOUR POINT POLICY
Deane advised the- Americans t<>
follow a four point policy in com
bating the influence of Communist
Russia. The first point is to support
the United Nations completely in an
effort If) solve all disputes by paci
fic means. Second we should build
up a good intelligence service, with
the best minds of the country at
work. Third, we should keep the
American people fully informed of
all developments through releases
from the State Deparmtenl.
The last and most important thing
which is necessary is a very highly
developed system of National De
fense. This involves scientific re
search, an Air Force above all, a
Navy large enough' to control the
seas, and a small land army which is
very highly trained to seize bases.
The leaders of the Soviet
Union do not have very much
respect for agreements made
by men, said General John R.
Deane, former head of the
American Military Mission to
Moscow as he addressed the
delegates of the Western Col
lege Congress at its opening as
sembly yesterday.
