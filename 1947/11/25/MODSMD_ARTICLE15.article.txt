# Students Should Decide 'New Union Fund' Future
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
So far The Daily has not men
tioned the reasons Acting Student
Manager H. B. McCaullcy gave last
Wednesday night for beginning a
"new student union fund."
McCaullcy told Excom that im
mediate action should be taken or:
(1) The Board of Trustees would
decide to use the "Mem Aud dol
lar" for other things; and,
(2) The Union Board of Gover
nors would channel its "$lO,OOO
profit" in other directions.
By listening to McCaullcy one
would get the impression that the
students of Stanford can either take
what the administration offers or
expect to get nothing at al 11.
Frankly, I don't look at it that
way.
I don't believe the administration
does.
The student manager said the
Board of Trustees is being "very
generous" and "marvelous" in
agreeing to use the "Mem Aud dol

lar" to open a "new student union
fund."
Pardon me, Jiggs. but I disagree.
The Board of Trustees is exercis
ing good judgment and displaying
foresight and a definite interest in
the future of Stanford. Nothing ex
traordinary. In fact, just about what
anyone would expect.
McCaullcy also said that if the
"Mem Aud dollar" is not used for a
"new student union fund" it will be
a loss to the students of Stanford.
Again I can't see the reasoning
behind the statement.
If the "Mem Aud dollar" were
not used for a union fund it would
still be used to good advantage.
Perhaps to raise the salary of sev
eral professors. Perhaps to hire two
more gardeners. Maybe to put new
lights in the library.
But the Board of Trustees has
considered these things. In the
light of the overall picture of Stan
ford it apparently has decided that

j the "Mem And dollar" could be
used for a "new student union
fund" if the ASSU so desired.
McCaul ley's second reason for
making a quick decision is whimsi
cal. It's easy to see why the Union
Board of Governors is anxious to
assign its profits to something defi
nite before someone higher in the
administration does it for the board.
But let the board keep the money
for a while. It's in safe hands. Be
sides, since its existence has been
publicized in The Daily there is
little chance that it will be over
looked.
Why wasn't something along the
line of the following done?
Excom, at the student manager's
request, could have written letters
to both the Board of Trustees and
j the Union Board of Governors in
' the following spirit:
"Dear Board of Trustees: We
! have been notified that you are con
| sidering transferring the 'Mem Avid

dollar' to a 'new student union
fund.' We suggest the Board set the
money aside and defer any final ac
tion until the ASSU can determine
to what extent it can contribute to
such a fund. Excom." j
"Dear Board of Union Governors:
We have been notified that you
have voted to allocate Union profits
to a 'new student union fund. 1
"No such fund has yet been start
ed by the ASSU. We hope that you
will retain the money for a short
period of time during which the
ASSU will investigate the feasibil
ity of beginning such a fund. Ex
com."
Wouldn't this have been a more
constructive approach?
It would have placed the students
of Stanford in a position of starting
the "new student union fund."
A few thoughts on the matter now
will be to the benefit of the stu
dents of Stanford in the years to
come.
