bers nf (he Chicago Typographical
Union (AFL) went on strike to
night against Chicago's six daily
newspapers to support demands in
a dispute over wages and employ
ment rules.
There was no indication immedi

ions, including pressmen and stere
otypers, would observe the typogra
phers' picket lines.

editor of the Tribune, which has a
weekday circulation of 1,025,000,
said the newspaper would be pub

The other morning and afternoon
papers were expected to publish
with the same process. The Chicago
Times published one photocngraved
edition Thursday after composing
