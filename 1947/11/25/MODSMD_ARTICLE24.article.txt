# Dr. Bloch Stresses Problems Of Science In Atomic Future
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Stanford
chapter of Sigma Xi, honorary sci
entific society, Thursday, Dr. Felix
Bloch of the Stanford Physics De
partment said that "it would be a
sad world indeed in which scientific
progress had to be measured in
equivalent tons of dynamite."
Dr. Bloch said that although the
public generally attaches more im
portance to the atomic bomb anil to
the chain-reacting atomic pile, nu
clear physicists have fundamental
problems to solve that are much
more important, in so far as they
will contribute to a deeper under
standing of nature.
WOKLI) PEACE AND COMFORT
They are of interest not only to
the scientist, but probably, in the
future, to the peace and comfort of
the whole world, he said.
The most important of the un
solved problems of nuclear physics,
which Dr. Bloch suggested might be
as valuable in peace as the atomic
bomb was in war, is the nature and
origin of the mysterious nuclear
binding force which holds together
the protons in every atomic nucleus,
which tend to push each other apart
because of their equal positive
charges.
LITTLE KNOWN OF FORCE
About all that is known of this
force, said Dr. Bloch, is that it acts

only over very short distances, and
that it is not of an electrical nature.
Much work on this problem is be
ing done at Stanford with the cyclo
tron and with Dr. Bloch's nuclear
induction apparatus. When the large
model of Dr. Hansen's electron ac
celerator is completed, it will no
doubt contribute a great deal to the
further study of this problem. Dr.
Bloch added.
