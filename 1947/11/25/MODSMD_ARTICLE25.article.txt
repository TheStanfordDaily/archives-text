WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (UP).—
The Supreme Court, in another 5-4
split, today ruled that three Jeho
vah's Witnesses who walked out of
conscientious objector camps during
the war were not entitled to draft
deferments as ministers.
The four-man minority maintained
that even though the men were only
part-time ministers, they were
seeking to spread their faith and had
as much right to draft deferment as
regular ministers.
It was the court's fourth 5-4 split
out of seven decisions involving
written opinions in the current
term. The others involved govern
ment payment on a lend-lease con
tract, farmers' rights to collect on
federal crop insurance and the posi
tion of truckers under the wage
hour law.
