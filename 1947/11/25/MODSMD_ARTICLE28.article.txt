# Pre-Rush Row Open Houses End Tonight
## 
### 
The. final introductory open
house session scheduled for this
quarter by Stanford's 24 frater
nities will be held tonight from
7 to 9, said Pete August, Interfra
ternity Council president. All
non-fraternity men are urged to
take advantage of this period, and
visit all the men's Row houses.
The orientation plan was initiated
this quarter to help both Row and
non-org men get acquainted, and to
give the freshmen a chance to look
over the fruternity situation so they
may "think it over" during the
Christmas holidays, said August. The
open houses are not part of rush
ing.
DECIDE ON RUSHING
This will give non-fraternity men
an idea whether they care to go
through formal rushing winter quar
ter.
Under council rules, incoming
freshmen may not be rushed until
the first open house of winter quar
ter, August continued. Men with
less than 90 units (other than
incoming freshmen) may not be
rushed until they have completed
one quarter at Stanford. Transfers
with })0 units or more may be rushed
at any time.
VISITS SHOULD BE LIMITED
At the open houses, freshmen
should try to get the general picture
of the house, and then travel on to
another. Visits should be limited to
20 minutes. The diugrum shows
all the fraternities in their approxi
mate locations.
Mimeographed rushing rules were
distributed at Encina, Toyon, Vil
lage, and fraternity houses during
the lust open house session. The
Interfraternity Magazine will be
published and distributed next
quarter.
Men who started the rounds at
the last open houses should make
an effort to visit the rest. No formal
invitations should be sent, and men
should just drop around of their
own accord. Fraternity men will be
glad to answer any questions the
visitors may ask.
