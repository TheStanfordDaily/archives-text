SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 24 (UP). â€”Sailors were keeping ;i wary
lookout today for a "phantom rhountain" 400 miles off the California
coast, despite a denial by the Navy that a mysterious undersea reef exists.
Although an official Navy report declared that no trace could be found
of the strange, vanishing shoal reported by several ships, confused crew
members of four Navy survey vessels admitted they had discovered in
dications of "something" under the orient shipping lanes where the
charts show nothing but deep sea.
'I he only trouble, Capt. F. D. Humbling said, the "mountain" disap
peared again after they had located it by sounding instruments.
Humbling skippered the Navy ocean survey ship Maury and three
smaller vessels sent out to investigate several reports that a "large, inde
finable mass" had been "sighted" about 48 feet under water along one ol
the regular seu routes between San Francisco and Hawaii.
When the survey ships reached the position reported, Hambling said
their echo sounding gear picked up an echo from a large undersea mass.
"We changed course and started toward it, proceeding slowly, Ham-
Ming said. "When we were about 400 yards from the object, it disap
peared, and we didn't get another echo. We tracked and retracked the
area without result."
Humbling said his sounding apparatus would not # react us it did to u
school of fish or a mass of marine plunt growth.
"That certainly limits the possibilities of just what it was we 'found'
out there," he added. "I'm baffled."
