### 
JERUSALEM, Nov. 24 (UP).â€”
Mrs. Goldie Mayerson, head of the
Jewish Agency's political depart
men, told a press conference today
that the underground army Haganah
was training extensively in prepar
ation for possible Arab attacks in
Palestine.
Grey-haired, matronly Mrs. May
erson denied reports that Haganah
was conscripting Jews from 35 to 42
years of age for a "home guard," but
he said the underground armed
force estimated at 80.000 was "pre
pared for trouble."
She said the Jewish Agency was
not asking the United Nations to
"give us a state and then defend
us. We would be in a weak position
if we did that. We have been and
are preparing to defend ourselves."
Earlier today a Haganah officer
said Jews probably would have to
depend on foreign aid, particularly
American, in event Ihe Arab world
consolidated its forces for a "holy
war." The officer said he was con
rident Haganah could repel any in
vasion, but that Zionists could not
cope with the Egyptian navy and
Syrian air force.
"We know the world's nations
probably will stand on the sidelines
in event of a Jewish-Arab war," he
said, "but we are hopeful that our
friends, particularly in America, will
Hid us morally and physically if wo
are forced to fight for our lives."
The officer, who asked not to be
identified, said Jewish men aged 18
to 35 have been training "for some
time" and that the 35-42-year class
had been called up for "hardening
up." Most reserves, the Haganah
official said, have no weapons.
