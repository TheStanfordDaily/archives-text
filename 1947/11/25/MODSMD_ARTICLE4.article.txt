# Palestine Issue Due
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, Nov. 24 (UP).—
In (he first test vote on the future
of Palestine, the United Nations
Palestine committee tonight rejected
an Arab move to delay any recom
mendation until the International
Court of Justice rules whether UN
has the legal right to act.
The committee also rejected, 21 to
20, with 13 abstaining, an Arab move
to ask the court whether UN has
the right to recommend the parti
tion against the wishes of the Arab
majority which lives there.
The ballots cleared the way for
voting on a Soviet-American plan
to partition Palestine into indepen
dent Arab and Jewish states, and a
rival Arab plan to set up the Holy
Land as an independent, Arab-con
trolled state.
Just before the balloting began,
delegates were rocked by Jewish
and Arab threats to wage a "holy
war" against each other for mas
tery of Palestine.
ARABS AGAINST PARTITION
The Arabs, while defeated on the
first test votes, took encouragement
from the fact that they were able
to muster so many votes for their
legal objections to partition. So far,
only 12 nations have promised pos
itively to vote against actual parti
tion.
If the Arabs were able to draw 18
or 20 votes against partition in the
final vote, partition would he de
feated. The UN general assembly
can make important recommenda
tions only by a two-thirds majority
of those voting, and 18 votes would
be enough to block any action.
LARGE NUMBER TO ABSTAIN
UN has 57 members, but. several
were expected to be absent, in the
final vote, and a large number will
abstain.
On the Arab legal objections to
UN action, the United Stales and
Russia voted "no," and Great Brit
ain abstained—as she has said she
will do on all Palestine ballots.
The committee then plunged into
a paragraph-by-paragraph vote on
a third Arab resolution to make the
Jewish refugee problem an interna
tional obligation, thus taking off
some of the pressure to send Jews
to Palestine.
PROVISIONS FOR REFUGEES
The committee voted 17 to 14. with
23 abstaining, to ask countries of
origin to take back Jewish refugees
and displaced persons. The commit
tee adopted, 18 to 16, another clause
that Jewish refugees and displaced
persons who can not be repatriated
"should be absorbed in the territor
ies of members of UN in proportion
to their area, economic resources,
per capita income, population and
other relevant factors."
A move to establish a special com
mittee to set. quotas of Jewish refu
gees that each UN member should
absorb was defeated, 18 to 15, with
22 abstaining.

of those voting, and 18 votes would
be enough to block any action.
LARGE NUMBER TO ABSTAIN
UN has 57 members, but. several
were expected to be absent, in the
final vote, and a large number will
abstain.
On the Arab legal objections to
UN action, the United Stales and
Russia voted "no," and Great Brit
ain abstained—as she has said she
will do on all Palestine ballots.
The committee then plunged into
a paragraph-by-paragraph vote on
a third Arab resolution to make the
Jewish refugee problem an interna
tional obligation, thus taking off
some of the pressure to send Jews
to Palestine.
PROVISIONS FOR REFUGEES
The committee voted 17 to 14. with
23 abstaining, to ask countries of
origin to take back Jewish refugees
and displaced persons. The commit
tee adopted, 18 to 16, another clause
that Jewish refugees and displaced
persons who can not be repatriated
"should be absorbed in the territor
ies of members of UN in proportion
to their area, economic resources,
per capita income, population and
other relevant factors."
A move to establish a special com
mittee to set. quotas of Jewish refu
gees that each UN member should
absorb was defeated, 18 to 15, with
22 abstaining.
LAKE SUCCESS, Nov. 24 (UP).—
In (he first test vote on the future
of Palestine, the United Nations
Palestine committee tonight rejected
an Arab move to delay any recom
mendation until the International
Court of Justice rules whether UN
has the legal right to act.
The committee also rejected, 21 to
20, with 13 abstaining, an Arab move
to ask the court whether UN has
the right to recommend the parti
tion against the wishes of the Arab
majority which lives there.
The ballots cleared the way for
voting on a Soviet-American plan
to partition Palestine into indepen
dent Arab and Jewish states, and a
rival Arab plan to set up the Holy
Land as an independent, Arab-con
trolled state.
Just before the balloting began,
delegates were rocked by Jewish
and Arab threats to wage a "holy
war" against each other for mas
tery of Palestine.
ARABS AGAINST PARTITION
The Arabs, while defeated on the
first test votes, took encouragement
from the fact that they were able
to muster so many votes for their
legal objections to partition. So far,
only 12 nations have promised pos
itively to vote against actual parti
tion.
If the Arabs were able to draw 18
or 20 votes against partition in the
final vote, partition would he de
feated. The UN general assembly
can make important recommenda
tions only by a two-thirds majority
of those voting, and 18 votes would
be enough to block any action.
