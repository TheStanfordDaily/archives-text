Dear Eddie:
Buck him study hard all day
Economics, How make Warn pum
Sun go down, return to Village
See um Squaw and two papooses.
Squaw heap tired, nerves on edge
Good for squaw get out of Logan
Ninety beads not much nite life
Write um Eddie c o Longbarn
Heap big friend of tribe on farm—
Squaw content for three more
moons.
