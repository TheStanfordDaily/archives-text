# 'Unknown' Scout Hero of Near Big Game Victory
## Watched Cal All Year; Charted Weak Points 
### 
Marchie Schwartz, a grand guy and a great coach who had the
misfortune to buck Lady Luck all through the 1947 season with
his Stanford football team, sat down with the tears of joy stream
ing down his face.
He had just received the greatest standing ovation ever tended

from assembled fellow-coacheS and
sports writers at the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers Association
luncheon in San Francisco.
Marchie, whose team never won
a gome all season, started to speak,
but his voice broke and he couldn't
say anything more than "Thank
you."
Later, after he had recovered, he
told how his team of youngsters got
off the floor and nearly upset
mighty California last Saturday,
only to lose out in the final minutes
of play, 21-18.
gkkat scouting job
"It was all because of one of the
greatest scouting jobs ever turned in
on any club in football history," ex
plained Schwartz.
"I would be the first to admit
that Stanford should not have had a
chance against the mighty Bears —
but it happens that Lady Luck was
on our side for once this year.
That was when a fellow named
Frank Pierson offered to scout for
us. He was recommended to me by
George Munger, coach at Penn. I
had never met him before, but talked
to him and he offered to work for
us just for the fun of it.
SCOUTED CALIFORNIA
' So I assigned him to scout Cali
fornia. He followed the Bears and

saw them in every game except
Wisconsin. Then, occasionally, he
would slip over to Stanford to see
what plays we had in stock.
''With this knowledge, we called a
meeting a week before the California
game. He had the most complete
scouting report I ever saw. With
the players listening, he went over
every hole in the great California
line and told us exactly what plays
of ours could be used to make yard
age.
"He also showed us exactly how
to form our defense to stop the high
scoring Bear attack," said Marchie.
PIERSON CONVINCING
Schwartz then went on to ex
plain that Pierson was so convincing
in his outline that he (Pierson) had
the Stanford players believing they
could beat California.
"That's how we got our morale
up. And we spent a full week using
only plays that Pierson said would
work against Cal; and working only
on the defensive setup we needed."
"As you know, it nearly worked
to perfection.
"All I can say is that I hope Mr.
Pierson decides to live in the West
the rest of his life. He can always
be my scout."


Ripping off right tackle for three yards and a first down
against California in last Saturday's Big Game is Stanford
captain GEORGE QUIST (32). He had just taken a handoff from
Card quarterback AINSLIE BELL (26) in background. Quist and
his teammates almost beat a highly favored Bear eleven and

Coach Marchie Schwartz gives a great amount of the credit to
FRANK PIERSON, an "unknown" scout who had charted Bear
plays all year. The one Cal player is unidentified as are his
teammates "resting" on the Stanford turf.
