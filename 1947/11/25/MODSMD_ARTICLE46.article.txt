yesterday. Elimination matches will be held on Tuesday, Decem
ber 2, and Wednesday, December 3, while the finals come* off
December 5.
There are still openings in all weight divisions of both tourna-

the 125- and 130-pound classes in the
All University Tournament and in
the 125-pound division of the Novice
Tourney.
Coach Lunny pointed out that the
All University Tournament is very
important because the winners
usually receive the top position on
the varsity team, providing they are
eligible. "However," the Stanford
boxing coach said, "the Novice
Tournament also means a lot because
it indicates the potentialities of the
new men who try out for the team."

players on the football team would
enter the tournament now that their
season has been completed.
