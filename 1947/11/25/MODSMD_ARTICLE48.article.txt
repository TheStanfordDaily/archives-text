CLEVELAND, Nov. 24 (UP).—
Lou Boudreau tonight was retained
as manager of the Cleveland In
dians when he signed a two-year
contract that "practically can't be
cancellable," President Bill Veeck
announced.
The American League's stellar
shortstop who piloted the Tribe to
a fouth-placre finish this yea—two
spots above the team's 1946 stand
ing—was signed to a "virtual" two
year contract, and given a "consid
erable" raise in pay, Veeck said.
"We are both pleased with terms
of the contract," Veeck said, speak
ing for his 30-year-old manager.
Boudreau reportedly was paid
$40,000 as Indians' guide during the
past season. Terms agreed on to
night were not disclosed.
"It was a considerably improved
contract," said Boudreau. who made
119 double plays in the season just
completed.
The action by Veeck in signing
Boudreau was interpreted as a vote
of confidence in his manager, who
several weeks ago was actually on
the trading block.
At the close of the baseball sea
son, Veeck reportedly was trying to
work a deal with the St. Louis
Browns to trade Boudreau for Verne
Stephens and Jack Kramer and an
undisclosed amount of cash.
The deal fell through when the
Browns' stars were traded to the
Boston Red Sox.
