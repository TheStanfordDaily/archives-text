SCORE KNOTTED
Voss opened the scoring with a
left-handed hook shot, but Thomp
son tallied a few moments later to
knot the score at 2-all. Two sensa
tional goals by Rose, a long push
shot and .a right-handed hook tally,
and a charity toss by Thompson
gave the Indians a 7 to 3 lead.
Two quick goals by Voss tied it
again at 7—all, before the varsity
forged ahead and maintained a
short lead throughout the remain
der of the first half.
The alumns failed to score until
after seven minutes of the second
half had elapsed. Davidson opened
the scoring with a tip-in, and tallies
by Thompson and Rose brought the
score to 26 to 16 before Voss could
break into the scoring column for
the alumni.
Davidson cashed in on two fol
low-ups to bring it to 30 to 18, but
Voss. Burnett, and Linai came
back for the alumni to narrow the
margin to 32 to 26. From that point
to the final buzzer, the play was
featured by the rough style charac
teristic of the first half.
