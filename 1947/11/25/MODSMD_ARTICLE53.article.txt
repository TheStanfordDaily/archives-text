# Sigma Nu's, Machine In Rough Fray
## 
### 
The Big Red Machine from the
Village and the Sigma Nu's from the
Row battled to a 12 to 12 tie in yes
terday's second intramural football
playoff round, in a game that almost
became an out and out brawl as
overzealous members of both teams
stopped concentrating on touch
downs and started to work on one
another.
SHOWED PROWESS
However, between the frequent
outbursts, both teams managed to
display football prowess that bodes
ill lor their next opponents, Delta
Upsilon and the Beta's.
The Delts and the Beta sevens
also moved into the semi-final round
of mural play as they gained vic
tories over the Firehouse and the
Alpha Delts respectively.
Yesterday's battle between the
Red Machine and the Sigma Nu's
iound the Row men breaking into
the score column first on a pass
play lrom Bob Thede to Jack Wood
that netted 80 yards.
The Village boys came back in a
big hurry to counter with their first
six as they marched down to the
Sigma Nu goal where Sam Payne
lofted an aerial over the final stripe
to Fred Hanum who made a miracu
lous catch for the touchdown.
SIGMA'S COME BACK
Unable to stand the closeness of
the score, the Sigma Nu's came back
in the second period to score again
on another pass play. Once again
Jack Wood was in the driver's seat.
He flipped to Herb Eggleston this
time for a 70 yarder and a 12 to (j
lead.
The Red Machine set up their final
counter on a spectacular lateral
pass play. Payne took the ball, lat
eraled out to Jack Reed who, be
j hind effective blocking, threw di
] agonally across the field back to
Payne who raced to the Sigma Nu
' three yard line. A pass from Payne
' to Hannum scored moments later.
