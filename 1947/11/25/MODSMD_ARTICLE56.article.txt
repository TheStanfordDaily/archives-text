# Who Gets the Profits?
## 
### 
If you're interested in a new pavilion or union
you'll be interested in this editorial.
The most important thing to consider when
planning a new pavilion or union is not whether
it seats 9,000 or 10,000 or whether it has three
pool tables or a couple of ping pong tables.
The most important single item from a long
range outlook is simplyâ€”Where are the profits
going?
This is a question which should be answered
before the first dollar is donated for a new build
ing, before the first assessment is made against

a student, and not too long after the preliminary
planning for a fund is begun.
As was pointed out in yesterday's editorial
the operation of a Union dining hall isn't the least
profitable business on campus. The present
Union wasn't built by students, therefore there
can be no direct analogy drawn between it and
a Union built through a student-planned pro
gram. But it does show that the distribution of
the profits is worth considering.
Any plans for a student union or a new pav
ilion should include some mention of profit
distribution.
