# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
Those loveable creatures of nature, women to you,
arc always good for a laugh. If they're not tripping
over their new looks, or balancing bird cages on their
heads, they're messing around in class.
Usually they get away with it, too, 'cause they got
long eyelashes to flutter in the wind, or nice legs to
cross, but every once in a while they get crossed up-—
the women, that is!
A trio of our Farm girls were suffering through
an early morning lecture the other day, alternately
yawning and biting pencils, when one of the angels
got a brilliant idea to while away the dull time. She
didn't like the prof 'cause he talked like he was
mumbling in his sleep, so bygawd she was going to be
funny, just hilarious.
She tore a large sheet of notebook paper out of
her binder, and started scribbling a little note, some
thing like "... whereas Mr. so-and-so is putting me
to sleep, and whereas his lectures are atrociously
stupid, and whereas we don't like it, the undersigned
wish to express their disgust and disapproval ..."
She thought this a very accurate description of
class, so she signed her fair name with a flourish,
smiled at herself very contentedly, and invited her
giggling neighbors to join in the proclamation. Only
a joke, she purred, he'll never get hold of this lcetle
note, just a joke!
The note slowly started down the row, possibly
destined for a large circulation of signatures, when
one little smoothie threw a wrench in the monkey
business. He glanced over the note, grinned at the
originators of the devilish plan, and calmly pocketed
the piece of paper. The girls were slightly peeved
al seeing their joke practically still-born, only five
signature on it, but they forgot it soon.
Smoothie meantime tore another piece of paper

out of his folder, folded it like the girls' note, and
put it in the same pocket. When the class was over, he
edged close to the prof, waited till he was sure the
girls saw him, and took the blank piece of paper out
of his pocket and handed it to the prof, all the time
grinning.
The prof was still talking to some other students,
so he didn't immediately open the note. The girls did
a double-take, gulped just once, frantically, and one
of the three made a mad dash past the prof, snatching
the note out of his hand, and heading for the safety
of the open air!
The prof gazed after her, just a bit surprised, and
shook his head. The sweet young thing, well, she
hasn't sat in the same seat in that class since that day.
Final result: A blank look for the prof, and a blank
piece of paper for the girl!
Where's the original note? The smoothie still has
it in his pocket, just keeping it for a rainy day.

If the shoe fits, wear it!
The local Veterans Administration, expecting the
righteous wrath of Bay Area collegians who have been
left stranded without subsistence funds for several
week.*; now, has taken necessary precautions to pro

Included with the very fe\v G.I. checks that arc
trickling in slowly now, are some notices of an ominous
nature which show that the VA has a guilty con
science, and fears reprisals.

She thought this a very accurate description of
class, so she signed her fair name with a flourish,
smiled at herself very contentedly, and invited her
giggling neighbors to join in the proclamation. Only
a joke, she purred, he'll never get hold of this lcetle
note, just a joke!
The note slowly started down the row, possibly
destined for a large circulation of signatures, when
one little smoothie threw a wrench in the monkey
business. He glanced over the note, grinned at the
originators of the devilish plan, and calmly pocketed
the piece of paper. The girls were slightly peeved
al seeing their joke practically still-born, only five
signature on it, but they forgot it soon.
Smoothie meantime tore another piece of paper

out of his folder, folded it like the girls' note, and
put it in the same pocket. When the class was over, he
edged close to the prof, waited till he was sure the
girls saw him, and took the blank piece of paper out
of his pocket and handed it to the prof, all the time
grinning.
The prof was still talking to some other students,
so he didn't immediately open the note. The girls did
a double-take, gulped just once, frantically, and one
of the three made a mad dash past the prof, snatching
the note out of his hand, and heading for the safety
of the open air!
The prof gazed after her, just a bit surprised, and
shook his head. The sweet young thing, well, she
hasn't sat in the same seat in that class since that day.
Final result: A blank look for the prof, and a blank
piece of paper for the girl!
Where's the original note? The smoothie still has
it in his pocket, just keeping it for a rainy day.

Those loveable creatures of nature, women to you,
arc always good for a laugh. If they're not tripping
over their new looks, or balancing bird cages on their

long eyelashes to flutter in the wind, or nice legs to

A trio of our Farm girls were suffering through
an early morning lecture the other day, alternately
yawning and biting pencils, when one of the angels
got a brilliant idea to while away the dull time. She
didn't like the prof 'cause he talked like he was
mumbling in his sleep, so bygawd she was going to be
funny, just hilarious.
She tore a large sheet of notebook paper out of
her binder, and started scribbling a little note, some
thing like "... whereas Mr. so-and-so is putting me
to sleep, and whereas his lectures are atrociously
stupid, and whereas we don't like it, the undersigned
