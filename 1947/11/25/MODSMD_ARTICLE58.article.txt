Kace relations have always been a touchy subject
In write about, for the consensus of opinion seems to
.set forth the argument that there never has been
and there never will be any noticeable improvement
in this field of human relations.
However, gains in race relations do not always get
the underscoring they deserve. If violence occurs, a
depressing aura is cast over the whole field and
any progress that has been made as a result of inter
racial cooperation tends to be obscured.
The majority of people in this nation have not the
slightest idea that there arc significant social forces
in the South working on specific problems in the field
of race relations—continually studying grievances that
oppress the Negro community and seeking to right
remedial wrongs.
New avenues of knowledge are constantly being
opened up and explored. When a Southern institution
ol higher learning, with the rank of the University of
North Carolina, makes over the years a studious
effort to promote the understanding of Negro life,
both in the classroom and by the conference method,
the result is bound to be beneficial far beyond the
bounds of its own campus.
The fact that intcrcollegiatc interracial conferences

are now well established in the South is not so gen
erally known. But these conferences promise well
for the future of race relations in the South, where the
Negro population is concentrated.
A bridge over the cultural gap between the races
is being built, too, through the service of Negroes on
public housing authorities and other public boards and
commissions in the South. There is a growing trend
toward the appointment of Negro professionals to im
portant administrative positions below the Mason and
Dixon Line, to deal with Negro problems of educa
tion and public health.
In the rural South, as well as in the cities, progress
can be observed. In Georgia, notably, and in other
Southern states, marked gains have been made in
Negro land ownership. On the job training during the
war period has presented new opportunities for the
employment of skilled Negro workers, although it is too
soon yet to say what the ultimate effect of pressure on
these new job resources for Negroes will be as time
goes on.
Nevertheless, there is, in my opinion, plenty of
evidence that missionary zeal, combined with social
understanding and perservering effort, is bettering
race relations and neutralizing dangerous toxins of
prejudice and discrimination.

Negro population is concentrated.
A bridge over the cultural gap between the races
is being built, too, through the service of Negroes on
public housing authorities and other public boards and
commissions in the South. There is a growing trend
toward the appointment of Negro professionals to im
portant administrative positions below the Mason and
Dixon Line, to deal with Negro problems of educa
tion and public health.
In the rural South, as well as in the cities, progress
can be observed. In Georgia, notably, and in other
Southern states, marked gains have been made in
Negro land ownership. On the job training during the
war period has presented new opportunities for the
employment of skilled Negro workers, although it is too
soon yet to say what the ultimate effect of pressure on
these new job resources for Negroes will be as time
goes on.
Nevertheless, there is, in my opinion, plenty of
evidence that missionary zeal, combined with social
understanding and perservering effort, is bettering
race relations and neutralizing dangerous toxins of
prejudice and discrimination.
Kace relations have always been a touchy subject
In write about, for the consensus of opinion seems to
.set forth the argument that there never has been
and there never will be any noticeable improvement
in this field of human relations.
However, gains in race relations do not always get
the underscoring they deserve. If violence occurs, a
depressing aura is cast over the whole field and
any progress that has been made as a result of inter
racial cooperation tends to be obscured.
The majority of people in this nation have not the
slightest idea that there arc significant social forces
in the South working on specific problems in the field
of race relations—continually studying grievances that
oppress the Negro community and seeking to right
remedial wrongs.
New avenues of knowledge are constantly being
opened up and explored. When a Southern institution
ol higher learning, with the rank of the University of
North Carolina, makes over the years a studious
effort to promote the understanding of Negro life,
both in the classroom and by the conference method,
the result is bound to be beneficial far beyond the
bounds of its own campus.
The fact that intcrcollegiatc interracial conferences

are now well established in the South is not so gen
erally known. But these conferences promise well
for the future of race relations in the South, where the
Negro population is concentrated.
