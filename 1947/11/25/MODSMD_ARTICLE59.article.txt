# Organize the 'Bohemians'
## CAMPUS OPINION 
### 
To the Editor:
After religiously scanning the pages of The Daily
.ill quarter, I have noted the utter and complete lack
of any attempts to organize the off-campus students.
It seems to me that any group wishing to pursue a
left-wingish policy might do well to make a stab at

I
organizing these "Bohemians" and potential Bohemi
ans.
At any rate, someone, possibly the off-campus rep
resentative to Excom, should get on the ball and
throw a social affair of some kind. No one seems to
realize that this large percentage of our student body
is losing its school spirit, its esprit d'eorps, by being
left out in the cold. Can't somebody do something?
