# Seven Union Unit Houses Trace History
## 
### EVELYN WYTHE 
Seven residences combine today
to form the present Stanford Union
Unit — residences whose divergent
histories add greatly to the essence
of Farm lore.
By amalgamating three houses—
Union residence, Mariposa, and Elm
Cottage—in 1033, the unit started on
its way up. Madrono was added in
1934, Manzanita in 1935, Hawthorne
in 1938, and the Oaks in 1940.
These houses were bought by the
University in the above years and
have been owned by it ever since.
Students living in the respective
dorms all eat at the Union Resi
dence dining hall, since the houses
lack adequate kitchen facilities.
Union Unit was not a planned
idea but merely expanded as more
houses became available and more
women enrolled.
Before 1933, women's residences
included Roble Hall and nine soro
rity houses. At this time, however,
only 500 women students, including
graduate women, were enrolled. In
May of 1933 the enrollment was en
larged and Union Unit was formed.
As the number of women increased,
the unit was also enlarged to its
present size.
None of the houses, after having
been purchased, was affiliated with
a sorority, as the idea of barring so
rorities had started to grow.
Only one house, Manzanita, is
situated on the Row, the rest being
elsewhere, which gives to the unit
a classification as distinct from the
Row.
Mariposa, originally a boarding
house, was taken over by the Sigma
Kappa sorority in 1931. The soro
rity disappeared through lack of
pledges and the University bought
the house in 1933, restoring its for
mer name.
Elm Cottage was built as a private
home and also taken over by Stan
ford in 1933.
Union Residence was a gift to the
Farm by ex - President Herbert
Hoover before he was nominated for
the Presidency. It was occupied by
graduate men until 1933, when the
women took it over.
Madrono was first built as a fac
ulty house, was sold shortly after
to the Phi Delts, and afterward
made into a boarding house for
men. Herbert Hoover, during his
years on the Farm, lived for a while
in this house. The University pur
chased it in 1934.
Manzanita was originally the Oy
ster house, owned by Joseph Shil -
lington Oyster and his family. He
was one of the first commandants
of the ROTC at Stanford. The house
was bought by the Farm in 1935 and
its name changed to Manzanita.
Hawthorne was formerly the res
idence of the Rev. David Charles
Gardner, appointed by Mrs. Lelancl
Stanford as first chaplain of Memo
rial Church. It became Farm owned
in 1938.
The Oaks was the residence of
A. E. Roth, one-time Dean of Men
at Stanford and later comptroller
for the University. Roth House was
named after Roth's wife, Mildred.
The University acquired the Oaks
in 1940.

in 1938, and the Oaks in 1940.
These houses were bought by the
University in the above years and
have been owned by it ever since.
Students living in the respective
dorms all eat at the Union Resi
dence dining hall, since the houses
lack adequate kitchen facilities.
Union Unit was not a planned
idea but merely expanded as more
houses became available and more
women enrolled.
Before 1933, women's residences
included Roble Hall and nine soro
rity houses. At this time, however,
only 500 women students, including
graduate women, were enrolled. In
May of 1933 the enrollment was en
larged and Union Unit was formed.
As the number of women increased,
the unit was also enlarged to its
present size.
None of the houses, after having
been purchased, was affiliated with
a sorority, as the idea of barring so
rorities had started to grow.
Only one house, Manzanita, is
situated on the Row, the rest being
elsewhere, which gives to the unit
a classification as distinct from the
Row.
Mariposa, originally a boarding
house, was taken over by the Sigma
Kappa sorority in 1931. The soro
rity disappeared through lack of
pledges and the University bought
the house in 1933, restoring its for
mer name.
Elm Cottage was built as a private
home and also taken over by Stan
ford in 1933.
Union Residence was a gift to the
Farm by ex - President Herbert
Hoover before he was nominated for
the Presidency. It was occupied by
graduate men until 1933, when the
women took it over.
Madrono was first built as a fac
ulty house, was sold shortly after
to the Phi Delts, and afterward
made into a boarding house for
men. Herbert Hoover, during his
years on the Farm, lived for a while
in this house. The University pur
chased it in 1934.
Manzanita was originally the Oy
ster house, owned by Joseph Shil -
lington Oyster and his family. He
was one of the first commandants
of the ROTC at Stanford. The house
was bought by the Farm in 1935 and
its name changed to Manzanita.
Hawthorne was formerly the res
idence of the Rev. David Charles
Gardner, appointed by Mrs. Lelancl
Stanford as first chaplain of Memo
rial Church. It became Farm owned
in 1938.
The Oaks was the residence of
A. E. Roth, one-time Dean of Men
at Stanford and later comptroller
for the University. Roth House was
named after Roth's wife, Mildred.
The University acquired the Oaks
in 1940.
Seven residences combine today
to form the present Stanford Union
Unit — residences whose divergent
histories add greatly to the essence
of Farm lore.
By amalgamating three houses—
Union residence, Mariposa, and Elm
Cottage—in 1033, the unit started on
its way up. Madrono was added in
1934, Manzanita in 1935, Hawthorne
in 1938, and the Oaks in 1940.
