# Stadium Left In One Piece
## 
### 
The SAC Corp Yard stated yes
terday that "This is the best Big
Game we have handled in years."
Frank Phippin, assistant to Eman
uel Mac Donald, Superintendent of
Athletic Buildings and Grounds,
said that there were only about six
or seven 10- to 12-foot seating sec
tions torn out, and these all on the
Cal side.
He said that a detailed report of
the damage was being made by Mr.
Mac Donald.
"This is the smallest amount of
damage done in years," he said.
"Of course," he continued, "the
goal posts were ripped out, but this
is to be expected at every big
game." He said that the job or re
placing the uprights is a very sim
ple one.
"Probably the seats were broken
by continued jumping up and down
on them," he said. "Some of the
seats in our stadium have a great
amount of spring, and can't stand
the rough treatment given them by
jubilant rooters."
He stated that the torn seating
fragments were probably carted
home to Berkeley by a few sou
venir-minded Cal men.
Mr. Phippin concluded with the
statement, "A Corp Yard crew of
about 10 men, including carpenters,
will be kept busy until Thursday
cleaning up the stadium.
"On Thursday," he said, "Palo
Alto High plays Sequoia High on
our field."
