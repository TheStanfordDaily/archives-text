# Levintritt Oriental Art Collection Declared 'Different'
## 
### 
Stanford students who visited the
Art Gallery this week declare the
Levintritt Collection of Far Eastern
Art on display there to be one of
the most "entirely different" types
of collections they have ever seen.
Over 400 items are shown, and they
cover such a wide span of years
and are representative of so many
nations that it is easy for an ob
server to get an accurate, compos
ite picture of the art of Far Eastern
civilizations. An excellent group of
Chinese bronzes is probably as ear
ly as 1300 8.C., while four primi
tive Russian paintings are of the
19th century.
The Chinese group of the collec
tion contains excellent bronzes, cer
amics, and paintings. One of the
most interesting exhibits is a con
ventionalized, larger-than-life Ming
dynasty figure of Buddha. The
placid inscrutability of the wooden
image's expression is striking.

A Chinese tomb figurine of a
horse was praised by students as
being outstanding, because of its
strength and purity of line. It is a
lightly glazed pottery image of the
Tang dynasty, depicting a horse of
the royal house saddled and wait
ing for his master. It is effectively
placed on brilliant crimson brocade
to accent and intensify its own dull
tones.
The Venetian section is made up
I largely of baroque and rococo fur
niture, with a few paintings by
j great Italian artists: Pietro Longhi,

Francesco Guardi, and Tiepolo.
These paintings arc graphic, real
istic, in monotones, and are done in
the manner of etchings.
In the foyer of the Gallery is a
collection of Goya etchings Levin
tritt also donated to Stanford when
he presented the rest of his works
in 1941.
The Levintritt collection will re
main at the Art Gallery until Dee.
14. The Gallery is open to the pub
lic Tuesdays through Saturdays
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on Sun
days from 12 to 4 p.m.
