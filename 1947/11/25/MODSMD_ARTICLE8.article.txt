.PARIS, Nov. 24 (UP).—Premier
Robert Schuman's now centrist
government tonight proposed gen
eral wage increases in an effort to
get 1,250,000 idle workers back at
their jobs but indicated that it
would "get tough" with strikers if
this concession failed.
Wage raises were agreed upon
during an urgent four-hour cab
inet meeting following new walkouts
which halted mail deliveries and
electric trains in Paris, further crip
plcd industry and curtailed vital
food and fuel shipments to large
cities.
Minister of State Pierre Abelin
said the cabinet also decided to
"take a number of measures which
would establish public order and
liberty to work."
POLICE ON ALERT

P) financial expert, warned postal
employes they were liable to sum
mary dismissal if they remained on
strike. Troops, mobile guards, and
police were ordered on a 24-hour
alert to cope with possible trouble
from unruly communist-led mobs.
Schuman left no doubt he intend
ed to be firm with communist lead
ers, as advocated by the conserva
tive press. The influential afternoon
newspaper Lc Monde said the com
munist party "will sign its own
death warrant in public opinion and
in working class opinion if the new
government is firm in its plans and
clever in its actions ..."

to run high among Parisian subur- !
ban workers who could not get to
jobs or had to walk to them because :

employes struck.
The prefect of Lyon, second larg
est city in France, warned that he
intended to use police against com

electric trains in Paris, further crip

ed to be firm with communist lead

clever in its actions ..."
