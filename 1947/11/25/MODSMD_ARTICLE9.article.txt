Edward Goldstein and Wilbcrl
Fromhold, alias Eddie and Willie,
owners of Longbarn, yesterday he
came owners of another eating
place popular with Stanford stu
dents, Dinah's Shack.
All the necessary papers are
signed and the owners will take
over their new possession, which
they obtained for an "unannounced
figure," next Monday.
"We don't contemplate any
changes in the policy of Dinah's
Shack," announced Eddie. "The
name will remain the same. How
ever, complete dinners will be
served instead of the usual a la
carte."
