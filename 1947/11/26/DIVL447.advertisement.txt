stuffed and prepared "with all the fixin s to
taste almost as good as turkey at your own
family table. (We say "almost as good" be
cause we know it takes the family, too, to
make Thanksgiving all it can be.) However,
you who are far away from home this Thanks

waiting you at "our house." Gather your
friends about you and come on down
