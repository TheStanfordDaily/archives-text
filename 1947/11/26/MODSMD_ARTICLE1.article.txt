FARRHK, GRANNIS SPEAK
Bill Farrer and Lawrence Grannis
addressed the delegates yesterday
morning at a special assembly in
Cubberley Auditorium. Farrer and
Grannis told of their experiences in
Europe Ibis summer as ISC dele
gates to study education facilities in
Europe.
Grannis spoke of the effective
strategy of the Communists in
France. He explained that they arc
successful because they dole out
patronages in the same style as the
US political bosses in large or small
cities. They have a very reasonable
program in that they do not attack
the church which is so powerful in
France, nor do they attack the right
to keep private property or private
enterprise.
Farrer told of the stronghold which
Communism is gaining in Germany,
even in the American zone. He said
that one of the main causes for this
is that the American Military Gov
ernment. is not giving the Germans
any semblance of democracy.
