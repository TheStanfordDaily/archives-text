# People Abroad Looking to U.S.

Even in countries where Commu
nism is the strongest (outside the
Soviet bloc) the majority of the
people are turning more and more
to the United Slates as a means of
economic recovery, according to the
three members of a panel discussion
group who spoke before a Tuesday
Evening Series crowd in Memorial
Auditorium last night.
Highlighting the second day's
program of the Western College
Congress being held on the campus,
the panel covered the topic of "So
viet - American Competition in
World Reconstruction." Members of
the panel. Dr. Shau Wing Chan, the
Hon. Richard Hare, and Dr. Roberto
B. Sangiorgi, spoke on results of
competition between Russia and the
United States in countries where
world interest has been centered
most. Moderator was Dr. Philip W.
Buck.
The Communists have been losing
ground steadily in both Italy and
France, said Dr. Sangiorgi, who re
turned recently from a tour of both
countries. The Communist program,
he said, has been one of intimida
tion, propaganda, and pretending to
support the industrialists and land
owners, but Italy realizes now that
America is helping them more than
Russia.
Economic chaos in Britain might
drive the English into the Commu
nist camp, Mr. Hare asserted. Al
though the Socialist program there
is less affected by the doctrines of
Marx than similar proprams in any
other country, he said, few people
know how precariously close the
British are to economic collapse.
Soviet - American competition in
China has not been so strong as
elsewhere, said Dr. Chan, because
Communism has been known and
accepted in a large part of China
for some time.
There is no clear-cut and con
sistent American plan for China, he
said, and so far no Marshall Plan
for the Far East. Relations between
the Chinese Nationalist Govern
ment and Russia, however, have
been worsening steadily since V-J
Day, declared Dr. Chan.
