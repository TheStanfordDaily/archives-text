# Valentino Sought For Sunday Show
## 
### 
Rudolph Valentino or bust!
That is the sentiment of Bob Man
ning, Sunday evening movie man
ager. Manning had ordered a Val
entino epic for this Sunday, but the
order was' cancelled by the distribut
ing company when they discovered
1200 feet of the film missing.
Manning was requested that some
movie be available for the Sunday
showing, and that it be a Valentino
movie if at all possible.
Flash Gordon will be shown at
any rate, and there will also be
short subjects.
