# New Union Proposal Offered for Student Analysis
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
Somehow it would seem that if
the students of Stanford want a new
student union they should go about
it in a big .way.
"In a big way" would mean pub
licizing the proposed fund - raising
program, raising money by direct
means, and, in general, letting each
Stanford student know what is
planned, how much it will cost him
individually, and when he can. ex
pect to sec the results of his pay
ments.
The student should know these
things because it will be his union.
Students can't vote yes or no on
the question "Do you want a new
student union?" unless they have
some common definition of what the
question means.
No one has provided them with
that definition yet.
The following plan is not printed
with the thought that it should be
followed. Instead, it is offered as a
basis for further plans. It can be
the program of which you, as stu
dents, can say—"l don't like it" or
j "I think it is partially acceptable
| but with these improvements."
First, what do we mean by a stu
j dent union? A student union should
contain (a) a place to cat, (b) a
place to dance, (c) a social room
for informal meetings, (d) club
meeting rooms, (e) ASSU offices,
(112) a trophy room, and (g) a read
ing room with files of all campus
publications.

(Sep editorial on page four to
day concerning this article.)

Other possibilities for inclusion in
j a union would be bowling alleys, a
barber shop, a news stand-candy
I store, ;i snack bar, pool tables, etc.

Where would it be?
The present plans of the Univer
sity building program place the un
ion (and all student activities) in
an area between the Row and Roble
centered roughly across from the
fi rehouse.
Next, when would it be built? If
students are to start financing it
now it, should be built at a not-too
distant date. Certainly not later
than 15 years from the time the
fund is started.
So let's assume that we will build
a new union in (ho year 1963.
How much will it cost? Building
costs are ever-changing. It is im
possible to draw plans now and pre
dict the price of a building 15 years
from today. But the architectural
plans can wait until 1962.
The preliminary plans need not
be so rigid that it would be expen
sive to alter them.
At Excom an estimate of one and
one-half million was made concern
ing the cost of a new student union.
Let's for the sake of the discussion
arbitrarily decide that we want a
union costing $1,200,000.
Thus, our basic assumption is that
we will build a $1,200,000 student
union in 1963 across from the firc
house.
There are two ways to finance it:
(1) Raise half the money before
11)63 and borrow the balance, which
will be paid off in union profits.
(2) Raise all the money before
1963.
Number one involves borrowing
and paying interest. This is costly,
as shown in the case of Memorial
Hall, where over $100,000 was paid
in interest.
So let's use number 2 proposal in
our plan. So now the question be
comes how will we raise $1,200,000

in 15 years. Or $80,000 annually.
The "Mem Aud" dollar should
| be placed in this fund. It has al
: ready been announced that this ac-
I lion was contemplated. This amounts
| to about $25,000 a year.
The next large annual sum could
| come from an entirely new source —
a highly controversial source. And
! a source with which city adminis
trators arc familiar.
A tax, perhaps 3 per cent, could
be levied by the ASSU on all pro
grams or events presented by Stan
ford students. This would include
the Gaieties, dramas, football games,
operas, etc.
This would be a source of income
equal to, and probably greater than,
the "Mem Aud dollar." This has
the advantage of being flexible in
that the lax rate could be increased
or decreased depending upon the
I net profits of student activities and
! in view of the annual goal of
I $80,000.
An alternative suggestion to this
would be to have each organization
qive the net proceeds from one per
formance each year, assuming that
it had more than four performances
i annually, to the student union
| fund.
For instance, Ram's' Head could
i turn the proceeds over from one
t night's Gaieties —or could have an
i extra show for that purpose.
Biggest objection to such a plan
would come from the athletic de
j partment, which would lose the
profits from one football game each
I season.
Lesser sources of additional in
come could be: (1) Organization
dues — a one - cent assessment per
member per quarter on all campus
chartered organizations.
(2) Assessments on all campus

social affairs based on a graduated
scale —$1 for small closed activities
up to $20 for an all-campus dance.
(3) Interest from the fund, as sug
gested by the student manager,
which would amount to about $25,-
000 during (ho fund's growth.
Other highly profitable projects
would be campus-wide control of
coke machines and the installation
of Bendix-type washers in living
groups by the union fund commit
tee.
Perhaps a redistribution the
'Union dollar could be arranged. Bui
this would br highly debatable as
the women's equivalent of this dol
lar is needed lo support the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a non-profit enter
prise.
Once built, the union should op
erate on a non-profit basis. Any
small profits could he turned over
to an ASSU fund to be used for all
campus affairs.
The entire present Union could
become an "International House''
temporarily alleviating the need for
one.
The handling of the fund could be
entrusted to a "new student union
fund" manager working with the
student manager but not under him
as their work would never overlap.
He wopld have assistants to han
dle the different departments -mu
sic, speech and drama, athletics, etc.
He would also have assistants to su
pervise the various lesser sources
of income.
Collection of these monies should
not cost more than 1 per cent of
the total intake, judging by similar
projects.
This plan itself perhaps is not
worth considering.
But no plan less definite should
be even contemplated.

or decreased depending upon the
I net profits of student activities and
! in view of the annual goal of
I $80,000.
An alternative suggestion to this
would be to have each organization
qive the net proceeds from one per
formance each year, assuming that
it had more than four performances
i annually, to the student union
| fund.
For instance, Ram's' Head could
i turn the proceeds over from one
t night's Gaieties —or could have an
i extra show for that purpose.
Biggest objection to such a plan
would come from the athletic de
j partment, which would lose the
profits from one football game each
I season.
Lesser sources of additional in
come could be: (1) Organization
dues — a one - cent assessment per
member per quarter on all campus
chartered organizations.
(2) Assessments on all campus

social affairs based on a graduated
scale —$1 for small closed activities
up to $20 for an all-campus dance.
(3) Interest from the fund, as sug
gested by the student manager,
which would amount to about $25,-
000 during (ho fund's growth.
Other highly profitable projects
would be campus-wide control of
coke machines and the installation
of Bendix-type washers in living
groups by the union fund commit
tee.
Perhaps a redistribution the
'Union dollar could be arranged. Bui
this would br highly debatable as
the women's equivalent of this dol
lar is needed lo support the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a non-profit enter
prise.
Once built, the union should op
erate on a non-profit basis. Any
small profits could he turned over
to an ASSU fund to be used for all
campus affairs.
The entire present Union could
become an "International House''
temporarily alleviating the need for
one.
The handling of the fund could be
entrusted to a "new student union
fund" manager working with the
student manager but not under him
as their work would never overlap.
He wopld have assistants to han
dle the different departments -mu
sic, speech and drama, athletics, etc.
He would also have assistants to su
pervise the various lesser sources
of income.
Collection of these monies should
not cost more than 1 per cent of
the total intake, judging by similar
projects.
This plan itself perhaps is not
worth considering.
But no plan less definite should
be even contemplated.
Somehow it would seem that if
the students of Stanford want a new
student union they should go about
it in a big .way.
"In a big way" would mean pub
licizing the proposed fund - raising
program, raising money by direct
means, and, in general, letting each
Stanford student know what is
planned, how much it will cost him
individually, and when he can. ex
pect to sec the results of his pay
ments.
The student should know these
things because it will be his union.
Students can't vote yes or no on
the question "Do you want a new
student union?" unless they have
some common definition of what the
question means.
No one has provided them with
that definition yet.
The following plan is not printed
with the thought that it should be
followed. Instead, it is offered as a
basis for further plans. It can be
the program of which you, as stu
dents, can say—"l don't like it" or
j "I think it is partially acceptable
| but with these improvements."
First, what do we mean by a stu
j dent union? A student union should
contain (a) a place to cat, (b) a
place to dance, (c) a social room
for informal meetings, (d) club
meeting rooms, (e) ASSU offices,
(112) a trophy room, and (g) a read
ing room with files of all campus
publications.

(Sep editorial on page four to
day concerning this article.)

Other possibilities for inclusion in
j a union would be bowling alleys, a
barber shop, a news stand-candy
I store, ;i snack bar, pool tables, etc.

Where would it be?
The present plans of the Univer
sity building program place the un
ion (and all student activities) in
an area between the Row and Roble
centered roughly across from the
fi rehouse.
Next, when would it be built? If
students are to start financing it
now it, should be built at a not-too
distant date. Certainly not later
than 15 years from the time the
fund is started.
So let's assume that we will build
a new union in (ho year 1963.
How much will it cost? Building
costs are ever-changing. It is im
possible to draw plans now and pre
dict the price of a building 15 years
from today. But the architectural
plans can wait until 1962.
The preliminary plans need not
be so rigid that it would be expen
sive to alter them.
At Excom an estimate of one and
one-half million was made concern
ing the cost of a new student union.
Let's for the sake of the discussion
arbitrarily decide that we want a
union costing $1,200,000.
Thus, our basic assumption is that
we will build a $1,200,000 student
union in 1963 across from the firc
house.
There are two ways to finance it:
(1) Raise half the money before
11)63 and borrow the balance, which
will be paid off in union profits.
(2) Raise all the money before
1963.
Number one involves borrowing
and paying interest. This is costly,
as shown in the case of Memorial
Hall, where over $100,000 was paid
in interest.
So let's use number 2 proposal in
our plan. So now the question be
comes how will we raise $1,200,000

in 15 years. Or $80,000 annually.
The "Mem Aud" dollar should
| be placed in this fund. It has al
: ready been announced that this ac-
I lion was contemplated. This amounts
| to about $25,000 a year.
The next large annual sum could
| come from an entirely new source —
a highly controversial source. And
! a source with which city adminis
trators arc familiar.
A tax, perhaps 3 per cent, could
be levied by the ASSU on all pro
grams or events presented by Stan
ford students. This would include
the Gaieties, dramas, football games,
operas, etc.
This would be a source of income
equal to, and probably greater than,
the "Mem Aud dollar." This has
the advantage of being flexible in
that the lax rate could be increased
or decreased depending upon the
I net profits of student activities and
! in view of the annual goal of
I $80,000.

now it, should be built at a not-too
distant date. Certainly not later
than 15 years from the time the
fund is started.
So let's assume that we will build
a new union in (ho year 1963.
How much will it cost? Building
costs are ever-changing. It is im
possible to draw plans now and pre
dict the price of a building 15 years
from today. But the architectural
plans can wait until 1962.
The preliminary plans need not
be so rigid that it would be expen
sive to alter them.
At Excom an estimate of one and
one-half million was made concern
ing the cost of a new student union.
Let's for the sake of the discussion
arbitrarily decide that we want a
union costing $1,200,000.
Thus, our basic assumption is that
we will build a $1,200,000 student
union in 1963 across from the firc
house.
There are two ways to finance it:
(1) Raise half the money before
11)63 and borrow the balance, which
will be paid off in union profits.
(2) Raise all the money before
1963.
Number one involves borrowing
and paying interest. This is costly,
as shown in the case of Memorial
Hall, where over $100,000 was paid
in interest.
So let's use number 2 proposal in
our plan. So now the question be
comes how will we raise $1,200,000

in 15 years. Or $80,000 annually.
The "Mem Aud" dollar should
| be placed in this fund. It has al
: ready been announced that this ac-
I lion was contemplated. This amounts
| to about $25,000 a year.
The next large annual sum could
| come from an entirely new source —
a highly controversial source. And
! a source with which city adminis
trators arc familiar.
A tax, perhaps 3 per cent, could
be levied by the ASSU on all pro
grams or events presented by Stan
ford students. This would include
the Gaieties, dramas, football games,
operas, etc.
This would be a source of income
equal to, and probably greater than,
the "Mem Aud dollar." This has
the advantage of being flexible in
that the lax rate could be increased
or decreased depending upon the
I net profits of student activities and
! in view of the annual goal of
I $80,000.
An alternative suggestion to this
would be to have each organization
qive the net proceeds from one per
formance each year, assuming that
it had more than four performances
i annually, to the student union
| fund.
For instance, Ram's' Head could
i turn the proceeds over from one
t night's Gaieties —or could have an
i extra show for that purpose.
Biggest objection to such a plan
would come from the athletic de
j partment, which would lose the
profits from one football game each
I season.
Lesser sources of additional in
come could be: (1) Organization
dues — a one - cent assessment per
member per quarter on all campus
chartered organizations.
(2) Assessments on all campus

social affairs based on a graduated
scale —$1 for small closed activities
up to $20 for an all-campus dance.
(3) Interest from the fund, as sug
gested by the student manager,
which would amount to about $25,-
000 during (ho fund's growth.
Other highly profitable projects
would be campus-wide control of
coke machines and the installation
of Bendix-type washers in living
groups by the union fund commit
tee.
Perhaps a redistribution the
'Union dollar could be arranged. Bui
this would br highly debatable as
the women's equivalent of this dol
lar is needed lo support the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a non-profit enter
prise.
Once built, the union should op
erate on a non-profit basis. Any
small profits could he turned over
to an ASSU fund to be used for all
campus affairs.
The entire present Union could
become an "International House''
temporarily alleviating the need for
one.
The handling of the fund could be
entrusted to a "new student union
fund" manager working with the
student manager but not under him
as their work would never overlap.
He wopld have assistants to han
dle the different departments -mu
sic, speech and drama, athletics, etc.
He would also have assistants to su
pervise the various lesser sources
of income.
Collection of these monies should
not cost more than 1 per cent of
the total intake, judging by similar
projects.
This plan itself perhaps is not
worth considering.
But no plan less definite should
be even contemplated.
Somehow it would seem that if
the students of Stanford want a new
student union they should go about
it in a big .way.
"In a big way" would mean pub
licizing the proposed fund - raising
program, raising money by direct
means, and, in general, letting each
Stanford student know what is
planned, how much it will cost him
individually, and when he can. ex
pect to sec the results of his pay
ments.
The student should know these
things because it will be his union.
Students can't vote yes or no on
the question "Do you want a new
student union?" unless they have
some common definition of what the
question means.
No one has provided them with
that definition yet.
The following plan is not printed
with the thought that it should be
followed. Instead, it is offered as a
basis for further plans. It can be
the program of which you, as stu
dents, can say—"l don't like it" or
j "I think it is partially acceptable
| but with these improvements."
First, what do we mean by a stu
j dent union? A student union should
contain (a) a place to cat, (b) a
place to dance, (c) a social room
for informal meetings, (d) club
meeting rooms, (e) ASSU offices,
(112) a trophy room, and (g) a read
ing room with files of all campus
publications.

(Sep editorial on page four to
day concerning this article.)

Other possibilities for inclusion in
j a union would be bowling alleys, a
barber shop, a news stand-candy
I store, ;i snack bar, pool tables, etc.

Where would it be?
The present plans of the Univer
sity building program place the un
ion (and all student activities) in
an area between the Row and Roble
centered roughly across from the
fi rehouse.
Next, when would it be built? If

student manager but not under him
as their work would never overlap.
He wopld have assistants to han
dle the different departments -mu
sic, speech and drama, athletics, etc.
He would also have assistants to su
pervise the various lesser sources
of income.
Collection of these monies should
not cost more than 1 per cent of
the total intake, judging by similar
projects.
This plan itself perhaps is not
worth considering.
But no plan less definite should
be even contemplated.
Somehow it would seem that if
the students of Stanford want a new
student union they should go about
it in a big .way.
"In a big way" would mean pub
licizing the proposed fund - raising
program, raising money by direct
means, and, in general, letting each
Stanford student know what is
planned, how much it will cost him
individually, and when he can. ex
pect to sec the results of his pay
ments.
The student should know these
things because it will be his union.
Students can't vote yes or no on
the question "Do you want a new
student union?" unless they have
some common definition of what the
question means.
No one has provided them with
that definition yet.
The following plan is not printed
with the thought that it should be
followed. Instead, it is offered as a
basis for further plans. It can be
the program of which you, as stu
dents, can say—"l don't like it" or
j "I think it is partially acceptable
| but with these improvements."
First, what do we mean by a stu
j dent union? A student union should
contain (a) a place to cat, (b) a
place to dance, (c) a social room
for informal meetings, (d) club
meeting rooms, (e) ASSU offices,
(112) a trophy room, and (g) a read
ing room with files of all campus
publications.

day concerning this article.)

Other possibilities for inclusion in
j a union would be bowling alleys, a
barber shop, a news stand-candy
I store, ;i snack bar, pool tables, etc.

Where would it be?
The present plans of the Univer
sity building program place the un
ion (and all student activities) in
an area between the Row and Roble
centered roughly across from the
fi rehouse.
Next, when would it be built? If
students are to start financing it
now it, should be built at a not-too
distant date. Certainly not later
than 15 years from the time the
fund is started.
So let's assume that we will build
a new union in (ho year 1963.
How much will it cost? Building
costs are ever-changing. It is im
possible to draw plans now and pre
dict the price of a building 15 years
from today. But the architectural
plans can wait until 1962.
The preliminary plans need not
be so rigid that it would be expen
sive to alter them.
At Excom an estimate of one and
one-half million was made concern
ing the cost of a new student union.
Let's for the sake of the discussion
arbitrarily decide that we want a
union costing $1,200,000.
Thus, our basic assumption is that
we will build a $1,200,000 student
union in 1963 across from the firc
house.
There are two ways to finance it:
(1) Raise half the money before
11)63 and borrow the balance, which
will be paid off in union profits.
(2) Raise all the money before
1963.
Number one involves borrowing
and paying interest. This is costly,
as shown in the case of Memorial
Hall, where over $100,000 was paid
in interest.
So let's use number 2 proposal in
our plan. So now the question be
comes how will we raise $1,200,000

in 15 years. Or $80,000 annually.
The "Mem Aud" dollar should
| be placed in this fund. It has al
: ready been announced that this ac-
I lion was contemplated. This amounts
| to about $25,000 a year.
The next large annual sum could
| come from an entirely new source —
a highly controversial source. And
! a source with which city adminis
trators arc familiar.
A tax, perhaps 3 per cent, could
be levied by the ASSU on all pro
grams or events presented by Stan
ford students. This would include
the Gaieties, dramas, football games,
operas, etc.
This would be a source of income
equal to, and probably greater than,
the "Mem Aud dollar." This has
the advantage of being flexible in
that the lax rate could be increased
or decreased depending upon the
I net profits of student activities and
! in view of the annual goal of
I $80,000.
An alternative suggestion to this
would be to have each organization
qive the net proceeds from one per
formance each year, assuming that
it had more than four performances
i annually, to the student union
| fund.
For instance, Ram's' Head could
i turn the proceeds over from one
t night's Gaieties —or could have an
i extra show for that purpose.
Biggest objection to such a plan
would come from the athletic de
j partment, which would lose the
profits from one football game each
I season.
Lesser sources of additional in
come could be: (1) Organization
dues — a one - cent assessment per
member per quarter on all campus
chartered organizations.
(2) Assessments on all campus

social affairs based on a graduated
scale —$1 for small closed activities
up to $20 for an all-campus dance.
(3) Interest from the fund, as sug
gested by the student manager,
which would amount to about $25,-
000 during (ho fund's growth.
Other highly profitable projects
would be campus-wide control of
coke machines and the installation
of Bendix-type washers in living
groups by the union fund commit
tee.
Perhaps a redistribution the
'Union dollar could be arranged. Bui
this would br highly debatable as
the women's equivalent of this dol
lar is needed lo support the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a non-profit enter
prise.
Once built, the union should op
erate on a non-profit basis. Any
small profits could he turned over
to an ASSU fund to be used for all
campus affairs.
The entire present Union could
become an "International House''
temporarily alleviating the need for
one.
The handling of the fund could be
entrusted to a "new student union
fund" manager working with the
student manager but not under him
as their work would never overlap.
He wopld have assistants to han
dle the different departments -mu
sic, speech and drama, athletics, etc.
