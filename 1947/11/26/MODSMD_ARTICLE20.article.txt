# 'Fortyniners' Grow Beards
## 
### 
It will be a "whoop and holler"
day for the class of '49 on Friday,
Dec. 5, when the juniors don the
garb of the gold rush period and the
males appear on the Quad with
beards.
"This event is something new for
the Stanfordites who will graduate
the year of the gold rush centen
nial," states Mimi Dunlap who.
with Jerry Politzer, is heading the
event.
The day will be lopped off by a
hay-ride to Mangini's Barn, where
the '49-er folk will be "a-dancin'
and a-prancin'" to the jazz of a
four-piece orchestra from 9 p.m. to
1 a.m. "And it's all for nothing,"
says Miss Dunlap.
All junior men are expected to
throw away their razors over the
Thanksgiving vacation, added the
chairman, Prizes will bo awarded
by Palo Alto merchants for the best
costume and the longest beard.
The hay-ride and barn dance will
be a no-date affair, and time and
place to meet will be announced
later by the committee. Refresh
ments will be served at the barn.
A barber will be present, contem
plating that many of the whisker
faced men will be "itchin' to Ret a
shave.''
