### MARY KRAFT 
"Nine times defeated, they never lost the will to win . . . Theirs
is the true Stanford spirit," are the words on the plaque to hf;
given to the 1947 football team, Tom Martzloff said at the post
season rally in Union Court last night.
This rally was born of pride in the team and the student body,
the student body president told tin*

large and enthusiastic crowd.
"Stanford spirit has proved thai
it is true amateur football when yon
don't have to v/in games to think this
is the best school in the country,"
he continued.
Spontanous "no's" answered hi:,
question: "After this game, I bet
you wouldn't trade Stanford for 500
other schools."
Then the student body president,
speaking slowly and with emotion,
read the words which will be in
scribed on a plakuc to be presented
to the team:
"The Associated Students honot
the 1947 football team ami their
coach, Mnrchmont Schwartz. Nine
times defeated, they never lost tlw
will to win. Theirs is the true
Stanford spiiit."
Students sent from Cal to covcr
the rally exclaimed, "Gosh, what
school!"
"We want Marchie!" the crowd
started to chant, but Marchie wasn't
there, explained Jack Davies, head
yell leader. "He sent his deepest,
regrets that he was unable to come
and said that he is very deeply
touched by this gesture of the stu
dents."
"For the last time this season wc
want to give the coach yell," Davies
said, and the familiar yell sounded
out, honoring the man who led "the
greatest Stanford team since Frankie
Albert."
"It used to be the custom to
cheer for the graduating players
when they came out of the gamÂ«-,
hut the new substitution ruling
has prevented this; so we want to
honor them now," Davies said
An instantaneous yell went up for
George Quist, Ainslie Bell, and all
the others who played their last,
and greatest game for Stanford Sat
urday. The team was there, but
modesty kept them from corning for
, ward to receive the applause.
After the rally, though, Quist and
Martzloff posed, bashfully smiling
for photographers from San Fran
cisco papers.
Hie band struck up the strains of
the Stanford Hymn, and with thn
booming of "Hail Stanford, Hail" thn
football season officially ended.
The thousand students who had
come to pay homage to the under
dogs who played out their hearts and
lost by but three points in the great
est Big Game of all, walked away,
still cheering.


TOM MARTZLOFF: "The tni<
Stanford spirit."
