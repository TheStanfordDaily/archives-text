In the two decades between 1923
Mid 1! 43, if you entered the spa
cious lobby of the Knoll, chances
are that you would not have been
by the do re mi of a piano
and violin practice. Then, Mrs. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, late wife of the
burner Stanford President, would
usher tiie visitor up the circular
• lone staircase to attend one of the
many receptions held at their home.
The Knoll was built in 1923 by
the University for the use of Dr.
Wilbur because there was no ade
quate residence for the President at
that time, partly due to the housing
• hnrlat>e caused by World War I.
Me. Wilbur helped in the planning
of the impressive three-story build
in;' and it.s extensive gardens.
Miss Anastasia Doyle, assistant
counsejor for women, reminiscing
over old times, told of the numerous
■ /rial affairs which took place at
the Knoll:
"Floodlights would always bright
en up the steps leading to the house
and the beautiful heather - edged
walk," she remembered.
John Weston, Knoll gardener for

the past 25 years, also reminisced
about life in the 'thirties:
"We used to have three men
working here, and lots of extra help
besides. All the students used to
come up here to visit and dance out
on a platform placed in the court
yard."
"You should never go away from
the Peninsula," he urged; "there's
a wonderful climate, and all the
flowers grow here—but lately people
come and break them," he conclud
ed disappointedly.
In 1943, when Dr. Wilbur ceased
to be President and became Chan
cellor, he moved to his present
home on Gerona Drive, and the
Knoll was used for housing mili
tary personnel. For the first year
about 40 WACs, who were taking
physical therapy training, roomed
there, and they were followed in
1944 by a group of Army officers.
A number of graduate women
then took over the Knoll in 1945,
and lived there until, in the fall of
194G, the music department moved
in. The third floor is still being
used for housing, this time for
members of the University staff.

Upon entering the lobby now you
first would see a large bulletin
board complete with University in
formation. However, full - length
mirrors and beautiful paintings arc
.still evident on many of the walls,
as a reminder of the old atmosphere.
The huge ballroom, which was
occasionally used for special events
in the "old days," is now fully
equipped for a music lecture hall:
two pianos and many desk chairs
constitute the furniture. In the
spring of 1946 the senior class held
its annual ball there.
The whole second floor, which
was mainly used for official enter
taining by the Wilburs, is now oc
cupied by offices, classrooms, listen
ing-rooms, and is also used for
meetings.
The view from the Knoll still
presents one of the prettiest pic
tures of the campus.

( (tiu a show place with its extensive gardens and excellent view. In turn it has served as a private home,
Lome for WAC's, army officers, and graduate women. ■ —Photo by Francis Geddes

Miss Anastasia Doyle, assistant
counsejor for women, reminiscing
over old times, told of the numerous
■ /rial affairs which took place at
the Knoll:
"Floodlights would always bright
en up the steps leading to the house
and the beautiful heather - edged
walk," she remembered.
John Weston, Knoll gardener for

the past 25 years, also reminisced
about life in the 'thirties:
"We used to have three men
working here, and lots of extra help
besides. All the students used to
come up here to visit and dance out
on a platform placed in the court
yard."
"You should never go away from
the Peninsula," he urged; "there's
a wonderful climate, and all the
flowers grow here—but lately people
come and break them," he conclud
ed disappointedly.
In 1943, when Dr. Wilbur ceased
to be President and became Chan
cellor, he moved to his present
home on Gerona Drive, and the
Knoll was used for housing mili
tary personnel. For the first year
about 40 WACs, who were taking
physical therapy training, roomed
there, and they were followed in
1944 by a group of Army officers.
A number of graduate women
then took over the Knoll in 1945,
and lived there until, in the fall of
194G, the music department moved
in. The third floor is still being
used for housing, this time for
members of the University staff.

Upon entering the lobby now you
first would see a large bulletin
board complete with University in
formation. However, full - length
mirrors and beautiful paintings arc
.still evident on many of the walls,
as a reminder of the old atmosphere.
The huge ballroom, which was
occasionally used for special events
in the "old days," is now fully
equipped for a music lecture hall:
two pianos and many desk chairs
constitute the furniture. In the
spring of 1946 the senior class held
its annual ball there.
The whole second floor, which
was mainly used for official enter
taining by the Wilburs, is now oc
cupied by offices, classrooms, listen
ing-rooms, and is also used for
meetings.
The view from the Knoll still
presents one of the prettiest pic
tures of the campus.
