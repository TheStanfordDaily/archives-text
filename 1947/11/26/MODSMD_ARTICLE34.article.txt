# Card Cagers Impress In OC Victory
## 
### HOWIE RIPER 
Stanford's basketball team made
it two in a Vow as it rolled to an
easy 76 to 40 victory over the San
Francisco Olympic Club in the Pa
vilion last night.
The Indians showed definite im
provement over their lack - luster
performance against the alumni on
Monday night. Their passes were
clicking, long shots and layups were
hitting the nets for baskets, and all
told, Coach Everett Dean's cagers
put on a very impressive showing
against a good Olympic quintet.
INDIANS ROLL
With the score tied at 8-all at the
end of four minutes of play, the
Indians rolled into high gear. Set
shots by Thompson and Davidson
and layups by Stephenson and Rose
built up a 22-9 lead for Stanford;
after that, it was merely a question
of what the final score would be.
Stanford led at half-time by a
I>l to 18 count. Bill Rose was top
man for the Indians in the first half
with 10 points, most of them scored
on clever passes from center Bill
Stephenson, who sparked the team
all evening. It was Stephenson who,
together with Dave Davidson and
captain Babe Higgins, controlled
the backboards for Stanford, and it
was Stephenson at the center pivot
position around whom the Dean
men's offense was built.
The second half started fast with
Higyins, Stephenson, and Davidson
driving in lor quick baskets. Half
way through this period, Coach
Dean inserted his "little team" com
posed of Milt Iverson, Gus Chava
las, Bob Lewis, Bob Penn, and Bill
Drehobl.
USE FAST BREAK
This, team wasted no time in
making full use of its fast break as
it increased the score over the tir
ing Olympic quintet. Reserves
George Yardly, Ralph Carver, and
John Scharfen also helped add to
the Indians' offensive total.
Stephenson led the Stanford scor
ers with 13 points, while Iverson
had 11, and Rose chalked up 10. Joe
Mirkovich was high scorer for the
Olympic Club with 13 points, and
teammate Bud Lame had 7.
Last night's win was doubly im
portant in view of the Indians' un
impressive showing against the
alumni the previous evening.
