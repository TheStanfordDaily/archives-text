# THE 						SPACE

You can live alone and like it, like
if, like it.
You can live alone and hate it, hate

You can live alone and love it, love
it, love it,
It all depends on whom you live
alone with.
—Jean I.

all in, give me time, don't have
much space in The Space.—Ed.

Remember, every work of art
printed here is preserved for pos
terity in the files of the Stanford
Daily. What a situation!
