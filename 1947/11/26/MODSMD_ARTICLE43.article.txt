# The 						Daily's Purpose
## 
### 
On page one there appears a basic plan for
a new student union.
This has been printed not because The Daily
prefers to have a new student union instead of
a pavilion or for that matter, either.
It has been done as action is now being taken
to begin a "new student union fund."
This action shouldn't be taken unless the
Stanford students have a chance to discuss it.
However, they can not discuss intelligently
a plan which is shrouded in clouds of miscon
ceptions.
If the article as written forces the advocates

of a new student union fund to make a clear
counter-proposal it will have accomplished its
purpose.
Or if it makes the Stanford students think and
with those thoughts decide not to back a plan
for a student union it will have accomplished
its purpose.
But if the students of Stanford allow their
representatives to go ahead with their indefinite,
hazy plans for a "new student union fund"—
without coming out and telling the student
body exactly what they have in mind, The
Daily will not have accomplished its purpose.
