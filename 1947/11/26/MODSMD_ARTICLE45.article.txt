# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
What a tremendous game.
All right, so I'm four days late in shouting about
it I just got my voice back. Games that are played
like that should be talked about all season anyway.
Maybe faith doesn't move mountains, but it cer
tainly gives strength to those who are in the process of
moving mountains.
What I saw from the stands seemed to be a psy
chological phenomenon, and a physical impossibility.
You just don't improve on physical talent any more
than you can speed up reaction time. What you can
do is key up spirit to a point where the maximum talent
is displayed.
Marehie seems to have purged the team with a
mental enema. And I don't mean they played the
game with mind and spirit alone. It merely set the
stage for the ability they showed.
As one rooter near me said:
"I hope they don't think of giving our boys the
saliva test." He had a point. Maybe Marehie had
been putting stuff in their coffee.
Mental attitude, like a zipper, can be your undoing.

It likewise can be the basis and cause of tremendous
physical effort, as was well proved Saturday.
Over on the Cal side, except for a few moments,
the only sign of life was a 1942 issue that some fresh
man brought to read during the half-time. An the
Cal team responded the same way.
But the spirit that was in the Stanford team was
also in the Stanford rooters. At the first of the game
they yelled for Stanford when Cal marched through
our line. They yelled for Stanford when Stanford's
heretofore best ground gaining play, a fake pass and
handoff, failed to make an inch.
And they stood up, applaudde, and yelled some
more when Stanford came back up the field after Cal's
lirst score.
But when Keckly caught that last Cal pass and
scored, a lady near me broke down and cried like a
woman on her !Joth birthday:
"They don't deserve itâ€”tj?ey just don't deserve it."
she said, and her tears were a fitting tribute to a team
that lost but was not beaten.
