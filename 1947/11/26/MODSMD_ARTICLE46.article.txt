# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Suggestion 
### 
To the Editor:
I here is at the moment considerable agitation in
The Daily concerning the $40,000 annual Union profit.
Now that we have finally gotten in the clear on the
Memorial Auditorium fiasco, some propose that we
immediately plunge in again with a new Union or a
basketball pavilion. Some alternatives, such as scholar
ships, faculty chairs, etc., have also been proposed.
I feel that an alternative remains unexplored which
offers by far the greatest benefit to those most in
timately concerned, who are asked to underwrite these
ventures.
For a long time the high cost of living has been
blamed for 150 cent milkshakes and 2. r > cent sandwiches,
in spite of the fact that the materials for these still
cost only 10 to 20 percent of the price, and labor
hardly more, on the basis of retail prices in town.
Now it is apparent that we are merely maintaining an
extraordinary profit for the benefit of vague and
grandiose schemes of little necessity or economic
justification.
I propose a constitutional amendment which would
require that the Union be operated at cost, and all
income returned to its operating fund. The prices
should be accordingly lowered to a fair and reasonable
value perhaps two-thirds of their present level.
It is hardly fair to ask those of us who must eat
at the Cellar to pay for vast projects of benefit (?)
equally to everyone, nor does it seem proper in these
days of inflation to embark on any long-range building
program, since the money is far more necessary to p.iy
ioi the necessities of fixed-income students than to

fatten the already bloated pockets of tlie notorious
building trades.
Moreover, as the present facilities of the Union are
not used to capacity, the Nitery for instance, the need
of a new Union is not at all clear. It would certainly
not fill a need proportionate to its cost.
The basketball pavilion is a good idea, but. this
could properly be financed by a bond issue and repaid
out of admission prices by those who benefit from it.
There is no justification for the students having to
make another free gift to the University, particularly
to the fat Athletic department.
The scholarships and academic chairs are worthier,
but here again the benefits will be restricted to a very
small number, while the costs will be born by many
who can hardly afford such charities.
In conclusion, therefore, a non-profit store and res
taurant seems the best way to use these funds, and the
only one economically or morally justified.

For a long time the high cost of living has been
blamed for 150 cent milkshakes and 2. r > cent sandwiches,
in spite of the fact that the materials for these still
cost only 10 to 20 percent of the price, and labor
hardly more, on the basis of retail prices in town.
Now it is apparent that we are merely maintaining an
extraordinary profit for the benefit of vague and
grandiose schemes of little necessity or economic
justification.
I propose a constitutional amendment which would
require that the Union be operated at cost, and all
income returned to its operating fund. The prices
should be accordingly lowered to a fair and reasonable
value perhaps two-thirds of their present level.
It is hardly fair to ask those of us who must eat
at the Cellar to pay for vast projects of benefit (?)
equally to everyone, nor does it seem proper in these
days of inflation to embark on any long-range building
program, since the money is far more necessary to p.iy
ioi the necessities of fixed-income students than to

fatten the already bloated pockets of tlie notorious
building trades.
Moreover, as the present facilities of the Union are
not used to capacity, the Nitery for instance, the need
of a new Union is not at all clear. It would certainly
not fill a need proportionate to its cost.
The basketball pavilion is a good idea, but. this
could properly be financed by a bond issue and repaid
out of admission prices by those who benefit from it.
There is no justification for the students having to
make another free gift to the University, particularly
to the fat Athletic department.
The scholarships and academic chairs are worthier,
but here again the benefits will be restricted to a very
small number, while the costs will be born by many
who can hardly afford such charities.
In conclusion, therefore, a non-profit store and res
taurant seems the best way to use these funds, and the
only one economically or morally justified.

To the Editor:
I here is at the moment considerable agitation in
The Daily concerning the $40,000 annual Union profit.
Now that we have finally gotten in the clear on the
Memorial Auditorium fiasco, some propose that we
immediately plunge in again with a new Union or a
basketball pavilion. Some alternatives, such as scholar
ships, faculty chairs, etc., have also been proposed.
I feel that an alternative remains unexplored which
offers by far the greatest benefit to those most in
timately concerned, who are asked to underwrite these
ventures.
