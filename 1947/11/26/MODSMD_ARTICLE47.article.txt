# A 						Bouquet
## 
### 
To the Editor:
May the mere wife of a Stanford student butt into
your columns long enough to pass on a bouquet
to The Daily from an ex-colleague of hers in the
newspaper business, hack in England?
He is a sub-editor or rewrite man, on the Bristol
Evening World. Says he . . .
"... I enjoyed the Stanford Dailys you sent. In
fact, 1 learned a great deal more about American life
from them than from a dozen articles or columns by
the New York correspondents of London papers.''
O.K. boys. Just thought you might be interested.
