# Sell-Rationing Of Fuel Asked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 (UP).â€”
An administration spokesman said
today that motorists will be asked
shortly to curtail pleasure driving
as part of a voluntary fuel conser
vation program. At the same time
he petitioned Congress for authortiy
to enforce rationing and price con
trols on oil and coal if voluntary
measures fail to head off a threat
ened winter shortage.
The government's plan for coping
with the furl crisis was revealed to
the House Banking Committee by
Undersecretary of the Interior Os
car L. Chapman.
He said the department soon will
announce a voluntary oil - saving
plan which it hopes will make it
unnecessary to revive rationing.
But he said the administration
should be armed with mandatory
powers if the program should fail.
He said the coal and oil situations
are "explosive in the present infla
tionary atmosphere" and that "a
disturbance in either field could
create serious supply and price
problems."
Chapman testified that supply and
demand for coal is* "just about, in
balance," but that demand for oil
is running ahead of supplies.
He said the voluntary conserva
tion program now being prepared
would try to fill the requirements of
oil consumers in the order of their
urgency, with pleasure motoring at
the bottom of the list.
