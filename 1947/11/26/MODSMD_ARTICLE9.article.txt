### 
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 25 (UP).—
Petroleum industry spokesmen to
day said rationing of gasoline—ei
ther voluntary or mandatory—was
unnecessary on the West Coast.
They were commenting on the
suggestion of an administration
spokesman in Washington that
pleasure driving might have to be
curtailed to save gasoline and avoid
rationing.
Don Gilman, president of the
Western Oil and Gas Association,
said shortages in the East and Mid
dle West were due to poor trans
portation.
Reese H. Taylor, president of the
Union Oil Co., seconded him with
the suggestion that the government
solve the Eastern shortage by put
ting into use 100 tankers "now laid
up and idle."
