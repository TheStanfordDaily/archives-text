# Premier Schuman's Military Plan Passes; French Back-to-Work Movement Begins
## 
### 
Exhausted by a continuous session since 5 p.m. Saturday, the
I rench Chamber of Deputies adjourned until 10 a.m. Monday.
At that time they will begin discussion of the rest of Schuman's
program, including prison terms up to 10 years for saboteurs and
wage increases for French workers.
Approval of the military phases of Schuman's program was

voted 408 to 184 after the Assembly
beat down a 30-hour Communist fili
buster and threw out 320 Communist
amendments designed to delay action
on the anti-strike program.
The bill passed last night contained
these four points:
1. Power to call up 80,000 reserv
ists.
2. Placed the reservists under the
jurisdiction of the Minister of the
Army, with the Minister of Interior
having a priority claim on their
services.
3. Gave the government requisi
tioning powers to obtain material
and billets.
4. Provided for those powers to re
main effective until June 1, 1948, in
France and Algeria.
Even while the drastic new meas
ure was being hammered through
the Assembly over Communist oppo
sition, a back-to-work movement
became noticeable in the widespread
strikes that have clamped a virtual
paralysis on French industry.
Schuman, victorious in his first big
parliamentary showdown with the
Communists, thanked the Assembly
for its approval of the new law and
promised that it would be used "in
cases of necessity only, no matter
where violence comes from."
"The government intends to re
spect the rights and liberties of all
labor organizations," he said.
