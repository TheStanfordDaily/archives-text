# Farm Financial Practices Outmoded
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
There are many things at Stanford
that are done now because they
were done 15 and 20 years ago.
Maintenance of tlie status quo is
wonderful but sometimes progress
has its good points too.
The present Student Union was
presented to the University by an
anonymous donor early in the
1920'5.
No furnishings were included in
the gift so these were bought, by
the University. In order to pay the
obligations incurred in this fashion
each male student was assessed one
dollar per quarter.
This quarterly assessment is the
same one that is still included in
each male student's tuition although
the "furniture bills" were paid in
1935.
CONCESSIONS
During the early years that the
Student Union functioned the vari
ous concessions were leased out to
private groups and Stanford han
dled only the residence.
But this system did not make for
a rapid elimination of the debt.
Consequently, according to the
minutes of the Union Board of Gov
ernors of Oct. 25, 1933, the Univer
sity . . turned over to the Union
I all profit-making enterprises ... in
i order that the Union might secure
| income-producing units whose rev-
I enue could be employed in liquidat

ing some of Ihe Union's obliga
tions."
$40,000 PROMT
Thus the annual Union profit,
which now amounts to $40,000, was
authorized for the sole purpose of
liquidating obligations.
One accustomed to a normal ob
jective approach to such matters
would assume that the large profit
would cease once those obligations
were paid.
But that, was not the case. The
profits were increased — NOT RE
DUCED—when the need for them
no longer existed.
Profits, which averaged less than
$8,000 for the years 15)28-32, jumped
to an average of over $30,000 for the
three - year period following the
year the debt was paid—l93s.
TRANSFERRED PROFITS
In 1935 the Union Board of Gov
ernors voted to invest a portion of
the profits with the University.
And, according to the minutes of
the Board dated May 22, 1935, 75
per cent of the net operating profits
over a five-year period would be
transferred to the University to help
pay the Memorial Hall debt.
The minutes of the Jan. 31, 1940,
meeting of the Board show that this
agreement was renewed thus—"7s
per cent of the profits of the Student
Union (will) be used to defray the
cost of Memorial Hall."

In 1941, Jan. 24 to lie exact, the
minul.es reveal a most interesting
trend of thinking.
"It is understood that the above
procedure (referring to the 75 per
cent allocation of the profits) is to
be followed until the total of the
Memorial Hall debt is paid. There
after, the disposition of the Union
profits will be determined by action
of the Union Board of Governors."
Thus there can be no doubt that
the Board controls the profits. Just
because the Board now believes
that a new student union is a good
thing these profits will be chan
neled toward a 'new student union
fund."
There is nothing that would have
stopped the Board from putting
these funds into a fund to sponsor a
Stanford crew, erect a pool hall, or
plant begonias on the Inner Quad.
PRESSURE GROUP
If the Union Board isn't the big
gest pressure group on campus for
a new student union, how do you
define a pressure group?
In the notes of the March 13, 1942,
meeting there appears an interest
ing notation. It should particularly
interesting notation. It should par
ticularly interest the present Union
Board of Governors and particular
ly the present Student Manager.
"Suggestions with respect to pub
licity on Union policies before they

are put into practice . . . (were)
pesented."
The debt on Memorial Hall is now
paid. The Union Board found itself
this fall with an annual profit of
roughly $40,000 aiul no precedent as
to where it. should be spent.
BOARD'S RIGHTS
The students of Stanford should
question not the use to which the
Board put that $40,000 but instead
the Board's right, to control such a
large sum in the first place.
There arc basically two practices
associated with the Student Union
that should be investigated:
First, the question of the dollar
assessment which should have been
removed in 1935.
Second, the question of the large
profits which were to liquidate Un
ion debts and were continued once
the debts were eliminated.
OUTMODED FINANCE
The story of the present Student
Union appears to be an excellent
example of one of the outmoded
financial practices which have de
veloped at Stanford.
The elimination of these practices
would do much toward putting the
University and ASSU on a fooling
where each financial statement is
not, of necessity, accompanied by
the request that it not be publicized
because "the student body would
not understand."

the "furniture bills" were paid in
1935.
CONCESSIONS
During the early years that the
Student Union functioned the vari
ous concessions were leased out to
private groups and Stanford han
dled only the residence.
But this system did not make for
a rapid elimination of the debt.
Consequently, according to the
minutes of the Union Board of Gov
ernors of Oct. 25, 1933, the Univer
sity . . turned over to the Union
I all profit-making enterprises ... in
i order that the Union might secure
| income-producing units whose rev-
I enue could be employed in liquidat

ing some of Ihe Union's obliga
tions."
$40,000 PROMT
Thus the annual Union profit,
which now amounts to $40,000, was
authorized for the sole purpose of
liquidating obligations.
One accustomed to a normal ob
jective approach to such matters
would assume that the large profit
would cease once those obligations
were paid.
But that, was not the case. The
profits were increased — NOT RE
DUCED—when the need for them
no longer existed.
Profits, which averaged less than
$8,000 for the years 15)28-32, jumped
to an average of over $30,000 for the
three - year period following the
year the debt was paid—l93s.
TRANSFERRED PROFITS
In 1935 the Union Board of Gov
ernors voted to invest a portion of
the profits with the University.
And, according to the minutes of
the Board dated May 22, 1935, 75
per cent of the net operating profits
over a five-year period would be
transferred to the University to help
pay the Memorial Hall debt.
The minutes of the Jan. 31, 1940,
meeting of the Board show that this
agreement was renewed thus—"7s
per cent of the profits of the Student
Union (will) be used to defray the
cost of Memorial Hall."

In 1941, Jan. 24 to lie exact, the
minul.es reveal a most interesting
trend of thinking.
"It is understood that the above
procedure (referring to the 75 per
cent allocation of the profits) is to
be followed until the total of the
Memorial Hall debt is paid. There
after, the disposition of the Union
profits will be determined by action
of the Union Board of Governors."
Thus there can be no doubt that
the Board controls the profits. Just
because the Board now believes
that a new student union is a good
thing these profits will be chan
neled toward a 'new student union
fund."
There is nothing that would have
stopped the Board from putting
these funds into a fund to sponsor a
Stanford crew, erect a pool hall, or
plant begonias on the Inner Quad.
PRESSURE GROUP
If the Union Board isn't the big
gest pressure group on campus for
a new student union, how do you
define a pressure group?
In the notes of the March 13, 1942,
meeting there appears an interest
ing notation. It should particularly
interesting notation. It should par
ticularly interest the present Union
Board of Governors and particular
ly the present Student Manager.
"Suggestions with respect to pub
licity on Union policies before they

are put into practice . . . (were)
pesented."
The debt on Memorial Hall is now
paid. The Union Board found itself
this fall with an annual profit of
roughly $40,000 aiul no precedent as
to where it. should be spent.
BOARD'S RIGHTS
The students of Stanford should
question not the use to which the
Board put that $40,000 but instead
the Board's right, to control such a
large sum in the first place.
There arc basically two practices
associated with the Student Union
that should be investigated:
First, the question of the dollar
assessment which should have been
removed in 1935.
Second, the question of the large
profits which were to liquidate Un
ion debts and were continued once
the debts were eliminated.
OUTMODED FINANCE
The story of the present Student
Union appears to be an excellent
example of one of the outmoded
financial practices which have de
veloped at Stanford.
The elimination of these practices
would do much toward putting the
University and ASSU on a fooling
where each financial statement is
not, of necessity, accompanied by
the request that it not be publicized
because "the student body would
not understand."
There are many things at Stanford
that are done now because they
were done 15 and 20 years ago.
Maintenance of tlie status quo is
wonderful but sometimes progress
has its good points too.
The present Student Union was
presented to the University by an
anonymous donor early in the
1920'5.
No furnishings were included in
the gift so these were bought, by
the University. In order to pay the
obligations incurred in this fashion
each male student was assessed one
dollar per quarter.
This quarterly assessment is the
same one that is still included in
each male student's tuition although
the "furniture bills" were paid in
1935.

I enue could be employed in liquidat

ing some of Ihe Union's obliga
tions."
$40,000 PROMT
Thus the annual Union profit,
which now amounts to $40,000, was
authorized for the sole purpose of
liquidating obligations.
One accustomed to a normal ob
jective approach to such matters
would assume that the large profit
would cease once those obligations
were paid.
But that, was not the case. The
profits were increased — NOT RE
DUCED—when the need for them
no longer existed.
Profits, which averaged less than
$8,000 for the years 15)28-32, jumped
to an average of over $30,000 for the
three - year period following the
year the debt was paid—l93s.
TRANSFERRED PROFITS
In 1935 the Union Board of Gov
ernors voted to invest a portion of
the profits with the University.
And, according to the minutes of
the Board dated May 22, 1935, 75
per cent of the net operating profits
over a five-year period would be
transferred to the University to help
pay the Memorial Hall debt.
The minutes of the Jan. 31, 1940,
meeting of the Board show that this
agreement was renewed thus—"7s
per cent of the profits of the Student
Union (will) be used to defray the
cost of Memorial Hall."

In 1941, Jan. 24 to lie exact, the
minul.es reveal a most interesting
trend of thinking.
"It is understood that the above
procedure (referring to the 75 per
cent allocation of the profits) is to
be followed until the total of the
Memorial Hall debt is paid. There
after, the disposition of the Union
profits will be determined by action
of the Union Board of Governors."
Thus there can be no doubt that
the Board controls the profits. Just
because the Board now believes
that a new student union is a good
thing these profits will be chan
neled toward a 'new student union
fund."
There is nothing that would have
stopped the Board from putting
these funds into a fund to sponsor a
Stanford crew, erect a pool hall, or
plant begonias on the Inner Quad.
PRESSURE GROUP
If the Union Board isn't the big
gest pressure group on campus for
a new student union, how do you
define a pressure group?
In the notes of the March 13, 1942,
meeting there appears an interest
ing notation. It should particularly
interesting notation. It should par
ticularly interest the present Union
Board of Governors and particular
ly the present Student Manager.
"Suggestions with respect to pub
licity on Union policies before they

are put into practice . . . (were)
pesented."
The debt on Memorial Hall is now
paid. The Union Board found itself
this fall with an annual profit of
roughly $40,000 aiul no precedent as
to where it. should be spent.
BOARD'S RIGHTS
The students of Stanford should
question not the use to which the
Board put that $40,000 but instead
the Board's right, to control such a
large sum in the first place.
There arc basically two practices
associated with the Student Union
that should be investigated:
First, the question of the dollar
assessment which should have been
removed in 1935.
Second, the question of the large
profits which were to liquidate Un
ion debts and were continued once
the debts were eliminated.
OUTMODED FINANCE
The story of the present Student
Union appears to be an excellent
example of one of the outmoded
financial practices which have de
veloped at Stanford.
The elimination of these practices
would do much toward putting the
University and ASSU on a fooling
where each financial statement is
not, of necessity, accompanied by
the request that it not be publicized
because "the student body would
not understand."
There are many things at Stanford
that are done now because they
were done 15 and 20 years ago.
Maintenance of tlie status quo is
wonderful but sometimes progress
has its good points too.
The present Student Union was
presented to the University by an
anonymous donor early in the
1920'5.
No furnishings were included in
the gift so these were bought, by
the University. In order to pay the
obligations incurred in this fashion
each male student was assessed one
dollar per quarter.
This quarterly assessment is the
same one that is still included in
each male student's tuition although
the "furniture bills" were paid in
1935.
CONCESSIONS
During the early years that the
Student Union functioned the vari
ous concessions were leased out to
private groups and Stanford han
dled only the residence.
But this system did not make for
a rapid elimination of the debt.
Consequently, according to the
minutes of the Union Board of Gov
ernors of Oct. 25, 1933, the Univer
sity . . turned over to the Union
I all profit-making enterprises ... in
i order that the Union might secure
| income-producing units whose rev-
I enue could be employed in liquidat

ing some of Ihe Union's obliga
tions."
