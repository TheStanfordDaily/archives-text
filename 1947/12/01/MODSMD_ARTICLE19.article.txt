# Senior Party On Reg Day
## 
### 
"The senior class is planning an
unusual climax to Christmas fes
tivities on Jan. 5, Reg Day," stated
Bob Coate, class president, last
week. "It's a Reg party, something
new in pre-quarter activities."
"Not just the ordinary dance is in
order," Coate continued, "but the
added features of bridge, ping pong,
continues movies, community sing
ingâ€”maybe the New York Philhar
monic, if it's available."
According to tentative plans made
at last week's senior excom meet
ing, the party will be held in the
Village gymnasium. That building
has the additional facilities of a bal
cony for the card games and table
tennis and an extensive handball
court in which movies will be
shown.
The attendance will be limited to
400 in order to insure plenty of
room. Bids will be available this
quarter, subsequent to Excom's ap
proval of the dance budget.
