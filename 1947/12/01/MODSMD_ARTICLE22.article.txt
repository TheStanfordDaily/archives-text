# Vote Today On Aid Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. .'5O (UP).—
The Senate is scheduled to vote to
day on the $597,000,000 emergency
aid bill for France, Italy, and Aus
tria amid indications that Republican
leaders will go along on the measure
and save their fire for the long
range Marshall Recovery Plan.
At the same time, Democrats on
♦he House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee will make an all-out effort to
restore a $108,000,000 cut tentatively
from funds for the three countries
by the committee majority.
Before voting on the bill, the Sen
ate must dispose of a series of
amendments by Senator James P.
Kem, R„ Mo., designed to require
recipient countries to detail how
relief is distributed and to inform
their citizens that it came from the
United States.
Sen. Irving M. Ives, R.. N.Y., said
in a broadcast that it is "fairly ob
vious" that all of Europe and pos
sibly the British Isles "is apt to go
Communistic within a relatively
short time without outside aid." He
said the United States ultimately
"could be enslaved under Moscow"
if it adopts a "do-nothing" policy.
Senator Arthur Capper, R., Kans.,
said in another broadcast that he
would vote for the interim aid bill,
but "that does not commit me to
support the Marshall Plan" nor Mr.
Truman's anti-inflation program.
