# Newspaper Spreads Wings on Campus in 1891; Daily Palo Alio 'Shocking and Sensational'
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is (he first in a series of
three articles on Stanford puhlic
| cations of another era. Today's
article describes the birth of (he
Stanford Daily in 1891.)
The Inner Quad was fast becom
ing a favorite rendezvous for un-
J dergraduates, and from a spot near
Memorial Court, one could shade
his eyes and watch the victorias
move down (lie palm-lined drive
toward Palo Alto.
It was 1891.
Sophs, someone wrote, have ap
peared in tasty mortar boards of
black, and when (hey weren't
learning Greek or Latin, were wont
to yodel the strangest chants.
"Hoop ter razzle! L.S.J.U.
Best on record, horse on you.
Ausgezeichnet,, hear us roar,
Stanford Junior, '94."
TRADITIONS TO BE FOUNDED
A new University, traditions to be
founded in fresh and picturesque
fashion, was cast upon the universe.
! And on opening day, it was Senator
Stanford himself who lauded a
"hardy 559 men and women."
"You students," the Senator said,
"are the most important factor in
the University."
A month before registration, a
prospective transfer student from
the University of Michigan, George
Lawrence, wrote to the University
of his desire to see a University
newspaper started.
"It could be called 'The Stanford
Review," he said, "or any other
name satisfactory to (he authori
| ties."
A PAPER IS BORN
Lawrence's suggestion look hold
with others, because on opening day
I the monthly "Palo Alto" was born,

one ol the lew college newspapers
.started simultaneously willi the
opening of a university.
The publication was edited by
Hqlbrook Blinn, who was later to
gain fame as an actor in England.
Blinn had transferred from the Uni
versity of the Pacific and did not
exactly pretend to fill the "Palo
Alto" with news.
II was a kind of sensationalism to
say the least. High-brow journal
ism and articles on topics more or
less radical werp not what Univer
sity officials h%l expected of a col
lege newspaper.
HAREM I'RINT A SHOCKER
But a corne-uppance was enacted
when an artotype reproduction of
Simoni's "Slave Merchant at the
Harem" was printed in the paper.
To say a minor storm was created
would be putting it mildly.
The photograph was "shocking"
and would best be one that would
promote art education, observers
declared. In a body, the board of
editors resigned.
Years later, University President
David Starr Jordan would tell
friends of a letter written by Blinn.
The brash ex-editor had written:
"My work on the 'Palo Alto' ab
solutely took the fan away from the
very tiny spark of real student
quality that I possessed."
A recommendation by Excom on
Oct. 31, 1891, provided for the es
tablishment of a new journal to be
called "The Sequoia." With Watson
Nicholson as editor, the news col
umns of "The Sequoia" were filled

with typical country style newsy
gossip faithfully and conscientiously
edited.
VERBAL CURTAIN CALLS
Though generally considered a
risky venture and despite much
student opposition, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was again taking verbal cur
tain calls in 1892.
Free from sensationalism . . . free,
accurate reporting and a staid for
mat . . . and a prevalence of judi
cial tone.
These were the key features of
the grand-daddy of The Daily, a re
verse editorial new look represent
ing student life and thought.
On Quad, they were singing "An
nie Rooney" and discussing the
world political scene as heard at
Hall's, a provincial drugstore which
also advertised unfermentcd grape
juice.
And while the tally-ho's thread
eagled their way down the lanes, a
collegiate newspaper was already in
the midst of its first volume.


Tlte inner Quad in 1 SOI was a combination of academic and a place where study-weary under
grads might relax. The Stanford Daily was horn of these surimindings s(i years ago.

HAREM I'RINT A SHOCKER
