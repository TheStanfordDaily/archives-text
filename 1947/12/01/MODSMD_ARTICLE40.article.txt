# Stanford SDX Delegate Hears Truman, Forrestal
## 
### 
"If I were running a newspaper," i
President Truman said, "I would
hire nothing but police reporters.
They know a fact when they see
one, and they always get things
right." The nation's Chief Execu
tive was speaking to delegates to a
Sigma Delta Chi convention, who
were assembled for a press confer
ence in the Oval Room of the White
House.
Sigma Delta Chi, professional
journalism fraternity, held its na
tional convention in Washington,
D.C. John Turnblad, staff editor of
The Daily and president of the
Stanford chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi, represented the Farm. He re
turned to the campus enrly last
week.
CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHT
"The press conference with Tru
man was the highlight of the con
vention," Turnblad said in recalling
the trip. "The President ended his
remarks by saying that he hoped
none of us had aspirations to sit in
the chair he was occupying."
While he was in Washington,
Turnblad met several former Stan
fordites. Among them was Bristow
Adams, co-founder of the Chapar
ral in 18!)!). who is now acting as ad
viser to the Cornell Widow.
Two Stanford journalism gradu
ates were elected to offices in the
national organization. Noal Van
Sooy, '33, former Stanford alumni
director, now publisher of the Santa

Paula Chronicle, was elected na
tional vice-president. John M. Mc-
Clelland Jr., '37, was elected na
tional secretary of the journalism
fraternity. McClelland now pub
lishes a newspaper in Longview,
Washington.
STANFORD SECOND
Seventy-nine chapters were rep
resented. Stanford placed second in
the professional achievement con
test, which means that Stanford has
the second highest number of jour
nalism graduates still employed in
the field at the end of a five-year
period.
Three times Stanford has placed
first in this category, the only school
to win this distinction more than
twice.
"We also heard W. Stuart Sy
mington, the new Secretary for
Air," Turnblad said. "He told us
he is trying to run his department
like a business and he is looking for
business men as well as flyers."
Defense Secretary James V. For
; restal was the speaker at the closing
I banquet.
