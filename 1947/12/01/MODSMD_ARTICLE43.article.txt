# Water Polo Season Ends; Swim Champaign Nears
## 
### 
The large metal goal cages will
soon be stored away for another
year, and the colorful lane markers
once again become evident in the
Encina Pools, signifying the conclu
sion of another water polo campaign
on the Farm.
For it is at this time that the
swimmers who brought Stanford its
second straight Southern Division
PCC water polo title, and its fourth
since the league was initiated in
1932, abandon their passing, shoot
ing, and guarding for the time and
get don to the grueling business of
getting in shape for the coming
swimming season.
With the exception of two men—
forward Walt Lull and centerback

Fritz Maurer — every member of
this season's championship water
polo squad will continue to work
out at the pool, seeking a position
on the 1948 Stanford swimming
team.
Water polo team captain Dick
Narver will add strength to the
freestyle events, as will forwards
Harry Borchers and Jim Arm
strong; goalie Don Hester is the
PCC breaststroke champion; and
guard Ralph Sala will probably be
the number one distance man for
Stanford this year. Subs Ken Fox,
Hase Rodenbaugh, Kim Fletcher,
and Ed Major will also be welcome
additions to the swimming varsity.
With last Friday's 5 to 3 victory
over the University of California on
the books, the Indian varsity com
pleted its season with a conference
record of five wins against one loss,
and with victories over Fullerton
JC, the Cal Aggies, and San Jose
State and losses only to the Olympic
Club and San Jose State outside of
conference competition.
In commenting on his team's suc
cess this season, Farm Coach Tom
Haynie stated he felt it was due
largely to the excellent defensive
play which the Indians showed in
their games.
