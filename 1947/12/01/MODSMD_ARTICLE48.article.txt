SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 30 (UP).
â€”University of San Francisco ex
| ploded for five touchdowns in the
second half today to roll from be
hind and dump a fighting St. Mary's
College eleven, 32 to 20, in the sea
son's football finale for both teams.
As 27,000 stunned fans watched
i Herman Wedemeyer return to his
I one - time All - American brilliance
during the first half, the surprising
Gaels racked up a 14 to 0 half-time
| lead.
But the superior USF power be
: gan clicking in a wild, see-saw third
stanza to pile up 26 points and coast
to victory over the outmanned St.
I Mary's club.
DONS DEMORALIZE FOES
With halfback Joe Scott skirting
the ends and quarterbacks Fred
j Klemenoek and Jimmy Ryan toss-
I ing long, accurate passes, the Dons
scored four touchdowns in nine and
: one-half minutes of play to com
! pletely demoralize the Gaels.
San Francisco scored three touch
downs to run up a 20 to 14 lead
after eight minutes of the third pe
riod only to have a sensational We
demeyer come back and complete a
pass to halfback Paul Crowe that
went for a 63-yard touchdown and
knotted the count at 20-all.
But that was the end of the Gaels'
offensive. Any other threats they
made were broken up with pass
interceptions. Wedemeyer, having
one of his best days since 1945 when
he was an All - American, threw
| three touchdown passes. One was
to end Ed Ryan in the first period,
another to quarterback Denis O
| Connor in the second, and the third
j was to Crowe.
HALL SCOOTS
Quarterback Ryan got the Dons'
j great third - period scoring attack
i rolling with a 53-yard play that
j started with a pass to end George
Stefko, who in turn lateraled to
Forrest Hall. The little "scooter"
halfback outran the Gael backfield
! for the touchdown.
The "good - measure" touchdown
came in the final period when
Klemenoek set up a fake field goal
on the St. Mary's 22, and then ram
bled around end to the goal line.
