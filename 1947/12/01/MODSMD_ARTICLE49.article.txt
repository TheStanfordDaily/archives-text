# Farm Fight Meet Nears
## 
### 
Nearly GO Farm pugilists have en
tered the All-University and Novice
Boxing Tournaments. Elimination
matches are scheduled for tomorrow
and Wednesday, while the finals will
be held Friday, December 5.
Coach Ray Lunney has announced
that this year's two tournaments
will display more talent than ever
before in Stanford ring history. A
number of experienced and able
men, better than any pre-war Farm
talent, will vie for the open division
championships.
TWO MEETS SCHEDULED
This wealth of talent has made it
necessary to run two tournaments,
while in previous years only one
meet, for experienced and novice
fighters alike, has been presented.
Ferris Boothe, last year's 155-lb.
champion and the first fighter in the
country to box while wearing con
tact lenses, faces plenty of competi
tion in his class. Willie Altus, 145-
lb. finalist last year, Dick Stanton,
165-pound letterman, and Sal Col
letto, a hard-hitting frosh, all fig
ure to give Boothe a rough battle for
the 155-pound crown.
LONG UNOPPOSED
Fred Ten Eyek, finalist last year,
and Irwin Rosa, returning letterman,

figure among the top 165-pound en
trants. Elia Long, last year's heavy
weight Champ at 175 lbs., who was
unbeaten in both the heavy and
light heavyweight divisions, has not
yet found an opponent in his class.
Three men figure highly in the
heavyweight dispute. Joe Cranmer,
175-1 b. title holder last year, Bill
Edwards, returning letterman and
runner-up last year, and Emery
Mitchell, transfer student and form
er heavyweight boss at Fresno State,
all rate as strong contenders.
