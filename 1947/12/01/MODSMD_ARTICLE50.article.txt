# Ski Team Prospects Are Good
## 
### 
Four returning lettermen and a i
host of impressive team candidates
have sent the stock of Stanford's
intercollegiate ski team soaring as
squad tryouts loom up this week
end. Led by captain Jim Brehler,
the hopefuls will go through their \
paces on Mount Rose near Reno
over the holidays.
Although Bob and Boots Blatt
have graduated from the ranks of
Stanford skimen to membership on i
the 1947-48 Olympic winter sports
team, the roster shows that, in ad
dition to captain Brehler, Don Wil
liams and Greg Bemis are back !
from last year's outfit and Raleigh
Andrews, captain in 1D45-46, has re
turned to competition.
Bill and Tito Sisal, brother com-

bination and members of a promi
nent skiing family, will be display
ing their wares after being ruled in
eligible last year.
Stanford skiers will compete in
several meets this winter, notably
the national intercollegiates at Sun
Valley late in December for indi
vidual and team championships.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Ski
Union, sponsored by the Rosemite
Winter Club, will be held at Badg
er Pass in January.
The Reno Winter Carnival comes
along in March, sponsored by the
University of Nevada, and the Van
derbilt Memorial race at Sugar
Bowl winds up team festivities in
April. Team members compete in
individual races throughout the
season.
THIRD LAST YEAR
Last year's varsity, paced by the
Blatt blathers, finished third behind
Utah and Washington in the inter
collegiates. The Stanford Ski Club
supports the team out of its club
treasury, placing the team in a posi
tion somewhat similar to that of the
varsity crew â€”neither sport is as
sisted financially by the Stanford
Athletic Council.
Jim Brehler captains the 1947-48
team. A Porterville lad, he did his
early skiing at Sequoia, then let

tered here last year after his first
] campaign on the Farm,
t Sparkplug Don Williams hails
. from Seattle where he was the state
"B" classification winner last win-
5

tor. He competed in the Westeri,
States Championships (Joffers Cup)
at Sun Valley unci in tlic National;
at last year.
Grog Bemis was horn in Boston,
Mass., and has done most of his
slaloming in the East. Greg com
peted in the Nationals in 194(5 and
lettered hero last yeiir.
