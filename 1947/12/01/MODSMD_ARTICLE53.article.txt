### AL HARBER 
She had that you-know-how-dangerous look of
ecstasy in her eyes when she finished telling me all
about Him. "Been so long I'd almost forgotten what
it's like." Long sigh. "It's l'un being in love, even with
out money." Longer sigh. Amen.
But I ask you: what's fun about being in love when
you're broke? Or like they are—so close to it that
their affair requires joint financing. No car. No money.
Isn't even spring.
Chilly these evenings. Who likes to hold cold
hands? Hell of a lot cheaper, generally, if you keep
them in your pockets . . . and warmer.
The two of them have an allowance of ten dollars
a month (that's only 33.3 cents a day, you know) for
"incidentals." (Twice mine without incidentals.)
They had to forego their nightly coffee (and his dough
nut) in order to have something to spend every four
teenth weekend.
Nothing to do but go to the Libe, fidget while they
Iry to study at adjacent desks in the Reserve Book
Room. And walk back to her house in the dark after
ward. Dangerous walking in the dark. Dog-gone dan
gerous.

No car. Taxi if they forego their daily allowance
completely for sixteen weeks running—by walking
from Paly on not-so-late dates. Don't watch the road:
just watch the meter and she'll think that extra squeeze
(yep, holding hands again) every time the blinking
thing knocks off another two bits is passional indica
tion of affection. Maybe.
Walking makes her cheeks nice and flushed from
the damned cold air. Fog conceals the two of them
from the curiosity of the wishful.
Rosy cheeks, bright eyes, inviting lips just outside
the bright fringe of the porch light. My roommate
never says goodnight to me like that!
That awful, full feeling inside as he walks home
(not coffee). Mine, he says. Mine. Tomorrow night
the same old thing: Libe and then a slow walk back.
Maybe slower.
Rough, isn't it? Love on the dole.
* * * *
Me? I haven't even got thirty cents; don't like
doughnuts. But if you'll hand me that bawlout and
lend me twenty cents until day after tomorrow . . .

ecstasy in her eyes when she finished telling me all
about Him. "Been so long I'd almost forgotten what
it's like." Long sigh. "It's l'un being in love, even with
out money." Longer sigh. Amen.
But I ask you: what's fun about being in love when
you're broke? Or like they are—so close to it that
their affair requires joint financing. No car. No money.
Isn't even spring.
Chilly these evenings. Who likes to hold cold
hands? Hell of a lot cheaper, generally, if you keep
them in your pockets . . . and warmer.
The two of them have an allowance of ten dollars
a month (that's only 33.3 cents a day, you know) for
"incidentals." (Twice mine without incidentals.)
They had to forego their nightly coffee (and his dough
nut) in order to have something to spend every four
teenth weekend.
Nothing to do but go to the Libe, fidget while they
Iry to study at adjacent desks in the Reserve Book
Room. And walk back to her house in the dark after
ward. Dangerous walking in the dark. Dog-gone dan
gerous.

No car. Taxi if they forego their daily allowance
completely for sixteen weeks running—by walking
from Paly on not-so-late dates. Don't watch the road:
just watch the meter and she'll think that extra squeeze
(yep, holding hands again) every time the blinking
thing knocks off another two bits is passional indica
tion of affection. Maybe.
Walking makes her cheeks nice and flushed from
the damned cold air. Fog conceals the two of them
from the curiosity of the wishful.
Rosy cheeks, bright eyes, inviting lips just outside
the bright fringe of the porch light. My roommate
never says goodnight to me like that!
That awful, full feeling inside as he walks home
(not coffee). Mine, he says. Mine. Tomorrow night
the same old thing: Libe and then a slow walk back.
Maybe slower.
Rough, isn't it? Love on the dole.

Me? I haven't even got thirty cents; don't like
doughnuts. But if you'll hand me that bawlout and
lend me twenty cents until day after tomorrow . . .
