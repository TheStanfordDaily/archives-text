### GEORGE BRUNN 
Advocates of the Marshall Plan say it will help build
a peaceful and democratic world. This is a fine goal
and the Plan can be an important step toward its
realization.
If it is to be a step forward we must wake up to
certain facts of life. Some of these concern the Plan
itself. We must, for example, realize that the people
of Europe do not share our admiration of what we
like to call the free enterprise system. They have little
sympathy for it and they will have even less for any
attempts we may make to impose it on them.
It is interesting to note in this connection that when
some Congressmen visited England recently they asked
members of Parliament how they would feel if we
attached strings to future loans demanding discontinu
ance of nationalization. The MPs were strongly op
posed to this and their reaction is significant because
they were members of the Conservative (repeat: Con
servative) Party.
At the same time we must assure efficient admin
istration of the billions we plan to spend. If we allow
it to be administered by generals and Wall Street
brokers (as we do in Germany) we will, instead of
getting a peaceful and democratic Europe, get one that
is militaristic and undemocratic. We can't allow the
world to be run for the benefit of Dillon. Reed & Co.,
so we must, furthermore, eliminate the contradic
tions of our foreign policy. We cannot help the free
dom-loving people of Europe by rebuilding a strong
Germany run by the same clique of junkers and I. G.
Ear ben and Krupp monopolists that ran it before the
war.
Yet every unbiased report coming from Germany
indicates that this is precisely what we are doing. For
instance. James Martin who recently resigned as head
of the decartelization division gave as the reason for
his resignation the fact that he was not permitted to

break up German cartels. Two years ago we under
took to destroy 1,600 German war plants. We have
decided to let it go at something less than half of that.
Newspapermen have reported time after time that
avowed Nazis are still in many leading government and
business positions, especially in Bavaria. Will Mr.
Marshall please explain how this helps the freedom
loving people of Europe, or, for that matter, of America?
While our own prosperity and freedom depend on
that of Europe, our aid to them will be meaningless
if we cannot maintain our prosperity and freedom.
This apparent paradox is of the greatest importance.
Let us not be diverted by the needs of Europe from
our own needs. We cannot sell freedom abroad if we
lose it at home. We must be determined not to lose
our liberty in senseless hysteria. A great judge once
commented that the Puritans hunted witches, but killed
women. By such actions as smearing all political op
position as Communist and firing government workers
without a hearing we endanger the freedoms for which
we have fought so hard. Let us not smugly believe that
spending money alone will save the Constitution.
Finally, if our billions are to have the desired
effect, we must keep our economic machine running
smoothly. It is for this reason that President Truman
has requested the return of some controls. Prices (and
profits) during the past year have been rising at an
unprecedented rate. With increased shipments to
Europe they are likely to rise considerably more.
That's merely the law of supply and demand that Sen.
Taft used to mention so often.
Without effective controls we have the choice of
either stopping foreign aid or a rapid and disastrous
inflation—crash cycle here. Think twice before ob
jecting to "bureaucratic interference."
The Marshall Plan is part of a bigger picture. There
is hope for its success. It can easily become a vain
hope. The price of failure is death.

If it is to be a step forward we must wake up to
certain facts of life. Some of these concern the Plan
itself. We must, for example, realize that the people
of Europe do not share our admiration of what we
like to call the free enterprise system. They have little
sympathy for it and they will have even less for any
attempts we may make to impose it on them.
It is interesting to note in this connection that when
some Congressmen visited England recently they asked
members of Parliament how they would feel if we
attached strings to future loans demanding discontinu
ance of nationalization. The MPs were strongly op
posed to this and their reaction is significant because
they were members of the Conservative (repeat: Con
servative) Party.
At the same time we must assure efficient admin
istration of the billions we plan to spend. If we allow
it to be administered by generals and Wall Street
brokers (as we do in Germany) we will, instead of
getting a peaceful and democratic Europe, get one that
is militaristic and undemocratic. We can't allow the
world to be run for the benefit of Dillon. Reed & Co.,
so we must, furthermore, eliminate the contradic
tions of our foreign policy. We cannot help the free
dom-loving people of Europe by rebuilding a strong
Germany run by the same clique of junkers and I. G.
Ear ben and Krupp monopolists that ran it before the
war.
Yet every unbiased report coming from Germany
indicates that this is precisely what we are doing. For
instance. James Martin who recently resigned as head
of the decartelization division gave as the reason for
his resignation the fact that he was not permitted to

break up German cartels. Two years ago we under
took to destroy 1,600 German war plants. We have
decided to let it go at something less than half of that.
Newspapermen have reported time after time that
avowed Nazis are still in many leading government and
business positions, especially in Bavaria. Will Mr.
Marshall please explain how this helps the freedom
loving people of Europe, or, for that matter, of America?
While our own prosperity and freedom depend on
that of Europe, our aid to them will be meaningless
if we cannot maintain our prosperity and freedom.
This apparent paradox is of the greatest importance.
Let us not be diverted by the needs of Europe from
our own needs. We cannot sell freedom abroad if we
lose it at home. We must be determined not to lose
our liberty in senseless hysteria. A great judge once
commented that the Puritans hunted witches, but killed
women. By such actions as smearing all political op
position as Communist and firing government workers
without a hearing we endanger the freedoms for which
we have fought so hard. Let us not smugly believe that
spending money alone will save the Constitution.
Finally, if our billions are to have the desired
effect, we must keep our economic machine running
smoothly. It is for this reason that President Truman
has requested the return of some controls. Prices (and
profits) during the past year have been rising at an
unprecedented rate. With increased shipments to
Europe they are likely to rise considerably more.
That's merely the law of supply and demand that Sen.
Taft used to mention so often.
Without effective controls we have the choice of
either stopping foreign aid or a rapid and disastrous
inflation—crash cycle here. Think twice before ob
jecting to "bureaucratic interference."
The Marshall Plan is part of a bigger picture. There
is hope for its success. It can easily become a vain
hope. The price of failure is death.
Advocates of the Marshall Plan say it will help build
a peaceful and democratic world. This is a fine goal
and the Plan can be an important step toward its
realization.
