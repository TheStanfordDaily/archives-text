# Eureka! Roble Sponsors Fine for Frosh
## 
### JACK COLEMAN 
When the doors of home close be
hind a new freshman girl and she
finds herself separated from her
sheltered life and her emotional ties,
she steps into Stanford not alone
but with a friend, a link with her
new way of life. That friend is a
Roble sponsor.
This story is to glorify the Roble
sponsor, whose origin smacks of the
legend of Archimedes and his dash
through the streets shouting "Eu
reka!"
Former Dean of Women Mary
Yost tells and retells the story of
how the sponsor system was born
with unexhaustive pleasure because:
"ft typifies the 'spirit' of Roble
sponsoring."
MODERN COUNTERPARTS
Archimedes' modern counterparts
were three sorority girls, Meribeth
Cameron, Anna Fitzhugh. and the
third is unidentified, fn the middle
of one spring night in 1924, they
were seen dashing down the street
to Dean Mary's house, which was
consistently left unlocked through
negligence. The three girls knocked,
but Dean Mary, stalwart in her de
termination to read in bed undis
turbed, ignored the knocking. The
three Archimedeses, completely ob
livious to time and place, burst in,
dashed upstairs, perched upon Dean
Mary's bed and blurted forth their
plan for replacing the unpopular
"big sister" plan.
"1 can still see them," reminisces
Dean Mary, "their eyes shining and
so fdled with their idea nothing else
mattered."
Under the ill - functioning "big
sister" plan for orienting incoming
freshman women, each upperclass
woman was assigned the names of
two or three new freshman girls to
whom she was to write during the
summer. Everyone, especially the
new freshmen, suffered under this
plan. Sorority women were not per

mitted to talk with these new wom
en after they arrived at Stanford
until rushing m winter quarter;
many of the new women failed to
receive letters and felt hurt; little
could be accomplished in the way
of orientation by these few letters.
NKW PLAN
The plan the three girls brought
to Miss Yost was to have a group
of specially selected women, soro
rity and non-sorority, give up their
sorority and living group affiliations
for one year and come to live in
Roble as sponsors. They were to
act as middlemen between the
"green" frosh and the adults in the
offices and halls. They were to in
terpret the administration to the
frosh and the frosh to the adminis
tration. They were to help the new
women in their adjustment prob
lems, selection of activities, dating,
conduct, apportionment of study,
explanation of the meaning and
purposes of campus institutions and
organizations. In short, they were
to be leaders and trainers of future
leaders.
A SUCCESS
The plan has been an overwhelm
ing success, according to Miss Yost,
Miss Lataillade (Miss "La"), direc
tor of Roble, the sponsors, and the
girls themselves.
The morning following that fa
mous night Dean Mary gained ap
proval for the plan from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, President of the
University, and the machinery was
set in motion. Soon colleges and
universities all over the country
copied this plan that was created at

Stanford.
The system of selecting Roble (
sponsors, as it has evolved through j
23 years, now consists of selection j
by a committee composed of the |
president of Women's Conference i
and members of other leading j
women's organizations on campus. ]
The chief counselor's office desig
nates the members each year.
MUST APPLY
Women interested in becoming
sponsors write papers giving their
purposes and qualifications, inter- !
views are held, and qualifications
are investigated. For each of Ro
ble's eleven corridors one junior |
and one senior woman are selected. '
Because freshmen are also being 1
housed in Branner, there are also '
five sponsors stationed there.
Through Roble's notorious "Com- |
mittee of Five" new freshman girls |
first realize they are not completely
free souls and must abide by rules
of conduct. This committee is com
posed of two senior sponsors and
three junior sponsors.
MANY BENEFITS
Besides success in carrying out its
primary purposes the sponsor sys
tem has resulted in a variety of
benefits, such as the counseling and
recruiting experience gained by the
sponsors themselves.
One sponsor remarked:
"The position of a sponsor is be-

I tween being a mother and being a
J fellow student. The sponsor is not
a wailing post!"
SOME SACRIFICE
The job, however, is not without
| sacrifice. It often means social iso
[ lation for the sponsor, for she does
i not have the social contacts with
men her own age that she had in
1 her previous living group, but is
j usually swamped by frosh men. She
often loses contact with her old liv
ing group friends, and many times
I it seems as if a stamp were put on
j her as being severe or a Puritan.
Much of the sponsor's time is ab
j sorbed in meetings and in just, "be-
I ing around" to help the freshmen,
j The sponsor must learn to adjust to
' her role without sacrificing her own
| studying and personal life.
Standing as evidence of the gen
uine pride in their jobs, the satis
faction, and experience derived
from sponsoring is the fact that
practically every one of the present
junior sponsors is eager to return to
Roble as a sponsor in her senior
year. â€¢

MARY YOST, Dean of Womcif
emeritus, who helped institute
the sponsor system.
When the doors of home close be
hind a new freshman girl and she
finds herself separated from her
sheltered life and her emotional ties,
she steps into Stanford not alone
but with a friend, a link with her
new way of life. That friend is a
Roble sponsor.
This story is to glorify the Roble
sponsor, whose origin smacks of the
legend of Archimedes and his dash
through the streets shouting "Eu
reka!"
Former Dean of Women Mary
Yost tells and retells the story of
how the sponsor system was born
with unexhaustive pleasure because:
"ft typifies the 'spirit' of Roble
sponsoring."
MODERN COUNTERPARTS
Archimedes' modern counterparts
were three sorority girls, Meribeth
Cameron, Anna Fitzhugh. and the
third is unidentified, fn the middle
of one spring night in 1924, they
were seen dashing down the street
to Dean Mary's house, which was
consistently left unlocked through
negligence. The three girls knocked,
but Dean Mary, stalwart in her de
termination to read in bed undis
turbed, ignored the knocking. The
three Archimedeses, completely ob
livious to time and place, burst in,
dashed upstairs, perched upon Dean
Mary's bed and blurted forth their
plan for replacing the unpopular
"big sister" plan.
"1 can still see them," reminisces
Dean Mary, "their eyes shining and
so fdled with their idea nothing else
mattered."
Under the ill - functioning "big
sister" plan for orienting incoming
freshman women, each upperclass
woman was assigned the names of
two or three new freshman girls to
whom she was to write during the
summer. Everyone, especially the
new freshmen, suffered under this
plan. Sorority women were not per

mitted to talk with these new wom
en after they arrived at Stanford
until rushing m winter quarter;
many of the new women failed to
receive letters and felt hurt; little
could be accomplished in the way
of orientation by these few letters.
NKW PLAN
The plan the three girls brought
to Miss Yost was to have a group
of specially selected women, soro
rity and non-sorority, give up their
sorority and living group affiliations
for one year and come to live in
Roble as sponsors. They were to
act as middlemen between the
"green" frosh and the adults in the
offices and halls. They were to in
terpret the administration to the
frosh and the frosh to the adminis
tration. They were to help the new
women in their adjustment prob
lems, selection of activities, dating,
conduct, apportionment of study,
explanation of the meaning and
purposes of campus institutions and
organizations. In short, they were
to be leaders and trainers of future
leaders.
A SUCCESS
The plan has been an overwhelm
ing success, according to Miss Yost,
Miss Lataillade (Miss "La"), direc
tor of Roble, the sponsors, and the
girls themselves.
The morning following that fa
mous night Dean Mary gained ap
proval for the plan from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, President of the
University, and the machinery was
set in motion. Soon colleges and
universities all over the country
copied this plan that was created at

Stanford.
The system of selecting Roble (
sponsors, as it has evolved through j
23 years, now consists of selection j
by a committee composed of the |
president of Women's Conference i
and members of other leading j
women's organizations on campus. ]
The chief counselor's office desig
nates the members each year.
MUST APPLY
Women interested in becoming
sponsors write papers giving their
purposes and qualifications, inter- !
views are held, and qualifications
are investigated. For each of Ro
ble's eleven corridors one junior |
and one senior woman are selected. '

to Miss Yost was to have a group
of specially selected women, soro
rity and non-sorority, give up their
sorority and living group affiliations
for one year and come to live in
Roble as sponsors. They were to
act as middlemen between the
"green" frosh and the adults in the
offices and halls. They were to in
terpret the administration to the
frosh and the frosh to the adminis
tration. They were to help the new
women in their adjustment prob
lems, selection of activities, dating,
conduct, apportionment of study,
explanation of the meaning and
purposes of campus institutions and
organizations. In short, they were
to be leaders and trainers of future
leaders.
A SUCCESS
The plan has been an overwhelm
ing success, according to Miss Yost,
Miss Lataillade (Miss "La"), direc
tor of Roble, the sponsors, and the
girls themselves.
The morning following that fa
mous night Dean Mary gained ap
proval for the plan from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, President of the
University, and the machinery was
set in motion. Soon colleges and
universities all over the country
copied this plan that was created at

Stanford.
The system of selecting Roble (
sponsors, as it has evolved through j
23 years, now consists of selection j
by a committee composed of the |
president of Women's Conference i
and members of other leading j
women's organizations on campus. ]
The chief counselor's office desig
nates the members each year.
MUST APPLY
Women interested in becoming
sponsors write papers giving their
purposes and qualifications, inter- !
views are held, and qualifications
are investigated. For each of Ro
ble's eleven corridors one junior |
and one senior woman are selected. '
Because freshmen are also being 1
housed in Branner, there are also '
five sponsors stationed there.
Through Roble's notorious "Com- |
mittee of Five" new freshman girls |
first realize they are not completely
free souls and must abide by rules
of conduct. This committee is com
posed of two senior sponsors and
three junior sponsors.
MANY BENEFITS
Besides success in carrying out its
primary purposes the sponsor sys
tem has resulted in a variety of
benefits, such as the counseling and
recruiting experience gained by the
sponsors themselves.
One sponsor remarked:
"The position of a sponsor is be-

I tween being a mother and being a
J fellow student. The sponsor is not
a wailing post!"
SOME SACRIFICE
The job, however, is not without
| sacrifice. It often means social iso
[ lation for the sponsor, for she does
i not have the social contacts with
men her own age that she had in
1 her previous living group, but is
j usually swamped by frosh men. She
often loses contact with her old liv
ing group friends, and many times
I it seems as if a stamp were put on
j her as being severe or a Puritan.
Much of the sponsor's time is ab
j sorbed in meetings and in just, "be-
I ing around" to help the freshmen,
j The sponsor must learn to adjust to
' her role without sacrificing her own
| studying and personal life.
Standing as evidence of the gen
uine pride in their jobs, the satis
faction, and experience derived
from sponsoring is the fact that
practically every one of the present
junior sponsors is eager to return to
Roble as a sponsor in her senior
year. â€¢

emeritus, who helped institute
the sponsor system.
When the doors of home close be
hind a new freshman girl and she
finds herself separated from her
sheltered life and her emotional ties,
she steps into Stanford not alone
but with a friend, a link with her
new way of life. That friend is a
Roble sponsor.
This story is to glorify the Roble
sponsor, whose origin smacks of the
legend of Archimedes and his dash
through the streets shouting "Eu
reka!"
Former Dean of Women Mary
Yost tells and retells the story of
how the sponsor system was born
with unexhaustive pleasure because:
"ft typifies the 'spirit' of Roble
sponsoring."
MODERN COUNTERPARTS
Archimedes' modern counterparts
were three sorority girls, Meribeth
Cameron, Anna Fitzhugh. and the
third is unidentified, fn the middle
of one spring night in 1924, they
were seen dashing down the street
to Dean Mary's house, which was
consistently left unlocked through
negligence. The three girls knocked,
but Dean Mary, stalwart in her de
termination to read in bed undis
turbed, ignored the knocking. The
three Archimedeses, completely ob
livious to time and place, burst in,
dashed upstairs, perched upon Dean
Mary's bed and blurted forth their
plan for replacing the unpopular
"big sister" plan.
"1 can still see them," reminisces
Dean Mary, "their eyes shining and
so fdled with their idea nothing else
mattered."
Under the ill - functioning "big
sister" plan for orienting incoming
freshman women, each upperclass
woman was assigned the names of
two or three new freshman girls to
whom she was to write during the
summer. Everyone, especially the
new freshmen, suffered under this
plan. Sorority women were not per

mitted to talk with these new wom
en after they arrived at Stanford
until rushing m winter quarter;
many of the new women failed to
receive letters and felt hurt; little
could be accomplished in the way
of orientation by these few letters.
