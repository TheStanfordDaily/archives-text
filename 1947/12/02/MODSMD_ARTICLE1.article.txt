## 
### 
PARIS, Tuesday, Dec. 2 (UP).—Communist
deputies broke up a meeting of the National j
Assembly last night, defied threats of eviction, !
and started what promised to be an all-night j
sit down strike in the parliamentary chamber.

Leaders of (he assembly's central
bureau, at an emergency meeting,
decided against an immediate order
to the assembly guards to throw the
Communists out and postponed any
action until morning.
At 12:30 a.m. the Communist bloc
remained in possession of the cham
ber while members of other parties
milled angrily about the corridors
and their leaders discussed the situa
lion with Assembly President Ed
ouard Herriot.
reds' ousting urged
At 1:15 a.m. a committee of all
Assembly groups except the Com
munists demanded that Herriot oust
the Communists and call the As
sembly immediately into session. At
the same time Communist leader
Lacques Duclos demanded that if
anybody were ejected it be done
after the Assembly had met. But
most of the Assembly officials had
gone home and members saw little
prospect of action.
The communist defiance, part of a
plan to sabotage passage of Premier
Robert Schuman's drastic bill to out
law strike picketing and Red labor
agitation, climaxed a day of ever
growing union walkouts.
The Paris subways were paralyzed
by an electric power strike.
TROOPS HALT PARADE
Troops in Nancy used tear gas
to break up a parade of thousands
of strikers on the Joeuf Iron Works
where they sought to force workers
to quit.
Schuman sent armed troops to
battle pickets if necessary in the
northern France coal fields.
Several strikers were injured in
clashes with mobile guards at Lon
gwy, near the Luxembourg border,
and a central strike committee in
Marseilles, France's second city and
greatest port, ordered a general
strike in protest against the gov
ernments anti-strike program.

LONDON, Tuesday, Dec. 2 (UP). —French
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault left for Paris
late last night, temporarily abandoning his work
in the Big Four foreign ministers conference
because of the grave French political crisis.

♦- Well-informed sources asserted
i that one reason for his departure
was a threat by Gen. Charles De
! Gaulle, emerging right wing leader,
I to "veto" any decision on Germany
j by the Big Four foreign ministers
i which he did not approve--should lie
j gain political power in France.
During his absence — which his
; fellow delegates hoped would last
| only a day or two—major decisions
on any of the problems facing the
| Big Four will be impossible.
Conference quarters made no se-
I cret also of the fear that continuance
of the crisis between Communists
and the French government may
make impossible any big decisions
by this conference on the German
and Austrian treaties.
"SPARRING FOR TIME"
"East and West here—Russia and
; the Western allies—are sparring for
I time while the issue is being joined
in Paris," an influential member of
the American delegation said.
"East and West are debating their
conflict with words here. In Paris
the cold war is being 'fought' in the
streets and in the Chamber of Dep
| uties. If the Communists win in
Paris our arguments here will be
come even more academic."
The French delegation denied Sun
day reports that Bidault would go to
Paris yesterday, pointing to his en
gagement list.
CRISES HURT CONFERENCE
Ever since the foreign ministers
' met here a week ago, the shadow
of the French and Italian political
crises darkened the conference at
mosphere.
With the two key countries of
western Europe in turmoil the Big
Four are reluctant to take decisions
on Germany and Austria. Worsen
ing of the situation, especially in
France, might make it impossible for
the foreign ministers, to commit
themselves on their most important
problems.
