A revised constitution was pro

Council meeting by a committee
under the chairmanship of ' Bob
Simpson.
Some important innovations of
the new constitution are: the au

and the provision for the election
of the president and vice-president
early in the fall quarter to serve for
the entire year. At this time, offi
cers are elected for a term of one
school quarter.
The revised constitution will be
posted at the houses for approval
and will be voted upon at commit

houses, a three - fourths majority,
must ratify it before it can be pre
sented to Excorn.
Other business included the ap
pointment of Keith Dichl as stu
dent manager for the new game
room.
