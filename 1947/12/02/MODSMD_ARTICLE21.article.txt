CHICAGO — Atomic scientists
permitted newsmen today to in

The newsmen saw silver turned

uranium turned to plutonium. and
learned that the furnaces could be
used to turn base metal into gold in
fulfillment of the dreams of medi
eval alchemists.
The newsmen were the first visi

1942, in a converted squash court
beneath Stagg Field on the Univer
