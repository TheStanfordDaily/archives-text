# Music Group Will Perform In Mem Aud
## 
### NED SACK 
Offering a program of both clas
sical and modern pieces, the Uni
versity Chorus and Orchestra will
present their intial joint concert of
the year tonight at 7:30 in the Me
morial Auditorium.
Highlight of the evening will be
the premiere performance of "Pas
toral," which was composed by Dr.
Leonard Ratner, University Orches
tra conductor, and scored especially
for the orchestra.
Numbers by the chorus will in
clude a Bach selection and two light
songs from Irving Fine's "Alice in
Wonderland "
The orchestra, containing 50
members, is of full symphony di
mensions. In the past, outsiders
were called upon to fill in parts, but
this year students were found to
play all the necessary instruments.
By working in co-operation with
music instruction classes, the or
chestra, which gives interested stu
dents an opportunity to play on a
symphonic scale, provides a vehicle
for trying out any student compo
sition or orchestral arrangement.
The University Chorus represents
a new experiment that is develop
ing rapidly. Founded last year, the
group now boasts 110 voices in
well-balanced sections. Members of
the University Choir will assist the
chorus in tonight's scene from "Bo
ris Goudonov," under the direction
of Harold Schmidt, who will make
his debut as chorus director.
