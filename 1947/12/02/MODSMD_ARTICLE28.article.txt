# Daily Grows from Rural DPA To Modern, Streamlined Dippy
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is the second in a series
of three articles on publications
of another era. Today we take
you hack in time to witness a
journalistic hlessed event.)
Turn back the clock, if you
will, to Sept. 30, 1926, and set
tle back against a neat pine wall
that is but a part of the Stanford
Daily newspaper office.
An important event is about
to unfold, namely the transition
of the Daily Palo Alto to the
Stanford Daily.
And if you're there at 2:05 a.m.,
a pressman, his printer's smock
smeared with ink, will casually
walk out from the back shop beam
ing like an honest man thrust be
fore the gaze of a persevering Di
ogenes.
"Congratulations, Mister Bennett.
You're the father of a wonderful,
brand new paper!"
f'TSS AND FIDGET
Mr. Bennett—Harry M. Bennett,
to be exact—will fuss and fidget and
begin to stammer as only Daily edi
tors of that era have been known to
fuss, fidget, and stammer.
"The paper weighed eight pages
;it birth and is presumed to be rest
ing comfortably," onlookers will de
clare later in the day.
Ordinarily one will pick up a dog
eared copy of an early Daily (circa
J!) 17) and laugh his blooming head
off. Style, format, and presentation
of news were mechanical, and a
typical headline of the day would
iead:
NEW PHONE INSTALLED
ON FLOOR OF ENCINA
During the editorial reign of Neil
11. Petree, advertising took a de
cided turn for the better despite
"hanging panel trimmed with Hud
son seal to match choker collar"
type of ads.
EVEN A FIFTH COLUMN
At first, The Daily, then known
as the Daily Palo Alto, was four
columns wide, increasing to five
columns in width in 1914. In 1920,
the paper had jumped to six col
umns.
Classified ads, a key feature since
the turn of the century, were a
mixture of "lost signet rings" to

"Wanted—ride to Thiensvillc next
Saturday."
Editors have kidded each other
from volume to volume, taking time
out on the last issue of the current
volume in publication to toss
naught but words of success to the
next editor.
Even the works of Omar Khay
yam have crept silently onto the
pages of The Daily:
"The moving finger writes
"And, having writ, moves on."
From seemingly time immemo
rial, the Stanford publication has
ungratefully been tagged wilh the
pseudonym of "The Dippy," since
one bright undergrad, shortly after
the '0(5 earthquake, in a hurry to
return to ihe DPA office (Daily Palo
Alto) mispronounced the three in

itials and inadvertently hurried back
to the "Dippy office."
PLAGUE IS FORESTALLED
Back in 1918, a journalistic plague
was averted when a news ed
itor, H. G. Swendsen, apparently
encased in a cloak of chickenpox,
decided on taking a vacation for a
while. Svendsen was quarantined,
even refusing to send any written
copy to the Daily office for fear
others would be contaminated.
Fires, floods, Axe parties, plagues!
The Daily has reported on all of
ihem.
A tradition of deep-rooted busi
ness and laughter marks the Stan
ford Daily like a banner headline
on a postage stamp which, one may
observe, is a far cry from an event
ful morning in '2(5.


The five gentlemen above represent The Daily's contribution to the
fifth estate. Notice Ihe avid interest displayed by all five reporters, who
seemingly are in the midst of a busy afternoon.

Back in 1918, a journalistic plague
was averted when a news ed
itor, H. G. Swendsen, apparently
encased in a cloak of chickenpox,
decided on taking a vacation for a
while. Svendsen was quarantined,
even refusing to send any written
copy to the Daily office for fear
others would be contaminated.
Fires, floods, Axe parties, plagues!
The Daily has reported on all of

A tradition of deep-rooted busi

ford Daily like a banner headline
on a postage stamp which, one may
observe, is a far cry from an event

Turn back the clock, if you
will, to Sept. 30, 1926, and set

An important event is about

of the Daily Palo Alto to the
Stanford Daily.
And if you're there at 2:05 a.m.,
a pressman, his printer's smock
smeared with ink, will casually
walk out from the back shop beam
ing like an honest man thrust be
fore the gaze of a persevering Di
ogenes.
"Congratulations, Mister Bennett.
You're the father of a wonderful,
brand new paper!"
f'TSS AND FIDGET
Mr. Bennett—Harry M. Bennett,
to be exact—will fuss and fidget and
begin to stammer as only Daily edi
tors of that era have been known to
fuss, fidget, and stammer.
"The paper weighed eight pages
;it birth and is presumed to be rest

clare later in the day.
Ordinarily one will pick up a dog

off. Style, format, and presentation
of news were mechanical, and a
