### 
LOS ANGELES, Doc. 1 (UP).â€”
Coach Jcft' Cravath sent the South
ern California football varsity
through a bisk scrimmage against
the junior varsity on a soggy prac
tice field today.
The Trojan coach said he is at-
U :npting desperately to devise a de
fense against Notre Dame's passing
and running attack.
Physicians informed the coach
that Bob Hendren, first-string right
tackle, would miss both the Notre
Dame game Saturday and the Rose
Bowl encounter because of a com
pound fracture of his jaw.
