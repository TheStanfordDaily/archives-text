# Sec. Harriman Explains Plan For Controls

### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UP).â€”
Secretary of Commerce W. Averill
Harriman said today that, if Con
gress approves, the administration
would consider restoring price con
trols and rationing of meat "at
once."
He predicted that failure to im
pose such "selective" curbs on ris
ing living costs might make it nec
essary later to "put on the brakes
by some type of general freeze of
prices and wages."
Harriman appeared before the
House Banking Committee to re
new the President's campaign for
anti-inflation legislation amid grow
ing signs that most of the pro
gram will be rejected.
QUESTIONED ON POWER
Chairman Jesse P. Wolcott, R.,
Mich., who reported that his own
mail is running "99 to 1" against
controls, tried to pin Harriman
down on specific administration
plans to use the emergency powers
if the GOP - controlled Congress
should grant them.
In response to his persistent ques
tioning, Harriman said:
"Meat is the greatest difficulty to
day and would be given attention
at once." An anticipated shortage
next spring, coupled with high
prices, "might set off an inflationary
spiral that would be serious."
STAMP OUT 'GRAY MARKET'
He said that second priority
would be given to steel and that an
attempt would be made to "stamp
out the gray market with alloca
tions and price ceilings."
Textiles, aluminum, building ma
terials, and newsprint were other
commodities which he said need at
tention. In these industries, he add
ed, leaders would be "called in for
conferences."
He said he didn't like controls;
that they would be imposed only if
"appeals to industry and to consum
ers" failed to correct "price abuses."
