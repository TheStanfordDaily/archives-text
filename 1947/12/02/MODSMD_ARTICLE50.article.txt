Four varsity football players
turned out for basketball practice
yesterday to bolster Coach Everett
Dean's cage squad.
The four, Gene Martin, Jack Cra
han, Freddy Parsons, and Mike
Durket, worked out with the re
serves. Martin and Crahan were on
last year's B squad, and Martin also
saw some varsity action.
The cagers are propping for their
tilt tomorrow night with the San
Jose State five, after two wins in as
many games last week.
Coach Dean was pleased with the
work of his players in the Olympic-
Club contest which the Indians
won, 7G to 40.
The remainder of the pre-Christ
mas vacation basketball schedule is
as follows: After the Spartan game,
the varsity takes on Fresno State
next Monday.
The frosh will play Salinas JC as
a preliminary tomorrow night and
meet Galileo High School of San
Francisco in the opening game of a
twin bill Saturday afternoon. The
reserves tackle Modesto JC as the
other half of this program. The
games are scheduled for 2 and 3
o'clock respectively.
The frosh are then Idle for the
rest of the quarter, with the re
serves playing the preliminary for
the Fresno State game against Men
lo JC.
