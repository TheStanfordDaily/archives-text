# Intramural Semi-Final Ends in Tie
## 
### 
In a game which featured tugged
line play and frequent outbursts of
temper, the Sigma Nil's and the Big
Red Machine battled to a scoreless
tie in the semi-finals of the intra
mural football playoffs yesterday
afternoon.
Both teams came close to scoring
on several occasions, but lacked the
final drive to take it all the way.
The Big Red Machine appeared on
their way to a touchdown midway
in the first half as they penetrated
within the 20-yard line as a result
of Sam Paine's accurate passing.
But Jack Wood intercepted Paine's
next pass, and the scoring threat
was squelched.
The Sigma Nu's threatened to
score throughout the second half as
Herb Eggleston's parses and the end

runs of speedy Pal Byrne kept the
Machine men backed against their
own goal. However, an effective
pass defense and timely intercep
tions prevented the Rowmen from
hitting pay dirt.
The line play on both sides was
outstanding as the lack of scoring
indicates. Herb Johnson and Bill
Edlund were hampering Paine con
siderably on pass plays and Charlie
Mayo for the Big Red-Machine was
continually breaking up offensive
thrusts around his side of the line.
The game will have to be re
played in order to determine which
team will paticipate in the finals.
