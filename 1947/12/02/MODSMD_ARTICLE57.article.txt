# A 						Progressive Suggestion
## 
### 
One of the most progressive suggestions of
Ihe quarter was made to Excom by Excom
member Ted Norton last week.
Norton suggested that two assistant student
managers be appointed.
The presence of assistant student managers
would expedite the work which now falls on the
shoulders of the Student Manager. Routine
work which must now be done by one person
could be delegated to assistants. The result
would be a faster-operating, more efficient
ASSU office.
The assistant manager's job would also be a
position in which prospective student managers
could be trained. Under the routine now in ef
fect the incoming Student Manager has had no
particular indoctrination with ASSU routine.

Naturally, for quite some time he is learning
the duties of the office and is unable to be as
useful to the student body as he otherwise
would be.
The Student Manager is appointed by the
General Manager of the Board of Athletic Con
trol in his capacity as financial officer of the
ASSU. However, any plan which would make
the office of Student Manager more efficient
and provide an opportunity for the training of
future Student Managers should be approved
by that office.
The Student Manager is a bonded official but
none of his official duties would be relegated to
the assistants.
The appointment of assistant student man
agers would be a progressive move in keeping
with the growth of the size of the student body.
