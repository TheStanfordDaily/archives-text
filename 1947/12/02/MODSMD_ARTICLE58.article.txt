# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
Well, counting today, there are only 23 shop
lifting days till Christmas.
I've been trying to figure out what to give my
professors. I had a gift picked out for one of them,
but the druggist said I had to have a Doctor's pre
scription.
Oh well, maybe he'll die a natural death One of
my favorite high school teachers died the other day
of the teaching professions' most dangerous occupa
tional hazard—chalk dust on the lungs. It's sort of an
academic silicosis.
Some professors are very nice though. They even
have a sense of humor. I know one professor who
reads Bull Session for laughs. Come to think of it
I know students who attend his classes for the same
reason.
But this doesn't solve the Gift problem.
There's one old aristocrat—l was thinking of get
ting him a 20-foot pole for not touching twice the
persons he wouldn't touch once with a 10-foot pole.
And there's my prof in health and hygiene—a
square bathtub that doesn't leave rings would be nice
for him.
A set of Dickens always makes a nice gift for
English professors. There are just about enough
books in a set to fill a normal shelf without having
space left over at the ends to fill in with comic books.

I've already bought a box of cigars for a non-smok
ing professor of mine. I wanted to get him a lasting
gift.
And I saw, in an oriental shop in San Francisco, a
cute little statue of Buddha. It was carved out ol a
single rock and weighed around four tons. Just the
thing for a busy professor who needs a paperweight.
Selecting presents isn't the really hard job. Its
paying for them. My definition of forethought is the
guy who thinks of January s GI check, while he is
incurring December's Christmas bills.
Not that I'm broke. I have something laid away for
a rainy day. It's an umbrella.
Of course if you wait until Christmas Eve you can
pick up all sorts ol bargains. Merchants start mai king
$50.00 items down to $49.50, which had previously been
marked up from $25.00 in November.
It's all part of the large picture of the Christmas
spirit, which includes everything from forgetting to
send cards to those people from whom you received
one to selling your car to pay for the gifts that the
people who received them will exchange.
An organized chaos of wilting Christmas trees,
burned out lights, surprises and disappointments, with
the realization that Christmas is followed by New
Years, and roast turkeys will be supplanted by stewed
people.
