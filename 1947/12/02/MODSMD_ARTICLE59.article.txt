### ALLEN BLETZ 
Looking back over some of the work accomplished
hy the 79th Congress, it is interesting to note that
once again the House passed an anti-poll-tax bill.
However, this does not mean a thing. The bill did not
reach the door of the Senate, and if it did it would be
killed by a filibuster.
The House of Representatives has passed such bills
before —in 1942 by a vote of 254 to 84: in 1943 by a
vote of 2(55 to 110; in 1945 by a vote of 251 to 105. The
vote that was taken in this Congress, on July 22, 1947,
was 290 to 112—the highest yet, with 216 Republicans
reinforced by 73 Democrats.
Representatives Rankin of Mississippi and Pickett of
Texas led the opposition, both speaking for states in
which the poll tax is still a means of preventing citi
zens from voting. Once again these "great American
Senators" used the same arguments that had been
used before.
Among other things, they said that the Federal
Government cannot constitutionally abolish the poll
tax requirement for voting. But it seems to me that if

spokesmen for poll-tax states, such as "righteous"
Rankin and '"pure" Pickett, had real confidence in this
argument, they would not need to make such des
perate efforts—efforts such as a sit-down strike in the
Senate on all legislation—to keep a bill from passing.
The argument against the poll tax is not that the
Federal Government has a right to interfere in the
domestic concerns of the states. It is that an artificially
limited franchise in elections to federal offices is an
interference by some states in the affairs of the nation.
Laws which concern all of us arc acted upon, some
times decisively, by representatives from the limited
franchise districts. The results might be different if
all those morally entitled to vote were actually enabled
to vote.
The limited franchise in Virginia, Texas, Missis
sippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, and Ar
kansas is very much the business of citizens of New
York, California, and other states. Some day this fact
will be generally realized, and some day the Senate
will have to get off its "high-horse" and back the
House up in anti-poll tax legislation.

Looking back over some of the work accomplished
hy the 79th Congress, it is interesting to note that
once again the House passed an anti-poll-tax bill.
However, this does not mean a thing. The bill did not
reach the door of the Senate, and if it did it would be
killed by a filibuster.
The House of Representatives has passed such bills
before —in 1942 by a vote of 254 to 84: in 1943 by a
vote of 2(55 to 110; in 1945 by a vote of 251 to 105. The
vote that was taken in this Congress, on July 22, 1947,
was 290 to 112—the highest yet, with 216 Republicans
reinforced by 73 Democrats.
Representatives Rankin of Mississippi and Pickett of
Texas led the opposition, both speaking for states in
which the poll tax is still a means of preventing citi
zens from voting. Once again these "great American
Senators" used the same arguments that had been
used before.
Among other things, they said that the Federal
Government cannot constitutionally abolish the poll
tax requirement for voting. But it seems to me that if

spokesmen for poll-tax states, such as "righteous"
Rankin and '"pure" Pickett, had real confidence in this
argument, they would not need to make such des
perate efforts—efforts such as a sit-down strike in the
Senate on all legislation—to keep a bill from passing.
The argument against the poll tax is not that the
Federal Government has a right to interfere in the
domestic concerns of the states. It is that an artificially
limited franchise in elections to federal offices is an
interference by some states in the affairs of the nation.
Laws which concern all of us arc acted upon, some
times decisively, by representatives from the limited
franchise districts. The results might be different if
all those morally entitled to vote were actually enabled
to vote.
The limited franchise in Virginia, Texas, Missis
sippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, and Ar
kansas is very much the business of citizens of New
York, California, and other states. Some day this fact
will be generally realized, and some day the Senate
will have to get off its "high-horse" and back the
House up in anti-poll tax legislation.
