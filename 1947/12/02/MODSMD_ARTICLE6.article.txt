### 
LONDON, Dec. 1 (UP). —The
United States tonight gave up its
demand that the Big Four Foreign
Ministers write the German peace
treaty on the basis of recommenda
tions made by a two-thirds majority
of countries represented at the Ger
man peace conference.
Russian Foreign Minister Viache
slav Molotov and French Foreign
Minister Georges Bidault agreed to
a new proposal by Secretary of
State George C. Marshall that the
Big Four merely "take into consid
eration" recommendations which the
conference may make, either by a
two-thirds or simple majority vote.
British Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin, supporting the vigorous
claim of the British dominions for a
greater small - nation voice in the
German treaty than was conceded
in the case of the German satellite
treaties, alone held out.
Bevin asked that the Big Four
consider whether the peace confer
ence itself might decide its own vot
ing procedure—which would mean
that the countries in it would give
themselves a decisive voice.
Molotov at today's meeting of the
Big Four Foreign Ministers made a
40-minute statement during which
he denounced an American propo
sal that a clause be put into the
German treaty making the German
people responsible for its carrying
out.
The clause would be inserted in
the German constitution. It would
specify that all powers exercised
under the constitution would be ex
ercised subject to and in accordance
with the treaty.
"If this clause is put into the
treaty," Molotov said, "it will turn
Germany into a colony in the center
of Europe and the Soviet Union
wants a democratic, peace - loving
Germany—not a colony of victors."
