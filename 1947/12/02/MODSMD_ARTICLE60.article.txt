## About Germany 
### 
Following are excerpts from a letter from a
Stanford graduate working with the military govern
ment in Heidelberg.)
To the Editor:
I understand Stanford is sending student represent
atives abroad to get first hand knowledge of condi
tions and report their findings. As opportunities for
travel in Germany are almost non-existent I thought
perhaps some students might like to know what con
ditions are here after two and a half years of occupa
tion, as seen through the eyes of a Stanford student
of recent vintage (class of 46) ....
Everywhere I've been the activities of the people
are determined and their thoughts dominated by the
problem of getting enough food. The average ration
in Heidelberg last week was under 1300 calories a day.
A German asked me the other day when we were going
to stop feeding them calories and start feeding them
food. This ration includes about .4 oz. of meat. .2 oz.
of fat (including butter, margarine, and oils). 13 oz.
brown bread, 10 oz. potatoes, and .5 oz. ersatz coffee
(which tastes as much like coffee as does muddy
water.)
This noon I visited a secondary school (equivalent
lo our fifth through 12th grades); in the front ball was
a large val cooker full of a brown soupy mixture which
the cook identified as noodles. A small serving is
given to each student as his hot "noon meal. Often
in the afternoon I've seen children carrying their
(liririci pails Willi just a few tablespoons of their lunch
aved p»*rhap« for someone at home. With the ap
proach of winter, people are becoming even more
concerned about tin: food situation, especially as they

are living on what they can get from day to day. . . .
Everywhere I go the workers seem to want more,
say in the operation of the plants; they suggest any
number of forms of socialism. Yet, none of the workers
I have talked to wants communist control. They're
afraid of communism. Several people objected because
the U.S. military government licensed a communist
newspaper in Mannheim. When I asked a number
of people if they were going to vote in the municipal
elections next month and why, half of them said it
was their "holy duty" to vote and half said if they
didn't the communists might get into office. Next to
not getting enough food to eat the main concern of
the people I've met is that the U.S. will leave Ger
many and a communistic government will be forced
on them. (At the same time they blame us for most
of their difficulties.) ....
The uncertainty of the future seems to be felt
more strongly by the university students than anyone
else. A number of students told me they don't know
what they're working for, they see very little encour
agement for the future of Germany as a democratic
nation; many want to emigrate
But they, as well as the rest of the population must
have enough to eat; right now every man is chiefly
concerned about bis own daily bread. If he has that
he will be more interested in building a responsible
government, and he'll think the Voice of America is
something more than hot air emitted by the radio
transmitter
As I am going to be in Germany for some time
and often find occasion to go down to France and
Switzerland (no where else as yet) I will be more
than pleased to provide any information I can for
.students planning to come over here

elections next month and why, half of them said it
was their "holy duty" to vote and half said if they
didn't the communists might get into office. Next to
not getting enough food to eat the main concern of
the people I've met is that the U.S. will leave Ger
many and a communistic government will be forced
on them. (At the same time they blame us for most
of their difficulties.) ....
The uncertainty of the future seems to be felt
more strongly by the university students than anyone
else. A number of students told me they don't know
what they're working for, they see very little encour
agement for the future of Germany as a democratic
nation; many want to emigrate
But they, as well as the rest of the population must
have enough to eat; right now every man is chiefly
concerned about bis own daily bread. If he has that
he will be more interested in building a responsible
government, and he'll think the Voice of America is
something more than hot air emitted by the radio
transmitter
As I am going to be in Germany for some time
and often find occasion to go down to France and
Switzerland (no where else as yet) I will be more
than pleased to provide any information I can for
.students planning to come over here

Following are excerpts from a letter from a
Stanford graduate working with the military govern
ment in Heidelberg.)
To the Editor:
I understand Stanford is sending student represent
atives abroad to get first hand knowledge of condi
tions and report their findings. As opportunities for
travel in Germany are almost non-existent I thought
perhaps some students might like to know what con
ditions are here after two and a half years of occupa
tion, as seen through the eyes of a Stanford student
of recent vintage (class of 46) ....
Everywhere I've been the activities of the people
are determined and their thoughts dominated by the
problem of getting enough food. The average ration
in Heidelberg last week was under 1300 calories a day.
A German asked me the other day when we were going
to stop feeding them calories and start feeding them
food. This ration includes about .4 oz. of meat. .2 oz.
of fat (including butter, margarine, and oils). 13 oz.
brown bread, 10 oz. potatoes, and .5 oz. ersatz coffee
(which tastes as much like coffee as does muddy
water.)
This noon I visited a secondary school (equivalent
lo our fifth through 12th grades); in the front ball was
a large val cooker full of a brown soupy mixture which
the cook identified as noodles. A small serving is
given to each student as his hot "noon meal. Often
in the afternoon I've seen children carrying their
(liririci pails Willi just a few tablespoons of their lunch
aved p»*rhap« for someone at home. With the ap
proach of winter, people are becoming even more
concerned about tin: food situation, especially as they

are living on what they can get from day to day. . . .
Everywhere I go the workers seem to want more,
say in the operation of the plants; they suggest any
number of forms of socialism. Yet, none of the workers
I have talked to wants communist control. They're
afraid of communism. Several people objected because
the U.S. military government licensed a communist
newspaper in Mannheim. When I asked a number
of people if they were going to vote in the municipal
elections next month and why, half of them said it
was their "holy duty" to vote and half said if they
didn't the communists might get into office. Next to
not getting enough food to eat the main concern of
the people I've met is that the U.S. will leave Ger
