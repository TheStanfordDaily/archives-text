### 
Despite the seeming obstacle of
Russia, world government is obtain
able, declared Allen Cranston, noted
author, and chairman of the State
Board of United World Federalists,
last night at a meeting sponsored by
Stanford chapter of Student Feder
alists.
Speaking on the topic, "Is Russia
an Obstacle to World Government?"
Cranston answered the pessimist ar
gument that world government is a
good idea but can't be accomplished
because of Russia's belligerent atti
tude.
In world government, nations
would have votes in proportion to
population and size; whereas in
the United Nations, each nation has
one vote, regardless of size, he de
clared. Russia is consistently out
voted, he added.
RUSSIAN DISTRUST
"Although the Russians distrust
the United Nations, many believe
that Russian policy will change, if
and when they see that the United
States will not have an economic
collapse," he pointed out.
Cranston also indicated that an
abrupt change in Russian policy is
always possible. If enough nations
go ahead and join the world federa
tion bandwagon, Russia will possibly
join also.
"Russia has never been presented
with an official plan of world govern
ment; therefore we don't know what
their official attitude would be on
this matter."
INCREASED SUPPORT
Support of world government has
increased considerably in past years.
Fourteen United States senators have
gone on record for world govern
ment. Fifteen states have passed res
olutions favoring world government.
A bill for world government is
pending in Congress. France and
Italy have clauses in their constitu
tions permitting their nations to join
a world government if and when it is
proposed.
Supporting Cranston's statement,
Richard Kelton, chairman of the
Student Division of United World
Federalists, and member of the State
Board of United World Federalists,
also spoke. "We have within our
hands the power to kill ourselves,
despite what Russia does. It is the
task of the United States to lead in
fhe movement for world govern
ment," he stated.
"Ihe first step toward world gov
ernment is convincing people (hat
it. is necessary. George won't do our
dying for us. If we want peace, we
must work for it and earn it. There
can be no peace without world law
and no world law without world gov
ernment," he concluded.

olutions favoring world government.
A bill for world government is
pending in Congress. France and
Italy have clauses in their constitu
tions permitting their nations to join
a world government if and when it is
proposed.
Supporting Cranston's statement,
Richard Kelton, chairman of the
Student Division of United World
Federalists, and member of the State
Board of United World Federalists,
also spoke. "We have within our
hands the power to kill ourselves,
despite what Russia does. It is the
task of the United States to lead in
fhe movement for world govern
ment," he stated.
"Ihe first step toward world gov
ernment is convincing people (hat
it. is necessary. George won't do our
dying for us. If we want peace, we
must work for it and earn it. There
can be no peace without world law
and no world law without world gov
ernment," he concluded.
Despite the seeming obstacle of
Russia, world government is obtain
able, declared Allen Cranston, noted
author, and chairman of the State
Board of United World Federalists,
last night at a meeting sponsored by
Stanford chapter of Student Feder
alists.
Speaking on the topic, "Is Russia
an Obstacle to World Government?"
Cranston answered the pessimist ar
gument that world government is a
good idea but can't be accomplished
because of Russia's belligerent atti
tude.
In world government, nations
would have votes in proportion to
population and size; whereas in
the United Nations, each nation has
one vote, regardless of size, he de
clared. Russia is consistently out
voted, he added.
RUSSIAN DISTRUST
"Although the Russians distrust
the United Nations, many believe
that Russian policy will change, if
and when they see that the United
States will not have an economic
collapse," he pointed out.
Cranston also indicated that an
abrupt change in Russian policy is
always possible. If enough nations
go ahead and join the world federa
tion bandwagon, Russia will possibly
join also.
"Russia has never been presented
with an official plan of world govern
ment; therefore we don't know what
their official attitude would be on
this matter."
INCREASED SUPPORT
Support of world government has
increased considerably in past years.
Fourteen United States senators have
gone on record for world govern
ment. Fifteen states have passed res
olutions favoring world government.
A bill for world government is
pending in Congress. France and
Italy have clauses in their constitu
tions permitting their nations to join
a world government if and when it is
proposed.
