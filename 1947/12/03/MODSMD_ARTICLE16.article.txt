# French Pass No-Strike Bill
## 
### 
PARIS, Dcc. 3 (UP).—The French
National Assembly passed the first
article of Premier Robert Schu
man's drastic anti-strike bill today
despite a prolonged Communist fili
buster which came in the midst of
a tense labor war that produced
five pitched battles between strik
ers and police yesterday.
The vote was 402 to 184. Only
the Communists —and all of them—
voted against the article, which sus
pends two articles of the French
Penal Code and permits the gov
ernment to imprison labor agitators
for up to 10 years for infringing on
"the right to work."
MARATHON DEBATE
Communist deputies, in a nearly
empty Assembly chamber, contin
ued their marathon debate on Pre
mier Robert Schuman's second cri
sis measure, proposing stiff fines and
jail sentences for persons interfer
ing with "the right to work."
Sixty strike rioters in Marseille
already had been jailed for ob
structing freedom to work even be
fore the Assembly began consider
ation of the measure.
The Assembly finally brought the
bill to (he floor yesterday over
Communist opposition which in
cluded a sit-down strike by Red
deputies. One Communist was
ejected from the chamber for "in
citation to revolt."
COMIC RELIEF
A touch of comic relief was pro
vided at midnight when Communist
Gilbert do Chambrun proposed an
amendment stating thai the pro
posed law could not be user! to in
fringe the constitutional right of
French workers to strike.
Justice Minister Andre Marie
startled the Communists by accept
ing llie amendment and calling for
a voir. The majority approved the
amendment and only the Commu
nists voted "no"—■'against their own
motion.
Strikers and police clashed yes
terday in Rouen, Paris, Marseille,
Limoges, and the coal fields of
northern France.
