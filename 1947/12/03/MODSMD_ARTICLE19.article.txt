# US Defends Military Role Of Small Allied Countries

### 
LONDON, Doc. 2 (UP).—Secretary of State George C. Marshall
sharply rebuked Russian Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov
today for speaking slightingly of the part some smaller countries
played in the war and told him that America's vast lend-lease
aid to the Soviet Union was made possible by their co-operation.

Molotov, at a meeting of the Big
Four Foreign Ministers, was trying
as usual to keep as small as possible
the effective representation of allied
nations at the future German peace
conference. He vetoed proposals to
make China a sponsoring power in
calling this conference and Mar
shall's proposal to admit 53 nations in
all to it.
"The American proposal . . . would
lead to consultation with states
some of which declared war on
Germany only a few weeks before
Germany surrendered and some
states which helped Germany during
the war," Molotov said.
"I have no reflections to make on
other states which declared war on
Germany, as Mr. Molotov has done,"
Marshall said. "I value the co-oper
ation of these slates . . .
"This co-operation concerned air
fields, ports and port facilities—for
example, in the Persian gulf it was
possible to establish a supply base
for the Soviet Union. This is not to
be ignored."
In making his statement Marshall
was perhaps mindful that Russia
signed a treaty with Germany on the
eve of the war, ended it in June
1941, when Germany attacked her,
and entered the Far Eastern war on
Aug. 8 1945, two days after the
atomic bomb was dropped on Hiro
shima and six days before Japan
accepted surrender terms.
