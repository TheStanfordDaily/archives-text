# CIO Unions Ask Third Wage Hike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (UP).â€”
President Philip Murray today
flashed all CIO unions a go-ahead
to seek third - round wage in
creases when their contracts expire
because, he said, Congress and"the
reactionary forces" will do nothing
to stop inflation.
In a statement approved unani
mously by the ClO's nine vice
presidents in a day-long meeting,
Murray said that all CIO unions
will try to win substantial wage in
creases to "restore their loss in real
income suffered through inflation
and to assure sustained purchasing
power as the foundation for con
tinued maximum employment and
production."
He added that he hoped "it won't
be necessary to have strikes" to
reach that goal.
Murray dropped his bombshell
into President Truman's anti-infla
tion campaign as Congressional Re
publicans were moving to force Mr.
Truman to tighten up export con
trols as one means of heading off
higher prices.
The administration, in what may
have been an attempt to beat them
to the punch, announced that it was
clamping rigid controls on exports
of '56 more iron and steel products,
effective Jan. 1.
Murray renewed the ClO's de
mand that Congress approve Mr.
Truman's request for selective price
and rationing controls.
