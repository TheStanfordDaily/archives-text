## 
### 
Marking the fifth anniversary of
the atomic age, David E. Lilienthal,
| chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission, announced today that
the United States is producing "new
| atomic weapons from both uranium
, and plutonium."
Speaking before the 68th annual
meeting of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers in Atlantic
City, Lilienthal said that both of
I these materials are being used in
| atomic weapons in current produc
tion and under design at commis
sion laboratories. He cited Los Ala
mos, N.M., as one place where the
weapons arc being assembled cur-
I rently.
He displayed a small cylinder of
black uranium metal to the engi
neers.
"Only a lew years ago there was
j not this much uranium metal of this
| purity in the world; today we use
it by the ton," he said.
"If this country really means bus
iness, it, will have to double its
$2,500,000,000 atomic energy invest
ment," Lilienthal warned.
The Atomic Energy Commission
' chief spoke on the fifth anniversary
! of the day in Chicago when U.S.
j scientists produced mankind's first
I self-sustaining nuclear chain reac
l lion.
President Truman, in a message
j yesterday to a luncheon in honor of
J those scientists, said that, the an
! niversary emphasizes the impor
tance "of a vigorous effort to de
velop and utilize atomic energy for
peaceful purposes." The U.S. Atom
ic Energy Commission, he added,
is "aggressively supporting" all ef
forts to use atomic energy for peace
ful purposes.
