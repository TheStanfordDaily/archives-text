# 'The Old Menlo Road' Figures Prominently In Another Era
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
(This is the last in a series of
three articles on Stanford publi
cations of another era. Today we
speak of many things—the Chap
pie, Alumni Review, Quad, and
the famed 'prohibition battle" of
LflOS.)
The Old Boy with the cap and
bells and hammer was but two
steps from being known as "the
eucalyptus kid."
Back in May of 1899, Bristow Ad
iirns and Everett Smith, a pair of
psychology students, skipped class
otie morning and hurried over to
the Excom office.
It was no message to Garcia be
ing dispatched over alien territory,
but a warning that "Stanford would
soon have a humor magazine of its
own."
A VIA<; IS BORN
The two would - be humorists
made good their word and on Oct.
4 of the same year The Chaparral—
rather than The Eucalyptus as one
i'ag - lined filbert had suggested—
came into being.
During the same year, the Stan
ford Alumnus, edited by Charles
Schwartz, nonchalantly appeared on
the scene. A staid, accurate bit of
information, the Alumni Review of
1.599 resembled a small-town Mid
western weekly.
Typical folksy items included the
following:
"The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
gave a very successful return con
cert in the Assembly Hall on the
19th."
"Minnie Stocking, Education. '00,
is teaching in San Luis Obispo
County."
QUAD APPEARS ON SCENE
Not to be outdone by both the
Daily Palo Alto and the Chappie,
the Quad wormed its way on cam
pus, the "junior class of the pioneer
559" publishing the first annual at
Stanford.
But as long as Western Civ ex
ists, people of an era past are bound

to recall the famed "prohibition
battle" waged in 1908, which found
the DPA and the Chappie right on
the fringe of the ruckus.
We must remember, an observer
declared, that it was the day of the
saloon and the billiard hall. An un
official census taken in '08 would
have found 14 saloons in Menlo
Park alone—the end of a 3.2 drive
from the University campus.
"Meet me at Anzini's" was soon
to be a famous cry, or "Drop me
off at the Wunder." The Wunder,

an establishment now framed in
memories, was situated along the
old Los Trancos Road.
LIQUOR IS VERBOTEN
Because of a University regula
tion which forbade the trafficking
of liquor on campus, students were
tempted by "a drive to Menlo after
Rhetoric 4M."
In stepped the .Chappie: ' What we
need is student control!"
But the University, spearheaded
by University President David Starr
Jordan and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
chairman of the Civic Federation
composed of campus faculty resi
dents, issued a ban on "liquor on
campus." »
On March 12, 1908, one of the
most remarkable parades was
staged on campus near College Ter
race. To the accompaniment of
banging tin plates, singing, shout
ing, yelling, and even ihe discharge
of firearms, a crowd of students
marched in protest.
At the foot of the Founders' Stat
ue in Memorial Court, the procla
mation was burned in effigy.
Indignation from all sources flared
on campus, when 247 students
signed a petition declaring them
selves "a part of the mob which all
but slipped out of control yester
' day."
STANFORD IS SAVED
The 247 student-signers of the pe
tition were given their choice of
leaving Stanford or complying with
' established rule.
The Daily Palo Alto, in quoting
Professor Max Farrand, printed:
"Please God, Stanford is going to
I survive."
The storm, after striking its ze
nith, was again tranquil and nu
j merous were the actions which
were completely forgotten.
Despite his red cap and silver
bells, Ihe Old Boy, in the drapes of
The Chaparral, has had his mo
ments of joy, humor, and remem
brances of a battle royal along "the
| old Menlo Road."


AS CHAIRMAN of the Civic Fed
eration in I!KI8, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Chancellor of the Univer
sity, can vividly recall "the battle
of the old Menlo Road."
