"I pledge myself neither to give
nor receive unpermitted aid in any
examination."
This statement is the foundation
of the Honor Code—the result of a
30 - year struggle for honorable
scholastic endeavor. In the eyes of
many, it is the most cherished of
Stanford traditions.
NO GOVERNMENT
For many years after the found
ing of the University in 1891, stu
dent government was non-existent,
all student affairs being handled by
committees appointed from the fac
ulty.
In 1904 students and faculty
members who resented the Univer
sity's practice of proctoring exami
nations and felt this system an af
front to student integrity proposed
an honor system. It failed to be ac
cepted for one reason — there was
honor, but no system. Both factions
agreed that only through student
government could the concept of
an honor code be made workable,
and this was still opposed by the
administration.
CAUTIOUS OFFER
Then, in 1912, the faculty cau
tiously offered a limited form of
student government. The student
body was far from satisfied with
the plan, but" fearing a withdrawal
of the offer, accepted it on the
grounds that a little gain would be
better than none.
The new student government re
mained under the watchful scru
tiny of faculty committees, and in
1915 President Branner appointed
certain professors to act as watch
dogs on the student committees.
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
In the same year Chancellor Da
vid Starr Jordan declared, "So far
as I have been able to watch the
working of student control, it has
been reasonably satisfactory. The
chief weakness arises from lack of
interest."
Dr. Jordan's statement stimulated
an increase in the demands for an
honor system. Such a system had
been adopted by the Law School
and had proved a distinct success.
Following this lead other school
departments borrowed, in various
guises, the Law School's code.
However, a setback came when stu
dents in the History Department
failed to show sufficient enthusiasm
for the honor code.
