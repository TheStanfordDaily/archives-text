The three squads entering the
i final round of the university mural
j touch football championships were
set today after the Big Red Machine
of Village 117 and the SAE's moved
into the title bracket with the Be
l tas.
The SAE's edged past Delta Upsi
lon, 6 to 0, while the Machine gained
i the finals through disqualification
of the Sigma Nil's.
The Big Reds twice tied the Sigma
Nu seven in their semi-final playoff
and yesterday's third and deciding
battle was awarded to the Machine
when it was disclosed that one of the
j Sig Nu players, Jim Ewert, played
jayvee ball this year. In addition,
Ewert did not participate in two
regular mural games before playing
in the semi-final contest as mural
j rules prescribe.
The three finalists will play a
round-robin schedule to determine
the campus champion. Today's game
pits the Betas against the Big Red
S Machine.
