# San Jose State Cage Crew Invades Pavilion Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's 1947-48 cagers make their first venture into inter- '
collegiate competition tonight when they meet the San Jose State
five in the Pavilion at 8 p.m.
Victors over two non-college teams last week, the Indians
may run into trouble against an all-veteran Spartan club. Stan-

ford and San Jose State split a two
game series last season.
Tonight's game will be the first
of the year for Coach Walt McPher
son's Spartans. Although two ol his
men are with the football squad in
Hawaii, McPherson will be able to
put a team with two lettermen and
two other members of last year's
squad on the floor.
TWO LETTERMEN START
The lettermen are Stu Inman,
center, and Bob Wuesthoff, guard.
The other three starters are Ron
Staley and Swift Wlinker, forwards,
and Ralph Romero, guard. Wunker
is a transfer from the University of
Indiana.
Stanford coach Everett Dean plans
to stick to the same lineup which
opened against the alumni and the
Olympic Club.
Morley Thompson, southpaw sharp
shooter, and Bill Rose, rangy Menlo
JC transfer, will start at forwards.
Lanky Steve Stephenson, who led
Indian scorers in the Winged "O"
contest, will hold down the pivot
spot, and at guards it will be Dave
Davidson and Babe Higgins.
SECOND TEAM INTACT
Dean said he also plans to use his
second team—Bill Drehobl and Milt
Iverson, forwards; Bob Penn, center;
Gus Chavalas and Bob Lewis, guards,
as a unit.
The Spartans are apparently weak
in reserve strength with only one
letter man on their second unit.
The game will be preceded by a
preliminary between the Frosh and
Salinas JC. There will be no admis
sion charge.
