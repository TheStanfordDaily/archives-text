### 
NEW YORK. Dec. 2 (UP).â€”"Mil
lionaire Johnny" Longden, the na
tion's leading jockey, was still big
news at Bay Meadows today as he
continued his all-out battle with
Steve Brooks for 1947 riding honors.
While Florida's Gulf Stream Park
locked its gates because of a dis
pute over race purses, Longden
again drew national attention by
driving home three winners at the
California track. He finished the
day with a total of 297 winners for
the year. Brooks, who could ac
count for only one winner at fair
grounds, now rests 13 winners off
the pace with 284 seasonal wins.
