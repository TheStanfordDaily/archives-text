### 
Last week the student delegates to the West
ern College Congress approved 37 resolutions
concerning present day world problems/ The
results of the congress and the talks and dis
cussions featured during the three day meeting
were widely publicized in Bay Area news
papers.
Behind the scenes of the congress, which
was sponsored by Stanford's Institute of In
ternational Relations, a group of student volun
teers contributed time and effort toward making
the entire program a success.
The condensation and publication of the
numerous panel discussions were handled by
these Stanford students after each day's pro
gram was completed. All arrangements for the
congress, including the housing of the visiting

delegates, the planning of the agenda, and con
tacting the speakers were carried out by com
mittees under the chairmanship of Cliff Forster.
The final resolutions will be voted upon by
the students of the 33 colleges represented at
the congress, and the results will be delivered
by two student delegates to Congress in Wash
ington, D.C. and to the United Nations in New
York. The success of this trip may never be
known.
But the success of the congress can be meas
ured right now by the amount of interest it has
aroused both on the campuses that sent dele
gates and in the people that watched its prog
ress.
This success is due to the energy contributed
by the Stanford students who backed the con
gress.—M.S.
