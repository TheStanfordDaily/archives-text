Tom Cat?"

"What rule?"

you take it down to the women in .123?"

"Can't do that."

"Suppose I was wrong— Not an expert on cats,
you know. The she might be a he."
"That damned Rule again."

"At ease. I mean get it something to eat. Maybe it'll
stay down there."
"No, thanks—that's almost half a mile from here."
"Oh." Pause. "SAY! I've got it. Why don't you
leave it in building 121 with the married couples?"
"Hell, man, The Rule doesn't apply in 121."
"Well, okay, I'll do that. Thanks a lot. Wish I
knew more about cats and could be sure."
"You do? So do I."
"Thanks a lot. Good night."
"No trouble. Good night."
