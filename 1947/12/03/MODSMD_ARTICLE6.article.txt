# SC Rally Fines Set
## 
### 
A new plan for the paying of Pa
jamarino damages was passed last
night by an eight to four vote by
representatives from various living
! groups and committees on campus.
The final recommendation to be
j submitted to Excom is based on a
percentage of the total costs, esti
-1 mated at $1,000, which includes re-
I pairs for Roble, the Pavilion, and
| the Stanford elementary school.
The assessment recommended is
as follows: Village, 10 per cent;
i Row, 15 per cent plus damages to
j the houses; Toyon, 5 per cent; En
j cina, 35 per cent; Roble-Branner
freshmen, 5 per cent; ASSU, 30 per
cent.
Roble will arrange for the per
| sonal property damage incurred
there.
The amount to be paid by each
fraternity house will be settled by
I the Interfraternity Council. The
! fines will be punitive inasmuch as
I the houses most active in the riot
will be expected to pay the greater
| part of the assessment charged to
j the Row.
Participants in the meeting were
; Dick Weaver and Don Craven, Vil
lage Council; Barbara Working,
I Branner sponsor; Alice Wanke, Ro
ble sponsor; Ted Norton, Encina
