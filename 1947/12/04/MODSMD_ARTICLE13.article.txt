said.

phy."

act as "salesmen" who can promote
Stanford sports to high school and

president, vice-president, secretary
treasurer, and seven representa
tives, one from each of the major
sports at Stanford.
"Because tonight's meeting is offi
cially the first under the Block 'S'
constitution filed with the ASSU

last year, all varsity lettermen who
attend will be recognized as charter
members of the society," August
said.
CARDS DISTRIBUTED
Special charter membership cards
are to be distributed tonight by
Grover Miller of the organization
committee. The bright red cards,
designed by Miller, have a white

Block "S" outlined in black in the
center of the card. "Charter mem
ber" is printed diagonally across the
card.
"The Block 'S' hopes to become
permanent custodian of the Stan

fusion in handling the Axe after
last year's Rig Game showed that
some organization should be en
trusted with protection of the tro
phy."
PROMOTE FARM SPORTS
Another aim of the society, ac
cording to chairman August, is to
act as "salesmen" who can promote
Stanford sports to high school and
junior college athletes.
"At the present time," August
continued, "there is no welcoming
committee on campus to show those
athletes interested in Stanford
around the school."

to attend tonight's free meeting
even if they have not received an
invitation.
