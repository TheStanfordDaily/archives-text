"You just can't beat those attrac-"*
tive 1948 Cap and Gown Calendars j
for useful, inexpensive Christmas |
gifts," suggests Nancy Bannick, j
sales manager. The calendars will j
continue on sale today and tomor- j
row.
Encased in white envelopes and J
ready for mailing, they sell for one 1
dollar. Contents include 52 weekly i
pages, a complete picture accom- |
panying each leaflet, and a multi- j
colored cover.
Proceeds from the sale are to be
applied toward two scholarships,
one to be awarded to a foreign
woman and one to a Stanford stu
dent. The latter will be awarded to
a coed already attending Stanford
in order to enable her to complete
her education, according to Miss j
Bannick.
The calendars will be sold at the
following locations: Cellar, History
corner, Encina Store, Village Store,
Bookstore, and ASSU office. In case
of rain, the sales stands will be
moved inside from in front of the
Cellar to the Post Office porch.
