### JACK LITTLE 
Three one-act plays, written by
Stanford students and produced by
the Stanford Players, opened last
night in the Little Theater to a
small but appreciative audience.
Presentations will continue today,
tomorrow, and Saturday at 8:15 p.m. j
"What Rhymes with Harriet?"
by Herb Blau was often humorous,
and at times uproariously funny.
Blau developed his amusing plot
very well, handling some clever
situation - reversals superbly. In
spots, however, his writing was not
up to par and the dialogue moved
slowly.
Edwin Lcfcourt as Uncle Charlie
and Elizabeth Love as Harriet car
ried their roles with intelligence
and ability. Joan O'Neill was very j
convincing as the gay and carefree I
Dot, while Larry Frankley showed
to good advantage as the husband
of two weeks' standing who is
forced lo defend his right to a past. |
"A Prayer in Galilee," also writ- j
ten by Blau, was superb through- j
out. The plot, and Blau's handling {
of it, was not ingenious, but it was j
very impressive, winning the audi- |
I cnce's greatest ovation of the cve
ning. Orchids to Jules Irving and
Ruth Fisher for their splendid per
formances as the condemned under
ground leader and his wife.
Douglass Russell turned in a fine |
performance as the Rabbi, and
Frank King, William Roseoe, and
Hal Tocid deserve praise. Ralph
McCormic's set was effective, and
director Allen Fletcher deserves
credit for an excellent production.
"Oh Foolish Li-.vc," by Roy Poole,
lakes the prize for the most original
and amusing play. However, Poole's i
excellent wiiting was partially sub- j
merged beneath some very poor
acting. On the other hand, David
Hawes was outstanding, giving a
performance that ranked with the
best of the evening, and Nancy De- I
Groot was superb in her role.
