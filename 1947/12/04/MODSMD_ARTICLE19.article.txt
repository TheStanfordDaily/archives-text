By JACK LITTLE
Despite the setback in 1915,
when students in the History
Department failed to support
the movement for adoption of
an Honor Code, the Stanford
student body continued to push
the plan.
In 1921 many war veterans re
turned to school and began to show
no little resentment of the apparent
lack of faith displayed by the proc
tors in examinations. They con
demned the amount of cheating that
was going on at the time, and felt
that an Honor Code was the only
answer to the problem.
COMPARISON PRINTED
In April of '21 the Stanford Il
lustrated Review printed a com
parison of Harvard's proctoring sys
tem and the Honor Code in use at
Princeton, declaring that "The proc
tor system keeps the students hon

| est while the honor system makes
i them honest."
The Review, stressing the success
| which various Stanford depart
ments had had with a code, issued
, a vigorous call for the adoption of
I the system throughout the Univer
sity.
Finally, on May 24, 1921, the Daily
| Palo Alto, forerunner of The Daily,
j announced:
ACTED ON PETITION
"The Stanford faculty, acting
upon a petition from the students,
j has approved the plan for an honor
I system in examinations throughout
the University. The honor system
I will be put into effect in the final
examinations of the present quarter
' in July."
In essence, the act meant that the
I instructors would leave examina
tion rooms after issuing the exam
j papers, and that cheating would be
j reported by the students them-
I selves. Thus, the responsibility for
honorable conduct rested wholly
upon the students.
Charges would be heard and tried
I by student committees elected by

I the student body. Judgments could
be appealed to the President of the
University, who would automatical
ly review any sentence calling for
| expulsion of the violator from the
school.
UNDER I IRE
In 1924 the Honor Code came un
der fire when the Daily Palo Alto
i reported that instructors were
| turning in more violations than
I were the students, going on to tell
how the system had been aban
doned at the University of Illinois.
Fortunately, however, the spirit of
the Honor Code began to pervade
j the campus and the storm was
| weathered.

j at Stanford, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
present Chancellor of the Univer

COMPARISON PRINTED
In April of '21 the Stanford Il
lustrated Review printed a com
parison of Harvard's proctoring sys
tem and the Honor Code in use at
Princeton, declaring that "The proc
tor system keeps the students hon

| est while the honor system makes
i them honest."
The Review, stressing the success
| which various Stanford depart
ments had had with a code, issued
, a vigorous call for the adoption of
I the system throughout the Univer
sity.
Finally, on May 24, 1921, the Daily
| Palo Alto, forerunner of The Daily,
j announced:
ACTED ON PETITION
"The Stanford faculty, acting
upon a petition from the students,
j has approved the plan for an honor
I system in examinations throughout
the University. The honor system
I will be put into effect in the final
examinations of the present quarter
' in July."
In essence, the act meant that the
I instructors would leave examina
tion rooms after issuing the exam
j papers, and that cheating would be
j reported by the students them-
I selves. Thus, the responsibility for
honorable conduct rested wholly
upon the students.
Charges would be heard and tried
I by student committees elected by

I the student body. Judgments could
be appealed to the President of the
University, who would automatical
ly review any sentence calling for
| expulsion of the violator from the
school.
UNDER I IRE
In 1924 the Honor Code came un
der fire when the Daily Palo Alto
i reported that instructors were
| turning in more violations than
I were the students, going on to tell
how the system had been aban
doned at the University of Illinois.
Fortunately, however, the spirit of
the Honor Code began to pervade
j the campus and the storm was
| weathered.
On the success of (he Honor Code
j at Stanford, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
present Chancellor of the Univer
sity, stated:
"The Honor System worked be
| cause it was a system with a sys
tem. The Code would have failed
| if the initiative had not been placed
on the student. Within the resulting
! development of mental character
! !it>s the system's strength."

Despite the setback in 1915,
when students in the History
Department failed to support
the movement for adoption of
an Honor Code, the Stanford
student body continued to push
the plan.
In 1921 many war veterans re
turned to school and began to show
no little resentment of the apparent
lack of faith displayed by the proc
tors in examinations. They con
demned the amount of cheating that
was going on at the time, and felt
that an Honor Code was the only
answer to the problem.
