# Seniors and Lady Journalists To Hold Dances on Reg Day
## 
### 
Tickets go on sale Monday for
the Senior Reg Party, according to
Willie Davies, dance chairman.
They will sell for $1.65 in the AS
SU office.
"Dancing is only incidental," ex
plained Davies. "We're offering
movies, bridge, ping pong, and a
good old-fashioned group sing to fill
out those intermission moments."
Attendance will be limited to 400
bids so that everyone will have "lots
of room to move around." The class
has contracted for the Village gym
because of its size and facilities for
card playing, movie projection, etc.
"Another reason we're having the
party at the Village," Bob Coate,
president, commented, "is- that we
want to get the Village students in
on campus activities. The theme of
all senior activities this year is a
full senior class participation."
"Door prizes, too," Davies con
tinued. "This is one party we want
everyone to come to, not just pur
chase the bids." Refreshments will
consist of coffee and doughnuts, sold
at pre-inflation prices.

Theta Sigma Phi, women's hon
orary journalism fraternity, will
sponsor the reg dance scheduled for
Monday, Jan. 5, in the Women's
Gym, according to Cathy Morris,
chairman of the dance.
The dance will be held from 8 to
12 p.m. Maurice Anger's band,
which has played at the Fairmont,
will provide the music.
Four hundred tickets will be sold
next week at the ASSU office for
$1.50. On reg day they v/ill be sold
in front of the Ad Building.
Miss Morris emphasized that this
will be the only reg dance on cam
pus, as the Pavilion is not being
used.
Dr. and Mrs. Chilton R. Bush will
serve as patron and patroness.
