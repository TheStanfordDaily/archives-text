# Undergraduates' Scholastic Level At 2.58 Average
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
Students' scholarship attainment was given "new life" yes
terday as indicated in a scholastic bulletin concerning "the ratio
of grade points to registered units for the various Stanford under
graduate student groups for 1946-47.
In the first real post war comprehensive study made by tho
University Scholarship Committee, the general college grade point average
was established at 2.58.
Highest group attainment was achieved by Los Arcos rating club
which posted a 2.93 average in contrast to the lowest score of 2.08 regis
tered by the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
UNDERGRAD WOMEN HAVE HIGH AVERAGE
Undergrdauatc women again top the men students, compiling a 2.66
grade point average in comparison to a 2.55 standard attained by the men.
"But I wouldn't let that alarm anyone," Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary, said, "because the men students' average is the highest
it has ever been in university history."
The ratio of grade point averages was explained by the Scholarship
Committee in the following manner:
The difference between the University average of 2.58 and a perfect
score of 4.00 is divided into ten equal parts, and each group average is
numbered according to the interval in which it falls.
PLUS AND MINUS ABOVE UNIVERSITY AVERAGE
Thus a group whose standing is " —2" has an average between 2.72 and
2.86 inclusive. These same intervals are used to indicate ratios below the
University average.
"The women's average of 2.66 means they are '4 1' above the total
college average," Mrs. Byler explained.
"In the case of the men's average of 2.55, it simply means they arc '—V
below the general campus average," she pointed out.

Students' scholarship attainment was given "new life" yes
terday as indicated in a scholastic bulletin concerning "the ratio
of grade points to registered units for the various Stanford under
graduate student groups for 1946-47.
In the first real post war comprehensive study made by tho
University Scholarship Committee, the general college grade point average
was established at 2.58.
Highest group attainment was achieved by Los Arcos rating club
which posted a 2.93 average in contrast to the lowest score of 2.08 regis
tered by the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
UNDERGRAD WOMEN HAVE HIGH AVERAGE
Undergrdauatc women again top the men students, compiling a 2.66
grade point average in comparison to a 2.55 standard attained by the men.
"But I wouldn't let that alarm anyone," Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary, said, "because the men students' average is the highest
it has ever been in university history."
The ratio of grade point averages was explained by the Scholarship
Committee in the following manner:
The difference between the University average of 2.58 and a perfect
score of 4.00 is divided into ten equal parts, and each group average is
numbered according to the interval in which it falls.
PLUS AND MINUS ABOVE UNIVERSITY AVERAGE
Thus a group whose standing is " —2" has an average between 2.72 and
2.86 inclusive. These same intervals are used to indicate ratios below the
University average.
"The women's average of 2.66 means they are '4 1' above the total
college average," Mrs. Byler explained.
"In the case of the men's average of 2.55, it simply means they arc '—V
below the general campus average," she pointed out.

Students' scholarship attainment was given "new life" yes
terday as indicated in a scholastic bulletin concerning "the ratio
of grade points to registered units for the various Stanford under
graduate student groups for 1946-47.
In the first real post war comprehensive study made by tho
University Scholarship Committee, the general college grade point average
was established at 2.58.
Highest group attainment was achieved by Los Arcos rating club
which posted a 2.93 average in contrast to the lowest score of 2.08 regis
tered by the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
UNDERGRAD WOMEN HAVE HIGH AVERAGE
Undergrdauatc women again top the men students, compiling a 2.66
grade point average in comparison to a 2.55 standard attained by the men.
"But I wouldn't let that alarm anyone," Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary, said, "because the men students' average is the highest
it has ever been in university history."
The ratio of grade point averages was explained by the Scholarship
Committee in the following manner:
The difference between the University average of 2.58 and a perfect
score of 4.00 is divided into ten equal parts, and each group average is
numbered according to the interval in which it falls.
PLUS AND MINUS ABOVE UNIVERSITY AVERAGE
Thus a group whose standing is " —2" has an average between 2.72 and
2.86 inclusive. These same intervals are used to indicate ratios below the
University average.
"The women's average of 2.66 means they are '4 1' above the total
college average," Mrs. Byler explained.
"In the case of the men's average of 2.55, it simply means they arc '—V
below the general campus average," she pointed out.
