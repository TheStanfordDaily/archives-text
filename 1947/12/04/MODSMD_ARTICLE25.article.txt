# Hardworking Teachers, Ambitions Children Form a Successful Village Sunday School
## 
### DEBBY WELLES 
Sunday School may be far away in the memory of many an undergrad, but for some 22
youngsters at Stanford Village, "it's the swelles! day of the week."
At 10:45 -Sunday morning they will parade into the Village Nursery School rooms for the third
time and cling to their parents only long enough to get their weekly offering, anywhere from
a penny to a guarter, before they venture into the more pious of their school activities.

Their parents will have time to
; I tend church for themselves Sun
day morning while the children
spend an hour and a half under the
supervision of a group of young
Village and campus teachers, most of
whom are wives and mothers them
selves.
FIRST IN VILLAGE
The school, the first in Stanford
Village, was a joint inspiration of
the Memorial Church Board, Chap
lain Gale Winton Engle, and Mrs.
James Cross, who is a Village mo
ther with a background of relig
ious teaching experience. Mrs. Cross
was appointed by Chaplain Engle
and the Board to lead the group.
All the work is done on a volunteer
basis . . . and those who have vol
unteered have found more than
enough to do!
Mrs. Cross has provided a great
deal of the inspiration as well as
her share of the hard work. At the
weekly Tuesday night discussion
groups, she, Chaplain Engle, and
Mrs. Herbert B. Nanney have dis
cussed, suggested, directed, worked,
and prayed for the success that they
have thus far achieved.
NO STRAIN TO CHILDREN
The kids take everything a little
more easily in their stride. Unlike
their directors, Sunday school is no
strain on them . . . they arrived
the first day, most of them in the
nursery school ages, without any of
the qualms or shyness that their
teachers had expected.
Only a few of them had attended
Sunday school before . . . but most
of them knew each other and the
school rooms they met in pretty
well. Several of them spent the Sat
urday before the first meeting prac*
ticing hymns and songs, much to the
surprise and delight of their
teachers.
DRAWINGS GET ATTENTION
Of course there were those who
didn't really feel like singing and
participating in the group activi
ties ... it took Sanford Wilbourn,
with the only firm masculine hand
present, to get them interested in
the school and, eventually, what
the others were doing, by his in
genious talent for drawing engines
and boats.
Perhaps the most enthusiasm of
all went into the depositing of their
offerings in the tin can marked
Church World Service. As one little
girl put it to her parents, "I put a
nickel in a tin can to give another
girl a warm coat."
SCHOOL HAS ?, DIVISIONS
Throughout most of the time they
are there, the children are divided
into three groups . . . nursery, be
ginners, and primary. Mrs. Cross
and her assistants have planned
different and appropriate programs
for each group. While the older
children are expected to set the
example for the others by sitting
rather quietly in one place while
they draw pictures, sing, and listen
to stories, the younger ones have

more freedom of action and their
teachers try to get their religious !
messages across by telling stories !
and correcting the children as they
play.
Mrs. Cross has nothing but praise
for the jobs the teachers are doing,
and everybody connected with the
venture is amazed and pleased with

their success.
"What we really need," Mrs. Cross
said, "is a bigger staff . . . more
people who are interested in relig
ious teaching. I am sure anyone
who volunteers will find the work
rewarding."
The kids actively and passively
agree.

girl put it to her parents, "I put a

SCHOOL HAS ?, DIVISIONS
Throughout most of the time they
are there, the children are divided
into three groups . . . nursery, be
ginners, and primary. Mrs. Cross
and her assistants have planned
different and appropriate programs
for each group. While the older
children are expected to set the
example for the others by sitting
rather quietly in one place while
they draw pictures, sing, and listen
to stories, the younger ones have

more freedom of action and their
teachers try to get their religious !
messages across by telling stories !
and correcting the children as they
play.
Mrs. Cross has nothing but praise
for the jobs the teachers are doing,
and everybody connected with the
venture is amazed and pleased with

their success.
"What we really need," Mrs. Cross
said, "is a bigger staff . . . more
people who are interested in relig
ious teaching. I am sure anyone
who volunteers will find the work
rewarding."
The kids actively and passively
agree.
Sunday School may be far away in the memory of many an undergrad, but for some 22
youngsters at Stanford Village, "it's the swelles! day of the week."
At 10:45 -Sunday morning they will parade into the Village Nursery School rooms for the third
time and cling to their parents only long enough to get their weekly offering, anywhere from
a penny to a guarter, before they venture into the more pious of their school activities.

Their parents will have time to
; I tend church for themselves Sun
day morning while the children
spend an hour and a half under the
supervision of a group of young
Village and campus teachers, most of
whom are wives and mothers them
selves.
FIRST IN VILLAGE
The school, the first in Stanford
Village, was a joint inspiration of
the Memorial Church Board, Chap
lain Gale Winton Engle, and Mrs.
James Cross, who is a Village mo
ther with a background of relig
ious teaching experience. Mrs. Cross
was appointed by Chaplain Engle
and the Board to lead the group.
All the work is done on a volunteer
basis . . . and those who have vol
unteered have found more than
enough to do!
Mrs. Cross has provided a great
deal of the inspiration as well as
her share of the hard work. At the
weekly Tuesday night discussion
groups, she, Chaplain Engle, and
Mrs. Herbert B. Nanney have dis
cussed, suggested, directed, worked,
and prayed for the success that they
have thus far achieved.
NO STRAIN TO CHILDREN
The kids take everything a little
more easily in their stride. Unlike
their directors, Sunday school is no
strain on them . . . they arrived
the first day, most of them in the
nursery school ages, without any of
the qualms or shyness that their
teachers had expected.
Only a few of them had attended
Sunday school before . . . but most
of them knew each other and the
school rooms they met in pretty
well. Several of them spent the Sat
urday before the first meeting prac*
ticing hymns and songs, much to the
surprise and delight of their
teachers.
DRAWINGS GET ATTENTION
Of course there were those who
didn't really feel like singing and
participating in the group activi
ties ... it took Sanford Wilbourn,
with the only firm masculine hand
present, to get them interested in
the school and, eventually, what
the others were doing, by his in
genious talent for drawing engines
and boats.
Perhaps the most enthusiasm of
all went into the depositing of their
offerings in the tin can marked
Church World Service. As one little
girl put it to her parents, "I put a
nickel in a tin can to give another
girl a warm coat."
