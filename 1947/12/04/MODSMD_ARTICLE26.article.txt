# 'Business as Usual' in Activity Files
## 
### 
Activity Files was reinstitutec! at
Stanford last year to get more stu
dents in extracurricular activities
and to help organizations in getting
adequate personnel. The Files pub
lishes the freshman handbook, the
"Frosh Bible."
This quarter Activity Files has
established a complete file of cam
pus organizations including needs
for personnel, qualification for
membership, the meeting time, and
names of the officers. Co-chairmen
of the Files are Gordon Johnson and
Jean Strong.
TWO THOUSAND NAMES
A file of over 2,000 students and
their interests and abilities is set up
in the office.
The Files is in room one of the
ASSU Building this quarter. Office
hours are from 1 to 3 on Monday
and Wednesday, and the phone
number is PA 6821.
Students have come to the office
with questions like: "Does Stanford
have a chess club?" or "Which in

ternational group is which?" Other
students have received general in
formation to start them toward
campus leadership. Cam Sanders,
office chairman, said.
Many campus organizations used
the files this quarter to get workers
and to make appointments. SIRO
and the international groups have
been the best customers.
MAY ADOPT POINT SYSTEM
Miss Sanders said the Activity
Files is looking into the possibility
of adopting an activity point system
like that which has been used with
success at UCLA and the University
of Washington.
Next quarter the Activity Files
will concentrate in getting the new
students into extracurricular activ
ities by having speakers talk to the
newcomers.
The office is staffed by Adelaide
Barth, Joanne Briggs, Jane Bush,
Aggie Heying, Nancy Lagomarsino,
and Nancy Naylor. Dana Turking
ton is recruiting chairman.
