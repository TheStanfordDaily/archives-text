# Indians Outlast Spartans 54 to 50; Frosh Top Salinas in Preliminary
## 
### BILL ALLEN JOHN BREIER 
In a game most charitably
described as typically early
season, Stanford's basketball
team defeated San Jose State,
54 to 50, in the Pavilion last
night.
The game was neither so
close nor so exciting as the
score indicates. During the first
ten minutes of the first half, the
Indian first team built up a sev
en-point lead which was never
seriously threatened thereafter.
In the last five minutes of the
game starter Bob Wuesthoff and
two substitutes, Bob Hagcn and Bob
Enzenberger, got hot for the Spar
tans to bring them almost within
striking distance, but the margin
was too great for them to overcome.
C'AKDS SHINE IN SPURTS
Stanford showed flashes of good
play, but generally the contest was
sloppy. The taller Indians controlled
the defensive backboard almost
completely, and the Spartans were
seldom getting more than one shot
at the basket when they got the ball.
And these first shots were not go
ing in.
The game was five minutes old
and the Indians had 12 points be
fore San Jose broke the scoring ice.
It was not until midway in the sec
ond half that the Spartans began
hitting some of their long one
handers.
THOMPSON HITS 13
Motley Thompson led Stanford
scorers with 13 points, followed by
Steve Stephenson with 11 and Cap
tain Babe Higgins with eight. For
the Staters, John Kane with 14. high
for both teams, led, Hagen and
WuesthofT had 11, and Stu Inman
scored 10.
Thompson strained an ankle late
in the game, but Coach Everett
Dean said after the game that the
injury was not serious.
The Stanford second team played
a large part of the first half and
managed to maintain the lead ac
cumulated by the first - stringers.
The score was 26 to 19 at the half.
Dean substituted freely in the
second half, but never had all of
his first-stringers on the bench.

Paced by the sharpshooting
of Paul Watson and bolstered
by the fine defensive play of
Marvin Gelber, the Stanford
freshmen downed a stubborn
Salinas JC quintet, 48 to 41,
here last night.
The contest, the first win for the
yearlings over outside competition,
saw the Indian Papeese grab an
early lead that was never overcome
and go on to win easily.
Paul Watson garnered 20 points
for high point honors, with forward
Don Patch hitting for 11 counters
for the victors. Jack Blinkenberg
scored six field goals and a free
throw to top the jayceers.
Other scorers for Stanford were:
Bill Herron, 4; Dick Clegg, 4; Gel
ber, 4; Ken Gardner, 3; and Lloyd
Kelly, 2.
Jack Dana's cagers will meet the
Galileo High School basketeers Sat
urday afternoon in the Pavilion for
their next contest, the last of the
quarter. Abraham Lincoln High of
San Francisco will be their oppo
nents on Jan. 9.

BABE HIGGINS, voted All-
Southcrn Division guard lust sea
son, is a l)ij{ cog in Stanford's 1!)47
basketball varsity.
In a game most charitably
described as typically early
season, Stanford's basketball
team defeated San Jose State,
54 to 50, in the Pavilion last
night.
The game was neither so
close nor so exciting as the
score indicates. During the first
ten minutes of the first half, the
Indian first team built up a sev
en-point lead which was never
seriously threatened thereafter.
In the last five minutes of the
game starter Bob Wuesthoff and
two substitutes, Bob Hagcn and Bob
Enzenberger, got hot for the Spar
tans to bring them almost within
striking distance, but the margin
was too great for them to overcome.
C'AKDS SHINE IN SPURTS
Stanford showed flashes of good
play, but generally the contest was
sloppy. The taller Indians controlled
the defensive backboard almost
completely, and the Spartans were
seldom getting more than one shot
at the basket when they got the ball.
And these first shots were not go
ing in.
The game was five minutes old
and the Indians had 12 points be
fore San Jose broke the scoring ice.
It was not until midway in the sec
ond half that the Spartans began
hitting some of their long one
handers.
THOMPSON HITS 13
Motley Thompson led Stanford
scorers with 13 points, followed by
Steve Stephenson with 11 and Cap
tain Babe Higgins with eight. For
the Staters, John Kane with 14. high
for both teams, led, Hagen and
WuesthofT had 11, and Stu Inman
scored 10.
Thompson strained an ankle late
in the game, but Coach Everett
Dean said after the game that the
injury was not serious.
The Stanford second team played
a large part of the first half and
managed to maintain the lead ac
cumulated by the first - stringers.
The score was 26 to 19 at the half.
Dean substituted freely in the
second half, but never had all of
his first-stringers on the bench.

Paced by the sharpshooting
of Paul Watson and bolstered
by the fine defensive play of
Marvin Gelber, the Stanford
freshmen downed a stubborn
Salinas JC quintet, 48 to 41,
here last night.
The contest, the first win for the
yearlings over outside competition,
saw the Indian Papeese grab an
early lead that was never overcome
and go on to win easily.
Paul Watson garnered 20 points
for high point honors, with forward
Don Patch hitting for 11 counters
for the victors. Jack Blinkenberg
scored six field goals and a free
throw to top the jayceers.
