# Betas Blast Village 310 In 33-0 Win
## 
### 
Sparked by their ace passer, Ber
; nard Woody, the Betas rolled to an
; impressive 33 to 0 victory over a
crippled Biy Red Machine outfit
yesterday afternoon in the first game
!of the intramural football finals.
The Betas hit pay dirt within the
j first few minutes of play when, fol
lowing a poor kick by the Machine
j men, they marched from midfield to
score. Toward the end of the first
half Harry Reichling intercepted one
of Charlie Maio's passes and on the
I next play Woody heaved a long
aerial to Bob Keenan who made a
I miraculous catch in the end zone
| to make it 13-0.
In the second period the Betas
( took the kickoff and put together a
j sustained drive which was climaxed
when Keenan caught Woody's heave
I for the tally. The final Beta touch
down came in the closing seconds
of the game on a pass from Malloy to
JCeenan.
For the losers Bob Teall, Jack
Reed and Charlie Maio played well,
; but the Beta's aggressiveness and
superior weight were too much for
! them to handle.
