The Stanford student is a pillar of intellect in
the classroom.
He, or she, is well graced in the niceties of
the tea cup or brown bottle societies.
What happens to our well-rounded student
when he is removed from the mothering influ
ences of the Farm?
The Student Employment Service has the
answer.
Unfortunately during the war some Stanford
students who worked part or full time in the
surrounding area built up a poor reputation.
Merchants in the area became reticent to hire
one of Stanford's scholars.
This wall of prejudice grew until less than a
year ago the Stanford Employment Service had
an almost impossible job on its hand to place
one of its charges with a local establishment.
It has only been in recent months that prog

ress toward correcting this wartime reputation
has been made. Mrs. Clotilde Edwards, who is
the executive assistant in charge of the Student
Employment Service, now has glowing praise
for many of the students the office has placed.
The office's records for 1946-47 show that
2,316 students, or 25.4 percent of the student
body, registered with the service, and more
than 2,500 students were placed in jobs. (The
discrepancy is explained by the fact that many
students were placed in more than one posi
tion).
The picture has brightened to the extent that
Mrs. Edwards has been able to raise tl;e 75-cents
an-hour minimum wage to a dollar-an-hour.
Every Stanford student that can go out and do
a good job in a part time or full-time vacation
position will insure that there will be jobs for
students in the future.—D.D.
