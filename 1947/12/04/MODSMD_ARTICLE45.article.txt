### AL MUNK 
Never underestimate the power of women —and
I've had black eyes to prove it, too . . .
But talking of the power of women, some of the
charmers that inhabit the third floor of Manzanita are
displaying some remarkable ingenuity and power. They
have a male companion that was sharing their tribu
lations and sleeping quarters up to a couple of weeks
ago, that is until the girls decided to evict the poor
creature.
Such a sweet creature, too; he's grey all over,
with a long tail, about four inches long, and a squeak in
his voice. I guess you'd call him a mouse, although
the girls insist he's a rat! But, anyway, he had over
stayed his visit, and so this trio of headhunters de
cided to kick him out.
Armed with brooms and heavy shoes, the girls first
tried to trick the rat out of his quarters which were
firmly embedded between the niblick and the number
four iron in one of the girl's golfbags. But the little
darling was smart —he just headed for the round-house
'cause he knew they wouldn't corner him there!
But finally he gave up, realizing he was facing
three determined women, and scurried down the
stairs with the trio hot on his tail and trail. After
trapping the rat in a waste-paper basket, they carried
him up the Row, smiling victoriously, till they

reached one of the empty fields, way up away from
civilization.
With a final admonition, the girls dropped the poor
mouse between some broken bottles (pint-size),
threw some tocks at him. and headed home to their
sanctuary thinking that was the last they'd see of
Rufus the Rat.
Don't ask me how I know this, but only the other
night some faintly reminiscent footsteps were again
heard on the upper floors of Manzanita; yes, Rufus
is home again, back where he belongs, among the
golfbags of Manzanita, and he likes it.
All of which just goes to show the great power
of attraction the girls have when it comes to mice—
you can't keep them away by beating them off. Better
adopt Rufus or kill him!

Travelling the highway and drinking my dinner the
other night, I ran across a little sign on the wall of
one of the local bistros:
"Every Tuesday night is novelty night. Everybody
brings his own wife!"
Yeah, I know, marriage is a great institution. As
a matter of fact, marriage is a three-ring circus.
First the engagement ring, then the wedding ring, and
finally suffering.

brings his own wife!"
Yeah, I know, marriage is a great institution. As
a matter of fact, marriage is a three-ring circus.
First the engagement ring, then the wedding ring, and
finally suffering.
Never underestimate the power of women —and
I've had black eyes to prove it, too . . .
But talking of the power of women, some of the
charmers that inhabit the third floor of Manzanita are
displaying some remarkable ingenuity and power. They
have a male companion that was sharing their tribu
lations and sleeping quarters up to a couple of weeks
ago, that is until the girls decided to evict the poor
creature.
Such a sweet creature, too; he's grey all over,
with a long tail, about four inches long, and a squeak in
his voice. I guess you'd call him a mouse, although
the girls insist he's a rat! But, anyway, he had over
stayed his visit, and so this trio of headhunters de
cided to kick him out.
Armed with brooms and heavy shoes, the girls first
tried to trick the rat out of his quarters which were
firmly embedded between the niblick and the number
four iron in one of the girl's golfbags. But the little
darling was smart —he just headed for the round-house
'cause he knew they wouldn't corner him there!
But finally he gave up, realizing he was facing
three determined women, and scurried down the
stairs with the trio hot on his tail and trail. After
trapping the rat in a waste-paper basket, they carried
him up the Row, smiling victoriously, till they

reached one of the empty fields, way up away from
civilization.
With a final admonition, the girls dropped the poor
mouse between some broken bottles (pint-size),
threw some tocks at him. and headed home to their
sanctuary thinking that was the last they'd see of
Rufus the Rat.
Don't ask me how I know this, but only the other
night some faintly reminiscent footsteps were again
heard on the upper floors of Manzanita; yes, Rufus
is home again, back where he belongs, among the
golfbags of Manzanita, and he likes it.
All of which just goes to show the great power
of attraction the girls have when it comes to mice—
you can't keep them away by beating them off. Better
adopt Rufus or kill him!

Travelling the highway and drinking my dinner the
other night, I ran across a little sign on the wall of
one of the local bistros:
"Every Tuesday night is novelty night. Everybody
brings his own wife!"
