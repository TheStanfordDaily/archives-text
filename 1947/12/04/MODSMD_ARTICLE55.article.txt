# Hilltop Boasts Lowest Board, Social Freedom, Tasty Meals
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
The lowest board on campus—this is the boast of 14 graduate
women who live at 610 Cabrillo, better known as Hilltop House.
Hilltop, the only residence for graduate women on campus,
was given to the university by Mrs. Helen Cubberley in 1942.
The house had been her home since it was built in 1908. The

little white-haired lady still lives
there. "I'm not a housemother or
chaperone," she hastily explained.
PLANS MENUS
Rosemary Watson, the current
housemanager, buys the food and
plans the dinner menus. Two girls
cook dinner each night, giving each
girl a turn once a week.
"Some of the girls didn't know
how to cook when they first came,
but they all know how by the time
they leave," Miss Watson laughed.
Each girl fixes her own lunch and
breakfast, and snacks may be eaten
at any time—and the board is just
$75 a quarter!
"No discipline problems ever
arise," Mrs. Cubberley said, ex
plaining that there are no "lock
outs" or other restrictions such as
undergraduates have.
RESIDENTS VARY
"Some years we have mostly med
ical students, and cadavers are fig
uratively served up at every dinner,
but this year the girls are mostly
drama and physical therapy majors,"
Mrs. Cubberley said.
There are no formal house meet
ing or complicated club organiza
tion, but social life is not neglected.
Exchange dinners and parties are
given each quarter. "Last year we
had a dance in the skylight room on
the top floor," Miss Watson said.
On Thanksgiving one of the girls
cooked a 22-pound turkey for the
18 who were there, and "there wasn't
a shred left!"
LARGE TURNOVER
Assignments to Hilltop are made
through the director of housing,
Miss Anastasia Doyle, and as gradu
ate women usually only stay one
year, there is a large turn-over
each year, "although one girl stayed
four years," Mrs. Cubberley said.
"Last night we had an extra-spe
cial meal," the house-manager said.
"Muriel Lowe, our English girl, made
Yorkshire pudding and we had
roast prime ribs of beef."
"Being next door to the Tresid
ders has some advantages, too—we
all dash over on Wednesday evenings
for the 'at homes'," she added.
"Also," she said, "you should see
how the men love Hilltop—they all
think it's so homelike."
