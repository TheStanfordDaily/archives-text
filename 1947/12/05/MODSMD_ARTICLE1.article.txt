## 
### 
A speeded up pre-registration system for Winter Quarter has
been, scheduled for Monday through Thursday, not Tuesday
through Friday as previously reported in The Daily, according
to Dr. Donald Winbigler, registrar.
Upper division and graduate students will pre-reg Monday

and Tuesday, while lower division
students will go through the same
procedure Wednesday and Thurs
day.
The Jan. 5 registration routine will
appear in the Time Schedule, which
is now available in the Administra
tion Building. Registrants will ad
here to the following alphabetical
schedule:
A to D—B to 9 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m.
Eto K—9 to 10 a.m. and Ito 5 p.m.
L to R—lo to 11 a.m. and 1 to 5
p.m.
S to Z—ll a.m. to noon and 1 to 5
p.m.
It will not be necessary for stu
dents to stand in early lines to regis
ter, since books will not be handed
out before the assigned time, Dr.
Winbiglcr explained.
Contrary to former procedure, reg
istration books may be returned
in the morning to room 124, Graduate
School of Business, by veterans, and
to room 202, History Building, by
other students. Books may be re
turned to the Administration Build
ing Lobby in the afternoon.
Because additional sections will be
open Winter Quarter, there will be
little difficulty in obtaining seat
cards, which should be secured dur
ing prc-rcgistration, stated Dr. Win
biglcr.
History of Western Civilization 11
and 12 will not require seat cards;
students are asked to arrange win
ter enrollment with their instructor
or in the Western Civ office.
