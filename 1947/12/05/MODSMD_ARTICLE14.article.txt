# Honor Code Is A Trust For Students To Uphold
## 
### 
The pledge, "No unpermitted aid given ut received," has meant much
1o Stanford students for many years. It has meant the reaffirmation of
a great and valuable trust, it has meant a privilege and an honor which
makes our school distinct, it has meant a spirit that permeates every aspect
of student life and remains with Stanford people forever.
The writing and signing of this pledge on the blue book after the com
pletion of an examination is our way of testifying to our support of the
Stanford Honor Code. In doing this, we accept a two-fold responsibility,
a responsibility for our own personal honesty and a responsibility to see that
others as well as ourselves obey the spirit and the letter of the Honor Code.
This latter aspect of the Honor Code is not designed to make police-

men of us. Stanford people are hon
est and it will be rarely that we will
be forced to exercise this duty. The
objcct is not to keep Men's and Wo
men's Councils busy, but, if need be,
to straighten out a misguided per
son.
If you observe a violation of the
Code, there arc several things you
should do. You may tap a pencil on
your desk, thus warning the sus
pected person that his actions have
been questioned and that he had
better straighten out. You may
speak to the person involved, ex
plaining the Code to him, pointing
out his violation and requesting that
he rectify the damage done. Or if
you feel it is necessary, due to the
seriousness of the breach or the
person's attitude, to report him to
one of the councils, it is your duty to
do so.
We have something great in our
Honor Code. We must never forget [
this and take it for granted.
