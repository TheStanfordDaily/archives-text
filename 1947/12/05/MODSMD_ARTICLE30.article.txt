# Alpine Club Plans Last Autumn Hike
## 
### 
Weather permitting, members of
the Stanford Alpine Club will wind
up the quarter's activities with a
trip to the Pinnacles National Mon
ument this weekend. Because of
pressure of studies, however, no in
structors will be available for nov
ices.
Climbers must use extreme cau
tion as the volcanic breccia of the
Pinnacles is tricky and affords very
few piton cracks.
Any climbers wishing to go down
Friday night or Saturday morning
should contact M. J. Fiksdal. Those
wishing to leave early Sunday
morning should contact Dave Hur
rah, Village 200, or Larry Taylor,
Alpha Sigma Phi.
