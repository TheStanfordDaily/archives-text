# Four-Dollar House Dues Discussed by Conference
## 
### 
Maximum house dues of $4 per
woman per quarter were discussed
by Women's Conference yesterday.
Proposals for dues revisions were
also brought up.
A $1 raise over the present dues,
the new maximum would be op
! tional to the various houses, said
Phyl Sutherland, Conference presi
dent. If a house felt that it could
operate on less, it would not have
to raise the dues, she explained.
The proposed raise will be dis
cussed in the living groups next
week. It will be voted on in Con
ference the first week of next quar
ter.
REVISIONS SUGGESTED
Dues revisions were suggested to
provide a certain amount of unifor
mity between areas and to reduce
area differences, Mary Ellen Har
ding, who has charge of the revi
sions, said. Proposed changes are as
follows:
1. Dues shall be used for club ac
tivities—those which are common to
all areas.
2. House operating expenses shall
bo provided for by assessments ap
proved by the vote of the house.
3. Proposed assessments in excess
of dues shall be approved by the
area Excom. (Conference felt that a
qualification was needed here.)
4. Dues shall be collected quar
terly under the supervision of the
area Excoms, which shall decide the
•apportionment between the area
and the living groups within it.
5. Budgets of the area Excoms
shall bo approved by the Advisory
Board. Those of the living groups
shall be approved by their area
Excoms.
TIME LIMIT SET
(!. Time limit for submitting area
budget to the Advisory Board shall
be set by Conference.
The revisions will be taken back
to the houses and voted on the first
of next quarter.
Discrepancies in the election of
members of the Advisory Board,
who are the area heads, were also
discussed.
There will be no meeting of Con
ference next week. The next meet
ing will be held Jan. 8, 1948.
