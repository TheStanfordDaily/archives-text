# No MP Need at Village; Self-Government Evident
## 
### JOE WILLIAMSON 
Stanford Village is a seedbed for
spontaneous growth of self-govern
nent." Herbert Wunderlich, Village
Counselor, said in an interview last
night. "Consequently," he added,
"we don't need any M.P.'s here;
there is no need to run the Village
under a totalitarian regime."
This spontaneous growth of self
government is manifested in the
Village's two executive bodies —the
Village Council and the Village
Family Council.
The Village Council was ox'gan
izecl last year as a means of pro
viding student government in the
Village and to co-ordinate Village
activities with those of other living
groups and organization.
CONSTITUTION BREWING
At the present time a proposed
revision of the Village Council con
stitution is under consideration. II
approved, this constitution will,
nmong other things, provide for
Council officers who will serve for
the entire school year. This provi
sion, it is hoped, will furnish a sta
bilizing force within the Council
nnd provide a single group to inte
grate Village activities with campus
plans, according to Gordon Yates,
Council president.
The Family Council sprang from
coffee and cake gatherings of Vil
lage wives around the red-check
ered tablecloth. Alter several such
informal gatherings it was decided
that an organized group would be
necessary to iron out the problems
of community life in the apartment
area. Thus the well-known matri
archal body was formed—with a
representative from each backyard
area, where the problems are origi
nally aired over the washlines and
milk bottles. Although they meet
regularly every three weeks and
have accomplished a lot, the Family
Council has not yet seen the ne
cessity for the legalistic approach
lately taken up by the single men's
group.
COMM UNITY IMPItO VEMENTS
Fall quarter saw many commu
nity improvements as a result of the
work of these two groups.
The single men's council origi
nated the idea of a game room in
the Village center, and made all the
arrangements for it. The Thanks
giving holidays were made much
more enjoyable for those students
who stayed in the Village by the
many events the Council's social
committee planned and carried
through.
Those are just a few of the Vil
lage Council's tangible results.
"The intangible ones, however,
are of the most importance," said
Yates. "The spirit of co-operation
with which the Council members
have worked during the quarter has
been exceptional, and the individual
houses are to be complimented on
their choice of presidents who rep
resented them."
DEEDS ARE LISTED
The Family Council, under the
chairmanship of Mrs. William Iver
son, has a long list of accomplish
ments. They worked with the Stan
lord Mothers' Club in running the
Village wardrobe, where baby
clothes, baby buggies, and clothing
were made available to Stanford
wives. A committee from the Fam
ily Council assisted in the work at
the nursery school and kindergar
ten .
Another development the Villag
ers can point to with pride is the
work of the religious council under
the guidance of the Rev. Gale Engle,
Village chaplain. The newly formed
Village Sunday school for children
as a result of their work. The
Student Christian Association also
evolved from this group.

with which the Council members
have worked during the quarter has
been exceptional, and the individual
houses are to be complimented on
their choice of presidents who rep
resented them."
DEEDS ARE LISTED
The Family Council, under the
chairmanship of Mrs. William Iver
son, has a long list of accomplish
ments. They worked with the Stan
lord Mothers' Club in running the
Village wardrobe, where baby
clothes, baby buggies, and clothing
were made available to Stanford
wives. A committee from the Fam
ily Council assisted in the work at
the nursery school and kindergar
ten .
Another development the Villag
ers can point to with pride is the
work of the religious council under
the guidance of the Rev. Gale Engle,
Village chaplain. The newly formed
Village Sunday school for children
as a result of their work. The
Student Christian Association also
evolved from this group.
Stanford Village is a seedbed for
spontaneous growth of self-govern
nent." Herbert Wunderlich, Village
Counselor, said in an interview last
night. "Consequently," he added,
"we don't need any M.P.'s here;
there is no need to run the Village
under a totalitarian regime."
This spontaneous growth of self
government is manifested in the
Village's two executive bodies —the
Village Council and the Village
Family Council.
The Village Council was ox'gan
izecl last year as a means of pro
viding student government in the
Village and to co-ordinate Village
activities with those of other living
groups and organization.
CONSTITUTION BREWING
At the present time a proposed
revision of the Village Council con
stitution is under consideration. II
approved, this constitution will,
nmong other things, provide for
Council officers who will serve for
the entire school year. This provi
sion, it is hoped, will furnish a sta
bilizing force within the Council
nnd provide a single group to inte
grate Village activities with campus
plans, according to Gordon Yates,
Council president.
The Family Council sprang from
coffee and cake gatherings of Vil
lage wives around the red-check
ered tablecloth. Alter several such
informal gatherings it was decided
that an organized group would be
necessary to iron out the problems
of community life in the apartment
area. Thus the well-known matri
archal body was formed—with a
representative from each backyard
area, where the problems are origi
nally aired over the washlines and
milk bottles. Although they meet
regularly every three weeks and
have accomplished a lot, the Family
Council has not yet seen the ne
cessity for the legalistic approach
lately taken up by the single men's
group.
COMM UNITY IMPItO VEMENTS
Fall quarter saw many commu
nity improvements as a result of the
work of these two groups.
The single men's council origi
nated the idea of a game room in
the Village center, and made all the
arrangements for it. The Thanks
giving holidays were made much
more enjoyable for those students
who stayed in the Village by the
many events the Council's social
committee planned and carried
through.
Those are just a few of the Vil
lage Council's tangible results.
"The intangible ones, however,
are of the most importance," said
Yates. "The spirit of co-operation
with which the Council members
have worked during the quarter has
been exceptional, and the individual
houses are to be complimented on
their choice of presidents who rep
resented them."
