# WCC Wins News Honors
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
The high cost of living took a back
scat to Stanford's Western College
Congress which yesterday won "top
news honors" as the most important
news story of the quarter at Stan
ford.
Despite the continued upward
splurge of food prices, the fact that
Stanford was fortunate to be the
host to the western states' delegates
aided materially in the linal selec
tion.
TOP FIVE LISTED
Other lop ranking stories included:
1. The European reports of Bill
Fairer and Lawrence Grannis with
reference to their summer "tour of
Europe."
2. Marchie Schwartz' unfortunate
campaign which found the Stanford
lootball team losing nine straight
games.
3. The subsequent loss of the Stan
ford Axe.
4. Douglas Whitaker's Tuesday
Evening Series disclosure that "bac
teria and other low forms of life
would have a better chance to sur
vive than man."
5. And"the new look."
Observers on campus, despite
handing VVCC the zenith laurel, were
wont to agree that tlle Schwartz epi
sode was the most astounding cli
max to "the worst football season in
Stanford history."
Even Schwartz was forced to de
clare: "It was the darndest thing."
AXE LOSS
The loss of the Axe, sequestered
on campus since 11)42, was a blow
attired in an ironic cloak of "accum
ulated spirit" which was partially
responsible for a presentation of a
plaque to the Cardinal gridiron coach
after the season.
Gagsters had their fun poking con
troversial adjectives at "the new
look" which was thrust before the
male populace at the very beginning
of the quarter.
There were nines when a veritable
tug of words was waged!
FAIiKFK. GitANNIS
The ASSU-sjjonso:eu tour of nu
merous European countries by Far
rer and Grannis drew enlightening
praise in many quarters on campus.
Both travelers declared "that inter
national exchanges of students would
help to "better understand the prob
lems within each nation."
The pair vi ited Germany, France,
England, and Austria, reporting to
the student body the "general trend
and conditions existing in Europe.
There were many events which
went practically unheralded through
out the quarter.
In an unprecedented comic book
survey conducted in South San Fran
cisco, Palo Alto, and Mountain View,
three Stanford rad students found
"animal cartoons rating above all
other typc\s of comic developments."

Junior and senior high schools in the
three communities were tested.
lIUTCIIINS TALK
Dr. Robert M. Hutchins' talk to
a student-filled Memorial Auditor
ium was met with instantaneous suc
cess. Dr. Hutchins, chancellor of the
University of Chicago, advocated a
neighborly policy with regard to the
atom secret.
Other local items included the
establishment of an Opera Workshop,
the first Homecoming for alumni in
five years, a record-breaking enroll
ment of more than 8,000 students,
and the Pajamarino display of prop
erty damage.
Scientific experiments also zoomed
beneath the kleiglight staging area
with the construction of an electron
ics machine shop, tests on smog
Southern California style, and the
inauguration of the first vets' speech
clinic on a college campus.
Also of an interesting aspect was
a study conducted in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Headed by Dr. William
Greulich, professor of anatomy, a
survey was instituted on "the effect
of radiation in human growth, devel
opment and reproduction" in the
bomb-scarred areas.
VIOLATIONS FEW
Fire, flood, crime, deaths, and cam
pus traffic citations were held to a
minimum, the university police and
lire department reported.
Despite numerous student protests
at the issuance of traffic tags for
infractions of campus traffic viola
tions, the police department main
tained "that the great number of
vehicles on campus was necessary
for all action taken."
In what may be designated as the
surprise news story of the year, a
troupe of bridge players became
slightly irked at Rally Corn's refusal
to stage a rally prior to the Oregon
State-Stanford football game.
The card sharps gathered in front
of the Education I|uilding, pre
sented their "ten minutes of wit and
cheer" and promptly receipted for a
beating from the University of Cali
fornia team the next day.
PCC SPORTS TITLE
In the field of sports, other than
the disastrous football episode, the
Cards managed to snare their second
straight Pacific Coast Conference
water polo diadem, and captured a
frosh PCC football title.
The campus Flying Club, in losing
to aerialists from U.C., went through
its most successful campaign in its
more than ten years of existence.
In the field of dramatics, the Stan
ford Players, again demonstrating
its forte in collegiatc thespianatrics,
presented a pair of worthwhile plays,
namely "Richard III," and"The Fa
ther." Add to this the sporadic pre
sentation of the Stanford Gaieties of
1947 for a quarter of contrasting en
tertainment.
Abetted by the rise of foodstuff

prices, the Board of Trustees, after
carefully surveying the situation,
"raised the board bill on campus and
at the Village $15."
VILLAGE NEWS
The Stanford Village figured in
prominently during many instances
during the quarter, what with the
establishment of a nursery and Sun
day school, councils, and housing
groups in the midst of a record 1,700
Village inhabitants.
Water-bagging was kayoed by a
series of drastic regulations drawn
up by the Interfraternity Council.
Coeds on The Row, who were pur
portedly the victims of numerous
uncalled-for waterbagging incidents,
were quick to side with the Coun
cil's actions.
Completion of a new lighting sys
tem in the library's reserved book
room terminated what was reputed
to be "the butt of many a campus
joke of blind men stumbling among
the stacks."
CHARITABLE AID
Charitable aid due to the actions
of the International Relief Organi
zation, and the Community Chest,
boosted Stanford's post war charity
contributions beyond the $11,000
mark.
The University of Naples, adopted
by the University as part of a na
tionwide collegiate effort to alleviate
scholastic conditions in Europe, be
came the recipient of numerous
packages sent to Naples by SIRO.
But for all of the tumultuous rah
de-dah shown by Stanford students
during the past two months, the con
tent of news remains much the same
as in the previous years.
HCL has been throttled by WCC,
and oil Stanford, "that's news!"

Abetted by the rise of foodstuff

prices, the Board of Trustees, after
carefully surveying the situation,
"raised the board bill on campus and
at the Village $15."
VILLAGE NEWS
The Stanford Village figured in
prominently during many instances
during the quarter, what with the
establishment of a nursery and Sun
day school, councils, and housing
groups in the midst of a record 1,700
Village inhabitants.
Water-bagging was kayoed by a
series of drastic regulations drawn
up by the Interfraternity Council.
Coeds on The Row, who were pur
portedly the victims of numerous
uncalled-for waterbagging incidents,
were quick to side with the Coun
cil's actions.
Completion of a new lighting sys
tem in the library's reserved book
room terminated what was reputed
to be "the butt of many a campus
joke of blind men stumbling among
the stacks."
CHARITABLE AID
Charitable aid due to the actions
of the International Relief Organi
zation, and the Community Chest,
boosted Stanford's post war charity
contributions beyond the $11,000
mark.
The University of Naples, adopted
by the University as part of a na
tionwide collegiate effort to alleviate
scholastic conditions in Europe, be
came the recipient of numerous
packages sent to Naples by SIRO.
But for all of the tumultuous rah
de-dah shown by Stanford students
during the past two months, the con
tent of news remains much the same
as in the previous years.
HCL has been throttled by WCC,
and oil Stanford, "that's news!"
The high cost of living took a back
scat to Stanford's Western College
Congress which yesterday won "top
news honors" as the most important
news story of the quarter at Stan
ford.
Despite the continued upward
splurge of food prices, the fact that
Stanford was fortunate to be the
host to the western states' delegates
aided materially in the linal selec
tion.
TOP FIVE LISTED
Other lop ranking stories included:
1. The European reports of Bill
Fairer and Lawrence Grannis with
reference to their summer "tour of
Europe."
2. Marchie Schwartz' unfortunate
campaign which found the Stanford
lootball team losing nine straight
games.
3. The subsequent loss of the Stan
ford Axe.
4. Douglas Whitaker's Tuesday
Evening Series disclosure that "bac
teria and other low forms of life
would have a better chance to sur
vive than man."
5. And"the new look."
Observers on campus, despite
handing VVCC the zenith laurel, were
wont to agree that tlle Schwartz epi
sode was the most astounding cli
max to "the worst football season in
Stanford history."
Even Schwartz was forced to de
clare: "It was the darndest thing."
AXE LOSS
The loss of the Axe, sequestered
on campus since 11)42, was a blow
attired in an ironic cloak of "accum
ulated spirit" which was partially
responsible for a presentation of a
plaque to the Cardinal gridiron coach
after the season.
Gagsters had their fun poking con
troversial adjectives at "the new
look" which was thrust before the
male populace at the very beginning
of the quarter.
There were nines when a veritable
tug of words was waged!
FAIiKFK. GitANNIS
The ASSU-sjjonso:eu tour of nu
merous European countries by Far
rer and Grannis drew enlightening
praise in many quarters on campus.
Both travelers declared "that inter
national exchanges of students would
help to "better understand the prob
lems within each nation."
The pair vi ited Germany, France,
England, and Austria, reporting to
the student body the "general trend
and conditions existing in Europe.
There were many events which
went practically unheralded through
out the quarter.
In an unprecedented comic book
survey conducted in South San Fran
cisco, Palo Alto, and Mountain View,
three Stanford rad students found
"animal cartoons rating above all
other typc\s of comic developments."

Junior and senior high schools in the
three communities were tested.
lIUTCIIINS TALK
Dr. Robert M. Hutchins' talk to
a student-filled Memorial Auditor
ium was met with instantaneous suc
cess. Dr. Hutchins, chancellor of the
University of Chicago, advocated a
neighborly policy with regard to the
atom secret.
Other local items included the
establishment of an Opera Workshop,
the first Homecoming for alumni in
five years, a record-breaking enroll
ment of more than 8,000 students,
and the Pajamarino display of prop
erty damage.
Scientific experiments also zoomed
beneath the kleiglight staging area
with the construction of an electron
ics machine shop, tests on smog
Southern California style, and the
inauguration of the first vets' speech
clinic on a college campus.
Also of an interesting aspect was
a study conducted in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Headed by Dr. William
Greulich, professor of anatomy, a
survey was instituted on "the effect
of radiation in human growth, devel
opment and reproduction" in the
bomb-scarred areas.
VIOLATIONS FEW
Fire, flood, crime, deaths, and cam
pus traffic citations were held to a
minimum, the university police and
lire department reported.
Despite numerous student protests
at the issuance of traffic tags for
infractions of campus traffic viola
tions, the police department main
tained "that the great number of
vehicles on campus was necessary
for all action taken."
In what may be designated as the
surprise news story of the year, a
troupe of bridge players became
slightly irked at Rally Corn's refusal
to stage a rally prior to the Oregon
State-Stanford football game.
The card sharps gathered in front
of the Education I|uilding, pre
sented their "ten minutes of wit and
cheer" and promptly receipted for a
beating from the University of Cali
fornia team the next day.
PCC SPORTS TITLE
In the field of sports, other than
the disastrous football episode, the
Cards managed to snare their second
straight Pacific Coast Conference
water polo diadem, and captured a
frosh PCC football title.
The campus Flying Club, in losing
to aerialists from U.C., went through
its most successful campaign in its
more than ten years of existence.
In the field of dramatics, the Stan
ford Players, again demonstrating
its forte in collegiatc thespianatrics,
presented a pair of worthwhile plays,
namely "Richard III," and"The Fa
ther." Add to this the sporadic pre
sentation of the Stanford Gaieties of
1947 for a quarter of contrasting en

bomb-scarred areas.
VIOLATIONS FEW
Fire, flood, crime, deaths, and cam
pus traffic citations were held to a
minimum, the university police and
lire department reported.
Despite numerous student protests
at the issuance of traffic tags for
infractions of campus traffic viola
tions, the police department main
tained "that the great number of
vehicles on campus was necessary
for all action taken."
In what may be designated as the
surprise news story of the year, a
troupe of bridge players became
slightly irked at Rally Corn's refusal
to stage a rally prior to the Oregon
State-Stanford football game.
The card sharps gathered in front
of the Education I|uilding, pre
sented their "ten minutes of wit and
cheer" and promptly receipted for a
beating from the University of Cali
fornia team the next day.
PCC SPORTS TITLE
In the field of sports, other than
the disastrous football episode, the
Cards managed to snare their second
straight Pacific Coast Conference
water polo diadem, and captured a
frosh PCC football title.
The campus Flying Club, in losing
to aerialists from U.C., went through
its most successful campaign in its
more than ten years of existence.
In the field of dramatics, the Stan
ford Players, again demonstrating
its forte in collegiatc thespianatrics,
presented a pair of worthwhile plays,
namely "Richard III," and"The Fa
ther." Add to this the sporadic pre
sentation of the Stanford Gaieties of
1947 for a quarter of contrasting en
tertainment.
Abetted by the rise of foodstuff

prices, the Board of Trustees, after
carefully surveying the situation,
"raised the board bill on campus and
at the Village $15."
VILLAGE NEWS
The Stanford Village figured in
prominently during many instances
during the quarter, what with the
establishment of a nursery and Sun
day school, councils, and housing
groups in the midst of a record 1,700
Village inhabitants.
Water-bagging was kayoed by a
series of drastic regulations drawn
up by the Interfraternity Council.
Coeds on The Row, who were pur
portedly the victims of numerous
uncalled-for waterbagging incidents,
were quick to side with the Coun
cil's actions.
Completion of a new lighting sys
tem in the library's reserved book
room terminated what was reputed
to be "the butt of many a campus
joke of blind men stumbling among
the stacks."
CHARITABLE AID
Charitable aid due to the actions
of the International Relief Organi
zation, and the Community Chest,
boosted Stanford's post war charity
contributions beyond the $11,000
mark.
The University of Naples, adopted
by the University as part of a na
tionwide collegiate effort to alleviate
scholastic conditions in Europe, be
came the recipient of numerous
packages sent to Naples by SIRO.
But for all of the tumultuous rah
de-dah shown by Stanford students
during the past two months, the con
tent of news remains much the same
as in the previous years.
HCL has been throttled by WCC,
and oil Stanford, "that's news!"
The high cost of living took a back
scat to Stanford's Western College
Congress which yesterday won "top
news honors" as the most important
news story of the quarter at Stan
ford.
Despite the continued upward
splurge of food prices, the fact that
Stanford was fortunate to be the
host to the western states' delegates
aided materially in the linal selec
tion.
TOP FIVE LISTED
Other lop ranking stories included:
1. The European reports of Bill
Fairer and Lawrence Grannis with
reference to their summer "tour of
Europe."
2. Marchie Schwartz' unfortunate
campaign which found the Stanford
lootball team losing nine straight
games.
3. The subsequent loss of the Stan
ford Axe.
4. Douglas Whitaker's Tuesday
Evening Series disclosure that "bac
teria and other low forms of life
would have a better chance to sur
vive than man."
5. And"the new look."
Observers on campus, despite
handing VVCC the zenith laurel, were
wont to agree that tlle Schwartz epi
sode was the most astounding cli
max to "the worst football season in
Stanford history."
Even Schwartz was forced to de
clare: "It was the darndest thing."
AXE LOSS
The loss of the Axe, sequestered
on campus since 11)42, was a blow
attired in an ironic cloak of "accum
ulated spirit" which was partially
responsible for a presentation of a
plaque to the Cardinal gridiron coach
after the season.
Gagsters had their fun poking con
troversial adjectives at "the new
look" which was thrust before the
male populace at the very beginning
of the quarter.
There were nines when a veritable
tug of words was waged!
FAIiKFK. GitANNIS
The ASSU-sjjonso:eu tour of nu
merous European countries by Far

praise in many quarters on campus.
Both travelers declared "that inter
national exchanges of students would
help to "better understand the prob
lems within each nation."
The pair vi ited Germany, France,
England, and Austria, reporting to
the student body the "general trend
and conditions existing in Europe.
There were many events which
went practically unheralded through
out the quarter.
In an unprecedented comic book
survey conducted in South San Fran
cisco, Palo Alto, and Mountain View,
three Stanford rad students found
"animal cartoons rating above all
other typc\s of comic developments."

Junior and senior high schools in the
three communities were tested.

Scientific experiments also zoomed
beneath the kleiglight staging area
with the construction of an electron

Southern California style, and the
inauguration of the first vets' speech

Also of an interesting aspect was
