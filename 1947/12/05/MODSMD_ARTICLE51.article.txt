# Prof. Terman Writes About Bright Progeny
## 
### 
The man who "raised" a family
of 1,500 "quiz kids" yesterday snort
ed at the old theory that a child can
be too bright for its own good.
The debunker was Dr. Lewis M.
Terman, noted Stanford University
psychologist, who published his
facts in a book entitled "The Gifted
Child Grows Up."
The common belief that the
brighter - than - average is fore
doomed to wind up a psycho case,
or develop the personality of a dys
peptic Dracula, says Dr. Terman, is
nothing more than an old wives'
tale.
Dr. Terman should know.
STUDIED 25 YEARS
To gather material for his book
(written in collaboration with Mrs.
Melita H. Oden), the psychologist
spent 25 years studying the devel
opment of a selected group of 1,500
high-IQ youngsters.
In 1921 —when the quiz kid "fam
ily" was first selected—the group
ranged in age from 3 to 18 years.
Today their average age is 35 years.
In the intervening quarter of a
century Dr. Terman kept close
check on the progress of his prote
ges— frequently plying them with
intimate questionnaires on subjects
ranging from hobbies to marital re
lations.
His conclusions, as contained in
his newly published book, are glad
tidings for the anxious parents of
budding prodigies.
QUIZ KID HEALTHY
He found that, on the average,
children of high intelligence are su
perior to the general child popula
tion in physique and general health,
their mortality rate is lower, and
their scholastic records are vastly
superior.
Dr. Terman's long - range study
proved that the grown-up quiz kid
has:
1. Eight or nine times better
chance to make good in a profes
sional career than an average child.
2. His earnings (at 35) are sub
stantially greater than those of an
average college graduate.
3. He is better fed, housed, and
doctored.
4. His (or her) chances for suc
cessful marriage are equal or supe
rior to the "normal."
5. He is less liable to become in
sane, personally maladjusted, alco
holic, delinquent, or homosexual.
So if your precocious moppet
prattles about nuclear fission when
he should be lisping Mother Goose
rhymes, don't worry. Dr. Terman
thinks he has a pretty good chance
—despite his peculiarities.
