# Retirement Adjustment Approved by University
## 
### 
Modification of the faculty annu
ity program at Stanford to provide
increased retirement funds for fac
ulty members who signed retire
ment annuity contracts in recent
years was announced by President
Donald B. Tresidder in a letter sent
to faculty members holding con
tracts.
The action, approved by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees and ef
fective Jan. 1, 15)48, recognized the
fact that interest rates of annuity
contracts have decreased since 1932,
resulting in smaller faculty annui
ties.
Under the change in the teachers'
insurance and retirement annuity
contracts, adjustments will be made
in the contributions of the faculty
and the University to bring the pre
miums into line with present-day
interest rates. Such changes, how
ever, are optional with the faculty
members.
While the interest rates vary on
annuity policies, according to the
time at which they were issued, the
general idea of the readjustment,
Dr. Tresidder said, is to make it
possible for a faculty member who
takes out a policy at 30 to have ac
cumulated an annuity which equals
approximately 45 per cent of his
average salary for his last five years
of service by the time he retires
at 65.
Under the' Jan. 1, 1948, modifica
tion of the annuity plan, the new
contributions in terms of percentage
of the salary for the individual and
matched by an equal contribution
from the University will be 7 per
cent for contracts issued between
Jan. 1, 193(3, and Nov. 30, 1938. and
7Vi per cent on the contracts issued
after that date.
The total premium on the 1936-
38 contracts will thus be 14 per
cent, and 15 per cent for the later
contracts.
