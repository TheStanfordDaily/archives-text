# Daily Experts Shoot for .800 Mark With Season's Final Prognostications
## 
### 
Going into their final series of
picks with a terrific .793 per
centage, The Daily's prognosti
cators stick their necks out by
predicting all the major bowl
games almost four weeks in
advance.
But first there are two games to
be played tomorrow, one of which
may turn out to be the number one
gridiron encounter of the year.
NOTRE DAME-USC.—Two unde
feated teams, ranked first and third
in the nation, respectively. The Irish
have Johnny Lujack and a host of
other stars. The Trojans have
strength at every position—and a
chance to advance the prestige of
western football to its pre-war sta
tus. Three scribes favor Troy, but
the majority are forced to string
along with Frank Leahy's South
Benders.
CONSENSUS—Notre Dame by 5
points.
LOUISIANA STATE-TULANE—
The traditional battle for the cham
pionship of the Bayou State. Louisi
ana State, highly-touted before the
season started, has a mediocre 5-3
record, while the Green Wave's only
claim to fame is a one-point early
see "ion victory over Alabama. LSU
is he unanimous choice.
CONSENSUS—Louisiana State by
, ,
And the Bowl Games:
USC-MICHIGAN—The Rose Bowl.
We would have a better idea about
this one after the Trojans are
through with Notre Dame, or vice
versa. The predictors seem to think
even more highly of Chappuis and
Co. than of the Fighting Irish. The
Wolverines are a unanimous choice.
CONSENSUS—Michigan |,y 11.
ALABAMA-TEXAS—The Sugar
Bowl. Defeated twice early in the
year, the Crimson Tide has won its
seven straight. Texas has lost only
to strong Southern Methodist. The

scribes split even on this one,! five
favoring the L°nghorns and the
same number siding with the Tide.
But our special handicap point-rat
ing system gives the edge to Texas.
CONSENSUS—Texas by 1.
PENN-STATE - SOUTHERN
METHODIST —The Cotton Bowl.
This game brings together the top
team of the Southwest and what
may well be the strongest team in
the East. The Nittany Lions are un
defeated and untied, while SMU was
tied last week by Texas Christian.
Four of the pickers like Penn
State, but the majority think that
Doak Walker will be too much for
the easterners.
CONSENSUS—Southern Methodist
by 3.
GEORGIA TECH-KANSAS—The

Orange Bowl. This is another toughie.
Two ties mar the Kansans' record,
while the Engineers have "klob
bered" all their opponents except
Alabama. Six of the staff favor the
Plainsmen, while four tab Tech to
win. The point-rating system gives
the nod to the Ramblers, but the
majority rules.
CONSENSUS—Kansas by 1.
THIS WEEK'S SPECIAL!!
Although two experts are playing
the longshot and one coyly figures
the bout as just too tough to pick,
a super-refined consensus says that
Joe Louis will knock out Jersey
Joe Wolcott in exactly 1:30 of the
sixth round tonight, and retain his
world's heavyweight championship.


One of the main reasons why the Daily experts pick Notre Dame to
beat USC tomorrow is pictured above. The gentleman's name is
JOIINNY LUJACK, "Mr. Drains" of the Fighting Irish. The experts
say Lujack will be the difference between the two clubs and pick Notre
Dame by five points.
