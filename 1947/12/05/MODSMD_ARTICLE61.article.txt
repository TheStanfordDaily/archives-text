# SAE Mural footballers Score Upset Over Previously Unbeaten Betas, 18-7
## 
### 
The elements proved to be no
handicap to the smooth-working
SAE's gridders who yesterday af
ternoon downed a previously unde
feated, untied, and unscored upon
Beta Thota Pi team, 18 to 7.
At the outset it looked as if the
SAE's would go the way that all of
Beta's opponents have gone this sea
son. On the first play of the game,
Beta Bernard Woody passed to Har
ry Reichling for a touchdown. The
try for point was good and the Betas
moved out in front, 7 to 0.
SAE'S SCORE
Moments later the SAE's inter
cepted a Beta aerial on their own 40
and then cut loose with a passing
attack of their own that went all the
way to score, Casella taking John
Brudie's pass for the touchdown.
Later, in the first half, the yellow
shirted SAE's effectively stymied the
Beta passing offensive and Casella in
tercepted another pass that set up
the stage for the second Sigma Alpha
Epsilon tally. Brudie passed to Cas
ella and the Beta's for the first time
this season, found themselves on the
short end of a 12 to 7 count.
The half ended wwith the SAE's on
the Beta G yard line.

In the second period the victor's
unleashed a combined passing and
running attack and pushed down to
the Beta three. Jim Brett, SAE, took
Brudie's pass in the end zone for the
final six points that put them out in
front 18 to 7.
BETA'S COME BACK
The heavier, hard-charging Betas
repeatedly tried to get back in the
ball game. Late in the second quar
ter, with Harry Reichling, George
Malloy, and Dave Porter leading the
assault they plov/ed down to the
SAE's nine, but there the offensive
bogged down.
Today's mural contest will pit the
victorious SAE's against the Village
117's once-beaten Big Red Machine.
Should the SAE's win they would
annex the 1947 Intramural Football
crown.
