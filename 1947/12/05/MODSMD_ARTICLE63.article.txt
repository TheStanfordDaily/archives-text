# RUGBY SIGNUP
## 
### 
A 1 Morris, captain-elect of Stan
ford's varsity rugby team asked
yesterday that members of last year's
team, as well as prospective new
ruggers should sign the sheet on the
bulletin board in the Men's Gym
before Monday.
Morris explained that while losses
from graduation were small, there
are plenty of openings for those
willing to take a few knocks and
bruises.
