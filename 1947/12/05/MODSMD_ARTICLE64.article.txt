# Boxers Meet in All-University Ring Show at Pavilion Tonite
## 
### HOWIE RIPER 
The eyes of the boxing world
may be centered on the Louis-
Wolcott fracas in New York's
Madison Square Garden to
night, but to Stanford fight fol
lowers, the world's heavy
weight championship bout is of
secondary importance.

Three thousand spectators will jam
the Pavilion this evening to witness
the largest, and what should be the
best, fight card in Farm history. A
card of 13 bouts is scheduled with
the first fight set for 8 p.m.
NOVICES FIGHT FIRST
Seven Novice Tournament finals
will be fought first and the six All-
University championship bouts will
close out the card.
The feature event of the evening
pits Elia Long against Joe Cranmer
in the 175-pound All-University
final—a true battle of champions.
Cranmer has never lost a 175-pound
match and he was the All-Univer
sity winner in this weight class last
year. He is also undefeated in col
legiate competition.
LONG OUTSTANDING
While it is generally conceded that
Long is Stanford's outstanding boxer,
Cranmer is in excellent condition
and the final decision of the judges
may be in his favor.
According to Boxing Coach Ray
Lunny, the Long-Cranmer light is
worthy of a main event in a pro
fessional boxing match. "Both boys
are classy boxers and powerful
punchers," Lunny said, "and their
bout will be packed with action from
start to finish."
Lunny declines to name either
boxer as the probable winner. "Your
guess is as good as mine," he said,
"but one thing is certain, Long and
Cranmer rate with the top light
heavyweights on the Coast and the
exhibition they'll put on in the ring
tonight will live up to the reputa
tions they've acquired."
BOOTHE DEFENDING CHAMP
Another highlight of the Tourna
ment is the 155-pound class in which
Willie Altus faces Ferris Boothe.
Boothe is the defending champion,
having acquired the title last year.
He won the Novice 155-pound crown
in 1943 and sports a record of 10
wins in 11 college fights.
Altus was a finalist in the 145-
pound class last year. He is a fast,
clever fighter and should give Boothe
lots of trouble, especially if he boxes
as well as he did while defeating
Dick Stanton in the eliminations
Wednesday.
The 145-pound All-University final
pits AI Marquez against Pete Wil
lett. Willett won the 135-pound title
last year and is fighting in a heavier
division this year. However, he has
been having trouble making the
weight for the 145-poiinders and un-

I less he can come into the ring in this'
' class, he will have to forfeit the title
j to Marquez. If this is the case, the
! men will fight an exhibition.
OSMAN VS. BRITTAN
I The other All-University tussles
j which round out the card tonight
feature Kent O'smon against Marty
' Brittan at 135 pounds, Irwin Rosa
and Fred Ten Eyck in the 165-pound
class, and Emery Mitchell versus

Bill Brown in the Heavyweight div
ision.
The Ten Eyck-Rosa fight may turn
out to be the crowd-pleaser of the
show. Ten Eyck, a sophomore and
finalist in the tourney last year, fights
from a low croueh. Rosa earned his
boxing letter last season and is noted
for his ruggedness.
lIE A VVWEIC; I ITS TA N( iLE
The last contest of the evening
stars heavyweights Emery Mitchell
and Bill Brown. Mitchell, recent
transfer from Fresno State, was the
CCJZA Heavyweight champion last
year and his appearance tonight in
Stanford trunks is both interesting
and pleasing to Farm fans.
The Novice Tournament bouts
feature comparative unknowns. They
are certain to provide lots of action.
Though inexperienced, these boys
are swinging hard at all times and
it is usually the Novice tilts that
keep the crowd continually on its
feet.
The two top Novice bouts of the
show see 155-pounders Mori White
and John Van Benthem square off
and Bill Sharp take on Vic Paimieri
in the 175-pound class.
Both Van Benthem and White are
hard hitters who have had to win
two fights each to reach the finals.
Sharp and Paimieri are powerful
punchers and their meeting may
result in a knock-down affair.


RAY LUNNY—Stanford boxing
coach promises a rough "n tough
ring show tonight in the pavilion.
