# New President to Maintain Momentum of University
## 
### 
Dr. Clarence H. Faust, new
acting president of Stanford, j
expressed a desire to maintain
the momentum of the University
during his six-month term of
office. "We'll try not to lose any
time," he said in an interview with
The Daily editor and Lorry Lokey, j
associate editor.
His comments were in answer to j
a question whether the president's j
office would have any other work j
besides preparation of the new
budget during the interim period.
He expanded his statement by :
pointing out that Stanford is going
ahead in every way—in the devel
opment of its undergraduate pro- }
gram, in research, and in new j
building.
"The optimism and enthusiasm [
here is what impressed me most
about Stanford," Dr. Faust said.
"One has the feeling that this is a
place where important things can
and will be done."
Stanford's position in the West as

an eminent private university was
stressed by the new president. As
a substantial private university in
a fast-growing area, Stanford has a
i great opportunity of leadership in
research and thought.
After 18 years of apartment living
;in Chicago. Dr. Faust said he
! greatly enjoys living on the campus.
Faust Likes Teaching
One of Stanford's attractions
! which Dr. Faust says he shares with
other faculty members is the situa
tion which gives the faculty a share
in making plans. "Personally. I like
to combine teaching with adminis
trative work," Dr. Faust added.
Discussing the possible danger of
i Stanford's becoming a graduate
school, Dr. Faust said neither un
dergraduate or graduate work will
be de-emphasized. Instead, Stan
ford wants to carry both categories
to higher levels.
Graduate Students
The present increase in graduate
students is probably the result of
I many factors, Dr. Faust conjec
! tured. There is the national emi
! nence of various departments, and
| conditions are operating to bring
j more students back for graduate
work than ever before.
To prevent the undergraduate
I part of the University from being
| de-emphasized is one of the reasons
j for the major academic reorganiza
tion last April which combined the
Schools of Biological Science, Hu
manities. Physical Sciences, and So
cial Sciences into one unit. The
undergraduate work is organized
according to subject matter; there is
a separate dean of graduate study.
More Coordination
Another reason for the reorgan
ization is that the new faculty im
proves coordination of work of de
partments. Much research cuts
deoartment lines, and some
of the most interesting research
vUts across tne Schools of Human
ities and Social Sciences.
When people talk about a uni
versity becoming predominantly a
graduate school, they should re
member the purpose of the univer
sity is really two-fold: to train an
undergraduate student body, and to
engage in research and provide fu
ture recruits for advanced work and
research, Dr. Faust observed.
"Again, speaking for myself, I en-
I joy teaching both graduates and

undergraduates. And I'm sure most
of the faculty members do."
Undergraduate Teaching
Turning away from Stanford for
a minute. Dr. Faust told a few de
tails of the SI,OOO prize awarded by
the University of Chicago for ex
cellence in undergraduate teaching,
an award he won in 1937. There
are three prizes, donated anony
mously. he revealed. The selection
is made informally, from informa
tion gleaned from advisers and stu
dents.
Dr. Faust said he would return to
his job as Dean of the Stanford
Faculty of Humanities and Sciences
at the end of his term as acting
president.

Faust Likes Teaching
One of Stanford's attractions
! which Dr. Faust says he shares with
other faculty members is the situa
tion which gives the faculty a share
in making plans. "Personally. I like
to combine teaching with adminis
trative work," Dr. Faust added.
Discussing the possible danger of
i Stanford's becoming a graduate
school, Dr. Faust said neither un
dergraduate or graduate work will
be de-emphasized. Instead, Stan
ford wants to carry both categories
to higher levels.
Graduate Students
The present increase in graduate
students is probably the result of
I many factors, Dr. Faust conjec
! tured. There is the national emi
! nence of various departments, and
| conditions are operating to bring
j more students back for graduate
work than ever before.
To prevent the undergraduate
I part of the University from being
| de-emphasized is one of the reasons
j for the major academic reorganiza
tion last April which combined the
Schools of Biological Science, Hu
manities. Physical Sciences, and So
cial Sciences into one unit. The
undergraduate work is organized
according to subject matter; there is
a separate dean of graduate study.
More Coordination
Another reason for the reorgan
ization is that the new faculty im
proves coordination of work of de
partments. Much research cuts
deoartment lines, and some
of the most interesting research
vUts across tne Schools of Human
ities and Social Sciences.
When people talk about a uni
versity becoming predominantly a
graduate school, they should re
member the purpose of the univer
sity is really two-fold: to train an
undergraduate student body, and to
engage in research and provide fu
ture recruits for advanced work and
research, Dr. Faust observed.

Undergraduate Teaching
Turning away from Stanford for
a minute. Dr. Faust told a few de
tails of the SI,OOO prize awarded by
the University of Chicago for ex
cellence in undergraduate teaching,
an award he won in 1937. There
are three prizes, donated anony
mously. he revealed. The selection
is made informally, from informa
tion gleaned from advisers and stu
dents.
Dr. Faust said he would return to
his job as Dean of the Stanford
Faculty of Humanities and Sciences
at the end of his term as acting
president.
Dr. Clarence H. Faust, new
acting president of Stanford, j
expressed a desire to maintain
the momentum of the University
during his six-month term of
office. "We'll try not to lose any
time," he said in an interview with
The Daily editor and Lorry Lokey, j
associate editor.
His comments were in answer to j
a question whether the president's j
office would have any other work j
besides preparation of the new
budget during the interim period.
He expanded his statement by :
pointing out that Stanford is going
ahead in every way—in the devel
opment of its undergraduate pro- }
gram, in research, and in new j
building.
"The optimism and enthusiasm [
here is what impressed me most
about Stanford," Dr. Faust said.
"One has the feeling that this is a
place where important things can
and will be done."
Stanford's position in the West as

an eminent private university was
stressed by the new president. As
a substantial private university in
a fast-growing area, Stanford has a
i great opportunity of leadership in
research and thought.
