SEATTLE, Jan. 3 (/P). —Fourteen
persons, 11 of them Yale University
students returning to New Haven
after the holidays, died in the crash
and fire of a chartered transport
plane at Boeing Field here last
night. The other three were the
crew of the DC-3.
The plane carried 27 students and
16 of them escaped.
A dozen students were pulled to
safety from the flaming wreck by
mechanics and air line employees
at the field. The others apparently
got out unaided.
Witnesses said the field was icy
and a light fog ranging over it at
the time of the 10 p.m. takeoff.
John Kostelnik was one of two
Boeing mechanics and three United
Air Lines employees who aved 12
of the youths.
Kostelnik, 36, himself dragged six
of them from the plane. He said
today:
"I'm sorry I couldn't get more of
them out. I got six out—six of
them, some of them burning. One
fe'low was on his hands and knees
crawling toward me. His hair was
a mass of fire. The smoke was so
thick he couldn't see where he was
going. Crawled right into me."
R. D. Bedinger, regional admin
istrator of the CAA. said the pilot,
William Chavers of Seattle, was
warned twice by the control tower
that conditions were '"below min
imum" required for takeoff.
Officials of the Air Charter Serv
ice, which operated the plane, said
they disagreed with Bedinger's con
clusions after reading a transcript
of the conversations between the
olane's officers and the control
tower.
James R. Cluck, member of the
'aw firm reuresenting Seatt'e Air
Charter, said a CAA summary of
the conversation between the con
trol tower and pilot discloses the
"i.rns for takeoff."
'"It also shows," the attorney said,
"that the pilot was anxious to com
ply with instructions."
