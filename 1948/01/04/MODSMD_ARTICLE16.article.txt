# Congress Opens Session; GOP Loses Rules Fight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (AP) —The 81st Congress opened today
with a big victory for the Truman administration—a vote which
smashed the power of the House Rules Committee to block the
' Truman deal."
The President's supporters steamrollered through the House a

4 resolution curbing the authority
of this "traffic cop" committee,
which historically has determined
whether a bill shall go to the House
floor for a vote or gather dust in a
| pigeonhole.
j The final decision was by voice
; vote, but the real test came on a
previous rollcall which the admin
istration won, 275 to 142.
Rep. Sabath (D-Ill.), 82-year-old
administration supporter who is to
become chairman of the rules com
mittee, started the parliamentary
skirmishing. Conscious of the fact
that Southern Democrats and Re
publicans on the committee might
j combine to block much of the Tru
man social and labor legislation, he
offered a resolution to slash the
committee's powers.
Sabaih Coup
Republican leaders sought to
amend Sabath's resolution, but he
quickly made a motion to cut off
debate and prevent amendments.
His motion passed, 275 to 142, and
thus the Republican leaders lost.
Then the Sabath resolution
whopped through on a voice vote.
This was one of two major devel
opments as the Democrats took
command of Congress after two
i yeai"s of Republican rule.
The other development occurred
in the Republican camp, where the
Senate GOP beat down a rebellion
of "Young Turks" seeking to un
. seat Senator Taft of Ohio as Re
publican Policy Committee chair
man, and put Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts in his place.
Taft was re-elected 28 to 14.
Elect Wherry
Old-line Republicans also in
stalled their choice as floor leader,
electing Senator Wherry of Nebras
ka by a 28-14 vote over the insur
! Rents' candidate. Senator Knowland
i of California.
But the self-styled '"liberals"
managed to get at least a foot in
the door with the election of Sena
tor Saltonstall of Massachusetts as
GOP "whip," or assistant floor
leader.
The insurgents later announced
! they will continue to tight for a
I more liberal GOP policy.
In the House, Republican leaders
sought in vain to build a Republi
l can-Democrat coalition big enough
; to block the change in the rules
i committee's powers. Some Demo
crats. notably from the South, did
I lin *? up against the change; but
some Republicans voted for it.
The net result was that 22;>
Democrats. 49 Republicans and
one American-Laborite favored the
change. Against it were 111 Re
publicans and 31 Democrats.

Elect Wherry
Old-line Republicans also in
stalled their choice as floor leader,
electing Senator Wherry of Nebras
ka by a 28-14 vote over the insur
! Rents' candidate. Senator Knowland
i of California.
But the self-styled '"liberals"
managed to get at least a foot in
the door with the election of Sena
tor Saltonstall of Massachusetts as
GOP "whip," or assistant floor
leader.
The insurgents later announced
! they will continue to tight for a
I more liberal GOP policy.
In the House, Republican leaders
sought in vain to build a Republi
l can-Democrat coalition big enough
; to block the change in the rules
i committee's powers. Some Demo
crats. notably from the South, did
I lin *? up against the change; but
some Republicans voted for it.
The net result was that 22;>
Democrats. 49 Republicans and
one American-Laborite favored the
change. Against it were 111 Re
publicans and 31 Democrats.


SNOW BRIGHTENS (he grounds and caps the dome of the nationaJ
capitol in Washington, where the opening session of the 81st Congress
was held yesterday.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (AP) —The 81st Congress opened today
with a big victory for the Truman administration—a vote which
smashed the power of the House Rules Committee to block the
' Truman deal."
The President's supporters steamrollered through the House a

4 resolution curbing the authority
of this "traffic cop" committee,
which historically has determined
whether a bill shall go to the House
floor for a vote or gather dust in a
| pigeonhole.
j The final decision was by voice
; vote, but the real test came on a
previous rollcall which the admin
istration won, 275 to 142.
Rep. Sabath (D-Ill.), 82-year-old
administration supporter who is to
become chairman of the rules com
mittee, started the parliamentary
skirmishing. Conscious of the fact
that Southern Democrats and Re
publicans on the committee might
j combine to block much of the Tru
man social and labor legislation, he
offered a resolution to slash the
committee's powers.
Sabaih Coup
Republican leaders sought to
amend Sabath's resolution, but he
quickly made a motion to cut off
debate and prevent amendments.
His motion passed, 275 to 142, and
thus the Republican leaders lost.
Then the Sabath resolution
whopped through on a voice vote.
This was one of two major devel
opments as the Democrats took
command of Congress after two
i yeai"s of Republican rule.
The other development occurred
in the Republican camp, where the
Senate GOP beat down a rebellion
of "Young Turks" seeking to un
. seat Senator Taft of Ohio as Re
publican Policy Committee chair
man, and put Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts in his place.
Taft was re-elected 28 to 14.
