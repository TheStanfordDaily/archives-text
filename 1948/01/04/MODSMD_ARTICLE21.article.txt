## Work To Do 
### 
With the dawn of a new year arrives the dawn of new hope. |
Such has been man's though for ages. The new year has al
ways seemed a fitting time for starting anew. The making of j
New Year's resolutions is commonplace. The Chinese, to make '
the New Year truly the beginning of new hope, canceled all i
debts from the previous year.
Speaking allegorically, the year 1949 will not be free from the ,
debts of 1948. But the new year does give a fresh starting point. !
The new courage which seems to arise with the new year gives
3iew hope.
Much of that new hope from our point of view lies in the
graduates of Stanford University; since Stanford, as an eminent
private university, is looked to for leadership. If even a few
persons hold to their original reason for getting a university edu- i
cation—to learn how to leave the world in a little better condition !
lhan they found it—that hope will be realized. Getting a living ;
is paramount in our lives, of course, but if we can take some
lime from the ordinary tasks of life to work on the problems that
beset mankind, the world will be better for having nourished us.
Surely there is much work to do—work for political science |
majors, economics majors, journalists, and educators.
Political scientists have a gigantic task. There is an urgent I
need for a return to diplomacy by the United States. The United !
States has lost ground diplomatically everywhere in the world
except in Berlin. Forgetting that our own country was born of !
revolution (a social revolution), we have denied support to revo-1
Jutions everywhere in the world. As the world's leading expo- 1
nent of the industrial revolution we have provided the tools for
ihe technological revolution in all corners of the world. But when- i
ever that technological revolution led naturally and inevitably
1o social revolution, we have turned our backs. Soviet Russia
has been quick to step in to take the ideological lead, to give di
rection to the revolution made possible by our technological
mastery. We have followed dollar diplomacy with dollar de
mocracy, but we have denied the world what it wants most —
leadership.
Journalists face the question of whether their profession is ;
lesing prestige and confidence of the American people. Results
of the recent Presidential election seem to indicate that newsmen
are out of step, or out of touch at least, with the reading public.
America led the movement from newspapers for the few to mass
.information, but somewhere in the transition something was :
]ost. Is it that news manufacturers in their zeal to cover the great '
events have neglected their most important beat—the people?
Educators have a number of problems. After a number of
innovations attempted in the last four decades, there is still a
cry that education is inadequate. Teachers on every level com
plain that students are not properly prepared before reaching
ihem. There are a number of plans for overhauling the educa
tional system. On another tack, there is little that approximates
national standards of education in the United States. Equality of
opportunity, too, is missing. There is a concerted move to pro
vide more scholarships by the state to well qualified students who
are financially unable to continue past high school.
Law makers certainly have their work cut out for them. In
-948 Lady Justice frequently took a bad beating. A war-time law
and a vindictive judge sent a veteran to prison for 10 years for
passing a "no account" check for S4l. A Washington business
man explained the law as necessary to protect the businessmen
irom losses from bad checks. In Redwood City a Polish alien
woman received a one-year sentence. She had been charged
with murder and armed robbery. On the same newspaper page
which carried her sentence appeared a story of an American
sentenced to a year in jail for stealing bread from a bakery. In
:he same year news stories told of a man who was finishing his
]Bth year in prison for a 52.43 branch post office robbery.
It has often been said there are as many economic theories
as there are economists. And it is easy to believe when one high
authority states positively we are due for a "bust," and others rise
lo contradict him. One group of economists argues that economic
cycles of boom and bust are inevitable; another argues that proper
government control will prevent depression. Economic planning
and thinking that will prevent depression is certainly a worth
while task for economics majors.
Yes, there is much work to do—work that should prove a
challenge to some Stanford men and women. Accordingly, these
musings are set down early in the year 1949.

revolution (a social revolution), we have denied support to revo-1

nent of the industrial revolution we have provided the tools for
ihe technological revolution in all corners of the world. But when- i
ever that technological revolution led naturally and inevitably
1o social revolution, we have turned our backs. Soviet Russia
has been quick to step in to take the ideological lead, to give di

Journalists face the question of whether their profession is ;

of the recent Presidential election seem to indicate that newsmen
are out of step, or out of touch at least, with the reading public.
America led the movement from newspapers for the few to mass

Educators have a number of problems. After a number of
innovations attempted in the last four decades, there is still a
cry that education is inadequate. Teachers on every level com
plain that students are not properly prepared before reaching
ihem. There are a number of plans for overhauling the educa
tional system. On another tack, there is little that approximates
national standards of education in the United States. Equality of
opportunity, too, is missing. There is a concerted move to pro
vide more scholarships by the state to well qualified students who
are financially unable to continue past high school.
Law makers certainly have their work cut out for them. In
-948 Lady Justice frequently took a bad beating. A war-time law
and a vindictive judge sent a veteran to prison for 10 years for
passing a "no account" check for S4l. A Washington business
man explained the law as necessary to protect the businessmen
irom losses from bad checks. In Redwood City a Polish alien
woman received a one-year sentence. She had been charged
with murder and armed robbery. On the same newspaper page
which carried her sentence appeared a story of an American
sentenced to a year in jail for stealing bread from a bakery. In
:he same year news stories told of a man who was finishing his
]Bth year in prison for a 52.43 branch post office robbery.
It has often been said there are as many economic theories
as there are economists. And it is easy to believe when one high
authority states positively we are due for a "bust," and others rise
lo contradict him. One group of economists argues that economic
cycles of boom and bust are inevitable; another argues that proper
government control will prevent depression. Economic planning
and thinking that will prevent depression is certainly a worth
while task for economics majors.
Yes, there is much work to do—work that should prove a

With the dawn of a new year arrives the dawn of new hope. |
Such has been man's though for ages. The new year has al
ways seemed a fitting time for starting anew. The making of j
New Year's resolutions is commonplace. The Chinese, to make '
the New Year truly the beginning of new hope, canceled all i
debts from the previous year.
Speaking allegorically, the year 1949 will not be free from the ,
debts of 1948. But the new year does give a fresh starting point. !
The new courage which seems to arise with the new year gives
3iew hope.
Much of that new hope from our point of view lies in the
graduates of Stanford University; since Stanford, as an eminent
private university, is looked to for leadership. If even a few
persons hold to their original reason for getting a university edu- i
cation—to learn how to leave the world in a little better condition !
lhan they found it—that hope will be realized. Getting a living ;
is paramount in our lives, of course, but if we can take some
lime from the ordinary tasks of life to work on the problems that
beset mankind, the world will be better for having nourished us.
Surely there is much work to do—work for political science |
majors, economics majors, journalists, and educators.

opportunity, too, is missing. There is a concerted move to pro

Law makers certainly have their work cut out for them. In
-948 Lady Justice frequently took a bad beating. A war-time law
and a vindictive judge sent a veteran to prison for 10 years for
passing a "no account" check for S4l. A Washington business
man explained the law as necessary to protect the businessmen
irom losses from bad checks. In Redwood City a Polish alien
woman received a one-year sentence. She had been charged
with murder and armed robbery. On the same newspaper page
which carried her sentence appeared a story of an American
sentenced to a year in jail for stealing bread from a bakery. In
:he same year news stories told of a man who was finishing his
]Bth year in prison for a 52.43 branch post office robbery.

cycles of boom and bust are inevitable; another argues that proper
government control will prevent depression. Economic planning
and thinking that will prevent depression is certainly a worth
while task for economics majors.
Yes, there is much work to do—work that should prove a

musings are set down early in the year 1949.
