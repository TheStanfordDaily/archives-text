## 
### 
The Daily lakes this opportunity
to say farewell to Dr. Alvin C. Eu
rich, former acting president, and
to wish him success in his new
job as head of the newly established
New York State University.
Dr. Eurich took over direction of
Stanford University last February
after the untimely death of Presi
dent Donald B. Tresidder. He gave
the presidency his devoted atten
tion, and great things were accom
plished during his 11-month term.
Among them were the beginning
of the non-academic employees' re
tirement program, the appointment
of 43 new professors, and the huge
building program.
Dr. Eurich's last program, the
new $175,000 organic chemistry lab
oratory building, was announced in
yesterday's Daily. Other building
projects supervised by Dr. Eurich
were the remodeling of the Admin
istration Building into the $1,000,-
000 plant for the Law School; Stern
Hall; reconstruction of two School
of Mineral Sciences buildings on
Quad; expansion of the University's
steam plant; modernization of the
campus electrical distribution sys
tem; and construction of a new
$170,000 Microwave Laboratory.
Crothers Hall was dedicated in Dr.
Eurich's term of office.
Dr. Eurich first came to Stanford
from Northwestern in 1938 as pro
fessor of education. From 1942 to
1944, as a commander in the Naval
Reserve, he served as officer in
charge of the standards and cur
riculum section of the Bureau of
Naval Personnel. He returned to
Stanford as academic vice-presi
dent in 1944.
Dr. Eurich has held numerous
posts on national committees and
commissions, including President
Truman's Commission on Higher
Education and the Personnel Policy
Committee of the Hoover Commis
sion on the Organization of the Ex
ecutive Blanch of the Government.
He is widely known as the co-au
thor of the current affairs tests
published in Time magazine, and as
author of numerous books and ar
ticles on educational subjects.
Dr. Eurich's new post makes him
the New York counterpart of Cali
fornia's Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul.
He will be in charge of one of the
largest state higher educational
systems in the country. The New
York State. University will take
jurisdiction over all state-operated
higher educational institutions on
April 1. It will then include 32
units that now have an enrollment
of 28.500 students. In addition, the
University has been directed to es
tablish additional four - year col
leges, community colleges, and two
medical centers, each to include
schools of medicine, dentistry, and
nursing.
We know that the New York
State University will prosper under
Dr. Eurich's leadership. As Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur ob
served, "Alvin C. Eurich is a man
who understands education."
