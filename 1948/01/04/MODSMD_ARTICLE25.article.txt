# Truman's New Deal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3 </P>. —
Prsidcnt Truman will tell the Dem
ocratic - controlled 81st Congress
what he wants of it in three mes
sages within the next week.
Administration officials predict
Mr. Truman will ask:
Higher taxes, probably on busi
ness, to avoid a deficit in the fiscal
year beginning next Ju'y 1.
Repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act
and enactment of less extensive la
bor-management legislation.
A spending budget of about $43,-
000.000,000, highest in peace-time.
It will reflect higher costs of the
"cold war" and a broad social wel
fare program.
Some tightening of economic con
trols.
Mr. Truman will deliver his
"state of the union" message to
Congress Wednesday. He is ex
pected to tell the lawmakers that
they start their deliberations at a
time of unprecedented prosperity,
income, and production.
His economic report goes to Cap
itol Hill Friday. He is expected to
say that inflation still is a hazard
despite a four-month skid in food
prices and a slight, two-month de
cline in living costs. Whether Mr.
Truman will again ask the strong
standby price and ration controls of
his old ten-point anti-infiation pro
gram is a toss-up. He must make
the final decision since his Council
of Economic Advisers is divided on
the issue.
Edwin G. Nourse, chairman of
the council, reportedly believes the
business out'ook does not warrant
severe control legislation at this
moment.
But Vice-Chairman Leon Key
serling said publicly last week the
government must adopt measures
to "check the boom so it will not
turn into a bust." The third coun
cil member, John D. Clark, is re
ported to share Keyserling's views.
Mr. Truman is faced with nation
al defense cost totaling nearly $15,-
000,000,000 the next fiscal year —
about 25 per cent higher than this
year's. Foreign aid costs will re
main high.
These are the major factors which
will cause Mr. Truman in his budg
et message a week from today to.
ask for a total budget of around
$43,000,000,000. Mr. Truman has
said that income will not match
such spending in view of the 1948

tax cut—without new tax revenues.
Since Mr. Truman has said ie
peatedly the nation must show *
surplus in times of prosperity to.re
duce the national debt, a detnand
for higher taxes is regarded as in
evitable.
There is disagreement within his
administration as to whether the
wartime excess profits tax should
be restored. On the other hand, Mr.
Truman has argued that lower
bracket income families should not
be penalized in view of the high
cost of living.
That leaves corporation rates and
unrcr-bracket incomes as the prob
ab'e potential sources to be tapped.
There is strong likelihood that
Mr. Truman will ask for mandatory
allocation powers over scarce ma
terials. These would be designed to
assure industry co-operation in the
voluntary allocation program. It
expires Feb. 28. Extension will be
asked.
Other proposals of Mr. Truman
are expected to include:
Increase of the minimum wage
from 40 to 75 cents hourly; a 50
per cent boost in old age insurance
benefits; social security coverage
for farm workers, domestic work
ers. and the self-employed; nation
al health insurance; federal aid to
education.
A permanent Fair Employment
Practices Commission, along with
other parts of his 11)48 civil rights
program.
Tighter rent control, extended
for at least one year beyond March
31; federally aided public housing
and slum clearance.
Extension beyond June 30 of ex
port and import contro's, as well as
the remaining controls over sale
and use of tin, antimony, and trans
portation equipment.
Extension of credit controls, due
to expire June 30.
A three-year extension of the re
ciprocal trade agreements act, mi
nus limitations imposed by the 80ih
Congress.
Ratification of the St. Lawrence
Waterway treaty; authorization for a
Missouri Valley Authority and other
regional authorities.
A long-range farm program in
cluding a permanent system of farm
price supports, soil conservation
work, and a school lunch program;
also, repeal of the federal oleomar
garine taxes and ratification of the
international wheat agreement.
