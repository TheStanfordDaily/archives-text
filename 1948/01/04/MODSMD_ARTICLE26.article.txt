# Truman to Tell Congress U.S. Winning Cold War
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 4 (/Pi. — j
President Truman is expected to
tell Congress tomorrow that the i
United States is winning the first j
stage of the struggle with Russia, j
To that he is expected to add that a
long and costly campaign of coun- I
ter-action still lies ahead.
Despite Communist victories in
China, the President's top foreign i
policy advisers regard 1948 as a j
year of great gains in unifying the
Western anti - Communist nations j
and building up their economic and
military power. But they are equal
ly convinced that only continued j
development along these lines can |
make the gains permanent. Hence |
the plans for military support of
Western Europe.
Russian counter-moves during the 1
past year have taken the form of 1
the Berlin blockade, increased
Communist pressure in Asia, and a
speedup in efforts to complete the
communization of the Soviet's own j
Eastern European satellite eoun
t ries.
But American experts do not be
lieve the Soviet reaction to the !
strengthening of the West will stop j
there. There is considerable spec- j
ulation here that the Soviets may !
launch a new peace offensive in the
now year to try to disarm the West
quiet the continued war fears of
Western European leaders, and
thereby weaken the newly found J
Western unity.
Because they believe that will be
the case, some of Mr. Truman's own
foreign advisers reacted skeptically i
to his assertion last week that there |

j are in the Kremlin some Soviet
'eaders who would like to be more
! friendly with the West. In the
| present mood of the State Depart-
I ment —and reports are the French
and British Foreign Offices feel the
j same way—any Russian show of
| friendship would have to be backed
up by powerful proof if it is to
convince the President's own advis-
I
ers.
These officials take the line that
i the men who rule Russia are fully
j determined upon a Communist
1 conquest of the world. That is re
; garded as the Kremlin's certain
| long-range strategy. A Russitfn ef
! fort to effect a truce in the cold war,
however, is also regarded as quite
possible. In the American view it
would be a tactical move—a mn
j neuver to gain time in which to
j prepare for the next Communist
[ push.
A false show of friendship, in
! the view of many State Department
i officials, therefore, seems to be the
most dangerous potential weapon
|in the Soviet arsenal. If the So
! viets employed it effectively to try
ito break down the new We tern
grouping of nations, it might wreck
many of the rains of the past year.
The past 12 months have brought
1 a partial disappearance of "neu
tral" nations in the most critic :1
I areas of the cold war. This was
j caused partly by Communist ac
; tions in Eastern Europe, partly by
increasing evidence that the United
States is in Western Europe to stay
| until real peace is established.
