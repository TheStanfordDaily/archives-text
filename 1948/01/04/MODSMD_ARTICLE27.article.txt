# Yanks Zoom Skyways In Air Corps Thriller
## 
### AL BERRY 
Hi Ho. the zoomies are off in a j
cloud of blood, fire, and prop-wash, i
The Stanford's got it.the nasty old
jerrys get it, and Edmond O'Brien j
leads his thunderous Fighter!
Squadron to new American heroic
accomplishments: airplanes are
falling, men are dying (usually the
hated japanazis), and Hollywood
has turned out the greatest air
extravaganza since "A Yank in the
RAF." which was also lousy.
Don't give up the ghost 011
"Fighter SquladSon" too soon, j
though. It is entertainment. The
AAF photos which the two War
ners use in abundance are excel
lent. The technicolor is de-lightful, |
and the acting is good. Edmond
O'Brien (The Web, another part of
the forest) has yet to turn in a
bad performance. The stirring, but
now tiresome strains of the Army
Air Corps song are not played. And
on the whole Mr. Average Movie
goer (if there is such a thing) will
be able to sit back and pretend
that he too can drive a jug (P-47
to you) across the blood-drenched
European skies.
The plot of the pix is vaguely
familiar. It tells of the Bth AF fly
guys who must fly fighter protec
tion for B-17s in the industry

blasting days prior to D-Day. The
impetuous lads would much rather
fly at 00 feet and knock the hats
ofT the Nazis heads with their ever
churning propellers. The stupid
people in Division headquarters,
however, seemed to want their
bombers to come back rather than
simply run the war for the edifi
cation of the fighter fellas from
Warner Bros.
Colonel O'Brien; however, finally
convinces the high command that
his plan is bestest for supreme tri
umph. The boys go in at 00 feet,
utterly destroy the German Air
force on the ground, and lose only
Bob Stack and a few inconsequen
tial bit players. In the end, when
Colonel O'Brien goes down, the
audience is left with the comfor
table feeling that he will turn up
at the war's end in Paris with a
French acrobatic dancer. The
whole thing is very satisfying.
It is early in the quarter, studies
aren't pressing, and if you can catch
a night that features no basketball
games, go and see the flick. It is
a good time-killer, and is a MUST
for all Air ROTC students.


THE AILING WHITE HOUSE, sonic of its walls
cut away, is pictured here showing where rotting
timbers will be replaced with steel beams inside

the walls, leaving the appearance of the structure
as it was conceived by George Washington.
