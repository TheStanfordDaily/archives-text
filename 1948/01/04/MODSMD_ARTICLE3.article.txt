# Registration Drops Below Winter 1948
## 
### 
Reg figures released by the Reg
istrar's office at 4:30 p.m. yester
day are as follows, with compara
tive 1943 figures listed at the right:
1»4!» 194 Si
Men 5,502 5,074
Women 1,574 1.826
These figures show a decrease of
424 over winter quarter last year,
but are misleading inasmuch as the
returns are only up to 4:30 p.m.
Congestion Late in Day
There was congestion in the 3:15
to 5 p.m. period yesterday, but all
who arrived at Memorial Audito
rium before 5 p.m. were able to
begin registration. Some did not
complete all steps, however.
Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, regis
trar, said last night that possibly
the closeness of Reg Day to New
Year's caused many students to
miss their alphabetical group in the
morning and register in the after
noon from 3:15 to 5.
No Reduction Expected
'"A reduction in registration is
not expected," he said. ''Today's
late registrants are expected to
make up the difference."
'"Most students registered quick
ly and simply, without difficulty,
especially in the morning," he said.
"'On the whole, registration was
smooth. Pre-registration in physi
cal education classes probably
helped."
Late registrants should get their
reg books today at Temporary
Building AGO. Fees are payable at
the cashier's window in Encina
Hall. New students who register
late may have their photographs
taken today.
