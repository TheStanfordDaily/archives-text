The State Association, made up of
members of the American Psycho
logical Association residing in Cali-
I fornia, went on record recently as
1 favoring state licensing of profes
! sional psychologists.
The Association has appointed a
| committee to aid in preparing a
bill for such licensing. The bill will

untrained people offering advisory
j service in the field of psychology.
