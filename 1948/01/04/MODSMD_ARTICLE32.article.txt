# Mural Signups Due Monday; Bowling Limited to 32 Teams
## 
### 
Intramural Bowling action will
be limited to '.12 teams this quarter,
j.ccording to Mural Director Chuck
Taylor. Only the first U2 teams to
sign up will he allowed to compete.
This move was made necessary
because of the limited availability
of the Village alleys. Intramural
bowling competition will be held in
the afternoons.
An entrance fee of $10 will be

charged for bowling this quarter,
Taylor announced. This fee will be
returnable at the end of the quarter
provided the team does not forfeit
any of its matches.
A loss was suffered by the Village
alleys during fall quarter because
of the many forfeitures by teams
low in the standings. When a team
does not show up, the pin boys who
have been engaged for the time
must be paid anyway.
The $10 entrance fee is being
charged to keep out teams who
sign up only for the sake of sign
ing up. Teams which abide by the
spirit ol intramural competition
will be in no way penalized.
Living groups are requested to
appoint house athletic representa
tives in time for the mural man
agers' meeting Thursday evening.
The meeting will be held in the
BAC at 7:15.
Monday is the deadline for sign
ups for all sports. Sports included
in this quarter's program are bas
ketball, wrestling, ping pong, and
bowling. Mural play begins
Wednesday, Jan. 12.
