Rated as money in the bank before the California disastei

last week's PCC Tournament fi 1
Stanford has already downed
fast-moving Bruins once this
son. Meeting the Westwooder
the semi-finals of the PCC Ton
ment, Stanford had its own wa
coasting to a 55 to 47 win.
Local scribes were just begin
to think that the Redshirts >
going to walk all over Sout
Division competition when Cal
nia upset the plans. Now the w
thing is in a mess.
A Dizzy Process
California has beaten Stan
Stanford has beaten UCLA. U
has beaten St. Mary's. St. M
has beaten California, and wh<
boys, it's like a merry-go-rouri'
, All of which means that any
in the Southern Division is caj
j ol beating another team on a ,t
nigbt. So Stanford tlakes o
package of Southern* do;
trouble that weekend when
Cards open up with UCLA on
day night and then meet
deflated Trojans on Saturday r
With Big George Yardle?
unanimous choice for all-toi
ment honors last week, in the <
er's seat, Stanford should be
to get past both the Bruins
Trojans.
Bruins Use Fast Break
UCLA, working hard for a
coach, has been surprisingly s
so far this season. The Bruins
ploy a helter-skelter fast b
and use big men such as G(
Stanich, Carl Krausher, and
Sawyer to good advantage.
Sam Barry's Trojans, h;
trouble getting started, are le<
Bill Sharman and Abe Andre
the forward spots. Sharman
tricky dribbler and point-m
but after that Coach Barry b
to scratch his scalp.
Stanford definitely needs a
ble victory to get into contei
for the division title. Boasting
over Big Nine champ Mich
over Lavelli and his Yale ore
and other opponents inch
St. Mary's and Santa Clara,
homebreds certainly appear to
the ability to stuff the whole P
Coast into their hip-pockets.
Yardley Is Standout
George Yardley is perhaps
most sparkling individual
former in the Southern Diy
and backed up by reliable
Stephenson and Dave Davi
who came back into his own
a brilliant performance ajj
Michigan, he should lead the w
a double win this weekend.
Milt "Squinty" Iverson, ;i re
forward, has been looking
sharp in recent games, and ma
starting action against UCLA
should add swift to Stanford'
tack in helping to combat the
speed.
