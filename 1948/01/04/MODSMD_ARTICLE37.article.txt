is in the best of taste for
> scribes during these first few
ol the New Year, I have
d over and tried to list the
moments of Stanford athletic
s lor the past year.
■ ust conless that it was a little
ilt to find beautiful adjectives
year in which our basketball
tied for the Southern Division
, in which our baseball squad
nired deep in the second half
■ CBA, and in which our loot
team, although gallant and
on certain Saturdays, dropped
landkerchief more often than
uiortl Doesn't Quit
as always when a Stanford
is in the field of battle, there
those days in '48 when Stan-
Redshirted Indians couldn't
ipped. And it is not necessary
' that Stanford's athletes and
-'s were on the job at all times,
. everything they had, and
my rewards for such efforts
well earned.
aber One student of 1948, as
rom the Front Row, was the
basketball performance of
tephenson that night in March
Stanford upset California's
?ated Bears to break a five
jinx -and stop Berkeley from
the first team in history to
a clean sweep of the Southern
jn. Big Bill's 20 points and
i backboard control in that
must rank as the top per
uce of the year.
i«S Boot of Year
frosh footballer, tough Bill
I, supplied the biggest boot
■ year when he angled from
delines a last-second 39-yard
goal to put the fininshing

touches to a perfect Freshman seu
j'son, as he and his pals romped over
j Cal lrosh, 30 to 0.
Finest come-through of '43 was
attributed to guard .lack Mi-Kit
] (rick, who put on the stolen ball
| act against San Joi;e to score the
winning touchdown and climax the
most successful football rally of the
jseason.
Consistent Charlie Cole, Harry
j Wolters' pride and joy on the initial
sack, played big league baseball all
season for Stanford's hot and cold
i horsehiders. Three-C Cole rates
I spot number four because of his
| consistent stick work and his lancy
J fielding at first base.
Emery Mitchell and the entire
Stanford football team offered
bright spot number five when the
Indians invaded the Coliseum in
October to do battle wiih Brer
Bruin. Marchie's men had not
beaten UCLA since 1941, and
hadn't won a conference game in
two years, but they bounced off
the ropes to thrash West wood but
j good, 34 to 14.
Larry lloff by a Nose
A thinclad trackster, quick
stepping Larry lIofT, earned a place
in the top 10 when he nosed out
I San Jose'h long-striding Thelmo
Knowles in the finest 440 duel seen
iin Stanford Stadium in many
| moons.
A half-court basketball field goal
I ought to get you into any best-ever
list, and Stanford had two boys in
1948 who supplied the magic for
the trick. IMarv Gel her, mainstay
! of the Frosh five, accomplished Hie
teat first and in the more dynamic
fashion. Gelber went into his long
j distance form with only seconds re
i maining in the first Cal-Stanford
' frosh mixup, and when the ball
i finally swished through the net, the
gun had exploded and Stanford had
won by two points. George Yardley
popped one in for the varsity a few
days later, but it was only a half
time climax and had no great sig

nificance on the final outcome.
Dave Field's one-handed inter
ception of a Cal pass and a 40-yard
runback of the same in the 7 to 6
Big Game was one ol' the most
sparkling football plays of the sea
son.
Wet Athletes Help Out
And finally, cheers for the swim
ming and water polo squads, the
only two groups to bring home the
championship bacon to old Leland
Junior during the sad days of 194&.
And so, farewell to '48. It is not
difficult to say goodbye, especially
with the prospects of happy days
for 1949 shining like a new bathing
suit.
Stanford has a great basketball
team with which to start the new
season, one that has beaten Big
Nine champ Michigan, trounced
Yale, and has won 10 out of 11 pre
conference contests.
Coach Jack Weiershauser is look
ing forward to one of Stanford's
best track seasons since the days of
Clyde Jeffrey.
Baseball news is all good, and
Captain Bill Arce and his horsehide
associates have their guns sighted
on hauling down the CBA title.
And finally, some persons would
have it that Stanford will be strut
ting its stuff in the Rose Bowl on
Jan. 1, 1950. So, if two and two adds
up to four, 1949 should be a boom
year for the Farm. Leave us pray
hard.

two years, but they bounced off
the ropes to thrash West wood but

is in the best of taste for
> scribes during these first few
ol the New Year, I have
d over and tried to list the
moments of Stanford athletic
s lor the past year.
■ ust conless that it was a little
ilt to find beautiful adjectives
year in which our basketball
tied for the Southern Division
, in which our baseball squad
nired deep in the second half
■ CBA, and in which our loot
team, although gallant and
on certain Saturdays, dropped
landkerchief more often than
uiortl Doesn't Quit
as always when a Stanford
is in the field of battle, there
those days in '48 when Stan-
Redshirted Indians couldn't
ipped. And it is not necessary
' that Stanford's athletes and
-'s were on the job at all times,
. everything they had, and
my rewards for such efforts
well earned.
aber One student of 1948, as
rom the Front Row, was the
basketball performance of
tephenson that night in March
Stanford upset California's
?ated Bears to break a five
jinx -and stop Berkeley from
the first team in history to
a clean sweep of the Southern
jn. Big Bill's 20 points and
i backboard control in that
must rank as the top per
uce of the year.
i«S Boot of Year
frosh footballer, tough Bill
I, supplied the biggest boot
■ year when he angled from
delines a last-second 39-yard
goal to put the fininshing

touches to a perfect Freshman seu
j'son, as he and his pals romped over
j Cal lrosh, 30 to 0.
Finest come-through of '43 was
attributed to guard .lack Mi-Kit
] (rick, who put on the stolen ball
| act against San Joi;e to score the
winning touchdown and climax the
most successful football rally of the
jseason.
Consistent Charlie Cole, Harry
j Wolters' pride and joy on the initial
sack, played big league baseball all
season for Stanford's hot and cold
i horsehiders. Three-C Cole rates
I spot number four because of his
| consistent stick work and his lancy
J fielding at first base.
Emery Mitchell and the entire
Stanford football team offered
bright spot number five when the
Indians invaded the Coliseum in
October to do battle wiih Brer
Bruin. Marchie's men had not
beaten UCLA since 1941, and
hadn't won a conference game in
two years, but they bounced off
the ropes to thrash West wood but
j good, 34 to 14.
Larry lloff by a Nose
A thinclad trackster, quick
stepping Larry lIofT, earned a place
in the top 10 when he nosed out
I San Jose'h long-striding Thelmo
Knowles in the finest 440 duel seen
iin Stanford Stadium in many
| moons.
A half-court basketball field goal
I ought to get you into any best-ever
list, and Stanford had two boys in
1948 who supplied the magic for
the trick. IMarv Gel her, mainstay
! of the Frosh five, accomplished Hie
teat first and in the more dynamic
fashion. Gelber went into his long
j distance form with only seconds re
i maining in the first Cal-Stanford
' frosh mixup, and when the ball
i finally swished through the net, the
gun had exploded and Stanford had
won by two points. George Yardley
popped one in for the varsity a few
days later, but it was only a half
time climax and had no great sig

nificance on the final outcome.
Dave Field's one-handed inter
ception of a Cal pass and a 40-yard
runback of the same in the 7 to 6
Big Game was one ol' the most
sparkling football plays of the sea
son.
Wet Athletes Help Out
And finally, cheers for the swim
ming and water polo squads, the
only two groups to bring home the
championship bacon to old Leland
Junior during the sad days of 194&.
And so, farewell to '48. It is not
difficult to say goodbye, especially
with the prospects of happy days
for 1949 shining like a new bathing
suit.
Stanford has a great basketball
team with which to start the new
season, one that has beaten Big
Nine champ Michigan, trounced
Yale, and has won 10 out of 11 pre
conference contests.
Coach Jack Weiershauser is look
