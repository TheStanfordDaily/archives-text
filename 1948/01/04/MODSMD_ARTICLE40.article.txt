NEW YORK, Jan. 3 (/P)â€”College
football, which has been gorging it
sell' more and more on after-season
bowl dessert, may have to tighten
its belt for a skimpier diet.
A special NCAA committee has
been making a study of the multi
tudinous bowl games. It is sched
uled to report during the meeting
of college heads this weekend in
San Francisco. This could mean a
tighter rein on colleges, fewer of
the post-season spectacles.
