Employment situation for young
engineers was studied by Robert
Swenson, assistant director of the
Appointment Service in a survey
of 135 Stanford engineering stu
dents.
Four-fifths of the graduates got
work in this state, the survey dis

covered, and most all were em
ployed somewhere.
Those who had master's degrees
received on the average $36 a
month more than those with
bachelor's degrees; and an addi
tional $39 it they had the degree
of engineer; and still $34 more it

they had a Ph.D. in engineering.
Civil engineers led in salaries in
the bachelor degree level with an
average of $290 a month for their
first year's work. % Graduates with
master's degrees in electronics
topped the rest of the M.S. gryup
with an average monthly salary of

! $328.
The survey also indicated that
engineering graduates have a 25
i per cent chance of getting a raise
after three months; a 75 per cent
chance after six months; and after
nine months, he is almost certain
to have received a raise.
