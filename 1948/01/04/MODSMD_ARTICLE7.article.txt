# Cyclotron Building Nears Completion; Accelerator Due in January, 1951
## 
### 
Physics department faculty yes- I
terday expressed hope that the
Microwave Laboratory equipment
could be moved into the new lab
oratory building behind Sequoia
Hall by Feb. 1.
Eldridge T. Spencer, University
director of planning, said yesterday
that work on the future home of the
billion-volt eectron linear acceler
ator is rapidly approaching com
pletion. Construction began last
summer.
Spencer said that telephone, light,
ind sewer facilities will be connect
ed within the next two weeks. At
I Present, workmen are installing in
i ternal fixtures an! partitions.
1 After the completion of the struc

ture, it must be inspected and ac- '
cepted by the University. Then the
physics department may move in.
J. F. FitzGerald of the physics
department said that it is not yet
known whether part or all of the
equipment of the laboratory, now
located in the Physics Building, will
be moved this winter. The techni
cal staff will move into the new
offices in the building, however.
Dr. William W. Hansen's 160-foot
electron accelerator, for which
the building was constructed, is
scheduled to be completed in Jan
uary, 1951. Various units of t.he
atom-smashing instrument are now
being constructed in the present
Microwave Laboratory and the
Ryan Hi^h-Voltage Laboratory.
