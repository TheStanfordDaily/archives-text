Pierre Monteux will conduct the
100-piece San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra in a varied program to
night, ranging in mood from the
brilliant orchestration of Berlioz to
a contemporary work by Morton.
Gould.
The program will open with Ber
lioz' "Overture to Benvenuto Cel
lini," followed by the Brahms Sym
phony No. 2 in D Major, Opus 73,
"Minstrel Show" by Morton Gould,
and Ravel's "Spanish Rhapsody."
Berlioz's opera about Cellini,
swashbuckling figure of the Renais
sance, has failed to keep the stage
except for sporadic revivals, and is
known in this country almost soleh
through the overture, composed of
melodies from the opera proper,
and the prelude to the second act.
Brahm's Second Symphony, per
haps the best introduction to his or
chestral music, is generally lyric
and sunny, though not without mo
ments of somberness. The sym
phony was performed for the first
time by the Vienna Philharmonic
Dec. 30, 1877, under the direction
of Hans Richter.
"'Minstrel Show," written in 1946
embodies the flavor of the old-time
minstrel tunes and style, alternating
between gay and nostalgic passages
There are characteristic sliding
trombone and banjo effects, and in
the middle of the piece, sandpaper,
blocks, and other percussion convey
the sounds and tempo of a soft-shoe
dance.
Ravel, born and raised in the
Basque country of southern France,
was of all French composers the
one most completely devoted to the
Spanish idiom. His "Spanish Rhap
sody," a study in musical materials
of Spanish character composed in
1907, is one of his most persuasive
tributes to the land below the Pyr
enees.


PIERRE MONTEUX will conduct
the 100-piece San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra at Stanford to
night.
