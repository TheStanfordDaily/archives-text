						Flu Epidemic May Strike Campus; Doctor Urges Students to Receive Shots
## 
### 
An influenza epidemic of the type
which hit Los Angeles recently will
probably strike the Stanford cam
pus within a few weeks unless a
] large percentage of the students re
ceive immunization shots.
Dr. George Houck, director of the
Health Service, made this predic
tion Saturday. More than 2.000 stu
| dents will be returning to Stanford
from the Los Angeles area this
: week and many of these will be
carriers of the highly communicable
| Hu germ, he said.
PUZZLING SICKNESS
Los Angeles was stricken with a
puzzling epidemic over the vacation
period. At one time more than 200,-
000 residents of that area were suf-

I fering from a sickness similar to,
i but in many respects more extreme
I than, the common flu.
At first this epidemic was attrib
j uted to an unknown "virus X."
) However, Dr. Houck termed the
i "virus X" story as unscientific. Ac-
I tually about one-half of the cases
| were a result of the so-called Fort
j Monmouth strain of influenza, he
• said.
NEW-TYPE VACCINE
Flu vaccines manufactured before
November of last year did not offer
adequate protection from the Fort
Monmouth strain.
The Health Service this morning
will receive enough of the new-type
| vaccine to handle from 2,000 to 4,000

Stanford students. The new vac
cine is specially designed to prevent
flu of the Foi l Monmouth variety.
Dr. Houck strongly urges every
one to get the flu shols. Within
eight days those receiving the shots
will be completely immune from the
flu.
The flu shots will he given at the
Health Service offices from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. daily.
SMALL DOSE
Those who received flu shots hist
quarter .should take these new shots
also. Dr. Houck said. However, they
are probably better off than those
who didn't take any anti-flu shots
at all, he continued.
The dose of the new vaccine is

only one-tenth the size of the usual
anti-flu injection. The injection is
followed by a local stinging sensa
tion for about 30 seconds but has
no general after-effects.
As the vaccine does not give im
munity until eight days after tak
ing, Dr. Houck advises all Stanford
students to get the shots as soon as
possible.
Among the first to take advantage
of the new vaccine were Dr. Houck
himself and Dr. Alvin C. Eurich,
vice-president of the University.
The type of flu which the new
vaccine protects against is a type
which produces a fever and inca
pacitates those stricken for varying
periods of time.
