# 'Marry Young,' Wilbur Advises
## 
### 
In an article in the January issue
[ of Pic entitled "Should Men Marry
Early?" Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur, supplying an affirmative answer
to the question, stated that having
a famijy to work for gives a young
man more earnestness of purpose
and a greater desire to get ahead.
Dr. Wilbur, along with Bishop G.
Bromley Oxnam, head of the New
York Methodist Church, took the
affirmative, while Rabbi Sidney E.
Goldstein, past president of the Na
tional Conference on Family Rela
tions and Paul H. Landis, Dean of
the Graduate School of Washington
State College, took the negative side
of the question.
Dr. Wilbur cited the fine record
made by our young married veter
ans in col lege as an illustration of
the wholesome, steadying influence
of early responsibility on a young
man. He added that the machine age,
with its emphasis upon the number
of gadgets required for housekeep
ing or a home, has set up false
standards which cause most young
men to postpone marriage until
they can support a wife on the eco
nomic level achieved by her parents
after 20 years of experience and sav
ings.
"Delayed marriage, instead of
early marriage," said Dr. Wilbur,
"means smaller families, more di
vorces, less happiness."
