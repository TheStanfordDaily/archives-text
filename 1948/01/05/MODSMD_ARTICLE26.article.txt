WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP).—
Chairman Robert A. Taft, R., 0.,
meets with his Senate Republican
policy committee tomorrow to be
gin drafting a GOP legislative pro
gram which may make or break the
party's chances in the presidential
campaign next fall.
One GOP source said the first
order of business for the Senate Re
publicans tomorrow will be a deci
sion on whether to go along with
House Republican plans to pass a
$3,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 tax cut
bill by Feb. 1. Other top priority
issues are the Marshall European
recovery program and anti-infla
tion legislation.
The impending bi-partisan fight
will reach the toe-to-toe stage Wed
nesday when Mi. Truman unfolds
the administration's legislative pro
gram in his state of the union mes-
I sage. That message will be followed
by his annual economic report on
! Friday, and on Monday, Jan. 12, he
will submit his budget message
which is expected to call for the
| spending of nearly $40,000,000,000
in the next fiscal year.
Democratic policy makers will
meet later to decide their course of
action on his recommendations.
It is deemed certain that Mr. Tru
man will reiterate his request for
standby rationing and wage-price
I controls to fight inflation. One top
! administration source said the Pres
\ dent also would "hit hard" at the
' need for social legislation—a mini
| mum wage law, extended social se
curity coverage and a health and
education program.


SENATOR KOUKRT A. TAI-T will
meet with (HOP leaders lo decide
party policy.
