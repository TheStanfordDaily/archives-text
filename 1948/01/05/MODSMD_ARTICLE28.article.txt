WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP) — |
Rumors that Secretary of Ihe In
terior J. A. Krug is about to leave I
President Truman's official family
persisted today despite denials by
both men.
Reports have been flying in re- I
cent months and Ihey got a new
spurt Friday following a secret
White House conference between
Mr. Truman and Krug.
Krug said several weeks ago that
he will remain in the cabinet "as I
long as Harry Truman wants me,"
and that there had been no sugges
tion he ought to resign. Word from
top White House levels is that Mr.
Truman has the highest regard for
Krug and is well satisfied with his
work.
Only one thing is certain—some
Western state senators are gunning
for King and Reclamation Commis
sioner Michael W. Straus because I
they don't like the way the Reel a* I
mation Bureau is being run.
