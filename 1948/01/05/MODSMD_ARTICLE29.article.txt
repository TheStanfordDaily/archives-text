WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP).â€”
Chairman Charles A. Eaton, I'., N.J.,
of the House Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, today attacked the constitu
tionality of the Blerter proposal to
deprive President Truman of au
thority to administer the Marshall
European recovery program.
He said he could not support any
plan which would take from the
President his right to the final say
over foreign affairs. He explained
that he is looking for a "middle of
the road" solution of the problem.
Chairman Christian A. Herter, R.,
Mass., of a special House committee
which investigated European relief
needs last fall, has recommended
that an independent agency he es
tablished to handle the program.
President Truman has asked that
full responsibility be placed in an
administrator subject to the direc
tion and control of the State De
partment;
"1 cannot conceive of any way in
which an independent agency can
be established to handle our for
eign relations without invading the
constitutional duties of the chief ex
ecutive," Eaton said.
