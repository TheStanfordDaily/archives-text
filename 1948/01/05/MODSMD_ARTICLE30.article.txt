ARCHIBALD, 0., Jan. 4 (UP) -
Ten children from three farm fam
ilies were instantly killed today
when a speeding New York Central
passenger train ploughed into their
tractor-towed bobsled as it crawled
slowly over a grade crossing.
Efforts of the engineer to stop the
train were futile.
The crash, called "one of the worst
highway accident death tolls on
record" by the National Safety
Council in Chicago, occurred at an
unguarded crossing one mile east
of here.
