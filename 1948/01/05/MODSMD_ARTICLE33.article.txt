# U.S.-Sponsored 'Little Assembly' Convenes Today
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., Jan. 4
(UP).- The United Nations begins
; its first major attempt to do busi
ness without Russia tomorrow when
the disputed "Little UN Assembly,"
originated by the United States,
convenes for a year-round debate
of world political issues.
The Soviet Union and its five
i supporters in the UN have an
nounced they will not participate in
I the new agency. No last - minute
change in Soviet policy seemed
. likely.
One of the most significant proj
ects yet undertaken by the big
American-led majority of the UN,
the "Little Assembly" meets at 11
a.m. EST tomorrow, beginning with
a brief address by UN Secretary
General Trygve Lie. Then it must
elect officers and decide how to
j tackle its small but. controversial
i agenda.
Between now and the meeting of
! the full 57-nation General Assem
i bly next September in Europe, the
'Little Assembly" will perform the
experiment of tackling important
| international issues without the
consent or participation of Russia,
j one of the two great powers most
I intimately concerned with the
world's political issues.
