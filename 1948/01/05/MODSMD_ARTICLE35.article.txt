# Card Five, Successful Practice Season Under Belts, Start PCC Play on Friday
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
With three victories in four starts during Christmas Vacation
and a seasonal record of seven wins and one loss, Stanford's
basketball squad begins its conference campaign this weekend,
meeting USC Friday night and UCLA Saturday night, in Los
Angeles.
The Indian five showed considerably more than a touch of

class in beating Oregon State, Ore
gon, and Arkansas in games at the
Cow Palace over the last two week
ends. Tired from an overtime win
over OSC the night before, Everett
Dean's team lost its only game to
Nebraska, 51 to 47, on Dee. 27.
Oregon State, defending confer
ence champion, was the Cardinals'
first victim, being whipped 53 to 48
in one overtime period. Tall forward
Bill Rose was on fire that night,
scoring 23 points, highest total for
any Indian this year.
cards lead at half
Stanford led 2<i to 17 at half-time
and at one time stretched this mar
gin to 13 points. T'-re Beavers, how
ever, put on a sensational rally in
the last five minutes to tie it up at
45-all at the end of the regular play
ing time. The Indians quickly sewed
things up in the five minute over
time despite the loss of Dave David
son and Bill Stephenson on personal
fouls.
Th.e next night the Nebraska
Cornhuskers, an unexceptional mid
west outfit, took advantage of a dis
tressing Stanford inability to bit the
basket, to score a four-point victory.
The game was close throughout,
being tied seven times, but the
whik'-shirted Cardinals simply did
n't have it.
Their shots caromed off the
backboards, rimmed out of the hoop,
did just about everything but go
through the net with any regu
larity. On the floor they were not
outplayed by the fast-breaking
Cornhuskers, but the payoff is on
the scoreboard.
DAVIDSON LEADS SCORERS
Whenever Stanford threatened,
one of Nebraska's two good guards,
Joe Brown or Cornelius Mosser,
would suddenly get hot on unstop
pable 20-foot shots, and the 'Huskers
would move out ahead. Davidson led
the Farm scorers with 12 points.
The Cards showed more stuff than
ever last Friday and Saturday in
whipping Oregon 52 to 45, and Ar
kansas, GO to 53.
A big center, six-foot-eight Ro
ger Wiley, and a little guard, five
foot-seven Stan Williamson, gave the
Stanford outfit most of its trouble in
the Oregon game.
With Morley Thompson and Bill
Rose hitting from 20 feet out and
Bill Stephenson making two nice tip

ins, the Indians overcame a 1!) to 12
lead which Wiley had built up al
most singlehanded, and went ahead
32 to 25 at the half.
WEBIEET RALLY
In the middle of the second half
Williamson led a Webfoot rally
i which brought the northerners to
within two points. Williamson, how-
I ever, became too aggressive at this
; point and fouled out. Without the
littleman's fast break leadership and
ball-hawking defensive play, the
Ducks were never again a threat.
Bill Stephenson retained ball con
trol for the Indians in the last min
; ute or so by simply dribbling the
ball around back of the free throw
circle while Wiley, by this time
clumsy and dead on his feet, gave
futile chase.
Holding the Razorbacks' six-foot
ten center George Kok to 17 points,
the Indians scored a seven - point
victory over a tall Arkansas team
on Saturday night.
STANFORD CONTROLS BALL
Kok, awkward and inept, lost
| backboard control to the more ag
gressive Stanford men, and that won
the game for the Cardinals.
Stanford led all the way, holding
a 52 to 38 advantage with six min
utes to play. The Razorbacks, with
; a full-court man-to-man defense
j and some lucky shots by Kokand his
| teammates, brought themselves up
to within four points, but Dave Da
vidson and substitute forward Milt
Iverson sneaked through the Arkan
sas defense for the clinching baskets
A heartening feature of this game
was the fact that 25 of Stanford's
} 60 points were scored by substitutes.
| Everett Dean has apparently dis
! carded the unit substitution idea, but
I there are several players capable of
[ spelling off the first five. Notable
among these are Iverson, Bob Penn,
i George Yardly, Gus Chavalas, and
Bill Lewis.
HIGGINS SHINES
Among the regulars, Captain Babe
j Higgins distinguished himself with
I his excellent floor play and steady
! ing influence on the team. Bill
Rose, the Menlo JC transfer, is the
j squad's leading pointmaker. Mor
| ley Thompson, the other forward.
1 has been a disappointment. The vet

eran southpaw has not found his
shooting eye.
Center Bill Stephenson has been
the Cards' big man under the basket
with most of his help coming from
rugged guard Dave Davidson.
University of San Francisco acted
as co-hosts with Stanford for the
Cow Palace doubleheaders. The di
minutive but fighting Dons won
only one game out of four.
Stanford's record of seven victor
ies and one defeat puts the In
dians at the top of the heap of both
southern division and bay region
teams.


STEVE STEPHENSON, tall Indian
center, is one of the main rea
sons Coach Everett Dean's basket -
ball five is boasting a won seven
lost one record in pre-conference
games. Their .875 win percentage
tops other teams in the Coast con
ference.
