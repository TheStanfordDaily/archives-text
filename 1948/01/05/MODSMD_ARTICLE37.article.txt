Quist and Ainslie Bell, played for
the West in the annual Shrine
| East-West game in San Francisco on
New Year's Day.
Quist played fullback on offense
backing game and placed fifth in the
balloting for most valuable player in
the game. Bell alternated with Virgil
Eikenburg of Rice as the West's
I T-formation quarterback but was
] hampered by an injury in his side.
Quist played fullbackk on offense
| and got off several good gains. Bell
I engineered one West drive which
| ended up on the one-yard line.
The West team trained at Stan
; ford, living in the Deke house.
Marchie Schwartz was co-.coach of
! the West, along with Don Faurot
lof Missouri and Pappy Waldorf of
[ Cal.
And, as if everyone didn't know,
the East, led by the great Johnny
Lujack of Notre Dame, trampled the
West 40 to 9.
Quist and Bell have left for Ha
waii as members of Herman Wede
! meyer's all-star team which is to
! play a series of games in the Islands.
Schwartz is also travelling—to
; Chicago for the National Football
! Coaches' Convention. Also repre

| senting Stanford is Athletic Di-
I rector A 1 Masters.
Stanford hopes for a successful
football season were dealt a severe
blow over the vacation when T. S.
Ary quit the Farm to enroll at Pur
i due University.
Ary, who transferred to Stan
ford from •th Carolina State,
is rated a great end prospect on the
basis of his play with service elevens.
He played two games for North
I Carolina State last season and could
not have played for Stanford until
| 1949 according to the strict Confer
ence code.
