# Pickers Have High Average

The peerless-picking consensus of
The Daily's sports' staff hit a last
minute splurge on football tabula
tions over the holidays, and boosted
itself over the magic .800 mark to
finish the season coasting along at
an .802 clip, boasting a seasonal
standing of 73 wins, 18 losses and 7
ties.
The staff posted a perfect last
week's prognostication mark, by cor
rectly calling winners in USC-Notre
Dame, USC-Michigan, Alabama-
Texas, and Georgia Tech-Kansas
games.
And on only Southern California's
two games did the consensus point
choices miss the mark by any dis
tance. The staff tabbed Notre Dame
a winner by only live points, while
Michigan was judged only 11 points
better than the Trojans.
Bill Swigart finished head and
shoulders above the rest of the staff
with an .842 average of correct win
ners in 100 games, followed by John
Hubbard with .783 in 113 games.
George Newell ended the year as
low man with an ice-cold .679, 39
points below Bill Allen, who ended
with a cool .718.
