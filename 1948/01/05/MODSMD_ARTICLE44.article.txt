# Avoid the Flu
## 
### 
During the past month the population of
Los Angeles was stricken by a mysterious sick
ness resembling influenza but differing from
common flu.
About 2,000 Stanford students are returning
to the campus after spending the vacation in
the LA area.
Putting these two facts together, Dr. George
Houck of the Health Service says that an epi
demic is probable.
In order to prevent any such epidemic from
reaching the campus the Health Service has
gone to great expense to procure a new type
of vaccine which immunizes those who use it.

However, the vaccine does not act immed
iately. Within eight days, however, Dr. Houck
says the vaccine will cause complete immun
ization against flu. Therefore it is much better
to get the shots immediately rather than wait.
The shot has no general ill after effects. The
anti-flu shot will be available to all Stanford
students beginning today at the Health Center.
Dr. Houck and the Public Health Com
mittee strongly urge all students and persons
affiliated with the University to take the shots.
The student body could do well to heed Dr
Houck's advice and make a brief visit to the
Health Service offices sometime today.
