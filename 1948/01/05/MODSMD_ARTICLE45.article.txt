# CAMPUS OPINION

To tlit? Editor:
We fuel that your staff and the student body itself
will be interested in knowing of a very generous
"gift" given our children by one of your own group.
Bob Horton, a student veteran, and his wife, Mar
gie, are wonderful magicians. They dressed up in
elaborate clown costumes, complete with enormous
leet, and performed for our convalescent children for
over Iwo hours one afternoon during Thanksgiving
vacation.
These "Magic Makers" have by far the best act that
we have seen in our many years of finding entertain
ment for our patients. Their young audience was
truly thrilled, and the Hortons went from ward to
ward, bringing their thoughtful Thanksgiving present
lo every bedside.
This couple was unknown to us, and their enter

tainment was unsolicited. They are ncwcomers to this
area, but had heard of the Home and wanted to do
something to contribute to our children's happiness.
We are extremely grateful to them, and their "good
turn" seems to us one more fine example of the gen
erous aid this campus charity receives from your stud
ents in so many ways.
The children have already expressed their appre
ciation to this young couple for so generously giving
their services here, but it occurs to me that an article
in The Daily calling campus attention to the Hor
tons would be richly deserved by the "Magic Makers"
and very interesting to your readers.
Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. A. Pittman Atwood,
Superintendent.
