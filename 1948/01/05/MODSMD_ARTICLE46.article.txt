# Revisions in College Curriculum demanded; Commission Wants Training for Democracy
## 
### 
The strengthening and extension
of democracy as well as education
in international affairs are the
prime functions of colleges in the
United States, according to the first
report of the President's Commis
sion on Higher Education, of which
Stanford's Vice-President Alvin Eu
rich is a member.
This first report calls for sweep
ing changes in higher education
curriculum, administration, and or
ganization to meet the present-day
crisis. The commission has suggest
ed that higher education still re
tains today many of the European
concepts from which the U.S. sys
tem grew, and advocates abandon
ment of many of these concepts for
the strengthening of a system at
tuned to the needs of free citizens
of a democracy.
VITAL FUNCTION
Pointing out the vital function of
the commission, the report says that
' in a real sense the future of our
civilization depends upon the direc
lion education takes, not only in the
distant future but in the days im
mediately ahead." There are fun
damental and irreconcilable differ
ences, the report asserts, between
democratic and authoritarian phi
losophies and the strengthening and
extension of our democratic sys
tem must be the prime responsibil
ity of American higher education.
"Education is an indispensable re
quirement to the realization of the
democratic concept of equal free
dom and equal rights of all citizens.
Higher education must inspire its
graduates with high social aims as
well as endow them with special in
formation and technical skill. Teach
ing and learning must be vested
with public purpose," the report
states.
SERIOUS NEGLECT
Not only is the commission con
cerned with education's responsi
bility to democracy at home, but it
holds that most American colleges

have seriously neglected education
in internationla affairs and for in
ternational co-operation and under
standing.
The report also cautions higher
education and the country at large
that neglect of research in social
sciences can be disastrous, and
urges that social skills be quickly
brought abreast of U.S. skill in nat
ural sciences.
RECOMMENDATIONS LISTED
The commission makes the fol
lowing recommendations:
1. Higher education must act
promptly to reorient its educational
programs and its administration to
the needs of our democracy. This

entails sweeping changes in cur
riculum.
2. College attendance should be
at least double by 1960, necessitat
ing organizational and financial
changes.
3. The rift between education for
work and education for life must be
healed. The American system is to
fit citizens for an adult life which
will combine work with leisure and
participation in the nation's affairs.
4. Free public education should
be extended through the first two
years of college for all youth who
can profit from such education. Tui
tion for the last two years and grad
uate work should be lowered.
5. The quota system which serves
to exclude Jews, Negroes, and oth
ers should be promptly eliminated
in practice as well as in theory.
6. Segregation between Negroes
and whites, which requires dupli
cate schools, is wasteful, and low
ers educational opportunities for
members of both groups, should be
eliminated.
7. Graduate an d professional
school education needs revision to
make it effective in training well
rounded persons instead of only re
search specialists and technicians.
8. The federal government must
expand greatly its support of high
er education through scholarships
and fellowships.
9. Hundreds of community col
leges — similar to present junior
colleges — should be established
throughout the country.
10. Most college curriculums are
too specialized and courses should
be integrated to provide a true gen
eral education.
11. An expanded and imaginative
adult education program is urgently
needed.
12. Federal aid to education must
be distributed so that poorer states
can bring their educational systems
closer to the quality of those of the
wealthier states.

ALVIN EURICII, Stanford Vice-
President, is a member of the
President's Commission on Higher
Education which recently recom
mended sweeping changes in
higher education.
The strengthening and extension
of democracy as well as education
in international affairs are the
prime functions of colleges in the
United States, according to the first
report of the President's Commis
sion on Higher Education, of which
Stanford's Vice-President Alvin Eu
rich is a member.
This first report calls for sweep
ing changes in higher education
curriculum, administration, and or
ganization to meet the present-day
crisis. The commission has suggest
ed that higher education still re
tains today many of the European
concepts from which the U.S. sys
tem grew, and advocates abandon
ment of many of these concepts for
the strengthening of a system at
tuned to the needs of free citizens
of a democracy.
VITAL FUNCTION
Pointing out the vital function of
the commission, the report says that
' in a real sense the future of our
civilization depends upon the direc
lion education takes, not only in the
distant future but in the days im
mediately ahead." There are fun
damental and irreconcilable differ
ences, the report asserts, between
democratic and authoritarian phi
losophies and the strengthening and
extension of our democratic sys
tem must be the prime responsibil
ity of American higher education.
"Education is an indispensable re
quirement to the realization of the
democratic concept of equal free
dom and equal rights of all citizens.
Higher education must inspire its
graduates with high social aims as
well as endow them with special in
formation and technical skill. Teach
ing and learning must be vested
with public purpose," the report
states.
SERIOUS NEGLECT
Not only is the commission con
cerned with education's responsi
bility to democracy at home, but it
holds that most American colleges

have seriously neglected education
in internationla affairs and for in
ternational co-operation and under
standing.
The report also cautions higher
education and the country at large
that neglect of research in social
sciences can be disastrous, and
urges that social skills be quickly
brought abreast of U.S. skill in nat
ural sciences.
RECOMMENDATIONS LISTED
The commission makes the fol
lowing recommendations:
1. Higher education must act
promptly to reorient its educational
programs and its administration to
the needs of our democracy. This

entails sweeping changes in cur
riculum.
2. College attendance should be
at least double by 1960, necessitat
ing organizational and financial
changes.
3. The rift between education for
work and education for life must be
healed. The American system is to
fit citizens for an adult life which
will combine work with leisure and
participation in the nation's affairs.
4. Free public education should
be extended through the first two
years of college for all youth who
can profit from such education. Tui
tion for the last two years and grad
uate work should be lowered.
5. The quota system which serves
to exclude Jews, Negroes, and oth
ers should be promptly eliminated
in practice as well as in theory.
6. Segregation between Negroes
and whites, which requires dupli
cate schools, is wasteful, and low
ers educational opportunities for
members of both groups, should be
eliminated.
7. Graduate an d professional
school education needs revision to
make it effective in training well
rounded persons instead of only re
