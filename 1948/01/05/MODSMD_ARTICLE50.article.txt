# Farm Chapter Discusses NSA Projects for 1948
## 
### 
National Students' Association is I
a national clearinghouse that will j
facilitate student action on student
problems, Dick Heggie, regional
NSA chairman and University of
California NSA leader, told the
Stanford Excom last October. NSA ,
is a non-partisan political organiza
tion, he added.
Excom ratified the NSA constitu
tion on Oct. 30. Since that time
chairman Ginny Titus and her com
mittee have discussed and are in
vestigating several projects for their
year's activity.
Included in these pnfjects are:
A study of the aiins and objec
tives of the University; improve
ment of election procedure and the J
stimulation of interest in elections; I
a study of the possibility of form- J
ing a student-administration forum i
which will act as a liaison body be
tween the two groups; formulation ;
of the local NSA to act as a liaison i
body between Excom and the stu
dents; and bringing speakers to the j
campus to discuss important politi
cal questions and issues.
On the international side of the j
organization the Stanford NSA
heads the Commission on Interna
tional Affairs.
California
Regional NSA headquarters is lo
cated at the University of Califor
nia. California has established sub- j
commissions which deal with stu
dent-faculty relations and curricu- !
lar reform.
California is considering a tour of
Europe under faculty supervision
similar to that recently carried on
by the University of Minnesota.
The university's subcommission
on curricula reform is working for
university adoption of student re- j
action sheets. These are question- j
naires, distributed to the students, j
to poll student opinion of the in
structors, texts, and courses.
UCLA
Since its affiliation with NSA last
Nov. 12, UCLA has made rapid
strides in its organization. UCLA
is the location of the regional sub
commission for audio-visual edu
cation.
The nine University of California
campuses have the largest collection ,
of films of any educational institu
tion in the world. This is the li
brary that the NSA is surveying.
A listing of the pictures available
and the rates charged for their use
will be made from the survey. Then j
these films will be made acces- ;
sible to all member schools in the
region. The film topics include sub- ;
jects on vocational guidance, sports, i
discrimination, and teaching meth- i
ods.
In addition, the NSA committee i
at UCLA has established five cam
pus subcommissions on internation- !
al committees. Sign-ups for NSA
activities have enlisted 320 students
offering to help on these and other
proposed subcommissions.
Some of UCLA's domestic sub
commissions include groups on cur- j
ricula reform, vocational guidance,
preparation for the regional student
government clinics, and a forum j

| committee for conducting open lo
j rums and lectures.
use
USC has not yet joined the NSA,
J but that school is now supporting
| one important program -the Coun
cil on Atomic Implications â€” that
will become an integral part of the
regional NSA International Com
mission.
CAI was organized at USC in
! February. The nucleus was a small
| group of veterans who hud met with
a professor for 10 weeks to study
what they could do to establish
more securely the peace for which
they had fought.
They became so concerned over
the implications of atomic war that
they decided to invite others to join
in an educational campaign. The
response from students and faculty
was enthusiastic and CAI was es
tablished. It has now grown to
more than 120 members, including
several businessmen and other
I community leaders.
At present CAI is engaged in set
ting up a structural organization
! which includes a library, operation
! al data, and research suggestions.
| As soon as possible this important
information will be forwarded to all
of the campuses in this region.
