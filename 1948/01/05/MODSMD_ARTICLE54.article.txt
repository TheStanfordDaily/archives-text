# Two 'Elderly Negroes' Set to Scrap Tonight; 'Old Man' Louis 10-1 Choice to Retain Title
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 4 (UP).â€”
Champion Joe Louis and Chal
lenger Jersey Joe Walcott, two
"elderly" Negroes, will attract
a record Madison Square Car
den gate of approximately $230,-
000 when they meet in the ring's
most unusual fight for the world
heavyweight championship.
Box office men at the 20th Cen
tury Club admitted today that a near
capacity crowd of 18,000 was assured
for this scheduled 15-round bout
between the 33-year-old leather
tossers.
LOUIS 10 TO I
Most bookmakers were offering 10
to 1 that Louis would make his 24th
successful defense of the title Tie
won from Jim Braddock in 1937. A
lew of the most venturesome were
offering as high as 13 to 1.
Only one neutral boxing man and
one sports writer picked Walcott,
the father of six children, to climax
his rags-to-riches rise by wresting
the crown from Louis, one of the
great all-time champions. '"Dumb
Dan' Morgan, old-time manager,
predicted a Walcott victory, as did
Billy Stevens of the New York En
quirer. All other forecasts were for
a Louis triumph in from one to
seven rounds. Bookies were offering
even money that the challenger from
Camden, N.J.. does not answer the
bell for the fifth round.
CIIAMP CONFIDENT
Louis seeming shared this gen
eral confidence in himself, for ear
lier in the week he contracted to sail
for England on Feb. 19 for a series
of exhibitions in London. The trip
would be cancelled if he lost the title.
Though Walcott was given prac
tically no chance of victory, every
one in boxing hoped that the stocky
"Brown Cinrerella Man" could pro- {
vide Louis with enough competition
lor a lew rounds to prevent the bout j
from being a $230,000 fiasco. The I
fight game in New York State al- j
ready is staggering under widespread
criticism and prolonged investiga- .
tions.
Despite his 33 years, Louis ap- j
pea red in peak condition while
training at Pompton Lakes, N.J. Al- j
though slightly heavier than for any i
previous fight. Jolting Joe still dis- '
played his old-time punch and ex- 1
plosiveness. He looked much sharp- \
er than for his last two bouts, with (
Billy Conn and Tami Mauriello in 1
1946.



As if you couldn't guess, the tough looking gent on the left is JOE
LOUIS, world's heavyweight champion. Joe plans to get a little exercise
tonight at Madison Square Garden. The guy on the right? Oh, that is
his opponent, a guy named JOE YVALCOTT.
