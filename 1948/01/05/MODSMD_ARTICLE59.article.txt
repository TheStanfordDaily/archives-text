# Fall Quarter 1947
## 
### 
Fall Quarter, 1947, is nearly over.
But the activities of the student body during
the quarter will leave an imprint on Stanford
students for many years to come.
It was this quarter that the students welcomed
Bill Farrer and Lawrence Grannis on their re
turn from an ASSU-sponsored summer trip to
Europe.
The two travelers gave the Stanford student
a "new slant" on the European educational sit
uation. Their thoughts were gathered together
in the form of recommendations —recommenda-
tions which are now being studied and carried
out by many groups on campus.
The ASSU took an active interest in the Na
tional Students Association. By joining the NSA,

Stanford became a leader in the regional pro
gram of that group.
The Stanford Institute of International Rela
tions sponsored the Western College Con
gress—a well-handled gathering of representa
tives from 40 Western schools.
The student body gloried in the publicity
given a football team which made friends for
the University wherever football is discussed
by virtue of its fighting spirit.
The Fall Relief Drive hit a new high in col
lections. Stanford adopted the University of
Naples and 30 per cent of the money from the
drive was earmarked for that foreign school.
These and other highlights of Fall Quarter,
1947, will affect the University long after the
year 1947 becomes a part of the past.
