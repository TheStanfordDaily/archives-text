So you're looking for a Christmas tree.
So you want a little fire hazard around the house
during the holidays and don't want to pay a dollar
a foot. Don't blame you.
That's why I have eontacted an expert on the ques
tion of Christmas trees and pass on to you his vital
information on how to get your Christmas tree at no
expense.
First, get an axe, hatchet or other sharp object—no
c'oeds please. Sling it over your shoulder.
Start walking, preferably north till you come to the
first Christmas tree. Always allow plenty of time to
get back for Christmas. If you happen to live in the
south pole we suggest you start about August.
After you find a well formed one—no coeds please,
raise your axe, grunt like hell and swing the blade
at the base of the tree. If a cut resembling grand
canyon appears in your shoe, and blood oozes forth
you know you missed the tree. Try again until you
hit the tree or chop your fool foot off.
After the tree is down, pick it up and shoulder it
in such a position as to have all the prickly needles
and the pine pitch run down your back as you jog
along.
As you near home make a point of jabbing people
in the eyes with the tip of the tree.
Once inside call the Doctor to trim your bruises
and contusions.
Having trimmed those you must turn your atten-

tion to the care and feeding of the tree itself. First
turn the room temperature down to 36 degrees. All
right, so you freeze to death, it keeps the tree from
wilting and losing its needles on the oriental rugs.
As long as you've gone to all the trouble of getting
the tree free, there is no point of buying tinsel and
lights to trim the tree. Use candles —they increase the
fire hazard. There are ways to decorate which are as
ingenious as coin slots orjpublic restroom doors.
You can string popcorn, cranberries, or other bits
of food which will help keep the mice from starving
over the holidays. You can use cellophane from old
cigaret packages, tinfoil, or other small useless ob
jects—no coeds please.
Once the tree is decorated your only trouble is to
keep the room from smelling like a forest primeval.
To do this you must open the windows and doors per
iodically. When you do this you run the danger of
letting the mosquitoes in, except that there arc very
few mosquitoes flying around in December, which is
just like a mosquito to fly in during the summer when
you have no snowballs to throw at them.
All of this is irrelevant. Like the man said when he
saw the purple Swede:
"That's a Norse of a different color.
Tlie point is the hell with the tree and the decora
tion. Just have a big Christmas everyone. Season's
greeting from Munk, Sargent, and other distorted
humorists lounging about the Daily office.

you know you missed the tree. Try again until you
hit the tree or chop your fool foot off.
After the tree is down, pick it up and shoulder it
in such a position as to have all the prickly needles
and the pine pitch run down your back as you jog
along.
As you near home make a point of jabbing people
in the eyes with the tip of the tree.
Once inside call the Doctor to trim your bruises
and contusions.
Having trimmed those you must turn your atten-

tion to the care and feeding of the tree itself. First
turn the room temperature down to 36 degrees. All
right, so you freeze to death, it keeps the tree from
wilting and losing its needles on the oriental rugs.
As long as you've gone to all the trouble of getting
the tree free, there is no point of buying tinsel and
lights to trim the tree. Use candles —they increase the
fire hazard. There are ways to decorate which are as
ingenious as coin slots orjpublic restroom doors.
You can string popcorn, cranberries, or other bits
of food which will help keep the mice from starving
over the holidays. You can use cellophane from old
cigaret packages, tinfoil, or other small useless ob
jects—no coeds please.
Once the tree is decorated your only trouble is to
keep the room from smelling like a forest primeval.
To do this you must open the windows and doors per
iodically. When you do this you run the danger of
letting the mosquitoes in, except that there arc very
few mosquitoes flying around in December, which is
just like a mosquito to fly in during the summer when
you have no snowballs to throw at them.
All of this is irrelevant. Like the man said when he
saw the purple Swede:
"That's a Norse of a different color.
Tlie point is the hell with the tree and the decora
tion. Just have a big Christmas everyone. Season's

So you're looking for a Christmas tree.
So you want a little fire hazard around the house
during the holidays and don't want to pay a dollar
a foot. Don't blame you.
That's why I have eontacted an expert on the ques
tion of Christmas trees and pass on to you his vital
information on how to get your Christmas tree at no
expense.
First, get an axe, hatchet or other sharp object—no
c'oeds please. Sling it over your shoulder.
Start walking, preferably north till you come to the
first Christmas tree. Always allow plenty of time to
get back for Christmas. If you happen to live in the
south pole we suggest you start about August.
After you find a well formed one—no coeds please,
raise your axe, grunt like hell and swing the blade
at the base of the tree. If a cut resembling grand
canyon appears in your shoe, and blood oozes forth
you know you missed the tree. Try again until you
hit the tree or chop your fool foot off.
After the tree is down, pick it up and shoulder it
in such a position as to have all the prickly needles
