A political party does not cease to be such when it
calls itself a club. Nor can a repeal of the primary
election laws reduce it to that status.. Hence, in the
State of South Carolina, where three years ago the
primary laws were repealed, the Democratic party
cannot set itself up as an organization of "kindred
souls" that can exclude unwelcome members. It must
admit qualified Negro voters as well as qualified white
voters.
This was the decision handed down a few months
ago by Federal Judge J. Waties Waring holding court
in the city of Charleston—himself a Democrat and a
native of that old Confederate city. Judge Waring de
scribed as "pure sophistry" the assertion that "there
is any material difference in the governance of the
Democratic party in this state prior to, and subse
quent to, 1944."
There has been, of course, no doubt in anybody's
mind as to what the legislators in 1944 aspired to do.
They wanted to get around the Fifteenth Amendment.
In South Carolina, as in other states of the solid South,
a victory in the primaries is final, and to deny a citizen
the right to vote in the primaries is to deny him any
voice in the government.

The case' which I mentioned previously will un
doubtedly be carried to the United States Supreme
Court, where on the basis of recent decisions Judge
Wat ing stands a good chance of being sustained. South
Carolina may have to do what her neighbor Georgia
shows a tendency to do—educate her Negro citizens
and encourage in them a sense of civic responsibility.
It is also interesting to note that Judge Waring, in
another opinion which is also in line with recent
Federal Court decisions, held that South Carolina need
not admit a Negro student to its state law school. If
the state choose not to do so, however, it will have to
provide adequate facilities for Negro students at a
Negro college. If the state fails to set up proper facil
ities for a Negro college of higher learning, then, in
the words of Judge Waring, "the state will furnish
no law school education to any persons of either the
white or Negro races."
This law does not forbid segregation; it forbids dis
crimination. More legislation and court decisions of
this type would go a long way in casting off the chains
and shackles of discrimination and persecution that are
so firmly planted in the soil of the South.

and shackles of discrimination and persecution that are
so firmly planted in the soil of the South.
A political party does not cease to be such when it
calls itself a club. Nor can a repeal of the primary
election laws reduce it to that status.. Hence, in the
State of South Carolina, where three years ago the
primary laws were repealed, the Democratic party
cannot set itself up as an organization of "kindred
souls" that can exclude unwelcome members. It must
admit qualified Negro voters as well as qualified white
voters.
This was the decision handed down a few months
ago by Federal Judge J. Waties Waring holding court
in the city of Charleston—himself a Democrat and a
native of that old Confederate city. Judge Waring de
scribed as "pure sophistry" the assertion that "there
is any material difference in the governance of the
Democratic party in this state prior to, and subse
quent to, 1944."
There has been, of course, no doubt in anybody's
mind as to what the legislators in 1944 aspired to do.
They wanted to get around the Fifteenth Amendment.
In South Carolina, as in other states of the solid South,
a victory in the primaries is final, and to deny a citizen
the right to vote in the primaries is to deny him any
voice in the government.

The case' which I mentioned previously will un
doubtedly be carried to the United States Supreme
Court, where on the basis of recent decisions Judge
Wat ing stands a good chance of being sustained. South
Carolina may have to do what her neighbor Georgia
shows a tendency to do—educate her Negro citizens
and encourage in them a sense of civic responsibility.
It is also interesting to note that Judge Waring, in
another opinion which is also in line with recent
Federal Court decisions, held that South Carolina need
not admit a Negro student to its state law school. If
the state choose not to do so, however, it will have to
provide adequate facilities for Negro students at a
Negro college. If the state fails to set up proper facil
ities for a Negro college of higher learning, then, in
the words of Judge Waring, "the state will furnish
no law school education to any persons of either the
white or Negro races."
This law does not forbid segregation; it forbids dis
crimination. More legislation and court decisions of
this type would go a long way in casting off the chains
and shackles of discrimination and persecution that are
so firmly planted in the soil of the South.
