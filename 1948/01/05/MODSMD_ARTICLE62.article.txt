Rally Com
To the "Editor:
I have long been a critic of Rally Com, but now that
the end of the football season is here, I think credit
should be given to this organization for the fine work
done. It is true that mistakes have been made, but
they have more than made up for them.
Not many people realize the amount of work that
Roes into the cards stunts and rallies. This work in
volves a great deal of time and effort. Rally Com de
serves praise for its work this year, and 1 for one

change my opinion and take oil my hat to Rally Com.

Cheers!
To the Editor:
Three cheers for John F. Leicester 111 s letter.
Rather than worrying what to do with our profits, let's
do away with them and operate the Union at cost.
I too eat there occasionally (not as often as most,
perhaps) and I can appreciate the problem. After all,
my Government checks haven't come yet. either.
