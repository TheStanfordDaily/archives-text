# Miracle Flight Aids Alum Shennanigans
## 
### BOB CATUDIO 
First hand reports of "the greatest
joint Big Game rally" staged in the
Japanese homeland reached campus
yesterday.
Occupation forces of Gen. Doug
las Mac Arthur's command, senti
mental alumni from both California
and Stanford, and a transport crew
of a U.S. Navy Air Transport plane
are interwoven into a friendship pat
tern "miles away from home."
But it is the work of Kazuo Ka
wai, class of '26, and a few enthu
siastic alumni which dominates the
event.
ENTHUSIASM AMISS
"We tried to hold a Big Game rally
last year," Kawai explains in a let
ter to Stanford alumni, "but there
was an unfortunate lack of enthusi
asm in Japan at the time."
In a quiet sector of the Tokyo
Kaikan Bekkan Annex, Kawai and
his associates developed plans to in
vite alumni of both California and
Stanford to a joint Bis Game rally.
Songs, singing, dancing, free cock
tails and food—something the Jap
anese people would not quickly for
get.
It was all arranged except for a
mighty important part of the fes
tivities. There were no records of
Stanford songs in the vicinity, most
of the records having been destroyed
during the war.
SENI) THOSE RECORDS
Hurriedly, a dispatch was sent to
the United States, and a radio ham
operator probably would have drop
ped his ear phones in amazement if
he had heard an urgent plea from
Tokyo:
"Need some records of Stanford
songs for Tokyo Big Game Rally.
Need them pretty bad."
Not wanting to throw a kink into
a good thing, Stanford replied by
sending a small shipment of records
via U.S. Naval NATS in San Fran-

Cisco, preparatory to a hectic flight
across the Pacific.
An Army jeep met the plane at a
landing field near Tokyo and rushed
the records to the Kaikan Bekkan
Annex 90 minutes before the start
of the rally.
BEAR ALUMS GLUM
California supporters, although
lauding the miracle flight, were none
too joyous because their own pre
cious cargo of waxed song and pat
ter arrived one day later.
It was a strange sight in Tokyo
that day!
Raucous chants of "Give 'em the
axe" and of! - key renditions of
something like "flushing deep and
paling" startled the Japanese people
out of their getas.
Unbelievable! Rival alums, Ori
ental and whites, Gl's and civilian
personnel, all knitting a democratic
scarf from strands of tolerance in
what must have made the General's
eyes sparkle*
BIG GAME AFTERMATH
And when the shouting and sing
ing had ebbed away, the Big Game
entered into its 50th struggle.
"Needless to say, as far as this side
of the globe is concerned, the Big
Game—or the Big Race—was a de
cided Stanford victory," Kawai re
ported.
He added:
"To the Japanese alumni of Stan
ford, it was a touching reminder of
days spent on a distant campus."
Night unto night will the Tokyo
area beam with satisfaction, all be
cause of a wax platter, a Stanford
Axe yell, and a miracle flight across
the Pacific.
