## Griswold Advises Greek Ministers 
### 
ATHENS, GREECE, Jan. 5
The Greek government called
42,000 more men to the colors
today to meet the challenge of
a "foreign-helped rebellion."
The new mobilization came
as government artillery and fighter
bombers hammered away at guerrilla
holdouts m the hills north of Konitsa.
The government announced tonight
that the army would be increased by
12,000 men and the National Guard
by 30,000 sixty 500-man battalions
• —to combat the rebels, who Greek
authorities claim are being aided by
Communist-dominated Albania, Bul
garia and Yugoslavia.
The Greek army now numbers
117,000, and the National Guard is
composed of 40 battalions some 20,-
000 men.
INCREASED FORCES
The decision to increase the armed |
forces was reached after Greek go
vernment leaders had conferred with
Dwight P. Griswold, chief of the U.S. i
mission to Greece.
Throughout the day, government
forces were reported attacking with
cannon, rockets and infantry in an i
effort to drive the last guerrillas out
of the rugged hills which ring Ko- j
nitsa.
While mopping-up operations con
tinued at Konitsa, press dispatches
reported that guerrillas armed with
mortars and heavy machine guns
launched an attack yesterday on Ed
cssa, near Fiorina on the Yugoslav
border, about 70 miles northeast of
Konitsa. No casualties were reported.
Simultaneously, War Minister Geo.
Stratos declared in Salonika that
the defeat of the rebels at Konitsa
was positive proof that Gen. Markos
Vafiades could not establish his "Free
Greek" government "in any corner of
Greece."
Viafiades had reportedly sought to
seize Konitsa as a "capital" for his
regime.
WOUNDED DEFENDERS
Ihe first of the wounded defend
ers of Konitsa, 120 men brought out
of the town on muleback because
guerrilla barrages barred the regular
roads, were hailed as heroes as they
rode through Athens on the way to
a base hospital.
Fifty more slightly wounded men
were evacuated from Konitsa yester
day as the government continued the
task of caring for the estimated 400
Greek casualties of the week-long
battle.
A Greek division commander said
that it was difficult to estimate guer
rilla losses, because most wounded
leftists and many of their dead had
been evacuated into Communist-do
minated Albania. •
