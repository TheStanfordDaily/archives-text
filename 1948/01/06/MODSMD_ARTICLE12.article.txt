# NSA to Send Four Students To Convention
## 
### 
Four members of the United
Stales National Students' Associa
tion will travel to Prague next Au
gust to negotiate affiliation on a
provisional basis with the Interna
tional Union of Students, announced
campus chairman Ginny Titus.
One of the principal points of
contention at the Madison, Wis.,
convention last year, affiliation with
lUS is still being debated on many
university campuses because of its
avowed partisan purpose of "fight
ing fascism and extending democ
racy.",
Such affiliation, however, was
considered necessary if American
students are to enjoy international
cultural activities. To avoid endan
gering their non-partisan principle,
NSA's representatives will seek
practically autonomous affiliation
with lUS, Miss Titus said.
Affiliation terms as listed by Miss
Titus will include:
1. NSA will be the sole organiza
tion representing American stu
dents in the lUS.
2. NSA shall have equitable rep
resentation in governing bodies of
the international organization.
3. Affiliation will not be consid
ered an endorsement of previous
lUS decisions.
4. On the national level, the NSA
will have full administrative auton
omy.
5. The United Stales will have
the right to append a minority re
port to decisions which U.S. stu
dents would not be in agreement
with, e.g., political declarations.
Pending such affiliation, which
must be passed at a full congress
and ratified by half the member
colleges, NSA will co-operate in
formally with lUS education and
student exchange, national and in
ternational tours, exchange of stu
dent publications, student relief,
and world-wide sports events.
