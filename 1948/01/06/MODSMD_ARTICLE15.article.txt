# One Thousand Pupils Flock For Flu Shots
## Epidemic Curb Is Doctors' Goal 
### 
Close to 1,000 students re
sponded to the Health Service's
call for flu injections yesterday.
Dr. George Houck, director of
the Health Service, said that
student response was excellent
and that he will be ready to
handle another 1,000 today.
Dr. Houck stressed the fact that
speed is very important. It takes
eight days, he reported, for the im
munity to take effect, and ij. is pos
sible for an injected person to get
influenza before the eight days arc
up. "If enough people are injected,
however," Dr. Houck continued,
'the epidemic will run into a solid
wall of immune people. This will
prevent the dangerous secondary
spread of an epidemic."
The Health Service is using a
new method in these flu injections
which cuts-down reactions to "al
most nothing." The dose of the new
vaccine is only one-tenth the size
of the usual anti-flu injection.
Dr. Houck became alarmed at the
possibilities of a flu epidemic at
Stanford when 2,000 students re
turned from the Los Angeles area,
which had many cases of this type
of flu. Dr. Houck stated, "When a
student gets these anti-flu shots,
he not only helps himself but other
students as well, for he reduces the
possibilities of an epidemic."
