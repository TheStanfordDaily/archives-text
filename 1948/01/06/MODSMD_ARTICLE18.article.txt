# BATTLE OF CLOUDS GOES ON; UTAH THREATENED WITH TAX
## 
### 
RENO, Nev., Jan. 5 (UP).—'The
Reno Chamber of Commerce warned
its Salt Lake City counterpart today
that Utah may get a whopping big
tax bill if the Mormon .state insists
on seeking a federal injunction pro
hibiting Nevada from milking mois
ture from Utah-bound clouds.
The newest salvo in the Battle of
the Clouds befween Nevada and
Utah came from Manager E. H.
Walker- of the Reno chamber. He
warned "Gus"—Gus Backman, his
Salt. Lake City counterpart — that
"we're just as serious here in Ne
vada when we say the water in the
clouds over our heads belongs to
us as you apparently are when you
say you are asking legal advice."
The fuss began after the Reno
chamber tried to make it snow on
the slopes of 10,000-foot Mount Rose
by bombing cumulus clouds with

dry ice pellets. Backman sent Walk
er an indignant telegram warning
that Utah Attorney General Grover
Giles was "considering carefully"
the filing of a federal injunction
preventing Nevada from stealing
water "intended for Utah by na
ture."
Today Walker said, "Gus seems to
be serious. Well, so are we."
"If Utah claims the water in those
clouds belongs to them," he said,
"we'll sec if we can't get the state
of Nevada to send them a .tax bill
—and a whopping big on at that."
Walker explained that airlines arc
taxed for the ground they fly over
in Nevada. Accordingly, he pointed
out, if Utah claims the clouds which
pass over Nevada hold water be
longing to Utah—"then it follows
logically that we can tax 'cm for
the ground the clouds pass over."
