## Farm Singers To Perform In Concerts 
### 
Two appearances with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra will
highlight the University's choral ac
tivities this quarter, announced Mr.
Harold C. Schmidt, associate proÂ»
fessor of music. Singers will also
be picked for the chorus of the
Opera Workshop's spring presenta
tion.
The music department announced
that Pierre Monteux, conductor of
the San Francisco Symphony, re
cently invited Stanford to provide a
chorus for Beethoven's Ninth Sym
phony, known as the Choral Sym
phony. This will be performed in
April in t.he closing concerts of the
season.
This invitation follows the an
nouncement that a 100-voice male
chorus from Stanford will sing in
Liszt's Faust Symphony with the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
in February. This performance will
be conducted by guest conductor
William Steinberg of the Buffalo
Symphony Orchestra. Rehearsal of
the Faust chorus will begin next
week.
A special chorus will be formed
for Benjamin Britten's opera "Peter
Grimes." This will be the leading
presentation of the Opera Work
shop. Because of the difficult choral
problems in this work, the special
chorus will be formed at once, al
though the performance will be in
May.
Directing all choral work will be
Professor Harold Schmidt. Anyone
interested in taking part in this
work should see Mr. Schmidt at the
Knoll this week.
The first chorus rehearsal will be
held Wednesday evening at the
Knoll. Mr. Schmidt plans to or
ganize the quarter's work at this
meeting.
