# Improved Reg System Breaks Time Records
## 7,500 Processed on First Day As New System Given Trial 
### BY LORRY LOKEY 
Stanford's one-day registration program hit the jackpot yeetor
day as clerks handed out an even 7,500 registation hooks to
i'arm men and women by 4 p.m.
Registrar's office said 5,674 men and 1,826 women were pro
cessed in the largest first day registration movement in Stan
ford's history. Campus men will have to cope with a 3.11 ratio

when they seek dates this quarter,
according to present registration
trends.
One year ago registration clerks
processed 7,003 students for the win
ter quarter—s,ls6 men and 1,847
women —in two day's time.
Many late registrations are expect
ed to be filed today to bring the
University enrollment beyond the
8,000-mark to approximately 8,200
students, Assistant Registrar William
W. Armentrout said.
TUITION WINDOWS CLEAR
Even with 1,000 students passing
by the reg windows per hour, he
added, the veterans' tuition section
reported they had no lines formed
at any time. Non-veteran's cash tui
tion line, in addition, reported they
kept their lines down to only three
or tour waiting students per line.
Last quarter's enrollment here at
Stanford totalled 8,208. About the
same number of students will at
tend school both winter and spring
quarters. Armentrout indicated,
however, that next summer's reg
istration may hit a new peak for
summer enrollment.
Students not having to exchange
seat cards found that problem to
be but a memory, he said. A few
new study sections were opened,
but only a relatively small number
of students were affected.
ADVISORS NOT CROWDED
Advisors found they had a fairly
easy day yesterday because of the
extensive preparation made during
last quarter's pre-reg day. Only
students having study list changes
and new students had to call on
their advisors for guidance.
Little difficulty is expected irr
the housing situation, Armentrout
said, because the number of new
students entering the University is
based on how many Old students
do not return.
Yesterday's registration was the
first one-day program to be em
ployed in recent years. Students
registering late must pay a $2 fine.
SUGGESTIONS OFFERED
Many Stanfordites proferred sug
gestions for a more orderly regis
tration line.
Harry Hake and John Dee said
lines would move more rapidly if
several groups of alphabetized books
were moved away from the Admin
istration Building to such areas as
the Memorial Auditorium, Educa
tion Building, Geology Building,
and so on.
Fred Kamphoefner suggested reg
book distribution to the student's
advisors. This would offer the best
decentralization solution when stu
dents registered, he said.
STUDENTS CUT IN
A large number of other students
complained of "crowding-in meth
ods" of large groups of Stanfordites
at the entrance to the Administra
tion Building. They said these stu
dents cut in front of others and
held up the rest of the line.
But Joan Behr praised the Uni
versity's method of breaking down
groups of students alphabetically to
pick up their books at definite
hours. "Once the long line began
moving when I was registering,"
she said, it usually kept going in
stead of moving only a few paces a
minute."

quarters. Armentrout indicated,
however, that next summer's reg
istration may hit a new peak for
summer enrollment.
Students not having to exchange
seat cards found that problem to
be but a memory, he said. A few
new study sections were opened,
but only a relatively small number
of students were affected.
ADVISORS NOT CROWDED
Advisors found they had a fairly
easy day yesterday because of the
extensive preparation made during
last quarter's pre-reg day. Only
students having study list changes
and new students had to call on
their advisors for guidance.
Little difficulty is expected irr
the housing situation, Armentrout
said, because the number of new
students entering the University is
based on how many Old students
do not return.
Yesterday's registration was the
first one-day program to be em
ployed in recent years. Students
registering late must pay a $2 fine.
SUGGESTIONS OFFERED
Many Stanfordites proferred sug
gestions for a more orderly regis
tration line.
Harry Hake and John Dee said
lines would move more rapidly if
several groups of alphabetized books
were moved away from the Admin
istration Building to such areas as
the Memorial Auditorium, Educa
tion Building, Geology Building,
and so on.
Fred Kamphoefner suggested reg
book distribution to the student's
advisors. This would offer the best
decentralization solution when stu
dents registered, he said.
STUDENTS CUT IN
A large number of other students
complained of "crowding-in meth
ods" of large groups of Stanfordites
at the entrance to the Administra
tion Building. They said these stu
dents cut in front of others and
held up the rest of the line.
But Joan Behr praised the Uni
versity's method of breaking down
groups of students alphabetically to
pick up their books at definite
hours. "Once the long line began
moving when I was registering,"
she said, it usually kept going in
stead of moving only a few paces a
minute."
Stanford's one-day registration program hit the jackpot yeetor
day as clerks handed out an even 7,500 registation hooks to
i'arm men and women by 4 p.m.
Registrar's office said 5,674 men and 1,826 women were pro
cessed in the largest first day registration movement in Stan
ford's history. Campus men will have to cope with a 3.11 ratio

when they seek dates this quarter,
according to present registration
trends.
One year ago registration clerks
processed 7,003 students for the win
ter quarter—s,ls6 men and 1,847
women —in two day's time.
Many late registrations are expect
ed to be filed today to bring the
University enrollment beyond the
8,000-mark to approximately 8,200
students, Assistant Registrar William
W. Armentrout said.
TUITION WINDOWS CLEAR
Even with 1,000 students passing
by the reg windows per hour, he
added, the veterans' tuition section
reported they had no lines formed
at any time. Non-veteran's cash tui
tion line, in addition, reported they
kept their lines down to only three
or tour waiting students per line.
Last quarter's enrollment here at
Stanford totalled 8,208. About the
same number of students will at
tend school both winter and spring
quarters. Armentrout indicated,
however, that next summer's reg
istration may hit a new peak for
summer enrollment.
