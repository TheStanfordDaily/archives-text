# French Assembly Approves New 'Soak-the-Rich' Tax Bill
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 5 (UP) —The Assembly approved Premier Robert
Schuman's $1,050,000,000 "soak-the-rich" lax bill today after he
had won five close confidence votes in a show-down with both
the extreme left and right. The final vote of approval for the
bill was 315 to 268. •
As uncompromising with the Assembly as he had been with

the Communists in smashing their
national strike movement a month
ago, Schuman gave the deputies the
alternative of accepting his tax bill
without amendments or throwing
him out of office.
He won the confidence votes by
majorities of from 39 to 33 votes.
These victories killed a series <>l
amendments which would have
raised the tax exemption of busi
nessmen, shopkeepers, farmers and
persons who suffered property dam
age during the war.
Schuman said these amendments
would cripple the bill which is
aimed at balancing the budget,
halting inflation and raising recon
struction funds for 1948.
Communists, Gaullists, and ex
treme Right-wing deputies, their
eyes apparently on the national elec
tion. which is callable any time al
ter June, voted against Schuman.
He was backed by his own Popular
Republicans, the Socialists, Radical
Socialists and some independent Re
publicans.
Schuman received from 30(5 to 308
votes on each ballot, showing he
had lost some support since Nov.
28 when 322 deputies hacked his
tough military measures against
Communist-led strikes.
By his strong stand, Schuman got
the program approved without los
ing one franc of its potential in
come. The bill will be sent to the
second legislative chamber, the
Council of the Republic, tomorrow,
where little opposition is expected.
II then is to he returned to the As
sembly for a second reading..
Schuman called for votes of con
fidence after a two-hour debate in
which Communist Spokesman Jac
ques Duclos said his party would
vote "against big businessmen of
New York and their friends here."
Other opposition leaders, measuring
their phrases carefully, apparently
were bidding for business and farm
er votes in the next elections.

Schuman called for votes of con
fidence after a two-hour debate in
which Communist Spokesman Jac
