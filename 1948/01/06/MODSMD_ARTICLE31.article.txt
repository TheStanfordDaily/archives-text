## James Roosevelt Called 'Possible' As VP Candidate 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 5 (UP).
Democratic leaders tonight offered
the name of James Roosevelt as a
"possible" candidate for Vice-Presi
dent.
Sen. J. Howard McGrath of
Rhode Island, national Democratic
chairman, admitted that Roosevelt's
name "has been mentioned" along
with several others as a possible
running mate for President Tru
man.
The son of the late President is
California Democratic chairman.
"However, what the Republicans*
do may have a great influence on
our final choice for the Vice-Presi
dential candidate," McGrath said.
He declined to disclose the names
of others under consideration for
the office.
McGrath, here with Democratic
Executive Director Gael Sullivan
for a two-day parlay with state and
local party leaders, offered them a
"formula" designed to produce a
rruman-pledged California delega
tion in IC4B.
McGrath withheld details of the
"formula" until it had been dis
cussed with the state party officials.
Although he declared his visit to
California had "nothing to do" with
the third-party candidacy of Henry
Wallace, other Democratic leaders
pointed out McGrath's announced
objective of achieving unity in the
state would have bearing on the
Wallace campaign.
He said that Edwin Pauley could
be "officially considered out" as na
tional committeeman but declined
to comment on a possible successor.
McGrath said a decision on Pauley's
successor would be made at a
meeting in Oakland Jan. 31 of the
State Executive Committee.
