## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 5 (UP).—
Senate Republican policy makers
promised today to consider Presi
dent Truman's plea for emergency
price control and rationing powers,
but House leaders said the first
showdown in the election - year
Congress will come on a new GOP
drive to cut income taxes.
Congress convenes at noon (EST)
tomorrow. Mr. Truman will appear
before a joint session of the Senate
and House at 1:30 p.m. (EST) Wed
nesday to deliver his annual State
of the Union message, which the
White House said he regards as "of
extreme importance."
TOP ISSUES
Taxes, inflation, and the Marshall
Plan for European Recovery lopped
the issues confronting (be lawmak
ers. All three are expected to be
kept alive to confront the voters
when (hey go to the polls Nov. 2
to elect a President, a Vice-Presi
dent. one-third of the Senate, and
an entire House of Representatives.
The President's own position on
taxes probably will be known in
detail by next Monday when he
sends Congress the annual budget
message disclosing the estimated
costs of running the government for
the next fiscal vear.
HIGH ESTIMATES
One administration source in
Congress said that these estimates
may be as high as $41,000,000,000
including proposed spending under
the first 12 months of the Marshall
Plan. Last year's budget originally
totaled $37,!>00,000,()00.
A promise to take up the contro
versial price and rationing provi
sions of Mr. Truman's drastic anti
inflation program came from the
Senate GOP Policy Committee as
it drafted a tentative legislative
schedule that will keep the chamber
hard at work up until the time Con
gress adjourns or recesses fov the
Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia June 21.
But Chairman Robert A. Taft,
Ohio's candidate for the GOP Pres
idential nomination, made it clear
that this promise did not mean that
the President's proposals would be
accepted.
BUSINESS AGENDA
The Senate is expected to make
the Marshall Plan its first order of
business, although a joint Senate-
House line of action may be worked
out later this week at a general
leadership conference to consider
the President's opening message.
House leaders planned to wait
and hear Mr. Truman Wednesday
before drawing up a work sched
ule. They want to know whether he
has changed any of his views since
last year on many issues besides
taxes, inflation, and the Marshall
Plan.
