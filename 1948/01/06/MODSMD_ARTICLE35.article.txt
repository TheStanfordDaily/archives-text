Getting Henry Wallace's name on the California ballot as an
independent candidate for President is the first task of the newly
organized California Students-for-Wallace, according to Wyman
Hicks of the University of California, vice-chairman of the group's
executive board.
The organization, which held its initial conference at Berkeley

over the weekend, plans to hold a'
state-wide convention in Los An
gles in March and has corresponded
with representatives from five uni
versities outside of the state con
cerning a national convention ten
tatively scheduled for Chicago in
April.
ORGANIZING CONFERENCE
Thirty-seven students from nine
California colleges, including two
from Stanford, attended the organ
izing conference. The Stanford men
were Kenneth Clarke and Peter
Szego, who were present for only
the first session on Saturday. .
A telegram was sent to Wallace,
telling him that the group had ac
cepted the "challenge to progressive
forces" which he delivered in his
speech in Chicago two weeks ago.
According to Hicks, the Students
for-Wallace organization has been
promised a place in the state coun
cils of. the Independent Political
Party and Democrats-for-Wallace
group.
The new student group will co
operate with these organizations in
circulating petitions to place Wal
lace's name on the ballot.
PC A DELEGATE
In addition, Hicks said, it is plan
ned to send a delegate to the na
tional convention of the Progressive
Citizens of America to be held in
Chicago on Jan. 17.
The delegate will probably be
chosen from the 12-man executive
board which is headed by J. Hart
Walters of the University of Cali
fornia. According to Hicks most
of those attending the Berkeley
conference were active in the PCA
on their respective campuses.


HENRY A. WALLACE is being supported by student groups at Cali
fornia universities in his attempt to form an independent party.
