# Cal Scientist Refutes Legend That Moses Crossed Red Sea

### 
CAIRO, EGYPT. Jan. 5 (UP)â€”
New evidence has been found show
ing that Moses and the Israelites
probably crossed the L;>ke of Reeds,
instead of the Red Sea, in their llight
from Egypt to the Promised Land,
Wendel Philips, leader of a Univers
ity of California expedition, said to
day.
Philips said the common belief that
the fleeing tribes crossed the Red
Sea apparently had been disproved
by members of the expedition, work
ing under William D. Terry. Terry
now is exploring the Sinai Penin
sula, which is across the Gulf of
Suez from Egypt.
'"It is now certain that the sea
or lake of reeds, which the Israelites
are said to have crossed, wasn't the
modern Red Sea at all, but a north
erly body of water, probably the
Lake of Reeds mentioned in Egyp
tian documents from the time of the
Exodus.
"The Biblical sea or Lake of Reeds
has generally been identified with
the Red Sea, to which the name later

was extended. Mapy scholars believ
ed the north end of the Red Sea was
much farther north in Biblical times
than it is today, in which case the
Israelites might have crossed it by
following the itinerary given in the
Book of Exodus.
' This view has now been conclu
sively disproved by an expedition of
the eminent archeologist Prof. W. R.
Albright, of Johns Hopkins Univers
ity, who has just discovered with Dr.
Henry Field, former curator of the
Field Museum in Chicago, a small
ancient fort on the shore line near
Abu Zeneina, south of Suez."
"Archeological remains were dis
covered here by the expedition
which show this settlement was oc
cupied about 1500 B.C. By that
time the shore line was already
about the same as it is today. So it
cannot have been any higher at the
time of Exodus two centuries later."
Albright and Field both are on
the staff of Phillips' expedition.
