## 
### 
If you are a girl and can weep
! well, or a male who can break her
heart without blinking an eyelash,
KSU is looking for you. Stanford's
only radio station is holding tryouts
at 4 p.m. today for its new soap
opera, "Pathway to Passion."
Besides these two familiar parts,
KSU is looking for characters to
fill parts representing other "nor
mal'' persons, plus producers and
soundmen. A position such as this
is an excellent chance for a person
to prepare himself to face the world,
states Phil Pearce, continuity direc
