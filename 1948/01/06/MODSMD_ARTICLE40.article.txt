# Film Tax Deadlock Break Attempted
## 
### 
LONDON. Jan. 5 (UP)â€”Two new
attempts to break the deadlock
over Britain's 75 percent film tax
and the retaliatory United States
ban on shipments of movies to this
country were reported today.
Eric Johnson, president of the
Motion Picture Association of Am
erica, will fly here next month to
discuss the deadlock with Chan
cellor of the Exchequer Sir Staf
ford Cripps, reports said.
Filippo Del Guidiee, producer for
Arthur Rank, sailed for the United
States. He will try to persuade
American producers to accept a
"film for film" barter plan.
Under the barter plan the U.S.
will ship a new American movie
| here for every British film shown
in America. Britain would retain its
75 percent tax, but American pro
! ducers would be entitled to 75
1 percent of the profits of British
! films.
