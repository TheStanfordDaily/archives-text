# Pavilion Has Glass 'Boards'
## 
### 
The glass backboard of basketball
has returned to Stanford.
In 1 ( J21 Stanford adopted a glass
"bank," the first school west of the
Rockies to do so. The material was
of a different type than that used
now and caused the ball to skid
along the surface.
* The spectators could not see
through it either. After one year,
Stanford reverted to the wooden
style that was used in the Pavilion
up lo last quarter.
Now, in line with a Pacific Coast
Conference ruling, all conference
schools have adopted the new '"see
through" glass backboards.
An 18-by-24-inch rectangle is
painted on I lie glass over the basket
to siid in shooting. This is in line
with the conference ruling.
Since ihe last basketball game
here hist quarter, the floor of the
Pavilion has been % refinished and
seems to be in tip-top shape. In
order to keep it so, the athletic
department has been assured that
there will be no dances held in the
Pavilion during basketball season.
