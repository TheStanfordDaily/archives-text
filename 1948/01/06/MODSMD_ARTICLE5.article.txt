MOREHEAD CITY, N.C., Jan. 5
(UP). — Almost 1,000 Marines, in
cluding Pacific war veterans armed
with tanks, guns, and other combat
equipment, sailed for the Mediter
ranean today and a port officer said,
"They didn't take any blanks."
Vice-Adm. Forrest P. Sherman, a
top-level naval strategist and vet
eran of Pacific fighting in World
War 11, today was ordered to take
over command of the U.S. Mediter
ranean fleet now in Italian and Gre
cian waters.
Their mission, accordng to an an
nouncement, was to reinforce war
ship personnel in Italian and Gre
cian waters. But, as waterfront ob
servers could see through the Ma
rines' security cordon, they took
along heavy weapons and other
equipment. They rode to the dock
side in jeeps and trucks.
These observers estimated the
size of the force at 800 to 1,000 men,
and after their reports were circu
lated the 2nd Marine Division head
quarters at Camp Lejeune, N.C., is
sued a brief announcement. It said
a '"small increment" of the second
division had sailed and added that
all hands carried normal Marine
Corps combat equipment.
The Marines sailed aboard the
transports Bexar and Montague, the
latter a cargo carrier which took on
most of the heavy materiel.
