# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
Well, whether you're trying to get a degree or just
looking for a husband, here we all are back at school
again. The vacation was sure a quick one. I barely
had time to return all my presents to the stores for
different shapes, sizes, and colors.
I suppose I'll get poor grades this quarter—l didn't
send any Christmas cards to my professors. I didn't
even send one to the Daily editor, which is no way
to protect your job. The only reason I write this today
is because of my outstanding talent—that combined
with the fact I do his laundry free. Sometimes the
column is good; sometimes it's lousy. Sometimes it's a
combination of the two —it's good and lousy.
Well, anyway, it was a good vacation, expensive,
but good. The Chinese have a custom of clearing all
their old debts at the beginning of the New Year. Of
course, they don't celebrate the Christian Christmas
the week before. Christmas comes, but once a year
is enough. Pardon me for sounding pedantic, but I've

wondered if in celebrating Christmas the religion of
the past isn't lost in the commercialism of the present.
At any rate the joy of the moment is lost in the bills
of the future.
And I went to a big New Year's Eve party. At 12
midnight we all stopped dancing, turned off the phono
graph. and yelled "Happy Petrillo!" or don't you
read the papers? %
Anyway, I'm glad to be back at school, at the
courtesy of the three professors I had last quarter. I
see that of the total number of students who gradu
ated last quarter, 95 per cent of them were named
Connell. (If you weren't here last quarter don't worry
about that one.)
I'm growing old in this school, and graduation is
still as far away as a USC touchdown. Even the reg
istration lines seemed shorter yesterday, which is sure
proof that I'm getting used to them.
Well, gang, back to the grind, eh?
