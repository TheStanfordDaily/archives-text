Universal military training again appears to be a
major political issue as the new Congress convenes.
I found the regimentation of Navy life as distasteful
as any GI. but I am constrained at this time to endorse
UMT with the utmost vigor. Its prompt enactment
would have a salutary effect on our foreign policy—a
factor which many have overlooked.
The President's Advisory Commission on UMT is
sued a report last June, and it set forth the reasons
why it is imperative that we guard against the light
ning war of the future. The most impelling considera
tion seems to be that if we are sufficiently self-disci
plined to undertake what is admittedly a hard and
unpleasant task — peacetime military training — we
shall be serving notice on the potentially disruptive
forces in the world that the strength of the United
States is a living reality, not a bunch of feeble state
ments.
This measure, judging from the comments that
have come from the Congressional membership, will
nut be greeted with rousing cheers when it finally
reaches the floors of the two houses. It will not be
popular with those Americans who are indifferent to

the sharp exigencies of the current world picture, or
with those who regard any form of military training
not as a civic duty but as a distasteful interlude in
their private lives.
The necessity of the moment, however, makes such
thinking obsolete and treacherous. There will be no
genuine safety for the United States without contin
ued preparedness. I do not have reference to an armed
peace, but to a peace buttressed by strength.
The American heritage and tradition have long
been invoked in resistance to peacetime conscription
and military service. The day when it was possible
for us to indulge in that luxurious indifference to the
facts of global life has passed. We must revise our
thinking. The military developments of the last dec
ade have definitely proven the need for this prerequi
site of continued national survival.
In an uncertain world, in times that demonstrate
the wisdom of the axiom that "only the strong can
be free," we must adhere to those policies that offer us
the best hope of national survival within a framework
of continued co-operation with the new, growing
world organization.
