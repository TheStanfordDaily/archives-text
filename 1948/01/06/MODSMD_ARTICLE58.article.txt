# BEST WORLD?
## Debaters Will Seek Utopia Tomorrow at Cubberley Hall 
### 
Following traditions developed at Oxford University, the Stanford
Debating Society will hold an "unusual debate" tomorrow night at 7:30,
in room 35, Cubberley Building, on the question, "Resolved that this is
the best of all possible worlds," Dr. Leland Chapin, debate coach, an
nounced yesterday.
Townsend Brown, Freshman, will take the affirmative, and Forden

Athern, Sophomore, the negative.
Members of the society in favor of
the resolution will sit to the right of
the presiding officer and those op
posed will sit to his left.
Dr. Chapin explained that society
members will leave the room for five
minutes at the conclusion of the de
bate before an open discussion period,
and upon their return those whose
opinions on the subject have changed
will move to the opposite table.
Dean of Students Lawrence Kimp
ton, a special guest of the society,
will address the meeting after the
open discussion is concluded. Dean
Kimpton represented Stanford at a
debate in 1929 between Stanford and
Oxford at which the same question
was discussed.
The presiding officer James For
lick, winner of the Joffre debate in
1943, has recently been selected as
one of the two Rhodes Scholars from
Stanford.
Robert Menzel, debate manager, is
assisting Dr. Chapin in making ar
rangements for the debate.


DIl. LELAND T. CHAPIN, asso
ciate professor of speech and dra

style" debate tomorrow night.
