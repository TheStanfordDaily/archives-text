# NLRB Asks Charge 'Spell'

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP).â€”
A National Labor Relations Board
trial examiner today ordered Rob
ert N. Denham, the board's general
counsel, to spell out his charge that
the International Typographical Un
ion (AFL) had violated the Taft-
Hartley Law.
The ruling, by Arthur LefT. fa
vored the ITU in its dispute with
the American Newspaper Publish
ers' Association and its 400 - odd
members which stems from the un
ion's attempt to by-pass the new
labor act.
It removed the last legal obstacle
to a resumption of board hearings
on Denham's "unfair labor charges,"
filed at the association's request, and
further testimony will be taken in
Chicago, beginning on Wednesday.
The policy has met with stiff op
position from newspapers across the
nation and union members have
been on strike against six Chicago
newspapers since last Nov. 25 be
cause the papers balked at accept
ing their "terms" of employment.
LefT, in granting the major points
raised in a lengthy union petition,
ordered Denham to furnish the un
ion in writing a "more particular
ized statement" of its alleged vio
lations, citing specific cases and
dates.
The counsel's original complaint
last November accused the union of
refusing to bargain and of attempt
ing to coerce the association and
member newspapers in the choice
of their bargaining representative.
It also charged the unions with en
couraging "slowdowns" and engag
ing in "feather-bedding" practices.
