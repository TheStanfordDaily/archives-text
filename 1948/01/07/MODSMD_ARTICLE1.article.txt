# Marshall Plan Hits Major Snag in House; Herter Demands Priority for Own Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP)—
The Marshall plan for European
reconstruction ran into priority
trouble in the House today al
most as soon as Congress began
its new session, despite admin
istration pleas for quick action to
net it into operation by April 1.
Ivcp. Christian A. Ilerter, R.,
Mass., raised the first barrier, ap
parently with thie backing of some
republican House leaders.
FOREIGN AID
Herter demanded that his own for
eign aid legislation be given at least
equal status with the Marshall plan
on the agenda of the House Foreign
Affairs committee.
"My bill carries out all that the
Marshall plan has in mind and
more," he told the United Press,
pointing out that his measure would
provide long-range economic assist
ance to Far Eastern countries, Ger
many, and Austria as well as the 16
Western European states covered by
the Marshall plan.
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
Herter was chairman of a special
House committee which went over
seas last summer to study foreign
relief and reconstruction problems.

The legislation he drafted as a re
sult of that study has been endorsed
by top GOP members of the House
who want it given first consideration
by the Foreign Affairs committee.

His measure would set up an in
dependent government corporation
with broad powers to administer and
develop foreign aid programs.
Herter took sharp exception to the
statement by Chairman Charles A.
Eaton, R., N.J., of the foreign af
fairs committee that his measure
would be considered in connection
with the Marshall plan.
SEPARATE PLAN
He agreed that the two • bills
should be taken up at the same time
but insisted that his bill should be
considered as a separate plan and
not as one designed to fit into the
state department proposals.
He asserted that Eaton's commit
tee already had consented to take
up his measure first, and pointed
out that since the Marshall plan leg
islation is still in the preliminary
stage, his is the only bill before the
committee.
But Eaton formally introduced the
administration bill today. In addi
tion to eliminating the $17,000,000,-
000 long-range cost of the plan, as
agreed to by the administration yes
terday, the measure would author
ize the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration to advance $500,000,000 to
get the program under way before
an appropriation bill is passed.

on the agenda of the House Foreign
Affairs committee.
"My bill carries out all that the
Marshall plan has in mind and
more," he told the United Press,
pointing out that his measure would
provide long-range economic assist
ance to Far Eastern countries, Ger
many, and Austria as well as the 16
Western European states covered by
the Marshall plan.
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
Herter was chairman of a special
House committee which went over
seas last summer to study foreign
relief and reconstruction problems.

The legislation he drafted as a re
sult of that study has been endorsed
by top GOP members of the House
who want it given first consideration
by the Foreign Affairs committee.

His measure would set up an in
dependent government corporation
with broad powers to administer and
develop foreign aid programs.
Herter took sharp exception to the
statement by Chairman Charles A.
Eaton, R., N.J., of the foreign af
fairs committee that his measure
would be considered in connection
with the Marshall plan.
SEPARATE PLAN
He agreed that the two • bills
should be taken up at the same time
but insisted that his bill should be
considered as a separate plan and
not as one designed to fit into the
state department proposals.
He asserted that Eaton's commit
tee already had consented to take
up his measure first, and pointed
out that since the Marshall plan leg
islation is still in the preliminary
stage, his is the only bill before the
committee.
But Eaton formally introduced the
administration bill today. In addi
tion to eliminating the $17,000,000,-
000 long-range cost of the plan, as
agreed to by the administration yes
terday, the measure would author
ize the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration to advance $500,000,000 to
get the program under way before
an appropriation bill is passed.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP)—
The Marshall plan for European
reconstruction ran into priority
trouble in the House today al
most as soon as Congress began
its new session, despite admin
istration pleas for quick action to
net it into operation by April 1.
Ivcp. Christian A. Ilerter, R.,
Mass., raised the first barrier, ap
parently with thie backing of some
republican House leaders.
FOREIGN AID
Herter demanded that his own for
eign aid legislation be given at least
equal status with the Marshall plan
on the agenda of the House Foreign
Affairs committee.
"My bill carries out all that the
Marshall plan has in mind and
more," he told the United Press,
pointing out that his measure would
provide long-range economic assist
ance to Far Eastern countries, Ger
many, and Austria as well as the 16
