SKYWAY TO HIGHWAYâ€”This is not a crash landing, but actually is a gas station made with a real B-17.
Art Lacy, owner, who was a pilot when the war ended, bought the ship from the WAA and mounted it as
a kind of canopy for his filling station near Milwaukie, Ore. The plane is completely equipped except for
guns and homlisight, and tourists can walk through it for inspection.
