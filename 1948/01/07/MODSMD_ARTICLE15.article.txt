Invaluable advertising and busi
ness experience can be obtained by
working on the Daily business staff,
which desperately needs new mem
bers, according to John Pool, busi
ness manager.
The business staff offers expe
rience in business administration
which is practical and almost un
obtainable elsewhere. The staff
handles the entire financial end of
The Dai.ly and is responsible for
gelling the paper out every day.
After a year's work responsible
positions wilh salary are obtainable,
but each position offers valuable
business contacts in the field of ad
vertising and business after gradu
ation.
No previous experience is neces
sary, only a desire to take advan
tage of the opportunities offered in
oflicc work and advertising layouts.
