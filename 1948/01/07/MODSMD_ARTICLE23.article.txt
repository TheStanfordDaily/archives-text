# Reg Crowd Fails To Materialize
## Autumn Attendance Record Unequaled by Winter Totals 
### 
That expected rush to the registration windows by late students
did not materialize yesterday, according to the latest figures re
leased by the Registrar's Office.
Only 266 students signed in yesterday to bring the Farm's
winter population to 7,776 —5,879 men and 1,887 women. Tho

ratio still stands at 3.11. 4
FIGURE DROP
With present registration totals
far below last quarter's 8.208 stud
ents, it appears that no attendance
records will be broken. Yesterday's
registration total, however, still
stands well above last winter's en
rollment of 7,00!J students.
On the financial side of the regis
tration picture, an "emergency staff"'
of nine cashiers and office clerks
gathered in $400,000 in tuition pay
ments by non-veterans Monday and
yesterday. Part-time helpers—wives
of Farm student-veterans—made up
part of the clerical staff.
COLLECTION TRIPS
Bank messengers made 23 collec
tion trips to the Farm during the
two days' before all $400,000 was
transferred to Palo Alto. Only 69
cents was unaccounted for during
the two days' transactions, Chief
Accounting Officer Duncan I. Mc-
Fadden reported.
Students registering late will have
to pay at least a $2 fine. Several
to pay at least a $2 fine. One stu
dent paid $8 too much in tuition and
the money was refunded to him
after the clerks went over their
books.
