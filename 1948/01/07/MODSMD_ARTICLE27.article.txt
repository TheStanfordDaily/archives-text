# Flu Wave Strikes Campus; Vaccine Given Students
## 
### 
The first cases of influenza hit the
Stanford campus today when 10
students were hospitalized and the
emergency infirmary in the Village
was opened for the first time.
Dr. George Houck, director of the*
Health Service, said that this is the
expected primary stage of student:;
who brought the disease with them
and that he is continuing his immu
nization fight to prevent secondary
spread and an epidemic.
One-fourth of the school has
already been immunized by the
Health Service, yesterday ending
with a total. "If I could hoobt
that to one-half the University,"
reported Dr. Houck, "then I'd really
have something."
SUDDEN SURGE
The sudden surge of influenza pa
tients filled the Women's Rest Home
at 2 p.m. yesterday. Nine women
are now in the Rest Home with thi:;
disease. The Home's isolation ward
is being kept vacant in case of an
emergency.
The emergency infirmary in the
Stanford Village was opened for the
first time yesterday at p.m. to
handle new flu cases that are ex
pected to arise. This infirmary wa:.
built a year and a half ago in case
of an emergency. The Village in
firmary will be operated by the
Palo Alio Hospital.
ASTH MA QUESTION
Many students getting auti flu
shots wondered over the doctor'.;
question about asthma. Dr. Houck
| stated that only very severe case:,
j of asthma with an egg allergy do
i not get the injections. Those with
mild asthma get a different injec
tion. Dr. Houck floes not want any
one to stay away because of this, for
I only five have been turned away
out of the 2,06'!.
No reactions of any sort from
these injections have been reported
to the Health Service. Dr. Houck
attributed this to the small dose
given, the injection of the vaccine
into the skin instead of under the
skin, and the care with which the
injections arc given.
The Health Service lias h'td
j trouble keeping up its supplies to
meet the demands of this immuni
zation program. A new supply of
vaccine arrived just in time yester
day morning, only 10 minutes be
fore the old supply gave out. The
service has enough for today, and a
new shipment is expected tomor
row. Dr. Houck plans to continue
immunizing as many students as
j possible to establish a "solid wall of
| immunity."
