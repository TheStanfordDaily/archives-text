isting laws cover illegal diversion
of water only in river streams, mak
ing no provision for diverting water

seem to give us adequate protection
and it's becoming serious."

sibilities of filing suit in federal
court to enjoin Nevada from "milk
ing" the East-bound clouds by bom-
I aiding them with ice pellets to
obtain snow. Nevadans have, in ef

fect, told Backman to "jump in the
Great Salt Lake."
Backman pointed out that for five
out of the last eight days the wea
therman has predicted "showers or
snow" for Utah.
"But none of that precipitation
has arrived in Utah." he said. Ut;di
presently is basking in springlike
