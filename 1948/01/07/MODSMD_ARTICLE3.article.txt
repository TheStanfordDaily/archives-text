# Reuther Wants CIO Pay Boost
## 
### 
DETROIT, Jan. 6 (UP). â€”Presi-
dent Walter P. Reuther said to
night that his 800,000 CIO United
Auto Workers soon "will demand
and win" a new round of pay in
creases for which the union's rank
and-file has been clamoring.
At the same time, Reuther de
nounced both the Democratic and
Republican parties for "unscrupu
lous political maneuvering" he said
was directly responsible for the
government's failure to curb infla
tion.
NO SPECIFIC INCREASE
Reuther and other top officials of
the UAW wage policy committee,
which met today to pave the way
for an executive board meeting Jan.
J5, declined to comment on the spe
cific increase that would be asked.
But earlier, he was reported to
have been "pleased" with the rising
cry among union members for a 25-
cent hourly wage hike.
The union's GM contract, expir
ing April 28, provides the earliest
date for the UAW to open a wage
drive among the major auto com
panies.
Reuther charged that "both par
ties are playing fast and loose with
the welfare of the American people
in a political chess game whose ob
ject is to see which party can win
more votes on the inflation issue
without doing anything about it."
BLAMES PARTIES
"The Democrats appear more in
terested in reducing Republican
chances in November than reducing
the price of butter in January," he
said.
"And the Republicans have dem
onstrated they are more anxious to
stop being blamed for inflation than
to stop inflation."
"The failure of both government
and industry to stop inflation leaves
labor no choice but to demand and
win further wage increases in order
to restore and maintain the pur
chasing power workers have lost
through skyrocketing prices," Reu
ther said.
