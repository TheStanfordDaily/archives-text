# HE WON'T TALK
## MacArthur Keeps Silent Watch, Refuses to Comment on Candidacy 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 7 ((UP)—Gon. Douglas Mac-Arthur today j
aj'ain refused to comment on his "Wisconsin message" Monday which {
;:omc American observers interpreted as hinting his willingness to accept
a Republican presidential nomination.
Persons close to the Allied Supreme Commander said it was obvious
lli.il he will remain .silent on his presidential aspirations—if he has any

► until the last possible moment.
Wisconsin's Secretary of State,
Fied R. Zimmerman, previously had
claimed that Mac Arthur's message,
congratulating the state upon its
j centennial celebration, "meant he
would perform any public service
I he was called upon by the people
I to perform."
Observers in Japan who have
I studied Mac Arthur's actions and
statements during the past year,
j generally agree he is behaving like
j a man keenly conscious of his own
! presidential possibilities. At the
| same time, however, from both the
tactical point of view and accord
| ing to his own personality, it is be
| lieved Mac Arthur will never put
j himself in the position of actively
j seeking the nomination—thus be
i coming a political target of the ad
i ministration and other candidates.
For this reason, observers said, he
is not expected to show his hand po
litically, letting the interpretations
I fall where they way.
