# Labor Begins Anti-Red Drive
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 6 (UP). —Brit-
ain's labor unions, with member
ships totaling 7,000.000, developed a
snow-balling anti-Communist drive
today as the Labor government pre
pared to map a sweeping campaign
at a cabinet meeting Thursday
against Russian expansionism in
Europe.
Two leftist union leaders, both
Communist - supported, have been
defeated for union office in the last
few days. A purge of the executive
of a third union is believed immi
nent
POLICY BLUEPRINT
The cabinet is to take up Thurs
day a blueprint for a completely re
vised foreign policy as the result of
the break-up in failure of the Big
Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.
Two decisions of first-rate im
portance may be taken soon as the
result of this meeting:
1. The reinforcement of the 5,000
British troops still in Greece to aid
joint United States-British support
of the Greek government against
the Communist guerrillas in the
north.
2. A strong formal statement to
Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria
warning of the danger of any diplo
matic recognition of the Communist
"government" set up by the guer
rillas in the territory they hold.
LATEST PROPOSAL
Well - informed sources reported
also that the Foreign Office even
now was attempting to smoke out
Russia on details of its latest pro
posal in regard to German assets in
Austria.
The question of these assets is
holding up the writing of an Aus
trian treaty. As long as the treaty
remains unwritten Russia is entitled
to keep troops in Hungary and Ro
mania to "protect communications"
to its occupation troops in Austria.
