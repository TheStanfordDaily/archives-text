# Varsity Basketeers Prepare For Southland Excursion
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
With Coach Everett Dean out for the day with a slight touch
of flu, Freshman Coach Jack Dana, aided by Assistant Coaches
Phil Bengtson and John Alltucker, put the varsity basketball team
through its paces yesterday.
The cagers are preparing for the opening of the conference

season this weekend in Los Angeles.
Both Stanford and Cal travel to the
Southland to meet USC and UCLA.
Friday night the Cardinals take on
USC while the Bears tangle with
their UCLA cousins. The next night
the two northern clubs trade op
ponents.
The two doubleheaders should af
ford some indication how the con
ference race will end up. Most ex
perts now see it as a three-team
duel with USC a dark horse.
INDIANS' RECORD BEST
Stanford's early-season won-lost
record is the best, but Cal and UC
LA are not far behind, and they
have both played more games than
the Indians.
The Bears dropped three out of
four on a recent excursion to the
Northwest, but have looked im
pressive entertaining Midwestern
teams on their home court. The
Nibs Price five is led by 6-foot-5
forward Chuck Hanger and Andy
Wolfe, who is playing guard this
year and who seems to have re
gained much of the class which
made him an Ail-American candi
date two years ago.
UCLA has lost only three games
in 11 starts. The Bruins won all
three games they played on an
Eastern invasion. Don Barksdale is
gone, but still around are such good
ballplayers as Johnny Stanich, Dave
Minor, Chuck Clustka, and Dick
West.
TIIOY ALWAYS DANGEROUS
USC has not had such a success
ful practice season as the other
southern division schools. The Tro
jans, however, are always danger
ous, especially when their huge
center, blond Alex Hannum, is at
his best.
In the northern division, Wash
ington looks like the choice at the j
moment. The Huskies scored two
victories over Cal. However, Ore
gon and Oregon State, both of
which were beaten by Stanford, and
Washington State and Idaho will be
close.
Among the independents Santa
Clara and St. Mary's look especially I
strong. Coach Ray Pesco's Broncos j
split even on an Eastern tour, while j
the Gaels, boasting one of the West's |
top forwards in Frankie ' Apples" j
Kudelka, and a new coach with a I
great reputation in Benny Neff, j
have played just six games, being i
whipped only by USC.
Stanford fans had plenty of op
portunity to see the rough and i
ready USF Dons during the Cow j
Palace Christmastime schedule. Ross |
Giudice and Co. seem to be too ]
small to hold their own in really j
first - class competition, although !
they do have a reputation as giant- j
killers.


One of (he leading scorers on last
season's Stanford basketball team,
six - foot - three - inch MORLEY
THOMPSON will start at forward i
for the Indians against USC and !
UCLA this weekend in Los An
geles. Roasting a fine two-handed
jump shot, Morley is .*> hard man
to stiÂ»p when he's "<>n."
