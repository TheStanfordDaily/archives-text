# Boxers to Face SFJC
## 
### 
Stanford's hard-working pugilists
will inaugurate the 1948 boxing
season Jan. 16, when they meet San
Francisco Junior College in a pre-
I season "workout" contest here.
The SFJC match will lead up to
the Indians' first official intercolle
giate bout to be held in the Pavilion
Jan. 23.
Heading the Card boxers will be
two All-University champs, light
weight Elia Long and 165-pounder
Fred Ton Eyek. Long, who fought
I as a heavyweight last season, was
| undefeated in intercollegiate com
petition.
NOVICE TITLISTS NEEDED
But Coach Ray Lunny will have
to call on many of his novice titlists
to bolster the Farm punchers when
j they swing into intercollegiate com
petition. For Ferris Boothe, 155-
j pound All - U champion; Emery
| Mitchell, All - University heavy
weight titleholder; and Ken Osmon,
winner of the 135-pound division
title, have been ruled ineligible.
A near - capacity crowd was on
hand for the All - University and
| Novice tournaments, held in the
Pavilion Dec. 5, which produced a
j series of fast, hard-fought bouts.
Five of the six All-U bouts ended
in decisions. The only knockout
was produced in the heavyweight
j match, where Emery Mitchell, a

| transfer from Fresno State, KO'd
; Bill Brown in the first round.
TEN EYCK WINS
In one of the closer bouts on the
card, Fred Ten Eyck pounded out a
close decision over Erwin Rosa in a
bloody, 165-pound class match.
Ferris Boothe, last year's Univer
sity champion in the 155 - pound
class, retained his crown with a
close decision over Willie Altus.
