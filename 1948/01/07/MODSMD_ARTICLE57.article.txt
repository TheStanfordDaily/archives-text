# BULL SESSION

### AL MUNK 
It's wonderful to be back in school again—it's so
relaxing and restful compared to vacations. Haven't
had a good night's sleep since last dead week; if these
quarters of school didn't break up our vacations and
give us a chance to catch up on rest we'd all soon end
up in the grave prematurely.
But all of school isn't exactly honey, either. You're
hardly out of reg line and already the Health Dept.
is threatening you with that big needle and the flu
shot. It's not bad. they say, just a small square needle
before every date, and you're sure not to catch any
thing like the LA virus or anything.
At last check, the line for the shots reached all the
way up to Lagunita—a good reflection upon Stanford
students who take advantage of* any free shots they
can get! Also they always play safe.
But I still think the only safe precaution against
catching the flu is to keep away wherever large groups
of people assemble, such as large lecture halls, and
also never to drink out of the same bottle with some
one else—drink it all yourself, you get more that way!
Coke, that is.
Maybe it would be better to leave bygones be by
gones, but the Michigan dressing room after the Rose

Bowl game produced several laughs, and one even by
a former Trojan. The USC team had spent the night
before the massacre in Santa Barbara, home of the
famous mission.
While newsmen were trying to gather those elo
quent quotes from Chappuis and Co., this loyal Troy
scribe turned to yours truy and quite seriously claimed
that Michigan had been lucky. Yes sir, said he, very
lucky. Why SC didn't even have their first team out
on the field against Michigan.
A Michigan end, standing close by, turned around
and asked where the first SC team was during the
afternoon.
Oh, said the loyal Trojan, we left them at the
mission to pray for us!
Which might have done more good than where
they were.
But football isn't all they're moaning about in LA
these days. Traffic is all fouled up, and driving about
town is getting something fearful. Some even claim
it'll get worse later in the year.
That's because the State Dept. will tear down all
the "No Left Turn" signs to send to Europe with the
Marshall plan!

town is getting something fearful. Some even claim
it'll get worse later in the year.
That's because the State Dept. will tear down all
the "No Left Turn" signs to send to Europe with the
Marshall plan!
It's wonderful to be back in school again—it's so
relaxing and restful compared to vacations. Haven't
had a good night's sleep since last dead week; if these
quarters of school didn't break up our vacations and
give us a chance to catch up on rest we'd all soon end
up in the grave prematurely.
But all of school isn't exactly honey, either. You're
hardly out of reg line and already the Health Dept.
is threatening you with that big needle and the flu
shot. It's not bad. they say, just a small square needle
before every date, and you're sure not to catch any
thing like the LA virus or anything.
At last check, the line for the shots reached all the
way up to Lagunita—a good reflection upon Stanford
students who take advantage of* any free shots they
can get! Also they always play safe.
But I still think the only safe precaution against
catching the flu is to keep away wherever large groups
of people assemble, such as large lecture halls, and
also never to drink out of the same bottle with some
one else—drink it all yourself, you get more that way!
Coke, that is.
Maybe it would be better to leave bygones be by
gones, but the Michigan dressing room after the Rose

Bowl game produced several laughs, and one even by
a former Trojan. The USC team had spent the night
before the massacre in Santa Barbara, home of the
famous mission.
While newsmen were trying to gather those elo
quent quotes from Chappuis and Co., this loyal Troy
scribe turned to yours truy and quite seriously claimed
that Michigan had been lucky. Yes sir, said he, very
lucky. Why SC didn't even have their first team out
on the field against Michigan.
A Michigan end, standing close by, turned around
and asked where the first SC team was during the
afternoon.
Oh, said the loyal Trojan, we left them at the
mission to pray for us!
Which might have done more good than where
they were.
But football isn't all they're moaning about in LA
these days. Traffic is all fouled up, and driving about
town is getting something fearful. Some even claim
it'll get worse later in the year.
That's because the State Dept. will tear down all
the "No Left Turn" signs to send to Europe with the
Marshall plan!
