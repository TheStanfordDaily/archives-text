### GEORGE BRUNN 
In times of insecurity and despair proposals for
military conscription come to the fore. It is no wonder
that in these days when lasting peace seems little more
than a far-away dream and when Russia apparently
looms as a giant menace such proposals should fall
on willing ears. Against this background, Congress will
lie asked this month to act on UMT.
If passed, all 18-year-olds will have to spend a year
in the army, with an estimated cost to us of at least
2 billion dollars. Is it worth it?
To be worth it, UMT must either help to keep us
out of war or be essential to winning one.
Looking at facts the way they are, not the way we
would like them to be, it is difficult to see how it
could do the former. Peacetime conscription has never
in history prevented war. We are deluding ourselves
if we think it can discourage what we deem Soviet
imperialism. Not only are mass armies of small im
portance in an age of guided missiles, atomic bombs,
and bacteriological warfare, but they will merely goad
Russia into increasing her armaments while continuing
the same policies.
Strength can be matched by strength. The so-called
realists favoring UMT fail to explain how it will be an
effective threat if our large atomic stock-pile is not.
They are kidding nobody but themselves.
Would conscription help us in a war? Christian
Century, a magazine not noted for treacherous or com
munistic views, analyzes the question this way:
"Th< United States has now more than ten million
military trained and experienced men, who would be
available in any crisis which may occur in the next

ten years. Hanson W. Baldwin, military expert for
the N. Y. Times, says that the UMT plan 'is a horse
and-buggy military policy in an atomic and missile
age. It would put millions of quarter-trained bodies
into uniform on any future mobilization day—an army
as helpless to ward off attack upon our cities as the
Polish cavalry was against the German tanks of 1939.
It would provide neither time nor defense and what is
worse, its adoption would only handicap the develop
ment of a realistic military policy'."
"Christian Century" also cites Gen. H. C. Holdridgc
as saying that "mass armies trained under UMT are
useless for foreign wars, but excellent for the sup
pression of the population at home."
It was announced by scientists some time ago and
never denied by officials that we have an atomic gas
capable of destroying all life within a 1000 mile radius.
Three such charges would kill everything in the
United States. There is no reason to assume that Rus
sia cannot develop a similar gas. Even if these reports
are exaggerated, a few dozen A-bombs can achieve the
same result. Where will UMT help? Will it render
soldiers immune against atomic radiation?
The only defense against modern war is to avoid it.
Conscription will, if anything, bring war closer by en
couraging world armament —men have never yet made
guns without soon using them—and by pushing UN
further into the background. Look then at UMT as it
really is—a proposal to waste a year of our youth for
no good reason, a plan that would cost us a tremendous
amount of money which could better be spent else
where, a scheme which would give the military in
creased and dangerous power.
