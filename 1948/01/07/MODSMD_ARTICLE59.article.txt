To The Editor:
May I quietly remind your musical experts that
the words "Clue Elmo" do not happen to signify the
name of an operatic composition, as would seem to be
indicated by your having enclosed them with quo
tation marks in Tuesday's Daily.
Instead, Cloe Elmo is a mezzo-soprano from Italy,
and does indeed appear to be, as you pointed out, "the
new rage of the Metropolitan Opera." A comparatively

recent biographical article by one W. R. Rogers went
on record as saying that Mme. Elmo was "the most
exciting thing that's happened to the 'Met' this fall."
The Italian singer made her New York debut last
October, as a gypsy crone in "II Trovatore," a per
formance which was met generally with enthusiastic
reviews.
I hasten to add, however, that the possible con
fusion over what the devil Cloe Elmo might be is
certainly understandable!
