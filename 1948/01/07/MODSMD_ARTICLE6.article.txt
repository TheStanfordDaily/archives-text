SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. (» (UP).--
Secretary of the Army Kenneth C.
Royal 1 said flatly today that the
United States intends to make
Japan a bulwark "against any other
totalitarian war threats" in the Far
East.
In an unusually frank expression
of top - drawer diplomatic policy,
the Army chief said that America
would never countenance Japan be
coming "prey to non - democratic
ideologies of aggression."
He spoke before the Common
wealth Club of San Francisco,
which in the past has been used as
a sounding board for administration
policies.
Royall left no doubt he meant
Soviet Russia, although lie did not
mention the Soviets by name at any
time in his 2,500-word speech.
Royall said that new world po
litical and economic conditions have
forced the United States to change
its attitude toward the reconstruc
tion and rehabilitation of Japan and
toward the part Japan will play in
the future world of nations.
He implied that he spoke not only
for the Department of the Army but
also for the St.'itc Department.
