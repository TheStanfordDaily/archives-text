### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. (i (UP).â€”
Adm. Chester W. Nimitz .says the
United States lias "absolute" control
of the seas, but he wants a "radar
screen" to protect against another
Pearl Harbor.
fore he retired last month as chief
the Navy today, also called for car
rier-based planes armed with atom
submarines capable of launching
guided missiles.
FULL USE
Nimitz stressed that the United
States must make the fullest pos
sible use of its technological skills
since it would be "relatively" out
manned in any future war involv
ing Central Asia, East A:-ia, or
Western Europe.
Without mentioning Russia by
name, he said neither East Asia nor
Western Europe will be "in a posi
tion to endanger us for decades to
come unless they pass under unified
totalitarian control."
"The earliest warning of enemy
air attack against our vital centers
should be provided by naval air,
surface, and submarine radar pick
ets deployed in the vast ocean
spaces which surround the conti
nent," he wrote.
SURROUNDING SCREEN
"This is Dart of the radar screen
which should surround the conti
nental United States and its posses
sions."
Nimitz warned that in any future
war air attacks might come across
the oceans from Europe and Asia
"as well as across the polar re
gions."
But, he said, it is "improbable"
that bomber fleets will be able to
make two-way trips between con
tinents, even over the polar routes,
for several years to come.
