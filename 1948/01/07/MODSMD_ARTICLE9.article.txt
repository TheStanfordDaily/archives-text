# IT'S BEER, BEER, BEER—
## Rising HCL Strikes Brew Market; Local Pub Owner Keeps Price Level 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 6 (UP).—Whole
sale priccs of butter and a few other
commodities dropped slightly today
but at least one major brewing
company boosted the price of beer
$1 a barrel.
A spokesman for the Joseph
Sehlitz Brewing Company, in the
beer-miiking center of Milwaukee,
announced increases in the whole
sale price of barrel and bottle beer.
Other Milwaukee breweries said
pri-.-e raises were under considera
tion. Another major brewer was re
ported to have boosted prices but
the report was not confirmed.
Under the new schedule, the
Sehlitz spokesman said, bottled beer
was increased 10 cents a case. Half
barrels of beer cost wholesalers 50
cents more. The spokesman said
the increases would not apply at
present to retail dealers.
The increase was attributed to
higher costs of barley, hops, and
labor. The spokesman said barley
had risen .100 per cent, hops about
200 pci cent, and labor about 100
per cent.
A New York brewery said the
price on canned beer only would
be raised 15 cents a carton of 24
next week. Another New York
brewer said he was contemplating
a similar increase. Most New York
brewers raised prices 50 cents to
$1.25 a barrel last September.

In an interview yesterday after
noon at his establishment. Pop Kos
sottii cried out against rumors that
customers would be shelling out
extra pennies for their pints and
quarts of brew.
"I have not raised the price yet;
I will not now," the picnic grounds
manager stated emphatically.
Pop pulled out his reading glasses
and gave serious study to the Unit
ed Press dispatch. "If cases of beer
go up 10 or 20 cents I will not pass
the higher costs on to my custom
ers."
Pop could not, however, promise
"beer as usual" if the priccs sky
rocket above this level.
