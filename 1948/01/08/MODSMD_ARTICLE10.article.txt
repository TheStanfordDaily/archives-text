# 'Card Shuffle' Will Deal Ford
## 
### 
Henry Ford's finest achievement,
a Model "T," will be offered as the
door prize at the junior class "Card
Shuffle" Saturday night in the
Women's Gym, according to Ann
Fraser and Johnny Davis, co-chair
men of the affair.
"This is no ordinary car," Davis
stated. "We guarantee you'll never
find another one just like it."
A FINE FORD
Davis went on to list the car's ad
vantages:
1. Four wheels and a "rebuilt"
motor.
2. New, sparkling two-tone paint
job.
3. Air-conditioned throughout.
4. Air-flow seat.
5. Guaranteed to run.
The "beauty on wheels" will be
given to some lucky couple who
have paid the small $1.65 for an
evening of dancing and merriment,
Miss Fraser said.
MUSIC FROM CAL
"The junior class, however, will
not be held responsible for arrange
ments between the fortunate boy
and girl for co-ownership of the
car," chairman Fraser reiterated.
Tickets for the dance can be pur
chased from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the
ASSU office or in front of the Cellar
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Soft and sweet music will be fur
nished by Bud Stone and nine "112
his fellow University of California
students. "Since Stone played JV
football for Cal, we are sure this
qualifies him as a fine musician,"
Davis said.
