# Truman Asks Income Tax Cut
## President Surprises GOP with Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)—President Truman delivering his
first election-year surprise to the Republican congress, today
proposed immediate tax relief for all individuals and elimination
of about 10,000,000 low-income families from the Federal tax roll:;.
Republican leaders, who have their own tax cut plan jellimj,
quickly accused the President of "political demagoguery" and
said his proposal didn't stand a chance of being approved. Some
influencial Democrats agreed.
The sweeping income tax cut would lop about $3,200,000,000 off the (lo
vernment's annual revenues, and he asked that the loss be made up by a
corresponding increase in corporate tax rates-—with the big corporation
bearing the brunt of the extra burden.
$40 EXEMPTION
The President proposed a $40 tax reduction for each individual taxpayer,
equivalent to raising personal exemptions from $500 to $700, plus another
$40 reduction for each dependent, effective Jan. 1, 1948.
His 5,000-word address laid down the broad framework of a 10-ycar plan
to strengthen the National economy, build up our human and natural re
sources, raise living standards by 50 percent, and secure the basic human
rights of all Americans.

" The President, while voicing con
fidence in a long era of peaceful
prosperity ahead, hammered repeat
edly on the theme that inflation pre
sents a major and continuing threat
to the National welfare.

makers listened in icy silence, punc
tuated by a burst of jeering when he
mentioned his tax-cutting plan and
his desire to keep government spend
ing down.

To Wallace's third party solgan
"Peace and Progress," Mr. Truman

domestic policies arc aimed solely at
achieving "a peaceful and prospcr

basic points of his messages to the
previous Congress, most of which

majority.

vetoed Republican tax bills as "the
wrong kind of tax reduction at the
wrong time, reiterated his convic

the danger of inflation has passed.

message to Congress recommending
"effective federal action" to put an
end to civil rights abuses in various
sections of the country.
