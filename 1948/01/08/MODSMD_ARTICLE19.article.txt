## Marines 'Visible Evidence' Of Trieste Support—Nimitz 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7 (UP)—Adm. Chester W. Nimitz said
today American Marines were sent to the Mediterranean to give
"visible evidence" ol strong support to U. S. troops at Trieste.
In a statement in which he also amplified a Washington an
nouncement that the Navy is developing carriers and carrier-

based planes capable of carrying the
. torn bomb, the retired chief of na
val operations said the Navy wants
In keep its personnel at full strength
in the Mediterranean.
NAVY SHORT-HANDED
The Navy itself is short of men,
he explained at a press conference,
and to bring the complements of its
? 11ijis to full strength has substituted
Marines for Navy personnel.
Nimitz, now special assistant to
the Secretary of the Navy, expanded
on the report released in Washing
ton yesterday in which he predicted
when he retired from active duty
Dec. 15 that the U.S. navy will be
armed with atom bombs in the near
future.
Nimitz did not say that America
actually had any such carrier planes
or carriers in action at the present
time. The Navy, he said, is conduct
ing a "modest building program,"
producing sample vessels which will
lorm the bulk of the future fleet that

will be built if war or defense con
ditions make that necessary.
ATOMIC PLANE
He said flatly that the atomic
bomb carrying Naval plane "is un
der way," implying that it was past
the blueprint stage, possibly al
ready under construction.
Unofficial scientific observers in
Washington had speculated that his
remark could mean that as the A
bomb shrinks in size, carrier planes
ire becoming bigger and more pow
erful.
Two years ago only the B-29 was
officially known to be capable of
carrying the bomb to its target. Since
then, however, the Navy has devel
oped a jet plane that can off
from carriers. It is believed that the
plane would have the power to lift
he bomb and its mechanism from
the carrier deck, providing its bomb
bay was big enough to hold the
bomb's mechanical family.
