Following up last quarter's play
reading revival of the Greek com
edy "Lysistrata," the Stanford
Players have scheduled a reading of
Jean Racinc's neo-classical tragedy
"Phaedra" for Jan. 21 in the Little
Theater.
"Phaedra," according to George E.
Nichols, faculty supervisor of the
reading series, is a retelling of the
Hippolytus legend of Greek mythol
ogy which has received rather in
frequent production in both univer
sity and professional theaters. How
ever, added Nichols, the current
success of Robinson JcfTers' adapta
tion of Euripides' "Medea" is an in
dication of the general appeal of the
ancient stories.
Tickets for "Phaedra," which is
being directed by Nancy McNaught,
will be on sale at the box office on
the night of the performance.
