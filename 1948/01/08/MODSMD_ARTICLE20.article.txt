WASHINGTON. Jan. 7 (UP) â€”The United States has warned Bulgaria
and Yugoslavia that recognition of the rebel regime of Gen. Markos Vaf
(hiades in northern Greece would be an outright violation of United Nations'
principles.
The United States also informed the two Soviet satellite states that it
considers that any recognition of the rebels also would constitute ''open

disregard" of United Nations' assem
bly decisions.
The State Department said the
American viewpoint was "clearly"
expressed to the Bulgarian and Yu
goslav foreign officers earlier this
week by American diplomatic of
ficials in the two countries.
Through its representatives in So
fia and Belgrade, the United States
followed up a statement by Acting
Secretary of State Robert A. Lovett
on Dec. 30 that the recognition of the
rebel government by other countries
"would have serious implications."
The State Department said today
that Ihe Yugoslav and Bulgarian go
vernments were notified that Lo
vett's statement was the "view of the
United States that any recognition
of the Markos Junta would be clear
ly contrary to the principles of the
United Nations' charter, and in the
cases of Greece's northern eighbors

would constitute open disregard of
the recent recommendations of the
United Nations' Assembly."
Diplomatic officials said the texts
of the instructions forwarded to Am
erican Ambassadors in Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia also were being com
municated to American officials in
the Soviet Union, Hungary, Roman
ia, and other European capitals "for
information purposes."
