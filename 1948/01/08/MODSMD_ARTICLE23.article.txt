FRANKFURT, GERMANY, Jan.
7 (UP) — The United States and
Great Britain today handed Ger
man leaders a sweeping proposal
calling for establishment of a Ger
man government, legislature and
central bank in the Western occu
pation zones—leaving Russia's "iron
curtain" Eastern zone isolated.
The proposal, the biggest move
made since the end of the war to get
Germans on their feet, formalized
ihe split between East and West re
sulting from the failure three weeks
i ago of the Big Four Foreign Minis
j ters' conference to agree on a Ger
man peace treaty.
X POINT PROGRAM
Gen. Lucius D. Clay and Gen. Sir
Brian Robertson, the American and
British Commanders-in-chief, pre
sented an eight-point program to the
German Economic Council and the
Ministers President of the eight
| states in their zones at a historic
meeing around a huge oval table at
I American headquarters.
It was emphasized that the pro-
I gram constituted a proposal, not a
| directive. The Germans are to give
I their comments tomorrow.
FIRST GOVERNMENT
If they accept Germany will have
1 its first government—though it cov
ers only the American-British zones
—since the collapse of the Nazis af
ter Adolf Hitler's suicide April 150,
1945.
Frankfurt will become the provi
sional capital of Western Germany
| until the whole country is unified.
Within the next few weeks the
United States and Britain will move
actively to bring the French zone
I into their set-up.
When that has been accomplished
| here will be a central "Trizonia"
j government for 95,800 square miles
lof Germany with a population of
! 15,307.(500.
