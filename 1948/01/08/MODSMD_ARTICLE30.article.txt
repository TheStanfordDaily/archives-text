LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7 (UP).â€”
America must give complete sup
port to scientific research or be
hopelessly outclassed in any future
war, Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul,
president of the University of Cali
fornia, warned tonight.
"Fortunately, such research will
have its brighter side, far more at
tractive than preparation to bring
disaster to our enemies or avoid it
for ourselves. The same atomic and
electrical energy that can destroy
cities and blot out millions of lives
can also provide for the needs of all
humanity on a world scale," the ed
ucator said.
Dr. Wendell Latimer, dean of
chemistry, predicted a "great atom
ic power industry, supplementing
our present resources . . . within
the next two decades."
