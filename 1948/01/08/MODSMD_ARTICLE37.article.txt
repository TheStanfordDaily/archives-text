# NSA Publishes Bulletin to Promote Understanding of School Problems
## 
### 
With the purpose of promoting a
"keener understanding" of inter
\ and intra-sehool interests and prob
lems, the National Students' Asso
ciation Regional Bulletin has made
| its first appearance as an exchange
of information. The second issue
will be out early this quarter.
| Divided as to content into inter
| national and domestic news to con
form to the divisions of the NSA,
the embryo magazine will be a
faithful recording of the growth of
the NSA as an organization.
The first issue is mainly con
! cerned with the activities of two
Northern California campuses—the
University of California and Stan
i ford, with brief reports from USC
i and UCLA.
lIR DESCRIBED
Special reterence is made to the
, Farm in a short description of the
Institute of International Relations.
| Schools which are interested in
1 "any aspects of foreign study and
j travel" are invited to "feel free to
use the facilities of the IIR," result
ing from "over 14 months of ex
tensive and prodigious work."
News of concrete results from
NSA's work is shown in UC's de
scription of the sub-commission on
curricula reform by James L. Bas
table. In an effort to express stu
dent reaction to "seminars, large

classes, and limitations on faculty
and student expression," the sub
commission will attempt to distrib
ute NSA-approved "reaction sheets"
to determine the need for "new spe
cialized courses that are requested."
UNION OF STUDENTS
Affiliation with the controversial
International Union of Students is
explained for the benefit of doubt
ful schools, since the fundamental
principle of NSA is that it will not
enter into partisan politics. How
ever, delegates to the Madison. Wis.,
convention last year were convinced
that the lUS cultural activities
overrode its partisan character.
Published at Berkeley, the bulle
tin is under the co-editorship of
Gene Tighe of Loyola University
(Domestic AfTairs), Alfred Munk of
Stanford (International Affairs), and
Bill Wright of UC. Plans are under
way to secure state advertising,
therefore transforming the bulletin
from its present mimeographed sta
tus to a full magazine publication.

Published at Berkeley, the bulle
tin is under the co-editorship of
Gene Tighe of Loyola University
(Domestic AfTairs), Alfred Munk of
Stanford (International Affairs), and
Bill Wright of UC. Plans are under
