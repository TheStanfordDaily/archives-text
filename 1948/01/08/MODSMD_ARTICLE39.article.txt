LONG LOSING STREAK
Last year the Indians started the
season willi a three straight losing
streak, which included a 12 to 3 loss
to the strong San Francisco Olympic
Club. But they bounced back fast,
and showing marked improvement,
beat the Monlo Ramblers 11 to 3 and
trounced the University Club 22 to 3.
Against the Club, the Indians for
the first time pieced together a good
game, controlling the ball for a ma
jority of the time.
DONS DUMPED
The following week the Cards flat
tened the University of San Fran
cisco Dons to continue their victory
march.
But the Big Game proved to be
disastrous, as California overpower
ed the Indian forwards to pound out
a lopsided win.
Assisting Coach Classen once again
this season is Jim Wylie. Wylie, an
outstanding rugby player in his day,
initially came to America on a tour
ing Australian team which was
meeting the cream of the Ameri
can rugby teams on this continent,'
and stayed, establishing his home on
the Peninsula. Also assisting is
Charlie Doe, former Stanford rugby
captain.
Rugby as a sport was first played
at Stanford in 1906, with California
and Stanford meeting for the Big
Game. This continued through 1014,
at which time the Bears broke off
athletic relations.
PLAY BRONCOS
The Indians then met Santa Clara
in the equivalent of the Big Game
until the first World War stopped in
tercollegiate athletics on the Farm.
The Cards again met California in
a revival of the game of rugby in
1010, and met the Bears yearly until
the sport was dropped in favor of
American football around 1026.
REVIVED IN '34
The game was revived on the Farm
din ing the 1034-35 season by former
Stanford rugby enthusiasts, the Big
Game and other contests being sche
duled since that time.
High point in Stanford rugby par
ticipation came in 1024. when nine
Stanford men were members of the
United States team which won the
Olympic title at Paris by defeating
France 17 to 3.
