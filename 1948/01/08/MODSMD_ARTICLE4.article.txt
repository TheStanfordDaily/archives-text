# Village Brawl? No, Only a Thriller
## 
### 
An urgent call from a Village
boiler room last night called
Policeman Morris B. McCollcy,
armed with pistol and nightstick
and accompanied by two night
clerks, to Building .124 where a
riot had presumably broken loose.
McCollcy and his companions
arrived on the scene prepared to
uphold law and order to the last
ditch, and found only two stu
dious roughs quietly typing. A
radio, reposing in an open win
dow. had been tuned to one of the
more boisterous thrillers, and bad
penetrated the noise of the boiler
room to be mistaken for an intra
huilding brawl.
