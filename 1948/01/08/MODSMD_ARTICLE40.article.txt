# NCAA Plans For Olympics
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UP). â€” |
Shooting for continued United '
States domination of the Olympics,
the NCAA concentrated at its an- \
mini meeting today on various !
phases of the international games j
and moved toward adding baseball
to the Olympic program.
College baseball coaches opened I
the drive for Olympic baseball when
they petitioned the NCAA to assign
their association as agency for ne- j
got iation.
The executive committee also au- J
thorized the boxing committee to j
alter 1f.48 tournament rules to meet
Olympic standards. The boxing
coaches will consider three-minute
instead of two-minute rounds and j
the use of eight-ounce gloves in- j
stead of the normal collegiate 12- j
ounce mittens.
Striving to improve track and j
field chances in the international j
games, the track coaches, headed by
Jim Kelly of Minnesota, announced
that all races at the NCAA meet at
Minneapolis June 18-19 would be
nt metric distances.
The football coaches' rules com- |
mittee met under Lou Little of Co- j
lumbia and suggested two minor j
rules changes, voting down aboli- j
tion of the extra point and pcrmis- ;
sion to run with a fumble.
