## Cards Go South For Two Tilts 
### 
Stanford's cage varsity went
through a comparatively light work
out yesterday afternoon in the final
practice session before the team
heads south to open its Southern Di
vision campaign against USC and
UCLA this coming weekend.
The stress was on defense, and the
varsity was practiced defending
against pivot plays similar to those
employed by Southern California.
Alex Hannum is, as he was last year,
the Trojans' chief offensive threat.
When the big, blond giant is "on,"
the Trojans are usually successful,
for most of their offensive plays op
erate off his position at center.
lIARD-RUNNING BRUINS
The UCLA quintet plays a faster
variety of game than the Trojans,
and many times they employ a press
ing defense, but the Cards have
enough capable substitutes and
should he able to keep pace with the
fast-breaking Bruins.
For the Indians, all of the starting
quintet are in good health. Morley
Thompson's ankles are no longer bo
thering him, and Bill Rose' has re
covered from the pulled leg muscle
which he suffered in the Arkansas
game.
12 MAN SQUAD
The traveling squad of twelve men
will depart for Los Angeles this noon
on the Daylight.
Coach Everett Dean was still laid
up with the flu, and thus absent
from practice. But he will be ready
to make the trip south today with
the squad.
