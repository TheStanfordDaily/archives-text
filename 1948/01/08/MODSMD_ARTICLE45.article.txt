# Ten Lettermen Return for 1948 Swimming Competition; Team Will Travel to Michigan
## 
### 
With but a short month left be
fore their first meet of the season,
Stanford's varsity and freshman
swimmers are beginning to bear
down in their daily Encina Pool
workouts in order to get in shape
for the coming campaign.
Spearheaded by 10 returning var
sity lettermen, over sixty hopefuls
have answered Coach Tom Haynie's
call for swimmers for the 1948 var
sity and fros-h squads. Driven hard
by the youthful Farm mentor, who
assures that all positions on both
squads are still wide open, each of
the candidates is expected to swim
at least a mile a day as well as take
part in time trials, and drills prac
ticing starting and turning.
23 STRAIGHT WINS
When asked how the chances were
standing of his team fattening up
its streak of 23 consecutive dual meet
victories, Haynie said that it is too
early to tell anything definite, as
nearly all the work thus far has been
devoted to conditioning.
But he added that with the large
number of outstanding swimmers
that are out for the squad, this sea

| son's varsity could conceivably be
| even stronger than last year's, which
â–  coasted to the conference crown for
I the second consecutive year.
Such stars as Emmett Cashin, A 1
Weeden, Fred Taioli, Captain Rey
Rule, and Klaas 80l will be hard to
J replace, but with ten returning let
| termen and a wealth of new mater
ial greeting him, Haynie states that
| from all indications the '48 squad
| will be a well balanced one.
BOBBY'S BACK
Leading the sprinters will be Bob
! Anderson, and lettermen Harry Bor
! chers, Warren Cutting, and Woody
1 Hoogs. Anderson, just recently from
Coach March ie Schwartz's football
varsity, is the 194(5 national 50-
frcestyle champ.
The Indians' strength in the dis
tance events will probably center
around Dick Narver, Ralph Sals, and
Jim Armstrong. Jack Weeden, bot
tom half of last season's undefeated
Weeden brother combination, returns
I to share the back-stroke chores.
Pacific Coast Conference breast
| stroke king Don Hester is back to
I lead the Card entries in the 200-yard

breast-stroke and medley relay
events.
DIVING IMPROVED
The diving department should also
| be stronger, with Letterman Louis
Fentnor showing improved form, and
aided by Jim Bradshaw and Win
; Mumby.
The sehedule for this season will
include meets with each of the four
| southern division schools, the Olym
i pic Club, San Jose State, and Fuller-
I ton Junior College. The team will
I also enter the NCAA Championships,
held this year in the home pool of
the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor.
