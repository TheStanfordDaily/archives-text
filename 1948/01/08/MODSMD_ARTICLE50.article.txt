# Rushing 1948
## 
### 
A fraternity is, briefly, a type of living group
of close associations based on fellowship and
common purposes. At Stanford, fortunately, the
rushing process has become an adult pro
cedure.
The rusliee of 1948 is in a far better position
than was his predecessor in 1938 or 1908. First,
he is no longer faced with the prospect of a
sophomorish Hell Week, and secondly, the
postwar period has seen the breaking down
of the artificial Hall-Row split, thus making
possible a more intelligent choice of a living
group.
Stanford's second postwar rushing period

gets under way tonight with lower row open
houses.
In the next four weeks rushees will have
an unprecedented opportunity to become well
acquainted with the Farm's twenty-four fra
ternities and their members. This has been
made opssible through the Autumn Quarter
open houses and an extended regular rush
period.
This also provides men with an opportunity
to compare fraternity life with the Hall living
they have already experienced.
By taking advantage of rushing every rough
can broaden his acquaintance with an impor
tant aspect of Stanford life whether he pledges
or not. —M.D.
