# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
Many years ago when the first pioneers moved out
to Utah and Nevada they found acres of desert land.
Almost immediately they became involved in argu
ments and legal disputes regarding water rights. Does
a property owner having the source of a stream on
his land have the right to dam up that stream? Does
the ownership of the source entitle you to the owner
ship of the entire stream? They argued. They
tussod. 1 guess they even feuded. At any rate they
finally settled things.
They lived in peace and harmony until, in 1947,
some joker in the east dropped some dry ice in a
frozen food locker. Maybe he was looking for a
shorter route to India, but what he got snow.
Life cameramen came in, took a couple of pictures,
and the whole danged process was heralded as the
greatest thing since beer in cans. Everybody was
happy.
Then recently, when they needed some snow on
Ml. Rose, some Nevadans chartered some planes and
started chucking frozen CO2 at the clouds. This
made it snow like hell, made the skiers happy, and
started the fighting for water rights all over again.
Over in Utah they claim they "wuz robbed,"
and that the snow on Mt. Rose was actually a heav
enly shipment eastbound for Utah. This said they,
was "skyway robbery," and constituted a sort of
atmospheric larceny. It's the same water rights battle
started years ago, only on a higher plane.
We'll take it to the State Legislature, said the
Utahans. We'll take it to the Supreme court. We'll
go higher than thatâ€”we'll take it to the Men's Council.
Whose snow is it? Utah says it was pilfered
just as though they had carried it over the state line
shovel by shovel. Nevada got out the lawbooks to
prove the property rights extended from the center

of the earth upward, and there doesn't seem to be
any limit. If they ever get a rocket up to Mars or
Venus it's 10 to 1 that someone will take a celestial
fix, an azimuth, or whatever they take, and find
that one or both of the planets within Los An
geles city limits.
It snow use to argue the technicalities with me.
I don't know a habeas delecti from a corpus man
damus. But it looks to me like the God given right
to the air we breathe is finally going to come under
Government control.
It hardly seems possible that the human being
can take such a relatively simple job of living, and
louse it up so much.
And now Nevada wants to send Utah a bill for
taxes, in retaliation, because aircraft can be taxed for
the land they fly over. More tons of legal documents,
and they haven't dug themselves out from under the
last pile. For example:
A San Francisco ordinance from way back pro
hibits citizens from shooting seals from the back of
streetcars.
In Kansas City its against the law to carry a
concealed weapon of over eight feet in length. Think
that over.
And it wasn't so long ago that a Representative
from Florida initiated a bill to prohibit airplanes with
flush toilets from flying over the state.
Personally I think he's foolish. I was in Florida
and am of the opinion that anything that might hap
pen as a result of flush-toilet airplanes flying over
the state would only improve the landscape.
That statement entitles me to a year's paid up
membership in the California C. of C., and closes
the thought for today.
