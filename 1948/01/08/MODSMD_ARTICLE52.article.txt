Despite all the optimistic statements in the press
and in speeches by business leaders and government
officials that we are not in for a depression, all the
visible signs point to the contrary. A depression is
always preceded by an inflationary period; and we
have the latter, and no mistake about it.
The present deplorable condition cannot be charged
to overproduction but to the inflation now rampant
throughout the country. The inflation was caused
solely by the removal of price ceilings on all but a few
items. Those opposed to the removal warned that
human greed could not be curbed by moral exhor
tations, and that inflation would surely follow; and
it did.
A jump in prices invariably results in a reduction
in demand, and for two reasons: One, it lowers the
purchasing power of the dollar; and the other, buyer
resistance. That is just the effect it has had in the
present instance.
This situation, whether the big businessmen want
to admit it or not, has business scared. The average
merchant orders nothing but his immediate require-

ments. This results in the piling up of inventories
by manufacturers, followed either by a greatly re
duced production or a complete shutdown.
This, in its turn, produces unemployment. Thus
starts the vicious cycle. Unemployment brings on a
reduction of purchasing power and this produces
more unemployment. Then a sudden realization of
the seriousness of the situation by the business world
creates a panic, and then—depression.
There is but one way to avoid the catastrophe,
and that is by the restoration of price regulations.
It must now be admitted, even by its most bitter
enemies, that the OPA. with all its shortcomings,
did keep prices down and curb inflation. The removal
of price regulations was a ghastly and costly error.
It seems that it was just another "noble experiment"
which did not pan out.
The representatives of business and Congress are
responsible for the present situation, and it is up
to them to remedy it. But a word of advice to you,
Congress: it will never be done by begging business
to reduce prices.
