# CAMPUS OPINION
## UMT Archaic 
### 
To The Editor:
I have read Allen B'.etz's "History 1948" in whieh
he finds himself "constrained at this time to endorse
universal military training with the utmost vigor.'
Lest his constraint prove embarrassing, he might find
it helpful to consider certain facts that surely he has
ignored in becoming constrained to his present view
point.
Mr. Bletz bases part of his argument on the belief
that UMT will prepare us for war and make us a
strong nation. May I suggest that our nation was
conceived in the belief of supremacy anil maximum
development of the individual, and that history has
proved that national strength lies, not in the number
of men in uniform, but in the attainment of maximum
development of the individual. The reason that I am
opposed to UMT is that I want to be prepared for
our next war,
Has Mr. Bletz considered that the year our youth
would spend in military training could be spent to
make our nation more strong by permitting these
youth to learn productive skills, to produce goods, to
jtudy how to build atomic bombs and guided missiles,
and to run labor unions, industries and government?
Training youth in military drilling will detain them
from our production force, our research laboratories,
and our educational institutions.
The strength of a nation today lies in its ability
to produce goods, to secure happiness for its people,
loyalty from its people, and to remain ahead of the
world in science and technological advances. UMT
would not only deter the nation's youth from these
ends, but it would channel it into largely useless
(mining in outmoded military methods employed in
the last war.
In an atomic war with guided missiles of super
sonic peed major destruction would probably occur
during the first few weeks of battle. New concepts

of warfare are needed. The next war would seem to
call for such things as a small highly trained profes
sional army in which a private would want to be a
privateâ€”where he may use his intelligence and receive
satisfactory wages. This would be the only type of
military force that could be prepared and ready for
action during the first crucial days of an atomic war.
.... UMT is an archaic method of preparedness to
day. It would weaken the nation, not strengthen it. . . .
