# Bravo

To The Editor:
Fully realizing the name calling consequences, I
would like to say "brave" to George Brunn and his
insight concerning U.M.T. All of us should bpcome
more aware of the full implications of this bill. It calls
for not only the indoctrination of American youth,
but control of industry and labor.
Those favoring militarism are taking the stand
that they are willing to kill people differing with them.
This belief is in effect saying "the end justifies the
means." But they contend they will kill only in self
defense. Who is at fault, the one that provokes the
fight or the one that hits first?
I believe we can prove to the rest of the world
that we have the best way of life by making it really
the best and stop provoking other people. An inferior
ideology cannot overcome a superior one so what do
we fear? It is also a proven fact that an idea cannot
be defeated by killing the man that has it.
There is a positive alternative to war and it is
found in the individual. He must assume the respons
ibility for improving human relations by cooperative
discovery and not try to coerce or brow-beat the
other fellow into accepting his view. The power of
this attitude is not known because people refuse to
try it.
HAL SECREST.
