# TOYON HALL RENOVATED
## Corporation Yard Active During Holidays Repairing Extensive Autumn Quarter Damages 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Carroll Blacker, Superintend
ent of Buildings and Grounds,
announced yesterday that the
Corporation Yard was kept
busy during the Christmas hol
idays repairing the damages
that many of Stanford's living,
establishments had incurred
during the past quarter.
STUDENTS HELP OUT
"We hired about 20 students to
help us out," he said, "and, as usual,
we needed every one of them."
"One job that is worthy of men
tion above the others is that one
done over at Toyon Hall. We com
pletely renovated their social hall
and music room, painting the walls
and sanding the floors in both
cases," the superintendent said.
"We're awfully glad that it's fi
nally done! Those discolored walls
and ugly floor spots were beginning
to get us all down," declared Mrs.
Ora Dale Gillette, resident director
of Toyon.
NEW DRAPES FOR TOYON
Mrs. Gillette mentioned that she
is having the rooms' furniture re
upholstered, and that new sets of
drapes will soon be installed. She
said that Mr. Eldridge T. Spencer,
Stanford's Director of Planning,
worked out the color scheme for the
walls, and that they are now an at
tractive, soft lime-green shade.
Concluding, she said, "The social
hall, which will be used for any
number of activities including stud
ying, dancing, and firesides, is hoped
to be finished, along with the music
room, in a couple of weeks."
