### 
George Baruhal, director of the
Stanford Veterans' Center, issued
an announcement of interest to vet
erans attending the University per
taining to vocational guidance for
veterans which the Center offers.
He announcedftthat all newly reg
istered veterans and those returning

veterans who have not yet taken
advantage of this service may make
appointments with Mrs. Donna Mil
ler in the Veterans' Center which
is located behind the Library. Those
veterans who could not be taken
care of last quarter will have ample
opportunity to be interviewed this
quarter but they must make ap
pointments now.
The guidance process consists of a
j series of interviews with a voca
| tional counselor supplemented by
tests which bring out the veteran's
hobbies and interests. These tests
are then scored and interpreted by
trained psychometrisls and are used
by the counselor as a basis on which
to help the veteran choose his voca
tion.
All veterans, including those who
wish to substantiate their chosen
occupations in their own minds, arc
urged to take advantage of the pro
gram which the Guidance Center
offers.
