# Farm Women Outmanned by 3.11 Ratio As 3-Day Registration Total Hits 7,890
## 
### 
Stanford women still have a 3.11
ratio in their favor according to a
three-day registration total released
by the Registrar's office.
Total registration is not expected
to no much over 8,000 students for
this quarter, Assistant Registrar
William W. Armenlrout said. By
4:30 p.m. yesterday 7,81)0 students—
5,971 men and 1.919 women — had
withdrawn their registration books
through the Administration Build
ing windows—l 24 of them yester
day.
Armenlrout noted that winter
quarter enrollment rarely surpasses

autumn quarter registration. The
classroom population here last
quarter reached 8,208 students.
SNOW DELAYS STUDENTS
Snow and sleet storms cast of the
Mississippi River may be a factor
holding a number of Farm stu
dents from registering the first of
this week, Registrar Donald H.
Winbigler said.
The few hundred registration
books remaining on file will dwindle
Saturday morning when a group of
Bay Area full-time teachers regis
ter for part-time instruction in the
education department. A small
number of registration books will
not be claimed at all by the students
who made last-minute decisions not
to return to the University.
LATE REG FINES
Late registration fines will cost
Stanfordites $4 today. Each subse
quent day will add another dollar to

(lie fine, Armenlrout pointed out,
until the maximum fine of $10 is
reached. Books not turned in the
same day they are checked out will
net the student a $2 fine unless a
legitimate excuse i.s given. Last day
for registration is Jan. 27.
This quarter's pre-registration for
spring quater is tentatively set for
March 2 and 3 for upper division
students and March 4 and 5 for
lower division students.
Change-of-eourse cards arc now
in boxes in front of the registration
windows for students altering their
studies.
