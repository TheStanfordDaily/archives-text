# Huge Crowd Visits Lower Row Houses
## 
### 
In what was generally conceded to be a record-breaking turn
out, an estimated five hundred prospective rushees trekked from
house to house on the Lower Row last night, in the first formal
rushing event this year.
From 7 to 9 p.m., freshmen and other non-fraternity men got

their last looks at the thirteen houses
of the Lower Row until the invita
tional affairs beginning January 15.
An open house period for Upper Row
houses will be held Tuesday night.
INVITATIONAL AFFAIRS
Invitation luncheon and dinner af
fairs are scheduled for Jan. 15, 20,
22, 2G and 28. The Preference dinner
will be held Jan. 30. Formal pledg
ing takes place the following day.
"Last night's turnout was a good
start," commented Jim Welch, newly
elected Interfraternity Council presi
dent. "By scheduling open houses
during both fall and winter quar
ters, and thus lengthening the time
in which rushees have an opportun
ity to become acquainted with fra
ternity men, we hope to make this
year's rushing program a great suc
cess."
IiUSII RULES
Men eligible for rushing under In
terfraternity rules are second quar
ter freshmen, men with less than 90
units who have completed one quar
ter at Stanford, and men with 90 j
units or more. Rushees must be plus.
A complete list of rushing rules,
an outline of the formal rushing pro
gram, and statements from the Pres
ident of the University, and the Pres
ident of the Interfraternity Council
will be published next week in the
Interfraternity Magazine. This mag
azine will be distributed at Encina,
in the Village, and to all the Row
Houses.
