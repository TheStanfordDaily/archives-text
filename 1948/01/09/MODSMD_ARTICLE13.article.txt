(As reviewed by Excom Member

A positive step toward the es
j tablishment of NSA (National Stu
dents' Association) as an integral
j part of Stanford student affairs, was
| taken by Excom Wednesday night
j as it reviewed Ginny Titus' report
on NSA organization.
Excom concurred with the section
j of the report calling for a central
j committee of five to ten members
I to be chosen from the campus at
| large, with the stipulation that not
: more than two persons shall be from
! the same living area.
It was agreed that choosing the
membership at large would elimi
nate the possibility of a person of
lesser ability being chosen purely
because he fills area or class Quali
fications, and also the possibility
that a more qualified person be
eliminated because someone else
j from his class or area has already
j filled the vacancy.
NSA ELECTION PLAN PASSES
Heated objections met the report's
proposal that the NSA chairman be
elected by a campus - wide vote
from a slate of four candidates nom
inated by the central committee. The
fear was expressed that this meth
od might result in an election based
on popularity rather than ability,
and that it would further crowd the
already confusing ballot.
However, a majority overrode
these sentiments and approved the
report's recommendation, expressing
j the view that since the chairman
will represent the entire student
[ body in national and regional ca
j pacity, as does the student body
I president, he should be elected by
I the entire student body.
The question of NSA's relation
ship to the ASSU and Excom re
vealed a discrepancy between Ex
com opinion and the report's rec
ommendations. The report stated
that "a main function of the com
mittee will be to assist Excom."'
However, il was decided that NSA
should aid Excom only when called
upon for committee work, investi
' gation, and clarification of legisla-
I tive matters.
Miss Titus' report concluded with
the statement that by constituting
NSA as a small centralized group,
the requirements of temporary as
well as standing committees can be
met. It was brought out that "this
group does not intend to be NSA.
but rather a committee to decide on

policy matters from which chair
manship is derived.
A vacancy on the Union Board of
Governors, created by the departure
of Dick Bailie, will be filled at (he
next Excom meeting. Excom mem
bers should be contacted by anyone
interested in serving on the board.
CHARTER REVISED
Activities Council presented a
charter change revising the method
of selecting the head yell leader and
assistant yell leaders, which was
approved by Excom and will be
come effective next week.
According to the new system, all
undergraduates are eligible to try
out for the position of head yell
leader during winter and spring
quarters. The tryoutecs shall be
given a course of instruction under
the supervision of the head yell
leader and the Rally Committee,
and the six most promising candi
dates shall be selected by a com
mittee composed of the president of
Cardinals, the head yell leader, the
co - chairmen of Rally Committee,
and the ASSU president.
The head yell leader shall be
elected by the student body from
these six candidates in the regular
spring election. The winning can
didate shall name his assistants
from the five remaining nominees.
Both the head yell leader and the
assistants shall take office immedi
ately and serve for one year.

A positive step toward the es
j tablishment of NSA (National Stu
dents' Association) as an integral
j part of Stanford student affairs, was
| taken by Excom Wednesday night
j as it reviewed Ginny Titus' report
on NSA organization.
Excom concurred with the section
j of the report calling for a central
j committee of five to ten members
I to be chosen from the campus at
| large, with the stipulation that not
: more than two persons shall be from
! the same living area.
It was agreed that choosing the
membership at large would elimi
nate the possibility of a person of
lesser ability being chosen purely
because he fills area or class Quali
fications, and also the possibility
that a more qualified person be
eliminated because someone else
j from his class or area has already
j filled the vacancy.
NSA ELECTION PLAN PASSES
Heated objections met the report's
proposal that the NSA chairman be
elected by a campus - wide vote
from a slate of four candidates nom
inated by the central committee. The
fear was expressed that this meth
od might result in an election based
on popularity rather than ability,
and that it would further crowd the
already confusing ballot.
However, a majority overrode
these sentiments and approved the
report's recommendation, expressing
j the view that since the chairman
will represent the entire student
[ body in national and regional ca
j pacity, as does the student body
I president, he should be elected by
I the entire student body.
The question of NSA's relation
ship to the ASSU and Excom re
vealed a discrepancy between Ex
com opinion and the report's rec
ommendations. The report stated
that "a main function of the com
mittee will be to assist Excom."'
However, il was decided that NSA
should aid Excom only when called
upon for committee work, investi
' gation, and clarification of legisla-
I tive matters.
Miss Titus' report concluded with
the statement that by constituting
NSA as a small centralized group,
the requirements of temporary as
well as standing committees can be
met. It was brought out that "this
group does not intend to be NSA.
but rather a committee to decide on

policy matters from which chair
manship is derived.
A vacancy on the Union Board of
Governors, created by the departure
of Dick Bailie, will be filled at (he
next Excom meeting. Excom mem
bers should be contacted by anyone
interested in serving on the board.
CHARTER REVISED
Activities Council presented a
charter change revising the method
of selecting the head yell leader and
assistant yell leaders, which was
approved by Excom and will be
come effective next week.
According to the new system, all
undergraduates are eligible to try
out for the position of head yell
leader during winter and spring
quarters. The tryoutecs shall be
given a course of instruction under
the supervision of the head yell
leader and the Rally Committee,
and the six most promising candi
dates shall be selected by a com
mittee composed of the president of
Cardinals, the head yell leader, the
co - chairmen of Rally Committee,
and the ASSU president.
