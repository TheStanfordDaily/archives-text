# GOP Assails Prosperity Plan; Marshall Says All or Nothing
## Secretary of State Sees No Room For Compromise on Relief Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) —Secretary of State George C.
Marshall laid his 51-month European recovery plan before Con
gress today on an all-or-nothing basis. He told the lawmakers
either to approve it in full or forget it and start arming the na
tion for World War 111.
An inadequate program would involve a wastage of our

resources with an ineffective result, ♦
he said in a challenging statement |
to the Senate Foreign Relations com- i
mittee.
Marshall was the first witness j
called by the committee at the start |
of public hearings on the European I
aid plan that bears his name, and he
made it clear at the outset that he
j saw no room for major compromise
Specifically, lie asked Congress to
! appropriate by April 1 the $0,800,-
000,000 requested by President Tru
j man to carry the project from that
date until June 30, 1949.
He asked an immediate authoriza
tion of the overall program extend
ing through June 30, 1952, which
would commit the United Sates to*
pour out until that date the food and j
raw materials needed for rcconstruc- j
j tion of the 16 Western European
[ states cooperating in the Marshall j
j Plan.
Emphasizing that the program en
j tails continuing sacrifices by the
j American people, Marshall cstimat
j ed the overall cost would run be
tween $15,100,000,000 and $17,800,-
I 000,000. But he agreed that too many
J uncertainties exist to attempt setting j
a flat price on the full program now.
Neverheless, he warned that the
$6,800,000,000 requested for the first
15 months is a rock-bottom figure,
j not an "asking" figure put out on the
! assumption that Congress would
I cut it.
The former Chief of Staff will put '
J on a repeat performance before the j
! House Foreign Affairs committee
J Monday when that body begins its
| own public hearings on both the
| Marshall Plan and a rival foreign
\ aid scheme proposed by Rep. Chris
j tian A. Herter, R., Mass., with the
I backing of House Republican leaders.
