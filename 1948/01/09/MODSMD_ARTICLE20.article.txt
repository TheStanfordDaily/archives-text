WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) —Congressional Republicans took
a second challenging look at President Truman's 10-year pros
perity blueprint today, and one told the House that the politically
potent program would "drive America into bankruptcy."
Rep. Robert F. Rish, R., Pa., estimated that Mr. Truman's broad

and social retorms plus his iuir
-1 opean recovery plan, would cost $20,-
000,000,000 a year. And lie complain
ed that the Chief Executive had
failed to tell Congress "where we're
i going to get the money."
Former Gov. Harold E. Stassen, of
Minnesota, another avowed GOP
candidate, accused the President of
offering the voters "forty pieces of
silver" in the form of tax cuts ' a:;
a price for their betrayal of their
I own good judgment."
Stassen echoed GOP Congressional
I claims that Mr. Truman's program i.;
inflationary, and eventually would
cost workers twice as much through
high prices and unemployment as
they would gain at the outset.
"It is rather sad that at a moment
I in history when statesmanship above
party is of urgent need in world af
fairs, the President has engaged in
i this type of Henry Wallace politics,"
j he said.
The House met briefly today, giv
ing Republicans a chance to parade
before the microphones with fresh
protests against the President's pro
posal to junk their income tax cut
program in favor of an administra
tion plan to give all taxpayers a $40
"cost of living" credit for themselves
and each dependent.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0., tonight
accused President Truman of mis
leading the country with a 10-year
"Santa Claus" prosperity program
that "would leave about as much
freedom in this country as Stalin's
five-year plan has left in Russia."
"It looks to me like playing poli
tics with your money," he told the
nation in a half-hour broadcast in
which he served blunt notice on he
President that the Republicans in
Congress would go ahead with then
own plans to cut taxes "for good"
and provide broad social reforms
free of Federal interference.
The chairman of the Senate GOP
policy committee and top contender
for the Republican presidential nom
ination said that Mr. Truman's plan
would cost $10,000,000,000 a year at
the outset.
Taft charged that Mr. Truman
"raised all the phosts of the Now
Deal in his State of the Union mes
sage to the opening of the election
year Congress yesterday.
As a substitute for the Truman 10-
year prosperity blueprints, Taft said
the GOP would put through Con
gress a broad program of social leg
islation dealing with health, educa
tion, housing and social security, but
with emphasis on local administra
tion and control.
