# Two Rain-Soaked Towns Offer Surplus to Utah

SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 8 (UP)—
Two rain-soaked West Coast towns
onight offered the "we wuz robbed"
stale of Utah their surplus clouds—
if Utah will provide containers or a
good stiff wind.
Meantime on the Utah-Nevada
"skyway robbery" front, there were
these four other developments:
1. The London Times editorially—
and gravely—advocated nationaliza
lion of moisture-bearing clouds and
vesting their control in "a board of
nebulous planners."
2. At Brewery Gulch, Ariz., Ari
zona Cloud Ropers, Inc., was formed
to rope Nevada and California clouds
and "wrangle them home" to Ari
zona.
3. Central Utah's Carbon county
charged Salt Lake City was trying
to wreck its flourishing dry ice in
dustry by discouraging use of the
ice in the tricky art of snow and
rain making.

4. Nevada told the Times to "mind
its own business."
The inter-state feud started last
weekend when Gus Backman, secre
tary of the Salt Lake City Chamber
of Commerce, accused Ed Walker,
chairman of the Reno Chamber, of
attempting to rob Utah by "milk
ing" east-bound clouds in an attempt
to provide snow for a Nevada ski
meet. A the time, Utah had lots of
snow; Nevada but little.
Walker told Backman to go jump
in a nearby lake named like Utah's
capital city. But the feud didn't stop
there.
The editorial in the Times, Lon
don't most authoritative newspaper,
concluded that "experience suggests
that for the first few years under the
nationalized cloud control plan that
the cost to the taxpayer per um
brella hour may be on the high side,
but it is bound to be worth it in
j the end."
