by instructing students, and faculty,
to aid in interpretation of the code,
and to discuss problems concerning
the code.
This group will supplement the
work of the regular committee,
which is composed of representatives
from Excom, the chairmen of Men's
and Women's Councils, faculty rep
resentatives, and one representative
from The Daily. Each person will be
in charge of a specific phase of the
