What should these be? <Speak
you, my lovely lord)
They be not men. For why? They
have no beards.
They be not boys, which wear such
side-long gowns.
They be not gods, for all their
gallant gloss.
They be no devils, I trow, which
seem so saintish.
What be they? Women? Masking
in men's weeds?
With dutchkin doublets and with
jerkins jagg'd,
With Spanish spangs. and ruffs fet
out of France,
With high-copt hats and feathers
flaunt-a-flaunt?
They be so, sure, even woe to
men indeed.
