# Housing Lack Plagues Farm Veterans, Families
## 
### ELEANOR LAWRENCE 
Housing, 1948, little changed in
! difficulty from former years, will
| continue to revolve around the
fundamental problems of the mar
ried veteran — cooking privileges
and budget—according to Jean Far
-1 ran, housing secretary for the Dean
: of Students.
High on the needed list for mar
| lied students are facilities for coup
les with children and without suf
! fieient points to take up residence
1 in the Village, and residences with
kitchen privileges.
VILLAGE INADEQUATE
With Stanford's high percentage
of married students—out of spring,
1947'5, approximately 7.500 popula
j tion, 2,021 were married and the
1948 figure is above this—the 300
I units in the Village can only begin
to take care of the need.
Under the Village preference
point system, couples gain 10 points
for the first child, five for the sec
ond, and one point for each month
that they are on the wafting list, re
sulting in around 300 with children
J and 200 others now sweating out
I the active list.
COST OF LIVING
Under these conditions, Stanford's
j married couples have taken to trav
! eling as far as San Jose or La Honda
! to answer the mere 157 listings—
| including rooms (with and without
I kitchen privileges), apartments, cot-
J tages, and housing in exchange for
services that have passed through
the housing office's open files since
summer quarter.
The typical battle of the budget
starts with the general high rent
| nnd high cost of living in the Palo
Alto area. Building up savings by
means of a basic $90 monthly in
come with a maximum additional
$150 per month from the wife's sal
ary is further complicated by the
necessary problem of eating out,
which oversteps most family plans.
COUPLES DOUBLE UP
Liquid assets are qufckly convert
| ed into rent, food, insurance, and
transportation, with little left for
entertainment or the New Look.
Since the average rentals in the
j area run to $75 and $100 a month
i for unfurnished residences of any
sort, two or more couples often
j partially solve their immediate
I problems by jointly renting large,
! partially furnished houses.
Organized last October to handle
! all campus housing, the office in
1 Temporary Building C has been
! mainly concerned with allocating
j space to married veterans, as dor
j mitories and other living units are
j kept full at all times.

I units in the Village can only begin
to take care of the need.
Under the Village preference
point system, couples gain 10 points
for the first child, five for the sec

that they are on the wafting list, re

COST OF LIVING
Under these conditions, Stanford's
j married couples have taken to trav
! eling as far as San Jose or La Honda
! to answer the mere 157 listings—
| including rooms (with and without
I kitchen privileges), apartments, cot-
J tages, and housing in exchange for
services that have passed through
the housing office's open files since
summer quarter.
The typical battle of the budget
starts with the general high rent
| nnd high cost of living in the Palo
Alto area. Building up savings by
means of a basic $90 monthly in
come with a maximum additional
$150 per month from the wife's sal
ary is further complicated by the
necessary problem of eating out,
which oversteps most family plans.
COUPLES DOUBLE UP
Liquid assets are qufckly convert
| ed into rent, food, insurance, and
transportation, with little left for
entertainment or the New Look.
Since the average rentals in the
j area run to $75 and $100 a month
i for unfurnished residences of any
sort, two or more couples often
j partially solve their immediate
I problems by jointly renting large,
! partially furnished houses.
Organized last October to handle
! all campus housing, the office in
1 Temporary Building C has been

j mitories and other living units are

Housing, 1948, little changed in

fundamental problems of the mar
ried veteran — cooking privileges
and budget—according to Jean Far
