# PCC Play Opens Tonight
## Card Five To Take On Troy, UCLA 
### 
The 1948 Pacific Coast Con
ference southern division bas
ketball season opens tonight at
Olympic Auditorium in Los An
geles.
In the first game of a double
header, Stanford meets an under
dog (JSC five, with California taking
rjn UCLA in the nightcap. Saturday
night the northern teams trade part
ners. The Trojans tangle with Cal
in the feature, and the Indians and
Bruins meet in the opener.
A 12-man Stanford team, led by
ailing Coach Everett Dean, arrived
in Los Angeles last night aboard the
noon Daylight. The Indians find
themselves in the unenviable posi
tion of favorites in what figures to
be a wide-open conference race.
UCLA, CAL STRONG
Most of the the Cardinals' com
petition is expected to come from Cal
and defending champion UCLA, but
tonight's opponents from Troy can
not he written off lightly. Southern
Cal basketball teams have a habit of
doing better than expected.
Everett Dean plans to stick with
the same five starters who brought
the Indians victories in seven out of
their eight practice season games.
Going at forwards for Stanford
will be Bill Rose, the squad's lead
ing scorer, and Morley Thompson,
left-handed shot-artist who is about
due for a hot night. Rose has appar
ently recovered from the pulled leg
muscle lie suffered in the Arkansas
game.
STEIMIENSON AT CENTER
Bill Stephenson, number one re
bound man and second to Rose in
scoring, will start at center. The two

guards will be Captain Babe Hig
gins and Dave Davidson, who lead
the club's floor game.
Others on the travelling squad in
clude: George Yardley, Milt Iverson,
and Bill Lewis, forwards; Bob Penn,
center; Bcb Lewis, Gus Chavalas,
and Jack Scharfen, guards. Coach
Dean was still recovering from a case
of flu when he boarded the train
yesterday.
On these men rest Stanford's
chances of getting off to a good start
in bringing the Farm its first confer
ence championship since 1942.
GOOD DEFENSE
The Indian cagers established an
enviable defensive record, in this
day of GO and 70 point basketball
games, during their practice season.
Only two teams managed to score
more than 50 points against them.
Their only loss was due not to
being outplayed on the floor, but to
an inability to hit the hoop. There
are not any outstanding natural
shotmakers, a la Johnny Stanich, on
the club, but they are all well
drilled, good ball players. The eve
ning when at least one of them is
not able to make his shots regularly
should be rare.
