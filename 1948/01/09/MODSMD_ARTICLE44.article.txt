# Hannum Leads Trojans; Bruins List 12 Lettermen
## 
### JACK BLOOD CRAYTON JONES 
In the second game of its split
twin bill in LA. this weekend, the
I Indian basketball team takes on the
defending Southern Division cham
pions, UCLA. The Indians earned an
i even break with the Westwooders in
four games last year and the game
! tomorrow night figures to be very
close with the breaks possibly de
| ciding the issue.
Coach Wilbur Johns of the Bruins
I has assembled a veteran team with
j twelve lettermen returning including
! Captain Johnny Stanich, Dick West,
and Davage Minor, half of last year's
Gold Dust Twins.
In addition, Johns has bolstered
! the squad with seven transfer stu
dents and .six members of last year's
Bruin Babes.
STANICII IS BACK
Two-fingered Johnny Stanich
leads the bumper crop of Bruin l'or-
J wards. His long one-handers are
| deadly and he has improved on his
overall floor play as well to rank as
! an All-Coast candidate. His running
J mate is Dick West who is an im
: portant cog in the Uclans' fast break
attack. Riftht behind these two are
Veterans Guy Buccola and Chuck
Clustka.
All Coast Davage Minor returns
at one of the guard spots. At the
other guard spot is Bill Rankin, an
other returning letterman. Ron Pear-
I son and Don Seidel are the number
two duo.
Center is UCLA's problem this
year with big Don Barksdale gone.
To date Johns has alternated George
Stanich, younger brother of Johnny,
Alan Sawyer, and Gene Williams at
the pivot post, with a slight edge to
Stanich. All three are above the 6'3"
; mark and fast.
MNE-TIIREE RECORD
With this array of talent, UCLA
will be a tough hurdle for the Car
dinals to leap. The fast-breaking
Bruins, paved by the long shots of
Johnny Stanich and drive in shots by
Minor and West, have won nine out
of twelve non-conference games
while averaging 55 points per game.
Among their victims have been such
ranking teams as LIU. St. Joseph's,
Cornell, and Santa Clara. The first
three were beaten on the Bruins'
: eastern trip his winter.
In short, to halt Stanich, Minor
j & Co., the Indians will have to be
primed defensively as well as of
j fensively come tomorrow night.

The Trojan cagers who face Stan
ford Friday night in Los Angeles are
rated by most observers as the weak
est team in the Southern Division.
However, the men of Troy have an
expeienced squad, led by center
Alex Hannum, and a competent
coach in Sam Barry, and they could
prove to be the surprise team here
on the coast.
The Trojans started their Eastern
trip in grand style by beating North
western 52 to 4(5, but proceeded to
drop their next four games to Mich
igan, Niagara, La Salle, and Long
Island. However, their unimpressive
showing during the holiday tour can
be attributed in part to the fact that
a flu epidemic hit the squad.
VETERANS ON FIRST TEAM
Bill Sharman, Abe Androff, aftd
Alex Hannum led the scoring on the
Eastern junket. Sharman, Androff,
and Joe White have been holding
down the forward positions. Backing
up 6'6" Hannum at center is Stan
Christie who saw a gread deal of ac
tion during the Eastern trip. At
guards are Fred Bertram and Earl
Wallis with Naslund in reserve.
All these men are returning let
termen with the exception of Wallis.
Newcomer Dick Frey is a capable
replacement who has impressed both
at center and at guard.
KLOPPENBURG DISAPPOINTS
The big disappointment to South
ern California fans has been the fail
ure of Bobby Kloppenburg to regain
the form which made him one of the
scoring leaders in the '45-40 season.
Kloppenburg was sidelined last year
with a broken leg, and this season
he has been unable to even make the
second string.
A return to form by Kloppenburg
could make the Trojans a definite
threat for the conference title.

The Trojans started their Eastern
trip in grand style by beating North
western 52 to 4(5, but proceeded to
drop their next four games to Mich
igan, Niagara, La Salle, and Long
Island. However, their unimpressive
showing during the holiday tour can
be attributed in part to the fact that
a flu epidemic hit the squad.
VETERANS ON FIRST TEAM
Bill Sharman, Abe Androff, aftd
Alex Hannum led the scoring on the
Eastern junket. Sharman, Androff,
and Joe White have been holding
down the forward positions. Backing
up 6'6" Hannum at center is Stan
Christie who saw a gread deal of ac
tion during the Eastern trip. At
guards are Fred Bertram and Earl
Wallis with Naslund in reserve.
All these men are returning let
termen with the exception of Wallis.
Newcomer Dick Frey is a capable
replacement who has impressed both
at center and at guard.
KLOPPENBURG DISAPPOINTS
The big disappointment to South
ern California fans has been the fail
ure of Bobby Kloppenburg to regain
the form which made him one of the
scoring leaders in the '45-40 season.
Kloppenburg was sidelined last year
with a broken leg, and this season
he has been unable to even make the
second string.
A return to form by Kloppenburg
could make the Trojans a definite
threat for the conference title.
In the second game of its split
twin bill in LA. this weekend, the
I Indian basketball team takes on the
defending Southern Division cham
pions, UCLA. The Indians earned an
i even break with the Westwooders in
four games last year and the game
! tomorrow night figures to be very
close with the breaks possibly de
| ciding the issue.
Coach Wilbur Johns of the Bruins
I has assembled a veteran team with
j twelve lettermen returning including
! Captain Johnny Stanich, Dick West,
and Davage Minor, half of last year's
Gold Dust Twins.
In addition, Johns has bolstered
! the squad with seven transfer stu
dents and .six members of last year's
Bruin Babes.
STANICII IS BACK
Two-fingered Johnny Stanich
leads the bumper crop of Bruin l'or-
J wards. His long one-handers are
| deadly and he has improved on his
overall floor play as well to rank as
! an All-Coast candidate. His running
J mate is Dick West who is an im
: portant cog in the Uclans' fast break
attack. Riftht behind these two are
Veterans Guy Buccola and Chuck
Clustka.
All Coast Davage Minor returns
at one of the guard spots. At the
other guard spot is Bill Rankin, an
other returning letterman. Ron Pear-
I son and Don Seidel are the number
two duo.
Center is UCLA's problem this
year with big Don Barksdale gone.
To date Johns has alternated George
Stanich, younger brother of Johnny,
Alan Sawyer, and Gene Williams at
the pivot post, with a slight edge to
Stanich. All three are above the 6'3"
; mark and fast.
MNE-TIIREE RECORD
With this array of talent, UCLA
will be a tough hurdle for the Car
dinals to leap. The fast-breaking
Bruins, paved by the long shots of
Johnny Stanich and drive in shots by
Minor and West, have won nine out
of twelve non-conference games
while averaging 55 points per game.
Among their victims have been such
ranking teams as LIU. St. Joseph's,
Cornell, and Santa Clara. The first
three were beaten on the Bruins'
: eastern trip his winter.
In short, to halt Stanich, Minor
j & Co., the Indians will have to be
primed defensively as well as of
j fensively come tomorrow night.

The Trojan cagers who face Stan
ford Friday night in Los Angeles are
rated by most observers as the weak

However, the men of Troy have an

on the coast.
