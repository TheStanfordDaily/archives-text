# Frosh Cagers Will Play Host to Two Prep Teams
## 
### 
While their varsity brethren travel south the Stanford Freshman
basketball team will play host to Abraham Lincoln High School
of San Francisco at 3:30 today in the Pavilion.
Seeking their third win in as many starts against outside com
petition, the yearlings will find themselves up against one of the

top prep quintets of the Bay Area.
In Lincoln's last contest, they rode
roughshod over Balboa High, win
ning easily, 45 to 27. That contest
was highlighted by he driving layup
type of ball featured by the Links
and the excellent zone defense by
the winners that allowed the Bucs
but one basket in the first nine min
utes of play.
Against the high scoring City out
fit, Frosh Coach Jack Dana will start
the same team that started in the
wins over Salinas JC and Galileo
High in last quarter's play.
Palo Alto's contributions to Farm
basketball, Paul Watson and Don
Patch, will play from the forward
slots with Bill Herron holding down
the center position. Marvin Gelber
and Dick Clegg have been named as
guards. Among others expected to
see action in this afternoon's tilt are
Lloyd Kelly, Derk Bok and Fran
Watson at forwards, Ken Gardner at
guard, and Hal Campen, center. Wat
son is a first quarter freshman from
Richmond who, Coach Dana expects,
will bolster the scoring strength of
his squad.
Starting lineup for the Mustangs
will be Vkecevich and Froeschle at
forwards, McKenzie and Brilliant at
guards, and Ramsted, center.
On Saturday at 3:30 the frosh will
meet Sequoia High in the Pavilion.
The Farm squad will be hampered
by a lack of practice since its last
game, over three weeks ago. Since
that time Dana has had time to put
his lads through but three practice
sessions, most of the time being spent
in brush-up work and conditioning
! play.
