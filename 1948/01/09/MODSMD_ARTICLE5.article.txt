# New Tom Mix Serial Begins
## 
### 
Tom Mix and his wonder horse
Tony will thunder over the plains
with blazing six-shooters dispensing
justice to, black-hearted villains
bent upon dastardly deeds of evil
this Sunday in the first episode of
the serial "Miracle Rider," accord
ing to Bob Kinsinger, Sunday Eve
ning Movie manager.
In order to avoid a repetition of
last quarter's delivery disappoint
ments and to assure an installment
every Sunday, it was necessary to
cancel the Flash Gordon serial,
Kinsinger said.
"No student will have to under
go finals without learning the fate
of the "miracle rider," since two
chapters of the serial will be shown
on some Sundays, in order to finish
the 15 episodes by the end of the
quarter," Kinsinger stated.
A desert intrigue of old-fashioned
romantic adventure melodrama,
"Sundown," will be the feature of
this Sunday's movie. Gene Tierney
is the sultry half-caste daughter of
an Arab trader, and Bruce Cabot,
George Sanders, and Reginald Gar
diner are supporting players.
Admission will be 20 cents, and
the program will start at 7:30 p.m.
in the Memorial Auditorium.
