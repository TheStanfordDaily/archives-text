# A 						Step Forward

### 
Excom Wednesday night passed the first
of a series of improvements planned for the
ASSU constitution. The committee voted for
a revision of the system of electing the Head
Yell Leader, which had been worked out by
the Rally Committee chairmen and the present
Head Yell Leader.
Under the new method the Head Yell Leader
will be elected from six candidates rather than
from the assistant leaders as was done under
the old by-laws.
These candidates will be chosen from a group
of tryoutees who have been given a training
program by the present Head Yell Leader. The
two assistant leaders can be among the try
outees.
By having six candidates to chose from,
the student body is given more leeway in the
election of a Yell Leader than under the past
system.
The second major change in this article is
that the assistant yell leaders will be selected
from the five remaining candidates by the
newly elected Head Yell Leader.

It is important that cheer leaders be able to
work together in close cooperation. In select
ing his own assistants the yell leader can
choose those people who can adapt themselves
to his style.
These changes in the Activities Council
Charter were brought before Excom because
of many complaints from the student body re
garding the old system of electing yell leaders.
The purpose of the new by-laws is to make the
office of Head Yell Leader more flexible and
to attempt to maintain the highest possible stan
dard of cheer leading.
Under the approved changes, the yell lead
er will not be voted on until the spring quarter
elections. Students will be given the opportun
ity to watch the candidates' work during basket
ball season.
The changes approved by Excom this week
are a step forward in improving one of the
numerous points in the constitution which has
been faulty and has been overlooked too
long.—M.S.
