### AL MUNK 
A certain amount of confusion is to be expected
at the beginning of each quarter but usually it's the
students that are confused, and not our omnipotent
faculty.
However, anything can happen at Stanford.
A natural science class, Physics, I think, was con
vening for one of its first lectures the other day, and
the teacher was making those usual "introductory"
remarks about the scope of the course.
Among other things he apologized for the fact
that the course was going to cover tfie same material
that a certain Geography course had covered only
very recently. And to add insult to injury, the teacher
regretfully announced that this class would use the
very same textbook the Geography class had used.
Follow me?
The whole thing was a slight administrative mix
up—in the Army I believe they called it SNAFU —
situation normal, all fouled up!
But anyway, this harrassed prof continued, we
will have some very interesting guest speakers for
this course. And he did, too!

The main guest speaker turned out to be the
prof who had taught the Geography course not so
long ago!
No wonder we're all wet, what with all this con
fusion that reigns hereabouts.
I hope this little item won't deter our campus
skiers from heading into the Sierras this winter, but
the people it happened to just wanted to pass the
story on to the rest of the Stanfordites.
This boy and this girl were driving down highway
40 on their way to Donner and Reno for a couple of
days of skiing. As they approached the vicinity of
the California-Nevada border late one afternoon, they
found themselves driving behind a little green coupe.
There was nothing unusual about this coupe, ex
cept a little home-made sign that lit up every time a
car sped by, heading for Nevada. Just a little sign
that read:
"Are you violating the Mann Act?"
Sounds like a stupid question to me. My friends
always walk across the border.
