### ALLEN BLETZ 
The Republican leadership in Congress has set
itself against the program of inflation control proposed
by President Truman and to the last man they won't
budge a fraction of an inch. Senator Taft is willing
to agree only to curtailment of private credit and
control of exports. Other Republicans hinted that
they may also accede to rent controls.
However, the Republican leaders have turned
thumbs down on the most vital parts of the Truman
program: Limited rationing and limited control of
prices and wages.
What does the Republican leadership offer in the
place of these items in the Truman program which it
rejects? Senator Taft has three proposals of his
own, beyond what he accepts of the Truman pro
gram. lie would reduce the cost of the Marshall Plan,
skish government expenses, and reduce taxes.
The Marshall Plan did not produce the inflation.
It is now barely under way, yet cost of living items
have risen 23 percent since the middle of 1946 and it
is continuing to spiral higher. Inflation was already
a burden on the American people before the Marshall
Plan came into existence.
We could not cure the inflation even if we scut
tled the Marshall Plan, but we shall certainly scuttle
the Marshall Plan unless we cure the inflation. The
vast bulk of the goods which the Marshall Plan na
tions require will have to come from the United
Slates, and the consequences will be that more money
will be bidding against less goods—in other words,
an increase in inflation.
Thus, a reduction of the coft of the Marshall
Plan will at best only leave inf' ition at its present
rate of increase instead of making it worse; it won't
improve anything, and the rate at which inflation
is increasing right now is devastating.

Senator Taft next proposes to slash government
expenses. Economy in government is always a good
thing, and if anyone can reduce expenses at Wash
ington without impaling essential services, we are
all for it. The Republican leadership demonstrated
pretty convincingly last year, however, that it does
not know how to reduce government expenses.
How many of you can remember the dismissal of
8.200 revenue agents who brought $600,000,000 in
taxes into the treasury the year before? Yet the
Republicans claimed that they saved $30,000,000 for
the country. This was not economy—it was blind,
indiscriminate hacking at essential services.
Taft's third proposal for the control of inflation
is to reduce taxes. This would release more money
to bid against the limited supply of goods, and, as
anyone knows, the larger the amount of money that
is bidding, the more inflationary is the result.
Senator Taft and the Republican leadership do
not, in short, have any effective ideas about how to
control inflation. They are simply against the Presi
dent's program. I seriously doubt whether these men
are of such calibre as to assume responsibility and
come forward with an affirmative program.
These types of "leaders" do our counlry no good.
They endanger our domestic peace, for if inflation is
allowed to continue it is bound to provoke serious
industrial unrest. They endanger our foreign policy,
for the success of the Marshall Plan depends on keep
ing within bearable limits the sacrifices it entails
at home.
If these men refuse to back up legislation which
is for the good of the country, then, at least, they
should conic forward with an affirmative program—
something which they have failed to do in the past.

is to reduce taxes. This would release more money
to bid against the limited supply of goods, and, as
anyone knows, the larger the amount of money that
is bidding, the more inflationary is the result.
Senator Taft and the Republican leadership do
not, in short, have any effective ideas about how to
control inflation. They are simply against the Presi
dent's program. I seriously doubt whether these men
are of such calibre as to assume responsibility and
come forward with an affirmative program.
These types of "leaders" do our counlry no good.
They endanger our domestic peace, for if inflation is
allowed to continue it is bound to provoke serious
industrial unrest. They endanger our foreign policy,
for the success of the Marshall Plan depends on keep
ing within bearable limits the sacrifices it entails
at home.
If these men refuse to back up legislation which
is for the good of the country, then, at least, they
should conic forward with an affirmative program—
something which they have failed to do in the past.
The Republican leadership in Congress has set
itself against the program of inflation control proposed
by President Truman and to the last man they won't
budge a fraction of an inch. Senator Taft is willing
to agree only to curtailment of private credit and
control of exports. Other Republicans hinted that
they may also accede to rent controls.
However, the Republican leaders have turned
thumbs down on the most vital parts of the Truman
program: Limited rationing and limited control of
prices and wages.
What does the Republican leadership offer in the
place of these items in the Truman program which it
rejects? Senator Taft has three proposals of his
own, beyond what he accepts of the Truman pro
gram. lie would reduce the cost of the Marshall Plan,
skish government expenses, and reduce taxes.
The Marshall Plan did not produce the inflation.
It is now barely under way, yet cost of living items
have risen 23 percent since the middle of 1946 and it
is continuing to spiral higher. Inflation was already
a burden on the American people before the Marshall
Plan came into existence.
We could not cure the inflation even if we scut
tled the Marshall Plan, but we shall certainly scuttle
the Marshall Plan unless we cure the inflation. The
vast bulk of the goods which the Marshall Plan na
tions require will have to come from the United
Slates, and the consequences will be that more money
will be bidding against less goods—in other words,
an increase in inflation.
Thus, a reduction of the coft of the Marshall
Plan will at best only leave inf' ition at its present
rate of increase instead of making it worse; it won't
improve anything, and the rate at which inflation
is increasing right now is devastating.

Senator Taft next proposes to slash government
expenses. Economy in government is always a good
thing, and if anyone can reduce expenses at Wash
ington without impaling essential services, we are
all for it. The Republican leadership demonstrated
pretty convincingly last year, however, that it does
not know how to reduce government expenses.
How many of you can remember the dismissal of
8.200 revenue agents who brought $600,000,000 in
taxes into the treasury the year before? Yet the
Republicans claimed that they saved $30,000,000 for
the country. This was not economy—it was blind,
indiscriminate hacking at essential services.
Taft's third proposal for the control of inflation
is to reduce taxes. This would release more money
to bid against the limited supply of goods, and, as
anyone knows, the larger the amount of money that
is bidding, the more inflationary is the result.
