# Better Family Relations Aim of Marriage Course
## 
### JACKIE WOOLF 
'"A man is never successful un
less he is happily married, and a
happily married man can never be
called a failure." This quotation
was used by Mrs. W. K. Mac Curdy,
director of "Marriage and the Fam
ily" (Social Sciences 120), in em
phasizing the need for this course
being offered this quarter.
Mrs. Mac Curdy also stated, "Mod
ern education all too often stresses
national affairs and international
relations, but ignores personal rela
tions completely." She added, "A
community is a good community
only if the people in it are well ad
justed, and in my opinion the most
important duty of education is to
produce a well-integrated individ
ual."
Although this is the tenth time
"Marriage and the Family" has been
offered to Stanford students, this
course is relatively new in school
curricula. Many educators believe
that personal relations training
should be offered to high school
students. Mrs. Mac Curdy explained
that "drawing apart of families also
taers individuals apart. If we are
part of a balanced family, then we
arc likely to be more balanced, and
the same applies for nations."
"Marriage and the Family" is de
signed to explain the problems of
modern marriages caused by chang
ing of the structure of our society.

or engaged students, and is now

Mrs. Mac Curdy, director of the
course, is the former Dean of Wom
en of Alma College, Alma, Michi
gan, where she was called upon to
act as counselor and adviser for
both men and women, and as a re
sult has had very recent experience
with the problems of modern youth.
Twenty-three guest speakers will
give specialized lectures to the class
on such topics as "Courtship and
Romantic Tradition,'; "Eugenic Con
siderations in Mate Selection," and
"Predictions of Marital Success."
