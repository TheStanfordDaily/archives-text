# Rome Faces Strike Of Tax Collectors
## 
### 
HOME, Jan. 11 (UP) â€”The Communist-led National Labor Confedera
tion ordered 100,000 tax collectors to go on strike tomorrow to support
00,000 striking bank workers, and to stay out until the bank strike is
settled.
Guiseppe Di Vittoria, Communist general secretary of the Confedera
tion, issued the call after Government and bank representatives failed
again to end the crippling dispute.
The strike of bank employees for higher wages entered its third week
with businessmen demanding that the Government settle it at once.
The Bankers' Association estimated $102,000,000 worth of business was
being held up.
Businessmen declared they have been charged interest as high as 120
percent on liquid credits from non-bankers. Most firms have not met
payrolls for two weeks and even the state-owned Bank of Italy said it
may close down during the walkout.
The determined Communist campaign to unseat Premier Alcide De
Caspcri's government was intensified with the new strike threats.
