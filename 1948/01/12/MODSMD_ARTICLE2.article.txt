NANKING, Jan. 11 (UP) â€”Government reports from the field today
announced the second Communist offensive against the Manchurian
capital of Mukden had been cracked, and the main Communist forces
were retreating west across the frozen Liao river.
Reinforced Nationalist units today recaptured Hsiaochang, 10 miles
southeast of Tientsin, but the Communists continued to exert pressure
around North China's most important port by cutting the Peiping-
Tientsin railway at several points and hampering government troop
movements.
Pro-Government reports said shipping had been resumed at Tangku
and Tientsin under military escort, thus reopening the Nationalists'
only sea outlet for the Pciping-Tientsin area, but vessels navigating
the channel into Tientsin are under danger of attack.
