### BIPAN CHANDRA 
"At Stanford, I am a student like
any other student and I would like
to be known as Hamad only," de
clared Hamad Al-Khalifah when
asked to talk about himself and his
princely status.
Hamad, a modest young man of 24
years and a great admirer of Kip
ling, is an ex-student of Beirut Uni
versity and the first cousin of the
ruling Amir of Bahrein, a tiny is
land in the Persian Gulf.
PALESTINE
When asked about the Arab alti
tude toward the Palestine situation,
Hamad replied:
"The Palestine problem should be
decided by Arabs alone and not. by
any assembly or foreign power. The
King of Iraq has said, 'Independence
is to be taken and it is never given'."
After a short pause Hamad con
tinued, 'This applies to Palestine
especially. Arabs are known to be
hospitable and they would, as they
have done in the past, welcome
strangers in their country. But in
the Palestine problem we have a
people who are trying to drive the
Arabs out of their home and to es
tablish a government of their own."
When asked about the authori
tarian kings and princes in the Mid
dle East, he replied:
"Their authority is limited by
representative parliaments and as
semblies in most of the Arab coun
tries. Elections are held mostly on
the basis of adult franchise."
VEILS GOING
On the subject of the status of
women in the Arab society, Hamad
stated:
"Many enlightened people have
been working for the emancipation
of women since the beginning of the
20th century and have succeeded to

| a certain limit in certain parts of
I the Arab East."
"For example," he added, "in
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and
Lebanon women no longer wear
veils. Everywhere they are going to

colleges. And though they have no
i political rights at present, they are
| trying."
Hamad is an undergraduate stu-
J dent, at Stanford in economics.
'I came to Stanford because I had

| heard a grcal deal about its excel
j lent climate and its good school of
j economics," he said.
He intends to go back to Bahrein
j and work for the uplift of its 175,-
j 000-strong population.

PALESTINE
When asked about the Arab alti
tude toward the Palestine situation,
Hamad replied:
"The Palestine problem should be
decided by Arabs alone and not. by
any assembly or foreign power. The
King of Iraq has said, 'Independence
is to be taken and it is never given'."
After a short pause Hamad con
tinued, 'This applies to Palestine
especially. Arabs are known to be
hospitable and they would, as they
have done in the past, welcome
strangers in their country. But in
the Palestine problem we have a
people who are trying to drive the
Arabs out of their home and to es
tablish a government of their own."
When asked about the authori
tarian kings and princes in the Mid
dle East, he replied:
"Their authority is limited by
representative parliaments and as
semblies in most of the Arab coun
tries. Elections are held mostly on
the basis of adult franchise."

stated:
"Many enlightened people have
been working for the emancipation
of women since the beginning of the
20th century and have succeeded to

| a certain limit in certain parts of
I the Arab East."
"For example," he added, "in
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and
Lebanon women no longer wear
veils. Everywhere they are going to

colleges. And though they have no
i political rights at present, they are
| trying."
Hamad is an undergraduate stu-
J dent, at Stanford in economics.
'I came to Stanford because I had

| heard a grcal deal about its excel
j lent climate and its good school of
j economics," he said.
