# Flu Bypasses Farm So Far
## 
### 
A flu epidemic failed to material
ize on the Stanford campus this
weekend, but Dr. George H. Houck.
director of the Health Service, said
that it is still too early to draw any
definite conclusions about the possi
bilities of one occurring.
"We are now entering the period
when the immunity will take ef
fect," Dr. Houck continued. 'Stan
ford will not be entirely safe until
that period is over. At the moment
we do not have an epidemic."
Over 4,000 students, more than
half the school, were immunized last
week in the Health Service's at
tempt to prevent spread of the pos
sible epidemic. Using a small dose
of vaccine and a new method of in
jection, the Health Service elimi
nated reactions to the injection. Dr.
Houck announced that immuniza
tion will continue this week for all
who desire it.
A small number of students have
been coming down with the flu,
but this number does not approach
epidemic proportions. Dr. Houck
termed these cases "vtfry mild" and
"resembling the cases reported from
Southern California." Most of these
students have recovered rapidly.
There are now eight cases in the
Rest Homes out of the 30 that have
occurred.
The Health Service overcame
much trouble in securing the vac
cine for its mass vaccination pro
gram. Other Peninsula colleges
could not get the vaccine when they
attempted similar programs.
Dr. Houck termed the turnout'for
injections "one of the finest re
sponses we ever had."
