# Open Houses Set For Upper Row
## 
### 
Eleven Upper Row houses will open their doors to freshmen
and other rushees from 7 to 9 tomorrow night in the second
event of this year's formal rushing program.
"This is the last chance non-fraternity men will have to survey
the houses until invitational dates begin," commented Jim Welch,

Tnterfraternity Council president.
"Rushees should attempt to look
over as many houses as they can in
the two-hour period," Welch con
tinued. "Last Thursday's turnout
on the Lower Row was terrific, if
as many men make the rounds to
morrow night, I will consider this
year's program off to a fine start."
HOUSES LISTED
Houses entei taming rushees to
morrow night include: Alpha Delta
Phi, A!pha Tau Omega, Delta Chi,
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa
Psi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Xi,
Theta Delta, and Sigma Nu. A map
showing the location of the houses;
can be found in last Thursday's
Daily or in the "Frosh Bible."
"Although small informal groups
of rushees and fraternity men are
still permitted," Welch explained,
these meetings shall be no larger
than eight men. The maximum la
tio is four fraternity men to one
rushee."
MAY PLEDGE
Rushees may pledge at any time
now, although no pledge is binding
until Pledge Day. If a pledge is
broken by the man, however, he
may not pledge another fraternity
for six months.

eons and dinners on Jan. 15, 20, 22,
