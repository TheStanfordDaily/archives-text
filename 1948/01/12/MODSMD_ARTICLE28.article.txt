# Open Houses Set For Upper Row
## 
### 
Eleven Upper Row houses will open their doors to freshmen
and other rushees from 7 to 9 tomorrow night in the second
event of this year's formal rushing program.
"This is the last chance non-fraternity men will have to survey
the houses until invitational dates begin," commented Jim Welch,

Tnterfraternity Council president.
"Rushees should attempt to look
over as many houses as they can in
the two-hour period," Welch con
tinued. "Last Thursday's turnout
on the Lower Row was terrific, if
as many men make the rounds to
morrow night, I will consider this
year's program ofT to a fine start."
