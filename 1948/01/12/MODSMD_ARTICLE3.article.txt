### 
SHANGHAI, Jan. 11 (UP) —The United Stales is gradually bringing
stronger pressure to bear on China to meet the terms of a long-range
aid, and the Chinese Government had launched a trial balloon program
of its own in an attempt to influence American action.
An authoritative source disclosed that the State Department through
some official channels, but mainly through unofficial conversations
with high Chinese personages, both in Nanking and Washington, is
laying down premises upon which it will agree to ask Congress for
funds for China.
These conditions, among others, according to this source, include a
definite blue print for assistance of Chinese farmers and small industries
and a realistic system by which U. S. representatives would share
equally with the Chinese in administering the general program from
start to finish.
At the same time, it was said, the United States is making an effort
to learn how far it can go in using the aid program as a lever in prying
the Chinese Government loose from its attitude on the Japanese peace
treaty.
