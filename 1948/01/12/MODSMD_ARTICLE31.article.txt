# Card Hopes Jolted by Double Southern Loss; Yearlings Split
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford's basketball team got
off to a disastrous start in the
conference schedule over the
weekend, losing to USC Friday
night and UCLA Saturday night
at Olympic Auditorium in Los
Angeles.
And this week the Cards run into
a red-hot California five, victorious
in both their games in the south.
Friday night Southern Cal forward
Bill Sharman got hot at the same
time all the Stanford players lost
their eyes, and the Trojans overcame
a six-point Stanford half-time lead
and went on to win, 39 to 33.
STAMCII AND BIJCCOLA
Saturday night it was Bruin for
wards Johnny Stanich and Guy Buc
cola who brought the Uclans from
eight points behind to take a 24 to 20
halftime lead which was never
threatened. The final score was 55
to 47.
The Indians started off as expect
ed against the Trojans in a slow
moving, low-scoring game. They had
a seemingly safe 20 to 14 lead when
the halftime buzzer sounded. Dur
ing the second half SC inched up
until a field goal by Sharman tied
the score at 30-all with 11 minutes
to go.
Babe Higgins put Stanford ahead
again momentarily with a free toss.
From here on in it was all USC.
Sharman potted two, Alex Hannum
one, and then Sharman another one
to run the lead to eight points be
fore Dave Davidson made a bucket
in the last 30 seconds to end a ten
minute Stanford drought.
SHARMAN LEADS SCORERS
Sharman led the scorers with 15
points, all of them coming in the sec
ond half. He was followed by his
partner at forward, Abe Androff who
had 10.
The following evening the Indians,
led by forward Morley Thompson,
started off like a house-afire against
the defending champion Bruins. They
were ahead 20 to 9, with only five
minutes to play in the first half.
JOHN, GUY GET HOT
At this point Stanich and Buccola
started hitting and in a phenomenal
rally sent the Bruins off the court
with a four point lead.
Shortly after the intermission Card
center Steve Stephenson went out
on five fouls, and Stanford lost what
ever chance it might have had.
Guard Dave Davidson, who can
also play the post, did not even suit
up because of a case of flu, and sec
ond string center Bob Penn was out
with a fractured foot. Dean had to
send in Dick Schutte, who wasn't
even listed on the official travelling
squad, to replace Stephenson.
With the big center out, the Bruins
were able to control the backboards,
and their four point margin grew.

Stanford's freshmen basket
ball players dropped their first
game in their collegiate careers
Friday, but went on to make the
record read three wins against
one loss on Saturday when they
downed Sequoia High in the Pavil
ion.
Lincoln High School of San Fran
cisco capitalized on the Indian year
lings' inability to hit the hoop in the
Friday contest and went on to win
by a close 31 to 27 score.
Tall Jim Ramstead, All-City baa
keteer, accounted for 13 points for
the Mustangs with teammate Lies
Brilliant dunking nine for runner-up
honors of the day. Paul Watson, Card
forward, was high for the Indians
with seven points.
A COM) DAY
The fact that the high man on the
papoose squad scored but seven
points just about tells the story. The
Farm lads controlled the pi Ay for the
larger portion of the garr«e but the
fast-breaking Links were,-a bit more
accurate in their shootir«j*.
In Saturday's tilt with the Sequoia
High lads the Frosh tigers almost
doubled their previous, day's total as
they hit for a 51 to 3Z win over the
Redwood City quintet. This 51 point
effort is the highest' mark reached
by the '51 men thus far in the season.
Coach Jack Davira's starting five
wasted no time in compiling a seven
point lead in the first quarter and
were removed in that period not to
reappear until t).>j fourth canto. The
second stringers, more than held their
own and the half time score read 27
to 18 in favor of the Cardinal juniors.
CKSARIN IIJ-GH MAN
Sequoian Dick Cesarin tanked 15
for high man honors fallowed by In
dian forwards Paul Watson with 11
and Lloyd Kelley with 9.
The California freshmen are next
on the schedule for the Indian frosh.
The two squads will play the pre
liminary to the varsity games on Fri
day and Saturday.
