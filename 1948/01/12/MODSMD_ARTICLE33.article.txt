## Bears Take PCC Lead; Dons Win 2 
### 
This weekend's four-game bas
ketball extravaganza in the Los An
geles Olympic Auditorium saw a
high - powered California quintet
emerge as the "team most likely to
succeed" in the 1948 southern divi
sion conference race.
The Bears, paced by Chuck Han
ger and Andy Wolfe, mauled the
Bruins and the Trojans on succes
sive nights by wide margins.
The collective efforts of the USC
Trojans failed to slop Chuck Han
ger, who hit the hoop for 12 field
goals and three free tosses Saturday
night to establish a new university
record for individual scoring. Han
ger scored more than half of Cal's
tallies as the Bears defeated USC
53 to 40.
CARDS LEAD BY SIX
Against SC, Stanford took the lead
early in the first hall and led 20 to
14 at the end of the first 20 minutes
of play, but late in that second
period the Cards seemed to get pro
gressively colder and the Trojan at
tack sped up. When the final gun
had sounded the Indians found
themselves on the short end of a
39 to 33 score.
Saturday night's encounter proved
to be no consolation for the Stan
ford team which bowed to the
Bruins, 55 to 47. Morley Thompson
retrieved some of his old form and
garnered 17 points for the losing In
dians, but the Westwopders' speed
plus injuries and illnesses in the
Stanford five accounted, at least in
part, for the second Card defeat.
OSC RUNS WILD
In the nothern division play, Ore
gon State, last year's conference
champs, defeated WSC's Cougars 45
to 38.
Washington, two - time winner
over the Bears in recent contests,
lost to a surprisingly strong Oregon
aggregation 73 to 58.
A hard-fighting USF five scored
successive victories over Santa
Clara and Loyola University in
games at the Cow Palace, while
the Gaels, led by ''Apples" Kudel
ka, managed to split. In Friday
night's tilt the Moragans dropped
one to Loyola, 43 to 32, but came
back the following night to defeat
the Broncos 47 to 32.
