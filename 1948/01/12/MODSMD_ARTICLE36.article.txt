# KSU Broadcasts at 880; Live Programs Scheduled
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
KSU began its second year on the air yesterday with a new
spot on the radio dial and new live programs to bolster its re
corded music broadcasts. Campus listeners can now hear KSU
at 880, but Village listeners must still dial in at 590. This inno
vation on the campus will free the station from the interference

of other local stations. The instal
lation of a new transmitter in the
Union will give enough power to
cover the campus completely, Steve
Phillips, station manager, stated.
Along with the greater clearness
of reception now available because
of the Union transmitter, KSU is
planning further mechanical im
provements. Work is already under
way to add more wire to the live
miles that now carry KSU broad
casts over the campus and Village.
Supervising the work are Del Blair,
chief engineer, and Ray Sanders,
electronics consultant.

ning. The heroine, Evelyn Krau
thiem, will be played by Kassy

KSU began its second year on the air yesterday with a new
spot on the radio dial and new live programs to bolster its re
corded music broadcasts. Campus listeners can now hear KSU
at 880, but Village listeners must still dial in at 590. This inno
vation on the campus will free the station from the interference

of other local stations. The instal
lation of a new transmitter in the
Union will give enough power to
cover the campus completely, Steve
Phillips, station manager, stated.
Along with the greater clearness
of reception now available because
of the Union transmitter, KSU is
planning further mechanical im
provements. Work is already under
way to add more wire to the live
miles that now carry KSU broad
casts over the campus and Village.
Supervising the work are Del Blair,
chief engineer, and Ray Sanders,
electronics consultant.
