### 
George Barahal, director of Stan
ford's Veterans' Center, reminds all
students â€¢ attending the University
under the GI Bill to contact the
local Red Cross chapter in Palo Alto
if their subsistence checks i;re de
layed.
The Red Cross office, iocated at
25 University Avenue in the Vet
erans' Building, Palo Alto, has vol
unteered to help veterans with sub
sistence problems. Inasmuch as the
Veterans' Administration is operat
ing with reduced personnel, this
will help speed the payment of
checks with the aid of the Red Cross
representative in the San Francisco
office.
Loans will continue to be avail
able to financially needy veterans
through the office of Shelton Beatty.
Chief Counselor for Men. This
service by the Red Cross is in addi
tion to the aid given by the campus
VA office and Mr. Beatty's office.
