PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 11 (UP).â€”
General Clifton B. Gates, Marine
Corps commandant, tonight denied
"reports" that Marines will go to
Palestine or that assignment of
some 1,000 Leathernecks to the
Mediterranean last week meant that
"the Corps is looking for trouble."
He termed the assignment of Ma
rines to ships of the U.S. Navy
'fleet" now in the Mediterranean
"routine" and denied that a detach
ment of the Corps will guard the
U.S. legation in the Holy Land,
