# Underground Wiring One-third Completed
## 
### 
Carroll Blacker, superintendent
of buildings and grounds, has re
ported that the underground con
struction work on the Farm's new
electrical development has been
one-third completed to date.
"We are progressing approxi
mately on a parallel with the three
quarters of the school year," Black
er professed, "and consequently,
having started at the beginning of
the autumn quarter, hope to have
the job completed by the end of the
academic year, or about the middle
of June."
The superintendent said that he
was executing the job with a skele
ton crew largely because of the long
wait anticipated before the neces
sary materials for final completion
of the job arrive.
