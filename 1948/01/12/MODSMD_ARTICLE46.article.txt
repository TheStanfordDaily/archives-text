Observers are rarely apt la agree on the merits of the Edgar Ewing
paintings currently on exhibit in the Ait Gallery. His works, which
were chosen to inaugurate the Pepsi Cola "Opportunity Gallery" in
New York last November, are widely versified in subject and use of
lines and color. They range from a brooding, quiet "The Knitters," to
the loose, imaginative "Wounded

Tiger," and include interiors, land
scapes, portraits.
Many are scenes from India orig
inally made as wood blocks on cart
rige cases during Ewing's service
with the Engineer Corps in India and
Burma. Among these are the "Pre
paration for the Hunt," which cap
| tures the excitement of the occasion
with exaggerated lines and strong
colors and two ihm, hazy views of
! the city of Bundy.
EMPHASIS OF COLOR
Ilis "Viow of Quebec" is a swopp
ing, romantic vista of the city, and,
| incidentally, contains two prominent
figures of undetermined significance.
Winner of the Bertha Aberle Flor

j life rather difficult to appreciate be
cause of its apparent lack of per-
I spective. The haunting eye of the
J parent in the somber "Mother and
! Child" imparts to that canvas a qual
ity of terror and strangeness. One
of the most impressive of the group
1 is the "Old Man with Rabbits," into
which the artist projects senility and
i approaching death with faint hues
! and indistinct lines.
PRIZE WINNER
Ewing started his career in art
! with strictly meticulous work hut
