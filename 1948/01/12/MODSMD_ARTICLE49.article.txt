# The
						Sunday Movie Dynasty
## 
### 
All students who are interested in the Sun
day Evening Movies do not live at 562 Lasuen.
Excom last Wednesday night accepted the
resignation of the student who managed the
Sunday Evening Movies last guarter. At the
same time it named a new manager—the person
who assisted the retiring manager and who was
recommended by that manager.
Now the job of student manager of the Sun
day Evening Movies is a paying job. Consider
ing the work involved the pay is ample, al
though not out of line. There are many students
on campus who would like the job.
The Sunday Evening Movies were not no
ticeably well-handled last guarter. The select
ion of the new manager on the recommendation
of last quarter's manager is no indication that
there will be any improvement now.
Some announcement that the job was open
should have been made. Tryouts or interviev/s
could have been held.
But overlooking all that has been written so
far —the main fault in the selection lies in a
different direction.
The new manager happens to be from the
same fraternity from which the former manager
came.

And the manager before him. And, appar
ently, a long string of men before him.
Does this fraternity have some special rush
ing program that manages to grab all potential
Sunday Evening Movie managers? Or is the
rubber-stamp procedure which Excom uses to
make these appointments oblivious to the estab
lishment of these "dynasties?"
Probably the latter is more the case. For the
appointment of the Sunday Evening Movie man
ager is not the only example of a job going from
one member of a frat to a friend of his in the
same frat. Take a look at the record and be
amazed at the number of such appointments.
Excom should adhere to a policy of never
replacing an ASSU official with someone from
the same houses. The fraternities themselves
should advocate such a plan.
It's no honor to a fraternity when a member
of that frat is appointed to an office only be
cause his predecessor in office was a member
of the same house.
And "only" is the correct word when no
interviews are held and the new man is the
fellow recommended by his fraternity brother.
