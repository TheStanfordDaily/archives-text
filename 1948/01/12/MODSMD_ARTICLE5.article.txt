# STANFORD'S RAILROAD
## 
### 
Lcland Stanford, Governor of
California during the Civil War, is
well known for the University
which he built as a memorial to
his son. His greatest achievement,
however, was the building of the
first transcontinental railroad. The
Stanford Daily will tell the story
this week.
