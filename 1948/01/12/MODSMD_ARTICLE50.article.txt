1 up pose the ladies are not actually more curious
th in men, but it just shows more.
Women are odd animals. The subject of women
has boon approached from many angles. As a matter
of fact, some of them arc all angles. Some of them
wish they were, so they diet.
They arc the victims of poetry, advertising, and
upside down gimmicks.
Women come in three ar;e.s —18, 28, and 38.
At the age of 18 a woman is a "queen, belle, sharp
chick," or just plain "pig." At the age of 18 every
time the telephone rings she Jistcns to the line of
some new man.
At 28 she's still listening. The only difference is
the phone has stopped ringing.
All during their lives they try to outdress other
women. At 18 their fathers pay the bill; at 38 their
husbands pay the bill. Still they are economy minded.

They 'wiil pay 80 cents taxi fare to find a one cent ,
reduction on such a basic commodity as lipstick. And
while they know that beauty is only skin deep, they |
are wise enough to know that most men are not canni- :
bals.
A sure way for a young girl to become unpopular j
with other girls is to win a male-balloted popularity i
contest.
They develop club-consciousness early, and it reach
es the apex after they have been married long enough
to run out of things to do. Then they join afternoon
clubs, which are places where they can spill tea,
Shakespeare, politics, and what they learned in college.
"Of all the violent passions the one that becomes
a woman best is love. In their first passion women
love their lovers; in all others they love love." Due de
la Rochefoucauld, 1613-IGBO. The Due was a great
man, I'm just a hamburger.
When a girl asked me what kind of a husband
she should choose, I said:
"Got yourself a single man. Husbands have got
enough trouble as it is." Sargent, 1925—?
And knowing all these things full well millions of
men still form a formidable army marching to capture j
the hearts of the women.
And where am I? Hell, that's me in front carrying
the flag.

Women are odd animals. The subject of women

They arc the victims of poetry, advertising, and

Women come in three ar;e.s —18, 28, and 38.
At the age of 18 a woman is a "queen, belle, sharp

some new man.
At 28 she's still listening. The only difference is
the phone has stopped ringing.
All during their lives they try to outdress other
women. At 18 their fathers pay the bill; at 38 their
husbands pay the bill. Still they are economy minded.
