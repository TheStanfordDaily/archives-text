It finally appears that justice is catching up with
Mime of the crooked automobile dealers in this country.
Too long have these "Honest Johns" been robbing the
people in every possible manner.
Several established auto dealers in Detroit were
indicted a few months ago for violating laws in their
profiteering. Acting as a one man Grand Jury, Judge
William Skillman of Detroit has brought well-docu
mented charges of sales tax evasion, falsified titles,
and fictitious cover up transactions.
If these dealers were begging for punishment, the
manufacturers did their part to bring it on. Judge
Skillman had suggested that they clean up the situa
tion by policing their dealers, and, if need be, elim
inate some of them.
It is well known that dealer franchises are valuable
properties, and dealers do not lightly risk losing their
agencies. Certainly, action by the manufacturers could
have curbed the legal profiteering dodges as well as
the unlawful ones.
But the Automobile Manufacturers' Association is
in this as deep as the car dealers themselves. They
claim that they do not make any additional profit on
the actions of car dealers. That is an unmitigated
falsehood.

Nevertheless, the Automobile Manufacturers' Asso- |
ciation "insulted" Skillman's intelligence with an at
tempted brush-off. It tried to give him the story that i
the makers' interest ends with the delivering of the |
cars to the dealers. That was when Skillman returned
the indictment.
The industry has been begging for this and they
certainly got a portion of what they have been asking
for. But the crookedness and trickery that is so well i
connected with cars and car dealers in these times j
still dominates the industry.
What Judge Skillman did in Detroit was a step
in the right direction as far as cleaning up this racket. ;
But there is no reason why it should stop in Detroit. !
San Francisco, and especially Los Angeles, could use j
a little of the "cleaning up" tactics itself, for the
hub of dishonesty in this great car-swindle racket lies
in the coastal cities.
It is too bad that the A.M.A., which has the power
to correct the present wrongs, refuses to do anything
about the situation; moreover, it is a greater shame
that the American people are letting themselves be
swindled by these profiteers. ,

But the Automobile Manufacturers' Association is
in this as deep as the car dealers themselves. They
claim that they do not make any additional profit on
the actions of car dealers. That is an unmitigated
falsehood.

Nevertheless, the Automobile Manufacturers' Asso- |
ciation "insulted" Skillman's intelligence with an at
tempted brush-off. It tried to give him the story that i
the makers' interest ends with the delivering of the |
cars to the dealers. That was when Skillman returned
the indictment.
The industry has been begging for this and they
certainly got a portion of what they have been asking
for. But the crookedness and trickery that is so well i
connected with cars and car dealers in these times j
still dominates the industry.
What Judge Skillman did in Detroit was a step
in the right direction as far as cleaning up this racket. ;
But there is no reason why it should stop in Detroit. !
San Francisco, and especially Los Angeles, could use j
a little of the "cleaning up" tactics itself, for the
hub of dishonesty in this great car-swindle racket lies
in the coastal cities.
It is too bad that the A.M.A., which has the power
to correct the present wrongs, refuses to do anything
about the situation; moreover, it is a greater shame
that the American people are letting themselves be
swindled by these profiteers. ,
It finally appears that justice is catching up with
Mime of the crooked automobile dealers in this country.
Too long have these "Honest Johns" been robbing the
people in every possible manner.
Several established auto dealers in Detroit were
indicted a few months ago for violating laws in their
profiteering. Acting as a one man Grand Jury, Judge
William Skillman of Detroit has brought well-docu
mented charges of sales tax evasion, falsified titles,
and fictitious cover up transactions.
If these dealers were begging for punishment, the
manufacturers did their part to bring it on. Judge
Skillman had suggested that they clean up the situa
tion by policing their dealers, and, if need be, elim
inate some of them.
It is well known that dealer franchises are valuable
properties, and dealers do not lightly risk losing their
agencies. Certainly, action by the manufacturers could
have curbed the legal profiteering dodges as well as
the unlawful ones.
