To the Editor:
I should like to take issue with the absurd state
ment by Allen Bletz in "History 1948" wherein he
criticizes the policies of the Republican leadership in
Congress. The whole article so distorts the facts as
to make it appear that the words came from the "New
Deal" propaganda mill.
The author is in favor of limited rationing and
price control. During the war it was demonstrated that
price control only forced products off the market and
created shortage. Rationing could not be successful
in peace time, it was a bad enough mess during the
war. Only diehards such as Chester Bowles still ad
vocate it.
For paragraphs Mr. Bletz attacks the Con
gressional leadership of the brilliant Senator Taft and
his colleagues for their supposed failure to do anything
except obstruct the administration program. May 1
remind him that that "New Deal" program of "spend,
spend, tax, tax. and elect, elect" is the same one which

practiced over a period of fifteen years has increased
the national debt two-hundred thirty billion dollars,
raised the cost of Federal Government ten fold, and
brought us nothing but a succession of national
emergencies, war, inflation, and social unrest.
The Republicans do have a program, and it would
have been in effect before this if President Truman
hadn't exercised the veto so often. Their tax reduction
program will release private initiative and increase pro
duet ion. Their reductions in expenditures will go a
long way toward checking inflation and it is only
part of their program. Let's not blame the Republicans
for all the nation's ills when the "New Deal" has been
in the White House since 1933.
I am one of those Reactionaries who still believe in
capitalism and unregulated free enterprise. As there
are still so many million of us in the country who
haven't converted to the "new ideas," let's hear both
sides of all issues in such a vein in the future. How
about it?
