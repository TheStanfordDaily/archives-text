# Card Shuffle Deals Caldwell Model-T
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
There is a Ford in the future of Stanford students Barbara
Elliott and David Caldwell since Saturday night when the two
drove off with the door prize at the junior class "Card Shuffle."
"I guess it took a little time for the excitement to catch up
with us," Miss Elliott said. "When they read off the number,

David said very quietly, I think
that's my number.' And I'm afraid
I responded with an 'Oh, really!'"
MOTOR DROPS OUT
The two drove it proudly up to
Elm Cottage, Miss Elliott's resi
dence, after the dance, but the
motor conked out 100 feet before
their destination, and the rest of
the journey was made on foot.
"It's really a grand car," Miss El
liott stated, "but it's a little incon
venient having 18 people push it
before the. motor catches."
Caldwell is having a mechanical
engineer look into the car's merits
with the possibility of having it
start with only nine people pushing
it. He has had offers from numer
ous sources to purchase the car if
its mechanical ability can be upped.
CALDWELL WILL SELL
"Wait until you see the ear to
morrow," Caldwell added. "We're
installing a love seat in the back
and a canopy over the top."
Caldwell has been offered $50 for
the car, a $10 profit over the price
paid for it by the junior class.
