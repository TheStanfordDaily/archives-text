# Stanford Plans Texts on American Ideals
## 
### FRANK SARLES 
Early on the morning of March 10
a red, white, and blue streamliner
will grind to a halt near the Palo
Alto station. It is called the Free
dom Train, and it carries the origi
nals of the documents most inti
mately connected with the history
of the United States. It will have
come a long way, and it will have
a great distance yet to go.
Thousands of Peninsula residents
— students, businessmen, laborers,
housewives — will board the train
during its day - long stop. Bigots
will view the priceless documents
as the exclusive possession of "100
per cent Americans" — like, them
selves.
VARIED REACTIONS
Idealists will look upon them rev
erently, not seeing in them even a
remote connection with the present.
Youngsters will want to touch; old
sters will look at the documents
with faintly wrinkled brow, striving
to recall long-forgotten lessons. The
great majority will leave feeling
they have had a privileged expe
rience — just what it was, they
couldn't say.
In an effort to teach the young
sters—and the oldsters —the values
of these elusive ideals. Stanford has
undertaken preparation of a series
of textbooks on the "American Way

of Life." The work was made pos
sible by a gift of $80,000 from Mr.
and Mrs. Gordon B. Crary and Mr.
and Mrs. Allan H. Crary, all of Los
Angeles.
SUPPI-EM ENTARY TEXTS
The books, which will be pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press in the fall of 1948, arc de
signed to supplement the regular
texts for elementary and high
school study. They will be designed
to promote faith in American de
mocracy, the rights and responsibil
ities of the individual, the Ameri
can economy, and the American
cultural heritage.
Dr. Edward A. Krug, associate
professor of education, is supervis
ing a research program to determine
the best techniques and the best
materials to accomplish these ideals.
The stafT will be under the overall
direction of Dean A. John Bartky
of the School of Education.
SCHOOL POPULATION
"Our school populations enter
upon their citizenship year after
year with inadequate defense
against those who would destroy
the 'American way of life.' We are
close to becoming a people without
a clear, traditionally American so- 1
eial philosophy," Dean Bartky |
warned.
"Clearly, what is lacking is the

formulation and opeation of an adc
quatc educational progam to pro
vide the future citizen with demo
cratic values to serve as bases for
determining all of his actions.''
Stanford will make a "direct
frontal attack" on this problem, ac
cording to Dean Bartky. Its most
vulnerable point, which will be the
main point of attack, is the develop
ment of techniques and materials
for teaching the values of Ameri
can ideals and institutions.

erently, not seeing in them even a
remote connection with the present.
Youngsters will want to touch; old
sters will look at the documents
with faintly wrinkled brow, striving
to recall long-forgotten lessons. The
great majority will leave feeling
they have had a privileged expe
rience — just what it was, they
couldn't say.
In an effort to teach the young
sters—and the oldsters —the values
of these elusive ideals. Stanford has
undertaken preparation of a series
of textbooks on the "American Way

of Life." The work was made pos
sible by a gift of $80,000 from Mr.
and Mrs. Gordon B. Crary and Mr.
and Mrs. Allan H. Crary, all of Los
Angeles.
SUPPI-EM ENTARY TEXTS
The books, which will be pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press in the fall of 1948, arc de
signed to supplement the regular
texts for elementary and high
school study. They will be designed
to promote faith in American de
mocracy, the rights and responsibil
ities of the individual, the Ameri
can economy, and the American
cultural heritage.
Dr. Edward A. Krug, associate
professor of education, is supervis
ing a research program to determine
the best techniques and the best
materials to accomplish these ideals.
The stafT will be under the overall
direction of Dean A. John Bartky
of the School of Education.
SCHOOL POPULATION
"Our school populations enter
upon their citizenship year after
year with inadequate defense
against those who would destroy
the 'American way of life.' We are
close to becoming a people without
a clear, traditionally American so- 1
eial philosophy," Dean Bartky |
warned.
"Clearly, what is lacking is the

formulation and opeation of an adc
quatc educational progam to pro
vide the future citizen with demo
cratic values to serve as bases for
determining all of his actions.''
Stanford will make a "direct
frontal attack" on this problem, ac
cording to Dean Bartky. Its most
vulnerable point, which will be the
main point of attack, is the develop
ment of techniques and materials
for teaching the values of Ameri
can ideals and institutions.


DR. A. JOHN BARTKY. Dean of
Stanford's School of Education,
will have overall supervision of
the Crary grant for the "American
Way" textbook preparation.
Early on the morning of March 10
a red, white, and blue streamliner
will grind to a halt near the Palo
Alto station. It is called the Free
dom Train, and it carries the origi
nals of the documents most inti
mately connected with the history
of the United States. It will have
come a long way, and it will have
a great distance yet to go.
Thousands of Peninsula residents
— students, businessmen, laborers,
housewives — will board the train
during its day - long stop. Bigots
will view the priceless documents
as the exclusive possession of "100
per cent Americans" — like, them
selves.
VARIED REACTIONS

erently, not seeing in them even a
remote connection with the present.
