# NSA Inaugurates Sale Of World Student News
## 
### 
I ,
The International Union of Students recently launched its
first overseas edition of the World Student News, which will go
on campus sale tomorrow.
Published in five languages--English, Russian, French, Span
ish, and Czechoslovakian —the magazine "provides a forum for

student opinion" among those dif
fering widely in their national and
cultural backgrounds.
STUDY OPPORTUNITIES
First-hand opportunity for inter
national study is offered by the
World-wide Mail Box. Students are
invited to introduce themselves in
as many as 63 languages through
the correspondence page because
World Student News goes to nearly
all countries except Germany, Ja
pan, Spain, and Portugal.
A quick look at conditions in co
lonial Africa shows students still
"fighting for the right to learn."
"Their victory will mean the possi
bility of educational and cultural
development for . . . millions of per
sons who are today living in pov
erty, ignorance, and superstition,"
answers the All - India Students'
Federation to charges of being "too
political."
ACADEMY OF ART
Rome's Academy of Art comcs
under postwar scrutiny by one of
its own members, who sees the new
school of the Italian theater as es
senitally still a "philosophy in the
minds of its creators." Plays pro
duced so far have ranged from Dos
tojevski's "Crime and Punishment"
lo Tennessee Williams' "The Glass
Menagerie."
The Iron Curtain is momentarily
raised in an introduction to a series
of articles on Soviet youth by a
French student. Soviet students
will describe their own views and
opinions in future WSN issues.
AMERICAN VIEW
William S. Ellis, vice-president of
the lUS. outlines the American view
of that organisation, sensing the
United States as a necessary part
and spirit of its growth.
"Through International Friend
ship and Reconstruction, Youth
Helps to Build the Peace"—heads
the article on the World Youth Fes
tival in Prague, Czechoslovakia,
which was attended last summer by
Stanford students Bill Fairer and
Lawrence Grannis.
Distributed in the United States
by the National Students' Associa
tion exclusively, the World Student

I ,
The International Union of Students recently launched its
first overseas edition of the World Student News, which will go
on campus sale tomorrow.
Published in five languages--English, Russian, French, Span
ish, and Czechoslovakian —the magazine "provides a forum for

student opinion" among those dif
fering widely in their national and
cultural backgrounds.
STUDY OPPORTUNITIES
First-hand opportunity for inter
national study is offered by the
World-wide Mail Box. Students are
invited to introduce themselves in
as many as 63 languages through
the correspondence page because
World Student News goes to nearly
all countries except Germany, Ja
pan, Spain, and Portugal.
A quick look at conditions in co
lonial Africa shows students still
"fighting for the right to learn."
"Their victory will mean the possi
bility of educational and cultural
development for . . . millions of per
sons who are today living in pov
erty, ignorance, and superstition,"
answers the All - India Students'
Federation to charges of being "too
political."

minds of its creators." Plays pro
