# MEAT PRICES SOAR

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12 (UP).
Steak at $1 a pound—and up—
was predicted by AFL Butchers'
President Milton Maxwell. v
He said increased wholesale costs
are almost certain to result in high
er prices to the consumer.
Carcass prices zoomed to a new
high of 47'2 cents a pound for beer,
44 cents for veal, and 46 cents for
lamb.
This, said Maxwell, should make
even low-grade hamburger sell at
more than 50 cents a pound.
