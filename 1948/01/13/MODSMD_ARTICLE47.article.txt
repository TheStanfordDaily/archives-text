# Strengthened Casaba Five to Face Bears
## 
### RAY EISELT 
When Stanford's varsity cagers take the floor against the
league-leading California Bears Friday night in the campus
pavilion, they should be at peak strength, "barring unforeseen
circumstances." The injuries and illnesses which plagued the
Indians on their ill-fated southland junket last weekend should

be pretty well cleared up by that
time.
The services of Dave Davidson,
veteran Indian guard, can be counted
on it' Davidson can shake off a light
but persistant case of flu. Davidson's
inability to go the stretch in the two
southern contests may well have
spelled the difference in the scores
of the USC and UCLA encounters.
Dave is expected to suit up for this
afternoon's practice session although
he will probably only go through a
light workout.
lIKiCINS EXPECTED BACK
Captain Babe Higgins is still bog
ged down with a eharley-horse, but
will probably be ready to go back
to work Wednesday. Higgins was

sorely needed Saturday night as the
Indians dropped their second straight
conference game.
Morley Thompson, who racked up
17 points in Saturday night's dual
with UCLA's Johnny Stanich, and
Bill Rose sparkled in yesterday af
ternoon's workouts.
Coach Everett Dean put the cagers
through a stiff drill and the Indians
concentrated on some tricky plays
designed to work the ball through
the tight Bear defense for lay-in
shots. The Bears will have a defi
nite advantage in height.
HOOP RACE STILL OPEN
After a weekend of play, the con
ference hoop race is apparently still
wide open in both divisions. Cal has
been rated the favorite in the south
ern division by its impressive wins
over USC and UCLA, but the Bears
have shown themselves to be a "hot"'
and "cold" team in pre-season play,
and if the Berkeley squad should
hit a "cold" streak, the pennant dash
might turn into anybody's race.
In the Northern half of the eon
ference, the pre-season favorite,
Washington, split a wild series with
the Oregon Ducks, while the not
too-highly-regarded OSC Beavers
surprised all by two-timing Wash
ington State's Cougars. The Huskies,
who have already socked the Bears
twice in pre-conference play, are
still expected to finish close to the
top of the northern division compe
tition.


The Berkeley Bears may see a
lot of Stanford guard GUS CHA
VALAS this weekend. A cool
hall - handler and an accurate
shot. Gus added nine points to the
Indian total as he filled in for Ihe
ailing; Babe Higgins in the UCLA
contest last Saturday night.

conference game.
Morley Thompson, who racked up
17 points in Saturday night's dual
with UCLA's Johnny Stanich, and
Bill Rose sparkled in yesterday af
ternoon's workouts.
Coach Everett Dean put the cagers
through a stiff drill and the Indians
concentrated on some tricky plays
designed to work the ball through
the tight Bear defense for lay-in
shots. The Bears will have a defi
nite advantage in height.
HOOP RACE STILL OPEN
After a weekend of play, the con
ference hoop race is apparently still
wide open in both divisions. Cal has
been rated the favorite in the south
ern division by its impressive wins
over USC and UCLA, but the Bears
have shown themselves to be a "hot"'
and "cold" team in pre-season play,
and if the Berkeley squad should
hit a "cold" streak, the pennant dash
might turn into anybody's race.
In the Northern half of the eon
ference, the pre-season favorite,
Washington, split a wild series with
the Oregon Ducks, while the not
too-highly-regarded OSC Beavers
surprised all by two-timing Wash
ington State's Cougars. The Huskies,
who have already socked the Bears
twice in pre-conference play, are
still expected to finish close to the
top of the northern division compe
tition.


The Berkeley Bears may see a
lot of Stanford guard GUS CHA
VALAS this weekend. A cool
hall - handler and an accurate
shot. Gus added nine points to the
Indian total as he filled in for Ihe
ailing; Babe Higgins in the UCLA
contest last Saturday night.
When Stanford's varsity cagers take the floor against the
league-leading California Bears Friday night in the campus
pavilion, they should be at peak strength, "barring unforeseen
circumstances." The injuries and illnesses which plagued the
Indians on their ill-fated southland junket last weekend should

be pretty well cleared up by that
time.
The services of Dave Davidson,
veteran Indian guard, can be counted
on it' Davidson can shake off a light
but persistant case of flu. Davidson's
inability to go the stretch in the two
southern contests may well have
spelled the difference in the scores
of the USC and UCLA encounters.
Dave is expected to suit up for this
afternoon's practice session although
he will probably only go through a
light workout.
lIKiCINS EXPECTED BACK
Captain Babe Higgins is still bog
ged down with a eharley-horse, but
will probably be ready to go back
to work Wednesday. Higgins was

sorely needed Saturday night as the
Indians dropped their second straight
conference game.
