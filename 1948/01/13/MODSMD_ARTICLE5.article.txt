## 
### 
I WASHINGTON. Jan. 12 (UP)— ;
| Senate President Arthur H. Vanden
i berg, R., Mich., jolted administration
supporters of the Marshall Plan to
day with the disclosure that he may
oppose granting the full $6,800,000,000
Marshall asked as a down payment
on the European aid program.
Vandenberg said that there was
"nothing sacrosanct" about the ad
ministration's request for $6,800,000,-
000 to carry the program through its
first 15 months beginning April 1.
CUT NOT FATAL
Apparently taking issue with Sec
retary of Slate George C. Marshall's
assertion that Congress should ap- ,
prove the full sum or forget about j
helping Europe, the GOP Foreign
Policy spokesman added "It might j
be more, it might be less. It hasn't 1
ipso facto ruined the program if one
makes changes in it."
MARSHALL COUNTERS
Secretary Marshall countered Re- I
publican criticism of his program by
predicting that its passage would les
sen the danger of a third World War.
"The chances for warlike turbu- ;
lence in Europe become more remote
as Europe becomes stabilized," he
told the House committee.
Asked what would happen if Con- |
gross rejected the plan, Marshall re- j
plied soberly that the United States
then would have to take "far-reach- !
ing steps to reassure ourselves as to |
our own security."
"Our position would be very ma
j terially weakened," he said, adding j
J that there would be a "tremendous j
reaction" among the 10 Western Eu
ropean states which the plan pro- i
poses to help.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (UP).—
| President Truman today handed
| Congress an admittedly steep budg
; et of $39,668,993,983 for the 1949 fis
i cal year, and his Republican foes
promptly lambasted it by saying it
was anywhere from $2,000,000,000
to $5,000,000,000 too high.
Boldly challenging the GOP Con
gress to an election-year showdown
on government economy, the chief
executive conceded at the outset of
his annual budget message that the
I cost of running the United States
for the 12 months beginning July 1
was going to be stiff—s2,ooo,ooo,ooo
1 more than for the current year.
TRUMAN DARES CUT
But he dared the Republicans to
i cut it without imperiling the na
] tion's military or economic security.

Here's how your tax dollar
would be divided under President
Truman's proposed budget for fis
cal 194!):
National defense 24.9 cents
International, including
foreign aid 15.7 cents
J Veterans 13.5 cents
Interest on the public
debt 11.8 cents
Reducing the public
debt 10.8 cents
Social welfare 4.5 cents
| Tax refunds 4.4 cents
Natural resources 3.7 cents
; Transportation and com
munication 3.7 cents
General government . 2.(1 cents
Agriculture 2.4 cents
Education and general
research 8 cents
I All other 1.2 cents

: More than three-quarters of the
1 proposed 194!) spending, he told
them, will go into strengthening the
: United Stales' armed forces, fight
: ing the "cold war" against Russian
j Communism abroad, and combat
| ting inflation at home.
SCOFF AT FRILLS
The challenge was picked up im
| mediately by a host of Republicans
| in the Senate and House and some
Democrats chimed in, scofTing at the
President's contention that there
| was no room for further cuts in h'is
i budget, asserting it is filled with
j "frills and gingerbread."
Chairman Eugene D. Millikin, R.,
Colo., of the Senate Finance Com
mittee predicted that the GOP
would make such drastic cuts in
the budget that both tax reduction
i and a substantial decrease in the
i public debt will be possible.
