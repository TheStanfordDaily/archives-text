### 
With its pair of new shells in the
boathouse, a new lighting" system
installed, and three new sets of oars
and a coach's launch on the way,
the Stanford crew has buckled
down to a more intensive workout
schedule for the winter quarter.
Three boats hit the water last
Thursday afternoon in the initial
workout and several more were
manned yesterday.
Crew Captain Jarvis Gates an
nounced the plans for the quarter's
workouts at the organizational
meeting last Tuesday. Special em
phasis will be placed on regular at
tendance, and prompt arrival for the
4 o'clock workouts.
Although definite boatings were
made for all men last week, Gates
pointed out that assignments had
not been made with regard to var
sity, jayvee, or frosh boats. The
present positions will merely serve
to get all men into definite shells,
facilitating observation and insur
ing constant attendance.
Mr. A. A. Clark has officially
taken over the coach's reins for the
quarter, but he stated that Student
Coach Lou Lindsey will be back
when he recoves from his back in
jury Meanwhile Mark Ancel and
Biil Morris will continue in their
frosh coach capacities.
