# Fundamentals Top Rugby Practices
## 
### 
With a tentative Saturday game
against the Menlo Ramblers edging i
closer, Coach Willard Classen's rug
gers are hard at instructional scrim- i
mage this week.
Four complete teams took the field
yesterday afternoon to run through
an hour and a half of practices in j
fundamental formations and plays, i
The number of new faces on the j
field has prompted Classen to run
his charges through practice games I
to give them an insight into the fun- 1
damentals of the sport.
From the wealth of new talent
vicing for team spots several men i
have been singled out for special
notice. Among the standouts are j
Gene Martin, backfield candidate; j
Fred Wiley, second five; Walker I
Smith and Ed Culin, second rank; !
and A 1 Turriziani, wing.
More aspiring ruggers have heed- j
ed the call since the last tally, swell
ing the membership to nearly 70. ,
From this number Classen will select j
15 men to face the University Club !
in the first league tiff a week from j
Saturday.
