### 
NEW YORK, ]an. 12 (UP) —The ranks of the invincible were
thinning faster than ever today in the nation's 1948 basketball
campaign as three more major teams were scratched from the
list of undefeated.
Kansas State, St. Louis University and West Virginia were

those which toppled from the selecl
list this week.
Kansas State had a record of 10 [
victories and no defeats when it went
onto the boards at Madison Square
Garden Tuesday against Long Island
University. But LIU whipped up a
65 to 47 upset victory.
GARDEN PROVES JINX
West Virginia's Mountaineers had I
a five-and-zero record Thursday
night—and again Madison Square ;
Garden proved to be the battlefield I
of Waterloo. Litile Manhattan Col
lege was the one to turn the trick j
this time, 58 to 53.
St. Louis U. was riding high, un
defeated in seven games, until the \
crucial Missouri Valley conference

with Oklahoma A&M hist night. Bui
Hank Iba's Aggies were up to the
occasion in a defensive battle, and
St. Louis tumbled, 33 to 30.
UNBEATEN TEAMS PULL THRU
However, other major undefeated
teams pulled through during the
week-end—and the East seemed to
have more than its share of them —
Columbia, NYU, Rhode Island State,
LaSalle, Duquesne and Fordham.
lowa licked Ohio State and Pur
due in quick succession to hold the
top-flight honors in the Big Nine
conference race, but Illinois and Wis
consin were in there pushing.
