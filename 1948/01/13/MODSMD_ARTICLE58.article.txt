# Get Out of the Rut
## 
### 
Out of approximately 1,000 seniors on cam
pus, 56 attended the class meeting last week.
Class activities, always weak on a large cam
pus, have been subordinated to living group
functions to a great extent recently. This was
promoted by the change in Excom representa
tion from class to areas.
While you are a freshman, sophomore, or
junior there always are some people who dis
cover that it's fun to do extra-curricular jobs
and meet new people, and this group manages
to keep the class solvent for three years.
By the time you are a senior this group is
pretty well established. But as seniors the class

activities increase many times. And then this
group needs your help.
For those graduating in June it's the last
chance to become acquainted with classmates,
renew acquaintances formed in Roble and En
cina, and have the fun of planning and execut
ing dances, picnics, class day, etc. In short, it's
the last chance to get out of the rut!
Other class leaders might benefit from the
hint that it's wise to build up and encourage a
large nucleus of willing workers who will most
certainly be needed when time for the big
splash comes around.—M. H.
