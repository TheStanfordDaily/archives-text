# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL MUNK 
The first item this morning, believe it or not, is in
the form of a public service. That is for those of you
who take your liquid mid-morning nourishment in the
form of milk.
Milk in bottles, that is!
Some poor unfortunate characters have suffered
bad consequences. They would wander up to the Cel
lar coffee shop window, plunk down a good FDR dime,
and get a nice white bottle of cow's milk from the
smiling salesman. Good milk, too, straight from the
farm —but that's an udder story . . .
Anyway, they'd just about get back to their seat on
one of the benches of the sidewalk cafe, happily sit
down, when the catastrophe would happen. Just as
they'd get ready to attack the liquid, the bottom would
drop out of the bottle, spilling the lovely contents all
over skirts and books.
A physics major explained the whole deal to me—
it's so cold out these mornings, and the bottles are
kept so cold before they're sold, that the glass in the
bottom of the bottle cracks, or some such reason. Re
gardless of the reason, you haven't got a chance with
the bottoms dropping out of bottles on their own, just
like that « . .
Better stick to coffee, and bottoms up!
Which reminds me of the Quad photographer who
held up a poly sci class in the History Building the
other morning.
This eager photographer wanted to shoot a picture
of a typical Farm couple, in class, taking notes. First

he selected a well-known campus blonde and a short
butched rough as his subjects, placing them next to
each other without nary so much as an introduction,
and told them to hold hands.
Smiling gleefully at his subtle sense of humor, he
ascended one of the class chairs behind the giggling
couple and focused his Graphlex, but then suddenly
changed his mind.
No, no, he thought, this is supposed to be a shot of
a typical Stanford twosome in class. So still without
introducing the two to each other, he asked Jean, the
blonde that is, to take the squire's hand and hold it
in her lap, sort of lovingly. Which she did, sort of
blushingly.
Then he posed the prof before the two, lecturing
sternly, flashed his little bulb, and that's what you'll
see in the Quad, very soon, as a typical classroom
scene, 112 doubt whether it's typical.
None of our twosomes take notes that way. in class,
that is!
This same poly sci prof was lecturing on Congress,
when he commented on the difference in name be
tween the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
This, said he, might be a reflection on the greater
maturity and age of the members of the Senate. They
don't have any affairs, but only relations!
Judging on the same basis, Stanford women appar
ently are rather childish!

the bottoms dropping out of bottles on their own, just
like that « . .
Better stick to coffee, and bottoms up!
Which reminds me of the Quad photographer who
held up a poly sci class in the History Building the
other morning.
This eager photographer wanted to shoot a picture
of a typical Farm couple, in class, taking notes. First

he selected a well-known campus blonde and a short
butched rough as his subjects, placing them next to
each other without nary so much as an introduction,
and told them to hold hands.
Smiling gleefully at his subtle sense of humor, he
ascended one of the class chairs behind the giggling
couple and focused his Graphlex, but then suddenly
changed his mind.
No, no, he thought, this is supposed to be a shot of
a typical Stanford twosome in class. So still without
introducing the two to each other, he asked Jean, the
blonde that is, to take the squire's hand and hold it
in her lap, sort of lovingly. Which she did, sort of
blushingly.
Then he posed the prof before the two, lecturing
sternly, flashed his little bulb, and that's what you'll
see in the Quad, very soon, as a typical classroom
scene, 112 doubt whether it's typical.
None of our twosomes take notes that way. in class,
that is!
This same poly sci prof was lecturing on Congress,
when he commented on the difference in name be
tween the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
This, said he, might be a reflection on the greater
maturity and age of the members of the Senate. They
don't have any affairs, but only relations!
Judging on the same basis, Stanford women appar
ently are rather childish!
The first item this morning, believe it or not, is in
the form of a public service. That is for those of you
who take your liquid mid-morning nourishment in the
form of milk.
Milk in bottles, that is!
Some poor unfortunate characters have suffered
bad consequences. They would wander up to the Cel
lar coffee shop window, plunk down a good FDR dime,
and get a nice white bottle of cow's milk from the
smiling salesman. Good milk, too, straight from the
farm —but that's an udder story . . .
Anyway, they'd just about get back to their seat on
one of the benches of the sidewalk cafe, happily sit
down, when the catastrophe would happen. Just as
they'd get ready to attack the liquid, the bottom would
drop out of the bottle, spilling the lovely contents all
over skirts and books.
A physics major explained the whole deal to me—
it's so cold out these mornings, and the bottles are
kept so cold before they're sold, that the glass in the
bottom of the bottle cracks, or some such reason. Re
gardless of the reason, you haven't got a chance with
the bottoms dropping out of bottles on their own, just
like that « . .
Better stick to coffee, and bottoms up!
