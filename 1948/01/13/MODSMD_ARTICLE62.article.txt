MUROC AIR BASE, Jan. 12
(UP). â€” A rocket-powered ground
vehicle traveling on a railroad track
has cracked the speed -of - sound
barrier with speeds in excess of
1,000 miles an hour, the U.S. Ait-
Force disclosed today.
Modified jet - bomb launching
sleds about 15 feet long were used
in the experiment with "slippers"
to hold the sleds to the rails.
Purpose of the experiment, offi
cials said, was to determine if an
outdoor wind tunnel, in which the
object instead of the air moved,
would be practical.
First high - speed run over the
2,000-foot railroad was made Sept.
20. 1946. with a top speed of 1,012
miles an hour recorded.
