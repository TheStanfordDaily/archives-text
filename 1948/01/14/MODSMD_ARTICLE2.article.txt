## Atom Threat Due in '53 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP) â€” |
President Truman's Air Policy com
mission told the nation tonight it
has but five years to prepare for :
possible atomic war.
Picturing the mass destruction I
possible from an onslaught by trans
polar and transoceansupersonic
planes and missiles, the commission
fixed Jan. 1, 1953, as the "target date j
by which we should have an air arm, ;
in being, capable of dealing with a
possible atomic attack."
Entitled "Survival in the Air I
Age," the report released by the !
White House recommended imme
diate increase of the national de
/ense budget from a present $10,-
098.000,000 to $11,590,000,000 in cal
endar 1948 and said the figure
should rise to $13,200,000,000 in 1949.
Five months in preparation by a
five-man group of private citizens
headed by Thomas K. Finletter, New
York attorney, the report envision
ed a nation with its militai-y and
civilian resources geared to the pos
sibility of war as far as that is pos
sible in a peacetime democracy.
Besides the horrors of atomic war
fare, the commission depicted the
havoc that could be wrought by
biological weapons which, it said,
could be delivered against a coun- |
try by air or by pre-placement by
enemy agents.
