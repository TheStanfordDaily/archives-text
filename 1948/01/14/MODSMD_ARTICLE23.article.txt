nounced yesterday by Dr. Donald B.

The collection, presented to Stan

country, stated Dr. Nathan van Pat

The collection contains American, j
i Canadian, British. European, Latin [
| American, and Japanese items. The
I most valuable single item in the
Brown collection is one of two exist
ing perfect files of "War Against
War," a chronicle of the International
! Crusade of Peace, edited by the great |
British journalist William T. Stead |
and published in in 1899. The
only other existing perfect copy is
in the British Museum.
The earliest English newspapers j
in the collection date from 1665. It
includes issues of the London Ga- I

zette, first newspaper published in
England, and 26 numbers of it which
were issued from Oxford, where
Charles II and his court took refuge
to avoid the plague raging in London.
Contemporary accounts of the Ci
vil War are given in issues of the
Washington Daily Chronicle, the At
lanta Daily Intelligencer, the Mobile
Daily News (in an issue believed to
be unique in that it was published
during the breakup of the Confeder
acy), and in such newspapers as the
Chicago Tribune, New York Times,
and New York Morning World.
There are many "disaster" issues,
including the Galveston Daily News'
and the Houston Chronicle's report
of the Galveston tidal wave, which
claimed 6000 lives; a Florida paper's
mimeographed issue put out during
a hurricane; and the New York Eve
ning Post which appeared during the
Great Blizzard of 1888.
Last year Stanford secured a col
lection of 45,000 colonial and early
American newspapers from Elmer
Robinson, new mayor of San Fran
cisco, and from purchases with Uni
versity funds.
