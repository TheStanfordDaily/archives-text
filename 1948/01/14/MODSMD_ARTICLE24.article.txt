# FRATERNITIES
## Rushees Visit Row Houses 
### 
An unprecedented number of
freshmen and other non-fraternity
men stalked the Upper Row last
night from 7 to 9 in the last open
house event of this year's rushing
program.
The schedule from now on is in
vitational. Luncheons and dinners
begin tomorrow and continue on
Jan. 20, 22, 26, and 28.
"Because of the large number of
rushees this year," commented Jim
Welch, Interfraternity Council pres
ident, "fraternities were not always
able to become acquainted with all
the men they might be interested in.
In order to remedy this, I should
like the rushees who did not receive
invitations from houses they liked
to confer with their resident as
sistants. The counselors should
compile a list and turn it in to the
Interfraternity Council. We, in
turn, will inform the fraternities."
Rushees should be thoroughly ac
quainted with rushing regulations,
warned Welch. The complete rides
can be found in the Interfraternity
Magazine, distributed yesterday.
Additional copies are available in
the Interfraternity Council office.
Informal meetings of more than
eight men, with a maximum ratio
of four fraternity men to each rush
ee, are expressly forbidden. "Any
infraction of this rule," continued
Welch, "means a fine for both fra
ternity and rushee."
A consensus of opinions of Encina
sponsors evidenced a great enthu
siasm on the part of rushees. It was
generally agreed that most of the
rushees had no definite opinion, as
yet, as to which fraternity they
liked most. Rushing continues until
formal pledging on Jan. 31.
