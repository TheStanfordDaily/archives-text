## Frosh, Sophomore Classes, ASSU To Receive Bill for Rally Damages 
### 
Assessment of the damages arising from last quarter's pajam
arino was determined yesterday at a joint meeting of Men's and
Women's Councils. The total damages, estimated at nearly
$1,000, were apportioned as follows: ASSU, 50 percent; Fresh
man class, 30 percent; Sophomore class, 20 percent.
It was left for the executive bodies of the two classes to detci

Men's and Women's Councils, in
arriving at this division of the costs,
sought to fix responsibility on those
groups which might have provided
for a well-organized, enjoyable Pa
j .iiarino, according to Jim Welch,
Men's Council chairman. This plan
was adopted rather than that which
sought to assess campus living groups
as a punitive measure, because it
had been thought merely "possible"
that members of these groups had
taken part in the destruction of pro
perty at Roble Hall.
The combined councils, in revers
ing the policy adopted by the com
mittee set up by Excom last No
vember, felt that this committee of
living group representatives was ac
tually not representative of thes'>
groups, added Welch. This commit
tee adopted a plan assessing living
groups, which passed by a vote of
8 to 6, seeming to point to a num
ber of 14 living groups on campus.
Actually, when the Row is consid
ered a single group, it is difficult to
find this many living groups on the
Stanford campus.
Betty Callandar, chairman of Wo
men's Council, pointed out the fact
that the combined councils include
representatives from Lagunia, Toy
on, fraternities, Women's Row, and
Roble.
Women's Council was represented
at the meeting by Betty Callandar,
chairman; Mary Ellen Rice, Betty
Wellington, June Selder, and Patty
Gammon. Men's Council was repre
sented by Jim Welch (chairman),
Loren Smith, Fred Hannum, and
Jack Little (Daily representative).
