# Ski Resorts Await Stanford, Snow
## 
### TOM SELF 
While Utah is battling Ne
vada for "milking the clouds"
of "their" snow, Stanford's 400
(some odd Ski Club members
tare praying fervently that it
will snow hard at one of the ski
resorts within weekend radius
of the Farm.
j St tow conditions at nearby areas
were disappointing during Christ
mas vacation, being best at Yosem
ile. Little snow was found at Mt.
Hose, and the Norden-Donner-Soda
Springs area was rated poor to fair.
Even Sun Valley was so lacking in
snow on the right slopes that the
Intercollegiate Invitational Meet
had to be moved to Galena Pass.
The climax came last Friday when
il was announced there was no snow
at Badger and reservations could he
canceled. Papers said 24 inches at
Sugar Bowl and light snow falling
al Yosemite Saturday night. But
lid heavy, sustained snowfall was in
sight anywhere. Such a situation is
disconcerting to Farm skiers and
"snow bunnies" who are anxious to
"fiit the boards."
When there is snow, Stanford's
favorite ski area is Yosemite if the
number of skiers is an indication of
popularity. Yosemite is a sort of
headquarters lor the Stanford Ski
Club, and the club maintains reser
vations for 125 skiers every week
end until March 28.
Skiers stay in Yosemite Valley
either at the Camp Curry dormitory
or in the cabins near the Yosemite
Lodge, and drive up to Badger Pass,
about 40 minutes away. Ample
parking space is to be found at
Badger. Traffic and parking are su
pervised by National Park Rangers.
Al the ski but skis can be rented
and equipment repaired. Hot meals,
sandwiches, and cokes are dis
pensed; the tables on the huge sun
deck are usually crowded during
the noon hour. Sometimes toll:
dancers put on a show.
Free ski lessons are the prize of

the first .'{() members to show up at ;
the Stanford Ski Club sign at Badg- {
er Pass each weekend. Allison Ait
ken, Ski Club secretary, said she
hopes that the number of free les
sons can be increased to 50. Bill
Cahow heads the ski school.
A Constam T-Bar lift and several
rope tows lift skiers to the slopes.
There are all types of runs for ev
eryone on the boards from begin
ners to champions.
Joanne Whittier, vice-president in !
charge of reservations for the Ski j
Club, posts a snow report for the I
Badger area on the Nitery bulletin
board every Wednesday. Snow re- ,
ports from other* areas may be oh-j
tained from Smith's on the Circle
or the California State Automobile
Association.
After a hard day's skiing, Farm '
snow enthusiasts travel back to the I
Valley for hot showers and hot but- '
tered rums. At night they go to the j
Ahwahnee Hotel to watch the lire- 1
fall and to dance. Last year ski din- |

ner.s were hold on Friday night at
the hotel; reservations were avail
able to Ski Club members who cut
Friday classes in order to arrive by
8 o'clock. On Saturday nights the
hotel sponsored a dance for the
nominal fee of 30 cents with an or
chestra and 25 cents with the juke
box.
Rising prices have cut into the
sport as in everything else; not
deeply, howevi r. Prices for accom
modations at Yosemite have been
raised to $1.50 a night, Food costs
run from very low at the cafeteria
and the Greasy Spoon to rather
high at the Ahwahnee Hotel.
Some Farm skiers bead for Ne
vada and the Mt. Rose Bowl. There
accommodations may be had on the
American plan at the Tavern, just
across the road from the Bowl.
Most "/skiers, however, stay in mo
tels in and about Reno, preferring
to drive up in the morning for a
day's skiing, then roar down at
night for a gay evening on the town

in the ''Biggest Little City in the
World."
Other snow - seekers drive up
Highway 40 to the Sugar Bowl,
Soda Springs, and the Sierra Club's
Norden. Sugar Bowl has a chair lift
and rope tows; Soda Springs, about
four miles west, has rope tows.
Accommodations can be secured
for varying prices at ski lodges all
the way from Emigrant Gap to
Donner Summit.
The newest ski service is "Air
ways Ski Tours." At present only
Sunday round trips to Mt. Rose
are scheduled, leaving Oakland at
8 a.m. and returning at 11:30 p.m.
Weekend tours are planned later.
When spring vacation rolls around
skiers will travel far afield to Utah,
Idaho, and Colorado ski areas. Sun
Valley accommodations were re
served long ago, but there remain
Alta, Utah, and Aspen, Colorado.
Sun Valley is tops according to
skiers who have been there. The
town was built for skiers and winter
sports fans exclusively. Chair lifts
carry the skiing .vacationists hijdi up
the mountains lor long runs down
open slopes. Instruction is included
in the cost of accommodations. The
ski school is headed by Tony Matt.
For those who are distressed by
the lack of reservations at Sun Val
ley, experienced skiers offer Alia,
Utah, as a good, if not better, al
ternative. The area is 20 miles, or
a half-hour drive from Salt. Lake
City where the usual hotel and mo
tel accommodations are available.
Excellent skiing is reported. There
are better snow conditions and
steeper hills, the old - timers say.
Three chair lifts and seven tows
operate. Slopes are relatively open.
Aspen is a newly developed area,
formerly an old mining town. The
ski school there is under the joint
direction of Friedl Priefer, Fred Ise
-1 in, and Percy Rideout. The old
ghost town was resurrected as a ski
town and the Sun Valley type of
accommodations is available. Aspen
is a favorite ol Dick Durrance,
Olympic speed champion.

Valley for hot showers and hot but- '
tered rums. At night they go to the j
Ahwahnee Hotel to watch the lire- 1
fall and to dance. Last year ski din- |

ner.s were hold on Friday night at
the hotel; reservations were avail
able to Ski Club members who cut
Friday classes in order to arrive by
8 o'clock. On Saturday nights the
hotel sponsored a dance for the
nominal fee of 30 cents with an or
chestra and 25 cents with the juke
box.
Rising prices have cut into the
sport as in everything else; not
deeply, howevi r. Prices for accom
modations at Yosemite have been
raised to $1.50 a night, Food costs
run from very low at the cafeteria
and the Greasy Spoon to rather
high at the Ahwahnee Hotel.
Some Farm skiers bead for Ne
vada and the Mt. Rose Bowl. There
accommodations may be had on the
American plan at the Tavern, just
across the road from the Bowl.
Most "/skiers, however, stay in mo
tels in and about Reno, preferring
to drive up in the morning for a
day's skiing, then roar down at
night for a gay evening on the town

in the ''Biggest Little City in the
World."
Other snow - seekers drive up
Highway 40 to the Sugar Bowl,
Soda Springs, and the Sierra Club's
Norden. Sugar Bowl has a chair lift
and rope tows; Soda Springs, about
four miles west, has rope tows.
Accommodations can be secured
for varying prices at ski lodges all
the way from Emigrant Gap to
Donner Summit.
The newest ski service is "Air
ways Ski Tours." At present only
Sunday round trips to Mt. Rose
are scheduled, leaving Oakland at
8 a.m. and returning at 11:30 p.m.
Weekend tours are planned later.
When spring vacation rolls around
skiers will travel far afield to Utah,
Idaho, and Colorado ski areas. Sun
Valley accommodations were re
served long ago, but there remain
Alta, Utah, and Aspen, Colorado.
Sun Valley is tops according to
skiers who have been there. The
town was built for skiers and winter
sports fans exclusively. Chair lifts
carry the skiing .vacationists hijdi up
the mountains lor long runs down
open slopes. Instruction is included
in the cost of accommodations. The
ski school is headed by Tony Matt.
For those who are distressed by
the lack of reservations at Sun Val
ley, experienced skiers offer Alia,
Utah, as a good, if not better, al
ternative. The area is 20 miles, or
a half-hour drive from Salt. Lake
City where the usual hotel and mo
tel accommodations are available.
Excellent skiing is reported. There
are better snow conditions and
steeper hills, the old - timers say.
Three chair lifts and seven tows
operate. Slopes are relatively open.
Aspen is a newly developed area,
formerly an old mining town. The
ski school there is under the joint
direction of Friedl Priefer, Fred Ise
-1 in, and Percy Rideout. The old
ghost town was resurrected as a ski
town and the Sun Valley type of
accommodations is available. Aspen
is a favorite ol Dick Durrance,
Olympic speed champion.
