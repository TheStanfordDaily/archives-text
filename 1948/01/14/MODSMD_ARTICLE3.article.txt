WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP).â€”
Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P.
Anderson today said that price ceil
ings may be restored in the United
States. He told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee it will be for
purely domestic reasons, not bc

| cause of food gifts to Europe.
Anderson argued with the com
{ mittee for speedy approval of the
European recovery program. He
thought food rationing, especially
; of meat, may become an urgent ne
cessity by spring.
Secretary of the Interior J. A.
j Krug, who followed Anderson to
the stand, agreed with him that do
mestic rather than export demands
| were the principal reason for cur
! rent shortages in this country.
Anderson suggested that the Sen-
I atoi - s' wives, and the rest of the
j country's housewives, might be well
; advised to start brushing up now
on the ration - coupon techniques
they used during the war.
Anderson insisted that right now
it looks as if meat supplies will
drop this spring to a low of about
120 to 125 pounds per person an
nually.
He added that rationing might
work without price ceilings, but he
thought the system would be "bet
ter" with price controls.
He said the potential effect of
Plan food exports to the
16 Western European nations co
operating in the program had been
exaggerated.
