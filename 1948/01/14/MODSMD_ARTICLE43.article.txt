# Flu Situation Stays Static
## 
### 
Farm influenza remained static
yesterday as the feared epidemic
failed to materialize. Dr. George H.
Houck, director of the Health Serv
ice, stated, "This situation delights
me exceedingly." He further said,
"If things are in order by Friday
we will relax considerably."
Immunization given last week is
beginning to take effect now. By
Friday, over half the University will
be immune to influenza.
There are six cases of flu in the
Rest Homes at the present time.
These cases arrived with the disease
from Los Angeles. Immunization
continues at the Health Service for
those who want it, but the number
receiving these infections has fallen
far below last week's total.
Dr. Houck started the immuniza
tion program last week when he
feared the possible spread of the
epidemic from Southern California.
