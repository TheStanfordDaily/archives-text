# BODY AND SOUL
## Garfield Turns Prizefighter In New Hollywood Production 
### JACKIE MILNOR 
"Body and Soul," (lie story of a
prizefighter's rise to fame ;>nd the
attempts of the "good women" in
his life to keep him honest, is a pic
ture worth seeing.
The photography is excellent. The
moral, while typically Hollywood, is
well told. And it's a lot of fun to
watch.
The final prize-fight sequence is
one of the most exciting movie bits
seen in a long time. John Garfield
as the champ fights for the title and
for honor; the audience fights with
him, and it's a great relief when he
decides to be honorable. Whether
his decision comes too late or not
gives the scene .*t double suspense.
One criticism. The happy ending
didn't seem too logical. Evidently
Hollywood believes (hat virtue will
always triumph, no matter how
.strong the wicked are in the middle
of the picture. The producers spent
the majority of the picture showing

him getting enmeshed in the grips
of evil, and the happy ending was
accomplished in five minutes.
Probably Hazel Brooks, a new
comer who plays the sultry singer,
represents the "body," and Lilli
Palmer, Garfield's honest woman,
the "soul" of the picture's title. All
I can say is that he had a pretty
good time with Hazel.
"Body and Soul" is now playing
at the Stanford Theater in Palo
Alto.
