# 'Spring' Training Starts For Stanford Baseballers
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Once again the familiar sound of wood meeting leather echoes
from the depths of Stanford's historic Sunken Diamond -once
again a Cardinal baseball season is getting under way.
Head Coach Harry Wolter almost beat the swallows south this
winter by starting his "spring" training in early January, and the

squad should be ready and willing to
go by the time the first league game
rolls around.
At present over fifty veterans and
rookies can be seen working rusty
legs and batting eyes into shape and
thawing out cold throwing arms. As
sisting Coach Wolter with the team
is Ray Hammett, who held down the
Indian first base post from 1940 to
1943.
ONLY TWO LOST
Experience seems to be the key
word to any success the Farm dia
monders may have this year. Only
two lettermen from last year's team
have left, and the 1948 aggregation

Two sophomore baseball manag
ers are needed for this season, an
nounces Coach Harry Wolter. Any
one interested should see Wolter
at his oflicc or at the Sunken Dia
mond in the afternoon.

has been strongly bolstered by trans
fers and rookies up from last year's
JV team.
The two missing members from
last year, however, will be sorely
missed. All-Coast Catcher Ward
Walkup and his ,400-plus batting
average are gone, as is centerfielder
Lloyd Merriman. Merriman also
made All-Coast and was signed by
the Cincinnati Reds.
Starting around the infield at first
base a four-way battle is taking
place for the starting position. Let
terman Ben Cardinally Dude Angius,
Bill Freeland, and transfer Chuck
Cole are the fighting four.
FOUK KEYSTONERS
At the second sack there is an
other dog fight with pepper-pot Bob
Peters, Myles Chute, and Jim Mason
Irom Menlo JC topping the prospects.
Buck Brownson, smooth fielding
short pateher, should hold down that
position as he did last year, and his
capable understudy Shorty Viole will
also be on hand.
Over at the hot corner we find
Bill Arce, the man with the rifle
arm, returning to the post he handled
last year. Goiter Bob Rosburg, who
can really lee off on a baseball as
well as a golf ball, is a good bet to
be the number one utility man.
NELL HEADS OUTFIELD
Drifting to the outfield there are
long ball hitter Clyde Dingfelder,
who proved his batting prowess last
year, Ted Nell, last year's regular
second sacker, and transfer Bob Nava
from SFJC.
There seems to be no shortage of
backstoppers as a total of seven have
turned out for the behind-the-plate
job. F rank MacGraw, who hits 'em
far so he won't have to run. is back
for his third year. Footballer Jack
Barnes should also see his share of
action. Conde, Stilson, Carlson, Phil
lips, and Ahlquist compose the rest
of the list.
On the hill there appears to be no
shortage of ch tickers either. The right
and left handed Daves, Stott and
Dahle, are back again. This duo
should give the team plenty of po
tency in the hurling department.
JAVVEE CIIUCKER
Up from the JV's is right-hander
Frank La√ürum, who won two prac
tice games for the varsity last sea
son, and Dick Flat land is also on
hand.
Mystery man of the mound is
Charlie Bell, who comes to the Farm
with an impressive record establish
ed at Fullerton JC.
Last year's team finished three
places behind the Champion Cali
lornia Bears with a seven won and
eight lost record in league play. Cal
ifornia then went on to win the Na
tional Coilegiate Baseball Champion
ship by defeating Yale.
HEARS TEAM TO BEAT
Against the Bears, Stanford won
one and dropped two. Coach Clint
Evans' Bears with John Fiscalini and
Company will probably be the team
to beat again this year. If Stanford's
hitting and fielding holds tip better
this year, the squad should have a
good chance at the league crown.
USC will probably be strong, as
usual, although they have lost a
number of men. Wally Hood on the
mound and Chuck Workman in the
outfield make the Trojans dangerous.
UCLA also has lost a number of
starters, and Santa Clara and St.
Mary's, the other two conference
members, will probably be stronger
than last year.
Questioned as to the team's chanc

es, Coach V/olter said, "'We'll cause
trouble, is all I'll say." But the
twinkle in his eye seemed to say,
' "Watch out. Another Cardinal team
is in the making."


TED NELL, who divided his time
between second base and right
field last year, will probably be
one of the Stanford nine's starting
outfielders this spring.
