Now that Stanford is a member of the Na
tional Students Association the big problem is
the formation of the local organization.
Ginny Titus, temporarily Stanford NSA
chairman and also a member of Excom, has out
lined a tentative campus organizational plan.
One point of the plan which was debated at
last week's Excom meeting concerned the status
of the permanent NSA chairman after he is
chosen.
Should he be a member of Excom? Or
should he be entirely removed from campus
government?
Miss Titus favored an ex-officio capacity
for the NSA chairman. Several Excom members
disagreed. They saw no reason for his being
on Excom.
The NSA chairman will be called upon to
represent Stanford at regional and national

conventions. He will be called upon to speak
and his words will be considered as represent
ing Stanford.
His local work will necessitate close cooper
ation with existing ASSU offices and officials.
Excom is the central student group. All things
concerning the ASSU eventually pass under
Excom surveillance.
How will the NSA chairman be able to
either adeguately represent Stanford off the
campus or even do a good job on campus
unless he is a part of the existing student legis
lature?
If Stanford is to gain the full benefit of NSA
the chairman must be given at least an ex-officio
seat on Excom.
Any other procedure would be highly det
rimental to the ASSU and perhaps lead to the
downfall of the local NSA group.
