# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
willi sincerest apologies to archie the cockroach
and his good friend mehitabel i would like to make
an explanation to the coca-cola company
last quarter i used the word coke in an article and
almost as last, as you can flunk western civ i got a
letter from their company office in atlanta
thanks they said for using the word coke this is
free advertising and we like it but said they coke is a
trade-mark and like all trade-marks deserves a capi
tal e and not a little e the way i spelled it
the letter was signed julius r lunsford jr and it
was so courteous and complimentary that it should
have been signed pierre
so courteous it was that i feel obligated to send
julius an explanation
you see julius the Stanford daily is just one big
racketeering outfit i know i open myself to libel
charges but every penny made through the publica
tion of the Stanford daily eventually finds its way into
the corrupt pockets of john pool business manager
and george caulfield editor it is rumored that in good
years these two top men often show a profit of as much
as ten to fifteen dollars
consequently no funds ever go into the buying of
new typewriters and there is one typewriter which
has no shift key and hence no capitals i suppose r
shouldnt complain—it has a ribbon in it which is more
than some of the other machines do nevertheless it is

that machine which is responsible for the absence of
the capital c in the word coke im sorry julius
what amazes me is the thoroughness with which the
coca-cola company checks publications for its name
either they re egotistical as hell or they got a fine
clipping service if i had known they were going to
have such super salesmen i would have bought in
when coca-cola was four bits a share you know
what a super-salesman is—thats a man who can ex
plain to his wife how hairpins got on the back seat
of the car when all she uses is bobby pins
when john pemberton first invented the stuff he j
sold only 25 gallons in the first year of production j
now they got more vice-presidents than stockholders
it takes two years for a good joke to get from the i
president back to the president again even the vice- |
presidents have got vice-presidents you cant beat an
outfit like that these soft drink companies are getting ;
so big that you have to be a psychologist before you
can go to work for them
despite this overpowering organization the price of
the product is simplicity itself whiskey costs 50 times
as much as coca-cola and some people will sacrifice
anything for economy
well anyway as they say from alaslca to pakistan
have a coke have a coke have a coke
and thanks for the letter julius it was the biggest
thing since pepsi-cola
