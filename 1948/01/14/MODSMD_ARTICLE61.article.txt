### GEORGE BRUNN 
I
Eleven months before the elections the campaigns
arc well under way. All statements by politicians now
look toward the second Tuesday in November when
40 to 50 million more or less bewildered people will
step to the polls.
It is apparent from Truman's demands for across
the-board tax cuts, expanded social security, controls
to stop inflation, federal aid to education, and health
insurance, that the Democrats will try once again to
don the mantle of progress.
The GOP on the other hand is expected to rely on
its tried il not always true technique of yelling "New
Deal bureaucrats," "government interference with free
enterprise," and, should these not suffice, "Commu
nists." â€¢
While the Men from Missouri will try to prove that
they are all for social justice (hoping, incidentally, that
this will draw votes away from Wallace who has them
seriously worried), the Republicans will take the po
sition. as in '44. that, the Demo ideas are dangerously
radical and that they, too, are squarely in favor of
social justice. They will point to the allegedly vast
grain speculation profits by administration "insiders"
and to the fact that it was a Republican Congress that
gave the nation its first balanced budget sindfe the
depression.
it's an old game. The music has been a little re
arranged; the melody is pretty much the same. The
people may well wonder what all the shouting is
about. For certainly the differences between the two
parties seem slight.
Disagreement on foreign policy and military train
ing is not divided along party lines. The Southern
Democrat can hardly be distinguished from his Yankee
GOP colleague. In many cities, such as Philadelphia,
and in some stales, such as Montana, the leadership
of the two has for years approached identity, at least,
on the top level. In Chicago the two formed a coa-

lit ion last year to combat a strong threat to their
supremacy by a citizenry disgusted with years ol
municipal corruption.
Their respective platfoms have for a long time been I
almost indistinguishable and so have their main I
sources of financial support. Many years ago a famous
Englishman commented that we do, in fact, have a
two-party system: the ins and the outs.
So far, artificially exaggerated differences have
managed to convince most of the people most ol the
time they have a real and important choice to make, i
There are indications that their gullibility is declining, .
that they are no longer altogether happy about the j
politicians who, whether under the symbol of the j
mule or of the elephant, say "I'm against inflation, I'm i
against deflation, I'm for flatibn."
Wallace, ridiculed, abused, denounced, expresses i
this as yet vaguely felt desire to strike out in a new j
direction. He will be no threat in November. He has
no machine, no money, no support in press and radio.
Communist backing (which he shall probably de
nounce) counts as two strikes against him.
He himself knows this best of all. He doesn't ex
pect to win this year. He hopes to do two things: get
an impressive protest vote and lay the groundwork \
for an organization that will make him a powerful
candidate in '52.
Wallace himself you may laugh at. The forces
behind him you cannot ignore. If you shrug them off |
as mere discontent or Communist trouble-making, you |
will be in for a rude awakening. They are the begin- ;
ning of a new era in American politics, an era in ,
which, for better or worse, voting will be divided j
more along class lines, in which the little guys will
contest the traditional concept of politics as the art
of promising the rich and the poor to protect them
from each other.
