### 
HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 13 (UP)—Producer Samuel
Goldwyn today threw rocks at the movie industry,
branding it a "chaotic" business so far on its last legs
that only atv honest house-cleaning can save it.
"Motion pictures are facing disaster." the shiny
domed pioneer producer predicted, "unless the quality
of pictures is doubled and costs cut in half."
"Instead of writing in a lot of fancy sets," he sug
gested, "write in a few simple ones. After all, the story
is the thing that counts. Movies, plays, books have
proved that."
Goldwyn wants to sell Americanism, "the greatest
thing in the world," to the Americans and to "those
iron curtain countries."
"Pictures are ten times as good as the 'Voice of
America" broadcasts," he said. And he's not afraid to
lash out at producers who don't sell America.
CiOLPW YN A "KEIJEL"
"They won't listen to my statement with open arms."
he said in bis famous Goldwyn style. "I said it last
year and they criticized me. I was just a year ahead.
Well, tins time I'm two years ahead. I'm not afraid.
I'm a rebel, you know."
'it is a startling indictment of our industry," he
went 011, "that with employment throughout the United
States at its highest in history, box office receipts have
been going down."
And there's only one way, he says, to start those
cash registers jingling again.
devolution aky changes
"We must have a completely revolutionary change

in our methods and objectives." Goldwyn recommend
ed. "Inefficiency must be rooted out in high places
as well as in all other ranks."
By cutting costs, Goldwyn explained, he didn t
mean slicing the price of finished movies to theater
owners.
"I have no sympathy whatever for the crocodile
tears of exhibitors about high film rentals,' he said.
"Their theaters are only as valuable as the cans of
film they get. The sooner exhibitors start encourag
ing—rather than discouraging—the making of good
pictures by paying fair film rentals the better off
everybody will be."
Competitive bidding for movies, added the pro
ducer who has no releasing organization of his own
movies, is one way to balance things up. It would,
lie said, break the stranglehold held by a few com
panies on the exhibition market.
BItEAK UP MONOPOLIES
"There should be people to make the movies and
separate people to distribute them," he said. "Break
up all the monopolistic circuits. They shouldn't have
the power to stifle and eliminate competition and
dictate terms on an 'or else' basis.
"We need greatness- not mediocrity in production.
But we will never have it as long as exhibition re
mains primarily a closed field."
"But we have to get good private relations first,
he added "Let us put our own house in order then
win the genuine good will of the public.'

HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 13 (UP)—Producer Samuel
Goldwyn today threw rocks at the movie industry,
branding it a "chaotic" business so far on its last legs
that only atv honest house-cleaning can save it.
"Motion pictures are facing disaster." the shiny
domed pioneer producer predicted, "unless the quality
of pictures is doubled and costs cut in half."
"Instead of writing in a lot of fancy sets," he sug
gested, "write in a few simple ones. After all, the story
is the thing that counts. Movies, plays, books have
proved that."
Goldwyn wants to sell Americanism, "the greatest
thing in the world," to the Americans and to "those
iron curtain countries."
"Pictures are ten times as good as the 'Voice of
America" broadcasts," he said. And he's not afraid to
lash out at producers who don't sell America.
CiOLPW YN A "KEIJEL"
"They won't listen to my statement with open arms."
he said in bis famous Goldwyn style. "I said it last
year and they criticized me. I was just a year ahead.
Well, tins time I'm two years ahead. I'm not afraid.
I'm a rebel, you know."
'it is a startling indictment of our industry," he
went 011, "that with employment throughout the United
States at its highest in history, box office receipts have
been going down."
And there's only one way, he says, to start those
cash registers jingling again.
devolution aky changes
"We must have a completely revolutionary change

in our methods and objectives." Goldwyn recommend
ed. "Inefficiency must be rooted out in high places
as well as in all other ranks."
By cutting costs, Goldwyn explained, he didn t
mean slicing the price of finished movies to theater
owners.
"I have no sympathy whatever for the crocodile
tears of exhibitors about high film rentals,' he said.
"Their theaters are only as valuable as the cans of
film they get. The sooner exhibitors start encourag
ing—rather than discouraging—the making of good
pictures by paying fair film rentals the better off
everybody will be."
Competitive bidding for movies, added the pro
ducer who has no releasing organization of his own
movies, is one way to balance things up. It would,
lie said, break the stranglehold held by a few com
panies on the exhibition market.
BItEAK UP MONOPOLIES
"There should be people to make the movies and
separate people to distribute them," he said. "Break
up all the monopolistic circuits. They shouldn't have
the power to stifle and eliminate competition and
dictate terms on an 'or else' basis.
"We need greatness- not mediocrity in production.
But we will never have it as long as exhibition re
mains primarily a closed field."
"But we have to get good private relations first,
he added "Let us put our own house in order then
win the genuine good will of the public.'
