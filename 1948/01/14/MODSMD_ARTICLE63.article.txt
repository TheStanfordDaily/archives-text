# Stanford Transforms Dreams Into Transcontinental Railroad

j (This is the lirst in a series
j of articles oil Leland Stanford's
greatest achievement—the build
ing of the first transcontinental
| railroad.)
A transcontinental railroad
had been the dream of Western
men for three-score years be
fore the first shovel of earth was
turned for the Central Pacific
on January 8, 1863, by Gover
nor Leland Stanford. But the
translation of dreams into steel
! rails across hundreds of miles
of mountains and waste lands
j required men of courage and
vision. Such a man was Leland
Stanford.
The building of the first trans- |
continental railroad is one of his
greatest achievements -- although j
his connection with the railroad is j
frequently overlooked. He is more |
often remembered for the Univer
sity that perpetuates hi.s name, a >
memorial to bis son Leland Jr.
j JIJDAII APPOINTED AGENT
While Stanford was active in the
Central Pacific from the beginning,
the first fire under the project was
lighted by T. D. Judah, later chief J
engineer of the company. Judah
j came to California in 1854 as engi
neer for the Sacramento Valley
Railroad in the construction ol its
line from Folsom to Sacramento,
j The idea of a transcontinental
road was an obsession with him and j
from 1856 to 1861 he lobbied in
Washington for federal aid for the
project. In 1859 Judah was appoint
ed the agent of the Railroad Con- j
ventioh of the states of California, j
Oregon, Washington, and Arizona.
Judah's work in Washington up j
to the summer of 1860 was fruitless. I
I In July of that year he and Dr. D.
W. Strong of Dutch Flat explored |
the route which was eventually j
adopted for the Central Pacific Rail
! road, up the divide between the j
; North Fork of the American River j
on the south and the Bear River in |
the north.
MOUNTAIN PASS DISCOVERED
Articles of association for a rail
road company were drawn up by I
Judah, but he could not obtain stock I
subscriptions. Dubious San Fran- j
: cLsco capitalists turned the idea I
down cold. Disappointed, he went i
back to Sacramento- and that is
where "Stanford and Company," i
better known as "The Big Four,"
I came into the picture.
Judah told Stanford that he had
discovered a pass over the mountain
j where a railroad could be built.
| Stanford liked the idea. With J
Charles Crocker, Collis P. Hunting- !
ton, Mark Hopkins, Judah, and \
James Bailey, Stanford raised mon- !
ey enough to pay for more explora
tions.
After receiving reports from Ju
dah's surveys, the associates formed
a company, the certificate of incor
poration being filed on June 28,
1861. This was some time before
j Judah had completed his surveys
and was not without political sig- :
nificance. Leland Stanford had been
nominated as the Republican can- j
didate for Governor nine days be- 1
j fore.
The Republican party and the j
, railroad were intimately associated.
I The railroad was the party program, j
and was expected to rally support to |
the party. Stanford's associates were i
aware of the advantages of having
the company headed by the Gover
j nor of California.
CONSTRUCTION AID SECURED
Again Judah went to Washington j
j to secure aid for the construction of \
\ a Pacific railroad. This time he was
j successful. President Lincoln signed |
! the Pacific Railroad Bill on July 2,
J 1862. One reason for the speedy
i passage of the bill by Congress was
j that the Civil War was on, and the |
Pacific Raiiroad was considered a
j necessity for national security.
The original act of 1862 created j
j the Union Pacific Railroad Com- j
| pany to build westwardly from the j
' Missouri River, and authorized the
| Central Pacific Railroad Company j
to start at or near San Francisco or j
I some point on the navigable waters j
I of the Sacramento River and build 1
j eastwardly to the boundary of Cali- j
fornia, and to continue construction j
until meeting the line of the Union !
Pacific.

In addition to a land grant of 10
sections per mile, the Central Pacific
was to receive a loan of government
bonds to the amount of $16,000 per
mile to the western base of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, thence
for 150 miles over the mountains at
the rate of $48,000 per mile, thence
easterly between the Sierra Nevada
and the Rocky Mountains at the
rate of $.'12,000 per mile.
PROVISIONS LIBERALIZED
The Central Pacific Company, in
a letter dated November 1, 1862, ex
pressed its formal acceptance of the
provisions of the act; but the Union
Pacific made no headway for two
years. No capitalists were willing
to back the enterprise under the
conditions imposed by the act of
1802, and it was not until these pro
visions were liberalized by the
mandatory act of 18(54 that a start
was made at the eastern end.
The original act required that 50
miles of the road be constructed
within two years of the acceptance
of the terms of the act, and 50 miles
per year thereafter until completion.
Under the new act another year was
allowed for the first 50 miles.
RAILROAD ISSUES BONDS
But the real salvation of the
Central Pacific was that the govern
ment permitted its bonds to become
subordinate to the bonds to be
issued by the railroad companies
themselves. The railroad then could
issue bonds which would be secured
by a first lien on the property, while
the government loan would be se
cured only by a second mortgage.
The farther west the President
placed the western base of the Sier
ras, the greater advantage to the
builders, since bonds at triple rate
would be issued. President Lincoln
obligingly moved the Sierra range

i 24 miles to the west on recommen
; dation of Prof. J. D. Whitney, state
geologist.
After passage of the Railroad Act
of 1802, and the guarantees of gov
| eminent aid, Stanforil and the pro
| moters of the railroad seemed to
' anticipate little difficulty in raising
I funds to get the project under way,
j especially since at the Railroad
! Convention of 1859 California had
■ agreed that it should advance 15
J million dollars for the Pacific Rail
j road. But stock sales went slowly
in Sacramento and not at all in San
Francisco.
