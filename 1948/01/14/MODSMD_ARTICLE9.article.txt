## 
### 
Men's Council, in a meeting held
yesterday, reviewed an Honor Code
case in which the defendant was
I accused of plagiarism in a report for
! Economics 245. The council rc
j turned a verdict of guilty.
The defendant, who had pleaded
that he failed to note certain pas
sages in his report as being quoted
because of time limitations, was
sentenced to two quarters of social
probation. In addition, he will re
ceive an F in the course.
Council members Jim Welch
(chairman), Fred Hannum, and Lo
ren Smith refrained from imposing
| a more serious sentence only be
j cause the defendant had been tak
ing 19 units of work while working
j in San Francisco on weekends and
thus had comparatively little time
to prepare his work.
