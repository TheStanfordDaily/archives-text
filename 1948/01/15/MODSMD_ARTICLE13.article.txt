BERLIN, Jan. 14 (UP) —Gen. Lucius D. Clay, U. S. Commander-in-
Chief, said tonight that he was in Berlin as the agent of a country with
"immeasurable strength" and that he intended to remain here "with no
fears and no nerves" despite any Russian pressure to oust the western
allies.
Clay showed clearly that he will not be frightened by any threats.
His calm confidence was reflected by all American military government
officers, from highest to the lowest.
United States authorities feel that if the United States pulled out of
Berlin the position in such spots as Trieste, Greece, Turkey and Iran
would become more shaky and at the same time more dangerous. Great
Britain and France would be forced out of Berlin if the United States were.
As Clay made his statement allied authorities bared a purported Com
munist plot—asserted to have the backing of Russia— to sabotage the
Marshall Plan by a carefully blue-printed series of strikes in Western
German industrial areas.
The strikes would be carried out under Communist control but the
Communists would remain in the background while walkouts crippled
rail and other transport services.
The State Department today gave its unqualified support lo Gen. Lucius
D. Clay in resisting Russian suggestions that the Americans and British
get out of Berlin. Undersecretary of State Robert A. Lovett told a press
conference that the United States and Britain are starting talks with the
French in Berlin on their plans to set up a new economic administration
in Western Gcrmany---one of the sore points which led the Russians to
hint that the Western Allies had worn out their welcome in Berlin.
