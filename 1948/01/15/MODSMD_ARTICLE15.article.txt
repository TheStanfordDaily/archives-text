# Smokers Warned By Chief Marston
## 
### 
Students were again reminded to
day by Fire Chief John Marston that
! it is against university regulations to
i smoke in the class rooms.
Chief Marston added that a par
i ticularly acute situation would be
; created at this time by the loss of
any class rooms since such a great
! demand is made upon all university
| facilities.
Marston warned that any fires in
the Quad would not only be ex
tremely troublesome to the Fire De
partment but they would also be cs
| pcciaUy dangerous since they are
quite likely to smolder for hours.
He urged students to smoke only in
those areas where it is permitted.
