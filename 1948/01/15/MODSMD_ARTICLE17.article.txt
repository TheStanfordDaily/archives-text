# BUSINESS IS RUSHING
## Fraternity Men, Rushees Recover from Hectic Open Houses; Face Trials of Invitational Meals 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Stanford's 24 fraternities look
ed a little out of form last Tues
day and Thursday nights. Mag
azines were stacked neatly on
j shelves, there were no card
games anywhere, and the bro
thers themselves were dressed
in suits and ties, although the
Dekes as usual wore Levi's.
The occasion was the last of the
open houses for prospective fratern
ity men before the serious program
of rushing gets under way. And now
it's a hectic period of lunches and
dinners, and a sorting of letters from
all over the country recommending
Roger Hailfellow as a great guy, ex
cellent "lota Supa" material, and,
besides that his old man is loaded.
SIG ALPHAS CLEAN HOUSE
Out on the front porch of the SAE
house last Thursday morning was
the whole menagerie of dining room
furniture and inside were the Sig
Alphas turning to with mops and
dust rags, as rushees are supposedly
impressed with clean, wholesome
surroundings.
Up and down the Row that night
was the customary shaking of hands,

I the usually futile attempts to recall
! mutual acquaintances in the old
j home town, and a mob of several
| hundred freshmen wondei ing if
they looked as ill at ease as they
j felt.
Asked why they want to belong
1 to a fraternity, the rushccs' answers
range from the customary "I'd like
to get in with a good bunch of con-
I genial guys" to the practical, if not
diplomatic, "Why walk in from the
I Village" Some, of course, are lega
cies whose fathers and grandfathers
! were Cigma Chi's at old Miami U.,
and are determined that Wildred 111
will also learn the words to the
"Sweetheart Song."
EACH HOUSE HAS (iOOI) POINTS
Exclusive attractions in most of
the houses give each one a drawing
card that none of the others can
claim. These are used to impress im
pressionable frosh.
At the SAE house it was a state
, ment in a pamphlet distributed by
1 the boys which declared that the
1 SAE's with $5,000,000 worth of as
sets, are the wealthiest fraternity
I alive.
At the Phi Dolt palace it was a
| galaxy of immortal Stanfordites with
! photographs of such luminaries as
Norm Standlee, Ted Schroeder, and
Bobby Grayson displayed on the

walls of the lounge. The Fiji's told
of their famous Fiji Island dance of
last year and the Sigma Nu's related
the legends revolving around their
"baby dance."
The Zetes and the Dekes and the
DU's, as can be expected, had a
whole houseful of baby giants, none
of them under six feet two and 210
pounds.
PI I LEG ER—REAL OR FICTION?
At the Beta house there was at
least one vistior who is a tremen
dous admirer of men who play foot
ball.
"I'd like to sec Dutch Phleger," he
announced upon entering the house.
"Dutch isn't in right now," they
told him.
"Oh," he said, and left.
Later he returned and asked again
for Phleger.
"Dutch doesn't seem to be around
right now," they assured him once
more.
The freshman, they say, looked ir
ritated.
"Humph," he said, and hasn't
shov/n up since.
SOME TOO PARTICULAR
Some fraternity men will advise
you not to he too particular about
what to expect from a house. The
story is told of a freshman in last

year's group of prospective pledges
who, after asking innumerable ques
tions about the house, its members,
and its reputation, wanted to be as
sured that there would always be
space in the garage for his car if lie
joined.
This was too much for some of
the boys. Leading him onto the front
porch some of them engaged him in
conversation while the others dashed
upstairs. Seconds later and the su
per-fastidious frosh had just exper
ienced his first water-bagging. The
brothers thought it was a darned
good gag.
PRESSURE TO EASE JAN. 30
A common sight during the next
two weeks will be groups of men
! in Encina and the Village weighing
the merits of the various fraterni
| ties, and the boys in the houses dis
cussing the qualities of potential
j members.
Come the 31st of this month, the
date of formal pledging, and it's all
over for another year. Rush captains
: will have time again to do a little
studying and have the privilege of
growling a nasty "What's good about
it?" to smiling freshmen if they wake
up with a headache in the morning.
Rushing, they will tell you, can get
j a little tiresome sometimes.

least one vistior who is a tremen
dous admirer of men who play foot
ball.
"I'd like to sec Dutch Phleger," he
announced upon entering the house.
"Dutch isn't in right now," they
told him.
"Oh," he said, and left.
Later he returned and asked again
for Phleger.
"Dutch doesn't seem to be around
right now," they assured him once
more.
The freshman, they say, looked ir
ritated.
"Humph," he said, and hasn't
shov/n up since.
SOME TOO PARTICULAR
Some fraternity men will advise
you not to he too particular about
what to expect from a house. The
story is told of a freshman in last

year's group of prospective pledges
who, after asking innumerable ques
tions about the house, its members,
and its reputation, wanted to be as
sured that there would always be
space in the garage for his car if lie
joined.
This was too much for some of
the boys. Leading him onto the front
porch some of them engaged him in
conversation while the others dashed
upstairs. Seconds later and the su
per-fastidious frosh had just exper
ienced his first water-bagging. The
brothers thought it was a darned
good gag.
PRESSURE TO EASE JAN. 30
A common sight during the next
two weeks will be groups of men

the merits of the various fraterni

cussing the qualities of potential
j members.
Come the 31st of this month, the
date of formal pledging, and it's all
over for another year. Rush captains
: will have time again to do a little
studying and have the privilege of
growling a nasty "What's good about
it?" to smiling freshmen if they wake
up with a headache in the morning.
Rushing, they will tell you, can get
j a little tiresome sometimes.
Stanford's 24 fraternities look
ed a little out of form last Tues
day and Thursday nights. Mag
azines were stacked neatly on
j shelves, there were no card
games anywhere, and the bro
thers themselves were dressed
in suits and ties, although the
Dekes as usual wore Levi's.
The occasion was the last of the
open houses for prospective fratern
ity men before the serious program
of rushing gets under way. And now
it's a hectic period of lunches and

Roger Hailfellow as a great guy, ex

besides that his old man is loaded.
SIG ALPHAS CLEAN HOUSE
Out on the front porch of the SAE
house last Thursday morning was
the whole menagerie of dining room
furniture and inside were the Sig
Alphas turning to with mops and
dust rags, as rushees are supposedly
impressed with clean, wholesome
surroundings.
Up and down the Row that night
was the customary shaking of hands,

I the usually futile attempts to recall
! mutual acquaintances in the old
j home town, and a mob of several
| hundred freshmen wondei ing if
they looked as ill at ease as they
j felt.
Asked why they want to belong
1 to a fraternity, the rushccs' answers
range from the customary "I'd like
to get in with a good bunch of con-
I genial guys" to the practical, if not
diplomatic, "Why walk in from the
I Village" Some, of course, are lega
cies whose fathers and grandfathers
! were Cigma Chi's at old Miami U.,
and are determined that Wildred 111
will also learn the words to the
"Sweetheart Song."
EACH HOUSE HAS (iOOI) POINTS
Exclusive attractions in most of
the houses give each one a drawing
card that none of the others can
claim. These are used to impress im
pressionable frosh.
At the SAE house it was a state

1 the boys which declared that the

sets, are the wealthiest fraternity
I alive.
At the Phi Dolt palace it was a

of their famous Fiji Island dance of
last year and the Sigma Nu's related
the legends revolving around their

The Zetes and the Dekes and the

dust rags, as rushees are supposedly
impressed with clean, wholesome
surroundings.
Up and down the Row that night
was the customary shaking of hands,

I the usually futile attempts to recall
! mutual acquaintances in the old
j home town, and a mob of several

they looked as ill at ease as they
j felt.
Asked why they want to belong
1 to a fraternity, the rushccs' answers
range from the customary "I'd like
to get in with a good bunch of con-
I genial guys" to the practical, if not
diplomatic, "Why walk in from the
I Village" Some, of course, are lega
cies whose fathers and grandfathers
! were Cigma Chi's at old Miami U.,
and are determined that Wildred 111
will also learn the words to the
"Sweetheart Song."
EACH HOUSE HAS (iOOI) POINTS
Exclusive attractions in most of
the houses give each one a drawing
card that none of the others can
claim. These are used to impress im
pressionable frosh.
At the SAE house it was a state
, ment in a pamphlet distributed by
1 the boys which declared that the
1 SAE's with $5,000,000 worth of as
sets, are the wealthiest fraternity
I alive.
At the Phi Dolt palace it was a
| galaxy of immortal Stanfordites with
! photographs of such luminaries as
Norm Standlee, Ted Schroeder, and
Bobby Grayson displayed on the

walls of the lounge. The Fiji's told
of their famous Fiji Island dance of
last year and the Sigma Nu's related
the legends revolving around their
"baby dance."
The Zetes and the Dekes and the
DU's, as can be expected, had a
whole houseful of baby giants, none
of them under six feet two and 210
pounds.
PI I LEG ER—REAL OR FICTION?
At the Beta house there was at
least one vistior who is a tremen
dous admirer of men who play foot
ball.
"I'd like to sec Dutch Phleger," he
announced upon entering the house.
"Dutch isn't in right now," they
told him.
"Oh," he said, and left.
Later he returned and asked again
for Phleger.
"Dutch doesn't seem to be around
right now," they assured him once
more.
The freshman, they say, looked ir
ritated.
"Humph," he said, and hasn't
shov/n up since.
SOME TOO PARTICULAR
Some fraternity men will advise
you not to he too particular about
what to expect from a house. The
story is told of a freshman in last

year's group of prospective pledges
who, after asking innumerable ques
tions about the house, its members,
and its reputation, wanted to be as
sured that there would always be
space in the garage for his car if lie
joined.
This was too much for some of
the boys. Leading him onto the front
porch some of them engaged him in
conversation while the others dashed
upstairs. Seconds later and the su
per-fastidious frosh had just exper
ienced his first water-bagging. The
brothers thought it was a darned
good gag.
PRESSURE TO EASE JAN. 30
A common sight during the next
two weeks will be groups of men
! in Encina and the Village weighing
the merits of the various fraterni
| ties, and the boys in the houses dis
cussing the qualities of potential
j members.
Come the 31st of this month, the
date of formal pledging, and it's all
over for another year. Rush captains
: will have time again to do a little
studying and have the privilege of
growling a nasty "What's good about
it?" to smiling freshmen if they wake
up with a headache in the morning.
Rushing, they will tell you, can get
j a little tiresome sometimes.
Stanford's 24 fraternities look
ed a little out of form last Tues
day and Thursday nights. Mag
azines were stacked neatly on
j shelves, there were no card
games anywhere, and the bro
thers themselves were dressed
in suits and ties, although the
Dekes as usual wore Levi's.
The occasion was the last of the
open houses for prospective fratern
ity men before the serious program
of rushing gets under way. And now
it's a hectic period of lunches and
dinners, and a sorting of letters from
all over the country recommending
Roger Hailfellow as a great guy, ex
cellent "lota Supa" material, and,
besides that his old man is loaded.
