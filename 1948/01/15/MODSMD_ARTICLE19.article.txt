# Concert Features Soprano Friday

### JERRY DANIELLS 
Jennie Tourel, brilliant mezzo-so
prano of the Metropolitan Opera,
who has been sotting musical New
York on its ear ever since she made
her American concert debut in Oc
tober, 1942, will make her initial
Stanford appearance in the Memo
rial Auditorium at 8:15 Friday eve
ning.
Miss Tourel has proved conclu
sively that great art pays, in spite
of the seemingly wider attraction of
popular music via Hollywood and
radio. She held firm in her convic
ton that if an artist sings from the
heart and has the gift of communi
cation one can present even the
most difficult nuisic with complete
clarity and meaning to everyone.
No one would believe her until last
season when she made a sold-out,
four months' transcontinental tour
of the United States and Canada of
over 60 dates which brought her
great success and acclaim.
MUSIC SHE'S FAMED FOR
Her program this year will again
feature the type of music that made
her famous. She will present: "Di
do's Lament" from "Dido and Ae
neas," by Purcell; "Mermaid's
Song," by Haydn; Handel's "O
Sleep, Why Dost Thou Leave Me?"
from "Semele"; "Oh, Yes, Just So"
from "Phoebus and Pan" by Bach;
Schubert's famous "Ave Maria" and
"Standchcn"; "Widmung" by Schu
mann; Grieg's "Ein Traum"; "My
Heart at Thy Sweet Voice," an aria
from "Samson and Delilah," by St.
Saens.

rel will continue with "Adieu de
I'Hotesse Arabe," by Bizet; Debus
sy's "Mandoline"; "Si mes vers
