] College for women discussed what
| women should expect from college
j as a basis for their future, in a
t talk sponsored by Women's Voca
tional Committee last night.
TWO-WAV RESPONSIBILITY
"A college experience is a two
way responsibility," stated Dean
Hawkes. She expressed her opinion
that a college had the right to ex
pect, certain things from students,
and they had the right to expect
things from the college.
"A college has a right to expect
you to live up to the promises you
made to the college," said Mrs.
Hawkes to her feminine audience in
discussing what they went through
in applying to Stanford. "A college
| can also expect that you do your
! best and live up to the • traditions
! and ideals of the school."
OPEN NEW HORIZONS
"Colleges in return should receive
I you at your own value and treat
you as an individual," Denn Hawkes
continued in giving the college's re
sponsibility to its students. "College
should open new opportunities and
widen horizons for you. It should
help you develop attitudes and
opinions, teach you how to use
! your freedom, and give you an op
j portunity for service."
Then Dean Hawkes put a ques
tion to her audience, "Can you ex
pect college to contribute directly
to your future life or train you for
a certain vocation?" She next dis
cussed the essentials of a happy and
successful work situation and the
opportunity for new experience and
j self-expression. Mrs. Hawkes stated
very emphatically that "A vocation
is the right one for you only if
you love it so well that you would
work for nothing else."
