# DEMOCRACY
## Famous Train To Stop Here 
### JEAN McKEAN 
Tuesday night at Palo Alto High
School a cross-sectional committer?
of citizcns gathered to hear an aH
dress by Mr. John Rae of the Amer -
ican Heritage Foundation and '<>
formulate plans for this com muni
ty's reception of the Freedom Train.
These people represented students
of all ages (including those at Stan
ford), educators, retailers, labor anrl
church organizations, veterans, or
were themselves city officials. They
had one thing in common: they
were all, as American citizens, vi -
tally interested in the coming of
the Freedom Train to Palo Alto so
that on March JO inhabitants of the
area between Redwood City and
Mountain View will bo able to sec
documents that form the basis of
our national heritage.
CITIZENS CONTRIBUTE
The federal government has
loaned some of the documents that
form part of the priceless exhibit,
but many of them have been loaned
by private citizens and the whole
Freedom Train program has been
undertaken and financed by the
American Heritage Foundation, ;i
private, non-profit, non - political
organization which wanted the
American people to be able to see
these documents that arc so histori
cally and culturally important to
them.
It is hoped that, as a result,
the people as a nation and indi
vidually will become far more
aware of the privileges, advantages,
and, especially, responsibilities with
which America's past has endowed
them.
The week before the arrival of
the train is designated as the Wee);
of Rededication to Democracy; it.
main emphasis and purpose is to
stimulate each individual to par
ticipate more actively in the affair,
of local and national organizations
which affect him daily but which he
often regards with inertia.
MARINES GUARD TRAIN
The streamliner is made up of
three cars of doc ument exhibits and
four cars of living quarters for th"
honor guard of 24 Marines on 24
hour duty inside the train. The train
has been enthusiastically received in
the CO-odd cities which it has toured
since leaving Philadelphia last Sept
17. It will return the same day thi •
year. It is estimated that 9,000
12,000 people go through the train
in a day. The inside of the train > ,
kept at a special temperature and
♦he care and mounting of the docu
ments is supervised by a trained
government archivist.
The Freedom Tram will be open
to the public, except children under
12. from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Wed
nesday, March 10.
