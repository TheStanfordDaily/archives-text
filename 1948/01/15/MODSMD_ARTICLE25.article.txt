## 
### 
Permanent committees were appointed and future class activ- j
iiies planned at a recent freshman executive committee meeting, j
Fiosh President Tom August presided.
August appointed the following committee chairmen: Louise
Burrill, finance; Don Weeden, publicity; Ted Westphal and Gee
Gee Anderson, social. A committee*

was also formed to direct the collec
tion of class dues, which were set
at $2.
The committee is composed of John
Robertson, Encina; Don Craven and
Burto File, Village; Gee Gee Ander
son, off campus; Betty Colkett,
Branner; Pat Murphy, Roble.
Due to the slow progress thus far,
plans have been revised for the col
lection of dues, August said.
August urged off campus freshmen
In lake a more active pavt in the class
activities. "Without the cooperation
of the off campus freshmen we can
not hope for the complete success
of our class activities. This is es
pecially true of the present drive for
funds to finance the activities of the
class during the coming four years.
1 personally urge every off campus
freshman to pay his dues immedi
alely, either to me in room 40 En
cina or to Gee Gee Anderson in
I ol.le," he concluded.
