# Varsity Points for Cal; Higgins, Penn Hobbling
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Stanford's basketball team, resting uncomfortably in the con
ference cellar at the moment, will still be hampered by injuries
when it takes the floor against the rampaging Berkeley Bears
Friday and Saturday nights.
Latest word from team trainer Con Jarvis is that Dave David
son, who played only a fraction of 112 â€¢

the Southern Cal game and did not
suit up for the UCLA fracas last
weekend, will definitely not play
Friday night and almost certainly
not Saturday night.
The rugged guartj is suffering from
a persistent case of flu.
HIGGINS, PENN WORK OUT
Captain Babe Higgins and second
string center Bob Penn worked out
yesterday for the first time this
week. Higgins, the Indians' floor
leader from his guard post, is still
bothered by a charley-horse in his
left leg, incurred in the Arkansas
game.
Penn has an injured left foot which
kept him out of the UCLA contest.
At best, neither he nor Higgins will
be in top shape for the Cal encoun
ters.
Coach Everett Dean has been al
ternating various reserves at the in
jured men's spots in an attempt to
find the right combination to stop
Chuck Hanger, Andy Wolfe, and Co.
CAL IN TOP SHAPE
As far as is known, Cal is in top
shape for the first 1948 renewal of
the traditional rivalry. According to
Dean, the Bears looked very good in
beating USC and UCLA.
The Stanford coach attributes part
of his team's misfortune in Los An
geles to flu shots which team mem
bers took shortly before they left.
While the Bears and Indians are
going at one another here Friday
night and at Berkeley Saturday
night, the Trojans and Bruins will
be battling down south in a two
game series.
Capacity crowds are assured for
all the games.
