# Frosh Five Faces Cubs
## 
### 
With but one remaining practice
set*ion before they meet the Cali
fornia freshmen on Friday, Stanford's
Frosh cagers were put through de
fensive workouts yesterday.
Coach Jack Dana revealed that
starting forward Don Patch might
miss both of the Cal games this
weekend due to a minor leg injury.
If the big lad is out, either Lloyd
Kelley or Fran Watson is expected
to start in his position.
With yesterday's practice, the
yearling squad was reduced to 21
men in a final cut by Mentor Dana.
After the California series this
weekend, the freshmen's schedule
calls for 10 more contests, two of
them being return matches with the
Berkeley lads.
