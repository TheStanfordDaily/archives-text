# Attaboy, Al!

The appointment of Al Masters as head man
ager of the United States Olympic track team
is a noteworthy honor both for Stanford and
for Pacific Coast athletics.
The Stanford Graduate Manager, who has
long been recognized as one of the leading fig
ures in American intercollegiate athletics, has
been a member of the American Olympic Com
mittee since 1932, serving as assistant manager
of the track and field teams in 1932 and 1936.

Mr. Masters was slated for the head mana
ger's position for the 1940 games, which were
canceled due to the war.
The appointment is of added significance, as
it marks the first time the position has been
awarded west of the Rockies.
Dean Cromwell, veteran University of South
ern California mentor who was named head
track coach for the 1948 games, is also the first
coach to come from the West Coast.â€”D. D.
