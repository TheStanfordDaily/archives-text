### BY ALLEN BLEIZ 
We all know that some new-car dealers take pro
fiteering advantage in the seller's market. I even be
lieve that any of us could list at least live different
abuses which we have seen these "reputable" dealers
pull on unsuspecting customers.
1 can charge one car dealer in this area with making
as much as one-thousand percent profit on trade-ins.
That's a pretty nice figure, isn't; and these "Honest
Johns" are not too scarce either. Some have sold to
ear-lot operators at above list price. This customer
waiting list is a poor joke—a poor joke on the people.
The manufacturers of automobiles could curb these
abuses if they would exert a little effort in the right
channels. They could revoke dealer franchises when
dealers get out of hand. But the Automobile Manufac
turers' Association keeps offering so many excuses
that it appears they do not care what happens as long
as they uet their money. It is too bad that a few lousy
dollars mean so much to a few of the big men in the
industry that they refrain from doing what is right
— that of yiving an honest deal to the masses.
One favorite excuse of the A.M.A. is that the

makers' interest ends with the producing of cars and
fairly distributing them among dealers. However,
you cannot brush off responsibility like that. Dealer
franchises are designedly written so that manufac
turers can rigidly police them. When it served their
interest, they have been anything but reticent about
pushing dealers to sell more cars and especially high
profit accessories.
The whole industry's reputation is involved in
dealers' reputations. Makers and dealers have always
shared the blame for legal abuses in the past and they
will continue to do so in the future. The A.M.A. is
continually getting a worse reputation, and I for one
say that the blame rests entirely with them, for they
are the very same people who could alter the situa
tion if they wanted to.
If and when the. A.M.A. realizes that profiteering
and a good reputation are not synonymous, and they
take steps to prove to the public that they do have
some spark of righteousness in them, then will the
auto industry be headed in the right direction and
giving the American people an honest deal.

will continue to do so in the future. The A.M.A. is
continually getting a worse reputation, and I for one
say that the blame rests entirely with them, for they
are the very same people who could alter the situa
tion if they wanted to.
If and when the. A.M.A. realizes that profiteering
and a good reputation are not synonymous, and they
take steps to prove to the public that they do have
some spark of righteousness in them, then will the
auto industry be headed in the right direction and
giving the American people an honest deal.
We all know that some new-car dealers take pro
fiteering advantage in the seller's market. I even be
lieve that any of us could list at least live different
abuses which we have seen these "reputable" dealers
pull on unsuspecting customers.
1 can charge one car dealer in this area with making
as much as one-thousand percent profit on trade-ins.
That's a pretty nice figure, isn't; and these "Honest
Johns" are not too scarce either. Some have sold to
ear-lot operators at above list price. This customer
waiting list is a poor joke—a poor joke on the people.
The manufacturers of automobiles could curb these
abuses if they would exert a little effort in the right
channels. They could revoke dealer franchises when
dealers get out of hand. But the Automobile Manufac
turers' Association keeps offering so many excuses
that it appears they do not care what happens as long
as they uet their money. It is too bad that a few lousy
dollars mean so much to a few of the big men in the
industry that they refrain from doing what is right
— that of yiving an honest deal to the masses.
One favorite excuse of the A.M.A. is that the

makers' interest ends with the producing of cars and
fairly distributing them among dealers. However,
you cannot brush off responsibility like that. Dealer
franchises are designedly written so that manufac
turers can rigidly police them. When it served their
interest, they have been anything but reticent about
pushing dealers to sell more cars and especially high
profit accessories.
The whole industry's reputation is involved in
dealers' reputations. Makers and dealers have always
shared the blame for legal abuses in the past and they
will continue to do so in the future. The A.M.A. is
continually getting a worse reputation, and I for one
say that the blame rests entirely with them, for they
are the very same people who could alter the situa
tion if they wanted to.

and a good reputation are not synonymous, and they
