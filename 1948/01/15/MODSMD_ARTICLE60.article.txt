# Fairmont to Host Coed Row Dance
## 
### 
Women residents of Row houses
should contact their house presi
dents for their tickets to the Row
dance to be given Satruday in the
Terrace Room of the Fairmont Ho
tel, according to Sally Sturtevant,
president of the Row Executive
Council. The tickets have already
been paid for by Row dues, and
are available only to women living
in Row houses, she added.
The dance will not be formal, as
was tentatively planned, and the
time has been set from 10 to 1 to
enable students to attend the dance
after the basketball game at Cal.
Wally Heider's orchestra has been
scheduled to play for the dance.
