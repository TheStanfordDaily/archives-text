## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UP).—
Diplomatic sources said today that
the Soviet Union has protested to
Argentina over the actions of two
Argentine diplomats who allegedly
tried to smuggle a pair of disillu
sioned Spanish Loyalists out of
Russia.
These informants said both sides
are pretty embarrassed about the
affair and would like to hush it up.
They said the Soviets particularly
are not anxious to spread the news
that some people think Russia is a
good place to get out of.

The two Loyalists were said to
have been stowed away in a pair of
big trunks which the diplomats
were taking with them on their way
home from Moscow.
At any rate, the stowaways and
the diplomatic smugglers were re
turned to Moscow and the Soviet
Foreign Office began burning up the
wires with protests to the Argentine
government.
An Argentine Foreign Ministry
spokesman denied these reports to
day.
