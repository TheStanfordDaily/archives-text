JERUSALEM, Jan. 14 (UP).—Vio
lence blazed from north to south in
Palestine today in a sudden new
surge of savage Arab - Jewish
clashed.
At least 13 persons were killed
and many wounded in the three
chief cities. In the south one of the
biggest battles since the United Na
tions voted to partition Palestine,
was fought.
As the bomb blasts of terrorist
dynamite squads echoed in fearful
Jerusalem tonight, British authori
ties started discussions on full troop
withdrawal and reliable sources re
ported Britain might give up her
Palestine mandate by March 1
within seven weeks-—leaving the
UN to deal with a developing civil
war.
A British spokesman said a UN
partition commission would not be
permitted to come here now because
it might mean conflicting authority.
At the same time well - informed
sources said Britain might hand
over her mandate to the UN March
I—instead of May 15 — and leave
that organization to handle the
Holy Land crisis.
