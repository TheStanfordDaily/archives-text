# Farm Undergrads, Grads Offered 147 Scholarships

### JACKIE MILNOR 
"Sure I'd like to go through school on a scholarship, but Stan
ford doesn't give them." "Scholarships? Only straight "A" stu
dents get them. I don't have a chance." "Anyone can get a
scholarshipâ€”all you have to do is apply."
No one on campus seems to know about scholarships. The

majority opinion is that Stanford
doesn't give them. The truth is that
147 scholarships are open to gradu
ates, undergraduates, and entering
undergraduates. One hundred and
eighty-nine students are receiving
scholarships and fellowships this
year, valued in excess of $103,000.
STUDENT HAS TWO CHANCES
If these students can do it, so can
others, provided they have "scho
lastic excellence." This last is de
termined by previous records,
promise of success as judged by
recommendations and aptitude test
scores. Financial need is also a de
termining factor.
Scholarships are awarded upon
nomination of the University Com
mittee on Scholarship, or upon
nomination of an individual, com
mittee, club, department, or other
agency.
These last are usually restricted
by department of study, geographi
cal location of applicant, or aca
demic status. An example of a geo
graphically restricted scholarship is
the Henry Newell Sch#lax*ship for
students from Utah.
SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIP
If specializing in a certain de
partment, a student is also eligible
for a special scholarship. For ex
ample, the National Broadcasting
Company and Radio Station KNBC
awards a year's tuition to student
who are particularly interested in
professional radio. Monte J. Him
melbaum, Lower Division, receives
this scholarship.
Sara E. Heaslett, graduate, is one
of the students receiving a scholar
ship covering tuition and fees from
the National Foundation for Infan
tile Paralysis. This scholarship is

open only to students specializing in
physical therapy.
There are 18 geographically re
stricted and 66 departmentally re
stricted scholarships offered. A
complete description of all of these,
together with where and when to
apply, is in the Information Bulle
tin published by the University.
GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS
A student can also be awarded a
scholarship upon nomination of the
University Committee on Scholar
ship. He should apply directly to
the Scholarship Secretary. He will
not be considered for any specific
scholarship but for any award for
which he is eligible.
The latest scholarship offered by
Stanford is the Gold Star Memorial
Scholarship, which provides four
years' free tuition for children of
Stanford men and women who lost
their lives in World War 11.
Joan and Susan Dekker of Carmel
are the first to receive this award.
Their father, Major William Nicho
las Dekker, USAAF, Stanford '2(5,
was killed in action July 11, 1943,
in the Mediterranean theater. His
widow is the former Mary Stein
beck, '26, sister of author John
Steinbeck.
