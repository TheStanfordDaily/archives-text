# Court Clears Petrillo Of Lea Act Violation
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 14 (UP).â€”James
Caesar Petrillo, boss of the Musi
cians' Union for 25 years, was found
innocent by a federal judge today
of violating the Lea Act which Con
gress passed in 1946 to curb his
power as a union leader.
The ruling did not involve consti
tutionality of the act, and attorneys
said that Petrillo still is subject to
its provision prohibiting unions from
attempting to force radio stations to
hire more musicians than neces
sary.
