# Fraternity Houses Packed For First Rushing Dinners
## 
### 
An estimated four hundred freshmen and other non-fraternity
men were missing from Encina and Village dining rooms last
night as first period rushing invitational dinners got under way
on the Row.
"Because of the large number of men going through rushing

(his year," commented Jim Welch,
Interfraternity Council president,
"fraternities wore unable to become
acquainted with all the rushees dur
ing the open houses. To remedy this
situation, we are asking all men who
did not receive first period invita
tions from houses they are particu
larly interested in to inform their
resident assistants."
"Their counselors should make a
list including each man's name, his
address, his home town, and the
house he specifies," Welch explain
ed. "These lists should be turned into
the Interfraternity Council office by
4 p.m. Monday. We will inform the
fraternities."
This system is being tried for the
first time this year, according to
Welch. "If the rushees cooperate, we
feel certain it will help to overcome j
the difficulties attendant to rushing
such a large number of men."
First period invitational luncheons
and dinners continue on Tuesday.
Second period meals are scheduled
for Jan. 22 and 26. The Preference
Dinner will be held on Jan. 30 with
formal pledging to follow the next
morning.
Rushees may pledge at any time
now although no pledge is binding
until Jan. 31. A complete list of
rushing rules can be found in the
recently-distributed Interfraternity
Council magazine.
"Any informal meetings between
rushees and fraternity men of more
than eight persons are expressly for
bidden," Welch concluded. "The j
maximum ratio is four fraternity
men to one rushes. Any infraction
of this rule means fines for both
fraternities and rushee."
