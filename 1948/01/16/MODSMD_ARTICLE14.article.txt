# Changes in Study Lists Due Tuesday
## 
### 
Deadline for changing study lists
without fine is 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.
After that time all changes must be
made by petition to the Registra
tion Committee, subject to a $2 fine
for each course added or dropped.
Until the deadline, changes can be
made by filing a revised study list
card at the information window in
the Registrar's office.
Study cards filed at the time of
registration are official, and no
credit is given for courses which are
not on that card.
