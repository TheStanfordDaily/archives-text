# Jennie Tourel Sings Tonight
## 
### JERRY DANIELLS 
Tonight at 8:15 irj the Memorial
Auditorium Stanfordites will listen
to the Metropolitan Opera's leading
mezzo-soprano, Jennie Tourel, and
before she has completed her first
number the audience will realize
why critics say she is "unmatched
by anyone singing today."
Jennie Tourel's career in the
United States since her debut in
October, 1942, has been nothing
short of sensational â€” a veritable
fairy tale of overwhelming success
and acclaim. It has been sensational
because the excitement she has en
gendered with her art has never had
a chance to subside. Instead, it
grows with each passing season, for
everything she does creates news
and excitement. It is therefore with
good reason that she has been ac
claimed the greatest all-around re
citalist of the day.
Appraisals like: "vocal artistry at
its greatest"; "not only the greatest
mezzo - soprano, but one of the
greatest vocal artists of today"; "un
matched by anyone singing today,"
are common wherever Jennie Tou
rel appears.
A few tickets are still available
for this performance and may be
purchased in the Nitery today from
1 to 5. ff, however, these tickets are
not taken by 5, they may be pur
chased at the box office before the
performance, according to Barbara
Aitken, Concert Series manager.
Students who have reserved tick
ets at the Nitery are reminded to
pick them up thus afternoon.
