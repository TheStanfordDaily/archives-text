# U.S. Warned: Draft Or Marshall Plan

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—
Army ,Secretary Kenneth C. Royall
warned Congress today that, the
United States has a choice between
Ilia Marshall Plan for European Re
covery and an immediate peacetime
draft to rebuild its fighting forces.
Voluntary enlistments and the
present $11,000,000,000 annual rate
of American military spending will
be inadequate to meet the situation
if this country lets the European
nations collapse into Communism,
he said.
Defense Secretary James Forres
tal told the House Foreign Affairs
Committee that if the Marshall Plan
is rejected the United States may
have to spend $17,000,000,000 a year
for arms—the sum originally asked
by the administration for the full
51-month European aid program.
He said the armed forces consider
the program just as important as
maintaining substantial military
power. If it is rejected and western
Europe goes Communistic, he said,
this country will find itself alone
in "a hostile world."
