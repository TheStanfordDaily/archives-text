# Indian, Bear Quintets Begin Series Tonight
## Stanford Handicapped by Injuries; California in Top Condition for Game 
### BILL ALLEN 
Every seat in Stanford's match-box basketball pavilion will be
occupied tonight when the Indian basketball team takes on the
league-leading California five beginning at 8 o'clock.
Stanford will go into the game still handicapped by injuries
and flu. At least one and possibly tv/o first-stringers are missing

from the starting line-up announced
yesterday by Coach Everett Dean.
Another sell-out crowd will be on
hand at Berkeley tomorrow night
for the second game of the traditional
series.
Bob Lewis will start ;it one guard
spot in place of Dave Davidson who
is still recuperating from a flu at
tack. Davidson was unable to suit up
for practice until yesterday.
And at the other guard spot Gus
Chavalas may go instead of Captain
Babe Higgins, who was kept from
practicing most of the week, by a
charley-horse.
REGULAR STARTERS
The three other starting positions
will be held down by their usual oc
cupants. Bill Rose and Morley
Thompson will open the game at for
wards, and Steve Stephenson at cen
ter.
The high-flying Bears, on the oth
er hand, will come into the game in
top shape, and sporting an unmarred
conference record.
While Stanford was dropping two
games to Southern Cal and UCLA
in i_,os Angeles last weekend, Coach
Nibs Price's men won their contests
with the same two clubs rather han
dily.
BEARS MADE IMPRESSION
Chuck Hanger, Andy Wolfe, Gor
don Cuneo, and the rest of the Cal
outfit made a considerable impres
sion on Los Angeles sports experts.
The 6-foot-5 Hanger is the Bears'
top threat and possibly the best pla\
er on the Coast. He scored 27 point .
against USC to break a California
scoring record. To add to Stanford's
woes, the former record holder,
guard Andy Wolfe, will also be play
ing tonight.
ALL-AMERICAN PLAYS
Wolfe, an All-American forward
two years ago, has been moved to
guard to take one of the spots left
vacant by the graduation of Bob
Hogeboom and Bill Durkee. Handy-
Andy's southpaw push-shots have
been just as effective from giiF.,-d a .
they were from forward.
Backing up the two stars is a
more than adequate supporting ' a t
of tall, capable ball players. Paired
with Hanger at, forward will br:
either George Walker (6-2) or Got
don Cuneo (6-3). Walker saw a lot
of varsity action last year, and Cun •
eo was a standout in the USC game.
At center it will be cither Jim
Smith (6-5) or George Walker'.,
brother Boh (6-3). Dee Keaton (6-2)
has been working at guard along
with Wolfe.
Although Stanford will enter the
game as decided underdogs, Cal is
definitely not invincible. The Bears
have been beaten by Washington
(twice), Oregon State, and Minne
sota.
They rely heavily on their height
under the basket. Almost half of


Center STEVE STEPHENSON
figures to be one of the big gur.-s
in Stanford's attack, when the In
dians tackle the California Golden
Bears tonight and tomorrow.
Hanger's 27 points against UCLA
came on tip-ins. The Indians showed
against Arkansas that they can work
effectively against a taller team.
In so many words, Cal can be had,
if Stanford plays up to the form
shown in its Cow Palace games.
As the conl'crence schedule swings
into its second round, USC and
UCLA will battle through games
tonight and tomorrow night in Los
Angeles.

BEARS MADE IMPRESSION
Chuck Hanger, Andy Wolfe, Gor
don Cuneo, and the rest of the Cal
outfit made a considerable impres
sion on Los Angeles sports experts.
The 6-foot-5 Hanger is the Bears'
top threat and possibly the best pla\
er on the Coast. He scored 27 point .
against USC to break a California
scoring record. To add to Stanford's
woes, the former record holder,
guard Andy Wolfe, will also be play
ing tonight.
ALL-AMERICAN PLAYS
Wolfe, an All-American forward
two years ago, has been moved to
guard to take one of the spots left
vacant by the graduation of Bob
Hogeboom and Bill Durkee. Handy-
Andy's southpaw push-shots have
been just as effective from giiF.,-d a .
they were from forward.
Backing up the two stars is a
more than adequate supporting ' a t
of tall, capable ball players. Paired
with Hanger at, forward will br:
either George Walker (6-2) or Got
don Cuneo (6-3). Walker saw a lot
of varsity action last year, and Cun •
eo was a standout in the USC game.
At center it will be cither Jim
Smith (6-5) or George Walker'.,
brother Boh (6-3). Dee Keaton (6-2)
has been working at guard along
with Wolfe.
Although Stanford will enter the
game as decided underdogs, Cal is
definitely not invincible. The Bears
have been beaten by Washington
(twice), Oregon State, and Minne
sota.
They rely heavily on their height
under the basket. Almost half of


Center STEVE STEPHENSON
figures to be one of the big gur.-s
in Stanford's attack, when the In
dians tackle the California Golden
Bears tonight and tomorrow.
Hanger's 27 points against UCLA
came on tip-ins. The Indians showed
against Arkansas that they can work
effectively against a taller team.
In so many words, Cal can be had,
if Stanford plays up to the form
shown in its Cow Palace games.
As the conl'crence schedule swings
into its second round, USC and
UCLA will battle through games
tonight and tomorrow night in Los
Angeles.
Probable starting lineups:
Stanford California
Rose F Hanger
Thompson F G. Walker
Stephenson C Smith
Higgins or
Chavalas G Wolfe
R. Lewis (1 Keatoi
Every seat in Stanford's match-box basketball pavilion will be
occupied tonight when the Indian basketball team takes on the
league-leading California five beginning at 8 o'clock.
Stanford will go into the game still handicapped by injuries
and flu. At least one and possibly tv/o first-stringers are missing

from the starting line-up announced
yesterday by Coach Everett Dean.
Another sell-out crowd will be on
hand at Berkeley tomorrow night
for the second game of the traditional
series.
Bob Lewis will start ;it one guard
spot in place of Dave Davidson who
is still recuperating from a flu at
tack. Davidson was unable to suit up
for practice until yesterday.
And at the other guard spot Gus
Chavalas may go instead of Captain
Babe Higgins, who was kept from
practicing most of the week, by a
charley-horse.
REGULAR STARTERS
The three other starting positions
will be held down by their usual oc
cupants. Bill Rose and Morley
Thompson will open the game at for
wards, and Steve Stephenson at cen
ter.
The high-flying Bears, on the oth
er hand, will come into the game in
top shape, and sporting an unmarred
conference record.
While Stanford was dropping two
games to Southern Cal and UCLA
in i_,os Angeles last weekend, Coach
Nibs Price's men won their contests
with the same two clubs rather han
dily.
