# Players Stage Racine Play

### 
The Stanford Players' striked play
reading of Jean Racine's "Phaedra,"
| scheduled for presentation on Wed
nesday in the Little Theater, will
feature the same team which scored
in last quarter's production of "The
Father," according to an announce-
ment made yesterday by director
Nancy MacNaught.
Elaine Maltzman, who depicted the
j relentlessly callous wife of Strind
berg's psychological drama, has been
cast in the title role in the reading,
while Mel El let, the neurotic Cap
i tain of "The Father,'' will play Hip
polytus. Both performers have had
considerable experience on the stage
in the Memorial Hall, Ellet having
appeared in "Macbeth," "The Royal
Family," and "Richard III," besides
directing his own production thesis,
"The Doll's House." Miss Maltzman's
most notable successes were in the
experimental "No Exit," and "Arms
and the Man." She has also starred
in previous playreadings.
Racine's play, which has been de
scribed as the greatest drama of pas
sion ever written is based on the
ancient Greek Hippolytus legend,
and is written in the stirring and
beautiful verse of the neo-classic
period which is particularly adapted
to reading, giving large scope for
effects of dramatic intensity.
Taking a cue from Orson Welles
! and Katherine Cornell, who have ex
perimented with the staging of clas
sics in modern dress, Miss Mac-
Naught plans to costume the show in
! contemporary styles, employing sym
bolic details, and using various act-
ing levels.
