# Excom Review

### Excom Member B.J. DENNING MARGIE HANSON, Associate Editor 
Excom made recommendations
Wednesday night to next year's Ex
com concerning the "handling of the
annual Pajamarino, in order to pre
vent a repetition of this year's de
structiveness.
The report of the committee ni
vestigating the Pajamarino, which
is headed by Gillian Duckworth,
was Ihe basis of these recommen
dations.
Responsibility for next year's
event should he placed with a
committee headed by a member
of Rally Com. and including rep
resentatives from the classes of
and '52, Interfrateinhy Coun
cil, and Excom.
The Row parade should not be
abolished, Pavilion policing should
be kept at a minimum with Block
"S" members helping, Roble lawn
should be well lighted, and refresh
ments should be served after Ihe
serenade.
Criticisms of Ihe Pajamarino as
sessments by the Council for Stu
dent Control were presented by Ted
Norton.
Norton objected to assessing the
freshmen 30 per cent because of
their failure to help organize the
event. Since at the time of the Pa
jamarino the freshmen had no class
organization, Norton feels they
could not have been responsible as
a group for organizing the rally.
He also said that the contention
of the Council that they are more
representative than the two Excom
committees is "patently ridiculous."
"None of the groups assessed
had any official representatives
pri ,cnt at the Council meeting,"
Norton claimed.
The policy of the Excom commit
tees .strict punitive action as a pre
ventive measure by assessing living

groups and lhus reaching ihoso
; principally responsible â€” was not
fully considered by the Council, he
[ believed.
Jim Welch, chairman of Men's
Council, replied that Council's em
! phasis was on responsibility, not
j punishment, and that it was up to
the classes in turn to assess living
1 groups if they wished.
The California - Hawaii - Nevada
Regional Constitution of NSA was
j approved by Excom. ASSU will
pay $126 regional dues per year.
The finance committee set up will
i assist Gene Mitguard, student man
ager, in presenting controversial
budgets to Excom. Bob Brown and
i Joyce Graybiel were appointed to
: this committee.
Al Masteis, graduate manager,
who appoints the student mana
! ger, has said that he may appoint
j an assistant student manager for
the latter half of spring quarter to
aid Mitguard.
Excom passed a bylaw proposed
by Ted Norton setting up a standing
| Committee on Student Employment.
This committee will include one
| member of Excom, three student
j body members (at least one of
whom shall have been employed in
a University dining hall for two
quarters), and three representatives
from the Administration nominated
by the Dean of Students.
This committee will discuss stu
dent employment policies in regard
to employment by the University or
| by private firms, and operalion of
I independent student enterprises on
campus.
After such discussion they may
recommend their decisions to the
University and to Excom.
The committee will also act as a
fact-finding and mediating body in
! disputes between students and their
employers, either the University or
| private firms.
