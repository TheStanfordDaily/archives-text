# Lube-ing the Sports Axle With Art Lubic
## 
### 
The lines were long, classes were
cut, and there was disappointment
for many. A repetition of the 1947
story took place Monday as tickets
were dispersed for tonight's Bear-
Injun cage fracas.
Yes, it's the same old story—B,ooo
interested Stanford students and a
basketball pavilion seating less than
3,000. It adds up to the fact that a
good percentage of students who
want to, and would attend Indian
games, will not receive the oppor
tunity to do so.
Last year at this time our cohorts
on the sports desk wound themselves
into knots trying to do something
about the situation. The Cards almost
lost head man Everett Dean UCLA
because of the bottleneck.
This year some games are being
played in the spacious Cow Palace,
a big improvement, but nothing has
yet been done about our own pa
vilion. It seems resigned to go down
in history as another Stanford tra
dition.
Haehten Returns
Bill Hachten, Stanford All-Coast
guard in 1946, has resumed his stu
dies on the Farm after a session with
the New York Giants last fall.
The Giants, perennially the tough
est defensive outfit in the National
Pro loop, brought up the rear of the
eastern division but press notices on
Hachten were nothing but good.
Red-headed Bill, troubled by a
bad knee early in the campaign, came
like a house afire toward the end of
the season and prompted Frank Gra
ham, writing in the New York World
Telegram, to single out Hachten as
one of the "youngsters who made
a tremendous impression this year."
Llovd Takes n Spill
Lloyd Merriman, Mr. All-America
of a year back and now under pro
fessional baseball contract to the
Cincinnati Reds, is still hobbling
around campus these days after tak
ing a spill on the slopes at Sun
Valley over vacation.
How's About Ariiie?
Hopes for a conference champion
ship tennis team on the Farm this
spring may well rest on the eligibil
ity of Arnie Beisser. Coach Elwyn
Bugge has a well-rounded squad to
choose from and needs the punch in
the number one slot that Arnie can
provide.
Beisser's eligibility hinges on a
two-unit course taken in the service.
If credit is granted by school author
ities Arnie is eligible for another
year of competition under the PCC's
war-time ruling affecting V-12 grad
uates. «- kft J
Beisser was unbeaten in intercol
legiate competition in 1945. He had
little difficulty in drubbing USC's
top-ranking Bobby Perez, and hand
ed UCLA's Noel Brown a straight set
lacing, Brown's only loss of that year.
Frosh ("ail Do ft
Frosh netmen are in for a good
year also. Dick Mechem, former
Kansas State prep champ, copped
an all-frosh tourney here prior to the
holidays and is number one on the
frosh ladder. Nearest challenger is
Vince Schmieder, a highly ranked
Southland junior from Los Angeles
High.
There is also the possibility that 1
former national prep champ Hugh j
Stewart of South Pasadena will doff
his Army toggery in time to enroll j
for spring quarter competition.
