# PRELIMINARIES
## Dana's Frosh, Bear Cubs Hold Early Cage Spotlight 
### JOHN BREIER 
Seeking their fourth win in five starts, the Stanford freshman
basketball team will meet the University of California Bear Cubs
in a preliminary game scheduled for 6:15 tonight in the Pavilion.
Tip-off time for tomorrow's contest, to be held in Berkeley,
has been set back to 5:45 due to a California Blues-Santa Rosa

JC game at 7:00.
Marvin Gelber, starting guard and
coolest man on the floor for the
yearlings, missed yesterday's prac
tice session due to an injury sus
-1 tained Wednesday. Coach Jack Dana
I exi>ect to start the big lad but is
I doubtful as to the length of time
' he will be available.
| GELBER ONLY INJURY
Aside from Gelber the squad re
ported at full strength yesterday and
I Dana put the boys through some last
| minute practices on out of bounds
plays and signal knowledge. r
Against the taller men from across
the Bay, Dana has devised a shift
ing man-to-man defense, designed
primarily to stop the shots of two
Cal men, center Bill Hagler and
guard Eugene Garfinkle.
Hagler's height will range well be
yond anyone the Stanford squad
could put on the floor and the main
part of the job of stopping the high
scoring lad will fall to the Farm's
center, Bill Herron.
WATSON ON GARFINKLE
Paul Watson, high point man for
the Card juniors thus far, will be
given the task of holding down the
point-making Garfinkle. Garfinkle, a
former Oakland High basketeer, is
described by Dana as "a man with
a good one-hand push shot who can
be counted upon to give us a lot of
trouble."
Against the man-to-man defense
expected from the visiting Bears,
Dana will start the same line-up that
figured in last week's 51 to 37 vic
tory over Sequoia High school.
Paul Watson and Don Patch will
start from the forward positions with
Bill Herron slated for the pivot spot.
Newly-elected captain Dick Clegg
and the ailing Gelber have been
named as guards.
Capable substitutes in Lloyd Kel
ley, Derek Bok and Fran Watson are
on hand for forward play, with Ken
Gardner and Hal Campen standing
by for guard and center duty.
In their four games to date, the
frosh cagers have won three and
dropped one, to Lincoln High school
from San Francisco. They hold wins
over Salinas JC, 48 to 41; Galileo
High, 33 to 32, and Sequoia High,
51 to 37.
Against the four teams, the Car
dinal frosh have run up 169 points
to the opposition's 141. Paul.Watson

j has accounted for 48 tallies, Patch,
19. Gelber. 16, Herron and Clegg, 14
I each, and Kelley and Gardner, 11
; apiece.
Probable starting line-ups:
Stanford California
Watson F Smith
Patch F Wirth
Ilerron C Hagler
Gelber G Dcnson
Clegg G Garfinkle
