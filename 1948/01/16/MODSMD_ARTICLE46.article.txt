## NETTERS Ladder Battles Feature Early Tennis Action 
### 
As varsity tennis swings into the
second week of the quarter, the ini
tial round of ladder tennis compe
tition is getting under way. Progres
sive elimination is the keynote of
the tourney with the lower division
winners playing the upper bracket
i losers for squad positions.
Coach Elwyn Bugge posted the
| first round matchings yesterday and
: added that these matches must be
; completed bv next Thursday, Jan. 22.
BUGGE LISTS PAIRINGS
Varsity pairings are: Kirke Moch
em (bye), Barbour vs. Basham, Fred
| Lewis vs. Forbes, Lycette vs. Hynes,
and Randolph vs. Miller. On the
j frosh slate are Dick Bechem (bye),
Schnieder vs. Taft, Appleby vs. Tay
lor, Sederholm vs. Miller, and Hun
eke vs. Willner. Bob Lewis, who is
| the probable number one varsity
j man, is turning out for basketball
; and will not play in the elimination.
With the frosh tangle, a ten
i tative affair against Modesto JC, only
| a little over a month away, Bugge
pointed out that all netters are
obliged to turn out every day that
weather permits. Practice will com
| mence at 2 p.m. and continue until 5.
V ARSITY RATES COURTS
In line with the statement of prac
time times, Bugge expressed the wish
that the general student body refrain
from using the 15 varsity courts after
2 p.m. The courts in question are
| those to the south of the Pavilion and
| those behind the gym.
The courts are free until 2, but
the number of men turning out in
! the afternoon makes it necessary to
i prohibit their use after that time.


AL MORIiIS, captain-elect of the
11)48 rugby team, broke his left
forearm in practice Wednesday.
Morris, just rounding into shape
after a post-football season appen
dectomy. will be out of action for
three weeks.
