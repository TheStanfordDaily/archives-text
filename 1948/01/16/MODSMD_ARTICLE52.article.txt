# Mission Not Accomplished
## 
### 
Women's Conference yesterday passed a
ruling in regard to the budgets and assessments
of women's residences. The original purpose
of the change in house dues and assessment
procedure was to establish a greater uniformity
all over campus in the opportunities to give
social affairs and to limit extra assessments
levied in small houses.
The rule as passes does not accomplish this
objective. Although all houses on campus now
have maximum dues of $4, assessments can still
be passed by a three-fourths vote of each house.
The assessment must be reported to the area
Excom, but there is no committee to give final
approval of these assessments.
The small residences do not obtain the large
amount of revenue from dues that the larger
halls obtain. The original plan was aimed at
stopping the many compulsory collections
which these smaller houses purportedly have

assessed because of lower treasuries and lack
of budgeting.
Women's Conference now plans to "look
over the situation" at the end of the year when
financial reports from all the women's areas
will be investigated.
The regulations passed yesterday delay ac
tion on gaining the uniformity which is desired.
There can be no uniformity when two-thirds
of the members of a residence are capable of
deciding on a compulsory collection from every
member of the house. The cost of living in a
small residence will continue to be out of pro
portion with the cost in a large hall.
The assessment rule should be given teeth:
no assessments without unanimous approval by
house residents, or the sale of bids only to those
residents who are attending a house function.
With the more careful budgeting which is
provided for in the new plan and compulsory
assessment, a true uniformity could be obtained
between large and small living groups.—M.S.
