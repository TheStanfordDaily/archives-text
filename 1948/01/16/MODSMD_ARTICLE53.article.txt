I notice that the issue over women's long skirts is
practically dead.
Which proves, I guess, that you get used to any
thing if you stay with it long enough. This applies to
sitting in electric chairs as well as looking at long
skirts.
It's only the result that differs.
But not much.
One kills the body, the other kills appreciation for.
And what good is the physical if it can't learn to
appreciate beauty?
I wonder what effect long skirts have had on the
saddle shoe industry. You don't see as many of them
on girls as you used to.
And if it be true that clothes make the man, then
clothes must also make the woman. I know a frater
nity man who would consider that a revolutionary
thought.
When I asked the little boy next door whether the
new baby at his house was a boy or a girl, he said:

"I don't know, they haven't put clothes on it yet."
To him at least, sex determination was synonymous
with clothing. The same fraternity man would con
sider this also a revolutionary thought.
Every man to his own methods, I always say.
What is one man's meat is another man's Saks Fifth
Avenue.
I don't mind seeing women's clothes go to ex
tremes as long as they don't go to extremities â€”know
what I mean?
Out of the some 500 odd statisticians in Los An
geles, one of the oddest I know is a man named Her
man Schmiddling. He claims that long skirts arc
sensible. Sensibility in women's clothing over a period
of years, he claims, has reduced accidents on street
cars by 50 per cent.
Good for Herman! Safety first, I always say. Let's
do away with accidents entirely, I always say.
But then in high school, I was voted the boy whose
forehead was most likely to recede.
