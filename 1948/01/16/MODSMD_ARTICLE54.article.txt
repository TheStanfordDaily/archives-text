One of the most successful ventures in international
friendship, I believe, was the arrangement through
which large numbers of Chinese students came to the
United States under terms of the indemnity settlement
after the Boxer uprising and siege of the American
Legation in Peking in 1900. These Chinese, after a
thorough education in American universities, went
back to their people to improve public health, educa
tion. safety, and many other aspects of depressed
community life.
Now, almost half a century later, we are entering
into a similar plan with the Chinese. Thanks to the
new agreement signed by the United States and China,
another such progam of benefits through student ex
change will soon be in full function. The agreement
provides that twenty million dollars derived from the
sale of surplus American war property will be used
for training students in educational institutions in
both countries.
This is a decided improvement over the one-way
program under the Boxer Agreement. America's stake
in world affairs is so geat that it is extremely desirable
to have many of the youth of this country at least

partially educated in the Orient so as to understand
and appreciate Oriental needs and aspirations.
The time now is ripe for China to arise from her
depths of archaic thought and undertakings. This can
only be accomplished by injecting new ideas and a
new, modern way of living into the dormant land of
the Orient. Modern ideas and conception in the man
ner of new technological implements for their fields
and fresh knowledge in economic and political lines
are the most outstanding factors in producing a '"new
China."
The Fulbright Act, under which this new agree
ment is signed, is one of the wisest of our post-war
laws. Many agreements of this nature should follow
upon the heels of this one. If anything, the countries
of this world need a basic understanding of each other
■—a quality which they do not now possess.
Widespread exchange of students, teachers, and
professional workers of all kinds is a strong force for
world peace. Many European countries are now laying
the groundwork for such a policy. The Russians know
how important it is, and that is why they are taking
thousands of young Europeans from the Iron Curtain
nations to study in the Soviet universities.
