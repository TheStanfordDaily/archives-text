Pilot training and non-rated offic

offered to civilians by the United
States Air Force will be described by
USAF officers at a meeting to be held
ut Stanford University Wednesday
and Thursday.
Traveling Air Force teams are vis
iting major colleges and universities j
throughout the United States to ac
quaint young men interested in avia- j
tion with the new USAF.
NO KED TAPE
Lt. Col. Henry C. Gedman, who is !
in charge of the USAF program in
this Air Force area, said today that
young men desiring to sign up for |
Aviation Cadet Training or for Of- ,
ficer Candidate Training would be ,
able to determine at once whether or
not they could qualify. He said that â– 
the simplified procedure recently !
adopted by the USAF authorizes the
traveling teams to give all the quali
fying tests required for the courses
except the final physical examina

tion. This procedure, he pointed out,
eliminates delay, inconvenience and
expense to prospective candidates.
The meeting at Room 1(51 A will be
open to all interested young men
from this area.
School authorities meanwhile have
asked Dr, Robert N. Bush, director
at the Appointment Service, to act
as advisor to students and other in
terested young men on all phases of
the training program.
BOLSTER FIRST LINE
The USAF recently reopened its
Aviation Cadet Pilot Training pro
gram to qualified civilians in order
to provide airmen to man the high
speed fighters, bombers and other
aircraft which are America's first
line of defense in the fast-develop
ing air age. Both the Aviation Cadet
course and the program to train of
ficers for USAF ground duties are
part of an accelerated activity to pro
vide a modern and highly-skilled
air arm within the Congressionally

authorized personnel strength of
400.000 men.
An Aviation Cadet who success
fully completes the 12-month train
ing course in modern aircraft will be
given an officer's commission in the
Air Force Reserve, with the aero
nautical rating of pilot. He then will
be assigned to active flying duty
with the Air Force, agreeing to serve
three years. Each cadet class is di
vided into three courses of approx
imately four months each. Primary
and basic training are given at Ran
dolph Field, Texas. Advanced train
ing is taken either in single-engine
planes at Williams Field, Arizona, or
in multi-engine planes at Barks
dale Field, Louisiana.
