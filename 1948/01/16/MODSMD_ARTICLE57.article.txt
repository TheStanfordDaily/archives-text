# Bailey Sees Less Hope In U.S.-Soviet Relations
## 
### MEL HOFFMAN 
"I now have lessened hope for
our success in dealing with the
Russians," commented Dr. Thomas
A. Bailey, professor of history, on
his return to Stanford after a two
quarter leave of absence during
which he spent over two months in
Europe.
Dr. Bailey talked with Ameri
can officials in Germany who
complained of great difficulty in
reaching agreement in their deal
ings with the Russians. They told
him of seemingly irreconcilable
differences in the point of view of
the two nations.
On his return from Europe, Dr.
Bailey went to Washington, D.C.,
where he taught courses in inter
national relations at the National
War College autumn quarter.
The National War College is a ci
vilian institution supported jointly
by the State Department and the
armed forces. About 100 Army,
Navy, Marine, and Air Force offi
cers and 15 State Department offi
cials attended Dr. Bailey's class
there.
He returned depressed by what
he had seen and learned in Eu
rope. He found the people appre
hensive and uncertain regarding
the future. The Marshall Plan
was announced shortly before he
arrived in Europe, and he noted
that it brought new hope to the
European masses.
Dr. Bailey's travels included visits
of a week or longer in England,
France, and Germany, and shorter
stays in Italy, Austria, Czechoslova
kia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
Belgium.
"England was not as bad as I had
been led to think," Dr. Bailey com
mented. "Generally, I found the
people there to be 'chipper'."
He found Belgium, Czechoslova
kia, and Sweden to be the most
"bustling and prosperous" nations,
while France appeared rather "un
certain and feverish."
The devastation in Germany is
still beyond belief, he said, and
the people are plainly underfed.
Dr. Bailey traveled over 2,000
miles in all zones in Germany,
spending one week in Berlin. He
visited the Ruhr ruins, Essen, Co
logne, and went to Heidelberg,

which he found to be the only town
unscratched by war.
He also saw the Dachau "horror
camps," where lesser German pris
oners are awaiting trial. While in
Prague he interviewed Jan Masa
ryk, the Czech Foreign Minister.
Dr. Bailey is professor of the
popular Diplomatic History of the
United States course (History 130),
offered spring quarter.

Russians," commented Dr. Thomas
A. Bailey, professor of history, on
his return to Stanford after a two
quarter leave of absence during
which he spent over two months in
Europe.
Dr. Bailey talked with Ameri
can officials in Germany who
complained of great difficulty in
reaching agreement in their deal
ings with the Russians. They told
him of seemingly irreconcilable
differences in the point of view of
the two nations.
On his return from Europe, Dr.
Bailey went to Washington, D.C.,
where he taught courses in inter
national relations at the National
War College autumn quarter.
The National War College is a ci
vilian institution supported jointly
by the State Department and the
armed forces. About 100 Army,
Navy, Marine, and Air Force offi
cers and 15 State Department offi
cials attended Dr. Bailey's class
there.
He returned depressed by what
he had seen and learned in Eu
rope. He found the people appre
hensive and uncertain regarding
the future. The Marshall Plan
was announced shortly before he
arrived in Europe, and he noted
that it brought new hope to the
European masses.
Dr. Bailey's travels included visits
of a week or longer in England,
France, and Germany, and shorter
stays in Italy, Austria, Czechoslova
kia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
Belgium.
"England was not as bad as I had
been led to think," Dr. Bailey com
mented. "Generally, I found the
people there to be 'chipper'."
He found Belgium, Czechoslova
kia, and Sweden to be the most
"bustling and prosperous" nations,
while France appeared rather "un
certain and feverish."
The devastation in Germany is
still beyond belief, he said, and
the people are plainly underfed.
Dr. Bailey traveled over 2,000
miles in all zones in Germany,
spending one week in Berlin. He
visited the Ruhr ruins, Essen, Co
logne, and went to Heidelberg,

which he found to be the only town
unscratched by war.
He also saw the Dachau "horror
camps," where lesser German pris
oners are awaiting trial. While in
Prague he interviewed Jan Masa
ryk, the Czech Foreign Minister.
Dr. Bailey is professor of the
popular Diplomatic History of the
United States course (History 130),
offered spring quarter.
