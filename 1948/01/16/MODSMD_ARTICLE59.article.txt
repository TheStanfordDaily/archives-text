# Band to Perform At Cal Skirmish
## 
### 
Stanford's 25 - piece basketball
band will provide half-time music
at the first home conference game
tonight against the California Bears.
''Some new numbers should add
to the spirit among the Stanford
rooters," stated band manager Bill
Warren.
This band is part of the winter
concert band which is practicing for
several newly scheduled perform
ances. The organization still needs
woodwinds, especially double reeds,
and any woman who can play an
instrument is urged to come to
practices Monday nights in the band
shack.
