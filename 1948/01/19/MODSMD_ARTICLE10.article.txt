# Rushing Lists Due at 4 p.m.
## 
### 
Four p.m. today is set as the
deadline for turning rushing prefer
ence lists in to the Interfraternity
Council office, according to Jim
Welch, council president.
The preference list system is be
ing tried for the first time this year
in an effort to give rushces a fur
ther oppotunity for becoming ac
quainted with fraternities from
which they did not receive first-pe
riod luncheon or dinner invitations.
Lists are to be made by resident
assistants at Encina and the Village.
Information to be recorded includes
the rushee's name, campus address,
and home town, and the fraternity
in which he is particularly inter
ested.
"After these lists are received in
the council office," Welch explained,
"we will inform the fraternities of
the rushces' interests. If the rush
ces co-operate, we feel certain the
system will help to overcome the
difficulties attendant to rushing
such a large number of men."
Invitational first - period meals
continue on Tuesday. Second-period
lunch and dinners are scheduled
for Thursday and Monday, Jan. 26.
The Preference Dinner will be held
on Jan. 30, with formal pledging to
follow the next morning.
