# Lagunita Faces Another Dry Spring; Dry Ice Bombs Suggested us Remedy
## 
### H. R. KLAUSER 
It looks like a promising year
for Farm humorists and their
time-worn gags about the lack
of water in Lake Lagunita, un
less something just short of a
miracle occurs in the way of
rainfall between now and March 1.
According to Carroll L. Blacker,
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds, it will take 10 inches of
fairly steady rainfall to bring the
lake up to anywhere near a usable
level. He emphasized the fact that
the scant five inches of intermittent
rain so far have had little or no effect
on the meager water supply. Due to
the intermittent nature of the rain,
most of the water has been absorbed
into the ground instead of running
off into the various storage lakes.
Scene of many a pleasant Satur
day afternoon's campus activity, the
lake will be sorely missed by all liv
ing groups, most of which maintain
canoes and rowboats for the use of
members.
CLOSED LAST YEAR
The lake was navigable for but a
short month last spring quarter when
it had to be closed for the same lack
of water; this necessitated calling off
the usual Junior Class Water Car
nival, an annual Spring event.
The present trickle into Searsville
lake, which serves as the storage
"tank" for Lake Lagunita, at its low

est ebb since 1!)34. is barely suffi
cient to supply the Farm's current,
gardening needsâ€”far short of the 115
million gallons required to fill the
lake this year.
ENCINA SOUP CURE
Last year's prize suggestion of
straining Enema Commons soup and

carrying it out to the lake or the
currently popular craze of bombard
ing cloud formations with dry ice
pellets, however delirious, appear as
the only solutions to the "not impos
sible, but highly improbable" per
plexity facing potential lake enthus
iasts.


Tlie 1 i)IS Injun won't drown either. Ten inches of steady rainfall will
he necessary to prepare Lagunita for sport enthusiasts this spring.
