## Senate, House Republicans Seek Cut in Truman's Budget 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP)—Leading Senate and House Re
publicans meet today to take their first crack at slashing President
Truman's $39,700,000,000 budget and clearing the way for pass
age of their tax-cut bill.
The conference was called to consider a "realistic" congressional ceiling
on fiscal 1949 government spending, as required by law, but it also will
devise strategy for shoving the tax-reduction proposal through Congress
over Mr. Truman's anticipated veto.
House Speaker Joseph W. Martin, Jr., who will preside, refused to
guess how much can be lopped from the President's spending figures. But
other GOP leaders have called for reduction ranging from $3,000,000,000
to $5,000,000,000 to defray part of the cost of their $5,600,000,000 tax relief
measure.
The conferees, in addition to Martin, are Chairman Robert A. Taft, 0.,
of the Senate GOP policy committee; Sen. Styles Bridges, N.H., and Rep.
John Tabern, N.Y., chairman of the Senate and House appropriations com
mittees, respectively, and Rep. Charles A. Hal leek, Ind., House GOP floor
leader.
Taft, a contender for the GOP presidential nomination, is plumping for
a "net decrease" of $3,000,000,000, including a cut of' at least $1,000,000,000
in funds for the Marshall European recovery program. Bridges is expected
to go along with Taft.
Taber is confident that Congress can cut out a minimum of $5,000,000,000,.
while Halleck talks in terms of "several billions."
