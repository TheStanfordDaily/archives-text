# Marshall Plan Attacked by Taft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP).â€”
Senator Robert A. Taft urged today
that the Marshall Plan be placed in
the hands of a "hard-boiled" ad
ministrator who would be made a
member of President Truman's
Cabinet.
Speaking on the University of
Chicago Round Table Forum, the
GOP Presidential candidate flayed
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall's plan for administering the
program and asserted the State De
partment is "only interested in giv
ing American money away for for
eign policy purposes."
He said that the four-year, $17,-
000,000,000 program must be scaled
down lest it increase American ex
ports to a "positively dangerous"
point and drive American prices
still higher.
Taft asserted that the Marshall
Plan is "almost the exact opposite"

of the Truman Doctrine to quaran
tine Communism. He said it would
"build up" France, Germany, and
Britain, nations which then could
"export goods to Russia and in turn
build up Russia."
