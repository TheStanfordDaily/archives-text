# Cards Drop Two Games To Bears, 40-34, 50-46
## Stephenson, Lewis, Pace Imdian Five 
### BILL ALLEN 
A pair of near misses was the best a couraycous Stanford
basketball team, weakened by injuries and illness, could boast
after a weekend in which the Indians fought a taller, more expe
rienced California five down to the wire twice only to lose by
close scores.
; The scores were 40 to 34 Friday night at the Pavilion and

♦50 to 46 Saturday at the Men's Gym
in Berkeley.
Three conclusions are to be drawn
from the weekend's play.
CAL'S POSITION STRONG
First, it is going to be mighty hard
to dislodge Cal from its conference
lead which has now extended to two
games over USC and UCLA, lied for
second.
Second, Stanford, with any kind
of luck, should win at least one of
its two remaining games with tin 1
Bears to end a streak of Blue and
Gold victories now standing at 10
games.
Further, the Indians should win

Student rooters' tickets for the
basketball double-headers in the
Cow Palace this weekend will be
on sale at the Athletic Depart
ment from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
today.
The games Friday niKht will be
Stanford vs. St. Mary's and Cali
fornia vs. Santa Clara. Saturday
night the Indians and the Bears
I will switch opponents.
Students must present student
body card--. to obtain tickets,
| which sell for 50 cents. None will
be available at the Cow Palace,
although a limited number of
| non-reserved general public scats
will be on sale at that time.

most of the rest of their games with
the Los Angeles schools.
Third, Chuck Hanger, Dave Mi
nor, and Andy Wolfe are going to
have to move over to make room for
a fourth outstanding southern divi
sion ball player, Stanford's Steve
Stephenson.
BEARS HAVE CLASS
As to the first point, Cal displayed
a team with real class, a team which
can play winning ball on any kind
of court, against any kind of de
fense; a coolly confident team which
can come from behind when the
pressure is on.
Stop Hanger, and Wolfe scores.
Stop them both, and George Walker,
the lean and hungry-looking "Spi
der," or one of bis teammates does
the point-making.
The Bears play five of their re
maining eight league games at home
where they are especially tough to
beat.
There is, incidentally, a three
week lapse in conference play now
while Cal and the southern schools
have their finals.
COW PALACE GAMES
Next conference games are sched
uled for Feb. 13. Stanford and Cal
meet Santa Clara and St. Mary's in
a pair of double-headers at the Cow
Palace this week.
On the second point, the Stanford
five was not at full strength for
these first two games of the series,
and even with the Indians handi
capped, the difference between the
two teams was certainly no greater
than the scores indicate. Indeed,
either game could have gone the
other way easily.
Dave Davidson, who played only
a small part of the Saturday game,
didn't suit up Friday. Regular for
wards, Morley Thompson and Bill
Rose, were seldom in the game at
the same time. Captain Babe Hig
gins, playing most of both games,
was hampered by a charley horse.
LEWIS ROUGH ON HANGER
Guard Bob Lewis, who held the
great Hanger to five field goals in
three halves of magnificent man-to
man guarding, was playing with a
bandaged leg.
And on the third point, Stephen
son's record speaks for itself. The
Indian center scored 17 points in
each game. He held the opposing
centers, Jim Smith and Bob Walker,
to 11 points total. And on the back
boards he fought on at least equal
(elms with men to whom he con
ceded two inches or more.
GAMES EXCITING
Friday night the Indians led at
the half 17 to 14, after three straight
buckets by Stephenson had over
come an early five-point Cal lead.
The Bears came back strong in
the second half as Stanford, in the
words of Coach Everett Dean, "left
their offensive in the first half." The
local five potted only five field goals
in the final period.
CAL LEADS AT HALF
At Berkeley Saturday night, the
Bears again jumped into an early
lead on shots by Wolfe and George
Walker and maintained it to the first
half gun. The Cards stayed in the
game only by cashing in on a high
percentage of their free throws.
Half-time score was 30 to 25.
In the second half Stanford aban
doned its man-to-man defense for
an equally effective zone, which
stopped everybody but Hanger. Two
baskets by Higgins and one by
Thompson brought the score to 33
to 31 after about four minutes.
The teams matched basket for
basket until, with about seven min
utes to play, the score 44 to 43, Cal,
Hanger was sent back into the game
after a brief rest and caged two
straight long one-banders and a free
throw to make it 49 to 43.
Dean had high praise for his men,
especially Bob Lewis, the sub guard
who held Hanger in check as his
part of a man -to - man defense
which the Stanford coach described
as the finest he had ever seen.

have to move over to make room for
a fourth outstanding southern divi
sion ball player, Stanford's Steve
Stephenson.
BEARS HAVE CLASS
As to the first point, Cal displayed
a team with real class, a team which
can play winning ball on any kind
of court, against any kind of de
fense; a coolly confident team which
can come from behind when the
pressure is on.
Stop Hanger, and Wolfe scores.
Stop them both, and George Walker,
the lean and hungry-looking "Spi
der," or one of bis teammates does
the point-making.
The Bears play five of their re
maining eight league games at home
where they are especially tough to
beat.
There is, incidentally, a three
week lapse in conference play now
while Cal and the southern schools
have their finals.
COW PALACE GAMES
Next conference games are sched
uled for Feb. 13. Stanford and Cal
meet Santa Clara and St. Mary's in
a pair of double-headers at the Cow
Palace this week.
On the second point, the Stanford
five was not at full strength for
these first two games of the series,
and even with the Indians handi
capped, the difference between the
two teams was certainly no greater
than the scores indicate. Indeed,
either game could have gone the
other way easily.
Dave Davidson, who played only
a small part of the Saturday game,
didn't suit up Friday. Regular for
wards, Morley Thompson and Bill
Rose, were seldom in the game at
the same time. Captain Babe Hig
gins, playing most of both games,
was hampered by a charley horse.
LEWIS ROUGH ON HANGER
Guard Bob Lewis, who held the
great Hanger to five field goals in
three halves of magnificent man-to
man guarding, was playing with a
bandaged leg.
And on the third point, Stephen
son's record speaks for itself. The
Indian center scored 17 points in
each game. He held the opposing
centers, Jim Smith and Bob Walker,
to 11 points total. And on the back
boards he fought on at least equal
(elms with men to whom he con
ceded two inches or more.
GAMES EXCITING
Friday night the Indians led at
the half 17 to 14, after three straight
buckets by Stephenson had over
come an early five-point Cal lead.
The Bears came back strong in
the second half as Stanford, in the
words of Coach Everett Dean, "left
their offensive in the first half." The
local five potted only five field goals
in the final period.
CAL LEADS AT HALF
At Berkeley Saturday night, the
Bears again jumped into an early
lead on shots by Wolfe and George
Walker and maintained it to the first
half gun. The Cards stayed in the
game only by cashing in on a high
percentage of their free throws.
Half-time score was 30 to 25.
In the second half Stanford aban
doned its man-to-man defense for
an equally effective zone, which
stopped everybody but Hanger. Two
baskets by Higgins and one by
Thompson brought the score to 33
to 31 after about four minutes.
The teams matched basket for
basket until, with about seven min
utes to play, the score 44 to 43, Cal,
Hanger was sent back into the game
after a brief rest and caged two
straight long one-banders and a free
throw to make it 49 to 43.
Dean had high praise for his men,
especially Bob Lewis, the sub guard
who held Hanger in check as his
part of a man -to - man defense
which the Stanford coach described
as the finest he had ever seen.

And on the third point, Stephen
son's record speaks for itself. The
Indian center scored 17 points in
each game. He held the opposing
centers, Jim Smith and Bob Walker,
to 11 points total. And on the back
boards he fought on at least equal
(elms with men to whom he con
ceded two inches or more.
GAMES EXCITING
Friday night the Indians led at
the half 17 to 14, after three straight
buckets by Stephenson had over
come an early five-point Cal lead.
The Bears came back strong in
the second half as Stanford, in the
words of Coach Everett Dean, "left
their offensive in the first half." The
local five potted only five field goals
in the final period.
CAL LEADS AT HALF
At Berkeley Saturday night, the
Bears again jumped into an early
lead on shots by Wolfe and George
Walker and maintained it to the first
half gun. The Cards stayed in the
game only by cashing in on a high
percentage of their free throws.
Half-time score was 30 to 25.
In the second half Stanford aban
doned its man-to-man defense for
an equally effective zone, which
stopped everybody but Hanger. Two
baskets by Higgins and one by
Thompson brought the score to 33
to 31 after about four minutes.
The teams matched basket for
basket until, with about seven min
utes to play, the score 44 to 43, Cal,
Hanger was sent back into the game
after a brief rest and caged two
straight long one-banders and a free
throw to make it 49 to 43.
Dean had high praise for his men,
especially Bob Lewis, the sub guard
who held Hanger in check as his
part of a man -to - man defense
which the Stanford coach described
as the finest he had ever seen.

A pair of near misses was the best a couraycous Stanford
basketball team, weakened by injuries and illness, could boast
after a weekend in which the Indians fought a taller, more expe
rienced California five down to the wire twice only to lose by
close scores.
; The scores were 40 to 34 Friday night at the Pavilion and

♦50 to 46 Saturday at the Men's Gym
in Berkeley.
Three conclusions are to be drawn
from the weekend's play.
CAL'S POSITION STRONG
First, it is going to be mighty hard
to dislodge Cal from its conference
lead which has now extended to two
games over USC and UCLA, lied for
second.
Second, Stanford, with any kind
of luck, should win at least one of
its two remaining games with tin 1
Bears to end a streak of Blue and
Gold victories now standing at 10
games.

the Los Angeles schools.
Third, Chuck Hanger, Dave Mi
nor, and Andy Wolfe are going to
have to move over to make room for
a fourth outstanding southern divi
sion ball player, Stanford's Steve
Stephenson.
BEARS HAVE CLASS
As to the first point, Cal displayed
a team with real class, a team which
can play winning ball on any kind
of court, against any kind of de
fense; a coolly confident team which
can come from behind when the
pressure is on.
Stop Hanger, and Wolfe scores.
Stop them both, and George Walker,
the lean and hungry-looking "Spi

The Bears play five of their re

have their finals.
COW PALACE GAMES

On the second point, the Stanford
five was not at full strength for
these first two games of the series,
and even with the Indians handi
capped, the difference between the
two teams was certainly no greater
than the scores indicate. Indeed,
either game could have gone the
other way easily.
Dave Davidson, who played only
a small part of the Saturday game,
didn't suit up Friday. Regular for
wards, Morley Thompson and Bill
Rose, were seldom in the game at
the same time. Captain Babe Hig
gins, playing most of both games,
was hampered by a charley horse.
LEWIS ROUGH ON HANGER

great Hanger to five field goals in
three halves of magnificent man-to
man guarding, was playing with a
bandaged leg.

Dave Davidson, who played only
a small part of the Saturday game,
didn't suit up Friday. Regular for
wards, Morley Thompson and Bill
Rose, were seldom in the game at
the same time. Captain Babe Hig
gins, playing most of both games,
was hampered by a charley horse.
LEWIS ROUGH ON HANGER
Guard Bob Lewis, who held the
great Hanger to five field goals in
three halves of magnificent man-to
man guarding, was playing with a
bandaged leg.
And on the third point, Stephen
son's record speaks for itself. The
Indian center scored 17 points in
each game. He held the opposing
centers, Jim Smith and Bob Walker,
to 11 points total. And on the back
boards he fought on at least equal
(elms with men to whom he con
ceded two inches or more.
GAMES EXCITING
Friday night the Indians led at
the half 17 to 14, after three straight
buckets by Stephenson had over
come an early five-point Cal lead.
The Bears came back strong in
the second half as Stanford, in the
words of Coach Everett Dean, "left
their offensive in the first half." The
local five potted only five field goals
in the final period.
CAL LEADS AT HALF
At Berkeley Saturday night, the
Bears again jumped into an early
lead on shots by Wolfe and George
Walker and maintained it to the first
half gun. The Cards stayed in the
game only by cashing in on a high
percentage of their free throws.
Half-time score was 30 to 25.
In the second half Stanford aban
doned its man-to-man defense for
an equally effective zone, which
stopped everybody but Hanger. Two
baskets by Higgins and one by
Thompson brought the score to 33
to 31 after about four minutes.
The teams matched basket for
basket until, with about seven min
utes to play, the score 44 to 43, Cal,
Hanger was sent back into the game
after a brief rest and caged two
straight long one-banders and a free
throw to make it 49 to 43.
Dean had high praise for his men,
especially Bob Lewis, the sub guard
who held Hanger in check as his
part of a man -to - man defense
which the Stanford coach described
as the finest he had ever seen.

A pair of near misses was the best a couraycous Stanford
basketball team, weakened by injuries and illness, could boast
after a weekend in which the Indians fought a taller, more expe
rienced California five down to the wire twice only to lose by
close scores.
; The scores were 40 to 34 Friday night at the Pavilion and

♦50 to 46 Saturday at the Men's Gym
in Berkeley.
Three conclusions are to be drawn
from the weekend's play.
CAL'S POSITION STRONG
First, it is going to be mighty hard
to dislodge Cal from its conference
lead which has now extended to two
games over USC and UCLA, lied for
second.
Second, Stanford, with any kind
of luck, should win at least one of
its two remaining games with tin 1
Bears to end a streak of Blue and
Gold victories now standing at 10
games.
Further, the Indians should win

most of the rest of their games with
the Los Angeles schools.
Third, Chuck Hanger, Dave Mi
nor, and Andy Wolfe are going to
have to move over to make room for
a fourth outstanding southern divi
sion ball player, Stanford's Steve
Stephenson.
BEARS HAVE CLASS
As to the first point, Cal displayed
a team with real class, a team which
can play winning ball on any kind
of court, against any kind of de
fense; a coolly confident team which
can come from behind when the
pressure is on.
Stop Hanger, and Wolfe scores.
Stop them both, and George Walker,
the lean and hungry-looking "Spi
der," or one of bis teammates does
the point-making.
The Bears play five of their re
