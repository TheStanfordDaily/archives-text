A pair of near misses was the best a couraycous Stanford
basketball team, weakened by injuries and illness, could boast
after a weekend in which the Indians fought a taller, more expe
rienced California five down to the wire twice only to lose by
close scores.
; The scores were 40 to 34 Friday night at the Pavilion and

♦50 to 46 Saturday at the Men's Gym
in Berkeley.
Three conclusions are to be drawn
from the weekend's play.
