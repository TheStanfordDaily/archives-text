## 
### 
Last Friday night when Jennie
Tourel had finished her perform- j
anee, when she had satisfied the au- j
dience's enthusiastic applause with ;
several encores, when she had made j
many curtain calls, the audience j
realized why she is considered the I
Metropolitan's leading mezzo - so
prano.
) The numbers which seemed to
please the audience most wei-e
Schubert's ever-popular "Ave Ma
ria" and "Standchen"—more com- ;
monly known as Schubert's "Sere
nade" — and the famous aria from
St. Saens' "Samson and Delilah" —
"My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice."
With the singing of the "Habanera."
from "Carmen," Miss Tourel had
the audience at her feet, begging
for more.
Although a mezzo-soprano, the
singer seemed to rise to a soprano
and drop to a contralto as though
they were her range. Her voice was
beautiful and flawless throughout
the two hours of her performance.
Her manner of presentation was
such that each member of the au
dience felt as though she were sing
-1 ing directly to him.
It is regrettable thai, when an ar- j
list of Miss Tourel's capacity makes
an appearance at Stanford, several
performances cannot be presented
to enable a larger number of stu
dents to enjoy the artist.
