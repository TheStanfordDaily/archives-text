# NSA Functions On Farm Defined
## 
### 
NSA's function on campus will be
two-fold: assisting Excom and car
rying out all liaison with other mem
ber schools in the region.
Such Excom matters that require
further investigation, clarification, or
committee work, which Excom as a
policy making body will not neces
sarily have the technical knowledge
to carry out â€”may be referred to
members of the NSA.
Using the work of its Central Com
mittee members, plus drawing on
campus personnel, NSA can then re
turn the matter to Excom for fur
ther consideration.
Regionally, NSA will bring to
Stanford publications and informa
tion concerning activities carried on
by all NSA domestic and interna
tional subcommissions at other
schools, such as films from UCLA.
"It is felt that by constituting a
NSA as a small centralized group,
the requirements of temporary as
well as standing committees can best
be met.
"This group does not intend to 'be
NSA,' but is merely the committee
which decides on policy matters and
from which chairmanship is derived.
The campus will be drawn from at
every possible opportunity when
specific problems arise which need
personnel," stated NSA chairman
Ginny Titus.
