## 
### 
"It is a pleasure to send greetings
j to the Constitutional Convention of
the National Student Association—
i Our Faith in Education requires no
apology or defense ....
"We should welcome hopefully the
j formation of any organization that
i has as one of its prime objectives a
i constructive effort to improve the
! quality of the services in institu
tions of higher education. I congrat
ulate your group on the opportunity
that lies before it. . .
—Harry S. Truman.
President of the
United States 1
The series of events leading to this
! presidential message began in 1940
when 25 American students met in j
New York City as the group to rep- |
resent the United Stales at the World
Student Congress in Prague.
Since 10 had been elected by stud
ent bodies (Fisk, Chicago, Harvard,
Texas) while 15 were from student
organizations (YM-YWCA, Newman
Club Federation, AYD), the stud
ents realized that they did not repre
sent Americans to the students of
the world.
CAMPUS OPINION
By coming into contact with dele
gates from European unions of stud
ents, the American representatives
saw that they were far out-ranked,
and wire determined to sound out
! campus opinion on the formation of
| a national student organization.
Three hundred colleges and uni
versities placed their tentative ap
proval on the NSA by sending dele
gates to a planning conference at the
University ot Chicago in December,
1946. The 700 delegates decided to
organize the "United States National
Student Association."
756 DELEGATES
Last summer some 75G delegates
(representing 1,389,000 U. S. stud
ents), who attended a Constitutional

Convention at the University of Wis
consin, launched an organization
which will give the American col
lege student "unprecedented repre
sentation in the educational world."
Aims and purposes of the USNSA
are contained in the preamble to the
constitution, with fuller explanation
and clarification in the by-laws and
panel reports.
Existing national youth groups will
have neither voting nor advisory re
presentation in the permanent US
NSA. Only officially constituted stu
dent governing bodies will be auth
orized to send representatives to Na
tional Student Congresses each sum
mer.

"It is a pleasure to send greetings
j to the Constitutional Convention of
the National Student Association—
i Our Faith in Education requires no
apology or defense ....
"We should welcome hopefully the
j formation of any organization that
i has as one of its prime objectives a
i constructive effort to improve the
! quality of the services in institu
tions of higher education. I congrat
ulate your group on the opportunity
that lies before it. . .
—Harry S. Truman.
President of the
United States 1
The series of events leading to this
! presidential message began in 1940
when 25 American students met in j
New York City as the group to rep- |
resent the United Stales at the World
Student Congress in Prague.
Since 10 had been elected by stud
ent bodies (Fisk, Chicago, Harvard,
Texas) while 15 were from student
organizations (YM-YWCA, Newman
Club Federation, AYD), the stud
ents realized that they did not repre
sent Americans to the students of
the world.
CAMPUS OPINION
By coming into contact with dele
gates from European unions of stud
ents, the American representatives
saw that they were far out-ranked,
and wire determined to sound out
! campus opinion on the formation of
| a national student organization.
Three hundred colleges and uni
versities placed their tentative ap
proval on the NSA by sending dele
gates to a planning conference at the
University ot Chicago in December,
1946. The 700 delegates decided to
organize the "United States National
Student Association."
756 DELEGATES
Last summer some 75G delegates
(representing 1,389,000 U. S. stud
ents), who attended a Constitutional

Convention at the University of Wis
consin, launched an organization
which will give the American col
lege student "unprecedented repre
sentation in the educational world."
Aims and purposes of the USNSA
are contained in the preamble to the
constitution, with fuller explanation
and clarification in the by-laws and
panel reports.
Existing national youth groups will
have neither voting nor advisory re
presentation in the permanent US
NSA. Only officially constituted stu
dent governing bodies will be auth
orized to send representatives to Na
tional Student Congresses each sum
