# Stanford Frosh Quintet Wins Twice from Cubs
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford's hopes for future basketball success received a
shot in the arm over the weekend when the Farm's freshman
cagers showed fine ability and know-how in downing California's
yearlings by scores of 41 to 39 and 35 to 30.
Marvin Gelber's sensational 50-foot one-handed shot from

the dead run in the last three sec- j
onds of play gave the Indian frosh |
a 41 to 39 win in Friday's prelimi
nary contest.
SETZER MISSES
With the score tied at 35) all, Cal's
Jack Setzer missed what appeared
to be the last opportunity to win
in the regular period when he failed
to make a free throw. Gelber re
ceived the ball from Dick Clegg
under the Cal basket, dribbled down
court to within about five feet of
the center line, and cast loose the
game-winning shot.
The contest was close all the way,
with the final outcome never a fore
gone conclusion. Cal got off to an
early 12 to 6 lead, but three straight
baskets by Farm forward Paul Wat
son knotted the score at 12-all. Field
goals by Ken Gardner and Fran
Watson, coupled with Harold Cam
pen's gift toss, gave the Stanforclites
a 17 to 14 lead at half time.
Although the visiting Bears tied
the count twice in the final half, the
Card juniors were never headed in
that period. At one point they led
by a seven-point margin, 33 to 26;
but the Berkeley yearlings hit for
seven quick tallies to draw even at
33 to 33.
Field goals by Clegg, Paul Wat
son, and Fran Watson put the In
dians in the lead once again only to
have the count tied up at 39-ail with
five seconds left in the game. At
this point Gelber took it upon him
self to end the proceedings with his
long two-pointer.
WATSON PACES SCORERS
High man for the evening was
Cal's Bill Wirth, who tanked 18.
Paul Watson and Fran Watson (no
relation) paced the Stanford squad
with 14 and 9 points respectively.
The return match on Saturday
found the Stanford lads on the long
end of a 35 to 30 score. First-half
play was e"en, with the count tied
at 11—all ,dway in the first half
and 17 tr I at the intermission.
Fran T /son took over the scor
ing hoi \ for the evening with 12
points. i of them in the first seven
minut of play.
Pai ,W. ison, who is the current
high jorer for the Stanford fresh
men fas definitely off in Saturday's
plf making only one field goal.
D ite his comparatively short
112 lire, the shot - making forward
1 ped big Bill Herron and Gelber
ntrol the backboard play for the
/eater part of the game.
Good defensive work by the Card
yearlings held the Bear juniors to
one free throw in the first ten min
utes of the second half while the
Farm men were hitting for nine to
make the score read 26 to 18.
The Bears drew near when the
score stood at 26 to 25, but Gelber's
free throw and drive - in lay - up
started the Stanford men on a scor
ing splurge that put them safely
out in front and they went on to
win, 35 to 30.
Coach Jack Dana's shifting man
to-man defense worked very well in
the two contests. Dana's lads held
the highly touted Gene Garfinkle to
but three points in both games.

Stanford's hopes for future basketball success received a
shot in the arm over the weekend when the Farm's freshman
cagers showed fine ability and know-how in downing California's
yearlings by scores of 41 to 39 and 35 to 30.
Marvin Gelber's sensational 50-foot one-handed shot from

the dead run in the last three sec- j
onds of play gave the Indian frosh |
a 41 to 39 win in Friday's prelimi
nary contest.
SETZER MISSES
With the score tied at 35) all, Cal's
Jack Setzer missed what appeared
to be the last opportunity to win
in the regular period when he failed
to make a free throw. Gelber re
ceived the ball from Dick Clegg
under the Cal basket, dribbled down
court to within about five feet of
the center line, and cast loose the
game-winning shot.
The contest was close all the way,
with the final outcome never a fore
gone conclusion. Cal got off to an
early 12 to 6 lead, but three straight
baskets by Farm forward Paul Wat
son knotted the score at 12-all. Field
goals by Ken Gardner and Fran
Watson, coupled with Harold Cam
pen's gift toss, gave the Stanforclites
a 17 to 14 lead at half time.
Although the visiting Bears tied
the count twice in the final half, the
Card juniors were never headed in
that period. At one point they led
by a seven-point margin, 33 to 26;
but the Berkeley yearlings hit for
seven quick tallies to draw even at
33 to 33.
Field goals by Clegg, Paul Wat
son, and Fran Watson put the In
dians in the lead once again only to
have the count tied up at 39-ail with
five seconds left in the game. At
this point Gelber took it upon him
self to end the proceedings with his
long two-pointer.
WATSON PACES SCORERS
High man for the evening was
Cal's Bill Wirth, who tanked 18.
Paul Watson and Fran Watson (no
relation) paced the Stanford squad
with 14 and 9 points respectively.
The return match on Saturday
found the Stanford lads on the long
end of a 35 to 30 score. First-half
play was e"en, with the count tied
at 11—all ,dway in the first half
and 17 tr I at the intermission.
Fran T /son took over the scor
ing hoi \ for the evening with 12

minut of play.

plf making only one field goal.
D ite his comparatively short
112 lire, the shot - making forward
1 ped big Bill Herron and Gelber
ntrol the backboard play for the
/eater part of the game.
Good defensive work by the Card
yearlings held the Bear juniors to
one free throw in the first ten min
utes of the second half while the
Farm men were hitting for nine to
make the score read 26 to 18.
The Bears drew near when the
score stood at 26 to 25, but Gelber's
free throw and drive - in lay - up
started the Stanford men on a scor
ing splurge that put them safely
out in front and they went on to
win, 35 to 30.
Coach Jack Dana's shifting man
to-man defense worked very well in
the two contests. Dana's lads held
the highly touted Gene Garfinkle to
but three points in both games.

out in front and they went on to
win, 35 to 30.
Coach Jack Dana's shifting man

Stanford's hopes for future basketball success received a
shot in the arm over the weekend when the Farm's freshman
cagers showed fine ability and know-how in downing California's
yearlings by scores of 41 to 39 and 35 to 30.
Marvin Gelber's sensational 50-foot one-handed shot from

the dead run in the last three sec- j
onds of play gave the Indian frosh |
a 41 to 39 win in Friday's prelimi
nary contest.
SETZER MISSES
With the score tied at 35) all, Cal's
Jack Setzer missed what appeared
to be the last opportunity to win
in the regular period when he failed
to make a free throw. Gelber re
ceived the ball from Dick Clegg
under the Cal basket, dribbled down
court to within about five feet of
the center line, and cast loose the
game-winning shot.
The contest was close all the way,
with the final outcome never a fore
gone conclusion. Cal got off to an
early 12 to 6 lead, but three straight
baskets by Farm forward Paul Wat
son knotted the score at 12-all. Field
goals by Ken Gardner and Fran
Watson, coupled with Harold Cam
pen's gift toss, gave the Stanforclites
a 17 to 14 lead at half time.
Although the visiting Bears tied
the count twice in the final half, the
Card juniors were never headed in
that period. At one point they led
by a seven-point margin, 33 to 26;
but the Berkeley yearlings hit for
seven quick tallies to draw even at
33 to 33.
Field goals by Clegg, Paul Wat
son, and Fran Watson put the In
dians in the lead once again only to
have the count tied up at 39-ail with
five seconds left in the game. At
this point Gelber took it upon him
self to end the proceedings with his
long two-pointer.
