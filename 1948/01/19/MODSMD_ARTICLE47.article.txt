## Soph Spark Track Squad 
### JACK BLOOD 
'"The Cardinal track team this
year, while basically a sophomore
team, will show much improvement
over the 1947 team." This in so
many words expresses the opinion
of Track Coach Jack Weiershauser.
Key men in Coach Weiershauser's
plans are Bud Held, Otis Chandler,
Larry HofT, A 1 Lyons, and Bob
Woodâ€”all sophomores.
Held threw the javelin 212 ft. 10
in. last year before injuring his arm.
His arm is back in shape now and
he has hit the 180-ft. mark in prac
tice. Chandler has already sur
passed his frosh record with a heave
of 49 ft. 10 in. in the shot. Hoff has
run the 440 in 49 flat and should im
prove on that. Lyons is expected to
fill the vacancy in the distances left
by Frank Ganahl's tragic death. His
best mile is 4:33. He ran the hall in
2:02 last fall. Sprinter Bob Woods
is expected to better his marks of
10:1 in the 100 and 22.4 in the 220
which he set la"' spring.
JOHNSON IS QL ARTER-MILER
Other second-ye tr men on whom
Weiershauser is counting heavily
include Franklin Johnson, who has
run the quarter in 49.4; Steve Mc-
Kee, who has already beaten his
marks of 46 ft. 11 in. in the shot and
142 ft. in the discus; Skip Kent and
Dell Russell, a pair of 14.8 high hur
dlers; Jose Rael, an excellent two-,
mile prospect; Norman Nourse, who
has put the shot 45 ft.; Fred Fank,
a 23-ft. broad jumper; Don Auxier,
a 6-ft. 1-in. high jumper; and Bud
Richter, a promising sprinter.
In addition to these sophomores,
a number of upperelassmen are in
cluded in the list of 17 returning
lettermen. Juniors Bob Ghilotti and
Gay Bryan have both cleared 6 ft.
2 in. in the high. Bryan also placed
third in the Big Meet last year with
a 22-ft. 10-in. effort and could be
a good prospect in the low hurdles
and relay if he continues his im
provement. Other retuning juniors
are half - milers A 1 Holubar and
Berny Wagner who have been
clocked at 1:56 and 1:59.5 respec
tively. Bob Mclnerney, who ran the
440 in 49.5 and then droppedout of
school, is now back.
McKEE. WHIPPLE JOIN SQUAI)
Transfer students Downing Mc-
Kee from Bakersfield JC, who won
the West Coast high hurdle crown
with 4.7 last year, and John Whip
ple from Menlo JC, who has thrown
the discus 40 ft., are important ad
ditions to the squad.
Lettermen returning for their last
year of competition are Terry Max
well, who ran the 220 in 22.1 and
bettered 48.5 in the relay lap last
year; Marty Anderson, team cap
tain in 1946. who has run the hun
dred in 9.9, broad jumped 22 ft. 10
in., and pole vaulted 12 ft. 6 in.;
A 1 Wilkins, letterman the last two
years who has run the quarter in
49 flat and will spark the relay team
again; Bill Larson, a consistent 13-
ft. pole vaulter; Chuck Coker,
whose best mark with the javelin is
188 ft. and who hurled it 183 ft.
6 in. the other evening.
