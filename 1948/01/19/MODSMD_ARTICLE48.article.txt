# Indian Mittmen Squelch City College Bid, Salvage 4-4 Tie
## 
### BILL BETHKE 
Fistic Coach Ray Lunny got a big scare iast Friday afternoon
when an underrated San Francisco JC boxing team almost turned
the tables on the Card squad. A jam-packed gallery in the
Encina gym cheered lustily for two hours as they watched the
home fighters make a thrilling comeback in the last five bouts

to gain a 4-4 tie on the afternoon's
scoreboard.
After the first hour's fighting even
the possibility of a tic looked slim
as Roy Diedrickson's City boys led
4-0.
Game but outclassed. Eddie O'Neil
(S) lost to Johnny Fisher (SF) in
the 120 lb. bracket.
Later Coach Lunny likened the
match to a struggle between a de- j
stroyer and a battleship. But O'Neil
was a destroyer that wouldn't sink.
He refused to go down and countered
with some potent blows of his own. j
SAVAGE, ALIUS LOSE
Jay Savage (S) and Dick Spar
goss (SF) tangled at 130 lbs. Spar
goss outpointed his man to give the
visitors a 2-0 count. Shep Insel (S)
and Dick Whitely met at 135 lbs.
next and gave the fans one of the
best fights of the day. Again the SF
man came through. Roy Demas (SF)
extinguished the Stanford victory
hopes in the fourth bout when he |
won over Willie Altus (S) and put j
his team ahead 4-0.

The shouting fans made no effort
to leave the ringside, however. Their
shouts became louder after the next
three rounds when Dick Stanton (S)
decisioned Jim Willson (SF) at 155
lbs. to give the hosts their first win
of the afternoon.
TEN EYCK WINS
Skies looked brighter when the
Oren Rush (S)-Bob Flashman (SF.)
fight had to be stopped in the third
round after Flashman had taken too
much punishment. The 155 lb. bout
was an exhibition-no decision affair,
however; and Stanford was still be
hind 4-1.
Fred Ten Eyck (S) won over Hi- i
ram Short at the IGS lb. weight and j
the Cards had started their offens- [
ive. Ten Eyck, the all-U IGS-lb. !
champ, was praised by both coaches
as doing the best boxing of the af- |

ternoon. Boring through the long
armed defense of Short, Ten Eyck
popped in and out, landed more
blows, and was the aggressor
throughout the fight.
Joe Cranmer (S) won on a split
decision over Henry Williams (SF)
after the 175-1 b. match was halted
in the second round. Williams cut
Cranmer's forehead to stop the fray,
but Cranmer, ahead on points, was
awarded the decision according to a
new ruling.
Chuck Coker gave his Stanford
teammates their fourth and tying
victory of the afternoon when he
took a close decision from Johnny
Brown in the heavyweight class.
Brown was outweighed by 35 pounds,
but Coker was out of condition and
had recently recovered from the flu.
The unflinching Brown went the en
tire distance with Coker and several
times stood toe to toe with him and
slugged it out.

Joe Cranmer (S) won on a split
decision over Henry Williams (SF)
after the 175-1 b. match was halted
in the second round. Williams cut
Cranmer's forehead to stop the fray,
but Cranmer, ahead on points, was
awarded the decision according to a
new ruling.
Chuck Coker gave his Stanford
teammates their fourth and tying
victory of the afternoon when he
took a close decision from Johnny
Brown in the heavyweight class.
Brown was outweighed by 35 pounds,
but Coker was out of condition and
had recently recovered from the flu.
The unflinching Brown went the en
tire distance with Coker and several
times stood toe to toe with him and
slugged it out.
Fistic Coach Ray Lunny got a big scare iast Friday afternoon
when an underrated San Francisco JC boxing team almost turned
the tables on the Card squad. A jam-packed gallery in the
Encina gym cheered lustily for two hours as they watched the
home fighters make a thrilling comeback in the last five bouts

to gain a 4-4 tie on the afternoon's
scoreboard.
After the first hour's fighting even
the possibility of a tic looked slim
as Roy Diedrickson's City boys led
4-0.
Game but outclassed. Eddie O'Neil
(S) lost to Johnny Fisher (SF) in
the 120 lb. bracket.
Later Coach Lunny likened the
match to a struggle between a de- j
stroyer and a battleship. But O'Neil
was a destroyer that wouldn't sink.
He refused to go down and countered
with some potent blows of his own. j
SAVAGE, ALIUS LOSE
Jay Savage (S) and Dick Spar
goss (SF) tangled at 130 lbs. Spar
goss outpointed his man to give the
visitors a 2-0 count. Shep Insel (S)

next and gave the fans one of the
best fights of the day. Again the SF
man came through. Roy Demas (SF)
extinguished the Stanford victory
hopes in the fourth bout when he |
won over Willie Altus (S) and put j
his team ahead 4-0.

The shouting fans made no effort
to leave the ringside, however. Their
shouts became louder after the next
three rounds when Dick Stanton (S)
decisioned Jim Willson (SF) at 155
lbs. to give the hosts their first win
of the afternoon.
TEN EYCK WINS
Skies looked brighter when the
Oren Rush (S)-Bob Flashman (SF.)
fight had to be stopped in the third
round after Flashman had taken too
much punishment. The 155 lb. bout
was an exhibition-no decision affair,
however; and Stanford was still be
hind 4-1.
Fred Ten Eyck (S) won over Hi- i
ram Short at the IGS lb. weight and j
the Cards had started their offens- [
ive. Ten Eyck, the all-U IGS-lb. !
champ, was praised by both coaches
as doing the best boxing of the af- |

ternoon. Boring through the long
armed defense of Short, Ten Eyck
popped in and out, landed more
blows, and was the aggressor
throughout the fight.
