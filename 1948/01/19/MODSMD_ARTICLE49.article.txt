# PCC RACE
## Cal, Oregon Open Leads 
### 
Pacific Coast Confrence basket
hall results over the weekend
showed California taking a com
manding two - game lead in the
Southern Division by virtue of two
close wins over Stanford, while Or
egon edged to the front in the
Northern Loop with a thrilling 42
to 41 victory over Oregon State
Saturday night.
The Bear manhandling dropped
the Indians four games off the pace
and two games behind UCLA and
USC, who traded wins in the South
land and are tied for second in the
loop with a .500 rating. USC took
the Friday night engagement 56 to
42 with a devastating last-half at
tack, but the Bruins came back Sat
urday with a tight 51 to 50 victory
determined by Johnny Stanich's
tip-in in the last eight seconds of
play.
Oregon took a slim lead in thi
north with the Webfoot win over
Oregon State, coupled with last
week's victory over Washington, but
the race remains tighter than the
proverbial Farm purse-strings. Only
a game and a half separates Oregon
from cellar - dwelling Washington
State.
