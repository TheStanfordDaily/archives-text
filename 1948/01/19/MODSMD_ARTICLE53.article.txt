# How About It, Professors?
## 
### 
The following editorial may be filed in the
"if the shoe fits you, wear it" department.
A faculty member of the Romanic Language
department v/as reported to have made the
following statement:
"All students taking Spanish courses should
only take 13 units."
One would assume that the professor meant
that there was so much work to Spanish courses
that a student would be unable to devote suffi
cient time to a full course of 15 units or more.
Judging by numerous protests on the part
of students taking courses in Spanish this may
well be a fundamental concept held by the
department.
At any rate it is an unhealthy attitude. If

all departments had similar views how long
would it take a student to graduate?
When would a student find time to do all
this work?
Students have always realized that a large
discrepancy exists between the different depart
ments in regards to the amount of work re
quired per unit. Much could be done by the
faculty towards equalizing these work require
ments.
But limiting students to 13 units is not the
desirable solution.
Limiting the professors in the amount of
work they can assign would probably come
nearer to solving the problem.
