It has always been my belief that Alaska should
be given statehood—and now I feel it should be given
to her immediately. The most important reason is that
Alaska is defenseless.
Fifty-four miles or so across the Bering Strait
lies Siberia. If Moscow were so minded, Russia could
easily take Alaska with one air-borne division. By
our neglect of this strategic piece of land, we could
easily fce inviting another Pearl Harbor.
Many people ask just what statehood has got to
do with defense. Just this: that if Alaska rose to
dignity, influence and rights of a stale, it would have,
among its other advantages, two United States Senators
and a Representative to get up on their "hind legs"
and demand recognition of Alaska's vital strategic
importance. At present, the territory has one harried,
overworked, voteless delegate.
There are many other reasons why Alaska should
have statehood, and none of the three main arguments
against it has any real weight. One argument is that
Alaska is not contiguous. Neither is Hawaii, and the
House of Representatives has already passed a bill
to admit Hawaii. But what in the world has contiguity
got to do with it, anyway?
The second argument is based upon the fact that

Alaska has too small a population. Alaska has 90,000
inhabitants, a small population indeed, but Illinois had
only 40,000 when it was admitted in 1818, and Missouri,
which was admitted three years later, had only 55,000.
The granting of statehood would greatly stimulate
population growth by homesteading for veterans and
other means.
The third reason is that statehood would increase
Alaskan taxation. So it would to some extent raise
the very low taxes now paid. But isn't it interesting
to note that the biggest fuss made on the taxation
question comes from the absentee-owned salmon in
dustry and the absentee-owned and monopolistic ship
ping industry?
These people, who have long been profiting by
the wealth of Alaska, are not public-spirited enough
and are so dominated by greed that they will not pay
their share to give the territory the status it deserves.
All of the problems—military, economic, educa
tional, judicial—of Alaska, which have been shame
lessly neglected at Washington for generations, revolve
around its inferior status as a territory. Only when
this "stepchild" becomes a part of the Union will it
come into its rightful position.
