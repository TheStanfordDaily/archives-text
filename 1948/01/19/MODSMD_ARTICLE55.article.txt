# CAMPUS OPINION
## Political Freedom 
### 
To the Editor:
As one of the circulators of the petition to Excom
for the proposed by-law on the subject of political
groups I would like to explain why this by-law was
proposed and what effect it would have if adopted.
Early in fall quarter Excom passed a ruling that
no "partisan political-action group" would be given a
charter. It is university policy that only groups ap
proved by Excom can use university buildings, so at
present political groups arc effectively barred from
campus.
Excom's ruling was partially based upon the opin
ion that there was a prohibtion against political meet
ings and political speakers at Stanford in the founding
grant. At a later meeting Excom was given the infor
mation that this prohibition was not in the founding
grant, but in a 1924 ruling of the Board of Trustees.
A re-vote was taken on the basis of this information,
but Excom sustained its former action.
There is a large amount of evidence in the Daily
files that this ruling has rarely been put into effect
at Stanford. Political speakers have ranged from Wil
liam Jennings Bryan in 1896 to Norman Thomas in
193 H. In the one election year of 1932 "Young Demo
crats,"' "Stanford for Roosevelt," and Socialist clubs
were politically active on campus.
The proposed by-law states that Excom shall not
discriminate against any group on the grounds of
partisan political character. It does not state that
Excom shall charter such a group. Excom can still
refuse a charter on the grounds of a request by the
Board of Trustees. In other words, a referendum on
the by-law is not a referendum on the ruling of the
Board of Trustees. It is a referendum on Excom's
ruling alone. Such a referendum would be an expres
sion of the Stanford student body as to whether it
chooses to affirm or deny its tradition of political
freedom.

capable of dealing with its own problems; not a com
mittee "not representative" as stated by the president
of Men's Council. The group could only make a rec
ommendation, but Excom thought enough of this rec
ommendation to give it official sanction on Dec. 3,
submitting the decision to the councils for administra
tion.
The assessments were published; there were no
comments; no angry letters; in fact, no comment from
anyone. The pajamarino committee settled back to
watch their apparently acceptable decision go through
the proper, mechanical channels, thus closing an inci
dent which had left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
A few days ago. however, a new decision was sud
denly reached, one which penalizes a few of the guilty,
many of the guiltless, and completely exonerates many
who were directly responsible for the damages. Strange,
the class of '50, now involved, was not notified that
the councils were busily respinning the wheels of juris
diction. It is also strange that the lowest campus
traffic violator is given an opportunity to appear before
these jurists and speak in his behalf, a privilege not
accorded to us. Strange, also, that the ASSU consti
tution says "Violators shall be dealt with by the ap
propriate division of the Council of Student Control
after just notice and fair hearing."
The president of Men's Council states that now he
is fixing responsibility "on those groups which might
have provided for a well-organized pajamarino." Was
the class of '50 consulted before the pajamarino and
given certain "responsibilities," such that the carrying
out of the same would have resulted in a fine rally?
Was the class of '50 given instructions before the rally
and are they any more responsible than the rest of the
campus for the poor organization? The answers are
emphatically, No.'
By "fixing responsibility" upon the scapegoats most
easily found, our jurists have squirmed out of a dif
ficult decision, hoping that a lesson will be admistered
to the future bad boysfjf Stanford. However, they have
overlooked administering justice to many parties con
cerned at present.
The fact that few of our class were present at
Roble; the fact that certainly no Sophomore women
were present; the fact that vandalism was organized by
living group units and not by the class, does not
seem to be conclusive enough evidence for our jurists.
The fact recommendations were previously made
does not concern our all-powerful councils; the fact
that the other side of the story was not asked for and
a fair hearing was not conducted, also does not hamper
the judicial arm of Stanford. In disregard to previous
recommendation and testimony, the councils have
merrily pushed aside a tremendous mound of evidence
and fact and prescribed a remedy as backward and
inconsistent with the facts as is humany possible.
During a recent conference with the President of
Men's Council, in which the above arguments were
presented, we were received with a sympathetic but
deaf ear. We were given no promise or even hope that
the case might be re-opened, in lieu of the fact
that the decision reached was possibly unfair. For
it was agreed our arguments were valid but after
all, "responsibility must be fixed." We were politely
told that if we were not satisfied with the decision we
should open the matter up again publicly to the entire
campus. Well, we are not satisfied, and are therefore,
presenting our case to you.
HANK ROSIN,
In behalf of the Class of 50.
