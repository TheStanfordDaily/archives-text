# Axe Is Theme As 1948 Quad Gets Rolling
## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Amidst an atmosphere of
| blowing up pictures, meeting
' deadlines, cutting and pasting,
j writing copy, and general con
fusion, the 1948 Quad is pro
gressing on the schedule that calls
for distribution of the Yearbook in
June, according to Bill McPherson,
editor.
Utilizing a number of different
modes of arrangements and a differ
ent type of cover, this Quad promises
| to be one of the best Quads in years,
McPherson said.
I SENIOR SEC TION
"For instance," he said, "the Sen
| ior Section is organized into schools,
with individual pictures arranged ac
cording to the school in which the
senior is graduating." Nine schools
are represented, including the three
graduate schools—Business, Law and
Medicine. The new School of Min
eral Sciences v/ill be included with
the School of Physical Sciences."
In addition to individual pictures,
each school division will contain an
introductory page of shots of the pro
fessors in the particular school and
candids, and at the end a page pic
ture of the members of the honorary
Greek fraternities associated with
that school.
"We feel that in doing this we will
give fuller coverage than before," he
explained. "This Senior Section will
be twice as large as any other senior
section ever put out, since there are
1500 seniors as compared with some
800 last year."
116 PAGES
"The 1948 Quad is larger than last
year with 410 pages,' he continued,
| "and the theme is the axe, which
will he also carried out in the cover."
Aside from terming the cover "in
teresting," McPherson refused to
give further details. "The idea hasn't
been used in the last 10 years,
though," he admitted.
The Quad will have five divisions,
Administration, Schools or Senior
Section, Activities, Sports, and Liv
ing Groups. Fifty activities, including
five international groups, are pre
sent in the Activities Section, Mc-
Pherson said.
"This is more than has ever been
in the Quad before,'' he explained.
CANDID SHOTS
Each living group will have indi
vidual pictures and candid shots or
just candid group pictures, he went
on. The Village will not have any
individual pictures, just candid shots
of members of individual houses,
"I feel that this will far better rep
resent the Village than pages and
pages of individuals which were used
last year," McPherson stated.
All individual pictures were taken
by the Du Charma studio of San
Francisco.
"Quad sales are proceeding well
ahead of schedule—better than last
year," said Jim Marquis, office man
ager. "The yearbooks cost $5.75 with
out name and $6.25 with name, and
may be bought at the Quad office.
