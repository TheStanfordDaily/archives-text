"Seniors are wanted to help on
, the class-sponsorcd Ferryboat Scr
| enade scheduled for Feb. 6." Beth
j Van Hoesen, chairman, exclaimed
1 yesterday, "Let's see some new
faces."
I Prospective committee members
are requested to meet in the base
! ment of the Women's Clubhouse at
5 today. "We can use all the help
we can get," Miss Van Hoesen con
tinued.
Bids for the three-hour moonlight
cruise around SAn Francisco—with
dancing and a "refreshment parlor"
aboard — will be sold to seniors
through their living-group reprc
| sentatives this week. "Since we're
limiting the affair to 150 couples,"
j confided Joe Pickering, ticket com
j mittee chairman, "we expect noth-
J ing but scalping. Contact your
! senior representative now; a wait
ing list will be kept."
The remaining bids will be sold
I to the campus at large next week.
| "By offering only 150 tickets for
I sale," Miss Van Hoesen concludcd,
' "we can insure room for dancing
! inside if the weather is bad."
