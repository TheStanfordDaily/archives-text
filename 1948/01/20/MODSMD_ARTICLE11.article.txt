# Food Strike Threatened In U.S. Zone

### 
BERLIN, GERMANY, Jan. 19 (UP)
—Strikes in protest against food con
ditions spread to the American oc
cupation zone today and workers in
the Ruhr threatened a general strike
Friday unless the situation improves.
As in last week's big strikes in
the British-occupied Ruhr, there was
no indication whether the strikes
were entirely due to the food short
age or were Communist-inspired as
part of the "protocol" plot to wreck
the Marshall Plan.
2,000 STRIKE
More than 2,000 workers in Wics
baden-Biebrich walked out, protest
ing against the halving of the local
fat ration, in the first such strike in
the United States zone. Others—their
numbers not immediately estimated
—engaged in a sit-down strike.
In Kassel, at the northern extrem
ity of the American zone, Paul Pfetz
ing, chairman of city labor unions,
said the situation of his 65,000 men
was "critical."
"It wiil take only a slight push to
bring the same reaction as in the
Ruhr," he said.
CHAIN REACTION
In Munich, also in the American
zone and the third largest city in
Germany, Lorenz Hagen, president
of Bavarian unions, predicted wide
spread strikes tomorrow because the
Bavarian government today rejected
a labor ultimatum to tighten up ra
tioning and close down luxury cafes.
The chief strikes hi Wiesbaden-
Biebrich were in a chemical plant
and a transparent paper factory. City
Gas Works employes struck in sym
pathy but remained in their plants.
Other factories sent food protests to
union leaders and union men in the
two struck factories deckled to send
delegates to the German Economics
Council in Frankfurt tomorrow.
