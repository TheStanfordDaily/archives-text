### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UPj—Two members
of President Truman's cabinet criticized the Re
publican income tax cut plan today and got
strong support from Financier Bernard M. Bar
uch.
The GOP replied by calling a meeting of its

House steering committee tomorrow
to decide what kind of a tax pro
gram the party will sponsor this elec
i lion year. Leaders served advance
! notice that the legislation would not.
; include Mr. Truman's proposal for
j $40 "cost of living" tax credits for
j everybody.
GOP TO MEET
j This move coincided with a GOP
| announcement, that the joint Senate
! House budget committee will meet
; Thursday to start work on slashing
j the President's $39,700,000,000 Fed
era! budget for the next fiscal year.
The Republicans claim that drastic
cuts in government spending are es
sential to taxpayer benefits.
Secretary of Commerce W. Aver
ell Ilarriman attacked the GOP pro
; gram in testimony before the House
Ways and Means committee, which
\ is preparing to approve a bill by
Chairman Harold Knutson, R., Minn,
for a $5,600,000,000 general tax re
, duction this year. He said business
| is not in need of a tax cut now and
1 should not got one.
'MUST WAIT'
Secretary of the Treasury John
I W. Snyder, who testified last Friday,
. renewed his opposition today in his
j annual report to Congress on "the
| state of the finances." He argued that
| general tax reduction "must wait
; until inflationary pressures have
! subsided."
Barueh's stand against tax cuts for
j two years, came during testimony
J before the Senate Foreign Relations
j committee which is debating the
Marshall Plan for European recov
ery.
1 COOL RECEPTION
| He also urged that at least 50 per
; cent of the wartime corporation ex-
I cess profits tax be restored. The ad-
J ministration has proposed to offset
fhr $15,200,000,000 annuel cost of its
| tax credit plan by imposing a 75 pei -
cent excess profits tax on wealthy
J corporations.
Baruch got a cool reception from
some state tax experts.
Sen. Walter F. George, D., Ga.,
I former finance committee chairman,
J tojd newsmen that he feared that
I restoration of a general excess pro
' fits tax would lead to "a most ser
j ious setback" to industrial produc
-1 tion.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UP)—Bernard M.
Baruch today gave Congress his prescription
for world recovery: An airtight American mili
tary alliance with all nations willing to fight
aggression, and a two-year domestic program
of hard work, high taxes, food price rollbacks

and high production to beat infla
tion.
The 77-year-old park bench phi
losopher offered that remedy for the
world's post-war ills to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee which
called on him as the first non-gov
ernment witness in its hearings on
the Marshall Plan for European rc -
construction.
DRASTIC MEASURES
John Foster Dulles, Republican
foreign policy expert, will testily
tomorrow.
Baruch read a 40-minute prepare"!
statement in which he endorsed the
aid program but suggested that it
would have to be reinforced by dras -
tic military and economic measures
to make it work.
His formula was a Spartan one,
and few of his senatorial audience
gave it much chance of adoption in
an election year. But the committer
men commended him warmly on it;;
scope and its objectives.
TWO-YEAR PLAN
If his program was adopted, ho
said, within two years it could "ma
gically" lift the fear of another war
from all peoples.
His number one proposal was that
the United States and the IS Wesl -
ern European nations ticketed for aid
under the Marshall Plan—plus any
other countries of like mind—draft
a military alliance pledging them
selves to mutual aid against an ag
gressor.
"I mean a firm promise to go to
war in joint defense if any of them
are attacked," he said.
U.S. TO LEAD
The Europeans themselves, he
added, should band together in a
political, economic and defense un
ion under the United Nations, lower
trade barriers and be willing to bear
down arms in common defense.
On the domestic side, he said the
United States should take the lead in
a "production for peace" drive t<>
overcome existing food and material
shortages and roll back prices.
He termed production the biggest
contribution this country can make
to world recovery.
