# YWCA Gypsy Camp Invades Farm Friday
## 
### JACKIE MILNOR 
The Farm will turn to the gypsy
life this Friday night when the
YWCA presents its famous "Gypsy
! Carnival" in (he Women's Club
house.
True to the gypsy tradition, the
atmosphere will be informal. You
can wander all over the Clubhouse,
j sampling any or all of the enter
tainment offered.
Fortune-tellers will solve all your
j troubles with tales of the fame, for
tune, and man or woman of your
dreams soon to come your way.
i You can dance in the big audi
torium. During intermissions, ex-
otic dancers, boogie-woogie pianists,
and beautiful singers will entertain
you.
You can watch the main floor
show, which Claire Sprague, head
of the entertainment committee, de
scribes as "pretty special."
During the floor show, you will
j have a chance at a door prize con
tributed by Roos Brothers.
You can challenge your favorite
prof to a bridge, bingo, or ping pong
game. If you enjoy intellectual
games, you can play chess, check
ers, rummy, pinochle, or "name
your own."
Caricaturists will be on hand all
evening to draw your picture.
And the "Y" promises prizes for
every game.
You can have as much food as
you can eat â€” enough food to make
you "sick as a gypsy."
Everything but the food is free!
And the "Y" is charging only what
it costs them for the food.
It promises to be a gay night. It's
this Friday in the Women's Club
house, sponsored by the Stanford
YWCA.
