# STAMFORD INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
## NSA Divided into Two Parts; Relations Croup Begins Work 
### 
Closer contact with various uni- }
versities and colleges in the region j
through the exchange of pertinent j
information will be the aim of the j
NSA Public Relations Committee, |
whose chairman will be selected this |
week.
By reviewing such newspapers as '
the Daily Trojan, the Daily Califor
nian, and the Daily Bruin for news j
of interest to Stanford students en j
masse or in groups, the committee
will select stories of special appeal ;
or of similar problems to be re- ;
printed in The Daily.
STANFORD ACTIVITIES
Notes on Stanford activities will
be disseminated to California-Neva- i
da-Hawaii through the monthly re- i
gional bulletin, written under the di
rection of the new committee.
The committee will handle all :
publicity in The Daily for NSA
sponsored activities, including com- I
mittee work issuing from Excom
functions.
Articles concerning the history,
aims and purposes of NSA, of inter- j
est to the general community, will
be released through the Palo Alto
Times.
These releases will include not
only actual NSA activities, but any
events or functions on campus that !
have news value and would not oth
erwise receive publicity.
NEW POLICY
Inaugurating a new policy, the !
committee will attempt to work out
a plan of coordination with Fred
Glover, director of information for
Stanford University, in gathering ■
facts about student activities for San !
Francisco and Los Angeles newspa
pers.

] Following the pattern set by the
i USNSA, the campus NSA organiz
' ation will be divided into a Domes-
I tic and an International Commission.
By virtue of its constitutional au
j thority over all international activi
ties at Stanford, the Institute of In
ternational Relations (11R) will be
j vested with the International Com
mission.
With coordinating action by the
NSA chairman, all NSA functions
which the lIR assumes will be car
ried on by the lIR executive com
| mittee. The NSA chairman, who will
; have an ex-officio seat on the lIR
! Excom, will serve as liaison officer
with the regional and national or
| ganization.
The NSA Central Committee,
| which will be selected this week,
i will not be limited in its province to
i the function of Domestic Commis
i sion, but will carry out certain gen
| eral NSA activities which do not
| fall into either classification.
Since this group corresponds close
ly to that of the Domestic Commis
sion, however, the NSA chairman
will take over the duties of Domestic
j Commission head for the immediate
future.
