### NED SACK 
i Two English revivals entered the '
Varsity Theater lust Sunday after- j
j noon to form one of the most in
! triguing double bills in the area.
For those who thrive on Holly- ;
| wood's imaginary glamour and in- ;
! sist that every movie fall into the '
standard rut fashioned by Louis B. ,
j Mayer, these two pictures will ap- '
pear dull and amazingly uninter-
I esting. These movies, however, are '
j both fashioned with excellent taste !
j and provide a literary interest that j
continually marks English films.
The names of the two offerings
are "The Private Life of Henry
VIII" and"The Ghost Goes West.'
Both are produced by London Films
from pre-J. Arthur Rank days.
"The Human Side of History"
could be an excellent suhtitle for
"Henry VIII." We are taken with
as much authenticity as is possible
into the court intrigues that con
! fused, the infamous Hank's life.
SIXTEENTH-CENTURY LIFE
A wonderful picture of sixteenth -
| century life in England is presented.
, j It is before the days of Shakespeare,
and we can see the rough medieval
life taking on some of its Eliza
bethan niceties. This picture could
be a classic for its historical value
alone.
The literary importance of the
1 fdm, however, is the excellent char
, acterization of the King by Charles
! Laughton. He becomes a ruling
monarch who seeks happiness and
love and is thwarted by women who

prefer the crown to its wearer.
Charles Launhton's walk is a mas-
I terpiece of characterization. It is
;m uncouth, heavy stride that is
] firm and decisive, representative of
Henry's character.
HENRY'S MARRIAGES
As a man, Henry is shown in his
j attitude toward his later marriages.
! The movie opens with his third
i marriage. Henry's philosophy at
J this time is "If you want to be
happy, marry a stupid woman."
Henry passes through a succes
sion of marriages, some for the state
and some in his search for happi
ness. He finally winds up with
number six. the only ugly one and
a shrew at heart. Henry's "Private
Life" ends with him saying, "Six
wives, and the best of them is the
worst."
WEAK PLOT
Considering plot, "Henry VIII" is
weak. The only unifying thread
over the great period of time cov
ered by the picture is the succession
of wives.
Dramatically the movie has some
excellent parts. A fine touch, which
could only be done by the moving
pictures, is the opening contrast of
Anne Boleyn's execution and Jane
Seymour's marriage on the
day. The camera flashes between
the women, one about to die for
being queen, the other about to be
queen.
The second picture on the double
I bill. "The Ghost Goes West," is a
i light farce about a Scottish ghost.

ness. He finally winds up with
number six. the only ugly one and
a shrew at heart. Henry's "Private
Life" ends with him saying, "Six
wives, and the best of them is the
worst."
WEAK PLOT
Considering plot, "Henry VIII" is
weak. The only unifying thread
over the great period of time cov
ered by the picture is the succession
of wives.
Dramatically the movie has some
excellent parts. A fine touch, which
could only be done by the moving
pictures, is the opening contrast of
Anne Boleyn's execution and Jane
Seymour's marriage on the
day. The camera flashes between
the women, one about to die for
being queen, the other about to be
queen.
The second picture on the double
I bill. "The Ghost Goes West," is a
i light farce about a Scottish ghost.
i Two English revivals entered the '
Varsity Theater lust Sunday after- j
j noon to form one of the most in
! triguing double bills in the area.
For those who thrive on Holly- ;
| wood's imaginary glamour and in- ;
! sist that every movie fall into the '
standard rut fashioned by Louis B. ,
j Mayer, these two pictures will ap- '
pear dull and amazingly uninter-
I esting. These movies, however, are '
j both fashioned with excellent taste !
j and provide a literary interest that j
continually marks English films.
The names of the two offerings
are "The Private Life of Henry
VIII" and"The Ghost Goes West.'
Both are produced by London Films
from pre-J. Arthur Rank days.
"The Human Side of History"
could be an excellent suhtitle for
"Henry VIII." We are taken with
as much authenticity as is possible
into the court intrigues that con
! fused, the infamous Hank's life.
SIXTEENTH-CENTURY LIFE
A wonderful picture of sixteenth -
| century life in England is presented.
, j It is before the days of Shakespeare,
and we can see the rough medieval
life taking on some of its Eliza
bethan niceties. This picture could
be a classic for its historical value
alone.
The literary importance of the
1 fdm, however, is the excellent char
, acterization of the King by Charles
! Laughton. He becomes a ruling
monarch who seeks happiness and
love and is thwarted by women who

prefer the crown to its wearer.
Charles Launhton's walk is a mas-
I terpiece of characterization. It is
;m uncouth, heavy stride that is
] firm and decisive, representative of
Henry's character.
HENRY'S MARRIAGES
As a man, Henry is shown in his
j attitude toward his later marriages.
! The movie opens with his third
i marriage. Henry's philosophy at
J this time is "If you want to be
happy, marry a stupid woman."
Henry passes through a succes
sion of marriages, some for the state
and some in his search for happi
ness. He finally winds up with
number six. the only ugly one and
a shrew at heart. Henry's "Private
Life" ends with him saying, "Six
wives, and the best of them is the
