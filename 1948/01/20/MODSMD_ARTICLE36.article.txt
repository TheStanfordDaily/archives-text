# Lube-ing the Sports Axle With Art Lubic
## 
### 
Here's your chance to do some
thing worth while and get out and
enjoy yourself at the same time.
Tomorrow night there's going to be
a showing of Dick Durrance's tech
nicolor movie of the Olympic ski
tryouts, "Olympic Preview."' The
Stanford Ski Club has taken over
the Paly High auditorium for the
showing, and it should be a "must"
on every sport fan's list.
The movie is ten ific. It's the best
ski picture this reporter has seen to
date. And it serves a worthy cause.
All proceeds from the showing go
into the Olympic Ski Fund, helping
to support the U.S. Olympic skiers
now in Switzerland and at present
in rather shaky financial condition.
Support for the ski fund from this
area has been good. A large group
from Stanford turned up for the
big fund-raising rally in San Fran
cisco last fall, and well we should
with two ex-Indians on the Olym
pic squad—Bob and Boots Blatt.
But back to the picture. You
aren't making a donation when you
shell out six-bits to :ee this one -
it's well worth that, and more.
ACTION WORK TERRIFIC
Dick Durrance, a former Dart
mouth College and Olympic skier,
put his camera through the paces
to get most of the action at last
year's Olympic tryouts at Sun Val
ley. He got the team candidates
as they hurtled down the Warm
Springs run and also in the slaloms.
The most novel touch Dick em
ploys is taking the spectator with
him on a practice run. lie strapped
the motion picture camera to his
chest, then whizzed off down the
slopes attaining a speed of 60 m.p.h.
en route. It's sensational photogra
phy and something you won't soon
forget.
Don't forget the dale, time, and
place: tomorrow, 7:30 p.m., Palo
Alto High School auditorium.
STEVE'S STOCK BOOMS
The two games with California
over the weekend were significant
in a couple of respects. They
boomed Steve Stephenson's stock as
the top pivotman in the Southern
Division and marked the come-up
panee of the heretofore unheralded
Bob Lewis, Gus Chavalas, George
Yardley, and Jack Scharfen.
Th.it William Warner "Steve"
Stephenson is the best center in the
conference is the opinion held by
many after last weekend. The Long
Beach flash stood olit defensively
last season, and when his hook shots
from both sides started dropping in
early this year he served warning
to conference foes.
High-scoring honors of 17 points
in both Bear games is just a starter
for Steohenson — he'll be getting
even better as the season pro
gresses.
liOB THROTTLES HANGER
The toughest assignment of the
weekend went to Bob Lewis. The
elongated cage and net star from
Utah drew the task of guarding
Chuck Hanger. Slringbean Bob did
a sensational job of it, tying up
Hanger under the bucket and forc
ing the conference scoring leader to
shoot from far out for his points.
How Coach Everett Dean will jug
gle his starting lineup with Dave
Davidson back in action poses a
problem. Dean will have a tough
time relegating anyone to the bench
now, but might find the solution by
moving Captain Babe Higgins to a
forward slot, as he did when David
son entered the game at Berkeley
Saturday night.
The fine supporting performances
turned in by Chavalas, Yardley, and
Scharfen were most encouraging.
Gus saw the most action of the
three and impressed with his smooth
ball-handling. Big George used his
height to advantage on both nights
and Jack showed up well on de
fense.
The Indian quintet is too good an
outfit to remain at the bottom of the
conference standings for long. The
elevator is headed up—just how far
and fast might be indicated at the
Cow Palace when the Deanmen col
lide with St. Mary's and Santa Clara
this weekend.
