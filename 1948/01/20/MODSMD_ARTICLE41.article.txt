## Frosh Pagers Stress Attack 
### 
Although the freshman live has no
games on the hook for this week.
Coach Jack Dana will give his boys
no repose from the grind over the
iay-off period. Most of the time will
be spent on sharpening up on the
offense, and special emphasis will
! be put on activity at the free throw
! line. Dana hopes to up the present
percentage of charity tosses from
j about fifty percent made to sixty five
or seventy percent.
On the whole Dana was fairly well
satisfied with the yearling.-;' perform
j ance up at Berkeley over the weck
j end, but as Dana put it: "Our de
{ fense was better than our offense."
| The Froih mentor was particularly
! pleased with the play of Paul and
; Fran Watson at the forward posi
i tions and with Harold Campen, who
| so ably substituted for starting cen
i ter Dill Herron when the latter foul
i ed out in both contests.
As to Marv Gelber's game-winning
! half-court shot of the Friday night
I affair Dana stated, "That was a fine
I shot, but we don't want to depend
; on those all the time."
j The casualty list includes only
Gelber and Paul Watson. However,
Gelber's injured knee is healing, as
is Watson's wrenched shoulder,
which he sustained in the Friday
night tussle and which held down
the ace forward's scoring in the en
suing contest.
