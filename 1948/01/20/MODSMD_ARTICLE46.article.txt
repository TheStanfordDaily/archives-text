# New 'Purity Code' Has No Effect on Stanford
## 
### RAY EISELT 
According to A 1 Masters, Director of Stanford's Athletic De
partment, the effect of the much-discussed "purity code" recent
ly adopted in New York as part of the constitution of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, will be negligible as far as
Stanford is concerned.
Masters, who has just returned from the eastern metropolis,

♦■expressed ih" view that, up to date,
I the rules regarding the acquisition
i of athletes for intercollegiate com
petition in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence have beer more stringent than
the new NCAA code. This, he said,
has been particularly true of Stan
j ford where members of the athletic
| department are not even allowed to
i go off campus for prospective ma-
I terial.
DEFINES STATUS
The new code, to which all mem
bers of the NCAA will adhere, em
; bodies some noteworthy changes.
First, the code states that any col
lege athlete who takes or is prom
ised pay in any form for participa
tion in athletics doesn't meet the
: definition of an amateur.
It further states that athletes are
to be admitted to universities on the
same basis as any other students and
| they will be required to meet the
I same academic requirements.
I Another severe restriction is found
' in the provision applicable to non
adherence to the code. Those schools
j which do not conduct their athletic
programs in accordance with the
; code will be dropped from the sched
j ules of other NCCA members.
While the code authorizes grants
l in-aid to athletes attending college,
no school may offer any money for
| the services of players.
ENFORCEMENT DIFFICULT
The big problem will come with
j the enforcement of the code, said
Masters. It would seem that those
schools which have in the past re
sorted to proselyting to a large ex
! tent will find themselves on more
! even terms with those colleges which
j have generally maintained higher
; scholastic requirements.
