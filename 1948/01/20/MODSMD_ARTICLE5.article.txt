# French Devaluate Franc Over British Objections
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 19 (UP) — Reliable
sources reported tonight that the
French government has decided on a
general devaluation of the franc over
; the bitter objections of the British,
! who fear such action inevitably will
' lead to a reduction in the value of
the pound sterling.
The French plan calls for creation
of an export franc and possibly le
galization of free money—now cir
culating only on the black market,
i it was said.
NEAR PANIC
The reports caused near panic on
; the Paris Bourse, the Wall Street of
France, where gold and other mining
stocks toppled sharply.
The franc, it was disclosed, will be
pegged at 180 to the dollar, approxi
mately 60 more than at present, in
the general devaluation, while the
"export" franc for buying foreign
goods will be established at 240 to
the dollar, about double the current
domestic rate.
Well-informed quarters said the

| plan also calls for "free" dealings in
hard currency—in other words, the
present black market exchange of
dollars, Swiss 1 francs and other solid
| moneys would be legalized. The black
j market rate last week hovered
| around 350 francs per dollar.
SC HEME LATER
The general outlines of the scheme,
| expected to be announced cither
Wednesday or Friday, were confirm -
j ed in both French government and
foreign' diplomatic quarters.
The government was believed to be
awaiting final approval by the inter
national monetary fund before mak
ing the announcement. Pierre Men
des, the French government's finan
! cial expert, still was conferring with
; fund officials in Washington on the
j project.
Financial circles believed the Brit
j ish were opposed to any outright de
valuation of the franc for fear such
| action would have a depressing effect
on the pound sterling in the world
| market.. The pound now is valued at
i approximately $4.
