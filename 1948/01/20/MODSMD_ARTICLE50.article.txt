# Are You Confused?

The word international has been bandied
about campus a lot in the last year. Perhaps
too much so.
Today when most people read a headline
about an "international" group they immedi
ately skip on to more interesting topics, such
as the dances planned for the current weekend.
And now there is NSA —the National Stud
nets Association —organized to reflect the ac
tivities of all these groups.
Two people walking along Quad the other
day were heard to remark:
"But what is NSA? They keep talking about
conferences and such but they never come
right out and say what it is."
Confusion about NSA may exist in the minds
of many—perhaps because those directing this
organization do not knw just what it can ac

complish themselves. NSA is definitely a pion
eer group. They are just beginning to work.
They have broad objectives, but just what they
can do for Stanford remains to be seen.
As a committee of Excom the NSA Central
Committee, NSA's "little Excom," will assist
our governing group, as well as being a liaison
between Stanford and other schools concerning
common problems.
Tryouts for the Central Committee are being
held today. No experience is required. If you
are one of the people who has never fathomed
just what it's all about why not volunteer your
services?
This may sound illogical but the surest way
to know something is to work with it. There
is a fertile field here for people with ideas.
