It is only natural for people everywhere to think
of their country as better than others, to think of
themselves as noble and good, of others as not so good.
Europeans are past masters at this art of looking for
the mote in their neighbour's eye and not seeing the
beam in their own.
The Germans, for example, have an excuse, an
alibi for everything. The stormtroopers of a few years
ago work hard to convince themselves and you that
1 hey were never really Nazis; the villagers of Dachau
deny ever knowing of the concentration camp near
(heir town despite the freight car loads of killed
prisoners that were standing only a few blocks from
the town square.
The Russians and their Communist followers are
experts at rationalizing every new twist of Soviet
policy. Not so long ago, for instance, they denounced
incentive wage plans as a fiendish capitalist technique
of exploitation. Lo, one day they adopted such schemes
themselves and announced that in their hands they
were an important tool in building the road to progress.
This kind of thinking may be natural but it is
dangerous. While we wail plaintively that political
and social thinking hasn't caught up with science,
ths attitude makes any catching up impossible. A
scientist does not refuse to face facts nor does he use
casuistry to argue them away.
We in America are as guilty of this crime as every
one else. And it is a crime, for it produces ignorance,
hate, war.
We are guilty every time we throw text books
out of schools because they dare to hint that all
things American are not perfect.
We are guilty whenever we talk blandly about free
enterprise, ignoring the fact that more than half of
our industry is cartellized.
We are guilty when we holler about price controls
as un-American, but say nothing about the controls
that help special groups, such as tariffs to keep wool
prices high and farm support programs.
We are guilty when we boast of our democracy
and deny millions of Negroes the right to vote, to
schooling, to get ahead—the right to the white
man's opportunities.
And we are guilty many, many times in our for
eign policy:

We pay lip service to UN while informing it that
if we don't get certain Pacific islands as trustees we
will keep them anyway.
We say we are against Franco but block all UN
action against him.
When Russia overstayed her leave in Iran for a
few days we raised the dickens in the Security Coun
cil. But we were supposed to get out of Iceland over
a year ago and are still there.
We attack Vishinsky's abuse of the veto, but oppose
any suggestion to limit its use.
We denounce undemocratic elections in Poland but
support a government in Greece that was elected every
bit as undemocratically.
We believe in free elections, but when, in a free
election, the Communists became the strongest party
in France we forbade the French to have any Com
munists in their cabinet, at the risk of losing our aid.
We say the Russians are against the Marshall plan
because they want to keep Europe poor as a fertile
field for Red ideas. But we ignore our own State De
partment's announcement that in the last few months
the Soviets have signed sixty trade agreements with
other European countries, including England and
France.
We have our Secretary of State come back from the
London Conference and claim with righteous indigna
tion that it failed because Molotov wouldn't co
operate. But we blandly ignore dispatches like King
bury Smith's, European head of INS (a press asso
ciation as un-Communist as can be), who cabled five
days before the conference broke up that we had no
intention whatever of reaching any agreement on the
unification of Germany and were only looking for a
good excuse to break up the meeting.
The list can be made much longer. We have per
fected the use of the double standard. We can ignore
facts as wll as anyone else. Those we can't ignore
we explain away. This was always dangerous. It is
fatal now. If we continue to look at the world in
accord with our own preconceived notions, there will
be not much left to look at. If our generation doesn't
learn to act as responsible human beings, there will
be no more generations who can be taught.

We have our Secretary of State come back from the
London Conference and claim with righteous indigna
tion that it failed because Molotov wouldn't co
operate. But we blandly ignore dispatches like King
bury Smith's, European head of INS (a press asso
ciation as un-Communist as can be), who cabled five
days before the conference broke up that we had no
intention whatever of reaching any agreement on the
unification of Germany and were only looking for a
good excuse to break up the meeting.
The list can be made much longer. We have per
fected the use of the double standard. We can ignore
facts as wll as anyone else. Those we can't ignore
we explain away. This was always dangerous. It is
fatal now. If we continue to look at the world in
accord with our own preconceived notions, there will
be not much left to look at. If our generation doesn't
learn to act as responsible human beings, there will
be no more generations who can be taught.
It is only natural for people everywhere to think
of their country as better than others, to think of
themselves as noble and good, of others as not so good.
Europeans are past masters at this art of looking for
the mote in their neighbour's eye and not seeing the
beam in their own.
The Germans, for example, have an excuse, an
alibi for everything. The stormtroopers of a few years
ago work hard to convince themselves and you that
1 hey were never really Nazis; the villagers of Dachau
deny ever knowing of the concentration camp near
(heir town despite the freight car loads of killed
prisoners that were standing only a few blocks from
the town square.
The Russians and their Communist followers are
experts at rationalizing every new twist of Soviet
policy. Not so long ago, for instance, they denounced
incentive wage plans as a fiendish capitalist technique
of exploitation. Lo, one day they adopted such schemes
themselves and announced that in their hands they
were an important tool in building the road to progress.
This kind of thinking may be natural but it is
dangerous. While we wail plaintively that political
and social thinking hasn't caught up with science,
ths attitude makes any catching up impossible. A
scientist does not refuse to face facts nor does he use
casuistry to argue them away.
We in America are as guilty of this crime as every
one else. And it is a crime, for it produces ignorance,
hate, war.
We are guilty every time we throw text books
out of schools because they dare to hint that all
things American are not perfect.
We are guilty whenever we talk blandly about free
enterprise, ignoring the fact that more than half of
our industry is cartellized.
We are guilty when we holler about price controls
as un-American, but say nothing about the controls
that help special groups, such as tariffs to keep wool
prices high and farm support programs.
We are guilty when we boast of our democracy
and deny millions of Negroes the right to vote, to
schooling, to get ahead—the right to the white
man's opportunities.
And we are guilty many, many times in our for
eign policy:

We pay lip service to UN while informing it that
if we don't get certain Pacific islands as trustees we
will keep them anyway.
We say we are against Franco but block all UN
action against him.
When Russia overstayed her leave in Iran for a
few days we raised the dickens in the Security Coun
cil. But we were supposed to get out of Iceland over
a year ago and are still there.
We attack Vishinsky's abuse of the veto, but oppose
any suggestion to limit its use.
We denounce undemocratic elections in Poland but
support a government in Greece that was elected every
bit as undemocratically.
We believe in free elections, but when, in a free
election, the Communists became the strongest party
in France we forbade the French to have any Com
munists in their cabinet, at the risk of losing our aid.
We say the Russians are against the Marshall plan
because they want to keep Europe poor as a fertile
field for Red ideas. But we ignore our own State De
partment's announcement that in the last few months
the Soviets have signed sixty trade agreements with
other European countries, including England and
France.
