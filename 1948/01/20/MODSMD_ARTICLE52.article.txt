## Partisan Political Action Groups 
### 
fi liat Arc They?

To the Editor:
As a kindness to oldtime alums, interested in pres
ent Stanford, will your paper, or its correspondents,
instruct us as to just what a "partisan political action
group - ' is?
We knew in our day what a political party was,
in a Republic. Those of us who wanted to, in our day
(especially those over 21), took an active inquiring
interest in the one that suited us. We found out plenty
about it in election years through papers and cam
paign literature. We held it was our duty as citizens
of a Republic to study principles (in the light of our
own non-partisan faith) and the men who would carry
out those principles, and were "partisan" according
to our approval thereof. Hut we didn ' have to be a
group to do it, since even a civic conscience is an
individual thing. We took "action" in arguing happily
with as many of the other "side" as we came across,
and the final "action" of voting. In our day we rather
distrusted any group with three adjectives in front
of it.
So what is a "partisan political action group" in
today's student thinking? "Partisan" certainly can't
be blind, can it. or directed from outside? Political
is OK and must be had in a republic for orderly or
ganization and for later responsibility in performance.
"Action" is what? Persuasion? Parades? Boycott?
Recruitment? Show of sheer numbers? Lobbying?
Moider -or what?
Our thanks for any enlightenment,
DARE STARK McMULLIN.

(l!ditor\ Note. In response to Mrs. IWcMullin's request
for information Kxcnm member Ted Norton has endea

vored lo answer her questions in the following letter).
To the Editor:
In reply to Mrs. McMullin's letter, let me offer the
following personal opinions:
A "partisan, political, action group" as I under
stand the policy of the Executive Committee, is an
organization committed in advance to a certain posi
tion or "stand" on current political issues or candi
dates. an organization the primary interest and purpose
of which is politics, and an organization engaging or
intending to engage in active, organized campaiging
for or against current measures or candidates.
I think that such a group may properly he distin
guished from one interested in study and discussion
of all sides of whatever questions are involved before
it or its members come to any conclusions, and the
aim of which is rather enlightenment than selling a
bill of goods by high-pressure methods.
To comment specifically on Mrs. McMullin s last
paragraph, as I understand the matter, "partisan in
Excom's context does mean "blind" and may well
include "directed from the outside. I will dissent
from her statement that political organization "must
be had"—l am not at all sure that political parties
make much of a worth-while contribution nationally,
and would say that they are even less desirable in an
academic community.
As to "action," all Mrs. McMullin's examples could
be "action" if they were part of an active, organized
campaign in the "practical politics" sense of the word.
1 take it for granted that Mrs. McMullin under
stands that Excom's policy applies only to the char
tering or recognition of student organizations. That
policy is not intended in any way to restrict the
of the individual student to be as partisan, political,
and active—or non-partisan, non-political, and in
active «is he iii' she pleases.
