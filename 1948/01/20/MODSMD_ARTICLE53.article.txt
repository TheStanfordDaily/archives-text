# Russians Powerful'-- Diplomat to Lecture
## 
### JOSEPH LIPPER 
"The basis for Soviet effectiveness
at the conference table is the fact
that the USSR is a powerful na
tion and not because her diplomats
are skillful. If anything, the Rus
sian diplomatic corps is clumsy."
This was the observation of Pro
fessor Edward Hallett Carr, British
diplomat who will speak on "The
Background of Soviet Foreign Pol
icy" tomorrow in Memorial Hall.
TO DO RESEARCH
Professor Carr, who arrived here
yesterday, intends to do some re
seach in the Hoover Library in
what he termed the "unique collec
tion" of early Soviet history. This
material will be used in his elev
enth book on diplomacy. His latest
published work is "The Soviet Im
pact on the Western World."
In addition to his printed works,
Professor Can's eminence in the
field of foreign affairs stems from
his long career as a practicing dip
lomat. In 1919 he served on the
British peace misssion to Versailles.
Later he rose to the position of
first secretary of the British For
eign Office.
Professor Can's other duties in
cluded terms as Assistant Adviser
on the League of Nations Affairs
and as a special delegate to the
UNESCO Conference on the Rights
of Man in Paris last June.
UN NOT ANSWER
"The United Nations is not the
answer to any problem," Carr com
mented yesterday."It is rather a
tool or an instrument to achieve
peace among people who want to
co-operate â€” and the members of
the UN today do not seem to want
io co-operate."
When asked whether a world
government would be the answer to
the problem of maintaining peace,
Professor Carr offered a hesitant
answer of yes. He qualified his an
swer by saying it would be some
unknown time yet before the na
tions of the world would surrender
their sovereignty to form such a
union.
HAVE POLITICAL LAG
"The world suffers from a politi
cal lag," he said. "Our technologi
cal and social progress calls for a
more advanced form of world po
litical organization than we now
have."
Then, injecting a grim reminder
of conditions today. Professor Carr
pointed out that the starving masses
of Europe cared little for all the
talk of human and civil rights.
"They want food to fill their bel
lies. That is the only language they
understand."
During his four-day stay here.
Professor Carr will also lecture to
the seminar on Slavic Studies on
Thursday.

"Background of Soviet Foreign
Policy" will be the subject of a
lecture by Professor E. H. Carr at
7:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Memorial
Auditorium.
Professor Carr, one-time first sec
retary of the British Foreign Office,
is now with the International Rela
tions Department at the University
College of Wales. lie is also a
UNESCO official.
The professor is delivering a se
ries of lectures to universities
throughout the country. The talk,
sponsored by the Hoover Institute
and Library, is expected to draw a
large crowd, including many resi
dents of Palo Alto, since the subject
is of such timely interest.
