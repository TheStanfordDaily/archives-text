JERUSALEM, Palestine, Jan. 19
(UP). —The Jewish Agency said to
day that 65 American Jews attend
ing school in Palestine under the
United States GI Bill of Rights had
enlisted in the Haganah "defense
army." The)' all came to Palestine
after the war and enrolled in the
Hebrew University.
Gershon Hirsch, spokesman for
the Jewish Agency, denied that Ha
ganah had put "pressure" on the
American students to enlist. He said
David ben Gurion, chairman of the
Jewish Agcncy Executive, had been
against their enlistment, "but they
enlisted on their own accord."
It was understood that U.S. Con
sul General Robert MacAtee was
writing a report for the State De
partment on the students. The point
that other American students might
be in Haganah was raised after the
killing on Friday of Mosheh A.
Pearlstein, 22, of Brooklyn, New
York. He was a student and one
of 35 Haagnah men killed by the
Arabs in ambush on a camel trail
south of Jerusalem.
(The Veterans Administration in
Washington said 37 veterans are
now studying in Palestine under the
GI Bill of Rights. It said that pre
viously 57 forme American serv
icemen had received training in
Palestine under the Bill of Rights—
31 at Haifa and 26 at Jerusalem.)
