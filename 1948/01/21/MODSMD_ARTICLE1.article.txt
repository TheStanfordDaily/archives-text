Nominations for the winter quarter election will open tomor
row at 9 a.m., Gordon Luce, election board chairman announced.
Two positions on the Stanford Athletic Council, four positions
on Men's Council, two positions on Women's Council, and senior
class secretary will be open.
"Three of these positions are short term, however," Luce added,

"That is, tnc> positions wilt be held
from election day through spring
quarter only, while the other posi
tions will be held for a full year."
The senior class secretary's office
was left vacant when Jean Strong
failed to return to Stanford this
quarter. Positions on Stanford Ath
letic Council and on Men's Council
are also vacant with the absence of
Pete August and Phil Chandler from
school.
NOMINATION LOCATION
"Nomination slips may be turned
in from 9 a.m. tomorrow until 5 p.m.
Tuesday,'" John Marin, ballot chair
man, pointed out. "These slips will
be located on Engineering Corner
on top of the nomination box."
Declinations will be accepted until
5 p.m., Jan. 28. Primary elections
will be held on Feb. 4 if more than
four persons run for SAC, senior
class secretary, or Men's Council
short term vacancy. The two posi
tions on Women's Council and the
three positions on Men's Council will
not be voted upon in the primary.
Final election will be Feb. 11.
"The purpose of the primary elec
tion," Luce explained, "is to limit
the number of choices on the prefer
ential final to four. But since there
are two positions on Women's Coun
cil and three positions on Men's
Council, direct voting, and not pref
erential is used.
FINAL BALLOT ONLY
That is, each voter votes for two
women and three men and does not
indicate his first, second and third
choice. For this reason these offices
will appear on the final ballot only."
All candidates need a "C" aver
age. There are no unit requirements
for SAC. Candidates for senior class
secretary will need 1.33 units as of
autumn quarter, 1947. Those running
for Men's Council and Women's
Council will need 105 units as of the
same date.
