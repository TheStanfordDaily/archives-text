# Need For All-Campus Dances Told
## 
### 
"The social chairmen decided al
most unanimously that the best way
of overcoming the lack of all-cam
pus social functions this quarter
would be for more houses to spon
sor all-campus dances," announced
Guyla Runyan, ASSU vice - presi
dent.
Since there are only three all
campus functions scheduled thus far
for the winter quarter, a meeting of
the social chairmen from each liv
ing group was held yesterday af
ternoon to discuss ways and means
of providing more social activities
for Stanford students.
CHIEF DRAWBACK
One of the chief drawbacks to
all-campus dances is the lack of
space since the Women's Gymna
sium can be used only Saturday
evenings and the Basketball Pavil
ion is not available at all this quar
ter. One suggested means of over
coming this lack of adequate space
would be for several living groups
to sponsor dances on the same eve
ning, thus splitting the attendance.
It was also pointed out that by
each living group sponsoring one
open dance a year there would he
plenty of social activities on campus.'
The objection that these dances
would be too great a financial bur
den on the houses was countered
by the fact that the individual cost
per member would be less than
what would be spent in an equiva
lent length of time on a date in San
.Francisco.
FINAL PLAN
The final plan approved by the
chairmen consists of the submitting
to the ASSU Social Committee
member from their area a tentative
date for a dance.
The committee member would
then make the date known and
other interested houses could con
tact each other to make plans for
dances to be given concurrently. In
this way the Social Committee
would act as a co-ordinating body.
First meeting of the Social Com
mittee was held this fall. Since that
time they have published each
Thursday afternoon a program of
the social, cultural, and sports
events for the coming weekend and
sent it to each living group.
BULLETIN BOARD
This quarter they will maintain a
large bulletin board in the ASSU
offices where the social activities
for the quarter may be seen at a
glance.
Plans are also being made to have
a bulletin board erected by the Cel
lar where the bicycle racks are now
located which would show the
week's events at a glance.
Any group desiring to give a
function in the next two weekends
should have its application in be
fore tonight. Other applications are
due the Wednesday a week and a
half before the scheduled date.

"The social chairmen decided al
most unanimously that the best way
of overcoming the lack of all-cam
pus social functions this quarter
would be for more houses to spon
sor all-campus dances," announced
Guyla Runyan, ASSU vice - presi
dent.
Since there are only three all
campus functions scheduled thus far
for the winter quarter, a meeting of
the social chairmen from each liv
ing group was held yesterday af
ternoon to discuss ways and means
of providing more social activities
for Stanford students.
CHIEF DRAWBACK
One of the chief drawbacks to
all-campus dances is the lack of
space since the Women's Gymna
sium can be used only Saturday
evenings and the Basketball Pavil
ion is not available at all this quar
ter. One suggested means of over
coming this lack of adequate space
would be for several living groups
to sponsor dances on the same eve
ning, thus splitting the attendance.
It was also pointed out that by
each living group sponsoring one
open dance a year there would he
plenty of social activities on campus.'
The objection that these dances
would be too great a financial bur
den on the houses was countered
by the fact that the individual cost
per member would be less than
what would be spent in an equiva
lent length of time on a date in San
.Francisco.
FINAL PLAN
The final plan approved by the
chairmen consists of the submitting
to the ASSU Social Committee
member from their area a tentative
date for a dance.
The committee member would
then make the date known and
other interested houses could con
tact each other to make plans for
dances to be given concurrently. In
this way the Social Committee
would act as a co-ordinating body.
First meeting of the Social Com
mittee was held this fall. Since that
time they have published each
Thursday afternoon a program of
the social, cultural, and sports
events for the coming weekend and
sent it to each living group.
BULLETIN BOARD
This quarter they will maintain a
large bulletin board in the ASSU
offices where the social activities
for the quarter may be seen at a
glance.
Plans are also being made to have
a bulletin board erected by the Cel
lar where the bicycle racks are now
located which would show the
week's events at a glance.
Any group desiring to give a
function in the next two weekends
should have its application in be
fore tonight. Other applications are
due the Wednesday a week and a
half before the scheduled date.
