OTTAWA, Jan. 20 (UP)—
Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie
King announced torfight that he
is resigning as head of the Lib
eral party but he indicated that
he will continue as Canada's elected
' chief executive if his party and the
voters agree.
The Prime Minister, in a speech
delivered before the Liberal party
advisory council, cited the "heavy
duties" of party leadership as
prompting his request that a young
er man be chosen to lead the Liber
als in the next general election.
King called on the party to call
a national convention next summer
for the purpose of choosing his suc
cessor as leader of the party.
He made no direct reference to his
post as Prime Minister—an office he
has held since 1935 and which he
also held almost continuously from
1921 to 1930.
His announcement of his desire to
resign was confined entirely to his
leadership of the Liberal party which
he headed since 1919.
The 73-year-olpl Prime Minister
who has been a member of Parlia
ment for nearly 40 years indicated
he believed he would render better
service as Prime Minister if hg were
relieved of the burden of work as
party leader.
