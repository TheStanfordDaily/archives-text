TULSA, Okla.. Jan. 20 (UP)—Ed
i win W. Pauley's disclosure and de
j fense of heavy commodity specula
| lion after becoming a government
j official is a "confession" that he
! failed to heed President Truman's
] warning against such profiteering,
: Harold E. Stassen said tonight.
The Republican presidential hope
ful said Pauley is now clearly argu
i ing with Mr. Truman "rather than
| with myself."
"I suggest he confer with the
j President regarding his gambling in
j food," he said.
Senate investigators earlier today
i released records in which Pauley ex-
J plained his profits in the commodity
|-market. In them the special assist
ant to the Secretary of the Army
i admitted that Stassen, his loudest
! critic, already has seen sections of
i the report.
Stassen suggested that speculation
| insiders be outlawed. This was one
j of four limited powers by which he
said the government could pull down
j high prices without disrupting pro
j duction.
The three other powers outlined
by Stassen were:
1. New power against excess in
; ventories as a weapon against hoard
! ing and profiteering.
2. The government, should have
power to anchor credit as the over
extension of consumer credit and
other forms of credit puts added up
ward pressure on prices.
3. The government should also
have power over exports and over
| purchasing by foreign governments.
