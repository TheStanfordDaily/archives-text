LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y., Jan. 20
(UP) —The United Nations Pales
tine commission was reported
today to have reached a general
understanding that an Interna
tional Army will have to be sent
to the Holy Land when British troopl
- out next summer and the UN
moves in to enforce partition.
That reoorted decision was reach
ed as the UN Security Council mov
ed to meet a threat to peace in an
other corner of the world—lndia.
The council set up a three-nation
commission to mediate the Indian-
Pakistan fight over the state of
Kashmir.
The Palestine commission met be
hind closed doors but it wa3 said to
have concentrated its discussion on
the manner in which troops should
be obtained. None of the commis
sion's five member nations challeng
ed the apparent feeling that armed
backing should be asked.
The commission decided to act to
morrow on a formal resolution that
would open the way for the Security
Council to try to mobilize troops to
send to the Holy Land.
Action on the Indian-Pakistan dis
pute came less than three hours af
ter the council was informed unoffi
cially that those two newly-consti
tuted nations would accept media
tion.
In the Indian-Pakistan dispute, the
Security Council used the formula
that ended the •Dutch-Indonesian
fighting which broke out last sum
mer. The council asked India and
Pakistan to appoint one member each
of the mediation board. These two
members will name a third.
