# Series Audience Applauds Artists
## 
### 
Continued applause at the con
elusion of the joint reciial of "L;<
Mariquita," executor of the Span
ish dance, and Marjory Chauvel,
concert harpist, in Memorial Audi
torium last night paid tribute to
the excellence of their performance,
which was witnessed by an audi
ence of over 3,500.
Particularly effective among the
dances of "La Mariquita" were the
"Ritual Dance of Fire," which em
phasized the sensuous movement.,
and the strong rhythms of the
Spanish dance, and a ritual dance
from Peru in which "La Mariquita"
wore the colorful native costume of
the Incas.
Mrs. Chauvel displayed unusual
grace and dexterity on the harp and
proved to many of her audience who
knew very little about the harp that
il is one of the most melodious and
full-bodied of all instruments. In
Salzedo's "Chanson dans la NuH"
she exhibited the versatility of the
instrument itself by producing a va
riety of effects with her fingernail;;
and on the sounding board. â€”Shaw
