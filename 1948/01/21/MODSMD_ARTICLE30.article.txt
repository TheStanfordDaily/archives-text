# Stanford Breaks Ground In 1863
## 
### TOM SELF 
The Central Pacific Company
had been incorporated June 28,
1861, with Leland Stanford as
president. Other officers were
Collis P. Huntington, vice-pres
ident; Mark Hopkins, treasurer;
James Bailey, secretary; and I-,.
A. Booth, Charles Crocker, D.
W. Strong, T. D. Judah, and
Charles Marsh, directors.
The new directors soon had their
hands lull of money troubles. Forty
miles of railroad had to be built and
equipped before the government aid
would become available. It was
:;oon obvious that sales of stock
would he inadequate to pay for it.
Perhaps Stanford and his associ
ates relied on the pledges of the
: (ate and counties made at the Rail
toad Convention of 1859. Perhaps
they intended to build the first
miles with their own money.
OPENING CEREMONIES
AI any rate they went ahead with
the project. On Jan. 8, 1863, Gover
nor Stanford shoveled the first dirt
for the embankment at Sacramento.
AI the opening ceremonies he said
that, the work would go on from the
(' difornia side to completion as rap
idly as possible.
As president of the Central Pacific
I;ilroad, Stanford's duties were
manifold. State legislative acts had
to be passed to enable counties to
extend aid at this critical period,
(hants of land for terminals had to
l)« obtained, credit established with
San Francisco bankers, and all bus
iness incidental to the administra
tion of the company's affairs trans
acted.
HONOR AND INTEGRITY
That the majority of people had
faith in the honor and integrity of
Stanford was evidenced by their
electing him Governor in the criti
cal Civil War period. His standing
and political influence was a great
a, set to the company.
Stanford served as Governor until
the end of 1863, during which time
he approved seven legislative acts
in (he interest of the railroad. If
this strikes you as unethical, you
must remember that the railroad
connecting Stanford with the East
was a vital need, and Stanford was
elected on a platform to accomplish
that need. His efforts were really
promoting the public welfare.
Money problems continued to

plague the builders. The state of
California in April, 1803, passed a
bill appropriating $500,000 as a sub
sidy for the road. The act proved
inoperative no money was re
ceived. In 1864 a new act provided
for the payment by the state of in
terest. on the company's bonds.
These bonds, with the state of Cali
fornia back of them, were immedi
ately saleable and saved the com
pany from financial disaster.
The interest amounted to the sum
of $105,000 a year—a far cry from
the $15 000,000 pledged by the Rail
road Convention of 1859.
Sacramento and Placer counties
and the city and county of San

Francisco pledged aid in 1863: Sac
ramento, $300,000; Placer, $250,000;
and San Francisco, $600,000. The
first two paid for stock promptly.
San Francisco did not subscribe.
Stanford pleaded with the people of
San Francisco, emphasizing the im
portance of the road to them. In
May, 1863, bonds were approved to
pay for $600,000 in CPRR stock. But
not until April, 1866—after much
litigation did the company receive
the bonds, and then only $400,000.
It is difficult, to believe that San
Francisco with its commercial pos
sibilities would deliberately retard
the work of the railroad. However,
merchants were able to corner mar

kets by sailing ships and they did
not want their monopoly broken by
the railroad.
Likewise toll - read companies,
teaming interests, stage and express
outfits wanted no competition with
their $13,000,000 annual business to
the Nevada mines. The Sacramento
Valley Railway Co. and the Pacific
Mail Steamship Co. also objected.
To facilitate Nevada traffic the
Dutch Flat and Donner Lake wagon
road was constructed in the fall of
1861, with virtually the same di
rectorate as the Central Pacific
Railroad. It was the enormous pos
sibilities of the Nevada traffic that
had first awakened the associates'
interest in the project. Progress in
the mountains was slow, and they
wanted to get in on the Nevada bus
iness as soon as possible.
SF SWINDLE
The announcing of the opening of
the road on June 14, 1864—during
the heat of the bond controversy in
San Francisco—caused a huge out
cry about "The Dutch Flat Swin
dle." It was claimed that the Cen
tral Pacific had no intention of
building a transcontinental railroad,
and the whole purpose was to ex
tend the line to Dutch Flat as a
feeder line to the wagon road.
The Alta California referred to
the CPRIt as Stanford's "moonshine
project."
Construction from Jan. 8, 1863,
proceeded without serious interrup
tion. On March 20, Stanford received
a wire from Huntington in New
York saying he had purchased 5,000
tons of iron, enough for the first 50
miles.

A. Booth, Charles Crocker, D.
W. Strong, T. D. Judah, and

The new directors soon had their
hands lull of money troubles. Forty
miles of railroad had to be built and
equipped before the government aid
would become available. It was
:;oon obvious that sales of stock
would he inadequate to pay for it.
Perhaps Stanford and his associ
ates relied on the pledges of the
: (ate and counties made at the Rail
toad Convention of 1859. Perhaps
they intended to build the first
miles with their own money.
OPENING CEREMONIES
AI any rate they went ahead with
the project. On Jan. 8, 1863, Gover
nor Stanford shoveled the first dirt
for the embankment at Sacramento.
AI the opening ceremonies he said
that, the work would go on from the
(' difornia side to completion as rap
idly as possible.
As president of the Central Pacific
I;ilroad, Stanford's duties were
manifold. State legislative acts had
to be passed to enable counties to
extend aid at this critical period,
(hants of land for terminals had to
l)« obtained, credit established with
San Francisco bankers, and all bus
iness incidental to the administra
tion of the company's affairs trans
acted.
HONOR AND INTEGRITY
That the majority of people had
faith in the honor and integrity of
Stanford was evidenced by their
electing him Governor in the criti
cal Civil War period. His standing
and political influence was a great
a, set to the company.
Stanford served as Governor until
the end of 1863, during which time
he approved seven legislative acts
in (he interest of the railroad. If
this strikes you as unethical, you
must remember that the railroad
connecting Stanford with the East
was a vital need, and Stanford was
elected on a platform to accomplish
that need. His efforts were really
promoting the public welfare.
Money problems continued to

plague the builders. The state of
California in April, 1803, passed a
bill appropriating $500,000 as a sub
sidy for the road. The act proved
inoperative no money was re
ceived. In 1864 a new act provided
for the payment by the state of in
terest. on the company's bonds.
These bonds, with the state of Cali
fornia back of them, were immedi
ately saleable and saved the com
pany from financial disaster.
The interest amounted to the sum
of $105,000 a year—a far cry from
the $15 000,000 pledged by the Rail
road Convention of 1859.
Sacramento and Placer counties
and the city and county of San

Francisco pledged aid in 1863: Sac
ramento, $300,000; Placer, $250,000;
and San Francisco, $600,000. The
first two paid for stock promptly.
San Francisco did not subscribe.
Stanford pleaded with the people of
San Francisco, emphasizing the im
portance of the road to them. In
May, 1863, bonds were approved to
pay for $600,000 in CPRR stock. But
not until April, 1866—after much
litigation did the company receive
the bonds, and then only $400,000.
It is difficult, to believe that San
Francisco with its commercial pos
sibilities would deliberately retard
the work of the railroad. However,
merchants were able to corner mar

kets by sailing ships and they did
not want their monopoly broken by
the railroad.
Likewise toll - read companies,
teaming interests, stage and express
outfits wanted no competition with
their $13,000,000 annual business to
the Nevada mines. The Sacramento
Valley Railway Co. and the Pacific
Mail Steamship Co. also objected.
To facilitate Nevada traffic the
Dutch Flat and Donner Lake wagon
road was constructed in the fall of
1861, with virtually the same di
rectorate as the Central Pacific
Railroad. It was the enormous pos
sibilities of the Nevada traffic that
had first awakened the associates'
interest in the project. Progress in
the mountains was slow, and they
wanted to get in on the Nevada bus
iness as soon as possible.
SF SWINDLE
The announcing of the opening of
the road on June 14, 1864—during
the heat of the bond controversy in
San Francisco—caused a huge out
cry about "The Dutch Flat Swin
dle." It was claimed that the Cen
tral Pacific had no intention of
building a transcontinental railroad,
and the whole purpose was to ex
tend the line to Dutch Flat as a
feeder line to the wagon road.
The Alta California referred to
the CPRIt as Stanford's "moonshine
project."
Construction from Jan. 8, 1863,
proceeded without serious interrup
tion. On March 20, Stanford received
a wire from Huntington in New
York saying he had purchased 5,000
tons of iron, enough for the first 50

Mail Steamship Co. also objected.
To facilitate Nevada traffic the
Dutch Flat and Donner Lake wagon
road was constructed in the fall of
1861, with virtually the same di
rectorate as the Central Pacific
Railroad. It was the enormous pos
sibilities of the Nevada traffic that
had first awakened the associates'
interest in the project. Progress in
the mountains was slow, and they
wanted to get in on the Nevada bus
iness as soon as possible.
SF SWINDLE
The announcing of the opening of
the road on June 14, 1864—during
the heat of the bond controversy in
San Francisco—caused a huge out
cry about "The Dutch Flat Swin
dle." It was claimed that the Cen
tral Pacific had no intention of
building a transcontinental railroad,
and the whole purpose was to ex
tend the line to Dutch Flat as a
feeder line to the wagon road.
The Alta California referred to
the CPRIt as Stanford's "moonshine
project."
Construction from Jan. 8, 1863,
proceeded without serious interrup
tion. On March 20, Stanford received
a wire from Huntington in New
York saying he had purchased 5,000
tons of iron, enough for the first 50
miles.

The Central Pacific Company

Collis P. Huntington, vice-pres
ident; Mark Hopkins, treasurer;
James Bailey, secretary; and I-,.
A. Booth, Charles Crocker, D.
W. Strong, T. D. Judah, and
Charles Marsh, directors.
The new directors soon had their
hands lull of money troubles. Forty
miles of railroad had to be built and
equipped before the government aid
would become available. It was
:;oon obvious that sales of stock
would he inadequate to pay for it.
Perhaps Stanford and his associ
ates relied on the pledges of the
: (ate and counties made at the Rail
toad Convention of 1859. Perhaps
they intended to build the first
miles with their own money.
OPENING CEREMONIES
AI any rate they went ahead with
the project. On Jan. 8, 1863, Gover
nor Stanford shoveled the first dirt
for the embankment at Sacramento.
AI the opening ceremonies he said
that, the work would go on from the
(' difornia side to completion as rap
idly as possible.
As president of the Central Pacific
I;ilroad, Stanford's duties were
manifold. State legislative acts had
to be passed to enable counties to
extend aid at this critical period,
(hants of land for terminals had to
l)« obtained, credit established with
San Francisco bankers, and all bus
iness incidental to the administra
tion of the company's affairs trans
acted.
HONOR AND INTEGRITY
That the majority of people had
faith in the honor and integrity of
Stanford was evidenced by their
electing him Governor in the criti
cal Civil War period. His standing
and political influence was a great
a, set to the company.
Stanford served as Governor until
the end of 1863, during which time
he approved seven legislative acts
in (he interest of the railroad. If
this strikes you as unethical, you
must remember that the railroad
connecting Stanford with the East
was a vital need, and Stanford was
elected on a platform to accomplish
that need. His efforts were really
promoting the public welfare.
Money problems continued to

plague the builders. The state of
California in April, 1803, passed a
bill appropriating $500,000 as a sub
sidy for the road. The act proved
inoperative no money was re
ceived. In 1864 a new act provided
for the payment by the state of in
terest. on the company's bonds.
These bonds, with the state of Cali
fornia back of them, were immedi
ately saleable and saved the com
pany from financial disaster.
The interest amounted to the sum
of $105,000 a year—a far cry from
the $15 000,000 pledged by the Rail
road Convention of 1859.
Sacramento and Placer counties
and the city and county of San

Francisco pledged aid in 1863: Sac
ramento, $300,000; Placer, $250,000;
and San Francisco, $600,000. The
first two paid for stock promptly.
San Francisco did not subscribe.
Stanford pleaded with the people of
San Francisco, emphasizing the im
portance of the road to them. In
May, 1863, bonds were approved to
pay for $600,000 in CPRR stock. But
not until April, 1866—after much
litigation did the company receive
the bonds, and then only $400,000.
It is difficult, to believe that San
Francisco with its commercial pos
sibilities would deliberately retard
the work of the railroad. However,
merchants were able to corner mar

kets by sailing ships and they did
not want their monopoly broken by
the railroad.
Likewise toll - read companies,
teaming interests, stage and express
outfits wanted no competition with
their $13,000,000 annual business to
the Nevada mines. The Sacramento
Valley Railway Co. and the Pacific
Mail Steamship Co. also objected.

road Convention of 1859.
Sacramento and Placer counties
and the city and county of San

Francisco pledged aid in 1863: Sac
ramento, $300,000; Placer, $250,000;
and San Francisco, $600,000. The
first two paid for stock promptly.
San Francisco did not subscribe.
Stanford pleaded with the people of
San Francisco, emphasizing the im
portance of the road to them. In
May, 1863, bonds were approved to
pay for $600,000 in CPRR stock. But
not until April, 1866—after much
litigation did the company receive
the bonds, and then only $400,000.
It is difficult, to believe that San
Francisco with its commercial pos
sibilities would deliberately retard
the work of the railroad. However,
merchants were able to corner mar

kets by sailing ships and they did
not want their monopoly broken by
the railroad.
Likewise toll - read companies,
teaming interests, stage and express
outfits wanted no competition with
their $13,000,000 annual business to
the Nevada mines. The Sacramento
Valley Railway Co. and the Pacific
Mail Steamship Co. also objected.
To facilitate Nevada traffic the
Dutch Flat and Donner Lake wagon
road was constructed in the fall of
1861, with virtually the same di
rectorate as the Central Pacific
Railroad. It was the enormous pos
sibilities of the Nevada traffic that
had first awakened the associates'
interest in the project. Progress in
the mountains was slow, and they
wanted to get in on the Nevada bus
iness as soon as possible.
SF SWINDLE
The announcing of the opening of
the road on June 14, 1864—during
the heat of the bond controversy in
San Francisco—caused a huge out
cry about "The Dutch Flat Swin
dle." It was claimed that the Cen
tral Pacific had no intention of
building a transcontinental railroad,
and the whole purpose was to ex
tend the line to Dutch Flat as a
feeder line to the wagon road.
The Alta California referred to
the CPRIt as Stanford's "moonshine
project."
Construction from Jan. 8, 1863,
proceeded without serious interrup
tion. On March 20, Stanford received
a wire from Huntington in New
York saying he had purchased 5,000
tons of iron, enough for the first 50
miles.
FIRST RAILS
The first rails were laid Oct. 26.
| The first locomotive was brought
j around Cape Horn on the "Herald
1 of the Morning," which arrived in
! San Francisco Aug. 19, 1863. In the
process of unloading at Sacramento
i the locomotive was nearly lost in
1 the river.
I In those days the locomotives
were given names instead of num
-1 bers. The first locomotive was
' called "The Governor Stanford." It
I is now in the museum at Stanford,
j as is the shovel used in the inaugu
ral ceremonies.
j The trial run on Nov. 9 was con
! sidered important enough to be
j celebrated by a salute of 35 guns.
! On March 25, 1864, the first freight
was hauled —30 tons of granite. On
1 April 25, 1864, the company began
| operating the first passenger trains
| to Roseville.
