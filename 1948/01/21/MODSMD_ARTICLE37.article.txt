# Faust Chorus Meets Today
## 
### 
All Faust Chorus members who
are not in the University Chorus
will meet this afternoon at 5:15 in
the choir room, announced Dr. Har
old C. Schmidt, associate professor
of music.
The University Chorus will con
tinue to meet at its regular time.
This new chorus was formed at
the end of last quarter to sing in
the Faust Symphony by Franz Liszt
with the San Francisco Symphony.
This musical work is considered one
of Liszt's best compositions, but is
rarely heard because it requires a
100-voice male chorus.
The Faust Symphony will be
heard Feb. 19, 20, and 21 in the San
Francisco Opera House. William
Steinberg of the Buffalo Symphony
Orchestra, will be guest conductor.
Dr. Schmidt stated that anyone
who signed up for the chorus and
has not attended a rehearsal should
be at this afternoon's meeting.
