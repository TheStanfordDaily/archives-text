# Dean's Woes Mount Up; Thompson, Rose Sidelined
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Basketball Coach Everett Dc-an is fast discovering the truth of
that old proverb something about raining and pouring, you
know.
Latest victims of the cage sguad's run of bad luck are forwards
Bill Rose and Morley Thompson. Rose turned up with a case of

flu Monday, and Thompson was sent
to bed yesterday with a bad sore
throat.
Also out for the day with a
cold was sub forward George Yard
ley,
They join Dave Davidson, Ba be
11it»^*iiis. and Boh Lewis on the sick,
injured, and recovering list. The lat
ter three are being brought along
slowly but are not completely re
covered yet.
Dean, however, is taking the whole
business stoically.
''It'll have to get better. It can't
get much worse." he philosophizes.
"Besides we're lucky to have it come
now when we have three weekends
without conference games."
TWO GAMPS SHIS WEEK
However, the basketballers will
not be entirely idle for the three
weeks. This week preparations are
going ahead for games Friday and
Saturday nights against St. Mary's
and Santa Clara at the Cow Palace,
Neither outfit is a pushover, and
Stanford will be all out to win,
league game or no.
Nevertheless, more because of cir
cumstances than by design, substi
tutes will get plenty of chance to
play in place of the sick and wound
ed.
St. Mary's, Friday night's oppon
ent, has a season's record of five
wins and live losses. But the Gaels
have lost to only one college team,
Loyola, which beat them twice.
Their other defeats were at the
hands of the Oakland Bittners, Sac
ramento Senators, and the Borlo A.C.
KIDIIKA LEADS (iAIIS
The Moi avans are led by Frankie
'"Apples" Kudelka, whom many City
sports writer considers the outstand
ing basketeer of the Bay Region.
Kudelka has scored 12-1 points in 10
games, including !!(! points in one
game against Fresno State.
The hotshot forward is supposed
to be a sensational ball player, tank
ing many from 30 and 40 feet out.
lie is followed in scoring by center
Jack Rial, who has 79 points.
broncos have won :i
The Santa Clara Broncos, whom
the Indians meet Saturday night,
have a somewhat better record than
the Gaels, nine wins as against six
defeats.
Frank Lancy. tall, aggressive cen
ter, leads the S nta Clarans with I!)(i
points in 14 games. Second in scor

ing is forward Bob McKillop with
159 points.
The Broncos split oven in a two
game series with UCLA and have
beaten such teams as Georgetown,
Temple, and the Senators. They lost
by close scores to two other good
eastern schools, Duquesne and City
College of New York, during a
Christmas eastern invasion.
They have also been beaten by
USF and St. Mary's.
MOKK ON CAL GAMES
Mopping up details on the Cal
games- Friday night's encounter was
(he toughest one to lose despite the
greater point differential.
Only reason the Bears' margin was
more than two points was Stanford
fouls in the last minute, practically
unavoidable against a team that is
stalling.
Both clubs were missing shots, but
the Cal men were missing because
they were rushed off their feet by
Stanford's tremendously effective
man-to-man defense. None of the
Bears was getting any set-shots to
speak of.
Among the Indian reserves who
looked especially impressive were
George Yardley, Cus Chavalas, and
Jack Scharfen.
Steve Stephenson played the en

tire game Friday night and got only
a few minutes of relief Saturday.
And we have to mention Bob Lew
is again (if only because his picturc*
appears above). The string bean
guard's covering of Chuck Hanger
was of a quality seldom seen on any
basketball court.


808 LEWIS did a great job fill
ing in for the sick Dave David
son last weekend. Bol» held Chuck
Hanger to 13 points in a game and
a half of man-to-man guarding.
