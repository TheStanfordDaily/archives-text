## 
### 
' In a thrilling climax to a hard-
J fought battle, Phi Kappa Signia's
| Ken Lettic-h dramatically won a
I mural basketball game for his team
| last night by sinking a free throw
j in a double overtime period, as the
Phi Kaps finally heat the fighting
Sigma Nu Speeches, 17 to 1(5.
It was this same Lettieh who
I pulled the game out of the fire in
j the first overtime period. Willi the
| score Hi to 14 in favor of the Speed
! ies, and with the low-scoring game
apparently all sewed up, Lettieh
j suddenly broke away with the ball,
j scampered down the court, and
I scored with a one-handed push shot
I from just outside the foul circle.
