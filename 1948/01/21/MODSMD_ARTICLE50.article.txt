# Thirty-five Aspirants Try for Places On Unpolished Frosh Baseball Club
## 
### 
Afti r another successful year in
the ranks of professional baseball,
little Bush Bushong returns to the
Farm to take over the giant-sized job
of handling the freshman hasehallers.
The way the squad sizes up at
present Coach Bushong will have to
instill in the team all the fire, hus
tle, and ability which gave him a
place on the Western International
League all-star team.
Only a few precious weeks remain
until the yearling nine goes onto the
field for its lirst game, and between
now and then the squad will have to
show a lot of improvement and hus
tle.
One bin weakness of the present
outfit is the shortage of talent, as
only about thirty-five players turn
ed out for the team.
INTIFLD STRONGEST
The soundest department seems to
be the infield, but even here the
depth is not too great. The starting
combination of Dick Williams at
catcher. Don McComber at the initial
sack, Joe Pinotti at the keystone cor
nel'. Bob Ames at short, and Sal
Col I el to at the hot corner has given
the team some stability.
During recent batting practices
these five have been quite prominent

at the plate, but time will tell how
the hitting holds up under pressure.
TKAIH'CCO CAN HIT
Heaviest hitter to date has been
big Jim Trabueco, who leads the out
field trio. Since it is a little early in
the season as yet to begin heavy run
ning and throwing activity, the out
field has concentrated on hitting .and
handling fly balls.
Denny Tuffanelli has also shown
that he has the power to give the
horsehide a ride, as have Richard
Vande, Lawrence Fink, and Dave
I.shell.
Most vulnerable of all positions
appears to be the pitching staff, and
at present none of the but lers seems
capable of hurling anywhere near the
nine full innings.
Control seems to be lacking, and
although it is a little early as yet,
not too much "stuff" has been dis
played by any of the hurlers. Best
of the flingers at the time is be
spectacled Jim Claypoole.
SATI'KDAY PIIAC TICFS
In order to strengthen the fresh
man nine, Coach Bushong has re
verted to using Saturday practices
for those who want to come out, and
last Saturday's optional session had
a surprisingly large turnout.
Concerning tlie team Coach Bush

ong stntcd, "'We have some pretty
vood looking boys, and wilh another
pitcher we'll have a good chance."
Bushong, a student at Stanford,
tutored last year's JV baseball team,
and then left to play second base
for Bremerton in the Western Inter
national League. "Bush" will return
to Bremerton later this year.
During his career he has played
for San Francisco, Wenatchee, Syra
cuse, Columbia, and numerous Army
teams.
While in the service he was nom
inated to a berth on the 1944 Pacific
All-Star team, composed mainly of
major and minor league stars. Be
fore signing a professional contract
"Bush" cavorted for the University
of Washington.
