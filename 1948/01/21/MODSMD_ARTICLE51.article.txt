PHOENIX. Ariz., Jan. 20 (UP).â€”
The Phoenix Kiwanis Club failed
to decide today whether to continue
the New Year's Day Salad Bowl

Faced with a $2,950 setback as a
result of the first game this year,
the members finally agreed to leave
the issue up to a secret mail ballot
ol the membership.
North Texas State and the Uni
versity of Nevada met in the inaug
ural contest, Nevada winning 13-6.
