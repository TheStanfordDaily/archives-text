# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
According to The Stanford Daily, Excom recently
passed a by-law setting up a Committee on Student.
Employment. Among their duties is the opportunity
to "act as a fact-finding and mediating body in dis
putes between students and their employers, either
the University of private firms."
This poor man's NLRB is the dawning of a new era
for student labor. Here we are—B.ooo students work
ing from 8 in the morning until sometimes 12 at night.
Direct violation to the Fair Labor Standards Act
which prohibits "oppresive child labor." And we
haven't even got a union.
Reminds me of the stranger in San Francisco who
asked a native:
"Pardon me, sir, can you direct me to the ferry
building?"
The San Franciscan raised an eyebrow and replied:
"My God are those guys organized too?"
I know a guy who's making a lot of money in
crooked dough—he's a pretzel bender. He's got a
union.
I know a guy who's working in a panty factory.
He's got a good job, and is pulling down 10,000 a
year. He s got a union.
The whisk broom makers, the die sinkers, the
siderographists, they all got unions. Even the profes
sors got a union, only when you get on that level its
called an "association."
So your textbooks, pencils, and paper are all union
made. The campus streets and recent buildings were
union constructed. There is even a University Presi
dent's Association.
But the very core of academic life, the students
themselves, are as unorganized as a coed with broken
shoulder straps. What have we got to bargain collec
tively with, I ask you?
Excom. Men's Council, Phi Beta kappa, and the
Alumni Association.

We have all the necessities for the founding of a
strong union. 8,000 members in a local is pretty good.
We all have common interests. The strike has been
used successfully in colleges before, and certainly the
"lock out" is nothing new to campus life.
How would it work? Well, let's say (for sake of
keeping the discussion current) that you are taking 15
units including a Spanish course. You've got so much
translation that on Friday nights you are still doing
Tuesday's homework. You squawk to the grievance
committee, who send around the business agent to
get a new contract with the Administration.
They argue and get nowhere. You and the rest of
the Spanish students go out on strike while Taft and
Hartley nod their heads in approval.
The local union notifies the AFL with whom you
are affiliated. They notify the AFL bookbinders and
the AFL teamsters, who shut off the supply of text
books to the University.
Students in Spanish classes from Washington State
to Harvard go out on sympathy strike.
The administration hires a bunch of kids from Paly
High to work as strike breakers. Education is at a
standstill, and the President's Council on Higher Edu
cation hires Jerry Giesler as their attorney.
, Eventually what happens is a board of impartial
production experts come in to re-evaluate the Spanish
class. They find it's worth three units more than is
being given now. This allows you to drop your class
in basket-weaving, concentrate on your Spanish, and
still get the same number of units as before.
You have now the academic equivalent of a wage
raise, and you have bargained collectively, and effect
ively.
Does it sound far fetched? Well, maybe. Never
theless, arise students of the world, you have nothing
to lose but your outside reading.

This poor man's NLRB is the dawning of a new era
for student labor. Here we are—B.ooo students work
ing from 8 in the morning until sometimes 12 at night.
Direct violation to the Fair Labor Standards Act
which prohibits "oppresive child labor." And we
haven't even got a union.
Reminds me of the stranger in San Francisco who
asked a native:
"Pardon me, sir, can you direct me to the ferry
building?"
The San Franciscan raised an eyebrow and replied:
"My God are those guys organized too?"
I know a guy who's making a lot of money in
crooked dough—he's a pretzel bender. He's got a
union.
I know a guy who's working in a panty factory.
He's got a good job, and is pulling down 10,000 a
year. He s got a union.
The whisk broom makers, the die sinkers, the
siderographists, they all got unions. Even the profes
sors got a union, only when you get on that level its
called an "association."
So your textbooks, pencils, and paper are all union
made. The campus streets and recent buildings were
union constructed. There is even a University Presi
dent's Association.
But the very core of academic life, the students
themselves, are as unorganized as a coed with broken
shoulder straps. What have we got to bargain collec
tively with, I ask you?
Excom. Men's Council, Phi Beta kappa, and the
Alumni Association.

We have all the necessities for the founding of a
strong union. 8,000 members in a local is pretty good.
We all have common interests. The strike has been
used successfully in colleges before, and certainly the
"lock out" is nothing new to campus life.
How would it work? Well, let's say (for sake of
keeping the discussion current) that you are taking 15
units including a Spanish course. You've got so much
translation that on Friday nights you are still doing
Tuesday's homework. You squawk to the grievance
committee, who send around the business agent to
get a new contract with the Administration.
They argue and get nowhere. You and the rest of
the Spanish students go out on strike while Taft and
Hartley nod their heads in approval.
The local union notifies the AFL with whom you
are affiliated. They notify the AFL bookbinders and
the AFL teamsters, who shut off the supply of text
books to the University.
Students in Spanish classes from Washington State
to Harvard go out on sympathy strike.
The administration hires a bunch of kids from Paly
High to work as strike breakers. Education is at a
standstill, and the President's Council on Higher Edu
cation hires Jerry Giesler as their attorney.
, Eventually what happens is a board of impartial
production experts come in to re-evaluate the Spanish
class. They find it's worth three units more than is
being given now. This allows you to drop your class
in basket-weaving, concentrate on your Spanish, and
still get the same number of units as before.
You have now the academic equivalent of a wage
raise, and you have bargained collectively, and effect
ively.
Does it sound far fetched? Well, maybe. Never
theless, arise students of the world, you have nothing
to lose but your outside reading.
According to The Stanford Daily, Excom recently
