Secretary Marshall spoke some very wise words a
few months a,140. Hi? spoke of the importance of a
knowledge of history for the solution of our present
problems. He deplored our general ignorance and
criticized the way in which history is taught in our
schools. "The present troubles of the UN.'' he said,
"could be much better understood if we remembered
our own history and the bitter struggles that took
place before our Constitution was adopted."
Mr. Marshall admitted his own inadequate knowl
edge, but he lamented especially the deplorable ig
norance of Congressmen. "I have felt," he said, "in
our dealing with Congress that one of our greatest
troubles is the limitation of knowledge of what has
happened in the past."
There is ureal truth in those words. 1 believe that
if there was some way, particularly on the high school
level, of bringing the students to a little better per
ception, not through dull recitations, memorized, de
livered, and forgotten, but through some graphic
means, of what happened in Greece and Rome and
the other crucial points in history, about three-fourths
of the speeches would be eliminated in Congress.
They would know that these speeches had already
been said and very well said many times in the past.
But .just look how history is being taught in high

school. Memorization, obscure facts, and irrelevant
material are assigned and drilled into the student.
What kind of worthwhile education is that?
And, believe me, colleges do not wander far from
this path, either. The great majority of colleges em
ploy history faculties—instructors to full professors—
and they teach with a total disregard to the broad,
overall picture of history; they emphasize obsolete
dates, listing kings in order, and memorization.
Actually, a student does not learn from this type of
education; he develops a dislike for the course and
the instructor. Why should interesting history courses
be made dry and boring when they could be so dif
ferent? Why shouldn't the student be given the
opportunity to learn by a subjective way of teaching
rather than objective? And what possible use can a
student have of memorizing a list of battles and dates
in learning the history of any nation?
I will agree, of course, that a few dates and
events are important and they should be learned, but
the number of these are very small, and they should
be used only to buttress the idea of the complete
picture.
It is up to you teachers and professors now to give
a well-rounded education, not only in history but in
every other field of schooling, to our future leaders
and citizens. Let's give the students what they want!
