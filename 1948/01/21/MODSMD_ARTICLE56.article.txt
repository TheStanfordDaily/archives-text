To the Editor:
Gi or e Brurm in yesterday's "History 1948" has
warned us against the danger of explaining away our
faults. He has accused himself and other Americans
of paying only lip service to the United Nations and
to the principles of freedom and equality. And in some
measure 1 believe him to he correct.
Few Americans claim our government and our
economy to be perfect. The value of our system is
rather in its ability to correct and perfect both its
political and economic aspects however slowly or
however rapidly the enfranchised millions desire.
We cannot deny that thousands (not millions) of
ne?!rocs are denied good schooling and the "right to
â€¢et ahead." Despite this failing of ours, there are
many influential and many "ordinary" citizens work
ing to end this discrimination. The process of equal
ization is too slow for many and too fast for others.
But it is the great advantage of our heritage that we
are changing, that we are able to progress.
But is this the dangerous double standard system
of the hypocrite? I cannot believe so. 1 rather sec
it as the faith of a people in this ability to increase
the prosperity of their nation and, through the pros
perity of the nation, the advancement of the standards
of all its inhabitants.
And what is our foreign policy hut an extension of
this ideal into the world? Here our "double standard"
is the policy of a nation at war. For we are now at
war with the political doctrine of communism, which,
in its more radical and international phase is directly
and immediately threatening our hopes and our faith
i.i the future freedom of Americans, and. indeed,
of all mankind.
Some of us may deny the existence of such a
fundamental ti ugglc. And, SI they can do so suc
cessfully, they may l>e able to establish their charge

of double dealing. I cannot, however, interpret the
events of the past few years as anything but an attempt
by communism to dominate the world. And commun
ism is personified, is given shape and power and sub
stance by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
If the facts demand that we should give only lip
service to the United Nations, we should not be ac
cused of hypocrisy if we act on these facts. Our inter
national ideals are well known, but like our domestic
policies, they are often goals towards which we are
still striving.
When there are two opposing systems of political,
economic and religious standards, there is an inevit
able conflict. The conflict cannot be talked away. Our
recent foreign policy has consistently shown this.
It is tempting, and, incidentally, very easy, to
write criticisms of America. It is done in Russia all
the time. It should be done in the United States.
But criticisms should be paced with the times,
should be related to the facts and not half-facts or
part-truths. Above all they should be constructive. I
cannot but feel that George Brunn's article has not
met these standards, and it is for this reason that I
have criticized his analysis of "guilty" America.
