# Navajoes Neglected; Denied Ballot Rights
## 
### FRANK SARLES 
It is supposedly the right of every American citizen to regulate
his welfare by means of the ballot. Leland Gardner's people, a
tiny minority of 60,000 persons, might well question the univer
sality of this privilege. Unlike most minorities, they suffer, not
from active discrimination, but from neglect.

Leland Gardner, an 18-year-old
Farm freshman, is a Navajo Indian.
His people have a proud history.
A hundred years ago, they were a
fiercely independent band whose
hunting grounds were bounded by
the rising find setting sun. Today
they are a miserable, starving na
tion-within-a-nation who know lit
tle of the world beyond their 1(5-
million-acre reservation in the arid
region of northern Arizona and New
Mexico.
CALORIES DEFICIENT
Their pride and their independ
ence are crumbling under the com
bined assaults of disease and mal
nutrition. It is hard to be proud and
independent on a diet of 900 calo
ries a day. The official ration in
the American zone of Germany is
1,550 calories.
Hunger is not the only cross the
Navajo bears. The infant mortality
rate is more than six times the na
tional average. One person in three
suffers from tuberculosis, and hos
pital facilities are totally inade
quate. For the entire group of
(50.000, there were, in 194(5, one field
nurse, two dentists, and a handful
of doctors.
TEACHERS SCARCE
Ninety per cent of the Navajoes
cannot speak English, despite the
fact that members of the tribe be
came American citizens in 1924. By
a treaty signed in 1868, the govern
ment promised to provide one
teacher for every 30 students. To
day there are facilities for only 7,000
of the 24,000 children of school age.
Thirty-five Navajo families have
annual incomes of $2,000 or more,
but they are far removed from the
average. Over one-third of the fam
ilies have incomes of less than $750.
which is the "bare subsistence"
level for their location and way of
life. The average Indian has an in
come of $820 per year.
They live in igloo-shaped huts of
logs and mud called hogans. Being
shepherds, they move around dur
ing the year to find the best graz
ing. Their diet is coffee, fried bread,
and, occasionally, mutton. Since
some families have only 30 sheep,
however, mutton is a rarity.
The Navajoes have not always
been in such a desperate plight,
even after they were defeated by
the white men in 18(54. Strangely

enough, their situation arose from
their very independence. While
many Indian tribes accepted doles
from the government, the Navajoes
would not.
DEFEATED BY CARSON
In 18(54, Kit Carson's cavalrymen
forced the defeated remnants of the
tribe (into the Bosque Redondo res
ervation in eastern New Mexico. In
18(58, the 9,000 survivors signed a
treaty with the ' government in
which they promised not to fight the
while man. In return, the govern
ment gave each Indian two sheep,
and promptly forgot them.
The first census in 1920 showed
that the tribe had tripled in popu
lation. but no count was made of
Ihe sheep. In 1930, the census
.showed 45,000 Navajoes, but again
the sheep were neglected. When
government officials finally took a
sheep-count in 1C33, they were hor
rified to discover that they num
bered around one and one-half mil
lion. Soil erosion was far advanced
as a result of overgrazing. In 1934,
the Navajoes were forced to reduce
the size of their flocks drastically.
From that time, the specter of star
vation has haunted them.
PROVIDE MANPOWER
The Navajoes responded promptly
and heartily to the country's need
for manpower in the last war. Of
the (>O,OOO population, 3,G00 went
into the armed forces, and over
12,000 worked in war plants. When
the war ended, these illiterate and
unskilled patriots were quickly dis
placed and forced back into the
squalor of the reservation.
Although they are now citizens
of the United States, the Navajoes
cannot vote. The United States
Constitution provides that the states
shall set voting qualifications, and
New Mexico and Arizona have ef
fectively excluded them. Because
the Navajoes do not pay taxes, their
children cannot attend the state
supported schools.
''We naturally blame the officials
in Washington," Gardner said. '"But
it is only the American people who
can remedy the situation. They
must realize the urgency of the
Navajoes' needs, and they must see
that something is done. Common
humanity demands it!"

The Navajoes have not always

would not.
DEFEATED BY CARSON
In 18(54, Kit Carson's cavalrymen
forced the defeated remnants of the
tribe (into the Bosque Redondo res
ervation in eastern New Mexico. In
18(58, the 9,000 survivors signed a
treaty with the ' government in
which they promised not to fight the
while man. In return, the govern
ment gave each Indian two sheep,
and promptly forgot them.
The first census in 1920 showed
that the tribe had tripled in popu
lation. but no count was made of
Ihe sheep. In 1930, the census
.showed 45,000 Navajoes, but again
the sheep were neglected. When
government officials finally took a
sheep-count in 1C33, they were hor
rified to discover that they num
bered around one and one-half mil
lion. Soil erosion was far advanced
as a result of overgrazing. In 1934,
the Navajoes were forced to reduce
the size of their flocks drastically.
From that time, the specter of star
vation has haunted them.
PROVIDE MANPOWER
The Navajoes responded promptly
and heartily to the country's need
for manpower in the last war. Of
the (>O,OOO population, 3,G00 went
into the armed forces, and over
12,000 worked in war plants. When
the war ended, these illiterate and
unskilled patriots were quickly dis
placed and forced back into the
squalor of the reservation.
Although they are now citizens
of the United States, the Navajoes
cannot vote. The United States
Constitution provides that the states

New Mexico and Arizona have ef

the Navajoes do not pay taxes, their
children cannot attend the state
supported schools.

It is supposedly the right of every American citizen to regulate

for manpower in the last war. Of
the (>O,OOO population, 3,G00 went
into the armed forces, and over
12,000 worked in war plants. When
the war ended, these illiterate and
unskilled patriots were quickly dis
placed and forced back into the
squalor of the reservation.
Although they are now citizens
of the United States, the Navajoes
cannot vote. The United States
Constitution provides that the states
shall set voting qualifications, and
New Mexico and Arizona have ef
fectively excluded them. Because
the Navajoes do not pay taxes, their
children cannot attend the state
supported schools.
''We naturally blame the officials
in Washington," Gardner said. '"But
it is only the American people who
can remedy the situation. They
must realize the urgency of the
Navajoes' needs, and they must see
that something is done. Common
humanity demands it!"
It is supposedly the right of every American citizen to regulate
his welfare by means of the ballot. Leland Gardner's people, a
tiny minority of 60,000 persons, might well question the univer
sality of this privilege. Unlike most minorities, they suffer, not
from active discrimination, but from neglect.

Leland Gardner, an 18-year-old
Farm freshman, is a Navajo Indian.
His people have a proud history.
A hundred years ago, they were a
fiercely independent band whose
hunting grounds were bounded by
the rising find setting sun. Today
they are a miserable, starving na
tion-within-a-nation who know lit
tle of the world beyond their 1(5-
million-acre reservation in the arid
region of northern Arizona and New
Mexico.
CALORIES DEFICIENT
Their pride and their independ
ence are crumbling under the com
bined assaults of disease and mal
nutrition. It is hard to be proud and
independent on a diet of 900 calo
ries a day. The official ration in
the American zone of Germany is
1,550 calories.
Hunger is not the only cross the
Navajo bears. The infant mortality
rate is more than six times the na
tional average. One person in three
suffers from tuberculosis, and hos
pital facilities are totally inade
quate. For the entire group of
(50.000, there were, in 194(5, one field
nurse, two dentists, and a handful
of doctors.
TEACHERS SCARCE
Ninety per cent of the Navajoes
cannot speak English, despite the
fact that members of the tribe be
came American citizens in 1924. By
a treaty signed in 1868, the govern
ment promised to provide one
teacher for every 30 students. To
day there are facilities for only 7,000
of the 24,000 children of school age.
Thirty-five Navajo families have
annual incomes of $2,000 or more,
but they are far removed from the
average. Over one-third of the fam
ilies have incomes of less than $750.
which is the "bare subsistence"
level for their location and way of
life. The average Indian has an in
come of $820 per year.
They live in igloo-shaped huts of
logs and mud called hogans. Being
shepherds, they move around dur
ing the year to find the best graz
ing. Their diet is coffee, fried bread,
and, occasionally, mutton. Since
some families have only 30 sheep,
however, mutton is a rarity.
The Navajoes have not always
been in such a desperate plight,
even after they were defeated by
the white men in 18(54. Strangely

enough, their situation arose from
their very independence. While
many Indian tribes accepted doles
from the government, the Navajoes
would not.
DEFEATED BY CARSON
In 18(54, Kit Carson's cavalrymen
forced the defeated remnants of the
tribe (into the Bosque Redondo res
ervation in eastern New Mexico. In
18(58, the 9,000 survivors signed a
treaty with the ' government in
which they promised not to fight the
while man. In return, the govern
ment gave each Indian two sheep,
and promptly forgot them.
The first census in 1920 showed
that the tribe had tripled in popu
lation. but no count was made of
Ihe sheep. In 1930, the census
.showed 45,000 Navajoes, but again
the sheep were neglected. When
government officials finally took a
sheep-count in 1C33, they were hor
rified to discover that they num
bered around one and one-half mil
lion. Soil erosion was far advanced
as a result of overgrazing. In 1934,
the Navajoes were forced to reduce
the size of their flocks drastically.
From that time, the specter of star
vation has haunted them.
