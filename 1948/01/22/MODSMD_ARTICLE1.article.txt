# Republican Heads Demand $3 Billion Slash in Budget

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP)
Senate and House Republican
leaders today ordered a quick
overhauling of President Tru
man's new $39 billion Federal
budget, and reportedly hoped to
cut it by at least $3 billion.
"'We think the budget can be cut
substantially," House Speaker Jospeh
W. Martin, Jr., said after a two-hour
joint leadership conference.
Ho declined to estimate possible
reductions, but Chairman Harold
Knutson, R., Minn., of the House
ways and means committee told
newsmen earlier that (here was an
informal agreement among the lead
ers to shoot for a slash of at least
$3 billion.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, chairman of
the Senate GOP policy committee,
who first mentioned that figure in a
Providence, R. 1., speech last week,
said tonight that he still believed it
was a good one for the budget com
mittee to consider.
TAX CCr PROMISED
Martin said he hoped a spending
ceiling would be fixed this time be
fore the House goes to work on
Knutson's GOP-sponsored $5,000,-
000,000 general income tax cut bill,
probably next week. But he prom
ised that any wrangle over the bud
gel would not interfere with the tax
cut program.
The Knutson bill is still under
study by his ways and means com
mittee, and he reported "slow pro
gress" after a long meeting today.
Secretary of the Treasury John W.
Snyder claimed that the GOP tax
plan would result in a $6,300,000,000
annual loss of revenue, and might
wreck the country's "financial integ
rity." But he failed to persuade the
Republicans to adopt President Tru
man's counter proposal for $40 tax
credits for everybody, to be offset
by a 75 per cent excess profits tax
on wealthy corporations.
FARMERS BLAST GOP
Meantime, the National Farmers
Union denounced the House Repub
lican leadership for endorsing the
Knutson bill without any attempt
"to discover what the folks think
back home."
