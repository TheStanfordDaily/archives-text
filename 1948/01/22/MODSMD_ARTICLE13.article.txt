# Carr Predicts New Pressure On Russ Policy
## 
### 
' In any event, future Soviet for
eign policy will be regulated by ex
ternal and not internal influences,"
summarized the celebrated Profes
sor E. H. Carr in his speech on the
"Background of Soviet Foriegn Pol
icy" last night at the Memorial Au
ditorium.
Professor Carr emphasized that
the key to understanding the Soviet
Union rests on the view of incom
patibility with the capitalistic so
cieties. One of the main character
istics of the Soviet Union is the
axiom of seeking alliance with one
capitalistic power against other cap
italistic nations in view of security
for the Soviet Union.
CHANGE IN POLICY
However, since the defeat of the
most imminent capitalistic nation,
Germany, the Soviet Union has had
a psychological change in policy.
Now that, the Soviet has gained
strength it is trying to further its
own interests by expanding its doc
trines, using the compromise veto
in th.e UN, and taking the attitude
that the will of the USSR will not
be overruled numerically.
Professor Carr said further, "I do
not see symptoms of a world con
queror in the Soviet Union, but
where the ideological background is
weak, then it will attempt to ad
vance the infiltration of Soviet doc
trine."
Professor Can's attitude toward
the Soviet-Western Europe conflict
was that, "There is no reason why
Russia and the Western powers
could not agree on UN decisions.
The question on which the confer
ences have broken were not vital
but compromisory problems. None
of them really clash."
THREE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES
In conclusion, Professor Carr stat
ed that there are three possible out
comes of the Soviet problem: (1)
that European capitalism with Unit
ed States aid may become predomi
nant and drive Russia into isolation;
(2) that Western Europe may form
an intermediary independent econ
omy, compelling a change in Rus
sian policy; (3) that European capi
talism may collapse and strengthen
the Soviet expansion.
