LONG BEACII, Jan. 21 (UP).â€”
Child star Margaret O'Brien
smashed a bottle of milk against the
SS Golden Bear today and launched
its mercy voyage with a shipload
of milk for Europe's children.
About 600 tons of canned milk
were aboard the California Mari
time Academy ship when it arrived
in Los Angeles Harbor Tuesday,
with an undetermined number of
tons added here.
