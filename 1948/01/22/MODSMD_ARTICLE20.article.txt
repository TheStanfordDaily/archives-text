LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21 (UP).â€”
A billion - dollar subway system
which could show a profit while
solving Los Angeles public trans
portation problems was proposed to
the city council today by consulting
enrineer Henry A. Babcock.
The subways, operating at 45
miles per hour and better, would
eliminate surface streetcars and
buses and serve 175 of the city's
450 square miles with a universal
10-cent fare. The system could be
built within 10 vears, he said.
