PETITION PROPOSED
A petition of 2500 names saying
that the case should be re-opened
was proposed as a way to get the
decision reversed. However, no final
decision as the method the class
would take was made last night. This
will be worked out by the commit
tee appointed.
The fact that the Council did not
have adequate reasons for their ap
portionment of the assessment was
stated by Rosin. Also, it was brought
up that the Council is composed en
tirely of upper classmen, and that no
representatives of either the fresh
men or sophomores were heard by
the Council.
"Should the class as a whole have
to pay for damage that a very few
people did?" was another point rais
ed in opposition to the assessment.
"Fixing responsibilities" was not
a sufficient reason for assessing the
class as a whole, it was decided.
