# Audience Lauds 'Phaedra' Reading
## 
### 
'I licre was ci two-fold challenge
to the actors in the Little Theater
j last night. Both the exaggerated
] suffering in Racine's "Phaedra" and
the sedentary aspects of play
j reading were intelligently handled
I Elaine Maltzman, in tlie title role,
gave an electric performance,
sparking always and often flaming
Mclvin Elicit. and Ruth Fisher
seemed to understand and realize
their characters. Ellett was notably
delivery. David Hav/es struggled
at times successfully to overcome
his miscasting, and Eleanor Haine ,
created a believable Alicia.
The direction of Nancy Mac-
Naught was sensitive, and it, almo 1
entirely avoided the danger of lap'
ing into versified monotony. Yet the
fast pacing of ihe reading through
out the first act and much of tn r '
second was a weak factor which way
overcome only by the excellence of
j individual performances, notably
j those of Ellett, Miss Fisher, and
j Miss Maltzman, whose play it truly
! was.
