# Freshmen Agree To Assessment
## 
### 
At Thursday night's meeting of
the freshman executive committee,
the decision of the Men's Council
on the assessment of the freshman
class for Pajamarino damages was
approved, according to Tom August,
president of the group.
It was decided that, the assessment
be divided among the freshman liv
ing groups in the following man
ner: Encina, $225; Roble, $50; and
Village, $25. Each member of these
living groups is expected to pay his
share of the assessment, August
said.
Frosh Excom also expressed dis
satisfaction with the progress of the
drive for funds to support freshman
class activities for the next four
years. The percentage of contribu
tions to date is: Roble, 90 per cent;
Encina, 48 per cent; Village, 75 per
cent; Branner, 95 per cent; and off
campus, 30 per cent.
"I cannot emphasize too strongly
the need for complete co-operation
with this drive," August said. "Un
less the response of the Class of '51
improves immediately, Frosh Ex
com will be forced either to revise
the method of collection, or to can
cel many of the proposed class ac
tivities."
