# New Railroad Pushes Ahead Despite Snow and Competition

(This is the third article in a |
series concerning Lcland Stanford's
greatest achieveme.nlâ€”the build
ing of the first transcontinental
railroad).
Central Pacific passenger
trains began operating to Rose
ville by April 25, 1864. In June
the line was completed to New
castle, 31 miles from Sacramen
to. For nearly a year that was
the end of the road. The company j
treasury was empty.
Stanford said: "We worked and :
toiled as low men were capable of
working, but had great hopes that
we would succeed. Several times we
would willingly have gone out of it
with the clothes on our backs if we i
could have been guaranteed the j
completion of the road."
Charles Crocker described the sit
uation: "We could not borrow a dol
lar on the faith of Ihe company. Mr. !
Stanford, Mr. Huntington, Mr. Hop
kins, and myself had to give our
personal obligations for the money
necessary to carry us from month
to month.
BANKS HAVE NO FAITH
"There was not a bank that would
lend the company a cent. They had
no faith in it. We bought the first
50 miles of iron on our own personal
obligations, putting up the bonds of
the company besides as security. We
entered into an agreement whereby
we would personally be responsible
as individuals for 10 years for the
payment of interest on the bonds.
These were the responsibilities we
took, and if we had not done so
there would have been no railroad."
To make matters worse a flank
attack was delivered from Nevada.
In Carson City at the constitutional
convention of the summer of 1864
a paragraph was inserted calling for
the appropriation by the first state
legislature of $11,000,000 in bonds to
that railroad company building from
tidewater which should reach the
state first.
This provision gave notice that a
competing line was projected. It
m#de it more difficult to raise money
on Central Pacific securities.
CLAUSE STRUCK OUT
Stanford went to Carson City on
July 13 and was given a chancc to
speak to the delegates. As a result
of his talk the injurious clause was
stricken out of the constitution.
In the following winler, however,
the opponents of the Central Pacific
drafted a resolution to give $10,000,-
000 to the first corporation to estab
lish an uninterrupted railroad from ;
Nevada to navigable waters of the
Sacramento.
But this time Stanford and the as- !
sociates did not assert themselves.
The tide had turned and they were
not seriously disturbed. On Jan. 3,
1865, the Supreme Court had de
clared constitutional the act of 1864
which the state undertook to pay in
terest for 20 years on $1,500,000 of
company bonds.
BONDS MARKETED
The favorable decision by the high
court gave the railroad bonds equal
value to that of state bonds and they
were immediately marketable. One
of the noticeable results was the vig
orous resumption of construction
work which had lagged since the
line reached Newcastle the preced
ing June.
Another Supreme Court decision
aided the railroad in April, 1865. The
court ordered issuance of bonds
voted by the people of San Fran
cisco in May. 1863. These bonds were
delivered to Stanford in the amount
of $400,000 one week later. The de

lay had seriously affected the pro
gress of the road.
DELAY DISASTROUS
Stanford said that the delay was
disastrous because the winter after
San Francisco refused to issue the
bonds the railroad had reached New
castle. The winter was mild and the
climate was ideal for construction.
The next two years, however,
brought record snowfalls. Except for
the delays, he believed they could
easily have met the Union Pacific in
Cheyenne, Wyoming, rather than
Promontory, Utah.
An amendment by Congress to the
acts of 18G2 and 18(54 permitted the
Central Pacific to issue its own bonds
to the extent of 100 miles in advance
of the completed line.
On May 12, 1865, the government
delivered the first installment of
bonds issued to aid in construction
of the road, the amount being $1,-
258,000.
It. U. MOVES ON
With the worst financial problems
solved, the railroad moved ahead.
Another 12 miles was built by June
10. By Sept. 1 the road stretched to
Colfax, 55 miles from Sacramento.
Next summer Charles Crocker, in
an article of the Sacramento Union
of June 7, 1860, said, "The work goes
bravely on. We are working between
9,000 and 10,000 men, and 1,000 hors
es, and will employ more if they of
fer." Next month the road was com
pleted to Alta, 70 miles from Sacra
mento. On July 21 the company ran
an excursion train of ten cars carry
ing stock holders and invited guests
to that place to celebrate the occa
sion.
Cisco, destined to be the terminus
of the road for more than a year, or
until completion of the Summit Tun
nel, was reached in the last of No
vember.
TUNNEL STARTED
The Summit Tunnel was begun in
the fall of 1865. Work was slow, even
with three shifts of workers total
ling 3,000 men.
Stanford was worried. The Union
Pacific was making rapid progress.
Engineers of their company had sur
veyed a line to the eastern boundary
')[ California. The Central Pacific had
fixed upon Salt Lake Valley as its
goal as the trade and commerce of
that fertile region was necessary to
the success of the line. The Central
Pacific could not afford to control
only a short line over the mountains,
with steep grades, expensive to op
erate.
SNOW DELAYS WORK
California's heaviest snowfalls
plagued the railroad builders in the
winters of 1866-67 and 1867-68. Be
cause of the race with the Union Pa
cific the work had to go on. Also,
more mileage was needed for bonds.
The men not at work on the tunnel
were taken over the mountains and
put to work at the valley of the
Truckee river where the snow was
less.

j Work on the tunnels was costly,
i Snow slides carried away camps and
the men were not found until spring,
j Total snowfall for the season was
about 40 feet. Track material for 40
! miles of railroad, three locomotives,
I and 40 cars, had to be hauled on
I sleds from Cisco to Donner Lake,
i There it was all reloaded on wagons
I and hauled over miry roads to
Truckee, a distance of 28 miles.
MEN SENT AHEAD
It was necessary to have the heavy
work In Palisade Canyon done in ad
i vanee of the main force, and 3,000
] men were sent to that point about
300 miles in advance of the track.
All supplies, including water, had to
' be hauled the entire distance over
the deserts.
During the winter of 1860-67 Stan
ford and Crocker witnessed the in
effectual efforts of five locomotives
trying to push a snow plow through
the drifts. What was to be done?
Must the road remain idle for a por
i tion of every year? One day as the
! two were discussing the matter while
| at lunch. Stanford took out his pen
cil and began estimating the cost of
covering the track with snow sheds.
Before another winter the sheds were
finished. The 37 miles of sheds and
galleries cost more than $2,000,000.
