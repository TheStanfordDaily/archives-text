# Thompson Definitely Out; Card Hopes Fall
## 
### JACK BLOOD 
Hopes of the Stanford basketball team to score a double win
over two of the high ranking Pacific Coast independents this
weekend were clouded with the announcement by Coach
Everett Dean that Morley Thompson, ace Indian forward, would
be definitely out of both games and his running mate Bill Rose
would see only limited action.

Thompson has been sent to the
hospital and his absence from the
line-up will definitely hurt the Car
dinal offensive.
Bill Rose turned out for practice
yesterday but did not participate in
the drill on oflensive plays. He will
prboably miss the St. Mary's game
Friday night, but should be avail
able for Saturday night's game with
Santa Clara.
DAVIDSON STILL OUT
Dave Davidson, whose attack of
the flu has limited him to only a
little playing time in the last four
games, was missing from practice and
is not expected to see much action.
With the team weakened by the
loss of these key men the chances
of upsetting the apple (Kudelka)
cart of St. Mary's and halting the
Broncos will be very slim.
However capable reserves like Bob
Lewis, Gus Chavalas, Jack Scharfen,
and Milt Iverson will help fill the
gap left by the loss of Thompson.
Davidson and Rose and may yet sur
prise the Cow Palace clientele with
twin victories this weekend.
CIIUCK, ANDY ON BILL
Fans will get another look at
Chuck Hanger, Andy Wolfe, and
their teammates if they attend the
Cow Palace games.
California will be playing Santa
Clara tomorrow night while Stan
ford tangles with St. Mary's. Satur
day night the order will be reversed.
While the southern division teams
are meeting non-conference rivals,
northern division play will be going
right ahead.
Oregon and Washington meet in a
crucial series in Seattle, and Idaho
takes on Washington State at Pull
