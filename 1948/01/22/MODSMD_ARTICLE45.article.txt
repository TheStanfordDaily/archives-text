# Feller Agrees To '48 Salary
## 
### 
CLEVELAND, Jan. 21 (UP)—
Flashing his boyish grin in obvious
delight, Bobby Feller today signed
his 1948 contract with the Cleveland
Indians at terms that may permit
him to surpass the $87,000 he made
last year and perhaps even eclipse
Babe Ruth's all-time high of $91,000.
But in the words of owner Bill
Veeck, the Indians will have to have
"a phenomenally good year" at the
gate in order for Feller to become
the highest paid player in baseball
history.
I ONG CONFERENCE
Feller inked what may become a
history-making document so far as
baseball pay is concerned after an
hour and a half conference with
Veeck. They agreed on the base sal
ary at the very start, but had to mull
over three different bonus arrange
ments before one was agreed upon.
Feller, the Van Meter, la., farm
boy who toted his high school books
on his first spring training trip, glee
fully said, "I'm very happy about it.
Proof that I signed in the first con
ference showed that I was in a hurry
to get it over with."
HIGHER THAN '47
The speedball artist had every rea
son in the world to be happy. Under
the terms of the contract, he gets
the same base pay as he received
last year coupled with an attend
ance bonus agreement revised slight
ly from 1947.
Feller got $87,000 all gold under
the setup last year. That made him
the second highest paid player in
baseball history.
Ruth's highest salary was $80,000,
but in 1930 the Babe collected an ex-
Ira $11,000 as his cut of a spring ex
hibition game receipts, making his
total $91,000 for the season.
Veeck left little doubt about how
much he thinks Feller is worth.
"He's stil! the best pitcher in the
league," Veeck said, "and will draw

more people just to see him pitch
every fourth day than a Williams or
a DiMaggio will draw every day."

the second highest paid player in
baseball history.
Ruth's highest salary was $80,000,
but in 1930 the Babe collected an ex-
Ira $11,000 as his cut of a spring ex
hibition game receipts, making his
total $91,000 for the season.
Veeck left little doubt about how
much he thinks Feller is worth.
"He's stil! the best pitcher in the
league," Veeck said, "and will draw

more people just to see him pitch
every fourth day than a Williams or
a DiMaggio will draw every day."
