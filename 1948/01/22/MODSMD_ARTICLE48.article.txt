## Firemen Edge by Peacocks; Hamburgers Trample Chi Psi 
### PETE GREENFIELD 
Ye Olde Firehouse, playing steady,
well-organized basketball, rolled to
its second victory of the intramural
hoop season, a 34-23 triumph over
the plucky Peacocks of Phi Delta
Theta.
The Firemen, led by Capt. Jim
Ihlenfeldt, worked exceptionally well
as a unit. The forward wall of Bon
nar Cox and Louis Almgren at the
forward posts and Dude Angius in
the center slot accounted for all but
five of the victor's tallies, the Dude
being top man with 12 points. The
man who made the Firemen burn,
however, was ball-hawking Capt.
Ihlenfeld who set up the scores with
his smooth floor play. Roy Thiess, an
expert rebounder, also shone at his
guard post.
The outcome of the struggle was
never in doubt, the Firehouse lead
ing from whistle to buzzer and boast
ing a halftime 17-7 lead.
PEACOCKS SHOW FIGHT
Only pluck kept the Peacocks of
Phi Delta Theta within sight of the
Firemen. The Phi Delts maintained a
last pace throughout the tussle and
frequently broke men clear beneath
the basket. High scorers for the Pea
cocks were Paul McClosky and Dave
Dahle, sinking seven and six points
respectively. Frank Parr, Ed Hall,
and John Wallace filled out the rest
of the lineup.
Over at the Encina Gym, the Delta
Upsilon Hamburgers ground up the
Chi Psi A team to a 35-12 mincemeat.

!Â«ers leaving the floor with an 11-6
lead at the rest period. In the final
half, however. Dick Flat land entered
the game for the DU's to sink six
buckets for high scoring honors and
lead his teammates in the route.
Mike Carlson, who dropped in eh ht
points, Dave Lamson, Bob Regier,
Malcolm McKillop, and Ben Cardi-

The game was rough'n'ragged and
punctuated frequently by the whistle
of Referee Elb Puckett.
LOW-SCORE FIRST HALF
The first half of the struggle was
tight and low-scoring, the Hambur
nelli were other well-playing mem
bers of the Hamburger squad.
The Chi Psi A's suffered through
out the evening with an inability to
find the hoop. In other departments
of the game the Chi Psi's were al
most the equals of their opponents,
but they merely did not sink enough
shots to stay in contention. Members
of the starting team wei'e Hartwig
Sonneberg, Walt Dunbar, Erwin
Rosa, Tom Donaca, and R. B. Brown.
