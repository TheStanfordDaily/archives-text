# Byrnes Hit By Pravda
## 
### 
Russia's official paper Pravda has
labeled James Byrnes a war monger
on the basis of his book "Speaking
Frankly, "said Ernest Sorotskin of
(he Political Sciencc Department in
his review of Byrnes' book yester
day.
Sorotskin included in his review of
"Speaking Frankly" an analysis of
Byrnes' foreign policy as stated in
his book and also the reactions of
countries involved in the interna
tional crisis," to their foreign policy.
Byrnes' book is actually a docu
ment that begins with the Yalta con
ference and covers the foreign min
isters meetings until December,
1946. Sorotskin said that Byrnes
tries to back up his policy with rea
sons. His policies are:
1. The peace treaty with Germany,
Austria, and Japan should be signed
this year even if Russia refuses to
sign.
2. If Russia will not sign the treaty
and also refuses to move troops out
of these countries the allies should
go to the Security Council as a last
resort. If this does not get the right
results, some other form of last re
sort will have to be used, Byrnes
wrote. (Many believe last resort
means war, but Byrnes says he has
not mentioned the word force).
3. Support for the Truman Doc
trine.
~"4. The United Nations should de
termine if Russia has already violat
ed a province of the U.N. in ousting
the Hungarian foreign minister.
5. Support for the Marshall Plan.
(j. Rebuild Germany.
7. Forty year treaty among the al
lies for the demilitarization of Ger
many.
8. No reduction in the United
States of military power for 40 years.
9. Universal military training. .
10. Support for the Baruch plan
for the control of atomic enei'gy.
However, if Russia will not follow
the plan the United States should
build more and better atomic bombs.
Sources in both the United States
and England believe that although
Byrnes has good intentions, he has
not been successful in what he has
done, Sorotskin said.
