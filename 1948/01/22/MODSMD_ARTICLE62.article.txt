# Elections Are with Us, Again
## 
### 
Election time is again approaching on the
Stanford campus.
Winter quarter elections have traditionally
brought out a low percentage of candidates and
voters, probably because the positions on Men's
and Women's Councils and the SAC are not
regarded with the same importance as other
student body offices.
These jobs, although not given the promi
nence and publicity the other positions receive,
require earnest, qualified people.
The judiciary power of the student councils
is important and should be in the hands of stu

dents who are interested and willing to devote
a great deal of thought to their decisions.
To maintain a strong student government on
this campus, we need the best possible candi
dates for each office as well as a reliable person
in every job. When you take out a petition
for a friend in the next few days, be sure that
your friend is qualified for the position and is
willing to work at being a student body officer.
Stanford politics are not unimportant because
they concern only a small college campus.
This election involves the government of the
community in which we are living.—M.S.
