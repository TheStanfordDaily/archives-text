### WAYNE SARGENT 
The uio of words as a medium of expression has
always been a source of interesting phenomena.
For example: There have been some curious ideas
about anatomy published in newspapers as a result
of the ambiguity of the English language.
I read where a soldier recently was "shot in the
ticket office," while still another man was ''shot in
the suburbs."
Then there was the gal who "walked in upon his
invitation" and "seated herself upon his entering." I
suppose she sat down upon her being asked.
And to top it off, there was the guy who "kissed
her passionately upon her reappearance."
Don't get me wrong. I'm making no criticism of
the writers. Lord only knows I do poorly enough.
Just the other day an old English professor of mine
said to me:
"Sargent, I've been reading your column. You have
forgotten all I taught you. Heavens man—where is
your grammar?"
To which I replied:
"Just where she ought to be—home with grampar."
This you will of course recognize as a spurious an
swer. As a matter of fact my grammar died many
years ago when I was a little boy, and don't even
remember my gnunpar.
Nevertheless, the old Prof had a point. I couldn't
see the point because he had his hat on. For years I

thought it was just the way he combed his hair, but
now I know the old Prof had a point.
We always got along well because we had points
in common. Most mothers cut their youngsters' hair
by putting a bowl over their head and trimming around
the edges. My mother used a funnel.
But this is getting as far from the subject as the
nation is to a stable economy.
So I asked the professor what grammatical device
was of greatest benefit to college students.
The old Prof dangled a participle at me from the
end of his key chain from whence hung also a Phi
Beta Kappa key, and a "vote for Hoover" button.
Then he said:
"Aside from the use of the word 'etc.' in blue book
exams, the most invaluable gimmick to the college
student is the abbreviation. What would he or she
do without H.C.0., Excom, Mem. Aud., Biz Ad.,
NROTC, Eng., Sp., Dr., and Western Civ.?"
Abbreviations are definitely the greatest time sav
ing device since push-pull-click-click.
And remember that "time is the moving finger that
writes; and having writ moves on. Nor all your piety
nor wit can lure it back to cancel the subscription."
So, singing the praises of the abbreviation, the old
Prof left me, as I leave you, with the thought that
though space is elliptical in shape, time is shaped
like a pretzel.
Get out the funnel mother, I need a haircut.
