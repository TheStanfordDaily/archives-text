# CAMPUS OPINION
## What Criterion, Excom? 
### 
To the Editor:
After reading Excom member Norton's definition
of a "partisan, political action group" in Tuesday's
Daily, this subsequent question seems to me to be
in order- upon what policy (or policies) was Excom's
decision based in banning such "partisan, political
action groups" from this campus? Upon what criteria
are such groups adjudged as "blind" and "undesir
able in an academic community?"
Was I his action based upon a fear that the ideals
or institutions which are commonly accepted as basic
in our current society might be "undermined" by
"subversive propaganda?" Would not this position
indicate doubts in some minds as to the usefulness or
adequacy of our "basic ideals?" If we are sure that
;dl of the components of our society are "better for
the common welfare," then why should we fear an
ideological conflict with other ideals or principles?
Or do some among us believe that university students
are not competent enough to distinguish between
"true'' and "false" ideals? If so, then who is compe
tent to make such a distinction between propaganda
and truth?
Or was this action based upon a desire to keep
an institution of education free from "partisan groups?"
But isn't il a fundamental purpose of education to
prepare a student for "life" and isn't membership in
"partisan political groups" an important part of the
lives of most persons as citizens?
Or was this action based primarily upon pecuniary
considerations by Excom in respect to "the powers
that be?"
Anyway, if Excom is to be consistent in its policy,
why aren't the Student Federalists banned from cam
pus? It seems to me that this group is distinctly

"committed in advance to a certain position on cur
rent political issues," namely world government. Is
it that the objectives of this group are approved by
Excom and those of the PCA disapproved?
The general answer given to such questions is "II
you wish to join such organizations or attend such
meetings, you are free to do so off-campus.' But
to me this still does not answer the question, "Why
should we have to go ofl-canipus to hold such meet
ings? What does "Die Lull dor Freiheit Weht mean.'
