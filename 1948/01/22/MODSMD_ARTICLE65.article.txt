# Further Elaboration Desired

To the Editor:
In his letter to Mrs. McMullin and the editor, Mr.
Norton had the following to say:
"I am not at all sure that political parties make
much of a worth-while contribution nationally, and
would say that they are even less desirable in an
academic community."
The first part of the statement expresses what seems
to be a radically new idea in our time and what might
perhaps indicate a new trend of thought in the realm
of goverment and political theory. The Stanford stu
dents. I am sure, would appreciate some further elab
oration. The answer by the student body to the ques
tion of whether or not the old fashioned system of
political parties still has a functional place of reason
able importance in the political life of a nation and
state will be crucial in the discussion about the merits
and demerits of having political organizations on
campus.
The second conclusion of Mr. Norton no doubt
depends on the premise expressed at the beginning
of his statement.
