"There is no doubt that Eisen
hower is a candidate for the Re
publican Presidential nomination."

progressives in the party want to
know his position on national issues,
so that we can evaluate his candi

was squaring away for a fight to
prevent CIO left-wingers from sup
porting Henry A. Wallace's third
party.

ference with eight of the nine CIO
vice-presidents, and reportedly got
a vote of confidence for his proposal
that all CIO affiliates adopt a uni
