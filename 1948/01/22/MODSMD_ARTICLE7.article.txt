# Party Issue Reviewed By Excom
## 
### 
A petition proposing an ASSU by
law change to prevent discrimination
against partisan political groups was
reviewed last night by Excom. Ac
tion on the proposal, however, was
tabled until petition signatures can
be verified.
If Excom fails to approve the by
law change, the proposal will be sub
mitted to student body vote at the
Winter elections, Feb. 3.
The by-law change provides that
"it shall be the policy of the ASSU
that complete freedom of speech and
assembly, consistent with the law,
shall be maintained at Stanford, and
that the ASSU and its officers shall
not discriminate against organiza
tions because they advocate partisan
political policy."
The proposed constitution of the
Stanford University National Stud
ents Association was tabled "for re
vision and further consideration."
Excom split over the article in the
constitution providing for sludent
body election of the NSA chairman.
It was argued by NSA Chairman
Giiny Titus that since the chairman
will represent the student body at the
national convention, and in regional
affairs, the student body as a whole
should have a voice in his selection.
Opponents of this presented the
view that student body election
might result in the election of a less
qualified person, thus weakening
NSA. In an unofficial straw vote,
Excom opposed student body elec
tion of the chairman.
Excom last night also heard a re
port on foreign scholarships from
Jose de Larios; approved the ap
pointment of Bob Levison as Presi
dent of Cardinals to replace Bob
Berryman; approved the appoint
ment of Cam Sanders and Dana Tur
kington as co-chairmen of Activities
Files committee; heard Bob Brown
report on installation of washing ma
chines in campus living groups, and
tabled a proposed change in the Ac
tivities Council Charter regarding
Yell Leaders.
