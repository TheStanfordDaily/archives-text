# 'Unconquered' Proves Gory, Far-fetched, but Entertaining
## 
### OR APPERSON 
As is usual in Cecil B. DeMille's
epics, "Unconquered" contains many
stereotyped scenes â€” Goddard in
bath, charging Indians, blood and
thunder, and a duel over the hero
ine.
While there is nothing to be said
against these scenes per se. the ma
nipulation of the plot needed to in
corporate them is carried to the
point of being ridiculous.
One or two historical inaccura
cies also mar the story. Indians
charging on horses in the Allegheny
forests is far fetched, to say the
least. At the risk of seeming trivial,
the color of the Indian "war belts"
in the movie was red, yet the pre
dominant war colors of most East
ern tribes were black and white.
On the whole, however, the pic
ture is good entertainment. Gary
Cooper turns in his usual good per
formance. Paulette Goddard, while
being a bit ancient to portray a 17-
year-old girl, makes up in acting
what she lacks in youth. The sup
porting actors are, almost without
exception, excellent.
The technicolor production is
good, with the redcoats of the Brit
ish army filming vividly.
The story is laid in' the year 17G3,

during the Indian uprisings. It deals
with a young girl, convicted of mur
der in England, whose death sen
tence is commuted to 14 years'
bonded indenture in the colonies.
On board ship, she attracts the evil
attention of the villain, who is foiled
by the hero. This process is repeat
ed throughout the movie, until the
villain is finally "gut-shot" by Coo
per.
Massacres, Indian tortures, es
capes. etc., are thrown in to add to
the general effect.
