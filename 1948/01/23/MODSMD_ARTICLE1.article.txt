### 
"There is no longer an excuse for
a butt-littered Quad. Beginning
Monday the first of 50 cigarette-butt
receptacles will be placed in strategic-
Quad spots," Carroll Blacker, Super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds,
said yesterday.
Mr. Blacker, upon completion last
quarter of a personal survey of hea
vily-littered Quad areas, received
early this week a $200 shipment of
baked Terra Cotta, which is now be
ing finished into fifty twelve-inch
hiuh containers.
The Superintendent said, "It is
hoped that the receptacles, which
will be half filled with sand, may be
placed one to each door opening on
the Quad."
Mr. Blacker also mentioned that
he has written to the California State
Fire Marshal in hopes of obtaining a
license as an authorized applicator
of flame-retardant material.
This action on the part of the Su
perintendent was precipitated by the
recent passage of a state law stat
ing that all drapes and other decor
ations in places of public assemblage
must needs be treated with flame
proofing material.
