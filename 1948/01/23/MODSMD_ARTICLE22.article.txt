ed the Class of '50 $200 in connection
with Pajamarino damage, was voted
in a class meeting Wednesday night.
The class has not yet received a
bill for the fine, Suphomore Excom
stated. .
The $1000 assessment was divided
among the ASSU, 50 per cent; class
of '51, 30 per cent; and sophs, 20 per
cent.
The sophomore class claims, how
ever, that the decision was unjust
because no hearing was allowed.
Excom had previously approved a
division of the damages by living
groups, under which plan the soph
omores as a class received no fine.
