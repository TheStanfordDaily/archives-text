# Bevin Accuses Russia Of Europe Domination
## British Secretary Predicts War Unless Western Europe Unites 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 22 (UP) —Foreign Secretary Bevin said today
that Soviet Russia is making another ruthless drive to dominate
Europe, and that he believed continuance of this policy by any
one power will lead to another war.
Bevin opened a two-day debate on foreign affairs, amid re-

•ports that Britain may soon propose
a political, economic, and military
alliance with France, The
Netherlands, Luxembourg.
The foreign secretary proclaimed
Britain's right to organize "kindred
souls" of western Europe, saying:
"I believe the time is ripe for the
Consolidation of Western Europe."
Bevin said Russia's reaction to the
Marshall Plan has unmasked her de
sire to control Western as well as
Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, he
emphasized British eagerness to co
operate with the Soviets:
"It is madness to think of anything
else if we are ever going to have
peace. But the British Government
cannor agree to four-power cooper
ation while one of those powers con
tinues to impose its political and
economic system on the smaller
states.
"We have seen the game played
out in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary,
and more recently in Romania, and,
from information in our possession,
other attempts may be made else
where," he said.
RUTHLESS PROCEDURE
"It has been quite clear. I think,
that the Communist procedure goes
ruthlessly on in each country. It
therefore matters little how we tem
porize and maybe appease and try
to make arrangements."
Bevin said the issue with Russia
was not "simply the organization of
Poland or any country,", but "the
control of Eastern Europe by Soviet
Russia, whose frontiers have, in fact,
been advanced to Stettin, Trieste,
and the Elbe."
He described affairs in Greece as
"a dangerous situation" and a "case
of power politics," saying that Rus
sian policy in Greece appeared to be
( to wait until Britain and the United
States get "tired" and then incor
porate Greece into the Soviet ,m
-munist system.
BRITAIN IN GREECE
Britain had hoped to be out of
Greece. Bevin said, but "that has not
been allowed."
"The state of war has continued
for the whole time, and it is not a
question of democratic elections. It
is a question of ruthless war to bring
that country within the Soviet orbit."
He mentioned the refusal of Rus
sia to recognize a United Nations
Commission in Greece to make sure
that Albania, Bulgaria and Yugo
slavia do not help the communist
led guerrillas.
GERMAN PROBLEM
Bevin also accused Russia of "tor
turing Austria over all these years "
and outlined the efforts of the west
ern allies to reach agreement with
j Russia about Germany. He said Bri-
I tain wanted a "united Germany" and
not a dismembered or divided Ger
many.
"We have keen in favor of a fed
eral German government," he said.
"The Soviet supported an over-cen
tralized government which we know
could be used to develop a one-party
dictatorship as had been achieved in
Eastern European countries. To that
! we cannot agree."
He disclosed that talks between the
United States, Britain, and France
about the western zones "will tak<;
place at a very early date." Never
i theless, he said, Britain was goincj
i to try to achieve a four-power agrce-
I ment, at least on badly needed Ger-
I man currency reform.
