## Food Strike In Bavaria 
### 
FRANKFURT. Germany, Friday.
Jan. 2'.j (UP). A 24-hour general j
strike by an estimated 2,000.000
workers started at midnight Thurs- 1
day throughout Bavaria in protest
against the food situation.
Transport and other overnight J
workers were first affected by the \
walkout, which was the biggest in
Germany since the end of the war. i
Other workers will i'ail to report I
for their jobs (his morning.
UTILE EVIDENCE
Immediately jfter midnight there j
was almost 110 visible evidence that j
a strike was on. The narrow streets
of the big cities, still piled with |
World War II bombing rubbish,
were deathly quiet as usual.
The Bavarian cabinet met in i
emergency session as soon as the
strike was called. Il was too late to
do anything to avert the walkout,
however, and the cabinet contented ;
itself with issuing a statement de- j
nouncing the unions for ordering a
strike "in the time of greatest need
for our people and when the eco- j
nomic situation has deteriorated."
Whether response to the strike
order would be fully effective could j
not be determined until normal j
working hours this morning.
SKELETON CHEWS
Under the strike order only skel- i
eton crews manning hospitals, food |
processing plants, communications 1
centers, and press associations were i
left on the job in addition to police |
and persons employed by the
American Military Government.
There was no indication of Com
munist inspiration of the strike and |
labor union leaders emphasized ,
that it was called purely against the 1
Bavarian government which had !
rejected a seven-point labor food i
