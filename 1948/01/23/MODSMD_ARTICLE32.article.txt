troops have opened an offensive !
against the Communist - led guer- j
rillas on several northern and
south - central sectors and have [
killed, wounded, or captured 241 of ;
them, news dispatches said today !
quoting military sources.
Vradyni, a Royalist newspaper,
said there were indications that the
guerrillas were preparing to make [
a new attack on Konitsa and that j
guerrillas in the Grammos Moun- I
tain area were getting additional j
supplies from Albania.
The reports of a new offensive I
were not confirmed by official

an "offensive" actually was one of
a series of jabs expected to be car
ried on all winter to keep the guer
rillas off balance.
Maj. Gen. William Livesay, chief
of the U.S. military mission, has
hinted that the real offensive will
not be started until spring, but that
it is expected to clear out the guer
rillas by late spring or early sum
mer.
