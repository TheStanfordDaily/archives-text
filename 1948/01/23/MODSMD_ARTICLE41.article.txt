# Stanford Drives the Golden Spike

(This is tlie fourth ami last ar
; title in a series concerning Stan
ford's greatest achievement — the
building of tin* first transconti
nental railroad.)
Long, arduous work had push
ed the railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains. The Sum
mit Tunnel had been completed
and snow sheds built. The Cen
tral Pacific was now ready for
the final dash across Nevada
and Utah to meet the Union Pa
cific coming west.
Money was still needed, how
ever. The government bonds did
not come through rapidly enough to
pay the tremendous cost of railroad
construction. Stanford was still
pledging his personal credit in 18G7.
To borrow money for the railroad
i he arranged for loans from London
j bankers.
Until 1837 Stanford and his asso
ciates had been so absorbed in fi
nancial and engineering problems
of the road that they gave no at
j tention to a deep-water terminal for
! the road. They needed the deep
j water terminal to handle the Asiatic
trade they anticipated.
At first Stanford dccided to make
Goat Island the terminal; papers
were filed with the Secretary of
State on March 21, 1867. But in
I 1869 the Suez Canal was opened to
: traffic, and the expected Asiatic
J traffic did not materialize.
UNION PACIFIC ROLLS
Meanwhile the Union Pacific was
making rapid progress in its con
struction since it did not have to
overcome serious physical obstacles.
The thrilling story of the racc
during the years 1808 and 1809 be
tween the Union Pacific building
westward and the Central Pacific
building eastward has often been
\ told. Each company wished to con
trol the maximum of mileage, and
the Central Pacific particularly
needed to build far enough east to
get the Salt Lake business.
To expedite construction Stanford
I journeyed to Salt Lake five times
before the last spike was finally
driven.
In June 1868 Stanford charmed
Brigham Young, president of the
! Mormon Church, into working for
the Central Pacific—although Young
! had a prior contract with the Union
Pacific.
MORMON HEAL) WON OVER
At that time the Union Pacific and
| the Central Pacific—both working
j ahead of their lines—had surveyed
i different routes. Until Stanford
j talked with Young, the Mormon
j president had been in favor of the
j UP's southern route. Stanford con
! vinccd him of the benefits of the
I northern route.

In October. 1868. the CPRR filed
with the Secretary of the Interior
of the United States a map and pro
file of its proposed line from '"Mon
umental Point" (north end of Salt
Lake) to Echo Summit, head of j
Echo Canyon, and on Oct. 28 that j
official approved formally the route !
thus laid down. Stanford seems to j
have proceeded on the theory that I
the railroad must follow the ap- j
proved line and that by securing
the right of way over it he could
head off the Union Pacific.
Stanford defended the line stout
ly. Yet so powerful was the influ
ence of the Union Pacific lobby at
Washington that after some corre
spondence with Oliver Ames, pres
ident of the Union Pacific, the Sec
retary of the interior reversed his
decision.
SPECIAL COMMISSION
A special commission was ap
pointed to proceed to the front and
make an impartial report. The
members were instructed that the
law called for a railroad from Oma
ha to Sacramento upon the most
direct, central, and practicable
route, and they were to determine
the most advantageous route.
The question of the terminus was
finally settled by Congress on April
10. 1869, with a joint resolution to
the effect that "the common ter
minal of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads shall be at or
near Ogden; and the UPRR Co.
shall build, and the CPRR Co. shall
pay for and own. the railroad from
the terminus aforesaid to Promon
tory Summit, at which point the
rails shall meet and connect and
form one continuous line."
In the final settlement the Cen
tral Pacific leased from the Union
Pacific five miles of track from Og
den westward, and purchased out
right the remaining 56 miles to
Promontory.
After some remarkable feats of
track laying, climaxed by the laying
down of 10miles of track in one
day between sunrise and sunset by
the Central Pacific forces, the lines
were brought together and a junc
tion made on May 10. 1869.
THE LAST SPIKE
The joining of the rails from the
East with those from the West, was
of great political as well as commer
cial significance. The Coast states
were now an integral part of the
Union. The specter of a Pacific re
public was banished forever. A
realization of the importance of the
event prompted the celebration of
the driving of the last spike with fit
ting ceremonies.
On May 9. 1869, Stanford took a
silver sledge-hammer presented by
the Union Express Co. and drove
the spikes presented by California
and Nevada. Dr. Harkness present
ed on behalf of David Hewes of
Sacramento a gold spike. Nevada
offered a silver spike. Governor
Safford of Arizona presented gold,
silver, and iron spikes. (The spikes
and hammer are preserved in the
Stanford Museum.)
The procession celebrating the oc
casion in Sacramento was so long it
took over an hour to pass a given

point. Special trains poured in from
Vallejo, Stockton, Reno, and Vir
ginia Citv.
CONSOLIDATION
Purchase of other lines which led
to the ultimate consolidation of all
railroads under the Southern Pa
cific Lines began in 1865. Stanford
bought the Sacramento Valley Rail
j road, more to get an annoying
I neighbor out of the way than as an
' expansion project.
Final settlement for the Yuba
| Railroad was made on Oct. 21, 18139.
About that time the Western Pa
cific Railroad was also acquired.
Organized in 18(32, the Western Pa
-1 cific was assigned the right to build
under the Pacific Railroad Bill and
I with government subsidies a rail
road from San Francisco to Sacra
mento, by way of San Jose and
Stockton, to connect with the CPRR.
The name Western Pacific was
di'oppcd in 1870 when the road was
consolidated with the Central Pa
cific. The present Western Pacific
is a distinct organization of a much
later date. Finally Stanford started
negotiations to purchase the South
j ern Pacific Railroad.
j SOUTHERN i ACIFIC
The Southern Pacific had been
formed in 1865 to build a railroad
j from "some port in (he Bay of San
I Francisco through the counties of
Santa Clara, Monterey. San Luis
• Obispo, Tulare, Los Angeles, and
i San Diego, to the town of San
j Diego, thence eastward through the
county of San Diego to the eastern
I line of the state of California, there
I lo connect with a contemplated rail
; load from said eastern line of Cali
j fornia to the Mississippi River."

In August, 1868, the newspapers i
announced the Southern Pacific's j
plans for construction south from
San Jose through Gilroy and on the J
route outlined to Los Angeles. The >
announcement may have been made
in good faith—or is may have been
made to bluff Stanlord.
Nevertheless the Act of Congress j
providing for the construction of the j
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad recog- i
nized the SPRR as the western link,
of that line.
It was a foregone conclusion that
the owners of the Central Pacific
would not calmly witness the inva- j
sion of their territory by a compet
ing line without doing something. J
Furthermore, the Southern Pacific I
had on Feb. 4, 1868, entered into a !
contract for the purchase of the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad—
"The butt end of all railroads com
ing directly into San Francisco."
A RAILROAD ON PAPER
This road, which later proved to
possess such enormous potentiali- i
ties, existed chiefly on paper when j
I acquired by the associates. Its j
original owners and organizers had i
been in control for four years but i
during all that time had not got a j
single mile of road into operation, i
According to a report of the |
Southern Pacific for 1869, the com
pany possessed no engine houses, j
shops, engines, or cars. It did, how- |
ever, have a franchise to build to j
an eastern connection on the Colo- |
! rado River, a land grant from the i
I federal government, a contract for j
' the purchase of the San Francisco i
and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
tween San Jose and Gilroy.
During the autumn of 1873 the
| general offices of the CPRR were
j moved to the corner of Fourth and
| Townsend streets in San Francisco.
A RAILROAD GIANT
A line was built in 1872-74 from
j Sacramento to Bakersfield through
the San Joaquin Valley. Another
line extended to Oregon. In 1883
the Sunset Route was opened to
! New Orleans.
Until 1880 the Southern Pacific
! Lines had been leased to and oper
ated by the Central Pacific. During
the anti-railroad legislation of 1885.
j the situation was reversed, and the
I Central Pacific was leased to the
J Southern Pacific. Stanford's first
| transcontinental railroad had grown
| into a giant.

| the Central Pacific—both working
j ahead of their lines—had surveyed
i different routes. Until Stanford
j talked with Young, the Mormon
j president had been in favor of the
j UP's southern route. Stanford con
! vinccd him of the benefits of the
I northern route.

In October. 1868. the CPRR filed
with the Secretary of the Interior
of the United States a map and pro
file of its proposed line from '"Mon
umental Point" (north end of Salt
Lake) to Echo Summit, head of j
Echo Canyon, and on Oct. 28 that j
official approved formally the route !
thus laid down. Stanford seems to j
have proceeded on the theory that I
the railroad must follow the ap- j
proved line and that by securing
the right of way over it he could
head off the Union Pacific.
Stanford defended the line stout
ly. Yet so powerful was the influ
ence of the Union Pacific lobby at
Washington that after some corre
spondence with Oliver Ames, pres
ident of the Union Pacific, the Sec
retary of the interior reversed his
decision.
SPECIAL COMMISSION
A special commission was ap
pointed to proceed to the front and
make an impartial report. The
members were instructed that the
law called for a railroad from Oma
ha to Sacramento upon the most
direct, central, and practicable
route, and they were to determine
the most advantageous route.
The question of the terminus was
finally settled by Congress on April
10. 1869, with a joint resolution to
the effect that "the common ter
minal of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads shall be at or
near Ogden; and the UPRR Co.
shall build, and the CPRR Co. shall
pay for and own. the railroad from
the terminus aforesaid to Promon
tory Summit, at which point the
rails shall meet and connect and
form one continuous line."
In the final settlement the Cen
tral Pacific leased from the Union
Pacific five miles of track from Og
den westward, and purchased out
right the remaining 56 miles to
Promontory.
After some remarkable feats of
track laying, climaxed by the laying
down of 10miles of track in one
day between sunrise and sunset by
the Central Pacific forces, the lines
were brought together and a junc
tion made on May 10. 1869.
THE LAST SPIKE
The joining of the rails from the
East with those from the West, was
of great political as well as commer
cial significance. The Coast states
were now an integral part of the
Union. The specter of a Pacific re
public was banished forever. A
realization of the importance of the
event prompted the celebration of
the driving of the last spike with fit
ting ceremonies.
On May 9. 1869, Stanford took a
silver sledge-hammer presented by
the Union Express Co. and drove
the spikes presented by California
and Nevada. Dr. Harkness present
ed on behalf of David Hewes of
Sacramento a gold spike. Nevada
offered a silver spike. Governor
Safford of Arizona presented gold,
silver, and iron spikes. (The spikes
and hammer are preserved in the
Stanford Museum.)
The procession celebrating the oc
casion in Sacramento was so long it
took over an hour to pass a given

point. Special trains poured in from
Vallejo, Stockton, Reno, and Vir
ginia Citv.
CONSOLIDATION
Purchase of other lines which led
to the ultimate consolidation of all
railroads under the Southern Pa
cific Lines began in 1865. Stanford
bought the Sacramento Valley Rail
j road, more to get an annoying
I neighbor out of the way than as an
' expansion project.
Final settlement for the Yuba
| Railroad was made on Oct. 21, 18139.
About that time the Western Pa
cific Railroad was also acquired.
Organized in 18(32, the Western Pa
-1 cific was assigned the right to build
under the Pacific Railroad Bill and
I with government subsidies a rail
road from San Francisco to Sacra
mento, by way of San Jose and
Stockton, to connect with the CPRR.
The name Western Pacific was
di'oppcd in 1870 when the road was
consolidated with the Central Pa
cific. The present Western Pacific
is a distinct organization of a much
later date. Finally Stanford started
negotiations to purchase the South
j ern Pacific Railroad.
j SOUTHERN i ACIFIC
The Southern Pacific had been
formed in 1865 to build a railroad
j from "some port in (he Bay of San
I Francisco through the counties of
Santa Clara, Monterey. San Luis
• Obispo, Tulare, Los Angeles, and
i San Diego, to the town of San
j Diego, thence eastward through the
county of San Diego to the eastern
I line of the state of California, there
I lo connect with a contemplated rail
; load from said eastern line of Cali
j fornia to the Mississippi River."

In August, 1868, the newspapers i
announced the Southern Pacific's j
plans for construction south from
San Jose through Gilroy and on the J
route outlined to Los Angeles. The >
announcement may have been made
in good faith—or is may have been
made to bluff Stanlord.
Nevertheless the Act of Congress j
providing for the construction of the j
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad recog- i
nized the SPRR as the western link,
of that line.
It was a foregone conclusion that
the owners of the Central Pacific
would not calmly witness the inva- j
sion of their territory by a compet
ing line without doing something. J
Furthermore, the Southern Pacific I
had on Feb. 4, 1868, entered into a !
contract for the purchase of the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad—
"The butt end of all railroads com
ing directly into San Francisco."
A RAILROAD ON PAPER
This road, which later proved to
possess such enormous potentiali- i
ties, existed chiefly on paper when j
I acquired by the associates. Its j
original owners and organizers had i
been in control for four years but i
during all that time had not got a j
single mile of road into operation, i
According to a report of the |
Southern Pacific for 1869, the com
pany possessed no engine houses, j
shops, engines, or cars. It did, how- |
ever, have a franchise to build to j
an eastern connection on the Colo- |
! rado River, a land grant from the i
I federal government, a contract for j
' the purchase of the San Francisco i
and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
tween San Jose and Gilroy.
During the autumn of 1873 the
| general offices of the CPRR were
j moved to the corner of Fourth and
| Townsend streets in San Francisco.
A RAILROAD GIANT
A line was built in 1872-74 from
j Sacramento to Bakersfield through
the San Joaquin Valley. Another
line extended to Oregon. In 1883
the Sunset Route was opened to
! New Orleans.
Until 1880 the Southern Pacific
! Lines had been leased to and oper
ated by the Central Pacific. During
the anti-railroad legislation of 1885.
j the situation was reversed, and the
I Central Pacific was leased to the
J Southern Pacific. Stanford's first
| transcontinental railroad had grown
| into a giant.

Long, arduous work had push
ed the railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains. The Sum
mit Tunnel had been completed
and snow sheds built. The Cen
tral Pacific was now ready for
the final dash across Nevada
and Utah to meet the Union Pa
cific coming west.
Money was still needed, how
ever. The government bonds did
not come through rapidly enough to
pay the tremendous cost of railroad
construction. Stanford was still
pledging his personal credit in 18G7.
To borrow money for the railroad
i he arranged for loans from London
j bankers.
Until 1837 Stanford and his asso
ciates had been so absorbed in fi
nancial and engineering problems
of the road that they gave no at
j tention to a deep-water terminal for
! the road. They needed the deep
j water terminal to handle the Asiatic
trade they anticipated.
At first Stanford dccided to make
Goat Island the terminal; papers
were filed with the Secretary of
State on March 21, 1867. But in
I 1869 the Suez Canal was opened to
: traffic, and the expected Asiatic
J traffic did not materialize.
UNION PACIFIC ROLLS
Meanwhile the Union Pacific was
making rapid progress in its con
struction since it did not have to
overcome serious physical obstacles.
The thrilling story of the racc
during the years 1808 and 1809 be
tween the Union Pacific building
westward and the Central Pacific
building eastward has often been
\ told. Each company wished to con
trol the maximum of mileage, and
the Central Pacific particularly
needed to build far enough east to
get the Salt Lake business.
To expedite construction Stanford
I journeyed to Salt Lake five times
before the last spike was finally
driven.
In June 1868 Stanford charmed
Brigham Young, president of the
! Mormon Church, into working for
the Central Pacific—although Young
! had a prior contract with the Union
Pacific.

down of 10miles of track in one
day between sunrise and sunset by
the Central Pacific forces, the lines
were brought together and a junc
tion made on May 10. 1869.
THE LAST SPIKE
The joining of the rails from the
East with those from the West, was
of great political as well as commer
cial significance. The Coast states
were now an integral part of the
Union. The specter of a Pacific re
public was banished forever. A
realization of the importance of the
event prompted the celebration of
the driving of the last spike with fit
ting ceremonies.
On May 9. 1869, Stanford took a
silver sledge-hammer presented by
the Union Express Co. and drove
the spikes presented by California
and Nevada. Dr. Harkness present
ed on behalf of David Hewes of
Sacramento a gold spike. Nevada
offered a silver spike. Governor
Safford of Arizona presented gold,
silver, and iron spikes. (The spikes
and hammer are preserved in the
Stanford Museum.)
The procession celebrating the oc
casion in Sacramento was so long it
took over an hour to pass a given

point. Special trains poured in from
Vallejo, Stockton, Reno, and Vir
ginia Citv.
CONSOLIDATION
Purchase of other lines which led
to the ultimate consolidation of all
railroads under the Southern Pa
cific Lines began in 1865. Stanford
bought the Sacramento Valley Rail
j road, more to get an annoying
I neighbor out of the way than as an
' expansion project.
Final settlement for the Yuba
| Railroad was made on Oct. 21, 18139.
About that time the Western Pa
cific Railroad was also acquired.
Organized in 18(32, the Western Pa
-1 cific was assigned the right to build
under the Pacific Railroad Bill and
I with government subsidies a rail
road from San Francisco to Sacra
mento, by way of San Jose and
Stockton, to connect with the CPRR.
The name Western Pacific was
di'oppcd in 1870 when the road was
consolidated with the Central Pa
cific. The present Western Pacific
is a distinct organization of a much
later date. Finally Stanford started
negotiations to purchase the South
j ern Pacific Railroad.
j SOUTHERN i ACIFIC
The Southern Pacific had been
formed in 1865 to build a railroad
j from "some port in (he Bay of San
I Francisco through the counties of
Santa Clara, Monterey. San Luis
• Obispo, Tulare, Los Angeles, and
i San Diego, to the town of San
j Diego, thence eastward through the
county of San Diego to the eastern
I line of the state of California, there
I lo connect with a contemplated rail
; load from said eastern line of Cali
j fornia to the Mississippi River."

In August, 1868, the newspapers i
announced the Southern Pacific's j
plans for construction south from
San Jose through Gilroy and on the J
route outlined to Los Angeles. The >
announcement may have been made
in good faith—or is may have been
made to bluff Stanlord.
Nevertheless the Act of Congress j
providing for the construction of the j
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad recog- i
nized the SPRR as the western link,
of that line.
It was a foregone conclusion that
the owners of the Central Pacific
would not calmly witness the inva- j
sion of their territory by a compet
ing line without doing something. J
Furthermore, the Southern Pacific I
had on Feb. 4, 1868, entered into a !
contract for the purchase of the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad—
"The butt end of all railroads com
ing directly into San Francisco."
A RAILROAD ON PAPER
This road, which later proved to
possess such enormous potentiali- i
ties, existed chiefly on paper when j
I acquired by the associates. Its j
original owners and organizers had i
been in control for four years but i
during all that time had not got a j
single mile of road into operation, i
According to a report of the |
Southern Pacific for 1869, the com
pany possessed no engine houses, j
shops, engines, or cars. It did, how- |
ever, have a franchise to build to j
an eastern connection on the Colo- |
! rado River, a land grant from the i
I federal government, a contract for j
' the purchase of the San Francisco i
and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
tween San Jose and Gilroy.
During the autumn of 1873 the
| general offices of the CPRR were
j moved to the corner of Fourth and
| Townsend streets in San Francisco.
A RAILROAD GIANT
A line was built in 1872-74 from
j Sacramento to Bakersfield through
the San Joaquin Valley. Another
line extended to Oregon. In 1883
the Sunset Route was opened to
! New Orleans.
Until 1880 the Southern Pacific
! Lines had been leased to and oper
ated by the Central Pacific. During
the anti-railroad legislation of 1885.
j the situation was reversed, and the
I Central Pacific was leased to the
J Southern Pacific. Stanford's first
| transcontinental railroad had grown
| into a giant.

(This is tlie fourth ami last ar
; title in a series concerning Stan
ford's greatest achievement — the
building of tin* first transconti
nental railroad.)
Long, arduous work had push
ed the railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains. The Sum
mit Tunnel had been completed
and snow sheds built. The Cen
tral Pacific was now ready for
the final dash across Nevada
and Utah to meet the Union Pa
cific coming west.
Money was still needed, how
ever. The government bonds did
not come through rapidly enough to
pay the tremendous cost of railroad
construction. Stanford was still
pledging his personal credit in 18G7.
To borrow money for the railroad
i he arranged for loans from London
j bankers.
Until 1837 Stanford and his asso
ciates had been so absorbed in fi
nancial and engineering problems
of the road that they gave no at
j tention to a deep-water terminal for
! the road. They needed the deep
j water terminal to handle the Asiatic
trade they anticipated.
At first Stanford dccided to make
Goat Island the terminal; papers
were filed with the Secretary of
State on March 21, 1867. But in
I 1869 the Suez Canal was opened to
: traffic, and the expected Asiatic
J traffic did not materialize.
UNION PACIFIC ROLLS
Meanwhile the Union Pacific was
making rapid progress in its con
struction since it did not have to
overcome serious physical obstacles.
The thrilling story of the racc
during the years 1808 and 1809 be
tween the Union Pacific building
westward and the Central Pacific
building eastward has often been
\ told. Each company wished to con
trol the maximum of mileage, and
the Central Pacific particularly
needed to build far enough east to
get the Salt Lake business.
To expedite construction Stanford
I journeyed to Salt Lake five times
before the last spike was finally
driven.
In June 1868 Stanford charmed
Brigham Young, president of the
! Mormon Church, into working for
the Central Pacific—although Young
! had a prior contract with the Union
Pacific.
MORMON HEAL) WON OVER
At that time the Union Pacific and
| the Central Pacific—both working
j ahead of their lines—had surveyed
i different routes. Until Stanford
j talked with Young, the Mormon
j president had been in favor of the
j UP's southern route. Stanford con
! vinccd him of the benefits of the
I northern route.

In October. 1868. the CPRR filed
with the Secretary of the Interior
of the United States a map and pro
file of its proposed line from '"Mon
umental Point" (north end of Salt
Lake) to Echo Summit, head of j
Echo Canyon, and on Oct. 28 that j
official approved formally the route !
thus laid down. Stanford seems to j
have proceeded on the theory that I
the railroad must follow the ap- j
proved line and that by securing
the right of way over it he could
head off the Union Pacific.
Stanford defended the line stout
ly. Yet so powerful was the influ
ence of the Union Pacific lobby at
Washington that after some corre
spondence with Oliver Ames, pres
ident of the Union Pacific, the Sec
retary of the interior reversed his
decision.
SPECIAL COMMISSION
A special commission was ap
pointed to proceed to the front and
make an impartial report. The
members were instructed that the
law called for a railroad from Oma
ha to Sacramento upon the most
direct, central, and practicable
route, and they were to determine
the most advantageous route.
The question of the terminus was
finally settled by Congress on April
10. 1869, with a joint resolution to
the effect that "the common ter
minal of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads shall be at or
near Ogden; and the UPRR Co.
shall build, and the CPRR Co. shall
pay for and own. the railroad from
the terminus aforesaid to Promon
tory Summit, at which point the
rails shall meet and connect and
form one continuous line."
In the final settlement the Cen
tral Pacific leased from the Union
Pacific five miles of track from Og
den westward, and purchased out
right the remaining 56 miles to
Promontory.
After some remarkable feats of
track laying, climaxed by the laying

negotiations to purchase the South
j ern Pacific Railroad.
j SOUTHERN i ACIFIC
The Southern Pacific had been
formed in 1865 to build a railroad
j from "some port in (he Bay of San
I Francisco through the counties of
Santa Clara, Monterey. San Luis
• Obispo, Tulare, Los Angeles, and
i San Diego, to the town of San
j Diego, thence eastward through the
county of San Diego to the eastern
I line of the state of California, there
I lo connect with a contemplated rail
; load from said eastern line of Cali
j fornia to the Mississippi River."

In August, 1868, the newspapers i
announced the Southern Pacific's j
plans for construction south from
San Jose through Gilroy and on the J
route outlined to Los Angeles. The >
announcement may have been made
in good faith—or is may have been
made to bluff Stanlord.
Nevertheless the Act of Congress j
providing for the construction of the j
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad recog- i
nized the SPRR as the western link,
of that line.
It was a foregone conclusion that
the owners of the Central Pacific
would not calmly witness the inva- j
sion of their territory by a compet
ing line without doing something. J
Furthermore, the Southern Pacific I
had on Feb. 4, 1868, entered into a !
contract for the purchase of the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad—
"The butt end of all railroads com
ing directly into San Francisco."
A RAILROAD ON PAPER
This road, which later proved to
possess such enormous potentiali- i
ties, existed chiefly on paper when j
I acquired by the associates. Its j
original owners and organizers had i
been in control for four years but i
during all that time had not got a j
single mile of road into operation, i
According to a report of the |
Southern Pacific for 1869, the com
pany possessed no engine houses, j
shops, engines, or cars. It did, how- |
ever, have a franchise to build to j
an eastern connection on the Colo- |
! rado River, a land grant from the i
I federal government, a contract for j
' the purchase of the San Francisco i
and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
tween San Jose and Gilroy.
During the autumn of 1873 the
| general offices of the CPRR were
j moved to the corner of Fourth and
| Townsend streets in San Francisco.
A RAILROAD GIANT
A line was built in 1872-74 from
j Sacramento to Bakersfield through
the San Joaquin Valley. Another
line extended to Oregon. In 1883
the Sunset Route was opened to
! New Orleans.
Until 1880 the Southern Pacific
! Lines had been leased to and oper
ated by the Central Pacific. During
the anti-railroad legislation of 1885.
j the situation was reversed, and the
I Central Pacific was leased to the
J Southern Pacific. Stanford's first
| transcontinental railroad had grown
| into a giant.

(This is tlie fourth ami last ar
; title in a series concerning Stan
ford's greatest achievement — the
building of tin* first transconti
nental railroad.)
Long, arduous work had push
ed the railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains. The Sum
mit Tunnel had been completed
and snow sheds built. The Cen
tral Pacific was now ready for
the final dash across Nevada
and Utah to meet the Union Pa
cific coming west.
Money was still needed, how
ever. The government bonds did
not come through rapidly enough to
pay the tremendous cost of railroad
construction. Stanford was still
pledging his personal credit in 18G7.
To borrow money for the railroad
i he arranged for loans from London
j bankers.
Until 1837 Stanford and his asso
ciates had been so absorbed in fi
nancial and engineering problems
of the road that they gave no at
j tention to a deep-water terminal for
! the road. They needed the deep
j water terminal to handle the Asiatic
trade they anticipated.
At first Stanford dccided to make
Goat Island the terminal; papers
were filed with the Secretary of
State on March 21, 1867. But in
I 1869 the Suez Canal was opened to
: traffic, and the expected Asiatic
J traffic did not materialize.
UNION PACIFIC ROLLS
Meanwhile the Union Pacific was
making rapid progress in its con
struction since it did not have to
overcome serious physical obstacles.
The thrilling story of the racc
during the years 1808 and 1809 be
tween the Union Pacific building
westward and the Central Pacific
building eastward has often been
\ told. Each company wished to con
trol the maximum of mileage, and
the Central Pacific particularly
needed to build far enough east to
get the Salt Lake business.
To expedite construction Stanford
I journeyed to Salt Lake five times
before the last spike was finally
driven.
In June 1868 Stanford charmed
Brigham Young, president of the
! Mormon Church, into working for
the Central Pacific—although Young
! had a prior contract with the Union
Pacific.
MORMON HEAL) WON OVER
At that time the Union Pacific and
| the Central Pacific—both working
j ahead of their lines—had surveyed
i different routes. Until Stanford
j talked with Young, the Mormon
j president had been in favor of the
j UP's southern route. Stanford con
! vinccd him of the benefits of the
I northern route.

In October. 1868. the CPRR filed
with the Secretary of the Interior
of the United States a map and pro
file of its proposed line from '"Mon
umental Point" (north end of Salt
Lake) to Echo Summit, head of j
Echo Canyon, and on Oct. 28 that j
official approved formally the route !
thus laid down. Stanford seems to j
have proceeded on the theory that I
the railroad must follow the ap- j
proved line and that by securing
the right of way over it he could
head off the Union Pacific.
Stanford defended the line stout
ly. Yet so powerful was the influ
ence of the Union Pacific lobby at
Washington that after some corre
spondence with Oliver Ames, pres
ident of the Union Pacific, the Sec
retary of the interior reversed his
decision.
SPECIAL COMMISSION
A special commission was ap
pointed to proceed to the front and
make an impartial report. The
members were instructed that the
law called for a railroad from Oma
ha to Sacramento upon the most
direct, central, and practicable
route, and they were to determine
the most advantageous route.
The question of the terminus was
finally settled by Congress on April
10. 1869, with a joint resolution to
the effect that "the common ter
minal of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads shall be at or
near Ogden; and the UPRR Co.
shall build, and the CPRR Co. shall
pay for and own. the railroad from
the terminus aforesaid to Promon
tory Summit, at which point the
rails shall meet and connect and
form one continuous line."
In the final settlement the Cen
tral Pacific leased from the Union
Pacific five miles of track from Og
den westward, and purchased out
right the remaining 56 miles to
Promontory.
After some remarkable feats of
track laying, climaxed by the laying
down of 10miles of track in one
day between sunrise and sunset by
the Central Pacific forces, the lines
were brought together and a junc
tion made on May 10. 1869.
THE LAST SPIKE
The joining of the rails from the
East with those from the West, was
of great political as well as commer
cial significance. The Coast states
were now an integral part of the
Union. The specter of a Pacific re
public was banished forever. A
realization of the importance of the
event prompted the celebration of
the driving of the last spike with fit
ting ceremonies.
On May 9. 1869, Stanford took a
silver sledge-hammer presented by
the Union Express Co. and drove
the spikes presented by California
and Nevada. Dr. Harkness present
ed on behalf of David Hewes of
Sacramento a gold spike. Nevada
offered a silver spike. Governor
Safford of Arizona presented gold,
silver, and iron spikes. (The spikes
and hammer are preserved in the
Stanford Museum.)
The procession celebrating the oc
casion in Sacramento was so long it
took over an hour to pass a given

point. Special trains poured in from
Vallejo, Stockton, Reno, and Vir
ginia Citv.
CONSOLIDATION
Purchase of other lines which led
to the ultimate consolidation of all
railroads under the Southern Pa
cific Lines began in 1865. Stanford
bought the Sacramento Valley Rail
j road, more to get an annoying
I neighbor out of the way than as an
' expansion project.
Final settlement for the Yuba
| Railroad was made on Oct. 21, 18139.
About that time the Western Pa
cific Railroad was also acquired.
Organized in 18(32, the Western Pa
-1 cific was assigned the right to build
under the Pacific Railroad Bill and
I with government subsidies a rail
road from San Francisco to Sacra
mento, by way of San Jose and
Stockton, to connect with the CPRR.
The name Western Pacific was
di'oppcd in 1870 when the road was
consolidated with the Central Pa
cific. The present Western Pacific
is a distinct organization of a much
later date. Finally Stanford started

and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
tween San Jose and Gilroy.
During the autumn of 1873 the
| general offices of the CPRR were
j moved to the corner of Fourth and
| Townsend streets in San Francisco.
A RAILROAD GIANT
A line was built in 1872-74 from
j Sacramento to Bakersfield through
the San Joaquin Valley. Another
line extended to Oregon. In 1883
the Sunset Route was opened to
! New Orleans.
Until 1880 the Southern Pacific
! Lines had been leased to and oper
ated by the Central Pacific. During
the anti-railroad legislation of 1885.
j the situation was reversed, and the
I Central Pacific was leased to the
J Southern Pacific. Stanford's first
| transcontinental railroad had grown
| into a giant.

ford's greatest achievement — the
building of tin* first transconti
nental railroad.)
Long, arduous work had push
ed the railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains. The Sum
mit Tunnel had been completed
and snow sheds built. The Cen
tral Pacific was now ready for
the final dash across Nevada
and Utah to meet the Union Pa
cific coming west.
Money was still needed, how
ever. The government bonds did
not come through rapidly enough to
pay the tremendous cost of railroad
construction. Stanford was still
pledging his personal credit in 18G7.
To borrow money for the railroad
i he arranged for loans from London
j bankers.
Until 1837 Stanford and his asso
ciates had been so absorbed in fi
nancial and engineering problems
of the road that they gave no at
j tention to a deep-water terminal for
! the road. They needed the deep
j water terminal to handle the Asiatic
trade they anticipated.
At first Stanford dccided to make
Goat Island the terminal; papers
were filed with the Secretary of
State on March 21, 1867. But in
I 1869 the Suez Canal was opened to
: traffic, and the expected Asiatic
J traffic did not materialize.
UNION PACIFIC ROLLS
Meanwhile the Union Pacific was
making rapid progress in its con
struction since it did not have to
overcome serious physical obstacles.
The thrilling story of the racc
during the years 1808 and 1809 be
tween the Union Pacific building
westward and the Central Pacific
building eastward has often been
\ told. Each company wished to con
trol the maximum of mileage, and
the Central Pacific particularly
needed to build far enough east to
get the Salt Lake business.
To expedite construction Stanford
I journeyed to Salt Lake five times
before the last spike was finally
driven.
In June 1868 Stanford charmed
Brigham Young, president of the
! Mormon Church, into working for
the Central Pacific—although Young
! had a prior contract with the Union
Pacific.
MORMON HEAL) WON OVER
At that time the Union Pacific and
| the Central Pacific—both working
j ahead of their lines—had surveyed
i different routes. Until Stanford
j talked with Young, the Mormon
j president had been in favor of the
j UP's southern route. Stanford con
! vinccd him of the benefits of the
I northern route.

In October. 1868. the CPRR filed
with the Secretary of the Interior
of the United States a map and pro
file of its proposed line from '"Mon
umental Point" (north end of Salt
Lake) to Echo Summit, head of j
Echo Canyon, and on Oct. 28 that j
official approved formally the route !
thus laid down. Stanford seems to j
have proceeded on the theory that I
the railroad must follow the ap- j
proved line and that by securing
the right of way over it he could
head off the Union Pacific.
Stanford defended the line stout
ly. Yet so powerful was the influ
ence of the Union Pacific lobby at
Washington that after some corre
spondence with Oliver Ames, pres
ident of the Union Pacific, the Sec
retary of the interior reversed his
decision.
SPECIAL COMMISSION
A special commission was ap
pointed to proceed to the front and
make an impartial report. The
members were instructed that the
law called for a railroad from Oma
ha to Sacramento upon the most
direct, central, and practicable
route, and they were to determine
the most advantageous route.
The question of the terminus was
finally settled by Congress on April
10. 1869, with a joint resolution to
the effect that "the common ter
minal of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads shall be at or
near Ogden; and the UPRR Co.
shall build, and the CPRR Co. shall
pay for and own. the railroad from
the terminus aforesaid to Promon
tory Summit, at which point the
rails shall meet and connect and
form one continuous line."
In the final settlement the Cen
tral Pacific leased from the Union
Pacific five miles of track from Og
den westward, and purchased out
right the remaining 56 miles to
Promontory.
After some remarkable feats of
track laying, climaxed by the laying
down of 10miles of track in one
day between sunrise and sunset by
the Central Pacific forces, the lines
were brought together and a junc
tion made on May 10. 1869.
THE LAST SPIKE
The joining of the rails from the
East with those from the West, was
of great political as well as commer
cial significance. The Coast states
were now an integral part of the
Union. The specter of a Pacific re
public was banished forever. A
realization of the importance of the
event prompted the celebration of
the driving of the last spike with fit
ting ceremonies.
On May 9. 1869, Stanford took a
silver sledge-hammer presented by
the Union Express Co. and drove
the spikes presented by California
and Nevada. Dr. Harkness present
ed on behalf of David Hewes of
Sacramento a gold spike. Nevada
offered a silver spike. Governor
Safford of Arizona presented gold,
silver, and iron spikes. (The spikes
and hammer are preserved in the
Stanford Museum.)
The procession celebrating the oc
casion in Sacramento was so long it
took over an hour to pass a given

point. Special trains poured in from
Vallejo, Stockton, Reno, and Vir
ginia Citv.
CONSOLIDATION
Purchase of other lines which led
to the ultimate consolidation of all
railroads under the Southern Pa
cific Lines began in 1865. Stanford
bought the Sacramento Valley Rail
j road, more to get an annoying
I neighbor out of the way than as an
' expansion project.
Final settlement for the Yuba
| Railroad was made on Oct. 21, 18139.
About that time the Western Pa
cific Railroad was also acquired.
Organized in 18(32, the Western Pa
-1 cific was assigned the right to build
under the Pacific Railroad Bill and
I with government subsidies a rail
road from San Francisco to Sacra
mento, by way of San Jose and
Stockton, to connect with the CPRR.
The name Western Pacific was
di'oppcd in 1870 when the road was
consolidated with the Central Pa
cific. The present Western Pacific
is a distinct organization of a much
later date. Finally Stanford started
negotiations to purchase the South
j ern Pacific Railroad.
j SOUTHERN i ACIFIC
The Southern Pacific had been
formed in 1865 to build a railroad
j from "some port in (he Bay of San
I Francisco through the counties of
Santa Clara, Monterey. San Luis
• Obispo, Tulare, Los Angeles, and
i San Diego, to the town of San
j Diego, thence eastward through the
county of San Diego to the eastern
I line of the state of California, there
I lo connect with a contemplated rail
; load from said eastern line of Cali
j fornia to the Mississippi River."

In August, 1868, the newspapers i
announced the Southern Pacific's j
plans for construction south from
San Jose through Gilroy and on the J
route outlined to Los Angeles. The >
announcement may have been made
in good faith—or is may have been
made to bluff Stanlord.
Nevertheless the Act of Congress j
providing for the construction of the j
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad recog- i
nized the SPRR as the western link,
of that line.
It was a foregone conclusion that
the owners of the Central Pacific
would not calmly witness the inva- j
sion of their territory by a compet
ing line without doing something. J
Furthermore, the Southern Pacific I
had on Feb. 4, 1868, entered into a !
contract for the purchase of the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad—
"The butt end of all railroads com
ing directly into San Francisco."
A RAILROAD ON PAPER
This road, which later proved to
possess such enormous potentiali- i
ties, existed chiefly on paper when j
I acquired by the associates. Its j
original owners and organizers had i
been in control for four years but i
during all that time had not got a j
single mile of road into operation, i
According to a report of the |
Southern Pacific for 1869, the com
pany possessed no engine houses, j
shops, engines, or cars. It did, how- |
ever, have a franchise to build to j
an eastern connection on the Colo- |
! rado River, a land grant from the i
I federal government, a contract for j
' the purchase of the San Francisco i
and San Jose Railroad, and enor- i
mous possibilities. Thirty miles of j
j road were under construction be
