# Farm Cagers Return to Cow Palace
## 
### BILL ALLEN JACK CASHEL 
Returning to the Cow Palace,
scene of their vacation time suc
cesses, Stanford's cagers meet
two stong independent teams in
doubleheaders there this week
end.
Tonight the Indians take on St.
Mary's in the afterpiece of the twin
bill, with California and Santa Clara

tangling in the opener. The teams reverse order to
morrow night, the Cards playing the Broncos early
and the Bears and Gaels battling it out in the second
tilt.
First game begins at 8 o'clock both nights.
It will be a Stanford squad somewhat different
1 rom the one Cow Palace fans are used to, which
will take the floor tonight. Injuries and illness
have forced Coach Everett Dean to juggle his start
ing lineup.
HIGGINS AND ROSE AT FORWARD SPOTS
Opening at forwards for the Indians will probably
be Captain Babe Higgins and Bill Rose. Rose, how
ever, will not be able to go a full game. He was sick
in the early part of the week and only practiced
yesterday and Wednesday.
Milt Iverson will be called upon to spell the tall
forward who scored 23 points against Oregon State
on the South San Francisco Court.
Definitely, out of tonight's game at least are for
ward* Moiley Thompson and George lardley, both
of whom have been afflicted with colds this week.
The dependable Steve Stephenson, only first
stringer to stay healthy all year, will start at center.
At the guards it will be Dave Davidson and Bob
Lewis, defensive hero-in-defeat of last week's Cal
series.
DAVIDSON AND HIGGINS NOT UP TO PAR
Davidson, who saw very limited action against

Cal, and Higgins, who played almost all of both games
with a bum leg, are .not quite up to par yet, and such
reserves as Gus Chavalas, Jack Scharfen, and Bob Penn
are scheduled to get in a lot of playing time.
The few comparative scores against common opponents
which are available make Stanford look like an underdog
in both games. Sanla Clara split even with UCLA in
two games. Stanford lost its only game to the Bruins.
The Broncos whipped Fresno State by 21 points, the
Indians by only five. And Santa Clara was taken into
camp, 47 to 32, by St. Mary's.

However, comparative scores are
an even more worthless guide for
basketball games than they are fox
football. They simply show that nei
ther the Gaels nor the Broncs are
a bunch of clowns.
But Stanford played a brand of

ball last weekend which would have
resulted in wins against most teams. An important draw
ing point of the games is the chance for fans to see most
of the Bay Region's and many of the coast's outstanding
ball players on the same court the same night.
Hanger, Wolfe, Kudelka, Laney, Stephenson, and Higgins
will all be in action.
CAPACITY CROWD EXPECTED
The fans apparently appreciate this because pre-game
ticket sales have given Cow Palace basketball promoter
Frank Walsh reason to hope that the 12,500 person capac
ity of the pavilion will be taxed.
For those who didn't have a chance to see any of the
Christmas-time games, we can say that every seat in
the Cow Palace is a good one. No pillars or other ob
structions, and the backboards are glass.
If the management solves the heating problem, the
livestock pavilion will be an almost perfect spot to play
and to watch basketball.
While Stanford and Cal are playing in the Cow Palace,
their southern division compatriot, UCLA, will be playing
the Sacramento Senators of the American Basketball
League in Sacramento tomorrow night. Southern Cal is
idle for the next two weeks.

Basketball followers will not
only view possibly the two
strongest independent teams
from this area tonight and to
morrow in action against Stan
ford at the Cow Palace, but will
also be able to glimpse most
heralded and high - scoring local
forward of recent times.
Ol course these references con
cern St. Mary's and Santa Clara,
and the Gaels' All-American can
didate Frank Kudelka.
On Kudelka's shoulders rests the
bulk of the Gaels' chances of win
ning tonight against the Indians.
When the dark-haired sharpshooter
is hot, there is no telling whom they
might knock over.
But when he's cold, which is very,
very seldom, most of the Gaels'
] chances of winning go trotting right
I off the playing floor.
APPLES MAS 20:{ POINTS
Kudelka's scoring spree this sea-
I son is one of the best in many years.
In 11 games for St. Mary's this year,
he's scored 203 points, for a tidy 18-
plus point average.
Added to Kudelka as the second
j best scorer for the Gaels is forward
Jack Rial. To show how potent this
twosome can become, in the Saints'
j game with Santa Clara, Rial and
j Kudelka scored 'M points between
| them, of the Gaels' 47-point total.
St. Mary's won from the Broncos,
! incidentally, 47-152.
Tomorrow night, Stanford meets
I Santa Clara, a team which depends
I as much upon a big talented center
j as St. Mary's depends on Kudelka.
LANEY IS BRONC STAR
When Frank Layney, the veteran
I Bronco center, is in good health,
j Coach Ray Pesco's men are hard to
beat. And he'll be in good health
! this weekend, having just recently
recovered from an ankle injury
which has sidelined him most of
the time since the Broncos returned
from their Eastern trip.
When St. Mary's defeated Santa
j Clara 12 days ago, Laynie saw no
; action, and the Gaels took advan
-1 tage of his substitute Bob Suther

| land time and again for driving lay- i
ups to coast to their 15-point win. j
The Santa Clara seasoanl record
I stands at won 9. lost G, but these
I statistics belie the truth.
BRONCS SPLIT WITH UCLA
For numbered among the Bronc
wins are victories over powerful
Georgetown, the Sacramento Sena
tors, and UCLA. The Broncos split
with the Bruins in two early-season
games, dropping the first 47-42, but
winning the second 55-50.
Backing up Layney in the scor
ing department for the Broncos is
| forward Bob McKiilop, who has
scored 159 points in 15 games.
Starting for Santa Clara at one of
the guard positions will be Joe
Greenbach. former Sequoia High
star, and last year teammate on the
Menlo JC five with Bill Rose.


Forward MILT IVERSON is
slated for a good deal of action
as (he Indians tackle St. Mary's
and Santa Clara in the Cow I'a
lace this weekend.


Although he has been sidelined
much of this week with the flu,
BILL ROSE will start at forward
tonight against St. Mary's.

But when he's cold, which is very,
very seldom, most of the Gaels'
] chances of winning go trotting right
I off the playing floor.
APPLES MAS 20:{ POINTS
Kudelka's scoring spree this sea-
I son is one of the best in many years.
In 11 games for St. Mary's this year,
he's scored 203 points, for a tidy 18-
plus point average.
Added to Kudelka as the second
j best scorer for the Gaels is forward
Jack Rial. To show how potent this
twosome can become, in the Saints'
j game with Santa Clara, Rial and
j Kudelka scored 'M points between
| them, of the Gaels' 47-point total.
St. Mary's won from the Broncos,
! incidentally, 47-152.
Tomorrow night, Stanford meets
I Santa Clara, a team which depends
I as much upon a big talented center
j as St. Mary's depends on Kudelka.
LANEY IS BRONC STAR
When Frank Layney, the veteran
I Bronco center, is in good health,
j Coach Ray Pesco's men are hard to
beat. And he'll be in good health
! this weekend, having just recently
recovered from an ankle injury
which has sidelined him most of
the time since the Broncos returned
from their Eastern trip.
When St. Mary's defeated Santa
j Clara 12 days ago, Laynie saw no
; action, and the Gaels took advan
-1 tage of his substitute Bob Suther

| land time and again for driving lay- i
ups to coast to their 15-point win. j
The Santa Clara seasoanl record
I stands at won 9. lost G, but these
I statistics belie the truth.
BRONCS SPLIT WITH UCLA
For numbered among the Bronc
wins are victories over powerful
Georgetown, the Sacramento Sena
tors, and UCLA. The Broncos split
with the Bruins in two early-season
games, dropping the first 47-42, but
winning the second 55-50.
Backing up Layney in the scor
ing department for the Broncos is
| forward Bob McKiilop, who has
scored 159 points in 15 games.
Starting for Santa Clara at one of
the guard positions will be Joe
Greenbach. former Sequoia High
star, and last year teammate on the
Menlo JC five with Bill Rose.


Forward MILT IVERSON is
slated for a good deal of action
as (he Indians tackle St. Mary's
and Santa Clara in the Cow I'a
lace this weekend.


Although he has been sidelined
much of this week with the flu,
BILL ROSE will start at forward
tonight against St. Mary's.
Returning to the Cow Palace,
scene of their vacation time suc
cesses, Stanford's cagers meet
two stong independent teams in
doubleheaders there this week
end.
Tonight the Indians take on St.
Mary's in the afterpiece of the twin
bill, with California and Santa Clara

tangling in the opener. The teams reverse order to
morrow night, the Cards playing the Broncos early
and the Bears and Gaels battling it out in the second
tilt.
First game begins at 8 o'clock both nights.
It will be a Stanford squad somewhat different
1 rom the one Cow Palace fans are used to, which
will take the floor tonight. Injuries and illness
have forced Coach Everett Dean to juggle his start
ing lineup.
HIGGINS AND ROSE AT FORWARD SPOTS
Opening at forwards for the Indians will probably
be Captain Babe Higgins and Bill Rose. Rose, how
ever, will not be able to go a full game. He was sick
in the early part of the week and only practiced
yesterday and Wednesday.
Milt Iverson will be called upon to spell the tall
forward who scored 23 points against Oregon State
on the South San Francisco Court.
Definitely, out of tonight's game at least are for
ward* Moiley Thompson and George lardley, both
of whom have been afflicted with colds this week.
The dependable Steve Stephenson, only first
stringer to stay healthy all year, will start at center.
At the guards it will be Dave Davidson and Bob
Lewis, defensive hero-in-defeat of last week's Cal
series.
DAVIDSON AND HIGGINS NOT UP TO PAR
Davidson, who saw very limited action against

Cal, and Higgins, who played almost all of both games
with a bum leg, are .not quite up to par yet, and such
reserves as Gus Chavalas, Jack Scharfen, and Bob Penn
are scheduled to get in a lot of playing time.
The few comparative scores against common opponents
which are available make Stanford look like an underdog
in both games. Sanla Clara split even with UCLA in
two games. Stanford lost its only game to the Bruins.
The Broncos whipped Fresno State by 21 points, the
Indians by only five. And Santa Clara was taken into
camp, 47 to 32, by St. Mary's.

However, comparative scores are
an even more worthless guide for
basketball games than they are fox
football. They simply show that nei
ther the Gaels nor the Broncs are
a bunch of clowns.
But Stanford played a brand of

ball last weekend which would have
resulted in wins against most teams. An important draw
ing point of the games is the chance for fans to see most
of the Bay Region's and many of the coast's outstanding
ball players on the same court the same night.
Hanger, Wolfe, Kudelka, Laney, Stephenson, and Higgins
will all be in action.
CAPACITY CROWD EXPECTED
The fans apparently appreciate this because pre-game
ticket sales have given Cow Palace basketball promoter
Frank Walsh reason to hope that the 12,500 person capac
ity of the pavilion will be taxed.
For those who didn't have a chance to see any of the
Christmas-time games, we can say that every seat in
the Cow Palace is a good one. No pillars or other ob
structions, and the backboards are glass.
If the management solves the heating problem, the
livestock pavilion will be an almost perfect spot to play
and to watch basketball.
While Stanford and Cal are playing in the Cow Palace,
their southern division compatriot, UCLA, will be playing
the Sacramento Senators of the American Basketball
League in Sacramento tomorrow night. Southern Cal is
idle for the next two weeks.

Basketball followers will not
only view possibly the two
strongest independent teams
from this area tonight and to
morrow in action against Stan
ford at the Cow Palace, but will
also be able to glimpse most
heralded and high - scoring local
forward of recent times.
Ol course these references con
cern St. Mary's and Santa Clara,
and the Gaels' All-American can
didate Frank Kudelka.
On Kudelka's shoulders rests the
bulk of the Gaels' chances of win
ning tonight against the Indians.
When the dark-haired sharpshooter
is hot, there is no telling whom they
might knock over.
But when he's cold, which is very,

Lewis, defensive hero-in-defeat of last week's Cal
series.
DAVIDSON AND HIGGINS NOT UP TO PAR
Davidson, who saw very limited action against

Cal, and Higgins, who played almost all of both games
with a bum leg, are .not quite up to par yet, and such
reserves as Gus Chavalas, Jack Scharfen, and Bob Penn
are scheduled to get in a lot of playing time.
The few comparative scores against common opponents
which are available make Stanford look like an underdog
in both games. Sanla Clara split even with UCLA in
two games. Stanford lost its only game to the Bruins.
The Broncos whipped Fresno State by 21 points, the
Indians by only five. And Santa Clara was taken into
camp, 47 to 32, by St. Mary's.

However, comparative scores are
an even more worthless guide for
basketball games than they are fox
football. They simply show that nei
ther the Gaels nor the Broncs are
a bunch of clowns.
But Stanford played a brand of

ball last weekend which would have
resulted in wins against most teams. An important draw
ing point of the games is the chance for fans to see most
of the Bay Region's and many of the coast's outstanding
ball players on the same court the same night.
Hanger, Wolfe, Kudelka, Laney, Stephenson, and Higgins
will all be in action.
CAPACITY CROWD EXPECTED
The fans apparently appreciate this because pre-game
ticket sales have given Cow Palace basketball promoter
Frank Walsh reason to hope that the 12,500 person capac
ity of the pavilion will be taxed.
For those who didn't have a chance to see any of the
Christmas-time games, we can say that every seat in
the Cow Palace is a good one. No pillars or other ob
structions, and the backboards are glass.
If the management solves the heating problem, the
livestock pavilion will be an almost perfect spot to play
and to watch basketball.
While Stanford and Cal are playing in the Cow Palace,
their southern division compatriot, UCLA, will be playing
the Sacramento Senators of the American Basketball
League in Sacramento tomorrow night. Southern Cal is
idle for the next two weeks.

Basketball followers will not
only view possibly the two
strongest independent teams
from this area tonight and to
morrow in action against Stan
ford at the Cow Palace, but will
also be able to glimpse most
heralded and high - scoring local
forward of recent times.
Ol course these references con
cern St. Mary's and Santa Clara,
and the Gaels' All-American can
didate Frank Kudelka.
On Kudelka's shoulders rests the
bulk of the Gaels' chances of win
ning tonight against the Indians.
When the dark-haired sharpshooter
is hot, there is no telling whom they
might knock over.
But when he's cold, which is very,
very seldom, most of the Gaels'
] chances of winning go trotting right
I off the playing floor.
APPLES MAS 20:{ POINTS
Kudelka's scoring spree this sea-
I son is one of the best in many years.
In 11 games for St. Mary's this year,
he's scored 203 points, for a tidy 18-
plus point average.
Added to Kudelka as the second
j best scorer for the Gaels is forward
Jack Rial. To show how potent this
twosome can become, in the Saints'
j game with Santa Clara, Rial and
j Kudelka scored 'M points between
| them, of the Gaels' 47-point total.
St. Mary's won from the Broncos,
! incidentally, 47-152.
Tomorrow night, Stanford meets
I Santa Clara, a team which depends
I as much upon a big talented center
j as St. Mary's depends on Kudelka.
LANEY IS BRONC STAR
When Frank Layney, the veteran
I Bronco center, is in good health,
j Coach Ray Pesco's men are hard to
beat. And he'll be in good health
! this weekend, having just recently
recovered from an ankle injury
which has sidelined him most of
the time since the Broncos returned
from their Eastern trip.
When St. Mary's defeated Santa
j Clara 12 days ago, Laynie saw no
; action, and the Gaels took advan
-1 tage of his substitute Bob Suther

| land time and again for driving lay- i
ups to coast to their 15-point win. j
The Santa Clara seasoanl record
I stands at won 9. lost G, but these
I statistics belie the truth.
BRONCS SPLIT WITH UCLA
For numbered among the Bronc
wins are victories over powerful
Georgetown, the Sacramento Sena
tors, and UCLA. The Broncos split
with the Bruins in two early-season
games, dropping the first 47-42, but
winning the second 55-50.
Backing up Layney in the scor
ing department for the Broncos is
| forward Bob McKiilop, who has
scored 159 points in 15 games.
Starting for Santa Clara at one of
the guard positions will be Joe
Greenbach. former Sequoia High
star, and last year teammate on the
Menlo JC five with Bill Rose.


Forward MILT IVERSON is
slated for a good deal of action
as (he Indians tackle St. Mary's
and Santa Clara in the Cow I'a
lace this weekend.


Although he has been sidelined
much of this week with the flu,
BILL ROSE will start at forward
tonight against St. Mary's.
Returning to the Cow Palace,
scene of their vacation time suc
cesses, Stanford's cagers meet
two stong independent teams in
doubleheaders there this week
end.
Tonight the Indians take on St.
Mary's in the afterpiece of the twin
bill, with California and Santa Clara

tangling in the opener. The teams reverse order to
morrow night, the Cards playing the Broncos early
and the Bears and Gaels battling it out in the second
tilt.
First game begins at 8 o'clock both nights.
It will be a Stanford squad somewhat different
1 rom the one Cow Palace fans are used to, which
will take the floor tonight. Injuries and illness
have forced Coach Everett Dean to juggle his start
ing lineup.
HIGGINS AND ROSE AT FORWARD SPOTS
Opening at forwards for the Indians will probably
be Captain Babe Higgins and Bill Rose. Rose, how
ever, will not be able to go a full game. He was sick
in the early part of the week and only practiced
yesterday and Wednesday.
Milt Iverson will be called upon to spell the tall
forward who scored 23 points against Oregon State
on the South San Francisco Court.
Definitely, out of tonight's game at least are for
ward* Moiley Thompson and George lardley, both
of whom have been afflicted with colds this week.
The dependable Steve Stephenson, only first
stringer to stay healthy all year, will start at center.
At the guards it will be Dave Davidson and Bob
Lewis, defensive hero-in-defeat of last week's Cal
series.

j Clara 12 days ago, Laynie saw no
; action, and the Gaels took advan
-1 tage of his substitute Bob Suther

| land time and again for driving lay- i
ups to coast to their 15-point win. j
The Santa Clara seasoanl record
I stands at won 9. lost G, but these
I statistics belie the truth.
BRONCS SPLIT WITH UCLA
For numbered among the Bronc
wins are victories over powerful
Georgetown, the Sacramento Sena
tors, and UCLA. The Broncos split
with the Bruins in two early-season
games, dropping the first 47-42, but
winning the second 55-50.
Backing up Layney in the scor
ing department for the Broncos is
| forward Bob McKiilop, who has
scored 159 points in 15 games.
Starting for Santa Clara at one of
the guard positions will be Joe
Greenbach. former Sequoia High
star, and last year teammate on the
Menlo JC five with Bill Rose.


Forward MILT IVERSON is
slated for a good deal of action
as (he Indians tackle St. Mary's
and Santa Clara in the Cow I'a
lace this weekend.


Although he has been sidelined
much of this week with the flu,
BILL ROSE will start at forward
tonight against St. Mary's.
Returning to the Cow Palace,
scene of their vacation time suc
cesses, Stanford's cagers meet
two stong independent teams in
doubleheaders there this week
end.
Tonight the Indians take on St.
Mary's in the afterpiece of the twin
bill, with California and Santa Clara

tangling in the opener. The teams reverse order to
morrow night, the Cards playing the Broncos early
and the Bears and Gaels battling it out in the second
tilt.
First game begins at 8 o'clock both nights.
It will be a Stanford squad somewhat different
1 rom the one Cow Palace fans are used to, which
will take the floor tonight. Injuries and illness
have forced Coach Everett Dean to juggle his start
ing lineup.
HIGGINS AND ROSE AT FORWARD SPOTS
Opening at forwards for the Indians will probably
be Captain Babe Higgins and Bill Rose. Rose, how
ever, will not be able to go a full game. He was sick
in the early part of the week and only practiced
yesterday and Wednesday.
Milt Iverson will be called upon to spell the tall
forward who scored 23 points against Oregon State
on the South San Francisco Court.
Definitely, out of tonight's game at least are for
ward* Moiley Thompson and George lardley, both
of whom have been afflicted with colds this week.
The dependable Steve Stephenson, only first
stringer to stay healthy all year, will start at center.
At the guards it will be Dave Davidson and Bob
Lewis, defensive hero-in-defeat of last week's Cal
series.
DAVIDSON AND HIGGINS NOT UP TO PAR
Davidson, who saw very limited action against

Cal, and Higgins, who played almost all of both games
with a bum leg, are .not quite up to par yet, and such
reserves as Gus Chavalas, Jack Scharfen, and Bob Penn
are scheduled to get in a lot of playing time.
The few comparative scores against common opponents
which are available make Stanford look like an underdog
in both games. Sanla Clara split even with UCLA in
two games. Stanford lost its only game to the Bruins.
The Broncos whipped Fresno State by 21 points, the
Indians by only five. And Santa Clara was taken into
camp, 47 to 32, by St. Mary's.

However, comparative scores are
an even more worthless guide for
basketball games than they are fox
football. They simply show that nei
ther the Gaels nor the Broncs are
a bunch of clowns.
But Stanford played a brand of

ball last weekend which would have
resulted in wins against most teams. An important draw
ing point of the games is the chance for fans to see most
of the Bay Region's and many of the coast's outstanding
ball players on the same court the same night.
Hanger, Wolfe, Kudelka, Laney, Stephenson, and Higgins
will all be in action.
CAPACITY CROWD EXPECTED
The fans apparently appreciate this because pre-game
ticket sales have given Cow Palace basketball promoter
Frank Walsh reason to hope that the 12,500 person capac
ity of the pavilion will be taxed.
For those who didn't have a chance to see any of the
Christmas-time games, we can say that every seat in
the Cow Palace is a good one. No pillars or other ob
structions, and the backboards are glass.
If the management solves the heating problem, the
livestock pavilion will be an almost perfect spot to play
and to watch basketball.
While Stanford and Cal are playing in the Cow Palace,
their southern division compatriot, UCLA, will be playing
the Sacramento Senators of the American Basketball
League in Sacramento tomorrow night. Southern Cal is
idle for the next two weeks.

Basketball followers will not
only view possibly the two
strongest independent teams
from this area tonight and to
morrow in action against Stan
ford at the Cow Palace, but will
also be able to glimpse most
heralded and high - scoring local
forward of recent times.
Ol course these references con
cern St. Mary's and Santa Clara,
and the Gaels' All-American can
didate Frank Kudelka.
On Kudelka's shoulders rests the
bulk of the Gaels' chances of win
ning tonight against the Indians.
When the dark-haired sharpshooter
is hot, there is no telling whom they
might knock over.
But when he's cold, which is very,
very seldom, most of the Gaels'
] chances of winning go trotting right
I off the playing floor.
APPLES MAS 20:{ POINTS
Kudelka's scoring spree this sea-
I son is one of the best in many years.
In 11 games for St. Mary's this year,
he's scored 203 points, for a tidy 18-
plus point average.
Added to Kudelka as the second
j best scorer for the Gaels is forward
Jack Rial. To show how potent this
twosome can become, in the Saints'
j game with Santa Clara, Rial and
j Kudelka scored 'M points between
| them, of the Gaels' 47-point total.
St. Mary's won from the Broncos,
! incidentally, 47-152.
Tomorrow night, Stanford meets
I Santa Clara, a team which depends
I as much upon a big talented center
j as St. Mary's depends on Kudelka.
LANEY IS BRONC STAR
When Frank Layney, the veteran
I Bronco center, is in good health,
j Coach Ray Pesco's men are hard to
beat. And he'll be in good health
! this weekend, having just recently
recovered from an ankle injury
which has sidelined him most of
the time since the Broncos returned
from their Eastern trip.
When St. Mary's defeated Santa
j Clara 12 days ago, Laynie saw no
; action, and the Gaels took advan
-1 tage of his substitute Bob Suther

| land time and again for driving lay- i
ups to coast to their 15-point win. j
