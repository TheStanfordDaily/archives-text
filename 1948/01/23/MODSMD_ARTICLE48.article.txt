### 
New racing oars for the Stanford
crew are clue to arrive by train
early next week, according to the
Stanford Crew Association. George
Pocock has sent word from Seattle
that the oars have been loaded there
for the trip to Palo Alto.
The more than $500 needed to
purchase these sweeps was donated
last fall by several alumni who
made their contributions immedi
ately after newspaper reports of the
crew's dire need. The crew has been
using second-hand shells and oars.
Coach A. A. Clark, a former An
napolis oarsman, is head coach for
the crew. He has been assisted by
graduate students Mark Ancel and
Bill Merrill.
"Additional spare oars for the
beginners will soon be available
also," said student manager George
Benedict. In his work as manager
Benedict has learned to make a
good practice oar out of two broken
ones.
The arrival of the new oars will
make it possible for the whole 63-
man squad to "hit the water" at the
same time. At present each oars
man gets in only half a workout
each day.
