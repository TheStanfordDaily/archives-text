the second of a series sponsored by
Women's Vocational Committee.
Dr. Bush opened the meeting in
the Lower Lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse with a general discrip

ent time as seen from the vantage
point of the Sianford University Ap
pointment Service, of which he is
director. He said that in general em
ployment opportunities will be good.
CLERICAL SKILLS
Dr. Bush tried to impress his au
dience of the value of the clerical
skills of typing and shorthand as aids
in getting ahead on a job. He warned
the audience not to feel reluctant
about accepting positions on the

education they would advance rap
idly.
Four graduate women then pre

humorous accounts of the jobs they
held.
