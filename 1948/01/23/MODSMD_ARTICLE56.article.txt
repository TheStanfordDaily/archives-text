# Experienced Gymnasts Needed to Bolster Squad
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Coach Husky Hunt is looking for experienced gymnastics men
who can help Stanford's chances in the coming season. The first
I gym meet will be against the Olympic Club on Feb. 6, and the
team will need some quickly acquired depth to make a good
showing.
The few returning men on the squad insure Stanford of having

at least one capable performer in
most of the events, but the squad
lacks second-place and third-place |
strength. Also hurting the team is .
the loss of Paul Freeman who ex
celled in the high-bar, parallel-bar,
and side-horse events. It was Free
man who kept Stanford in the same
class with California last year.
Probable point makers in the op- |
ening Olympic Club battle will be i
Larry Ainsworlh on the rings, Bob
Dunham in the rope-climb, and Stu
art Elliot in tumbling. Dunham won
a first place in the '47 Cal meet, and j
I could be a regular winner again this
season.
Stuart Elliott is greatly improved
from last year, and he also figures
to be a good performer and steady [
point maker. However, Stanford does
not have another man who can get
additional tumbling points.
