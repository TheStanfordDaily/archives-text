The improvement in Steve Ste
phenson's floor play this year ear
be attributed in part to the I act thai
the big center is now wearing con
tact lenses while he plays.
He got the lenses at the end o'
last season and has been wearin;
them all this year.
"They really help, not so muel
for shots, but especially on pass
ing," Steve says.
The lenses can be worn for abou*
three hours at a stretch, loni
enough for practice sessions ani
games.
One of the first men to wear con
tact lenses was Tom Siebert, Stan
ford center of about 10 years aeo
They have since been adopted by
many athletes. —W. H. A.

One of the greatest basketbal'
players to wear the blue and gold
of the University of California was
Fran Watson. One of the better bas
ketball players on the Stanford
freshman team this year is Fran
Watson. Explanation: they are fa
ther and son.
The elder Fran romped the ma
ples for Cal in 1925. '2(5. and '27
lie made All-Coast in his last twc
years of play and was named team
captain in 1927. H also lettered
three years in baseball.
Fran Jr. attended Richmond High
School, a few miles up the Bay from
Berkeley, and most of the local cage
fans assumed he was bound lor Cal
But Fran the younger had othei
ideas and those ideas involved com
ing to Stanford. He thought, and
rightly so, that it he went to Cal
there would be those who would
think that any progress he made
playing there would be attributed
to his father's name.
"Anyway," he adds, "I like it
much better here." —J. B.

After a successful season with the
professional Washington Redskins
football team Fred Boensch has re
turned to the Farm to resume his
studies.
Cardinal fans will remember hi)'
Fred for his sterling line play in
the '4!) campaign, and his departure
into the pro ranks left a big vacancy
for Marchie Schwartz to fill. Fred
was All-Coast and honorable men
tion All-American. —J. P. H.

Milt Ivorson, hustling varsity for
ward, will probably be seeing lots
of action this weekend in the St.
Mary's and Santa Clara games,
lverson looked very impressive in
the non-conference games earlier in
the year, and he also showed well
in the conference opener against
U.S.C. But since then. Milt hasn't
been able to crack the lineup.
Now with Rose, Thompson, and
Yardley all out with the miseries,
Milt will be counted upon to supply
the punch to the front firing line.
He is capable of doing just that.
Against the Trojans, his spirited
and aggressive play kept the op
posing guards constantly worried,
and his offensive skill was demon
strated when he stole the ball from
SC guard Fred Bertram and drib
bled the entire length of the floor to
pocket two points.
It is also true that lverson has
played his best ball in the Cow
Palace, and that is where Stanford
finally returns after four disastrous
games on other hardwoods.
Jack Scharfen, a fast-improving
guard, should also have a golden
opportunity this weekend to get in
some needed game experience.
Scharfen is alert, quick, and rated
as being a top-notch defensive man.
He plays behind three of the
league's best guards, Babe Higgins,
Bob Lewis, and Dave Davidson.
