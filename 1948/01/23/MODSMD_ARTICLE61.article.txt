# Let's Go First Class

It doesn't cost much more to go first class!
Penny pinching tactics are not going to help
Stanford maintain a first-class athletic program.
Now there are many citicisms leveled at the
Stanford Athletic Council and headman A 1 Mas
ters by students, alumni, and windy sports
writers in the City.
Many of these gripes are unfounded or mis
informed, but unfortunately some of them are
warranted —and in spades.
Why did the SAC refuse to send the varsity
soccer team to Davis last fall for a regularly
scheduled game with the Cal Aggies? The Davis
game was to be the only away-from-home ap
pearance for the Farm's kick-squad, but the
front office double-padlocked its jeans and said
no even to paying for the team's bus fare.
The soccer team, while not enjoying major
status, spends many long, hard hours for the

love of the sport and the school. It seems only
reasonable that it be afforded some consider
ation—it even has to buy its own sweat socks.
The tennis team —which :s classified as
major—also has a few gripes coming. It has to
supply all its own equipment, with the excep
tion of tennis balls which the SAC provides.
The boxing, wrestling, and gymnastics
teams get no equipment from the University.
Only the sports that "pay-their-own-way," foot
ball and basketball, are given most of the nec
essary equipment.
The minor sports, and non-paying major
sports, are an equally important part of the
Stanford sports program and should be treated
as such.
It's about time we started going first class.
