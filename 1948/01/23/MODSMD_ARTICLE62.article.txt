The single, sanest piece of news that has come out
of Europe since the end of the war is the announce
ment by Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg that they
have done away with tariffs among themselves.
Goods will flow freely across their boundaries in an
encouragement of exchange of products and easy satis
faction of demands. The useless bother of customs and
the small army of officials at points on their borders
will be eliminated.
As for dealings with the rest of the world, these
forward-looking small states have a wise plan for
that, too. They are working out a three-nation tariff
policy and will exchange as a unit with other coun
tries. This is a practical start towards a European
Customs Union, and a customs union is basic to any
solution to the political problems of Europe.
These three little countries of Europe are showing

their "bigger brothers" of that continent that it is
possible for a group of nations to work in harmony
and conjunction with one another. The simplicity of
their undertaking should be acknowledged and studied
by the other countries of Europe. Certainly ii these
three nations have shown that the majority of tariffs
can be eliminated, that customs can be done away
with, and that many officials are unnecessary, then
the other countries of Europe could and should be
able to work out a similar plan.
The Governments of Belgium, Holland, and Lux
embourg have demonstrated that it is not necessary
to be overwhelmed by the confusion in international
trade and politics. They have demonstrated that simple
approaches can be made to big problems. What they
have done deserves recognition around the world
and adoption over Europe as rapidly as possible.
