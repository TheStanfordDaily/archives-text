# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						Case for the Council 
### 
To the Editor:
Some students would make it appear that the Coun
cil for Student Control listened to only one side of the
argument in fixing the damage assessments for the now
famous "Rape of Roble." On the contrary, we listened
to all the evidence presented to the Excom committee
plus the recommendations of the committee. (I might
add that this committee of fourteen passed its recom
mendations by a vote of only S to 6). We decided to
change it because we thought that no committee (no
matter how representative it' claims to be) could say
that 5 per cent of the damage was caused by one group,
2 (i per cent by another, .012 per cent by Uncle Don, and
so on. After much discussion (about two and one-half
hours to be exact), wc decided that a more just way
was to assess the Freshmen and Sophomores 50 per
cent( originally a 25-25 split but later changed to a
30-20 split because the Sophomore women had not
taken part) and the ASSU 50 per cent of the damages.
As mentioned above, we had all the evidence that
the Excom committee had; consequently, it we are to
be accused of not hearing all the evidence, the Excom
committee, too, is guilty of the same thing. Hank
Rosin's complaint would seem to be then that he was
not there to tell us how much the Sophomore class
should be assessed â€”when I was fined for not having a
car faster than Gus Mariotti (the home town traffic
cop), I can't recall the judge allowing me to fix my
own fine.
The Freshmen and Sophomores were assessed on
a punitive basis, not to fix responsibility as some stu
dents think. This was done because they were by far
the majority of those at Roble. ASSU was assessed
to make us realize that we as members of the Student
Body have a responsibility in seeing that our Excom
representatives appoint capable leaders of campus
events and see that they perform these duties pioperly.
We realize that our plan is not a perfect plan, but we
believe that we have been just to all parties concerned.
With very few exceptions, the Freshmen, Juniors, Sen
iors. Graduates, and even many Sophomores with
whom I have discussed the matter consider our plan
more equitable than the Excom committee plan.
The condemnation for the regrettable delay in the
final decision as to damages rests on Excom, not the
Council for Student Control. As part of our duties,
we assessed the damages within fourteen days after
the Pajamarino. Despite the fact that they had no jur
isdiction whatsoever to overrule the Council's deci
sion, Excom did that very thing and claimed there
was only one right way--their way. Professor Thur
man of the Law School ruled that under the ASSU
constitution, Excom had stepped out ol bounds and
could in no way reverse the Council's decision. Being
broad-minded however, we agreed to hear the case
over and did so on January 13.
Actually, Hank, the Sophomore students are "get
ting off" easier our way than under the Excom com
mittee plan. Figure it out for yourself: 10 per cent for
the Village. 5 per cent for Toyon, and 15 per cent for
the Row, add them up and one obtains 30 per cent

(and surely to be just to the Juniors, Seniors, and
Graduates in those groups the assessment should be
paid by the Sophomores of said groups).
In view of this. Hank, it would seem that perhaps
you are not concerned with the charge accruing to
each member of the class or that the Council lor
Student Control's plan is unjust. Rather, it would
appear that you and your Excom are more concerned
with the amount of work to be done in collecting the
money.
LOR EN SMITH.
Member, Council for Student Control.
