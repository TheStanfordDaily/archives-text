To the Editor:
In trying to go to the heart of the matter ol partisan
political action groups on the campus, maybe we ought
to consider what motivations arc behind the contro
versy over whether to allow these groups use of the
campus. '
The final decision, when it comes, will not stem from
Excom alone. It will bo the result of the conflicting
interactions of the ideals, hopes, and fears ot all of
us as Excom members, students, officers, trustees, and
alumni of Stanford.
I suspect that none of us, in his heart, really fears
the possibility of ideological conflict. All ol us are
ultimately certain our ideology of freedom would stand
the gall in any free competition. What, then, do we
fear in the possibility ol partisan political groups'
Do we all feel simply that such groups are unde
sirable in an academic community? Or do we use that
phrase as a mask for the fear oi student and faculty
disapproval, fear of warping of student political and
sociological consciousness, fear for the safety ol
jobs as officers and trustees, fear ol the disruption of
our financial status by those holding the purse strings,
fear of adverse public criticism?
Other universities —not too many, I am afraid, but
some—have faced the same challenge and affirmed
their belief in the ultimate advantage of free speech
and assembly, whatever political partisan activity it
brought. But maybe we just don't feel that Stanford
is yet ready, or has a mature enough student body,
or has a sufficient tolerant alumni, or has enough
prestige in the outside world, to take action in the
name of freedom and stand up under the consequences.
But I submit that the one place above all where
political groups are desirable, and must be tolerated
in the name <>112 free exchange of ideas, is the college
campus. For today's college students are tomorrow's
citizens, tomorrow's alumni, tomorrow's officers and
trustees, tomorrow's boards of education, and some ol
us even tomorrow's political leaders. If we be educated
by our predecessors to the superiority of expediency
over principle, and the convenient effectiveness of the
ban and the muzzle, those of us who do not take the
time and trouble to seek political discussion off-campus
are not unlikely to call on these restrictive devices
even more readily than our predecessors when we sit
in thir places tomorrow.

I suspect that none of us, in his heart, really fears
the possibility of ideological conflict. All ol us are
ultimately certain our ideology of freedom would stand
the gall in any free competition. What, then, do we
fear in the possibility ol partisan political groups'
Do we all feel simply that such groups are unde
sirable in an academic community? Or do we use that
phrase as a mask for the fear oi student and faculty
disapproval, fear of warping of student political and
sociological consciousness, fear for the safety ol
jobs as officers and trustees, fear ol the disruption of
our financial status by those holding the purse strings,
fear of adverse public criticism?
Other universities —not too many, I am afraid, but
some—have faced the same challenge and affirmed
their belief in the ultimate advantage of free speech
and assembly, whatever political partisan activity it
brought. But maybe we just don't feel that Stanford
is yet ready, or has a mature enough student body,
or has a sufficient tolerant alumni, or has enough
prestige in the outside world, to take action in the
name of freedom and stand up under the consequences.
But I submit that the one place above all where
political groups are desirable, and must be tolerated
in the name <>112 free exchange of ideas, is the college
campus. For today's college students are tomorrow's
citizens, tomorrow's alumni, tomorrow's officers and
trustees, tomorrow's boards of education, and some ol
us even tomorrow's political leaders. If we be educated
by our predecessors to the superiority of expediency
over principle, and the convenient effectiveness of the
ban and the muzzle, those of us who do not take the
time and trouble to seek political discussion off-campus
are not unlikely to call on these restrictive devices
even more readily than our predecessors when we sit
in thir places tomorrow.
