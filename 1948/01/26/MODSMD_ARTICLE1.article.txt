## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP)
—Harold E. Stassen announced
today that he would challenge
the presidential ambitions of
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio
on his home grounds and drew
from Taft a sharp statement that he
was making a "great mistake" and
endangering Republican party har
mony.
Soon after the former Minnesota
Governor announced that lie would
enter Ohiu's May 4 GOP presidential
preference primary to test his own
presidential aspirations against Taft,
Taft issued ihis statement:
GREAT MISTAKE
"I believe that Mr. Stassen has
made a great mistake from his own
standpoint in filing in Ohio, contrary
to the usual practice among those
interested in maintaining Republic
an party harmony. Of course, he has
every legal right to do so but if a
primary battleground must be chos
en, I am delighted he has selected
Ohio where he has no chance of suc
cess."
Stassen made his statement as he
departed for New England in the
hope of picking up support from for
mer Eisenhowcr-for-President forc
es. He said bluntly that the differ
ences between him and Taft on both
foreign and domestic policy "repre
sent the major issues within the Re
publican party and before the coun
try."
MARSHALL PLAN
The only place to settle them,
Stassen added, is in Taft's home
state.
Stassen is an Internationalist and
a self-styled Liberal, and has been
seeking some way to reply to Taft's
frequent attack on the Marshall
European Recovery Plan.
Taft's rapier-like acceptance of his
challenge thus makes the forthcom
ing Ohio primary a major testing
ground for their differing points of
view.
Until now Taft has been unoppos
ed in his home slate and had been
assured solid support of the Buck
eye delegation to the Republican
National Convention in June.
