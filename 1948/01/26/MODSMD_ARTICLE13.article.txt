# Political Groups Ruled Out
## 
### 
(Tin- following is a ropy of a letter from Lawrence A. Kimpton, Dean
of Students, to Tom Martzloff, president of the ASSU.)
Mr. Thomas Martzloff
President of ASSU
Stanford University
Dear Mr. Martzloff:
I read in the columns of the Stanford Daily of a petition
requesting the amendment of the ASSU Constitution to authorize
the ASSU and its officers to recognize as official student body
organizations groups which advocate partisan political policies.
I understand that the Executive Committee of the ASSU has
tabled this request, but that in accordance with your Constitu
tion the matter may go, in due course, to a vote of your entire
membership.
Student body self-government is an old and reversed insti
tution at Stanford. It is rare indeed in the history of the Uni
versity that the administration has had to say that any matter is
not within the jurisdiction of the Associated Students. It is with
considerable reluctance, therefore, that I inform you that the
petition above referred to, if acted upon affirmatively by the
Executive Committee or by your total membership, would result
in an ASSU ruling contrary to a regulation of the University.
Under such circumstances, the formal action now indicated be
comes unnecessary, if not improper.
As early as 1911, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University
ruled that, "None of the assembly halls, buildings, or grounds
of the University shall be used for political or partisan addresses
or gatherings." This ruling has been reviewed and reaffirmed
by the Board of Trustees as recently as Octoger 1947. This regu
lation is interpreted to mean that student organizations espousing
partisan political doctrines and advocating political action in the
light of them are forbidden on the campus of Stanford University.
There is nothing in this regulation which prohibits a Stanford
student from affiliating with such a group off-campus and
participating—though not in the name of the University—in
such political action as such a group may advocate.
The University welcomes the free and objective discussion of
political economic, and social issues of the kind conducted by the
Stanford Debating Society, the Western College Congress, and
of the kind proposed recently by NSA in terms of which two
speakers of opposite persuasion debate a political issue. It is
no part of the policy of the University to avoid free, full, and
objective discussion on the part of students of all political issues;
the policy applies only to the direct or indirect commitment on
the part of the University to some political viewpoint or activity.
I should be glad, of course, to discuss this matter further
with the Executive Committee of the ASSU should this be nec
essary or advisable.
Very sinccrely,
L. A. KIMPTON,
Dean of Students.
