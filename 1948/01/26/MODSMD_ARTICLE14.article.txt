# Rainstorm Possible by Midweek; Stanford Faces Water Shortage
## 
### United Press 
Water rationing is in effect on a
limited scale at Stanford University.
In a letter to all campus residents
Business Manager Alf E. Brandin
said, "We request that you do not
use any water for sprinkling lawns,
until further notice."
Storage water in Felt and Scars
ville Lakes is critically low, the
letter explained. Water from the
lakes, in addition to being used for
irrigation purposes throughout the
campus, also constitutes most of the
supply for the fire protection sys
tem.
"It is quite evident now that a
method of rationing of water will
have to he put into effect through
the summer months. This letter is
to request that you do not plant
any spring plantings or any vege
table gardens," Brandin stated.
The rainfall for 1946-47 was be
low normal, and as a result Felt
Lake wa,s not filled. During the
current season rainfall is again 'far
below normal. Felt Lake is filled to
about half capacity. Searsville is
about 40 per cent of capacity.
In San Francisco the Water De
partment estimated there was suffi
cient water available for "normal
living" needs despite the sccond
year of rainfall shortage.

Light showers in (he far southern
area and a forecast for "possible"
rain in the north - central regions
brought some cheer to sun-parched
California, but forecasters saw little
chance for the general rainfall
needed to save drought-threatened
crops.
Showers fell in Sandberg, Beau
mont, and San Diego over night
and a few sprinkles were felt in
the Glendalc-Pasadena area to re
cord the state's first rainfall in near
ly a month.
In San Francisco, the U.S. Weath
er Bureau reported a "disturbance"
in the Pacific some 1,500 miles off
the coast and said there was a pos
sibility of rain by mid-week. They
added, however, lhat the prospects
for a real rainfall were nil at the
present time.
