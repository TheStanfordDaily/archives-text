WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP).â€”
Big guns of the Democratic party
today fired another broadside at Re
publican "defeatism" and called on
Americans to pile up a record vote
next November for President Tru
man and his 10-year prosperity
plan.
The keynote was sounded in a
radio rally (NBC) by Senator J.
Howard McGrath, D., R. 1., the par
ty's national chairman, and by Wil
son W. Wyatt.
Counseling against another "mi
nority election," he denounced the
GOP's legislative slate as "econom
ic defeatism and continued inflation
with its resultant boom and bust,"
and called on voters to "roll up a
Congressional mandate for Presi
dent Truman's program in the
greatest popular vote in history."
The rally was one of a series,
which the Republicans are matching
with nationwide counter-broadsides.
