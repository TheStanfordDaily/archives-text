# 12 Houses Schedule Dances
## 
### 
Leading the way in the new on
campus social program suggested
last week by Guyla Runyon, ASSU
vice-president., twelve fraternities
have requested weekend open-dance
dates. The rest of the fraternities
are expected to follow suit soon, ac
cording to Miss Runyon.
The new program, outlined by
Miss Runyon before the Interfra
ternity Council and at the all-cam
pus social chairmen meeting last
week, suggests that a minimum of
three living groups sponsor on-cam
pus affairs on weekend nights.
OPEN DANCES
Initiating the plan, Sigma Nu,
Delta Tau Delta, Theta Xi, and Phi
Gamma Delta have scheduled open
dances for Saturday, Feb. 7. A meet
ing will be held at the Phi Gamma
Delta house at 4:30 p.m. today to
discuss arrangements.
"The fraternities arc all anxious
to coopcrat c," commented Jim
Welch, Interfraternity Council pres
ident. "The houses which have not
already scheduled open affairs in
tend to petition for dates in the latter
part of the quarter."
GENERAL REQUEST
Ihe plan was formulated in re
sponse to a general student request
for more social activity on campus,
Miss Runyon explained. "Veterans'

and on El Caniino mean a lot of
money. We're attempting to exploit
our own facilities."
"Although the fraternities have
taken the lead," Miss Runyan added,
"this program is certainly not lim
ited to their support. We expect
every living group on campus and
at the Village to do its part. It's a
cooperative scheme; the money that
each house puts out in entertaining
the campus should return a rich di
vidend of counter-invitations."
AVOID OVERCROWDING
"By scheduling a minimum of
three affairs on each night, wo hope
to avoid the over-crowding so typ
ical of most all-campus dances. We
are also suggesting that these affairs
he for the most part "date" and thus
to avoid the threc-to-one stag line."
"The response to this request has
been wonderful," Miss Runyon con
cluded. "If the rest of the living
groups take the hint, we expect a
really fine social year."
