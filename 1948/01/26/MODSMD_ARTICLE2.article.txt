WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP)â€”A
government agency today produced
what looked like the nearest thing
thus far to an official hint that a
United States airplane has flown
faster than the speed of sound.
The apparent hint was in an an
nouncement by the National Advis
ory Committee for Aeronautics. It
said that Laurence A. Clousing, NA
CA test pilot, will receive the 1947
Octave Chanutc award given by the
Institute of the Aeronautical Sci
ences to a pilot who has made "not
able contribution to aeronautical
science."
Clousing has flown a Lockheed P
-80 Shooting Star at 8(3.6 percent of
the speed of sound, the announce
ment said.
