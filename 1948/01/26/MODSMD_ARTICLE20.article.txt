WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP).â€”
Chairman Homer Ferguson, I?.,
Mich., said today that his Senate
Appropriations sub - Committed on
speculation has not abandoned its
inquiry into the commodity deals of
Edwin W. Pauley, but may take
time out to investigate the activities
of other alleged "government in
siders."
Republican Presidential aspirant
Harold E. Stasscn, who clashed
facc-to-face with Pauley before the
sub - committee last week, has
charged that some 10 other "insid
ers" profited on the grain and other
commodity markets from confiden
tial government information.
Ferguson said the investigation
would bo "rather long" since a lot
of time is needed lo compile facts
and figures."
Chairman August H. Andresen,
R., Minn., said meanwhile that his
House Speculation Investigating
Committee expects to hold hearings
soon which "may disclose some
rather large speculative operations
on the part of one or more govern
ment employees."
"It mav develop into big names
afterward but not through these
employees because wo generally
find big names trading through
other individuals," ho said. "W<"
hope to trace tht.ni down and get to
the bottom of each case."
Andresen went on a one - man
sleuthing expedition in search of
government grain speculators early
this month. He has been working
on leads gained in his search behind
the scenes since then.
Pauley today reiterated his charge
that Stassen was motivated purely
by politics when the former Minne
sota Governor charged him with us
ing inside information to enhance
his position on the commodity
markets.
