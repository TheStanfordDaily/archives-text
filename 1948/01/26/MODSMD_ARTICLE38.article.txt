# Toast masters, KSU Work on Same Lines

Power for refrigerators, elec
tric lights, toastmasters, and
KSU travel along the same
wires, according to Hay Sand
ers, KSU's chief engineering
consultant.
"KSU's broadcasting system is dif
ferent from the average wireless
system," he continued. "The audio
and radio waves go through the
mike and out over the KSU wires
to one of the four transmitter units
—Encina, Lagunita, Union, or the
Village—in the same way that the
waves from any large station would
go. But then the waves from con
ventional stations would leave the
wires and climb to the top of a high
antenna where they would be beam
ed out in ever-widening circles
through the ether."
CARRIER current
Because of tin- high cost of the
antenna system and the difficulty of
getting a license, KSU works on the
carrier current system. Instead of
climbing, the two waves meet and
arc carried by regular bouse current
electric wires to any campus radios
that are within l. r >fi feet of any part
of the wire.
The engineering staff, headed by
Chief Engineer Del Blair, keeps the

wires from getting mixed up. It in
cludes Ray Sanders, consultant, Jack
Wernli, control room chief, and Pete
Duwson, line chief, who strings
KSU's special wire where no regular
wires are available.
FOUR TRANSMITTERS
From the four transmitters wires
run to the other houses on the cam
pus. Lines from Enema feed Toyon
and Branner; lines from Union feed
the row; Lagunita leads into Roble;
and the Village covers itself. KSU
can be heard in automobiles if the
cars are parked within 156 feet of
the wiie.
The broadcast signal only reaches
15(5 feet from the carrier wire be
cause a carrier current system re
quires no Federal Communications
Commission license, but an FCC
rule limits such broadcasts to this
range. By operating on a weak pow
er output, KSU keeps within the
regulations.
