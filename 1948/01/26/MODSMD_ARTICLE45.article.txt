# Farm Capers Post Double Win; Gaels, Broncs, Lose Palace Tilts
## 
### BILL ALLEN ART LUBIC 
Operating close to top effi
ciency, both offensively and de
fensively, the Stanford basket
ball team whipped Santa Clara
53 to 41, Saturday night in the
Cow Palace. It was the Indians' sec
ond victory of the weekend, their
fifth win in six Cow Palace starts.
Santa Clara was in the game for
only about 10 minutes of the first
half. With six minutes gone, the
Broncos were trailing by only one
point, but then Dave Davidson made
two field goals and Bill Rose a field
goal and free throw to put Stanford
ahead 14 to 5.
With the second team—the speed
unit—taking over in the last five
minutes, the Cards stretched their
half time lead to 28 to 15.
The margin grew steadily in the
second half, reaching 21 points with
live minutes to play. Only three last
minute field goals by Bronco re
serve forward George Nichols made
the score semi-respectable.
DEAN CLEARS BENCH
Everybody from Stanford "got into
the act" in these last live minutes.
Coach Everett Dean used all 1G of
his men who were in uniform.
Scoring leader for Stanford was
Davidson with 15 points. Dave show
ed that he is definitely back in shape
and his play made a lot of differ
ence in the club's offensive.
Stanford guards and forwards '
were driving through the Santa
Clara defense as they are supposed
to do, and center Steve Stephenson j
was not being left holding the ball !
in the pivot spot as happened so of- J
ten in tfie Cal games.
The Cards' floor game was slick.
Bad passes were at a minimum,
screen plays were working well. The
team was alert, breaking up several
Santa Clara plays and turning them
into Stanford points.
On the boards, Davdison gave Ste- [
phenson some much-needed help. 1
Steve made two tip-ins, and it was
seldom that Stanford failed to get
more than one shot at the basket !
each time they had the ball.
Defensively, the Farm quintet ex- j
celled as always. Forward Bob Mc-
Killip was the only Santa Claran !
who got through the Stanford zone
defense with any regularity. He led I
Bronco pointmakers with 14 mark- 1
ers.
LANEY IIELI) TO 5 POINTS
Behind him was guard Dav Mari
an i with five long field goals for 10 i
points. Bronco star, Frank Laney,
the big husky center, was held to
five points, three of them on foul I
shots.
Behind Davidson in the Stanford
scoring column were Stephenson, |
Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis with
nine points each. Iverson is a real !
scrapper and driver, the kind that
makes his own shooting opportuni
ties.
Lewis, not usually an offensive :
ihreat, caged four nice one-hand j
push shots.
Only Morley Thompson and
George Yardley missed the game, j

A record crowd of 12,136 jammed

LEWIS HANDLES KUDELKA
While Bob Lewis found Frank

and succeeded in bottling up the
Gaels' high scoring ace, the Cards
moved out in front by a 12-1 mar
gin. Kudelka hit for a long field
goal, but with eight minutes of play
remaining in the first half everyone

Rial hitting from outside the zone
and Kudelka doing some clever
work on tip-ins under the bucket.
A 34-23 lead became 36-28, then 37-
33, 40-39, and finally a free throw

by Rial tied it up at 43-all with
three minutes to go.
For two minutes the crowd re
mained in suspense as neither team
could mesh a shot.
St. Mary's hustled downcourt, but
Stephenson pilfered the ball and
passed to Higgins under the Gael
basket for an easy score giving Stan
ford a safe four-point margin.
Bullwinkle sank a long one for
St. Mary's but the Cards froze the
ball until the final gun seconds later.

Scoring leader for Stanford was
Davidson with 15 points. Dave show

The Cards' floor game was slick.
Bad passes were at a minimum,
screen plays were working well. The
team was alert, breaking up several
Santa Clara plays and turning them
into Stanford points.
On the boards, Davdison gave Ste- [
phenson some much-needed help. 1
Steve made two tip-ins, and it was
seldom that Stanford failed to get
more than one shot at the basket !
each time they had the ball.
Defensively, the Farm quintet ex- j

moved out in front by a 12-1 mar
gin. Kudelka hit for a long field
goal, but with eight minutes of play
remaining in the first half everyone
on the Stanford first string had scor

GAELS RALLY
Then the St. Mary's attack began

33, 40-39, and finally a free throw

by Rial tied it up at 43-all with
three minutes to go.
For two minutes the crowd re
mained in suspense as neither team
could mesh a shot.
St. Mary's hustled downcourt, but
Stephenson pilfered the ball and
passed to Higgins under the Gael
basket for an easy score giving Stan
ford a safe four-point margin.
Bullwinkle sank a long one for
St. Mary's but the Cards froze the
ball until the final gun seconds later.

DEAN CLEARS BENCH
Everybody from Stanford "got into

Coach Everett Dean used all 1G of
his men who were in uniform.
Scoring leader for Stanford was
Davidson with 15 points. Dave show
ed that he is definitely back in shape
and his play made a lot of differ

Stanford guards and forwards '
were driving through the Santa
Clara defense as they are supposed

in the pivot spot as happened so of- J
ten in tfie Cal games.
The Cards' floor game was slick.
Bad passes were at a minimum,
screen plays were working well. The
team was alert, breaking up several
Santa Clara plays and turning them
into Stanford points.
On the boards, Davdison gave Ste- [
phenson some much-needed help. 1
Steve made two tip-ins, and it was
seldom that Stanford failed to get
more than one shot at the basket !
each time they had the ball.
Defensively, the Farm quintet ex- j

defense with any regularity. He led I
Bronco pointmakers with 14 mark- 1

by Rial tied it up at 43-all with

For two minutes the crowd re

St. Mary's hustled downcourt, but
Stephenson pilfered the ball and
passed to Higgins under the Gael
basket for an easy score giving Stan
ford a safe four-point margin.
Bullwinkle sank a long one for
St. Mary's but the Cards froze the
ball until the final gun seconds later.

fensively, the Stanford basket
ball team whipped Santa Clara
53 to 41, Saturday night in the
Cow Palace. It was the Indians' sec
ond victory of the weekend, their
fifth win in six Cow Palace starts.
Santa Clara was in the game for

serve forward George Nichols made
the score semi-respectable.
DEAN CLEARS BENCH
Everybody from Stanford "got into
the act" in these last live minutes.
Coach Everett Dean used all 1G of
his men who were in uniform.
Scoring leader for Stanford was
Davidson with 15 points. Dave show
ed that he is definitely back in shape
and his play made a lot of differ
ence in the club's offensive.
Stanford guards and forwards '
were driving through the Santa
Clara defense as they are supposed
to do, and center Steve Stephenson j
was not being left holding the ball !
in the pivot spot as happened so of- J
ten in tfie Cal games.
The Cards' floor game was slick.
Bad passes were at a minimum,
screen plays were working well. The
team was alert, breaking up several
Santa Clara plays and turning them
into Stanford points.
On the boards, Davdison gave Ste- [
phenson some much-needed help. 1
Steve made two tip-ins, and it was
seldom that Stanford failed to get
more than one shot at the basket !
each time they had the ball.
Defensively, the Farm quintet ex- j
celled as always. Forward Bob Mc-
Killip was the only Santa Claran !
who got through the Stanford zone
defense with any regularity. He led I
Bronco pointmakers with 14 mark- 1
ers.
LANEY IIELI) TO 5 POINTS
Behind him was guard Dav Mari
an i with five long field goals for 10 i
points. Bronco star, Frank Laney,
the big husky center, was held to
five points, three of them on foul I
shots.
Behind Davidson in the Stanford
scoring column were Stephenson, |
Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis with
nine points each. Iverson is a real !
scrapper and driver, the kind that
makes his own shooting opportuni
ties.
Lewis, not usually an offensive :
ihreat, caged four nice one-hand j
push shots.
Only Morley Thompson and
