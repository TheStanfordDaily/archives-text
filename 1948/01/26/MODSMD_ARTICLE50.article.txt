## Menlo Ruggers Edge Indians 
### HILL BETHKE 
Stanford's ruggers absorbed a
close 6 to 5 defeat at the hands of
the Menlo Ramblers last Saturday
as Howie Sonnickson of the Menlo
club booted a 20-yard penalty kick
after the regular playing time had
elapsed to clinch the game for the
visitors.
Marty Feldman had a chance to
put the Cards ahead a minute later
when he was awarded a penalty at
tempt. The 35-yard kick was set at
a steep angle and the ball sailed
wide.
Coach Willard Clausen's Cards
had been leading when time ran
out. However, rugby rules require
play to continue unitl the ball
goes out of bounds, giving Sonnick
son his chance.
At the close of the first half Stan
ford led 5 to 0 by the grace of Lou
Sloss's tally and Feldman's conver
sion. Sloss scooped up the ball from
the three-yard stripe in the game's
early minutes, ran it around the
goal posts, and touched it down.
Feldman's following conversion gave
the Farm men another two points
and a five-marker lead.
Menlo's six points came on a sec
ond-half penalty kick by Sonnick
son for three and his overtime pen
alty boot after time had expired.
The Ramblers, who bowed to the
Indians last week, came back to the
Farm field a better squad both of
fensively and defensively. The home
squad showed little improvement,
and it was their lack of fundamen
tal ''know how" that turned the tide
against them.
