## 
### PETE GREENFIELD 
Everything but a knockout enlivened the fisticuffs Friday
evening in the Basketball Pavilion as Coach Ray Lunny's boxing
team defeated the invading Broncos of Santa Clara, four bouts
to two.
In the opening bout, 118-lb. limit, Bill McDiarmid (SC) gave

his squad the jump by punching out
a well-earned decision over scrappy
but ineffective Eddie O'Neill (S).
McDiarmid caught on to Eddie's low
clucks in the second round and went
on to pulverize him in the linal heat.
SAVAGE OUTPOINTS MOHUN
The 130-lb. class pitted together
two exponents of fancy footwork,
Jay Savage (S) and Jerry Mohun
(SC)'. The match was a lesson in
shadow boxing, with Savage getting
a bit the better of the occasional
flurries to gain a decision and put
the tournament on an even basis
again.
Stanford gained the lead in the
l'!s - lb. bout as Willie Altus (S)
TKO - ed Vince Maloney (SC) in
2 minutes 4ti seconds of the third
round.
Dick Stanton (S) and Gaeton De
Mattei (SC) of the 155-lb. class had
been setting a fast pace when, in
some furious infighting, Stanton re
ceived a bloody nose and a cut eye
and the match was called. The con
test was declared a draw, in accord
ance with the intercollegiate box
ing rule covering an injury to one
participant in the first round.
One of Coach Lunny's prize pro
teges, middleweight Fred Ten Evck,
came through with another sterling
performance to gain a technical

knockout over Bronco Scotty Mac
beth in the first round.
INDIANS TAKE 4-1 LEAD
In the light-heavyweight, bracket,
Joe < Cranmer (S) squared off against
Joe Moreno (SC). Cranmer kept in
constant motion, stepping in and
out, jabbing away at Moreno with
his machine-gun left. With a half
minute remaining, Cranmer received
the third TKO of the evening to
give Stanford a 4-1 lead in the
match.
The final contest, scheduled be
tween heavyweights Jim Buckley
(SC) and Chuck Coker (S), was
called off, Santa Clara receiving a
forfeit. In its stead was substituted
an exhibition match pitting Emery
Mitchell against Buckley. The bout
was close throughout, each boxer
cautious of his opponent. There was
no decision.
The final count, therefore, was
Stanford four, Santa Clara two, one
draw.

been setting a fast pace when, in
some furious infighting, Stanton re
ceived a bloody nose and a cut eye
and the match was called. The con
test was declared a draw, in accord
ance with the intercollegiate box
ing rule covering an injury to one
participant in the first round.
One of Coach Lunny's prize pro
teges, middleweight Fred Ten Evck,
came through with another sterling
performance to gain a technical

knockout over Bronco Scotty Mac
beth in the first round.
INDIANS TAKE 4-1 LEAD
In the light-heavyweight, bracket,
Joe < Cranmer (S) squared off against
Joe Moreno (SC). Cranmer kept in
constant motion, stepping in and
out, jabbing away at Moreno with
his machine-gun left. With a half
minute remaining, Cranmer received
the third TKO of the evening to
give Stanford a 4-1 lead in the
match.
The final contest, scheduled be
tween heavyweights Jim Buckley
(SC) and Chuck Coker (S), was
called off, Santa Clara receiving a
forfeit. In its stead was substituted
an exhibition match pitting Emery
Mitchell against Buckley. The bout
was close throughout, each boxer
cautious of his opponent. There was
no decision.
The final count, therefore, was
Stanford four, Santa Clara two, one
draw.
Everything but a knockout enlivened the fisticuffs Friday
evening in the Basketball Pavilion as Coach Ray Lunny's boxing
team defeated the invading Broncos of Santa Clara, four bouts
to two.
In the opening bout, 118-lb. limit, Bill McDiarmid (SC) gave

his squad the jump by punching out
a well-earned decision over scrappy
but ineffective Eddie O'Neill (S).
McDiarmid caught on to Eddie's low
clucks in the second round and went
on to pulverize him in the linal heat.
SAVAGE OUTPOINTS MOHUN
The 130-lb. class pitted together
two exponents of fancy footwork,
Jay Savage (S) and Jerry Mohun
(SC)'. The match was a lesson in
shadow boxing, with Savage getting
a bit the better of the occasional
flurries to gain a decision and put
the tournament on an even basis
again.
Stanford gained the lead in the
l'!s - lb. bout as Willie Altus (S)
TKO - ed Vince Maloney (SC) in
2 minutes 4ti seconds of the third
round.
Dick Stanton (S) and Gaeton De
Mattei (SC) of the 155-lb. class had
