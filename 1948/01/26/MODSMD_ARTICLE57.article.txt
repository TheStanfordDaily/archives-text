# 'Ash Trays on Quad?'
## 
### 
Last Friday's Daily ran a front page headline
which read, "50 Ash Trays To Line Quad." The
story went on to say that Carroll Blacker, Su
perintendent of Buildings and Grounds, after
completing a survey of the Quad last quarter,
decided that these receptacles were necessary.
Normally this story would be given an inch
of space on the back page of a newspaper. On
the Stanford campus, however, where No Smok
ing on Quad has been a tradition fox 57
years, the announcement is important.
There has been a great deal of controversy
in the past few years as to the practicality of
continuing this tradition. It has been argued
that a tradition which needs active enforcing
is no longer worth keeping a tradition.
The Farm's activity group, Cardinals, has
been the recognized watch-dog of Stanford tra
ditions. This action of placing cigarette recep

tacles around Quad was taken by the Corp
Yard without conferring with any student group.
Although it is true that for the appearance and
cleanliness of the University these containers
may appear to be necessary under present con
ditions, Cardinals should decide whether the
tradition is worth campaigning to keep before
it is abolished by "ash trays" on Quad.
Every new student at Stanford is told about
the University's strongest tradition, the Honor
Code. Very little information is provided about
the lesser known traditions that are almost as
important a part of the Farm student's life.
If Cardinals decides that because of changed
conditions the No Smoking on Quad tradition is
outmoded, they can sanction the work of the
Corp Yard. If the organization and others in the
student body decide that the tradition is worth
fighting to keep, they should take action now in
an active campaign.—M.S.
