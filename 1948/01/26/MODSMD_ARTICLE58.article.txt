# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
Went down to Pebble Beach a couple of weeks ago
to watch the experts play golf in the Bing Crosby
tournament.
They don't play the game the way most of us do.
With them it's coldly scientific. They even send a
man ahead to check the weather conditions on the
next hole.
I guess a tournament golfer is the only man in
the world who wakes up in the morning feeling under
par and is happy about the whole thing.
Jimmy Demaret was there. He was wearing slacks
of a definite pinkish hue, a powder blue shirt, and a
millinery abortion he called a hat. His partner was
Bing Crosby, who is no purist when it comes to color
himself. It is rumored that Demaret asked Crosby
what hi< thought would go best with his purple and
yellow golf socks. The same rumor has it that Crosby
replied, "hip boots."
But most of the time the players are very serious
about their game. Even the caddies put their heart
and soul into the match. At one time the gallery
moved up the fairway ahead of the golfers. Bobby
Locke, the South African big money winner, hit a
drive that ploughed into one of the gallery. As they
helped the injured spectator off the fairway, one
caddy said:
"Gee, I hope they don't penalize Locke."
And was it crowded around the greens. The mem
bers of the gallery had to take turns breathing—that's
more crowded than the Marriage and the Family
lecture room.
Lloyd Mangrum, as you know, won the three day

match by five strokes. That's a lot in golf. Most
matches are won by one or two strokes over the
second place man. That's why they're so careful
about each shot. Mangrum missed a putt on the
ninth green, and was perturbed about it.
I'd like to tell you what he said, but they'd ban
the Stanford Daily in Boston.
Nevertheless each shot counts. If the player loses
a ball, or if he drives into the ocean, or if he gets
an unplayable lie—but that's like saying what would
happen to the suspender business if there was no law
of gravity.
"If" is a big word in money golf. The big-timers
just don't miss. After all, if a giraffe were as long
as he is tall he'd be a lizard.
I used to play a pretty good game of golf myself.
I learned the game when I was IG. I was also learning
to drive a car then. My lessons progressed rapidly—
in one I was hitting everything, and in the other I
was hitting nothing. The correlation is just the way
you're figuring it.
I finally gave up the game for financial reasons.
With greens fees at $2.50 a round it's better I should
shoot pool at 5c a cue.
1 wish now I could play it well enough to come in
for some of that $10,000 prize money they were giving
out. If I could play like Lloyd Mangrum it would be
an easier way of making money than writing essays
for the Daughters of the American Revolution.
Well, anyway, it's a fine sport, and no matter how
you slice it, it's still golf.
