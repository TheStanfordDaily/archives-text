There has been quite a political feud going on in
the past few months between the United States and
Denmark. Denmark has demanded that the United
States yet out of Greenland "lock, stock, and barrel".
In demanding that the U.S. quit its air bases, Navy
fueling stations, and weather bases in Greenland, the
Danish Government is certainly taking a position of
ingratitude. This is the story behind it.
Denmark, a tiny country with negligible military
power, could not defend Greenland when the Nazis put
bases there during the war. The defenselessness of
Greenland was a grave peril to the United States
and a costly error in the strategy of the war. Nazi
planes flew from there; Nazi submarines refueled
there; and N;izi weather stations operated there—
striking at U.S. convoys to England and Russia.
All of this was taking place on an island just
across a strait from the mouth of the St. Lawrence.
The United States, with Denmark's approval, stepped
in and drove the Nazis out of Greenland and helped
drive them out of Denmark.
Now. instead of being the least bit grateful to the

United States for preserving Danish sovereignty over ;
this largest of the world's islands, the government of (
Denmark is demanding that the United States quit
Greenland and leave it again defenseless.
Now the United States has been willing to leave
this island if Denmark would establish some defense ■
for the island. But so far no agreement has been
reached by the two countries. The U.S. certainly
can't leave this gateway to their eastern shore de- J
fenseless.
If we were to take that attitude of "don t care
what happens" we would be placing our country in a
seriously exposed position with a vast potential air
and naval base within easy striking distance of our
shores, wholly vulnerable to any enemy of this country.
The Danish government began demanding removal
of United States forces from Greenland at the urg
ence of communists in Denmark. It now certainly ;
appears that Denmark is knuckling under the com- !
munist prompting and moving against the interests |
of security for North America. I believe that the
Danish government should take a little more time ,
in nonderint? the ciuestion in doubt.
