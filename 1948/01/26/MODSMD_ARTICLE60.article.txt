To the Editor:
In reference to the letter in Friday's Daily by Wm,
I'aimer, Jr.. I should like to share some thoughts it
brought to mind. The letter did cover pretty well the
fears and the reasons for fear of this partisan political
action that people have been able to express to date.
Bui the third paragraph assumes a lot. To quote:
"I suspect that none of us, in his heart, really fears
the possibility of ideological conflict. All of us are
ultimately certain our ideology of freedom would
stand the gaff in any free competition. What, then, do
we fear in the possibility of partisan political groups?"
In any talk I've had with anyone, from campus
wheel to insignificant bookworm, that got down to
what he or she was really thinking, I have been able
to find no ultimate certainty. While there is perhaps
no real fear, there is plenty of wonderment. Actually,
you might say there was no room for fear of campus
wide ideological conflict, because each of these stud
ents was engrossed in quite as significant a conflict
within his own heart. And when we get down that
deep we're all the same.
I sincerely wish I could find some sign of free
ideological competition, too. I had the good fortune
during the holidays to see and hear Mr. Harry Wick
hnm. a member of the British Parliament in charge
of 57 political labor constituencies which includes
7,000,0(10 industrial workers, who has been face to
face with subversive ideological forces in industry, lie

said, "Today (Dec. 31) from Moscow will go a direct
ive for strikes in France, infiltration in Britain, divi
sion in Italy, exploitation of misery in Germany, racial
warfare in India, open warfare in China, and in every
corner of the world sabotage, death, and destruction.
Before we raise our voices in protest at this state
ment, let's look at the world during the past year
or two. Is this "free competition?"
What is our "ideology of freedom? Is it something
which gives us strong purpose and therefore under
which we need have no fear of the very real isms
that are doing a successful job of breeding hate in
the world today? Is it something with which we can
answer and supplant the very real under-the-skin
forces that are intent upon division and infiltration
and exploitation in Europe and the Western Hemis
phere? Is it something that is so good it cannot be
defeated?
I also heard from a Finnish man in his twenties, j
whom I later met. He said this: "The Finns though!
their course was right and they knew the right course
always wins. But it didn't win—twice —against Russia.
I lost faith in democracy." Let's think twice before
we throw that one out on account of the "great- |
ness" of our country compared to Finland.
We needn't fear ideological conflict if we can
stand on our own feet. But we must be prudent and j
vigilant. Before we go hog-wild over partisan action
groups, let's reflect. Can infiltration and free ex- !
change ol ideas be compatible? I don't think so.

Before we raise our voices in protest at this state

What is our "ideology of freedom? Is it something
which gives us strong purpose and therefore under

that are doing a successful job of breeding hate in
the world today? Is it something with which we can
answer and supplant the very real under-the-skin
forces that are intent upon division and infiltration
and exploitation in Europe and the Western Hemis

defeated?
I also heard from a Finnish man in his twenties, j
whom I later met. He said this: "The Finns though!
their course was right and they knew the right course

I lost faith in democracy." Let's think twice before
we throw that one out on account of the "great- |
ness" of our country compared to Finland.
We needn't fear ideological conflict if we can
stand on our own feet. But we must be prudent and j
vigilant. Before we go hog-wild over partisan action
groups, let's reflect. Can infiltration and free ex- !
change ol ideas be compatible? I don't think so.

To the Editor:
In reference to the letter in Friday's Daily by Wm,
I'aimer, Jr.. I should like to share some thoughts it
brought to mind. The letter did cover pretty well the
fears and the reasons for fear of this partisan political
action that people have been able to express to date.
Bui the third paragraph assumes a lot. To quote:
"I suspect that none of us, in his heart, really fears
the possibility of ideological conflict. All of us are
ultimately certain our ideology of freedom would
stand the gaff in any free competition. What, then, do
we fear in the possibility of partisan political groups?"
In any talk I've had with anyone, from campus
wheel to insignificant bookworm, that got down to
what he or she was really thinking, I have been able
to find no ultimate certainty. While there is perhaps
no real fear, there is plenty of wonderment. Actually,
you might say there was no room for fear of campus
wide ideological conflict, because each of these stud
ents was engrossed in quite as significant a conflict
within his own heart. And when we get down that
deep we're all the same.
I sincerely wish I could find some sign of free
ideological competition, too. I had the good fortune
during the holidays to see and hear Mr. Harry Wick
hnm. a member of the British Parliament in charge
of 57 political labor constituencies which includes
7,000,0(10 industrial workers, who has been face to
face with subversive ideological forces in industry, lie
