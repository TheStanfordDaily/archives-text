# 'Winterset' To Feature Star Cast
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
The Stanford Players' production
of "Winterset," Maxwell Ander
son's prize-winning play, will open
in the Little Theater at 8:15 p.m.
Feb. 4 for a four-day run, according
to Director Betty McGee.
"We're knee-deep in experience,"
stated Miss McGee. "And it's a nice
feeling for any director to have such
competent people in her cast."
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS
In looking over the cast for "Win
terset," Miss McGee's confidence
seems to be justified. For instance,
Nancy DeGroot, who is playing the
ingenuous, imperturbable Miriamne
in this love story, has been seen at
Stanford in "The Devil's Disciple,"
"As You Like It,""The Father,"
"Richard III," and several one-act
plays.
Jack Hume, who will appear in
"Winterset" as the anguished and
vengeful hero of the play, was seen
here in "As You Like It"and sev
eral one-acts, but his most notable
performances were at San Jose Stale
College, where he received his A.8.,
and in the title role of "The Great
Galeoto." which he did at the fa
mous Hill barn Summer Theater.
SUPPORTING CAST
The supporting cast is well
stocked with theatrical veterans.
Jules Irving, who plays Garth, is
a member of Actors' Equity and has
appeared in several Broadway
shows, including "The American
Way," "Something for the Boys,"
and "Brooklyn, U.S.A." Bill Melton,
who has appeared here in "'The Add
ing Machine" and "Macbeth," star
red in Hillbarn's "The Great God
Brown." Hal Todd and Allen
Fletcher, who play Troek and Carr,
have appeared in almost every ma
jor and minor production during the
last year and a half at Stanford.
Todd's Mr. Zero in "The Adding
Machine" was one of the most re
markable performances ever seen
here. Harry Muheim, writer and
director of last year's Spring Show,
is playing Shadow.

One of the most interesting mem
bers of the cast, however, is a rela
tive newcomer to Stanford drama,
Angus Bowmer, whose only previ
ous appearance here was in "Richard
III." Bowmer, who plays Esdras in
"Winterset," is the originator and
director of a summer theater in
Oregon, which is devoted wholly to
Shakespearean production. Besides
directing there, Bowmer has played
most of the great Shakespearean
roles from Shylock to Hamlet.
Tickets for the play are now on
sale at the Memorial Hall offices of
the speech and drama department
at (i0 cents each. They may be re
served by calling Palo Alto 22041.

ing Machine" and "Macbeth," star
red in Hillbarn's "The Great God
Brown." Hal Todd and Allen
Fletcher, who play Troek and Carr,
have appeared in almost every ma
jor and minor production during the
last year and a half at Stanford.
Todd's Mr. Zero in "The Adding
Machine" was one of the most re
markable performances ever seen
here. Harry Muheim, writer and
director of last year's Spring Show,
is playing Shadow.

One of the most interesting mem
bers of the cast, however, is a rela
tive newcomer to Stanford drama,
Angus Bowmer, whose only previ
ous appearance here was in "Richard
III." Bowmer, who plays Esdras in
"Winterset," is the originator and
director of a summer theater in
Oregon, which is devoted wholly to
Shakespearean production. Besides
directing there, Bowmer has played
most of the great Shakespearean
roles from Shylock to Hamlet.
Tickets for the play are now on
sale at the Memorial Hall offices of
the speech and drama department
at (i0 cents each. They may be re
served by calling Palo Alto 22041.
The Stanford Players' production
of "Winterset," Maxwell Ander
son's prize-winning play, will open
in the Little Theater at 8:15 p.m.
Feb. 4 for a four-day run, according
to Director Betty McGee.
"We're knee-deep in experience,"
stated Miss McGee. "And it's a nice
feeling for any director to have such
competent people in her cast."
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS
In looking over the cast for "Win
terset," Miss McGee's confidence
seems to be justified. For instance,
Nancy DeGroot, who is playing the
ingenuous, imperturbable Miriamne
in this love story, has been seen at
Stanford in "The Devil's Disciple,"
"As You Like It,""The Father,"
"Richard III," and several one-act
plays.
Jack Hume, who will appear in
"Winterset" as the anguished and
vengeful hero of the play, was seen
here in "As You Like It"and sev
eral one-acts, but his most notable
performances were at San Jose Stale
College, where he received his A.8.,
and in the title role of "The Great
Galeoto." which he did at the fa
mous Hill barn Summer Theater.
SUPPORTING CAST
The supporting cast is well
stocked with theatrical veterans.
Jules Irving, who plays Garth, is
a member of Actors' Equity and has
appeared in several Broadway
shows, including "The American
Way," "Something for the Boys,"
and "Brooklyn, U.S.A." Bill Melton,
who has appeared here in "'The Add
ing Machine" and "Macbeth," star
red in Hillbarn's "The Great God
Brown." Hal Todd and Allen
Fletcher, who play Troek and Carr,
have appeared in almost every ma
jor and minor production during the
