# Brunn Asked To Defend His Statements
## 
### 
George Brunn, Daily columnist,
will appear before today's class in
Contemporary World Politics at 11
a.m. Graham 11. Stuart, professor of |
the course, has called Brunn to de
fend statements he made about
American policy in his column last
Tuesday.
Last week, Professor Stuart took |
Brunn's column, History, point by !
point* and attempted to show his j
politics class that many of Brunn's
statements were completely erro- i
neous.
Brunn stated that America is fol- i
lowing many of the same tactics |
that it is criticizing in Russian pol
icy.
Professor Stuart did not disagree j
with Brunn's general statement but j
with specific points such as follows: |
"We pay lip service to UN while
informing it that if we don't get cer- j
tain Pacific islands as trusteeships !
we will keep them anyway.
"We attack Vishinsky's abuse of
the veto, but oppose any suggestion l ,
to limit its use."
At the suggestion of many of the [
members of the class, Professor
Stuart has called in Brunn to defend j
his opinions.
