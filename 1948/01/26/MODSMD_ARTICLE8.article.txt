# Academic Freedom Called Essential

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP).â€”
President Truman's Commission on
Higher Education today called for
195,000 more college and university
teachers by 1960 and said increased
salaries arc necessary to reach that
goal.
The commission, in its fourth re
port, also pleaded for academic
freedom, which it called "a prime
essential of a free society.
"Pressures to bend or twist truth,
to stay away from controversial is
sues about which the professor is
competent to speak, or to avoid cer
tain areas of inquiry, arc not com
patible with the ideal of professional
integrity," the commission, headed
by George F. Zook, said.
Asserting that "no society can
long remain free when its educa
tional institutions are not free," it
added, however, that "freedom for
the individual implies also the ac
ceptance of basic attitudes toward
the preservation of democracy." '
