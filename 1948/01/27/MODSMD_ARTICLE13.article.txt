# Fraternity Open Dances February 7
## 
### 
"T5M'\A" that's the key
note of the concurrent all-campus
open dances scheduled by Delta Tau
Delta, Tlieta Xi, Sigma Nu, and Phi
Gamma Delta on Saturday, Feb. 7,
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Representatives from the "top of
the Row" houses met yesterday to
discuss plans for the four-hour rec
ords and refreshments session open
to all Stanford couples.
' We're building our theme around
an old Greek formula," commented
Dave Saunders, Delta Tau Delta,
social chairman, "Plans are strictly
secret, bt we plan to show the
campus a really fine time."
This affair will initiate the new
on-campus social program suggest
ed by Guyla Runyon, ASSU vice
president. "Fraternities are taking
the lead," Miss Runyon said. "We
expect this program to mature into
a weekly series of all-campus open
dances sponsored by at least three
living groups in the same general
area."
When asked for an explanation of
the hierogrlyphic keynote, Bob Mc-
Kim, Theta Xi social chairman, re
plied. "Absolutely no stags!"
"By scheduling concurrent open
dances in the same general area, we
hope to avoid the usual overcrowd
ing," explained Bob Longwell, Sig
ma Nu social chairman.
"As far as the fraternities are
concerned," commented Bob Coate,
Phi Gamma Delta president, "we're
going to do our best to throw a
really red-hot dance. Come early,
stay late, and bring your own date."
