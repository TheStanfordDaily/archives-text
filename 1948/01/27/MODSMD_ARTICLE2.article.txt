# Bletz, Munk In UN Talks
## 
### 
The first meeting of a discussion
group sponsored by the fCC was
held last night under the direction
of Al Munk and Allen Bletz.
The subject of the discussion was
concerned with a comparison be
tween the League of Nations and
the United Nations, and the possi
bility of gaining and keeping a real
peace by working through the UN
or else by working along the famil
iar lines of power politics and un
disputed nationalism.
This topic will be carried over
into next week's meeting, which is
to be held on the third floor of the
Women's Clubhouse at 7:30 Monday
night. These meetings are a sort of
preliminary to the United Nations
Conference, sponsored by lIR,
which will be held at Stanford Feb.
19-22.
