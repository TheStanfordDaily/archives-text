# KSU To Celebrate First Anniversary Today
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
KSU, Stanford's own radio
1 station, is just a year old . . .
a year of difficulties that at
times seemed insurmountable.
Yet KSU is already the leading
commercial college station on
' the Pacific Coast, and has
j served as a springboard to the
j radio industry for many stu
dents.
KSU was organized by a group of
l students interested in professional
i radio experience. Headed by Bob
I Heller, Bill Eilers, and Stove Phil
j lips, the group obtained the studio
in the balcony of the Village Audi
( torium, which had been used for
productions originating from the
Dibble Hospital short-wave station.
ONE MIKE'
The station's original equipment
i consisted of one microphone, a bor
rowed control board, and several
spools of wire. Home-made turn
' tables were devised, and KSU, "590
I on your dial," went on the air from
its 12 x 12 studio.
Desks, typewriters, and office
[ equipment were obtained stealthily
from GI requisitions. The record li
! brary consisted of 50 records, mostly
| from private collections, and it was
{ difficult to provide funds for replac
| ing broken platters. Programs often
went on the air in competition with
I boisterous meetings in the audito
rium.
ADVERTISING
Advertising, too, had to start from
1 scratch, and the few commercial
programs were the only ones sure
j of going on the air; others were fre
j quently impromptu.
The chief commercial program
| was the now - notorious "Your
Clothes Closet," which involved es
say contests, BMOC's opinions of

Stanford women, audience partici
pation shows five times per week,
and unbelievable confusion.
The station's principal anecdote

stems from a recording of this .show,
which had been left on campusâ€”a
fact not discovered until a few min
utes before program time. The in

cident featured a mad auto dash to
(lie campus and back with the rec
ord. and the bearer rushed into the
studio just as the announcer was

j saying, "Due to circumstances be
: yond our control, the program
I scheduled for this time . . . er . . .
ah . . . will now be heard."
Despite frequent technical fail
ures, lack of announcers, funds, and
experience, the station managed to i
stay on the air. Never operating |
entirely at a loss, the meager oper
ating expenses were paid ami fa
cilities were expanded.
DORSEY PREFERRED
Last spring's listener survey indi
cated that students had enough of
education in the daytime and prc
| ferred music and entertainment at
night, so the record libary was aug
mented and at present includes over
2,500 discs. Students covered by
the survey signified they preferred
Dorsey to Stokowski, and variety
shows to round tables.
Advertisers at last began to real
ize the station's value as a campus
advertising medium, and increased
their business three-fold.
At the beginning of spring quar
ter, 1947, the station moved to it?
present location in the Memorial
Hall. New equipment was installed j
j throughout the year, and the staff
I personnel increased from the mini- j
j nal dozen to over 100 persons now
| directly or indirectly engaged in
I broadcasting activities.
RADIO EAR
During the summer, the NBC
Radio Institute at Stanford was af
forded the use of KSU facilities,
| thus making possible a laboratory
for radio on campus.
KSU, under the guidance of Sta- j
tion Manager Steve Phillips and
Faculty Adviser John Zuckerman,
has developed from a typical "small
| station" to the type of organization
found in most large metropolitan |
commercial stations. It provides a
maximum of experience for its stu
dent staff, and a maximum of en
tertainment for its student listeners.
