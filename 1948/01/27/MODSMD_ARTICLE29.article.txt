LAKH SUCCESS, N.Y.. Jan. 20
(UP). The United Nations Pales
tine Commission has agreed that the
situation in Palestine is steadily
worsening and will verge on chaos
when the British give up control of
the Holy Land. ahoul May 15, il was
disclosed lorijghl.
The commission gives this eonclu-*
sion in the first monthly report that
it is preparing behind closed doors
for the UN Security Council.
T[ie commission's report as now
written also refers to the "need" for
an international army to enforce the
partition of Palestine against Arab
objections, it was learned. The com
mission wiil submit a separate, de
tailed report on this security prob
lem.
Commission members, in report
ing on two weeks of secret meetings,
also wiil disclose:
1. Great Britain's Sir Alexander
Cadogan testified thai the Jewish
claim that they were lighting a
purely defense war in Palestine was
not tenable. The Jews, Cadogan
said, are trying to consolidate their
advantages by a succession of dras
tic operations designed to intimidate
die Arabs and cure them of any de

sire for more conflict. Both Jews
and Arabs, he said, are attacking
and carrying on reprisals indistin
guishable from attacks.
2. The Jewish Agency, in addition
to asking the commission to speed
formation of a Jewish militia of
30,000 to 35,000 men, also asked the
commission for an air force. The
Agency wanted two fighter squad
rons (probably totaling about 30
planes), one reconnaissance .squad
ron, two transport squadrons, one
training squadron, and two air liai
son squadrons. This force appar
ently would total about 100 air
craft.
3. Moshe Shertok, representing
the Jewish Agency, predicted that
eventually A.rab opposition to par

lition will fade away. Cadogan,
however, argued that the situation
is getting worse, with courts and
essential services already seriously
crippled. Another British spokes
man, Fletcher Cook, testified that
Arabs make up (52 per cent of the
Palestine government employees,
and (hat none will co-operate with
the UN commission. The commis
sion's arrival in the Holy Land, he
said, will increase the fighting.
This testimony, linked with Arab
threats and the reports of Palestine
fighting, caused the commission to
conclude that the situation in Pales
line is likely to worsen to the verge
of chaos by the time the British
give up their old League of Nations
mandate.
