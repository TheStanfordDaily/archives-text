### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 2(5 (UP).-Hun
dreds of thousands of workers in
six states were laid ofT today as
prolonged cold cut deeper into fuel
supplies and forced industries to
curtail production or shut down.
Meanwhile, the fifth great cold
wave in 13 days pushed southeast
ward into the Midwest and the
weatherman issued a gloomy fore
cast thai sub-normal temperatures
would cover most of the nation for
at least another week.
The new frigid mass of air will
fan out over the East and South
later this week, but will moderate
slightly as it spreads, the U.S.
Weather Bureau said.
The death toll from the long siege
of icy weather rose to 156 today.
The toll included 107 dead in fires
caused by overheated stoves and
furnaces; 22 frozen to death; and
27 deaths in miscellaneous weather
accidents.
The largest industrial shutdowns
were in the automobile manufac
turing center in the Detroit area
and the steel plants of Pittsburgh.
States affected by natural gas short

ayes and shutdowns included Mich
igan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
West Virginia, and New York.
In Pasadena Dr. Irving P. Krick,
noted weather expert at the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology, said
that as far as the weather is con
cerned, the 1947-48 season might
very well he 1911-12. Without mak
ing any predictions for the present
season, Dr. Krick said he found a
situation which reflected conditions
of 1911-12. That winter remained
dry through February and was fol
lowed by a wet cycle in March and
April but not enough to bring the
season's total up to normal.
