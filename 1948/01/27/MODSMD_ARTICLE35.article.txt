# Fall of Franc Hits France, U.S., Britain
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 2(5 (UP).—The full |
of the franc echoed throughout the \
world today.
Premier Robert Schuman told the
Assembly that he had to engineer
the drastic devaluation program or
see factories shut down and work
ers in breadlines. But fears of
equally serious repercussions from
the plan itself were expressed on
both sides of the Atlantic.
The United States warned that
the drastic 44.44 per cent devalua
tion, effective last midnight, might
endanger the Marshall Plan.
Britain's fears were two - fold
that the cut would send the pound
sterling tumbling, and that Britain
would lose foreign trade as the
result of sharp reductions in the
price of French exports, made pos
sible by the "bargain" franc.
The price of gold stocks spurted
upward on three continents in
New York, London, Paris, and Jo
hannesburg, South Africa.
British government stocks broke
on the London Stock Exchange, as
Britain hastily prepared emergency
measues to bolster the pound ster
ling. In New York, however, the
stock market remained generally
stable.
The devaluation was effective as
of last midnight, pegging the ex
port-import franc at 214 to the dol
lar, as compared with the former
1 ID, but the General Assembly still
had to approve a bill setting up a
free market in gold and some for
eign currencies before il became
law.
As debate opened, this approval
was expeeted by a narrow margin.
Schuman, appealing to the As
sembly to enact his program into
law immediately, said the plan was
necessary to put France hack on her
financial feet.
