ST. LOUIS, Jan. 2(i (UP)â€”Martin
J. Monti, who was arrested by G
men on a charge ol treason at Min
eola, N.Y., today, has admitted in
interviews that he made 15 to 20
propaganda broadcasts for Germany
during the war, but said the Nazis
forced him to broadcast wilh "subtle
threats."
Monti is one of five sons of Mr.
and Mrs. Martin A. Monti, Jr., all of
whom served in the U. S. Army
in World War 11. The father is asso
ciated with a brokerage firm here.
Monti, of Italian descent, returned
and told newsmen of his experiences
in Germany. He was a 2nd lieuten
ant in the Army Air Forces during
the war.
He said he had been sent to India,
became bored and had hitch-hiked
by air to Italy, where he had visited
in 19.'J9. While there, he said, he
spotted a P-38 on a U. S. Army air
field and decided to take a pleasure
ride.
He said he wrote some of the pro
grams he broadcast, including one
which told of allied borfibings of
Germany. He said the bombing
script was approved by the Nazis
because it described "murder" of
Germans and showed the high mor
ale of the Nazis. Actually, he said,
he wrote the script in such a way
that the U.S. would know how ef
fective the bombings were.
