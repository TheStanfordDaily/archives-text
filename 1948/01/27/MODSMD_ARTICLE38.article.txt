hulfjj and then put on the gas to
i up to their second straight mural
vn. J|
Slim Jim Bradshaw was the swift -
l swisher of the night as he poured
seven field goals and four free
irows for IS points. Bradshaw also
jund time to bottle up Dekelet ace
lobby Driscoll, who was held to
mly four points.
/ONE DEFENSE EFFECTIVE
The Dekelet zone defense was ef
fective in the early part of the game,
ljut Cracker-Jack Crahan and Don
fly lies doubled up on the little Dekes
to score four quick buckets that
started the Delts on their way.
Hynes hit for 10 points, mostly on
tips, and Cracker-Jack was next on
the scoring list with seven.
With their win over the Dekelets,
the Delts look good enough to go
all the way in their league. How
ever, they will have to get, by the
strong Phi Delt Trojans and the
rocket-fast Chinese Club in their
next two outings.
1)1! HOTDOGS WIN
A 1 Laakso scored 12 points, as he
led his DU between-the-bun boys to
a 27 to !7 victory over the Fijis in
the feature game at the Pavilion last
night. It was the second straight win
for the Hotdogs.
Marvin Irvin kept the Fijis in the
ball game by flint of his sterling de
fensive play, and also added a little
offensive punch with seven hard
earned digits. Cherokee Charlie
Burnett and Jack Barnes both turn
ed in good performances, but they
couldn't quite cut the mustard on
the Hot Dogs..
Smiling Al Laakso, hotsy-totsy
point pusher for the DU's has been
high point man in every game lie has
played this season, and has a 13
point average in league play.
ALPHA DELTS WIN
Fred Loomis and Lou Saxby led
the Alpha Delta Phi to a 36 to 18
victory over the Maulers. The Alpha
Delts had things well under control
during the entire game and were
never threatened. The half time
score was 18 to 4.
The Phi Delt Rams pounded the
Kappa Alphas into submission in
another one of last night's mural
cage tilts. Jim Burke notched 15
points for the winners and Phi Delt
Bill Prince and George Lidcile turn
ed in good performances in defens
ive play as the Phi Delts went on
to win 27 to 16.
Til ETA DELTS EDGE ATO'S
Theta Delta Chi lasted to nudge
the ATO's last night 20 to 14 in a
rough and tumble tussle that almost
ended in a riot. Bullet Bob Ander
son looped in six digits to pace the
Theta Delt attack, and teammate
Bob Ghilotti was right behind him
with four.
Both clubs wasted scoring time
while exchanging menacing scowls
at one another, but the game was
close and existing all the way. Bad
Hemic Wagner led ATO scorers
with four points.
The half-time score was 10 to 5
in favor of the ATO's, but the Theta
Delts recovered to slowly gain the
lead in the closing stages of the
game. Then in the last two minutes,
Theta Delta Chi clinched the con
test with the six points that were
the margin of victory.

In the first game at the Village
Gym the 312 Wheels defeated the
108 Legal Eagles 20 to 7 in fast but
erratic play. Very few shots were
j made from a set position, the de
; lenses of both teams covering elose
ly.
The outcome of the game was
never in doubt. The 312 Wheels led
13 to 3 at the hall. Joe Kegler made
the only field goal lor the losers in
the first half, while Leland Town
i send, tall center for the Wheels,
scored eight of the 13 points for
the winners.
In the second half Bub Kistler
settled down for the Eagles and
j scored two baskets on lay-up shots.
His good defensive play kept Town
send from scoring in the second
I half.
Bob Parkhill turned in a good
I game on both offense and defense
for the Wheels. He continually
j broke up the attack of the Eagles.
The Wheels had another ball
hawk in Bloombere at guard. He
managed to cut in for some neatly
handled lay-up .shots. Joe Burns
' and Parkhill also scored for the
Wheels.
And the Aged and Decrepit doub
led the score of the 119 Blues to win
30 to 15. T. S. Ary was the old
[ men's chief proint-getter. putting
the ball through the hoop for 12
j points.
SAE'S IN 53 TO 20 WIN
The SAE's quintet had little
trouble in handling the "Too Hot
to Handle" aggregation in one of
the final tilts of last night's sched
uled games. The SAE's, led by
Chauncey Lease, who hit the hoop
for 13 points, and Dick Stoddard,
who collected an even dozen, drop
ped the THTH 53 to 20. Frank Ca
sella, Jim Rose, and Jim Brett were
stalwarts in the SAE defense.

! gri-La whipped 308, 33 to 19. Dick
