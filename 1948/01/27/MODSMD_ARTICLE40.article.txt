# Poloists Coast To 16-2 Win
## 
### 
In its first match of the winter i
season, the Stanford polo team j
soundly trounced the Palo Alto '
Ranchers, 1G to 2, in a five-chukker j
match on the Stanford polo field j
Sunday morning.
The Farm poloists caught their
opponents by surprise when they
took command of the ball at the
throw-in and turned the very first
play into a goal. This started a scor
ing spree which netted an average
of three goals per chukker.
Forwards Bill Decker and Todd j
Helser accounted for most of the 1
team's goals while a very tight de
fense on the part of Bill Foster and 1
Bob Lawson held the Palo Alto
team in check.
A relatively large number of goals J
made by the backs indicate an ex
cellent interchange of positions and
teamwork, which had previously
been a weak spot in tht Farm play.
Besides accuracy, in hitting and 1
set-ups, the players lining out ;
on offense and pairing off on de
fense much better than last season. '
The great improvement seen Sun- j
day is due largely to practice given
the team in scrimmages with the j
second string of Bob Stowell, Bill j
Ross, Rufus Hayden, and John
Crown.
Palo Alto will be out for revenge
when they return for a rematch
next week.
