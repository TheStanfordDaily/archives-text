# VARSITY CAGE
## Indians Prepare for Weekend Contests with Dons, Tigers 
### 
Most of Stanford's varsity cagers
got a well-earned clay of rest yester
day while the junior varsity scrim
maged against the freshmen.
Full-scale operations will resume
today, according to Coach Everett
Dean, in preparation for this week
cud's games against College of Pa
cific and the University of San
Francisco.
There is every expectation that
Stanford will be at full strength for
these games, for the first time since
early in the season. George Yard
ley, out of the Cow Palace games
with the flu, took a light workout
yesterday.
THOMPSON RETURNS
Morley Thompson, the other man
on last week's sick list, will prob
ably be able to go onto the floor
against the Tigers and Dons.
Dave Davidson made it clear Sat
urday night that he is back in form
by scoring 15 points. And if Babe
Higgins is still suffering from his
charley horse, there was no evidence
of it at the Cow Palace.
Although the Indians looked im

pressive in beating Sanla Clara and
St. Mary's, neither of this week's
opponents should be written off as
i a pushover.
COP has a speedy club with a
good record, including a victory
over the Sacramento Senators. And
Pete Newell's USF outfit is not
known as the "Giant-killers" for
nothing.
CARDS FAVORED
Nonetheless Stanford will go into
both games as the favorite. The In
dians could practically have named
their own score against Santa Clara,
but instead of pouring it on. Dean's
policy is to give his. reserves game
experience.
Sixteen men appeared in the
Bronco game, as the Stanford coach
cleared the bench in the last live
minutes when the Farm quintet was
leading by 21 points, and the margin
was growing steadily.
After the weekend games, the
Deanmen will take on Bradley Tech,
a good middlewestern team, next
! Tuesday.
