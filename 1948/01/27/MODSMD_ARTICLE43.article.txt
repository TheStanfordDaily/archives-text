# Demaret Three Strokes Ahead in Phoenix Meet
## 
### 
PIIOENIX. Ariz., Jan. 25 (UP).—
The colorfully dressed fashion-plate
of the fairways, Jimmie Demaret,
Ojai, California, held a three-stroke
lead with I£B today at the end of
54 holes of play in the $10,000 Phoe
nix Open Golf Tournament.
As the fieid of 72 top pros and
amateurs went into the final round,
the man who brought plus - fours
back into golf, Bobby Locke, Johan
nesburg, South Africa, was trailing
by three strokes.
The colorful Demaret stands well
to better the course record for 72

holes. All he had to do was shoot a
71 in the second of today's 18-hole
rounds and he would better the 270
scored by the bantam blaster, Ben
Hogan, Hershey, Pa., when he won
the 1947 Phoenix event.
Hogan, seeking his third consecu
tive Phoenix victory, was virtually
out of the running, with a three
round even par total of 210. Hogan
has been nursing a badly scorched
left thumb, burned the day before
the tournament started when a pack
of safety matches ignited in his
hand.
