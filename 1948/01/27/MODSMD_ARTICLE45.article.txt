# Frosh to Vie With Piedmont
## 
### 
Piedmont High School is next on
the list of the Freshmen Basketball
ers with the Frosh slated to meet
the East Bay lads in the preliminary
to the Stanford-University of Sun
Francisco contest on Saturday.
Jack Dana's yearlings have gone
two weeks without a game and the
young mentor is putting his squad
through long daily practice sessions
in hopes of keeping the winning
habit strong with his lads.
The Freshmen have won five out
of their six tilts thus far this year,
the only loss being a 31 to 27 affair
to Lincoln High School of San Fran
cisco.
Although Lincoln has continued
on its winning' ways, and now tops
the AAA league in the City, Coach
Dana feels that his team would come
out on top if the two squads were
to play again.
After the Piedmont tilt on Satur
day, the Frosh will meet San Mateo
Junior College on Tuesday in the
preliminary to the Stanford-Brad
ley game.

Jan. 31—Piedmont U.S.
Feb. 3—San Mateo JC.
Feb. 7—Palo Alto U.S.
Feb. 14—San Francisco City Col.
Feb. 21 —Marin JC.
Feb. 27—Mission.
