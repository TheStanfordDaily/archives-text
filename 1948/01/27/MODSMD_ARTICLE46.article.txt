SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 26 (UP).
-George Quist, Stanford fullback,
and Fred Land, Louisiana State
tackle, today were signed to profes
sional football contracts with the
San Francisco Forty-niners of the
All-America Conference.
Coach Lawrence T. (Buck) Shaw
said Quist should give the Forty
niners "added strength on offense
. . . he has what it takes to be a
good pro football player."
Quist, who played for California
in 1!)45 and for Stanford in 1946-47,
was one of the standout backs in
the Shrine East-West game here on
New Year's Day.
Land, a 230-pound All-Southeast
ern Conference star for the last two
years, was the outstanding linesman
for LSU last season.
(Kumnrs of the tie-up between
the blond halfback and the Forty
niners began circulating shortly
after the Big Game, hut were
emphatically denied by Owner
Tony Morabito.)
