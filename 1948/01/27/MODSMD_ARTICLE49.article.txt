Of the numerous small organizations on
campus the Camera Club is particularly to be
commended.
Membership benefits, such as the exchange
of ideas and the pleasure of knowing people
with similar interests, are the primary purposes
of such a group. The Camera Club, however,
will contribute directly to the benefit of the
whole campus today with the opening of their

exhibit at the Art Gallery.
Previously an annual show of the work of
the art department and staff has been the only
student effort exhibited. Now the Camera Club
has entered the field, permanently, we hope.
It is a pleasure to see recognition given to
a small group, and to see that group take full
advantage of it, to the welfare of all concerned.
