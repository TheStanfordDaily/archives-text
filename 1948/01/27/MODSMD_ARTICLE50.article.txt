## History Dispute 
### 
To the Editor:
In ;iii article appropriately titled "History 1948'
(Jan. 21), Mr. Allen Bletz elaborated on Secretary
Marshall's; endorsement of the study of history as a
help in solving present problems, and also his criticism
of how history is being taught. Mr. Bletz's most im
portant points, in my estimation, were that (1) his
tory is often taught unintelligently in high schools, and
that (2) historical ignorance is due at least in part
to ". . . dull recitations, memorized, delivered, and
forgotten. . that "memorization, obscure facts, and
irrelevant material are drilled into the student," that
college history faculties often emphasize ". . . obsolete
(?) dates, listing kings in order, and memorization."
Later on he concedes that ". . . a few dates and events
are important and they should be learned, but the
number of these are very small (?) and they should
be used only to buttress the complete (?) picture (?)."
The question marks are mine.
I don't understand what an "obsolete date" is;
perhaps something like an obsolete atomic bomb, or
that ilk. Also, 1 don't see how a complete picture or
even a rough sketch of any sort of history can be
given on a "few" facts whose number is "very small."
I think this is rather the formula for a student's ex
amination answer: lots of bull, a very small number of
facts. As to high school, I would agree that history
is largely mishandled, resulting in ignorance and apa
thy, although I suppose a comparison of the charges
with actualities would result in verdicts from "under
statement" to "slander" depending on whose class
was visited.
However, I cannot follow out Mr. Bletz's injunc
tion when he says"And believe me—the great major
ity of colleges employ history faculties—instructors to
full professors -and they teach with a total disregard
to the broad overall picture of history; they emphasize
obsolete dates, listing kinds in order, and memoriza
tion." Besides asking Mr. Bletz what the full pro
fessors are full of, one would want to ask him what
the overall picture of history consists of and whether
history repeats itself, and whether sociology doesn't
cover those "overall" aspects that Mr. Bletz postu
lates, and more bitterly, how he came to the conclu
sion that all (since no qualifying word, such as "some,"
was used in the above direct quotation concerning the
disregarders of the broad, etc.) history teachers oper
ate in the manner described.
My experience, and that is why I write this letter,
has been quite otherwise. To say that Western Civ is
taught with a "total disregard" to the broad overall
picture, or the equivalent course at Columbia Uni
versity does likewise, is a joke to every veteran of
those broadest of broad courses on history. Some
of the broad generalties bandied about in those courses
often smack of being "obsolete" facts, and the causes
for some of the wars and movements are often harder
to remember than a mere list of kings.
If Mr. Bletz objects to the teaching of history on
a national or period basis, then there are several hun
ched students trying to understand the history of
nations and periods who object presumably to Mr.
Bletz's objection.
History cannot be all things to all men. There arc
books that deal with broad generalties, but not all
historians agree with the conclusions in those books.
There arc books on specific aspects of history, and not
evt ryone agrees with their subject analysis either.
History is more of a dynamic and fluid subject than
Mr. Bletz realizes. It seems that the only way a person
can decide on the broad generalities is to deduce and
induce them from factual information that cannot be
used if it isn't remembered, or if its existence isn't
remembered.
In my experience, history courses are taught in
this light. This is a more liberal (in the good old sense)
view of education than just pumping generalities in
to the bursting point. It is my opinion that the aim of
history-learning is not to give a picture, though that
comes incidentally, but to enable one to think clearly
enough, and have the necessary fact-gathering ability,
to make a picture of history to suit oneself, hoping that
it will have some relevance to the truth as we can
come to know it.
I think Mr. Bletz's article rested on a large confu
sion: that of the "teaching" of history for the "exam
inations in history" which are the real sore-spots in
our system. Hardly anyone cares what the professor
says, but quails at what he asks. The academic alpha
betic sword hanging over the student's head is a vital
question for all of us. An interesting article from Mr.
Bletz would be on history examinations and how they
should be graded.
1 would like to cast one more pearl. Mr. Bletz
says that ". . . if there was some way . . . of bring
ing the students to a little better perception through
some graphic means, of what happened in Greece and
Rome and the other crucial points in history, about
three-fourths of the speeches would be eliminated in
Congress. They would know that these speeches had
already been said and very well said many times in
the past." Did that ever stop any congressman?
1 think a course on atomic physics for congressmen
would be much more efficient in cutting down the
verbiage. There is an alternate interpretation of the
above passage: if congressmen studied the speeches
crucial to Greek and Roman history, the House Com
mittee on Antiquity might find those speeches un-
American. HENRY T BERNSTEIN.
