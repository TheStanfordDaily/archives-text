# Thanks Ted Norton
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I .should like. through The Daily, to thank ;i Mr.
Tod Norton (whom I do not know) for his thoughtful
answer to a recent query of mine on present-day
student political analysis. . .
The impulse of my letter .... was simply to draw
out a cross-section of opinion and. perhaps help to
ileal thought by requesting an answer.
Many people (alums and emeritus) have been

appreciative of Mr. Norton's exhibition of clear, [
patient, responsible analysis, and endorse his implied j
conclusions. Since 1 discover that he is one of those :
whom all alums admire .... I can only hope that J
such second-hand response is some reward for time
spent.
The Daily's reward for print-space spent may be ]
to learn the wide range of readers it has, including
its open column. We less-thoughtful rush into it
easily, I commend that column to thoughtful writers
also . . .
DARE STARK McMULLIN.
