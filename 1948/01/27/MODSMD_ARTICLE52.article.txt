To the Editor:
Excom's professed lack of faith in the ability of
the student body to elect a qualified NSA Chairman
reflects directly on itself. In view of the fact that
Ginny Titus, NSA Chairman, approves the election of
future NSA chairmen, it is unfortunate that Excom
does not have equal confidence in those who elected
them. This attitude is not new to Excom, nor for that
matter to political organizations in general, for it
seems that elected officers frequently reach the con
clusion that the voters aren't capable of electing suit
able leaders —and after all, they should know.
Regarding the question of allowing partisan political ■
parties freedom of speech and assembly on campus, I
would like to add a few remarks to the well presented
letters of Messrs. Vollmer and Otaker in Thursday's
Campus Opinion. Actual experience is the best train
ing for any job, and we are presumably being trained
here at Stanford to become better citizens and intel
ligent voters. Therefore, is it not ridiculous to pre
vent the representatives of political parties from ex
pressing their views on campus? Arc we to become
political anchorites?
A negative answer to the question of partisan
political parties on the campus will settle nothing.
On the other hand if the University finds it necessary
to ban political parties from the campus (and there
appear to be adequate arguments for such a stand on
the basis of several unfortunate experiences at the
University of Chicago), it should endeavor at least
to substitute a program of planned political debates
between presidential candidates where both sides will
be presented.
This action would be an aid to such courses as
"Political Parties" and would thereby help to bring
theory and practice closer together on the Farm. To
deny us any and all forms of political contact is an
insult to our intelligence, whereas University sponsored
political debates would be a part of our education as
at Oxford, England.
This would avoid such farces as the Henry Wallace
curbstone address at Cal, which cast a shadow of
intolerance upon educational institutions.
