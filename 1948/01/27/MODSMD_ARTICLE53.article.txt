# Sophomore Class
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We had hoped that it would not have been nec
essary to write another letter, but we feel by the
nature of Friday's Campus Opinion that the council,
and probably much of the student body, are not fa
miliar with the principles on which we base our j
appeal, and are, therefore, misinterpreting our purpose. !
The truth of the matter is that we are not, as [
stated, attempting to "get off easier" or, primarily, |
alleviate the apportionment of the Sophomore class.
Ours is a fight in behalf of legal and student rights,
not a dogmatic attempt to exonerate our class, re
gardless of time and method. We feel that it is
student government and the Associated Students of
Stanford University which have suffered by this
decision and the method, deliberate or otherwise,
used in its arrival.
We believe that this decision was reached with- j
out representation, and punishment levied without 1
self-expression rights which are granted individuals j
and organized groups by the Stanford Constitution, j
Yes, we know that it is stoutly maintained that evi
dence was heard, but is this true?
Only a small minority of the joint councils heard
evidence, and that, the only evidence considered, was
presented at the Pajamarino Committee meetings.
This small council minority, who had plausibly formu
lated opinions and reached certain conclusions re- I
yarding the matter, then returned to the balance of j
the council with the evidence heard, now undoubted- ;
ly and naturally influenced in some part by bias. In j
other words, evidence was not presented directly to i
the entile council sitting as a body, so that each would j
be free to formulate an opinion after weighing the |
facts impartially and individually.
We further believe that evidence presented in
behalf of living groups by representatives of living
groups can not be deemed conclusive and legal when
judgment is to be made upon classes. Under this
interpretation, evidence should have been presented
by classes, thus respecting and legally acknowledging
the fact that it was now classes on trial.
We are not trying to embarrass the judicial coun- |
cil, or, under coercion, force a reopening of the
case. Wo believe that due to the complications and j
confusion which surrounded this entire problem, the |
legal right of a fair and just hearing may have un
intentionally been overlooked in the alacrity employed j
to close this mess once and for all.
If we are given an opportunity to present our case, j
with all of (he evidence heard directly by each indi- j
vidual council member, we will certainly abide by I
the decision reached. Then we, and Ihe rest of campus, 1
will know that jusliee, whether favorable or not, I
has been rendered, after due respect has been paid to
the light of appeal and self expression granted to all j
constitutionally.
Curs is a case of principle not of material fact.
The Sophomore Committee of
Pajamarino Decision. J
