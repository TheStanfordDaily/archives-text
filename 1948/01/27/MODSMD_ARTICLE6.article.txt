# Many Students Earn Their Way
## 
### 
Forty-nine per cent of Stanford's
8.100 students earn part or all of
their college expenses, revealed
Mrs. Clot ildo Edwards, head of the
student employment service. The
demand for jobs through the stu
dent employment office has far out
stripped supply.
More jobs are urgently needed if
the office is to find work for all ap
plicants, she said. The most popu
lar type of job is manual labor for
men students, but applicants have a
diversity of skills which enables
the office to fill almost any request
from an employer, she added.
Data from questionnaires filled
out registration day show that .'55
per cent of the students are earn
ing more than half of , their ex
penses this quarter. Most of these
students are men, as only nine per
cent of women students earn as
much as half their living costs.
Seven hundred students have al
ready indicated they will seek work
this quarter through the employ
ment office. An additional 16 per
cent declared at registration time
that the office had already helped
them find jobs.
