### 
PARIS, Jan. 27 (UP) —The finance committee of the National
Assembly today rejected Premier Robert Schuman's proposal
to legalize trading in gold and forgive Frenchmen who have been
hiding foreign assets. It brought Schuman's Government to a
crisis that could result in its falling.

Legalization of gold trading and
the forgiving of holders of hidden
foreign assets were the cornerstone
of Schuman's franc devaluation pro
gram. He cuk the value of the franc
nearly in luilf by decree yesterday,
but the renpainder of the program
had to be approved by the National
Assembly.
The Socialists, who have solidly
supported him up to now, joined
with the Communists on the finance
committc • in voting against the pro
posals, 21-1 1 with one abstention.
This automa;ti<-;:'ly killed the bills.
A check-up ,! owed the Socialists
were more opposed to letting hoard
ers of foreign assets bring them
home at the cost of a 25 per cent tax
than to free trading in gold. Schu
man said they were both essential
to the iraii'j devaluation program,
because they were necessary to get
the assets arid gold out of hiding and
provide a soJid base for paper money.
lie called his cabinet into extra
ordinary session at 8 p.m. His only
hope was introducing the bills
again before (he whole assembly, as
they were rejected or in modified
form, and lev 1 his government stand
or hill on the outcome.
He could thus override the deci
sion of the committee. On the other
hand, if they failed to pass, he and
his government would be bound to
resign.
