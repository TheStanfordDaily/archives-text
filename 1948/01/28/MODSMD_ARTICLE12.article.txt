# Lovell Cites Marx, Freud
## 'American Scribes Split Over Policy' 
### 
The combined influence of Karl
| Marx and Sigmund Freud seem to
; have dominated American literature
{ of the last two decades, Dr. John
Lovell Jr., associate professor of
English at Howard University, told
his Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night in Memorial Audito
rium. He was speaking on "Con
temporary American Literature."
Writing today, he said, revolves
around the concepts of possessions
and emotionsâ€”whether our country
} has benefited from the practice of
| individual ownership and whether
| American life as we know it is a
j mere substitute for the real emo
j tional greatness that is lacking.
"The thing has resolve itself into
: a debate between two great groups
i of American writers," said Dr. Lov
j ell, "with eminent writers support
ing both sides."
i Such authors as Carl Sandburg,
Stephen Vincent Benet, and John
P. Marquand, he declared, support
j the idea of individual wealth, as
[ sei'ting that it is a means to great
| ness and good character, and justi
; fies the ways of God to man.
The writings of James T. Farrell,
Richard Wright, and Maxwell An
derson, on the other hand, suggest
; that the right of one person to build
! up riches condemns another to star
vation.
Some writers, Dr. Lovell said in
regard to American emotions, "have
i found America a tainted place in
which to live, claiming that we are
a land of emotional barrenness."
| Others have found that America has
a big heart and real emotional
i greatness.
