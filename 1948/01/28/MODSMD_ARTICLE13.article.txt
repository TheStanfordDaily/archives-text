# WOW! WHAT A WHALE OF A TALK!
## U.S. ‘Surrounded’ by Blubber As Spouters Hit Both Coasts 
### 
BRICK TOWNSHIP, N. J., Jan. I
27 (UP)—The Coast Guard was j
ice-bound and municipal author-!
ities v/ere stymied but private ]
enterprise came to the rescue
tonight in "Operation Moby
Dick," the removal of the cacass
of a 40-ton whale stuck on the j
beach here.
The 6'5-foot-long mammal was I
washed ashore early Sunday morn
ing. For two days it was a source
of much community entertainment
and merriment. Children pranced up
and down its back and the more en
terprising cut strips from its sides
for a taste of blubber steak.
Rut 112 or w a r d thinking citizens j
looked ahead to the summer days
when an aging whale carcass would j
no longer be a source of joy. Brick
Township appealed to the Coast
Guard to remove the whale.
A small Coast Guard vessel tried !
tugging the mammal out of the sand I
but didn't have the power. Then il
was decided to employ an 83-foot '
Coast Guard cutler but ice along the I
shore made that operation impos- |
sible.
So the Coast Guard was happy to
forget the whole matter when the
R. L. Guttridgc company of Plain- i
fild, N. J.. which can convert a whale j
into marketable oil, offered to take ;
over the job of whale removal.
Tomorrow a crew of four or five i
men will take a motor-driven power 112
saw to the Brick Township beach I
and slice the whale into about 10
pieces, each weighing some 8.000
pounds. Then they will use a crane
to lift each whale slice up onto a
heavy truck and cart it off to the
rendering plant at Plainfield.
The whale costs them absolutely

nothing, the Guttridge company said,
but after taking a lo»k at it today
they're still not sure they're getting
a bargain.
If the slicing operation fails, it
may be necessary to put dynamite
in the carcass and set it off—"there
she blows."
