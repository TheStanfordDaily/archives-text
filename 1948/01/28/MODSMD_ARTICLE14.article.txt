Hunter's Point naval shipyard.
The first ive whale seen in San

! mammal slipped between two in
! activated ships and was unable to
j get out.
It thrashed against the ships,
| dived HO feet to the bottom, then
; returned to the surface to spout,
j Some of the 200 workers lining the
[ dock to watch the trapped whale
i claimed it was covered with bar
i naclcs.
Shipyard officials said they were

' will attempt to guide it out tomor-
I row with a small boat.
