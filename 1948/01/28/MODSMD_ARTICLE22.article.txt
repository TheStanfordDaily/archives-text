# Germany to Have Civilian Control
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP)-Secretary of the Army Kenneth
j C. Royall announced tonight that "on or about July 1," the Army
will turn over the military government of Germany to the State
Department. The decision was reached after recent conferences
were attended by Royall, Scretary of State George C. Marshall,

1 and Gen. Lucius D. Clay, U.S. Mili
! tary Governor in Germany.
It came after two and a half years
of strenuous efforts by the Army to
gel rid of the responsibility for mili
| tary government in Germany espec
ially, and in all occupied areas gen
erally. No plans are yet formulated
I for changes in military governments
' in Korea and Japan.
The announcement by Royall came
| about two weeks after Marshall told
j Congress that the new "target date"
over the transfer of Germany was
| June 30.
CONTINUE OCCUPATION
The decision will end division of
responsibility in Germany. Until
now, the state department has form
ulated U.S. policy there but the Ar
my has had to carry it out. Hence
forth, the State Department will do
. both, although the miiltary job of
I occupation will still be done by the
] Army.
There was no official indication
who will take over the top job from
! Clay, who announced last summer
that he intends to retire. But there
has been speculating that he might
be persuaded to carry on as a re
tired Army officer.
Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, now
i U.S. Ambassador to Russia, also has
j been mentioned. Another possibility,
on an interim basis, is Ambassador
j Robert D. Murphy, who has been
j Clay's top political adviser ever since
i Germany's surrender.

ARMY CRITICIZED
The Army's announcement was
made less than a week after bitter
criticism of its operations in Ger
many by Republican John Foster
Dulles. He told Congressional com
mittees on the Marshal Plan that the
civilian-military division of author
ity should end at once.
The final state-army agreement
was reached while Clay was here
last week to testify on the Marshall
Plan. His performance in Germany
was staunchly defended by both
Royal! and Marshall.
There was no immediate explana
tion what will be done about U.S.
representation on the Allied Control
Council in Berlin which heretofore
has been composed of the Big Four
military commanders.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, first
American commander in Berlin af
ter the German surrender, started
the Army campaign to turn the mili
tary government over to the State
Department. At Potsdam, in the
summer of 1945, Eisenhower got
President Truman to agree to the
change "at the earliest possible mo
ment."

last week to testify on the Marshall
Plan. His performance in Germany
was staunchly defended by both
Royal! and Marshall.
There was no immediate explana
tion what will be done about U.S.
representation on the Allied Control
Council in Berlin which heretofore
has been composed of the Big Four
military commanders.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, first
American commander in Berlin af
ter the German surrender, started
the Army campaign to turn the mili
tary government over to the State
Department. At Potsdam, in the
summer of 1945, Eisenhower got
President Truman to agree to the
change "at the earliest possible mo
ment."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP)-Secretary of the Army Kenneth
j C. Royall announced tonight that "on or about July 1," the Army
will turn over the military government of Germany to the State
Department. The decision was reached after recent conferences
were attended by Royall, Scretary of State George C. Marshall,

1 and Gen. Lucius D. Clay, U.S. Mili
! tary Governor in Germany.
It came after two and a half years
of strenuous efforts by the Army to
gel rid of the responsibility for mili
| tary government in Germany espec
ially, and in all occupied areas gen
erally. No plans are yet formulated
I for changes in military governments
' in Korea and Japan.
The announcement by Royall came
| about two weeks after Marshall told
j Congress that the new "target date"
over the transfer of Germany was
| June 30.
CONTINUE OCCUPATION
The decision will end division of
responsibility in Germany. Until
now, the state department has form
ulated U.S. policy there but the Ar
my has had to carry it out. Hence
forth, the State Department will do
. both, although the miiltary job of
I occupation will still be done by the
] Army.
There was no official indication
who will take over the top job from
! Clay, who announced last summer
that he intends to retire. But there
has been speculating that he might
be persuaded to carry on as a re
tired Army officer.
Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, now
i U.S. Ambassador to Russia, also has
j been mentioned. Another possibility,
on an interim basis, is Ambassador
j Robert D. Murphy, who has been
j Clay's top political adviser ever since
i Germany's surrender.

ARMY CRITICIZED
The Army's announcement was
made less than a week after bitter
criticism of its operations in Ger
many by Republican John Foster
Dulles. He told Congressional com
mittees on the Marshal Plan that the
civilian-military division of author
ity should end at once.
The final state-army agreement
was reached while Clay was here
last week to testify on the Marshall
Plan. His performance in Germany
was staunchly defended by both
Royal! and Marshall.
