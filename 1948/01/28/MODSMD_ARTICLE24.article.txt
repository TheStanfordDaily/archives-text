## President Appoints McCabe Chairman 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP).â€”
Chairman Marriner S. Eccles of the
Federal Reserve Board, whose rug
ged anti-inflation proposals have
affected the nation's bankers and
stock exchanges, was notified by
President Truman today that
Thomas B. McCabe will take over
the chairmanship on Feb. 1.
Eccles will stay on as board vice
chairman, a demotion he accepted
amicably after conferences with the
President.
McCabe, Chester, Pa., paper man
ufacturer and chairman of the Phil
adelphia Federal Reserve Bank, was
nominated yesterday to a board va
cancy caused by the death of Vice-
Chairman Ronald Ranson, and still
must be confirmed by the Senate.
SURPRISE MOVE
Mr. Truman's surprise move was
carried out in the most friendly at
mosphere. He and Eccles, one-time
Utah banker and New Deal head of
the Reserve System for 12 years,
exchanged felicitous letters, giving
no clue of trouble.
On the other side of the ledger,
Eccles has clashed repeatedly with
the conservative banking fraternity,
heads of the stock markets, and
Congressional advocates of free en
terprise.
RECENT CLASH
The Federal Reserve {.'hief recent
ly collided with Secretary of the
Treasury John W. Snyder over anti
inflation measures. Eccles, ever on
the alerl against inflationary credit,
urged Congress to require banks to
set aside special reserve funds to
dry up some of the ready money
available for lending.
The stock market rose on the an
nouncement that he was being eased
out of the chairmanship.
