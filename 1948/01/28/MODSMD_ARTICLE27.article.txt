SAN KHANCJSCO. Jan. 27 (UP).
Dust .storms and a freezing snap
â–  combined with the worst state-wide
J drought in 70 years today to pro
duce a freak weather pattern and
threaten California with water unci
power shortages and extensive
damage to its multi-million-dollar
crops,
N<> immediate relief from the
month - long mid - winter dry spell
was in sight, Weather Bureau fore
casters said as some California
cities, faced with dwindling sup
plies in reservoirs, began rationing
water. Power shortages were pre
dicted if the drought continues.
