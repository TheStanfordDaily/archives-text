# WARREN FOR RELIEF, BUT ...
## Governor Advocates Aid On Year-to-Year Basis 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27 (UP) Gov. Earl Warren, an announced j
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, today
qualified his support of the Marshall Plan by stating that appro-!
priations for European aid should be on a year-to-year basis.
Warren said he does not believe Congress should commit this

country to a four or five year prog-*
lam, but should review the prospects
for success of the entire plan each
year before making available addi- |
tional money.
"And I hose prospects must be de- !
termined largely by the self-help j
that is generated in the countries |
being helped, and by the effect on !
our own economy as well" as the !
needs of the various countries
abroad," he added.
Warren also reiterated his belief j
that Congress should pass a uni- j
versal military training bill "at an |
early date," but declined to com- i
ment on reports that the UMT bill
was being "stalled" in the House 1
rules committee.
Warren also told his press con
ference today that he does not de
sire his name to be placed in the '
Wisconsin presidential primary on j
April (!.
Commenting on reports that Wis
consin backers of (len. Dwight D. j
Eisenhower might switch their sup- i
port to him. Warren said that if they
approached him he would tell them j
he does not wish to run in any state
primaries outside of California.
