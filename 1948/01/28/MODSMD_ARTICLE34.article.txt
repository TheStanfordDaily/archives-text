## Stanford Receives $50,000 For Research and Training 
### 
Dr. Harold K. Faber, head of the Stanford Medical School's
department of pediatrics, is working under a $19,850 research
grant from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, an
nounced Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, University president, yesterday.
Dr. Fuber's work includes a study of the refractory state set up
against polio by the body alter ex- 1

posure to tho virus via the nose and
mouth. This study, it is hoped, will
lead to a practicable method of pre
vention.
I'SKS MONKEYS
Dr. Faber is also tracing the
modes ot ingress and egress of the
virus alter its application to body
surfaces and individual nerves, us
ing monkeys for patients.
Dr. faber has been occupied with
research work on polio since 1932.
He has been head of the Stanford
Medical School department of pe
diatrics since ]823.
The remainder of the $55,000
March of Dimes grant, to the Uni
versity is to be used as instruction
funds for Stanford's School of Phys
cal Therapy is turning out 60 gradu
ca! Therapy is truing out 60 gradu
ates yearly under a March of Dimes
gran! which contributes $.'lO,OOO an
nually to the school for a live-year
period.

The Physical Therapy division also
ha.s been awarded a $0,000 grant to
share in nationwide tests on a "myo
dynameterfi" a machine devised to
test the strength of muscles in terms;
of pounds. Other physical therapy

units in other sections of the coun
try are conducting similar tests on !
this new machine, and (he results j
will he pooled to determine the ef
fectiveness of the new equipment in \
the treatment of polio patients.
Besides training physical thera
pists, serving as a teaching clinic,
and training teachers in physical ,
therapy, the School of Physical !
Therapy stands ready as a polio epi- |
demic aid unit to send trained i
workers anywhere on the Pacific: j
Coast where an infantile paralysis i
outbreak gets out of;control.
Many other Stanford professors
and research workers are studying j
the problem of infantile paralysis
independent of the foundation.
