# Supplies Cold Halts Production
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 27 (UP)—The
longest siege of cold in 12 years
cut fuel supplies to the danger
point in many areas today, dis
rupting vital industrial produc
tion and leaving thousands idle
in five states.
The bitter cold caused natural yas j
and oil shortages, affecting the steel, |
automobile and coal mining indus- I
tries. Thousands of families in scat- '
tei*ed areas were without heating oil.
Many schools across the nation, in
eluding some in northern Alabama, i
were forced to close.
ll wiis colder in the Midwest today j
than in parts of Alaska, which the
Army had selected for its "operation \
frostbite" to test equipment and j
men. Western sections of Alaska j
were having a winter "heat wave."
ALASKA "HEAT WAVE"
At Fairbanks, the midday temper
ature rose to 25, about 25 degrees
above normal, the U. S. Weather
Bureau here said. In comparison, i
Chicago had a low of -2. Atlanta,
(la., almost matched Fairbanks with
a low of 37 degrees. The weatherman j
said the comparatively warm weath
er in Alaska was caused by an iso
lated mass of warm air from the
Pacific.
The icy blasts chilling the United j
Stales were coming from the Cana
dian Yukon, east of Alaska.
Sub-zero weather extended today I
all the way from Montana to Michi- I
gan, and temperatures in Atlantic ;
coast states were scheduled to drop j
as the fifth cold wave in two weeks j
fanned out over the East and South. J
The first frigid air mass rolled into j
the United States the of Jan- |
nary 111.
LARGE DEATH TOLL
Deaths resulting from the two
weeks of icy weather rose to 162 j
today. The toll included 108 dead in ;
fires, mostly from overheated stoves I
and furnaces; 2(i dead from exposure j
or freezing, and 28 dead in other j
weather accidents.
Families in communities of the j
North Central states were hit the i
worst by fuel shortages. Night tem- j
peratures in many areas were far |
below zero and the weather was
hampering shipments of further fuel
supplies. The families shivered in
unhealed homes, moved in with rel- !
| atives or converted to other types j
| of heating equipment.
Critical gas shortages disrupted j
industrial production in the Midwest.
1 and East and thousands of persons ;
were idle or working on tentative j
schedules.
<;as shortage
About 200,000 workers in the De
troit automotive center returned to |
work today after a two-day layoff
when the Michigan Consolidated
Gas Company resumed service to in- j
dust rial users.
However, they faced another three I
day layoff starting Thursday. The j
company announced late today that J
it would ask all its industrial users J
to stop using gas from tomorrow
night until next Tuesday morning. ;
The company said the cutoff was j
necessary to protect household con- j
sumers and that it expected 90 to 95 j
percent cooperation from industry, j
The U.S. Weather Bureau here
said there was no relief in sight from j
the bitter cold. Most, of the state-by- ;
state forecasts for the Midwest to- j
night warned of "very cold" weather. !

CHICAGO, Jan. 27 (UP)—The
longest siege of cold in 12 years
cut fuel supplies to the danger
point in many areas today, dis
rupting vital industrial produc
tion and leaving thousands idle
in five states.
The bitter cold caused natural yas j
and oil shortages, affecting the steel, |
automobile and coal mining indus- I
tries. Thousands of families in scat- '
tei*ed areas were without heating oil.

eluding some in northern Alabama, i
