# Lube-ing the Sports Axle With Art Lubic

Our stock question was ''How d(
you like the Cow Palace? Would
you like to see all Stanford's con
ference Karnes there instead of ii
the Pavilion?"
The answers ranged from "Man,
the rooters' seats were terrific. 1
could see every bit of action" to the
one we expected (and got) the most
—"At least I saw the game!"
Stanford has played more games
in the spacious South San Francisco
•auditorium than any other Bay
Area school—six. Four came dur
ing Christmas vacation and two last
weekend. And. incidentally, the
Cards won five of 'em.
WHERE'S Tin: RUB?
Now, just where does the rub
come in ? Why didn't we play con
ference games in the Cow Palace
this year, and why won't we next
year.' Doesn't the student body de
serve a break in the mad ticket
scramble — a chance to see USC,
UCLA, and Cal more than once
apiece?
Is the bottleneck somewhere on
the Stanford famous? The answer
is an emphatic NO. From Head
Coach Everett Dean to Director of
Athletics A! Agisters to Public Re
lations Head Don Liebendorfer to
the Hoard of Trustees the desirabil
ity of, and approval for. playing in
the Cow Palace is unanimous.
Is the crook in the straw at the
Cow Palace itself? Are the 'promo
ters there trying to save the biggest
cut of the cheese for themselves?
Auain the answer is NO. The Cow
Palace is a non-profit state institu
tion and the financial arrangements
ollered to date have proven more
than satisfactory to all schools con
cerned.
TltOV. BRUINS EAGER
Well, then, won't USC and UCLA
play in the Cow Palace? No, again.
The Trojans and Bruins are more
than eacer to perform in a larger
arena. It's money in the bank for
them plus pood will toward their
alumni and followers in the area.
The root of the problem lies on
Berkeley soil, in the hands of the
administration of Stanford's time
honored and dulv respected rival
from Strawberry Canyon—the Uni
versity of California. Et tu, Brute?
The Bears iust can't see it. They
turned thumbs down for this year,
and thumbs down for next year.
Why should our student body have
to travel across the bay to see games
when we can accommodate them
ri«ht here? ' is the main argument
advanced by Director of Athletics
Brutus Hamilton.
ANY SEATS FOR SALE?
We tripped over to see our game
with (he Blue and Gold at Berkeley
two weeks back. Granted the Cal
Pavilion is twice the size of our
own — did that mean there were
seats available? I didn't see any.
Around 5.300 tickets, were allotted
to the California student body
(which numbers well over 20.000
these days) and Stanford pulled
down slightly more than 1.000.
Throw in a press box and the
joint was crowded. I'm sure more
students wanted to see the game.
And what about alumni? And in
terested sports fans? If you ma
triculated at LTSF you didn't have
a chance. The limited public sale
was a farce.
'Ihe Cow Palace offered the uni
versity 1.200 more seats at the
beginning of the year —a total of
(5.500 reserved student body seats.
And Stanford returned more than
1.000 unsold tickets to last week's
double-header, more than we can
even offer our own student body
for a conference game in the Pa
vilion.
TRY THE TRUTH. BRUTUS
Why not come out with the truth.
Brutus ' Why not admit that you're
afraid Cal will lose a few more ball
games if the team moves out from
under that "home roof"? You're
a!raid to please anyone, even your
own alumni, if it means the Golden
Bear might make one less trip into
the winner's circle.
Think of the attraction of seeing
fill four southern division members
of the Pacific Coast Conference in
action on the same night. It would

be a tremendous boon to Bay Area
sports.
And we're willing to wager Nibs
Price's boys will do just as well at
the Cow Palace. After all. won't
Stanford be in ihe same position?
And a ten t USC and UCLA going
to play their home games in the
Olympic Auditorium?
Come on, Brutus, slip outside and
see the light. The wheels of prog
ress are in motion.

And we're willing to wager Nibs
Price's boys will do just as well at
the Cow Palace. After all. won't
Stanford be in ihe same position?
And a ten t USC and UCLA going
to play their home games in the
Olympic Auditorium?
Come on, Brutus, slip outside and
see the light. The wheels of prog
ress are in motion.
Our stock question was ''How d(
you like the Cow Palace? Would
you like to see all Stanford's con
ference Karnes there instead of ii
the Pavilion?"
The answers ranged from "Man,
the rooters' seats were terrific. 1
could see every bit of action" to the
one we expected (and got) the most
—"At least I saw the game!"
Stanford has played more games
in the spacious South San Francisco
•auditorium than any other Bay
Area school—six. Four came dur
ing Christmas vacation and two last
weekend. And. incidentally, the
Cards won five of 'em.
WHERE'S Tin: RUB?
Now, just where does the rub
come in ? Why didn't we play con
ference games in the Cow Palace
this year, and why won't we next
year.' Doesn't the student body de
serve a break in the mad ticket
scramble — a chance to see USC,
UCLA, and Cal more than once
apiece?
Is the bottleneck somewhere on
the Stanford famous? The answer
is an emphatic NO. From Head
Coach Everett Dean to Director of
Athletics A! Agisters to Public Re
lations Head Don Liebendorfer to
the Hoard of Trustees the desirabil
ity of, and approval for. playing in
the Cow Palace is unanimous.
Is the crook in the straw at the
Cow Palace itself? Are the 'promo
ters there trying to save the biggest
cut of the cheese for themselves?
Auain the answer is NO. The Cow
Palace is a non-profit state institu
tion and the financial arrangements
ollered to date have proven more
than satisfactory to all schools con
cerned.
TltOV. BRUINS EAGER
Well, then, won't USC and UCLA
play in the Cow Palace? No, again.
The Trojans and Bruins are more
than eacer to perform in a larger
arena. It's money in the bank for
them plus pood will toward their
alumni and followers in the area.
The root of the problem lies on
Berkeley soil, in the hands of the
administration of Stanford's time
honored and dulv respected rival
from Strawberry Canyon—the Uni
versity of California. Et tu, Brute?
The Bears iust can't see it. They
turned thumbs down for this year,
and thumbs down for next year.
Why should our student body have
to travel across the bay to see games
when we can accommodate them
ri«ht here? ' is the main argument
advanced by Director of Athletics
Brutus Hamilton.
ANY SEATS FOR SALE?
We tripped over to see our game
with (he Blue and Gold at Berkeley
two weeks back. Granted the Cal
Pavilion is twice the size of our
own — did that mean there were
seats available? I didn't see any.
Around 5.300 tickets, were allotted
to the California student body
(which numbers well over 20.000
these days) and Stanford pulled
down slightly more than 1.000.
Throw in a press box and the
joint was crowded. I'm sure more
students wanted to see the game.
And what about alumni? And in
terested sports fans? If you ma
triculated at LTSF you didn't have
a chance. The limited public sale
was a farce.
'Ihe Cow Palace offered the uni
versity 1.200 more seats at the
beginning of the year —a total of
(5.500 reserved student body seats.
And Stanford returned more than
1.000 unsold tickets to last week's
double-header, more than we can
even offer our own student body
for a conference game in the Pa
vilion.
TRY THE TRUTH. BRUTUS
Why not come out with the truth.

afraid Cal will lose a few more ball
games if the team moves out from
under that "home roof"? You're
a!raid to please anyone, even your

the winner's circle.

a!raid to please anyone, even your
own alumni, if it means the Golden
Bear might make one less trip into
the winner's circle.
Think of the attraction of seeing
fill four southern division members
of the Pacific Coast Conference in
action on the same night. It would

be a tremendous boon to Bay Area
sports.
And we're willing to wager Nibs
Price's boys will do just as well at
the Cow Palace. After all. won't
Stanford be in ihe same position?
And a ten t USC and UCLA going
to play their home games in the
Olympic Auditorium?
Come on, Brutus, slip outside and
see the light. The wheels of prog
ress are in motion.
Our stock question was ''How d(
you like the Cow Palace? Would
you like to see all Stanford's con
ference Karnes there instead of ii
the Pavilion?"
The answers ranged from "Man,
the rooters' seats were terrific. 1
could see every bit of action" to the
one we expected (and got) the most
—"At least I saw the game!"
Stanford has played more games
in the spacious South San Francisco
•auditorium than any other Bay
Area school—six. Four came dur
ing Christmas vacation and two last
weekend. And. incidentally, the
Cards won five of 'em.
WHERE'S Tin: RUB?
Now, just where does the rub
come in ? Why didn't we play con
ference games in the Cow Palace
this year, and why won't we next
year.' Doesn't the student body de
serve a break in the mad ticket
scramble — a chance to see USC,
UCLA, and Cal more than once
apiece?
Is the bottleneck somewhere on
the Stanford famous? The answer
is an emphatic NO. From Head
Coach Everett Dean to Director of
Athletics A! Agisters to Public Re
lations Head Don Liebendorfer to
the Hoard of Trustees the desirabil
ity of, and approval for. playing in
the Cow Palace is unanimous.
Is the crook in the straw at the
Cow Palace itself? Are the 'promo
ters there trying to save the biggest
cut of the cheese for themselves?
Auain the answer is NO. The Cow
Palace is a non-profit state institu
tion and the financial arrangements
ollered to date have proven more
than satisfactory to all schools con
cerned.
TltOV. BRUINS EAGER
Well, then, won't USC and UCLA
play in the Cow Palace? No, again.
The Trojans and Bruins are more
than eacer to perform in a larger
arena. It's money in the bank for
them plus pood will toward their
alumni and followers in the area.
The root of the problem lies on
Berkeley soil, in the hands of the
administration of Stanford's time
honored and dulv respected rival
from Strawberry Canyon—the Uni
versity of California. Et tu, Brute?
The Bears iust can't see it. They
turned thumbs down for this year,
and thumbs down for next year.
Why should our student body have
to travel across the bay to see games
when we can accommodate them
ri«ht here? ' is the main argument
advanced by Director of Athletics
Brutus Hamilton.
ANY SEATS FOR SALE?
We tripped over to see our game
with (he Blue and Gold at Berkeley
two weeks back. Granted the Cal
Pavilion is twice the size of our
own — did that mean there were
seats available? I didn't see any.
Around 5.300 tickets, were allotted
to the California student body
(which numbers well over 20.000
these days) and Stanford pulled
down slightly more than 1.000.
Throw in a press box and the
joint was crowded. I'm sure more
students wanted to see the game.
And what about alumni? And in
terested sports fans? If you ma
triculated at LTSF you didn't have
a chance. The limited public sale
was a farce.
'Ihe Cow Palace offered the uni
versity 1.200 more seats at the
beginning of the year —a total of
(5.500 reserved student body seats.
And Stanford returned more than
1.000 unsold tickets to last week's
double-header, more than we can
even offer our own student body
for a conference game in the Pa
vilion.
TRY THE TRUTH. BRUTUS
Why not come out with the truth.
Brutus ' Why not admit that you're
afraid Cal will lose a few more ball
games if the team moves out from
under that "home roof"? You're
a!raid to please anyone, even your
own alumni, if it means the Golden
Bear might make one less trip into
the winner's circle.
