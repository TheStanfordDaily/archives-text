## 
### JACK BLOOD 
Stanford's varsity, jayvee, and frosh wrestling teams will
match headlocks and toeholds with teams from San Jose State
tonight at seven o'clock in the Pavilion.
In tangling with the Spartan squad, Student Coach Vern
Jones and his varsity teammates are meeting one of the stronq-

est collegiate mat squads in the
West. The San Jose team, which
holds impressive early season vic
tories over the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, and UCLA of the PCC, will be
anxious to add the Indians to their
growing list of victims.
INDIANS TO MAKE AMENDS
However, the Card matmen are
out to make amends for the loss
suffered at the hands of Cal last
week and should make the match
interesting for the highly touted
Spartans.
The feature match of the evening
promises to be the 174-pound bout
between San Jose's Pat Felice, Jun
ior AAU 174-pound titleholder, and
Win Mumby of Stanford, son of Ted
Mumby the San Jose wrestling
coach. Ted. incidentally, coached the
mat sport at Stanford before taking
up the reins at San Jose.
JONES FACES PAYNE
The 147-pound bout will pit Coach
Vein Jones of Stanford against
Ralph Payne, a Spartan newcomer.

wrestlers on the coast, and was the
only Stanford winner against Cal
last week.
