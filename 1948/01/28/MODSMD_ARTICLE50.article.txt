## MURAL BASKETBALL Swingley Leads Betas To Win Over Phi Psi II 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Led by their steady-shooting forward Bob Swingley, who
scored 11 points, the Beta's mural basketball team trounced
Phi Kappa Psi (II), 23 to 5, in a rough and tumble contest.
It was definitely a "battle of the coaches" with varsity eager
Gene Martin hollering plays at the Betas, while the Phi Psi's

number one mural team, headed by
Bob Janssen, tried to tell the second
team how to make some quick points.
IS TO 1 AT HALF
With Swingley hot and with fast
buckets by Roger Boles, Bernard
Woody, and Jack Knowlton, the Be
tas took an early lead which was

extended to 18 to 1 at half time.
In another game the IVCFG squad
outscored Fiji (III), 3(5 to 23. Star
forward Johnny Jenks, who scored
19 points in last week's tilt, just re
covered from the flu, so could not
play up to his full capacity.
The Fijis kept pace with their
opponents in the second half with

Emery Mitchell and Bob Coates do
ing most of the scoring. But good
rebounding by center Tom Rockwell
and guard Tom Mortzloff were more
than enough to assure victory for the
IVCFG squad.
At the Village Gym, House 103
defeated Building 151 19 to 10 in a
slow-starting intra-Village contest.
Bob Hill led the winners with twelve
points.
Dick Schmidt played good defens
ive ball for the Building 51 team.
