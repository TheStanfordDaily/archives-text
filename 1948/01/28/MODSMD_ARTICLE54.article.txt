# PCL Approves Solon Transfer
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 27 (UP) â€”
The Pacific Coast league today voted
that no club owner may dispose of
the controlling stock in his team
without the unanimous consent of
the other seven club owners.
The action, taken during the sec
ond day of the annual mid-winter
convention, followed approval of
Oscar Salenger's purchase of the
Sacramento Solons by a G-2 vote,
only a majority vote being needed
prior to today's action.
Salenger's purchase was objected
to on the grounds that Sacramento
should remain home-owned. Salen
ger is a former owner of the Mil
waukee Brewers of the American
Association.
At this morning's session the PCL
adopted a plan calling for an arbi
trated price on all players drafted
by the Majors. The plan also estab
lished the first draft year at the
end of six years instead of the pres
ent four.
The Governor's Cup was elimin
ated as an award for the winner oi
the post-season Shaughnessy play
offs, the St. Louis Sporting News
award being given instead.
Day and night games and starting
times will remain at the discretion
of the home teams during 1948. it
was announced. Yesterday, action
was considered to provide for uni
form starting times throughout the
league.
