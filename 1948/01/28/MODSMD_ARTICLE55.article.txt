# Lunny Leads Colorful Career
## 
### RAY EISELT 
Just about any afternoon during
the week you can go into the Encina
gym and see a diminutive, blac k
haired guy putting aspiring young
pugilists through the paces. Prob
ably he'll be standing alongside the
ring just watching and then, every
once in awhile, he'll say, "0.K., keep
that left out there," or "Keep that
mouth closed if you don't want a
broken jaw,"
YOU'D NEVER GUESS
The little fellow with the very
congenial manner, whom you'd nev
er guess could have been a pro
boxer—it seems most of us have
stereotyped pugilists as a hard-bit
ten, cau iflower - eared characters
is the present mentor of the Stan
ford boxing team, Coach Ray Lunny.
And Lunny is well qualified for
the job when his back-log of exper
ience is taken into consideration.
Ray has tangled, in the many years
of his professional career, with fel
lows like Chalky Wright, one-time
featherweight champ of the world,
Richie Lemos, another featherweight
title-holder, and Georgie Latka, well
known to the local fight fans.
IT ALL BEGAN
It all began way back when Ray
was a kid in San Francisco. They
used to hold big election rallies, and

as part of the entertainment provid
ed for the local voters they'd have
amateur boxing matches. It was un
der these circumstances that Lunny
got into the ring for the first time,
at the age of eight.
When he was a freshman at Com
merce High in the City, the little

Irish puncher had become quite pro
ficient with the leather gloves and
wiis fighting in AAU contests.
In 1938 Lunny had his first real,
honest - to - goodness professional
fight in the Hollywood Legion Sta
dium in Los Anfieles. This initial
encounter was a successful one, for
Ray came out with a decision.
TOI C.H BOIJTS UNCALLED
Recalling some of his toughest
bouts, Lunny remembers best that
gruelling ten rounds with Chalky
Wright. "After that one," he says
with a smile, "my features were
kind of scrambled." Wright, he says,
had one of the hardest punches in
the profession.
Chief Evening Thunder, an In
dian slugger, rated as the other
roughest boxer that Lunny has ever
met. In their first fight the Chief
handled him with little care but he
foueht the Chief to a draw. The sec
ond time the two men came together
it was a different story and Ray put
Evening Thunder away in the fourth
round.
Because of some calcified bones
in his hand Lunny has retired from
the profession ;md. at present, does
not have any serious intentions of
returning.
KAY STILL HAS SI'KKD
But few years of inactivity do
not seem to have made any telling
marks on Lunny. He seems to have
retained much of the speed and de
ception that made him a leading
contender lor the lightweight title
back in 1941.
Of his own proteges, who have so
far this season performed quite well,
Lunny says he has seen some of the
best amateur fighters in many a
year right here in the Encina Gym.


You might never guess if. but
Boxing Coach RAY LUNNY' was
formerly a leading professional
boxer.

Irish puncher had become quite pro
ficient with the leather gloves and
wiis fighting in AAU contests.
In 1938 Lunny had his first real,
honest - to - goodness professional
fight in the Hollywood Legion Sta
dium in Los Anfieles. This initial
encounter was a successful one, for
Ray came out with a decision.
TOI C.H BOIJTS UNCALLED
Recalling some of his toughest
bouts, Lunny remembers best that
gruelling ten rounds with Chalky
Wright. "After that one," he says
with a smile, "my features were
kind of scrambled." Wright, he says,
had one of the hardest punches in
the profession.
Chief Evening Thunder, an In
dian slugger, rated as the other
roughest boxer that Lunny has ever
met. In their first fight the Chief
handled him with little care but he
foueht the Chief to a draw. The sec
ond time the two men came together
it was a different story and Ray put
Evening Thunder away in the fourth
round.
Because of some calcified bones
in his hand Lunny has retired from
the profession ;md. at present, does
not have any serious intentions of
returning.
KAY STILL HAS SI'KKD
But few years of inactivity do
not seem to have made any telling
marks on Lunny. He seems to have
retained much of the speed and de
ception that made him a leading
contender lor the lightweight title
back in 1941.
Of his own proteges, who have so
far this season performed quite well,
Lunny says he has seen some of the
best amateur fighters in many a
year right here in the Encina Gym.


You might never guess if. but
Boxing Coach RAY LUNNY' was
formerly a leading professional
boxer.
Just about any afternoon during
the week you can go into the Encina
gym and see a diminutive, blac k
haired guy putting aspiring young
pugilists through the paces. Prob
ably he'll be standing alongside the
ring just watching and then, every
once in awhile, he'll say, "0.K., keep
that left out there," or "Keep that
mouth closed if you don't want a
broken jaw,"
YOU'D NEVER GUESS
The little fellow with the very
congenial manner, whom you'd nev
er guess could have been a pro
boxer—it seems most of us have
stereotyped pugilists as a hard-bit
ten, cau iflower - eared characters
is the present mentor of the Stan
ford boxing team, Coach Ray Lunny.
And Lunny is well qualified for
the job when his back-log of exper
ience is taken into consideration.
Ray has tangled, in the many years
of his professional career, with fel
lows like Chalky Wright, one-time
featherweight champ of the world,
Richie Lemos, another featherweight
title-holder, and Georgie Latka, well
known to the local fight fans.
IT ALL BEGAN
It all began way back when Ray
was a kid in San Francisco. They
used to hold big election rallies, and

as part of the entertainment provid
ed for the local voters they'd have
amateur boxing matches. It was un
der these circumstances that Lunny
got into the ring for the first time,
at the age of eight.
When he was a freshman at Com
merce High in the City, the little

Irish puncher had become quite pro
