# Revive the Jolly-up
## 
### 
The recently proposed social program ought
to be good.
A social committee, consisting of representa
tives from each living area, has been formed
under the chairmanship of Guyla Runyon, stud
ent body vice-president. This group puts out
a calendar of social events. That is the first
move, informing the students.
Now, in answer to the cry of "not enough
doing on campus" they have inaugurated a
social program, including a minimum of three
open dances per weekend on campus.
Large all-campus dances have never been
too popular. On the other hand informal open
houses have usually been crowded to capacity.
If living groups respond to the new idea, as
they seem to be doing, the dating problem
should be partially solved.

One of the nicest things about the Stanford
family has always been that social activities
have been concentrated right on campus. There
has never been a need to go to the City for
anything but special occasions. This new social
program is the first step towards checking the
recent trend away from the Farm.
We would like to suggest a second step.
Stags will not be welcome at these open
houses. But whatever happened to the "Jolly
up?" These friendly informal gatherings of
men and women, with no "dating" involved,
were once a vital aspect of the congeniality of
a small campus.
The growth in enrollment does not justify
outgrowing the "jolly-up." It, or a similar func
tion, should be revived to make the larger fam
ily better acquainted
