# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
My nomination for the sign of the week is one
which can be found in Los Aitos. There is a new
grocery store there, and over the butcher counter
there hangs a neon sign that says:
"Vodden and Schmitt—meat you can eat."
I'm going to run in there some afternoon and
tell I hem:
"Sure I can eat it —but can I pay for it?"
1 remember once when 1 was out to dinner with
the family and my little nephew, the latter relation
was asked to say the blessing.
"What's a blessing?" inquired the youngster.
"Why that's what your father says just before you
eal your meal," said our host.
"0.K.," said the kid, and while the dinner guests
bowed their heads, the kid blurted out:
"Take it easy on the butter, it's GO cents a pound."
That was in 15)38 and everybody laughed. The only
person involved in the situation who is still laughing
is the cow.
The whole trouble with inflation is that it comes
at a time when prices are so damned high. Imagine
paying 8 cents apiece for eggs. I know it represents
a lull day's work for a chicken, but I'm not interested
in legislating a minimum wage and hour act for
animals.
And the legislature is trying to resolve the conflict
of whether to feed starving Europe or curb inflation.

It all depends whether you want to spend more money
or spend less money.
My suggestion is to divide the congress into two
groups, let them work toward opposite goals, then
they can report their progress to one another each
time they meet.
On second thought, that's a superfluous sugges
tion—they've been doing that for years.
The New Yorker made excellent comment on the
feeding of starving Europeans. Said they:
"Isn't it just like those Europeans to get cold and
hungry during an election year!"
I hope I don't sound like a cracker-barrel philos
opher, but it seems to me that it's a problem that
will take more than just "a good Republican Presi
dent," or "a good Democratic President."
All of which makes "Ike" a smarter man than I
thought he was. Spelled backwards that reads I'd
rather run Columbia than the U.S. What the heck,
he gets to be president anyway. Instead of running
for office, he's running for cover, which is the greatest
intellectual movement since the natives left Bikini.
They say the largest room in Washington is room
for improvement, and I don't blame Ike for seeking
better living quarters.
Of course, no one is likely to send him a spanieled
version of Fala over at Columbia, but maybe he doesn't
like dogs.
