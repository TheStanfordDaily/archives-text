It was only a hint which may not mean much, but
even a hint fiom high French officials that France may
join its zone of occupation in Germany with the
British and American zones in a three-power top
control is genuinely good news.
The sharp separation between the occupation zones
has always been the main source of trouble in the
administration of Germany. Furthermore, occupational
zones have been the excuse for much more that has
gone wrong. For more than two years it has been
possible to blame all too many failures or semi-failures
on lack of coordination and agreement as to policies
and procedures.
In the past months the American and British zones
have been functioning on a basis, which amounts for
all practical purposes, to a merger. If the French
were to join in. the whole of Western Germany would
be brought together under an essentially common
occupation. A move by the French of this nature holds
every prospect of making a vast difference in the
effectiveness of the control, and in the elimination of
Nazism and militarism.
It also makes a big difference in the capacity of

the Allies to impress the Germans with the value of
democracy. The German people are used to system
and order. Now they are distressed by uncertainty
in policy and conflict in action. They will never have
any real respect for the occupiers until the Allies
exhibit more agreement of purpose and perform their
important duties with certainty and persistence.
Anything that these "high French officials" can
do to hasten France's full cooperation in a three
power administration will save just that much pre
cious time. France, up to now, has just been living
off of her zone, and she has done nothing to improve
it or the existing conditions. Along this line of
thought, we can find our reason why many in France
turn their backs upon any merger proposal. It would,
possibly, mean a little work for them.
The scant prospect that Russia might come in, and
thus make a complete merger, will not be lessened
in anyway by a joint stand of the three Western allies.
On the contrary, if there is any effect on the Soviets
it will probably impress them that there call be
concerted action by the democracies in Germany.
