To the Editor:
The Stanford Region of the California Railfans'
Association wishes to convey to the "Stanford Daily"
inn compliments on your recent series of articles on
lhi- beginnings of the Central Pacific Railroad. Mr.
Tom Self is certainly to be complimented on his ac
curacy and jouranlistic ability in portraying such an
important event in the history of this country. The
history of a railroad is in reality the history of the
country through which it penetrates, for as the shin
ing steel pushes forward, new frontiers open and
flourish.
The purpo.-c of our organization is to build public
interest in the lifelines of our nation, the railroads.
We, therefore, commend the Stanford Daily, its staff
and management, for their valuable work in further
ing the aims for which our statewide organization
was established.
The California Railfans' Association,
Stanford Region.
