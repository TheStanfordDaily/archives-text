# The 						Greenland Question
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Monday Allen Bletz wrote an article about Den
mark's attitude in the question about American troops
in Greenland. . . .
What Bid/ thinks is that "the Danish government
is certainly taking a position of ingratitude" because
it has demanded that the United States leave Green
land -as Bletz dramatically describes it "lock, stock,
and barrel."
Having finished my studies of law and political
science at the University of Copenhagen I think it
necessary to give the following statement.
The U.S.A.-Greenland-Denmark question must be
looked at first formally, and then in a more practical
way.
1. Formally. The Germans occupied Denmark April
9, 1!M(). About two days later the Danish ambassador
to the United States signed a treaty alloyving American
troops to stay in Greenland so long as perils from the
"present" war threatened the U.S. Now these perils
do not exit. Nobody doubts the legality of the treaty.
. . . Has (he world situation changed so much that
the U.S. need nto keep its treaties? Certainly n0t....

The conclusion must be that the U.S. has to leave
Greenland "lock, stock, and barrel."
2. However I am not one to support the formal
point of view just described. Let us look at the situa
tion from a practical point of view. As described by
Bletz, "The U.S. certainly can't leave this gateway
to this eastern shore defenseless." '
I agree with Bletz But let us try to see the
situation from the Danish point of view. When the
European war stopped in 1945 Denmark found its
big eastern island, Bernholm, occupied by the Rus
sians. and its big western island, Greenland, occupied
by the Americans. Does Bletz really expect Denmark
to tell the Russians to leave, but at the same time
invite the Americans to stay?....The Russians left
Bernholm, the Americans didn't leave Greenland. I
must add that Bernholm is an extremely important
strategic position between Sweden and Germany
The Danish point of view has nothing to do with
ingratitude- the first condition for discussing politics
is that you make the facts clear.
In talking about ingratitude Bletz seems not to
have understood that there must be a slight difference
between the political paths followed by the strongest
power in the world and a tiny country.

situation from the Danish point of view. When the
European war stopped in 1945 Denmark found its
big eastern island, Bernholm, occupied by the Rus
sians. and its big western island, Greenland, occupied
by the Americans. Does Bletz really expect Denmark
to tell the Russians to leave, but at the same time
invite the Americans to stay?....The Russians left
Bernholm, the Americans didn't leave Greenland. I
must add that Bernholm is an extremely important
strategic position between Sweden and Germany
The Danish point of view has nothing to do with
ingratitude- the first condition for discussing politics
is that you make the facts clear.
In talking about ingratitude Bletz seems not to
have understood that there must be a slight difference
between the political paths followed by the strongest
power in the world and a tiny country.

To the Editor:
Monday Allen Bletz wrote an article about Den
mark's attitude in the question about American troops
in Greenland. . . .
What Bid/ thinks is that "the Danish government
is certainly taking a position of ingratitude" because
it has demanded that the United States leave Green
land -as Bletz dramatically describes it "lock, stock,
and barrel."
Having finished my studies of law and political
science at the University of Copenhagen I think it
necessary to give the following statement.
The U.S.A.-Greenland-Denmark question must be
looked at first formally, and then in a more practical
way.
1. Formally. The Germans occupied Denmark April
9, 1!M(). About two days later the Danish ambassador
to the United States signed a treaty alloyving American
troops to stay in Greenland so long as perils from the
"present" war threatened the U.S. Now these perils
do not exit. Nobody doubts the legality of the treaty.
. . . Has (he world situation changed so much that
the U.S. need nto keep its treaties? Certainly n0t....

The conclusion must be that the U.S. has to leave
Greenland "lock, stock, and barrel."
2. However I am not one to support the formal
point of view just described. Let us look at the situa
tion from a practical point of view. As described by
Bletz, "The U.S. certainly can't leave this gateway
to this eastern shore defenseless." '
I agree with Bletz But let us try to see the
situation from the Danish point of view. When the
European war stopped in 1945 Denmark found its
big eastern island, Bernholm, occupied by the Rus
sians. and its big western island, Greenland, occupied
by the Americans. Does Bletz really expect Denmark
to tell the Russians to leave, but at the same time
invite the Americans to stay?....The Russians left
Bernholm, the Americans didn't leave Greenland. I
must add that Bernholm is an extremely important
strategic position between Sweden and Germany
