To llio Editor:
Several hundred Stanfordites, including yours truly,
are wondering just who is due credit for the botched
up seating arrangement at Friday's basketball game
in the Cow Palace. Yes, I knew a Stanford seating
section was provided and 1 also know it was filled
with everyone but Stanford people. Evidently no
attempt was made by anyone to see that the Stanford
section was kept open to Stanford ticket-holders who,
like myself, thought the purchase of a ticket entitled
us to a seat in our section.
Instead we were privileged to sit to the rear of the
backboards, in the aisles, and to stand jip. Where were
the people in the white sweaters? They were always
present at last quarter's football games. Damned effi
cient too —with their herding us into roped-off sec
tions with everything but riot sticks and bayonets!
Has the glamour worn off?
Certainly we "farm bovs ' aren't asking too much
in wanting a .sent <il the n !,,11t, 5. we.'
