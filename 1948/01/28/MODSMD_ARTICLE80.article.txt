# Dr. Grommon to Discuss Education
## 
### 
"Fundamentals vs. Tools" will be argued by Dr. Alfred H.
Grommon, associate professor of education and English, tonight
at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Featured as the third speaker in the Education Faculty Lecture
Series, Dr. Grommon will draw from his own experiences in

presenting the war between educat
ors and the public.
'"In my 12 years experience in the
teaching of English in public high
schools, I have found considerable
conflict over this problem of funda
mentals versus 'the frills'," he ex
plained.
