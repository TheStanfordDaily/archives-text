# Death Concludes Colorful Career
## 
### 
The life of the late Dr. Donald B. Tresidder was a full and con
structive one for all its shortness. As death, yesterday, wrote
finis to one of the finest careers in modern times, «r educational
world realized its loss. Stanford University realized it more.
For this University was always first and foremost in Dr. Tresid
der's mind. "My chief interest in public service," he wrote
years ago to a friend, "is Stanford."

Dr. Tresidder became president of Stanford on "September 1,
1943, succeeding Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur. He held this post for
four years, four months, and 27 days.
BORN IN INDIANA

Dr. Tresidder was born in Tipton.
Indiana, April 7, 1894, the son of
Dr. and Mrs James Treloar Trcsid
der. His father, mother and uncle
all were practicing physicians. It
was not si range, therefore, that Dr.
Tresidder's earliest intention was to
be a physician and this he persisted
in, overcoming many obstacles be
fore receiving the M.D. degree.
Teaching "all grades" in a one
room country school was the first
employment of the late Dr. Tresid- |
del - , and followed his graduation |
from the Tipton high school and a
.summer course at the State Normal
school.
After a year in a pre-medical
course at the University of Chicago,
he, with his sister, headed for Cali
fornia on a vacation trip. The train
was held up by a wreck and he be- j
came acquainted with a represent
ative of David A. Curry, an cducat- |
or who had established a summer |
camp in Yosemite. This led to a j
summer's employment at Camp j
Curry, where a Stanford professor !
invited him to visit the university
on his way home.
ENTERS STANFORD
Being offered board and room in
the home of Professor li. L. Green j
of the department of mathematics j
in exchange for services as a cook, i
he took the job and hired an Orien
tal to do the cooking until he learn
ed how. Dr. Tresidder was the first
of a long chain of pre-medical stud
ents to "do the cooking" at the
Green home.
In 1917 he enlisted in a base hos
pital unit, but after some months of
service at Camp Fremont, Menlo
Park, transferred to the air service j
of the Signal Corps as a flying cadet, j
He was graduated from the school
of military aeronautics at the- Uni- t
versify of California in March 1918, j
received a commission as second |
lieutenant after further training in j
Texas, and at Scott Field, Illinois, !
and was transferred to a bombing !
squadron at Ellington Field, Texas, |
where the 1918 Armistice found him.
AFTER WAR
At the war's end Dr. Tresidder
returned to Stanford, where he be
came an assistant in the physiology
department and later in the depart
ment of anatomy—and for his work i
in anatomy was elected to member
ship in Sigma Xi, an honorary re- ]
search society. In 1919 he received j
an A.B. degree, and moved along to j
the Stanford Medical School where
be became laboratory assistant to
l)r. E. C. Dickson in a research on
botulism, a vital subject affecting
the public health and the welfare
and future of parts of the canning j
industry.
A romance that started in Yosc- |
mite culminated June 1(5. 1920, in i
the marriage of Donald Tresidder I
and Mary Curry, daughter of Mr. !
and Mrs. David A. Curry, the found- j
ers of Camp Curry. Mary Curry had I
entered Stanford with the class of
191 (i hut had completed the under- ;
graduate course in three years, ma- I
joring in English, and receiving the i
A.I?, degree in 1915. She is a mem- |
her of Kappa Alpha Thcta sorority, i
ami Phi Beta Kappa and Cap and ;
Gown societies.
She had received the M.A. degree
from Stanford in 1916, had taken
graduate work in English at Colum
bia, and had completed all require
ments for the Ph.D. degree in Eng
lish at Yale University except the
writing of her final thesjs, which
was interrupted by the engagement
and marriage.
DROI'S MEDICINE
In 1922. because of circumstances
ensuing from deaths in his wife's
family, Dr. Tresidder turned aside
from his medical course to tempor
ary assignment as assistant manager
of Camp Curry, Yosemite, under 1
Mrs. Curry, but from 1922 to 1025.
as the camp closed each year, he i
returned to his studies in the Stan- 112
ford Medical School. In 1925 the De
partment of the Interior caused a l
consolidation of all the companies in
Yosemite, and Dr. Tresidder was |
made president of them, but he still j

continued his studies at the Stan
ford Medical School, and in 1927 re
ceived his M.D. degree.
After receiving this degree, Dr.
Tresidder continued as president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry com
panies, a post which he held until
his death.
STANFORD ACTIVITIES
In spite of the urgency of his
Yosemite business, Stanford remain
ed the first love of the late uni
versity head. He was a charter mem
ber of Stanford Associates, and had
served as vice-president of the or
ganization for six years. He was a
member of the Stanford Fund Com
mittee since its establishment. He
was co-chairman of the Fiftieth An
niversary Committee in 1941, and
was chairman of the Committee on
Exceptional Students.
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
In December. 1939, Dr. Tresidder
was elected a member of the Board
of Trustees of Stanford, and was

May, 1942. He held this post until
January 21, 1943, when Judge Mar
cus C. Sloss, vice-president of the
board, announced his election as
President of the University.
As Farm President, Dr. Tresidder
held the administrative reins during
the troublesome final years of the
war. He was largely responsible for
the instigation and installation of
the efficient Stanford Health Serv
ice. He took command of the school
at a time when it was in one of its
lowest financial slumps; when he
left it, yesterday, the University had
reached its all-time financial peak.
POSTWAR FORESIGHT
It was due largely to Dr. Tres
idder's energy and foresight that the
critical housing shortage was met
and overcome at the war's end.
Stanford Village, one of the best
university emergency housing units
in the nation, came into being large
ly because of the efforts of the late
Stanford president.
Dr. Tresidder is survived by his
wife, Mrs. Mary Tresidder, and his

DROI'S MEDICINE
In 1922. because of circumstances
ensuing from deaths in his wife's
family, Dr. Tresidder turned aside
from his medical course to tempor
ary assignment as assistant manager
of Camp Curry, Yosemite, under 1
Mrs. Curry, but from 1922 to 1025.
as the camp closed each year, he i
returned to his studies in the Stan- 112
ford Medical School. In 1925 the De
partment of the Interior caused a l
consolidation of all the companies in
Yosemite, and Dr. Tresidder was |
made president of them, but he still j

continued his studies at the Stan
ford Medical School, and in 1927 re
ceived his M.D. degree.
After receiving this degree, Dr.
Tresidder continued as president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry com
panies, a post which he held until
his death.
STANFORD ACTIVITIES
In spite of the urgency of his
Yosemite business, Stanford remain
ed the first love of the late uni
versity head. He was a charter mem
ber of Stanford Associates, and had
served as vice-president of the or
ganization for six years. He was a
member of the Stanford Fund Com
mittee since its establishment. He
was co-chairman of the Fiftieth An
niversary Committee in 1941, and

cus C. Sloss, vice-president of the
board, announced his election as
President of the University.
As Farm President, Dr. Tresidder
held the administrative reins during
the troublesome final years of the
war. He was largely responsible for
the instigation and installation of
the efficient Stanford Health Serv
ice. He took command of the school
at a time when it was in one of its
lowest financial slumps; when he
left it, yesterday, the University had
reached its all-time financial peak.
POSTWAR FORESIGHT
It was due largely to Dr. Tres
idder's energy and foresight that the
critical housing shortage was met
and overcome at the war's end.
Stanford Village, one of the best
university emergency housing units
in the nation, came into being large
ly because of the efforts of the late
Stanford president.
Dr. Tresidder is survived by his
wife, Mrs. Mary Tresidder, and his
sister, Mrs. L. M. Mintzcr of Palo
Alto.

The life of the late Dr. Donald B. Tresidder was a full and con
structive one for all its shortness. As death, yesterday, wrote

world realized its loss. Stanford University realized it more.
For this University was always first and foremost in Dr. Tresid
der's mind. "My chief interest in public service," he wrote

fornia on a vacation trip. The train
was held up by a wreck and he be- j
came acquainted with a represent
ative of David A. Curry, an cducat- |
