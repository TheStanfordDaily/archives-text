AII I UMN PREPARATION
Recent case comments, which
were prepared autumn quarter on
subjects of current interest, and
student notes, being processed now
by those who did especially well on
their comments, form the rest of the
Review.
This spring the Student Revising
Hoard of live or six men will begin
to train potential board members
from the September, 1947, class, Dr.
Corker said. This group will then
have six months to prepare material
for the first issue of the "Stanford
Law Review," he added.
