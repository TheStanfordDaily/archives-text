Next Tuesday night's game with
Bradley University in the Pavilion
promises to be a real humdinger.
The barnstorming Peoria, Illinois,
school has swept to 19 victories in
20 starts this year, and ranks right
at the top of national hoop ratings.
The Midwesterners, with an all-
Illinois roster of performers, has
averaged check this 70 points per
game on offense while holding their
rivals at a 47-point medium.
You say you haven't got your
tickets yet? Better hustle over to
lay an early siege on the Pavilion.
It'll be a turnaway crowd for sure.
Incidentally, numbered among
Bradley's victims are the University
of San Francisco (50-43) whom the
Injuns meet here Saturday night.
Also on the list are San Diego State
(82-5(5), Arizona (91-6G), Yale (91-
50), West Texas State (01-51), and
Texas Christian (56-52).
Sounds like they never heard of
defensive basketball. You can bet
your bottom dollar that Mr. Ever
ett Dean and his lads will teach 'em
a few things. My bottom dollar's on
the Cards.

LEGION COMICAL
Has anyone noticed the comical
situation Hollywood Legion Sta
dium finds itself in these days? The
Southern California listic emporium
signed a television contract over a
year ago granting complete broad
cast television rights for three years
at a paltry sum per annum.
Then attendance began to fall off.
The fighters wanted a cut from the
gate plus television. But there was
n't much to split in the latter pot.
Now the top main eventers won't
give Hollywood a tumble—last Fri
day's feature saw Baby Dutch Cul
bertson, a lumbering preliminary
boy from the Bay Area, cop the.
duke over another stumblebum,
Francisco de la Cruz.
