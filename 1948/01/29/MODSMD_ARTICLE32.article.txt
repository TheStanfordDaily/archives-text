# FACULTY PLAYS HOOKEY!
## 
### 
Male to be a tattle-tale, but this
was too good to pass up. Stanford
students skiing at Sun Valley the
first week of the quarter discovered
a member of the Stanford faculty in
their midst — Dr. DeWitt Burnham
of the medical school. Moral: It's
never too late to play hookey!

Notes from around and about:
Wonder if A 1 Masters is still toot
ing the whistle he had at Tuesday
night's first annual Palo Alto Live
Oaks Club banquet. We're still
proud of Ai's selection as manager
of the 1948 Olympic track and field
team. . . . The announcement came
over United Press yesterday that
Bob and Boots Blatt of the Farm
were officially selected to compete
beginning this weekend in the
Olympic winter games. Both are
entered in downhill and slalom
competition . . . Bob on the starting
team of seven and Boots on the
three-man reserve squad. ... T. S.
Ary, who will make a notable addi
tion to Stanford's football and bas
ketball squads next fall if the ath
letic board makes him eligible, has
been burning up the Village mural
cage loop. Arv plays for the Aged
and Decrepit five. . . . An interest
ing note on the all-year sport of
horse racing: the track was so fast
opening week at Santa Anita (With
Pleasure and Bogle both ran six
furlongs in 1:09.3, only one-fifth
of a second off the track record)
that the track has been slowed down
a full second on the mile. That's to
protect the horses — what're they
doing to protect poor J. Q. Citizen?
. . . Check with Brooklyn's Pat
HefTernan, the campus authority, on
the latest unbeatable system. . . .

Add alum clippings: The Cards'
Jim Pollard has combined with
DePaul's George Mikan to give pro
fessional basketball its greatest one
two punch. They perform for the
Minneapolis Lakers. . . . Running
them a close second are Joe Fulks
and Stanford's Howie Dallmar of
the Philadelphia Stags. . . . And
in the Coast's AAU circuit former
Farmhands Don Burness and Don
Williams are still holding the fort
with the Oakland Bittners. . . .
Look for the announcement of the
impending battle to the finish on the
hardwoods between the Daily sports
staff and the KSU clowns. The Daily
will be defending honors attained
after a lop-sided touch football vic
tory last fall.
