# Wolter Makes First Cut In Indian Baseball Squad
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Head baseball coach Harry Wolter has been forced to wield
his axe and to let the chips fall where they may in an attempt to
whittle down his oversized varsity squad into an outfit resembl
ing a baseball team instead of an army.
The fact that no field has been found for a JV team necessi
tates this unfortunate move since the

Sunken Diamond is so overcrowded
that two batting practice cages have
had to be set up instead of the
usual one.
WOLTLK NOT PLEASED
Coach Wolter was none too happy
about the drastic action, but as he
put it, "We're sorry to have to cut
the squad, but we are a victim of
circumstances."
During a recent intra-squad tus
sle 41 players participated in the
regular nine inning affair. Coach
Wolter, who ignored his persistent
cold to view part of the mass ma
neuvers, was quite pleased at the
showing made.
The contest was won by the Chiefs
4-0 over the Warriors. The Chiefs'
pitching trio of Dick Flatland, Dave
Dahle, and Dave Stott, gave up only
one walk and whiffed five in the
seven innings that they worked.
TRIPLES HIGHLIGHT GAME
Highlights of the game were the
two rousing triples off the bats of
Dave Barnes and dßob Nava, but
otherwise the base hits were not
rattling off the fence, since only a
total of eleven blows were garnered
by both teams.
At the present time baseball man
ager George loakimedes is busy
drawing up the varsity practice
schedule. These games are only ten
tative pending the final approval of
athletic department, and as yet the
rest of the list has not been filled.
Contests in the offing so far are
with the El Toro Marines, College of
Pacific, the Junior Seals, and either
USF or San Quentin, or possibly
both. The above games are only part
of an extensive • aactice schedule,
and these contests mentioned are as
yet not official.
BUSH lIAS TROUBLES
Over on the Frosh diamond Coach
Bush Bushong has been plagued
with troubles. First, an anonymous
group of Bat Breakers Incorporated
has rapidly cut down the supply of
bats. At the end of yesterday's ses
sion only one bludgeon was left.
The way things are going, with an
average of two bats being broken
per day, Coach Bushong will haVe
a cord or so of firewood composed
completely of the shattered willows.
Adding to the woes of the team is
the loss of three regulars to various
ailments. Joe Pinotti has a strawber
ry. Jim Trabucco a sprained wrist,
and Don McComber has been suf
fering from a cold.


HARRY WOLTER, whose base
ball team is suffering from grow
ing pains. With a record turnout
the veteran mentor ha?> had to cut
his squad due to lack of playing
space.
