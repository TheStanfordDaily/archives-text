The second event, held on Sat
urday, was the slalom, a mile and
a half descending obstacle course.
Williams captured seventh place in
this with a run of lm33s as a Sun
Valley ski instructor walked off
with the race in lmlBs. Sigal was
ranked 17th with his lmsos run.
The jumping contest, originally
scheduled for Sunday, was post
poned until Monday because of a
strong, unfavorable wind. Only the
Colorado and Idaho entries re
mained for the jump, they being the
two teams in leading contention for
top honors.
Colorado, the eventual victor, was
followed in order by Idaho, Utah.
Washington. California, Oregon, Ne
vada, and Wyoming.
