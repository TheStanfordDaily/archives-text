## STEVE'S OK Full Team Ready For Week's Tilts 
### BILL ALLEN 
A dark shadow on the basketball
horizon was removed yesterday
when Steve Stephenson was re
leased from the rest home where lie
had been confined because of the
flu.
Coach Everett Dean said Ste
phenson may not start Friday
night's tilt against College of Pa
cific but will probably be around
for the USF tussle Saturday.
SCHUTTE OUT
Stephenson's return leaves re
serve cener Dick Schutte as the
only man on the flu list. However,
all the cripples, semi-cripples, and
ex-cripples of the last few weeks
have been taking it pretty easy in
this week's practice sessions.
They all should be ready to go
against the Dons and the Tigers, and
off their recent form, the Indians
should take both games.
COP has a season's record of six
games won and eight lost. Among
their conquests are the Sacramento
Senators, Fresno State, and Pepper
dine. They held the Oakland Bitt
ners to a five-point margin.
CCAA CHAMPS
The Bengals are the defending
champions in the California Colle
giate Athletic Association. This
year they have a .500 average in
league play, winning three and los
ing three.
Guard Stan McWilliams, a G-ft.
3-in. sophomore, who set the all
time COP scoring record as a fresh
man in 1945, is back this year and
is leading the Stockton team's
point-makers.
OLD FRIENDS
When they play USF Saturday
night, the Stanford men will be up
against a team they have seen a lot
of this year, the Dons having been
co-hosts with the Cardinals for four
Cow Palace games at Christmas
time.
The San Franciscans are definite
ly an in-and-out club. They have
beaten such good teams as Utah
State, Utah, and Oregon State but
have lost to enough others to make
their record for the year, seven and
eight.
Pete Newel l's outfit is famed for
its defense, which fell apart only
once when George Kokand his Ar
kansas Razorback pals ran up 70
against them.
