ARCADIA, Jan. 28 (UP). —On
Trust today ran the fastest six-fur
long workout ever recorded at a
tack but he did it without a boy
on his back.
The prize colt, favorite to win
Saturday's $100,000 Maturity here
at Santa Anita, ran the three-quar
ters in 1:09 3/5 after his exercise
boy slipped from the saddle as On
Trust broke from the gate.
Trainer Willie Molter and early
morning witnesses looked on fear
ful that the four-year-old might
bolt and injure himself. But. the
well-mannered On Trust performed
smoothly and seemed to relish his
workout sans any guiding hands on
his reins.
