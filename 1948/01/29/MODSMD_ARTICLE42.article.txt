# UCLA Is Next Foe For Farm Mittmen
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Rested after their 4-2 trimming, Friday, of a highly rated
Bronco squad, Coach Ray Lunny's Card boxers lesumed heavy
drills this week in preparation for their meeting with UCLA, Feb.
14, at Los Angeles.
Still without an entry in either the heavy or featherweight

divisions, mentor Lunny faces the'
further prospect of having veteran
155-pounder Dick Stanton out of
the Westwood fracas because of a
badly cut eye.
HUSH MAY CiO
Stanton, with a record of one win
and one draw, sustained the injury
while battling Gaeton De Mattei of
Santa Clara to a draw Friday night.
If Stanton is unable to fight, Oren
Rush, who showed his worth in an
exhibition match during the San
Francisco City College bouts here
two weeks ago, will take over the
155-lb. duties.
Two men who can be counted on
to give more than they take against
the Bruins are Joe Cranmer and
Fred Ten Eyck, in the 175 and 165-
lb. divisions respectively. Both have
pounded out two wins so far with
out a loss, and Coach Lunney de
scribes the two as "the most im
proved men on {he team." Scrappy
Irwin Rosa will back up Ten Eyck
as the second middleweight entry.
ALTUS IS HOPE
In the lighter weight classes, Wil
lie Alt us stacks up as the Farm's
main hope. Altus, originally a wel
ter, has trained down to the 145-lb.
division, and should be hard to beat
at his new weight.
Along with Jay Savage, 135-
pounder, Altus has fought two fights
so far, winning one and losing one,
while flyweight Eddie O'Neil, spot
ting his opponents anywhere from
three to 10 pounds in the 118-lb.
class, has dropped two decisions.
Both Savage and O'Neil have shown
remarkable improvement in recent
gym drills.
BKI'INS FAVOHED
Man for man the Farm boys
should rate near even with the Bru
ins; as a team, however, the absence
of entries in the heavy and feather
weight divisions will be a heavy
disadvantage inasmuch as the team
will start off with two automatic
forfeits against it. Coach Lunny
hopes to offset this by entering two
men in both the 155 and 165 divi
sions.

Francisco City College bouts here
two weeks ago, will take over the
155-lb. duties.
Two men who can be counted on
to give more than they take against
the Bruins are Joe Cranmer and
Fred Ten Eyck, in the 175 and 165-
lb. divisions respectively. Both have
pounded out two wins so far with
out a loss, and Coach Lunney de
scribes the two as "the most im
proved men on {he team." Scrappy
Irwin Rosa will back up Ten Eyck
as the second middleweight entry.
ALTUS IS HOPE
In the lighter weight classes, Wil
lie Alt us stacks up as the Farm's
main hope. Altus, originally a wel
ter, has trained down to the 145-lb.
division, and should be hard to beat
at his new weight.
Along with Jay Savage, 135-
pounder, Altus has fought two fights
so far, winning one and losing one,
while flyweight Eddie O'Neil, spot
ting his opponents anywhere from
three to 10 pounds in the 118-lb.
class, has dropped two decisions.
Both Savage and O'Neil have shown
remarkable improvement in recent
gym drills.
BKI'INS FAVOHED
Man for man the Farm boys
should rate near even with the Bru
ins; as a team, however, the absence
of entries in the heavy and feather
weight divisions will be a heavy
disadvantage inasmuch as the team
will start off with two automatic
forfeits against it. Coach Lunny
hopes to offset this by entering two
men in both the 155 and 165 divi
sions.
Rested after their 4-2 trimming, Friday, of a highly rated
Bronco squad, Coach Ray Lunny's Card boxers lesumed heavy
drills this week in preparation for their meeting with UCLA, Feb.
14, at Los Angeles.
Still without an entry in either the heavy or featherweight

divisions, mentor Lunny faces the'
further prospect of having veteran
155-pounder Dick Stanton out of
the Westwood fracas because of a
badly cut eye.
HUSH MAY CiO
Stanton, with a record of one win
and one draw, sustained the injury
while battling Gaeton De Mattei of
Santa Clara to a draw Friday night.
If Stanton is unable to fight, Oren
Rush, who showed his worth in an
exhibition match during the San
Francisco City College bouts here
