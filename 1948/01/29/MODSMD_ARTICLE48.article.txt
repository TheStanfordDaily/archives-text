# Luke-Warm Lamb
## 
### 
There's something about a beer or a milk
shake ....
Something that makes lor friendlier and
more efficient rushing than a crowded front
room or a plate of luke-warm lamb and peas.
Any one of the Farm's fraternities will
agree to this and they will also agree that
if they stuck to the luke-warm lamb provi
sions in the Interfraternity Council rules they
would be left without a pledge class.
It is an admitted fact that there is off
campus rushing. It is an admitted fact that
there are fraternity men scouting through the
halls and rooms of Encina.
Why doesn't the Interfraternity Council
or Board cf Control open its eyes and either
change the rules to fit into the practice, or
enforce the present rules?
Unfortunately the present rules are un
workable and idealistic. It would take a
well-staffed police crew to enforce the rules,

and a Junior Tenney commiltee to pass judg
ment on violators.
Now no house is going to sit back with
its copy of the Council rushing regulations,
while the boys across the street grab off all
the pledges. It's a case of dog-eat-dog, and
will continue to be until the Fraternity lead
ers rewrite their rushing rules.
There is nothing objectionable about off
campus rushing. Informal off-campus activi
ties are of real benefit to a rushee in making
a wise choice of a house. They are also of
great value to the fraternity members in
judging a rushee. Often a person whose
"drawing room personality" is weak, will
shine under more friendly and informal con
ditions.
The Interfraternity Council, which is made
up of house presidents, knows the situation
better than any other group. It will be up to
them to do something about it.—D.D.
