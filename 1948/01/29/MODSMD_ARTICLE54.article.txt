! The Student Health Service yes
j terday issued for the second time a
I request that ail seniors and graduate
students who have not had chest X
j rays at the Health Service within
the year make appointments for X
j rays as soon as possible,
j Dr. George Houck, Health Service
; Director, announced that more com
i plete X-ray records for seniors and
graduate students are urgently
, needed as the initial step in a long
! range plan which the Health Serv
ice is starting.
ENTRANCE ROUTINE
Dr. Houck pointed out that be
| fore 11)45, X-rays were not given to
; new students as a matter of entrance
i routine, as is now the case. The re
i suit is that X-ray coverage for
Health Service files is spotty for the
! junior and senior classes, and al
j most non-existent for graduate stu-
I dents.
"Before embarking on an intens
j ive survey plan, the Health Service
| must make its current X-ray records
| more complete," Dr. Houck said,
j "We want to catch up with the sen
> ior and graduate records now, and
i next month will move into the jun
i ior class."
jSURVEY PROGRAM
Next autumn, the Health Service
will start a survey program in
I which X-rays will be taken of every
! student every year. This has been
! made possible by the recent instal
auiiptuu AV3U vt jo uoin?[
which is the sole property of the
Health Service.
The necessity of relying on the
trailer of the Santa Clara County
Tuberculosis Association has thus
been eliminated. The Health Serv
ice can now keep the films and file
them with each student's record.
