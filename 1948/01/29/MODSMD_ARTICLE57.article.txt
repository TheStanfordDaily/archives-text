# KSU to Rebroadcast 'Winterset Prelude'
## 
### 
The cast of "Winterset" will give a repeat broadcast of the
"Prelude to Winterset," which was given over Station KVSM in
San Mateo last Sunday, tonight at 7 over Station KSU.
Betty McGee, director of Sunday's broadcast and of the Stan
ford Players' production of Maxwell Anderson's famous play,
announced that the success of the* —

first broadcast was responsible for j
many requests for its repetition.
When plans were originally 1
drawn up for a program under the ]
title "Stanford Players on the Air,"
efforts were made to secure radio I
rights for scenes from the play, j
When this failed, a group of players <
decided to dramatize incidents from '
the actual Sacco - Vanzetti case I
which provides the background for 1
Anderson's stirring drama.
The Sacco-Vanzetti case shocked ;
the judicial world in the 1920's and
is considered one of the greatest
miscarriages of justice in the history
of the United States.
As such it has been treated fre
quently in contemporary American
literature, but "Winterset" is both a
denunciation and an investigation
of justice, as well as one of the most '
tender and tragic love stories of
modern times.
"Winterset" is now in its last
week of rehearsal, and will open in
the Little Theater Feb. 4, running
four consecutive nights. Tickets are
now on sale at the offices of the
speech and drama department, and
may be reserved by calling Palo
Alto 22041.
