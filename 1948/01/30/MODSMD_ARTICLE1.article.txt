Memorial Tribute
Eighteen-hundred Stanford students filed quietly into the
Memorial Church at 11:30 a.m. yesterday to pay their respects
to their friend and president, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder.
They had come straiqht from classes; most were still carrying
books as they walked down the long aisle of the church.
Students of all faiths gathered in the non-sectarian church to
hear a simple short ceremony conducted by Chaplain Robert
M. Minto. Some kneeled, some bowed their heads, others looked
straight ahead watching the changing colors as the sun played
on the cut-glass windows.
The students were joined by members of the faculty, the
Board of Trustees, and just friends of the president. Alvin C.
Eurich, acting president, and W. P. Fuller, chairman, of the Board
of Trustees, were seated with the under-graduates.

Chaplain Minto opened the services. "Let us humbly remem- j
ber before God, Donald Bertrand Tresidder."
The 23rd Psalm and St. John 5:24 were read. A prayer closed
the service.
Within the closing prayer were these words:
"Especially this day we thank thee for. him whom thou hast
taken from our midst, so that sorrow has filled our hearts. We
bless thee for all thy loving kindness to him throughout the
years of his earthly life, and we remember with gratitude his
devoted service to us and our University."
Stanford would always remember a friend.

Expressions of condolence came yesterday to the Stanford
Family from many quarters as Californians learned of the un-j
timely death of the University's president.
Gov. Earl Warren, upon learning of Dr. Tresidder's death, said: |
"The passing of Dr. Tresidder is a tragic loss to our state.;
He was not only a great scholar and administrator, but he was;
also a great humanitarian. He should have had many more
years of useful service to the university and the state which
he loved so well."
, Robert Gordon Sproul, president of the University of Califor
nia, stated:
"The news of Donald Tresidder's untimely death is to me still
unbelievable. All that I can think of is that I have lost a dear

friend, a man of gentle nature and high ideals, a colleague with
whom I delighted to work.
"But Dr. Tresidder was, of course, far more than my friend.
He was a worthy president of a distinguished university and a
guietly effective force in the life of our state. Stanford will not
soon find his egual as the leader of the great community of
students, faculty, and alumni. I share with all friends of educa
tion in California her deep sense of loss."
Brother Austin, FFC, president of St. Mary's College, paid trib
ute to D. Tresidder.
"Dr. Tresidder," he said, "displayed some of the finest guali- j
ties of American manhood. He worked his way through college
and after achieving professional eminence he never lost interest
in intellectual things, nor, in the progress of his alma mater.
As a crowning award for his continued interest in and devotion
to things of the mind, he was named president of Stanford, in
which position he promoted the advancement of teaching and
scholarship by wise educational administration."
Administration
Administration of the University will procede under the direc
tion of Vice-President Alvin C. Eurich, with the Board of Trustees
to meet within the next few days to acting president.
Since he has often served as acting president in the absence
of Dr. Tresidder, it is anticipated that Dr. Eurich will be formally
appointed by the Board to exercise that function.

Dr. Eurich, who holds an eminent place in educational circles,
has been at Stanford since 1938. Elected academic vice-president
in 1944, he assumed the duties of vice-president in 1946, when
the offices of financial vice-president and academic vice-president
were combined.

Memorial Church at 11:30 a.m. yesterday to pay their respects
to their friend and president, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder.
They had come straiqht from classes; most were still carrying
books as they walked down the long aisle of the church.
Students of all faiths gathered in the non-sectarian church to
hear a simple short ceremony conducted by Chaplain Robert
M. Minto. Some kneeled, some bowed their heads, others looked
straight ahead watching the changing colors as the sun played
on the cut-glass windows.
The students were joined by members of the faculty, the
Board of Trustees, and just friends of the president. Alvin C.
Eurich, acting president, and W. P. Fuller, chairman, of the Board
of Trustees, were seated with the under-graduates.

Chaplain Minto opened the services. "Let us humbly remem- j
ber before God, Donald Bertrand Tresidder."
The 23rd Psalm and St. John 5:24 were read. A prayer closed
the service.
Within the closing prayer were these words:
"Especially this day we thank thee for. him whom thou hast
taken from our midst, so that sorrow has filled our hearts. We
bless thee for all thy loving kindness to him throughout the
years of his earthly life, and we remember with gratitude his
devoted service to us and our University."
Stanford would always remember a friend.

Expressions of condolence came yesterday to the Stanford
Family from many quarters as Californians learned of the un-j
timely death of the University's president.
Gov. Earl Warren, upon learning of Dr. Tresidder's death, said: |
"The passing of Dr. Tresidder is a tragic loss to our state.;
He was not only a great scholar and administrator, but he was;
also a great humanitarian. He should have had many more
years of useful service to the university and the state which
he loved so well."
, Robert Gordon Sproul, president of the University of Califor
nia, stated:
"The news of Donald Tresidder's untimely death is to me still
unbelievable. All that I can think of is that I have lost a dear

friend, a man of gentle nature and high ideals, a colleague with
whom I delighted to work.
"But Dr. Tresidder was, of course, far more than my friend.
He was a worthy president of a distinguished university and a
guietly effective force in the life of our state. Stanford will not
soon find his egual as the leader of the great community of
students, faculty, and alumni. I share with all friends of educa
tion in California her deep sense of loss."
Brother Austin, FFC, president of St. Mary's College, paid trib
ute to D. Tresidder.
"Dr. Tresidder," he said, "displayed some of the finest guali- j
ties of American manhood. He worked his way through college
and after achieving professional eminence he never lost interest
in intellectual things, nor, in the progress of his alma mater.
As a crowning award for his continued interest in and devotion
to things of the mind, he was named president of Stanford, in
which position he promoted the advancement of teaching and
scholarship by wise educational administration."
Administration
Administration of the University will procede under the direc
tion of Vice-President Alvin C. Eurich, with the Board of Trustees
to meet within the next few days to acting president.
Since he has often served as acting president in the absence
of Dr. Tresidder, it is anticipated that Dr. Eurich will be formally
appointed by the Board to exercise that function.

Dr. Eurich, who holds an eminent place in educational circles,
has been at Stanford since 1938. Elected academic vice-president
in 1944, he assumed the duties of vice-president in 1946, when
the offices of financial vice-president and academic vice-president
were combined.

The students were joined by members of the faculty, the
Board of Trustees, and just friends of the president. Alvin C.
Eurich, acting president, and W. P. Fuller, chairman, of the Board
of Trustees, were seated with the under-graduates.

Chaplain Minto opened the services. "Let us humbly remem- j
ber before God, Donald Bertrand Tresidder."
The 23rd Psalm and St. John 5:24 were read. A prayer closed
the service.
Within the closing prayer were these words:
"Especially this day we thank thee for. him whom thou hast
taken from our midst, so that sorrow has filled our hearts. We
bless thee for all thy loving kindness to him throughout the
years of his earthly life, and we remember with gratitude his
devoted service to us and our University."
Stanford would always remember a friend.

Expressions of condolence came yesterday to the Stanford
Family from many quarters as Californians learned of the un-j
timely death of the University's president.
Gov. Earl Warren, upon learning of Dr. Tresidder's death, said: |
"The passing of Dr. Tresidder is a tragic loss to our state.;
He was not only a great scholar and administrator, but he was;
also a great humanitarian. He should have had many more
years of useful service to the university and the state which
he loved so well."
, Robert Gordon Sproul, president of the University of Califor
nia, stated:
"The news of Donald Tresidder's untimely death is to me still
unbelievable. All that I can think of is that I have lost a dear

friend, a man of gentle nature and high ideals, a colleague with
whom I delighted to work.
"But Dr. Tresidder was, of course, far more than my friend.
He was a worthy president of a distinguished university and a
guietly effective force in the life of our state. Stanford will not
soon find his egual as the leader of the great community of
students, faculty, and alumni. I share with all friends of educa
tion in California her deep sense of loss."
Brother Austin, FFC, president of St. Mary's College, paid trib
ute to D. Tresidder.
"Dr. Tresidder," he said, "displayed some of the finest guali- j
ties of American manhood. He worked his way through college
and after achieving professional eminence he never lost interest
in intellectual things, nor, in the progress of his alma mater.
As a crowning award for his continued interest in and devotion
to things of the mind, he was named president of Stanford, in
which position he promoted the advancement of teaching and
scholarship by wise educational administration."
Administration
Administration of the University will procede under the direc
tion of Vice-President Alvin C. Eurich, with the Board of Trustees
to meet within the next few days to acting president.
Since he has often served as acting president in the absence
of Dr. Tresidder, it is anticipated that Dr. Eurich will be formally
appointed by the Board to exercise that function.

Dr. Eurich, who holds an eminent place in educational circles,
has been at Stanford since 1938. Elected academic vice-president
in 1944, he assumed the duties of vice-president in 1946, when
the offices of financial vice-president and academic vice-president
were combined.

Eighteen-hundred Stanford students filed quietly into the

on the cut-glass windows.
