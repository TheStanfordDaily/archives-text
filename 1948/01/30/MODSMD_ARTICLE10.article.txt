## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 29
(UP).—The United Natioas Pal
estine Commission agreed today to
try to form a Jewish militia in Pal
estine "at the earliest possible date."
The militia, intended to maintain
internal law and order, should be
set up before the British mandate
in Palestine ends, the commission
decided.
It appointed Vicente J. Francisco
of the Philippines as a one-man
subcommittee to carry on detailed
negotiations with Great Britain and
the Jewish Agency, which already
has promised the fullest co-opera
tion in speedy mobilization of a mi
litia of 30.000 to 35,000 men.
The commission also agreed to
start discussing tomorrow the ap
parent need for an international
army in Palestine. This interna
tional force would be in addition
to the Jewish militia. The security
problem will be outlined in a spe
cial report which the five-member
commission will submit to the Se
curity Council.
The Palestine Commission, in de
ciding to go ahead with mobiliza
tion of the militia, emphasized that
it also sought to form an Arab mi
litia for the Arab state. Arabs, how
ever. have refused to have anything
to do with the Palestine Commis
sion, so the effect of today's decision
will be to mobilize only Jews.
