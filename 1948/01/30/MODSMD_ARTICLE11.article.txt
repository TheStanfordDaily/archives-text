Candidates for SAC and short term Men's Council positions
will be chosen Wednesday to run in the final election on Feb
ruary 11. All but four candidates for each office will be elim
inated, Gordon Luce, Election Board chairman, announced today.
Nominees for Excom District XII and VI and senior class secre-
-ftary will not be included on the

primary ballot because fewer than
four people are running for these
offices. Both men and women may
vote for SAC nominees, Luce said.
Since three men are to be elected
for long term Men's Council and two
women for Women's Council, there
will be only a final election for these
offices, John Marin, ballot chair
man, stated.
Ken Coft, Excom member, an
nounced, "It is permissible for can
didates to place {signs and posters
on campus telephone poles and trees
but these signs must be taken down
after the event or they will be re
moved and destroyed."
A total of $10, including any help
from friends, may be spent before
Feb. 11.
