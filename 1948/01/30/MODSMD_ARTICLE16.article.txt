# Farm Vet Couple Solve Housing Shortage-Construct Their Own
## 
### 
By JOE WILLIAMSON
When Charley and Kuth Paya and
their small daughter Susy came to
Stanford, they faced a problem
which has been common among the
Farm's married population. They
couldn't find a place to live.
The prospects of their getting an
apartment at the Village didn't seem
very tfood, a nd buying an $8,000
house was out of the question. A
friend titok them in at bis place,
hit! il was a temporary and over
crowded arrangement.
At lhis point the story of the Pa
yas search for a home deviates from
Ii ,< conventional. Charley Paya,
I syehulogy major, who had never
before used a hammer or saw, set
;ibolll building a house by himself.
To-lay, their attractive five-room
home in Menlo Park is ready for
< rcupaney, and the only outside help
tin Payas had was that of a plumber
;,nd an electrician. Building codes
ii <j uiic thai plumbing and wiring
be in tailed by persons licensed in
Ili'i e Irades.
TOTAL COST
The total cost of their home, in
cluding the price of the lot, tools,
lumber, concrete, plumber, and
electrician, ran just a little short of
: <1,000 This amount, as they point
out, i; less than the interest they
would have hail to pay on any house
they could have bought.
They dived right into the project
shortly after last spring quarter

started. Their first move consisted
of buying a lot and a simplified
manual on carpentry.
By the end of spring quarter they
had drawn up the blueprints, and
were ready U> lay the foundation
forms.
CRUDE INSTRUMENTS
Their surveying instruments wore
crude, to put il mildly. They con
sisted of sever-.! sticks, a knowledge
of the Pythagorean theorem, and a
carpenter's level. The levelness of
the foundation forms was checked
by sighting along the top of the
level.
Step by step the work progressed
during the summer vacation. By the
end of summer the exterior was
completed, including windows and
doors.
When Paya came up against an
obstacle not covered in his "how
to build a house" book, he got
straightened out on it by visiting
houses under construction in the
Menlo area, and talking with car
penters and contractors on the job.
NO INFORMATION
The design called lor a flat rool.
The book didn't say anything about
fiat roofs. Carpenters don't like fiat
roofs and would give him little in
formation on them mostly because
of their own lack of experience. So
the Payas found a flat-roofed house
under construction, made note of
the construction details, and went
back and duplicated what they saw.
They had trouble, plenty of it. As
an example, a sewer trench was
needed from the house to a sewer
line on the opposite' side of the
street. Paya found a man with a
mechanical digger working in the
neighborhood and asked him to 11 ij.;
the trench.
He was careful to have the dig
ging of the trench coincide with the
day the plumber was supposed to
come to lay the pipe. The digger
dug the trench. The plumber didn't
show up. Meanwhile, there re
mained a big ditch across Avy Ave
nue, stopping all traffic.
INJUNCTION PENDING
Something had to be done before
the neighbors got an injunction
against them. The plumber was long
overdue. Paya scoured the country
for the right size pipe and laid it

himself, thereby learning the hard
way how sewer pipe is laid.
Plumbers caused them more grief
than anything else. More than once
he had to chip a three-inch hole
through the concrete floor to in
stall a flange the plumber had neg
lected to put in.
During the autumn quarter the
Payas worked after classes and on
Saturdays putting in plumbing and
electrical fixtures.
HEAVY WQKK
While Paya was doing the heavy
work, his wile, who is an art major,
was carrying tools, painting, and
giving directions.*
Structurally, the house is a red
wood rustic, rectangular shaped,
Hat roofed, and with 848 square feet
of floor space. There is a two-foot
overhang of the eaves. The win
dows are of the wooden casement
type. The floor is concrete, with red
pigment added, and divided into
squares by one-inch redwood strips.

before used a hammer or saw, set
;ibolll building a house by himself.
To-lay, their attractive five-room
home in Menlo Park is ready for
< rcupaney, and the only outside help
tin Payas had was that of a plumber
;,nd an electrician. Building codes
ii <j uiic thai plumbing and wiring
be in tailed by persons licensed in
Ili'i e Irades.
TOTAL COST
The total cost of their home, in
cluding the price of the lot, tools,
lumber, concrete, plumber, and
electrician, ran just a little short of
: <1,000 This amount, as they point
out, i; less than the interest they
would have hail to pay on any house
they could have bought.
They dived right into the project
shortly after last spring quarter

started. Their first move consisted
of buying a lot and a simplified
manual on carpentry.
By the end of spring quarter they
had drawn up the blueprints, and
were ready U> lay the foundation
forms.
CRUDE INSTRUMENTS
Their surveying instruments wore
crude, to put il mildly. They con
sisted of sever-.! sticks, a knowledge
of the Pythagorean theorem, and a
carpenter's level. The levelness of
the foundation forms was checked
by sighting along the top of the
level.
Step by step the work progressed
during the summer vacation. By the
end of summer the exterior was
completed, including windows and
doors.
When Paya came up against an
obstacle not covered in his "how
to build a house" book, he got
straightened out on it by visiting
houses under construction in the
Menlo area, and talking with car
penters and contractors on the job.
NO INFORMATION
The design called lor a flat rool.
The book didn't say anything about
fiat roofs. Carpenters don't like fiat
roofs and would give him little in
formation on them mostly because
of their own lack of experience. So
the Payas found a flat-roofed house
under construction, made note of
the construction details, and went
back and duplicated what they saw.
They had trouble, plenty of it. As
an example, a sewer trench was
needed from the house to a sewer
line on the opposite' side of the
street. Paya found a man with a
mechanical digger working in the
neighborhood and asked him to 11 ij.;
the trench.
He was careful to have the dig
ging of the trench coincide with the
day the plumber was supposed to
come to lay the pipe. The digger
dug the trench. The plumber didn't
show up. Meanwhile, there re
mained a big ditch across Avy Ave
nue, stopping all traffic.
INJUNCTION PENDING
Something had to be done before
the neighbors got an injunction
against them. The plumber was long
overdue. Paya scoured the country
for the right size pipe and laid it

himself, thereby learning the hard
way how sewer pipe is laid.
Plumbers caused them more grief
than anything else. More than once
he had to chip a three-inch hole
through the concrete floor to in
stall a flange the plumber had neg
lected to put in.
During the autumn quarter the
Payas worked after classes and on
Saturdays putting in plumbing and
electrical fixtures.
HEAVY WQKK
While Paya was doing the heavy
work, his wile, who is an art major,
was carrying tools, painting, and
giving directions.*
Structurally, the house is a red
wood rustic, rectangular shaped,
Hat roofed, and with 848 square feet
of floor space. There is a two-foot
overhang of the eaves. The win
dows are of the wooden casement
type. The floor is concrete, with red
pigment added, and divided into
squares by one-inch redwood strips.

which has been common among the

couldn't find a place to live.

would have hail to pay on any house
they could have bought.
They dived right into the project
shortly after last spring quarter

started. Their first move consisted
of buying a lot and a simplified
manual on carpentry.
By the end of spring quarter they
had drawn up the blueprints, and
were ready U> lay the foundation
forms.
CRUDE INSTRUMENTS
Their surveying instruments wore
crude, to put il mildly. They con
sisted of sever-.! sticks, a knowledge
of the Pythagorean theorem, and a
carpenter's level. The levelness of
the foundation forms was checked
by sighting along the top of the
level.
Step by step the work progressed
during the summer vacation. By the
end of summer the exterior was
completed, including windows and
doors.
When Paya came up against an
obstacle not covered in his "how
to build a house" book, he got
straightened out on it by visiting
houses under construction in the
Menlo area, and talking with car
penters and contractors on the job.
NO INFORMATION
The design called lor a flat rool.
The book didn't say anything about
fiat roofs. Carpenters don't like fiat
roofs and would give him little in
formation on them mostly because
of their own lack of experience. So
the Payas found a flat-roofed house
under construction, made note of
the construction details, and went
back and duplicated what they saw.
They had trouble, plenty of it. As
an example, a sewer trench was
needed from the house to a sewer
line on the opposite' side of the
street. Paya found a man with a
mechanical digger working in the
neighborhood and asked him to 11 ij.;
the trench.
He was careful to have the dig
ging of the trench coincide with the
day the plumber was supposed to
come to lay the pipe. The digger
dug the trench. The plumber didn't
show up. Meanwhile, there re
mained a big ditch across Avy Ave
nue, stopping all traffic.
INJUNCTION PENDING
Something had to be done before
the neighbors got an injunction
against them. The plumber was long
overdue. Paya scoured the country
for the right size pipe and laid it

himself, thereby learning the hard
way how sewer pipe is laid.
Plumbers caused them more grief
than anything else. More than once
he had to chip a three-inch hole
through the concrete floor to in
stall a flange the plumber had neg
lected to put in.
During the autumn quarter the
Payas worked after classes and on
Saturdays putting in plumbing and
electrical fixtures.
HEAVY WQKK
While Paya was doing the heavy
work, his wile, who is an art major,
was carrying tools, painting, and
giving directions.*
Structurally, the house is a red
wood rustic, rectangular shaped,
Hat roofed, and with 848 square feet
of floor space. There is a two-foot
overhang of the eaves. The win
dows are of the wooden casement
type. The floor is concrete, with red
pigment added, and divided into
squares by one-inch redwood strips.
