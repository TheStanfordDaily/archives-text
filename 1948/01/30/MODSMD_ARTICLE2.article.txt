# Dr. Tresidder Held Deep Love of Nature
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
Donald B. Tresidder was an outdoorsman in every sense of the
word. He held a deep and fine feeling for nature, and his appre
ciation of the beauties of forest and mountain was of the sort
that can only stem from familiarity with the outdoors . . . his
close friends attest to that.
One of Dr. Tresidder's closest friends was Herman H. Hoss of

Palo Alto, who had known him for
over thirty years and was associated l
with him in business during a large
part of that time. Mr. Hoss, deeply
grieved and shocked at the sudden
passing of one so close to him, vivid
ly recalls his friend's interests, the
activities from which he derived the
greatest pleasure.
"I first met Don at Yosemite in
1919." Hoss stated, "when he had
just returned from the service. At
that time he was working with a
photographer at Camp Curry. How
ever, it was not until 1922 when he
was associate manager at Camp Cur
ry and I was assistant manager,
that we really became well ac
quainted. Then, in 1925, he became
president of the Yosemite Park and
Curry companies and I secretary
treasurer. Our association at Yose
mite continued until 1942.
yosemite camping
"Don was a very enthusiastic
mountain lover and went on long
hikes and pack trips. Camping was (
a joy to him, and he would pack a j
burro with all the necessary para
phernalia and hike deep into the
mountains. He became very well ac
quainted with the Yosemite region,
and would roam for days.
"He was an excellent horseman, |
and when skiing became popular in ,
1928 he took it up, and soon became
expert in that sport. He was also
one of the most enthusiastic fish
ermen I have ever known—a very
able angler.
PARTIAL TO YOUTH
"Don always preferred associating
with young people—he liked to have
them along on hikes and fishing
trips. I believe he resented getting
old more than most of us.
"He was the most enthusiastic
supporter of intercollegiate compe
tition that I have ever known. His
emotional interest was tremendous,
and while watching a football game ;
he would be playing every play for
every man, and hardly be able to
stand up after the final gun.
As a matter of fact, it was not
until later years that he could con- j
Irol his complete emotional partiei

pation in every sport that he watch
ed.
"Yet the only truly competitive
sport that he seemed to enjoy was
tennis, and after awhile his interest
in that died ouj. His sports were
non-competitive, but they were rug
ged—skiing, hiking, riding—and he
was good at them.
"And he was very fond of music—
loved singing in small groups. Par
ticularly, he enjoyed burlesquing
opera, and listening to music with
his friends, and discussing it.
STARTS AT STANFORD
"1 remember, too, how he hap
pened to come to Stanford. He had
had a year of pre-medieine.study at
the University of Chicago and de
cided to vacation in California. A
train wreck delayed him, I believe,
and during the delay he became ac
quainted with a man who worked
at David Curry's camp in Yosemite.
A 1 ler hearing the man's stories
about Camp Curry he decided to
spend the summer there and worked
as a porter in the dining hall. While
he was there he met Rufus Green,
a professor in the department of
mathematics at Stanford and a cou
sin of Mrs. Curry.
"He came to Stanford that fall to
continue his pre-med work, and
worked for Professor Green as
houseboy and cook to earn his board
and room.
"Don continued to work in Yose
mite during the summers and
through Professor Green he met
Mary Curry. They were drawn to
gether by almost identical tastes —
a common love of nature and out
door sports. They were married in
June of 1920.
RECEIVES DEGREE
"Don continued as president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry com
pany but he returned to Stanford
every fall when the camp closed,
and in 1927 he received his M.D.
degree.
"He was always devoted to Stan
ford and served the University in
many capacities before becoming
president. He enjoyed nothing more
than entertaining students. I only
wish more Stanford people could
have known him as well as I. The
University will feel its loss as deep
ly as do his friends," concluded Mr.
Hoss.

Donald B. Tresidder was an outdoorsman in every sense of the
word. He held a deep and fine feeling for nature, and his appre
ciation of the beauties of forest and mountain was of the sort
that can only stem from familiarity with the outdoors . . . his
close friends attest to that.
One of Dr. Tresidder's closest friends was Herman H. Hoss of

Palo Alto, who had known him for
over thirty years and was associated l
with him in business during a large
part of that time. Mr. Hoss, deeply
grieved and shocked at the sudden
passing of one so close to him, vivid
ly recalls his friend's interests, the
activities from which he derived the
greatest pleasure.
"I first met Don at Yosemite in
1919." Hoss stated, "when he had
just returned from the service. At
that time he was working with a
photographer at Camp Curry. How
ever, it was not until 1922 when he
was associate manager at Camp Cur
ry and I was assistant manager,
that we really became well ac
quainted. Then, in 1925, he became
president of the Yosemite Park and
Curry companies and I secretary
treasurer. Our association at Yose
mite continued until 1942.
yosemite camping
"Don was a very enthusiastic
mountain lover and went on long
hikes and pack trips. Camping was (
a joy to him, and he would pack a j
burro with all the necessary para
phernalia and hike deep into the
mountains. He became very well ac
quainted with the Yosemite region,
and would roam for days.
"He was an excellent horseman, |
and when skiing became popular in ,
1928 he took it up, and soon became
expert in that sport. He was also
one of the most enthusiastic fish
ermen I have ever known—a very
able angler.
PARTIAL TO YOUTH
"Don always preferred associating
with young people—he liked to have
them along on hikes and fishing
trips. I believe he resented getting
old more than most of us.
"He was the most enthusiastic
supporter of intercollegiate compe
tition that I have ever known. His
emotional interest was tremendous,
and while watching a football game ;
he would be playing every play for
every man, and hardly be able to
stand up after the final gun.
As a matter of fact, it was not
until later years that he could con- j
Irol his complete emotional partiei

pation in every sport that he watch
ed.
"Yet the only truly competitive
sport that he seemed to enjoy was
tennis, and after awhile his interest
in that died ouj. His sports were
non-competitive, but they were rug
ged—skiing, hiking, riding—and he
was good at them.
"And he was very fond of music—
loved singing in small groups. Par
ticularly, he enjoyed burlesquing
opera, and listening to music with
his friends, and discussing it.
STARTS AT STANFORD
"1 remember, too, how he hap
pened to come to Stanford. He had
had a year of pre-medieine.study at
the University of Chicago and de
cided to vacation in California. A
train wreck delayed him, I believe,
and during the delay he became ac
quainted with a man who worked
at David Curry's camp in Yosemite.
A 1 ler hearing the man's stories
about Camp Curry he decided to
spend the summer there and worked
as a porter in the dining hall. While
he was there he met Rufus Green,
a professor in the department of
mathematics at Stanford and a cou
sin of Mrs. Curry.
"He came to Stanford that fall to
continue his pre-med work, and
worked for Professor Green as
houseboy and cook to earn his board
and room.
"Don continued to work in Yose
mite during the summers and
through Professor Green he met
Mary Curry. They were drawn to
gether by almost identical tastes —
a common love of nature and out
door sports. They were married in
June of 1920.
RECEIVES DEGREE
"Don continued as president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry com
pany but he returned to Stanford
every fall when the camp closed,
and in 1927 he received his M.D.
degree.
"He was always devoted to Stan
ford and served the University in
many capacities before becoming
president. He enjoyed nothing more
than entertaining students. I only
wish more Stanford people could

ford and served the University in
many capacities before becoming
president. He enjoyed nothing more
than entertaining students. I only
wish more Stanford people could
have known him as well as I. The
University will feel its loss as deep
ly as do his friends," concluded Mr.
Hoss.
Donald B. Tresidder was an outdoorsman in every sense of the
word. He held a deep and fine feeling for nature, and his appre
ciation of the beauties of forest and mountain was of the sort
that can only stem from familiarity with the outdoors . . . his
close friends attest to that.
One of Dr. Tresidder's closest friends was Herman H. Hoss of

Palo Alto, who had known him for
over thirty years and was associated l
with him in business during a large
part of that time. Mr. Hoss, deeply
grieved and shocked at the sudden
passing of one so close to him, vivid
ly recalls his friend's interests, the
activities from which he derived the
greatest pleasure.
"I first met Don at Yosemite in
1919." Hoss stated, "when he had
just returned from the service. At
that time he was working with a
photographer at Camp Curry. How
ever, it was not until 1922 when he
was associate manager at Camp Cur
ry and I was assistant manager,
that we really became well ac
quainted. Then, in 1925, he became
president of the Yosemite Park and
Curry companies and I secretary
treasurer. Our association at Yose
mite continued until 1942.
yosemite camping
"Don was a very enthusiastic
mountain lover and went on long
hikes and pack trips. Camping was (
a joy to him, and he would pack a j
burro with all the necessary para
phernalia and hike deep into the
mountains. He became very well ac
quainted with the Yosemite region,
and would roam for days.
"He was an excellent horseman, |
and when skiing became popular in ,
1928 he took it up, and soon became
expert in that sport. He was also
one of the most enthusiastic fish
ermen I have ever known—a very
able angler.
PARTIAL TO YOUTH
"Don always preferred associating
with young people—he liked to have
them along on hikes and fishing
trips. I believe he resented getting
old more than most of us.
"He was the most enthusiastic
supporter of intercollegiate compe
tition that I have ever known. His
emotional interest was tremendous,
and while watching a football game ;
he would be playing every play for
every man, and hardly be able to
stand up after the final gun.
As a matter of fact, it was not
until later years that he could con- j
Irol his complete emotional partiei

pation in every sport that he watch
ed.
"Yet the only truly competitive
sport that he seemed to enjoy was
tennis, and after awhile his interest
in that died ouj. His sports were
non-competitive, but they were rug
ged—skiing, hiking, riding—and he
was good at them.
"And he was very fond of music—
loved singing in small groups. Par
ticularly, he enjoyed burlesquing
opera, and listening to music with
his friends, and discussing it.
STARTS AT STANFORD
"1 remember, too, how he hap
pened to come to Stanford. He had
had a year of pre-medieine.study at
the University of Chicago and de
cided to vacation in California. A
train wreck delayed him, I believe,
and during the delay he became ac
quainted with a man who worked
at David Curry's camp in Yosemite.
A 1 ler hearing the man's stories
about Camp Curry he decided to
spend the summer there and worked
as a porter in the dining hall. While
he was there he met Rufus Green,
a professor in the department of
mathematics at Stanford and a cou
sin of Mrs. Curry.
"He came to Stanford that fall to
continue his pre-med work, and
worked for Professor Green as
houseboy and cook to earn his board
and room.
"Don continued to work in Yose
mite during the summers and
through Professor Green he met
Mary Curry. They were drawn to
gether by almost identical tastes —
a common love of nature and out
door sports. They were married in
June of 1920.
RECEIVES DEGREE
"Don continued as president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry com
pany but he returned to Stanford
every fall when the camp closed,
and in 1927 he received his M.D.
degree.
"He was always devoted to Stan
ford and served the University in
many capacities before becoming
president. He enjoyed nothing more
than entertaining students. I only
wish more Stanford people could
have known him as well as I. The
University will feel its loss as deep
ly as do his friends," concluded Mr.
Hoss.
