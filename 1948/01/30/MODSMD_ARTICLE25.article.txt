on job opportunities for women
sponsored by Women's Vocational

neeting.
He introduced the talks by Mel
lon Shelton, music director at Sta
tion KTIM; Marge Dwyer, assistant
traffic director of the ABC network;
and Joe Gillespie, NBC announcer.
Miss Shelton, the representative
speaker from a small radio station,
majored in journalism at Stanford.
She related her experiences as a
"jack - of - all - trades" on KTIM, a
station in Marin County.
Representing the broadcasting

company was Miss Dwyer, graduate
of '47 and speech and drama major
in college. As assistant traffic direc
tor for ABC, Miss Dwyer contrasted
the large station with the small by
saying that "Everything is highly
specialized. You're in one small
niche and never move out of it."
Mr. Zuckerman gave information

fered by Stanford University. Many
specialized courses are given in the
speech and drama department.
Every summer for the last five
years, Stanford has offered the Ra
dio Institute to interested students.
Mr. Gillespie, NBC announcer on
the 5:50 p.m. and 11:55 p.m. news,
gave his criterion for radio success
