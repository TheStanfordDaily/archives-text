# COP, USF to Provide Opposition for Cagers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity cagers will
sport a new lineup, their third
in as many weeks, when they
take the Pavilion tloor tonight at
8 against College of Pacific.
This time the change will be at
center where Bob Penn will start
in place ot Steve Stephenson. There
is a chance that Stephenson, who
was in the rest home one night and
didn't practice most of the week,
will Ijc able to go against Univer
sity of San Francisco tomorrow
night.
Elsewhere, it will be Captain
Babe Higgins at one forward and
Morley Thompson and Bill Rose di
viding the time at the other. Dave
Davidson and Bob Lewis at guard
round out the lineup.
Penn, tallest man on the team at

be playing behind Stephenson all

only two clays of rest before they
swing back into action against
Bradley Tech Tuesday night.

year, and Stanford's All-Coast cen
ter candidate has been playing close
to 40 minutes a game.
This, then, will be Penn's first real
chance to display the form which
made him an alternate first-stringer
on the good Stanford teams of the
early 'forties.
Thompson's return to the fold
will provide relief for Rose, who
still goes into every game with his
leg bandaged up like a race-horse.
Stanford will be favored to beat
the two non - conference foes, al
though both will be pointing for an
upset.
Coach Everett Dean has given his
men a respite from their tough
pi act ice schedule this week in order
to rest weary bones and nurse the
lame and the halt back to health.
Yesterday's practice session was
optional, and Monday the whole
team was given a day off.
Probable starting lineups:
STANFORD COP
Wiggins F Proulx
'1 hompson or
Hose F Pfister
I'cn 11 C Ortez
Davidson G McWilliams
I!. Lewis G Levy
Probable starters for USF to
morrow night are Giesen and
Pennington, forwards: McNamee,
center; Giudice and Ilanley,
guards.

Two basketball teams that are
not considered in the same class
with conference competition but
that have proved themselves
capable of upsetting highly
rated opponents will invade the
Stanford Pavilion this weekend.
The College of Pacific Tigers play
Stanford's cagers tonight, and the
University of San Francisco hoop
men meet the Farm boys tomorrow.
Coach Chris Kjeldsen's Tigers are
in the midst of a late-developing
hot streak, having come back with
recent victories over Santa Barbara
and Pepperdine after losing early -
season games to those same two
teams. Tonight they hope to cori
tinue their late-season drive with a
much-desired upset over the Cards.
McYVILLIAMS A THREAT
If 6-ft. 2-in. Stan McWilliams has
his shooting arm in top shape, a
Pacific win could be in the making.
McWilliams is one of 'those rare
high-point guards. As a freshman
in 1945, he broke the all-time Pa
cific scoring record by massing 3GB
points in 21 games. Now, after a
year of not competing, he is back as
a sophomore and fe leading COP
scorers with 161 points in 12 games.
Backing up McWilliams in the
scoring parade are forwards Bud
Proulx and Hank Pfister. Both are
dangerous men, and are capable of
tanking two points any time they
get a clear shot. Guard A 1 Levy and
center Phil Ortez round out the
starting five.
Pacific also boasts a win over the
Sacramento Senators, who last week
dumped the UCLA Bruins down in
Los Angeles. So using the old com
parison joke, the Tigers definitely
rate a chance. But balancing the
scales are Pacific's losses to Santa
Clara and San Jose State.
DONS ARE GIANT-KILLERS'
San Francisco's dangerous Dons,
often referred to as the "Giant-kill
ers." will probably have a much
better chance than Pacific to turn
the Card-tables.
They have a fast, smooth-working
outfit that has gone through a
tougher than average schedule with
a respectable seven-win. eight-loss
record. San Francisco has wins over
Santa Clara, Utah, Utah State, and
San Jose, and they dropped close
ones to Oregon, California, and
Bradley Tech.


MORLEY THOMPSON, southpaw
forward, will he back on the floor
this weekend after missing the
St. Mary's and Santa Clara en
counters.

Two basketball teams that are

that have proved themselves
capable of upsetting highly
rated opponents will invade the
Stanford Pavilion this weekend.
The College of Pacific Tigers play
Stanford's cagers tonight, and the
University of San Francisco hoop
men meet the Farm boys tomorrow.
Coach Chris Kjeldsen's Tigers are
in the midst of a late-developing
hot streak, having come back with
recent victories over Santa Barbara
and Pepperdine after losing early -
season games to those same two
teams. Tonight they hope to cori
tinue their late-season drive with a
much-desired upset over the Cards.
McYVILLIAMS A THREAT
If 6-ft. 2-in. Stan McWilliams has
his shooting arm in top shape, a
Pacific win could be in the making.
McWilliams is one of 'those rare
high-point guards. As a freshman
in 1945, he broke the all-time Pa
cific scoring record by massing 3GB
points in 21 games. Now, after a
year of not competing, he is back as
a sophomore and fe leading COP
scorers with 161 points in 12 games.
Backing up McWilliams in the
scoring parade are forwards Bud
Proulx and Hank Pfister. Both are
dangerous men, and are capable of
tanking two points any time they
get a clear shot. Guard A 1 Levy and
center Phil Ortez round out the
starting five.
Pacific also boasts a win over the
Sacramento Senators, who last week
dumped the UCLA Bruins down in
Los Angeles. So using the old com
parison joke, the Tigers definitely
rate a chance. But balancing the
scales are Pacific's losses to Santa
Clara and San Jose State.
DONS ARE GIANT-KILLERS'
San Francisco's dangerous Dons,
often referred to as the "Giant-kill
ers." will probably have a much
better chance than Pacific to turn
the Card-tables.
They have a fast, smooth-working
outfit that has gone through a
tougher than average schedule with
a respectable seven-win. eight-loss
record. San Francisco has wins over
Santa Clara, Utah, Utah State, and

San Francisco's dangerous Dons,
often referred to as the "Giant-kill
ers." will probably have a much
better chance than Pacific to turn
the Card-tables.
They have a fast, smooth-working
outfit that has gone through a
tougher than average schedule with
a respectable seven-win. eight-loss
record. San Francisco has wins over
Santa Clara, Utah, Utah State, and
San Jose, and they dropped close
ones to Oregon, California, and
Bradley Tech.

Stanford's varsity cagers will
sport a new lineup, their third
in as many weeks, when they
take the Pavilion tloor tonight at
8 against College of Pacific.
This time the change will be at

in place ot Steve Stephenson. There
is a chance that Stephenson, who
was in the rest home one night and
didn't practice most of the week,

Elsewhere, it will be Captain
Babe Higgins at one forward and

year, and Stanford's All-Coast cen
ter candidate has been playing close
to 40 minutes a game.
This, then, will be Penn's first real
chance to display the form which
made him an alternate first-stringer
on the good Stanford teams of the
early 'forties.
Thompson's return to the fold
will provide relief for Rose, who
still goes into every game with his
leg bandaged up like a race-horse.
Stanford will be favored to beat
the two non - conference foes, al

upset.
Coach Everett Dean has given his
men a respite from their tough

to rest weary bones and nurse the

Yesterday's practice session was

Two basketball teams that are
not considered in the same class
with conference competition but
that have proved themselves
capable of upsetting highly
rated opponents will invade the
Stanford Pavilion this weekend.
The College of Pacific Tigers play
Stanford's cagers tonight, and the
University of San Francisco hoop
men meet the Farm boys tomorrow.
Coach Chris Kjeldsen's Tigers are
in the midst of a late-developing
hot streak, having come back with
recent victories over Santa Barbara
and Pepperdine after losing early -
season games to those same two
teams. Tonight they hope to cori
tinue their late-season drive with a
much-desired upset over the Cards.
McYVILLIAMS A THREAT
If 6-ft. 2-in. Stan McWilliams has
his shooting arm in top shape, a
Pacific win could be in the making.
McWilliams is one of 'those rare
high-point guards. As a freshman
in 1945, he broke the all-time Pa
cific scoring record by massing 3GB
points in 21 games. Now, after a
year of not competing, he is back as
a sophomore and fe leading COP
scorers with 161 points in 12 games.
Backing up McWilliams in the
scoring parade are forwards Bud
Proulx and Hank Pfister. Both are
dangerous men, and are capable of
tanking two points any time they
get a clear shot. Guard A 1 Levy and
center Phil Ortez round out the
starting five.
Pacific also boasts a win over the
Sacramento Senators, who last week
dumped the UCLA Bruins down in
Los Angeles. So using the old com
parison joke, the Tigers definitely
rate a chance. But balancing the
scales are Pacific's losses to Santa
Clara and San Jose State.
