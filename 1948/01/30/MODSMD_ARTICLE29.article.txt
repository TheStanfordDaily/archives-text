spot.

Ken Gardner, Don Patch, and Leon-

The Stanford junior varsity will
meet (lie Cardinal Motors team
of (lie Palo Alio Recreational
League in a preliminary to to
night's game at 6:15.
Probable starters for the jay
vet* are Martin and Byan, for
wards; Acheson, center; Durket
and Lehman, guards.

I ai d Hughes as the lads most likely
to see reserve action. The frosh
mentor describes Campen as "one
;of the most improved men on the
squad." The tall lad is playing his
first season of basketball and has
shown fine talent to go with his
height.
Offensive practice has been
stressed during the enforced layoff
with some fast break drill thrown
in. Like their varsity elders, the
yearlings' defense has held up well
j thus far.
With the addition of the fast
j break to their repertoire, the fresh
i men are a definite threat in the
scoring column. As Dana puts it,
"We've some fine shots on this team
and if they ever got hot the same
night, we would sure give someone
a lot of trouble."
Dana was referring to the scoring
ability of Paul Watson with his one
handed 20-footers, and Fran Wat
son's knack of hitting from all an
gles around the keyhole.
Coach Dana admits that he does
. n't expect a great deal of trouble
from the Piedmonters, but that he
does look for the hardest game of
the season when his charges meet
i San Mateo Junior College next
I Tuesday.

Dana plans to start his regular
quintet against the East Bay lads.
The two Watsons, Paul and Fran,
will handle the forward duties with
Bill Herron playing from the pivot
spot.
Marvin Gelber is back in shape
after injuring his ankle and will
team with Captain Dick Clegg for
guard duties.
Dana has tabbed Harold Campen.
Ken Gardner, Don Patch, and Leon-

The Stanford junior varsity will
meet (lie Cardinal Motors team
of (lie Palo Alio Recreational
League in a preliminary to to
night's game at 6:15.
Probable starters for the jay
vet* are Martin and Byan, for
wards; Acheson, center; Durket
and Lehman, guards.

I ai d Hughes as the lads most likely
to see reserve action. The frosh
mentor describes Campen as "one
;of the most improved men on the
squad." The tall lad is playing his
first season of basketball and has
shown fine talent to go with his
height.
Offensive practice has been
stressed during the enforced layoff
with some fast break drill thrown
in. Like their varsity elders, the
yearlings' defense has held up well
j thus far.
With the addition of the fast
j break to their repertoire, the fresh
i men are a definite threat in the
scoring column. As Dana puts it,
"We've some fine shots on this team
and if they ever got hot the same
night, we would sure give someone
a lot of trouble."
Dana was referring to the scoring
ability of Paul Watson with his one
handed 20-footers, and Fran Wat
son's knack of hitting from all an
gles around the keyhole.
Coach Dana admits that he does
. n't expect a great deal of trouble
from the Piedmonters, but that he
does look for the hardest game of
the season when his charges meet
i San Mateo Junior College next
I Tuesday.
