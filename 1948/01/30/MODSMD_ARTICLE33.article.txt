# Facts About the Quad
## 
### 
Every campus organization is subject to a
certain amount of criticism according to its size.
In view of recent criticisms leveled at the
Quad, a few facts should be presented so that
critics may speak with some knowledge and
perhaps modify their gripes in a practical way.
First, why do some groups pay for Quad
pages and others not? Why, when the book
costs so much already, is it necessary for any
one to pay?
The 1948 Quad will cost $8,000 more than
the '47 yearbook. There are two reasons for
this:
a) Double enrollment plus an effort to in
clude all new organizations and the graduate
schools.
b) Increased printing costs which did not
affect last year's book completely.
The problem the Quad staff faced this year
was how to raise the additional $8,000.
In order to make up this deficit each source
of revenue has been captitalized on and oper
ating expenses have been cut to the minimum.
This was done instead of increasing the price
of the book to S8 or $10. After investigation it
was felt that advertising rates could not be
increased. Organization space rates were not
increased.
Sales to the student body were pushed to
the maximum but only a percentage of the
students will buy, and past years have shown
that this percentage does not vary. Space
allocated to advertising was increased.
Concerning organizations, the Quad set up a

policy, with the aid of the Student Manager.
According to this policy all ASSU organizations
that solicit funds from their members, i.e. living
groups, automatically pay for their Quad pages.
Organizations that have a direct relationship
to the entire campus, and benefit the entire
campus, i.e. Concert Series, are paid for by
the ASSU at the discretion of the Student Man
ager. Actually then there is no group that does
not pay, one way or another. The sole exception
are SAC sponsored athletics, which traditionally
appear free.
As in any policy borderline decisions have
to be made. The Quad allocates space and cost
on the basis of past policies and benefit to
the campus. They have, when they felt the
group was an important part of campus life,
given free pages. These pages relate to the
activities of a group when they represented
Stanford as a whole. Pictures of members, of
groups, and officers are not paid by the Quad.
The second guestion people are asking is
why Village students will not have individual
pictures this year.
The editor of the Quad presented to the
Village Council various ideas for Village repre
sentation. Instead of having page after page of
pictures of a large heterogeneous group, the
Council decided candid shots of each building
would better represent the Village as a unit
and would be more interesting to everyone.
The Village Council, elected representatives
of Village students, approved this plan, and
that is the plan being followed.—M.H.

Sales to the student body were pushed to
the maximum but only a percentage of the
students will buy, and past years have shown
that this percentage does not vary. Space
allocated to advertising was increased.
Concerning organizations, the Quad set up a

policy, with the aid of the Student Manager.
According to this policy all ASSU organizations
that solicit funds from their members, i.e. living
groups, automatically pay for their Quad pages.
Organizations that have a direct relationship
to the entire campus, and benefit the entire
campus, i.e. Concert Series, are paid for by
the ASSU at the discretion of the Student Man
ager. Actually then there is no group that does
not pay, one way or another. The sole exception
are SAC sponsored athletics, which traditionally
appear free.
As in any policy borderline decisions have
to be made. The Quad allocates space and cost
on the basis of past policies and benefit to
the campus. They have, when they felt the
group was an important part of campus life,
given free pages. These pages relate to the
activities of a group when they represented
Stanford as a whole. Pictures of members, of
groups, and officers are not paid by the Quad.
The second guestion people are asking is
why Village students will not have individual
pictures this year.
The editor of the Quad presented to the
Village Council various ideas for Village repre
sentation. Instead of having page after page of
pictures of a large heterogeneous group, the
Council decided candid shots of each building
would better represent the Village as a unit
and would be more interesting to everyone.
The Village Council, elected representatives
of Village students, approved this plan, and
that is the plan being followed.—M.H.
Every campus organization is subject to a
certain amount of criticism according to its size.
In view of recent criticisms leveled at the
Quad, a few facts should be presented so that
critics may speak with some knowledge and
perhaps modify their gripes in a practical way.
First, why do some groups pay for Quad
pages and others not? Why, when the book
costs so much already, is it necessary for any
one to pay?
The 1948 Quad will cost $8,000 more than
the '47 yearbook. There are two reasons for
this:
a) Double enrollment plus an effort to in
clude all new organizations and the graduate
schools.
b) Increased printing costs which did not
affect last year's book completely.
The problem the Quad staff faced this year
was how to raise the additional $8,000.
In order to make up this deficit each source
of revenue has been captitalized on and oper
ating expenses have been cut to the minimum.
This was done instead of increasing the price
of the book to S8 or $10. After investigation it
was felt that advertising rates could not be
increased. Organization space rates were not
increased.

the maximum but only a percentage of the
students will buy, and past years have shown
that this percentage does not vary. Space
