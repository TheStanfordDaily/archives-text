# BULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
I notice that the chairman of the National Com
mittee on Chapters and Charters of Delta Tau Delta
Scholastic Fraternity recently made the statement
that "present day college students are the soberest . . .
group of kids that ever went to college."
Maybe that's why it's so hard to elicit a belly
laugh from students today.
One of my Poly. Sci. professors must have made a
mental note of that the other day. As it must come
to the minds of all professors, a little story came to
his mind during class a couple of days ago.
He was telling of the daughter of Pearl "Good
Earth" Buck, who announced to her famous mother
that she had a caller.
The mother asked whether the caller was Ameri
can or Chinese, and the daughter replied:
"I don't know, I didn't ask her."
The story went over about as big as a Henry Wal
lace campaign in Maine. The story was used to
illustrate a lecture point which I missed, but the
silence which greeted it was comparable to the Re
serve Book Room on a Sunday morning.
The whole thing paid off, however, after the pro
fessor returned the classroom silence and then said:
"Well, laugh, damn ya'."
I can't help but point out that someone once re
marked to Lord Chesterfield (not Mr. A. B. C.) that
man was the only creature endowed with the power
of laughter.
Chesterfield replied that it was because man is
the only creature that deserves to be laughed at.
In order to preserve my "strong C" in that Poly.
Sci. course, I make haste to point out that no analogy
is being made between the professor and Lord Ches
terfield's remark. It just seemed to me to be adequate
proof of nothing in particular.
And as further protection against possible verbal

chastisement, I point out that one of his colleagues
in the Romanic Languages department has suggested
a plan of tolerance for "unguarded remarks." The lat
ter professor has suggested that professors be allowed
10 "unguarded remarks" per quarter. (13 during spring
quarter).
I think it is a great idea, but demand that I be
allowed the same privileges. After all, what is sauce
for the goose must certainly be sauce for my candor!
Tiie author of the plan suggests that after a profes
sor has used up his allowance, he be fined $1.00 for
each "unguarded remark" made thereafter. I am willing
to abide by the same plan. What with teachers' sal
aries as they are, I may be able to hold out longer
than the professors.
In the interest of bureaucracy, I suggest that a
student-faculty committee be appointed to define "un
guarded remark." For example: If I say that Professor
Schmiddling is an incompetent fool and should be
umpiring the ball games at Alcatraz instead of grad
ing my papers, have I necessarily committed an un
guarded remark, or does the truth of the statement
provide immunity?
And if Prof. Schmiddling says:
"That kid Sargent wasn't born, he was knitted,"
does the implication of my Mother constitute two,
or merely one unguarded remark?
The plan definitely needs some administrative work
done on it. Maybe the Men's Council would like to
work on it, they're not doing much these days.
Anyway, I salute the author of the plan over in
the Romanic Languages department, and suggest that
we have an efficiency expert install the system. An
efficiency expert—that's a man who says his prayers
on New Year's Eve, and then jumps into bed during
the rest of the year shouting "ditto."

can or Chinese, and the daughter replied:
"I don't know, I didn't ask her."
The story went over about as big as a Henry Wal
lace campaign in Maine. The story was used to
illustrate a lecture point which I missed, but the
silence which greeted it was comparable to the Re
serve Book Room on a Sunday morning.
The whole thing paid off, however, after the pro
fessor returned the classroom silence and then said:
"Well, laugh, damn ya'."
I can't help but point out that someone once re
marked to Lord Chesterfield (not Mr. A. B. C.) that
man was the only creature endowed with the power
of laughter.
Chesterfield replied that it was because man is
the only creature that deserves to be laughed at.
In order to preserve my "strong C" in that Poly.
Sci. course, I make haste to point out that no analogy
is being made between the professor and Lord Ches
terfield's remark. It just seemed to me to be adequate
proof of nothing in particular.
And as further protection against possible verbal

chastisement, I point out that one of his colleagues
in the Romanic Languages department has suggested
a plan of tolerance for "unguarded remarks." The lat
ter professor has suggested that professors be allowed
10 "unguarded remarks" per quarter. (13 during spring
quarter).
I think it is a great idea, but demand that I be
allowed the same privileges. After all, what is sauce
for the goose must certainly be sauce for my candor!
Tiie author of the plan suggests that after a profes
sor has used up his allowance, he be fined $1.00 for
each "unguarded remark" made thereafter. I am willing
to abide by the same plan. What with teachers' sal
aries as they are, I may be able to hold out longer
than the professors.
In the interest of bureaucracy, I suggest that a
student-faculty committee be appointed to define "un
guarded remark." For example: If I say that Professor
Schmiddling is an incompetent fool and should be
umpiring the ball games at Alcatraz instead of grad
ing my papers, have I necessarily committed an un
guarded remark, or does the truth of the statement
provide immunity?
And if Prof. Schmiddling says:
"That kid Sargent wasn't born, he was knitted,"
does the implication of my Mother constitute two,
or merely one unguarded remark?
The plan definitely needs some administrative work
done on it. Maybe the Men's Council would like to
work on it, they're not doing much these days.
Anyway, I salute the author of the plan over in
the Romanic Languages department, and suggest that
we have an efficiency expert install the system. An
efficiency expert—that's a man who says his prayers
on New Year's Eve, and then jumps into bed during
the rest of the year shouting "ditto."
I notice that the chairman of the National Com
mittee on Chapters and Charters of Delta Tau Delta
Scholastic Fraternity recently made the statement
that "present day college students are the soberest . . .
group of kids that ever went to college."
Maybe that's why it's so hard to elicit a belly
laugh from students today.
One of my Poly. Sci. professors must have made a
mental note of that the other day. As it must come
to the minds of all professors, a little story came to
his mind during class a couple of days ago.
He was telling of the daughter of Pearl "Good
Earth" Buck, who announced to her famous mother
that she had a caller.
The mother asked whether the caller was Ameri
can or Chinese, and the daughter replied:
"I don't know, I didn't ask her."
