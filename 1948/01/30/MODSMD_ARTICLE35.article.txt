### GEORGE BRUNN 
In the ivy halls of Harvard a man spoke last June.
His voiee brought new hope to a weary and wrecked
continent. He called on the countries of Europe to
unite in a common effort of reconstruction; he pledged
our resources, our aid, our backing.
Secretary Marshall spoke ably. "Our policy is di
rected not against any country or doctrine but
against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos."
Today that hope is dying. And as it dies so will
people and nations. What happened to the Marshall
Plan in the past seven months?
Many things. Sixteen European countries met in
Paris and worked out a detailed program. It set produc
tion and trade goals, specified the minimum aid that
would be needed. It looked toward unprecedented
cooperation.
When this plan was submitted to us we first
scaled it down by seven billion dollars. In October
we said even that amount would have to be reduced
.iind the plan completely re-writtcn. All the minimum
goals set at Paris became completely unattainable.
Once again we offered the man who needed a quart of
blood to live on a pint. Once again we offered relief
instead of reconstruction.
Disillusioned, the European countries turned their
ideas over to us for reformulation. The Harriman com
mittee wrote a new report. Where Marshall had spoken
of fighting hunger and poverty, not ideologies, Harri
man wrote that the plan is directed against "a system
where iron discipline by the state ruthlessly stamped
out individual liberty."
Where the sixteen countries had planned a modest
rate of capital investment, the State Department criti
cized it as too ambitious despite the fact that it has
not been large enough even to repair war damage. We
cut the heart out of the program by offering none of
the needed steel scrap and only a third ol the re
quested crude steel.
President Trurnan blames this on shortages here
at home. Howevei the requests don't even equal
5 percent of our pioduetion and if we are so short why
iiii| wi ollÂ« i the ' lime .1 miK h finished steel as was
asked? The b " 112 > on why Europe can't get steel

is that our steel companies have taken over Europe's
prewar markets and are now making fabulous profits
charging buyers abroad two or three times the U.S.
price. While our consumers must sacrifice through
higher prices and less goods, our industry sacrifices
nothing. But Europe cannot recover on handouts.
Where the sixteen countries had considered it es
sential that German reconstruction be subordinated
to the recovery of all. we have precisely reversed this.
Secretary of the Army Royall said last month that
we intend to make Germany the cornerstone of
European recovery. Besides being politically danger
ous, as we might have learned from our recent exper
iences, this is economically unsound.
The prosperity of Europe doesn't depend as much
on Germany as Harriman thinks. Only 6 percent of
French foreign trade dealt with Germany before the
war, and only 4 percent of British. Nevertheless,
while the Paris plan allotted 15 percent of the total
aid to Germany, we plan to give them 27 percent.
We have already forbidden western Europe to get
reparations, now we deprive it of vitally needed aid
because we want to turn the Reich into a buffer state
against Russia. It might be noted that American inter
ests have obtained majority control of the boards of
directors of Germany economic authorities.
It might also be noted that by strange coincidence
Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Secretary of Commerce
Harriman, and two Assistant Secretaries of State for
merly worked for two Wall Street investment houses
that handled 88 percent of postwar private invest
ments in the Ruhr.
Finally, while the Paris plan called for cooperative
European administration, the present program provides
not only for American administration but forced com
pliance with our ideas of foreign trade controls, rates
of exchange, and currency stabilization. Once a coun
try becomes aconomically dependent in this way, it
cannot stay politically independent very long.
Many specters are haunting Europe- the specters
of hunger, revolution and war. The Marshall Plan
in its form now before Congress cannot stop them.
Unless they are stopped they will soon haunt us.
