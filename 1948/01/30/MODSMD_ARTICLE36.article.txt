Professors 1. James Quillen and
Henry B. McDaniel of the School of
Education are in Sacramento today
at die request of Gov. Earl Warren
to attend his Conference on Youth
Welfare.
The purpose of the conference is
to assess the needs and opportuni
ties of California's younger citizens.
It was called upon the recommen
dation of the Governor's Youth
Committee, the Crime Commission
on Juvenile Justice, the Judicial
Couiicil, and the Youth Authority.
Welfare leaders from the entire
state have been invited to discuss
the problems of youth employment,
schools, law enforcement, recrea
tion, community co-ordination, and
the church. The conference findings
will be published, and it is the Gov

facilitate execution of the recom
mendations locally.

sor of pediatrics, and Miss Patricia
