# Mystery Strikes Sunday Movies
## 
### 
With apologies for the poor en
tertainment value offered by last
Sunday's potpourri of Bing Crosby's
early two-reelers, Bob Kinsinger,
Sunday Evening Movie manager,
states that the Movie Series will
present a well-known film favorite
of the early 'thirties, '"I Cover the
Waterfront," this week.
Rich in the mystery, glamor, and
sordid .contrasts of San Francisco's
port life, "I Cover the Waterfront"
presents Claudette Colbert in her
best early screen classic. The story,
based upon a newsman's account of
His waterfront experiences, stars
Miss Colbert as the enticing daugh
ter of a notorious smuggler of Chi
namen who drowns the evidence
(i.e., the Chinamen) when revenue
officials get too inquisitive.
In addition, ever reliable Tom
Mix again tangles with X-94 agents
and the evil wiles of the Indian
Longboat in episodes six and seven
of "The Miracle Rider."
The show begins at 7:30 p.m. in
the Memorial Auditorium. Admis
sion is 20 cents.
