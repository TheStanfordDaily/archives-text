# Excom Approves New Launch for drew; NSA Charier Passed After Compromise
## 
### 
(Ed. note: The review of Wednes
day night's Excom meeting was pre
pared by Exeom member B. J. Den
ning).
At the Crew's request, Excom
Wednesday night voted to give
them S2OO to add to money do
nated to the Crew by alumni,
to purchase a launch, needed
by the Crew for coaehing on the
water. In addition, they received
$100 for operating expenses.
With GO men out for Crew, they
have five shells on the water, and
Excom felt that their request was
justified, in that it is impossible to
have adequate coaching without a
launch. This year the Crew has pur
chased two new shells and alumni
donated money for two sets of oars.
NSA CHARTER
The Stanford National Students
Association's charter was approved
by Excom, after a compromise was
worked out by which two Excom
members, two NSA Central Commit
tee members, and the outgoing
chairman of NSA will select the new
chairman. Excom last week split on
election of the chairman by the
student body. A by-law change was
passed to grant the NSA chairman
an ex-officio scat on Excom.
Excom at its meeting moved to
donate $500 to the March of Dimes
from the Emergency Relief Fund.
RAM'S HEAD
The new Ram's Head charter, sub
stituting a Ram's Head financial

committee for the present Dramat
ics Council was presented to Ex
come, but action was tabled until
llic Excom constitutions committee
has checked the details of the char
ter. Dramatics Council was original
ly created to coordinate the sev
eral student dramatics groups on
campus, which Ram's Head replaced
in
The proposed charter makes any
one who has earned 15 points in
student productions automatically a
member of Ram's Head. A student
interested in becoming business
manager may earn 10 of these points
assisting the financial committee.
S l> A APPROVED
After hearing the constitutions
committee's report by Ted Norton,
Excom voted its approval of the
Stanford chapter of the Students for
Democratic Action as an independ
ent organization. The other mem
bers of the committee, who talked
with the representations of the cam
pus group were Bob Hoyt and Jack
Rich.
The SDA is a political group with
the meaning given to "political" by
Excom—"that is, its primary object
and intent is politics."
To the question of its partisanship,
the committee did not feel it neces
sary to give a definite answer to the
question. Both the national and local
constitutions state certain "basic
principles" of SDA and membership
is open only to those who accept
those basic principles.
The report states, however, that

the national constitution grants local
autonomy to the local groups, and
the local group has been informed
by the national secretary that they
are lice to "actively oppose national
policy stands." They arc free to con
sider and discuss the facts and come
to a conclusion based on such con
sideration, without regard to their
preconceived opinions or the deci

sions of <1 national body and arc
free to hold l<> these conclusions of
their own.
"The Stanford chapter pledges it
self. in spite of its name, by two
provisions of its constitution, to
avoid political action" as defined by
Excom, Norton explained. The local
group proposes to organizo meetings
and discussions, present speakers on
current issues with all sides repre
sented if possible, with full provision
for questions and discussion.
Excom members believed that this
organization, as proposed, does not
come within the policy of any parti
san political action groups on cam
pus decided by them last, fall, but
can fill a definite place on the Stan
ford campus through free discus
sions and presentation of all sides of
political issues.
JUNIOR VARSITY AWARDS
Because junior varsity men put
as much time and effort into their
sport as varsity men, Excom felt
that major sport junior varsity teams
with a regular schedule of events
should receive recognition for their
work. They pointed out, however,
that it should be an award other
than the Circle S, the regular award
for minor sports, to distinguish JV
letter holders from Circle S men.
Action was tabled until require
ments for the award can be set up
and the award agreed upon.
The meeting was immediately ad
journed in respect for Dr. Tresidder
when Excom was notified of his
death.

IV J. DENNING, member of Ex
com from Lagunita. who prepared
the review of Wednesday's Excom
meeting.
(Ed. note: The review of Wednes
day night's Excom meeting was pre
pared by Exeom member B. J. Den
ning).
At the Crew's request, Excom
Wednesday night voted to give
them S2OO to add to money do
nated to the Crew by alumni,
to purchase a launch, needed
by the Crew for coaehing on the
water. In addition, they received
$100 for operating expenses.
With GO men out for Crew, they
have five shells on the water, and
Excom felt that their request was
justified, in that it is impossible to
have adequate coaching without a
launch. This year the Crew has pur
chased two new shells and alumni
donated money for two sets of oars.
NSA CHARTER
The Stanford National Students
Association's charter was approved
by Excom, after a compromise was
worked out by which two Excom
members, two NSA Central Commit
tee members, and the outgoing
chairman of NSA will select the new
chairman. Excom last week split on
election of the chairman by the
student body. A by-law change was
passed to grant the NSA chairman
an ex-officio scat on Excom.
Excom at its meeting moved to
donate $500 to the March of Dimes
from the Emergency Relief Fund.
RAM'S HEAD
The new Ram's Head charter, sub
stituting a Ram's Head financial

committee for the present Dramat
ics Council was presented to Ex
come, but action was tabled until
llic Excom constitutions committee
has checked the details of the char
ter. Dramatics Council was original
ly created to coordinate the sev
eral student dramatics groups on
campus, which Ram's Head replaced
in
The proposed charter makes any
one who has earned 15 points in
student productions automatically a
member of Ram's Head. A student
interested in becoming business
manager may earn 10 of these points
assisting the financial committee.
S l> A APPROVED
After hearing the constitutions
committee's report by Ted Norton,
Excom voted its approval of the
Stanford chapter of the Students for
Democratic Action as an independ
ent organization. The other mem
bers of the committee, who talked
with the representations of the cam
pus group were Bob Hoyt and Jack
Rich.
The SDA is a political group with
the meaning given to "political" by
Excom—"that is, its primary object
and intent is politics."
To the question of its partisanship,
the committee did not feel it neces
sary to give a definite answer to the
question. Both the national and local
constitutions state certain "basic
principles" of SDA and membership
is open only to those who accept
those basic principles.
The report states, however, that

the national constitution grants local
autonomy to the local groups, and
the local group has been informed
by the national secretary that they
are lice to "actively oppose national
policy stands." They arc free to con
sider and discuss the facts and come
to a conclusion based on such con
sideration, without regard to their
preconceived opinions or the deci

sions of <1 national body and arc
free to hold l<> these conclusions of
their own.
"The Stanford chapter pledges it
self. in spite of its name, by two
provisions of its constitution, to
avoid political action" as defined by
Excom, Norton explained. The local
group proposes to organizo meetings
and discussions, present speakers on
current issues with all sides repre
sented if possible, with full provision
for questions and discussion.
Excom members believed that this
organization, as proposed, does not
come within the policy of any parti
san political action groups on cam
pus decided by them last, fall, but
can fill a definite place on the Stan
ford campus through free discus
sions and presentation of all sides of
political issues.
JUNIOR VARSITY AWARDS
Because junior varsity men put
as much time and effort into their
sport as varsity men, Excom felt
that major sport junior varsity teams
with a regular schedule of events
should receive recognition for their
work. They pointed out, however,
that it should be an award other
than the Circle S, the regular award
for minor sports, to distinguish JV
letter holders from Circle S men.
Action was tabled until require
ments for the award can be set up
and the award agreed upon.
The meeting was immediately ad
journed in respect for Dr. Tresidder
when Excom was notified of his
death.

com from Lagunita. who prepared
the review of Wednesday's Excom
meeting.
(Ed. note: The review of Wednes
day night's Excom meeting was pre
pared by Exeom member B. J. Den
ning).
At the Crew's request, Excom
Wednesday night voted to give
them S2OO to add to money do
nated to the Crew by alumni,
to purchase a launch, needed
by the Crew for coaehing on the
water. In addition, they received
$100 for operating expenses.
With GO men out for Crew, they
have five shells on the water, and
Excom felt that their request was
justified, in that it is impossible to
have adequate coaching without a
launch. This year the Crew has pur
chased two new shells and alumni
donated money for two sets of oars.
NSA CHARTER
The Stanford National Students
Association's charter was approved
by Excom, after a compromise was
worked out by which two Excom
members, two NSA Central Commit
tee members, and the outgoing
chairman of NSA will select the new
chairman. Excom last week split on
election of the chairman by the
student body. A by-law change was
passed to grant the NSA chairman
an ex-officio scat on Excom.
Excom at its meeting moved to
donate $500 to the March of Dimes
from the Emergency Relief Fund.
RAM'S HEAD
The new Ram's Head charter, sub
stituting a Ram's Head financial

committee for the present Dramat
ics Council was presented to Ex
come, but action was tabled until
llic Excom constitutions committee
has checked the details of the char
ter. Dramatics Council was original
ly created to coordinate the sev
eral student dramatics groups on
campus, which Ram's Head replaced
in
The proposed charter makes any
one who has earned 15 points in
student productions automatically a
member of Ram's Head. A student
interested in becoming business
manager may earn 10 of these points
assisting the financial committee.
S l> A APPROVED
After hearing the constitutions
committee's report by Ted Norton,
Excom voted its approval of the
Stanford chapter of the Students for
Democratic Action as an independ
ent organization. The other mem
bers of the committee, who talked
with the representations of the cam
pus group were Bob Hoyt and Jack
Rich.
The SDA is a political group with
the meaning given to "political" by
Excom—"that is, its primary object
and intent is politics."
To the question of its partisanship,
the committee did not feel it neces
sary to give a definite answer to the
question. Both the national and local
constitutions state certain "basic
principles" of SDA and membership
is open only to those who accept
those basic principles.
The report states, however, that

the national constitution grants local
autonomy to the local groups, and
the local group has been informed
by the national secretary that they
are lice to "actively oppose national
policy stands." They arc free to con
sider and discuss the facts and come
to a conclusion based on such con
sideration, without regard to their
preconceived opinions or the deci

sions of <1 national body and arc
free to hold l<> these conclusions of
their own.
"The Stanford chapter pledges it
self. in spite of its name, by two
provisions of its constitution, to
avoid political action" as defined by
Excom, Norton explained. The local
group proposes to organizo meetings
and discussions, present speakers on
current issues with all sides repre
sented if possible, with full provision
for questions and discussion.
Excom members believed that this
organization, as proposed, does not
come within the policy of any parti
san political action groups on cam
pus decided by them last, fall, but
can fill a definite place on the Stan
ford campus through free discus
sions and presentation of all sides of
political issues.
JUNIOR VARSITY AWARDS
Because junior varsity men put
as much time and effort into their
sport as varsity men, Excom felt
that major sport junior varsity teams
with a regular schedule of events
should receive recognition for their
work. They pointed out, however,
that it should be an award other
than the Circle S, the regular award
for minor sports, to distinguish JV
letter holders from Circle S men.
Action was tabled until require
ments for the award can be set up
and the award agreed upon.
The meeting was immediately ad
journed in respect for Dr. Tresidder
when Excom was notified of his
death.
