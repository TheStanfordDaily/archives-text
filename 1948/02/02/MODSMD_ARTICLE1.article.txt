# SAC, Men's Council Voting Scheduled for Wednesday
## 
### 
Campus-wide voting to eliminate all but four candidates for
the Stanford Athletic Council and short-term Men's Council will
take place Wednesday, Goxdon Luce, Election Board chairman,
announced.
Cliff Carlsen, campaign funds chairman, warned candidates

not. to spend over a $10 total for the
primary and final elections com
bined.
"I'd also like to caution friends
against becoming over - anxious in
supporting their candidates," Carl
son continued. "It may become nec
essary to disqualify a candidate if
too much money is spent on his
publicity."
voting booths
All students, both men and women,
are eligible to vote for SAC, Luce
pointed out, but only men may vote
for the Men's Council position.
Voting booths will be located at
the Post Office, Cellar, Library, His
tory corner, and at the -Village.
"The purpose of the primary elec
tion," Luce explained, "is to limit
the number of choices on the pref
erential to four. But since there are
two positions on Women's Council
and three positions on Men's Coun
cil, direct voting and not pcferen
tial is used.
"That is, each voter votes for two
women or three men and does not
indicate his first, second, and third
choices. For this reason these offices
will appear on the final ballot only.
Since there were not more than four
candidates fo the Excom districts
or senior class secretary, these of
fices will also appear on the final
ballot."
