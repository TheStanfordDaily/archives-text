"It is difficult to find words
which express the grief of all of us
who have known Don Tresidder

his brilliant mind, his sterling hon
esty, and his moral courage were
the Ijackgound of his every action.
His passing is a great loss to Stan
ford. We had looked forward with

thank Thee for all he was to those
who loved him and to those he
served. With gratitude we remember
his love and loyalty for Stanford
University and his steadfast devo
tion to public duty and responsibil
ity."

HOOVER'S WIRE
Dr. Wilbur read a telegram from
former President Herbert Hoover
which is quoted as follows:
"It is difficult to find words
which express the grief of all of us
who have known Don Tresidder
over these many years. His devot
ed frinedship and his sympathetic
character bound everyone to him;
his brilliant mind, his sterling hon
esty, and his moral courage were
the Ijackgound of his every action.
His passing is a great loss to Stan
ford. We had looked forward with
such confidence to its future under
his guidance. Great as our loss may
be, it is to Mrs. Tresidder that our
hearts extend at this time."
(The full text of Chancellor
Wilbur's address is presented on
page 2.)
Chaplain Minto expressed the
feeling of all those present in his
closing prayer. "Almighty God, we
give Thee heart thanks for life and
service of him whom Thou hast tak
en from our midst so that sorrow
fills our hearts. We bless Thee for all
Thy loving kindness to him through
out the years of his early life; we
thank Thee for all he was to those
who loved him and to those he
served. With gratitude we remember
his love and loyalty for Stanford
University and his steadfast devo
tion to public duty and responsibil
ity."
