â€”Secret service agents have uncov
ered evidence of a nationwide con
spiracy by Hindu extremists to as
sassinate Premier Jawaharlal Nehru
and other leading members of the
Congress party, including cabinet
ministers, reliable police sources

Police and secret service squads
searched in New Delhi and other
great cities for extremist leaders,
believing that the assassination of
Mohandas K. Gandhi was only the
first move in a plot to liquidate all
opponents of the extremist demand
for Hindu rule of the entire sub
continent.
TURBULENT MOBS
Turbulent mobs of Hindus, their
sorrow over the death of Gandhi
turned to rage, surged though the
streets of the capital wrecking
homes and business establishments
of known extremists.
Fatal rioting continued for the
third day in Bombay, bringing the
death toll to 23, and mob vengeance
was reported from other towns.
One of the first extremists ar
rested here in the search for those
behind the plot to kill Nehru and
other leaders, as well as Gandhi,
was C. V. Deshpandes, general sec
retary of the All-India Hindu Ma
hasabha organization, largest of
those militant groups which demand
over-all Hindu rule.
EXTREMIST GROUP
Involved in the plot also, accord
ing to police, is the Hashlriya Sewak
Sangha extremist organization, to
which Narayan Vinayak Gadse,
Gandhi's assassin, belonged.
Police arc now understood t<> lie
convinced that there was a close
connection between Gandhi's assas
sination, an unsuccessful attempt to
bomb him Jan. 20, and the arrest at
Amritsar last Thursday of two Hin
dus who were carrying hand- gre
nades near the spot where Premier
Nehru was making a speech.
