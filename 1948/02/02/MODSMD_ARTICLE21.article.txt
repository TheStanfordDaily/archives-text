# Congress Will Review Tax Cut, Marshall Bill
## New Foreign Aid Plan Includes China, Greece 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP)—
Barring unforeseen develop
ments, Secretary of State
George C. Marshall tomorrow
will hand Congress a new bill
for foreign aid spending, including
funds for China, Greece and the oc
cupied areas.
Added to initial costs of the Eur
opean recovery program, it will
raise the estimate for the next fiscal
year's relief and reconstruction
planning to about $8,000,000,000 and
may touch off a new storm among
strong Republican forces who think
the administration is spending too
fast and too freely abroad.
EXPORT CEILINGS
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R. 0., said
meanwhile that he foresees "a lot
of support" for a GOP move to slap
export ceilings on such products as
steel and oil, which are scarce here.
The figures, it is understood, in
clude relief for China, a second in
stallment on the "quarantine com
munism'' program in Greece, and
new funds for occupied Germany,
Austria, Japan and Korea.
On another front, Sen. Joseph H.
Ball, R., Minn., has submitted a new
Marshall plan program to legislative
drafters. It represents the views of
a score of Republican "revisionists,''
who want major changes in the ad
ministration program.
"NO VOTES"
There is little likelihood, how
ever, that it will get very far. As
Sen. Tom Connally, D., Tex., put it,
"They haven't got the votes."
Nevertheless Ball claims strong
support for the revisionists. They
wouid split relief assistance to West
ern Europe from recovery phases.
They would limit the aid adminis
trator to grants of assistance for spe
cific projects—the rebuilding of a
bomb devastated railroad for in
stance—rather than a lump sum
grant of recovery funds for unspeci
fied projects.
Ball believes that such a program
would hold recovery funds to about
$2,000,000,000 for the next 15 months


SECRETARY OF STATE George
C. Marshall, whose new plan for
European relief will be presented
to Congress tomorrow.
