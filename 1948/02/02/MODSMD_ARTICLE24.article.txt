"The most frequent charge made
against the American Communists is
that they advocate the violent over

maverick said. "I have not seen evi
dence to substantiate the charge,
and I do find a supreme court deci
sion that this conclusion is unwar
ranted.
"Any Communists who support
(lie Independent ticket will he
supporting our program, not the
Communist program. I am not a
Communist or Socialist or Marx
ist of any description, but I find
nothing criminal in the advocacy
of different econmoic and social
ideas, however much I may dif
fer with them."
The pledge proposed by Wallace:
"I shall not knowingly accept the
support of any individual or group
advocating the limitation of demo

individual or group which would
restrict the civil liberties of others
for reasons of race, color or creed;
nor the support of any individual or
group advocating the violent over
throw of the government of the
United States."
Three groups of candidates could
not take the pledge, Wallace said.
He said they were candidates who
support the Taft-Hartley law: those
who believe in "white supremacy."
and those who would limit the free
flow of ideas in this country.
