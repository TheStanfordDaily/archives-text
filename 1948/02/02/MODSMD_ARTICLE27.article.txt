# Senate May Sidetrack House Income Tax Cut
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP)—
The House votes tomorrow to
give the nation's big and little
taxpayers a $6,500,000,000 in
come tax cut, but the Senate
may sidetrack it in favor of a less
costly plan.
House Republican leaders today
predicted a two-to-one majority for
the election-year general tax reduc
tion sponsored by Chairman Harold
Knutson, R., Minn., of the ways and
means committee. He was confident
it would survive a threatened presi
dential veto.
KNUTSON BILL
The Knutson bill would give the
taxpayers a $100 increase in per
sonal tax exemptions, reduce their
taxes by from 10 to 30 percent, and
give all of them the privilege of
using the community property sys
tem of splitting income for tax pur
poses.
Democrats plan one attempt, to
scuttle the plan. They will ask the
House to return it to Knutson's com
mittee for rewriting. They want to
keep the community property idea,
but eliminate the percentage cuts in
favor of a $200 increase in personal
exemptions. And they hope to make
up the lost revenue through an ex
cess profits tax on wealthy corpor
ations.
LACKS SUPPORT
The Democratic counter proposal
has no chance of getting House ap
proval, and stands little likelihood
of attracting Senate support.
"In my opinion, that kind of a bill
will not pass the Senate," said Chair
man Eugene Millikan, R., Colo., of
the Senate finance committee.
Mr. Truman has asked permission
to spend $39,668,000,000 but Congress
is thinking of shaving at least $3,-
000.000,000 off the request.
The senate may require a month
or longer to get around to income
tax revision. When it does, it prob
ably will reduce the percentage cuts
in Knutson's bill, so that the biggest
reduction will be no more than 15
percent. This would trim the annual
revenue loss to about $4,500,000,000,
and some Democrats think that Mr.
Truman may be talked into approv
ing it.

poses.
Democrats plan one attempt, to
scuttle the plan. They will ask the
House to return it to Knutson's com
mittee for rewriting. They want to
keep the community property idea,
but eliminate the percentage cuts in
favor of a $200 increase in personal
exemptions. And they hope to make
up the lost revenue through an ex
cess profits tax on wealthy corpor
ations.
LACKS SUPPORT
The Democratic counter proposal
has no chance of getting House ap
proval, and stands little likelihood
of attracting Senate support.
"In my opinion, that kind of a bill
will not pass the Senate," said Chair
man Eugene Millikan, R., Colo., of
the Senate finance committee.
Mr. Truman has asked permission
to spend $39,668,000,000 but Congress
is thinking of shaving at least $3,-
000.000,000 off the request.
The senate may require a month
or longer to get around to income
tax revision. When it does, it prob
ably will reduce the percentage cuts
in Knutson's bill, so that the biggest
reduction will be no more than 15
percent. This would trim the annual
revenue loss to about $4,500,000,000,
and some Democrats think that Mr.
Truman may be talked into approv
ing it.
