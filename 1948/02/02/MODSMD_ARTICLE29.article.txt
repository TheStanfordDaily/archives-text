# Text of Dr. Wilbur's Address
## 
### 
(This is the complete text of Dr.
Kay Lyman Wilbur's memorial
address delivered yesterday in the
Stanford Memorial Church).
Don Tresidder had three outstand
ing loyalties and loves Mary Tres
idder, Stanford University, and the
high hills. To them he gave a rare
warmth of devotion.
While he was Stanford's president
for hut little more than four years,
it was during a period of fierce ac
tivity and change. He had gotten by
the first and toughest years and

| .could see brighter daylight ahead.
The impact of this war and postwar
period compelled many new deci
sions as to policy and personnel.
Fortunately, he had been steeped
in Stanford ways and was filled
from youth on with the simplicity
and genuine character of David
Starr Jordan's conception of a uni
versity. '
LAST TRIP
Just before lie started on this last
eastern trip, Don came in to see me.
I had encouraged him to accept re
sponsibility for membership on a
small committee to re-develop the
Association of American Universi
ties. The Association had slackened
pace under the urge of war; hut it
could, as we saw it, represent the
universities in dealing wilh the pres
sures of the day and, by working
together, protect the future threat
ened by lack of income, govern
mental control of research, a dilu
tion of the quality of teaching, and
larger student bodies.
In that last talk we had together
1 pointed out to him the fallacy of
the old saw that the place of a uni
versity president all the year was
at home, doing routine administra
tion and perhaps discipline, On the
contrary, I told him, if he is to be
effective in holding and appointing
an adequate faculty in a university
of national and even world scope,
the university president must be a
traveler and a good auditor at na

tional meetings of various sorts.
Don Tresidder was a good talent
scout. He entered upon the search
tor men wilh the keen instincts of
a natural hunter. As a lover of his
fellow man he felt the loneliness of
being the head man, but knew that
he must provide the initiative for
new policies and new faculty mem
bers. At once, he sensed that upon
him rested' the unpleasant duty of
judging his l'cllowmen and of assay
ing their development and progress
and, above all, of being lair—par
ticularly to the University itself,
for he represented the faculty and
student interest. He It'll that the
endowed university wilh its free
doms filled a position in the life of
our America that was unique in the
world and of inestimable value. Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford's "Univers
ity of High Degree" became his
ideal, worthy of great sacrifice if
need be.
In the summer of 1941, after Dr.
Tresidder had become a Stanford
Trustee, I rode over from the Tuo
lumne Meadows via the Vogelsang
Pass trail to his camp on the Merced
liver. When he invited me to be his
guest I had his assurance of a long
enough sleeping bag and some good
fishing. I was planning to let the
reins go and retire from the Uni
versity presidency. In Ihe twenty
four hours we had together up there
along the headwaters of the Mer
ced, we had one of those penetrat
ing conversations in which we anal
yzed Stanford and put everything
through tin* wringer.
FORCE OF STANFORD
In those lovely surroundings an
idealistic Stanford held our full at
tention. Stanford seemed to us one
of the greatest forces in our coun
try and worthy of the best we could
give it. Between us we knew most
of the men and women of Stanford
since its earliest days. With growing
pride we named them over with
their achievements. We felt that the
president to be selected by the
Trustees as my successor must feel
the name urge as we did. There was
a search on for such a man through
a special committee on selection of
the president.
They searched far and near, and
it took some little time for us to find
that the rare man we sought was
close at hand—like treasure found
in one's own garden after a long
search for it elsewhex-e. He was a
Stanford man in our own Stanford
family. When the Trustees announc
ed his unanimous election as our
president, it seemed almost provi
dential.
LEAVES IMPRESS
In these few years Don Tresidder
has made an impress on Stanford
of far-reaching significance. Even
in our sorrow, we can view with
pride and satisfaction what he has
been able to do, and.mark a not
able progress. Don loved our serene
and beautiful campus while yet re
taining his great love for the high
hills of the Sierra.
There will be many more presi
dents of Stanford, but there will
never be another more capable of
enjoying our campus and our hills
and their reach out to all of Cali
fornia. What sweet and inspiring
memories he leaves with us all!

fellow man he felt the loneliness of
being the head man, but knew that
he must provide the initiative for
new policies and new faculty mem
bers. At once, he sensed that upon
him rested' the unpleasant duty of
judging his l'cllowmen and of assay
ing their development and progress
and, above all, of being lair—par
ticularly to the University itself,
for he represented the faculty and
student interest. He It'll that the

world and of inestimable value. Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford's "Univers
ity of High Degree" became his
ideal, worthy of great sacrifice if
need be.
In the summer of 1941, after Dr.
Tresidder had become a Stanford
Trustee, I rode over from the Tuo
lumne Meadows via the Vogelsang
Pass trail to his camp on the Merced
liver. When he invited me to be his
guest I had his assurance of a long
enough sleeping bag and some good
fishing. I was planning to let the
reins go and retire from the Uni
versity presidency. In Ihe twenty
four hours we had together up there
along the headwaters of the Mer
ced, we had one of those penetrat
ing conversations in which we anal
yzed Stanford and put everything
through tin* wringer.
FORCE OF STANFORD
In those lovely surroundings an
idealistic Stanford held our full at
tention. Stanford seemed to us one
of the greatest forces in our coun
try and worthy of the best we could
give it. Between us we knew most
of the men and women of Stanford
since its earliest days. With growing
pride we named them over with
their achievements. We felt that the
president to be selected by the
Trustees as my successor must feel
the name urge as we did. There was
a search on for such a man through
a special committee on selection of
the president.
They searched far and near, and
it took some little time for us to find
that the rare man we sought was
close at hand—like treasure found
in one's own garden after a long
search for it elsewhex-e. He was a
Stanford man in our own Stanford
family. When the Trustees announc
ed his unanimous election as our
president, it seemed almost provi
dential.
LEAVES IMPRESS
In these few years Don Tresidder
has made an impress on Stanford
of far-reaching significance. Even
in our sorrow, we can view with
pride and satisfaction what he has
been able to do, and.mark a not
able progress. Don loved our serene
and beautiful campus while yet re
taining his great love for the high
hills of the Sierra.
There will be many more presi
dents of Stanford, but there will
never be another more capable of
enjoying our campus and our hills
and their reach out to all of Cali
fornia. What sweet and inspiring
memories he leaves with us all!
(This is the complete text of Dr.
Kay Lyman Wilbur's memorial
address delivered yesterday in the
Stanford Memorial Church).
Don Tresidder had three outstand
ing loyalties and loves Mary Tres
idder, Stanford University, and the
high hills. To them he gave a rare
warmth of devotion.
While he was Stanford's president
for hut little more than four years,
it was during a period of fierce ac
tivity and change. He had gotten by
the first and toughest years and

| .could see brighter daylight ahead.
The impact of this war and postwar
period compelled many new deci
sions as to policy and personnel.
Fortunately, he had been steeped
in Stanford ways and was filled
from youth on with the simplicity
and genuine character of David
Starr Jordan's conception of a uni
versity. '
LAST TRIP
Just before lie started on this last
eastern trip, Don came in to see me.
I had encouraged him to accept re
sponsibility for membership on a
small committee to re-develop the
Association of American Universi
ties. The Association had slackened
pace under the urge of war; hut it
could, as we saw it, represent the
universities in dealing wilh the pres
sures of the day and, by working
together, protect the future threat
ened by lack of income, govern
mental control of research, a dilu
tion of the quality of teaching, and
larger student bodies.
In that last talk we had together
1 pointed out to him the fallacy of
the old saw that the place of a uni
versity president all the year was
at home, doing routine administra
tion and perhaps discipline, On the
contrary, I told him, if he is to be
effective in holding and appointing
an adequate faculty in a university
of national and even world scope,
the university president must be a
traveler and a good auditor at na

tional meetings of various sorts.
Don Tresidder was a good talent
scout. He entered upon the search

a natural hunter. As a lover of his

close at hand—like treasure found
in one's own garden after a long
search for it elsewhex-e. He was a
Stanford man in our own Stanford
family. When the Trustees announc
ed his unanimous election as our
president, it seemed almost provi
dential.
LEAVES IMPRESS
In these few years Don Tresidder
has made an impress on Stanford
of far-reaching significance. Even
in our sorrow, we can view with
pride and satisfaction what he has
been able to do, and.mark a not
able progress. Don loved our serene
and beautiful campus while yet re
taining his great love for the high
hills of the Sierra.
There will be many more presi
dents of Stanford, but there will
never be another more capable of
enjoying our campus and our hills
and their reach out to all of Cali
fornia. What sweet and inspiring
memories he leaves with us all!
(This is the complete text of Dr.
Kay Lyman Wilbur's memorial
address delivered yesterday in the
Stanford Memorial Church).
Don Tresidder had three outstand
ing loyalties and loves Mary Tres
idder, Stanford University, and the
high hills. To them he gave a rare
warmth of devotion.
While he was Stanford's president
for hut little more than four years,
it was during a period of fierce ac
tivity and change. He had gotten by
the first and toughest years and

| .could see brighter daylight ahead.
The impact of this war and postwar
period compelled many new deci
sions as to policy and personnel.
Fortunately, he had been steeped
in Stanford ways and was filled
from youth on with the simplicity
and genuine character of David
Starr Jordan's conception of a uni
versity. '
LAST TRIP
Just before lie started on this last
eastern trip, Don came in to see me.
I had encouraged him to accept re
sponsibility for membership on a
small committee to re-develop the
Association of American Universi
ties. The Association had slackened
pace under the urge of war; hut it
could, as we saw it, represent the
universities in dealing wilh the pres
sures of the day and, by working
together, protect the future threat
ened by lack of income, govern
mental control of research, a dilu
tion of the quality of teaching, and
larger student bodies.
In that last talk we had together
1 pointed out to him the fallacy of
the old saw that the place of a uni
versity president all the year was
at home, doing routine administra
tion and perhaps discipline, On the
contrary, I told him, if he is to be
effective in holding and appointing
an adequate faculty in a university
of national and even world scope,
the university president must be a
traveler and a good auditor at na

tional meetings of various sorts.
Don Tresidder was a good talent
scout. He entered upon the search
tor men wilh the keen instincts of
a natural hunter. As a lover of his
fellow man he felt the loneliness of
being the head man, but knew that
he must provide the initiative for
new policies and new faculty mem
bers. At once, he sensed that upon
him rested' the unpleasant duty of
judging his l'cllowmen and of assay
ing their development and progress
and, above all, of being lair—par
ticularly to the University itself,
for he represented the faculty and
student interest. He It'll that the
endowed university wilh its free
doms filled a position in the life of
our America that was unique in the
world and of inestimable value. Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford's "Univers
ity of High Degree" became his
ideal, worthy of great sacrifice if
need be.
In the summer of 1941, after Dr.
Tresidder had become a Stanford
Trustee, I rode over from the Tuo
lumne Meadows via the Vogelsang
Pass trail to his camp on the Merced
liver. When he invited me to be his
guest I had his assurance of a long
enough sleeping bag and some good
fishing. I was planning to let the
reins go and retire from the Uni
versity presidency. In Ihe twenty
four hours we had together up there
along the headwaters of the Mer
ced, we had one of those penetrat
ing conversations in which we anal
yzed Stanford and put everything
through tin* wringer.
FORCE OF STANFORD
In those lovely surroundings an
idealistic Stanford held our full at
tention. Stanford seemed to us one
of the greatest forces in our coun
try and worthy of the best we could
give it. Between us we knew most
of the men and women of Stanford
since its earliest days. With growing
pride we named them over with
their achievements. We felt that the
president to be selected by the
Trustees as my successor must feel
the name urge as we did. There was
a search on for such a man through
a special committee on selection of
the president.
They searched far and near, and
it took some little time for us to find
that the rare man we sought was
close at hand—like treasure found
in one's own garden after a long
search for it elsewhex-e. He was a
Stanford man in our own Stanford
family. When the Trustees announc
