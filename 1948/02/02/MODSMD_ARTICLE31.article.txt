death blow to the caste system in
India. More than once he lasted to
better the conditions of the un
touchables. Whenever he went to
Indian cities, he lived in their
: homes.
He fought all his life for the
emancipation of women and advised
them to revolt against the tyranny
of men. As the result of his efforts,
women fought shoulder to shoulder
with men in the freedom struggle
and are taking an equal part in the
j rebuilding of the Indian nation.
The world had only one Gandhi

dead but he will continue to live in
the hearts of millions. His aims and

There, in South Africa, under the
j influence of Thoreau, Ruskin, and
Tolstoy, the young Gandhi devel
oped his technique of Satyagrah or
| non-violent non-co-operation. He
appeared on the Indian political
scene in 1919 and within a quarter
of a century led the Indian masses
to political freedom from the for
eign ruler.
| SELFLESS WORKER
Gandhi was famous for, many
. qualities. To the Indians, he was an
I example of a selfless public worker.
I Gandhi the politician was the most
! loved and respected individual to
j appear on the Indian scene for a
i long time. He himself agreed with
their conception of him as a politi
; cian; he once said, "Men say that I
am a saint losing himself in politics.
The fact is that 1 am a politician
I trying my hardest to become a
saint."
He believed in the principles of
i liberty and freedom and fought all
; his life against despotism and im
[ perialism. "Imperialism is the devil
1 of this age," he used to say. He it
was who gave the Indians back
their self - respect, who rekindled
the life-spark in them, and who
gave a new voice to the starving
millions of India.
At his bidding hundreds of thou
sands of men and women courted
j arrest and faced the batons and
j bullets of the British government,
j Thrice he guided passive resistance
i campaigns, in 1921, 1931, and 1942.
RELIGIOUS LEADER
Like most of the other political
leaders in India, Gandhi has spent
most of his life in jail. His latest
jail-sojourn lasted three years and
was instrumental in the death of his
wife, Kasturba.
Outside India, Gandhi is known
as a religious and spiritual leader.
In India he was never regarded as
such. His claim to religious leader
ship is based only on the fact that
he regarded religions as equally
good.
Gandhi above all was a revolu
tionary. All his life he .fought
j against oppression and exploitation
—exploitation by the higher classes
of the loweij classes, exploitation of
j man by man, and exploitation of
j woman by man.
Though he regarded most of (he
' ills of the modern world as there
; suit of a machine age, he was the
best friend of the poor and the
underdog. He believed > n giving all
power to the peasants and the la-
I borers. He was against the machines
because they create unemployment,
hunger, and concentration of power.
SOCIAL REFORMER

status of untouchables and gave a
