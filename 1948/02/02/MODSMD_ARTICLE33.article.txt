Mr. Gandhi was the man who first
gave our people a feeling of unity,
self-respect, and dignity. Through
his life time he sought to divert na
tional enthusiasm into constructive
channels. He fought not only for the
independence of India but for the
betterment of his people. He sought
to remove the age-old prejudices
and gave impetus to the develop
ment of rural industries. All this he
achieved by non-violent means and
without shedding a single drop of
the blood of his people. The result
of his endeavors was a free and dem
ocratic India. When independence
came and troubles sorely beset the
new state, once again he came to
the rescue and by his non-violent
methods saved the country from
disaster.
The tragic death of Mahatmah
Gandhi at this critical juncture re
moves from our midst a great man
whose absence will be keenly felt.
His last words were a plea of mercy
for the dastardly assassin. In his
death, not only India but the en
tire world has lost a great soul. Let
us hope that the shock of his tragic
death will awaken the peoples of
India and Pakistan to the realities
of the situation and follow the noble
principles of love, peace, and broth
erhood for which he lived and died.
