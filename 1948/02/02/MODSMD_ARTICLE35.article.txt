## 
### 
JERUSALEM, Monday, Feb. 2 |
(UP). —An explosion believed to!
have been caused by an Arab bar- j
rel bomb destroyed the five-story !
building of the Palestine Post and
an adjoining structure in the heart
of downtown Jerusalem last night. J
Flames from both buildings raged .
fiercely still in the early hours of 1
this morning. Police estimated dam
age to the Post building at mor;e .
than $600,0.00.
I'OST BUILDING
The Post building, which housed i
the offices of the Palestine censor, I
the bureau of the United Press, and 1
the Jerusalem offices of several
newspapers, was set afire by a blast i
so powerful that it wrecked two ■
ambulances at the Jewish Hadassah j
clinic nearby.
Presumably by coincidence, a few
hours earlier the Arab newspaper As j
Haab had announced it was ceasing
publication. The newspaper's li
cense had been suspended tempo
rarily by Palestine authorities for
publishing a seven-column account
of Arab guerrilla infiltrations into j
Palestine. Censors demanded that a |
seven-column denial of the story
be published. The editors refused.
TWENTY INJURED
It was feared at first that several
persons had been buried in the de
bris of the Palestine Post building,
but police said that casualties were
confined to injuries to about 20 per
sons, one serious. There was an
unconfirmed report that a woman in
the adjoining building was killed.
If it is confirmed that Arabs were
responsible, it will be the first time
since the liberation o!' Palestine I
from the Turks that they have !
blown up any building in the ccntcr |
of a town.
SECOND BOMIJ
Pasting by some means through !
British police and Jewish Haganah
patrols, a truck carrying the bomb
passed along the Jaffa road into the
heart of the city, and 100 yards from
police headquarters.
The Post building, which housed ,
the United Press Jerusalem bureau,
and the adjoining building were
practically wrecked.
Before the explosion at the Post
building there was another in the
old city, apparently caused also by
an Arab bomb. This explosion was
followed by automatic arms (ire. ei- j
ther between British troops and
Arabs or between Arabs and Jews. !

JERUSALEM, Monday, Feb. 2 |
(UP). —An explosion believed to!
have been caused by an Arab bar- j
rel bomb destroyed the five-story !
building of the Palestine Post and
an adjoining structure in the heart
of downtown Jerusalem last night. J
Flames from both buildings raged .
fiercely still in the early hours of 1
this morning. Police estimated dam
age to the Post building at mor;e .
than $600,0.00.
I'OST BUILDING
The Post building, which housed i
the offices of the Palestine censor, I
the bureau of the United Press, and 1
the Jerusalem offices of several
newspapers, was set afire by a blast i
so powerful that it wrecked two ■
ambulances at the Jewish Hadassah j
clinic nearby.
Presumably by coincidence, a few
hours earlier the Arab newspaper As j
Haab had announced it was ceasing
publication. The newspaper's li
cense had been suspended tempo
rarily by Palestine authorities for
publishing a seven-column account
of Arab guerrilla infiltrations into j
Palestine. Censors demanded that a |
seven-column denial of the story
be published. The editors refused.
TWENTY INJURED
It was feared at first that several
persons had been buried in the de
bris of the Palestine Post building,
but police said that casualties were
confined to injuries to about 20 per
sons, one serious. There was an
unconfirmed report that a woman in
the adjoining building was killed.
If it is confirmed that Arabs were
responsible, it will be the first time
since the liberation o!' Palestine I
from the Turks that they have !
blown up any building in the ccntcr |
of a town.
SECOND BOMIJ
Pasting by some means through !
British police and Jewish Haganah
patrols, a truck carrying the bomb
passed along the Jaffa road into the
heart of the city, and 100 yards from
police headquarters.
The Post building, which housed ,
the United Press Jerusalem bureau,
and the adjoining building were
practically wrecked.
Before the explosion at the Post
building there was another in the
old city, apparently caused also by
an Arab bomb. This explosion was
followed by automatic arms (ire. ei- j
ther between British troops and
Arabs or between Arabs and Jews. !
