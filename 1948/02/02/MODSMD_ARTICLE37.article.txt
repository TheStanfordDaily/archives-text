# COP, USF Fives Bow to Indian Varsity; Freshman Crew Scuttles Piedmont High
## 
### BILL ALLEN JOHN HERBOLD 
Victors over College of the Pacific and University of San Fran
cisco in their weekend's play, Stanford's cagers will come up
against what may be their toughest competition of the year when
they take on Bradley University here tomorrow night.
Bradley, with a record of 20 wins and one loss, is rated as

the best team in the Middle West
and one of the three or four top
clubs in the nation. The Peorians
have an average of better than 70
points a game.
Although weakened by the ab
sence of center Steve Stephenson.
Stanford played some good ball in
heating USF, <10 to 42, Saturday
night; and COP, 45 to 43, Friday
night.
Filling in for Stephenson, who ha.'
suffered a relapse and may not be
available tomorrow night, were bij.
Bob Penn and Ralph Carver. In the
words of Coach Everett Dean, "they
did a great job."
PENN LEADS SCORERS
Especially was this the case Sat
urday night when the two sub cen
ters scored IB points between them.
Penn tallied 11 to lead the scoring
column, and Carver's eight points
all came in the first 10 minutes of
the second half when nobody else
could hit.
Against COP, forward Bill Rose
led the scorers with 13 points, and
Captain Babe Higgins came through
with live field goals when they were
most needed.
The Tigers from Stockton, using
only seven players, had a scrappy,
heads-up ball club. Trailing by 11
points with nine minutes to play,
they were put back in the game
with three quick (ie!d goals by cen
ter Phil Ortez.
DAVE AND BABE CLINCH WIN
The Indians withstood the rally,
as baskets by Dave Davidson and
Higgins clinched the victory.
On Saturday night Stanford led
throughout by margins of anywhere
from three to 10 points. USF's points
came in flurries, as one after an
other of the Dons would suddenly
get hot and as quickly cool off.
Diminutive guard Rene Herrerias
led the San Franciscans' last-quar
ter rally, which brought them to
within four points of Stanford, with
three 35-foot one-handers.
The game was dominated by of
ficials Lloyd Leith and Wally Cam
eron, who called 41 fouls, 22 on the
Dons and 19 on the Indians.
Davidson and Penn both fouled
out with three minutes to play. USF
guard Ross Giudice had 13 tries
from the free throw line, of which
he made only five.
WRONG-WAY CORRIGAN
Stanford almost got an extra two
points early in the second half when
Don guard Frank Kuzara pulled a
Roy Riegels by ch;ibbling madly
down the court toward the Stanford
basket. lie was stopped just in time
by worried teammates.
This USF team is the only oppo
nent which Stanford has in common
with Bradley. The Dons held Brad
ley to its lowest score of the year
in losing 50 to 43.
The victories were ■ Stanford's
tenth and eleventh of the season.
The team has lost five, four of them
conference games.
Since Jan. 2, the club has never

been at full strength. Every mem
ber of the first team has been hit by
flu or injuries.
The lineup has had to be revised
week, But despite this lack
of continuity the team has never
alien apart. Stanford has beaten
good teams, and when it lost it was
by close scores.
Stanford's defense, which has held
■nost opponents below 50 points, will
:>et a real test against the high
scoring Bradleyites. Twice the
Middle Westerners have scored 90
points in a game.

Stanford's frosh cagers were
really "hoopin' it up" when they
returned to the hardwoods af
ter their two-week lay-off period
to crush the visiting Piedmont
High five, 41 to 28, in the Saturday
night preliminary encounter.
Although the locals were leading,
.'54 to 16, at the end of the third
quarter and could have had twice
that amount it the first string had
remained in the contest throughout
the first half, Freshman Coach Jack
Dana didn't seem to take mercy on
his old "alma mater" until the clos
ing minutes. The entrance of the
Stanford third - stringers onto the
court at that time livened up the
game, and the invaders, led by Nie
man at forward, made a vain but
gallant effort to close the gap.
MEM AN TOPS SCORERS
In spite of the fact that the boys
wearing the purple and white were
badly outclassed, the high scoring
lienors went to their ace forward,
Nieman, who bucketed 15 markers.
Ten Stanford casabans registered
points in the score book as com
pared to five for the visitors, and
runner-up honors for the night
went to Cardinal forward Paul
Watson with 10 digits. Marv Gel
ber's four two - handed field goals
gave the freshmen an additional
eight points.
Almost before the echo of the
opening buzzer had faded out of
Ihe Pavilion, the freshmen had five
quick tallies, and after the first five
minutes losers never were able
to close the gap to less than eight
points. At one point in the contest,
Stanford led by 18 points.
OFFENSE SHARPENED
On the whole, Stanford's offense
showed that the period of inac
tivity had given them a chance to
sharpen their attack, although their
season-long weakness at the free
throw line continued. Of 15 token
tosses, only five reached the score
board via the hoop.
Offensively, the Stanfordites were
lax at times about rebounding and
following their long shots, but their
excellent floor game gave them a
decided edge.
The shifting - zone defense used
by the frosh squad seemed to com
pletely bewilder the comparatively
inexperienced and shorter Pied
monters.
Prominent floor men for the fresh
men were Fran Watson and Marv
Gclber, while Hal Campcn, a boy
who hasn't played much this year,
turned in an excellent evening both
on offense and defensively.


Frosh forward PAUL WATSON
led the Stanford scoring with 10
points as the freshman casaba
squad overwhelmed Piedmont
High School. 41 to 28. in the pre
liminary game Saturday night.
