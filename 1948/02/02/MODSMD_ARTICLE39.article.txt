### 
The Petaluma American Legion
defeated the Stanford ruggers, 7 to
0, in a sloppily played contest Sat
urday afternoon on the intramural i
field.
The Indians dominated the offen
sive play throughout the first half,
but lacked the final drive needed to
push across for a try.
In the early stages of the game a
passing rush carried the Cards to j
within a few yards of the goal, but !
on the ensuing scrum a Stanford r
forward touched the ball and Peta
luma was awarded a free kick.
A few minutes later a long run
by A 1 Turriziani almost produced a
tally, but the Legionnaires recov
ered the ball from the scrum and
kicked it out.
However, in the second half the j
Petalumans started to roll.
The fireworks began when Bill
Peck's attempted drop kick fell
short; Jack Reynolds picked up the
free ball and kicked it out to Peck
who passed to Harry Skoog who
went over for the try. The con
version attempt was unsuccessful, j
Shortly thereafter Bill Peck added |
four more points with a drop kick J
goal.
Dick Hughes, one of the fastest
backs on the team, suffered a bro- |
ken collarbone in the second half ]
and will be out for the rest of the
season.
In the preliminary game the .
Stanford reserves downed the Men- 1
lo Ramblers 8 to G.
