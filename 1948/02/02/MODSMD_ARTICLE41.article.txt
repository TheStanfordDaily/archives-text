ter a terrific weekend assault which
knocked the Univesity of Washing

Showing the same championship

last season, the Beavers stomped on
Washington to the tune of 71 to 63
Friday night to climb into the driv

Then, to satisfy the die-hards,
they repeated the performance last
| night with an unmerciful 74 to 55
j shellacking which jammed the Hus

Second spot in the northern di
j vision standings was taken over last
| night by the Washington State Cou
! gars, who squeezed past the Idaho
I Vandals 41-40 in the only other
I conference game of the weekend.
