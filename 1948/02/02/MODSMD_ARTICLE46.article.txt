# Wylie at Rugby Helm Since '17
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Once again rugby season is in lull
swing, and the mention of rugby al
ways brings to mind the name of
Jim Wylie.
It was in 1917 that, Jim first served
as Stanford rugby coach, but his
connection with the game dates
back to his early boyhood days in
New Zealand, his birthplace. Dur
ing the course of his colorful career
he has played with numerous inter
national all-star fifteens, and while
in college distinguished himself ts
of the finest ruggers Stanford
has ever produced.
FIRST EXPERIENCE
In 1911, at the age of 18, young
Wylie had his first experience with
big-time rugby when lie played for
New Zealand against the Pacific
Coast All-Stars from this country.
In 1912 he went on tour with the
Australian Waratah, and the fol

lowing year was a member of
the New Zealand All - Blacks, the
world's rugby champions of that
year. This particular aggregation
was probably one of the finest rugby
teams ever assembled. Big Jim had
the distinction of being the only
rugger ever to represent New Zea
land and Australia in consecutive
years.
In 1914 Wylie came to Stanford to
begin an association with the school
which was destined to last for many
years. Rugby had replaced Ameri
can football here on the coast in
1906, and most of the Western col
leges including Stanford were still
playing the English game.
241 WINS, NO LOSSES
Wylie paced the Indian rugby
teams of 1914 and 1915. Over the
two-year peiod Stanford had the
amazing record of 20 victories, no
defeats, and one tie. The Quad had
this to say concerning the 1914 Big
Game: "Jim Wylie in breakaway
position smothered play after play
of the opposition and was the par
ticular star of the fighting forward
division."
At the conclusion of the 1914 sea
son. Jim was honored by being se
lected to play with the British rug

tiers in an all-star game between
English and American rugby teams.
JIM ISKCOMhS FAK.M COACH
In 1917 VVylie served as head
rugby coach here on the Farm, and
in hi.s first season produced an un
defeated team, ile had never tu
tored a college team before, but his
thorough knowledge of the game
qualified him as a first-rate mentor.
The following comment appeared in
the Quad ol that year: "Coach Jim
Wy'ie made himself in one year of
football at Stanford; he justified his
selection as coach in the fifteen ho
turned out in li) 17."
Two years later Stanford returned
to American football, and rugby
was maintained as a minor sport.
Jim, after serving in the Royal Air
Force during the war. returned as
coach, a position which he has re
tained ever since.
As far as the present rugby situ
ation is concerned, Wylie was ex
tremely pleased by the large num
ber who turned out for the team
this season.
"It's the largest turnout we've had
in years and certainly indicates an
increased interest in the game,"
commented Jim.

"It's the largest turnout we've had
in years and certainly indicates an
increased interest in the game,"
commented Jim.
Once again rugby season is in lull
swing, and the mention of rugby al
ways brings to mind the name of
Jim Wylie.
It was in 1917 that, Jim first served
as Stanford rugby coach, but his
connection with the game dates
back to his early boyhood days in
New Zealand, his birthplace. Dur
ing the course of his colorful career
he has played with numerous inter
national all-star fifteens, and while
in college distinguished himself ts
of the finest ruggers Stanford
has ever produced.
FIRST EXPERIENCE
In 1911, at the age of 18, young
Wylie had his first experience with
big-time rugby when lie played for
New Zealand against the Pacific
Coast All-Stars from this country.
In 1912 he went on tour with the
Australian Waratah, and the fol

lowing year was a member of
the New Zealand All - Blacks, the
world's rugby champions of that
year. This particular aggregation
was probably one of the finest rugby
teams ever assembled. Big Jim had
the distinction of being the only
rugger ever to represent New Zea
land and Australia in consecutive
years.
In 1914 Wylie came to Stanford to
begin an association with the school
which was destined to last for many
years. Rugby had replaced Ameri
can football here on the coast in
1906, and most of the Western col
leges including Stanford were still
playing the English game.
241 WINS, NO LOSSES
Wylie paced the Indian rugby
teams of 1914 and 1915. Over the
two-year peiod Stanford had the
amazing record of 20 victories, no
defeats, and one tie. The Quad had
this to say concerning the 1914 Big
Game: "Jim Wylie in breakaway
position smothered play after play
of the opposition and was the par
ticular star of the fighting forward
division."
At the conclusion of the 1914 sea
son. Jim was honored by being se
lected to play with the British rug

tiers in an all-star game between
English and American rugby teams.
JIM ISKCOMhS FAK.M COACH
In 1917 VVylie served as head
rugby coach here on the Farm, and
in hi.s first season produced an un
defeated team, ile had never tu
tored a college team before, but his
thorough knowledge of the game
qualified him as a first-rate mentor.
The following comment appeared in
the Quad ol that year: "Coach Jim
Wy'ie made himself in one year of
football at Stanford; he justified his
selection as coach in the fifteen ho
turned out in li) 17."
Two years later Stanford returned
to American football, and rugby
was maintained as a minor sport.
Jim, after serving in the Royal Air
Force during the war. returned as
coach, a position which he has re
tained ever since.
As far as the present rugby situ
ation is concerned, Wylie was ex
tremely pleased by the large num
ber who turned out for the team
this season.
