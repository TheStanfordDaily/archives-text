NEY YORK, Feb. 1 (UP)— The
basketball season moved into its
climactic month today without a
hint of who'll hold the conference
championships in any except three
leagues.
Texas seemed a shoo-in cinch in
the Southwest, Columbia had the
Ivc league in tow. and Kansas State
appeared Unbeatable in the Big Six.
But elsewhere it was anybody's
race. In some cases, four and live
teams were listed as serious con
tenders.
The Southern conference might
be able to break its deadlock be
tween North Carolina and North
Carolina State when the two teams
meet Wednesday night. North Caro
lina holds a 15 and 1 record. State
lost to West Virginia and Holy Cross
while winning 18.
