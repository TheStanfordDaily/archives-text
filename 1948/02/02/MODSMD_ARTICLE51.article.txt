# Excom, SAC Co-operation
## 
### 
At last Wednesday's Excom meeting S2OO
was voted to the Crew Association in order
that it could purchase a launch.
The launch is a necessity if the Stanford
crew is to compete with other schools on any
thing resembling egual terms. Excom, impress
ed with the spirit and drive of the crew mem
bers, voted almost unanimously in favor of
the grant.
But the ASSU funds will not suffice for long
if the student government must help "orphan"
athletic teams including crew, rugby, and soc
cer.
Admittedly, the Stanford Athletic Council
has looked thoroughly into the crew guestion
and decided that at this time it would be too
expensive an undertaking.
Since then the crew members have worked
hard organizing themselves, putting up money
of their own, and soliciting eguipment.
They are now in a position where they be
lieve S2OO will take care of their major needs
for tliis year. This would not make crew a
recognized sport. It would just give them the
little help that they need so badly.
But why should that money come from the

ASSU instead of the athletic department?
Why shouldn't Excom contact the Stanford
Athletic Council? Tell the council that they
have studied the crew problem and think that
the Association deserves this money. Ask the
council to consider the crew reguest.
After all, the Stanford Athletic Council exists
because of the student body, not vice versa.
Excom shouldn't direct the SAC, but if several
times during the year there are reguests which
it has to make it should not hesitate to notify
the SAC.
The SAC on the other hand should be more
than eager to gain the good will of the student
body. If this means granting a few minor re
guests that Excom may make during the year,
the good will comes at a cheap price.
This is a normal way of doing business.
The Stanford Athletic Council should al
ways be allowed to determine the Stanford
athletic policy. But on minor points such as
the purchase of a launch for the crew it should j
listen to Excom suggestions.
A lack of proper liaison between student
government and the athletic department aids
neither.
