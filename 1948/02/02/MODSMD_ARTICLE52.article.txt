I have a bone to pick—a slice off the skeleton of
this thing we love to call civilization.
That awful, unintelligible jargon is invading the
campus—the STANFORD campus, no less. I noticed
it a couple of months ago when I saw a painter pains
takingly renewing the word W-O-L-S on the asphalt
in front of the chemistry building. It's bothered me
ever since.
What in the world does WOLS mean? Golly, I
can't find it in a single dictionary, English, German,
Latvian. But you can find it near a lot of intersec
tions and sometimes in close proximity to things
they call GNIX DEP's (whatever they are), just as
bold and confusing as you please, right out there on
the highway. Sometimes it precedes by a couple of
hundred feet the vertically extended and perfectly
good ('though rather lonely-looking) word, POTS.
Or WOLS LOOHCS. Maybe wols is an adverb,
like awful or some profs I've had. But. what's a loohc?
Then there's NOITUAC and 52 TIMIL DEEPS or,

sometimes, 53 TIMIL DEEPS. And 42 Creme Sham
poo, too! There could be a hundred of them for all
of me: ten would be enough. I saw a driver almost
run down a blind man and his grandmother the
other morning trying to noituac or timil deep (just
once), I don't know which.
If it's advertising, it's exactly where it should be
—where you don't notice it once you get used to it.
Subsidize the highways! It's a darned good idea. But
whose pots? WOLS LOOHCS sounds too much like
LSMFT, and it took fourteen Hit Parades before this
C-A-M-E-L smoker was let in on the secret that
the ingredients of his cigaret couldn't possibly be as
good as Luckies.2 W-O-L-S has had me on pins and
needles for years.
The Serutan people are a lot fairer. They'll tell
you right out that Serutan is nothing more than
Natures spelled backw . . .
Oh, NO!
. . . say! It's fun, once you catch on, t'nsi ti?
