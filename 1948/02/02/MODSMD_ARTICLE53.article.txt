### ALLEN BLETZ 
Republican majority leader Halleck is definitely
overlooking something. He says, "Our system of free
economy will work its way out of the present situation
as it always has." What he overlooks is that a great
majority of people, some of them Republicans, don't
want our .system of free economy to work itself out
of the present situation as it always has. They want it
to work itself out a great deal better —less painfully
and more conclusively.
The way our system of free economy worked itself
out of the situation that followed the crash of 1929
was that millions of Americans lost their homes, their
jobs, and their hopes. They stood haggard in bread
lines. They peddled apples; they begged; and they
look charity.
After ;.l! the suffering and degradation, our system
of free economy didn't work itself out even then. It

showed no signs that it would ever work itself out.
It had to be supported and directed and controlled;
and at that, it was still sick and groggy when the war
emergency came along and made it possible to operate
profitably and at full employment in spite of funda
mental ills.
"Our economy" is a phrase tossed around quite
loosely by our Congressmen, especially around election
time. Much is said in both Houses on this subject,
but very seldom can any of these "outstanding"
speeches hold any water. They are always punctured
by facts and the bitter truth.
What I would like to hear the Republican Majority
leader saV is that these fundamental ills must be
corrected promptly, so that our system of free economy
will not work us into one hell of a fix again as it
has before, and as it cannot afford to continue to do.
