lUtlshc ri/•" Tactics

To the Editor:
Mr. Carr, British Laborite promoter of Bolshevism,
who was well advertised in the Daily and even given
great prominence by one institution on the Campus,
said in his lecture in the Memorial Hall and in some
.seminars that the Soviet policy is "purely defensive."
"Capitalist encirclement" is given as a reason for
the Soviet attack on Finland in 1939 and for the Soviet
occupation of die Baltic states in 1940. Poland was
occupied and bolshevized for the same reason. The
sovietized and militarized Balkan states should "de
fend" Soviet Russia against the "capitalist encircle
ment." The recently published secret Nazi documents,
says Mr. Carr, show nothing but Soviet Russia's deal
with the Nazis to partition the British Empire and the
world for "security reasons."
But did not Hitler commit the greatest crime of
history against peace and humanity for the same
"reasons?" Did he not proclaim to the world that he
was going to attack Poland, invade Norway, and oc
cupy Belgium, Holland and the Balkans because of
the "Plutocrat encirclement" of the Nazi Germany?
If dictator Hitler's policy was brutal aggression, why
should the aggression fulfilled perhaps with more
.•killed brutality by dictator Stalin for the same "rea
sons' be accepted as "purely defensive?" If Hitler's
agents were not permitted to preach this "reason" why
should Western Civilization accept this "truth"from
the lips of a British Stalin associate?
Mr. Can's preaching climaxed with a definition of
Hitler's famous "Lebensraum" (living space) as it is
being professed by the Reds. Soviet Russia did not
occupy any country or territory, said Mr. Carr, "she
just stepped into the ideological vacuum (!)." And
he says Soviet Russia's "stepping in" in France and
Italy, is "ideological vacuum." This is the most cruel
Bolshevik insult of civilized nations ever heard in his
tory! Did not most of the nations occupied today by
the Bolshevik armies shed blood against the Nazis?
Do not these nations have their own character,
national pride, great past and civilization? Do they
not want to be independent and free? Do they not
crave for collaboration as equal and free nations for
prospei ity and peace of mankind? Were these socially
well organized states, today under Bolshevik slavery,
vacuums before the Red army stepped into their terri
tories? Did hundreds of thousands of brave Allied sol

diers die for liberation of these countries from the
Nazi slavery to make them vacuums for the Bolsheviks
to step in?
The other Mr. Carr "truth" was that Stalin is no
more interested in spreading communism over the
world than the Western Democracies are interested in
seeing democracy gain ground. Of course, it is Mr.
Cair's personal affair to get clear with the great Bol
shevik leader for this debasement of his doctrine to
which Stalin devoted his adventurous revolutionary
life and which he has been preaching as "the liberation
of world proletariat from the capitalist slavery." Un
fortunately the civilized world knows too well about
the philosophy of Karl Marx and about voluminous
revolutionary works of Lenin, Stalin. Trotzky, Zdanow
and other prominent Bolsheviks to agree with Mr.
Can's "dilettante truth." Every school boy knows
that communism is a domestic totalitarian and violent
ideology seeking "to liberate mankind from capitalist
slavery" —a millitant philosophy based on the Third
International and backed by Soviet Russia, advertised
by the Bolshevik leaders as the "arsenal of the prole
tariat world revolution."
The documentary evidence proves that the Soviets
are determined to establish a communist puppet gov
ernment in the whole of Germany. They block food
shipments from Eastern Germany, the German bread
basket, into industrial Western Germany in order to
force the Germans, impelled by starvation and social
disorders, to accept Bolshevik rule. Yet Mr. Carr
labels the American help to prevent starvation of
German workers "interference with the Soviet occu
pation zone!" Only cessation of American help, says
Mr. Carr, could win Soviet Russian collaboration in
Germany.
The Western powers, concludes' Mr. Carr, should
abandon Europe if they want to establish good rela
tions with the Soviet Russia. Finally, he warns that
Western capitalism should cease to oppose communism
unless it wants to be destroyed by the latter.
Mr. Cart's preaching on the Campus proves once
again how treacherous are Bolshevik tactics. The
Western Democracies, being strongly armed not only
physically but also spiritually, were able to save
Western Civilization from the destruction by the not
less treacherous Nazi ideologies and tactics. Let us
th erefore, be vigilant and keep our minds well armed
to meet hucce.s.si ully any new treacherous aggression.
VICTOR KAUPAS.
