# Indian Sikh Finds Farm Interesting and Friendly

"The Village is so fijiendly that I
feel as if I had been here for years,"
commented Rajendra Vikruni Singh,
a newly enrolled Indian student.
The practice of hitch-hiking be
tween the Village and the campus
still bewilders him. "Each time 1
get into a different car, but in every
case I find everybody very friendly.
Yes, Stanford is a fine place," he
beamed.
The Unbailed student arrived
here early in January after a two
month voyage fom Calcutta. The
lemon-colored turban, he explained,
'.s worn, by all Sikhs. It dates from
the late 17th century, when the
Sikhs formed a militant sacred dy
nasty to thwart forced conversion
and persecution by the Moslems.
The turban and unshorn hair be
came the military markings of the
guerrilla-like organization. "But our
uniform is not as gaudy as some,"
he added.
Vikrum Singh has found little
difficulty in acclimating himself at
Stanford. He was born and reared
in a valley situated in the foothills
of the Himalayas where the climate
is very much like that of California.
The foreign student first attended
the Doon School at Behradun, India.
The school, patterned after the Eng
lish public school, utilized English
as the common language because of
language conflicts.
The 18-year r ol(l student later en
tered the University of Punjab at
Lahore. He recalled that he was
appearing at the university for his
Bachelor of Science examinations
when rioting between Hindu and
Moslem factions broke out in the
street fronting the university.
A procession of Hindu students,
shouting "Down with Pakistan,"
clashed with Moslem police. This
riot of March 4, 1947. he said, was
the forerunner of the bloody mas
sacres that spread over both Pakis
tan and India in the summer and
fall of last year.
"Many people do not realize that
the number of people against divi
sion was great," he related. Parti
tioning has weakened both coun
tries, he said. "Gandhi could have
brought peace to both Moslems and
Hindus. The people worshiped him,"
he added.
The student expressed confidence
that India will become a great, pow
erful nation. Many slow adjust
ments between India and Pakistan
will be necessary.
Vikum Singh said he was amazed
to find that a former classmate from
the Doon School, Vendata Ramana
Rao, is a fellow Villager. The softly
spoken engineering undergraduate
is particularly interested in micro
waves and atomic physics.
