# Many Traffic Rules Broken By Stanford Studentsâ€”Davis
## 
### 
Chief of Police Gordon Davis ret
ports that there has been a large i
number of parking and other traf- '
fic violations on campus recently, j
Many of these were committed, he !
said, by students wno were late to ;
class parking in restricted areas.
Parking in areas where the curb
is painted white is prohibited, j
These are for passenger discharging
only, Davis said, and the driver
must stay in the automobile. These
areas are to be found in front of
many buildings on campus. Park- j
ing on yellow - painted curbing is
also prohibited, he said, as they are
for commercial use only. These J
areas are in two places on campus
at the kitchen entrance to the Un
ion Cellar, and opposite the Post Of
fice near the Women's Clubhouse.
Because of the large rush of traf
fic on campus this quarter, Davis j
suggests that students living on ;
campus walk to classes instead of j
using their automobiles. In the case j
of men living in fraternity houses

a considerable distance from the
Quad, he recommends that they
form car-pools, so as to cut down on
the number of cars being used.
Parking in all alleys is prohib
ited, Davis said. There have been
numerous violations in the alley be
hind the Bookstore, and in alleys
running between houses, sometimes
blocking garages. Right of way must
be maintained at all times, he .said.
