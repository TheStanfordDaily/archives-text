# Munk Favors U.S.; Bletz, World Gov't
## 
### 
The second round in the battle of
the United Nations at the Women's
Clubhouse last night saw a small
but spirited group, led by Allan
Bletz and A! Munk, agree that the
UN was failing in its set purpose
but disagree upon whom to place
the most blame.
While Bletz led a faction which
felt that blame for the UN failure
belonged to the United States for
refusing to take the initial step in
disarming, Munk and a smaller
group held that Russia was to blame
for lack of world co-operation.
