# Naval School Writes Island Booklet Series
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Cached away in a corner of the
Hoover Libe opposite the main
reading room, a small group of
technologists is making current his
torv in the form of seven small
handbooks.
few Stanfordites are aware of the
"School of Naval Administration"
and its activities right here in our
midst.
At the present time the school,
headed by Dr. Harold H. Fisher-,
diiector of the Hoover Institute, is
in the throes of collecting, synthe
sizing, and rewriting a wealth ol
fascinating facts for a new seven*-
boukli t series on the Mariana, Mar
• ball, and Caroline Islands.

"Under the UN agreement that,
the U.S. shall have complete trus
tee- hip over these recently Jup-in
lestt <1 islands," said Commander R.
L Rainey, senior instructor of the
c.hool, "the Navy has been dele
gated by Congress to carry out the
trusteeship policy by sending well
orientated officers to the territories
to act as government 'overseers'
i here.
"Stanford has become the center
of the instruction program for these
men 11 ere, in the past year and u
half, we have instructed over 200 of
ficers in the facts and figures con
cerning these islands. At the pres
. nl time we are engaged in Writing
these all-inclusive booklets winch
will act as guides not only for the
attached naval personnel, but also
for anyone else interested in the
island group."
SCHOOL SUBDIVIDED
The school has subdivided the
three island chains into six sectors, j
F.avh sector will be the subject of a
booklet, and the entire group taken
together will be described in the
• eventh. The island of Guam, situ
ated among the trustee group and
long a U.S. possession, acts as the
: "capital" of the islands.
Commander Ramey made it, clear
that the U.S. does not own these is
lands. He stated: "The only way a
nation, according to international
law, can take possession of a terri
tory is either for it. to buy the ter
ritory or to negotiate a treaty for
it with its rightful owner.
"We have never bought the Mar
halls, Carolines, or Marianas. Their
last legal owner was Germany,
which bought them from Spain in
1898 for the sum of 1 1•» million
marks,
TRUSTEESHIP
"Then with the end of World War
I, the 2,000-odd islands in the three
groups were mandated to the Jap
anese by the League of Nations;
and now, by much the same type of
enactment, by the UN, have been
• iven over to us as a trusteeship."
Chief technologist and compiler of
the literary material for the hand
books is the noted Stanford anthro
pologist and top authority on the
inlands. Francis Keesing, professor of
anthropology.

SCHOOL SUBDIVIDED
The school has subdivided the
three island chains into six sectors, j
F.avh sector will be the subject of a
booklet, and the entire group taken
together will be described in the

nation, according to international
law, can take possession of a terri
tory is either for it. to buy the ter

it with its rightful owner.
