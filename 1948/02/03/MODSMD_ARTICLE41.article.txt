# Bradley Tech Quintet Meets Indians Tonight
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Is the tortoise faster than the hare?
That age-old question will assume a new form tonight at 8, when the Braves of Bradley Univer
sity invade the Pavilion for an intersectional basketball contest with the Stanford varsity.
Bradley, currently rated as the number one team in the Midv/est and fifth in the nation by the
Associated Press, employs a loose, fast-breaking style of offensive play that has enabled them

to run up the amazing average of
70.4 points per game in the 21 con
tests they have played thus far this
season.
.Stanford, on the other hand, owes
much of its success to a slow, de
liberate, play-making offense, coup
led with a very effective sliding
zone defense. Whether Everett
Dean's eagers can slow the Bradley
team down to their own pace re
mains to he seen.
BRADLEY TOPS ELI 91 TO 56
Twice this year, the Braves have
hit the i)l—point mark- once against
Arizona (91 to 66), and once against
Yale (91 to 56), while they have
been well over the 70 figure in
nearly half their games.
Their only defeat in 21 starts
came at the hands of an obscure,
giant-killing South Dakota U. team
(51 to 54). Bradley played five
games that week, and won the other
four. Numbered among their vic
tims are such teams as Texas Chris
tian, Harvard, USF, Princeton, and
Denver.
The Bradley attack is led by lan
ky center Paul Unruh, and by a
s—ft. 8-in. forward sensation named
Gene Melchiorre.
Urnuh, a G-ft. 4-in. sophomore, is
the team's leading scorer with
slightly .over a Hi-point per game
average, although Melchiorre isn't
far behind. Last year, Unruh set a
single season school scoring record
with 383 points.
Melchiorre is in his first year of
college competition, but played for
two years for Fort Sheridan, where
lie was the nation's seventh leading
scorer in 1946.
Playing with Melchiorre on the
Fort Sheridan five was forward Bill
Maim. Also a freshman, Mann I
stands (5 ft. 1 in., is a good rebound
artist and an outstanding floor man.
BRAVES lIIT 40 PER CENT
Melchiorre, Mann, and Unruh all
have shooting percentages of over j
40 per cent. Mann stands fourth in
the country in this respect with 43.1
per cent, while Melchiorre ranks j
fifth.
For a team that concentrates on ;
offense as much as it does, Bradley i
is no slouch on defense either.
Defensive star of the game is I
guard Dave Humerickhouse, who
was placed on the defensive All- :
American team last season.
Largely through the efforts of j
Humerickhouse and the other start- j
ing guard, George Chianakas, the
Bradley team has been able to hold
its oppontnts to a 46.15 game aver
age.
Bradley won its first six games
in three nights, by playing two
teams each night. This particular
feat might indicate that the Brave
reserves are top flight also.
STEVE MAY START
Indian chances for stopping the
Peoria Express rest largely on the
status of starting center Bill Ste- j
nhenson. Steve has been confined

to the Rest Home with an attack of
the flu, and it is not yet known it
he will be able to play.
It' Stephenson is not able to play,
his place will be taken by either
Bob Penn or Ralph Carver. Both
of these boys turned in a good per
formance against USF last Friday
night.
Captain Babe Higgins will start at
one forward spot for Stanford,
while either Bill Rose or Morley
Thompson will open at the other.
Dave Davidson and Bob Lewis will
start at guard.
The Bradley team arrived in San
Francisco yesterday and worked
out briefly in the Pavilion under the
direction of Coach Albert Robinson.
Robinson, who also coaches football,
has been at the Peoria post for over
15 years.
Peoria. Illinois, the home town of
Badley University, is a typical
Midwestern basketball town, with
the whole community behind the
team. As a result, winning is a
"must" at Bradley.
The Braves arc putting particular

emphasis on this game with Stan
ford, because it is one of the few
remaining stumbling blocks in the
way of a bid to the Madison Square
Garden Invitational Tournament.
The president of the university has
accompanied the team here for the
game.
The Indians will be out to avenge
the 56 to 51 loss to Bradley suffered
on their ill-fated Midwestern junket
last year.

Bradley, currently rated as the number one team in the Midv/est and fifth in the nation by the
Associated Press, employs a loose, fast-breaking style of offensive play that has enabled them

to run up the amazing average of
70.4 points per game in the 21 con

BRADLEY TOPS ELI 91 TO 56
Twice this year, the Braves have
hit the i)l—point mark- once against
Arizona (91 to 66), and once against
Yale (91 to 56), while they have
been well over the 70 figure in
nearly half their games.
Their only defeat in 21 starts
came at the hands of an obscure,
giant-killing South Dakota U. team
(51 to 54). Bradley played five
games that week, and won the other
four. Numbered among their vic
tims are such teams as Texas Chris
tian, Harvard, USF, Princeton, and
Denver.
The Bradley attack is led by lan
ky center Paul Unruh, and by a
s—ft. 8-in. forward sensation named
Gene Melchiorre.
Urnuh, a G-ft. 4-in. sophomore, is
the team's leading scorer with
slightly .over a Hi-point per game
average, although Melchiorre isn't
far behind. Last year, Unruh set a
single season school scoring record
with 383 points.
Melchiorre is in his first year of
college competition, but played for
two years for Fort Sheridan, where
lie was the nation's seventh leading
scorer in 1946.
Playing with Melchiorre on the
Fort Sheridan five was forward Bill
Maim. Also a freshman, Mann I
stands (5 ft. 1 in., is a good rebound
artist and an outstanding floor man.
BRAVES lIIT 40 PER CENT
Melchiorre, Mann, and Unruh all
have shooting percentages of over j
40 per cent. Mann stands fourth in
the country in this respect with 43.1
per cent, while Melchiorre ranks j
fifth.
For a team that concentrates on ;
offense as much as it does, Bradley i
is no slouch on defense either.
Defensive star of the game is I
guard Dave Humerickhouse, who
was placed on the defensive All- :
American team last season.
Largely through the efforts of j
Humerickhouse and the other start- j
ing guard, George Chianakas, the
Bradley team has been able to hold
its oppontnts to a 46.15 game aver
age.
Bradley won its first six games
in three nights, by playing two
teams each night. This particular
feat might indicate that the Brave
reserves are top flight also.
STEVE MAY START
Indian chances for stopping the
Peoria Express rest largely on the
status of starting center Bill Ste- j
nhenson. Steve has been confined

to the Rest Home with an attack of
the flu, and it is not yet known it
he will be able to play.
It' Stephenson is not able to play,
his place will be taken by either
Bob Penn or Ralph Carver. Both
of these boys turned in a good per
formance against USF last Friday
night.
Captain Babe Higgins will start at
one forward spot for Stanford,
while either Bill Rose or Morley
Thompson will open at the other.
Dave Davidson and Bob Lewis will
start at guard.
The Bradley team arrived in San
Francisco yesterday and worked
out briefly in the Pavilion under the
direction of Coach Albert Robinson.
Robinson, who also coaches football,
has been at the Peoria post for over
15 years.
Peoria. Illinois, the home town of
Badley University, is a typical
Midwestern basketball town, with

emphasis on this game with Stan
ford, because it is one of the few
remaining stumbling blocks in the
way of a bid to the Madison Square

Is the tortoise faster than the hare?
That age-old question will assume a new form tonight at 8, when the Braves of Bradley Univer
sity invade the Pavilion for an intersectional basketball contest with the Stanford varsity.
Bradley, currently rated as the number one team in the Midv/est and fifth in the nation by the
Associated Press, employs a loose, fast-breaking style of offensive play that has enabled them

to run up the amazing average of
70.4 points per game in the 21 con
tests they have played thus far this
season.
.Stanford, on the other hand, owes
much of its success to a slow, de
liberate, play-making offense, coup
led with a very effective sliding
zone defense. Whether Everett
Dean's eagers can slow the Bradley
team down to their own pace re
mains to he seen.
BRADLEY TOPS ELI 91 TO 56
Twice this year, the Braves have
hit the i)l—point mark- once against
Arizona (91 to 66), and once against
Yale (91 to 56), while they have
been well over the 70 figure in
nearly half their games.
Their only defeat in 21 starts
came at the hands of an obscure,
giant-killing South Dakota U. team
(51 to 54). Bradley played five
games that week, and won the other
four. Numbered among their vic
tims are such teams as Texas Chris
tian, Harvard, USF, Princeton, and
Denver.
The Bradley attack is led by lan
ky center Paul Unruh, and by a
s—ft. 8-in. forward sensation named
Gene Melchiorre.
Urnuh, a G-ft. 4-in. sophomore, is
the team's leading scorer with
slightly .over a Hi-point per game
average, although Melchiorre isn't
far behind. Last year, Unruh set a
single season school scoring record
with 383 points.
Melchiorre is in his first year of
college competition, but played for
two years for Fort Sheridan, where
lie was the nation's seventh leading
scorer in 1946.
Playing with Melchiorre on the
Fort Sheridan five was forward Bill
Maim. Also a freshman, Mann I
stands (5 ft. 1 in., is a good rebound
artist and an outstanding floor man.
BRAVES lIIT 40 PER CENT
Melchiorre, Mann, and Unruh all
have shooting percentages of over j
40 per cent. Mann stands fourth in
the country in this respect with 43.1
per cent, while Melchiorre ranks j
fifth.
For a team that concentrates on ;
offense as much as it does, Bradley i
is no slouch on defense either.
Defensive star of the game is I
guard Dave Humerickhouse, who
was placed on the defensive All- :
American team last season.
Largely through the efforts of j
Humerickhouse and the other start- j
ing guard, George Chianakas, the
Bradley team has been able to hold
its oppontnts to a 46.15 game aver
age.
Bradley won its first six games
in three nights, by playing two
teams each night. This particular
feat might indicate that the Brave
reserves are top flight also.
STEVE MAY START
Indian chances for stopping the
Peoria Express rest largely on the
status of starting center Bill Ste- j
nhenson. Steve has been confined

to the Rest Home with an attack of
the flu, and it is not yet known it
he will be able to play.
It' Stephenson is not able to play,
his place will be taken by either
Bob Penn or Ralph Carver. Both
of these boys turned in a good per
formance against USF last Friday
night.
Captain Babe Higgins will start at
one forward spot for Stanford,
while either Bill Rose or Morley
Thompson will open at the other.
Dave Davidson and Bob Lewis will
start at guard.
The Bradley team arrived in San
Francisco yesterday and worked
out briefly in the Pavilion under the
direction of Coach Albert Robinson.
Robinson, who also coaches football,
has been at the Peoria post for over
15 years.
Peoria. Illinois, the home town of
Badley University, is a typical
Midwestern basketball town, with
the whole community behind the
team. As a result, winning is a
"must" at Bradley.
The Braves arc putting particular

emphasis on this game with Stan
ford, because it is one of the few
remaining stumbling blocks in the
way of a bid to the Madison Square
Garden Invitational Tournament.
The president of the university has
accompanied the team here for the
game.
The Indians will be out to avenge
the 56 to 51 loss to Bradley suffered
on their ill-fated Midwestern junket
last year.
