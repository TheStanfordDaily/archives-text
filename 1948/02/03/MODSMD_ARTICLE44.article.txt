## Wolter Guides Indian Baseballers Since 1916 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
When anyone thinks of Stanford
baseball, the first tiling that comes
to his mind is our own dean of the
diamond, Harry Meiggs Wolter. Well
liked and respected by fans and
players alike, Wolter is now in his
twenty-sixth year as head master
of varsity baseball.
His long reign as diamond director
officially began on the Farm in 1916,
but after one short year Harry re
turned to the majors to play for
the Chicago Cubs.
He came back to Stanfofrd in 19211
a seasoned veteran of professional
play, and this valuable experience
has been a great factor in his well
known development of Cardinal
baseballers.
COACHED CARDS IN 2.5
After Wolter's first real year of
Stanford coaching in '23, the Quad
said of him, "Harry Wolter has
brought a new regime and a differ
ent system to Stanford baseball.
Teaching the men the fundament
als of the game, he has insisted on
strict obedience and faithful work "
These characteristics have not
changed down through the years,
and these words could have been
written today as well as in 1923.
Wolter is known to play no favor
ites among "his boys," and he treats
his stars as he does the lowest rookie
on the team.
Born in Monterey, Wolter started
playing baseball on the town team.
He calls this first playing his great
est day in baseball. He attended
Santa Clara University and played
against Stanford in his early days.
He later coached the Broncos for a

j number of years before coming here.
PLAYED FOR CINCY
In 1907 he signed a contract with
the Cincinnati Reds and played out
field in one of the toughest outfield
pastures in the majors. The year
1!!03 saw Wolter playing "outlaw"
baseball in the California league,
j and of tins activity in his career he
-ays, "You see, I'm still a rebel."
A fractured leg sustafhed in a si id -
in'* accident held Harry down for
awhile, but it was not long before
he was back in uniform. He also
played for the New York Yankees
while in the majors, and it was while
with them that he had his most
memorable play.
The opening day of the 1910 sea
son found him in a Yankee uniform
.'for the first time. That day Harry
; parked a ninth inning grandslam
homer on top of the clubhouse roof
to tie the game at four-all
During his stay in the "big time"
Wolter played outfield and pitched.
He is left handed and one of the best
fungo hitters in the business. In the
Coast League lie played for Los An
geles and Sacramento,
HEADED OLYMPIC NINE
One of the greatest honors which
could be paid to any coach was given
to him when he was chosen to head
the baseball team at the 1936 Olym
pic Games. At the Berlin classic his
team marched onto the field before
spectators to demonstrate
our American pastime. He has also
taken Stanford teams to Japan and
Australia.
It was in 1924 that Farm fans
began to appreciate his style of di
recting winning teams Stanford had
not won a Cal series in five years,
But '24 was different, and the Wol
ters men after winning seven
straight went out and took the Bears
two games to one.
Wolter was the first baseball coach
to make the diamond sport really
popular at Stanford. Concerning the
1524 Big Came series the Daily Palo
Alto said "Hits into the crowd were
made automatic doubles."
This is an indication of the en
thusiasm the Farm followers had
for the team, since two of the games
were played at Berkeley.
The last contest was played here,
and Harry turned out in spite of a
bad cold to coach the team to a 5
to 2 win Over Cal before a capacity
crowd.
194?) TO BE LAST YEAR
Next year will- be his last as
official coach of baseball here at
Stanford, but we all know that he
will be on the field either in spirit
or in person whenever a Cardinal
baseball team is playing.
As to the chances for the 1948 team
he was neither pessimistic nor over
ly optimistic, but just said, "We'll
be better than last year."
Then he turned to look over the
uniforms in order to have the team
ready for another season, for many
their first as a Stanford player, for
Hary Wolter his twenty-sixth.
