# Stanford Poloists Lose to Ranchers
## 
### 
Spectators at Sunday's polo match
saw the fastest and hardest fought
game of the year when the Palo Alto
Ranchers avenged their previous 16
to 2 defeat by eluding a very stub
born Indian team to score 5 goals
to 1.
Veteran Player Pat Linfoot, on
fast and handy mounts, drew from
his bag of tricks in every chukker,
moving from one position to anoth
er, across the field with short
strokes, and then dowfield in races
to the goal. These unorthodox tac
tics were made possible by the de
pendable hitting and clever horse
manship of his teammates Bob Barr
and Allen Ross who kept the Farm
players more than occupied.
Most of the game was played mid
field with the ball passing from one
team to the either, but several bad
breaks for Stanford, including a
Palo Alto goal kicked by an Indian
mount, and Linfoot's deceptiveness,
made the game Palo Alto's. A fall,
collision, and a spectacular drive by
Bill Foster added to the excitement
of a high speed and hotly contested
match.
