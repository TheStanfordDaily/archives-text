# Bulldogs Meet Frosh Five In Prelim Tonight
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
In what is described by Coach
Jack Dana as being "our toughest
game so far." the Stanford Fresh
man basketball team will meet a
highly rated San Mateo Junior Col
lege quintet in tonight's prelimin
ary. Tip off time is 6:15.
The visiting Bulldogs boast a 15
won and 3 loss record and lay claim
to the California Junior College
championship via their four wins in
last month's JC tourney at Modesto*
SAN MATEANS TALLER
Dana's yearlings will go into the
contest with a definite height dsiad
vantage. Two of the visitors reach
beyond the 6' 3" mark and the start
ing line-up will average above the
six foot mark.
Against the high scoring lads from
up the Peninsula, Mentor Jack will
lead with the starting five that has
seen the most action in the last sev
en contests.
A brace of Watsons, Fran and
Paul, will start at the forward posi
tions. Regular Bill Herron will work
the slot with Marvin Gelber and
Captain Dick Clegg handling the
guard chores.
Dana passed over Saturday's 41 to
28 victory over Piedmont High
school with but two comments. One
regarded Captain Clegg's improved
drive and speed from the guard po
sition.
"He looks much better than at the
beginning of the season," said Dana.
He added "you will see more scor
ing done by Gelber from now on.
He's got one of the best two hand
ed shots from the outside that I've
seen in a long time. I've told him to
use it more."
WIN SIX OUT OF SEVEN
While the Frosh have won six out
of seven contests, only three of the
wins have been over squads above
high school rating. They downed
Salinas JC by a 48 to 41 score and
triumphed over the California year
lings twice, 41 to 39, and 35 to 30.
Dana phrased his opinion of to
night's contest in no uncertain
terms. He said, "We can beat San
Mateo if every one of our boys set
tles down and plays the type of ball
that they are capable of doing. We
can score, and one of these nights
we will start hitting together."
