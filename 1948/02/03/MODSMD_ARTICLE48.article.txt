# Yearlings Need Pole Vaulters
## 
### 
"We will have a fairly sti-ong
Freshman track squad this season,
but one which will be handicapped
by the loss of 18 points before each
meet because of a shortage of pole
vaulters and high jumpers," stated
Coach Jack Weiershauser in a recent
inteview.
This first freshman team since
ir.42 will be strongest in the middle
distances and in the relay in which
Joss Scroggy of San Francisco, Cas
Bly from Santa Cruz, Chuck Trask
from Everett, Washington, High
School, John Holloway from San
Diego, and Hicks Williams, also from
San Diego, will run. All have bet
tered 51 flat in high school and have
been looking good in practice.
Outstanding in the half mile are
Drew Terramorse from Sequoia
High School, and Norman Miller
from Cleveland, both of whom have
run under the 2:05 mark. Pacing the
milers is Woody Bray who ran the
distance in 4:39.3 last fall.
Heading the sprinters are Ronnie
Buck, John Robertson, John Hollo
way, Bob Bryan (brother of Gay),
and Gordon Graham. Top prospects
in the hurdles at present are Pete
Young from Washington (state),
who has run the highs in 15.2, Bill
Neff from San Francisco, son of St
Mary's basketball coach, John Ro
bertson, and Bob Bryan.
Merritt Van Sant, Bob Bryan, and
Frosh footballer Boyd Benson are
the leading broad jump candidates
and show much promise.
Bob Scott paces the discus men
with a recent heave of 135 feet, but
is closely followed by another
freshman football squad memberâ€”
center Dick Abarham, who has
thrown the discus 133 feet and put
the 12-pound shot 50 feet.
Most of the above men have been
practicing since fall quarter and are
nto a complete picture of the fresh
man hopes. Antoher 35 prospects
have signed up this quarter and
have not .yet had the time to work
themselves into shape. Many of
these have excellent high school
records and will be heard from once
the track season gets under way.
