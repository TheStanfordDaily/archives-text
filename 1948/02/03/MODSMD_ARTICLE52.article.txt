# BULL SESSION

### JOE AVILA 
We often wonder if old agriculturists here on the
farm realize what a drama of readjustment is being
enacted about them as each quarter brings its influx
of new students.
We can still remember (after three whole weeks)
the feeling of hopelessness which hung over us like
an (awe)-ra as we drove past the fine, big sign and
onto the Stanford Village reservation.
On hand to greet us was a lean, learned-looking
fellow who looked us over with a critical eye (which
wc presumed to be his own).
"I'm the Resident Assistant," he said apologetically.
Never having met a bona fide Resident Assistant in
our travels, we had no comeback.
"Fine little place we got here," he said uneasily.
"'Course it ain't no hotel Mark Francis, or even no
Wallecl-off Castoria, but it's homey," he concluded
encouragingly. "You a vet?"
"Yep."
"Thought so. You vets always have a serious air
about you."
We hit a brace.
"Seem more determined," he went on.
Our jaw hardened.
"Well, we try to run a respectable hous . . er . . run
our little village according to the true democratic
ideals and if anyone says 'Hi' to you he's only being
friendly." he said, quoting from an orientation sheet
we'd read earlier in the day.
"We'll just 'Hi' right back," we replied, feeling
democratic from head to toe.
"Must feel good to be free of that old army rou
tine," he chatted, as he led us into our four-man
cubicle in the north wing of the converted G.I.
hospital. "Nice atmosphere, lotsa' friends all together,
oughta be able to help each other out with each
other's studies."
We agreed feebly.
"Nothing like companionship I always say," he
said with the ease of long practice. "Three, four
radios in every room, too—like music?
"Uhh . . ."
'Everybody does," he agreed, his keen insight
detecting our esthetic side.
"You'll probably have some favorite program you'll

want to listen to. Don't worry none. Everybody listens
to whatever he likes. Why, sometimes they'll be
seven or eight radios all playing at oncet. Were
democratic that way," he added.
"You'll probably be wanting to use the washroom,'
he -said prophetically, his eyes twinkling with sophis
ticated merriment. "Lotsa company there, too—never
a dull moment," he encouraged. "Hasn t realized its
full possibilities yet, though. But they'll get the lights
in next week. Then kerosene lamps keep smelling up
the place."'
He rolled an elliptical cigarette from a small bag
of tobacco, then closed the bag with a firm tug on the
drawstring provided for that purpose.
"Sure beats them ready-mades," he said, holding
his right index finger over a small leak which his
masterpiece had sprung amidships and from which
blue smoke was spewing and curling.
"By the way, mess-hall's just across that field there,
can't see it now, sun's not out clear enough yet. Pretty
good chow, cafeteria-style, get to eat anything you
want—if they got ft." Having thus encouraged and
oriented us with one final staggering blow, he pre
pared to leave.
"Oh, gosh!" he goshed noisily. '"I must go back
and welcome some more guests—happy Winter quar
ter! ! !"
"The same to you," we cried gleefully, really get
ting into the democratic spirit at last.
Later, when the sun "got up clear enough'' we
sighted on a smokestack and cut our way through the
tall grass to the "mess-hall." As we emerged from
the edge of the thicket our eye caught what appeared
to be the tail end of a block-long chow-line. Our
pupils dilated, we went into a civilian version of the
Section Eight stare, and would surely have bolted had
it not been for the restaraining hand of an old friend
named Livingstone, whom we had chanced upon
very dramatically back there in the sea of grass.
"There, there now," he said soothingly, pinning our
arms behind us with a half-nelson, "at least you don't
have to wear no uniform,"
Then he released us and we felt much better . . .
And then we ate. . . .
