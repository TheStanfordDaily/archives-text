## Freshman Warning 
### 
To the Editor:
The sight of so many sophomores shaking in their
boots in fear of the battle to take place next weekend
has struck a chord of benevolencc in our hearts. We
feci that we should give you people a chance to sur
render now and avoid the needless shedding of your
blood, which will obviously take place if you persist
in feeling that you can stand up against our superior
forces.
In case you feel that you would lose what face you
have by backing out now, we have made certain
arrangements to make the struggle more equal. At
great expense we have imported eleven old ladies,
the youngest of whom is just passing sixty-five, from
the San Francisco Old Ladies' Home to play football
with your team—if you can find eleven men in the
sophomore class who are strong enough to carry a ball!
We feel that we should also remind you sophomore
gentlemen about the rules of the beard growing con
test. Using hair restorer is illegal, so give it up. There
must be one rugged male in the sophomore class whom
you can enter in the contest.
Well, boys, we just wanted you to know how we
feel about this thing. We really don't want to slaughter
you, but, you know that's the way life is—the fittest
survive.
