# More on Greenland

To the Editor:
The "complaints" about the U.S. position on Green
land seem to be neither of Danish nor of American
origin. At least, I did not hear any complaints about
thi.s problem when I was in Denmark three months ago.
Undoubtedly these complaints are identical with
a new sharp wind from Siberia piercing some minds
in this country. It is hard to believe that this icy
Siberian wind, extinguishing life in Soviet occupied
Europe, should turn here into warm "justice towards
a small nation."
The Danes know very well that the Soviet armies
which occupied Bornholm (Baltic Sea) as a spring
board for getting into Denmark, could afford to leave

this island because, coming from nearby German
ports, they can easily return again in a couple of hours.
The mysterious missiles over Sweden which forced
the Swedes to surrender to the Soviet dictated com
mercial treaty show what can be done from the German
Baltic ports occupied by the Soviet armies.
The Danes know as well as the Soviet General
Staff that the Americans, having once left Greenland,
will not be able to come back so soon. Thus for the
Danes Greenland with the U.S. military bases can
turn into Hamlet's "to be or not to be'' question if
the almighty Politbureau in Moscow suddenly decides
to "liberate the Danish proletariat from the capitalist
slavery," as they did in the other Baltic states.
Why then should the icy wind of Siberia warm the
conscience of justice of the sensible and benevolent
people here when there is a perfectly warm and
bright California climate? One should not split hairs
on the "Greenland problem" and neglect the dangers
to the American way of life itself.
