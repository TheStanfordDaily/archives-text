# Politics 1948?
## 
### 
To The Editor:
Having read more than one article by George
Brunn, may I suggest that the title of your column
called "History 1948"' be changed? It is my opinion
that "Politics 1948" would be a better title. Political
bickering cannot really be called "history" and should
not be aired in a column dedicated (1 presume from
the title) to the cause of making current history plain.
I am sure that everyone, even communists, should
have the right to set forth their views in The Daily,
but they should write under some such title as "The
Latest Communique from Moscow."
