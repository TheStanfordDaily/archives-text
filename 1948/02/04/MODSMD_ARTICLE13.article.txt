### JACKIE MILNOR 
Labor Member of Parliament, Ed
ward A. A. Schaeklcton, told a large
audience at the Tuesday Evening
Scries last night that Britain will be
able lo stand on her own feet with
out American aid within this year
if she keeps her production rising at
its present rate.
Only by this emphasis on produc
tion can Britain become solvent, as
her economy is based on exporting
enough goods in order to import
food and raw materials, Mr. Shack
leton said.
PLANNED ECONOMY
All British realize this, and are
therefore subjecting themselves, un
der the planned economy of their
Labor Government, to tight ration
ing in order to save goods for export.
Mr. Shaekleton said that the pol
icy of the Labor Government is
based upon human rights, for "only
with these rights can man progress
and retain freedom." But it is some
times necessary for community in
terests to take precedence over pri
vate.
NATIONALIZATION
The Labor Government applies
this policy to the nationalization of
Britain's basic industries, so that
the profits of these industries will
benefit the community.
Mr. Shaekleton assured the aud
ience that British Socialism is en
tirely democratic, in that the people
have the opportunity to change their
government if they wish, and still
retain their civil liberties.
