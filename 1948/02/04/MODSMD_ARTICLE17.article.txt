# Newman Announces Honor Code Resolutions, Sub-Committees, Indoctrination Procedure
## 
### 
The Honor Code Standing Com
mittee, in order to settle the ques
tion of specific or general interpre
tation of the Honor Code, has
adopted the following resolutions:
"In accepting the privileges and
responsibilities of the Honor Code,
the student indicates his respect for
order, morality, personal honor, and
rights of others which arc embodied
in the Fundamental Standard. Such
a moral philosophy is necessary if
a system such as the Honor Code is
to work successfully.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
"Th.c Honor Code in itself is that
part of the Fundamental Standard
which applies to academic work
These two together form the basis
for the moral code of our Univer
sity. They are fundamental and
must be applied intelligently, never
serving trivial or selfish interests."
"This resolution," stated commit
tee chairman Cal Newman, "should
clear up the numerous queries we I
have received as to whether the j
Honor Code should apply specifi- |
cally to acadcmic work or to con- j
duct in general."
TEMPORARY \PPOINTMENTS
Newman also announced tempo
rary appointments to the various j
sub-committees which are to work
in conjunction with the Honor Code j
Committee.
"In choosing committee members,' j
said Newman, "we considered al! ;
applications at considerable length. |
And far more applications than we .

expected were received. It was only
after a long process of elimination
that we were able to set up these
committees.
"The need for these committees is
evident: the University's expansion
has fostered a lack of familiarity
with the Honor Code, for the indoc
trination of students and faculty

alike has been far from complete."

"In accepting the privileges and
responsibilities of the Honor Code,
the student indicates his respect for
order, morality, personal honor, and
rights of others which arc embodied
in the Fundamental Standard. Such
a moral philosophy is necessary if
a system such as the Honor Code is
to work successfully.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
"Th.c Honor Code in itself is that
part of the Fundamental Standard
which applies to academic work
These two together form the basis
for the moral code of our Univer
sity. They are fundamental and
must be applied intelligently, never
serving trivial or selfish interests."
"This resolution," stated commit
tee chairman Cal Newman, "should
clear up the numerous queries we I
have received as to whether the j
Honor Code should apply specifi- |
cally to acadcmic work or to con- j
duct in general."
TEMPORARY \PPOINTMENTS
Newman also announced tempo
rary appointments to the various j
sub-committees which are to work
in conjunction with the Honor Code j
Committee.
"In choosing committee members,' j
said Newman, "we considered al! ;
applications at considerable length. |
And far more applications than we .

expected were received. It was only
after a long process of elimination
that we were able to set up these
committees.
"The need for these committees is
evident: the University's expansion
has fostered a lack of familiarity
with the Honor Code, for the indoc
trination of students and faculty

alike has been far from complete."
