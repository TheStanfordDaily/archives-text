JERUSALEM, Palestine, Feb. 3
(UP) â€”Arabs ambushed a bus con
taining passengers from a Swiss air
lines plane near Lydda airport to
night, but the Jewish driver smash
ed his way through a load barrier
and drove on through a fusillade of
bullets.
Earlier one Jewish woman was
killed and .10 Jews were wounded
when a bus convoy was attacked as
it passed an Arab Legion camp near
Haifa.
Between two and four Arab pris
oners escaped tonight when Arabs
blew a breach in the thick wall of
the Jerusalem Central prison.
A truck drove up to the Arab Na
tional Society's building In Haifa
just before dusk. Some of the men
in it rolled out a barrel bomb as the
truck drove off, and then escaped
in a wailing limousine. In addition
to the four Arabs killed in the en
suing explosion three were wounded.
It was believed tlie Haifa bomb
ing was in retaliation for the bomb
ing of the Jewish-owned Palestine
Post here Sunday night.
