### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP)—
The United States today curtly re
jected the second in a series of Rus
sion protests against American ac
tivities in the Mediterranean and
the Far East—this one a complaint
that re-opening of a wartime U.S.
r base in Libya violates the Ital
ian peace treaty.
Undersecretary of State Robert A.
Lovett brushed off the new Soviet
protest with an unusually short note
to Russian Ambassador Alexander
Panyushkin.
NOT INCONSISTENT
It said that the United States does
not consider the Libyan air base
operation "in any way inconsistent"
with the Italian treaty.
Libya is temporarily under Brit
ish administration pending a Big
Four decision on the disposal of that
and other former Italian colonics.
Permission for re-opening of the
base was granted b.V Britain.
Lovett said the United States in
tends to use the field at Mehalla,
near Tripoli, for communications
purposes only as long as the present
Libyan administrative set-up re
mains in force.
FORMAL PROTEST
Earlier, the State Department dis
closed that Russia has filed another
formal protest accusing American
airmen of interfering with Soviet
commercial shipping in the Yellow
Sea and the Sea of Japan.
The note said that on at least 10
occasions between Aug. .'JO and Oct.
27, 1047, American planes circled or
flew low over Russian ships.
