# Personality Triumphs; Kelley Is Roble 1C King
## 
### 
"King for ;i Day" was chosen by
! Roblc corridor 1C last. Monday
night. Looking for the man with
die most personality, most fun, and
best looks, the women thumbed
through the pictures in the frosh
book. If any woman knew the man,
he was immediately eliminated to
avoid rivalry. Judging was purely
on the basis of the picture.
The triumphant freshman king is
j Bruce Kelley, fifth-floor Encina
man from San Francisco. The king
will be escorted to dinner Sunday
night by the entire corridor, will re
ceive a carnation, and be taken to a
movie.
