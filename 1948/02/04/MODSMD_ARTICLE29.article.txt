### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP).-
The House voted overwhelmingly
today to boost federal payments to
career-seeking war veterans.
It approved, 370 to t>. a Senate bill
hiking subsistence benefits for vet
erans enrolled in schools and col
leges under the CI Bill of Rights.
The measure now goes to the White
House for President Truman's sig
nature.
Single veterans will get $75 a
month from the government, instead
of the present $65, during educa
tional training. Veterans with one
dependent will gel $105, and those
with more than one dependent will
be allowed $120. Now a veteran
with dependents, no matter how
many, receives only $90.
Six Republicans voted against the
billâ€”Reps. Charles A. Eaton, N.J..
Robert W. Kean, N.J., William L.
Miller, Conn., Daniel A. Reed, N.Y.,
Horace Seely-Brown, Conn., and
John Taber, N.Y.
Earlier, the House voted, 371 to 5,
for a bill by Rep. Bernard W. Kear
ney, R., N.Y., which would make it
possible for veterans taking on-the
job training to boost their monthly
incomes with the help of the gov
ernment and their employers.
A similar measure was approved
by the Senate last year. Differences
will have to be worked out by a
Senate-House conference group.
