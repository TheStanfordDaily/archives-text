# Presidential Committee on Civil Rights Warns That American Liberties Should Be Guarded
## 
### AL RUBEN 
Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of three articles spon
sored by The Daily to foster an
awareness of the danger among
Stanford students of accepting
as a self-perpetuating thing the
close association' between our
country and such terms as toler
ance, equality, and freedom.

These articles are a condensation
of the report of the President's Com
mittee on Civil Rights. Emphasis
has been laid on those sections of
the report deemed most pertinent
to us as students of a university
and citizens of a community. AH
material not enclosed in parenthesis

j has been taken verbatim from the
I report.
THE AMERICAN HERITAGE
i We have a great heritage of free
i dom and equality for all men, some-
I times called "the American way."
| Yet we cannot avoid the knowledge
• that the American ideal still awaits
I complete realization.
We can tolerate no restrictions
upon the individual which depends
• upon irrelevant factors such as his
| race, his color, his religion or the
i social position to which he is born.
TIIE ESSENTIAL RIGHTS
To deny qualified citizens the
j right to vote while others exercise
it is to do violence to the principle
j of freedom and equality. Without
I the right to vote, the individual
j loses his voice in the group effort
| and is subjected to rule by a body
! from which he has been excluded.
In a free society there is faith in
t the ability of the people to make
! sound, rational judgments. But such
judgments are possible only where
| the people have access to all rele
; vant facts and to all prevailing in
j terpretations of the facts. How can
i such judgments be formed on a
, sound basis if arguments, viewpoints,
i or opinions are arbitrarily suppress
| ed?
' The Committee reaffirms our tra
i dition that freedom of expression
i may be curbed by law only where
i the danger to the well-being of so-
I ciety is clear and present.
Pride (in our heritage) is no sub
) stitute for steady and honest per
| formanco, and the record shows that

at varying times in American his
tory the gulf between ideals and
practice has been wide. We have
had human slavery. We have had
religious persecution. We have had
mob rule. We still have their ideol
ogical remnants in the unwarrant
able "pride and prejudice" of some
of our people and practices.
THE RECORD: SHORT OF GOAL
If the people are to govern them
selves their only hope of doing so
wisely lies in the collective wisdom
derived from the fullest possible in
formation, and in the fair presenta
tion of differing opinions. The right
is also necessary to permit each man
to find his way to the religious and
political beliefs which suit his pri
vate needs.
This committee unqualifiedly op
poses any attempt to impose special
limitations on the rights (of Com
munists ami Fascists) to speak and
assemble. Public excitement about
"Communists" has gone far beyond
the dictates of—"good judgment"
and "calmness." A state of near
hysteria now threatens to inhibit the
freedom of genuine democrats.
If we fall back upon hysteria and
repression as our weapons against
totalitarians, we will defeat our
selves.
