## 
### JACKIE MILNOR 
Dave Colburn, a -graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering, spent i
three months last summer in Fin- !
land, living with students from Eu
rope and America, and helping re- 1
build the Finnish homes.
Miss Stella Toogood, who teaches \
at Castilleja School in Palo Alto,
attended an international student
seminar in Farragut, Idaho, this (
summer, along with students from i
14 other nations.
Miss Toogood and Colburn will
tell their experiences this afternoon j
at 4:15 in the "Y" rooms. The meet
ing is sponsored by the summer
projects committee of ihe YWCA
and the* Stanford Council for
UNESCO.
COMMUNITY SPIRIT
Colburn is enthusiastic about his
work in Finland. "I not only felt 1
was actually helping the Finns re- 1
bui'd both their houses and their !
community spirit, but also I could !
sec what the real situation was over !
there, and what should be done |
here to help build for peace," he
said.
By actually working side by side j
with students from Switzerland, \
Denmark, and Finland, he felt that j
he got to know them as friends. "We
had a real community spirit. We
worked together. We had interests
in common, and thus broke down
the artificial barriers between us,"
he •ontinued.
"Thev'd invite us into their homes
for coffee. We learned their lan
guage over the summer, and we'd
sit around and laugh and make
jokes. They're so very anxious to
be friendly."
"They'd discuss everything except
politics. Even though they have a
democratic government, they feel it
is not their place to criticize," he
went on.
IREMENDOUS NATIONALISM
"They wouldn't talk about their
status in the war either. We Amer
icans wanted to bring the subject
out in the open, and try to under
stand their viewpoint. But, they're
tremendously nationalistic, and be
lieve that they did the best they
could under the circumstances."
. "We found that they have a de
temined snirit over there — they're
determined to rebuild their land
and their economy," he concluded.
Miss Toogood lived for three
months with students from all over
the world. "We wanted to see if the
understanding necessary for one
wo'-'d was nossible." she said.
INTERNATIONALISM
One European student was a
member of the Communist party. A
Czech girl had been in a German
concentration camp. One student
was from India and another was an
American Negro.
"All of us had trouble adjusting
at first, particularly the Europeans,
for they were intensely individual
istic, and hated regimentation of
any sort.
"But we hashed out the differ
ences in our regular town meetings.
And by the end of the summer ev
eryone hated to leave the friends
they had made. The Communist be
came more tolerant —he became ca
pable of seeing that perhaps we had
a side too. and in the end accepted
us as completely as we accepted
him." she added.
These and more experiences in

international understanding will be
related this afternoon. Everyone in
terested is invited to attend.
