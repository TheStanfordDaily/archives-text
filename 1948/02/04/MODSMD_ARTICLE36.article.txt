# Cards Drop 47-46 Thriller To Fast Bradley Quintet
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Little Bobby Garber of Bradley University stole another bas
ketball game from Stanford last night.
With less than two minutes to play, Stanford leading 46 to 45,
Garber grabbed the ball from Babe Higgins at midcourt, went
under to score a lay-up to put Bradley ahead, 47 to 46, and

that's how the game ended. It was
this same Garber, a fast 5 ft. 5 in. re
serve guard, who beat Stanford in a
similar way in last year's Bradley
game.
Right up to this time it looked
as though the high-scoring Braves
from Peoria were going to take an
object lesson in defensive basketball
from Everett Dean's cagers.
Trailing 24 to 19 at halltime and
28 to 19 three minutes into the sec
ond period, Stanford went ahead
midway in the last half, 38 to 37.
Bradley tied it up again at 45-all
with three minutes to go. A free
throw by Stephenson put the In
dians ahead again and then came
Garber.
INDIANS CONTROL BOARDS
In the remaining two minutes
Stanford's only real shot was a try
from the right hand corner by Gus
Chavalas which came awfully close
to going in.
Bradley's offense was as fast as
expected, but their first shots off
the fast break were missing, and
Stanford was controlling the boards.
Stanford, on the other hand, was
getting plenty of shots, including
many which were going in and out.
Stephenson has never looked bet
ter at the pivot post than he did
last night. He winged in 18 points
himself, passed to teammates for
many more and in general looked
like anything but a man just out of
a sickbed.
Only member of the visiting quin
tet who was hitting with much reg
ularity was center Paul Unruh with
one and two-handed jump shots in
and around the circle. Unruh scored
15 points.
The game started out slowly, the
first field goal coming more than
three minutes after the tipoff.
STANFORD TAKES LEAD
Stanford grabbed a four point lead
at 13 minutes of the first half, as j
Stephenson scored on two left hand- I
ed hook shots, and Bill Rose potted
his favorite shot coining in on the
outside of the keyhole.
Paul Unruh's brother Dan was
sent into the game at this point and
held Stephenson in check for the :
rest of the half.
Bradley went ahead as Stanford
scored only two more field goals in
the half, the last a two-handed shot
by George Yardley from behind the
w center line with five seconds to play.
2j After the Bradley margin had
7 stretched to nine points in the sec
ond half, the Stanford storm broke.
First it was George Yardley go
ing for a lay-in off a beautiful Ste
phenson pass. Score 28 to 21. Then
Rose from outside the keyhole—
28 to 23. A free throw by Dan Unruh
made it 29. Then within 20 seconds
of one another Davidson and Rose
hit to make it 29 to 27.
FOLLOW SHOT BY UNRUH
A follow shot by Paul Unruh |
broke the Stanford streak, and it
was 31 to 27. Yardley took another
pass from Stephenson for an under
the-basket shot, and Stanford was j
only two points behind. A free throw j
by Steve brought the Indians to
within one point before Bradley re
covered.
The Peorians' lead went to five
points again, but Rose scored one,
Stephenson two, Stanford went
ahead, and the crowd which filled
the Pavilion, went wild.
It remained in that condition until
the end of the game.
Coach Everett Dean said after the
game that Stanford deserved to win,
although Bradley is a good team.
"All we needed was for just one of \
those follow shots that rimmed the
hoop to go in," he lamented.
As it was, Stanford held Bradley
now victorious in 21 of 22 games, to
fewer points than it has scored in
any other game this season.
Dean rightly refused to single oui
any of his players for special praise,

saying he'd have to mention them
all.
The Indians had a combination
of Yardley, Rose, Stephenson, Hig
gins, and Davidson playing through
most of the second half. These five
men, especially though conceding
much to Bradley in the way of
speed, showed the midwesterners
just about all the basketball they
could handle.

from the right hand corner by Gus
Chavalas which came awfully close
to going in.
Bradley's offense was as fast as
expected, but their first shots off
the fast break were missing, and
Stanford was controlling the boards.
Stanford, on the other hand, was
getting plenty of shots, including
many which were going in and out.
Stephenson has never looked bet
ter at the pivot post than he did
last night. He winged in 18 points
himself, passed to teammates for
many more and in general looked
like anything but a man just out of
a sickbed.
Only member of the visiting quin
tet who was hitting with much reg
ularity was center Paul Unruh with
one and two-handed jump shots in
and around the circle. Unruh scored
15 points.
The game started out slowly, the
first field goal coming more than
three minutes after the tipoff.
STANFORD TAKES LEAD
Stanford grabbed a four point lead
at 13 minutes of the first half, as j
Stephenson scored on two left hand- I
ed hook shots, and Bill Rose potted
his favorite shot coining in on the
outside of the keyhole.
Paul Unruh's brother Dan was
sent into the game at this point and
held Stephenson in check for the :
rest of the half.
Bradley went ahead as Stanford
scored only two more field goals in
the half, the last a two-handed shot
by George Yardley from behind the
w center line with five seconds to play.
2j After the Bradley margin had
7 stretched to nine points in the sec
ond half, the Stanford storm broke.
First it was George Yardley go
ing for a lay-in off a beautiful Ste
phenson pass. Score 28 to 21. Then
Rose from outside the keyhole—
28 to 23. A free throw by Dan Unruh
made it 29. Then within 20 seconds
of one another Davidson and Rose
hit to make it 29 to 27.
FOLLOW SHOT BY UNRUH
A follow shot by Paul Unruh |
broke the Stanford streak, and it
was 31 to 27. Yardley took another
pass from Stephenson for an under
the-basket shot, and Stanford was j
only two points behind. A free throw j
by Steve brought the Indians to
within one point before Bradley re
covered.
The Peorians' lead went to five
points again, but Rose scored one,
Stephenson two, Stanford went
ahead, and the crowd which filled
the Pavilion, went wild.
It remained in that condition until
the end of the game.
Coach Everett Dean said after the
game that Stanford deserved to win,
although Bradley is a good team.
"All we needed was for just one of \
those follow shots that rimmed the
hoop to go in," he lamented.
As it was, Stanford held Bradley
now victorious in 21 of 22 games, to
fewer points than it has scored in
any other game this season.
Dean rightly refused to single oui
any of his players for special praise,

saying he'd have to mention them
all.
The Indians had a combination
of Yardley, Rose, Stephenson, Hig
gins, and Davidson playing through
most of the second half. These five
men, especially though conceding
much to Bradley in the way of
speed, showed the midwesterners
just about all the basketball they
could handle.

sent into the game at this point and
held Stephenson in check for the :
rest of the half.
Bradley went ahead as Stanford
scored only two more field goals in
the half, the last a two-handed shot
by George Yardley from behind the
w center line with five seconds to play.
2j After the Bradley margin had
7 stretched to nine points in the sec
ond half, the Stanford storm broke.
First it was George Yardley go
ing for a lay-in off a beautiful Ste
phenson pass. Score 28 to 21. Then
Rose from outside the keyhole—
28 to 23. A free throw by Dan Unruh
made it 29. Then within 20 seconds
of one another Davidson and Rose
hit to make it 29 to 27.
FOLLOW SHOT BY UNRUH
A follow shot by Paul Unruh |
broke the Stanford streak, and it
was 31 to 27. Yardley took another
pass from Stephenson for an under
the-basket shot, and Stanford was j
only two points behind. A free throw j
by Steve brought the Indians to
within one point before Bradley re
covered.
The Peorians' lead went to five
points again, but Rose scored one,
Stephenson two, Stanford went
ahead, and the crowd which filled
the Pavilion, went wild.
It remained in that condition until
the end of the game.
Coach Everett Dean said after the
game that Stanford deserved to win,
although Bradley is a good team.
"All we needed was for just one of \
those follow shots that rimmed the
hoop to go in," he lamented.
As it was, Stanford held Bradley
now victorious in 21 of 22 games, to
fewer points than it has scored in
any other game this season.
Dean rightly refused to single oui
any of his players for special praise,

saying he'd have to mention them
all.
The Indians had a combination
of Yardley, Rose, Stephenson, Hig
gins, and Davidson playing through
most of the second half. These five
men, especially though conceding
much to Bradley in the way of
speed, showed the midwesterners
just about all the basketball they
could handle.

STEVE STEPHENSON return
ed to the Indian lineup last night
after being out for a week with
the flu, and was high point man
for the evening with 18 points.
Little Bobby Garber of Bradley University stole another bas
ketball game from Stanford last night.
With less than two minutes to play, Stanford leading 46 to 45,
Garber grabbed the ball from Babe Higgins at midcourt, went
under to score a lay-up to put Bradley ahead, 47 to 46, and

that's how the game ended. It was
this same Garber, a fast 5 ft. 5 in. re
serve guard, who beat Stanford in a
similar way in last year's Bradley
game.
Right up to this time it looked
as though the high-scoring Braves
from Peoria were going to take an
object lesson in defensive basketball
from Everett Dean's cagers.
Trailing 24 to 19 at halltime and
28 to 19 three minutes into the sec
ond period, Stanford went ahead
midway in the last half, 38 to 37.
Bradley tied it up again at 45-all
with three minutes to go. A free
throw by Stephenson put the In
dians ahead again and then came
Garber.
INDIANS CONTROL BOARDS
In the remaining two minutes
Stanford's only real shot was a try
from the right hand corner by Gus
Chavalas which came awfully close
to going in.
Bradley's offense was as fast as
expected, but their first shots off
the fast break were missing, and
Stanford was controlling the boards.
Stanford, on the other hand, was
getting plenty of shots, including
many which were going in and out.
Stephenson has never looked bet
ter at the pivot post than he did
last night. He winged in 18 points
himself, passed to teammates for
many more and in general looked
like anything but a man just out of
a sickbed.
Only member of the visiting quin
tet who was hitting with much reg
ularity was center Paul Unruh with
one and two-handed jump shots in
and around the circle. Unruh scored
15 points.
The game started out slowly, the
first field goal coming more than
three minutes after the tipoff.
STANFORD TAKES LEAD
Stanford grabbed a four point lead
at 13 minutes of the first half, as j
Stephenson scored on two left hand- I
ed hook shots, and Bill Rose potted
his favorite shot coining in on the
outside of the keyhole.
Paul Unruh's brother Dan was
sent into the game at this point and
held Stephenson in check for the :
rest of the half.
Bradley went ahead as Stanford
scored only two more field goals in
the half, the last a two-handed shot
by George Yardley from behind the
w center line with five seconds to play.
