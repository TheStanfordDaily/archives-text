# Frosh Bow To SMJC
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
For the second time this season
the Stanford Freshman basketball
team tasted defeat as they were
downed 45 to 42 by a taller San
Mateo Junior College five in the
preliminary tilt in the Pavilion last
night.
The half-time score was 26 to 20
in favor of the victors.
For the Freshmen it was a hard
one to lose. Their board play was
better than the men from up the
peninsula as was their overall de
fensive play but their shooting eye
just wasn't there.
FKOSII SCORE FIRST
Stanford scored first on Paul Wat
son's set shot but soon dropped be
hind 6 to 2. Marvin Gelber hemped
a gift toss and a lay-in, Paul Wat
son hit for two again and Gelber
hit from the outside to put the Farm
Yearlings ahead 9 to 8.
The contest progressed with the
lead changing hands until Gelber
scored four and Paul Watson fol
lowed his own long shot for a lay-in
to bring the score to 21 to 20 in the
Bulldogs' favor, with two minutes
remaining in the first half.
Big Bud Goodier pivoted and hit
for the last marker after teammate
Ed Foss had tallied twice to give the
San Mateans a 26 to 20 intermission
lead.
Coming back strong after the in
termission in the second period, the
Danamen hit for four straight buck
ets to go into a 28 to 26 lead. The
markers were counted by Dick
Clegg, Fran Watson, Gelber, and
Paul Watson and at this point it
looked as if the Farm lads were
going to win their seventh contest
of the year.
SCORE KNOTTED
The score was knotted at 33 all
and 36 all before the visiting quin
tet pulled away never to be headed
again, although the highest margin
of victory they could maintain was
but live points.
Paul Watson and Gelber teamed
in the closing moments as they had
done most of the contest to keep the.'
Bulldogs in the danger zone.
San Mateo worked Don McCaslin
from the left side across the key
hole on a pass in from the right
guard for three baskets in the last
four minutes of play. The clincher
came when with two minutes to go,
McCaslin hit for two points to make
the count read 45 to 40.
Center Bill Herron made his only
basket of the evening when he laid
one up to put the Frosh in the race.
Within the last minute of the tilt,
Gelber sank a long shot but was
called for steps and the basket was
nullified.
High point man for the evening
was Gelber with 16 points. Paul
Watson tallied 12 to rank second for
the hosts. Center Bud Goodier was
second for the night with 13 count
ers.
The Stanford Freshmen will meet
Palo Alto High school Saturday.
