### VIC PALMIERI 
Here are some personal notes on three of the boys who carry
the Cardinal colors into the squared circle under the direction
of Farm Boxing Coach Ray Lunny.
EMERY MITCHELL
A transfer from Fresno State College, Emery Mitchell bids

fair to become one of the outstand
ing boxers in Stanford ring annals.
Smal! for a heavyweight, at 5 ft.
9 in. and 187 lbs., Mitchell is de
scribed by Mentor Lunny as "the
best amateur heavyweight I have
ever seen." Alter graduating from
Roosevelt High in Fresno, Mitchell
entered the Army and was attached
to the Bth Army Special Service
Division, where he not only boxed
but also played hallback with the
Clark Field eleven in a league that
included numerous pro stars.
MITCHELL INELIGIBLE
Here at Stanford, as a transfer,
the talented sophomore has been in
eligible for both boxing and football
this year, but has managed to fight
exhibitions as a means of keeping
in trim. In last quarter's All - U
Tournament he looked impressive
in TKOing Bill Brown in one round,
while at Fresno State his laurels
included the championship of the
California Collegiate Athletic As
sociation Tournament.
A pie-legal major, Mitchell looks
forward to entering Law School af
ter graduation, but in the meantime
boxing and football will figure
prominently in his activities, which
should add to the joy of both Lunny
and Marchie Schwartz.
JOE CRANMER
The Farm's top 175-pounder first
saw the light of day in Redlands.
California, and graduated from Red
lands High before entering the

Navy. Stationed at San Diego,
Cranmer's first boxing experience
was gained in fighting in the Base
Tournament in 1C44 as a light
heavy. He won, incidentally. Now
a senior, the sandy-haired 22-year
old has found time to letter twice
in the fistic sport while pursuing
Econ in the hope of entering Busi
ness School 'd'ter graduation.
ALL-U WINNER
Smooth and fast in the ring,
Cranmer has clone some outstanding
boxing while at Stanford. Winning
the championship of his class in the
All-U Tournament in '40. Joe lost
in the finals this year to Elia Long
alter a close, whirlwind bout.
That he takes his fighting seri
ously is evidenced by the fact that
Coach Lunny declares that no one
on the squad trains harder than his
top light-heavy. Intent on making
his last year an impressive one.
Cranmer has come through unde
feated so far this season, and looks
like a good bet to wind up his col
lege boxing career without a loss.
FRED TEN EYCK
Here is a boy who rates as the
smartest boxer on the team, accord
ing to Coach Lunny. Ten Eyck, a
native of Long Beach, California,
started early as a fighter— at the
age of 12, to be exact. His first ex
perience came in fighting at the
Pacific Coast Club in Long Beach,
where he was a member of the club
team while attending Long Beach
Polytechnic High School.
Only a sophomore, with two more
years of eligibility ahead, Fred al
ready has lettered once as a boxer
and this year won the 165—1b class
of the All-U Tournament.
Turned 19 only this year, the
lithe, blond Ten Eyck has proved
too ring-wise for his opponents this
year, being undefeated at this time.
As a pre - medical major, lie has
found no time to compete in other
sporty, but Stanford can look for
ward to boasting the top middle
weight on the coast if he keeps up
his present pace in the ring.
