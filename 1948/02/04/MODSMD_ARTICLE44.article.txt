# Wolter May Cut Squad
## 
### 
Definitely dissatisfied with the
dismal display of ta'ent and effort
put forth by the remaining 30 mem
bers of the varsity baseball team,
who escaped last week's cut, Coach
Harry Wolter stated after viewing
last Friday's intra-squad tussle that
every position on the team is now
"wide open."
With the possible exception of
Captain üßck Brownson at short
stop, no player can rest assured that
a starting post is held securely ei
ther by himself or by some other
player, and an additional trimming
of the team within the next few
days should bring the playing num
ber down to about 25.
Work has been started on a new
practice field, which will be situated
in one corner of the polo grounds,
for those who didn't make the team
but still desire to play some base
ball. There is still a possibility that
games may be lined up for these
men once their field is completed.
Going over the individual teams
in the CIBA circuit, Mr. Wolter
thinks that USC, because of their
reserve strength left over from last
year, and California, pennant win
ners of the CIBA in '47, will be
the toughest opponents for the Car
dinal aggregation this year. On the
whole Mr. Wolter thinks that league
competition will be much better this
year and he looks forward to a good
season, both for the league and for
the Indian nine, 1848 version.
