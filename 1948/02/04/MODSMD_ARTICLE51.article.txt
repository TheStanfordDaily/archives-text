# We're Watching You
## 
### 
The entire campus will watch the freshmen
and sophomores with a great deal of interest
this weekend. Their success or failure in pro
moting inter-class contests may determine a
number of things.
The Pajamarino fiasco has not been forgot
ten. Regardless of who was at fault in the final
analysis it was an unsuccessful class contest.
If the underclassmen prove they can have fun
without damage, they will insure the future of
the annual rally.
A success this weekend may check the re
cent trend away from classes as an operating

unit. Previously class groups have always had
a prominent place in campus life and if an
event sponsored by them, and participated in
by class members as such works out well we
may see a change.
Everyone knows there has been a lack of
social functions recently. All-campus dances
have not been popular, and closed living group
affairs partition the campus. The '50-'5l Jam
boree may be the drawing card that will pull
people out of their social rut.
For these and many other reasons, lower
classmen, we're watching you.â€”M.H.
