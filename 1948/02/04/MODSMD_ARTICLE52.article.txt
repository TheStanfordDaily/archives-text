# BULL SESSION
## 
### WAYNE SARGENT 
Well we finally got some rain.
I thought I was going to have to go all quarter
without being allowed to poke fun at California rain.
Now that we've had a little, and everyone has been
wanting it so badly it just doesn't seem right to harp
on the time worn story about the Oregon mist that
missed Oregon.
People have been standing around in groups
looking at the sky every time a cloud passed overhead,
but until recently they have all turned out to be
empties coming back from Utah and Nevada.
I guess the farmers really needed a little shower.
I heard one farmer say he had a bull frog on his ranch
that was two years old and had never learned to swim.
I was talking to an old friend of mine, Herman
Schmiddling, down in Los Angeles over the telephone
the other day. I told him that everyone up here was
praying for rain, and asked him how the weather was
down there. To which he replied:
"I don't know, it's so goddam foggy I can't tell.
I of course told him to hang up the phone and take
his damn smudge-pot with him.
The farmers aren't the only ones who profited by
the rain. I saw one enterprising young man on campus
collecting it in buckets and passing it off as cellar
coffee at five cents a cup. I bought two cups myself
before I noticed it was too strong to be cellar coffee.

I swear I could put a coffee bean in my mouth and
swim up the Mississippi turning out better coffee mile
for mile.
I suppose the cold spell also brought snow to the
mountains. And you don't need to invite Stanford j
students into the snow any more than I need "have
a drink" repeated a second time.
Every weekend now. anybody who can pry the j
staves off a barrel will be heading to Yosemite to
break their fool legs. I was going to learn to ski this
winter, but I guess 1 H let it slide. I said I was going
to learn to ski this winter, but I guess I'll let it slide.
I was going to learn to ski - - - hell, I know when I m
licked—it isn't going to get any better no matter how j
many times I repeat it.
Seriously though, I am a self-made skier, and it's
a wonderful example of unskilled labor
Well, anyway, I'm glad to see the change in the
weather. The farmers have got their rain, the skiers
have got their snow, and the rest of us have colds.
It'll probably rain so hard now that they'll be con
ducting tours to the top of Hoover Libe with a diving I
bell. And if the sun is shining Wednesday morning
when this thing hits print don't bother running over j
to the Daily shack to tell me to drop dead.
Hell, I'm so otten wrong that I correct myself even
when I'm right.

for mile.
I suppose the cold spell also brought snow to the
mountains. And you don't need to invite Stanford j
students into the snow any more than I need "have
a drink" repeated a second time.
Every weekend now. anybody who can pry the j
staves off a barrel will be heading to Yosemite to
break their fool legs. I was going to learn to ski this
winter, but I guess 1 H let it slide. I said I was going
to learn to ski this winter, but I guess I'll let it slide.
I was going to learn to ski - - - hell, I know when I m
licked—it isn't going to get any better no matter how j
many times I repeat it.
Seriously though, I am a self-made skier, and it's
a wonderful example of unskilled labor
Well, anyway, I'm glad to see the change in the
weather. The farmers have got their rain, the skiers
have got their snow, and the rest of us have colds.
It'll probably rain so hard now that they'll be con
ducting tours to the top of Hoover Libe with a diving I
bell. And if the sun is shining Wednesday morning
when this thing hits print don't bother running over j
to the Daily shack to tell me to drop dead.
Hell, I'm so otten wrong that I correct myself even
when I'm right.
Well we finally got some rain.
I thought I was going to have to go all quarter
without being allowed to poke fun at California rain.
Now that we've had a little, and everyone has been
wanting it so badly it just doesn't seem right to harp
on the time worn story about the Oregon mist that
missed Oregon.
People have been standing around in groups
looking at the sky every time a cloud passed overhead,
but until recently they have all turned out to be
empties coming back from Utah and Nevada.
I guess the farmers really needed a little shower.
I heard one farmer say he had a bull frog on his ranch
that was two years old and had never learned to swim.
I was talking to an old friend of mine, Herman
Schmiddling, down in Los Angeles over the telephone
the other day. I told him that everyone up here was
praying for rain, and asked him how the weather was
down there. To which he replied:
"I don't know, it's so goddam foggy I can't tell.
I of course told him to hang up the phone and take
his damn smudge-pot with him.
The farmers aren't the only ones who profited by
the rain. I saw one enterprising young man on campus
collecting it in buckets and passing it off as cellar
coffee at five cents a cup. I bought two cups myself
before I noticed it was too strong to be cellar coffee.

I swear I could put a coffee bean in my mouth and
swim up the Mississippi turning out better coffee mile
for mile.
