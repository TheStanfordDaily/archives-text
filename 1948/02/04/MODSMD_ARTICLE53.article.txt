Without doubt the state of Illinois presents the most
irreconcilable conflict in all the country in the matter
of basic rights of citizens. Conflicting with liberty is
Illinois' unconcern and complete disregard for a right
so fundamental as the right of accused persons to be
represented at trials by counsel for their defense.
In this regard, there is no state in the Union which
lawyers, prosecutors, and judges certainly cannot be
proud of their record; shame would describe it much
better.
At the last term of the United States Supreme Court,
approximately 300 of about 500 cases that involved the
failure of an accused man to be given the right of
counsel were filed from Illinois. A rough estimate is
that almost* half of these were filed by inmates ol'
Illinois prisons who say that they were convicted
without defense counsel.
It is very difficult to state just what the rule of
the U.S. Supreme Court is with respect to right to
counsel. The high justices have refused to guarantee
it in such decisions as Betts vs. Brady (1942) and Foster
& Payne vs. Illinois (1947); on the other hand they
have stood by it in Tomkins vs. Missouri (1945) and
DeMeerleer vs. Michigan (1947)
The latest decision, in the Illinois case, left it to
the state in that instance at least to protect this basic
right. Since Illinois does not protect it to the extent of
advising defendants of their right to counsel, the safe
guard is denied time after time to those who do not
know of it.
Many states have in their state constitutions the
following paragraph in regard to the light of counsel:
If it appears to the court that the prisoner is mentally
unable to decide his need of counsel because of ignor

ance, feeble-mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, the
record should show the appointments and names of
counsel whether requested or nt.
An accused man gets no such protection in Illinois.
If he does not ask for counsel, the Illinois procedure
does not guarantee it for him. Illinois, in some of its
cases, makes it possible lor the trial court to appear
to avoid deliberately any mention of the defendant's
right to counsel.
How necessary is it that right to counsel be guar
anteed? The answer, in the way I see it, is that it is
the most basic of all rights of accused persons. Speedy
trial, trial by jury, protection against double jeopardy
and against cruel and unusual punishmenWall of
these can be of no possible avail if an innocent defend
ant lacks the guidance of counsel.
The late Justice Sutherland summed up the situa
tion very nicely when he said in the Powell vs. Ala
bama case: "Even the intelligent and educated lay
man lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately
to prepare his defense, even though he has a perfect
one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel in every
step in the proceedings against him Without it, though
he may not be guilty, he faces the danger of convic
tion because he does not knw how to establish his
innocence."
Yet in Illinois an accused person, no matter how
unlearned, can be sent to the penitentiary without
ever being told in court that he has the right to be
represented by counsel. I, for one, would like to know
where the laws are protecting the citizens of this
state? Where is the Illinois Bar Association? It cer
tainly appears that the Illinois legal system has gone
to the dogs.
