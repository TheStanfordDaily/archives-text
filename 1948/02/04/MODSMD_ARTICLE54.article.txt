## Answer to Dr. Kaupas 
### 
To The Editor:
Relative to the "missiles over Sweden—from the
German Baltic ports occupied by the Soviet armies
referred to by Mr. Kaupas in his letter in Tuesday s
Daily, the N. Y. Times carried the following from
Stockholm, Aug. 14, 1946: "Swedish military authorities
s;id today they had received no tangible proof that
the frequent celestial phenomena observed over Swed
en resulted from foreign experiments with aerial mis
sels. 'We have not found a thing,' a military spokes
man said.'
The alleged rockets were supposedly coming from
Soviet-occupied Peencmunde, Nazi Germany's main
research and testing station in this field Last summer,
Mi-. Jack Raymond of the N. Y. Times was Riven, said
the San Francisco Chronicle: "free run of the ruin.
Peenemunde was just that — Peenemunde's steel
launching platforms, concrete tunnels and huge mys
terious structures ('as large as New York's Grand
Central Terminal') were a shambles. Raymond decid
ed that Russia had never used Peenemunde for rocket
launching or research: 'The destruction here is too
complete. The wreckage is too old."
Mr. Kaupas' charges against Edward Hallett Carr
in his letter in Monday's Daily were no more accurate
than his rocket data. Mr. Carr simply did not say
most of the things that Mr Kaupas ascribes to him.
Persons interested in pursuing the matter further may
compare Mr. Kaupas' letter with the reports of Mr.
Can's address in the Daily and the Palo Alto Times
of which the latter was particularly complete.
As for Mr. C; it's being a "promoter of Bolshevism
and a "British Stalin associate," Mr. Kaupas should
certainly place his information in this respect at the
disposal of the U. S. Immigration Service, Dept. ol
Justice, and-particularly the State Department, which
has been so careful to bar such persons from this
country that Brazil's leading architect, who designed
the future permanent home of the United Nations in

Now York, has been barred from entering this country
at the invitation of Harvard's school of architecture,
because of his Red affiliations.
The London Times, for which Mr. Carr wrote many
of its most important wartime editorials on foreign
policy, the British Foreign Office, in which Mr. Can
served for 20 years under the administrations of all
three parties; University College of Wales in which he
is now a professor; and the professors in all English
speaking lands who have assigned Mr Carr s The
Soviet Impact on the Western World" as required
reading, would all. 1 am sure, also be interested in the
sources of Mr. Kaupas' information. Needless to say,
his description of Soviet foreign policy was as accur
ate as his atatck on Professor Carr.
