# To Hell with '51
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We read yesterday the feeble whimpering of the
so-called class of '51, and we appreciate the tact that
they need a release from their pent up frustrations
and fears, but we feel that we would rather not sur
render at this early date.
We are sorry that you had to go out and hire 11
women to represent your squad in the football game
Friday, and although our men will probably have more
trouble with the females than they would have had
against your regulars, we promise to be nice about the
whole affair and only trample you until you can't move.
Referring to your comment on sophomore beards,
you must not know that Sam Goldwyn has wired
Carlos Brown and his six bearded sophs to come to
Holy wood to star in his next picture—The Jungle Story.
The rest of the things you little ones need to know
will be taught to you this weekend when the sopho
mores show you how to work on Jamboree Day.
Now. sweetly and sincerely we say, "To Hell with
•51." JOHN HALL; PAUL ELWOOD.
