# Village Christian Club Reorganizes Activities
## 
### DEBBY WELLES 
Several weekends ago a
group of Stanford and Cal men
and women, together with As
sociate Chaplain Gale W. En
gle, met at the Hidden Villa
youth hostle camp at Los Altos for
a weekend discussion of aims, or
ganization, and resources of a new
group in Stanford Village. Out of
their meeting has been formed an
ofTcially renovated Village Christian
Association
"We seek to discover," the con
ference declared, "by searching
within ourselves, by studying the
teachings of Jesus, by group associa
tion and interchange of ideas, a
way of living which is in line with
Truth and which has meaning for
us."
The newly formed organization,
which will seek Excom approval of
its activities as soon as its constitu
tion has been formulated, elected as
its president, Lawrence Bott, as vice
president Sanford Wilbourn, secre
tary Lois Baker, and treasurer Dave
Col burn.
FUTURE PLANS
For a just-getting-on-its-feet
campus organization, it has 'a big
program already under way, and an
even more ambitious one in line for
the future.
Three active committees have
been formed: the first on Christian
Faith and Heritage, headed by Joe
Wray; the second on world friend
ship and peace, headed by Leland
Auslender; the third, social and
community responsibility, with Dave
Diefenderfer as chairman.
Of the three, the last has managed
to get under way a program of com
munity and local action, while the
other two have planned programs
for the future, including a discussion
group on the teachings of Christ,
now meeting every Sunday night.
YMCA GROUP
In the field of social and commun
ity service, several activities have
been initiated and seem to be flour
ishing. Lan Murray is in charge of a
sixth and seventh grade YMCA
group. Rose Klempf is acting as as
sistant leader for an 11th grade girls'
club at the Palo Alto High school.
One of the plans to promote racial
tolerance and well-being is that of
the formation of a young peoples'
group at the M. E. Zion Church,
headed by Dave Diefenderfer and
Goidon Yeh.
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the program is Lois Baker's
field of working with the blind
through the National Transcribers'
Society for the Blind, many inter
ested students are signing up to
read aloud while a blind person
translates the literature into braille
for future circulation. Tentative
plans are being made for nursery
school work with six blind children.
ANOTHER SCHEME
Last weekend marked the begin
nings of another scheme, which has
been used by the Quakers in their
relief programs. Weekend work
camps in the future, as last week
end, will find no limitation on their
fiields of activity.
The first project began in Red
wood City, where, with the aid of
10 Farm students, a family home,
on which its owner has already

worked for over a year, was brought
several steps nearer completion.
A program of folk-dancing will
begin at the Village Clubhouse some
time in the future.
SCHOOL SERVICE
As a general school service, the
Christian Association hopes to begin
a Big Brother program for incom
ing Village freshmen.
Discussion groups, sponsored by
the World Peace and the Christian
Faith committees, will be a contin
uation and an expansion of programs
held last quarter under the auspices
of the old association.
The committee on world peace
expects in particular to sponsor a
series of talks on Russia and our
relations to that country, both by
Russian and American authorities.
The Christian Faith committee has
already begun a Sunday evening
series.
MANY JOBS
"There are still many jobs to be
done," chairman Larry Bott stated.
"For instance, the Christian Asso
ciation is building its own chapel in
the Village for lack of other accom
modations We hope that eventually
our projects and discussion groups
will be of such scope and variety as
to interest every Village resident."
Chaplain Engle was no less en
thusiastic and hopeful.
"The Christian Association enter
price is developed by students and
for students," he said. "If it can serve
the purpose of reinterpreting the
Christian view and if it can direct
the energies of these people toward
useful moral, social, and religious
activity, it will have justified itself."
