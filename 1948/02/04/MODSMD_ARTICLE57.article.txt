# German Workers Strike for Food

### 
FRANKFURT. Germany, Feb. 3
(UP). â€”An estimated 1,300,000 Ger
man workers stayed away from their
jobs in the American and British
zones today in a one-day protest
against near-starvation diets. Only
one demonstration was held and it
was orderly.
The United States-occupied state
of Wuerttemberg-Baden was hard
hit, with 600.000 on strike. Ail in
dustries, newspapers, schools, and
most shops were closed down in
Stuttgart, the state capital.
U.S. Military Governor Gen. Lu
cius D. Clay, speaking at a meeting
of the German Council of States at
Stuttgart, warned that "Strikes can
not get you any more food. They
succeed only in slowing production
and retarding your own recovery."
At Hannover in the British zone,
going through its second one-day
strike, 100.000 were out. The strike
spread to ore mines near Salzgitter
and oil fields around Celle, where
40.000 more were idle.
In all cases the strikes were for
higher food rations and for more
efficient and equitable distribution
of food and consumer goods.
