### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UP) —
Soft coal operators said tonight they
arc prepared for a showdown over
John L. Lewis' threat to call a strike
of his United Mine Workers unless
they get $100 a month pensions.
Lewis served notice yesterday
that he regarded the dispute as na
tional in character, and said his
union reserves the right "at will to
take any independent action neces
sary to the enforcement of the con
tract."
The operators, he said, have im
peded fulfillment of the 1047 wage
contract to pay pensions from a wel
fare fund raised by a 10 cents a ton
levy on all coal mined.
In their first public comment on
the move, the operators said Lewis
could interpret his notice as the start
of the (50-day period for termination
of the current agreement. This
would pose the threat of a walkout
the first week of April.
The producers made it clear that
they have no intention of yielding
to Lewis pension demand until he
first complies with their demand
for establishment of the $50,000,000
welfare and retirement fund in ac
cordance with the trust laws.
