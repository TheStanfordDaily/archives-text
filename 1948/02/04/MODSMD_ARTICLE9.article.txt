# Soviet Costs High; Construction Lags

### 
MOSCOW, Feb. 3 (UP). —The
budget committees of the Supreme
Soviet (Parliament) sharply criti
cized inefficiency in Soviet govern
ment and industry today, charging
that costs were far above planned
levels, while housing construction
was lagging behind.
Financial experts in the Council
of Nationalities (lower house) fo
cused their attack on uneconomical
methods in industry and excessive
costs in local government, which
they said were "wasting millions of
rubles."
The budget committee of the
Council of the Union (upper house)
emphasized the failure of key in
dustries and government ministries
to complete their housing quotas.
A Moscow deputy charged that
housing constuction in the Soviet
capital was "developing very slow
ly," and a delegate from the great
Baltic port of Leningrad said that
building there was "unsatisfactory."
I. S. Khokhlov, chairman of the
Council of Nationalities' committee
on expenditures, cited the coal and
railway industries as specific ex
amples of extravagance.
He charged that western Russian
coal producers spent 84,000,000 ru
bles (about $1(5,800,000 at the offi
cial rate) for industrial expenses
during the first 11 months of 1947,
pushing the cost of a ton of coal
over the planned figure.
In eastern Russia, he said, the
per-ton cost of coal rose 2.85 rubles
(57 cents) during the same period.
Khokhlov said that railroads fell
000,000.000 rubles ($120,000,000)
j short of planned revenues during
I the past two years, while using
0,000.000 tons of coal above their
quota—causing "large losses in the
j exploitation of ailway transport."
