# STUDENTS AWAIT LARGER CHECKS
## Vet Subsidies Bill Moves To White Mouse for Okay 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (UP)â€”lncreased subsidies for GI stud
ents were almost certain to be forthcoming as a bill raising
monthly government checks for veteran students cleared its
last hurdle in the House yesterday and now awaits President
Truman's signature. The bill was passed by the Senate last year. ,

More than 2,000,000 veterans will
be affected by the legislation which
will increase monthly checks from
$05 to $75 for single Gl's, from $90
to $105 for those with wives, and
from $90 to $120 for those with more
than one dependent.
House amendments to a compan
ion bill raising the income ceilings
at which veterans become ineligible
for subsistence allowance under the
GI educational and training pro
gram were rejected by the Senate
today.
The measure now goes to confer
ence for adjustment of the differ
ences between the House and Sen
ate versions.
The subsistence-ceiling bill also
was passed by the Senate last sum
mer but was revised by the House
yesterday.
Under the present set-up, GI job
trainees, students and farm trainees
cannot collect government subsist
ence allowances if their monthly in
comes are $175 or more for a single
veteran and $200 or more for those
with dependents.
The ceiling bill includes about
530,000 veterans who are taking on-
Ihe-job training, in addition to the
students and farm trainees.
