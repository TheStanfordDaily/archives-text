# Alpine Club Plans Climb Up Pinnacle
## 
### 
Qualified members of the Stan
ford Alpine Club will climb in Pin
nacles National Monument over the
weekend, weather permitting.
Transportation, times of depar
ture and return, and climbing ar
rangements must be arranged indi
vidually, Larry Taylor said.
"The cruddy nature of the rock
demands extreme caution; each
rope team should have at least one
experienced climber," he added.
