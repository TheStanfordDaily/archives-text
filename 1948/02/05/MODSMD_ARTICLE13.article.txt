# Skyline Snow Draws Crowds
## 
### H.R. KLAUSER 
It isn't, often that Farm students
have snow practically on their
doorstep, but that was the case early
this week in the first lew days of
j the current storm.
Snow fell all along the Skyline
Boulevard, but was best near the
Big Basin area. Depth ran as high
: as a foot and a half in intermittent
i areas.
Most of the enthusiasts were just
j out "to see snow," but several hopc
; fuls took their skis along. Reports
j varied from "fair" to "impossible."
The non - skiers had to confine
themselves to snowballing and the
| making of snow men. For some it
was the first, time in the snow, but
their enthusiasm ranged all the way
| from a naive "What cold stuff!" to
a jubilant "Never had so much fun!"
First notice of the snow was given
| by a small but well - constructed
; snowman on the Phi Delta Thcta
j lawn.
Even with so heavy a blanket
close to home, snow-starved Stan
ford skiers are eagerly awaiting re
j ports that the present storm will be
I sufficient to provide the year's first
good skiing.
