# Row Houses To Vote Aid
## Year Minimum For 6 Europeans 
### 
Within the next two weeks
each of the Farm's 24 fraterni
ties will make a decision on the
tentative plan for granting schol
arships to European students as
outlined by Bob Coate before the
Intrafraternity Council last Tuesday.
Each fraternity will be contacted
by either Coate or Jim Welch, Inter
fraternity Council president, and
given a resume of what adoption of
the plan entails. I
The general goal is to supply six
European students with room, board
and spending money for a minimum
of one year at Stanford with the
ultimate purpose of endoctrinating
these students into the American ;
way of life, according to Coate.
GENERAL AIMS
The plan is an attempt to give ef- |
feet to the statement of principle ;
recently formulated by the Stanford
Committee on Emergency European :
Scholarships.
A copy of that statement follows:
"It is assumed that Stanford Uni
versity stands in a position to aid
actively in the furthering of mutual j
understanding between the United !
States and those European countries j
which today have no valid means of
learning about our democracy.
"One of the most important aids is
the actual bringing of foreign stud- j
jents to Stanford University. The Ad- !
j ministration desires to cooperate to'
the extent of extending scholarship
■facilities to these foreign students
within bounds feasible under the ed
\ ucational purposes of the University. J
WANT LEADERS
i "What is desired is a representa
tive group of student leaders from !
I continental Europe. The nomination
land selection of these students can I
i be accomplished by combinations of;
| these facilities: European universi-
I lies, U. S. State Department cultur- j
:al attaches, Stanford men now in
; Europe and Stanford men who will
i be in Europe, and the European Se
] minar Project to be held this sum- I
| mer.
"The final selection will rest with
I Stanford University through a com-!
( mittee combining the Dean, the Reg- I
| istrar, and several students.
NEW VENTURE
"It will be through the coopera-
I tion of the entire University that this
project can succeed, and as Stanford !
has long pioneered in the field of j
i international relations, and as there i
is reasonable assurance that success j
I here will mean widespread accept- 1
; ance of this type of project among !
| other universities, it is hoped that
iall individuals and groups will con- '
j sider the matter.
"Stanford stands ready to take the
I lead in a venture which, on a large
I scale, will be gravely important in
| world relations."

WANT LEADERS
i "What is desired is a representa
tive group of student leaders from !
I continental Europe. The nomination
land selection of these students can I
i be accomplished by combinations of;

I lies, U. S. State Department cultur- j

; Europe and Stanford men who will
i be in Europe, and the European Se

"The final selection will rest with
I Stanford University through a com-!
( mittee combining the Dean, the Reg- I
| istrar, and several students.
NEW VENTURE
"It will be through the coopera-
I tion of the entire University that this
project can succeed, and as Stanford !
has long pioneered in the field of j
i international relations, and as there i
is reasonable assurance that success j
I here will mean widespread accept- 1

iall individuals and groups will con- '

808 COATE, Phi Gamma Delta
president, lias outlined the Euro
pean scholarships plan before the
Intcrfratcrnity Council.
Within the next two weeks
each of the Farm's 24 fraterni
ties will make a decision on the
tentative plan for granting schol
arships to European students as
outlined by Bob Coate before the
Intrafraternity Council last Tuesday.
Each fraternity will be contacted
by either Coate or Jim Welch, Inter
fraternity Council president, and
given a resume of what adoption of
the plan entails. I
The general goal is to supply six
European students with room, board
and spending money for a minimum
of one year at Stanford with the
ultimate purpose of endoctrinating
these students into the American ;
way of life, according to Coate.
GENERAL AIMS
The plan is an attempt to give ef- |
feet to the statement of principle ;
recently formulated by the Stanford
Committee on Emergency European :
Scholarships.
