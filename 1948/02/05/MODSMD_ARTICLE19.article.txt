# Weekend to Bring Moonlight Cruise, 'No-Date' Dance, Row Open Houses
## 
### 
Four hours of dancing will fea
ture records and rcfeshments Sat
urday from 9 to 1 as four "top-of-
I,he-Row fraternities invite campus
couples for party time.
Extracting the theme from the
old Greek maxim "A(-)i)«I»TE!NTAA,"
the fraternities Delta Tau Delta,
Theta Xi, Sigma Nu, and Phi Gam
ma Delta promise to show the cam
pus a really fine time.
"There will be plenty of room,"
assured Dave Saunders, Delt social
chairman. "Come early, stay late—
and bring your own date."
The affair initiates the new on
campus social program suggested by
Guyla Runyon, ASSU vice - presi
dent. "The fraternities are all for
it," commented Bob Coate, Fiji
president. "If we get a good turn
out for this first session, the fra
ternities plan to continue the series
on each weekend for the remainder
of the quarter."
"You really can't afford not to
come," averred Bob McKim, Theta
Xi social chairman. "Everything is
free, you have four houses to cir
culate in, and the fraternities arc
knocking themselves out to show
you a really fine on-campus time."
"What's more," concurred Bob
Longwell, Sigma Nu social chair
man, "the affair offers non-fratcr
nity men an excellent opportunity
of seeing what the fraternities look
'ike on the inside. We're especially
interested in seeing a lot of men
from the Village attend."


GUYLA IIUNVAN, ASSU vicc
president, suggested a new on
campus social program.
