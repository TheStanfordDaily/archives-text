# STANFORD PLAYERS
## 'Wintered' Is Well Received 
### JACK LITTLE 
The opening performance of the
Stanford Players' production of
"Wintersct" was very well received
last night by an audience which
filled the Little Theater to capacity
and demanded no less than four
curtain calls.
Maxwell Anderson's prize-winning
play, one of the greatest of the mod
ern tragedies, was presented with
intelligence and understanding on
the part of all players. The produc
tion throughout is a credit, to the
superb directing abilities of Betty
McGee, who also designed the un
usually effective sets.
"Winterset," although not quite
measuring up to the Players' pro
fessional presentation of "Richard
III" last fall, is certainly one of the
outstanding productions Stanford
has seen in recent years.
TOP HONORS
John Hume, as the vengeful and
bitter Mio, carried through a diffi
cult role to come out with top honors
for the evening. He demonstrated
an almost unwavering command of
his part—convincing in every re
spect. At times his work bordered
on brilliancy, showing great im
provement over his earlier work
with the Players.
Nancy DeGroot also turned in a
fine performance as Miriamne, the
lovely girl who finds herself torn
between love for her brother and
love for the man who represents her
brother's downfall. Miss DeGroot is
consistently superb, and as Miriamne
she turned in one of her best per
formances to date.
Angus Bowmer, a newcomer to the
Players, showed himself to be an
impressive addition to Stanford
drama in his portrayal of Esdras,
Miriamne's venerable father. His
acting left little to be desired and
held the tangible polish of exper
ience. We hope to see him in a big
ger role—one which will afford his
talents more elbow room.
INDISPUTABLE TALENTS
William Melton as Judge Gaunt,
q nd Jules Irving as Garth provided
further proof of their indisputable
talents, and Harry Muheirn, another
newcomer to ranks of Farm actors,
impressed with a convincing per
formance.
Allen Fletcher and Hal Todd were
wholly capable as usual, but we
were sorry to see Ruth Fisher, who
proved her worth in "Richard III"
and "A Prayer in Galilee," submerg
ed in a trivial role. Tch. Tch.

TOP HONORS
John Hume, as the vengeful and
bitter Mio, carried through a diffi
cult role to come out with top honors
for the evening. He demonstrated
an almost unwavering command of
his part—convincing in every re
spect. At times his work bordered
on brilliancy, showing great im
provement over his earlier work
with the Players.
Nancy DeGroot also turned in a
fine performance as Miriamne, the
lovely girl who finds herself torn
between love for her brother and
love for the man who represents her
brother's downfall. Miss DeGroot is
consistently superb, and as Miriamne
she turned in one of her best per
formances to date.
Angus Bowmer, a newcomer to the
Players, showed himself to be an
impressive addition to Stanford
drama in his portrayal of Esdras,
Miriamne's venerable father. His
acting left little to be desired and
held the tangible polish of exper
ience. We hope to see him in a big
ger role—one which will afford his
talents more elbow room.
INDISPUTABLE TALENTS
William Melton as Judge Gaunt,
q nd Jules Irving as Garth provided
further proof of their indisputable
talents, and Harry Muheirn, another
newcomer to ranks of Farm actors,
impressed with a convincing per
formance.
Allen Fletcher and Hal Todd were
wholly capable as usual, but we
were sorry to see Ruth Fisher, who
proved her worth in "Richard III"
and "A Prayer in Galilee," submerg
ed in a trivial role. Tch. Tch.
