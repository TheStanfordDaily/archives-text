The last hands fell Tuesday night ... At the end of four
weeks of competition, the Stanford Bridge Club has produced
a group of eight winners to compete for national duplicate bridge
laurels.
Tuesday's winners, Douglas Mackey and Charles Olsen, com-

plete this list which already had in

bert Hawk, and John S. White, win
ners on the three previous Tuesdays.
The cards will fall on February 17,
when the eight Stanfordites will play
In re with the nationally-provided
hands. During that same week 163
other college groups will be working
on the same hands. Following these
separate sessions, the hands will be

to be analyzed and graded.
The Culbertson expert will then

finalists will receive a free trip to
Chicago in April to compete in the
playoffs.
Next week the local "cards" will
try their "hand" at playing some of

Tuesday is invited. "Also," stated
Howard Shomate, bridge club presi- j
dent, "the public is free to play the
hands sent out for the national tour
nament on February 17. However,
visitors will naturally play these
hands in their own separate groups." j
