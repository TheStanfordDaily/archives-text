# Tree to Be Moved To Amphitheater
## 
### 
Carroll Blacker, Superintendent
of Buildings and Grounds, last week
announced that the Corporation
Yard will soon be ready to trans
plant an oak tree from its former
position near the Museum to a new
spot on a platform just to the side
of the Frost Amphitheater stage.
He said that the Yard had re
cently removed an oversized oak
from this spot and that the new
tree was quite a bit smaller than
(lie old.
