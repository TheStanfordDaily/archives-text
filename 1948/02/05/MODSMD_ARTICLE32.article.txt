# Discrimination Against Minorities One of America's Biggest Problems

Editor's note: This is the second
in a series of three articles spon
sored by the Daily to foster an
awareness of the danger among
Stanford students of accepting as
a self-perpetuating thing the close
association between our country
and such terms as tolerance, equal
ity. and freedom. Material not en
closed in parentheses has been tak
en verbatim from the report of
the President's Committee on Civ
il Rights.

In private business, in gov
ernment, and in labor unions,
the war years saw a marked ad
vance in the removal of on-the
job discriminatory practices.

,Yet we did not eliminate discrim
j ination in employment.
Discrimination is most acutely felt
| by minority group members in their
! inability to get a job suited to their
I qualifications. If he can get himself
hired, the minority worker often
I finds that he is being paid loss than
j other workers.
A case study, conducted in one
[government agency by the National
Committee on Segregation in the
Nation's Capital, demonstrates a pat

PREJUDICE IN JOBS
This at once calls to question the
effectiveness of the Civil Service
Commission rules against such dis
: crimination, and the various depart
-1 ments' directives and executive or
ders that have restated this policy of
non-discrimination from time to time.

There is a danger that some of our
wartime gains in the elimination of
unfair employment practices will be
lost unless prompt action is taken
to preserve them.
The United States has made re
markable progress towards the goal
of universal education for its peo
ple. The number and variety of its
schools and colleges are greater than
ever before. Student bodies have
become increasingly representative
of all the different peoples who make
up our population. Yet we have not
finally eliminated prejudice and.
discrimination from (he operation
of either our public or our private
schools and colleges.
Two inadequacies are extremely
serious. We have failed to provide
Negroes and, to a lesser extent, oth
er minority group members with
equality of educational opportuni
ties in our public institutions.
(One) inadequacy in our present
educational practices in America is
the religious and racial discrimina
tion that exists in the operation of
some private educational institu
tion:, both with respect to the ad
mission of students and the treat
ment of them after admission.
DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOLS
The committee is absolutely con
vinced of the importance of the pri
vate educational institution to a free
society. It does not question the right
of groups of private citizens to es
tablish such institutions, determine
their character and policies, and
operate them. But it does believe
that such schools immediately ac
quire a public character and import
ance. Consequently, they are pos
sessed of a public responsibility from
which there is no escape.
Application blanks of many Am
erican colleges and universities in
clude questions pertaining to the
candidate's racial origin, religious
preference, parents' birthplace, etc.
In maay of our modern educational
institutions enrollment of Jewish
students seems never to exceed Cer
tain fixed points and there is never
more than a token enrollment of
Negroes.
PUBLIC DENIEL TALENT
The failure to give Negroes equal
educational opportunities is natur
ally most acute in the South. Willi
respect to education, as well as to
other public services, the committee
believes that the "separate but
equal" rule has not been obeyed in
practice.
Certainly the public cannot long
tolerate practices by educational in
stitutions which are in serious con
flict with patterns of democratic life,
sanctioned by the overwhelming ma
jority of our people. By the closing
of the door through bigotry and
prejudice to equality of educational
opportunity, the public is denied the
manifold social and economic bene
fits that the talented individual might
otherwise contribute to our society.
