### 

Southpaw MORLKY THOMPSON makes good use of his left hand as he goes up for a lay-in in the game
between Stanford and University of San Francisco last Saturday. For Morlcy it was the first action since
tiie C'al contests as he was laid out with the flu. Caught almost I'latfoated on the play is Jack "Tatoos" Han
ley (14). John Bennington (4) makes a vain effort to stop the proceedings as George Carver (10) is ready
lor the rebound. â€”Photo bv Howard Garnick
