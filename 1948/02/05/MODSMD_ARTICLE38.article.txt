# Rugby Men Ready For Winged 'O'
## 
### 
When the Olympic Club ruggers
invade Stanford next Saturday, they
will be bringing with them one of
the finest rugby outfits in the Bay
area. So far this season they have
had only two matches, but both
were won with ease, and the Olym
pic men are still improving.
Their victories were gained against
the University Club and the usually
good Petaluma squad. They figure to
add the Cards to their list.
j Dave Brown, end on last year's
football team and now playing rugby
for the Olympic Club, is one of their
leading threats. Big Dave is rough,
has lots of drive, and is being count
ed upon to score regularly Saturday
afternoon.
FAY TO PLAY
Another former Stanford football
er who will be wearing an Olympic
Club jersey against the Cards is Pete
Fay. Pete was an outstanding back
several years ago, and is a tough
customer to contend with on the
! rugby field. .
Realizing that they have a hard
! schedule in front of them, the In
j dian ruggers have been working,ov
j ertime trying to round into shape,
I but yesterday's rain cut into their
! practice session.
The loss of A 1 Morris, Bob Lindsay
! and Dick Hughes, has also been a
i bad break for the Cards, and as a
! result they have been slow to reach
[ top form.
Saturday's match will be a good
I test for the ruggers, as they look
forward to coming games with UCLA
and California.
