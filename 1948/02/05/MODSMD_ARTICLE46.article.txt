# Father Time Catches Yanks

SAN FRANCISCO. Fob. 4 (UP)
Joe DiMaggio has only three good
I years of baseball left, the New York
Yankees are in a state of decline
' and will have nearly all new faces
' in <wo or three years, Yankee Scout
Joe Devine predicted today.
Talking to a group of young Yan
kee prospects who will serve as
! farmhands or with the parent club
during the IiJ4S season, Devine said:
"Joe Dilvlaggio has only three
more years of top-flight baseball at
the best; Tommy Henreich only I wo,
and most of the rest of the members
of our world championship team are
slipping.
"I look to see all new faces in the
Yankee lineup by 1950 or shortly
thereafter.
AI L CAL TEAM?
"I wouldn't be surprised to see an
! all-California outfield, an all-Cali
fornia infield and an all-California
catching staff on the Yankees by
| that time."
Devine singled out a flock of the
| youngsters he expected to become
regular Yankees. These included
first baseman Fenton Mole, a long
ball hitter with tremendous shoul
ders and great wrist power, who was
with Beaumont in the Texas League
last year and will play with Port
land this season; infielder Jerry
Coleman, a pre-maturely bald ball
handling wizard from Kansas City.
! and catcher Charley Silvera, cocky
' little receiver who backstopped for
Portland in 1947, both of whom will
get chances with the Yanks this year.
NO, NO, NO, MAN
lie named Carl Deßose, 235-pound
, giant who was the hero of thai no
hit, no-run. no-man-reached-first
i at Kansas City in 1947 —hurled with
| a sore arm on a "last chance" basis;
pitcher Bill Wight, who gets a
chance at the big time this year;

outfielder Johnny Hooper, son of
famed Ilarry Hooper of the cham
pionship Boston Red Sox, who
climbed from the Class B. Victoria,
8.C., club cf the Western Interna
tional League to Newark this year
as men on the way up.
MAPES OF L A.
ClifT Ma pes. a slugging outfielder
from Los Angeles who made good
with Kansas City last year, also gets
a shot at the Yank lineup ibis year
—and Devine expects him to stick
with the champs.
"In my 2G years of scouting for
baseball, I've never seen such op
portunities as there are today," 'De
vine said. "The average age of play
ers in the Majors increased during
the war and these old-timers will
have to make way for a flock of
youngsters in the next two or three
years.
"Some of our crop of rookies will
never reach the Majors. But every
lad we've signed has been investi
gated tor personality, character and
spirit—besides his ball playing abil
ity.
"If they don't make the Majors
as ball players, they'll probably wind
up as managers, business managers
or club owners."
