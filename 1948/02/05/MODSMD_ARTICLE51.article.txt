## UMT Discussion 
### 
To the Editor:
The one-sided write-up on Tuesday's UMT dis
cussion was hardly fair to the excellent speakers, the
audience, a sizeable portion of which was anti-UMT,
and many people who were unable to attend due to
attending the Tuesday series.
The case presented was one too infrequently con
sidered by our fearful world: Is there any assurance,
particularly at the present time, that military pre
paredness is security against war? Has not history
shown that if you prepare for war you get war?
Naturally people are right in saying at this point
what is the alternative? There is a definite positive
alternative. From somewhere must start a trend to
ward laying aside fear and objectively searching out
the causes of war with a willingness to deal with them
honestly. The search to arrive at the truth, and spread
it, should be the objective; and threats must be dis
pensed with because they prevent clear insights.
Because this has occurred nowhere, each one of us
is qually responsible for the present predicament.
No one claims that herein lies absolute guarantee
against war's occurrence. No plan can claim that.
But the only feasible road to peace lies on the side

of forbearance, understanding, production, meeting of !
the need. The statistics presented showed that the
cost of UMT would build hospitals, schools, and junior
colleges in every county in the United States, and
provide many other services besides. Surely there is
no country in the world which would not preferably j
stop the flow of money down wasteful military chan
nels and divert it for terrifically needed reconstruc
tion for peace.
