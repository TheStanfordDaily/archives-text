# Good Reporting?

To the Editor:
Re the news story in The Daily of Jan. 28 on UMT
forum ... is it good reporting to report only one
side of the question? ....
W. H. LOHANS.
(Editor's note: The story in question was complete
as written. Both sides of the question were adequate
ly reported. However, as is sometimes the case
with late stories (i.e. stories written after 8 p.m.)
it became necessary to leave off the last few para
graphs in order to fit the story into the page. This
is common newspaper practice and if it changes the
objectivity of the reporting it is unintentional).
