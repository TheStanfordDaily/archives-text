# Contact Committee Organized by 'Y'
## 
### 
A Public Relations Committee is
being organized by the YWCA,
under the chairmanship of Sally
Brown, so that all organizations and
individuals will have a direct con
tact with the "Y."
The committee will hold regular
office hours. In this way, anyone
who has a request to make of the
"Y" may be sure that her request
will be presented to the "Y" cabinet.
"We want every woman on cam
pus to feel that she Ls a part of the

'Y,' and that her requests are im
portant to the 'Y'," Miss Brown said.
There will be four members on
the committee, Charlene Baker,
Jackie Milnor, Miss Brown, and a
fourth to be chosen by the cabinet.
Miss Brown and Peg Milnor will
hold interviews for this fourth po
sition this afternoon, and tomorrow
afternoon in the "Y" rooms. Any
woman on campus with a "C" aver
age is eligible. Previous "Y" expe
rience is not necessary.
