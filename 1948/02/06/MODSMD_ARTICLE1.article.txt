# Conference to Evaluate Women's Housing Plans Suggested for Next Year
## 
### 
Evaluation of the present housing plan and possible adoption
of a new plan at the end of the year was brought up at Women's
Conference yesterday by Nancy Bannick, Housing Committee
chairman.
Alternative housing plans suggested include the shuffle plan,
in which there would be a complete ♦ —

turnover of rooms every two years,
the group plan, in which every two
years a small co-op house would ex
change residences with a group in
a dorm; and the class plan, with
segregation of classes into areas.
This matter was brought up, Miss
Bannick said, to find out the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the
present plan, and see whether the
various complaints against it are
valid.
IJASIC IDEAS
Basic ideas in any plan as agreed
upon by Housing Committee are as
follows:
Opportunity for adjusting in new
situations, security, worry not out
of proportion to other things, ac
quaintance of various thought
groups, possibility of developing a
distinctive unity and spirit in each
house, taking advantage of differ
ences, equal desirability of living
groups, and compromise between
freedom of choice and regimenta
tion.
Criticisms against the present plan
were stagnation in one particular
area, unequal desirability of various
living areas, advantages of all fa
cilities not fully used, and the fact
that a girl seldom gets her first or
even second choice when she draws
for a room.
FREEDOM OF CHOICE
However, the present plan gives
a large amount of freedom of choice
to the girls, for they can move if
they want to. Miss Bannick said.
In the shuffle plan, the present
plan would continue, but every room
would be declared vacant at the
end of every two years, thereby
making every girl move. Eliminating
stagnation in one area, plan would
affect a girl at the end of either her
sophomore or junior year. Intermed
iate drawings would continue under
class preferences as in the present:
»plan, the ratio system would be used
for the shuffle system.
(iROUP PLAN
In the group plan, a freshmen
would draw into a particular group
of girls rather than to a living group
and would move with these girls
every two years. She could draw
from one to another group if she
wanted to.
For instance, suppose a freshman
drew into a particular Row house
that was moving the next year into
a Lagunita casa. She and her group
would spend their sophomore and
junior years in Lagunita and then
would return to the original Row
house for their senior year.
Under the class plan, classes would
be divided so that freshmen lived
in Roble and Branner, sophomores
and juniors together in Lagunita and
Union Unit, and seniors on the Row.
These divisions are not set; classes
and areas could be divided differ
ently. This way every girl would ex
perience the three different types
of living groups.

Bannick said, to find out the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the
present plan, and see whether the
various complaints against it are
valid.
IJASIC IDEAS
Basic ideas in any plan as agreed
upon by Housing Committee are as
follows:
Opportunity for adjusting in new
situations, security, worry not out
of proportion to other things, ac
quaintance of various thought
groups, possibility of developing a
distinctive unity and spirit in each
house, taking advantage of differ
ences, equal desirability of living
groups, and compromise between
freedom of choice and regimenta
tion.
Criticisms against the present plan
were stagnation in one particular
area, unequal desirability of various
living areas, advantages of all fa
cilities not fully used, and the fact
that a girl seldom gets her first or
even second choice when she draws
for a room.
FREEDOM OF CHOICE
However, the present plan gives
a large amount of freedom of choice
to the girls, for they can move if
they want to. Miss Bannick said.
In the shuffle plan, the present
plan would continue, but every room
would be declared vacant at the
end of every two years, thereby
making every girl move. Eliminating
stagnation in one area, plan would
affect a girl at the end of either her
sophomore or junior year. Intermed
iate drawings would continue under
class preferences as in the present:
»plan, the ratio system would be used
for the shuffle system.
(iROUP PLAN
In the group plan, a freshmen
would draw into a particular group
of girls rather than to a living group
and would move with these girls
every two years. She could draw
from one to another group if she
wanted to.
For instance, suppose a freshman
drew into a particular Row house
that was moving the next year into
a Lagunita casa. She and her group
would spend their sophomore and
junior years in Lagunita and then
would return to the original Row
house for their senior year.
Under the class plan, classes would
be divided so that freshmen lived
in Roble and Branner, sophomores
and juniors together in Lagunita and
Union Unit, and seniors on the Row.
These divisions are not set; classes
and areas could be divided differ
ently. This way every girl would ex
perience the three different types
of living groups.
Evaluation of the present housing plan and possible adoption
of a new plan at the end of the year was brought up at Women's
Conference yesterday by Nancy Bannick, Housing Committee
chairman.
Alternative housing plans suggested include the shuffle plan,
in which there would be a complete ♦ —

turnover of rooms every two years,
the group plan, in which every two
years a small co-op house would ex
change residences with a group in
a dorm; and the class plan, with
segregation of classes into areas.
This matter was brought up, Miss
Bannick said, to find out the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the
present plan, and see whether the
various complaints against it are
valid.
