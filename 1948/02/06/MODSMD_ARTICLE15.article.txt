# EXCOM REVIEW
## SIRO Work May Be Handled Cheaper by National Group 
### B.J. DENNING 
Wednesday night Excom
voted 7-6 to abolish the Stan
ford International Relief Or
ganization handling relief on an
individual basis.
Last year Excom granted
SIRO $800 to cover the costs of mail
ing relief packages overseas, wrap
ping and postage, for four quarters,
$200 per quarter. Now that $800 has
nearly all been used, and there are
packages wrapped and addressed,
ready to be mailed. Molly Shaw, co
chairman of SIRO. estimated th?t
it would cost between $500 and $f>oo
to continue mailing packages through
spring quarter as they have been
doing.
Student Manager Gene Mitguard
questioned whether the relief could
not be carried out more econom
ically by a larger group set up to

do such work on a'national or
international scale, such as the
American Red Cross, or the Am
erican Friends Service Committee.
He suggested that Stanford con
tinue to collect the clothing, then
turn it over to some such organ
ization.
Miss Shaw explained to Excom t
that SIRO was set up to handle re- i
lief on a personal basis; each pack- j
age that is mailed from Stanford 1
bears SIRO's address and the name
of the person or organization send- j
ing the package. Through a list of
names contributed by Stanford stud
ents and faculty, needy friends of
these people have received aid.
The personal basis for th ? relief
has been an incentive for collect -
ing clothing, which, Miss Shaw
pointed out, will no longer exist.
Others believed that students will i
continue to contribute to the relief,
that the personal basis had not in
fluenced their participation.

Isy Excom's refusing t'> grant
SIRO an additional sum of money
SIRO as an organization operating
on an individual basis will not ex
ist after its present packages are
mailed. It may act as a collecting
office and then turn over the col
lections to a national distributing
agency.
Excom approved the new charter
and by-laws of Ram's Head this
week, after tabling it last week until
the Constitutions Committee could
check them. Adoption of their pro
posed constitution abolishes the Dra
matics Council, replacing it with a
financial committee of Ram's Head,
chairmanned by the Business Man
ager.
According to the new rules of
membership, any student earning 15
points in dramatic productions and
in the business office of Ram's Head
is eligible for membership in Rani's
Head. Several Excom members be-

I lieved that students should be givei
j points for productions in the Speecti
I and Drama departments as well «».«
i under Ram's Head supervision. T<
| compromise, the clause limiting the
awarding of points to only Ram'}
! Head productions was deleted fron
| the charter.
In order thai the Itaily Com
I chairmen may he chosen before
Cardinals members selection, I'v
com approved a change in the Ac
tivities Council Charter to ailow
the Rally Com chairmen (o lie
chosen the first week in May, Car
dinals members to be selected the
second week in May, and Rally
; Committee members the third
week in May.
An additional change providcc

! mittee votes for the co-chairmen be
{submitted to Cardinals along will
i the co-chairmen's recommendation.'
for the next year's officers.

Miss Shaw explained to Excom t
that SIRO was set up to handle re- i
lief on a personal basis; each pack- j
age that is mailed from Stanford 1
bears SIRO's address and the name
of the person or organization send- j
ing the package. Through a list of
names contributed by Stanford stud
ents and faculty, needy friends of
these people have received aid.
The personal basis for th ? relief
has been an incentive for collect -
ing clothing, which, Miss Shaw
pointed out, will no longer exist.

continue to contribute to the relief,
that the personal basis had not in
fluenced their participation.
