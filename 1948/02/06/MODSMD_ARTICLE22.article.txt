"So what if it rains! The sophs will row to the '50-'5l Jamboree
in canoes if necessary!" said Paul Ellwood, sophomore chairman
of the gala weekend which begins this afternoon at 3:30 with a
touch-tackle football game.
"The class of '51 is planning to bring in a load of snow to add to

the festivities of the contests tomor
row if the cold weather continues,"
Ted Buttner, frosh chairman, added.
Plans for the weekend include the
game this afternoon at 3:30 on the
Rugby field, a no-date jolly-up at
Mangini's barn tonight from 9 to 1,
contests tomorrow afternoon from 2
to 6 on the Intramural field, and ,a
Ball concluding the two-day cele
bration tomorrow night from 9 to
1 in the Women's Gym.
CHANGES
"Transportation to Mangini's to
night has been changed slightly,"
Buttner said. ''Instead of meeting at
the P. 0., frosh men will call at
Roble and Branner for any women
who need rides out. Sophomore wo
men should come over to either hall
to get rides," he added.
"We want this jolly-up to be
strictly no-date, so women will be
admitted free, while men will have
to pay 50 cents," Ellwood said.
Quad clothes should be worn.
BARBERS YET
Barbers will be at Mangini's to
shave winners in the beard growing
contest which will be judged there.
George Velliotes and Dave David
son are in charge of decorations for
the barn, and Jack Nanchero's com
bo will play until midnight.
"There will be plenty of trans
portation back for women who have
to make lockouts," said Stolle, who
is in charge of transportation.
TICKETS ON SALE
Tickets for the Jamboree Ball are
on sale today at the ASSU office
for $1.80, chairman Jack Lake said.
The dance will be in the Women's
Gym from 9 to 1 tomorrow night
with Ross Headley's orchestra pro
viding the music. Decorations are in
(he form of two 50-foot murals, Lake
said, one done by each class .
TROPHY
A skit will be presented by each
class as part of the entertainment
and the evening will be climaxed by
the awarding of the gold trophy to
the class which has amassed the
most points in all the contests and
events for the weekend. The presi
dent of the losing class will award
the prize to the president of the
winning class, Buttner said.
At this time, winners for all the
