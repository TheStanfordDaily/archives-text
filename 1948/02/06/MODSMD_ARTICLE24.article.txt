# Farm Scientists Discover Depth of a Liquid Surface
## 
### 
Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute announced yes
terday that they have determined that the depth of a liquid sur
face is about 1,000 atoms or approximately a millionth of an
inch.
The measurement, made with one instrument so rare that it

does not even have a name, indi
eates that molecular attraction takes
plate fiver a wider range than has
ever been proved before.

The discovery may have practical
applications, the scientists believe,
in the fields of lubrication, oil ex
ploration, and biology, where the
leaelion of liquid surfaces in con
i.icl witli other materials is an im
portant factor.
The Stanford scientists are work
in?;, on an Office of Naval Research
conti ict under the overall supervj
ioii of Dr. J. W. Mcßain, prolessor
ol chemistry emeritus who is coii
oltanl on the research.

The scientists have also produced
evidence that because of the effect
ive long-range inlluence ol mole
cule'; upon one another, the strength
of a joint depends as much on the
strength of the metals being joined
as it does on the st rough of the
adhesive.

Dr. Mcßain pointed out that this
phase of the work indicates that, sci
entifically speaking, a chain is not
merely as strong as its weakest link,
for the proverbial weak link can be
strengthened somewhat by having
strong links next to it.
The scientists did riot do their
li sting with chains, but, for example,
with tiny cubes of copper and tung
sten, joined together with a thin
coat of soft shellac.
With copper cubes, the breaking
[joint ol the shellac was (5,000 pounds
per square inch.
