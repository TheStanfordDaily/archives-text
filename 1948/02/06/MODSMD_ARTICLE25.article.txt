DR.A. PAUL BRADY. research project director. looks through the
<\e piece -i| a rare instrument—so uneoni'iion it docs not have a name—
in c\ pcrinienls at Stanford Research Institute which have upset classi
cal theories of the behavior of mailer. Dr .1 VV. McBAIN, re search
* onsiillatil, watches as l)r. Brady checks th- de'!i'ctitni of polariicd
light off a liquid surface to determine its depth. By us-.- of this method.,
the scientists have established! that the depth of liquid surfaces is about
a millionth ol an inch and that the influence of molecules upon their
neighbor is lar greater than has been previously established.
