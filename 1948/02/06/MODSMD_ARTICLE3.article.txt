# '51 Treasury Reaches $1337
## 
### 
With the collection of class dues
amounting to $1,418 and disburse
ments totaling $81, the freshman
class at this time has a balance on
hand of $1,337, according to Louise
Burrill, freshman class secretary
j treasurer.
Although Branner Hall and Roble
Hall have subscribed 100 per cent
to the drive for the collection of
1 class dues, other freshman living
groups have been slow to respond
to the appeal for funds. The per
j centage of contributions in these
groups is as follows: Stanford Vilâ€”
! lage, 65 per cent; of! campus, 55 per
| cent; and Encina, 70 per cent.
Miss Burrill urged every fresh
j man who has not subscribed to the
I drive for class dues to do so im
mediately so that the campaign may
be brouhgt to an end. Dues should
be paid to Don Craven in the Vil
lage and to wing business managers
in Encina. OfT - campus students
should make their payment either to
Gee - Gee Anderson or Gordon
Campbell.
"Once again I must remind every
] freshman that unless this drive for
j class dues is completely successful,
! our class activities during the next
four years will have to be sharply
I curtailed," Miss Burrill concluded.
