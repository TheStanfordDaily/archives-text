Talk about exciting ball games.
That Bradley Tech affair was the
most interesting battle Joe Phan has
twirl a chance to watch this year.
To begin with, it was a natural.
The Illinois five had a 20-out-of-2l
record and a scoring average of over
70 points ,a game. Stanford, entering
with an 11-and-5 record, boasted
the West's best defensive team.
And what happened? Well, Brad
ley managed to sink one field goal in
the first six minutes of action. Their
blazing speed and good ball han
dling under the bucket began to pay
off. A sensational shotmaker, center
Paul Unruh, began hitting.
The Illinois school had itself a ball
game, though. A guy named Steve
Stephenson, the best center in the
West (at least) got out of a sickbed
and sparked the Indian offense.
He did so well it looked like Stan
ford would not only take the lead
in the second haif (which we did)

The varsity basketball team will
be idle this weekend following its
great performance against Brad
ley Tuesday.
The eagers go back into action
Feb. I.'i when they will take on
I t'l,A at the Pavilion. The follow
ing night USC will invade the
Farm.
These will be the Indians' first
conference games in four week:;.

but would romp on out in front and
hand the visiting Midwesterners a
first-class pasting.
The realm of make-believe only
seems to go so tar. I wondered, in
the second half with Stanford in
front, just what the betting odds
were on the game. Would the Il
linois bet - boys have established
Bradley a 10-1 favorite? It was
worth a smile.
Needless to say, Bobby Garber,
the tiny Bradley substitute guard,
will be long remembered in this
area. He broke up last year's game
at Peoria, and was the boy who
margined USF, 50 - 43, this year.
Tuesday's foray was all in the
night's work for Bobby. That's his
job at Bradley—breaking up close
ball games.
In the final count Bradley won
out 47-4G. It was their lowest score
of the season and their toughest
game.
But most of al! the final score re
flected Everett Dean's fine coaching
and was a proof that a well-coached
defense can stop a high-speed, of
fensive- minded team.
That the Cards didn't win was too
bad. But lot's chalk that one off. It
was non-conference. Next week the
big ones arrive.
Look out. Cal. for those st retch -
running Cardinals we'll be hard to
beat from here on in.

HID YOU KNOW DEPT.: That
Pete August, two-year Stanford
center, came out of his trip to Ha
waii with the Herman Wedemeyer
All-Stars with a broken leg? The
players, including the Farm's
George Quist and AinsHe Bell, re
ceived $150 per man plus traveling
expenses. . . . That Oregon's sen
sational Jake Leicht was passed up
in both pro football drafts. That
gave Jake a right to pick his own
team -and the speedster signed on
the doited line recently with the
Cleveland Browns. As if they aren't
strong enough! . . . That Howie
Odell will draw a salary of $10,000
as the University of Washington's
head football coach this fall. . . .
That UCLA alumni are trying to
buy ud Bert La Brucherie's contract
for $15,000. Bert, the "Coach of the
Year" a year aTo. just ''didn't did it"
last fall. Meble he'll slip quietly
back to Los Angeles High from
whence he came. (That's to insure
the patronage of all the LAHighyas
en campus -and there're plenty!).
, . . Reports from the Southland
say that "Big Jim" Reynolds is
busy scaring up a football team for
Ihe Farm next year. Better keen il
quiet about our unbeaten frosh. The
more good boys that apply to get
into Stanford, the more that actu
ally will (although the ratio is even
worse than the male-female brick
wall on campus). The latest has it
that Chaffey JC's sensational Anse
McCCullough is headed this way.
Cross your fingers, Marchie! Not
that you'll get him. but that you'll
get him in. . . . And did you know
that Compton's fine invitational
track and field meet might go by the
boards this year. The Tartars are in
a lot of hot water after their un
sportsmanlike conduct in regard to
the Little Rose Bowl game last fall.

ceived $150 per man plus traveling
expenses. . . . That Oregon's sen
sational Jake Leicht was passed up
in both pro football drafts. That
gave Jake a right to pick his own
team -and the speedster signed on
the doited line recently with the
Cleveland Browns. As if they aren't
strong enough! . . . That Howie
Odell will draw a salary of $10,000
as the University of Washington's
head football coach this fall. . . .
That UCLA alumni are trying to
buy ud Bert La Brucherie's contract
for $15,000. Bert, the "Coach of the
Year" a year aTo. just ''didn't did it"
last fall. Meble he'll slip quietly
back to Los Angeles High from
whence he came. (That's to insure
the patronage of all the LAHighyas
en campus -and there're plenty!).
, . . Reports from the Southland
say that "Big Jim" Reynolds is
busy scaring up a football team for
Ihe Farm next year. Better keen il
quiet about our unbeaten frosh. The
more good boys that apply to get
into Stanford, the more that actu
ally will (although the ratio is even
worse than the male-female brick
wall on campus). The latest has it
that Chaffey JC's sensational Anse
McCCullough is headed this way.
Cross your fingers, Marchie! Not
that you'll get him. but that you'll
get him in. . . . And did you know
that Compton's fine invitational
track and field meet might go by the
boards this year. The Tartars are in
a lot of hot water after their un
sportsmanlike conduct in regard to
the Little Rose Bowl game last fall.
Talk about exciting ball games.
That Bradley Tech affair was the
most interesting battle Joe Phan has
twirl a chance to watch this year.
To begin with, it was a natural.
The Illinois five had a 20-out-of-2l
record and a scoring average of over
70 points ,a game. Stanford, entering
with an 11-and-5 record, boasted
the West's best defensive team.
And what happened? Well, Brad
ley managed to sink one field goal in
the first six minutes of action. Their
blazing speed and good ball han
dling under the bucket began to pay
off. A sensational shotmaker, center
Paul Unruh, began hitting.
The Illinois school had itself a ball
game, though. A guy named Steve
Stephenson, the best center in the
West (at least) got out of a sickbed
and sparked the Indian offense.
He did so well it looked like Stan
ford would not only take the lead
in the second haif (which we did)

The varsity basketball team will
be idle this weekend following its
great performance against Brad
ley Tuesday.
The eagers go back into action
Feb. I.'i when they will take on
I t'l,A at the Pavilion. The follow
ing night USC will invade the
Farm.
These will be the Indians' first
conference games in four week:;.

but would romp on out in front and
hand the visiting Midwesterners a
first-class pasting.
The realm of make-believe only
seems to go so tar. I wondered, in
the second half with Stanford in
front, just what the betting odds
were on the game. Would the Il
linois bet - boys have established
Bradley a 10-1 favorite? It was
worth a smile.
Needless to say, Bobby Garber,
the tiny Bradley substitute guard,
will be long remembered in this
area. He broke up last year's game
at Peoria, and was the boy who
margined USF, 50 - 43, this year.
Tuesday's foray was all in the
night's work for Bobby. That's his
job at Bradley—breaking up close
ball games.
In the final count Bradley won
out 47-4G. It was their lowest score
of the season and their toughest
game.
But most of al! the final score re
flected Everett Dean's fine coaching
and was a proof that a well-coached
defense can stop a high-speed, of
fensive- minded team.
That the Cards didn't win was too
bad. But lot's chalk that one off. It
was non-conference. Next week the
big ones arrive.
Look out. Cal. for those st retch -
running Cardinals we'll be hard to
beat from here on in.

conference games in four week:;.

but would romp on out in front and
hand the visiting Midwesterners a
first-class pasting.
The realm of make-believe only
seems to go so tar. I wondered, in
the second half with Stanford in
front, just what the betting odds
were on the game. Would the Il
linois bet - boys have established
Bradley a 10-1 favorite? It was
worth a smile.
Needless to say, Bobby Garber,
the tiny Bradley substitute guard,
will be long remembered in this
area. He broke up last year's game
at Peoria, and was the boy who
margined USF, 50 - 43, this year.
Tuesday's foray was all in the
night's work for Bobby. That's his
job at Bradley—breaking up close
ball games.
In the final count Bradley won
out 47-4G. It was their lowest score
of the season and their toughest
game.
But most of al! the final score re
flected Everett Dean's fine coaching
and was a proof that a well-coached
defense can stop a high-speed, of
fensive- minded team.
That the Cards didn't win was too
bad. But lot's chalk that one off. It
was non-conference. Next week the
big ones arrive.
Look out. Cal. for those st retch -
running Cardinals we'll be hard to
beat from here on in.

HID YOU KNOW DEPT.: That
Pete August, two-year Stanford
center, came out of his trip to Ha
waii with the Herman Wedemeyer
All-Stars with a broken leg? The
players, including the Farm's
George Quist and AinsHe Bell, re
ceived $150 per man plus traveling
expenses. . . . That Oregon's sen
sational Jake Leicht was passed up
in both pro football drafts. That
gave Jake a right to pick his own
team -and the speedster signed on
the doited line recently with the
Cleveland Browns. As if they aren't
strong enough! . . . That Howie
Odell will draw a salary of $10,000
as the University of Washington's
head football coach this fall. . . .
That UCLA alumni are trying to
buy ud Bert La Brucherie's contract
for $15,000. Bert, the "Coach of the
Year" a year aTo. just ''didn't did it"
last fall. Meble he'll slip quietly
back to Los Angeles High from
whence he came. (That's to insure
the patronage of all the LAHighyas
en campus -and there're plenty!).
, . . Reports from the Southland
say that "Big Jim" Reynolds is
busy scaring up a football team for
Ihe Farm next year. Better keen il
quiet about our unbeaten frosh. The
more good boys that apply to get
into Stanford, the more that actu
ally will (although the ratio is even
worse than the male-female brick
wall on campus). The latest has it
that Chaffey JC's sensational Anse
McCCullough is headed this way.
Cross your fingers, Marchie! Not
that you'll get him. but that you'll
get him in. . . . And did you know
that Compton's fine invitational
track and field meet might go by the
boards this year. The Tartars are in
a lot of hot water after their un
sportsmanlike conduct in regard to
the Little Rose Bowl game last fall.
Talk about exciting ball games.
That Bradley Tech affair was the
most interesting battle Joe Phan has
twirl a chance to watch this year.
To begin with, it was a natural.
The Illinois five had a 20-out-of-2l
record and a scoring average of over
70 points ,a game. Stanford, entering
with an 11-and-5 record, boasted
the West's best defensive team.
And what happened? Well, Brad
ley managed to sink one field goal in
the first six minutes of action. Their
blazing speed and good ball han
dling under the bucket began to pay
off. A sensational shotmaker, center
Paul Unruh, began hitting.
The Illinois school had itself a ball
game, though. A guy named Steve
Stephenson, the best center in the
West (at least) got out of a sickbed
and sparked the Indian offense.
He did so well it looked like Stan
ford would not only take the lead
in the second haif (which we did)

The varsity basketball team will
be idle this weekend following its
great performance against Brad
ley Tuesday.
The eagers go back into action
Feb. I.'i when they will take on
I t'l,A at the Pavilion. The follow
ing night USC will invade the
Farm.
These will be the Indians' first
conference games in four week:;.
