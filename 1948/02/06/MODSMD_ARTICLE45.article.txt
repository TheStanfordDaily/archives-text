# Take It Away, John
## 
### 
Dear John:
It's been an enjoyable four months.
Four months from now you'll say the same
thing.
But in between now and then you may won
der. You may wonder when someone comes
to The Shack and wants to know why the
dance he's selling tickets to wasn't mentioned
in The Daily. Or why his name was left out
of a story. Or why you ran an article on the
Rest Home when he thought a story on the
Cellar would have been more appropriate.
You'll see a lot of that "someone." He
writes letters. He calls you up. He's in The
Shack at 9 in the morning just to see you.
Every once in a while he writes a Bull
Session and wants you to print it.
Be nice to him. But that's all.
He lives in a room just like everyone else.
He goes to school. He gets grades just like
you or I.
But The Daily isn't printed just for him. Or
any person or group. It's printed for the entire
campus.
Think in terms of the whole campus. Give
to every story the space that it warrants in pro
portion to its value to the entire campus.
It makes it a little hard at first. People don't

like to have you tell them that they are not
too important. Or that their group is not the
biggest thing since V-J day.
But it pays off.
When you finish as editor you'll know what
I mean.
★ * * it
No matter how fast you type or how much
time you spend in The Shack you can't get a
paper out by yourself. I was lucky, John. I
couldn't have had a better staff.
The managing editor is the key position on
the staff. It was a pleasure to work with some
one like Schwim.
And you John. And Don and Margie. And
all the rest.
You've got a lot of good writers on your
staff.' Many of them v/ill be editors when you
and I are alumni.
(Aside to Newt: You told me never to un
dersell the staff —I never have. And I know
why you said that).

Give me a couple of days to clean out the
desk, John.
A lot of things accumulate in four months. —

Dear John:
It's been an enjoyable four months.
Four months from now you'll say the same
thing.
But in between now and then you may won
der. You may wonder when someone comes
to The Shack and wants to know why the
dance he's selling tickets to wasn't mentioned
in The Daily. Or why his name was left out
of a story. Or why you ran an article on the
Rest Home when he thought a story on the
Cellar would have been more appropriate.
You'll see a lot of that "someone." He
writes letters. He calls you up. He's in The
Shack at 9 in the morning just to see you.
Every once in a while he writes a Bull
Session and wants you to print it.
Be nice to him. But that's all.
He lives in a room just like everyone else.
He goes to school. He gets grades just like
you or I.
But The Daily isn't printed just for him. Or
any person or group. It's printed for the entire
campus.
Think in terms of the whole campus. Give
to every story the space that it warrants in pro
portion to its value to the entire campus.
It makes it a little hard at first. People don't

like to have you tell them that they are not
too important. Or that their group is not the
biggest thing since V-J day.
But it pays off.
When you finish as editor you'll know what
I mean.

No matter how fast you type or how much
time you spend in The Shack you can't get a
paper out by yourself. I was lucky, John. I
couldn't have had a better staff.
The managing editor is the key position on
the staff. It was a pleasure to work with some
one like Schwim.
And you John. And Don and Margie. And
all the rest.
You've got a lot of good writers on your
staff.' Many of them v/ill be editors when you
and I are alumni.
(Aside to Newt: You told me never to un
dersell the staff —I never have. And I know
why you said that).

Give me a couple of days to clean out the
desk, John.
A lot of things accumulate in four months. —
George.
