# CULL SESSION

### WAYNE SARGENT 
Well here it is February and you can still buy
phonograph records. Petrillo doesn't scare me any
more. I hall expected that by now a good phonograph
record would be as rare as a virgin in Hollywood.
As a matter of fact I bought up 12 copies of "Musk
rat Ramble," expecting the shortage.
But it doesn't look as though I'm going to make a
fortune on the dyal.
About the only effect I've noticed is that 5 out
of every 10 records on the juke box are "I'm Looking
Over a Four-leaf Clover That I Overlooked Before."
That's all right, it's a cute tune. Just so long as
they don't re-revive "Jeannie with the Light Brown
Hair." Or don't you remember the ASCAI 3 feud with
BMI a few years ago?
They played that piece so much that one watch
company was advertising its product as being "Lon
jeanie with the 1 brown hair spring."
I'm strictly a cat myselfâ€”none of this longhair
stuff. I'm no square from Delaware, a bear goin'
nowhere.
I did go to the opera once, though. I saw Die
Walkure. After waiting in my seat for fully twenty
minutes a big fat greasy looking guy with nothing
on but a bear robe comes on.
Presently in comes a woman. None of the "true
music lovers" knew who she was, although 1 thought
maybe it was Sophie Tucker.
As soon as the big guy sees the dame he rushes
over and throws a left jab at her that would stop
a horse.
But the babe wasn't there. She stepped inside the
punch and landed a quick left book to the jaw. They
clinched and swayed back and forth moaning and

growling continually, while the orchestra played a
trilly Eliza-crossing-the-ice type of music.
Fina,Hy they broke and ran to the front of the
stage, arms outstretched and yelling like a witness at
a grain speculation hearing.
The conductor was giving the orchestra both bar
rels. He was shoving an obligato up a cadenza or
something and tearing out $8.00 worth of hair. I
thought for a while the place was being raided.
It was the biggest thing since the wrestling matches
came to San Jose.
I suppose I'm making enemies of a lot of classi
cists. but maybe I'll get an invitation to the jazz club
as compensation.
There, by the way, (my own personal opinion) is
an outfit that does the best job of publicity of any
small group on campus.
I used to be a musician myself. I was an organist,
but I had to give it up when the monkey died.
I was once awfully embarrassed about my music.
I was out to dinner at a friend's, one Herman Schmid
dling. Dinner was a little late and the hostess, who
plays the piano, asked if I'd like a sonata before din
ner. I guess I shouldn't have told her I bad three
on the way over. It was the wrong answer, 1 know,
but she always makes them with a cherry in it, and
I like a twist, of lemon.
Nevertheless, I still play the piano once in a while
to kill time. And the way I play it's the perfect
weapon.
I think the greatest music review ever to appear
in a paper was printed back east. It read in total:
"An amateur string quartet played Brahms here
last evening. Brahms lost."
