To the unbroken chain of broken promises in
Palestine a new link is about to be added. Plans
for partition, one ot the lew concrete UN successes,
may be abandoned.
"West Expected to Protect Its Interests at Expense
of Palestine Partition, - ' wrote the Chronicle a few
days after Secretary of Defense Foi'restal had told
Congress that American oil interests in the Middle
East are threatened by partition.
Our fears about oil are riot groundless. Diplomats
reason that Holy Land partition can only be enforced
by a United Nations police force which Russia might
insist on* joining. The Soviets might then demand
supply lines through Iraq and Iran. The diplomats go
on to say that once Stalin's troops are in the already
explosive Middle East all kinds of trouble can easily
start, especially around oil wells.
So it can. But there is an alternative course open.
We can let the Jews in Palestine build an army strong
enough to defend themselves against the Arabs. The
Jews have repeatedly announced that given half a
chance they can do this. They have pointed out that
their already superbly trained Hagannah can. if given
enough arms, handle the disorganized if numerically
superior Arabs.
The UN Palestine Commission favors such a plan.
England and the US apparently do not. British
vernment officials say that they can't see how it
would work. To bolster their argument they are doing
their best to make sure that it will not work. They
are making sure that the situation in the Near East
will not calm down, for they have announced offi
cially that they will fulfill all their obligations in
selling aims and ammunition to the Arabs. At th"
: anie time thev arch every shin commit to the Holy

Land thoroughly to make sure that the Jews are not
getting guns.
Secretary Marshall said only last week that the
State Department does not consider any change in
its embargo of arms shipments to the Holy Land. It is
true that the embargo applies also to Arabs, but
Arabs can get guns in England while Jews cannot.
It is also ironic that the money the Moslems use for
purchasing arms is predominantly American money
â€”the cold cash we pay them for oil concessions.
Thus it is the supremely hypocritical policy of
Great Britain, and some extent of the United States,
that is preventing a peaceful and just settlement of
the problem. The Arabs have made it clear that they
will do everything in their power to partition.
If their open defiance of the United Nations would
not be aided by the Western nations and if instead
the Jews were given the opportunity to defend them
selves. the Arabs would soon Quiet down.
Palestine is the only hope for hundreds of thous
ands of displaced persons in Europe persons whom
we have refused admission. It is the only hope for
three quarters of a million Jews in the Holy Land
who have worked against incredible odds to turn
deserts into gardens, to build towns and cities where
nothing stood before.
If we do not make sure that partition is enforced,
these people will fight. They have worked so hard,
waited so long, endured so many broken promises
that their patience is running out. They will not only
frustrate our desires for peace around the oil wells,
but their blood will be on our conscience.
It is up to us to see that the cradle of Christianity
does not become the cradle of disaster.
