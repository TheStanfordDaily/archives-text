# Commission Points Out Housing Discrimination

(Editor's nolo: This is the last in a series of articles sponsored h.v the
Daily to foster an awareness of the danger among Stanford students of
accepting as a self-perpetuating tiling the close association between
our country and such terms as tolerance, equality, and freedom. 'IViese
articles have been a condensation of the report of the President's Com
mittee on Civil Rights. .Material not enclosed in parentheses has been
taken verbatim from the reports.

Equality of opportunity to rent or buy a home should exist
for every American. Today, many of our citizens encounter
prejudice and discrimination based upon race, color, religion,
or national origin, which places them at a disadvantage in com
peting for the limited housing that is available. One of the most

common practices is the policy of
landlords and real estate agents pre
venting Negroes from renting outside
of designated areas. The landlords
and real estate agents it is "good
business" to develop exclusive re
st r i c t e d suburban developments
which are barred to all but white
gentiles.
Private builders show a tendency
not to construct new homes except
for white occupancy. These inter
locking business customs and devic
es form the core of our discrim
inatory policy.
SEGREGATION
Segregation has become the cor
nerstone of the elaborate structure
of discrimination against some Am
erican citizens.
We believe that not even the most
mathematically precise equality of
segregated institutions can properly
be considered equality under the
law. No argument or rationalization
can alter this basic fact: a law which
forbids a group of American citi
zens to associate with other citizens
in the ordinary course of daily living
creates inequality by imposing a
caste status on the minority group.
If reason and history were not
enough to substantiate the argument
against segregation, recent exper
iences further strengthen it. For
these experiences demonstrate that
segregation is an obstacle to estab
lishing harmonious relationships
among groups.
COOPERATIVE EFFORT
They prove that where the arti
ficial barriers which divide people
and groups from one another are
broken, tension and conflict begin
to be replaced by cooperative effort
and an environment in which civil
rights can thrive.
The separate but equal doctrine
stands convicted on three grounds.
It contravenes the equalitarian spirit
of the American heritage. It has
failed to operate, for history shows
that inequality of service has been
the omnipresent consequence of sep
aration. It has institutionalized seg
regation and kept groups apart de
spite indisputable evidence that nor
mal contacts among these groups
tend to promote social harmony.
MORAL DRY ROT
The pervasive gap between our
aims and what we actually do is cre
ating a kind of moral dry rot which
eats away at the emotional and ra
tional bases of democratic beliefs.
There are times when the differ
ence between what we preach about
civil rights and what we practice is
shockingly illustrated by individual
outrages. There are times when the
whole structure of our ideology is
made ridiculous by individual in
stances.
It is impossible to decide who suf
fers the greatest moral damage from
our civil rights transgressions, be

cause all of lis are hurt. All of its
must share in the shame at the
growth of hypocrisies . . . Ail of
lis must endure the cynicism about
democratic values which our fail
ures breed. The United States can no
longer countenance these burdens
on its common conscience, these in
roads on its moral fiber.
It is not at all surprising that a
people relegated to second-class citi
zenship should behave as second
class citizens. This is true, in vary
ing degrees, of all of our minorities.
What we have lost in money, pro
duction, invention, citizenship, and
leadership as the price for damaged
thwarted personalities—these are be
yond estimate.
The United Slates can no longer
afford this heavy drain upon its
human wealth, its national compe
tence.
COUNTRY'S DIGNITY
Our position in the postwar world
is so vital to the future that our
smallest actions have far-reaching
effects. Discrimination against, or
mistreatment of, any racial, relig
ious or national group in the United
States is not only seen as our inter
nal problem. The dignity of a coun
try, a continent, or even a major
portion of the world's population,
may be outraged by it.
The United States is not so strong,
the final triumph of the democratic
ideal is not so inevitable thai we
can ignore what the world thinks of
us or our record.
- - - the time for action is now!

prejudice and discrimination based upon race, color, religion,
or national origin, which places them at a disadvantage in com
peting for the limited housing that is available. One of the most

common practices is the policy of
landlords and real estate agents pre
venting Negroes from renting outside
of designated areas. The landlords
and real estate agents it is "good
business" to develop exclusive re
st r i c t e d suburban developments
which are barred to all but white
gentiles.
Private builders show a tendency
not to construct new homes except
for white occupancy. These inter
locking business customs and devic
es form the core of our discrim
inatory policy.
SEGREGATION
Segregation has become the cor
nerstone of the elaborate structure
of discrimination against some Am
erican citizens.
We believe that not even the most
mathematically precise equality of
segregated institutions can properly
be considered equality under the
law. No argument or rationalization
can alter this basic fact: a law which
forbids a group of American citi
zens to associate with other citizens
in the ordinary course of daily living
creates inequality by imposing a
caste status on the minority group.
If reason and history were not
enough to substantiate the argument
against segregation, recent exper
iences further strengthen it. For
these experiences demonstrate that
segregation is an obstacle to estab
lishing harmonious relationships
among groups.
COOPERATIVE EFFORT
They prove that where the arti
ficial barriers which divide people
and groups from one another are
broken, tension and conflict begin
to be replaced by cooperative effort
and an environment in which civil
rights can thrive.
The separate but equal doctrine
stands convicted on three grounds.
It contravenes the equalitarian spirit
of the American heritage. It has
failed to operate, for history shows
that inequality of service has been
the omnipresent consequence of sep
aration. It has institutionalized seg
regation and kept groups apart de
spite indisputable evidence that nor
mal contacts among these groups
tend to promote social harmony.
MORAL DRY ROT
The pervasive gap between our
aims and what we actually do is cre
ating a kind of moral dry rot which
eats away at the emotional and ra
tional bases of democratic beliefs.
There are times when the differ
ence between what we preach about
civil rights and what we practice is
shockingly illustrated by individual
outrages. There are times when the
whole structure of our ideology is
made ridiculous by individual in
stances.
It is impossible to decide who suf
fers the greatest moral damage from
our civil rights transgressions, be

cause all of lis are hurt. All of its
must share in the shame at the
growth of hypocrisies . . . Ail of
lis must endure the cynicism about
democratic values which our fail
ures breed. The United States can no
longer countenance these burdens
on its common conscience, these in
roads on its moral fiber.
It is not at all surprising that a
people relegated to second-class citi
zenship should behave as second
class citizens. This is true, in vary
ing degrees, of all of our minorities.
What we have lost in money, pro
duction, invention, citizenship, and
leadership as the price for damaged
thwarted personalities—these are be
yond estimate.
The United Slates can no longer
afford this heavy drain upon its
human wealth, its national compe
tence.
COUNTRY'S DIGNITY
Our position in the postwar world
is so vital to the future that our
smallest actions have far-reaching
effects. Discrimination against, or
mistreatment of, any racial, relig

portion of the world's population,

for white occupancy. These inter
locking business customs and devic
es form the core of our discrim
inatory policy.
SEGREGATION
Segregation has become the cor
nerstone of the elaborate structure
of discrimination against some Am
erican citizens.
We believe that not even the most
mathematically precise equality of
segregated institutions can properly
be considered equality under the
law. No argument or rationalization
can alter this basic fact: a law which
forbids a group of American citi
zens to associate with other citizens
in the ordinary course of daily living
creates inequality by imposing a
caste status on the minority group.
If reason and history were not
enough to substantiate the argument
against segregation, recent exper
iences further strengthen it. For
these experiences demonstrate that
segregation is an obstacle to estab
lishing harmonious relationships
among groups.
COOPERATIVE EFFORT
They prove that where the arti
ficial barriers which divide people
and groups from one another are
broken, tension and conflict begin
to be replaced by cooperative effort
and an environment in which civil
rights can thrive.
The separate but equal doctrine
stands convicted on three grounds.
It contravenes the equalitarian spirit
of the American heritage. It has
failed to operate, for history shows
that inequality of service has been
the omnipresent consequence of sep
aration. It has institutionalized seg
regation and kept groups apart de
spite indisputable evidence that nor
mal contacts among these groups
tend to promote social harmony.
MORAL DRY ROT
The pervasive gap between our
aims and what we actually do is cre
ating a kind of moral dry rot which
eats away at the emotional and ra
tional bases of democratic beliefs.
There are times when the differ
ence between what we preach about
civil rights and what we practice is
shockingly illustrated by individual
outrages. There are times when the
whole structure of our ideology is
made ridiculous by individual in
stances.
It is impossible to decide who suf
fers the greatest moral damage from
our civil rights transgressions, be

cause all of lis are hurt. All of its
must share in the shame at the
growth of hypocrisies . . . Ail of
lis must endure the cynicism about
democratic values which our fail
ures breed. The United States can no
longer countenance these burdens
on its common conscience, these in
roads on its moral fiber.
It is not at all surprising that a
people relegated to second-class citi
zenship should behave as second
class citizens. This is true, in vary
ing degrees, of all of our minorities.
What we have lost in money, pro
duction, invention, citizenship, and
leadership as the price for damaged
thwarted personalities—these are be
yond estimate.
The United Slates can no longer
afford this heavy drain upon its
human wealth, its national compe
tence.
COUNTRY'S DIGNITY
Our position in the postwar world
is so vital to the future that our
smallest actions have far-reaching
effects. Discrimination against, or
mistreatment of, any racial, relig
ious or national group in the United
States is not only seen as our inter
nal problem. The dignity of a coun
try, a continent, or even a major
portion of the world's population,
may be outraged by it.
The United States is not so strong,
the final triumph of the democratic
ideal is not so inevitable thai we
can ignore what the world thinks of
us or our record.
