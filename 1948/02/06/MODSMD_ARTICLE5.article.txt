### 
Ernest M. Brandsten, advisory
director of water sports, an
nounced yesterday that as of X
a.m. yesterday there had been
1 11 inches of rain reported fallen
in the Stanford area.
"Scarsvillc Lake," lie said, "rose
three inches Wednesday night
and, by virtue of continuing rains,
is steadily on the uprise." Mr.
Brandsten said that the three
inchcv. reflected one-half million
gallons of water, or one-fourth of
the total gallon capacity of the
lake.
"The Weather Bureau has pie
dieted more rain for today," he
said, 'and it is our hope that the
long-awaited rainstorm will con
tinue until Scarsvillc overflows."
If and when the lake reaches
the overflow point, he concluded,
students will be happy to know
that prospects for filling Lagunita
will be favorable.
