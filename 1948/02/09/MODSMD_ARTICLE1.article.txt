# Toyon Drawing Will Fill Spring Room Vacancies
## 
### 
There will be approximately 2(H
vacancies in Toyon at the beginning
of spring quarter, according to the
announcement made yesterday by
Frank Hubbard, Toyon Housing
Committee representative.
Hubbard urged all eligible men
who want to move into Toyon to get
lottery tickets as soon as possible.
The drawing for rooms will be
held Saturday morning at 10 in the
ASSU committee room.
In order to give all interested
students an equal opportunity, the
lottery has been divided into three
divisions: off-campus, Village, and
eating clubs.
Off - campus men may get their
tickets in the office. Villagers
may obtain tickets from Chief
Counselor Herbert Wunderlich. Eat
ing clubs, not to be included in Sat
urday's drawing, will get their tick
ets later.
Living spaces will be filled by the
lottery drawing after a special pri
ority list has been housed. The
priority list will be composed of
Stanford veterans who attended
here prior to September, 1945, men
with physical disabilities, and men
with special jobs requiring campus
residence.
"Last quarter," said Hubbard,
"many men signed up for rooms at
Toyon, won the drawing, and then
deckled not to move in. As a result
Toyon was not completely filled
until last week. This caused a lot
of woe all the way around. So if
you don't intend to move in please
don't sign up."
