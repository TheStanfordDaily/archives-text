# Marshall Hits GOP Criticisms By Rejecting Demand That Reich Plant Dismantling Halt

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (UP)â€”Secretary of State George C.
Marshall today rejected demands that the United States halt its
plant dismantling and reparations program in Western Germany.
He warned that such action would break faith with our war-time
allies and increase the cost of the European recovery plan.

The Secretary's views answered
sharp criticism of U.S. policy in
Germany as expressed recently by
such Republican leaders as former
President Herbert Hoover and John
Foster Dulles, as well as some GOP
leaders in Congress.
"Transferred German plants are
plready contributing to the econom
ic recovery of other European coun
tries, and may be expected to re- a
duee Ihe cost of the American con
tribution to European aid," Marshall
said.
REFERS TO POTSDAM
His views were set forth in a let
ter and accompanying memorandum
to Chairman Arthur H. Vandenberg,
R., Mich., of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee. He said that a
"fundamental re - examination" of
U.S. policy made it apparent that
the United States must stand by
reparations agreements growing out.
of the 1945 Potsdam conference.
At the same time, Marshall struck
out once again at "Soviet malfea
sance" in violating Potsdam agree
ments for economic unity and even
tual economic independence for
Germany.
He repeated his earlier announce
ment that only the tag-ends of three
plants in the U.S. zone of Germany
remain to be sent the Soviets as
reparations, and that this nation is
consulting with Britain regarding
future reparations deliveries to
Russia and Poland.
WOULD VIOLATE PLEDGE
Marshall said that Britain and
France are understood to be op
posed to modification of the dis
mantling and reparations program.
Such a step, he added, would violate
an American pledge to 17 other na
tions of the Inter - Allied Repara
tions Council and place in "jeop
ardy" the U.S. stand against repa
rations drawn from current produc
tion in Germany.
"Instead of being able to dispose
of the reparations problem in a
short time and at relatively little
cost, we will be thrown back into a
situation similar to that which fol
lowed in the wake of World War I,
with general disagreement and long
drawn - out wrangling among the
victorious Allies, and particularly
those nations in western Europe
among which unity of purpose and
feeling is essential for European re
covery," he said.
GOP SUGGESTION
He gave a firm no to some GOP
suggestions that Gen. Lucius D.
Clay, U.S. occupation commander,
be ordered to halt further dis
mantling until Congress can inves
tigate.
But, in line with a suggestion
from Chairman Styles Bridges. R..
N.H., of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, Marshall revealed that
occupation authorities had been in
structed to find out whether specific
plants would not better contribute
to world supplies of scarce goods if
retained in Germany.


Secretary of State GEORGE C.
MARSHALL yesterday rejected
demands of Republican leaders
that plant dismantling and repa
rations in Western Germany be
halted.
