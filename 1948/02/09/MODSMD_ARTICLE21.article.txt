# Government Answers GOP Grain Charge
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (UP).—
The government never has used its
export purchase program to drive
grain prices up or down and will not
j do so now, despite the big market
break, Secretary of Agriculture
; Clinton P. Anderson said today.
"I can't very well pay any atten
tion to the latest Republican com
plaints on that score, because we
obviously can't push prices up and
down at the same time," Anderson
told the United Press.
ANSWERED CHARGES
His statement answered charges
by Chairman Robert A. Taft of the
! Senate Republican Policy Commit
i tee, and Chairman Clifford R. Hope,
R., Kan., of the House Agriculture
j Committee.
Taft had complained that Ander-
I son, in the- middle of the big grain
I price slump last week, apparently
had tried to keep prices up, while
Hope asserted that he was letting
| prices slump too far. And each
! charged that politics was the reason.
ANDERSONS ANNOUNCEMENT
Taft said that Anderson's an
nouncement Thursday summarizing
the government's grain-export posi
tion looked like an attempt to keep
prices up. He added that it appeared
that Anderson was trying to "cre
ate an air of false prosperity for the
Presidential election year."
Hope declared that the govern
ment had accentuated the market
slump by halting all wheat pur
chases after the market broke. He
urged that Anderson order the
Commodity Credit Corporation to
; resume wheat buying for export
"before prices are further demoral
ized."
