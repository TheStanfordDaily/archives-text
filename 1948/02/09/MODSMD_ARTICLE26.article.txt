### 
TOKYO, Monday, Feb. S (UP).â€”
Premier Tetsu Katayama today
called at the occupation headquar
ters of Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur,
presumably to confer with the Su
peme Commander on the impending
resignation of his coalition cabinet.
Cabinet Secretary Suehiro Nishio
told a news conference yesterday
that Katayama's cabinet has decided
to resign because of parliamentary
criticism, both within and outside
his Social Democratic party.
Japanese political observers to
day expressed belief that the pre
miership may go to former Premier
Shigeru Yoshida, head of the Lib
eral party, or to Foreign Minister
Hitoshi Ashida, head of the Demo
cratic party.
