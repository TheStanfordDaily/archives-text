# Post-War Period Cramps Psychics
## 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 8 (UP).â€”The re
alities of the post-war period have
caused an astonishing decline in
psychic powers ail over the world,
the Society for Psychic Research re
ported today.
Mediums, telepathists, clairvoyants,
and other psychics all have been re
porting an inexplicable difficulty in
"getting through" since 1945, said
the society, a scientific body which
investigates supernatural events.
Dr. G. N. M. Tyrrell, past presi
dent of the society, said the decline
has been very marked in England.
"I credit, or blame, the realisties
of our post-war world, with its re
strictions, queueing, shortages, and
rationing," Tyrrell said. "We are
too matter-of-fact for psychic func
tions, which seemed to thrive in the
leisurely era before the first World
War.
Tyrrell said that as a result there
are no immediate plans to open the
secret message left with the society
by Sir Oliver Lodge on his death in
1940. Lodge promised that it there
is life after death he would come
back from the other world to dupli
cate the message.
