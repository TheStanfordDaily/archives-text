# Young U.S. Skaters Take Third Place in Olympics
## 
### 
ST. MORITZ, Feb. 8 (UP).—The
youth of the amazingly successful
U.S. competitors was the sensation
of the fifth winter Olympiad today
as Little St. Moritz, for two weeks
the sports capital of the world, be
gan shrinking back to its normal
s!eepy-town size.
The Americans crossed the At
lantic with meager hopes, yet they
garnered three first - place gold
medals plus two seconds and a third
to take third place in the team
standings.
YOUTH OF SKATERS
The men's figure skating team
was a good example of the youth.
Dick Button, of Englewood, N.J.,
who won the event, is 18. John Let
tengarver of St. Paul, Minn., who
came fourth, is also 18. And Jimmy
Grogan of Oakland, Calif., who was
sixth, is only 16.
No Olympic champion dominated
his event as completely as Button.
He pulled ahead of his field in the
five compulsory figures and proved
his superiority over Switzerland's
Hans Gerschwiler, the world cham
pion, in this difficult specialty. In
free figures, Dick put on a perform
ance described by international
skating experts as the greatest ever
seen in the Olympics.
PERFECT MARK
He was awarded the only perfect
mark given a skater—man or wom
an—during the entire free skating
competition. And his closest com
petitor actually was Lettengarver,
since the Americans skated much
more difficult and varied programs.
One of the big surprises was the
fine all-around showing of brunette
Yvonne Sherman of New York City,
who placed sixth in women's figure
skating and then teamed with Rob
ert Swenning, also of New York, to
take fourth in the pairs.
BOBSLEDDING
But not all the Ameican successes
were scored by youngsters.
Mrs. Gretchen Frase of Vancou
ver, Wash., thought that at 28 she
was too old to participate in the
Olympics. Yet she went along and
gave the United States its first ski
ing medals in the history of the
Olympiad, a first place in the wom
en's slalom, and a second in the
women's Alpine combined.
Too. Jack Heaton. the globe-trot
ting New Haven, Conn., ace, won
second spot in the treacherous one
man bobsledding competition. He
had won the event in 1928, the last
time it was on the Olympic pro
gram.
The four-man bob team gave the
U.S. its third first p'ace with Fran
cis Tyler of Lake Placid. N.Y., do
ing the driving, and the third place
was earned by the two-man bob
combination of Fred Fortune of
Lake Placid and Schuyler Carron of
Ausable Forks, N.Y.

free figures, Dick put on a perform
ance described by international
skating experts as the greatest ever
seen in the Olympics.
PERFECT MARK
He was awarded the only perfect
mark given a skater—man or wom
an—during the entire free skating
competition. And his closest com
petitor actually was Lettengarver,
since the Americans skated much
more difficult and varied programs.
One of the big surprises was the
fine all-around showing of brunette
Yvonne Sherman of New York City,
who placed sixth in women's figure
skating and then teamed with Rob
ert Swenning, also of New York, to
take fourth in the pairs.
BOBSLEDDING
But not all the Ameican successes
were scored by youngsters.
Mrs. Gretchen Frase of Vancou
ver, Wash., thought that at 28 she
was too old to participate in the
Olympics. Yet she went along and
gave the United States its first ski
ing medals in the history of the
Olympiad, a first place in the wom
en's slalom, and a second in the
women's Alpine combined.
Too. Jack Heaton. the globe-trot
ting New Haven, Conn., ace, won
second spot in the treacherous one
man bobsledding competition. He
had won the event in 1928, the last
time it was on the Olympic pro
gram.
The four-man bob team gave the
U.S. its third first p'ace with Fran
cis Tyler of Lake Placid. N.Y., do
ing the driving, and the third place
was earned by the two-man bob
combination of Fred Fortune of
Lake Placid and Schuyler Carron of
Ausable Forks, N.Y.
ST. MORITZ, Feb. 8 (UP).—The
youth of the amazingly successful
U.S. competitors was the sensation
of the fifth winter Olympiad today
as Little St. Moritz, for two weeks
the sports capital of the world, be
gan shrinking back to its normal
s!eepy-town size.
The Americans crossed the At
lantic with meager hopes, yet they
garnered three first - place gold
medals plus two seconds and a third
to take third place in the team
standings.
YOUTH OF SKATERS
The men's figure skating team
was a good example of the youth.
Dick Button, of Englewood, N.J.,
who won the event, is 18. John Let
tengarver of St. Paul, Minn., who
came fourth, is also 18. And Jimmy
Grogan of Oakland, Calif., who was
sixth, is only 16.
No Olympic champion dominated
his event as completely as Button.
He pulled ahead of his field in the
five compulsory figures and proved
his superiority over Switzerland's
Hans Gerschwiler, the world cham
pion, in this difficult specialty. In
free figures, Dick put on a perform
ance described by international
skating experts as the greatest ever
seen in the Olympics.
