John Pool, business manager of
The Daily, was the Hist Village res
ident to bring the fact to the atten
tion of the night clerks early yes
terday morning when he thought
the electi ic clock in his apartment
had blown a fuse.
Someone from an apartment in
Building 315 stopped in to ask why
there was no heat in that area.
Then the telephone calls to the
Village switchboard: "We don't have
any lights in 110." "The heat's off
in Building 214 . . ." Ad frustratum
until 11 o'clock.
Nor will it do much good to ask
"Why?" of a little gray tree squir
rel who made 12,000 volts' worth of
wrong connection above the main
transformers at the Ravenswood en
trance. He ain't in a position to say
much.
