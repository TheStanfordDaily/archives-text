girls appear to have stumnled a bit
this leap year in snaring the nation's
bachelors, a survey indicated today.

checked their records and all but
one found that marriage licenses is

Ihe number issued in January 1947.
Some believed Dan Cupid would
make at least a partial comeback by
Valentine's Day, Feb. 14. and that
the trend would continue upward
through June.
Kansas City, Mo., the only city to
report an increase last month, said
that Leap Year there had started
with a "boom." More than twice as
many marriage licenses were issued
as in January last year.
However, Kansas City was an ex
ception. Washington, D. C., New
York. Boston, Reno, Chicago, Min
neapolis, Des Moines, Miami, Los
Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit. St. Louis,
and Maryland's "Gretna Green"—
Elkton, Md.—all reported decreases.
"Men are getting away from war
hysteria and lonesomeness of having
no women," license Clerk B. K. Was
muth of Minneapolis said "Things
are getting back lo normal."
Reports from other cities included:
New York—Licenses last month
numbered 7.554 compared to 8.200 in
the same month hist year. License
bureau officials said that both figures
were above normal, but did not indi
