The Stanford ruggers posted their first league win of the season
Saturday afternoon when they defeated the Menlo Ramblers
9 to 8 in a wide-open contest which saw the Cards repulse a
Isst-ditch rally by the Menloites.
The Indians accumulated a 9 to 0 lead, and then watched it

gradually diminish as Menlo's of-'
fensive began to click.
STA NFOR!) TII RE ATENS
Throughout the first half Stan
lord threatened to score as they
jkept the ball in Rambler territory
most of the time. Finally, in the
closing minutes of the first half, af
ter the ball had been dribbled to
-. ithin the 10 yard line, Fred Willey
kicked it across the goal where A 1
T'urriziani fell on the ball for the try.
The conversion attempt was wide.
Following this the Ramblers al
most tallied as a passing rush ear
ned them deep into Stanford terri
tory, but a free ball was recovered
by Stanford and kicked out.
CI"LIN SCORES
In the early part of the second
period a penalty kick by Ed Culin
made the score 6 to 0, and Bob Lind
say added 3 more points when he
grabbed a loose ball in the end zone
lor the try. The conversion attempt
which followed was also unsuccess
ful.
Then the Ramblers began to roll.
Mario Valdestri's long run set up the
lirst Menlo tally. In the scrum which
.followed, the Rambler forwards ma
neuvered the ball across the goal
where Valdestri pounced on it for
the score. Howie Sonnickson's con
version split the uprights, and the
Indians' lead was cut to 4 points.
RAMBLERS CLOSE GAP
A few minutes later the Ramblers
were once again deep in Stanford
territory. A scrum was called near
the goal, and in the subsequent
scramble Paul Cardoza gained pos
session of the ball in the end zone
lor the try. Sonnickson's attempted
conversion which would have put
the Ramblers ahead was short.
With only a minute remaining to
play Menlo made a desperate effort
to start a passing rush, but the In
dians managed to break up their
attempts thus preserving the one
point margin.
