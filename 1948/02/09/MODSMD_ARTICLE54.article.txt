## 
### 
The freshmen eked out a 2 to 0
win in football Friday, and the
sophomores came back with a 7 to 3
victory in Softball Saturday to make
it a split, for the two most impor
tant contests in ihe freshman-soph
omore weekend version of the
Olympic Games.
Both games were played in con
nection with the big '50-'5l Jam
boree that took place all day Sat
urday, and which the frosh finally
won by a close two-point margin.
In the football game, it was a
blocked kick resulting in a safety
that gave the freshmen their two
points late in the game. They then
managed to hold off several danger
ous sophomore drives to gain their
much-wanted win.
The sophomores had a giant op
portunity to rally during the last
five minutes when they recovered a
loose ball on the freshman five-yard
line, but with first and goal they
muffed their chances on three in
complete passes and a wild attempt
at an end run.
In the Softball tilt. Coach Armand
Viole's second-year men powered
through to gain an easy victory. The
yearlings threatened in their half of
the third inning when they loaded
the bases with none out, but some
fancy pitching by Gus Chavalas and
some neat infield work by Bill Arce
stifled the frosh attack.
The total points for both games
gave the sophomores a 7 to 5 point
lead.
