## Farm Squad Loses, 1 to 0 
### 
Stanford soccermen were nosed
out of their third contest of the
quarter Saturday as they dropped
a 1 to 0 contest to the Mexico Ath
letic Club on the Stanford field.
It was the second loss to the Club
men for the Farm lads. The first
contest ended 8 to 2 in favor of the
visitors, and the second tilt was a
i tied 3â€”a 11 when the teams quit the
field.
Dave Tappan's team was without
the services of Rick Trejos and
Dwaine White in Saturday's fray
but the first appearance of Homi
I Irani helped to offset this loss.
The visitors' lone tally came mid
way in the first half when center
forward George Aquilo netted one
from 10 yards out.
Missed scoring opportunities by
the Indians marked the encounter as
the Stanfordites controlled the ma
jor portion of the play for the first
time in the three games between
the two squads.
Next contest for the Cardinal soc
cermen is scheduled lor next Satur
day, February 14. with the Verdi
Athletic Club of San Francisco, li
will be played on the Stanford field.
