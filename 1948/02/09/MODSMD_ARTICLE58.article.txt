# KSU Outlasts Daily Cagers
## 
### 
The Daily sports staff's mighty
Goliaths of the basketball court sue-
I cumbed to KSU's aggregation i.i a
; grudge battle last Saturday morn
j ing, 24 to 18.
It was KSU's better ball handling
and offensive work that clinched the
i victory although the Daily men
controlled the backboards.
Starting out slowly, the KSU men
j spurted ahead midway in the first
half and led at the midway mark
10 to 3. As the second stanza open
j ed, the Daily five, sparked by their
tall, galloping center, Jack Cashel,
crept up on the KSU boys and with
only a minute to go trailed 18 to IG.
But the broadcasters were not to
be denied and dumped in three; quick
buckets as the Daily switched to a
man to man defence in a list difc-h
effort to get the ball.
