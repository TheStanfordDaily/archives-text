### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 8 (UP).—The
basketball campaign found its feet
where its head ought to be today in j
the wake of a wild and woolly upset
spree that left nothing sacred.
Just look at some of the results
which poured in:
1. Kansas State, which had lost
only once in 16 starts, was toppled
by Missouri, a 9-and-6 team, 48
to 4G.
2. Kentucky, also a one-time los- (
er, lost to Notre Dame, 48 to 40.
3. Rhode Island State, which
spent a better part of the season
among the ranks of the undefeated, !
suddenly dropped two in a row, the |
first to Vilanova by 98-84 and again
to Rutgers by 8(5-71.
4. Tulane, loser only to unde
feated NYU and supreme in the j
deep South, was downed by Ala
bama, 50 to 49.
Those were the big ones, and i
there were a lot of lesser form re- !
versals to add further spice to the '
unpredictable.

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 (UP).
—Washington State took command
of one of the most jumbled Pacific
Coast Conference basketball races
in history today, hitting the north
ern division backstretch with a vir
tually clear field ahead.
As Washington and Oregon State
blasted themselves out of compe
tition, the dark - horse Cougars
squeezed into first place in the tur
bulent northern pennant chase via
the backdoor route —without scor
ing a point.
While Washington State was idle
over the weekend, Washington
handed a surprising double licking
to OSC, knocking the defending
coast champs down into second
place — and automatically elevating
Washington State to first. The score
was 56-26 for Washington on Fri
day night and 27-23 Saturday.
Another weekend double bill in
the north saw Oregon and Idaho
split their battle for the cellar
championship. Oregon won 64-46
Friday night.
