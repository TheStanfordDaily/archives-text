slushy ice to win the Olympic hock
ey tournament today and that auto
matically gave Sweden the unofficial
team championship in the fifth win

HOCKEY GAMES CLINCH CROWN
It was Canada's win over Switzer
land and the 4 to 3 triumph Czech-
Slovakia scored over the United
States that enabled Sweden to clinch
team championship today.
As the day's last program, got
under way, second-place Switzer
land's only hope of winning the ti
tle was a hocky tournament victory
—and that would have required both
Canada and Czechoslovakia to lose.
It didn't turn out that way.
The ice was so bail that the mo
ment Canada scored its first goal in
the opening period, victory was as
sured. And the Czechs left little
doubt of their chances when they
piled up three goals in the first per
iod against the U.S.
TIE FOR PUCK CHAMPIONSHIP
Czechoslovakia and Canada fin
ished the team standings in the
hockey tournament in a tie, both
undefeated and tied once. But Can
ada took the title on the basis of a
goal average; the Canadians scored
69 goals and yielded only five, while
the Czechs scored 80 but conceded
18.
Switzerland finished third in the
tourney, loser only to the two lead
ers, Canada and Czechoslovakia.
Thus Sweden took the mythical
team championship, not actually re
cognized in Olympic annals, with S2
points followed by Switzerland with
