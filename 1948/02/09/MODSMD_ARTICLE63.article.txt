# Jack Weiershauser-Farm Great Returns as Coach
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Newly sharpened spikes flashing
; i?i the spring .sun, shots and discuses
hurtling through the air, and sharp
cracks of guns starting accurate stop
1 watches—this is the daily scene at
Angel 1 Field with Stanford's Coach
Jack Weiershauser teaching over
100 men the fundamentals of track.
Jack himself was a Stanford cin
derman, being one of the mainstays
| of the 193(3 and 1937 varsity squads.
He came to the Farm from junior
college, and in 1930 won his letter
in the 440-yard dash.
CONCENTRATES ON SPRINTS
It was in 1137 that he really
' showed his track abilities. He con
centrated on the sprints and the
: hurdles that season, and often ran
as many as three events.
Most Indian track fans remember
the famous USC-Stanford meet in
1937. Jack had already fared very
well in two races that day, and he
needed all the rest that he could
get before his next event, the low
hurdles. Stanford tried to stall, but
the delay became apparent to the
USC squad, who quickly set up the
hurdles themselves. This helped the

I Trojans win the event and finally
the meet.
Coach Weiershauser set records
1 which still stand in the 880-yard
I relay and the 200-meter race around
! a turn. In the former he ran with
I Jim Kneubuhl, Ray Malott, and
! Stan Hisermann at the Fresno Re
lays in the world record time of
1:25.0.
NEW AMERICAN RECORD
In the National AAU meet in
' 1937, he ran the 200 - meter race
J around a turn in 20.9 seconds, a
new American" record.
Upon his graduation in 1937, Jack
I hung up his spikes, but in 1940 he
j came back to Stanford to serve as j
i an assistant to Bill Ellington.
In 1941 he was appointed head
j coach at Washington State College
j and moulded a team which took the
! Northern Division championship \
and placed third in the Pacific Coast ;
Conference, beating Stanford.
The war interrupted his coaching
! career, but in December, 19455, he
returned to his alma mater as head
I coach.
The 194G season was a disastrous
1 one, as he only managed to dig up 1

a team composed of a few enthu
siastic men who wanted to run. F. •
can remember how a powerful USJ
team, knowing lhat they could eas
ily win, ran their stars two or three
times in order to roll up a score of
over 100 points.
A EROSH YEAR
With a squad composed mostly c r
l'rosh, his 1947 team made a fa
showing. At the Los Angeles Coli
seum the Stanford two-mile relay
team amazed everyone by taking y.
third place in the fast time of 3:1"
Also Bud Held tossed the javelin.
212 ft. 10 in. in the West Coast Re
lays. The frosh broke three Star
lord records in 1947.
What will happen this year, r.o
one can be sure. The Indians have
yet to win their first conference
meet since the war. Coach Weiers
hauser says, "So go 10 sophomores,
so goes Stanford in "48."
