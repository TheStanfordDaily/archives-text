# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Re: Policy 
### 
Every new Daily editor is deluged from the moment of his
election with questions about "policy." What stand will The
Daily take on international groups? What will The Daily say
about Excom's abolishing SIRO's relief work? Are you going
to decry the Administration's athletic policy? What do you think
about everything from the Marshall Plan to whether or not La
gunita will have water in it this year?
Although we feel that you—who purchase and read our news
paper —have a right to inquire into the management of The Daily,
il is difficult to lay down a hard-and-fast policy which can apply
to every situation.
We can't tell you at this point what we think about some
problem that will come up in a few days or weeks.
We can't tell you now what we think about current problems
—until we have investigated that specific problem. Then, we
can and will make our opinion plain through the editorial col
umns of The Daily.
A year ago, Daily Editor Newt Wise was confronted with the
same questions as to policy. He listed the functions of The Daily
this way:
1. Primarily, it should be an accurate source of daily informa
tion and events, well presented, for a community of 7,000 per
sons. (Now, 8,000).
2. Secondarily, a student paper must reflect the opinions of
the student body, either through accurate reporting, or compos
ite editorials.
3. Finally, a paper has a responsibility to its readers to try to
be a civic leader by making suggestions through its editorial
columns.
That comes pretty close to expressing our view of "policy."
If you are interested in Daily policy, you probably want to
know how it is formed.
Once a week the editorial board meets. It is probably more
representative of the entire campus than any other similar body
at Stanford. Two members are women; the other three, men.
Two live in university residences, two on the Row, and another
in the Village. Two of them attend Excom each week.
All are influenced not only by their own living groups but
also by the other members of the staff. The staff represents
every group and faction on campus. Radicals and reactionaries.
Controversial questions are brought up before edit board and
discussed. They are then assigned to the member best qualified
to write on the question. We feel that this is the best way to
arrive at a satisfactory solution. (Incidentally, all unsigned edit
orials are by the Editor, the remainder are by other members of
edit board).
You are the people who read The Daily. If you don't like
the paper we put out, let us know. We welcome constructive
criticism and honest opinion.
