To the Editor:
Re the current nominations for short term Excom representative from
District XII. It seems that either The Daily or the election board is
slightly confused. Listed as one of the three nominees is Jack Steiner.
According to the Bawlout there is no Jack Steiner attending Stanford
let alone living in Excom District XII (Village 200 & 300 Houses). The
man nominated is Jack Steiwer, House 312.
But the question remains as to who is responsible for checking on
the eligibility of the candidates and the correct spelling of their names.
—GORDY YATES.
(Both are responsible. Election Ivoard checks die eligibility oi candi
dates. The Daily attempts to spell all najnes, whether candidate*
or not. correctly.—Ed.)
