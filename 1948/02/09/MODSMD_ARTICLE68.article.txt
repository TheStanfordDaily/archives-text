CHICAGO (UP) â€”The trend of commodity mar
ket trading this week may indicate whether a gen
eral decline in retail food prices is around the cor
ner, some experts said today.
Commodity prices, led by a severe break in grains,
registered huge drops during the past week and
there were a few cracks in scattered cities in some
retail food prices. However, retailers and economists
said it was too early to determine whether the retail
reductions, mostly on perishable and other quick
turn-over items, resulted from consumer resistance
or from the market slump.
A spokesman for the Chicago Association of Re
tail Grocers said that this week may tell the story.
If wheat prices stay down or drop further, drop in
prices of other commodities, principally bread, prob
ably will follow, he said.
Wheat and corn extended their record declines
on the Chicago Board of Trade before the exchange
closed yesterday for the weekend but generally the
markets showed more resistance to selling pressure
than at any time since the price break began last
Wednesday.
At one time Saturday, May wheat touched $2.42,
off a total of 52 cents a bushel since Wednesday's
high. Traders said that was the largest decline in
four days in the exchange's 100-year history.
