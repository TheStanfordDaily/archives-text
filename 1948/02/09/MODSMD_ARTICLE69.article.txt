WASHINGTON (UP)—The American public,
worried about high prices and domestic politics, is
still apathetic about the Marshal Plan.
This apparently is true despite the fact that the
State Department says that "no Marshall Plan" means
that Europe will sink into such "violence and an
archy" that no democratic government can survive
in Europe.
State Department officials have come reluctantly
to the conclusion that the public is apathetic because,
out of an average of 5.000 letters a week seeking in
formation on foreign policy, the State Department
receives only about 200 inquiries about the "Mar
shall Plan."
Thus only four percent of the people interested
enough in foreign affairs to write their government
about it are interested in asking about the Marshall
Plan. This figure comes a few weeks after a na
tionwide poll showed that more than half the people
didn't know what the "Marshall Plan"—envisaging
$17,000,000,000 of U.S. expenditures—was.
These facts cause concern in official circles be
cause:
1. There has been eight months of international
and national discussion of the plan—ever since Sec
retary of State George C. Marshall suggested it at
Harvard last June 5.
2. Five weeks of intensive and comprehensive
Congressional hearings have just ended.
3. The State Department has published more than
25 pounds of official documents, data and explana
tions of the plan.
4. The public press has printed millions of words
and commentary about the program.
The public apathy is a striking contrast to some
of the other recent major policy issues. For example,
the department was swamped with letters on the
anti-Russian "Truman Doctrine" a year ago. And
during the United Nations debate on Palestine last
fall the deluge was terrific.
Marshall himself has stated time and again that
the decision the United States is about to make on
he "Marshall Plan" probably is the most important
foreign policy move in American hisory.
