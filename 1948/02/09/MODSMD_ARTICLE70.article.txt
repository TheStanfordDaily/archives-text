MOSCOW, Feb. 8 (UP) â€”Izvestia and Pravda,
Russia's two largest newspapers, devoted about 30
percent of their space today to the United States and
Great Britain, including dispatches intimating that
last week's decline in the American commodity and
stock markets might be the forerunners of a much
larger economic slump.
The dispatches on the American economic situa
tion. which took up two columns in each newspaper,
were mostly from the official news agency Tass.
Tass. in quoting from American newspapers, em
phasized that their comment expressed fear that the

slump presaged "a sharp turn in the economic situa
tion." These quotations were tW in with warnings
by President Truman and British Prime Minister
Clement R. Atlee that inflation might bring a crash.
The American decline "has increased the fear of
manufacturers who for a long time have expected
the collapse of the postwar boom," Tass said. The
agency reported that some consumer goods indus
tries were cutting down production. It said Rus
sian readers might attach great significance to
this, because of recent reports that Russia was in
creasing production of consumer goods.
"Newspapers which reflect the views of big man
ufacturers are inclined still more than formerly to
place big hopes upon the Marshall Plan as a means
of supporting the shaky economical situation," Tass
said.
Other editorials and articles said: that the United
States was restoring German militarism; that the
Western Allies were forming a bloc of countries
including Germany; that American "imperialism"
was trying to draw Finland into its web, and that
the United States was negotiating to include Spain
in the Marshall Plan.
