Senator Taft is against Universal Military Train
ing and the alternative he proposes is "an expert tech
nical reserve," particularly an expanded National
Guard.
Since the good Senator Taft is not qualified to
pass on military matters of his own knowledge, not
having had training or experience in that line, we
presume that he is relying upon the knowledge of
someone who is qualified to make decisions on mili
tary matters.
He could not, however, be relying upon the United
States' number one soldier, George C. Marshall, for
that authority said two years ago when he was Chief
of Staff of the United States Army:
"Men learn to fire a rifle or machine gun quickly,
but it takes long hours of maneuver before the firing
of the rifle is coordinated with the activities of more
than 14,000 other men."
"An unbroken period of one year's training ap
pears essential to the success of a sound security
plan based on the concept of a citizen army.
Marshall's explanation of the facts of military life
is backed up by George Fielding Eliot. In the first
place, the National Guard, now authorized to have
080,000 officers and men, never will reach its quota
unless it can be combined with UMT. The training
given in the National Guard, consisting of 48 drills
a year and two weeks continuous training, allows
little in the way of unit training. The National Guard
itself requires long continuous unit training such as
it can receive only in a universal military program.
So. Mr. Tait's plan would leave the reservists
still needing one year's military training after the
United States was attacked by an enemy. Military
specialists have said that atomic warfare may bring
the next war to a decision within a few weeks; at
the best, the United States would not have a year's
grace in which to prepare.
Marshall's plan is to be ready at the very moment
of need. I believe that this is the best plan.
