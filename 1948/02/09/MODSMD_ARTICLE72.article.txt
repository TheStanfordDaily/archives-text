ROME (UP) —Pope Pius XII, calling the atomic
bomb ''the most terrible arm which the human mind
has thus far conceived,"- xirged today that the use
of atomic energy for warlike purposes be outlawed.
But in a scholarly address to the Pontifical Acad
emy of Sciences, the Pope warmly praised those
men who harnessed atomic energy, and those ex
tending back for 100 years whose pioneer work made
the harnessing possible.
"What disasters should humanity await from fu
ture conflict if it should prove impossible to halt
or brake the use of newer and more scientific inven
tions?" the Pope asked.
The Pope pointed out that man's knowledge of
the disintegration of the atom thus far was not com
plete, though a way had been found to unleash its v
energy. He expressed the hope that atomic energy
would be used solely for peace and to "give to the
progress of civilization its rich resources of energy."
