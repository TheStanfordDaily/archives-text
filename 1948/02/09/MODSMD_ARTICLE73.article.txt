## BULL SESSION 
### 
Hadn't bumped into George for so long I thought
he'd quit his plumbing studies and his job at the
asbestos works and gone back to Delfmire, which is
where he came from last September. But there he
was, waddling down the steps of the Union, with
his shovel over his shoulder and his mustache glisten
ing with apple juice.
"Hi. George!" I exclaimed.
"H'lo," said George.
'"Haven't seen you in a long time." said I. "Where
are you living now?"
"Pup tent just this side of Half Moon
"Great Scott! Why?"
"Cheaper. Cost? too much at the Village."
"Don't be silly, George. The Village is a commun
ity enterprise."
"Yup." agreed George. He swigged some juice
and laid his shovel in the trash barrel while he ex
plained. "Went in for a little lunch at the coffee
room t'other day—"
"The little place where it takes seven nickles to
work tiie juke box and where they won't let yuu in
unless you promise to throw away your papers and

stack the cups and clean off the table top and push
in the chairs and . .
"Yup." said George. "Got hungry so I ate a couple
cheeseburgers and a malt. Had a little tiny two
dipper sundae for dessert. T'weren't much, but I
had to buy some shoes."
"How- much did two burgers, a malt, and a little
sundae cost?"
"$1.40."
"ONE DOLLAR AND FORTY CENTS?"
"Yup."
"You cleaned up the tables, stacked the cups,
threw away the wrappers, replaced the chairs, got
Spike Jones instead of Dinah Shore, and when you
ate that little lunch off the counter, you—"
"Yup."
"Well." I said after the shock had worn thin,
"since nobody makes any money on the Village I d
sure hate to eat that same little meal downtown
at one of those regular commercial restaurants th;.t
are out to make money."
"Commercial resaurant is forty-two cents cheap
er," said George.
