# IIR to Hold Open Houses For Students
## 
### 
The Institute of International Re
lations will hold open houses today, !
tomorrow, and Wednesday from 3:30 j
to 5 p.m. in the lIR office, at the !
other end of the Quad shack, to ac
quaint students with the work that
lIR does, according to Erskine Chil
ders, lIR Council member.
A great many positions are open
now in the international groups, he !
said, and any who are interested are j
urged to attend the open houses.
"We are particularly anxious for j
the foreign students on campus to
come," Childers continued.
LIST ELECTION
Elections for president, vice-pres
ident, treasurer, and executive sec- i
retary of the lIR Executive Coun
cil will be held Thursday, he said.
The Executive Council is also com
posed of the chairmen of its com
i ponent organizations, which are the
I "I" Club, SIRO, ICC, IDG. ISC, and
UNESCO. \
Some of the work of these organi
zations in the past year includes the
Stanford Relief Fund Drive con
, ducted by SIRO, which sends relief
supplies to the war-torn countries
! as its regular activity; the Western
College Congress on Soviet-Ameri
! can Relations; and the survey team
which toured Europe last summer
and reported on conditions there to
the student body.
FUTURE PLANS
The International Club, which
has a membership of over 80 for
eign and American students, is also
a member of lIR. Present active
plans include the forthcoming Unit
! Ed Nations Week on campus, the
Stanford UNESCO chapter's pro
gram of information and assistance
for students on foreign education,
travel and transportation, work
projects abroad, correspondence, and
scholarships.
Childers emphasized that the in
ternational groups are all-student
: affairs supported only by the ASSU
! yet they are probably better known
' outside the campus than here. They
j are in touch with international or
ganizations .throughout the world
j and have received numerous letters
i of congratulation from leading in
ternational figures.
