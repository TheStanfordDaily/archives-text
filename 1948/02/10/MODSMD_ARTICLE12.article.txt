# Munk and Bletz Wind Up United Nations Bull Session Finally Agreeing on Basic Causes for Failure of UN
## 
### 
A! Munk and Allan Bletz. the
battling Bull - Sessioners, averted
coming to blows last night as their
third and final series of Monday
night United Nations discussions
produced agreement in at least one
phase of their attempt to place the
blame for UN failure.
Up to last night Munk had stead
fastly maintained that Soviet Rus
sia, through its defensive expanâ€”
sionism in Eastern Europe, was re
sponsible for undermining the work
and purpose of the UN; Bletz, in
opposition, held fast to the theory
that the United States, through its
failure to take the initial steps to
ward disarmament, was for its part
contributing greatly to the failure

| of the United Nations.
At last .night's meeting, well at
! tended by well-known campus re
| actionaries and radicals and liberals.
I the final summation saw Munk and
I Bletz, after heated argument, reach
| agreement on the basic causes of
| UN failure:
(1) The unwillingness of civilized
nations today to surrender any part
of their sovereignty to the common
cause.
(2) The inability of nations to
reach agreement upon universal
disarmament.
(3) The mutual distrust existing
among the powers today which in
its turn makes for hostilities instead

| of accord of the type necessary for
j UN world co-operation.
During the last three meetings the
I attending groups have approxi
mately split in their support of the
I two speakers' viewpoints, and have
| shown sufficient campus interest in
1 the UN problem to expect that the
visit on Feb. 20 of Warren Austin,
! U.S. delegate to the UN, will re
ceive widespread campus approval.
The success of these discussions
has also resulted in the planning of
future "Bull Sessions" by Munk
and Bletz on subjects of general in
terest to the campus which will be
carried on in the individual living
groups as desired.
