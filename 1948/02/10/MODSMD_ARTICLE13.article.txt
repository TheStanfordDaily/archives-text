## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Vacancies in Men's Council, Women's Council, Excom, and
SAC will be filled through the Winter Election finals tomorrow.
Two members of Excom, and representatives of Union-Branner
and Village 200-300 districts will be chosen.
Referring to widespread apathy apparent in last week's prim
aries, Election Board Publicity Chairman Jean Burnet said:
"Tomorrow's election is one of the most important of the year
and most students don't seem to realize it. Capable members in
each of the organizations to be voted upon are our only assur
ance of well-administered self government.
"Men's and Women's Councils are the keystone of student
government," she added.
In an effort to impress the importance of tomorrow's voting
upon the 85 percent of the student body which failed to vote in
the primaries, Election Board is conducting an intensified cam
paign to acquaint Farm students with both the candidates for
offices and the positions they will hold.

Four out of five members will be
elected to Men's Council, the student
group which tries and metes ou*
punishments for Honor Code viola
tions, social misdemeanors, and traf
fic violations.
It is the sole authority for ad
ministrative cases under its juris
diction. Administration officials ac:
on the recommendations of tht
lIONOK CODE
"The Honor Code forms the back
bone of the jurisdiction and power
of Men's Council," said Jim Welch,
chairman of the Council. "Although
it is only a section of the Funda
mental Standard, the sections ap
plicable to student conduct are rela
tively easy to determine and to in
terpret. Interpretation of the Honor
Code is considerably more complex.
"For this reason the men that you
elect to Men's Council must be re
sponsible men. They must be fair
and just. They must be qualified tc
interpret the Honor Code reason
ably and sensibly. If they should be
come imbued with a sense of power
which in itself is detrimental to their
office, it reflects upon you, the vot
ers."
WHO JUDGES?
Suppose you, the reader, should be
accused of an Honor Code violation.
By what type of person do you wish
to be judged? By the jovial chap
who understands little about the
office that he holds and is not inter
ested in learning about it, or by the
student who would, if elected, be
interested in the position, who has
already expressed this interest, and
Who would serve conscientiously
and to the best of his ability?
"Responsibility to elect qualified
men to Men's Council rests with the
voters. If you do not exercise your
judgment wisely, or if you do not
vote, any failure on the part of
Men's Council is your failure and to
you belongs the blame." he con
cluded.

of Men's Council," said Jim Welch,
chairman of the Council. "Although
it is only a section of the Funda
mental Standard, the sections ap
plicable to student conduct are rela
tively easy to determine and to in
terpret. Interpretation of the Honor
Code is considerably more complex.
"For this reason the men that you
elect to Men's Council must be re
sponsible men. They must be fair
and just. They must be qualified tc
interpret the Honor Code reason
ably and sensibly. If they should be
come imbued with a sense of power
which in itself is detrimental to their
office, it reflects upon you, the vot
ers."
WHO JUDGES?
Suppose you, the reader, should be
accused of an Honor Code violation.
By what type of person do you wish
to be judged? By the jovial chap
who understands little about the
office that he holds and is not inter
ested in learning about it, or by the
student who would, if elected, be
interested in the position, who has
already expressed this interest, and
Who would serve conscientiously
and to the best of his ability?
"Responsibility to elect qualified
men to Men's Council rests with the
voters. If you do not exercise your
judgment wisely, or if you do not
vote, any failure on the part of
Men's Council is your failure and to
you belongs the blame." he con
cluded.
(To be concluded tomorrow)
Vacancies in Men's Council, Women's Council, Excom, and
SAC will be filled through the Winter Election finals tomorrow.
Two members of Excom, and representatives of Union-Branner
and Village 200-300 districts will be chosen.
Referring to widespread apathy apparent in last week's prim
aries, Election Board Publicity Chairman Jean Burnet said:
"Tomorrow's election is one of the most important of the year
and most students don't seem to realize it. Capable members in
each of the organizations to be voted upon are our only assur
ance of well-administered self government.
"Men's and Women's Councils are the keystone of student
government," she added.
In an effort to impress the importance of tomorrow's voting
upon the 85 percent of the student body which failed to vote in
the primaries, Election Board is conducting an intensified cam
paign to acquaint Farm students with both the candidates for
offices and the positions they will hold.

Four out of five members will be
elected to Men's Council, the student
group which tries and metes ou*
punishments for Honor Code viola
tions, social misdemeanors, and traf
fic violations.
It is the sole authority for ad
ministrative cases under its juris
