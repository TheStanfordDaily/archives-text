# Beef, Pork Prices Slump; Grain Sales Rally Strong
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 9 (UP)—Prices
of beef and pork-on-the-hoof crack
ed today in the biggest drop in live
stock prices in 16 months, but grains
rebounded in a strong rally after a
four-day price slump.
The nosedive in livestock prices
was good news for the housewives,
paving the way for possible further
cuts in beef and pork prices at
neighborhood butcher shops. But it
was bad news for farmers.
Thousands of farmers held hogs
and steers they had fattened on corn
at soaring prices. Their profit mar
gin was cut when the market broke.
Excessive receipts at all markets in
the face of sagging consumer de
mand forced beef steers $1 to $3
lower, and hogs $2 to $3.50 lower.
All corn for future delivery, ex

cept May rose the full eight-cent
limit permitted in a day's trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Wheat was up as much as eight
cents a bushel.
The New York Stock Market,
where traders were keeping a close
watch on commodities, closed irreg
ular.
An increasing number of cities
across the nation reported reduc
tions in retail prices of pork, beef,
lard, butter, flour and bread, with
some of the decreases attributed di
rectly to the sharp price break on
major commodity makets last week.
Some retailers reported that they
were taking losses on some items
because wholesale prices had not
yet been adjusted to the market
trends, retail spokesmen said.
