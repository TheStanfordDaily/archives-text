WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP).—The revolt of
Southern Democrats flared anew today with
threats to block the election of President Truman
coming soon after a White House denial that he
| might placate the rebels by modifying his civil

rights program.
The threat was raised in a lonu
and virulent speech by Sen. Jame.-
O. Eastland, D.. Miss. He called the
President's anti-discrimination pro
gram "racial demagoguery" iiks
that of the "carpetbaggers" of post-
Civil War days.
East!and proposed a formula by
which he said the' Southern states
could dictate the Democratic Presi
dential nominee or even elect its
own candidate. This could be done,
he asserted, by withholding the
South's electoral votes.
A high Senate source close to the
President told the United Press yes
terday that the President might
make a new statement reiterating
his call for anti-lynching, anti-poll
tax, and fair employment legisla
tion, but dropping his, request fo l
anti-Jim Crow laws for interstate
transportation.
White House Press Secretar
Charles G. Ross said today, how
ever, the report was "absolutely"
untrue.
Sen. J. Howard McGrath, D.. R. 1..
chairman of the Democratic Nation
al Committee, also said he had not
heard of any modification plans and
"I must accept the program as the
President outlined it."


PRESIDENT HARRY S. TRU
MAN. who yesterday received the
support of the California Demo
cratic party.
