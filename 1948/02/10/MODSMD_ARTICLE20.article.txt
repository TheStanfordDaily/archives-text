# Mine Owners Hit 'Wildcat Strikes'
## 
### 
'WASHINGTON. Feb. 9 (UP)-
The Southern Coal Producers Asso
ciation served notice tonight that
they will treat "wildcat strikes" b\
John L. Lewis' United Mine Work
ers as violations of their contract
Joseph Moody, association presi
dent, said the Southern mine own
ers had voted to "insist" that Lewi
abide by the present contract which
provides for settlemetn of all griev
ances through collective bargaining
with his men staying on the job.
"We will insist on the return of
the men to work and a recognitior
on the part of the union of the
grievance procedures outlined in the
contract," Moody said. "If the union
refuses to recognize these proced
ures, then our members will immed
iately appeal to the National Labo.
Relations Board for relief under th
Taft-Hartley law."'
Specifically, he said, the compan
ies would charge the UMW with
refusal to bargain—an unfair laboi
practice under the new labor-man
agement law.
The Southern producers represent
about one-third of the soft coa
industry. Their announcement an
swered Lewis' threat that he intend
to enforce—"with independent ac
tion"—his demand for $100 a monf
pensions for his miners.
