## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Feb. 9 (UP).-The
secretary - general of the Arab
League said today armed interven
tion in Palestine will expose the
United Nations to "calamity" and
end the UN as a moral and peace
ful force in the world.
Abdul Rahman Azzam Bey,
League secretary, answered Sen.
Owen Brewster's (R., Me.) call lor
intervention by force by denouncing
U.S. "Senators and politicians" who
high-pressured UN members into
supporting partition.
These "Senators and politicians"
have asked the UN to become an
"instrument of violence," to get in
volved in a civil war which may
last for years, Azzam asserted. He
also blamed election year propa
ganda.
At the same time, well-informed
sources said the seven-state Arab
League had decided to delay a full
scale invasion of Palestine until the
British withdraw.
A campaign for combatting Jews
in Palestine in the remaining
months of British rule will be plan
ned at a meeting of the League's
political committee late today, well
informed sources reported.
The League's military and politi
cal committees were said to have
recognized the fact that the Arab
army of liberation cannot invade
the Holy Land as long as British
troops remain in the country.
The plan under consideration
provides for Arab fighters to oc
cupy Palestine towns and villages
as the British pull out. it was said.
League circles were secretive
about the number of Arab fighters
who have infiltrated Palestine from
neighboring states, but it was es
timated conservatively that about
5.00 to 6,000 have crossed the fron
tiers.
Border crossings continue each
day, and the Arabs will be absorbed
by the liberation army when Pales
tine is invaded, it was said.
