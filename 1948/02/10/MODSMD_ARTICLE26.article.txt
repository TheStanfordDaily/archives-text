### 
MOSCOW, Tuesday, Fell. 10 (UP)
—Soviet Russia charged today that
the responsibility for World War II
lay on the shoulders of the United
States, Great Britain and France.
In a 6,000-word statement reply
ing to the secret documents on Rus
sian-German diplomatic relations
made public by the United States
last month, Russia charged that a
"golden rain of American dollars"
built up Adolf Hitler's war machine
and that Anglo-French appeasement
put Germany in a position to strike.
Had Germany been without U. S.
capitalistic support and with a firm
policy of collective security from
England and France, the note said,
World War II would have been end
ed in the first year.
The Soviet note, entitled "Falsi
fiers of History—A Historical Note,"
was a blunt reply to the publication
by the State Department of cap
tured German foreign office records
dealing with Soviet-German diplo
macy leading up to the Nazi attack
on Poland.
Issued by the Soviet information
bureau by order of the Council of
Ministers, the Soviet note said it
shortly would release a second sec
lion consisting of secret documents,
allegedly concealed by the western
powers, "concerning the relations
between Hitler Germany and the
governments of Great Britain, the
United States and France."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP)—
The State Department maintained
official silence tonight about Soviet
Russia's denunciation of the recent
ly published Nazi-Soviet documents.
The department had received no
official word from the embassy in
Moscow, but the United Press dis
patch was hustled to the highest
officials as it arrived.
No reaction from the department
is expected until the fu'.x text has
arrived here or advicr from U. S.
Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith is
received.
The department, however, can be
expected to brush aside the Soviet
comment as expected. Some Ameri
can officials were fully aware that
publication of the documents telling
about Nazi-Soviet negotiations in
1939 might touch off a bitter propa
ganda war inasmuch as the Rus
sians probably have documents
damaging to some of the other Al
lies.
