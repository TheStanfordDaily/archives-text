# Gobbledygook—Double Talk-Garbles Document
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8 (UP).—
There's an invisible man in Wash
ington who peeks over the shoulders
of government officials while they're
dictating public documents and
changes their little words into big
ones.
He makes everyday words like
"housing" into "domiciliary facili
ties."
This literary leprechaun, long ago
christened Gobbledygook, has taken
double-talk, wrapped it up in fog,
and made it part of the language
of government.
Mr. G. shows up at the White
House, the Treasury, the State De
partment, in Congress, and any
where else that officials foregather
to draft their prose.
MUMBLES SAID
He got in a few good licks in
President Truman's recent budget
message, dropping in twisters like
"in excess of requirements" where
the President meant "too much,"
and "acquisition price" instead of
"cost."
Some of the President's cabinet
aides have even more trouble with
the little man.
Secretary of the Treasury John
W. Snyder might count it a good
day when "implementation" or "uti
lization" doesn't creep into one of
his statements as the gobbledygook
equivalent of "use."
The State Department has its own
peculiar troubles with words like
"maximization" that crop up instead
of "make the most of," "expedite"
for "hurry up," and that old Wash
ington stand-by "short supply" for
"scarce."
SURPRISE TO WEBSTER
Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach came up with "du
plicator}'" the other day. It prob
ably rolls off the palate better than
"duplicating," but it doesn't appear
in Mr. Webster's newest and big
gest dictionary.
The Civil Aeronautics Board has
always been a happy hunting
ground for the word-twisters. When
James Landis was its chairman—he
coined, rightly or wrongly, "termi
nation of illumination" for "lights
out"—the CAB thought nothing of
reporting that the most common
cause of airplane fatalities was "col
lision with terrain."
Probably the most shop - worn
phrase of all is "studying all phases
of the situation." It translates into:
"We're as confused as you are;
come back tomorrow."
