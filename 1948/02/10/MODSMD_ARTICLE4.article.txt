If baggage addressed to you at
Stanford lias never arrived, it may
be. paradoxically, because it has
gone to Stanford, California—
which, for the Southern Pacific, is
still a small freight station north
of Donner in the Sierras.
This was disclosed yesterday by
Southern Pacific Freight Agent C.
A. Stone of Palo Alto as he asked
for a quick halt to the use of
Stanford as a freight address.
Stone is trying to get rid of the
Stanford (Donner Pass) station,
but in the meantime he urged
that the Palo Alto station with a
Stanford sub-address be used for
shipping.
