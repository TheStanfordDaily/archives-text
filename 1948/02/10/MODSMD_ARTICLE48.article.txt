## OLYMPICS Americans Pay Plenty For Medals 
### 
ST. MORITZ, Feb. 9 (UP).--Unit
ed States Olympic officials dug deep
into their pockets tonight to settle
the mountainous bills left behind
by their departed athletes, and back
of their polite official smiles there
was plenty of private grumbling.
Although the Americans declared
officially that they are "completely
satisfied with everything" in the
Fifth Winter Olympiad, it was no
secret that they felt the costs in
curred in the winning of three
Olympic gold medals were some
what. exorbitant.
YANKS CiRIPE
Chief sources of the American
squawks were: (1) the bookkeeping
systems employed by continental
hotels; (2) the Europeans' lack of
showmanship in competition; (3)
Swiss gate-keepers; and (4) the
public address system at the winter
games.
And although none of these com
plaints were regarded as major
ones. U.S. Olympic officials hoped
the situation would be improved in
the 1£52 winter games at Oslo, Nor
way.
PAY FOR EXTRAS'
The Americans' Olympic budget
was knocked haywire by those in
evitable "extras" which all Ameri
can tourists in Europe learn about
through bitter experience. The ath
letes were charged for milk they
never drank, officials said, along
with fancy breakfasts which they
perhaps ordered but shouldn't have
been served. There also were hosts
of charges for baths and small serv
ices which ordinarily are free in
American hotels.
As for European showmanship,
the Americans suggested more
imagination and ingenuity. One of
ficial pointed out that the Swiss
could have taken a few lessons in
the art of promotion from Madison
Square Garden or other big U.S.
sports spectacles.
One of the most mystifying an
gles to Americans was the failure of
Swiss gate - keepers to check on
tickets and passes at the winter
games. As one U.S. ocial put it,
there must have been scores of am
ateur "One - eye Connollys" who
walked in free and unmolested, thus
cutting down the gate receipts and
hitting the competitors' budgets.
