# Indians Hosts to Bruins, Trojans This Weekend
## 
### JOHN HALL 
The varsity cagers were back at hard work yesterday with
high hopes of being at top strength lor the SC-UCLA invasion
from the south this weekend. USC and UCLA are tied for second
place in the conference, having won two and lost two, while
Stanford is in the cellar with no wins and four losses.
In the earlier meetings with these teams in Los Angeles,

Stanford lost both games. Now the
Farm is looking for its first confer
ence wins, with a good chance of
overtaking either SC or UCLA,
The Cards have not had a PCC
game since their last meeting with
Cal on Jan. 17, but since then, they
have been impressive in winning
four and in losing one to Bradley
Tech. Last weekend they had a
bye.
Coach Dean, worried about the
Bruin fast break, had his men
working most on defense and es
pecially keeping them alert for fast
breaks. Dave Davidson and Babe
Higgins looked effective in breaking
up several plays.
When the first string took over
offense. Bill Rose was very sharp in
connecting with his best shot from
just outside the foul circle. Morley
Thompson also put in some nice
baskets working from the other
side.
Dean was alternating his men in
two units, the first combining Hig
gins, Davidson. Stephenson, Rose,
and Lewis. The second combination
j was Chavalas, Yardley, Iverson,
i Penn, and Thompson.
IJRL'INS BRKAK FAST
UCLA has a fast team that uses a
i pressing defense to run other teams
â€¢ dizzy, and on certain nights ihey
can get hot enough to beat any
body. In Johnny Stanich, the Bru
ins have one of the highest scorers
'.on the coast, and Dave Minor keeps
things going when Stanich isn't hit
ting.
In the first game against UCLA,
Stanford led for most of the first
half, but when the Bruins put on
the press, Stanford wilted. Guy
Buccola did most of the damage
when he made three long shots in
a row to give UCLA a three-point
lead at half-time.
'II CARDS WIN . . .'
USC's first win over the Cards
was just one of those Trojan lucky
breaks. Stanford had been leading
the entire game, when Bill Shar
man, SC forward, got warm enough
to tie up the ball game with some
fancy shooting. Then, with only a
i couple of minutes remaining, SC got
: two buckets to win.
If Stanford can win both games
j this weekend, it could possibly
: throw them into a three-way tie for
second place. That \yould be the
case, should California also win
both games.


JOHN STANICII, the Bruins'
high scoring forward, will lead
the UCLA team onto the floor
when the Westwooders meet the
Indians in the Pavilion Friday
night.
