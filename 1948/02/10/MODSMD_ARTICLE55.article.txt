# DAILY EDITORIALS
## The 						'New Look" 
### 
Queries have been coming into the Shack regarding the new
tabloid-size Daily. We have replied that the paper will continue
in its present format for the remainder of the volume. To those
who wonder why, we offer the following reasons:
1. Eight smaller-size pages enable us to departmentalize
the news. Every morning you will find the most important cam
pus and world events on page one. Page two will contain na
tional news; page three, international; page four, more campus
news. Dances, reviews, features, and entertainment will fill
page five. Pages six and seven are sports, and the last page
contains editorials, letters to the editor, columns, and interpre
tive articles. You can quickly find the pages which have stories
of interest to you.
2. Tabloid-size newspapers are easier to read at breakfast,
in class, or in the Cellar.
3. Each article will be more prominent. Because of the small
er number of stories on each page, each one is more quickly seen.
4. With more pages, The Daily locks more like a professional
newspaper. Four large pages of bulletin board material has a
high-schoolish appearance.
5. The tabloid size allows us to concentrate more on writing
and less on make-up. The Daily will be easier and more enjoy
able to read.
We think you're going to like the "NEW LOOK" in The Daily.
