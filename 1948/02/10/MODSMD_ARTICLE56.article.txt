## Let's Back SIRO 
### 
To the Editor:
The action of Excom in voting to abolish SIRO seems to have reversed
the avowed student policy of wanting direct personal association with
European schools and peoples and of making Stanford an internationally
known institution. Student manager Mitguard questions whether or not
the relief could be performed more econmically by an internationally
known organization. In so far as postage is concerned, undoubtedly yes.
However, as I recall, the main reason for the sojourn of two Stanford
students to Europe this summer was to promote personal relations and get
information about the status of various schools. The information could
very easily have been gathered by a few well placed letters. The obvious
conclusion is that Stanford wants the personal contacts, and Excom
appropriated $2,000 for the trip.
If I were a needy European student, I believe I would have a more
favorable impression of a university that sent me a relief package than
one who sent a representative on an inspection trip.
Come on Excom! Let's back SIRO and Molly Shaw.
