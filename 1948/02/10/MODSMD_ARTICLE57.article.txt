# Less Clamor, More Debate

To the Editor:
It was in exceedingly bad taste that the Stanford Daily printed
excerpts from the report of the President's Committee on Civil Rights.
Coming only a week after the Dean's explicit statement forbidding cam
pus participation .in national jwlitics, this article seems to imply that the
University's ruling is a suppression of free assemblage for the discussion
of national issues. Nothing could be further from the truth. For. as the
Dean says, the University encourages such discussions when conducted
by the dozen-or-so members of the Stanford Debating Society.
The President's Committee on Civil Rights cannot possibly under
stand the specific conditions on the Stanford campus which make full
observance ot the principles of the U. S. Constitution unfeasible. Let us
have less clamor for impracticable civil liberty and more attendance of
the discussions of the Stanford Debating Society.
