To the Editor:
Having been inspired for nearly two quarters now by the intelligent
and far-sighted views of such international experts as Victor Kaupus.
Neil McLean and numerous others in your Campus Opinion section. I
ieel that we owe them a vote of thanks.
I feel that we should thank them for their tremendous insight into the
world situation around them, that permits them to see so clearly that any
attempt toward a peaceful world depends on trying to see both sides
01 a situation, not blindly attacking something they teel must he attacked.
We should thank them for their admirable restraint in not labeling
"Red" or "commie" anything that smacks of liberalism, as the common
trend seems to call lor that now-adays.
And we should thank them for ttieir excellent memory concerning
that holocause of the early 1940s now so distant. I'm sure they remember
what was said about war in thote days, about its causes, its effects, the
failure of the League of Nations, and the failure of the United States
and Great Britain after World War I. The privations, the wounds,
the deaths—l'm sure that the memories of these are clear in the minds
of those aforementioned who plead so eloquently for peace and under
standing among nations.
