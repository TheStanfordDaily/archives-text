WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) —Secretary of Agri
culture Clinton P. Anderson tonight denied Senator
Robert A. Taft's charge that the administration was
playing politics with grain prices. He accused Taft
of raising the issue "for political reasons."
Anderson said in a letter to Taft that the senator
"deliberately" misinterpreted a statement which he
(Anderson) issued last week as an administration
move to bolster the tumbling grain markets.
Taft commented Saturday that Anderson an
nounced the government was going to buy another
50,000,000 bushels of wheat for export and he said
that statement was intended to steady the market.
Anderson replied that he never said the govern
ment planned any such purchase, although he did
say it was "possible" that much might be bought for
export if livestock and poultry raisers curtailed their
iise of feed during the next five months.
"This possibility is far from being a plan," the
secretary said. "I feel your statement was made for
political reasons."
His brush with Taft put Anderson under attack
from two sides as a result of last week's grain market
slump.
Rep. Augustus H. Andresen, R., Minn., who has
accused the agriculture department of helping force
grain prices down, announced that his special house
committee on commodity speculation is going to con
duct a "full inquiry" into last week's market slump.
Anderson said the committee is going to expose
any speculators who may have profited as a result
of advance information obtained on the agriculture
department's grain buying program.
Anderson said yesterday that he couldn't very
well pay any attention to the Taft-Andresen charges,
since the department obviously couldn't be blamed
for pushing prices up and down simultaneously.
But in his letter to Taft, he rapped the Ohioan
for what he said was a deliberate misinterpretation
of the export buying report which he (Anderson)
issued on behalf of the agriculture department last
week.
"You charged that my statement was issued for
political reasons," said Anderson. "I am sure the
public understands that thexe are no political reasons
involved in complete public reports on the status
of grain exports."
He added that last week's announcement "as you
well know . . . indicated no change in the depart
ment of agriculture policy."
Andresen, in announcing the new Congressional
investigation, said Anderson will be asked to explain
his reported statement that word of the agriculture
department's decision to cut its grain export buying
leaked out in advance of last Thursday's official an
nouncement. He said the "leak" led a lot of "insiders"'
to sell short and get out of the tumbling markets
with a big profit.
Anderson, told by reporters about Andresen's
statement, said there never had been any leak, that
the information contained in the department's export
report Thursday already was well-known to com
modity traders.
He said Sen. Homer Ferguson, R„ Mich., of the
Senate appropriations committee had asked him if
he could provide any "leads" to explain the break
in prices.
"I told him I couldn't give him any leads,"
Anderson said.
Rep. Andresen said. "We're going to find out who
sold short. We've already begun to find that infor
mation."
Referring to Anderson's minimizing of the leak
angle today, Andresen said: "Apparently enough was
said to force grain prices down, and those who stayed
in tiie market and sold short made a pile of money."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) —President Truman
today asked Congress to continue controls over fats
and oils, rice, tin, antimony, cinchona bark, quinine,
quinidine and nitrogen fertilizers to prevent "con
fusion at home and abroad."
He said in a special message that failure to extend
the controls beyond their Feb. 29 expiration date
would endanger this country's ability to obtain tin
supplies and might "seriously hamper the attain
ment of United States foreign policy objectives."
The controls include power to regulate the export,
import, transportation and use of the specified items
in various ways. The President noted, however, that
power to control exports and transportation already
have been granted in the GOP anti-inflation law.
He said he had asked for power to control the im
port and use of the commodities as part of his broader
10-point anti-inflation program, most of which has
so far been cold-shouldered by Congress.
"It appears unlikely that a decision will be readied
by Feb. 29," the President said.

well pay any attention to the Taft-Andresen charges,
since the department obviously couldn't be blamed
for pushing prices up and down simultaneously.
But in his letter to Taft, he rapped the Ohioan
for what he said was a deliberate misinterpretation
of the export buying report which he (Anderson)
issued on behalf of the agriculture department last
week.
"You charged that my statement was issued for
political reasons," said Anderson. "I am sure the
public understands that thexe are no political reasons
involved in complete public reports on the status
of grain exports."
He added that last week's announcement "as you
well know . . . indicated no change in the depart
ment of agriculture policy."
Andresen, in announcing the new Congressional
investigation, said Anderson will be asked to explain
his reported statement that word of the agriculture
department's decision to cut its grain export buying
leaked out in advance of last Thursday's official an
nouncement. He said the "leak" led a lot of "insiders"'
to sell short and get out of the tumbling markets
with a big profit.
Anderson, told by reporters about Andresen's
statement, said there never had been any leak, that
the information contained in the department's export
report Thursday already was well-known to com
modity traders.
He said Sen. Homer Ferguson, R„ Mich., of the
Senate appropriations committee had asked him if
he could provide any "leads" to explain the break
in prices.
"I told him I couldn't give him any leads,"
Anderson said.
Rep. Andresen said. "We're going to find out who
sold short. We've already begun to find that infor
mation."
Referring to Anderson's minimizing of the leak
angle today, Andresen said: "Apparently enough was
said to force grain prices down, and those who stayed
in tiie market and sold short made a pile of money."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) —President Truman
today asked Congress to continue controls over fats
and oils, rice, tin, antimony, cinchona bark, quinine,
quinidine and nitrogen fertilizers to prevent "con
fusion at home and abroad."
He said in a special message that failure to extend
the controls beyond their Feb. 29 expiration date
would endanger this country's ability to obtain tin
supplies and might "seriously hamper the attain
ment of United States foreign policy objectives."
The controls include power to regulate the export,
import, transportation and use of the specified items
in various ways. The President noted, however, that
power to control exports and transportation already
have been granted in the GOP anti-inflation law.
He said he had asked for power to control the im
port and use of the commodities as part of his broader
10-point anti-inflation program, most of which has
so far been cold-shouldered by Congress.
"It appears unlikely that a decision will be readied
by Feb. 29," the President said.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) —Secretary of Agri
culture Clinton P. Anderson tonight denied Senator
Robert A. Taft's charge that the administration was
playing politics with grain prices. He accused Taft
of raising the issue "for political reasons."
Anderson said in a letter to Taft that the senator
"deliberately" misinterpreted a statement which he
(Anderson) issued last week as an administration
move to bolster the tumbling grain markets.
Taft commented Saturday that Anderson an
nounced the government was going to buy another
50,000,000 bushels of wheat for export and he said
that statement was intended to steady the market.
Anderson replied that he never said the govern
ment planned any such purchase, although he did
say it was "possible" that much might be bought for
export if livestock and poultry raisers curtailed their
iise of feed during the next five months.
"This possibility is far from being a plan," the
secretary said. "I feel your statement was made for
political reasons."
His brush with Taft put Anderson under attack
from two sides as a result of last week's grain market
slump.
Rep. Augustus H. Andresen, R., Minn., who has
accused the agriculture department of helping force
grain prices down, announced that his special house
committee on commodity speculation is going to con
duct a "full inquiry" into last week's market slump.
Anderson said the committee is going to expose
any speculators who may have profited as a result
of advance information obtained on the agriculture
department's grain buying program.
Anderson said yesterday that he couldn't very

Rep. Andresen said. "We're going to find out who
sold short. We've already begun to find that infor
mation."
Referring to Anderson's minimizing of the leak
angle today, Andresen said: "Apparently enough was
said to force grain prices down, and those who stayed
in tiie market and sold short made a pile of money."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) —President Truman
today asked Congress to continue controls over fats
and oils, rice, tin, antimony, cinchona bark, quinine,
quinidine and nitrogen fertilizers to prevent "con
fusion at home and abroad."
He said in a special message that failure to extend
the controls beyond their Feb. 29 expiration date
would endanger this country's ability to obtain tin
supplies and might "seriously hamper the attain
ment of United States foreign policy objectives."
The controls include power to regulate the export,
import, transportation and use of the specified items
in various ways. The President noted, however, that
power to control exports and transportation already
have been granted in the GOP anti-inflation law.
He said he had asked for power to control the im
port and use of the commodities as part of his broader
10-point anti-inflation program, most of which has
so far been cold-shouldered by Congress.
"It appears unlikely that a decision will be readied
by Feb. 29," the President said.
