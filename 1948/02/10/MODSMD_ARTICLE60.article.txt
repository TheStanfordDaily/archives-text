## HISTORY 1948 
### 
For a long time TYA, though brilliantly successful
in many ways, still had to fight hard for its life. It
had to fight against unscrupulous enemies, like Sen
ator McKellar, whose greedy objective was to get
his hands on TV A jobs for patronage purposes. It
had to fight against private power companies, who
feared its competitive influence. Now, however, TVA
is not only a settled institution, but it is world
famous.
Now, then, the question comes up of why does
not the TVA Board act to remove some of the points
of criticism that still exist? One of the chief points
that is under constant criticism is that TVA book
keeping differs from the bookkeeping of private
corporations.
Under this system of keeping the books exact com
parisons cannot be made between TVA costs and the
costs of private corporations. This criticism, even
though I am wholeheartedly behind the work of
this commission, is a good one.
For instance, at "a hearing on TVA finances, Sen
ators Ferguson of Michigan and Dvorak of Idaho
suggested that TVA ought to pay interest on the
$343,000,000 which it has borrowed from the govern
ment for development of its power facilities. High
TVA men had no convincing answer to this suggestion.
In the past, when the question of paying interest
came up, TVA's champions have answered that it
would be an absurdity for the government to pay
interest on money it is borrowing from itself. How
ever, a government corporation—which TVA is—is
not the same as the government itself. It is supported
by the government and is responsible to the govern
ment, but it is conducting a business operation.
Of course, it can be argued that for a government
corporation to pay interest on money borrowed from
the government would be a matter of form—it would
involve bookkeeping without any net change in the
government's assets.
But that argument shoots wide of the mark. TVA
operation is supposed to rival private business opera
tion and serve as a measure of the fairness of the
latter's rates. That being true, why shouldn't its
books be set up, so far as power is concerned, like
the books of a private corporation? Why shouldn't
interest be paid on the $343,000,000 at a rate that
private utilities must pay?
While there are certain aspects of TVA, such as
flood control, that are government functions, not
related in any way to private business, that is not
true of its power development.
I believe that TVA could set up its books to
parallel those of private corporations and still make
an admirable showing, both as to costs and to rates
charged. If it did so. TVA would silence many of
its remaining critics.

For instance, at "a hearing on TVA finances, Sen
ators Ferguson of Michigan and Dvorak of Idaho
suggested that TVA ought to pay interest on the
$343,000,000 which it has borrowed from the govern
ment for development of its power facilities. High
TVA men had no convincing answer to this suggestion.
In the past, when the question of paying interest
came up, TVA's champions have answered that it
would be an absurdity for the government to pay
interest on money it is borrowing from itself. How
ever, a government corporation—which TVA is—is
not the same as the government itself. It is supported
by the government and is responsible to the govern
ment, but it is conducting a business operation.
Of course, it can be argued that for a government
corporation to pay interest on money borrowed from
the government would be a matter of form—it would
involve bookkeeping without any net change in the
government's assets.
But that argument shoots wide of the mark. TVA
operation is supposed to rival private business opera
tion and serve as a measure of the fairness of the
latter's rates. That being true, why shouldn't its
books be set up, so far as power is concerned, like
the books of a private corporation? Why shouldn't
interest be paid on the $343,000,000 at a rate that
private utilities must pay?
While there are certain aspects of TVA, such as
flood control, that are government functions, not
related in any way to private business, that is not
true of its power development.
I believe that TVA could set up its books to
parallel those of private corporations and still make
an admirable showing, both as to costs and to rates
charged. If it did so. TVA would silence many of
its remaining critics.
For a long time TYA, though brilliantly successful
in many ways, still had to fight hard for its life. It
had to fight against unscrupulous enemies, like Sen
ator McKellar, whose greedy objective was to get
his hands on TV A jobs for patronage purposes. It
had to fight against private power companies, who
feared its competitive influence. Now, however, TVA
is not only a settled institution, but it is world
famous.
Now, then, the question comes up of why does
not the TVA Board act to remove some of the points
of criticism that still exist? One of the chief points
that is under constant criticism is that TVA book
keeping differs from the bookkeeping of private
corporations.
Under this system of keeping the books exact com
parisons cannot be made between TVA costs and the
costs of private corporations. This criticism, even
though I am wholeheartedly behind the work of
this commission, is a good one.
