## BULL SESSION 
### 
Well, another volume of the Stanford Daily has
gone by. and a tabioid has taken its place.
But Bull Session, like death, taxes, and Louella
Parsons, is still with us.
I wonder how the obscensorship will be this
volume. Last volume (you may have guessed) I
had only one line that I thought was funny—the
kind of line that makes people slap their knees and
guffaw like the first three rows at the Capitol Bur
lesque.
The story in mind contained the name of a fac
ulty member and also a dirty word. The dirty word
can stay, said the editor, but you can't use that other
vulgar thing.
All of which makes writing a column harder than
an Econ. I midterm.
There are hundreds of people on campus who
could write a column better than I, but could they
keep it up and be as consistently good as I am
consistently bad? It's not so much getting the
column started, but rather keeping it up that pinches.
Like getting married, it's not the outlay, it's the
upkeep.
I'd like to thank a few people for their inspira
tional if not practical contributions in the past. You
might just check through to see if your name is there:
McGrady, Fuller, Norton, Watkins, Lakin, Jellison,
Smith. Munk, Scott, Schmiddling, and Whiz Bang
1903.
I encourage all of you to write columns. And
some of you have, specially Whiz Bang.
My warning is that competition is tougher all
over the world than ever before, and getting tougher
every minute.
For example, I've been looking at horse flies.

Or haven't you noticed there are fewer horse
flies these days. Notwithstanding the fact that it
is too cold for house flies, I've analyzed the whole
thing and blame the shortage of horse flies on com
petition. Which, like I said, is greater than ever
before.
A horse fly setting out in the world just hasn't
the opportunities today that young horse flies had
30 years ago. I don't have to tell you there are
fewer customers per horse fly today.
Still I don't believe that the dearth of horses has
interfered with anything so biologically basic as the
birth rate of horse flies.
What has happened, then, to the horse flies who
have no horses?
Well, while most of the oldtimers have stayed
in the horse business. I have a hunch that the keen
competition has forced a lot of the younger horse
flies into different work.
Some of them, for example, are trying to pass
themselves off as mosquitos. Of course they're not
fooling me any because they don't stand at a 45
degree angle like the Anopheles, and they don't
have the manners and light touch of a mosquito.
I just wonder whether any of them are fooling
other mosquitos.
They say a pair of mosquitos have as many as
16.000.000 offspring in a year. I don't suppose that
the horse fly—n,o it couldn't be.
Well. I have troubles of my own. and am willing
to let the mosquitos be. I hope the feeling is mutual.
Sometimes though I wish I had no more to think
about than a mosquito. So far, the fact that I stand
at a 45 degree angle hasn't fooled anyone, including
the horse flies.
