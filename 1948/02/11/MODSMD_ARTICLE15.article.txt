## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 10 (UP) â€”Grain and cotton prices plunged the
permissible trading limits and livestock prices slipped lower
today, paving the way for further cuts in retail food prices.
Stocks and bonds followed the downward trend and securities
on the New York Stock Exchange suffered aggregate losses of

about $1,500,000,000. on declines of
1 to 3 points. The break dropped
the overall average to the level of
last June.
Almost all wheat, corn, oats and
soy beans sold on the nation's grain
exchanges nosedived in the fourth
big grain price break within six
days.
MARKET SLUMP
The current grain market slump
is the most severe in 28 years, in
cluding the market crash in 1929,
Chicago Board of Trade experts said.
Many grain traders expected fur
ther declines.
Cotton prices at New York and
Chicago dropped the permissible
limits of $10 a bale. Light buying
just before the close advanced the
prices a few points above the ex
treme lows.
The tumbling market prices and
price reductions on the retail level
were good news for housewives. Re
ports from all parts of the nation
showed that many retailers already
had cut prices on pork, beef, flour,
bread, butter, lard and many other
food items.
AVERAGE PRICE
A check of 10 cities showed that
the average price of a pound of but
ter was 96 cents last Wednesday
when the commodities markets
broke. Today the average price Was
93.2 cents.
In the same 10 cities the average
price of bacon dropped from 76.8
cents a pound a week ago to 70,8
cents today. The price of lard drop
ped from an average of 33.8 cents
to 27.5 cents.
Farmers appeared to have suc
ceeded in checking, at least tempor
arily, the sharp price break in the
livestock market by holding their
cattle and hogs on the farm. How
ever, despite sharply reduced farm
to-market shipments today, prices
dropped lower.
