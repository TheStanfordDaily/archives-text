# Housing Problems Before President
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UP).â€”
Houses should continue to be built
at a high rate for years because a
decline in building might help bring
on a recession, Housing Expediter
Tighe E. Woods told President Tru
man today.
He made the statement as the
House Banking Committee wound
up rent control hearings with CIO
testimony that many landlords ex
pect rent ceilings to end on March 1.
John W. Edelman, representing
the CIO Textile Workers' Union,
said he had received numerous tel
ephone calls during the past 24
hours indicating "that landlords
must have had some assurances
from Washington or elsewhere that
the sky would be the limit as of
March 1."
