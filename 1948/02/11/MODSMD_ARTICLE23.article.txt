# Utah Jokers’ "Prank" Fails

### 
SALT LAKE CITY. Feb. 10 (UP
—That's a joke, son. Or at least i:
was, Utah publicity men kept mum
bling to themselves today. A great
joke!
But the joke seemed to be on Utah
as reports kept coming in that th>.
recently publicized ''feud' between
Utah and Nevada over Reno Cham
ber of Commerce attempts to "milk"
clouds of snow was being taken all
too seriously.
What hurt the most was a report
that a Chicago advertising firm had
sent a whole trainload of skiers t<
Now Hampshire, under the impres
sion that Utah's much - glamorized
ski slopes were naked ami bare o:
snow because of Nevada's "milking"
process.
IVIOANIN' LOW
Rulon Howells, Utah Department
of Publicity and Industrial Develop
ment Commissioner, moaned about
that one. But that wasn't all. Oth
er letters have been coming in by
the hundreds, asking if it really
so that "Utah's ski slopes have been
ruined by Nevada."
Howells pointed to the four inches
ot new snow which fell over Salt
Lake City last night, and to the six
feet of snow which covered the Alta
and Brighton ski slopes. But to no
avail.
People are still writing in, wiring
in, or calling.his office about the
"bare" ski runs.
Meanwhile, Steve Moloney. Salt
Lake Chamber of Commerce pub
licity man, contends that the gag—
a brain child of hiy boss. Gus Back
man—has been eminently success
ful. And with a grave face. Moloney
is all for keeping it up.
NO LAWSUIT
"There hasn't been any lawsuit
over the matter yet," Moloney de
clared. "But we are seriously look
ing into the matter of diverting
moisture from clouds.
That was the theme song a month,
ago when Backman accused Nevada
chamber officials of "skyway rob
bery" and aggression in a "cold war"
against Utah. Backman's accusa
tions were against attempts by Ne
vada officials to get snow for a sk:.
meet on Mt. Rose by using dry ice
sprinkled on Utah-bound clouds.
Moloney still thinks it's a great
gag. But Howells thinks of that
trainload of skiers enjoying them
selves — and spending money — ir.
New Hampshire. And he shudders
