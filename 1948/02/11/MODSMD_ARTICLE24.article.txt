### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10 (UP).â€”A
federal grand jury investigation of
charges that the CIO violated the
political section of the Taft-Hartley
Act began today with an FBI agent
as the first witness.
It was the government's first such
move against a labor union since the
law was parsed last year.
The FBI man was asked to re
port on the results of his question
ing of union officials involved in the
ClO's endorsement of Rep. Edward
A. Garmatz. D., Md., in a special
Baltimore election last summer-
The CIO flooded the area with
extra copies of the CIO News, car
rying a front-page endorsement of
Garmatz by CIO President Philir
Murray. Murray admittedly took
the action in an open challenge to
the law's ban on political activity by
labor unions.
R. J. Thomas, former president of
the CIO Auto Workers' Union an<:
now located in CIO national head
quarters here, and Henry Fleischer,
assistant CIO publicity director,
also were on hand to testify.
