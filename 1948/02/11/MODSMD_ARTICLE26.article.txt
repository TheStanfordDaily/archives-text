### 
SALONIKA, Greece, Feb. 10
(UP).â€”Greek guerrillas fired heavy
artillery and mortar shells into this
port city of 250,000 for !)0 minutes
before dawn today, killing four per
sons, including a British soldier. But
within a few hours they were trap
ped by government soldiers and by
early afternoon they appeared to be
loomed to defeat.
Four American staff observers
were in the thick of the battle as the
Greek army closed in on the attack
ers six miles southeast of Salonika,
but none was wounded.
FIRING BEGINS EARLY
The guerrilla bombardment stall
ed shortly after 2 a.m. Shells raked
two waterfront blocks, one landing
only 10 feet from the Mediterranean
Palace Hotel, which houses Ameri
can and British officers and mem
bers of the United Nations Balkans
Commission.
One shell hit a British guard post,
killing a private and wounding a
corporal and a private. A Greek
man and two women were killed
while sleeping in their homes. Ten
other Greeks were injured serious
ly, it was reported officially.
AMERICANS SLEEP
Most of the 85 Americans in Sa
lonika slept through the bombard
ment. This morning some of them
found chunks of shrapnel embed
ded in walls outside their homes.
No American was injured.
The guerrillas were believed to
have fired from a hill overlooking
Salonika, less than 2,500 yards away,
virtually under the guns of a Greek
navy corvette in the harbor.
