LONDON, Feb. 10 (UP) —Great Britain challenged Russia today to
join her, the United States and France in publishing without censorship
all German foreign office documents on Adolf Hitler's dealings with
both Eastern and Western allies.
But Britain wants all four powers to agree to present their documents
"as a historical and not a political record."
"That is," a foreign office spokesman explained, "if some of the evi-

dence casts reflections on the con- ,
duct of any of the Big Four nations 1
it. would be included in the same !
manner as favorable material."
No formal invitation had been
given Russia to take part in prepar
ing German documents captured by
the Western allies "inasmuch as we
were not invited to study in ad- |
vance Nazi documents published by
Moscow," the spokesman said.
Britain and the United States j
agreed after the war to prepare j
captured German documents for
publication as a historical record,
I he spokesman said—telling the com
plete story and withholding no doc
uments even if they reflected un
favorably on Britain or America.
France later asked to be associ- j
ated with the publication, said the j
spokesman, and on her agreement j
to abide by the conditions set her i
request was granted.
"The Russians have not approach- J
ed us on the subject, the spokesman j
added, "but if they did their appli- '
cation would be considered in the |
same way as that ot France."
