## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 11 (UP)â€”The prosecution today
asked the International War Crimes Tribunal to order the "stern
est penalty known to the law" for former Japenese Premier
Hideki Tojo and 24 other men accused of leading the Japanese
war of conquest.
Chief Allied Prosecutor Joseph B. Keenan, Washington, D. C.,

summed up nearly two years of
prosecution evidence by describing
the defendants' acts as "vile" and
charging that they had "no consid
eration for the dignity of the hum
an being."
GUARDS CAUTIOUS
Extra guards of stern-faced, he'l
meted military police took extra
precautions to prevent Tojo and the
other defendants from "anything
rash" as hundreds of Japanese lined
up outside the one-time Japanese
war ministry building hoping to get
a seat to hear Kennan's summation.
When Keenan finished reading the
opening section of the prosecution's
summation, British Prosecutor Ar
thur Corriyns Carr began the second
section summarizing the background
of the indictments.
CRIMES AGAINST PEACE
Carr explained that the defend
ants were broadly charged with
crimes against the peace, conven
tional war crimes and crimes against
humanity. He then voiced the pros
ecution's interpretations of the.se
crimes.
