The accompanying questionnaire is part of a program to put
Stanford in Europe this summer. Rates are reasonable, and uni
versities which accept the GI Bill are accepting foreign students.
It is probable that air transport companies would reduce their
rates for a group of Stanford students who chartered a plane.

Persons interested in a group char
ter are asked to sign the list in the
UNESCO office.
Relief organizations need volun
teer workers this summer. These
organizations will probably pay at
least part of the volunteers' travel
expenses.
It takes a good while to secure
passports, visas, and acceptances to
study at foreign universities. It
would be wise to write for these
immediately.
UNESCO's immediate job is to
help interested people go abroad.
Filed information is available to
students who come to the lIR shack
Monday through Friday fom 3.30
to 5 p.m.
This information includes lists of
foreign hotels and their rates, sea
and air travel rates, complete cur
ricular data on most foreign univer
sities, and Youth Hostel application
blanks.
.If you want the help of UNESCO
facilities in planning your foreign
travel, be sure to turn it in.
Collection points are at the Cellar,
all campus libraries, the main lob
by of the Village, and the larger
campus dormitories.
