# Campus Combats Flu Successfully
## 
### 
The respiratory diseases which
cropped up on campus during past
months have been reduced to a new
low, according to Dr. George Houck,
director of the Student Health
Service.
The recent outbreak of influenza,
a sub-type of Type A. never as
sumed serious proportions on cam
pus. Dr. Houck reported that those
students who had been previously
vaccinated had proven highly re
sistant to the sub-type disease.
Health Service requests that all
students who have not had a chest
X-ray given by the Health Service
within the past year make X-ray
appointments as soon as possible.
