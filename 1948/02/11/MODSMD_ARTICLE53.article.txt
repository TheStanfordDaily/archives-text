# Former Econ Professor Is Praised by ‘Fortune’
## 
### HERB SMITH 
One-time Stanford economics professor, Thorstein Veblen,
drew this comment from the December, 1947, issue of Fortune
magazine:
"More than any modern thinker except Marx, this lonely Amer
ican inspired and shaped the intellectual attack of business and

values of business civilization."
Veblen came to Stanford in 190(5
at the request of President David
Starr Jordan, who thought that he
would add intellect and prestige to
the faculty.
MOST SUBTLE MAN
It was Jordan's opinion that Veb
len was "the most subtle man in the
business. What he cannot reverse
and make it appear the opposite of
what it purports to be isn't worth
reversing."
Veblen was often classed as an
economist, but he was more than
that. He delved into all knowledge
and then synthesized a thorough
theory on the nature of Western
civilization.
His opinion of our present culture
was not complimentary. He believed
that the aim of the individual in our
society is "conspicuous consump
tion" and "conspicuous leisure."
TONE OF OPTIMISM
But there is a tone of optimism
in Veblen. He thought that in time
our culture might change from one
of "keeping up with the Joneses"
to one of accomplishment as an end
in itself. Few people have ever
heard of Veblen but his philosophy

permeates the thoughts of most of
us.
While at Stanford Veblen lived at
Cedro, a cottage on the other side
of San Franeisquito Creek.
As a rule Veblen disliked students
and students disliked Veblen. Veb
len was irritated by having to teach
j those who did not have a great deal
of both intelligence and knowledge.
In order to restrict his classes Veb
len made a knowledge of French,
German, psychology, and philosophy
prerequisites for his undergraduate
J courses.
RESTRICTED CLASSES
Giving low marks to further re
, strict his classes to those who had
a "real thirst for knowledge" did
not increase Veblen's popularity.
Veblen was forced to resign from
the Stanford faculty in 1909 because
a friend was living with him. Veb
len's comment on the affair is a clas
sic—"But what is one to do if the
woman moves in on you?"
Veblen died in 1929 in his "bare
and barnlike" home near Stanford.
He was a tired, old man, unreward
ed then and now by praise which he
so well deserves.
