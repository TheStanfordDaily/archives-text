# Badminton Aces To Perform Friday
## 
### 
Cardinal sports fans who attend
the Friday night UCLA - Stanford
basketball contest will be treated lo
a net game of another nature when
world - famous badminton players
and court comedians Ken Davidson
and Osgood Hilton put on a be
tween-halves demonstration.
Featuring many different types of
trick shots, the two will try to con
fuse each other and the audience as
well with their assorted type of
racquet magic and sideline clown
ing.
One of Davidson's more famous
shots is his miss and hit whereby
he swings wildly at the bird the
first time and misses, and then
whips it suddenly from behind his
back with a last-moment Hip of his
racquet.
Davidson has played all over the
world, putting on demonstrations
before such persons as the King of
England and other foreign digni
tnrie's. At present he is probably the
top professional player of the world,
having won numerous champion
ships.
His opponent, Osgood Hilton, is a
Bay Area man and was formerly
holder of the Peninsula counties
badminton title. In 1945 he won the
French shuttlecock crown.
