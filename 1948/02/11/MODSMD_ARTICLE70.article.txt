## Excom Is Wrong! 
### 
WSSF, SIRO, NSA, lIR, UNESCO—
What do all these familiar alphabet groups mean?
They mean concerted student effort, national and local, to
wards lasting peace. They are the post-war answer to the old
cry "College students live in an ivory tower."
We grant that much of this effort is talk. But SIRO (Stanford
International Relief Organization) has tangible results (see letters
at right) that our efforts are making an impression.
Excom has voted not to appropriate any more money to SIRO
for sending packages to people in Europe. Several members ex
pressed the opinion that this money could "be used elsewhere
to better advantage."
Where?
To pay for Pajamarino damages?
Excom has a right to be careful with the students' money.
That's their job. It is also their job to exercise a sense of values
when they do spend or withhold it.
We think they are wrong in this case. SIRO should receive
further appropriations —because:
1) The adoption of the University of Naples has been one of
Stanford's unigue contributions in the effort to better international
relations. We gave it 30 percent of the funds from the Relief
Drive last fall. Since then SIRO has automatically sent to the
University all contributions not designated for individuals. Ex
com's action means that some other organization will have to be
set up and given money to continue this, or else we will have
to abandon the project.
2) Many living groups have adopted individuals and are send
ing packages through SIRO. If SIRO is disbanded, these groups
will continue to work individually, if they can. Why not have a
central organization and increase the work rather than discour
age their efforts and leave no center from which new groups
may operate?
3) Distributing clothes through a national agency, as was
suggested at Excom, will get the clothes to Europe, but SIRO was
founded on the broader basis of direct personal contact for the
benefit of both parties. We think this outweighs the monetary
d;sadvantage.
There should have been more discussion before Excom voted.
Compromises might have been worked out. For example, if
Excom is reluctant to spend ASSU funds for SIRO why couldn't
it be included among the groups receiving proceeds from the
next drive. Then the students themselves could show whether
or not they wish SIRO to stand or fall.
Excom will discuss SIRO again a week from tonight. There is
only one thing they can do—reverse their stand and give
SIRO the money they should have.—M.H.

for sending packages to people in Europe. Several members ex
pressed the opinion that this money could "be used elsewhere
to better advantage."
Where?
To pay for Pajamarino damages?
Excom has a right to be careful with the students' money.
That's their job. It is also their job to exercise a sense of values
when they do spend or withhold it.
We think they are wrong in this case. SIRO should receive
further appropriations —because:
1) The adoption of the University of Naples has been one of
Stanford's unigue contributions in the effort to better international
relations. We gave it 30 percent of the funds from the Relief
Drive last fall. Since then SIRO has automatically sent to the
University all contributions not designated for individuals. Ex
com's action means that some other organization will have to be
set up and given money to continue this, or else we will have
to abandon the project.
2) Many living groups have adopted individuals and are send
ing packages through SIRO. If SIRO is disbanded, these groups
will continue to work individually, if they can. Why not have a
central organization and increase the work rather than discour
age their efforts and leave no center from which new groups
may operate?
3) Distributing clothes through a national agency, as was
suggested at Excom, will get the clothes to Europe, but SIRO was
founded on the broader basis of direct personal contact for the
benefit of both parties. We think this outweighs the monetary
d;sadvantage.
There should have been more discussion before Excom voted.
Compromises might have been worked out. For example, if
Excom is reluctant to spend ASSU funds for SIRO why couldn't
it be included among the groups receiving proceeds from the
next drive. Then the students themselves could show whether
or not they wish SIRO to stand or fall.
Excom will discuss SIRO again a week from tonight. There is
only one thing they can do—reverse their stand and give
SIRO the money they should have.—M.H.
WSSF, SIRO, NSA, lIR, UNESCO—
What do all these familiar alphabet groups mean?
They mean concerted student effort, national and local, to
wards lasting peace. They are the post-war answer to the old
cry "College students live in an ivory tower."
We grant that much of this effort is talk. But SIRO (Stanford
International Relief Organization) has tangible results (see letters
at right) that our efforts are making an impression.
Excom has voted not to appropriate any more money to SIRO
for sending packages to people in Europe. Several members ex
pressed the opinion that this money could "be used elsewhere
to better advantage."
