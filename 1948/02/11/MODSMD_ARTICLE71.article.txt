## 8,000 Letters of Hope 
### 
To the Editor:
(What is the difference between sending relief to Europe through the
Red Cross and sending it through SIRO (Stanford International Relief
Organization)?
Through the Red Cross it goes in bulk from the United States of Am
erica. Through SIRO. every parcel carries a letter from one human being
to another, expressing concern for ihe sufferings of one less fortunate.
This is one important means by which we, as individuals, can help
to interpret democracy to a continent of people being overrun by com
munism. One personal letter inside one parcel from every Stanford
student would be 8,000 messages of hope and trust in the future of
democracy.
Democracy has one fundamental asset to offer in the face of commun
ism in Europe at the present time. "Freedom of speech" means little
to a man who is without the bare necessities of life. But "belief in the
dignity of the human being." which can only be expressed in its true
form by personal associations, is a spiritual force ->" u; ch lifts the morale
of the most destitute to the level of a fighting force,
Communism is offering to Europe the pnysicai and democ
racy must do more than that. By Excom's action last w(. k (denying
SIRO further funds for the purpose of sending relief parcels), we are
throwing away a golden opportunity.
