# ‘We Thank You, Stanford’
## From Munich 
### 
Dear Students of Stanford University:
I send you a cheerful and grateful greeting from
Munich. Eight days ago, on the fifth of October, I
got your clothing-parcel with a great joy. From
my sister, Mrs. David G. Cowie, you surely heard,
under which unfavorable proportions we have to
study in Germany. And so you can understand how
grateful I'm about such a precious greeting out of
the New World. All the students, who gave some
thing for me, a lot of thanks. The clothes are suited
wonderful and are a great help for me, because we
can not buy anything like these in Germany some
years.
My sister wrote to me. how comfortable the study
is in America. In Germany it is not quite so easy.
Here the Universities are overcrowded, because
some are destroyed and so the other Universities
can not receive the students, who want to study.
And to all these are coming the men being in the
war also want to finish their study.
During the lectures the students are writing on
the steps and in front of the windows, or they have
to stand beside the happy owners of a place.
Not enough dead bodies are here to disect. Out of my
written words you can see that I'm studying medi
cine.
The professors let study only the best from all
the students. So the examinations are very difficult.
Four weeks ago I passed my first examination and
I'm happy. 40-50 percent of the students didn't pass.
The first examination consists of the following
professions: Chemistry, natural philosophy, botony,
and zoology. At time already I have much to study
lor the second examination. This consists of: Anat
omy, histology, embryology, physiology and physio
logy chemistry. This second examination you have
to make after two years study on the University.
Three years later you have to finish your study
with the public-examination and the doctor-work.
The year decays in two sections. And every sec
tion lasts three till four months. During the other
time we have holidays and you have to work five
months of them in hospitals. Here in Bavaria the
students use the holidays to drive to the Alps, in
summer to mountaineering, in winter to drive ski.
By the side of all the sciences we do many sorts of
sport—tennis, ride on horses and sail on the near
lakes.
Now I would be very interested, how the study
is formed on the Stanford University. I would be
happy if I could get a report from a very nice stud
ent girl. So if I can, I will answer in the american
language.
The best greeting from
your
KARL-HEINZ KRIEGEL.
