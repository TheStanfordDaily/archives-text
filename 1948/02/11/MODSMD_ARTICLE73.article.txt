Dear SIRO:
Last week I received two gift-parcels from the
SIRO. I was just so surprised as glad, and I am
the happiest man now. These parcels were welcome
help in great need. I am very grateful to you, and
I am very sorry that I am not able to do something
hut to say: "Many thanks." I can do nothing but
thank, and I do that for myself and also for that

people who ogt the wonderful things off the
SIRO parcels.
Unfortunately I could apply the fewest things
for myself, because I am so terrible tall. So I have
given things the poorest and neediest people. There
were tears of joy. So I hope that I have acted in
the meaning of SIRO.
Dear SIRO. pardon my bad english please and
also the mistakes. I have learned some english in
1941 and 1942. 1943 I became a soldier (as a boy of
sixteen). In 1946 and 1947 I must learn french, be
cause french is now the modern language here in
the "Zone Francaise d'Occupation." Today I am
twenty years old. and after the end of war until
today I studied some english by myself, not very
successful indeed, but I hope you wil be a little
pleased about this.
I am much obliged to you. Friendly greetings.
