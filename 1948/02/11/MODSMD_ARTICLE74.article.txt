WICHITA, Kan. (UP) —What are the chances of
another dust bowl in the now-lush midwestern
wheatlands?
Quite possible, says the current Secretary of Ag
riculture. Remote, says a Kansan who once held
that post.
Clinton P. Anderson, who runs the agriculture
department now, stirred up much talk among Kan
sas farmers with a speech before the 77th annua!
meeting of the Kansas Board of Agriculture. He
said: "Today a new dust bowl could be in the mak
ing."
Anderson said there had been too much specu
lative farming. He contended that "soil murder 01
a vast scale" was being committed through the "reck
less operations of land speculators and suitcase
farmers" who were plowing up the grasslands to grow
"wheat on land that was never meant for wheat."
The Secretary of Agriculture urged intensified
soil conservation, by individuals and with the as
sistance of government programs.
Dr. W. M. Jardine, president of Wichita Uni
versity, was Secretary of Agriculture in the day
after the first World War.
There never need be another dust bowl, he re
torted to Anderson.
"I don't think the farmers of Kansas," ho observ
ed, "ever will let the dust situation get out of hand
again."
Jardine said the Kansas and Oklahoma and Texas
Panhandle wheat farmer has learned a lot since
dust kowl days.
"If the farmers will practice what they know—
and I think they will—there will be no such thin
as another terrible blow-away," the one-time secre
tary said.
It is true there are absentee interests in th
wheat country whose single thought is to reap ai
the profifits possible in these days of three-dollai
wheat, Jardine admitted. He said he feels the gias.--
roots wheat farmer —"and there are many of that
type"—will insure against a return to any dust bowl
Jardine enumerated factors serving to prevent
a repeat performance of "the agricultural traged>
of the midwest": •
1. The availability of special farm implements.
2. The assistance of state agricultural agents.
3. The advancement of farming methods.
4. The use of better seed.
5. The unprecedented economic prosperity of the
region.
