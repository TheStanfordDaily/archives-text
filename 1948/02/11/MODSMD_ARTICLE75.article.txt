## BULL SESSION 
### 
The other day, while pondering the problems
of post-war education in our cozy cubicle at Dibbles
abandoned labyrinth, we were mildly startled by a
hesitant knock on the plywood panel near where the
door would have been, if we'd had a door.
The wall had 110 sooner settled back into its casual
posture than there appeared a pear-shaped, fright
ened-looking young lady in brown pig-tails knotted
neatly under her Adam's-apple.
"I . . . I'm a Stanford woman," she apologized.
"Tliere, there now," we smiled reassuringly, "just
you keep quiet about it and no one will ever know."
"It's not that." she said without confidence, "its
just that . . . well ... in your column you seem to
be so mature and so wise and
Our cheeks reddened.
. . well, I thought maybe you could tell me
how to get along with Stanford men, she blui ted
self-consciously. )t
"Well—what methods have you tried? was asked
engagingly. '
"I asked our House Mother, Lydia Peckham
"And?"
"No soap. She's so sticky—and always wants to
conceal things."
We clucked sympathetically.
"Where do you live?" we asked.
"At Lagdronanita." she pronounced.
"Hmm . ." we said, noncommittally.
"It's from the Spanish," she added with sophis
tication.
"And quite representative, too," we ventured.
"I've tried everything, even the New Look—
see?" she said, raising her ankle-length black taffeta
skirt and revealing a pair of capable-looking feet
encased in trim black and white Keds.
"You're a healthy-looking child." we compliment
ed her. "What kind of perfume do you use?"
"Surrender." she gurgled seductively.
"Good stuff, made from the most contented whales
. . . Mavbe you don't give it a chance. You have to

meet these things half way, you know," we added
with a twinkle.
"What do older men expect?" she pleaded fran
tically.
"Now, now. child." we said soothingly, patting her
near the shoulder. "You must remember that these
men have lived dangerously and loved ... in many
countries. Why I remember one time in Paris —but
that's all gone down the drain now. Where were
we? Oh —the thing about these men is that they
don't want to waste their time chasing rainbows,
especially with the cost of living at $3.50 a pint
like it is—"
"I read every edition of True Romances and Spicy
Stories." she broke in suddenly.
"You must read more wordly books," we said,
"like Hemingway, or Learning to Live."
"I want something I can get my teeth into," she
whooped enthusiastically.
"You might try Duncan Uines," we tittered gail>
"Oh. is he better than Hemingway?" she asked
innocently.
"There's just no comparison."
Our eye was attracted to a small brooch which
she wore dangling from a chain about her neck.
She perceived the general direction ol our gaze
immediately. Her eyes wide with horror, she execut
ed a neat pivot, hurdled the garden-rake we keep for
leveling the silt floor, tripped on a little hillock,
sprawled and lay shuddering.
We were touched.
"Now, now," we soothed. "110 one's going to hurt
you. Here, you dropped one of your itty-bitty jacks."
We handed her the mall metal object and she
seemed more relaxed, enough her teeth still clat
tered a little.
"I'll bet you're a fine little jack player," we said
psychologically.
"Yesterday I got up to fivesies," she Fobbed with
new confidence, and backed out the door.
