# Hooton Prefers String Bean Type To Brawny Build
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
The world in its present state
could well use more men with
"string bean" builds, contended Dr.
Earnest A. Hooton, Harvard's emi
nent anthropologist, in his opening
lecture on "The Determinants of
Human Conduct."
His speech was given before an
audience of 1,500 in Memorial Au
ditorium last night.
The body build of the human
male is usually a good indicator of
his temperament, he explained, and
meh of slight builds are more like
ly to be interested in cultural and
spiritual tilings and in building up
the international society. Men of
the extreme muscular type, on the
other hand, tend to be more ath
letic and warlike. - r
Dr. Hooton's contentions were
based on Sheldon's theory of physi
cal typology which states that there
are three extreme types of males:
the string-bean type, the roly-poly
type, and those of bone and muscle.
The majority, however, fall into in
termediate categories, both physi
cally and temperamentally, he said.
In his introductory statement Dr.
Hooton declared that "we, the hu
man race, have become so ingenious
in making machines to produce
goods for our own destruction that
we must contrive to improve our
conduct immediately, or presently
find ourselves dead apes putrefying
on a devastated planet."
