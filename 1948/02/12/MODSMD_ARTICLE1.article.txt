# $5,000 QUOTA
## 'Give!' Slogan Of Red Cross Campus Drive 
### 
Stanford's Red Cross drive,
with a quota set at $5,000, be
gins a week's run on Monday.
On-campus collections will be
made in living groups, while a
booth will be open in front of
the Cellar Tuesday, Wednes
day, and Thursday for off-cam
pus students not contacted.
Diana Powers, director of the
drive for Cardinals, stated yester
day: "Each student becomes a mem
ber of the Red Cross with a dol
lar donation, but give more if you
can. The need for the Red Cross is
not over just because the war has
ended."
"The Red Cross is not a part of
the Four Feathers drive," contin
ued Miss Powers. "The Red Cross
lias specific obligations imposed
upon it by Congressional charter.
"The governing body of the Red
Cross has repeatedly studied the
question of participation in joint
campaigns and has concluded that
only by direct appeal in its own
name to the American people can it
successfully finance its charter ob
ligations."
'"It's Red Cross time. Give!" is the
national slogan of the 1948 Red
Cross drive.
