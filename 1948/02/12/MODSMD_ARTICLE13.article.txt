## Federal Grand jury Indicts CIO's Murray 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (UP)
■—A Federal Grand Jury today
indicted the CIO and its presi
dent, Phiilp Murray, for violat
ing the Taft-Hartley act ban on
union political activity.
They were accused of making il
legal expenditures in the campaign
of Rep. Edward M. Garmatz, D., Md..
who was the successful candidate in
a special Congressional election last
fall.
CLARIFICATION REQUIRED
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0., said
today some provisions of the Taft-
Hartley law might require clarifi
cation and that the government may
have made "a mistake" in indicting
Murray on a charge of violating the
law.
Murray deliberately challenged
the Taft-Hartley law ban by writ
ing an editorial in "The CIO News"
endorsing Garmatz. The government
estimated a $1000 expense was en
tailed in printing the paper.
The indictment was the first of a
series which the Department of Jus
tice will seek.
CONSTITUTIONAL TEST
Murray welcomed it as opening
the way for a constitutional test of
the law and said the major issue 1
will be freedom of speech and the ;
press.
If convicted, the union could be j
fined $5,000. Murray would face a
year in prison and a $1,000 fine be- j
cause he authorized the printing of I
the Garmatz endorsement.
Other segments of labor are ex
pected to come to Murray's support. !
Big unions almost as a whole, have
declared war on Congressmen who
supported the Taft-Hartley labor
law and are exerting strong pressure ]
for revisions.
Murray advised all CIO regional'
directors and industrial union coun- [
cil officials that they "should be go- !
veined" by national CIO policy on <
the Henry A. Wallace third party

I and European recovery plan issues,
jit was revealed tonight.
Labor circles saw the "order" as
a threat that all non-conformists
will be expelled. It also was viewed
I as part of Murray's intensified drive
! to purge communists and other left
wing elements who long have dom
i inated some CIO unions.


PHILIP MURRAY, CIO president, said he would welcome the chance
to test the constitutionality of the Taft-Hartley Act ban on union polit
ical activity before a federal grand jury.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (UP)
■—A Federal Grand Jury today
indicted the CIO and its presi
dent, Phiilp Murray, for violat
ing the Taft-Hartley act ban on
union political activity.
They were accused of making il
legal expenditures in the campaign
of Rep. Edward M. Garmatz, D., Md..
who was the successful candidate in
a special Congressional election last
fall.
CLARIFICATION REQUIRED
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0., said
today some provisions of the Taft-
Hartley law might require clarifi
cation and that the government may
have made "a mistake" in indicting
Murray on a charge of violating the
law.
Murray deliberately challenged
the Taft-Hartley law ban by writ
ing an editorial in "The CIO News"
endorsing Garmatz. The government
estimated a $1000 expense was en
tailed in printing the paper.
The indictment was the first of a
series which the Department of Jus
tice will seek.
CONSTITUTIONAL TEST
Murray welcomed it as opening
the way for a constitutional test of
the law and said the major issue 1
will be freedom of speech and the ;
press.
If convicted, the union could be j
fined $5,000. Murray would face a
year in prison and a $1,000 fine be- j
cause he authorized the printing of I
the Garmatz endorsement.
Other segments of labor are ex
pected to come to Murray's support. !
