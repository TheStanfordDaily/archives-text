CHICAGO. Feb. 11 (UP).â€”Heavy
1 snows and strong winds raged across
a large area of the nation from the
| iMoriii Central states south to the
Rio Grande today, reaching blizzard
proportions in the Texas-Oklahoma
Panhandle.
Temperatures dropped suddenly
to as low as two degrees above zero
at noon at Amarillo, Tex., and one
above at Dalhart, near the Okla
homa border. The cold was accom
panied by strong winds and heavy
! drifting and blowing snow.
The weather man warned that the
i heavy snow and below-zero tem
peratures would move into the Mid
; western states by Friday and east
ward to the Atlantic Seaboard by
the weekend. He said the cold wave
I would moderate somewhat as it
moved eastward.
Meanwhile, approximately 175,-
000 industrial workers in the nation
still were idle because of the acute
fuel oil shortage, and household
stormed emergency offices for fuel.
Schools and industry in three cen
tral Michigan towns were shut
down today because of a lack of
gas.
Chicago weather forecasters said
the blizzard and near-blizzard con
ditions resulted when a new cold
mass from the northeast clashed
with warm air moving up from the
Gulf of Mexico.
An ice pack extending along 80
I miles of the Ohio River broke to
j day, sending huge floes pounding
! down the river and trapping at least
| four towboats and 18 barges.
