## Market Skid Sends Prices Into Nose Dive 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 11 (UP) —
Grain futures and wholesale
food prices nose-dived today,
with grains skidding still lower
in a market break that has sur
passed the grain price collapse
of 1929 and is the most rapid de
cline for a single month in the Chi
cago Board of Trade's history.
Records ol the Exchange, the
world's largest grain mart, showed
that the market break had surpass
ed the grain price declines of 1929
and 1898 despite the fact that losses
today are controlled by daily trading
limits.
GRAIN RALLY
A late rally in the grain pits lifted
several wheat futures from the bot
tom today after they had skidded
the permissible limits for a single
day's trading, but all closed lower
than yesterday. Corn prices gener
ally closed off the limit.
Grain and other farm commodity
prices which have slumped for sev
en days, still have a long way to
drop before they hit the "floor."
Despite the big price break, wheat,
corn and cotton and most other com
modities tonight still were selling
tar above the level at which the go
vernment must support prices re
ceived by producers.
WHOLESALE PRICES DROP
Wholesale food prices dropped in
the biggest price break in 17 months
and a city-by-city survey showed
some substantial decreases within
the past week in food prices paid by
housewives.
The New York Stock Exchange
staged a rally of its own, and stocks
closed irregularly higher after a
forenoon drop had carried them to
a new low since May 28, 1947. Bonds
were irregularly lower. Curb stocks
; and cotton futures closed lower.
In a single week the price of May
wheat has dropped more than 39
cents. In the crash of 1929, Decem
ber wheat, which then was the big
wheat future for trading, dropped
22 cents from Oct. 24. when the stock

| market collapsed, to the end of the
year.
GROWING APPREHENSION
{ Despite the late rally, one brok
| erage firm reported that there is
! "growing apprehension that this
' may be only the forerunner of a
general economic taiLspin."
A meat institute spokesman at- j
i tributed much of the decline to "very
, high consumer resistance."

CHICAGO, Feb. 11 (UP) —
Grain futures and wholesale
food prices nose-dived today,
with grains skidding still lower
in a market break that has sur
passed the grain price collapse
of 1929 and is the most rapid de
cline for a single month in the Chi
cago Board of Trade's history.
Records ol the Exchange, the
world's largest grain mart, showed
that the market break had surpass
ed the grain price declines of 1929
and 1898 despite the fact that losses
today are controlled by daily trading
limits.
GRAIN RALLY
A late rally in the grain pits lifted
several wheat futures from the bot
tom today after they had skidded
the permissible limits for a single
day's trading, but all closed lower
than yesterday. Corn prices gener
ally closed off the limit.
Grain and other farm commodity
prices which have slumped for sev
en days, still have a long way to
drop before they hit the "floor."
Despite the big price break, wheat,
corn and cotton and most other com
modities tonight still were selling
tar above the level at which the go
vernment must support prices re
ceived by producers.
