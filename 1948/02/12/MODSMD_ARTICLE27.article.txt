### 
SHANGHAI. Thursday, Feb. 12
(UP). â€”Communist and Nationalist
armies in Manchuria and North
China were re-grouping in strategi
cal moves today for what military
observers predicted might be a
"showdown battle" lor Manchuria.
Front - line dispatches said that
although the Reds were making |
"probing thrusts" into Mukden's
southern outposts, they had not yet
unlimbered their main strength.
And a government spokesman said
the Nationalist position was "fluid"
while positions are being stabilized.
General Teng Wen - yi, the
spokesman, admitted the Commu
nists had bottled up Mukden to a
point where the Nationalists were
unable to strike out to the south.
He insisted, however, that govern
ment pressure from the south soon
would relieve the Mukden defend
ers.
The struggle may determine once
and for all whether the government
will be forced to abandon all hold
ings in Manchuria. I
