BERLIN, Feb. 13 (UP)â€”Marshal
Vassily D. Sokolovky, commander
of the Soviet occupation zone, said
today that Russia would reduce its
occupation costs if the Germans car
ried out the reparations plan and
increased production.
In an interview granted Wilhelm
Kuelz, leader of the German Liberal
Democratic party, and printed in the
Soviet army newspaper Taegliehe
Rundschau, Sokolovky said that
Russia would also re-examine its
policy of confiscating German pro
perty and foster peacetime produc
tion in its zone.
The Russian reparations policy
would not be changed, he said. Ask
ed by Kuelz if Russia planned a par
allel to the Anglo-American zones'
system of increased economic power
for Germans, Sokolovsky said, "No."
