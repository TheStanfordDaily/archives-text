# Excom Announces Stand on Politics; Plans Registrars Lottery for Seats
## 
### 
Political matters, priority for
spring quarter drawings at Toyon,
and a Registrar's lottery for seat
cards were the main items of busi
ness acted on by Excom last night.
Excom approved election results
read by Gordon Luce. In the han
dling of political matters, Excom's
policy was amended to read: "Ex-

I com interprets the University policy
jas being opposed to any partisan
| political action group and Excom
! will continue to base its decisions on
| that interpretation."
PREVENT RUSH
The Registrar's lottery is designed
I to prevent a mob rush at the seat
card window during pre-registra
| tion. It will work as follows:
All students will be divided into
(>0 alphabetic groups. Curtis Brad
| ley, a student selected by Excom at
random from the Student Directory,
| will draw a number corresponding
j to one of the alphabetic sections. He
I will continue to draw until all sec-
J tions are drawn. Students will then
| report for seat cards in the order
j determined by the lottery.
Spring quarter drawing for Toyon
will be divided equally among off
j campus students, eating club mem
j bers, and Village residents. Over
these, certain classes of students
will have additional priority.
PRIORITIES LISTED
They are: veterans who were reg
; istered at Stanford before Septem
: ber, 1945; persons with physical dis-
I abilities; and employees such as
j head telephone operators, head
i hashers, and Sunday library work
| ers. These three priority classes
; must be cleared through Mr. Beat
ty's office. Employees will need let
j ters from their employers.
Approval was given to the pro
! posed revival of the Circle "S" So
ciety under that group's 1922 con
! stitution.
