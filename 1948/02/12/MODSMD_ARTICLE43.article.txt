### 
Salesmanship and the ability to
visualize colors, materials, and arch
itectural plans are very important
in an interior decorator, according to
Mrs. Robert Cross, Ray N. Faulkner,
and Margaret Jory, who spoke at
last night's Vocom meeting on inter
ior decoration.
"You have to be able to sell as well
as to carry out your ideas," said Miss
Jory, who is at present working as
an apprentice with a customs decor
ating firm.
Interior decoration is a hard field
to get into, Miss Jory warned. "You
have to persevere if you really mean
it," she emphasized.
Dr. Faulkner, who is head of the
Stanford Art Department and at one
time a landscape architect, cited' a
good understanding of the human
being, a thorough knowledge of ma
terials and processes, and combined
inate and learned sensitivity to color
relationships as important qualities
in interior design.
Practical knowledge of how fur
nishings and materials are made and
wear is important, Mrs. Cross said.
She also mentioned other fields al
lied with interior decoration such
as planning restaurants, hotels, win
dow and counter dressing, and set
dressers and research work for the
motion picture studios.
