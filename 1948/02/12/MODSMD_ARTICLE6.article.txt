# Hooton Stresses Social Influences
## 
### NED SACK 
Cultural influences on an individ
ual's personality was the main sub
ject of Dr. Earnest A. Hooton's
speech in Memorial Auditorium last
night. This was the second of three
Raymond Fred West Memorial Lec
tures. Dr. Hooton will conclude the
series tonight at 7:30.
Continuing Tuesday night's study
of the individual. Harvard Univers
ity's famed anthropologist said that
environment and social condition
can prevent an individual from ful
filling the possibilities of his natural
abilities. "Environment," he stated,
"can affect even your intelligence,
whatever that is."
PARENTAL INFLUENCE
Parental influences were consid
ered by Dr. Hooton to influence the
environment. Pressure on a child
which pushes him toward some
thing for which he is not physical
ly suited often causes warped per
sonalities, Dr. Hooton stated.
Concluding his discussion of the
individual, the speaker said that
constitution and environment both
influence conduct, but neither can
have a complete effect.
BRUTAL GOVERNMENT
Dr. Hooton began his discussion
of the group by emphasizing the
"brutal character" of the process
by which man evolved his govern
ments with an incompatibility with
humanitarian ideals and interna
tional programs for peace.
Primitive society, he stated, was
for the good of the group. Personal
sacrifice for the good of the group
was considered the height of patri
otism.
Rival groups in primitive society
were essentially competitors and
enemies, reported the anthropolo
gist.
Dr. Hooton will continue his study
of the group and offer plans for im
provement in human relations in to
night's speech.
