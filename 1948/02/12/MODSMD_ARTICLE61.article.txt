# Golf Record Threatened
## 
### 
HARLINGEN. Tex., Feb. 11 (UP).
—Golfers of the winter circuit to
night were convinced that a new
course record for 72 holes would be
i set on the 6.095-yard municipal lay
out in the Fruit and Vegetable Open
which starts tomorrow.
All hands, from local pro Tony
Butler to Clark Hammond, the cx
tourney director lor the PGA,
agreed that the 266 low established
in 1941 by Henry Picard was in a
precarious position.
The course has a comparatively
! easy front nine holes with a par 3. r >.
and a trickier back nine, par 36.
A brisk south wind, blowing sand
across the Rio Grande from Mexico,
today played havoc with the pros'
i practice rounds, forcing some of
them to seek the comforts of the
clubhouse.
The weather man promised a
Texas "norther" tomorrow which
might cancel out. the south wind —
| but bring more discomfort.
E. J. (Dutch) Harrison, the raw
boned pro from York, Pa., who al
most. copped the last Lower Rio
Grande Valley Open here in 1941.
was one of the wind-blown pros
who didn't venture out today.
Harrison, who chalked up a 268
for the 1941 event, two behind Pi
i card's record, subscribed to the the
| ory that a new record would be

hung up when the $10,000 toufi
ends Sunday.
"We've got a faster field than
had back ill liMl." said the Pel.
sylvanian, winner of the Richmoi
Calif., Open.
