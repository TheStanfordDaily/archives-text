# Indian Cagers Point For Double Win This Weekend
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean is keeping his fingers crossed, but it looks
as if his varsity basketball team will be in top shape for the
UCLA and USC games this weekend, for the first time since
the Arkansas game Jan. 2.
Only man who has missed practice this week is reserve guard

Jack Scharfen, who has a touch of
the flu which has afflicted practi
cally every member of the Stan
lord team at different times in the
last month.
CAL LEADS
The Indians will be out to avenge
two defeats administered by the
southern schools earlier in the year.
And more important, they need vic
tories in both, games to get back
into the conference race.
Stanford is at the bottom of the
southern division heap right now
with no wins in four games. Cal
leads with a perfect record of four
wins, while Southern Cal and UCLA
have two wins, and two losses apiece.
It has been four weeks since the
last conference game, and in that
period, Stanford, operating as often
as not on three cylinders, has won
four games while losing one.
UCLA's only start during the con
ference interim was a one-point loss
to the Sacramento Senators. USC
came back to the basketball wars
last weekend, beating USF and San
ta Clara.
The Trojans whipped USF by a
greater score than did Stanford and
Santa Clara by not so much.
Off their recent performances,
Sam Barry's basket bailers deserve
to fce considered just about as good
as the Bruins.
TEAMS ARRIVE TOMORROW
Both southern tecims will be ar
riving tomorrow. The Bruins arc
bringing a large squad of 16 men:
the Trojans' traveling list has not
been announced.
Only knwn casualty on eithei
team is George Stanich, first-striiv.

! wrist several weeks ago and wjl

Tomorrow night while Stanford i.
playing UCLA. Cal will be battlin;

bay. The two northern teams tradi
