The man in whose hands rests tHe
training of the boys who will in the
next three years play important
roles in Stanford's basketball hopes

Basketball on the Farm is not
something new to the 6' 4", 200-
pound who played on the good Stan
lord teams of 1941, '42, '43. He was
also captain of the 1940 Frosh team.
Twenty-five year old "Jake", as
he was known, in his under-graduate
days, played first substitute under
Don Durness. Indian great. When
that notable was sidelined in the
NCAA tourney in 1942, Dana filled
the gap and came up with a 14-

point tourney effort in the victory
over Dartmouth that gave the Cards
the national championship.
Others on the NCAA top team of
1942 were Jim Pollard, Howie Dal
nar, Ed Voss, and Bill Cowden.
.MCELLENT BACKBOARD MAN
D.-m-i was first string forward in
19-fM and it was at that time that he
eached his top form. A Daily ar
icle of that year spoke of him as

vent on to say "if he gets set in
nid-court, it's a cinch two points."
