## Boxers Meet Bruins in LA 
### 
Ray Lunny's slightly battered
boxers will make their first south
land appearance Saturday afternoon
when the Cards meet the Bruins in
Westwood Village.
The Uclans broke even with the
highly touted Cal team last month.
Fred Ten Eyek, 165-pound punch
er, may not see action in Saturday's
competition because of a possible
fractured nose. Irwin Rose and Dick
Hoffman (1(35) are both recovering
from cases of flu.
Willie Altus, 155-pt und mainstay
for the varsity boxers, Jay Savage
(135), and Oren Rush (155) are the
only men on the southbound squad
who are in "good condition," ac
cording to mentor Ray Lunny.
Competing for the UCLA squad
will be four of the men who won
against the Bears in January.
Joe Cranmer. Indian heavyweight,
will fight an exhibition match with
West Mathews, UCLA heavyweight.
A colorful innovation is being
tried. The fights will be held in a
ring set up on the Royce Hall stage.
This main auditorium on the cam
pus has a capacity of 2.500 persons
and every seat gives an excellent
view of the action in the ring.
