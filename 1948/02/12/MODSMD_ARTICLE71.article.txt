### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 11 (UP).
A smoldering l'eud between ex-
Coach Ed (Tex) McKeever and his
successor at the University <jf San
Francisco, Joe Kuharich, blazed
into the open today as a "white
letter" written by McKeever ex
posing USF's athletic policy was re
vealed.
The letter, revealing the fact that
| some of the players wore paid "sub
j stantial sums," and had played at
two or three other schools before
' matriculating at USF, was ad
dressed to Father Jerome Sullivan, 1
moderator at USF. Carbon copies j
J of the letter were sent to athletic
. authorities at California, Stanford,
St. Mary's, and Santa Clara.
| ATTEMPT TO SMEAR
i Kuharich, who came here as Mc- j
; Keever's assistant but hasn't spo- j
ken to his former boss since the :
j Villanova game in late season, I
| termed the letter a "deliberate at- j
: tempt to smear" athletes at USF,
and the USF athletic policy.
"In McKeever's letter there are 1
many misstatements," said Kuha
| rich. "He is hurting the boys more '
j than he is hurting "the school or |
j me."
Vic Schmidt, commissioner of the !
j Pacific Coast Conference, told the
United Press that he had a copy of
j the letter in his hands—but could |
i make no comment at this time.
Among other things in this let
i ter, McKeever said that under the 1
! new NCAA Sanity Code. "USF will
: no longer be able to pay its athletes >
' from $40 to $75 per month and, in
I some istances, a more substantial :
fund."
NAMED 21 PLAYERS
The letter named 21 players and
gave their past records. Father Sul
livan said that he would have to
check into the records of the play
-5 ers in most cases before he could
| comment.
"As far as the past .of USF is con
cerned. we never played a game
