To the Editor:
Excom has voted not to give the SIRO an additional $600 to carry on
its relief work, which means the end of that oragnization as an ACTIVE
agency.
True, we could still collect clothes, conduct drives, and give the pro
ceeds to a larger organization, but the most fundamental function of
SIRO could not operate. The files of SIRO are filled with names from
every countryâ€”relatives and friends of Stanfordites and the residents
of neighboring cities. Most of these people have been sent at least one
package, and many grateful replies have been received.
Cellar Pete's relatives in Holland are operating a distributing center
and have been well supplies with clothes from Stanford. Roble Hall
conducted a very successful drive last week, and their clothes are all
packaged and ready to be sent to a Roble girl's mother in Canton. China,
to be distributed. These, and many other deserving people, will be de
prived of our aid unless Excom will help us.
Stanford was once criticized for its "Ivory Tower'" attitude. It was
said that Farm students were contented and smug in their comfortable
isolation from world affairs. We have now lost that attitude due to such
groups as lIR and NSA. Discussions and conferences are important and
useful in their way, but SIRO is an active agency with tangible results.
Since it is a working agency, it needs money to work with, and since it
cannot be self-supporting, it has to rely upon Excom for funds.
If this were war-time, funds would probably be generously given,
for the spirit of the country during a national emergency is "all out for
the cause." But why not give some money for the peace effort, just as
you would for the war effort? Perhaps our "ounce of prevention." added
to the work of other colleges and national oragnizations, can contribute
toward a lasting peace.
SIRO asks the student body to help them help the needy people over
seas, that they may be able to help themselves.
