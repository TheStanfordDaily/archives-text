I do not believe Excom or the students have the facts concerning
SIRO's functions, past and future. Nor do I believe they -realize the full
import of their close decision in refusing shipping funds.
SIRO was created to help meet the dire emergency of relief through
out the world. This was to be a Stanford relief project; a personalized
method not only of giving aid but of making contacts, establishing cor
respondence and friendships, creating understanding, and fostering hope.
If these objectives are to be met where else can we hope to find the
leadership but in the colleges—students to students.
Are we to turn back into our shll; ignore the world emergency and
the human element within it? I don't believe for a moment that was
Exconrs intentions. Yet, if SIRO is allowed to die oft, and die it will
because the all-campus organization exists to send packages directly
abroad and handle correspondence, it will be the first step towards
inward isolation.
SIRO today is the only campus group in direct contact with other
students and people of the United Nations. Think of it! Shall we know
ingly break this international tie?
Stanford is nationally recognized for its tremendous spirit, leadership,
program. UNESCO and the State Department have expressed acknowl
edgement and appreciation of our past achievements. Are we to stop
now? Certainly, if we are to have world peace it can only be achieved
by the spirit of such cooperation.
