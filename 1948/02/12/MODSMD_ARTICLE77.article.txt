To the Editor:
Please allow an alumnus to give his opinion on the SIRO question.
SIRO is one of the finest things ever undertaken by the ASSU. Excom
has done the students a disservice by terminating the program; it was
one of the few items in Stanford's international organization that ever
showed tangible results. t
Perhaps the money actually could be better spent elsewhere. I don't
know—but Excom does not always spend money intelligently. Example:
the sending abroad of two Stanford students last summer at. no incon
siderable expense. If that trip accomplished anything it was too subtle
for me to see.
The money would have been better spent had it been turned over to
SIRO. which is—or was-STANFORD'S OWN PROGRAM. Yes, the Red
Cross or CARE might do a better job of adn 'nitration—but will Stan
ford students contribute to them as they did 10 theii own organizatAon.
I think not.
