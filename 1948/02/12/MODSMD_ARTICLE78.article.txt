(This is the firs! of a series of articles describing
the results of a survey of college veterans hased on
the responses received from interviews with a sci
entifically selected sample of veterans attending all
types of colleges located throughout the country.
The study was planned by a national committee
appointed by the American Council on Education
and was made possible by a grant of funds from the
Disabled American Veterans. Dean E. G. William
son of the University of Minnesota acted as chair
man of the committee. Ralph J. Strom, formerly of
the Veterans Administration, was director of the
project and conducted the survey).

Veterans all over the country have been request
ing increases in the $65 monthly allotment for single
students and the $90 per month for married veterans
so that they may remain in school despite skyrock
eting living costs.
A portion of a survey on veterans' education re
cently completed by the American Council on Educa
tion and financed by the Disabled American Veterans,
was devoted to an investigation of the cost of living
of a scientifically selected and representative cross
section of veterans attending colleges and universities
throughout continental United States.
To determine how much of a differential exists
between the $65 and $90 monthly subsistence pay
ments, and their actual living expenses, each veteran
contacted in the nationwide poll was asked to make
a careful estimate of his average total monthly ex
penses while attending school.
.Results of the poll indicate that the average total
monthly expenses of single veterans in college is
$106.13, while the average for married veteran col
lege students is $175.38. This means that single stud
ents spent $106.13 monthly but received only $65, a
difference of $41.13. Married students spent $175.38
but received only $90 from the Veterans Administra
tion, a difference of $85.38.
Board and room costs of the large number of
single veteran students who reported paying for
their room and board in one lump sum were found
to have an average of $55.19 monthly. However, in
the case of single veterans who said they found it
necessary to eat at places other than where they
roomed the average cost of their meals alone was
found to be $51.08 monthly. This amount, in addition
to the average sum of $21.48 which veterans in this
group pay for room rent brings the monthly cost of
room and board to $72.56.
Married veteran students, according to the poll,
spent an average amount of $38.96 for rent monthly,
while their average outlay for food was found to be
$67.71, adding up to a total of $106.67 for rent and
food ($16.67 more than the total subsistence allow
ance).
In order to make ends meet, many veterans work
during school terms, and the wives of a great number
of married veterans hold jobs on either a full-time
or part-time basis. Summer vacation jobs are help
ful to a large percentage seeking to augment their
income.
Results of the nationwide study indicated that
36 per cent of college student veterans work for addi
tional income, 12 per cent up to 10 hours during the
week; 14 per cent from 11 to 20 hours; and the re
maining 10 per cent more than 20 hours a week.
Of the more than one-third of the college veterans
employed, the survey showed that 46 per cent earn
$10 or less, 33 per cent earn from $11 to $20 and 13
per cent earn from $21 to $30. Earnings of the re
maining 8 per cent range from $31 to $105.
To help pay their living expenses and in an effort
to set aside additional funds for supplemental financ
ing of their educational costs during the current
school year, six out of 10 veterans worked to some
extent during the last summer months, according
to the poll.
