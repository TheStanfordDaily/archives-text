## HISTORY 1948 
### 
Going (o high school in Germany was never a
pleasant experience. In dictatorially conducted class
rooms teachers worked to propagate a sterile intel
lectual tradition blended generously with a heavy
{lose of nationalism. The most interesting topics
reached the students as dull and lifeless lectures.
Independent thinking was not only discouraged but
punished.
In these surroundings students became disgusted
with learning, gave up any attempt to find solutions
to their country's problems, and joined political ex
tremist groups that gave easy answers. Long before
Hitler the German high schools and universities were
the hotbeds of nationalism.
We have recognized that this must be changed.
In the words of the S. F. Chronicle, the final victory
"is not political or economic, but educational—the
campaign to re-educate, re-direct, re-orient the Ger
man mind."
But we are failing in this campaign. Fred Hech
iriger writes in the authoritative Military Govern
ment Journal and in Harper's that extreme nation
alists are once again in control of the schools in
the American zone.
He describes in detail how "all reforms have been
systematically opposed, delayed, and pared down
to ineffectiveness" by the teachers. He points out
that the few liberal instructors are pushed into the
background and ostracized by other faculty members.
He points to the Minister of Education in Bavaria—
the key section of our zone—whose first act was the
introduction of corporal punishment, his second to
relegate women educators to minor positions. In
his schools "narrow prejudices and provincialism
are rampant."
Hechinger concludes that "by and large the
German classroom has not changed"—the same pro
fessors teach the same jingoistic doctrines in the
same autocratic manner.
The blame, according to Hechinger, rests with
the top-level policy of our Military Government. This
policy insists that the Germans are to use their own
methods; "reforms are not to be 'imposed' lest they
be labeled 'undemocratic'." He points out this has
made a laughing-stock of the word democracy in
Germany. He writes of an anti-Nazi teacher who
pleaded with him:
"Can't you see that the old nationalistic elements
play up their obstructionist ideas as untouchably
democratic measures while they decry American re
form as Military Government dictatorship?"
By contrast the French in their zone have no
such scruples about "imposing" reforms. They have
an educational staff of 400. They also have a French
college student as observer in every high school.
They have distributed six million new textbooks
in their small zone.
In our zone students are told to look for texts in
the libraries of the parents. We have a staff of si>
to supervise 26.000 teachers. That is, we had 56
until last year when Congress "economized" and
cut it to 50. The S.F. Chronicle recently devoted an
editorial to the subject. It wrote that "clearly, the
United States is falling down on the most delicate
and most important of its occupation jobs."
If we loose the battle for the German mind we
have lost the war. The cost of failure will be oui
lives. For if we cannot chaneg the German class
room we will not be secure, no matter how long
we stay there. In the words of the Chronicle:
"Twice in a century this passionately nationalist
spirit was inflamed in the German schools, and the
result was the same whether the Kaiser had charge
of them or Hitler had charge of them. Unless we
correct our shortcomings, the result will be the
same some day again, even though American democ
racy is nominally in charge now."

the hotbeds of nationalism.
We have recognized that this must be changed.
In the words of the S. F. Chronicle, the final victory
"is not political or economic, but educational—the
campaign to re-educate, re-direct, re-orient the Ger
man mind."
But we are failing in this campaign. Fred Hech
iriger writes in the authoritative Military Govern
ment Journal and in Harper's that extreme nation
alists are once again in control of the schools in
the American zone.
He describes in detail how "all reforms have been
systematically opposed, delayed, and pared down
to ineffectiveness" by the teachers. He points out
that the few liberal instructors are pushed into the
background and ostracized by other faculty members.
He points to the Minister of Education in Bavaria—
the key section of our zone—whose first act was the
introduction of corporal punishment, his second to
relegate women educators to minor positions. In
his schools "narrow prejudices and provincialism
are rampant."
Hechinger concludes that "by and large the
German classroom has not changed"—the same pro
fessors teach the same jingoistic doctrines in the
same autocratic manner.
The blame, according to Hechinger, rests with
the top-level policy of our Military Government. This
policy insists that the Germans are to use their own
methods; "reforms are not to be 'imposed' lest they
be labeled 'undemocratic'." He points out this has
made a laughing-stock of the word democracy in
Germany. He writes of an anti-Nazi teacher who
pleaded with him:
"Can't you see that the old nationalistic elements
play up their obstructionist ideas as untouchably
democratic measures while they decry American re
form as Military Government dictatorship?"
By contrast the French in their zone have no
such scruples about "imposing" reforms. They have
an educational staff of 400. They also have a French
college student as observer in every high school.
They have distributed six million new textbooks
in their small zone.
In our zone students are told to look for texts in
the libraries of the parents. We have a staff of si>
to supervise 26.000 teachers. That is, we had 56
until last year when Congress "economized" and
cut it to 50. The S.F. Chronicle recently devoted an
editorial to the subject. It wrote that "clearly, the
United States is falling down on the most delicate
and most important of its occupation jobs."
If we loose the battle for the German mind we
have lost the war. The cost of failure will be oui
lives. For if we cannot chaneg the German class
room we will not be secure, no matter how long
we stay there. In the words of the Chronicle:
"Twice in a century this passionately nationalist
spirit was inflamed in the German schools, and the
result was the same whether the Kaiser had charge
of them or Hitler had charge of them. Unless we
correct our shortcomings, the result will be the
same some day again, even though American democ
racy is nominally in charge now."
Going (o high school in Germany was never a
pleasant experience. In dictatorially conducted class
rooms teachers worked to propagate a sterile intel
lectual tradition blended generously with a heavy
{lose of nationalism. The most interesting topics
reached the students as dull and lifeless lectures.
Independent thinking was not only discouraged but
punished.
In these surroundings students became disgusted
with learning, gave up any attempt to find solutions
to their country's problems, and joined political ex
tremist groups that gave easy answers. Long before
Hitler the German high schools and universities were
the hotbeds of nationalism.
We have recognized that this must be changed.
