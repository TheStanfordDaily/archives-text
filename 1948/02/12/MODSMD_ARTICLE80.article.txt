## BULL SESSION 
### 
I see by the papers of a couple of days ago that
another fistic encounter has taken place on Holly
wood's famed "Sunset strip."
This time it was Xavier Cugat and Oleg Cassini.
The latter designs dresses. His only claim to fame
is his former marriage to Gene Tierney, and more
recently, his invitation for Mrs. Cugat to dance with
him.
I understand that Ciro's is installing a canvas
floor and resin boxes in the corners.
What with a fight taking place every night they'll
soon call it Ciro's square garden. And don't think
they won't charge e\tra for the floor show.
Maybe that's what they mean by a "ringside
table."
Don't think that Ciro's is monopolizing the show.
Them cocambo and other glittery spots are having
their share of brawls. Its getting to be a fad. Hol
lywooders don't greet each other in the old way any
more. They say:
"Who ya' fightin' tonight."
Only the rich stars can afford to fight in night
clubs. The poor men still have to stay home and
fight with their wives.
I suppose that a few drinks under the belt give
these beglamored pugilists the courage to throw
punches aimed at the same place. Well, that's what
the old western settlers did when the Indians dis
guised themselves under the buffalo hides—they hit
below the pelt. All's fair in love and Hollywood.
As I say. liquor probably causes more fights
than Westbrook Pegler.

Specially in Hollywood where everyone drinks,
single or married. The single men drink for pleasure,
the married men from sorrow. Even Allen Jenkin's
cat drinks. At least that's what the police report
showed when they hauled both of them in for
drunken driving. Jenkins says his cat "Smiley"
was at the wheel at the time.
I can understand a man drinking, but cats usually
show better sense. Both cat and man are born with
a hankering for milk. It's only the man that de
velops gustatory perversion.
Do I sound like the WCTU clip sheet?
Maybe it's because I was just reading some figure
on milk. The statistician, who has some sinister
connection with milk, states that "enough milk is
produced annually in the United States to liil a river
3,000 miles long. 40 feet wide and three feet deep.
The facts aren't of much importance unless you're
Allen Jenkin's cat, but I wonder at the human race,
which learned to produce good whiskey, good wine,
and good beer long before it learned how to produce
good milk.
Still, no one ever had the singular privilege, as
far as I ki v, of fighting with Xavier Cugat after
drinking sr'\ of milk.
And no ~jl ver drove a car, pretended he could
drive a car, ot- was accused of driving a car until
Smiley and his owner started drinking whiskey,
wine and/or beer.
Well, it could happen only in Hollywood. If
California is '> State, then Hollywood is a condition.

I can understand a man drinking, but cats usually
show better sense. Both cat and man are born with
a hankering for milk. It's only the man that de
velops gustatory perversion.
Do I sound like the WCTU clip sheet?
Maybe it's because I was just reading some figure
on milk. The statistician, who has some sinister
connection with milk, states that "enough milk is
produced annually in the United States to liil a river
3,000 miles long. 40 feet wide and three feet deep.
The facts aren't of much importance unless you're
Allen Jenkin's cat, but I wonder at the human race,
which learned to produce good whiskey, good wine,
and good beer long before it learned how to produce
good milk.
Still, no one ever had the singular privilege, as
far as I ki v, of fighting with Xavier Cugat after
drinking sr'\ of milk.
And no ~jl ver drove a car, pretended he could
drive a car, ot- was accused of driving a car until
Smiley and his owner started drinking whiskey,
wine and/or beer.
Well, it could happen only in Hollywood. If
California is '> State, then Hollywood is a condition.
I see by the papers of a couple of days ago that
another fistic encounter has taken place on Holly
wood's famed "Sunset strip."
This time it was Xavier Cugat and Oleg Cassini.
The latter designs dresses. His only claim to fame
is his former marriage to Gene Tierney, and more
recently, his invitation for Mrs. Cugat to dance with
him.
I understand that Ciro's is installing a canvas
floor and resin boxes in the corners.
What with a fight taking place every night they'll
soon call it Ciro's square garden. And don't think
they won't charge e\tra for the floor show.
Maybe that's what they mean by a "ringside
table."
Don't think that Ciro's is monopolizing the show.
Them cocambo and other glittery spots are having
their share of brawls. Its getting to be a fad. Hol
lywooders don't greet each other in the old way any
more. They say:
"Who ya' fightin' tonight."
Only the rich stars can afford to fight in night
clubs. The poor men still have to stay home and
fight with their wives.
I suppose that a few drinks under the belt give
these beglamored pugilists the courage to throw
punches aimed at the same place. Well, that's what
the old western settlers did when the Indians dis
guised themselves under the buffalo hides—they hit
below the pelt. All's fair in love and Hollywood.
As I say. liquor probably causes more fights
than Westbrook Pegler.

Specially in Hollywood where everyone drinks,
single or married. The single men drink for pleasure,
the married men from sorrow. Even Allen Jenkin's
cat drinks. At least that's what the police report
showed when they hauled both of them in for
drunken driving. Jenkins says his cat "Smiley"
was at the wheel at the time.
