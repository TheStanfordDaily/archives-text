# Stanford to Battle USC, UCLA
## Both Given Even Chance 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford goes back to the confer
ence cage wars this weekend when
the varsity takes on the UCLA
Bruins and the USC Trojans in the
Pavilion. The Cards lead off tonight
at 8 against the Bruins. Tomorrow
night they meet the Trojans.
Every seat in the runt-sized Pa
vilion will be filled as Everett Dean
men go after their "first conference
win. Dean's cagers are in the best
shape they've been in all year, and
they plan to throw everything they
have at the invading Bruins.
STANFORD STARTERS
Starting the game for Stanford will
be Morley Thompson and Bill Rose
at forwards. Bill Stephenson at ten
ter, and Babe Kiggins and Dave Da
vidson at the guards. Thompson al-,
ways seems to play his best ball
against the Bruins, and has aver
aged 19 points in his last two ap
pearances against them.
Davidson will be a big help tc
Card chances for taking UCLA, a.»
Dave was out of the lineup with
the flu when UCLA beat Stanford
in their first meeting. Davidson L
in top condition now and has beer
sparkling in practice all week.
STANICH AND WEST
UCLA is led by a capable front
firing line of Johnny Stanich (5-10
and Dick West (5-10), backed up
;by the all-around Dave Minor (6-2)
i These three men carry most of the
| offensive load, especially Stanich,
who has been dynamite against Stan
ford.
Cene Williams, tallest Bruin at
6-4 1 j, will probably start at the
center spot for UCLA. Williams re
places George Stanich who broke
his wrist in the series against USC
Rounding out the team is guard Bill
Rankin who is good on the boards,
using his 6-4 height to advantage.
Stanford is most effective agains:
! UCLA when using a slow-breaking.
! deliberate type of offense. In thei:
j first meeting, the Cards led UCLA
j as long a$ they stayed with the slov.
j stuff, but when they tried to race
J with the Bruins they were lost.
BRUINS IN A HURRY
| The Bruins are fast and deceptive,
and at times they are deadly. They
I are at their best when they can get
j another team to abandon its plan
ned offense to play the loose, hurry -
| scurry game that the Bruins like.
The pressing defense that UCLA
sometimes uses bothered the In«
lians in Los Angeles, but the cngers
ot. a good chance to iron out cS<?se ;
roubles against Bradley Tech. If
'.tanford can do as well against the
kuins tonight they should wind up
he evening with their first oonfer
nce win.
IESEJtVK POWER
Both teams are backed up by ex- ;
e-rienced reserves, with Stanford j
robably having the edge in this
epartment. However, it was Bruin
eserve Guy Buccola who was the
Kin behind UCLA's first win. Be
ides Buccola, UCLA has Chuck
lustka, Ron Pearson and Allan
awyer.
Stanford's leading replacements (
re Bob Lewis and Gus Chavalas at
uards, Milt Iverson and George
ardley at forwards, and Bob Penn ;
r Ralph Carver at center.
While Stanford and UCLA are •
fixing it at the Pavilion, Califor
ia will be entertaining USC. Sat
rday night everyone will change j
artners.
A limited number of tickets for
oth games will go on public sale
arting at 8:30 this morning at the
AC, Don Liebendorfer announced. '

Stanford goes back to the confer
ence cage wars this weekend when
the varsity takes on the UCLA
Bruins and the USC Trojans in the
Pavilion. The Cards lead off tonight
at 8 against the Bruins. Tomorrow
night they meet the Trojans.
Every seat in the runt-sized Pa
vilion will be filled as Everett Dean
men go after their "first conference
win. Dean's cagers are in the best
shape they've been in all year, and
they plan to throw everything they
have at the invading Bruins.
STANFORD STARTERS
Starting the game for Stanford will
be Morley Thompson and Bill Rose
at forwards. Bill Stephenson at ten
ter, and Babe Kiggins and Dave Da
vidson at the guards. Thompson al-,
ways seems to play his best ball
against the Bruins, and has aver
aged 19 points in his last two ap
pearances against them.
Davidson will be a big help tc
Card chances for taking UCLA, a.»
Dave was out of the lineup with
the flu when UCLA beat Stanford
in their first meeting. Davidson L
in top condition now and has beer
sparkling in practice all week.
STANICH AND WEST
UCLA is led by a capable front
firing line of Johnny Stanich (5-10
and Dick West (5-10), backed up
;by the all-around Dave Minor (6-2)
i These three men carry most of the
| offensive load, especially Stanich,
who has been dynamite against Stan
ford.
Cene Williams, tallest Bruin at
6-4 1 j, will probably start at the
center spot for UCLA. Williams re
places George Stanich who broke
his wrist in the series against USC
Rounding out the team is guard Bill
Rankin who is good on the boards,
using his 6-4 height to advantage.
Stanford is most effective agains:
! UCLA when using a slow-breaking.
! deliberate type of offense. In thei:
j first meeting, the Cards led UCLA
j as long a$ they stayed with the slov.
j stuff, but when they tried to race
J with the Bruins they were lost.
BRUINS IN A HURRY
| The Bruins are fast and deceptive,
and at times they are deadly. They
I are at their best when they can get
j another team to abandon its plan
ned offense to play the loose, hurry -
| scurry game that the Bruins like.
The pressing defense that UCLA
sometimes uses bothered the In«
lians in Los Angeles, but the cngers
ot. a good chance to iron out cS<?se ;
roubles against Bradley Tech. If
'.tanford can do as well against the
kuins tonight they should wind up
he evening with their first oonfer
nce win.
IESEJtVK POWER
Both teams are backed up by ex- ;
e-rienced reserves, with Stanford j
robably having the edge in this
epartment. However, it was Bruin
eserve Guy Buccola who was the
Kin behind UCLA's first win. Be
ides Buccola, UCLA has Chuck
lustka, Ron Pearson and Allan
awyer.
Stanford's leading replacements (
re Bob Lewis and Gus Chavalas at
uards, Milt Iverson and George
ardley at forwards, and Bob Penn ;
