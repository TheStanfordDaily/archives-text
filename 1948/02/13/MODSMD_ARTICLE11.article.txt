WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UP).—
President Truman repeated his de
mand for anti-infialion legislation
today but a Republican spokesman
retorted that Congress should do
nothing until il knows whether the
market crash has brought about a
"stabilizing recession."
The President tolcl a news confer
ence that the week-old tailspin in
the commodity and stock markets is
a step in the right direction. But
he said inflation is still the major
economic threat to the nation and
that stand-by wage, price, and ra
tioning controls are needed as ur
gently as ever.
He was challenged immediately
by Chairman Jesse P. Wolcott, R.,
Mich., of the House Banking Com
mittee which is considering the
President's anti-inflation proposals.
Wolcott said probably the best
thing Congress could do for the time

being would be to extend the pres
ent rent control law for 30 days and
hold up all other economic legisla
tion "until we know where we're
going."
"If prices continue to drop for
the next 10 days or two weeks, or
do not go back up, we can assume
this is the stabilizing recession we've
been looking for," he said.
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12 (UP).
— Nose - diving meat prices may
never rise again to the super-high
postwar levels reached in January,
Albert T. Luer, chairman of the
Western Meat Packers' Association,
predicted tonight.
Luer said prices are fa'ling be
cause the American housewife is
feci up with the high cost of living
and will not support soaring prices
any longer.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 12 (UP).—
Divergent theories that the admin
istration and big speculators were
responsible for the break in com
modity markets were advanced to
day by two members of Congress
while a cotton expert scouted the
possibility that market "gamblers"
could have caused the decline.
On the House floor Rep. Charles
H. Robertson. R.. N.D., said the ad
ministration had purposely caused a
market panic "to buy CIO - PAC
votes with cheap food, even though
it means ruination of the farmers."
