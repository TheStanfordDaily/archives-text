### 
SEATTLE. Feb. 12 (UP). â€”Sen.
Leveiett Saltonstall. R., Mass., to
night administered a gentle wrist
slapping to avowed Republican
Presidential nomination candidates
for bickering among themselves.
Saltonstall concluded his address
with a plea to Republicans to "pull
together in harness from now until
election day."
"Within our party today we are
watching some fine and able men
contending for the Republican nom
ination for President," he said. "It
eives us a chance to hear these can
didates debate their views openly
and fearlessly."
