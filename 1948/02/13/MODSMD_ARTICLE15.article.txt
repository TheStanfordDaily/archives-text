ALLAHABAD, India, Feb. 12 (UP) —The ashes and charred
bones of Mohandas K. Gandhi were scattered from a brass urn
into the Holy Ganges river at its confluence with the Jumna
today and, in the belief of Hindus, India's assassinated "apostle
of peace" thus joined the immortals in Heaven.
Devadas and "Ramdas Gandhi, the martyred leader's sons,

♦"tilted the urn and spilled the cre
| mated remains into the muddy green
Holy water from a white-painted
j war-time "duck."
A crowd estimated at between 2,-
000.000 and 3,000,000 lined the fun
eral procession or massed on the
I sandy river bank—untouchables.
I cabinet ministers, potentates.
As the ashes touched the water
: the multitudes joined in a great roar
of "Mahatma Gandhi Ki Jai"—Vic
tory to Mahatma Gandhi. Some
wept. Some stood mute, their hands
I clasped before their faces.
At the moment the climax of the
i immersion ceremony was reached
j here parts of Gandhi's ashes were
; scattered into Holy rivers in the
! chief cities of India's nine provinc-
I es. A portion ol' the ashes are being
kept to place in the foundations
!of memorials.
Throughout the dominion the day
was devoted to the memory of the
man who was .shot dead by a fellow
Hindu because he prcached peace
and friendship with Moslems.
