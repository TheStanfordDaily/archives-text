# Troy Seeks Repeat Win
## 
### 
Sam Barry's Tiojans from USC
I will take over the Pavilion tomor- |
i row night in search of their second
; straight win over the Indians.
} USC's first win over Stanford was j
! in the opening game of the season 1
when they came from behind in the j
j last three minutes to score an up- j
set, 39-33. After that, Troy dropped >
; a game to California and split with j
UCLA.
I
The Trojans always use a strict ;
: man-to-man defense, wih an offense i
that works through the center. Alex I
Hannum is the key man, and when !
! big Alex is "on," the Trojans get i
t tough.
Forward Bill Sharman was the
boy who beat Stanford with 14 j
j points in the second half. He and j
his running mate, Abe Androff, |
I make a smooth front line combina- ;
j lion.
At guards, Fred Bertram is con-
I sidered to be one of the finest de- j
fensive men in the league. Fifth j
man Earl Wallis is a tall, powerful
j guard on the boards, but he makes j
' few points.
Stanford may come up with the
fast-break team to run away from j
the heavy - footed Trojans. Coach
I Dean has been experimenting in
j practice with the speedsters. Thus,
Chavalas. Yardley, and Iverson may
see plenty of action.
