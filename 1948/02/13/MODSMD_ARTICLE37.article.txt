Double trouble in the form of a
couple of pretty hot quintets face
Card hoopsters over the weekend.
There's no denying it—both UCLA
and L'SC have outstanding squads,
but they are by no means invincible.
An undercurrent of campus
grumbling seems to be selling the
team short—ours, that is.
HOW DKKP TI»: CELLAR?
Granted, we're in the cellar as
far as the Southern Division race
goes, but conference standings are
far from indicative of the quality of
Stanford basketballing. Any mem
ber of the Bradley Tech squad can
testily to that.
The locals have been plagued all
season by almost every tough break
of the game, outstanding of which
was the dread malady cf having
victory virtually in hand, only to
lose it in the final two or three
minutes. The record doesn't look
good, but that sort of thing can't go
on forever. And if the Bruins and
Trojans count on it they're in for
the surprise of their lives.

that needs it—the squad out in front
gets it automatically.
Our team merits and needs the
full-fledged support of every Card
rooter. It may well spell the differ
ence between victory and defeat to
night and tomorrow
