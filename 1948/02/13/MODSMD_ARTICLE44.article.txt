## Att'n: Men's Council 
### 
"A new broom sweeps clean!"
We hope so.
Student self-government here at Stanford, or any other place
for that matter, is a failure â€”unless it can achieve and maintain
respect and dignity, not only from the Administration but, more
important, from the students themselves.
Several times during the past year, Men's Council has not
had all the respect necessary for its effective operation as a
judicial body. This was largely due to Council's own action.
This is not necessarily to imply that Men's Council has been
swayed by irrelavent considerations or that it acted contrary to
the letter and spirit of the ASSU Constitution. But in some cases
it did not arrive at and carry out decisions in the most prudent
manner. Some decisions left either a bad taste or a horse-laugh.
The most important function of Men's Council is the trying
of Honor Code violations. Council members must exercise this
power with the utmost care and judgment. If the enforcement
of the Honor Code is faulty, the Code itself is of no value. When
the Honor Code fails, the most vital core of our student govern
ment is gone.
The Honor Code, and self-government, were achieved only
after many years of effort by the students. Will they both now
fall into disrepute because of the unconsidered judgments of
Men's Council?
The four new members of Men's Council have it in their
power to determine the future of student government here at
Stanford. Is it to break down because of unwise decisions by
that body, or will it retain its present strength and respectability?
Tom Diamond, A 1 Munk, Bill Richardson, and Dave Guyer will
have a major share in chosing the course it will take.
Briefly, what we are saying is that Men's Council should no
longer be a "big wheel" stepping stone to future campus politics.
You men are not playing for the grandstand; you're supposed to
be giving out justice. That's an inconspicuous and serious bus
iness.
It's a lot of responsibility. Do a good job.
