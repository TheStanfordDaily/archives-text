## Is Stanford Guilty? 
### 
To the Editor:
Many thanks to the Daily for its series of articles on the report of
the President's Committee on Civil Rights.
Doesn't the Committee's condemnation of housing discrimination strike
rather close to home? In other words, isn't the Stanford "family" guilty
of practicing segregation based on religion and race?
This does not imply that the University discriminates in the admission
of minority students —it was pretty well established last summer that the
Universiy has no restrictive policy toward any group.
But it is rather obvious that the housing of minority students is not
free of some segregation. It is no secret that fraternities, with some
exceptions I suppose, have tacit understandings that there will be only
a limited number of Catholics, few if any Jews, and no Negroes. Their
rationalization is that fraternity life is intimate in its relationships and
that naturally no one would care to share these relationships with other
than white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
And What does the University housing bureau do when a minority
student registers? Is he or she casually assigned to University living
quarters or is there careful consideration of the case so there will be
no "embarrassment?" I'd like to know.
Yes, "The Winds of Freedom Blow"—for white Anglo-Saxon Protect
ant 100 per cent Americans.
