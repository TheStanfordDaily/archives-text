# About 'Specific Conditions'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply lo Mr. Herman Bistrin's letterâ€”we fully realize that Stanford
University is located 3500 miles from the ocean, the New York Times,
and the United Nations. Although v.e are governed by the Stanford
Charter, on weekends and holidays we enjoy the privileges of the
United States Constitution and believe that upon graduation we will
return to the world as full-fledged A.nerican citizens.
Although constant readers of the Stanford Daily, perpetual hitch
hikers from the Village, and eavesdroppers at the Cellar, we have yet
to hear the "specific conditions" on the Stanford campus which make the
observance of the principles of the United States Constitution unfeasible.
