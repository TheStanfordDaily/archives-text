# Li'l Injun Calls Farm Rain Dance Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Li'l Injun is trying to
coax the clouds into raining
over parched Lagunita Lake.
Just in case the Chief isn't
successful, he asks that all
Farm students dedicate one
of their dances tomorrow night
to rain. His cousin performed
a rain dance in Southern Cal
ifornia and achieved immed
iate results.
Other developments on the
rain front: Alf Brandin has
issued a new letter about ra
tioning of water on campus.
A deep well is to be dug.
"Rain" comes to Memorial
Hall Sunday night.
