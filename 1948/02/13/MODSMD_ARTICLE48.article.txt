The tremendous growth of colleges and univers
ities in this country since the end of the war through
the enrollment of one and one-quarter million veter
ans has raised numerous questions as to the ade
quacy of the instruction given to our ex-servicemen.
The answers to what the veterans themselves
think of the instruction or teaching to which they
have keen subjected were learned in the nationwide
poll of student veterans just completed by a com
mittee of the American Council on Education and
financed by the Disabled American Veterans.
Quality of college instruction was rated "average"
to "very good" by 89 per cent of the veterans polled,
while 7 per cent said they considered their instruc
tion as "inferior" and only one per cent branded
college teaching as "very poor." In the survey, 3
per cent had no opinion.
Of the 89 per cent evidently satisfied with the
instruction they are getting. 33 per cent described it
as "average," 35 per cent as "good" and 21 per cent
as "very good."
Asked whether they felt that the present day
greatly increased enrollments had lowered or raised
the educational standards of their institutions, only
24 per cent of the student veterans replied that
standards had been lowered. No appreciable change
in standards was reported by 2(5 per cent, and 43
per cent stated they felt that educational standards
in their institutions actually had been raised as a
result of the enrollment increase.
Of those who thought that the standards had been
lowered, 31 per cent said that it was because of
crowded classes, and 29 per cent expressed the opin
ion that the large enrollments resulted in less indi
vidual attention. Another 17 per cent asserted that
their professors and instructors were not sufficiently
qualified to teach, while 7 per cent saw a lowering of
standards because of lack of teaching facilities such
as laboratory materials, books, etc.
Increased competition among students for grades
was cited as the reason primarily responsible for
the increase in standards by 37 per cent of the
group which felt that large enrollments had resulted
in such an increase. Greater maturity of students
was the reason advanced by a fifth of this group,
while another fifth attributed the higher standards
to current higher college entrance requirements and
to raised graduation and class requirements in grades.
Other factors cited by this group as causes included:
"more and better professors." ti per cent: "tougher
courses." 4 per cent; "school tries to get rid of the
less fit." 3 per cent; and "larger selection of new
courses," 3 per cent.
Six out of every 10 veterans in college, accord
ing to the nationwide poll, feel that their present day
attitude toward their education is different from that
of non-veterans. Twenty-eight per cent said they
believe their attitude to be essentially the same
as those students who had not been in service, while
12 per cent had formed no opinion.*
When asked why they felt that their attitude is
different, 4ti per cent of the responding group stated
they believed the difference to be due to the fact
that veterans are more serious than non-veteran
students about their work. Twenty per cent said
they thought veterans were more mature in their
approach to college studies, 19 per cent said they
had more practical and definite goals than the non
veteran and another 17 per cent contended that vet
erans realized more fully the value of the educational
program which they are now undertaking.
Considerable variation was found when the re
sponses of married and single, disabled and non
disabled veterans on the question of attitude toward
education were compared.
Oi' the married disabled veterans, more than 72
per cent replied that their attitude differs from that
of the non-veteran student, while 65 per cent of
the married non-disabled veterans answered in this
manner. That their attitude toward education differs
from that of non-veterans was the opinion of t>2
per cent of the single disabled veterans and 57 per
cent of the single non-disabled veterans.
Fifty-seven per cent of the married disabled vet
erans who stated that their attitude differs from the
non-veteran student said it is because they are more
serious about getting an education. Half of the
unmarried disabled veterans in this group agreed
with this statement, as did 49 per cent of die married
non-disabled veterans and 42 pen- cent of the single

non-disablecl veterans in this group.
Of all of the married veterans who reported
a difference in attitude, 23 per cent credited the
difference to their "own increased maturity, while
18 per cent of the single veterans in this category
offered the same explanation.
Veterans in college, the survey shows, are for
the most part pretty well satisfied with college life.
93 per cent reporting either that they are well satis
fied or that they have "just a few gripes." Only (J
per cent said they are "fed up."
Of those who reported having "a few gripes" or
being "fed up," 43 per cent complained of the
inadequacy of courses and instructors, 21 per cent
said that their subsistence pay has been delayed or
is too low or complained of a general lack of finances.
10 per cent reported that classes are too large. 7
per cent cited bad food and poor facilities, 8 per
cent contended that tuition and living costs are too
high, while 5 per cent complained of poor housing
facilities.
