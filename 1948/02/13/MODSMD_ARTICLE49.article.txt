TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 13 (UP)-Allied war
crimes prosecutors charged today that Japan's "sneak
attack" on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the climax of
a 10-vear-old plot dating from the time of the Japan
ese conquest of Manchuria.
Former Premier Hideki Tojo and his 24 war
lord co-defendants, on trial before the International
Military Tribunal, have contended there never ex
isted any common plot aimed against the Western
democracies and that the Pacific war was hastily
planned.
Prosecutor Sol S. Horowitz of Pittsburgh, Pa.,
said such contentions were "hopelessly incredible.
Horowitz said such a defense was incredible
"in view of the nature and scope of operations in
the South undertaken on and after Dec. 8. 1941 —and
the amazingly successful results thereof."
The prosecution presented a 150-page chapter of
its summation intended to prove that Japanese war
preparations —coordinating steady increases in thi
armed forces with psychological conditioning of
industry and the Japanese people—continued with
out break from the time of the 1931 Manehurian
"incident."
