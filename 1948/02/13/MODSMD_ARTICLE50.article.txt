## HISTORY 1948 
### 
We Americans might just as well get ready to
pay the major part of occupation costs in the merged
British-American zones of Germany.
The recent agreement to divide these costs equalh
between Great Britain and the United States was
actually doomed from the very beginning. Now.
as the economic pincers tighten about the island>
of Great Britain, England will find herself unable
to pay out four hundred million dollars a year for
this purpose.
Thus, in accordance with the national crisis which
Great Britain has faced and is still facing, the two
nation financial conference which met last Octobe:
in Washington assigned a much larger share to
the United States and reduced Great Britain's pro
portion accordingly.
However, this is not altogether bad news for us.
If the United States is going to foot the bill, it
will also assume definitely the role of "the senior
partner."
As the ancient saying goes, "If we pay the piper
we can also call the tune." Plenty of ground lias
been lost in Germany recovery by the division of
authority between Great Britain and the United
States in Western Germany. This should and must
be avoided in the future by the exercise of decisive
American leadership.
If there exists any hope of ever placing Germany,
econmically back upon her own feet, there must
be some semblance of unity and integration exist
ing right now among the occupying nations. If the
Americans can show the other occupying powers
in Germany what can be accomplished by decisive
leadership, it could possibly lead the other nations
in Germany in integrating their zones into one
major zone of occupation.
It has been said, concerning the carving up of
Germany among the three major powers, that the
Russians got the farm lands, Britain received the
Ruhr, and the United States got the scenery. Under
the new alignment, American ingenuity can be
used to revive the Ruhr and, with that revival, we
can look to a self-supporting Germany.
