CHICAGO. Feb. 15 (UP)â€”Tem
peratures rose across the nation to
day, bringing relief from a long
siege of icy weather, and floods that
forced thousands of persons from
their homes in six states began to
ease in many areas.
A cold wave which swept down
across the North Central States last
night, moved so fast across the na
tion that it was hardly noticeable.
Temperatures generally dropped
about 10 degrees but they rose
quickly as the cold air raced east

The death toll since Wednesday
from tornadoes, floods, blizzards and
major fires rose to G4 today.

000 persons had been forced from
their homes by flood waters in Ohio,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ken

Many towns were isolated, water
systems endanegred and power sup
