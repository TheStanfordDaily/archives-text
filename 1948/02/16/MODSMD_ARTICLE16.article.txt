the-counter prices for many food
items have dropped substantially in
the past 30 days and housewives
will find further reductions in some
groceries tomorrow, u survey indi
cated today.
Retail prices have raced ahead of
tumbling commodity market prices
in many cases, in anticipation of
lower wholesale prices. A United
Press survey of 16 cities showed
that since the mid-January highs,
prices have dropped on meats, flour,
butter, and many other staples of
the American diet. The price cuts
on certain items varied widely by
geographical location.
In New York City, the nation's
largest consuming center, meat
packers were reported selling good
grade beef for an average of about
3 cents less per pound than they
paid for it "on the hoof" in Chicago,
the largest meat-producing center.
But the packers still made money.
The American Meat Institute,
spokesman for the packing industry,
said an analysis of Department of
Agriculture figures showed good
live steers averaged about 2G cents
a pound on the hoof.
