# Togo Accused Of Conspiracy

### 
TOKYO. Feb. 16 (UP). â€”Allied
prosecutors charged today that
Wartime Foreign Minister Shigenori
Togo and liis Foreign Office deliber
ately conspired to delay the 11th
hour exchange of notes between the
United States and Japan until the
Pearl Harbor sneak attack began.
The documents included Presi
dent Roosevelt's last-minute "triple
priority" peace appeal to Emperor
i-lirohito and the final Japanese "ul
timatum" delivered to Secretary of
State Cordell Hull in Washington
more than an hour after the Pearl
Harbor attack actually began.
The prosecution in its lengthy war
crimes trials summation charged
that the task of selecting the time
for warning the United States of
the planned aggression had been
delegated to Togo, the late Adm.
Osami Nagano, and the late Field
Marshal Gen. Sugiyama.
It told the International Military
Tribunal for the Far East that ac
tually Japanese authorities never
bothered to prepare a proper ulti
matum. The Nov. 26, 1941, note to
Hull, which the Japanese labeled a
proper ultimatum, could not be
construed as such, it said.
Hie circumstances of the "mis
hap"' in the Japanese embassy in
Washington, which the Japanese
defendants claimed was responsible
for the late delivery of the message,
were described as "extremely hard
1o understand."
