# Government 'Cannot Permit' Labor, Management Disputes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (UP).—
A top federal labor official said to
day the government "cannot and
will not permit" big strikes in the
coal, oil, atomic energy, railroad, or
shipping industries this year.
This official, who did not wish to
be quoted by name, said the ad
ministration would use the national
emergency section of the Taft-Hart
ley Labor-Management Act to halt
strikes in essential industries.
If that fails, "there is a good
chance new legislation will be
forthcoming," he said. "I'm not just
talking about legislation to curb la
bor. Industry is often at fault in a
dispute."
He said President. Truman and
Congress would be reluctant to back
new legislation in an election year,
but lie added that:
"Labor and management cannot
be allowed to endanger the Marshall
European Recovery Plan with work
stoppages. They have got to settle
their differences without strikes."
This new policy first emerged last
week when Cyrus S Ching director

of the Federal Mediation Service, j
told the Southern Coal Producers' |
Association the government would j
not tolerate a soft coal strike this |
spring.
