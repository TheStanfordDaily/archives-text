# Rare Issue Faces Democratic Party
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (UP).â€”
A "moderate" Southern Democratic
Senator said today that the real
showdown on the racial issue within
the Democratic party will take place
at the national convention in Phila
delphia next July.
This Senator, who asked that he
not be quoted by name, asserted
that if no satisfactory "deal" is made
at the convention, the threat of a
Southern bolt from the national
party may become a reality.
The views of the Senator are re
garded as significant gecause he has
been predicting publicly that the
party breach will be healed.
TK''MAN'S TACK
He said that as far-as the South
erners are concerned, the important
thing between now and the conven
tion is for President Truman to soft
pedal the civil rights issue. This, it
was reported, will be the chief ex
ecutive's tack in his Jefferson-Jack
son Day speech Thursday ni.nht.
