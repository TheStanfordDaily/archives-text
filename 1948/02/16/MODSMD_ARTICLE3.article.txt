# Ike' Tells Nation to Prepare Now in Farewell Statement
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15 (UP).—
In his farewell report as the nation's
top soldier, Gen. Dwight D. Eisen
hower warned today that America
is not adequately prepared to de
fend itself now, when there is "no
real assurance of peace."
He did not name Russia as a po
tential aggressor. but he said that
if a "despotic colossus" is allowed
to gain control of western Europe
and the Mediterranean, "war . . .
would be close to us."
On the brighter side, the retired
chief of staff cautioned against de
spair and panic. He said the United
States would greatly reduce the
danger of war by looking to its own
preparedness at home and by aiding
democratic nations abroad.
To attain "absolute security" of a
warless world, he called for more
concentrated study of the causes of
war, and for unfailing support of
the United Nations.
ATOM WARFARE
The general gave much space to
atomic warfare, stating that "a se
ries of lightning' blows might con

ceivably end a future war at its |
outset."
His report was made public by i
Secretary of Army Kenneth C. !
Royall. The five-star general who
led Allied armies to victory in Eu- |
rope retired Feb. 7 to become pres- j
ident of Columbia University. He !
was succeeded as chief of staff by j
Gen. Omar N. Bradley.
In his soberly worded. 27 - page !
report. Eisenhower strongly en
dorsed the European Recovey Pro- j
gram (Marshall Plan); urged Amer
icans to have faith in the United j
Nations, even when it seems to fal- I

ter; repeated his plea for passage
this year ot' universal military
training, and called for more team
work between the recently "unified" ;
armed forces.
ARMY WEAK
He said bluntly that the Army,
with roughly 10 infantry divisions j
spread all over the world for occu- \
pation duty, is too weak to do much
fighting.
"Our present security measures |
are inadequate, and unless remedial !
steps are taken the Army . . . may, j
in crisis, prove too weak for its
defense mission," he said.
"Military weakness on our part '
cannot be hidden."
And he added that would-be ag
gressors do not balk at war —they
merely fear defeat.
"Our task is to convince any pos
sible aggressor that he can choose j
war only at the risk of his own de
struction."
GIVES ADVICE
He advised Americans, however,
to beware of "scaremongers" who
picture the nation as helpless, or \
war as imminent.
"In the world situation, there are |
weighty credits for continued peace; |
if the United States fosters and pro- ,
motes them, by so much is the sta
bility of peace enhanced," he said.
