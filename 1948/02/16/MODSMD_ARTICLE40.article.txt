## 
### 
Reprinted below is a letter sent last week to !)00 colleges and universi
ties. The students of a small Missouri college had certain convictions
about the Marshall Plan. By the means provided to them by democratic
government they are letting their views be known to Congress.
The members of Excom, and the editors of the Daily, to whom the
letter was addressed, feel it is worth reprinting.

To the Student Body of Stanford University:
During the past few weeks the members of the student body of
William Jewell College have been participating in open discussions
relating to the salient features of the European Recovery Program,
popularly known as the Marshall Plan. These discussions culminated
in an all-school convocation, January 27, 1948, devoted exclusively
to the Marshall Plan.
By a vote of 777 to 49, the student body authorized the drafting and
the sending of a letter to each of the 531 members of Congress. This
letter urged that Congress implement the European Recovery Program
with adequate funds and create an agency headed by one administrator
responsible to the President of the United States.
The student body also authorized its officers to send a letter to
the student bodies of the 900 colleges and universities of America,
with the suggestion that something be done' on each of the campuses
about the European Recovery Program.
The youth of America have not as yet spoken about the Marshall
Plan. We are only suggesting that through your leadership the
students of your campus have the opportunity to express themselves.
If we are penny wise and pound foolish, the European Recovery
Program will in effect become piecemeal aid and relief instead of
recovery. May we also suggest that it is expedient that you act
at once.
Respectfully yours,
THE STUDENT BODY OF WILLIAM JEWELL COLLEGE,
Rex Brown and Rex Schaeffer. Co-chairmen.
