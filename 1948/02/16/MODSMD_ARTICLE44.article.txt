# Sled Cross Asks For Volunteers
## 
### 
Red Cross knitting yarn, as well
as directions for knitting simple
patterned children's sweaters, is
now available to volunteer knitters,
a local Red Cross chapter official
announced.
The sweaters are to be sent to
destitute European children. Vol
unteers are asked to call at the
production room in the new Red
Cross house in Palo Alto, which is
located between the railway sta
tion and El Camino Real.
Volunteer knitters for sweaters,
socks, and afghans of knitted
squares are also urgently needed.
These are for hospitalized Army and
Navy veterans. Knitters supply
their own yarn for the afghans,
bright colored if possible.
