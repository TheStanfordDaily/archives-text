# Cards Split Cage Games; Hopes Thin for PCC Title
## 
### 
Stanford s cagers lost all but a bare mathematical chance for
the southern division championship as they dropped their fifth
conference game to Southern California, 48 to 44, Saturday
night at the Pavilion.
The night before the Indians had beaten UCLA, 64 to 47, for

their first conference victory. Mean
while at Berkeley California took a
one-point decision from the Trojans
Friday night and clobbered UCLA
Saturday, to run its conference lead
to three full games.
Stanford, at full strength for the
first time in weeks, rose to the
heights against UCLA, then fell
down miserably against Sam Bar
ry s Trojans. Everything went right
Friday night; everything went
wi'ong Saturday night.
Every man on the starting Stan
ford five scored before UCLA got
its first score, and the 11-point lead
forged in the first four minutes of
the game was never seriously
threatened.
INDIANS SHARP
Ail the Indians had their shooting
eyes, hitting close to 50 per cent of
their shots. Dave Davidson led the
scorers with 14 points, Morley
Thompson had 12, Babe Higgins 11.
and Steve Stephenson and George
Yardley 9 each.
The Bruins' great Dave Minor and
John Stanich were held to four field
goals between them. The southern
ers' fast break didn't bother the
Indians at all. Everett Dean's five
stuck to its methodical, play-mak
ing game with great success.
HANNUiU BOTTLES IT STEVE
Against USC the Cards looked
slow, logy, even sloppy on occasion.
Steve Stephenson was bottled up by
the Trojans' G-toot fi-inch center,
Alex Hannum; and Hannum, Fred
Bertram, and Earl Wallis were con
trolling the defensive backboard all
too effectively.
Even so, the Indians managed to
stick close to the slow, "pass-'em
crazy" Trojans throughout the
game.
With six minutes of the second
half gone, SC leading 27 to 23, Dean
put four of his speedburners onto
the floor. Within a little more than
a minute, Milt Iverson, Gus Cha
valas, and Bill Drehobl tossed in
field goals to put Stanford ahead.
SPEEDSTERS SHINE
It looked as if the scrappy speed
sters might succeed where the reg
ulars had failed. For seven minutes
Iverson. Drehobl. Chavalas, and
Penn matched basket lor basket
with the Trojans.
Then Hannum scored on a tip-in.
and with four minutes to play. Bill
Sharman caged one from the side,
and Hanum. l'ouled by Ralph Car
ver on the same play, made his tree
throw. Southern Cal led 45 to 3!).
and the issue was pretty well set
tled.

HANNUiU BOTTLES IT STEVE
Against USC the Cards looked
slow, logy, even sloppy on occasion.
Steve Stephenson was bottled up by
the Trojans' G-toot fi-inch center,
Alex Hannum; and Hannum, Fred
Bertram, and Earl Wallis were con
trolling the defensive backboard all
too effectively.
Even so, the Indians managed to
stick close to the slow, "pass-'em
crazy" Trojans throughout the
game.
With six minutes of the second
half gone, SC leading 27 to 23, Dean
put four of his speedburners onto
the floor. Within a little more than
a minute, Milt Iverson, Gus Cha
valas, and Bill Drehobl tossed in
field goals to put Stanford ahead.
SPEEDSTERS SHINE
It looked as if the scrappy speed
sters might succeed where the reg
ulars had failed. For seven minutes
Iverson. Drehobl. Chavalas, and
Penn matched basket lor basket
with the Trojans.
Then Hannum scored on a tip-in.

Sharman caged one from the side,

Stanford s cagers lost all but a bare mathematical chance for
the southern division championship as they dropped their fifth
conference game to Southern California, 48 to 44, Saturday
night at the Pavilion.
The night before the Indians had beaten UCLA, 64 to 47, for

their first conference victory. Mean
while at Berkeley California took a
one-point decision from the Trojans
Friday night and clobbered UCLA
Saturday, to run its conference lead
to three full games.
Stanford, at full strength for the
first time in weeks, rose to the
heights against UCLA, then fell
down miserably against Sam Bar
ry s Trojans. Everything went right
Friday night; everything went
wi'ong Saturday night.
Every man on the starting Stan
ford five scored before UCLA got
its first score, and the 11-point lead
forged in the first four minutes of
the game was never seriously
threatened.
INDIANS SHARP
Ail the Indians had their shooting
eyes, hitting close to 50 per cent of
their shots. Dave Davidson led the
scorers with 14 points, Morley
Thompson had 12, Babe Higgins 11.
and Steve Stephenson and George
Yardley 9 each.
The Bruins' great Dave Minor and
John Stanich were held to four field
goals between them. The southern
ers' fast break didn't bother the
Indians at all. Everett Dean's five
stuck to its methodical, play-mak
ing game with great success.

Stanford s cagers lost all but a bare mathematical chance for
the southern division championship as they dropped their fifth
conference game to Southern California, 48 to 44, Saturday
night at the Pavilion.
The night before the Indians had beaten UCLA, 64 to 47, for

their first conference victory. Mean
while at Berkeley California took a
one-point decision from the Trojans
Friday night and clobbered UCLA
Saturday, to run its conference lead
to three full games.
Stanford, at full strength for the
first time in weeks, rose to the
heights against UCLA, then fell
down miserably against Sam Bar
ry s Trojans. Everything went right
Friday night; everything went
wi'ong Saturday night.
Every man on the starting Stan
ford five scored before UCLA got
its first score, and the 11-point lead
forged in the first four minutes of
the game was never seriously
threatened.
INDIANS SHARP
Ail the Indians had their shooting
eyes, hitting close to 50 per cent of
their shots. Dave Davidson led the
scorers with 14 points, Morley
Thompson had 12, Babe Higgins 11.
and Steve Stephenson and George
Yardley 9 each.
The Bruins' great Dave Minor and
John Stanich were held to four field
goals between them. The southern
ers' fast break didn't bother the
Indians at all. Everett Dean's five
stuck to its methodical, play-mak
ing game with great success.
HANNUiU BOTTLES IT STEVE
Against USC the Cards looked
slow, logy, even sloppy on occasion.
Steve Stephenson was bottled up by
the Trojans' G-toot fi-inch center,
Alex Hannum; and Hannum, Fred
Bertram, and Earl Wallis were con
trolling the defensive backboard all
too effectively.
Even so, the Indians managed to
stick close to the slow, "pass-'em
crazy" Trojans throughout the
game.
With six minutes of the second
half gone, SC leading 27 to 23, Dean
put four of his speedburners onto
the floor. Within a little more than
a minute, Milt Iverson, Gus Cha
valas, and Bill Drehobl tossed in
field goals to put Stanford ahead.
SPEEDSTERS SHINE
It looked as if the scrappy speed
sters might succeed where the reg
ulars had failed. For seven minutes
Iverson. Drehobl. Chavalas, and
Penn matched basket lor basket
with the Trojans.
Then Hannum scored on a tip-in.
and with four minutes to play. Bill
Sharman caged one from the side,
and Hanum. l'ouled by Ralph Car
ver on the same play, made his tree
throw. Southern Cal led 45 to 3!).
and the issue was pretty well set
tled.
