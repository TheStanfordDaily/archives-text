# Frosh Five Wins, Loses
## 
### 
One victory and one defeat were
the results of the efforts of the Stan
ford freshman basketball team over
the weekend. The yearlings tram
pled a game Palo .Alto High School
team, 48 to 20, on Friday and went
down to a 43 to 32 loss at the hands
of San Francisco City College in the
Saturday night encounter.
On Friday the frosh started the
game slowly and the score was tied
at nine apiece with six minutes re
maining in the first half. It looked
then as if the Falo Alto team might
stay with the frosh. But Paul Wat
son went on a three-basket scoring
spree to put Stanford out in front,
15 to 11, and Ken Gardner dropped
in a last-minute bucket, giving the
Cards a 17 to 11 lead at half time.
After the intermission it was all
Stanford. Marv Gelber and Dick
Clegg began to rebound effectively
and the offense started clicking.
The work of a tall lad named Bob
Payne beat the frosh on Saturday,
43 to 32. In the first half the lanky
center poured through 14 of his
squad's 20 points and went on to add
nine more to pace the two teams
with 23 tallies.
The man-to-man defense put up
by the City College team held the
usually high-scoring Paul Watson to
two field goals for the evening,
while the Stanford defense fell apart
in the closing stages of the contest
when forward Jack Marcus of the
Rams put in five points to sew up
the game.
