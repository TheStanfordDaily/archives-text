# Fencers Win; No Soccer

Showing a sharp reversal of form,
the Stanford swordsmen out-dueled
the visiting San Francisco State
Teachers' College team by a 17 to
8 margin in a three hour marathon
match held in the Encina Gym.
Coach Elwyn Bugge was particu
larly pleased at the showing made
by his inexperienced foil five. Rich
ard Finch, David Evenson, and Phil
Mitchell of Stanford had four won
and one lost records, while Mike
Palmquist and Richard Jones aided
the cause with three and two and
two and three, respectively.

Stanford's soccer scjuad was de
prived of its proixised game with th *
Verdi Athletic club, when the garni
was called off because of a
in scheduling. The Farm booter>
were particularly hopeful of using
this game as a warm-up for next
Saturday's contest with the Mexic >
AC, which has already trounced the
locals swice.
So far in the soccer season the
Mexico men hold 8 to 2 and 1 to €■
wins over the Cardinal kickers, an J.
Coach Dave Tappan's boys are ar -
xious to avenge the losses.
