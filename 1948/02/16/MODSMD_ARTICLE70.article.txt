## Why Give? 
### 
"It's Red Cross Time. Give!" Why?
This editorial is not a pep talk or a catalogue of reasons why
you and your friends should give a few cents to the Red Cross
this year. We're not going to tell you about all the humanitarian
services the Red Cross provides, how it operates during dis
asters, or how it quietly furnishes community aid day after day,
year after year. The Red Cross itself does a good job in publi
cising itself.
There are many things wrong with the Red Cross. Veterans
particularly remember cases of mismanagement and dispro
portionate publicity overseas. Such things cause bitterness
and resentment.
' But one big question stands out through all the unfortunate
and undesirable aspects of the organization. Who would do a
better job, or who would even attempt to start the job the
Red Cross does if that group did not exist?
Granted the Red Cross is not perfect. But what person or
what group of persons is?
When we're asked "Why give to the Red Cross?" our answer
is that the Red Cross makes the world a better place. Anybody
who can do that deserves the money.
