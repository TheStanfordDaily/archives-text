## Intelligent Voting? 
### 
To the Editor:
I exercised my franchise and voted last Wednesday.. Why? I didn't
know any of the candidates and recognized few of the names. How many
more students did not vote because they felt that they did not know the
candidates?
In the spirit of representative government I voted, and in so doing a
suggestion came to mind which if adopted, would serve as a partial guide
to those students who are not well-acquainted with those who run of offee.
This is not my idea, but one which is employed by the State oi
Oregon wherein each candidate is allowed to briefly describe himself
or his ideas. With a little re-arrangement the same size ballot could be
used, and a ten-word statement such as: "Strong SIRO supporters; believe
in greater emphasis on minor sports." would be very helpful in selecting
the most desirable candidate from the voters' point of view.
The Daily could print similar information. Without some such guide
can several thousand students be blamed for not expressing convictions
on the selection of their officers?
My voting did not represent intelligent selection of the candidate?,
but it did result in the idea which I have conveyed to you.
