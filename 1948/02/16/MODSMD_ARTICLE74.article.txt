The general belief that war experiences have al
tered the vocational plans and ambitions of the great
majority of American veterans is discounted by the
nationwide survey on veterans' education made by
the American Council on Education with the financial
backing of Disabled American Veterans.
Results of the study indicate that more than
half (51 per cent) of the veterans now enrolled in
the nation's colleges and universities are preparing
for the same vocations they planned to enter be
fore they went into the armed services.
Only 35 per cent, the survey shows, have changed
their vocational plans made before entering military
service, while 11 per cent had not chosen vocations
prior to donning uniforms.
The greatest change in vocational aims was found
among the disabled veteran students, with 4<> of the
married students in this group and 43 per cent of
the single students enrolled in programs leading to
occupational goals different from those they had
prior to the war.
Principal reason advanced for changing vocational
choice was "change of interest." Of the 35 per cent
who have changed their plans one fourth gave this
reason. Other explanations advanced for change of
vocational plans included "more opportunity in
second choice." 17 per cent of this group: "more ap
titude for second choice." 13 per cent; "is better
paying," 4 per cent; and "too long to prepare for
first choice," 4 per cent.
One tenth of the student veterans who changed
their plans, stated that they had tried the vocation
of their original choice, didn't like it and had
switched to another. Only 1 per cent of those who
changed said they found preparing, for the first
choice "too tough."
Once having embarked upon training for a voca
tion under the G.I. Bill of Rights or the Rehabilitation
program, most student veterans have remained "on
course." The study shows that 86 per cent have
made no change in vocational plans since starting
training under government benefits. Some 12 per
cent reported having switched vocational plans
once since starting training, while only between 1
and 2 per cent said they had changed vocations
two or more times.
Most student veterans feel that the majority of
courses they are now taking are directly related to
ihe vocations for which they are preparing. Accord
ing to the survey, only 20 per cent do not consider
their present college courses directly related to
their chosen vocations.
All but a few veterans in college are satisfied
with the progress they are making toward their
chosen vocations, the study indicates, with 72 per
cent considering their progress as average, 21 per
cent as excellent and only 5 per cent as unsatisfac
tory. Two per cent said they riidn'i, know whether
or not their progress is satisfactory.
HONOLULU (UP) —Leonard D. Mason, an ex
pert on Micronesia, has warned the U. S. Navy to
go slow in trying to bring the natives of the former
Japanese mandated islands around to the American
way of life.
Mason is Associate Professor of anthropology at
the University of Hawaii. He is the scientist chosen
by the Navy to tell it what to do about the IGS na
tives transferred from Bikini, site of the 1046 atomic
bomb tests, to barren Rongerik atoll.
In a paper writ'en for the Institute of Pacific

Relations. Mason asked: How can such standards
as the American way of life demands be achieved
in an area as poor as Micronesia?
He said a congressional subcommittee revealed
two common blind spots in recommending recently
that "the natives of these islands should be indoc
trinated to the American way of life as soon as pos
sible without infringing upon their customs and
institutions."
The first of the blind spots, he said, was insuf
ficient understanding of the complexities of cultures
and geography of the islands making up the trust
territory of the Pacific.
The second, he said, is "imperfect understanding
of the processes by which customs are altered under
the impact of western civilization."
He pointed out that the trust territory is com
posed of the Marshalls, the Carolinas and the Mari
anas, other than Guam. There are 2,174 islands
scattered over 2,000,000 square miles of Pacific ocean
Some, like Saipan, Ponape and Jaluit. have beer,
in close contact for years with Japanese or Ameri
cans and have grown away from traditional custom*.
WASHINGTON. D.C., Feb. 15—The proposal to
send an "American Expeditionary Force" of cats to
Europe poses more problems than meet the eye.
The Old World certainly could use more cats. It
has the ' Help Wanted" sign out for a million oi
them to help combat the rats and mice which are
devouring sorely needed food.
But the big catch, notes the National Geographic
Society, is that a feline "A.E.F." would impose a
fresh drain on Europe's available food supplies.
Contrary to widespread belief, cats don't kill rod
ents for their daily rations. And there is no way to
send cats after rats or mice when they are not in
the mood.
PURELY FOR SORT
Cats go after rodents, purely for the sport of it.
The" approach has a lot in common with that of the
big game hunter. The cats proceed in their own indi
vidualistic way and in their own good time. It is
quite untrue that hungry cats are good mousers.
The best are the well-fed cats, but well-fod on .
far more appealing diet than rodents would provide
Because of their independent nature, it would be
impossible to keep an "AEF" of cats at "work'
even on a 40-hour week. There are "work horses,
"work mules" and even "working dogs." But .
"work cat" is a contradiction. They are creature.-
that refuse to be regimented.
BI T THEY GET PAID FOR IT
Nevertheless they have long figured on govern
ment payrolls. All U.S. post offices in large citie
employ cats. They have worked for the British gov
ernment in olices. dockyards, and barracks at
shilling a week. The salary is for their meals. The
French government maintained a large staff of
to protect paper stock in its printing office. Cats
were employed by the city of Vienna. And eight ot
them have appeared on the list of employees of an
English railway.
Provided the food problems can be overcome, c
force of sturdy American cats could do much towarc
building up the depleted cat population of Europe
The majority of cats are self-sufficient and well abl
to cope with almost any situation.
