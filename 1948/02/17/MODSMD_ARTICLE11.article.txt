# Drive To Open Today For Off-Campus Groups
## Theta Chi House Goes 100 Per Cent On First Day of Red Cross Drive 
### 
Stanford's American Red Cross drive for 1948, with a quota set
at $5,000, will open to off-campus students today. Contributions
wil lbe accepted at a booth in front of the Cellar today through
Thursday.
Red Cross donations by living groups began last night at

house meetings and will continue
through Friday. These donations
are being collected by house repre
sentatives.
Theta Chi has gone 100 per cent
in the drive. Representative for the
house is Jack Tobin.
Diana Powers, Cardinals-appoint
ed head of the campus drive, em
phasized that although a dollar con
tribution entitles the giver to mem
bership in the Red Cross, students
should give all they can.
"The Red Cross drive is not s
part of the Four Feathers drive.'
stated Miss Powers. '"The Red Cross
has specific obligations imposed up
on it by congressional charter. The
governing body of the Red Cross
has repeatedly studied the question
of participation in joint campaigns
and has concluded that only by di
rect appeal in its own name to the
American people can the Red Cross
successfully finance its charter ob
ligations and at the same time main
tain the necessary freedom of action
required in time of national emer
gencies."
DISASTER REI.IEF
''Everything the Red Cross doe.;
depends on what you give," contin
ued Miss Powers. "You, the people,
are the Red Cross."
One of the outstanding services of
the Red Cross is disaster relief. li
the event of hurricanes, floods, ex
plosions, earthquakes, firfes, and like
disasters, the Red Cross provides
nurses, doctors, and other workers,
transportation, canteens and medic
al supplies.
After the emerg en cy, the Red
Cross assists victims on the basis of
need for rehabilitation by repairing,
rebuilding, and refurnishing homes;
providing long term medical and
nursing care and re-establishing
small private businesses.
TEXAS CITY EXPLOSION
After the Texas City explosion
and fire in 1947, Governor Beauford
H. Jester of Texas stated:
"Thousands of acts of mercy on
the part of the Red Cross workers
will never be recorded, but the mag
nificent job turned by the Red
Cross in the Texas City disaster is
already a matter of recordâ€”clear
and undisputed."
