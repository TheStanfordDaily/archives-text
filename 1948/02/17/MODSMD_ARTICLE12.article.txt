# ATOMIC CONTROL
## WCC Broadcasts On KSU Tonight 
### 
The third in a series of broadcasts
concerning the resolutions of the
Western College Congress will be
held over KSU at 8 tonight.
With B. J. Denning as moderator,
a group of students will discuss Ar
ticle 4, concerning atomic energy
and its control.
These broadcasts are designed to
increase the students' knowledge on

these resolutions.
