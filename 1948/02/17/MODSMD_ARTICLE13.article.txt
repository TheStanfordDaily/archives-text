# Meatless Tuesday Still Farm's Menu
## 
### 
Meatless Tuesdays are still being
observed at Stanford in conjunction
with the nation's food conservation
program, Gene Mitguard, student
manager, announced.
President Truman inaugurated
the program about five months ago
when he asked people to conserve
food to enable the United States to
meet its European food commit
ments.
This information is being re-an
nounced. Mitguard said, in answer
to queries as to why University res
idences are not being served meat
on Tuesdays.
