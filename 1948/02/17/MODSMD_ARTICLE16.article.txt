# RENT CEILINGS
## Blanket Hikes Out; Controls Loosened 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1(5 (UP)
The Senate banking committee to
day approved a 14-month vent con
trol extension bill after knocking out
provisions which would have grant
ed landlords a virtual blanket 15
per cent increase and decontrolled
many large cities.
The committee's unanimous vote
came after the House banking com
mittee approved a 30-day extension
of the existing law and the supreme

! court ruled uanimously that rent
controls are constitutional.
The Senate group also knocked
out of its subcommittee bill a clause
permitting "sky's the limit" rent
increases in leases extending through
; 1949. Instead, it voted to continue
the existing prevision permitting 15
' per cent "voluntary" increases, pro
' vided the new leases run through
Dec. 31, 1949.
