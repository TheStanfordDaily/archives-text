WASHINGTON. Feb. 16 (UP) â€”
Passing over the holly disputed i
question of whether segregated \
schools give Negroes equal oppor- !
tunity, the supreme court today re- I
fused to order the state of Oklaho- i
ma to admit Mrs. Ada Lois Sipuel j
Fisher, 23-year-old Negro, to its all- j
white University Law School.
The justices divided 7 to 2 in the !
Fisher case, which was before the 1

court for the second time. The court
had ruled on Jan. 12 that Oklahoma
was bound by the U. S. Constitu
tion to make a legal education as
readily available to Mrs. Fisher as
to any white student.
The state courts followed up that
mandate by ordering the university
either to admit Mrs. Fisher to the
white law*school, or to establish a
separate law school for Negroes. The
state chose the latter course, and on
Jan. 26 set up a three-professor law
school for Negroes.
