i The two-year contract may be

reached on wages the old rate will
continue in effect for another year.
Murray said that a "wage report"
will be released alter the meeting of
[ the union's wage and policy corn
-1 mittee on Wednesday, and he re
j fused to say whether the USW

j for you."
Bridges is believed to be on his
I way out because of his support of
! left-wing policies in opposition to
the majority of the CIO executive
! board.
