# Truman Lays Near East Relief Failure to Reds

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UP) —President Truman told Congress
today that communist pressure has thwarted the 3300,000,000
Greek aid program enacted last May and that Greece will need
further American military help to regain her political and eco
nomic stability. The president said Turkey also will need addi-

tional military assistance, although
the $100,000,000 aid plan now in op
eration there is going ahead more
satisfactorily than that in Greece.
Formal money requests for the
two new projects will be presented
to Congress "at the appropriate
time," Mr. Truman said.
He did not indicate how much lie
would ask but informed sources said
it probably would be about $200.-
000,000 altogether — all in strictly
military aid.
In his second quarterly report on
the progress of the Greek-Turkish
programs initiated last spring, Mr.
Truman conceded frankly that little
or no real progress has been made
toward getting the shaky Greek gov
ernment back on a solid looting, ei
ther militarily or economically.
He blamed that failure entirely
on "foreign aided" communist guer
x ilia forces which have terrorized
northern Greece and kept the coun-
J try in a state of chaos.
The communist bands must be
] suppressed, he said, before any sub-
J stantial progress can be hoped for
j on the economic front.
"If the guerrilla menace should
{ increase as a result of greater out
side assistance," he said in a pointed
I reference to Russia's thinly-veiled
aid to the Greek guerrillas, "a new
situation would be created which
would have to be dealt with in the
light of circumstances prevailing at
that time."
Without referring to the Soviet
! Union by name, Mr. Truman made
jit plain that he held Russia and her
I Balkan satellites responsible for
| keeping Greece on the verge of col-
I lapse.
"Greece has been subjected to ever
increasing pressure by the commun
| ist minority which, subservient to
the foreign influences from which it
draws support, would impose its will
I on the Greek people by force of
arms," he said.

the $100,000,000 aid plan now in op
eration there is going ahead more
satisfactorily than that in Greece.
Formal money requests for the
two new projects will be presented
to Congress "at the appropriate
time," Mr. Truman said.
He did not indicate how much lie
would ask but informed sources said
it probably would be about $200.-
000,000 altogether — all in strictly
military aid.
In his second quarterly report on
the progress of the Greek-Turkish
programs initiated last spring, Mr.
Truman conceded frankly that little
or no real progress has been made
toward getting the shaky Greek gov
ernment back on a solid looting, ei
ther militarily or economically.
He blamed that failure entirely
on "foreign aided" communist guer
x ilia forces which have terrorized
northern Greece and kept the coun-
J try in a state of chaos.
The communist bands must be
] suppressed, he said, before any sub-
J stantial progress can be hoped for
j on the economic front.
"If the guerrilla menace should
{ increase as a result of greater out
side assistance," he said in a pointed
I reference to Russia's thinly-veiled
aid to the Greek guerrillas, "a new
situation would be created which
would have to be dealt with in the
light of circumstances prevailing at
that time."
Without referring to the Soviet
! Union by name, Mr. Truman made
jit plain that he held Russia and her
I Balkan satellites responsible for
| keeping Greece on the verge of col-
I lapse.
"Greece has been subjected to ever
increasing pressure by the commun
| ist minority which, subservient to
the foreign influences from which it
draws support, would impose its will
I on the Greek people by force of
arms," he said.
