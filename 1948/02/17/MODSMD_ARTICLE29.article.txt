LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., Feb. 16
(UP). —A spokesman for the Korean
People's Representative Assembly
appealed tonight for immediate
United Nations action to counteract
formation of the "Democratic Peo
j pie's Republic" in the northern So
| viet-ocupied zone of Korea.
The spokesman, Miss Louise Yim,
called on the Russian-boycotted UN
: Little Assembly, which takes up the
Korean problem Thursday, to order
an immediate UN-observed election
in Korea. She said that such a move
! would "give the UN-sponsored Re
j public of Korea international recog

position of the Soviet puppet re
gime, in the eyes of the world, will
be impossible."

SEOUL, Korea. Feb. 16 (UP).—A
"Democratic People's Republic of
Korea," backed by a Soviet-equip
ped army, was proclaimed by ra
dio today in the Russian-occupied
northern zone of this country.
North Korea authorities, pro
claiming the Soviet-style "repub
lic," asserted that eventually it
would exert its authority over the
American-occupied southern zone.
United States Army authorities at
once denounced the action as a di
rect violation of the Moscow Con
ference decision that the United
States and Russia should work to
gether to set up a fully independent
Korean republic.
There is ample information, said
American authorities, that the "Ko
rean" army is well equipped Avith
Russian arms, ammunition, and oth
er war materials.
The Soviet - sponsored proclama
tion was broadcast from Pyong
Yang, capital of the Russian zone.
It called for a special session of a
north Korean "People's Council'' in
mid-March to "discuss and adopt"
a constitution.
The proclamation called on its
"army of all Korea" to defend the
"democratic rights" of 30,000.000
Koreans. This means the population
of the entire country.
