## 
### JOHN HALL 
Although the weekend was a flop as far as getting back into
ihe conference cage race was concerned, Everett Dean's men
did manage to score their first league win and looked impressive
:n doing so. Their luke-warm performance against USC ruined
their comeback. All hands came out of the two games in good

fehape. Dave Davidson has a bruise
over his elbow but i1 isn't serious.
Jack Scharfen is back in uniform
after sitting out the last two games
"With the flu.
CARD DEFENSE BEAT UCLA
Stanford's defense was the out
standing factor behind the UCLA
win. The shifting zone that the Cards
applied had Minor and Stanich go
ing around in circles, and very few
set shots were obtained. The Cards
were also very effective in bottling
up the Bruin fast break.
Babe Higgins looked great against
the Bruins. Higgins had the tough
job of bringing the ball down under
the Bruin press. He handled the ball
on every play and played all but one
minute of the entire game. If Babe
continues playing this caliber of ball
he should cinch a berth on the all
conference team for his third time.
USED SPEED AGAINST USC
Against USC it was a different
story. The shots weren't going in,
and the Trojans were quick to grab
all the loose balls. Alex Hannum,
Fred Bertram, and Earl Wallis were
all over the backboards. .
Everett Dean had to call on his
fast men to get Stanford back in
the ball game, and almost everyone
was amazed at the speed displayed
bv Chavalas, Iverson, Drehobl, Penn
And Bryan. Inside a minute these

five men overcame a five-point de
ficiency as they rattled USC with a
wild and wooly pressing defense.
Coach Dean said it was a tough
ball game to lose. Otherwise, there
wasn't much that could be said.


GUS CIIAVALAS, who tanked
three quick buckets against the
Trojans last Saturday night, will
probably see plenty of action next
weekend when the Indians take
on UCLA and USC down south.
