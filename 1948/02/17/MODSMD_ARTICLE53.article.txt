i all the way, Stanford's grapplers
I tangle with a strong San Jose squad
J tonight at 7 in the Spartan gym.
Early in the campaign Coach
i Chuck Taylor's boys took a '21 to 10
beating from the San Jose matmen,
but the loss of two split decisions,
plus the forfeiture of ace man Vern
Jones' bout because of an injury,
spelled the 11-point difference.
JONES CONSISTENT WINNER
Vern Jones, who acts as assistant
J coach for the team, has been the
j squad's most consistent winner so
| far, losing only because of the in
( jury ruling in the first San Jose
| bout. A boy who has shown great
| improvement lately in winning his
j last two bouts is Roy Gaskin, who,
j along with Gill Sanderson, should
prove more than a match for their
