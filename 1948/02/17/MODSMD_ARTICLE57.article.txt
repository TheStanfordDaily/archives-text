# Merriman To Start Training With Cincy
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Lloyd Merriman, ace Farm footballer and baseball star, leaves
1" riday for his home in Clovis, California, and from there he will
depart for spring training with the Cincinnati Reds at Tampa,
Florida.
An outfielder with the Indian nine last year, Merriman batted

over .400 in the CIBA and then
signed with the Reds after working
out with them last summer. While
playing here at Stanford, Merriman
attracted the attention of the Reds'
scouting staff and was finally inked
by talent hunter Bobby Mattick.
MARCIIIE MISSED LLOYD
Merriman had one more year of
eligibility, and his signing as a pro
left a big vacancy in Coach Marchie
Schwartz's football squad which
went unfilled all last season.
Coach Harry Wolter, Lloyd's base
ball mentor last season, also will
have a big gap in his outfield, now
that Merriman had decided to join
the ranks of the play-for-pay boys.
Concerning Merriman's chances in
pro ball, Wolter said, "He has ev
erything a prospect needsâ€”a good
| arm. he's fast, has power, and is a
good outfielder." Summing it all up
i in one sentence, he climaxed his
praises by adding, "Lloyd has a good
chance to go to the big leagues."
MAY BE FARMED OUT
In all probability Merriman will
be optioned out to one of the Reds'
I farm clubs at the end of the spring
training session. During the last lew
| years the Reds have had a policy of
I sending new players, especially col
legians, to Columbia, South Caro
lina, of the Sally League, and from
there a number of them have
jumped right to the parent club in
J Cincinnati.
In his last statement to the press,
| Merriman commented, "I'd like to
be playing here at Stanford again
this year. I think they'll be bet
ter than last year, and they're going
to have a good team. As to playing
in pro ball, I don't know. It's going
to be a new experience."


LLOYD MERRIMAN. former grid
star at Stanford, is slated to take
up his professional baseball career
with the Cincinnati Reds later this
month.
