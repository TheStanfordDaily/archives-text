### JOHN BREIER 
Read an article the other clay that
had as a lead—"How the mighty
hath fallen!" It seems that expres
sion could be borrowed and used to
describe the Stanford rooting sec
tion in the last three basketball
games.
We here at Stanford have, in the
past two years anyway, been point
ing our collective fingers at the
rowdy Cal rooting section and de
crying its boisterous conduct.
After the showings before and
during the Bradley Tech game and
t lie two contests last weekend, wo
of the Farm no longer have a right
to throw stones.
CHALLENGE DECISIONS
Throughout the Saturday game
with USC, the newly found habit of
challenging every decision against
Stanford exerted itself in the worst
of manners.
Card rooters who have prided
themselves on the tradition of good
sportsmanship at Stanford were dis
mayed at the increased amount of
booing that took place when the
Trojan players were at the foul line.
From the press box we took a quick
gander at Coaches Dean, Dana, and
Bengtson during one of these dis
olays. They were not happy.
During the Bradley game. Bill
Rose, Stanford player, raised his
land in a futile effort to quiet the
ans. That should never be neces
;arv.
REFEREES INCONSISTENT
Perhaps the one thing most re
sponsible for this new state of af
;urs is the inconsistency of the ref
reeing. j
In this age of modern basketball
ill of the fouls cannot be called.
Toaches are up in arms now, say
ng that the whistle - blowers are
lowing down the game.. The offi
•ials reply that the games should be
lowed down or the rules revamped.
In the case of our officiating in
lie Southern Division of the PCC,
he lack of consistency is evident, j
"he officials must get together on |
ailing the fouls.
It is our belief that Lloyd Leith '
* one of the best referees in the
iusiness. The same cannot be said |
112 Wally Cameron. However, when
hese two gentlemen work a ball 1
ame, they should get together on
ust how close they are going to j
all the fouls.
ALL ALL FOULS
When Steve Stephenson and the J
pposing center are rebounding
nth elbows under the basket, it
;n't fair for the fouls to be called
t one end of the floor and not at
ie other.
Look into your own mind and ask
lis question, "If I had been a USC
joter last Saturday, wouldn't I
ave had as many occasions to hoi- i
•r at the calls?"
It is not an indication of good :
:hool spirit to protest each and ev
•y decision. Rather, cheer at indi
idual play and good teamwork and
•t's have a return of "The Stanford
pirit."
NY CHALLENGERS?
The most exclusive club on cam
as seems to have as its motto,
Anything you can do I can do bet
r." It isn't easy to get into this
üb; in fact there are only two
embers. George Yardley and frosh
\sketballer Marvin Gelber.
The rugged frosh guard was first
enter this particular club when
» hit a 50-foot, one-handed shot
om the run to beat the Cal year- j
s - !
Yumping Yeorge got into the club j
hen he sank a two-handed set shot
st before the half-time buzzer in
e Bradley Tech game. His shot

i traveled from the far side of the
I mid-court line near the scorers' !
bench.
Gelber added another five feet to i
i his previous record Saturday night
when he hit from about 10 feet back
of the mid-court line from straight
out. This time -the counter came via
the set shot route, with but seven
I seconds remaining in the first half. :
