# Frosh Baseballers to Meet Commerce Nine Tomorrow
## 
### JACK BLOOD 
The first harbinger of spring—baseball—comes to the Farm this week
with the Freshman nine meeting Commerce High School of San Francisco
tomorrow and Vallejo JC Thursday. Both games start at 3:00 and will
be played on the Freshman diamond.
This is the first Freshman team to represent Stanford since 1942. From
1943 through 1945 all intercollegiate athletics were suspended by the
university. In 194G and 1947 the Freshman rule was waived by the

Pacific Coast Conference and fresh-H
men played on the varsity teams.
cards ham: young team
i This year the team is coached by
Charlie Bushong who is a senior
here, working toward his Physical
Education major. Faced with the
task of forming a team from a squad
of over 30 hopefuls, Bushong has
come up with a good hit. good field,
and no pitch team. It is essentially
a young team with only a few ser
vice veterans.
The sure fielding', peppery infield
finds Don McComber of Buena Park, j
California, holding down the initial
sack; Ken La Crosse of Grass Val
ley, California, at second; Bob Ames
from Winslow. Arizona, at short;
and Sal Colletto from Monterey at j
third.
Jim Trabucco from San Mateo,
Dick Vande from Los Anegles, and
Dick Fink of Santa Barbara are the
heavy hitting picketmen who are
expected to provide most of the
offensive punch.
BUSHONG WANTS HI'RLERS
Number one catcher is John Her
bold from Hollywood who will pro
vide the target for Bushong's hard
working pitching duo. Denny Tuff
anelli from Blue Island. Illinois, and i
southpaw Lloyd Westphal from Li
vermore. Speaking of pitchers, the
season is just beginning and Coach !
Charlie Bushong will be happy to
welcome any would-be frosh hurl- j
ers on the team.
