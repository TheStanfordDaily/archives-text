## A 						Few Early Hats 
### 
With one election just behind us, few of us have had time
or the inclination to consider the next student race slated for
spring quarter —the election that will determine most of our
ASSU and all class officers.
In yesterday's Campus Opinion, E. L. Thompson suggested
a plan for a more intelligent selection of candidates —a plan
whereby the ideas of each nominee would be incorporated on
the ballot. We hope that Election Board will give serious consid
eration to this worthwhile suggestion.
One further idea for intelligent voting:
Why not a thought or two at this early date to possible can
didates? Why not a quick look by interested groups through the
classes, particularly the forthcoming senior class, for possible
successors to the ASSU president and vice-president?
A few early hats in the ring would enable students to hear
more of each candidate's possibilities and ideas.
Would it harm the candidate's chances if he made an early
declaration? We think not. It would give him more time to meet
his electors—especially if he is an ASSU candidate and must
cover the entire campus.
It would give him time to present a constructive, well-though
out platform. He would have the opportunity to meet his opposi
tion in frequent debate which would serve not only to stimulate
campus interest but would give the nominee a chance to chal
lenge the ideas of the other candidates.
At last spring's lection it was Tom Martzloff who made the
first open statement of his candidacy, and it paid off for him.—P.N.
