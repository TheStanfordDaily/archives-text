Hooton's Monkey Business'
To the Editor:
Did you attend to Dr. Hooton's lectures? His suggestions for the
improvement of the world seem scientifically logical. But, who is going
to assume the ultimate responsibility for the application of his program
of sterilization?
If human beings cannot be trusted with the task of an intelligent
international government, can they be trusted with the control of a steril
ization program for human betterment? Dr. Hooton overlooks the fact
that when people begin to look at their neighbors as if they were guinea
pigs (or monkeys) a loss of moral sense and a devaluation of human
dignity are always accompanying phenomena. Such programs of steriliz
ation were used with great refinement by the Nazis.
In relation to his enthusiasm for artificial birth control he seems to
forget that the popular and widespread use of artificial birth control
has been a factor in the increasing rate of destruction and devaluation of
the American home—for it has induced people to think of marriage
in a lighthearted way, as if it were only an institution for pleasure and
convenience.
In my opinion Dr. Hooton is presenting a modern version of the
scientific romanticism which was so characteristic of the days of the
French Revolution. In fact we can say that the modern world is present
ing us with the final /md inevitable disappointment of the unrealistic
scientific romanticism which began in the eighteenth century. We cannot
discredit the facts upon which Dr. Hooton bases his ideas; but his selection
of facts and his interpretation of them, are not wide enough; he neglects
very important psychological, sociological, and religious facts. It all goes
to show that when a person spends too much time studying monkeys,
everything begins to appear like monkey business to him.
