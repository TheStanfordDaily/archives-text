# No Discrimination at Stanford
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Answering Jack Sutherland's "Letter to Campus Opinion," Feb. 13.
Our first impression upon reading Mr. Sutherland's letter to Campus
Opinion was one of surprise. Surprise because, though we are, according
to Mr. Sutherland, a member of a minority which is supposedly discrimin
ated against, what Mr. Sutherland says is completely new to us. We
wonder if he is really acquainted with discrimination. Before coming to
Stanford, we attended two Southern Universities where we saw discrim
ination practiced with a vengeance.
At this point, we wish to state categorically that never have we
seen an institution or group so completely free of discrimination, from a
racial or religious point-of-view, as the Stanford "Family."
To be more specific, we have yet to run across anyone at Stanford who
feels or has felt that he has been discriminated against. As far as housing
is concerned, Mr. Sutherland has very thoroughly confused the issue.
In the first place, if he had taken the troubLe to investigate, he would
have found that in University residences, the question of assignment is
generally left to chanceâ€”first come, first served, or by lot.
No, we don't think that prejudice or discrimination pose particularly
serious problems here at Stanford. We do think, however, that nothing
can stir up prejudice or racial bigotry any more quickly than hysterical
accusations made by either self-styled martyrs or, as is more likely in
this case, by a self-appointed Public Defender of human rights.
Yes, Mr. Sutherland, "The Wind of Freedom Does Blow'' ii' you will
but discard your windbreak.
JERRY H. WERLIN.
