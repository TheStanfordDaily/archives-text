General Wedemeyer laid it on the line to the Chin
ese government in his first report on his fact finding
mission. He told Nanking that the government is
shot through with incompetence, greed, and corrup
tion all the way down to the provinces and cities.
Wedemeyer also made it very clear that the people
are defeatists because they lack the kind of leader
ship they could follow. He also emphasized strongly
that the only way China can save itself is through
"drastic, far-reaching political and economic re
forms."
General Wedemeyer warned the government and
the Chinese communists alike that they cannot settle
their differences by force, and that the Chinese people
long passionately for peace.
Chiang Kai-Shek still stands on his fake constitu
tional convention, which merely perpetuated the one
party dictatorial rules of the fascist-dominated Kuo
mintang. It certainly appears that Chiang evidently
believes that the United States wants Chinese bases
so badly, and is so much afraid of letting Russia into
China, that it will put up with anything in the way
of a central government.
At any rate, since the end of the war with Japan,

Chiang has taken the gloves off and quit any pretense
that he will deal peacefully with the Chinese com
munists by bringing about the democratic reform.-
they demand. It is most evident that Chiang Kai-
Shek is engaged in a war of extermination.
Chiang should accept the advice that military
force in itself will not eliminate communism. If there
were not one single communist in China, the ver\
same evils of government would exist, and if there
were as much as one leader to rise up in protest
against them, Chiang Kai-Shek would have to deai
with him and the Chinese would surely follow him
Chiang must take this course of action just a;
he must deal eventually with Mao Tse-tung and hi;
followers. For Chiang to continue fooling himsell
and the people of China will just go to make more
bloodshed in China. The sooner that Chiang realize.-
that brute military power will not bring about tlu
desired "peace" that he '"desires to have so ver\
much" the quicker peace will come to the Chinese
people.
General Wedemeyer could have spoken no truei
or plainer words when he said, "Promises will no'
longer suffice; performance is absolutely necessary."
