## BULL SESSION 
### 
There's an item that popped up in the classified
ad section of The Daily the other day that I'd like
to comment about.
Someone in Mountain View had at the time a
Model "T" for sale. The seller says the thing is in
excellent condition, engine completely overhauled
(can you still buy parts?), new tires and brakes, and
original paint. And then he says the car has been
stored for 11 years.
That's what I want to talk about.
You can discard a model "T" for 11 years, you
can forget about it. but only Madman Muntz himself
would store a model "T" for 11 yeai's.
I'm not slurring the car. Sounds like it's a good
model "T." Anybody looking for cheap transporta
tion or something to give away as a door prize at a
dance would probably find this is just the thing.
Just find out which 11 years the car was stored
since 1927. Maybe it was every other year.
I've got a used Ford myself. Anything under 100.-
000 miles is "used." Anything over that is not "used."
it's "been had." My car is a Ford V-4. Its a V-8
when both banks of cylinders are working—which
they don't.
It's the only car on campus with three speeds
of stop.
The speedometer is missing, but I don't need it.
At 15 miles per hour the headlights rattle; at 25
miles per hour the fenders rattle—both of them;
at 35 miles per hour I rattle.
It's never traveled faster than that except the
time I coasted down Altamonte pass. I don't remem
ber what rattled that time —I blacked out half way
down the hill.
The engine has got a crack In the block, but I'm
not complaining. After all, I'm no genius myself.
Aside from that, the car is in good condition,

Maybe I should store it for 11 years on the basi:
that no used car is what it's jacked up to be.
I see by the San Jose Mercury Herald there havt
been only 11 traffic deaths so far this year in thi
county. That's one every four days in this area, aiu
not too bad an average. If that extra $10 doesn'
come through pretty soon on my GI checks, In
more likely to starve to death than get killed in
motor accident.
. They say in a big city like New York a man i
killed every half hour. I suppose somebody substi
tutes for him when he goes home to meals.
And many students are making their contribu
tions to next year's motor statistics. You can't ge
insurance in California if you are a single studen
under 25 years of age. And it's pretty hard to b
a plural student.
I'll admit though that college students do hav
a lot of accidents in cars. One of my friends ha<
an accident in a car. and finally had to marry the gir
Of course that isn't the only way you can hav
an accident in a car. You've seen these signs o:
the highway warning you against liquor:
"Alcohol and gasoline don't mix."
The sign is right—l tried to mix them once. ar.
could barely drink the stuff. The gasoline stays i:
the bottom of the glass, and it makes you burp al
night.
Besides, every time I walked up hill my live
developed carbon knock.
Well. I'm a long way from the model "T" that
started talking about.
Clark Shaughnessy and Frankie Albert brough
their "1" out of storage too. And they sold it t
an awful lot of people.
I hope the Mountain View car salesman can d
the same thing.

There's an item that popped up in the classified
ad section of The Daily the other day that I'd like
to comment about.
Someone in Mountain View had at the time a
Model "T" for sale. The seller says the thing is in
excellent condition, engine completely overhauled
(can you still buy parts?), new tires and brakes, and
original paint. And then he says the car has been
stored for 11 years.
That's what I want to talk about.
You can discard a model "T" for 11 years, you
can forget about it. but only Madman Muntz himself
would store a model "T" for 11 yeai's.
I'm not slurring the car. Sounds like it's a good
model "T." Anybody looking for cheap transporta
tion or something to give away as a door prize at a
dance would probably find this is just the thing.
Just find out which 11 years the car was stored
since 1927. Maybe it was every other year.

not complaining. After all, I'm no genius myself.
