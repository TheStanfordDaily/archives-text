## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 17 (UP)â€”Leo Isacson, candidate of the Am
erican Labor Party with the personal endorsement of Henry A.
Wallace, scored an upset victory over his democratic opponent
tonight in a special Congressional election which had been hailed
as the first ballot-box test of Wallace's third party. Final, official

returns from all 159 election districts
in Ihe 24th Congressional district ot !
the Bronx gave Isacson a total of
22,697 votes to 12.578 for Democrat
Karl Propper.
Liberal candidate Dean Alfange
polled 3,840 votes and Republican
Joseph De Negris ran last, with
1.482. Isacson's total vote was con
siderably more than the other three
candidates combined.
UNEXPECTED
It was a sweeping and totally un
expected victory for Isacson who had
not only the endorsement of Wal
lace but his personal campaign ef
forts in the teeming Bronx district
which for years had gone Demo
cratic under the strong organization
of Edward J. Flynn, former Demo
cratic National Chairman.
In the 194(5 Congressional election
in the same district, the Democrats
polled a total of 39,316 votes to 24,-
249 for the ALP candidate.
EARLY LEAD
Isacson, 38, a lawyer who left the
Democratic party to join the ALP.
took an early lead and never was
headed. He was elected to the seat
in the House ot Representatives left
vacant by the resignation of Ben
jamin Rabin who was nominated to
the State Supreme Court. It gave
the ALP two seats in the lower
house.
There was gloom at the Demo
cratic headquarters. Propper had
been expected to win handily, the
main pre-election issue being the
size of the Democratic and ALP
votes.


HENRY WALLACE yesterday ap
plauded the election of American
Labor party candidate Leo Isac
son in a New York special elec
tiun. Isacson defeated both Dem
ocratic and Republican ncminees.
and had been regarded a> the first
te.-t case of third-party strength.
