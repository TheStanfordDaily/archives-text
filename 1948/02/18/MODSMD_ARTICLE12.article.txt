gress today that Japan will be plung
ed into a "blood bath of revolution
ary violence" unless his occupation

its "discredited masters."
The Supreme Allied commander in
the Far East said his efforts to tea- 1
down the "traditional pyramid of
economic power" held by only a few
families, has the cooperation of the
Japanese people who are fully aware
that they have been forced to live
in "poverty and slavery."

"The Japanese people have tasted
freedom under the American con
cept," he said, "and they will not
willingly return to the shackles of
an authoritarian government and
economy, or re-submit it otherwise
to their discredited masters.
"If this concentration of economic
power is not torn down and redis
tributed peacefully and in due order
under the occupation, there is no
slightest doubt that its cleansing will
eventually occur through a blood
bath of revolutionary violence."
His views were set forth in a let
ter to Sen. Brien McMahon in an
swer to the Connecticut Democrat's
request for comment on a recent
protest by Sen. William F. Know
land, R.. Calif., over Mac Arthur's
"socialization" policies in Japan.

Knowland said Mac Arthur's lette:
confirmed "my suspicion, voiced on
the Senate floor in my speeches, that
the policy directives came out of
Washington—that they were not
Mac Arthur's." He added that occu
pation policy should be "to eliminate
cartels and trusts but not to promote
socialism or a controlled economy."
Mac Arthur's letter, which McMa
hon read to the Senate, pointed out
that Knowland was primarily ob
jecting to a policy document pre
pared by the state, war and navy
departments.
