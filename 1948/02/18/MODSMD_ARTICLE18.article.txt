# Rent Control Action Urged
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 17 (UP).â€”
Senate leaders today drove for the
quick passage of a 14-month rent
rent control extension, but House
spokesmen doubted that Congress
cuuici complete action by the time
existing controls expire Feb. 29.
For that reason. Chairman Jesse
P. Wolcott. R.. Mich., of the House
Banking Committee said he still
thinks a temporary extension of the
existing law will be necessary.
Acting Senate Republican Leader
Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Demo
cratic Leader Alben W. Barkley of
Kentucky both called for immedi
ate action on the extension bill ap
proved yesterday by the Senate
Banking Committee.
Taft said the extension bill ap
proved by the Banking Committee
probably would bring some "minor
differences of ooinion."
