# Fish Provide Young 'Uns With Rotation Fanning
## 
### ELLIE LAWRENCE 
A new degree of civilization has been reached by tv/o Aequi
dens paratalgrenses, denizens of the second tank from the end,
:oom 452, Biology Building.
Their actions were first observed last weekend by E. Frederick
Smith, technical assistant in biological sciences, when he noticed

that the tank asphalt was covered
with amber eggs.
The eggs were being fanned in ro
tation by both the male and the fe
male. As soon as one became ex
hausted he or she would give the
other the word to take over.
Between operations, the fish dug
two pits, which are now vibrating
with "'newly hatched fry." The fan
ning procedures are stil! carried on
to keep the air circulating.
As a precaution against the prey
ing of fungus, the young uns are
moved by way of the parents'
mouths from pit to pit about four
times a day. In order not to waste
motion, the junior Aequidens par
talegrenses are washed during the
transporting process.
Any adventurous one that wan
.t rs off limits is immediately picked
up in his parent's mouth and re
turned to the fold.
Native to Brazil, Aequidens par
tnlegrensis is one of the few species
of tropical fish that do not. eat their
eggs as soon as they are laid. These
two have been members of the
Stanford family since June.
