# Reno on the Farm At Phi Kap Dance
## 
### 
"Over at Reno" is the theme of
j the all-campus dance to be given at
the Phi Kappa Sigma house on Feb.
| 28, Tom Belknap, chairman, said.
"'Guests will receive play money
| at Schmarold's Club, and may try
| their luck at the gaming tables
j there," Belknap said. Soft drinks
I will be dispensed at the Blackout
Room and two other bars, while the
"Bank Club" will feature music by
i Nash Betchell and his quartet.
"Come early and stay late," Bel-
I knap added, "and see Reno at no
expense."
