## 
### JOE UPPER 
William Mandel. who held a Hoo
ver Institute fellowship here last
year, will return to the campus Fri
day to participate in the United
Nations program.
He is one of the few American
born scholars who has lived in the
Soviet Union, learned the language
there, and attended the Moscow
State University in the Soviet capi
tal.
The special insight into Russian
cultural, political, and social devel
opments thus gained by Mr. Mandel

qualified him for a post he held
during the war as expert on Russia
for the United Press.
When Mr. Mandel comes to tha
campus Friday, he will participate
with four other scholars in a panel
discussion on "Problems Facing the
United Nations General Assembly."
Others in the panel are Harold J.
Berman, acting assistant professor
of law; Wayne S. Vucinich, assistant
professor of history; Dorothy L.
Thompson, instructor in history;
and David G. Rempel, instructor at
San Mateo Junior College.
