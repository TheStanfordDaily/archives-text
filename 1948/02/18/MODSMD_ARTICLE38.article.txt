lilt played by the Commerce Bull
cogs no comparison of past perform
ances can be made but it should be
a good game.
When pressed for a comment,
Coach Charlie Bushong said "We're
short on pitching—two pitchers com
pose the entire staff—but we have
a sound defense and several prom
ising hitters. It's a young team but
one which shows plenty of spirit."

Freshman diamond prospects for the
season.

er; C —John Herbold; 2B—Ken La
Crosse, and P —Denny Tuffanelli.

1 John Licata, Jim Claypool, Diek Wil
liams, and Joe Pinotti. However, the
long ball hitting of Colletto, Larry
Fink, and Trabueco will partially
| offset their loss.
There will be another game tomor
' row on the Frosh field when the
yearlings lace Vallejo JC. Lefty
! Lloyd Westphal is Coach Bushong's
; choice to see mound duty.
