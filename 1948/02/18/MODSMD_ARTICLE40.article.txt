## Crew Gets New Launch 
### 
Seldom have any ASSU funds been
more thankfully received than the
$300 the student government gave
the Stanford crew several weeks ago
for a coaching launch. It is still more
seldom that $300 brings more benefit
or use.
For several weeks before the
ASSU approval came through, the
oarsmen had had their eyes on a
craft lhat just suited their purposes
but lacked the necessary cash. The
ASSU filled the gap. Former Coach
Lou Lindsey, laid up in a San Fran
cisco hospital, got the first wind of
the boat which was owned by a
Napa resident and passed the word
along to the Farm.
MADE TRIP iO NAPA
With $200 of the voted funds plus
$200 more the crew's meager store
tucked in their pockets, Captain Bob
Setrakian, Ray Haley, and Manager
George Benedict made the trip to
Napa and closed the deal.
The trio put the 16-foot speedboat
on its trailer, brought it back to the
Palo Alto boat club, and hid it for
a surprise showing. The repainted
and overhauled craft powered up to
the crew dock last Monday after
noon, and for the first time Stan
ford's oar club had a launch they
could call their own.
SPEED OF 20 KNOTS
Equipped with a converted Ford
V-8 engine, the red and white boat
clips off a steady 20 knots that al
lows Coach A. A. Clark to watch hi.s
crew in action for the first time this
year.
With four boats taking to the wa

tor every day and a fifth being read
ied. the oarsmen are striving for the
condition and timing that they will
need when the season starts early
in March. Contests have been sche
duled with several of the major
coast schools and other opponents,
although ihe dates await confirma
tion.
