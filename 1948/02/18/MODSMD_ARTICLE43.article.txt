# Polo Squad Preps For Spring Sked
## 
### FRED HANNUM 
After nearly a year of planning
and working for skill, the Stanford
Po'o Association has proved itself
a strong organization. Having start
ed last spring with only a four-man
nucleus consisting of the pre-war
polo team, the association now has
30 members and fields five squads
of trained poloists.
The Stanford Polo Association is
an independent organization not
sanctioned by the University. The
members have financed the plan
themselves.
Before the war polo was offered
in the ROTC. The training was giv
en on Army horses and by Army
officers. A team was put in the field,
but only a light schedule was fol
lowed.
REVIVED LAST YEAR
Last spring Bob Lawson, Bill
Decker, Bill Dirker, and Bill Foster,
experienced men with the polo mal
let and chukker (stick and ball in
polo jargon), sent out a call to those
interested in the "rich man's sport."
At the same time arrangements
were made with Mr. and Mrs. Ross
of the Stanford Riding School to
rent the horses, and polo was re
vived at Stanford.
The early attempts to train mem
bers of the association were tedious, i
Only a few enthusiasts had played
before, and they had to start by
learning the Jundamentals. Most of
them were horseback riders,
but swinging a mallet within inches
of a galloping horse's legs and
touchy ears was a trick that took
careful practice.
DEVELOPED POLO PONIES
A few practice matches were
played last spring. These brought
out many rough spots in team work
and skill. They also developed the
eager horses into better "polo po
nies." Valuable experience was
gained by the new team members. 1
Regular training classes for those
interested in polo have been set up
by the Stanford Riding School.
These include instruction in all
stages of experience, from begin
ning to advanced. The classes have
developed many novice players into I
first - rate poloists who have held I
their own in frequent matches.
C ARDS GAIN EXPERIENCE
The Palo Alto Ranchers have
shown the Stanford Polo Associa
tion a few trick? by playing matches i
at the Stanford polo field. The
Ranchers, men who have played I
polo for years and some of whom j
have national handicaps, forced our ''
team to ride and play their hardest
in the games this year.
The last game was played Sun
day. The Ranchers won. 7 to 5. be- i
fore a large crowd. The public is

becoming more interested in the
team.
The association, now headed by
President Bob Lawson, will under
take a full schedule of matches this
spring with independent teams in
the Bay Area. Dates of games will
be announced early next quarter.


BILL DECKER, hard-riding captain, has been one of the mainstays
on the Farm polo team for the last two years. He holds down the
number two sjmH and is always an offensive threat.

After nearly a year of planning
and working for skill, the Stanford
Po'o Association has proved itself
a strong organization. Having start
ed last spring with only a four-man
nucleus consisting of the pre-war
polo team, the association now has
30 members and fields five squads
of trained poloists.
The Stanford Polo Association is
an independent organization not
sanctioned by the University. The
members have financed the plan
themselves.
Before the war polo was offered
in the ROTC. The training was giv
en on Army horses and by Army
officers. A team was put in the field,
but only a light schedule was fol
lowed.
REVIVED LAST YEAR
Last spring Bob Lawson, Bill
Decker, Bill Dirker, and Bill Foster,
experienced men with the polo mal
let and chukker (stick and ball in
polo jargon), sent out a call to those
interested in the "rich man's sport."
At the same time arrangements
were made with Mr. and Mrs. Ross
of the Stanford Riding School to
rent the horses, and polo was re
vived at Stanford.
The early attempts to train mem
bers of the association were tedious, i
Only a few enthusiasts had played
before, and they had to start by
learning the Jundamentals. Most of
them were horseback riders,
but swinging a mallet within inches
of a galloping horse's legs and
touchy ears was a trick that took
careful practice.
DEVELOPED POLO PONIES
A few practice matches were
played last spring. These brought
out many rough spots in team work
and skill. They also developed the
eager horses into better "polo po
nies." Valuable experience was
gained by the new team members. 1
Regular training classes for those
interested in polo have been set up
by the Stanford Riding School.
These include instruction in all
stages of experience, from begin
ning to advanced. The classes have
developed many novice players into I
first - rate poloists who have held I
their own in frequent matches.
C ARDS GAIN EXPERIENCE
The Palo Alto Ranchers have
shown the Stanford Polo Associa
tion a few trick? by playing matches i
at the Stanford polo field. The
Ranchers, men who have played I
polo for years and some of whom j
have national handicaps, forced our ''
team to ride and play their hardest
in the games this year.
The last game was played Sun
day. The Ranchers won. 7 to 5. be- i
fore a large crowd. The public is

becoming more interested in the
team.
The association, now headed by
President Bob Lawson, will under
take a full schedule of matches this
spring with independent teams in
the Bay Area. Dates of games will
be announced early next quarter.


BILL DECKER, hard-riding captain, has been one of the mainstays
on the Farm polo team for the last two years. He holds down the
number two sjmH and is always an offensive threat.
