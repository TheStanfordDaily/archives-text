## Facts First, Voting Second 
### 
Excom's Sub-Committee on Procedure prepared a valuable
—and interesting —document for The Daily Monday night. The
valuable portion is reprinted on page one. We endorse it 100
per cent.
But we do disagree with the following excerpt from Excom's
statement:
"A recent example of the difficulty that can be caused when this
assistance is not given to Excom is the question of SIKO. Excoin was
given two alternatives. One alternative was the voting of $(>OO more
for postage, in addition to the $800 granted for the year, for the sending
of relief clothing packages—a matter not submitted in time for study by
the members on Monday afternoon and for which immediate action was
requested. The other alternative was the voting down of the motion
to continue in the present course in order to give study to the possi
bilities of accomplishing the same results at less cost to the Associated
Students; since that possibility had been raised and was not covered by
any information available at the meeting. The motion was voted down.
"Many of us who were wholly in accord with the present conduct of
SIRO felt it wiser to investigate any such possibility before granting
the $GOO. The motion to turn the work over to another organization was
accordingly not brought to a vote and was tabled for later consideration."
Excom did have two alternatives —but not the two listed above.
Our ASSU representatives had the choice of either:
1. Voting on a question on which they did not have enough
information to base an intelligent decision; or,
2. Tabling the matter until all the necessary facts were pre
sented.
Unfortunately for all concerned, Excom chose the former.
The Sub-Committee says that many Excom members who
were in accord with SIRO felt that other possibilities should be
investigated before granting the S6OO. Yet, these same members
apparently thought they knew enough then to deny SIRO the
money without looking into the matter further.
Whether or not SIRO should have gotten the money is not
the question here. The point is that Excom acted without first
acquiring all the pertinent facts. If they had had sufficient in
formation, a wiser decision would have been made.
Excom should not yield to pressure by any individual or
group to speed up or delay action. It is a fact that some issues
have been deliberately withheld until Wednesday night and
then presented to Excom, withheld until the last minute because
they stood a good chance of being railroaded through on super
ficial arguments —without being sufficiently investigated by
Excom.
The Monday afternoon pre-Excom meeting was set up to
avoid such situations. No issue, except genuine emergencies,
should be voted upon by Excom until they have ALL the facts!
