## Chinese 'Democracy' 
### 
To the Editor?
On Allen Bletz' "History 1948" column of Feb. 17:
Mr. Bletz appears most anxious to see a truly democratic government
established in China. I'm sure that most Americans would agree that
this is as desirable in China as anywhere else in the world.
But the means that he suggests to achieve thisâ€”ouch! Does Mr.
Bletz have to be hit over the head with facts? By "fact|s I don't mean
those under the by-line of "Tass," too many of which the good Mr. B.
has apparently already absorbed.
He suggests that Chiang "deal peacefully with the Chinese commun
ists by bringing about the democratic reforms they demand." Do com
munists still stand for democratic reforms in your mind, Mr. Bletz?
In those Soviet-dominated countries the reforms seem, to my poor
eyes to have led a reverse course from democracy. Far more than
Chiang's Kuomintang, they seem to have led to a stifling of the opposi
tion. to police state control, to execution for dangerous thoughts.
But let's look at China. Let's look at Chiang's record. By 1937 he had
brought his country well forward on the road to democracy via Sun
Yat Sen's guiding principles. The long war with Japan left the country
exhausted, its people anxious for peace. It also left a considerable body
of armed men under Mao Tse-tung, the communist leader.
Mysteriously, the arms and munitions of these "democratic reform"
troops have steadily increased. No doubt they're still capturing Japan
ese equipment, for it couldn't be that the Russians are supplying them
from Japanese Manchurian factories moved across the border into Si
beria. And it couldn't be that these Chinese communists are a direct
arm of the Soviet police state. Or could it. Mr. Bletz?
Before Chiang can continue the democratic (and I mean democratic,
not "facist" or communist) reforms which he began before the war. he
has to clean up this foreign-supuiied armed camp which wants to make
China into another Soviet satellite.
