PARIS, (UP) —Anti-American reeling in the
Kremlin these days hasn't changed business consid
erations when it conies to selling Russian stamps to
foreign collectors.
Non-Russians who want the bright-colored stamps
issued since 1917 must be ready to put up dollars (or
their black market equivalent) on the line.
The Russian government has a monopoly on
sales to collectors both inside and outside the coun
try. Special government stores provide philatelists
with full sets of the latest issues, which are handled
beyond the iron curtain by the Soviet Purchasing
Commission.
Stamp dealers in Parish say it's Russia's com
mercial approach to stamp issues that makes them
expensive. For example, there have been 12 sep
arate commemorative issues for Lenin in the past
30 years.
With the nation's colleges and universities stag
gering under the impact of one and one-quarter
million veterans added to their enrollments since the
close of the war and with two billion dollars being
expended for the training of veterans for the last
fiscal year alone, increased emphasis is placed on
the need for the proper selection of the course of
training and the vocational objective of the student
veteran.
What the student veteran thinks of the vocational
guidance which he received from the Veterans Ad
ministration and from his college or university was
revealed by a nationwide poll taken by the American
Council on Education, financed by the Disabled Am
erican Veterans, results of which have just been
released.
Present veterans' legislation requires that all dis
abled veterans must select their vocational objective
with counseling assistance of the extensive advise
ment facilities of the Veterans Administration. Non
disabled veterans, those attending school under the
provisions of the GI Bill of Rights, are offered the
assistance of these facilities but are not required to
make use of them. Non-disabled veterans are per
mitted to select any vocational objective they wish.
The nationwide survey of veterans in college indi
cates that only about four out of every 10 are avail
ing themselves of the Veterans Administration voca
tional guidance facilities and that of those who are
making use of VA ugidance, three out of four feel
that the guidance they have received has been ade
quate, while one in four disagrees.
Another phase of vocational guidance is that which
student veterans receive from their colleges and insti
tutions. One-third of the veterans polled said they
had received adequate vocational guidance from
official college counselors sources at their schools,
and 16 per cent stated they had not. One-half of
the student veterans included in the survey said
they had not consulted any sources at their insti
tutions.
The colleges and the VA were not the only sources
of vocational guidance for these veterans, however.
Of those queried, 37 per cent had received additional
help from other sources in the selection of their
vocations.
In this latter group, 30 per cent stated that they
had received help from members of their families,
while 39 per cent obtained aid from individuals al
ready in the vocational fields for which they were
preparing. Eighteen per cent received help from
friends while 11 per cent had received help from
members of their high school faculty.
Further investigation showed that of those who
had received help from these outside sources, 10
per cent thought that this aid was less valuable than
that received from the college or the VA. 23 per cent
thought it was equally as valuable while 30 per cent

felt that this assistance was more valuable. Thirty
two per cent of those receiving help from these other
sources did not make use of the counseling facilities
of either the VA or the college or university which
they were attending.
The disabled veterans, who are required to receive
VA vocational counseling, were asked whether the
VA had given fair consideration to their own wishe
in the selection of a vocational objective. Eighty-five
per cent indicated satisfaction in this respect, 4 pe:
cent were dissatisfied while the remainder had nc
opinion.
Of this group, 1G per cent stated that their dis
ability prevented them from entering vocations which
they would have liked to enter, while three out of
every four said their disability had not affected thei:
choice of vocational objectives. The remainder had
no opinion.

PARIS, (UP) —Anti-American reeling in the
Kremlin these days hasn't changed business consid
erations when it conies to selling Russian stamps to
foreign collectors.
Non-Russians who want the bright-colored stamps
issued since 1917 must be ready to put up dollars (or
their black market equivalent) on the line.
The Russian government has a monopoly on
sales to collectors both inside and outside the coun
try. Special government stores provide philatelists
with full sets of the latest issues, which are handled
beyond the iron curtain by the Soviet Purchasing
Commission.
Stamp dealers in Parish say it's Russia's com
mercial approach to stamp issues that makes them
expensive. For example, there have been 12 sep
arate commemorative issues for Lenin in the past
30 years.
With the nation's colleges and universities stag
gering under the impact of one and one-quarter
million veterans added to their enrollments since the
close of the war and with two billion dollars being
expended for the training of veterans for the last
fiscal year alone, increased emphasis is placed on
the need for the proper selection of the course of
training and the vocational objective of the student
veteran.
What the student veteran thinks of the vocational
guidance which he received from the Veterans Ad
ministration and from his college or university was
revealed by a nationwide poll taken by the American
Council on Education, financed by the Disabled Am
erican Veterans, results of which have just been
released.
Present veterans' legislation requires that all dis
abled veterans must select their vocational objective
with counseling assistance of the extensive advise
ment facilities of the Veterans Administration. Non
disabled veterans, those attending school under the
provisions of the GI Bill of Rights, are offered the
assistance of these facilities but are not required to
make use of them. Non-disabled veterans are per
mitted to select any vocational objective they wish.
The nationwide survey of veterans in college indi
cates that only about four out of every 10 are avail
ing themselves of the Veterans Administration voca
tional guidance facilities and that of those who are
making use of VA ugidance, three out of four feel
that the guidance they have received has been ade
quate, while one in four disagrees.
Another phase of vocational guidance is that which
student veterans receive from their colleges and insti
tutions. One-third of the veterans polled said they
had received adequate vocational guidance from
official college counselors sources at their schools,
and 16 per cent stated they had not. One-half of
the student veterans included in the survey said
they had not consulted any sources at their insti
tutions.
The colleges and the VA were not the only sources
of vocational guidance for these veterans, however.
Of those queried, 37 per cent had received additional
help from other sources in the selection of their
vocations.
In this latter group, 30 per cent stated that they
had received help from members of their families,
while 39 per cent obtained aid from individuals al
ready in the vocational fields for which they were
preparing. Eighteen per cent received help from
friends while 11 per cent had received help from
members of their high school faculty.
Further investigation showed that of those who
had received help from these outside sources, 10
per cent thought that this aid was less valuable than
that received from the college or the VA. 23 per cent
thought it was equally as valuable while 30 per cent

felt that this assistance was more valuable. Thirty
two per cent of those receiving help from these other
sources did not make use of the counseling facilities
of either the VA or the college or university which
they were attending.
The disabled veterans, who are required to receive
VA vocational counseling, were asked whether the
VA had given fair consideration to their own wishe
in the selection of a vocational objective. Eighty-five
per cent indicated satisfaction in this respect, 4 pe:
cent were dissatisfied while the remainder had nc
opinion.
Of this group, 1G per cent stated that their dis
