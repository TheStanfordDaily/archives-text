## HISTORY 1948 
### 
Congress has been asked to appropriate another
300 million dollars for China. The bill will probably
pass. There is no pretense that this money will ever
reach the people who need the help or even that
it is essential for Chiang Kai Shek's armies.
Last year v/e sent General Wedemeyer to China
on a fact finding mission. He returned and wrote a
report. Not only has this report not been published
but the State Department has steadfastly refused to
make it public. The American people might we!
be shocked at the high-handedness of their govern
ment which asks them to spend millions of dollar j
but denies them full access to the facts.
One might expect that the Republican leader
ship in Congress, which favors the appropriation,
might also be shocked. But the Republicans, usually
the first to scream about New Deal bureaucracy, are
strangely silent. They are asking no questions about
the Wedemeyer Report.
Nor are they asking what happened to the over
two and a half billion dollars we have sent since
V-J Day. This is a remarkable lack of curiosity
in view of their vociferous desire for economy ani
for cutting down waste. It is particularly remark
able in view of repeated charge of Kuomintang cor
ruption. graft, and tyranny—charges that have beta
made by Marshall, Wedemeyer, and many respons
ible American business men and missionaries living
in China.
Congressmen might well study the record of
UNRRA in China. We sent half a billion dollars
worth of supplies under this program. The Chinese
relief organization which administered the distribu
tion was so incompetent and corrupt that only a
small fraction ever trickled down to the people. The
despairing letter of 300 UNRRA employees is op.
record—a letter describing how flour intended for
the starving was distributed to rich landlords, how
trucks intended for reconstruction were sold in the
black market or given to the army.
Also on record are the dispatches of the New
York Times, documenting the misappropriation of
these supplies for political, military, *and piivate
purposes.
On record is the story of gross military ineffi
ciency and of increasing dictatorship. Not long ago
the Democratic League, a middle-of-the-road party
was outlawed. Twenty of its leaders have been ex
ecuted. College students who protest Chiang's poli
cies are iired upon by the police, arrested and tor
tured.
Our government knows that the aid we send t
China is not enough to insure a Nationalist victory
over the so-called communists. It is, however,
enough to keep Chiang in power. As long as he
continues his present policies the Chinese people,
who have not lived in peace in more than a decade
are doomed to poverty, hunger, and war.
