# WAYNE SARGENT
## BULL SESSION 
### 
I first came to Stanford in 1946. I took some tests
in May which determined my emotional stability
with such questions as: '"Do you like jam on your
peanut butter sandwiches, or is the peanut butter
by itself enough?"
I answered that I preferred cheese sandwiches
and didn't care for peanut butter at all whether it
was "tripple milled" or "crunchy" variety.
Apparently satisfied with the way I combed my
hair, the administration sent me an "admission cer
tificate," and that's where the trouble began..
The certificate said I would i- be allowed to matric
ulate Autumn quarter."
Well, it was June when I received the notice,
and I wasn't sure at the time whether I could wait
three months just to matriculate or not.
It occurred to me that I had been getting along
all right by myself, and that the Administration
had a lot of nerve telling me when I could matricu
late. Of course, I'd never matriculated at Stanford
before, but didn't think it was going to be any
diPFerent there than anywhere else.
I put the whole thing out of my mind until the
first of September. Around that date I got another
notice saying all new students at Stanford would
matriculate together on September 23. This of
course put a whole new light on the process of
matriculation, and I came to the conclusion that I
had misinterpreted the first message.
I decided to arrive early on September 23
order to select a good matriculation partner.
Needless to say I was disappointed. What had
loomed large as a rather festive occasion ended in

long reg lines, with no hint of the aforementioned
activities.
I've been here for five quarters and the only
thing I've heard further about the whole subject is
"a firm handshake will suffice."
I was perfectly willing, however, to forget the
matter until the other day. A certain announcement
threw me into confusion again. Now I see that I
had entirely the wrong idea of matriculation.
The announcement gave notice that some college
courses were being given in Sweden this summer
which were open "to all regularly matriculated
students."
Well, I reckon that I matriculate as regularly as
the next guy. No one, as far as I know, has taker,
a study on just what constitutes regularity, but I
eat bran flakes in the morning and have a bottle of
Serutan in the medicine cabinet at home. Between
the two I have little trouble.
I don't quite see why it's an entrance requirement
to the Swedish summer courses, but it's nice to know
they take an interest in their prospective students
which isn't altogether academic.
I notice in past Bulletins issued by the University
there is one day each Autumn quarter called Matric
ulation Sunday. Well, why not.' They have a whole
week called "Come to Philadelphia week." They set
aside a week called "Save olives by ordering your
Martinis without them week. So why not a day
for matriculation?
I don't remember what happened this last ma
triculation Sunday, because I wasn't on campus at
the time.
But I'll bet there were a few spots on campus
that were crowded as hell.
