# Monday Pre-Excom Meetings Start To Introduce Wednesday Business
## 
### 
The following is the procedure which Excom wishes campus groups to
follow in bringing matters before its consideration:
Excom would appreciate the assistance of those who have matters
to bring before it. Because of the amount of business covered each week
and because Excom has a sincere desire to give as much consideration
as possible to problems requiring its action, it would be helpful if
certain conditions are observed.
Bring your problem to your Excom representative sometime prior
to the Monday afternoon pre-Excom meeting, so that it may be
presented with some background work already done at the Wednesday
night meeting.
It lias been found that more complete and expeditious action can be
taken if the members are given the opportunity to become acquainted
with the problem, to ascertain the feelings of those they represent, and
to gather any collateral material to bring to the meeting. It was for
these reasons that the Monday meeting was instituted.
Make sure that the person who presents the problem is acquainted
with all its details and is able to present those details in a clear manner.
In a great measure, Excom's decision must be predicated upon the facts
so presented.
Help the person who is to present the problem to anticipate questions
that might be asked in order that the answers will be available at the
open meeting and in order that time will not be wasted in tabling and
re-opening the matter.
Make sure that the person who presents the problem brings back
an accurate report of what action is taken and for what reasons. This is
one of the most frequently neglected conditions and results in most of
the misunderstandings that arise.
By helping us in the presentation of business, you will be helping to
eliminate much of the difficulty and misunderstanding which can occur,
with all the pressure and undeserved feeling they occasion.
