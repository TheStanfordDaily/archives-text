# Senate Group Okays Marshall's Program

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP) —The Senate foreign relations
committee unanimously approved the Marshall Plan today with
a last-minute provision that $3,000,000,000 of the initial 55,300
000,000 appropriation is to be taken from the government's su:
plus for the current fiscal year. That surprise amendment was

sponsored by Sen. Eugene
R.. Colo., for the avowed purpose of (
protecting the Republican tax-cut
ting plan and increasing the chances ;
for passage of the European recov- ■
ery program itself.
DRAWS PROTESTS
It drew protests from administra- !
tion sources and was expected to
be challenged by Treasury Secretary j
John W. Snyder, who has been ;
counting on a $7,500,000,000 surplus j
for the 1948 fiscal year to reduce
the national debt.
Millikin, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, insisted that
there would still be plenty in the
1948 surplus for foreign aid spend
ing and debt reduction. He asserted j
that it would weaken the opposition j
of some Republican Senators who J
feared the aid program might wreck
their plans for a big income tax cut. !
HAS GOP BACKING
He said his amendment had the
backing of Chairman Robert A. Taft
of the Senate GOP policy committee,
and Chairman Styles Bridges, R.,
N.H., of the Senate appropriations
committee, both of whom have been
critical of the aid program.
The committee vote cleared the
way for final senate action on the
bill in plenty of time to meet the
administration's April 1 deadline for
starting aid to the 1G Marshall Plan
nations. The measure is expected to
reach the Senate floor on March 1.
House action is more uncertain.
The House foreign relations commit
tee is scheduled to complete its pub
lic hearings Feb. 27, and there ap
pears little prospect that it can bring
a bill to the floor before mid- March.
LIMITS SPENDING
In its final form, the Senate legis
lation authorizes a continuing 51-
month program but limits initial
spending to $5,300,000,000 for the
12 months ending April 1, 1949.
That stipulation was written in to
permit the new Congress and the
new national administration to re
view the aid program early next
year.
The committee also tied a num
ber of strings to the American aid
to insure that the recipient states
make the best possible use 6f the
dollars and reconstruction materials
they receive.

tions committee which yesterday approved the Marshall Plan with
one reservation.
