# Harris Blames German Peace Delay to 'Big 4'
## 
### 
Responsibility for delay in set
tling problems of peace in Germany
rests with all of the four nations
controlling military zones, said Dr
David Harris last night on the Tues
day Evening Series.
The Stanford history professor
who returned to this county recent
ly after duty with the State Depart
ment in Germany, contended thar
the influence of short - sighted
Americans in responsible positions
has contributed to the bungling ot
the German peace settlement. Re
luctance to permit smaller nations
participation in the settlement has
been damaging also, he said.
Russia, however, more than any
other force can be blamed for thi
troubles of Germany, Dr. Harris as
serted.
"Reparations is the most impor
tant problem of the peace settle
ment," he said. "Russia has fought
for such large reparations that it
would be impossible for German}
to live under the conditions de
manded of her."
"The Russians will do nothim
about reviving economic equity in
Germany until their demand for SI 1
billion in reparations has been met."
Russia has also made trouble ir
eastern Germany over the drawing
of new boundary lines, declared Dr
Harris. Boundary lines, he said,
were drawn wtihout authorization
of the other Al'ies. Land was taken
from Germany and given to Poland
after Polish land had been taken
by the Russians.
Disagreement over this action,
may well be the cause of another
European war, he said.
