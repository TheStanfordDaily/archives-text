fice between 9 and 12 in the morning
and from 1 to 5 in the afternoon.
They also will be on sale at the box

FLETCHER DIRECTS
'"Loophole" by Phil Pearce will be
! the first play of the evening. A story
I about marital entanglements, the
I east includes Ruth Fisher as the wife
I Eleanor; Jack Hume as her husband
Charles; Elaine Maltzman as Nan,
the other woman; Bob Blum as Mar
cus, the rival for Eleanor's affections;
and Marjorie Forkner as Cynthia,
I the long-suffering maid. Allen Flet
cher is directing this play. He is gen
eral director as well.
"The Deceivers" is the second
one-act of the evening. Jules Irving.
1 the director, states, "Robert Kelley's
play is a powerful story of America
20 years hence and a forewarning of
i the possible consequences of indiff
erence." Tlie cast includes Elaine
Davis as Helen Arnold, the wife;
Richard Eagan as Ben Arnold, her
| husband; Dale Moffitt as the 14-year
i old son; and Raymond Griffin as
Allen Webster, a friend of the fam-
I ily.
SURE-FIRE LAUGHS
"Publicity" by Roy Poole will con
clude the performance. According to j
| Hal Todd, the director. Poole's two
comedies "Russian Lullaby" and
"Oh Foolish Love" were very well
received by Stanford audiences. j
"There are as many riotous situ
ations and sure-fire laughs guaran
teed in this play," he continued.
"The satiric portrayals of Bob |
! Brown's motion picture actor and Ed J
Rissien's congressman can only be
overshadowed by the delightful
character of Doug Russell's Uncle
Ned—if at all."
Ed Lefcourt as Mike, a trainer,
and Shirley Ellsworth as Gwen, a
secretary, furnish the play's roman- j
tic interest. The cast is rounded j
out by Herb Hertel as Max, the ;
j near-sighted shyster lawyer, and j
Nancy Williams, Doris Stoner, Steve
Ilyman, and Tom Lupher as report
ers and photographers.
Fletcher states, "This is the best j
over-all one-act bill Ram's Head has
presented in years."
