The ability to do hard work, an
international education, and toler
ance are three very important qual
ities in a foreign worker overseas,
said Alvin Eicholz, Charles Schwie
so, Mary Martin, and Mrs. Virginia
Berryman at last night's Vocorn
meeting on foreign opportunities.
All four agreed that Americans
abroad represent the United States
as a whole, and that foreigners have
a rather bad impression of Ameri
cans at the present time, an impres
sion which could be changed by
tact and tolerance.
Eicholz, who spoke on foreign
trade and business, said that jobs in
world trade are hard work and
should be approached from the in
ternational rather than the domestic
level. Qualifications for jobs in for
eign trade include economic an,d
business as well as political science
knowledge, he said. The opportuni
ties for women in this field are very
limited.
Eicholz also said that sales engi
neers who could explain the prod
ucts and repair them are more im
portant than salesmen.
