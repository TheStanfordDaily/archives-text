### 
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 18 (UP) —Chances for Senate passage
of a bill granting Hawaii statehood are "excellent," Hawaiian
Republican Chairman O. P. Soares said here today.
Soares said he based his optimism on the reaction of Senators
with whom he conferred while in Washington, D.C., where the

Honolulu attorney argued a murder
case appealed to the Supreme Court
from the United States court in
Hawaii.
"Senate and House members of
both parties, as well as President
Truman, have indicated favorable
inclination toward the bill and see
no reason why it should not come
up for Senate passage this session,"
he said.
He added that considerable im
portance attaches to a report to be
presented before the Senate Public
Lands Committee by Sen. Guy Cor
don, E., Ore., following his tour of
the Hawaiian Islands.
"There is no argument against
statehood, but there is some reluc
tance to grant it," Soares quoted one
Senator as telling him.
"From our standpoint, statehood
is as important as any matter before
this Congress — not excepting the
Marshall Plan," the Hawaiian Re
publican chairman said.
