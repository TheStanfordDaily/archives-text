### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (UP)
—President Truman asked Con
gress today to approve a 5570,-
000,000 program of limited eco
nomic help to China. A repub
lican spokesman promptly challeng
ed the project as "inadequate" be
cause it failed to include military
aid.
The President conceded in a spe
cial message to Congress that his
proposal would do little more than
slow the economic disintegration of
China, and he refrained carefully
from asking for military supplies to
help Generalissimo Chiang Kai-
Shek in his civil war against the
Chinese communists.
That omission was criticized
sharply by Chairman Styles Bridg
es, R., N.H.. of the Senate appropria
tions committee who has been one
of the most insistent Congressional
advocates of military as well as eco
nomic assistance to China.
He said China's post-war difficul
ties have progressed far beyond the
point where mere economic help can
turn the tide.
