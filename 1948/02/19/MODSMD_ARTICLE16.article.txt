# Marshall Wants Palestine Decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18 (UP).—
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall warned today that the future
effectiveness and even existence of
the United Nations depends upon
decisive action on the Palestine par
tition problem.
He refused to say what action he
thinks the UN should take but he
said the United States position has
been approximately reached and
will be set forth by the U.S. dele
gate when Palestine debate opens in
the Security Council at Lake Suc
cess next Tuesday. He used the
word "approximately."
Marshall confirmed that the ques
tion of the U.S. embargo on arms
shipments to the Holy Land is under
consideration—along with the whole
complex partition issue — but here
again he did not elaborate.
