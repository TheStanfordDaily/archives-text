## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (UP)
—The Senate voted today to
take a 52,500,000,000 bite out of
President Truman's spending
proposals for fiscal 1949, and
senate republicans immediately
trained their sights on a $5,000,000.-
000 tax slash for this year.
The proposed budget cut was rec
ommended by the joint Congression
al budget committee and the Senate
approved it by voice vote.
The Democrats made no effort to
block the plan but Democratic Lead
er Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky
said the GOP was "shooting in the
dark."
Barkley pointed out that the Re
publicans already have planned to
take $5,600,000,000 from this year's
surplus for payments on the national
debt and for a European aid "trust
fund." He cautioned that Congress
might find that instead of a surplus
this year the government would
wind up with a deficit.
