# French Cabinet Hastens Action On Mobilization
## 
### 
PARIS, Feb. 18 (UP)—The ca
binet voted today to call to the
colors immediately—2 months
ahead of schedule—some 150,-
000 young Frenchmen who will
reach their 20th birthdays during
the first half of 1948.
The cabinet acted amid wide
spread reports that a new Commu
nist-inspired general strike is in the
making. The first call-up for 1948
originally was set for April 15.
Government sources said the mo
bilization order was "absolutely
normal procedure," but stressed
that the government would deal
firmly with violators of the "strike
control" law enacted to break the
general walkout last November.
Socialist Minister of Interior Jules
Moch told an Anglo - American
Press Association luncheon that the
danger of a new general walkout
"is waning."
Even a repetition of last fall's dis
astrous economic shutdown, he said,
could not halt French participation
in the Marshall Plan.
