BUENOS AIRES, Argentina,
Feb. 18 (UP)â€”Argentina served
formal notice on Europe today
that it does not recognize the ex
istence of European colonies or
possessions in Antarctica.
The statement was made by Luis
H. Irigoyen, technical undersecre
tary of the Foreign Ministry, as
navy units of Argentina, Chile, and
Britain steamed toward the waters
south of Cape Horn in an effort to
reinforce the claims of the three
countries to South Polar lands.
Irigoyen also expressed disagree
ment with the opinion voiced today
in Washington by Secretary of State
George C. Marshall that the Ameri
can security zone provided in last
year's Rio de Janeiro continental
defense treaty, does not include the
disputed Antarctic lands.
