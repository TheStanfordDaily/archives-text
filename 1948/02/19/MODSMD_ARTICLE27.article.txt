PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Feb. 18 (UP) —The Foreign Minis
ters of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia charged today
, that the western democracies are rebuilding an "aggressive"
' Germany which threatens the peace and economy of post-war
. Europe. In a 1,000-word declaration issued after a two-day con-

| ference on Germany, the three So-
I viet-dominated nations lashed out
at the Marshall Plan and the policies
of military governments in West
ern Germany. They demanded:
1. Demilitarization in Western
Germany, especially among "emi
! grant groups" Such as those forcibly
deported or who fled from Slav
countries.
2. Fulfillment of German repara
tions obligations.
3. Prosecution and punishment of
war criminals.
4. "Assimilation of transferred
Germans (from Slav countries) to
make impossible all revisionist ac
tivities."
5. Governments of other allied

countries should be consulted "in
connection with the exercise of su
preme authority in Germany and the
examination of questions in which
they have a direct interest."
The conference was called by Po
land.
"Attempts are now in progress,"
the declaration said, speaking of
Bizonia, the combined Anglo-Amer
ican zones, "which would transform
Germany from a center of chaos, to
which she was reduced in the last
war by common action of the allies,
to an instrument of aggression."
