# Anniversary House Warming Given by Red Cross Chapter
## 
### JAQUI ATKIN 
Yesterday the Palo Alto Red Cross celebrated its 50th anni
versary with an official housewarming at their first permanent
quarters. Hal Burdick, radio personality, gave a narrative his
tory, while Frank F. Walker, former Stanford financial vice
president, was master of ceremonies. Stanford's famous Com-

pany K, sent to Manila dining the
Spanish American War, prompted
the organization of the Red Cross
Chapter of the Palo Alto-Santa Cla
ra County on May 16, 1898.
FIRST ACTIVITIES
The first organizers made surgical
dressings and assisted troops pass
ing through San Francisco. Their
president, Mrs. Norman E. Malcolm,
still resides in Palo Alto; the first
school teacher in Palo Alto, Mayine
Bass, who is still teaching, also was
active in the Red Cross.
On Thanksgiving of that year, Mrs.
David Starr Jordon, wife of the first
president of Stanford, contributed
several barrels of apples from which
the women made apple sauce. They
cooked complete Thanksgiving din
ners and shipped them to Stanford's
Company K in Manila.
On Corrcgidor, the soldiers ate the
dinners and, according to their
grateful letters, didn't feel like or
dinary soldiers, but like students
treading that good old Stanford
quad.
CHAPTER REORGANIZED
After the Spanish American War,
the organization, not yet officially
recognized, gave assistance when
ever needed, but it was not very
active again until 1915 when Mrs.
Jordan called the group together to
reorganize for work during World
War I. The group received its offi
cial charter the next year.
Active members were Mrs. John
C. Branner, wife of Stanford's sec
ond president; Dr. William Durand,
authority on lighter-than-air craft
in the last war, Mrs. John W. Mitch
ell, Dr. George J. Price, Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins, Chaplain D. Charles
Gardner, chairman of the home ser
vice; Mrs. Charles D. Marx, head of
the salvage shop, and Mrs. Bailey
Willis, secretary of the chapter.
The chapter had many activities,
including first aid. and food conser
vation classes. In 1917 Farm stud
ents formed an auxiliary chapter
that met in the Women's Clubhouse.

Spanish American War, prompted
the organization of the Red Cross
Chapter of the Palo Alto-Santa Cla
ra County on May 16, 1898.
FIRST ACTIVITIES
The first organizers made surgical
dressings and assisted troops pass
ing through San Francisco. Their
president, Mrs. Norman E. Malcolm,
still resides in Palo Alto; the first
school teacher in Palo Alto, Mayine
Bass, who is still teaching, also was
active in the Red Cross.
On Thanksgiving of that year, Mrs.
David Starr Jordon, wife of the first
president of Stanford, contributed
several barrels of apples from which
the women made apple sauce. They
cooked complete Thanksgiving din
ners and shipped them to Stanford's
Company K in Manila.
On Corrcgidor, the soldiers ate the
dinners and, according to their
grateful letters, didn't feel like or
dinary soldiers, but like students
treading that good old Stanford
quad.
CHAPTER REORGANIZED
After the Spanish American War,
the organization, not yet officially
recognized, gave assistance when
ever needed, but it was not very
active again until 1915 when Mrs.
Jordan called the group together to
reorganize for work during World
War I. The group received its offi
cial charter the next year.
Active members were Mrs. John
C. Branner, wife of Stanford's sec
ond president; Dr. William Durand,
authority on lighter-than-air craft
in the last war, Mrs. John W. Mitch
ell, Dr. George J. Price, Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins, Chaplain D. Charles
Gardner, chairman of the home ser
vice; Mrs. Charles D. Marx, head of
the salvage shop, and Mrs. Bailey
Willis, secretary of the chapter.
The chapter had many activities,
including first aid. and food conser
vation classes. In 1917 Farm stud
ents formed an auxiliary chapter
that met in the Women's Clubhouse.
