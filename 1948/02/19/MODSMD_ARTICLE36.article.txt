## Police Warn Farm Drivers 
### 
George Washington's birth
day and the long week-end are
approaching, and with them will
come smashed automobiles and
mutilated bodies. In order to
keep the automobile death rate from
striking Stanford in an overwhelm
ing way the Council For Student
Control is pushing an auto safety
campaign.
Many students are heading soulh;
others are going northward to the
snow; most are going by automobile.
It is in the hopes that all will return
that the council is sponsoring this
campaign.
Campus Police Chief Gordon Da
vis, in conjunction with the council,
issued a statement telling of the
deaths of three people in automobile
accidents within a few miles of the
campus.
"One of these was a member of
the Stanford Student Body. No one
questions the cause of these acci
dents," Davis said. "They were
caused by the failure of a driver's
judgment. They were going too fast,
thinking too little, and believing
that it couldn't happen to them. Ac
cidents don't just happen."
To further speed the safety cam
paign, the council received a note
from Captain Cassell of the Califor
nia Highway Patrol. Captain Cassell
warned students that the patrol will
be especially alert over the holiday
weekend. "We, the Patrol, sincerely
hope you will all reach your desti
nation and return safely," the cap
tain said. "All officers will be on
duty for this time—with the determ
ination to assist or enforce, as may
be necessary."
Gordy Davis ended his report to
the council with these words: "Sta
tistics seem to indicate there will be
at least two more students killed this
school year. Will you be one of
them?"
