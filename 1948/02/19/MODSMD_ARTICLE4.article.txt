## SIRO to Receive Portion of Funds Originally Sought 
### 
SIRO was granted an appropria
tion of $246.27 last night when Ex
com reopened the discussion on the
relief organization after voting down
two weeks ago the committee's ori
ginal request for $600.
Ed Chambers, secretary of the
lIR, presented new facts which
showed that SIRO had to its credit
at the present time $353.73 in ASSU
funds, and would therefore need
only $246.27 to carry out SIRO ac
tivities for the year 1947-1948.
MITGUARD PRAISES SIRO
Mitguard praised the fine work
SIRO has done as a relief organi
zation, but said they had done a
bad job of financing. "As one ex
ample," Mitguard stated, '"they have
not worked in conjunction with the
treasurer of IIR." He said that the
whole purpose of an ASSU budget
would be defeated if similar re
quests from other organizations for
additional funds were forthcoming.
The willingness of Stanford's fra
ternities to take foreign students,
here on scholarships, into their
houses was brought out by Bob
Coate in his report on foreign schol
arships.
Coate stated that the fraternities
have definitely pledged room, board,
and a nominal sum for spending
money for 11 foreign students for
one year, even though not all fra
ternities have been heard from.
SCHOLARSHIPS TABLED
Excom tabled further commit
ments on foreign scholarships on
the recommendation of the commit
tee. The scholarship committee felt
that they should first investigate the
availability of ASSU funds for tui
tion and the possibility that other
living groups might be interested in
housing these students.
A request from Palo Alto that
Stanford supply a portion of the
money needed for the maintenance
of the Freedom Train while on the
Peninsula was turned down by Ex
com.
Tom Martzloff. ASSU president,
said that he felt few students would
be able to see the train during its
one-day stop in Palo Alto. "Not
only will there be crowds from all
over the county, but it is dead week
on the campus as well," Martzloff
stated.
