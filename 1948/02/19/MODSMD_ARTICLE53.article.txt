# Women Officers Discuss Problems
## 
### 
Mary Ellen Harding of Lagunita,
Alison Dice of Union Units, and
Alice Wanke, Roble sponsor, will
discuss student problems they have
encountered during the past year at
Women's Conference this afternoon.
The}' feel that the discussion will
be helpful to new Conference mem
bers, and hope that it will promote
an exchange of ideas between the
various living areas.
Discussion of the housing plans
will be postponed until next week's
meeting, said Joan Maxwell, Con
ference secretary. Today's meeting
will be at 4:15 p.m.
