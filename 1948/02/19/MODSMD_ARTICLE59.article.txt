# Mysteries of Rugby Play Are Explained

### CRAYTON JONES 
In 1823 during a football game at Rugby School in England,
William Webb Ellis picked the ball up and ran with it. This inci
dent is significant because it marked the beginning of rugby
lootball. Rugby was first played on the Farm in the year 1906,
and during the 11 years which followed it became the most

popular game in this area as most
of the Coast colleges and high
schools switched from American
football to the English game.
A rugby team is composed of 15
players—B forwards and 7 backs.
However, the offensive action is not
limited to the backfield since any
man on the team may run with the
ball.
The main differences between
American football and rugby are
as follows. In rugby there is no for
ward passing: the ball must be pass
ed backward. Blocking for the ball
carrier is not allowed, but the ball
may be dribbled with the feet as in
soccer. When running with the ball,
a player must depend on his own
speed and elusiveness to break into
the open. As soon as the ball carrier
is tackled, he musi release the ball
immediately and roll away from it.
The ball must then be put in play
■>y use of the feet before it can be
\gain picked up.
FIELD GOAL WORTH THREE
Penalties for violations of the rules
ite inflicted by awarding penalty
•cicks; a field goal scored from a
penalty kick is worth 3 points.
A try (3 points), corresponding to
t touchdown in football, is scored
A'hen a player grounds the ball over
vis opponents' goal. However, if he
oses the ball to an opposing player
before he grounds it, and the oppos
ing player downs the ball, then the
iefending team is awarded a drop
dck from its 25 yard line.
The conversion (2 points) follow
ing the try must be kicked from a
)omt which is the same distance
lorn the sideline as the point where
he bail crossed the goal.

The two main formations in rugby
ire the scrum and the line-out. A
erum is called for minor infrac
ions of the rules and involves the
. forwards. They all lock arms and
>end forward to engage the oppos
ing scrum. The ball is then thrown
n between the two groups, and each
lies to work the ball back to the
crum half by use of the feet only.
When the ball goes out of bounds,
line-out is called. The forward di-
Isions of the two teams line up per
pendicular to the sideline and 5
ards from it. The ball is thrown in
>etween the two lines, and the for
wards attempt to secure the ball and
fled it out to the backs who start
passing rush.
.ONG HALVES
The playing field is 110 yards long
ml 75 yards wide, and the goal
osts are directly on the goal line,
he game time consists of two 40-
iinute halves; however, on inter
ollegiate competition the halves are
sually cut to 30 or 35 minutes.
Rugby requires more quick-think
lg on the part of the individual
nan does football since a player
lust take stock of the situation in
split second and act accordingly,
o per-arranged plays have been
lapped out; the individual is com
lecely on his own when he gets
le ball.

In 1823 during a football game at Rugby School in England,
William Webb Ellis picked the ball up and ran with it. This inci
dent is significant because it marked the beginning of rugby
lootball. Rugby was first played on the Farm in the year 1906,
and during the 11 years which followed it became the most

popular game in this area as most
of the Coast colleges and high
schools switched from American
football to the English game.
A rugby team is composed of 15
players—B forwards and 7 backs.
However, the offensive action is not
limited to the backfield since any
man on the team may run with the
ball.
The main differences between
American football and rugby are
as follows. In rugby there is no for
ward passing: the ball must be pass
ed backward. Blocking for the ball
carrier is not allowed, but the ball
may be dribbled with the feet as in
soccer. When running with the ball,
a player must depend on his own
speed and elusiveness to break into
the open. As soon as the ball carrier
is tackled, he musi release the ball
immediately and roll away from it.
The ball must then be put in play
■>y use of the feet before it can be
\gain picked up.

penalty kick is worth 3 points.
A try (3 points), corresponding to
t touchdown in football, is scored
A'hen a player grounds the ball over
vis opponents' goal. However, if he
oses the ball to an opposing player
before he grounds it, and the oppos
ing player downs the ball, then the
iefending team is awarded a drop

The two main formations in rugby
ire the scrum and the line-out. A
erum is called for minor infrac
ions of the rules and involves the
. forwards. They all lock arms and
>end forward to engage the oppos
ing scrum. The ball is then thrown
n between the two groups, and each
lies to work the ball back to the
crum half by use of the feet only.
When the ball goes out of bounds,
line-out is called. The forward di-
Isions of the two teams line up per
pendicular to the sideline and 5
ards from it. The ball is thrown in
>etween the two lines, and the for
wards attempt to secure the ball and
