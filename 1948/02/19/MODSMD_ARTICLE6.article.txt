FIVE PERCENT DONATED
"Donations totaled only $238.12
for the first two days of the drive,"
stated Diana Powers, drive chair
man. "That is less than five per cent
of the quota. We went over the toy
last year, and with the increased en
rollment there is no reason why wv
can't give more than the quota ir
the 1948 drive."
"Only Chi Psi. Theta Chi, Thet.
Xi, Roble 3C, Branner IW have con-
I tributed 100 per cent," Miss Power-
I continued. "Last year contribution.?
from fraternities and men's halls fei
far short of what was expected.
year's weakness seems to fall in the
opposite direction."
