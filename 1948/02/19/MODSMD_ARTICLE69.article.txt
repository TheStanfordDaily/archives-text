"Take me out to the ball game"
i will be the theme song ot the day
! when the Stanford varsity baseba'l
i team engages the Keneally All-
Stars at. 3:15 this afternoon on tha
j Sunken Diamond. This will be the
first official game of the 194S Cat
j dinal baseball season.
I line-up
Reports have it that the All-Stars'
! line-up is filled with professional
1 players who have not yet left for
spring training. The All-Stars are
j anxious to get into shape early be -
i fore leaving for Florida and other
| points south.
VISITORS GOOD
i Although the season is early and
j first games don't mean much, the
I contest should give some idea of
J how the '48 Indian horsehide aggre
| gation will hold up this year since
I their opponents will be probably as
[ good or better than the average col
j legiate squad.
Coach Harry Wolter is hoping
that Catcher Frank MacGraw and
Clyde Dingfelder can provide some
of the Indian power pokes and help
the Cardinal baseball fans forget
that Ward Walkup and Lloyd Mer
riman are no longer wearing the
red and white of Stanford.
Both MacGraw and Dingfelder
j are experienced ball players and
| can really park the apple once they
| get hold of it.
i Frank Laßrum, a talented rookie
| right - bander, is slated to do the
| chucking in this afternoon's game,
| although the official line-ups and
j batting orders have not been an
j nounced.
Wolter will probably put the foL
j lowing line-up on the field, unless
j that old enemy of the diamond. Jupe
