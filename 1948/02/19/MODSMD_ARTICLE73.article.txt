# CAMPUS OPINION
## Retraction 
### 
To the Editor:
I hereby retract, in toto. the statements which appeared in '"Campus
Opinion" today, February 17. over my signature. Since in editing those
statements, The Daily inadvertently changed the context and blue penciled
in such a fashion as to alter the meaning of the statements therein, the
statements are invalid.
JERRY H. WERLIN.
(Editor's note: Campus Opinion letters which do not exceed the 150-
word limit are not cut. Longer letters are edited to the proper length
according to the judgment of the associate editor).
