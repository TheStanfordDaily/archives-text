# About Candidates’ Statements

### 
To the Editor:
I noted with interest the idea of E. L. Thomson and the state of Oregon
set forth in Monday's Campus Opinion column. Allowing each candidate
to make a statement about himself and his views on the ballot seems to
me a wonderful method for arousing more student interest in the elec
ions, if not more intelligent voting.
But why limit the candidate to 10 words? Even Oxydol allows 25.
If the statements take up too much room, the names can be left off.
In fact, that would be better—keep personalities out of the contest. Just
have the voter mark his - 'X" after the statement he prefers.
Take for example a brief description: "FOR WOMEN'S COUNCIL—
1) Blonde, s'-5", 115 lbs., blue eyes, peaches and cream complexion with
sun lamp overtones, voluptuous figure, catchy smile, sense of humor, not
too intelligent—but eager—likes dancing, riding, shopping, swimming,
and a few other things; Lagunita 115. call after six; 2) Brunette, 5 -B'. etc.
Then again, the candidate might illustrate his idea:; thusly:
For Men's Council —1) I'm fer:
New Union, pavilion, and four o'clock leaves;
Fer lower tuition and con home reprieves;
Fer beer in the cellar, short skirts on the Quad;
Fer Women; fer Stanford: fer Sex. and fer God
I'm agin:
Political climbing.
Attention Excom! You're missing a good bet.
