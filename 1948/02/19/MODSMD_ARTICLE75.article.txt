# Communist Methods in China

To the Editor:
The cycle is almost complete. Red forces are again attacking Anshan.
Manchuria.
In the spring of 1946. the American-trained New First Army of the
Republic of China marched triumphantly into this important Manchurian
industrial center. They began to repair what little was leit after Russian
pillage and vandalism.
Then the Red forces came down from the Manchurian hills. They
seized the residential district of Anshan and held it for two days. They
came to destroy what was left.
National Government reinforcements drove the Communists from
the town, but they were too late.
Communist negotiators in Peiping estimated that in 10 years all China
would be in Communist hands. Their method: disruption of China's
economic life, constant guerrilla warfare to prevent recovery. This much
they have admitted. And this is the modern tragedy of China.
These are explosive times. Never have facts been more necessary, more
vital. I have read the Daily's two c lumns on China and I feel that George
Brunn has again dealt with generalities, and that such irresponsible writing
should not be condoned.
