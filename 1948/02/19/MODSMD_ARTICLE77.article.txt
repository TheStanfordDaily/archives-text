More than one-half of the veterans of World War
II now attending colleges and universities take little
part in organized student organizations and activities
outside the classroom, according to the results of a
nationwide poll of veterans in college conducted by
the American Council on Education, and financed by
the Disabled American Veterans.
An additional one-third of the veterans queried
in the survey said they participate in extra-curric
ular campus activities to an average extent, and only
7 per cent answered that they take a large part in
such activities as veterans' clubs, student govern
ment, professional clubs and like organizations.
When those veterans who take but little part in
extra-curricular activities were asked why, <»3 per
cent advanced the reason that they do not have
sufficient time. 20 per cent said they are not inter
ested in such acivities, and 7 per cent reported that
part-time employment prevents their participation.
Further analysis of the results of the nationwide
poll indicates that 73 per cent of the disabled married
veterans now enrolled in college work do not take
part in such affairs because of lack of time, while
13 per cent expressed lack of interest.
In the married non-disabled group, 68 per cent
said they lack the time, and 13 per cent are not inter
ested. Among all the single veterans contacted in the
poll, 58 per cent gave lack of time as their explana
tion, while 24 per cent said they are not interested.
Of the relatively small proportion of student vet
erans who stated that they take a large part in
organized extra-curricular activities on the campus,
27 per cent said they find such activities of great
interest, 18 per cent cited social reasons. 14 per cent
stated that they like to he active, and 11 per cent
said they consider such activities a part of college life.
Only 3 per cent of this group said they thought such
activities would be of help when it comes to getting
a job, and 1 per cent said they participated on a
large scale in order to make personal contacts for
use later on in life.
Informal social and recreational activities, activ
ities as differentiated from organized student activi
ties. attract a much greater participation by veterans
in college, according to the survey.
Asked the extent to which they take part in these
informal activities. 59 per cent of the student veterans
said they participate to an average extent, 21 pel
cent to a very little extent and 19 per cent replied
that they take part in a "big way."
As in the case of organized activities, the married
student veterans, both disabled and non-disabled, are

much more restricted in participation in informal
social and recreational pastimes than are the single
students. Minimum participation in such informal
enjoyments was reported by 34 per cent of the
married veterans and 1<» per cent of the single vet
erans. Participation in a "big way" was reported
by 11 per cent of the married veterans and 21 .pet
cent of the single veterans.
