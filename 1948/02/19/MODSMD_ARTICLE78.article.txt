## HISTORY 1948 
### 
Of all the rackets I have ever heard of or come
across myself, I have finally found one that has ai
the rest beat by far. I refer to the "sweet little
set-up ' that Argentina's dictator Peron has in his
country and is putting over on his countrymen, i
think one would have to travel a long road to find
another man like Mr. Peron.
Argentina's dictator Peron is making big money
out of European hunger. Just a few months ago he
raised the price of export wheat to the impossible
figure $5.95 the bushel. This price is more than twice
the American price—high as that is.
It is too bad that word of this has not reached the
ears of the Argentine farmers—those shirt-sleevei
ones to whom Dictator Peron professes such devotion.
—since his wheat buyers pay them only $1.35 th j
bushel. That's pretty nice, isn't it. paying you:
hungry working countrymen $1.35 a bushel of whea:,
and then turning around and selling it for the unbe
lievable price of $5.95. The knowledge of this little
racket, if it ever does reach the ears of the Argentine
farmers, should help them to discount at least the
finer subtleties of totalitarian oratory.
P»_ron's wheat racket, however, is of more concerr.
abroad than at home. This man is not just satisfied
with swindling the people of his own country, bu:
he is making this whole deal a double hold-up.
It is a double hold-up because he is accepting pay
ment for his wheat only in American dollars. He
refuses to sell and will continue to do so unles?
reimbursed with the American dollar.
Thus you can easily see that these hunger -
harassed nations of Europe are not only being forced
to pay an extortionate price for a basic commodity
which they simply must have to exist, but they
also are being bled of the strongest base for credit—
their all too small dollar-holdings.
At the present time it appears that this deplor
able condition cannot be stopped and that nothing
at ail can be done, either from inside the countr
or outside. Europe needs the wheat that Argentina
produces and Peron realizes this situation and is cap
italizing by it at the hands of his misguided country
men.

—since his wheat buyers pay them only $1.35 th j
bushel. That's pretty nice, isn't it. paying you:
hungry working countrymen $1.35 a bushel of whea:,
and then turning around and selling it for the unbe
lievable price of $5.95. The knowledge of this little
racket, if it ever does reach the ears of the Argentine
farmers, should help them to discount at least the
finer subtleties of totalitarian oratory.
P»_ron's wheat racket, however, is of more concerr.
abroad than at home. This man is not just satisfied
with swindling the people of his own country, bu:
he is making this whole deal a double hold-up.
It is a double hold-up because he is accepting pay
ment for his wheat only in American dollars. He
refuses to sell and will continue to do so unles?
reimbursed with the American dollar.
Thus you can easily see that these hunger -
harassed nations of Europe are not only being forced
to pay an extortionate price for a basic commodity
which they simply must have to exist, but they
also are being bled of the strongest base for credit—
their all too small dollar-holdings.
At the present time it appears that this deplor
able condition cannot be stopped and that nothing
at ail can be done, either from inside the countr
or outside. Europe needs the wheat that Argentina
produces and Peron realizes this situation and is cap
italizing by it at the hands of his misguided country
men.
