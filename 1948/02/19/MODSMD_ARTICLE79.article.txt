## BULL SESSION 
### 
So here I am wheeling out of art class with a roll
of sketches under one arm and the model under the
other, and what happens but . . . POW!—a shovel
plasters the old proboscis. I pry my ivories out of
the model's hull (her name is Ruby) and look. up.
and naturally there on the other end of the shovel
is George.
"Oh." says George, '"thought you was a cop."
'"Well. George, you old—" I say. grinning behind
my blood. "Why in the name of dirty saddle shoes
are you mad at cops?"
"Long story." says George.
Underneath her golden earrings. Ruby is shiver
ing so I say. "Shorten the story. George, and let's
have it."
"Come out of plumbing class t'other day— goin'
out to my ottomobile so's I can drive to work at—
"Yes, I know —at the asbestos works. So what
happened?"
"No ottomobile "
"Somebody stole your car? That's incredible! The
campus has police protection. George. Haven't you
seen those guys with sun glasses driving around read
ing their Gazette? They're police officers. They—"
" swiped my ottomobile."
"George! You mean to say the police officers took
your car? For heaven's sake, why?"
George thoughtfully spades up a few hibiscuses.
Finally he says. "Parked wrong place."
"The police officers towed away your automobile

simply because you had parked in the wrong spot'.''
"Yuh. I done it before."
'"Well, really, George, that's hard to believe. You
parked in the wrong place several times and they
towed away your car. Why don't you go get it back .'
'"Cheaper to buy a new ottomobile."
''Great Scott! I knew parking tickets were ex
pensive, but—"
"You got 497 carrots?"
I clutch the shovel for support. I look at Ruby
but she is posing again. I look at George; he is
slipping on a pair of brass knucks. "George! Wha:
are you going to do? What's up?"
"Cop," says George tersely. "I see one."
So I grab Ruby by the hair and start to drag he:
away. Then I turn. "George, why do you pick fight?
with cops?"
"I lay 'em cold. I bang 'em square on the beak.
"Yes, I understand that—you knock out all the
police officers. But why"
"Soon as they're out cold—"
"Yes. yes! What do you do?"
"I shake out their pocketbooks—'"
"And?"
"I take ail % their carrots."
"Oh, no, George! Not that!"
George tests his knucks on a pillar and the brow:
stone chips fly. Says George to me: "Gonna ge<
my ottomobile back."

have it."
"Come out of plumbing class t'other day— goin'
out to my ottomobile so's I can drive to work at—
"Yes, I know —at the asbestos works. So what
happened?"
"No ottomobile "
"Somebody stole your car? That's incredible! The
campus has police protection. George. Haven't you
seen those guys with sun glasses driving around read
ing their Gazette? They're police officers. They—"
" swiped my ottomobile."
"George! You mean to say the police officers took
your car? For heaven's sake, why?"
George thoughtfully spades up a few hibiscuses.
Finally he says. "Parked wrong place."
"The police officers towed away your automobile

simply because you had parked in the wrong spot'.''
"Yuh. I done it before."
'"Well, really, George, that's hard to believe. You
parked in the wrong place several times and they
towed away your car. Why don't you go get it back .'
'"Cheaper to buy a new ottomobile."
''Great Scott! I knew parking tickets were ex
pensive, but—"
"You got 497 carrots?"
I clutch the shovel for support. I look at Ruby
but she is posing again. I look at George; he is
slipping on a pair of brass knucks. "George! Wha:
are you going to do? What's up?"
"Cop," says George tersely. "I see one."
So I grab Ruby by the hair and start to drag he:
away. Then I turn. "George, why do you pick fight?
with cops?"
"I lay 'em cold. I bang 'em square on the beak.
"Yes, I understand that—you knock out all the
police officers. But why"
"Soon as they're out cold—"
"Yes. yes! What do you do?"
"I shake out their pocketbooks—'"
"And?"
"I take ail % their carrots."
"Oh, no, George! Not that!"
George tests his knucks on a pillar and the brow:
stone chips fly. Says George to me: "Gonna ge<
my ottomobile back."
So here I am wheeling out of art class with a roll
of sketches under one arm and the model under the
other, and what happens but . . . POW!—a shovel
plasters the old proboscis. I pry my ivories out of
the model's hull (her name is Ruby) and look. up.
and naturally there on the other end of the shovel
is George.
"Oh." says George, '"thought you was a cop."
'"Well. George, you old—" I say. grinning behind
my blood. "Why in the name of dirty saddle shoes
are you mad at cops?"
"Long story." says George.
Underneath her golden earrings. Ruby is shiver
ing so I say. "Shorten the story. George, and let's
have it."
"Come out of plumbing class t'other day— goin'
