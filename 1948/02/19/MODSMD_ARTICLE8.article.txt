# Wallace Win Alarms Demos

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 UP).—
The resounding Wallace victory in
New York's 24th Congressional Dis
j trict had the Democratic high com-
I mand frankly worried today.
It put new emphasis on the party
harmony speech President Truman
| will make to party workers at Jack
son - Jefferson Day dinners on a
! coast-to-coast radio hookup at 10
p.m. (EST) tomorrow night.
The White House had nothing to
; say about the Democratic candidate
having been trounced in a four-way
■ race by an American Labor party
candidate backed by Henry A. Wal
lace.
But Democratic National Chair
man J. Howard McGrath blamed it
i on the light turnout of voters for the
! special election. He told Democrats
| they have to "get out and vote" if
they expect to win.
The New York district normally
is heavily Democratic. It has about
96,000 registered voters. Little more
1 than 40,000 of them turned out for
{ yesterday's voting.
While McGrath's didn't say so. he
doubtless had in mind the fact that
President Truman's chances for re
election were considerably shad
owed by the surprise showing of the
| Wallace candidate. Anything com-
I parable in November, while not
j electing Wallace on his third-party
ticket, certainly would cripple Mr.
Truman's chances.
