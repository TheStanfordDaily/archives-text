### 
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 19 (UP)
— Henry A. Wallace's hopes for
the support of the Minnesota
Democratic-Farmer-Labor party
in the 1948 presidential election
were crushed today under a right
wing steamroller.
Left-wingers within the DFL had
hoped to strengthen Wallace at the
first meeting in two years of the
party's state central committee.
But the right wing, led in a floor
battle by youthful Mayor Hubert H.
Humphrey of Minneapolis, adminis
tered a sound whacking to the left
and all but cinched united party
support for President Truman.
The right-wingers out-maneuver
ed the Wallace-ites on these issues:
By a three-to-one vote elected all
seven members to a steering com
mittee for the state convention.
Authorized the steering commit
! tee to write the convention call and
have control of ail DFL funds.
Set a convention date of June
12-13.
Wallace favored an earlier con
-1 vention date.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UP
—President Truman tonight in
vited all "progressive liberals,"
regardless of past political af
filiations, to vote the Democratic
ticket in November as against the
"forces of conservatism."
It way a bold bid to independent
and Republican Liberals to swing
into Democratic ranks and offset de
fections threatened by Henry A.
Wallace's third party movement and
the revolt of conservative southem
| ers against the president's anti-Jim
: Crowism stand.
SOUTHERN BOYCOTT
Leading off as the main speaker
for the Democratic party's fund
raising Jackson-Jefferson day din
ners, Mr. Truman spoke from Wash
ington where 2900 party bigwigs ga
thered at two $100-a-plate celebra
tions. Many Southern Democrats
boycotted the affair, however, and
talked of a party bolt unless the
president backs down on his racial
rights program.
"Under our American system, the
political party is the device around
which men and women rally to a
cause in which they believe, lie said.
"Progressive liberals will rally to
the Democratic party, even though
they do not happen to be members
of the party, because they know that
I tlie Democratic party is their best
j fighting force for the triumphant
I achievement of worthy goals."
NO DOUBT
He made no mention of his own
j political plans in this campaign year
j but there is no doubt in party eir
! cles that he will be the Democratic
| standard bearer.

HENRY A. WALLACE, third
party Presidential candidate, is
reported to lie losing ground in
the Minnesota Democratic-Farm
er-Labor party.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 19 (UP)
— Henry A. Wallace's hopes for
the support of the Minnesota
Democratic-Farmer-Labor party
in the 1948 presidential election
were crushed today under a right
wing steamroller.
Left-wingers within the DFL had
hoped to strengthen Wallace at the
first meeting in two years of the
party's state central committee.
But the right wing, led in a floor
battle by youthful Mayor Hubert H.
Humphrey of Minneapolis, adminis
tered a sound whacking to the left
and all but cinched united party
support for President Truman.
The right-wingers out-maneuver
ed the Wallace-ites on these issues:
By a three-to-one vote elected all
seven members to a steering com
mittee for the state convention.
Authorized the steering commit
! tee to write the convention call and
have control of ail DFL funds.
Set a convention date of June
12-13.
Wallace favored an earlier con
-1 vention date.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UP
—President Truman tonight in
vited all "progressive liberals,"
regardless of past political af
filiations, to vote the Democratic
ticket in November as against the
"forces of conservatism."
It way a bold bid to independent
and Republican Liberals to swing
into Democratic ranks and offset de
fections threatened by Henry A.
Wallace's third party movement and
the revolt of conservative southem
| ers against the president's anti-Jim
: Crowism stand.
SOUTHERN BOYCOTT
Leading off as the main speaker
for the Democratic party's fund
raising Jackson-Jefferson day din
ners, Mr. Truman spoke from Wash
ington where 2900 party bigwigs ga
thered at two $100-a-plate celebra
tions. Many Southern Democrats
boycotted the affair, however, and
talked of a party bolt unless the
president backs down on his racial
rights program.
