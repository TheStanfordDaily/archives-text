CHICAGO. Feb. 19 (UP). —Tht
United Packinghouse Workers' Un
i ion (CIO) announced today that its
i 100,000 members had voted 20 to 1
] to strike against the nation's major
I meat packers to support demands
for a 28 - cent - an - hour wage in
crease.
I The union's strike strategy com
j mittee has approved plans for the
walkout and a strike date has beer.
I set. Union President Ralph Helstein
1 said. He said the date would be an
nounced later.
The strike would affect the "bic
four" of the meat packing" industry
—Armour. Swift, Cudahy, and Wil
, son —and other "major independent
I packing companies," union officials
! said.
Helstein said the packers could
i afford the wage increase and added
! that such a boost would not push
1 meat prices higher.
; "In view of their tremendous
profits in the past year —the big four
j alone receiving over 588.000.000
i profits after tax deductions—we can
i only conclude that the packers have
i no desire to seriously consider the
plight of their employees." Helstein
said.
