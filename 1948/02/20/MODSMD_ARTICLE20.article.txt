# Lane Hospital Installs New Nursery
## 
### 
Stanford Lane Hospital has just
installed a new $20,000 nursery for
newborn infants designed to place
every possible barrier against three
major infant diseases: diarrhea, res
piratory infections, and skin infec
tions.
The new nursey, a gift from the
late Mrs. Richard H. Shainwald and
her brother, Walter D. Heller, cuts
off newborn children from contacts
with the germ-laden outside world.
Designed by Dr. Harold K. Faber,
professor of pediatrics, and Dr. An
tony J. H. Rourke, physician-super
intendent of the hospital, the nurs
ery is isolated in a third-floor wing
of the hospital to limit introduction
and spread of infection.
EXTRA CRIBS
The nursery contains four 10-crib
units for normal babies, a 12-crib
room for premature infants, an ex
tra six-crib room, an examination
room, a nurses' working center, and
rest quarters for the nurses and
physicians.
Ultra-violet lamps will purify the
air. Light fixtues are dust and glare
proof, and the ceilings are sound
absorbent. Even electric clocks are
installed so nurses will not need
watches when they handle the in
fants.
FILTERED AIR
For premature babies there are 12
glass-covered incubators which will
filter air from the outside, humidify
and warm it before it reaches the
delicate lungs.
The nursery floors will be swept
with oil-impregnated compounds to
soak up dust which will cut clown
air-borne bacteria 33 to 63 per cent.
