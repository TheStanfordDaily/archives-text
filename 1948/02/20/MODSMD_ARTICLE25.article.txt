Barbara Hollister represented
Stanford in the 1948 College Board
of Fashions for Bates Fabrics in
New York last week.
Fourteen students from 13 cam
puses in as many states were rep
resented.
During their stay in New York,
the students lived in the Waldorf-
Astoria. Board members partici
pated in fashion discussions, toured
headquarters of Mademoiselle, fash
ion magazine, and attended a fash
ion show.
The group helped design college
room settings in which they were
photographed for back -to - school
advertisements.
This board of campus advisers,
instituted several years ago and
chosen annually, is Bates' barome
ter on camons fashion opinion.
