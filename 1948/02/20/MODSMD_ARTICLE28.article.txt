There is a tremendous reservoir
of liberalism on the younger levels
in America today; the problem is in
tapping it. The American Veterans'
Committee is trying to do .just that.
So said Chat Paterson, national
chairman of the AVC, at a luncheon
held in the Union yesterday.
"Veterans' organizations are a
reality in the United States, and you
might as well have one that believes
in liberal principles," Paterson said.
AVC was organized to fight mis
representation of veterans by other
veteran organizations. It is made up
of 110,000 veterans who were never
going to join a veterans' organiza
tion, he continued.
"When someone comes at you
with brass knuckles, you just don't
throw up your arms and run: you
fight back." To do this, said Pater
son, AVC has a lobby in Congress
which, among other things, has
foughL for price control and a lull
employment bill, and against the
Taft-Hartley labor bill.
He emphasized that AVC does not
shy from non-veteran legislation,
because the committee believes that
what is good for the citizen is good
for the veteran; thus veterans are
not regarded as a special interest
group.
Paterson stopped at Stanford on
his way to Santa Barbara to attend
the AVC state convention. The
luncheon was given in his honor by
Stanford's AVC chapter. It was at
tended by about 45 faculty and stu
dents.
