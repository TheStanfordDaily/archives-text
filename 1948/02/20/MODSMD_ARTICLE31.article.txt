# Powell Sings Same OF Song In New Movie
## 
### NED SACK 
Two old plots with slightly new
twists are playing at the Park The
ater. Struggle as they may, the as
sorted Hollywood wits who made
these pictures cannot overcome the
basic handicap of the antiquity of
the stories.
If you do not mind the repetition,
however, you might enjoy "Song of
the Thin Man" and "Deep Valley."
The former is Myrna Loy and
William Powell again, a little less
funny than usual, but they have a
fascinating mystery to work with.
This mystery, with more suspects
than extras in a California hambur
ger. is so baffling that even Powell
can't solve it.
He supposedly tricks the murder
er into a confession in a grand
finale, but this is one of the most
unrealistic confessions ever filmed.
The humor is greatly aided by the
reliable Keenan Wynn.
DEEP VALLEY
"Deep Valley" is that "I love a
criminal" story, but Ida Lupino and
Dane Clark turn in some excellent
characterizations.
Ida is a stuttering backwoods girl
in an inaccessible California valley.
She is afraid of people. Dane Clark
is a convict working on a road be-
built near by. He is afraid of
the law. Dane escapes, meets Ida.
and you know the rest.
Ida's fear is based on the hate
that surrounds her family and in
which she has grown up. Dane's
fear comes from his complete in
ability to adjust himself to a social
life. This study of fears raises
"Deep Valley" a little above the
usual cop-and-robber tale.
IIOLLYWOOD HORSEPLAY
The beginning of the "Thin Man
has some Hollywood horseplay with
a "cute" child that comes in a one
two punch strong enough to knock
the less experienced out the door.
First there is the question of
whether he should practice his
piano or pitch baseball, stolen
wholeheartedly from "Life with
Father." This is followed by a ri
diculous spanking scene.
Dogs turn in fine performances in
both movies. This looks like a new
trend in Hollywood acting.
