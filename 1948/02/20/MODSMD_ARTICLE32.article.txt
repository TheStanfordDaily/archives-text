# Lake Lag Still Dry; Hopes Fade

### MARGIE SAMPSON 
Swimming and canoeing at Lake
Lagunita look out of the question
this spring. Last year was bad
enough, with only a few days to
enjoy a lake that could hardly keep
the floats from running aground.
Lagunita is empty, Searsville is
about two-thirds full, so it looks as
ii the Spring Water Carnival is go
ing to have to be held in the well
they're going to sink near the Old
Red Barn.
Searsville normally holds 2G5 mil
lion gallons, and at present it con
tains 180 million gallons. It doesn t
look as if there is going to be much
overflow from Searsville into Lagu
nita this year.
And even if there were, it would
take 180 million gallons' worth to
lill Lagunita.
If the lake is going to be filled, it
will be by the end of February. It
is now practically the end of Feb
ruary, with no sign of even a pud
dle in the middle of Lag.
Dry winters seem to go more by
spurts and starts than by seasons.
In the past 15 years. Lake Lag has
been empty only in 19.14 and 1039.
