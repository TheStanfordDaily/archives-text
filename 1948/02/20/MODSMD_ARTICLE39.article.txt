second meeting of the two teams this
year, the Clubmen having defeated
Stanford 3 to 0 in a practice tilt two
weeks ago. However, the Indians
have improved tremendously since
then and will be out to better their
league record of 2 wins and 1 loss.

feated by a surprisingly strong Cal
fifteen, 34 to 8 last week. The Club
men have several former Stanford
ruggers on their squad including
Dave Brown and Don Lipelt.
Another man joined the injured
iist for the Cards this week when
Harvey Doron suffered a leg injury
during practice and will be out in
definitely. However, the squad has
been bolstered by the return to ac
tion of John Kerman. veteran rug
ger who played on the '39 football
team. Kerman had been sidelined
with a broken finger.

Forwards, Sargent Hale, Mike
Spiro, Darrhl Dentoni, Atherton
Phleger, Ed Culm, Bert Avery, John
Rosekrans, Marty Feldman; backs,
Bob Lindsay, Dud DeGroot. George
La Maitre, Fred Willey, Blake Bro
