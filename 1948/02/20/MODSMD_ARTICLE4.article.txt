# REVIEW OF EXCOM DECISIONS
## SIRO Funds Appropiated; Foreign Aid and Freedom Train Discussed 
### 
(Editor's note: This review of
Wednesday night's Exconi meet
ing was prepared by Excom mem
ber Gordon Ness.)
Excom renewed the SIRO ques
tion Wednesday night on the basis
! of new information uncovered dur
ing a two-week investigation into
SIRO's finances and student opin
ion. .
This investigation revealed some
interesting facts. SIRO was not
penniless as Excom members had
; been told a week ago.
Ed Chambers, secretary of the
; lIR, presented new facts which
! showed that there was $353.75 in
lIR funds available for SIRO use,
j and SIRO would therefore need
only $246.27 to carry out its activi
j ties for the year 1947-48.
INDIVIDUAL AIL)
Charles Schwieso, Western Area
j secretary of the American Frincds'
I Service Committee, spoke to Excom,
emphasizing the importance of the
| personal contact that individual
. packages bring.
"Although I realize I am decreas
j ing the chance of getting some bulk
| clothing for the Friends from
j SIRO," Schwieso said, "I feel I must
urge you to continue sending pack
ages individually."
Excom then (on the basis of
new budget information, Schwieso's

opinion, and living group polls)
granted the appropriation to SIRO,
with the stipulation that the money

be taken from the emergency relief
fund.
FRATERNITIES CO-OPERATE
Bob Coate, member of the for
eign students' scholarship commit
tee. reported that a poll taken
among the 24 fraternities revealed
an even greater willingness to co
operate by housing and feeding for
eign students at Stanford than had
been anticipated.
"We had hoped that the frater
nities would offer enough facilitifes
to take care of eight foreign stu
dents for a school year," Coate ex
plained. '"After the poll, we found
that the fraternities offered to pay
for the room and board of 11 stu
dents."
ADMINISTRATION OFFER
The administration, Coate stated,
has offered to match ASSU, man
for man, the tuition of foreign stu
dents, up to a limit of five.
Excotn decided against appropri
ating any money for the Freedom
Train when it stops in Palo Alto.
"This letter from the Freedom
Train asking for $1,500 from Stanford
and Palo Alto combined comes as a
complete surprise," Tom Wood, who
has been working with the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, stated.
"We had previously thought it
would be absolutely free."
Excom referred the letter to the
administration.

fund.
FRATERNITIES CO-OPERATE
Bob Coate, member of the for
eign students' scholarship commit
tee. reported that a poll taken
among the 24 fraternities revealed
an even greater willingness to co
operate by housing and feeding for
eign students at Stanford than had
been anticipated.
"We had hoped that the frater
nities would offer enough facilitifes
to take care of eight foreign stu
dents for a school year," Coate ex
plained. '"After the poll, we found
that the fraternities offered to pay
for the room and board of 11 stu
dents."
ADMINISTRATION OFFER
The administration, Coate stated,
has offered to match ASSU, man
for man, the tuition of foreign stu
dents, up to a limit of five.
Excotn decided against appropri
ating any money for the Freedom
Train when it stops in Palo Alto.
"This letter from the Freedom
Train asking for $1,500 from Stanford
and Palo Alto combined comes as a
complete surprise," Tom Wood, who
has been working with the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, stated.
"We had previously thought it
would be absolutely free."
Excom referred the letter to the
administration.

(Editor's note: This review of
Wednesday night's Exconi meet
ing was prepared by Excom mem
ber Gordon Ness.)
Excom renewed the SIRO ques
tion Wednesday night on the basis
! of new information uncovered dur
ing a two-week investigation into
SIRO's finances and student opin
ion. .
This investigation revealed some
interesting facts. SIRO was not
penniless as Excom members had
; been told a week ago.
Ed Chambers, secretary of the
; lIR, presented new facts which
! showed that there was $353.75 in
lIR funds available for SIRO use,
j and SIRO would therefore need
only $246.27 to carry out its activi
j ties for the year 1947-48.
INDIVIDUAL AIL)
Charles Schwieso, Western Area
j secretary of the American Frincds'
I Service Committee, spoke to Excom,
emphasizing the importance of the
| personal contact that individual
. packages bring.
"Although I realize I am decreas
j ing the chance of getting some bulk
| clothing for the Friends from
j SIRO," Schwieso said, "I feel I must
urge you to continue sending pack
ages individually."
Excom then (on the basis of
new budget information, Schwieso's

opinion, and living group polls)
granted the appropriation to SIRO,
with the stipulation that the money

be taken from the emergency relief
fund.
