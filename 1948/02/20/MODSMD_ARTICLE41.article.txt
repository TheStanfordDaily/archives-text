## BASEBALL Frosh-Vallejo Tilt Ends 15-15 
### 
In as wild a game played on the
Farm in many a season, the Stanford
freshman nine fought an uphill bat
tle to earn a 15 to 15 lie with Vallejo
JC on the Frosh diamond yesterday.
The Frosh scored five times in the
last of the sixth before Umpire Al
Vatuone called a halt due to dark
ness.
Coach Charlie Bushong and Val
lejo Coach Salsbury tossed seven
pitchers into the comedy of errors in
a futile effort to halt the flow of runs.
First baseman Don McComber of
the Frosh and right fielder Williams
of the JC Redskins were on the
mound at the finish.
Walks to John Herbold and Bob
Ames, and Trabucco's double to
right got the final Frosh rally start
ed. Three more passes interspersed
with three wild pitches and two
passed balls brought in the five nec
essary runs, before the game was
called by mutual agreement.
