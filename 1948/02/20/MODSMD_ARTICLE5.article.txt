CHICAGO. Feb. 19 (UP)â€”Com
and wheat prices rose again today,
but wholesale prices for some 900
basic commodities recorded their
sharpest drop in nearly two and
one-half years.
Consumer resistance hit the
wholesale butter market, tumbling
prices as much as five and one-half
cents a pound in Chicago, and groc
ers reported further price reductions
during the week on bacon, butter,
eggs, flour and other basic staples
of the American diet.
Traders said recent high prices
have encouraged consumer resist
ance, and that supplies gradually
have been building up as consumers
turned to substitutes.
2.5 PER CENT DROP
The labor department at Wash
ington announced that average
wholesale prices for about 900 basic
commodities dropped 2.5 per cent
last week, the sharpest break since
September 1946.
The department said that the big
gest break in the wholesale index
last week was in prices of farm pro
ducts, which dropped 7.5 per cent.
The drop occurred, the department
said, "as overall grain quotations
broke nearly 16 per cent, with indi
vidual declines ranging from six to
25 per cent."
PRICES STILL UNSETTLED
Prices on the Chicago Board of
Trade, where the price trend is set
for many foodstuffs the housewife
buys, were unsettled today, fluctu
ating nervously over a range of four
cents a bushel.
Hog prices were 25 to 50 cents per
hundred pounds lower at most of the
big cornbelt livestock markets, with
some declines of as much as 75 cents
per hundred pounds. Cattle prices
were strong to 50 cents per hundred
pounds higher as farmers curtailed
their shipments to market.
