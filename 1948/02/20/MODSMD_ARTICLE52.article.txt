## Peace Through Education

To the Editor:
The Daily comes out with some strange statements now and then, but
the strangest is on page 5 of Tuesday's edition. Here you have a news
story regarding a recently proposed European aid project. You state:
"Conducting the project are the 12 members of Students Concerned,
a group of university students who dropped school in order to make a
positive construction to world peace."
Dropping school is the most negative contribution any student can
make to world peace. Universities were founded because it was realized
that it takes sensible people to build a sensible world. Peace will come
only if we have absorbed the learning of the ages, have integrated that
learning with a realistic faith, and then have gone to work, knowing what
we believe and possessing the knowledge and skill to put those beliefs
into practice. A world educated both morally and scientifically is the
prerequisite for peace, and the responsibility of every student is to take
the fullest possible advantage of the education he is receiving. Suddenly
abandoning that education for a European aid project which has yet to
materialize seems to me to be one of the surest ways of making a positive
contribution to world chaos.
