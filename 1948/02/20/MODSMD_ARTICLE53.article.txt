To the Editor:
According to Dave De Lancy, the facts used by Allen Bletz in his
history column Feb. 17 are "those under the by-line of Tass." I re-read
Mr. Bletz' article with this information in mind, and was rather horrified
to find that he based his arguments about the corruption and tyranny of
the Kuomintang ergime in China on General Wedemeyer's fact-finding
commission report.
It was startling news to me that Wedemeyer's facts are those under
the by-line of Tass. Well, live and learn! I guess that the authorities
George Brunn quoted in his history column Feb. 18 about the corruption,
inefficiency, dictatorship, and fascist terroristic methods of the Chiang
regime also use facto under the by-line of Tass. These authorities includ
ed Marshall, Wedemeyer, American businessmen and missionaries in
China, dispatches of the New York Times.
American newspaperment of the United Press have reported that the
only part of China where any sort of democratic reforms have been
instituted is the communist-led zone. Their reports have appeared
in such "communistic" papers as the San Francisco Chronicle. Chiang's
"democratic reforms," according to report, seem to consist of arrests
and executions of groups and persons opposing his policies. But then, if
the United Press uses facts under the by-line of Tass, everything is ex
plained. The reporters, Wedemeyer, Marshall, Stilwell—all subevrsive
reds, no doubt!
