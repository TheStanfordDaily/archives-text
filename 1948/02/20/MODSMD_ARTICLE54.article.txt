NEW YORK (UP) —The average man thinks of
the world as a nearly perfect ball, about 8.000 miles
thick and some 25.000 miles round. But is it?
The question may be answered by tests taken
during the May 9 eclipse of the sun. The eclipse will
not be visible in the United States.
The National Geographic Society, the U. S. Army,
Navy, Air Force, Bureau of Standards, Coast and
Geodetic Survey, are in training for the event. They
intend to '"shoot" the eclipse as it moves in a sweeping
arc of 5,320 miles from southeast Asia to the western
tip of North America.
The mathematical formulas involved in extracting
vital information from the eclipse are intricate. The
objective, however, is simple. It is to measure with
high accuracy not only the precise distance between
two given points on the earth's surface, but also to
locate the exact position of those two poins on
the globe.
Scientists of the Geographic Society recall the
past efforts to determine the earth's size and shape
have produced results which fall short of the de
sired accuracy.
If their data were used, it was pointed out. the
relative location of many points on the surface of
the earth would be fixed erroneously at anywhere
from several hundred feet to as much as a mile
from their true position.
So, for this eclipse, the scientists hope to make
observations that will enable relative positions on
the earth's surface to be pin-pointed within 150 feet
or less. Such an error is negligible, and the results
should be a boon to highly accurate map making.
Observation sites have been selected in Burma.
Siam, China. Korea. Japan and the Aleutians. The
first observations will l>e from the expedition sites
in Asia, May 9. Since the eclipse moves eastward
across the international date line, the date at the
Aleutian stations will be May 8 for the Western
Hemisphere.
The scientific teams assigned to Burma. Siam and
other parts of Asia will have to keep one eye turned
toward something beside the eclipse. They will be
in sections wheer poisonous snakes and big game
animals live. The most hazardous spot probably will
be Mergut, Burma. It has cobras, and the appear
ance of tigers and elephants is not uncommon..

have produced results which fall short of the de
sired accuracy.
If their data were used, it was pointed out. the
relative location of many points on the surface of
the earth would be fixed erroneously at anywhere
from several hundred feet to as much as a mile
from their true position.
So, for this eclipse, the scientists hope to make
observations that will enable relative positions on
the earth's surface to be pin-pointed within 150 feet
or less. Such an error is negligible, and the results
should be a boon to highly accurate map making.
Observation sites have been selected in Burma.
Siam, China. Korea. Japan and the Aleutians. The
first observations will l>e from the expedition sites
in Asia, May 9. Since the eclipse moves eastward
across the international date line, the date at the
Aleutian stations will be May 8 for the Western
Hemisphere.
The scientific teams assigned to Burma. Siam and
other parts of Asia will have to keep one eye turned
toward something beside the eclipse. They will be
in sections wheer poisonous snakes and big game
animals live. The most hazardous spot probably will
be Mergut, Burma. It has cobras, and the appear
ance of tigers and elephants is not uncommon..
