MEXICO CITY (UP)—A gray-haired man stood
beside a 60-foot-long scale model of the Isthmus
• of Tehuantepec. He talked of the day when dry
docks-on-wheels will whiz 25.000-ton vessels across
southern Mexico from ocean to ocean in twelve
hours.
That day is not far off, according to Modesto
Rolland. the civil engineer commissioned by Presi
dent Miguel Aleman to survey the possibilities of
the $240,000,000 scheme. Rolland. who is due to
submit the results of his year-long study to the
president shortly, revealed some of the details in
an exclusive interview with the United Press.
Rolland is no amateur at converting large-scale
projects into realities. He is the man who introduced
reinforced-concrete construction to Mexico. He also
is responsible for some of this country's best build
ings, ranging from luxury hotels for tourists, one
of the continent's most lavish gambling casions (now
out of existence), the Jalapa Stadium, port installa
tions and Mexico City's recently completed "Sports
City."
But he readily admits the Tehuantepec project
dwarfs anything he has dreamed up in a lifetime
of massive engineering. Roughly, the idea runs like
this:
Ocean-going ships would pull into one of two
ports to be constructed on the Gulf of Mexico at
the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos Kiver and at the
edge of Laguna Superior on the Pacific. They then
would be floated in Diesel-motored super-trainS
which would speed them over 156 miles of 20-railed
track to the other side of the continent.
On the subject of the advantages of the Tehuan

tepee railroad over such competition as the Panama
Canal. Rolland grows loquacious.
"As a matter of fact." he proclaimed, waving a
hand to emphasize the point, "the Panama Canal is
already inadequate. It would be difficult to defend
in the event of a new war. And you must remember
that a railroad can be much more rapidly repaired
after a bombing attack than a canal.
"Tehuantepec is much closer to United States
production centers and markets than Panama. Its
climate is more favorable. Ships could fce moved
over a railroad such as I have in mind five times as
fast as in the Panama Canal.
Holland similarly dismisses the proposed Nicar
aguan Canal under consideration by Congress as
'•difficult and expensive to build and slow to navi
gate."
Under the plan to be presented by Kolland to
Mexico's president, the United States would be
granted no "zone" in Mexico as in Panama. Instead.
Mexico would retain full sovereignty over both the
railroad and the surrounding territory, with its
use open to all friendly nations. Mexico would
finance the cost of construction by offering 49 per
cent of the stock on the open market, retaining 51
per cent.
