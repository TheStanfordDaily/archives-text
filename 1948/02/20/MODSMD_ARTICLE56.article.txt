# HISTORY 1948

### 
WASHINGTON (UP)—Whether the nation will
be spared a round of major strikes this year will be
decided in collective bargaining negotiations during
the 16 weeks starting Feb. 29.
During that period, the ternis on which employers
will hire workers—and conditions under which un
ions will offer their labor—will be worked out in
the automobile, steel, coal, telephone, shipping and
building industries.
Almost all of the contracts were negotiated in
1947 without major work interruptions. Government
officials hope for a repetition when employers and
union spokesmen gather around tables in meeting
rooms closed to the public to work out 1948 terms
by June 30.
James Caesar Petrillo, president off the American
Federation of Musicians (AFL), turned the spotlight
on this year's collective bargaining conferences. He
told a congressional hearing about what happens
behind closed doors when he negotiates with the
National Association of Broadcasters.
He put his arm around the shoulders of his
lawyer, Milton Diamond, and crooned:
"Yes, Jimmy; that's right, Jimmy; you're a fine
boy, Jimmy; let's sign a contract, Jimmy; let's have
a drink, Jimmy—but don't tell the newspapers what
we did today."
"That's the way it goes," he said with a shrug.
A more detailed account of what goes on behind
the scenes was given in 1945 by Walter P. Reuther,
president of the United Auto Workers (CIO). Reuth
er published the transcript of some of his confer
ences with General Motors Corp. preceding the 118-
day strike against the company—longest in the auto
industry.
The National Labor Relations Board is trying tc
find out what kind of bargaining has been done in
the publishing and printing industries in its suk
against the International Typographical Union (AFL).
The union has been charged with a refusal to bar
gain and other unfair labor practices.
Only occasionally do negotiators reveal incidents
like the one when John L. Lewis, president of the
United Mine Workers, and Edward R. Burke, former
president of the Southern Coal Producers Associa
tion. stood toe-to-toe threatening to slug each other
to settle their disagreement.
As a general rule, the sharp personal exchanges
by the negotiators on both sides, the reasoning
debate, the statistical arguments remain secret.
New techniques will be demanded of the nego
tiators this year as most of them for the first time
will be working out a contract to conform to the
legal requirements of the Taft-Hartley labor law.
On their skill rides the nation's chances for industrial
peace and uninterrupted production.

The union has been charged with a refusal to bar

United Mine Workers, and Edward R. Burke, former

to settle their disagreement.
As a general rule, the sharp personal exchanges
by the negotiators on both sides, the reasoning
debate, the statistical arguments remain secret.
New techniques will be demanded of the nego

WASHINGTON (UP)—Whether the nation will
be spared a round of major strikes this year will be
decided in collective bargaining negotiations during
the 16 weeks starting Feb. 29.
During that period, the ternis on which employers
will hire workers—and conditions under which un
ions will offer their labor—will be worked out in
the automobile, steel, coal, telephone, shipping and
building industries.
Almost all of the contracts were negotiated in
1947 without major work interruptions. Government
officials hope for a repetition when employers and
union spokesmen gather around tables in meeting
rooms closed to the public to work out 1948 terms
by June 30.
James Caesar Petrillo, president off the American
Federation of Musicians (AFL), turned the spotlight
on this year's collective bargaining conferences. He
told a congressional hearing about what happens
behind closed doors when he negotiates with the
National Association of Broadcasters.
He put his arm around the shoulders of his
lawyer, Milton Diamond, and crooned:
"Yes, Jimmy; that's right, Jimmy; you're a fine
boy, Jimmy; let's sign a contract, Jimmy; let's have
a drink, Jimmy—but don't tell the newspapers what
we did today."
"That's the way it goes," he said with a shrug.
A more detailed account of what goes on behind
the scenes was given in 1945 by Walter P. Reuther,
president of the United Auto Workers (CIO). Reuth
er published the transcript of some of his confer
ences with General Motors Corp. preceding the 118-
day strike against the company—longest in the auto
industry.
