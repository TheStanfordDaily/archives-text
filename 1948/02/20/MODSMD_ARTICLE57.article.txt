# AL HARBER
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Between the Village and The Oasis there's a bill
board with -the most beautiful pair of legs you'd
never expect to see anyplace else. There's a man's
wrist and an arm somewhere down near her shoes
(filling a tire) as part of an advertisement for Union
or Standard Oil, but neither the well moulded wrist
nor arm compare to those wonderful, wonderful legs.
Just before you get to Carlun's, Foster and Kleiser
has a luscious female selling gabardines for (I think)
Phelps-Terkel. If only magenta gabardine could
make my favorite girl look like the gal on the bill
board! Quel chassis!
Eighty-nine per cent of the display signs—every
thing from Nedrob's ice cream to Nash automobiles
(which you can't spell backwards) make the product
subordinate to the woman. Getting married (in a
Nash), drinking Coke (with a capital "c"), washing
duds with ZUD's (copyright pending), baking bread
(both beautifully wrapped in gingham)—doesn't mat
ter much what they do as long as they sell some
thing edible, drivable, drinkable, or dunkable.
One day I counted the number of magazine covers
on a news stand which took advantage of man's
cupidity and woman's envy to lure them between
those covers. Eighteen of the 25 made me thump
with sheer delight over the modest or sensuously
exposed desirees of the purer sex. Commendable ex
ceptions were Popular Mechanics and Your Horo
scope,
Likewise inside the magazine. "A new angle on

bathing" the ad said, but they had to»put some lovely
curves inside the bathtub to get you to look at it . . ,
"Men like the good looks . . . and smart construc
tion" (a word well applied)—and if you're not care
ful or are over sixty you might notice the socks she's
selling, presumably on a beach. About the only thing
they don't sell is men's underwear—'tho I used to
know a girl who wore jockey shorts.
These longer skirts have made me take to the
corn plaster ads again. I've even gotten so I've named
the models (for my own convenience) and can tell
them apart as easily as you can tell your friends from
behind.
The moral to all this? I never remember the
brand they're advertising, sometimes never even get
to the name. I want something more than pretty
models in the same kind of lingerie, some soil of
identification that would help me when I go into a
store to buy my bunion removers, some generally
acknowledged and physically differentia ting attri
bute. Let's use my imagination for a minute:
"May I help you, sir?" the clerk asks.
"Yes, sir," and then she'll ask, "What kind would
you like—with the mole on the ankle or the birth
mark on the knee?"
. . . hell, I give up. That won't work either—
with the way everything but skirts are rising now
adays I would probably have to live with my corn
for the sake of my modesty!

These longer skirts have made me take to the
corn plaster ads again. I've even gotten so I've named
the models (for my own convenience) and can tell
them apart as easily as you can tell your friends from
behind.
The moral to all this? I never remember the
brand they're advertising, sometimes never even get
to the name. I want something more than pretty
models in the same kind of lingerie, some soil of
identification that would help me when I go into a
store to buy my bunion removers, some generally
acknowledged and physically differentia ting attri
bute. Let's use my imagination for a minute:
"May I help you, sir?" the clerk asks.
"Yes, sir," and then she'll ask, "What kind would
you like—with the mole on the ankle or the birth
mark on the knee?"
. . . hell, I give up. That won't work either—
with the way everything but skirts are rising now
adays I would probably have to live with my corn
for the sake of my modesty!
Between the Village and The Oasis there's a bill
board with -the most beautiful pair of legs you'd
never expect to see anyplace else. There's a man's
wrist and an arm somewhere down near her shoes
(filling a tire) as part of an advertisement for Union
or Standard Oil, but neither the well moulded wrist
nor arm compare to those wonderful, wonderful legs.
Just before you get to Carlun's, Foster and Kleiser
has a luscious female selling gabardines for (I think)
Phelps-Terkel. If only magenta gabardine could
make my favorite girl look like the gal on the bill
board! Quel chassis!
Eighty-nine per cent of the display signs—every
thing from Nedrob's ice cream to Nash automobiles
(which you can't spell backwards) make the product
subordinate to the woman. Getting married (in a
Nash), drinking Coke (with a capital "c"), washing
duds with ZUD's (copyright pending), baking bread
(both beautifully wrapped in gingham)—doesn't mat
ter much what they do as long as they sell some
thing edible, drivable, drinkable, or dunkable.
One day I counted the number of magazine covers
on a news stand which took advantage of man's
cupidity and woman's envy to lure them between
those covers. Eighteen of the 25 made me thump
with sheer delight over the modest or sensuously
exposed desirees of the purer sex. Commendable ex
ceptions were Popular Mechanics and Your Horo
scope,
Likewise inside the magazine. "A new angle on

bathing" the ad said, but they had to»put some lovely
curves inside the bathtub to get you to look at it . . ,
"Men like the good looks . . . and smart construc
tion" (a word well applied)—and if you're not care
ful or are over sixty you might notice the socks she's
selling, presumably on a beach. About the only thing
they don't sell is men's underwear—'tho I used to
know a girl who wore jockey shorts.
