## 
### 
► WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP)—
The recent cocerted action of big
.steel in raising prices virtually in
vites Congress to declare the steel
industry a public utility, Senator
i Joseph G. O'Mahoney, D., Wyo., said
I tonight.
He said in a formal statement that
the price hike indicates that United
Steel "'has a virtual monopoly" and
| that he would sponsor a bill contain
{ ing "two immediate essentials to the
public interest."
These were:
1. Adoption of an excess profits
tax; 2. An appropriation sufficient
to permit the federal tax commission
to publicize the methods used by
big business managers to drive up
prices and exploit the public.
O'Mahoney said legislative action
: is necessary because it is "evident"
i that the Republican-controyyed joint
I Congressional economic committee
''will allow some of the spokesmen
for big steel to attempt to whitewash
themselves," rather than investigate
i the facts.
The committee has scheduled a
hearing on the steel price increase
for March 2. It originally was set
for Thursday.
The Wyoming senator, long-time
campaigner against monopoly, said:
"The action of the steel industry
in announcing a second big increase
of prices within the past six months
indicates that United States Steel
1 has established a virtual monopoly
in the industry upon which all lit
tle and local business and all con
sumers are subject."
