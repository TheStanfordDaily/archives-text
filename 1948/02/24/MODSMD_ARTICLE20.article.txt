# S.C. Group Quits Demos; Leaders Threaten Revolt
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP).—
Rebellious Southern Governors said
tonight that "the present leader
ship of the Democratic party will
soon realize that the South is no
longer in the bag."
Five Southern Govenors issued
the statement after Democratic Na
tional Chairman J. Howard Mc-
Grath had flatly rebuffed their pro
tests against President Truman's
civil rights program.
McGrath told the Governors that
he was committed to Mr. Truman's
program and would support it.
Each Southern state, under the
framework of an overall program,
the Governors said, will work out
the most effective means of resist
ing the proposals of the present
leadership of the party, "but resist
them we will."
It was the most outspoken threat
of revolt from the Democratic party
from the Southern leadership since
Mr. Truman's 10-pc.'int civil rights
program set off a storm of Southern
protests last month.
One of the most effective weapons
in their hands, they believe, would
be to withhold from Mr. Truman
the Electoral College votes of the
Southern states in an effort to throw
selection of the next President into
the House of Representatives.

RIGELAND, S.C., Feb. 23 (UP) —
Two thousand South Carolinians
shouted their approval tonight as
the Democratic committee of Jasper
formally quit the national party.
In the din of wild rebel yells the
committee unanimously approved a
resolution that "there is nothing for
us to do except leave the national
Democratic party and we do hereby
withdraw from said party."
They said they would seek to send
uninstructed electors to the elec
toral college.
It was the first formal revolt of a
southern Democratic organization
from the party in protest to Presi
dent Truman's civil rights program.
H. Klugh Purdy, county Demo
cratic leader for 25 years, read the
resolution in a quavering voice after
a speech in which he absolved Mr.
Truman of blame for the civil rights
issue.
"We cannot blame the president.
He is compelled to get the Negro
vote in the north this year or lose
the election. He has been forced
into this by spineless leaders who
law aside all honor in any political
campaign.
"The issue is clear—is it bettei
for the president to win—or the
south destroyed?"
Purdy told his audience jammed
into the Ridgeland school building:
"While the free and the brave
meet here tonight, the governors o;
southern states are in Washington
trying to wring concessions from a
political party—the weak and de
fenseless seek concessions, the
strong issue ultimatums.
Jasper County hasn't enough vote
to interest a politician, but some
times a child strikes a match tha:
starts a forest fire that thousands o:
men cannot control.
"We hope to strike the match to
night that will set the south aflame."

tional Chairman J. Howard Mc-
Grath had flatly rebuffed their pro
tests against President Truman's
civil rights program.
McGrath told the Governors that
he was committed to Mr. Truman's
program and would support it.
Each Southern state, under the
framework of an overall program,
the Governors said, will work out
the most effective means of resist
ing the proposals of the present
leadership of the party, "but resist
them we will."
It was the most outspoken threat
of revolt from the Democratic party
from the Southern leadership since
Mr. Truman's 10-pc.'int civil rights
program set off a storm of Southern
protests last month.
One of the most effective weapons
in their hands, they believe, would
be to withhold from Mr. Truman
the Electoral College votes of the
Southern states in an effort to throw
selection of the next President into
the House of Representatives.

RIGELAND, S.C., Feb. 23 (UP) —
Two thousand South Carolinians
shouted their approval tonight as
the Democratic committee of Jasper
formally quit the national party.
In the din of wild rebel yells the
committee unanimously approved a
resolution that "there is nothing for
us to do except leave the national
Democratic party and we do hereby
withdraw from said party."
They said they would seek to send
uninstructed electors to the elec
toral college.
It was the first formal revolt of a
southern Democratic organization
from the party in protest to Presi
dent Truman's civil rights program.
H. Klugh Purdy, county Demo
cratic leader for 25 years, read the
resolution in a quavering voice after
a speech in which he absolved Mr.
Truman of blame for the civil rights
issue.
"We cannot blame the president.
He is compelled to get the Negro
vote in the north this year or lose
the election. He has been forced
into this by spineless leaders who
law aside all honor in any political
campaign.
"The issue is clear—is it bettei
for the president to win—or the
south destroyed?"
Purdy told his audience jammed
into the Ridgeland school building:
"While the free and the brave
meet here tonight, the governors o;
southern states are in Washington
trying to wring concessions from a
political party—the weak and de
fenseless seek concessions, the
strong issue ultimatums.
Jasper County hasn't enough vote
to interest a politician, but some
times a child strikes a match tha:
starts a forest fire that thousands o:
men cannot control.
"We hope to strike the match to
night that will set the south aflame."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP).—
Rebellious Southern Governors said
tonight that "the present leader
ship of the Democratic party will
soon realize that the South is no
longer in the bag."
Five Southern Govenors issued
the statement after Democratic Na
tional Chairman J. Howard Mc-
Grath had flatly rebuffed their pro
tests against President Truman's
civil rights program.
