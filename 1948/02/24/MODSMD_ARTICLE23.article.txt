# Debate Will Decide Fate Of Palestine

LAKE SUCCESS. N. Y.. Feb. 23
((UP) —The great Palestine debate
opens in the United Nations secur
ity council tomorrow with the fate
of Holy Land partition—and per
haps that of the entire UN—at stake.
The hinged largely on
the position assumed by the United
States when the delegates of 11 na
tions sit down at 10:30 a.m. to dis
cuss whether to send an interna
tional UN army to enforce Pales
tine's division into Arab and Jewish
states.
Final preparations for the meeting
were completed in an atmosphere
which boded conflict—conflict be
tween western countries and Rus
sia. between the angry Arab states
and the UN, between the UN's
strong pro-partition governments
and Great Britain.
With rare unanimity UN diplo
mats appeared agreed tonight that
the largest single factor would be
the American stand. At least part
of the American position, reached
after weeks of super-secret confer
ences by President Truman and his
administration, will be unveiled in
the council tomorrow by American
delegate Warren Austin.
Fervent speculation failed to cut
through the mantle of secrecy pull
ed around the American decision.
The best guess —and it strictly a
guess—was that Austin would indi
cate in the council tomorrow, sup
port lor a revision of the embargo
on arms shipments to the Middle
East and possible support later for
some kind of UN force. Revision of
the embargo would permit nations
like the United States to supply
arms to Jewish elements in the Holy
Land—perhaps in the hope that this
would be sufficient to thwart the
Arab world's threatened "Holy war"
against partition.
