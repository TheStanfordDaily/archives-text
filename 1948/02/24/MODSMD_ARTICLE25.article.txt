PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Feb.
23 (UP). â€” Communist - led police
seized the headquarters of the left
\ wing National Socialist party and
arrested seven moderate political
leaders today in a series of armed
aids which began before dawn.
The raids, and a statement by the
j Communist-controlled Interior Min
i istry that the National Socialists
! were plotting a revolution, climaxed
a political crisis in which the Com-
J munists appeared to be seeking total
l power.
As their police, newly armed with
I carbines and tommy guns, swept
through the capital. Communist'of
ficials forbade all foreign travel by
Czechs except by permission of the
I Interior Ministry.
President Eduard Benes declared
j tonight that a "parliamentary gov
ernment" would be formed. He did
| not indicate whether he meant a
I five - party government similar to
j the one upset last Friday by the
offer of resignations by 12 ministers
representing three parties.
