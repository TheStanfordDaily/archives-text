# Research simplifies print making with development of "Varigam" Paper
## Chemists and physicists make important contributions

Photographic film that has been over
exposed or overdeveloped usually means
a "hard" or "contrastv" negative—too
much silver is deposited on the high
lights in comparison with that in the
shadows. The opposite effect, a "soft"
or "thin" negative, results from under
exposure or underdevelopment. At one
time photographers had to stock four or
five grades of enlarging paper to correct
for these conditions and get the right
degree of contrast.
To eliminate this expensive, unwieldy
situation, scientists developed "Vari
gam" variable contrast photographic
paper. With "Varigam." the whole
procedure of getting different degrees
of contrast is reversed. Instead of using
several grades of paper, the photog
rapher uses only one. He gets variation
in contrast by use of filters that control
the wave lengths of light reaching the
paper, thereby getting finer degrees of
contrast than are otherwise possible.
The action of "Varigam" depends
on the ability of certain dyes to extend
the sensitivity of silver halide emulsions
beyond the blue and blue-green regions.
This effect was well known to scientists.
But. "Varigam" has an added feature
—it gives high contrast in blue po^-

tion of the spectrum and is also sensi
tise lo light in the green region, with
low contrast.
"Varigam" the work of many men
The first job was one for the physical
chemists. Silver halide emulsions, nor
mally sensitive to blue light, had to he
made to give maximum contrast when
exposed to light in this region.
11 was known t hat certain dyes would
extend the sensitivity of the emulsion
over as far as the infra-red. But they
were not practical for photographic pa
per, being affected by the red safety
light used in the darkroom. Research by
chemists showed that certain dyes such
as l:l'-diethylthiopseudocyanine iodide
extended the light sensitivity only to
the green region. And, most important,
they produced low contrast when used
in lovver-than-normal concentrations.
When such a dye was combined with
high-contrast silver halide emulsion,
the result was an emulsion that gave
high-contrast prints when exposed to
blue light, and low-contrast prints when
exposed to green light.
