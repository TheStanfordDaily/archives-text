# Physicists Develop Filters
## 
### 
Physicists made this contrast control a
reality by preparing sharp-cutting fil
ters that allow the user to control his
printing light selectively. These filters,

which nre attached to 1 ho lens of the en
larger, range l'rom blue for high con
trast to yellow, which cuts out the blue
almost entirely and gives low contrast.
In between are eight grades of filters
with intermediate degrees of blue and
yellow light transmission. All of the fil
ters are made in such a way that neither
light nor printing time needs to be
varied as filters are changed, except the
last two on the blue end. These require
approximately twice the time of the
others.
In "Varigam," made bv Du Pont,
chemical science has given the photog
rapher new economy and convenience
in printing, and a degree of contrast
control more precise than is possible
with any combination of commercial
papers.
