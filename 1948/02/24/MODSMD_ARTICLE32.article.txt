# Dangers to Press Stated by Group

Government and monopolistic
control were raised as two factors
that defeat freedom of the press, one
of the main problems of the Eco
nomic and Social Council, in a
round-table discussion Saturday as
part of the Stanford International
Conference.
Two other important problems
facing the council are economic sta
bility and economic development.
Members of the panel were Eu
gene Staloy, of the World Affaii's
Council; Arthur Mandelbaum and
Edward Shaw, prolessors of eco
nomics; Brownlee Corrin, political
science student; and Miss Elinor
Cogswell, editor of the Palo Alto
Times.
Discussion of a free press cen
tered mainly on the conflicting defi
nitions of a free press as held by the
United States and Russia. Miss
Cogswell defined a free press as the
right, but not necessarily the oppor
tunity, for every man to say exactly
what he pleases in the printed word,
subject only to the laws of libel.
Thus an editor can slant information
in any way he wants.
According to the Soviet Union.
Corrin said, it is the job of the 'gov
ernment to get the truth and this is
done in one newspaper, only.
Mandelbaum asked if the Ameri
can newspapers could really be
called a free, press for they may rot
have government control but they
do represent monopolistic control.
