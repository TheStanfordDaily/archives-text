# Pessimism on UN III-Founded-Ross
## 
### 
In the keynote address of the
United Nations Conference Friday
afternoon in Memorial Auditorium,
John C. Ross asserted that present
pessimism and disillusionment about
the UN is ill-founded.
The tremendous task which we
have undertaken and the accom
plishments that have so far been
made must be considered, he .said.
Ross 'said there is no fundamental
conflict between our system and
that of the Soviet Union. Russian
political immaturity is to be blamed
for most of the difficulties. There
is the danger of letting this difficulty
prevent constructive work.
Ross called for two programs on
specific issues. He believes that this
country should maintain a strong
national defense and support the
Marshall Plan.
