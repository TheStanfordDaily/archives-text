# Menlo Park Players Offer Russian Satire
## 
### NED SACK 
"The Inspector General," a Rus
sian satire on small-town politicians
by Nikolai Gogol, opened at the
Village Theater Friday and will play
again Friday and Saturday nights.
It is produced by the Menlo Park
j Players, an amateur theatrical
group.
Small-town politicians are always
ripe for satire, and Gogol provided
the perfect setting when he had the
small fries quaking in their boots
j because of an inspection by "The
Inspector General."
COMPLETE FARCE
The Menlo Park Players turned
the nineteenth-century satire into a
complete farce. They adopted styl
ized acting. To use their own words,
I they tried "to transmute the traits
of ordinary life into dramatic form
by an exaggeration and stylization
of gesture rhythms, speech rhythms,
I and color. We emphasize the gro
tesque and fantastic, in contrast to
I the naturalist and realist interpre
tations so common to the stage to
day."
They transmit all inner feelings
into direct actions. In the third act,
Iwo men are placed in an extremely
embarrassing position and feel like
crawling out of the room, so they
literally crawl out of the room. The
politicians all have similar motives,

so they act in unison. A man feels'"
as if he is falling all over himself,
so he literally falls over himself.
This is drama stripped of all sub
tlety. Perhaps the motives are so
common that the only fresh ap
proach can be to strip them bare
and make them funny. If the basic !

ideas of a play are so common and
obvious, the play should not be
given.
The Menlo Park Players chose a
very diflieult play and a very origi
nal approach to that play. Their
idea is, of course, experimental.
You may like it; I didn't.
