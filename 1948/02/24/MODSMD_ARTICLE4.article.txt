# Red Cross Relief Service Covers Rehabilitation and Emergency Cases
## 
### JANE McKEE 
American Red Cross set a new j
annual record for disaster relief in i
the fiscal year of 1946-1947 by han
dling 312 disaster operations in 46
states. The worst single emergency
was in Texas City, but victims of
fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, J
and epidemics were also on the list j
of over 300.000 persons who received
aid last year.
National Red Cross functions un- :
der a Congressional charter which I
designates it as an official disaster j
relief agency. While co-operating
with other agencies to avoid work |

duplication, the Red Cross itself
provides for the immediate needs of
food, shelter, clothing, and nursing
care when a disaster occurs.
But care does not end here; later
rehabilitation needs are determined
and further care provided for the
disaster victims. Actually 70 per
cent of all disaster funds are used
for rehabilitation. Homes are re
built and repaired and necessary
long-term medical care is financed
by the Red Cross.
Organization for local disaster re
lief consists of a key committee
which would take charge of relief
activities for Palo Alto. Stanford,
Mountain View, and Los Altos in
the event of a disaster such as an
earthquake or a major train or air
wreck.
This committee, headed by Chair
man Alfred Masters, Stanford ath
letic director, has sub - committees
which undertake various jobs;
skilled personnel are kept in train
ing; a telephone chain for alerting is
maintained; facilities exist for quick
access to food and clothing, and for
emergency evacuation of the Palo
Alto Hospital, Convalescent Home,
or University dormitories.
Stanford is well represented «n
the local committees. The vice
chairman is Alf Brandin, business
manager; Miss Luell Weed of the
women's physical education depart
ment is co-ordinator; and Mrs.
Leonard Ely represents the chapter.
Dr. George Houck, director of the
Health Service is vice-chairman of
the group charged with medical
care, and Miss Margaret Storey, as
sistant curator at the Stanford Mu
seum, is in charge of first-aiders.
The food committee includes Miss
Christine Ricker, director of dining
halls and the Stanford Union, in its
membership. Miss Anastasia Doyle,
counselor for women, and Herbert
Wunderlich, Village counselor, work
on the shelter committee, and Birge
Clark and Professor James Wells of
the history department on survey of
the extent of disaster.

American Red Cross set a new j
annual record for disaster relief in i
the fiscal year of 1946-1947 by han
dling 312 disaster operations in 46
states. The worst single emergency
was in Texas City, but victims of
fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, J
and epidemics were also on the list j
of over 300.000 persons who received
aid last year.
National Red Cross functions un- :
der a Congressional charter which I
designates it as an official disaster j
relief agency. While co-operating
with other agencies to avoid work |

duplication, the Red Cross itself
provides for the immediate needs of
food, shelter, clothing, and nursing
care when a disaster occurs.
But care does not end here; later
rehabilitation needs are determined
and further care provided for the
disaster victims. Actually 70 per
cent of all disaster funds are used
for rehabilitation. Homes are re
built and repaired and necessary
long-term medical care is financed
by the Red Cross.
Organization for local disaster re
lief consists of a key committee
which would take charge of relief
activities for Palo Alto. Stanford,
Mountain View, and Los Altos in
the event of a disaster such as an
earthquake or a major train or air
wreck.
