# Cardinal Cagers Split Two Game Series In Southland
## 
### 
The old adage that the third time is the charm will be tried
this weekend by Everett Dean's Stanford basketballers as they
try to sweep a series from USC and UCLA.
It was th,Â» same story as the previous week last Friday and
Saturday when the Cards beat UCLA and dropped a close one

to USC. On Friday the Stanford
men looked like world beatei-s in
downing UCLA 55 to 47, but the USC
.inx hit on Saturday and the In
dians went down for their third de
feat at the hands of the Trojans,
41 to 40.
In the first affair the Cards forg
ed ahead at 6 to 4 and were never
behind the rest of the evening. Lead
.ng 2(5 to 22 at half time, the Farm
men stretched their lead to 10 points
in the third stanza when they made
the count read 48 lo 38.' Bill Steph
enson led the scoring for the In
dians with 12 tallies.
Contrary to the usual trend of
Stanford play this season, the Red
Machine bounced back in the sec
ond half of the USC contest to turn
a 28 to 17 half time deficit into a
one-point loss.
Stephenson knotted the count at
28-all, climaxing the 11 straight ,
point rally after the intermission. |

The score was tied up twice after
that but the clincher came after Bill
"Sharman's two pointer and Earl
Wallis' gift toss late in the tilt.
Milt Iverson's two field goals brought
the count to 41 to 40 where the
game ended.
Bill Sharman was high for the
night with 15 counters. Captain Babe
Higgins paced the Reds with 11.


HILL ROSE copped individual
scoring honors for (he weekend
by amassing a two-game total of
21 points.
