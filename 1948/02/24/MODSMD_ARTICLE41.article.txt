## CREW 'Harold's Club' At Stanford? 
### FRED HANNUM 
The Stanford crew almost had a
new shell named "Harold's Club."
Last fall two new shells were
bought from anonymous donations
to the crew. Two $1,500 shells were
fine, but there were no sweeps
(oars) for them. One night three
or four crew membes were sitting
around a lew beers and trying to
figure out how to get new sweeps.
One of them got an inspiration and
called long distance—Harold's Club,
Reno.
CALLED RAY SMITH
He talked to Ray Smith Jr. and
put across his proposition. Smith
thought it was fine, but the crew
member would have to talk to Ray
Smith Sr. who was out of town. The
next night the conspirators again
called Harold's Club and talked to
Smith Sr. He was enthusiastic and
referred the callers to his advertis
ing manager.
The advertising manager said
sure, he would donate $650 for new
j sweeps for the crew if they would
name one of Ihe new shells "Bir
old s Club." But he would do this
only if the crew got permission from
J the University administration.
The Univesity cooled the crew's
eagerness by disagreeing with the
proposition. The officials thought
i that headlines reading "Stanford's
Harold's Club Wins" weren't a very
good idea.
ROSENBAUM PRINTS STORY
That stopped things for a while.
But the persistent crew was not to
be affected by disappointments. One
of the men called Art Rosenbaum of
the San Francisco Chronicle and
gave him the story. Rosenbaum
sympathized and used the story in
his column.
Just about that time a host of
alumni came to Stanford for the Big
Game. Some of them read the ar
ticle written by Rosenbaum. They
gave the Stanford crew money for
the new sweeps for their new shells.
There were no advertising ideas
behind this donation. The crew got
their sweeps, and there is no "Har
old's Club" racing for Stanford.
