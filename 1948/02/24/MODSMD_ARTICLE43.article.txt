# Farm Nine Wins 12 to 3
## 
### 
After two practice games fizzled
out as duds, the Stanford varsity
nine finally got around to blowing
the lid off the 1948 season and in
so doinK blew the visiting Portola
Natives right out of the ball park
in an easily won 12 to 3 contest
played Saturday afternoon.
For the Indians, pitchers Frank
Laßrum, Dave Dahle, and Dave
Stott lazily went through the mo
tions of hurling, with each chucker
working three innings and being
about equally effective.
The Natives scored first, getting
an unearned run off Laßrum in the
second inning via a hit and two
errors, but second baseman Bob
Peters scampered across home plate
to tie it up in the Indians' half of
the inning.
For the Indians, Nell led off the
fourth with a walk and advanced to
third on Cole's second hit of the
day. Cole promptly stole second for
his third stolen bag ot the contest,
and both runners scored on Bob
Nava's smash to right.
The following inning proved to be
the big one for the Cardinals as they
banged over four big tallies to lead
seven to one. Hits by Clyde Ding
felder, Nava, Buck Brownson, and
Mac G raw along with passes to

Dahlc. Arce, and Peters did most of
I the damage.
In the fifth, successive two-bag
gers by Ben Cardinally batting for
Cole, and Dingfelder upped the
count to 10. and in the seventh and
! eighth stanzas the Indians rounded
| off the score to an even dozen.
