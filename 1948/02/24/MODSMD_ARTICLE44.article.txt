# Indian Ruggers Tronnce Winged 'o' Men 16 to 3
## 
### 
The Staniord ruggers turned in their best performance of
the season last Saturday as they trounced the Olympic Club 16
to 3. The deciding factor was the aggressive play of the Card
forwards who out-charged and out-fought their opponents
throughout the contest. It was the third consecutive league win
lor the Indians and definitely es-

tablishes them as contenders for the
Rugby Association title.
The first Stanford score came mid
way through the first half. Bob
Lindsay's kick was fumbled near the
goal line by one of the Clubmen,
and Ed Culin kicked the ball across
the goal where Sarge Littlehale fell
on it. In the ensuing pile-up Little
hale lost control of the ball, but
Marty Feldman recovered his fum
ble, and the Indians had 3 points.
Culm's conversion made it 5 to 0.
CLUBMEN SCORE
In the closing minutes of the first
half the Clubmen pushed across
for their lone tally as ex-Stanfordite
Dave Brown took the ball directly
from the scrum and plunged over.
Doc Mason's conversion attempt was
wide.
I The Cards really ran wild in the
j second half. A passing rush, begin
; ning at midfield from Mike Spiro
to Pinky Phleger to Sam Halstead,
! who went the remaining distance
to score, coupled with Culin's con
| version made it 10 to 3.
Shortly thereafter the Indians
, were awarded a penalty kick from
the Clubmen's 30 yard line, where
1 Culin calmly bisected the uprights
with his place kick.
BRESLIN GOES OVER
The game was climaxed by a
whirlwind finish as a long passing
i rush, involving McLean, Mayer, and
finally John Breslin, who grounded
the ball over the goal, produced
' the final try.
Sparkling defensive play by Jack
i Reynolds from the fullback posi
tion prevented the Olympic Club
from scoring. On several occasions
I the clubmen dribbled to within the
! 10 yard line, but Reynolds was
always there to kick the ball out
! of danger.
Coach Willard Classen was very
pleased with the showing of the
teamâ€”particularly the forwards.
"That's the way rugby should be
| played,"' he beamed.
