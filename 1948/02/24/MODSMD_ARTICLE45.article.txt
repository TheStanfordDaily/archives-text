Football season has come and
gone. Basketball has but four games
remaining and in two weeks that
sport will be by the boards. Per
haps it is a bit early to venture into
other fields at this time but let's
take a look at another major sport
that promises to turn the eyes of
the nation's sports fans toward
Stanford.
Late in June of this year, Stan
ford will host the nation's collegiate
golfers in the National Intercolle
giate Golf Tournament.
In 194G, Stanford golfers paid
their own way to the tourney and
won the championship. Last year
the school financed the trip to Ann
Arbor where the linksmen placed
third, LSU winning.
Three of the members of that
squad are now gone and the task of
bringing the title back to the Farm
will rest upon the clubs of four of
six men.
EACH SCHOOL ENTERS SIX
Each school can enter six men in
the nationals, but only the four low
cards are counted.
Bob Rosecrance, Bob Cardinal,
and Jack Shuler are with the team
no longer. Shuler, number two man
last year, has vised up all of his eli
gibility and is acting as team man
ager this season.
Coach Eddie Twiggs thus has
three holdovei-s. Tom Lambie. Ernie
Kellberg, and Bob Rosburg. Ros
burg is back in the fold after taking
a fling at baseball.
To this eroup, Twiggs will prob
ably add three lads who were alter
nates last year; Bill Savage, Bud
Moe, and Bob Crozier. These three,
sophomores all. saw some action last
season and give promise of greater
tilings to come. Moe carded a 70.
lowest score turned in in the All-
University qualifying round. Cro
zier is out of the qualifying rounds
clue to damage to his glasses, but
the stocky Lewiston, Idaho, lad is
a dependable player who has been
giving old man par a tough time.
All in all. the Twiggs men figure
to rank hiph in the nationals. They
will have the decided advantage of
olaving on a course that is well
known to each and every one of
them. The first competition for the
boys will come during spring vaca
tion when they enter the Northern
California Intercollegiate Tourney
at Pasatiempo. California.
Another sport that shows a good
deal of promise at Stanford is soc
cer. For the first time in many
years soccer is being clayed the
year round as it is at Cal.
It is my prediction that the shin
kickers will win the league cham
pionship next fall. So far this quar
ter, Dave Tappan's men have been
meeting the various athletic clubs
from San Francisco. They have lost
three and tied one contest, but the
real story goes deeper than this rec
ord indicates. In the cornretition
that they are meeting now, the soc
cerites are playing the best teams ;
of the Bay Area, and losing to them
is no disgrace to the local boys. The
experience gained will show up
next October and November.
ANDERSON LEADS VIKINGS
In last Saturday's tilt with the
Viking Athletic Club the Cards |
plaved against one of the better j
players of Sweden, a fellow by the !
name of David Anderson.
Anderson had arrived in the '
United States but one week before
this match. He could speak no Eng
lish and his teammates could speak
no Swedish, but the big boy did
quite well, scoring one goal on a !
fine angle shot.

Perhaps this story shouldn't be j
told at this time but here goes.
In one of the Stanford frosh base
ball games last week, the opposing ;
team found it rather easy to get on
base and once there, were getting
the signal to steal from the coach 1
who was sitting on the bench, hid
den by his players.
The catcher for the yearling?, be
ing a Stanford Daily sports writer,
was particularly sensitive to a cer
tain newspaper term. Thus came
about the tip-ofT signal.
In the third inning, the other team

got a man on first as per usual. One
of the spectators wandered over
behind the signal - giving coach.
Came the sign to steal, he yelled,
"Get that by-line. Punch."
The little catcher called for a 1
pitch-out. got it. threw, and caught
the runner five feet before he .
reached second.
Needless to say the visiting team '
had more respect for the arm of the
Farm backstop and the steal signs
became less frequent from there on
out.
