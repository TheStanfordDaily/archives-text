# Leather Punchers Swat SF State 7 to 2
## 
### 
After losing two bouts to the vis
iting San Francisco State boxing
squad via the forfeit route, Coach
Ray Lunny's Farm pugilists
punched their way to an easily won
7 to 2 victory over their aggressive
but less agile opponents.
The only bouts won by the Alli
gators were won before the first
punch was thrown when the Indians
defaulted in the 125 and 130-pound
classes.
The invaders gave one to Stan
ford when they were unable to en
ter a contestant in the light-heavy
weight class.
Best fight of the evening was be
tween Stanfordite Oren Rush ant!
Paul Suez of the visiting team. Go
ing, into the third and final round
Suez had Rush beaten by a sizeable j
margin on points, but Rush rallied j
and knocked his opponent to the ;
deck twice before the final bell.
Rush then went on to cop the match
easily over his demoralized oppo
nent.
Willie Alius. 145 - pound Farm
fighter, treated the Pavilion fans to
a beautiful exhibition of boxing at
(he expense of his opponent. A 1 Wil- 1
Hams. Alius had his opponent on <
the ropes the first two rounds and
on the canvas during the last one.
In an exhibition match Joe Cran- ;
mer of the Cardinal team spotted his
opponent, Earl Mendez, 32 pounds i
but was fighting it out on even
terms with his heavier adversary
until he sustained an eye cut. The
bout was called in order to save I
112

Cranmer for the coming contest
with California.
