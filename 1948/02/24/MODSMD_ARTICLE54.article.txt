## The 						Fraternities' Decision 
### 
Stanford's fraternities have voted to provide housing for
a total of 33 quarters to be divided among a yet undetermined
number of foreign students. It is their contribution toward fur
thering the program of foreign scholarships, a program still
in outline form.
The fraternities have taken an initial step. They have started
a ball rolling that may be taken up by other living groups, and
even other universities, as soon as final plans for tuition, trans
portation, and books are worked out by the scholarship com
mittee.
Although 33 quarters have been pledged by the fraternities,
all 24 fraternities have not given an official reply.
The board, room, and a nominal spending allowance, in some
instances, for each student will come out of the pockets of the
men in the ho'use.
A praiseworthy offer, yes, but we would like further expla
nation of one of the nine points voted on by each house when
they accepted the plan.
The point in question states that the individual house has final
say in the selection of the student.
We realize that the selecting will be done through personal
correspondence, through contacts with persons who will meet
the students this summer, and through records, not after the
foreign applicant has reached Stanford.
Nevertheless, we wonder what criteria each fraternity will
use in selecting applicants? Every student that is made available
to the fraternities will have already been screened by the uni
versity, as each foreign student must fulfill Stanford's minimum
requirements.
Will the fraternities let race, religion, or nationality enter the
picture? Should it or will it be an issue when they are choosing
scholars from abroad?
We hope'that all factors wil be considered in the light of
the objective aims of the scholarship program. May the fra
ternities base their choice of students on the long-run good of
the plan instead of on individual preferences of the moment.
When the fraternities exercise this prerogative, we hope that
selection wil be made on careful consideration of an objective,
not a subjective, nature.
Fraternities probabaly will be choosing from among a great
number of applicants, serious European students desirous of an
education in a free country. It is an important choice ior
small group of men.
Again we stress that the motivation for a fair choice on the
part of each fraternity member should be strong enough to
go beyond individual consideration or prejudices.â€”P. N.
