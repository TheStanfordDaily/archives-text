in peace. Not for charity's sake, for gratitude's sake—but for humanity's
and mercy's. That "other" may be you and those you love. It will be
volunteer giving, from the heart, when the need comes.
It marks you also as an adult citizen of your community. It marks
your community, Full Red Cross giving is a yearly badge upon a
community, as one ready to help itself and its own, and to extend that
help to other communities in trouble and need.
