## HISTORY 1948 
### 
Last fall, G2 students from 32 colleges met at
Stanford to focus their attention and thoughts upon
the more vital problems involving the United States
and the Soviet Union, and to consider these problems
as intelligently, courageously, and realistically as
possible.
This group was known as the Western College
Congress. The representatives developed the more
important aspects of the general theme, and formu
lated proposals and resolutions embodying their
thinking. The Western College Congress, when they
inet last November, voted on and passed seven
articles which contained 37 resolutions dealing with
the United States' national and foreign policy.
These resolutions are your resolutions; they ex
press the thoughts and feelings of college students
everywhere; they voice the opinions and ideas of the
coming leaders of America—the students—regard
ing America's national and foreign policy.
Now, you, as students of one of the universities
represented at the Congress, have a chance to see

these resolutions, to think about
them and discuss them, and then
to accept or reject them by voting
on them February 24 or 25.
The resolutions that are ac
cepted by the majority of the stu
dents will be presented to the
United States' mission to the Unit
ed Nations and to the Department
of State and Congress by two of
the delegates present at the West
ern College Congress.
I firmly believe, along with

thousands of others, that the WCC is a great organ
ization doing great work. I think that as Stanford
students having an active interest in the work
of this Congress, we should take time to look over
these resolutions, study them, and attempt to un
derstand them and express our opinions on them.
With this thought in mind, I believe that a brief
review of the proposed articles will present to
you the case which the WCC is working and fight
ing so hard for—world peace through world gov
ernment.
Article One of the WCC resolutions offers rec
ommendations to remove causes of Soviet-American
differences. The Article proposes that the United
States take no steps in strengthening any terri
torial defenses of any nation except through the
United Nations. It also advocates American support,
through the UN, of groups representing the interests
of the majority of the people. A main point in this
article is that the United States cease supporting
those groups which do not represent majority inter
ests, or which are obviously totalitarian.
Article Two deals with the furthering of the
European Recovery Program. Important in this
article is the stress on the fact that we must aid
European nations at once, and that the Marshall

Plan be administered by a United States agency,
independent of transitory domestic politics.
Article Three attempts to build mutual Soviet-
American trust and confidence in the UN by a
goodwill mission to Russia by the President, an
eventual alteration of UN machinery. Article Fou
sets down recommendations in order to find imme
diate and ultimate solutions consistent with the
facts of atomic fission and the principles of th-±
United Nations. The article proposes that America
halt further production of atomic weapons, that a
federal world government be established immedi
ately through the United Nations, and that th-?
United States join the future international govern
ment and turn over to it American atomic secret?
and all absolute methods of warfare.
Formulating the German peace settlement U
embodied in Article Five. The best way to accom
plish this, according to the proposals, is that Amer
ican Military Government redouble its efforts t..
educate German people to democratic tradition s
and ideals, and for the AMG to take more effective
steps to educate occupation forces in their respons
ibilities as representatives of our nation.
Article Six appears to me to be the most im
portant. The purpose of section six is to encour
age freedom of information, international peace
and foundations for a world community. It advo
cates free flow of information in and out of al*.
nations belonging to the United Nations, and train
ing of correspondents in knowledge and understand
ing of the countries in which they work.
In developing understanding between the coun
tries of the world, this article puts forth the idea
of a large-scale student and faculty exchange pro
gram, and having groups from each country live a
closely together as possible. On the whole, sectio:
six concerned itself with the improvement of condi
tions existing in the United States which are im
peding the effectiveness of its information program
Article Seven puts the basic tensions in the Fa
East on the shoulders of China, claiming that the
responsibility for clearing up that situation re
mained up to the UN. The maintenance of terri
torial and political integrity in China is declared
important, and in establishing this, the United States
should immediately withdraw troops and aid from
China.
There they are. all seven of the resolutions. Look
them over carefully and decide discriminateiy upor
the ones you feel are in the best interest of the
world. Keep in mind a unified world when yov.
discuss these resolutions, when you voice your
opinions, and when you cast your vote for then:.
And lastly, let's all get behind our own delegate
to the Congress, B. J. Denning, and support her ii
her tremendous job by showing a deep interest
in the work of WCC. Let's show the rest of the
country that Stanford is possessed with foresight
and initiative by taking the initiative in this project

ization doing great work. I think that as Stanford
students having an active interest in the work
of this Congress, we should take time to look over
these resolutions, study them, and attempt to un
derstand them and express our opinions on them.
With this thought in mind, I believe that a brief
review of the proposed articles will present to
you the case which the WCC is working and fight
ing so hard for—world peace through world gov
ernment.
Article One of the WCC resolutions offers rec
ommendations to remove causes of Soviet-American
differences. The Article proposes that the United
States take no steps in strengthening any terri
torial defenses of any nation except through the
United Nations. It also advocates American support,
through the UN, of groups representing the interests
of the majority of the people. A main point in this
article is that the United States cease supporting
those groups which do not represent majority inter
ests, or which are obviously totalitarian.
Article Two deals with the furthering of the
European Recovery Program. Important in this
article is the stress on the fact that we must aid
European nations at once, and that the Marshall

Plan be administered by a United States agency,
independent of transitory domestic politics.
Article Three attempts to build mutual Soviet-
American trust and confidence in the UN by a
goodwill mission to Russia by the President, an
eventual alteration of UN machinery. Article Fou
sets down recommendations in order to find imme
diate and ultimate solutions consistent with the
facts of atomic fission and the principles of th-±
United Nations. The article proposes that America
halt further production of atomic weapons, that a
federal world government be established immedi
ately through the United Nations, and that th-?
United States join the future international govern
ment and turn over to it American atomic secret?
and all absolute methods of warfare.
Formulating the German peace settlement U
embodied in Article Five. The best way to accom
plish this, according to the proposals, is that Amer
ican Military Government redouble its efforts t..
educate German people to democratic tradition s
and ideals, and for the AMG to take more effective
steps to educate occupation forces in their respons
ibilities as representatives of our nation.
Article Six appears to me to be the most im
portant. The purpose of section six is to encour
age freedom of information, international peace
and foundations for a world community. It advo
cates free flow of information in and out of al*.
nations belonging to the United Nations, and train
ing of correspondents in knowledge and understand
ing of the countries in which they work.
In developing understanding between the coun
tries of the world, this article puts forth the idea
of a large-scale student and faculty exchange pro
gram, and having groups from each country live a
closely together as possible. On the whole, sectio:
six concerned itself with the improvement of condi
tions existing in the United States which are im
peding the effectiveness of its information program
Article Seven puts the basic tensions in the Fa
East on the shoulders of China, claiming that the
responsibility for clearing up that situation re
mained up to the UN. The maintenance of terri
torial and political integrity in China is declared
important, and in establishing this, the United States
should immediately withdraw troops and aid from
China.
There they are. all seven of the resolutions. Look
them over carefully and decide discriminateiy upor
the ones you feel are in the best interest of the
world. Keep in mind a unified world when yov.
discuss these resolutions, when you voice your
opinions, and when you cast your vote for then:.
And lastly, let's all get behind our own delegate
to the Congress, B. J. Denning, and support her ii
her tremendous job by showing a deep interest
in the work of WCC. Let's show the rest of the
country that Stanford is possessed with foresight
and initiative by taking the initiative in this project

Last fall, G2 students from 32 colleges met at
Stanford to focus their attention and thoughts upon
the more vital problems involving the United States
and the Soviet Union, and to consider these problems
as intelligently, courageously, and realistically as
possible.
This group was known as the Western College
Congress. The representatives developed the more
important aspects of the general theme, and formu
lated proposals and resolutions embodying their
thinking. The Western College Congress, when they
inet last November, voted on and passed seven
articles which contained 37 resolutions dealing with
the United States' national and foreign policy.
These resolutions are your resolutions; they ex
press the thoughts and feelings of college students
everywhere; they voice the opinions and ideas of the
coming leaders of America—the students—regard
ing America's national and foreign policy.
Now, you, as students of one of the universities
represented at the Congress, have a chance to see

these resolutions, to think about
them and discuss them, and then
to accept or reject them by voting
on them February 24 or 25.
The resolutions that are ac
cepted by the majority of the stu
dents will be presented to the
United States' mission to the Unit
ed Nations and to the Department
of State and Congress by two of
the delegates present at the West
ern College Congress.

Last fall, G2 students from 32 colleges met at
Stanford to focus their attention and thoughts upon
the more vital problems involving the United States
and the Soviet Union, and to consider these problems
as intelligently, courageously, and realistically as
possible.
This group was known as the Western College
Congress. The representatives developed the more
important aspects of the general theme, and formu
lated proposals and resolutions embodying their
thinking. The Western College Congress, when they
inet last November, voted on and passed seven
articles which contained 37 resolutions dealing with
the United States' national and foreign policy.
These resolutions are your resolutions; they ex
press the thoughts and feelings of college students
everywhere; they voice the opinions and ideas of the
coming leaders of America—the students—regard
ing America's national and foreign policy.
Now, you, as students of one of the universities
represented at the Congress, have a chance to see

these resolutions, to think about
them and discuss them, and then
to accept or reject them by voting
on them February 24 or 25.
The resolutions that are ac
cepted by the majority of the stu
dents will be presented to the
United States' mission to the Unit
ed Nations and to the Department
of State and Congress by two of
the delegates present at the West
ern College Congress.
I firmly believe, along with

thousands of others, that the WCC is a great organ
ization doing great work. I think that as Stanford
students having an active interest in the work
of this Congress, we should take time to look over
these resolutions, study them, and attempt to un
derstand them and express our opinions on them.
With this thought in mind, I believe that a brief
review of the proposed articles will present to
you the case which the WCC is working and fight
ing so hard for—world peace through world gov
ernment.
Article One of the WCC resolutions offers rec
ommendations to remove causes of Soviet-American
differences. The Article proposes that the United
States take no steps in strengthening any terri
torial defenses of any nation except through the
United Nations. It also advocates American support,
through the UN, of groups representing the interests
of the majority of the people. A main point in this
article is that the United States cease supporting
those groups which do not represent majority inter
ests, or which are obviously totalitarian.
Article Two deals with the furthering of the
European Recovery Program. Important in this
article is the stress on the fact that we must aid
European nations at once, and that the Marshall

Plan be administered by a United States agency,
independent of transitory domestic politics.
Article Three attempts to build mutual Soviet-
American trust and confidence in the UN by a
goodwill mission to Russia by the President, an
eventual alteration of UN machinery. Article Fou
sets down recommendations in order to find imme
diate and ultimate solutions consistent with the
facts of atomic fission and the principles of th-±
United Nations. The article proposes that America
halt further production of atomic weapons, that a
federal world government be established immedi
ately through the United Nations, and that th-?
