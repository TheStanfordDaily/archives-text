LONDON (UP) —A detailed plan for a two billion
pound sterling ($8,000,000.00(1) state lottery to reduce
Britain's income tax and the national debt has been
submitted to the government and members of Par
liament.
Chief sponsor is Major Dennis Eric Smith, banker
and managing director of a London discount house.
His associates include E. P. Smith. Conservative
member of Parliament, and Godfrey Butler, brother
of the Earl of Carrick.
Announcement of the lottery plan aroused wide
spread interest, but it appeared unlikely that the
government would approve it.
, The sponsors suggested 2.000.000.000 one-pound
tickets be offered for sale through post offices, other
government departments, banks, insurance com
panies, stock brokers and other approved institu
tions to buyers anywhere in the world.
The proceeds would then be apportioned as fol
lows:
i' 1.000.000.000 in prizes.
£950.000.000 to the state, comprising £500.000.000
for the reduction of the national debt, t300.000.000
toward reduction of the present income tax of nine
shillings in the pound. £100.000.000 for the purchase
of more food from the Empire. £45.000,000 to aid the
elderly and the ill and £5.000.000 for medical research.
£50.000.000 would be for expenses, comprising £20.-
000.000 in sales commissions and £30.000.000 for or
ganization.
The sponsors made no specific proposals on the
amount of the individual prizes, but suggested there
should lie 100 first prizes. 100 second. 21)0 third and
so on down through 1,000,000 tenth prizes.
They said the amount diverted to the income tax
alone would enable its reduction by two shillings,
six-pense or three shillings on every pound (50 or
GO cents on every four dollars).
The lottery should be held once a year for three
or four years with the provision that it must be sanc
tioned each ve?r by Parliament, they said.
Britain has liad state lotteries off and on for
almost 500 yea's, the last on Oct. 18, 182f>. The first
was floated by Queen Elizabeth to obtain fluids to
Improve Britain's harbors and for other public works.
The first prize was listed as £3,000 iti cash, several
hundred pounds in silver and gold plate and "good
tapissarie meete for hangings and other covertures
and certain sortcs of good linen cloth."

DUBLIN (UP) —As pawn broker to the Sovie*
Union since 1920. tiny Ireland still holds a trove o:
Romanoff jewels worth an estimated 40 times the
amount for which it was hocked.
The collection is said to include a magnificent
tiara, a diamond necklace intertwined with pearls,
and earrings and pendants with a total estimated
value of $-400,000.
The jewels rest solidly in the vaults of the Bank
of Ireland, still as beautiful as they were before
twilight eclipsed the Russian royal family, claiming
their lives as well as their possessions.
The story of the jewels, now almost a legend
to those in Ireland who knew of the transaction,
has reached the public because of politics.
Ex-Premier Eamon de Valera. fighting for hi
political life, was forced to reveal that Russia had
never redeemed the jewels. They had been gi\en
to representatives of the Irish Republic in the
United States as security for a loan estimated at
between $8,000 and $10,000.
De Valera was answering Dr. Patrick MacCartan.
who opposed him in the Irish general elections early
this month. Only a handful of Irishmen, mostly
members of the old Irish Republican Brotherhood,
knew of the deal whereby a mission of the fledgling
Soviet Union received the dollars it wanted des
perately in exchange for the jewelry.
It was said that the collateral was valued at the
time of the transaction at around $400,000. While
the collection was not part of the crown jewels, it
had belonged to members of the Tsar's family.
The jewels reportedly were turned over to the
Irish mission in New York. De Valera was a member
of that mission. With the greatest of secrecy, the
jewels were smuggled into Ireland in upholsterec
furniture.
The most believable account of how the jewels
reached the government coffers was disclcsid b\
Mrs. Kathleen Roland O'Donavan, whose brother.
Harry Roland, was Ireland's representative in the
United States at that time. Boland reportedly was
the actual recipient of the Russian security. In 1922,
during the civil war. he was found mortally wound
ed in the Dublin mountains.
Brought to his mother's house, according to his
sister, the dying Boland directed that Jie jewels
should be held and entrusted to De Valera when :
returned to power, which he did in 1932.

The sponsors made no specific proposals on the

should lie 100 first prizes. 100 second. 21)0 third and

DUBLIN (UP) —As pawn broker to the Sovie*
Union since 1920. tiny Ireland still holds a trove o:
Romanoff jewels worth an estimated 40 times the
amount for which it was hocked.
The collection is said to include a magnificent
tiara, a diamond necklace intertwined with pearls,
and earrings and pendants with a total estimated
value of $-400,000.
The jewels rest solidly in the vaults of the Bank
of Ireland, still as beautiful as they were before
twilight eclipsed the Russian royal family, claiming
their lives as well as their possessions.
The story of the jewels, now almost a legend
to those in Ireland who knew of the transaction,
has reached the public because of politics.
Ex-Premier Eamon de Valera. fighting for hi
political life, was forced to reveal that Russia had
never redeemed the jewels. They had been gi\en
to representatives of the Irish Republic in the
United States as security for a loan estimated at
between $8,000 and $10,000.
De Valera was answering Dr. Patrick MacCartan.
who opposed him in the Irish general elections early
this month. Only a handful of Irishmen, mostly
members of the old Irish Republican Brotherhood,
knew of the deal whereby a mission of the fledgling
Soviet Union received the dollars it wanted des
perately in exchange for the jewelry.
It was said that the collateral was valued at the
time of the transaction at around $400,000. While
the collection was not part of the crown jewels, it
had belonged to members of the Tsar's family.
The jewels reportedly were turned over to the
Irish mission in New York. De Valera was a member
of that mission. With the greatest of secrecy, the
jewels were smuggled into Ireland in upholsterec
furniture.
The most believable account of how the jewels
reached the government coffers was disclcsid b\
Mrs. Kathleen Roland O'Donavan, whose brother.
Harry Roland, was Ireland's representative in the
United States at that time. Boland reportedly was
the actual recipient of the Russian security. In 1922,
during the civil war. he was found mortally wound
ed in the Dublin mountains.
Brought to his mother's house, according to his
sister, the dying Boland directed that Jie jewels
should be held and entrusted to De Valera when :
returned to power, which he did in 1932.
LONDON (UP) —A detailed plan for a two billion
pound sterling ($8,000,000.00(1) state lottery to reduce

Union since 1920. tiny Ireland still holds a trove o:
Romanoff jewels worth an estimated 40 times the
amount for which it was hocked.
The collection is said to include a magnificent
tiara, a diamond necklace intertwined with pearls,
and earrings and pendants with a total estimated
value of $-400,000.
The jewels rest solidly in the vaults of the Bank
of Ireland, still as beautiful as they were before
twilight eclipsed the Russian royal family, claiming
their lives as well as their possessions.
The story of the jewels, now almost a legend
to those in Ireland who knew of the transaction,
has reached the public because of politics.
Ex-Premier Eamon de Valera. fighting for hi
political life, was forced to reveal that Russia had
never redeemed the jewels. They had been gi\en
to representatives of the Irish Republic in the
United States as security for a loan estimated at
between $8,000 and $10,000.
De Valera was answering Dr. Patrick MacCartan.
who opposed him in the Irish general elections early
this month. Only a handful of Irishmen, mostly
members of the old Irish Republican Brotherhood,
knew of the deal whereby a mission of the fledgling
Soviet Union received the dollars it wanted des
perately in exchange for the jewelry.
It was said that the collateral was valued at the
time of the transaction at around $400,000. While
the collection was not part of the crown jewels, it
had belonged to members of the Tsar's family.
The jewels reportedly were turned over to the
Irish mission in New York. De Valera was a member
of that mission. With the greatest of secrecy, the
jewels were smuggled into Ireland in upholsterec
furniture.
The most believable account of how the jewels
reached the government coffers was disclcsid b\
Mrs. Kathleen Roland O'Donavan, whose brother.
Harry Roland, was Ireland's representative in the
United States at that time. Boland reportedly was
the actual recipient of the Russian security. In 1922,
during the civil war. he was found mortally wound
ed in the Dublin mountains.
Brought to his mother's house, according to his
sister, the dying Boland directed that Jie jewels
should be held and entrusted to De Valera when :
returned to power, which he did in 1932.
LONDON (UP) —A detailed plan for a two billion
pound sterling ($8,000,000.00(1) state lottery to reduce
Britain's income tax and the national debt has been
submitted to the government and members of Par
liament.
Chief sponsor is Major Dennis Eric Smith, banker
and managing director of a London discount house.
His associates include E. P. Smith. Conservative
member of Parliament, and Godfrey Butler, brother
of the Earl of Carrick.
Announcement of the lottery plan aroused wide
spread interest, but it appeared unlikely that the
government would approve it.
, The sponsors suggested 2.000.000.000 one-pound
tickets be offered for sale through post offices, other
government departments, banks, insurance com
panies, stock brokers and other approved institu
tions to buyers anywhere in the world.
The proceeds would then be apportioned as fol
lows:
i' 1.000.000.000 in prizes.
£950.000.000 to the state, comprising £500.000.000
for the reduction of the national debt, t300.000.000
toward reduction of the present income tax of nine
shillings in the pound. £100.000.000 for the purchase
of more food from the Empire. £45.000,000 to aid the
elderly and the ill and £5.000.000 for medical research.
£50.000.000 would be for expenses, comprising £20.-
000.000 in sales commissions and £30.000.000 for or
ganization.
The sponsors made no specific proposals on the
amount of the individual prizes, but suggested there
should lie 100 first prizes. 100 second. 21)0 third and
so on down through 1,000,000 tenth prizes.
They said the amount diverted to the income tax
alone would enable its reduction by two shillings,
six-pense or three shillings on every pound (50 or
GO cents on every four dollars).
The lottery should be held once a year for three
or four years with the provision that it must be sanc
tioned each ve?r by Parliament, they said.
Britain has liad state lotteries off and on for
almost 500 yea's, the last on Oct. 18, 182f>. The first
was floated by Queen Elizabeth to obtain fluids to
Improve Britain's harbors and for other public works.
The first prize was listed as £3,000 iti cash, several
hundred pounds in silver and gold plate and "good
tapissarie meete for hangings and other covertures
and certain sortcs of good linen cloth."
