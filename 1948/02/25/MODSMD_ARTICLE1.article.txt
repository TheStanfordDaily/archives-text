# TUESDAY SERIES
## Jet Planes Undeveloped 
### 
It will be a good many years
before jet propulsion is applied
to commercial aircraft, predict
ed Dr. William F. Durand, pro
fessor of mechanical engineer
ing, in his Tuesday Evening
Series lecture last night.
Jet propulsion planes, he ex
plained, are built primarily for mili
tary purposes where high altitudes
and high speeds are most desired.
Commercial aircraft have little use
for these functions so far.
American research on jet propul
sion in aircraft, said Dr. Durand.
was begun in 1941, the year he was
called to Washington to become a
member of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics.
Despite several years oi inten
sive research many problems still
remain for the perfection of the jet
propulsion engine, Dr. Durand de
clared. Besides imperfections in the
engine turbine, turbine blades, and
shell, there is the problem of pro
ducing high fuel temperatures
which would result in the produc
tion of more energy and greater
speed.
At Moffett Field last Friday the
88-year-old professor was awarded
the Medal of Honor for his out
standing services to the American
war effort. General Carl Spaatz.
chief of staff of the U.S. Air Forces,
made the presentation on behalf of
President Truman.
Dr. Durand's address last night
was sponsored by Sigma Xi. na
tional honorary scientific society, of
which he is a charter member.
