# Your Address Is Now Just Stanford, Calif.
## 
### 
Use of "Stanford. California" as a
mailing address and not ''Stanford
University, California" was author
ized by the Post Office Department
last summer.
The change was made on account
of misrepresentation of the Univer
sity address for business purposes
by private individuals.
Freight address for Stanford still
is Palo Alto, with a Stanford sub
script.
