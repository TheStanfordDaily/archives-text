# Drastic Brownout Asked For Northern California
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24 (UP) â€”The California Public Utilities Com
mission today ordered a drastic "brownout" in Northern and Central
California that will curtail residential and industrial light and power by
10 percent and slash sports and decorative lighting by from 50 to 100
percent. The interim order handed down by the commission today after
public hearings on the drought-caused power shortage applies to the
seven major power utility companies in California from Bakersfield

north to the Oregon state border.
It becomes effective February 26.
The commission also asked for
adoption of daylight savings time for
the state.
WARTIME DIMOUT REVIVED
The commission rules for power
conservation will enforce a virtual
"wartime dimout" of industrial com
mercial lighting and power, curtail
ment of agricultural services and
cuts of 50 percent and more in night
sports floodlighting, including base
ball.
It bans outdoor lighting for bill
boards and show windows and cuts
deeply into all decorative and "non
essential" lighting, outdoors and in
doors.
Penalty for non-compliance is dis
continuance of all electrical service.
FARMERS VOICE VIEWS
Farmers from Central Valley, min
ing men, and businnessmen had
jammed the chambers at the State
building here to voice their views
before the emergency program, aim
ed at conserving dwindling water
and power reserves, was adopted.
O'Brien estimated the savings
from installation of daylight saving
time to be at least 136,000,000 kilo
watt hours in the area served by
the Pacific Gas & Electric company.
PG&E Spokesman Robert H.
Gerdes, general counsel, said the
company favored the proposals and
"wants to go along with them."
Southern California was not in
cluded in the edict because it gets
great reserve power from the Hoov
er dam. But Bruce Renwick, coun
sel for the Southern California Edi
son Company, put his company on
record as opposed to "voluntary ac
ceptance" of the plan.
