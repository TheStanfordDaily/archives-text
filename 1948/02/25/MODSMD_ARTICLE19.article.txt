LONDON. Feb. 24 (UP). —The
government today froze prices of
nearly every manufactured article

| restrict the profits of manufacturers,
I wholesalers, and retailers.
The decree was the most sweeping
! of its kind ever issued in this coun
i vry.
It fixes manufacturers' prices on
j products concerned at the level of
the lowest prices charged during
December and January.
Wholesalers and retailers ai*e re
| stricted to the price mark-ups of
December, or alternatively those in
a list issued by the Board of Trade,
! whichever is lowest.

CHICAGO. Feb. 24 (UP). —Hog
prices dropped sharply today for the
second day in a row, but the retail
food price decline showed signs of
leveling off. Most grain prices rose.
Meanwhile, the government began
a three-pronged investigation of last
week's steel price increases on in
structions from President Truman.
The Justice Department. Com
merce Department, and the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers
sought to determine if the big stee!
producers violated the anti - trust
laws and what effect the increases
would have on other steel product
costs.
