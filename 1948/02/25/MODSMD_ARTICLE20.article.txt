# U.S. Proposes Big Five Palestine Conferences; Death Toll Mounts in New Holy Land Clashes
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y., Feb. 24 (UP)— The
United States today proposed Big Five consul
tations on the security problem in Palestine, but
evaded the issue of whether American troops
would go to the Holy Land. American Delegate

Warren Austin, opening a momen-*
tous United Nations security coun
cil debate on the Palestine problem,
said the Big Five also should renew
negotiations with Palestine's Arabs
and Jews before considering whe
ther to send an international army
to Palestine.
The American plan, worded care
fully and sometimes vaguely, could
delay or change the entire UN plan
to partition Palestine into Jewish
and Arab states.
BRITISH DELAY
It coincided with authoritative re
ports that Great Britain is being
pressured to delay its departure
from Palestine. The British now are
scheduled to give up control of the
Holy Land May 15, and to have all
troops out by Aug. 1.
Austin was the first major speak
er as the UN security council took
up the Palestine commission report
asking for an international army to
enforce partition.
Austin said the security council's
job was not to enforce partition, but
simply to keep the peace. He said
the Big Five nations —the United
States, Russia, Great Britain. France
and China—should confer first on
whether the Palestine situation is
a threat to the peace.
IF FORCE NECESSARY
If the security council decides the
peace is threatened and force is the
only answer, Austin said, then the
United States will join additional Big
Five consultations on what to do. ,
But he made no other promises.
The statement generally disap
pointed Zionists who have demanded
that the United States take the lead
in forming an international army to
save partition and—they feel—the
prestige of UN.
British Colonial Secretary Arthur
Creech Jones warned anew that the
British plan to give up control of
Palestine May 15.

JERUSALEM, Palestine, Feb. 24 (UP)— Ten
persons were killed today in Palestine in clash
