## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”
The Senate tonight voted to extend
rent control until April 30. 1949.
The bill was approved shortly af
ter the House had rushed through a
stop - gap measure continuing the
present rent control law for one
month.
Both bills were passed by voice
vote, with little opposition.
Chairman Robert A. Taft, R., 0.,
of the Senate GOP Policy Commit
tee. predicted the Senate would
speedily approve the one-month ex
tension to prevent controls from
lapsing Sunday at midnight, when
the present law expires.
House Republican leaders prom
ised to act during the "month of

grace" on the Senate's long-range
extension bill, which would mean
that the nation would get a basic
new rent law probably late in
March.
Even though the temporary ex
tension gets through both Houses
ahead of the deadline, it still must
be signed by President Truman to
prevent nationwide lifting of ceil
ings on Monday. White House aide.-
were standing by\ to have the bill
flown to the Caribbean where Mr.
Truman is vacationing.
The Senate voted down a lone
string of proposed amendment?
which the Banking Committee
"handlers" of the bill said wouli"
tend to weaken controls.
