# State AVC Convention Opposes Marshall Plan
## 
### 
California's AVC chapters went on record as being opposed
to the Marshall Plan at the state convention held in Santa Barbara
last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
A state bonus for veterans, though opposed by the Stanford
chapter delegates, was also approved. The resolution proposed

a maximum of $(>OO to be paid by
the state to veterans who had en
tered the service from California.
Basis for opposition to the Mar
shall Plan was on two points:
1. The plan proposes unilateral
action and, by so doing, by-passes
UN.
2. Benefits of the plan should be
offered to all needy countries, large
or small, without regard for their
political systems.
Also passed by the convention
were:
LOW-COST HOUSING
1. Approval of an initiative cam
paign for low-cost rental housing in
the state.
2. A resolution calling for reap
portionment of the State Senate to
make it more closely proportional in
its representation.
3. A resolution opposing loyalty
checks of government employees
and calling for curbs on the activi
ties of the Tenney and Thomas in
vestigatory committees.
4. A resolution opposing univer
sal military training.
OPPOSE BONUS
The Stanford chapter, represented

by A! Baldwin, Ken Croft, Preston
I Burchard, Hal Gilliam, and Art Hil
labold, led the opposition to the
bonus resolution on the grounds
that such a program is a departure
from AVC's fundamental tenet of
no special privileges for the veteran.
Exponents of the bonus, however,
[ took the position that since the state
had done nothing to provide vcter
j ans with adequate housing or to
| keep prices within reasonable
bounds, veterans are in need of a
cost-of-living stabilizer.
