# Chimes Artist Bemoans Lack Of 'Play-Time'

### DEBBY WELLES 
To master a musical instrument
j without practice would be the dream
j of many grammar-school musicians.
| But James Lawson, University car
| iilonneur, wishes he could put in
an hour a day on the Hoover Li
brary's 35—bell carillon.
Instead of practicing on the bells,
which might disturb the students in
the library, Lawson may only sub
stilute a little time spent on the
piano and pipe organ. If errors
occur during one of his recitals, all
I he can do is cover the mistake
within the melody of the bells.
The carillon keyboard consists of
a series of wooden levers, connected
with the bells in the tower. A series
I of foot pedals produces the chords.
Lawson wears leather finger gloves
I and uses his fist to depress the
levers.
i THREE-OCTAVE RANGE
j Stanford's carillon bells range
■ from 1,.'>00 pounds to 10 pounds.
| They are chromatically tuned and
j have a range of three octaves.
In Indianapolis, Indiana, Lawson
| found "a carillon with a dummy
' keyboard attached to a xylophone
! like instrument. I detach the bells
and may practice as much as I
| wish."
Why did he begin playing the
| carillon? "Not because it did not
involve practice," Lawson said, but
I because he considers the carillon
the "exclamation point of bells, the
gayest and newest form of music
in this country. And certainly one
of the loudest!"
CARILLON SCHOOL
Lawson is planning to attend the
world's only carillon school in Bel
; gium next fall. He wants to acquire
some of the craftsman - knowledge
which Europe has to offer in his
:ield.
i Besides his inability to practice,
I Lawson has one other complaint to
offer: Pigeons have constant and
annoying access to the bells in the
tower. From this, the metal is be
: coming discolored.
Lawson hopes that some sympa
! thetic graduating class will donate
: the money for a pigeon fence to
keep the pigeons away from the
bells.
