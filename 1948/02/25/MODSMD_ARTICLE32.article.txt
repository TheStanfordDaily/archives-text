# Kaye Superb In Mitty Role; Thriller Flops
## 
### 
Stanford Theater's movie of
fering has quite a variety this
week. The two hours of "The
Secret Life of Walter Mitty"
were delightful; the two hours
of "Secret Beyond the Door"
were exquisite torture.
"Mitty," a technicolor Hollywood
ization of James Thurber's popular
short story, is an excellent vehicle
for Danny Kaye to exhibit his many
talents. He portrays Thurber's clay
dreaming hero, Walter Mitty, with
erent enthusiasm. The Goldwyn
girls make the scenery easy on the
eyes.
Kaye, of course, win:; the beauti
ful Virginia Mayo in the end, de
spite obstacles thrown in his way
by baddie Boris Karlofl' and the rest
of his sinister crew. This part of the
show represents the "plot."
Kaye fans will appreciate his
"Anatole of Paris." The dream se
quences are fine, but the "plot" gets
tiresome and slapstickish at. times.
' Secret Beyond the Door" is an
epic film that begins with "Walter
Wanger Presents" in big, bold let
ters. If you hit "Mitty" at the
wrong time and have to sit through
this "thing," he's the man to blame.
The film just goes to show that
anyone can give an expert psycho
analysis. Universal might turn out
better mysteries if they would take
the elementary psychology books
fiway from their writers, let them
out. of their individual cages, and
jive them their bottles back.
To make matters worse, there was
a small tot seated in front of me.
The poor dear nearly died when
Miss Bennett opened the door for
the first horrible time. To tell the
truth, the child must have wet her
diaper, because the picture certain
ly couldn't have smelled that bad.
