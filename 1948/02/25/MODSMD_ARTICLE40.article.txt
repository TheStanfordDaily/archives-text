Today's baseball contest be
tween the Stanford varsity and
the Boston Red Sox Rookies at
3:15 p.m. on the Sunken Dia
mond will have a decided major
league atmosphere.
Although neither Ted Williams,
Bobby Doerr, nor any other Bos
tonian will be in the lineup for the
visitors, many of these boys may
be the future Red Sox regulars or
members of their farm chain.
The rookies are managed by
Charles Walgren, a Sox scout in
this area. Most of his players are hot
prospects who are being given a
"look - see" by the Sox scouting
staff.
Hurling for the Indian varsity will
be newcomer Charlie Bell. The rest
of the lineup will remain the same
as in the last two games, with the
exception of the catching position.
Dave Barnes will handle Bell's
slants behind the plate today.
After the team took easy victories
from the Portola Natives and the
San Quentin nine. Coach Harry
Wolter was quite pleased at the
.showing made by his boys. He con
fined his praise to saying, "The team
looked a little better."
However. Coach Wolter has been
forced to take the bitter with the
sweet. Ace first-sucker Ben Cardi
nalli has been sidelined with a
painful ankle injury received in the
San Quentin fray. At last reports,
Cardinalli's ankle was either broken
or badly sprained.
Charlie "Yakima" Cole, who has
been handling the initial sack dur
ing the major portion of the last two
games, will offset Benny's loss to
some extent. There is no doubt,
though, that the big fellow's speed
and power will be missed.
Cole himself is fast and his hit
ting and fielding have been excel
lent.
The lineup and batting .order for
today's game will probably read like
vhis:
Ted Nell, cf; Chuck Cole, lb;
Clyde Dingfclder, if: Bobe Nava,
If; Buck Brow 11st>11, ss; Bill Arce,
:?l>: Bob Peters. 2b; Dave Barnes.

BUCK BROWNSON will bold
down the shortstop position for
Stanford when the varsity base
ball team tackles the Boston Red
Sox Rookies on the Sunken Dia
mond today at 3:15.
