# BITTNERS DISLODGED
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 24 (UP),
Denver's Nuggets dislodged the
Oakland Bittners from their season
long second-place slot in the Ameri
can Basketball League, as the most
important change in league statis
tics released by Commissioner Dave
Kelley here today.
But the Nuggets remain far ir
the rear of the leading Phillips Oil
ers of Bartlesville, Okla., and Oak
land's star center. Don Barksdale
still has a stranglehold on ABL in
dividual scoring honors. His 35'
points in 20 games yive the formei
UCLA Ail-American a 17-point leac
over Denver's Vince Boryla.
