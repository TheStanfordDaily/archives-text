# Varsity Cagers Begin Practice For Last USC-UCLA Series
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity basketballers last night started practice
again for their third straight weekend series with USC and
UCLA. The games will bp played Friday and Saturday nights
in the Pavilion.
Back from the Biltmore and their split series in Los Angeles,

the cagers are trying to figure out j
just what they do wrong against I
Sam Barry's Trojans. Stanford has 1
lost all three of its games against
USC, the last being Saturday night's
one-point affair that had the O'.ym- ;
pic Auditorium's capacity crowd
asking themselves "Just how lucky j
can these Trojans get?"
Sparked by Bill Rose's and lVlor
ley Thompson's aggressive tactics j
in the front defensive line, the In
dians came back from a 28 to 17
first-half score with a rush. Within ,
five minutes of the second-half tip- !
off, Stanford had scored 11 points
and was back in the ball game, 28 ;
to 28. j
IVERSON HITS BUCKET
But once the score was tied, the j
Tribe cooled off. Milt Iverson kept
things going with two baskets in i
the last minute, but by that time it \
was too late.
Stanford had a much easier time !
with UCLA. The Bruins seemed to |
be more interested in throwing el- J
bows and in looking tough than they j
were in making baskets, as the In- j
dians grabbed their second straight
win from them.
The Cards remain in the confer- i
ence cellar along side of UCLA. !
This weekend they will have their
final chance against USC. and if
they muff that on Friday night, they
will be battling UCLA on Saturday
night for third-place honors. The
laser will become cellar champ.
THREE CLOSE GAMES
USC has improved with every !
game, but Stanford is capable of
beating them on a good night. All
three of their games have been
close. Bill Sharman has been the
big point-maker, but it has been the '

backboard play of Alex Hannum,
Earl Wallis, and Fred Bertram that
has bothered Stanford.
Alex Hannum, Troy's ace center,
has been efficient in holding Bill
Stephenson to low scores in their
three meetings. It will be close be
tween these two for all-conference
selection, and Friday night will be
the last time that they will oppose
each other.
Babe Higgins turned in two good
games in the South and impressed
the Los Angeles sports scribes
greatly. The Babe is a great ball
handler besides being an excellent
shot, and he rates with Andy Wolfe
as being the coolest player in the
league. Higgins is certain to secure
an all-conference rating, either at
forward or guard.
ROSE SCORES 15
Bill Rose's return to scoring form
was a welcome sight. The Red
Rose bounced nil 15 points against
UCLA. He will be counted upon
heavily when the Tribe tries to
break the USC jinx this weekend.
The squad is still at full strength,
having survived its trip without any
injuries. Practice tonight will be
the most strenuous of the week, as
tomorrow they will begin to ease up
for the weekend games.
