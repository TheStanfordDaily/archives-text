## MERMEN OC To Clash With Varsity 
### 
Stanford's swimming varsity will
make another away - from - home
performance this week when they
meet the San Francisco Olympic
Club team Friday night in the
Winged "O" pool.
With such outstanding former
Stanford swimmers as Fred Taioli.
A 1 Weeden, and Em Cashin swim
ming for the Club squad, the Farm
team's record of 24 consecutive dual
meet victories might well fall at
the hands of those who helped to
make it.
Last season, the Indians won eas
ily from the Clubbers.' But the ad
dition of Taioli, Weeden. and Cashin
to the Olympic Club team could
prove to be the difference between
the two teams.
Regardless of the outcome, all in
dications point to the contest as be
ing the top meet of the Bay Area
swimming season.
