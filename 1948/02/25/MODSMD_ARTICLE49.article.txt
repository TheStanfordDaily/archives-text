## 
### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 24 (UP).â€”The
New York Yankees paid heavily
today to get the starting pitcher
they hope will help them to their
second straight pennant. They gave
up a capable catcher. Aaron Robin
son. and two good rookie hurlers for
southpaw Ed Lopat. ace of the Chi
cago White Sox mound staff.
It was a straight player deal and
General Manager George Weiss
made it plain that it was negotiated
as a counter to the heavily rein
forced Boston Red Sox. who have
become off-season pennant favor
ites since acquiring star players
from the St, Louis Browns.
