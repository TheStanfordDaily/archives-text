## Scorched Earth 
### 
Stanford residents today are being asked to support a vol
untary water rationing plan. The fact that the plan is to be
voluntary does not mean, however, that the water shortage
here is not yet acute. Santa Clara County is included in the
California area designated as being in a state of drought.
Stanford's situation is even more serious. Few residents
realize that the University has a dual water system. Cue set
of pipes supplies domestic water from wells. Another supplies
irrigation water from Felt and Searsville Lakes. While domestic
water is not terribly short, irrigation water is.
In figures the situation is like this:
Felt and Searsville Lakes now have a total of 150,C00,C0C
gallons of water. Of this amount a reserve of IOO.QGO.OCO gal
lons must be kept for fire fighting. Against this short suppiy
can be measured consumption of 170,000,000 gallons last June,
July and August.
That is why the University must have wholehearted cooper
ation when it asks residents not to wash cars and to water gar
dens and lawns only at designated hours.
To help the situation the University is digging two wells, one
of them 1,000 feet deep. An attempt will be made to turn one well
into both the domestic and irrigation systems. More domestic
water can be obtained from Hetch Hetchy—if needed.
But to keep the Farm from becoming a scorched earth, irri
gation water must be conserved. Otherwise the golf course and
campus lawns will wither, necessitating re-seeding. For, when
the water is gone, there won'J be any more unless it rains
like it did for Noah.—T. S.
