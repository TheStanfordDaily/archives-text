## German Reparations 
### 
To the Editor:
Prof. Harris, in his Tuesday evening lecture, assumed that Germany
is economically unable to pay reparations. That is not so. Germany
spent approximately 50 billon dollars a year on the war. The
reparations figure to all countries, East and West, proposed by Russia,
is 20 billion, of which the West is to get half. These reparations represent
one-tenth of the actual damage done by Germany in. its effort to reduce
the rest of Europe to a more-or-less agricultural series of colonies, by
removing, destroying, or failing to maintain the industries of the coun
tries occupied by Hitler. Further, the Russions propose that the repara
tions be paid over a period of 20 years, or one billion dollars worth per
year. This is one-fiftieth of what Hitler Germany spent on war each
year. In view of the report ot official American damage evaluation com
missions, that the percentage of destruction of German industry is slight,
it is obvious that Germany can pay.
After World War I, Germany paid very much larger reparations than
it has thus far. Those reparations payments actually served to make
possible the recovery of peace-time industry, for they served as a marke'..
A private enterprise economy flourishes only when it has markets, re
gardless of their nature. At present, western Germany industry has
shown the slowest rate of recovery of any country in the world, except
Japan. Reparations from current production would stimulate it.and
would win this country the good-will not only of the Russians but of
the French, whose industry is throttling for want of Ruhr coal.
