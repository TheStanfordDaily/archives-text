To the Editor:
George Brunn's Wednesday column on China makes use of the tern-,
"so-called communists" in referring to the Chinese Communists. Mr
Brunn evidently would have us believe that they are merely agrarian
reformers. Perhaps he is not acquainted with die history of this move
ment.
The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921, with the help ot
Russian agents. Most of its leaders have received training in Russia
American communists Eavl Browder and Eugene Dennis made visit*
and gave advice. The National Congress of the Chinese Communis':
Party has met in Moscow. Throughout its history, the Chinese Commun
ists have followed every twist and turn of Soviet policy.
Mr. Brunn calls the Democratic League a middle-of-the-road party.
It is certainly no such thing today. Its recent activities in behalf ot
the communists went so far as to incite rebellion against the national
government, and for 'hat reason it was outlawed
Previously, two of the largest parties which made up the Democratic
League had pulled out. They are the Social Democratic Party and the
Young China Party. These two parties, together with the independents
and the majority Kuomintang, support China's new constitution, and
took part in the recent national elections. This constitution was praised
by General Marshall, and is now being put into effect, despite the oppo
sition of the communists.
