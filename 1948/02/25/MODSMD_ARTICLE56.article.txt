## HISTORY 1948 
### 
Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of
Independence that "all men are created equal." The
words never meant that all men were equal in
intellifence, physical strength, or character. They
meant that men were equal before the law. They
have come to mean even more: that men are equal
in dignity and integrity.

Our predecessors did not live up to what they
said. Some of them were slaveholders—and slaves
were not treated as men or as equals. We are not
living up to what is said now, and we all know
it only two well.

Minorities, in particular Negro minorities, are
disfranchised, denied civil rights, and subjected to
cruel and unusual punishments for crimes of which
they have not been duly convicted. Discriminations
that are unconstitutional, illegal, and contrary to
American traditions prevail even in the District of

Columbia which is under the
Federal rule.
True, there has been many rec
ommendations i'or improvement
proposed, but very few get
through Congress because the
filibuster is permitted in the
Senate. In the case of the poll tax
and in the case of any attempt to
pass a national Fair Employment
Practices Act, the "right" to fili
buster may prevail over equality
before the law and equality of
opportunity.

We may even question whether equal rights—
equality in employment, education, health and med
ical servces, and equality in public accommodations
where segregation is enforced — can be made real
by any law in some communities.
The ignorant must be taught. But we have made
some progress: in the armed services, in labor un
ions, in laws in Northern states, and in fairer and
more liberal treatment of the negro Amriecan in
various Southern states.
But we can make more progress, in which the
Federal Government, representing the whole people,
must take increased responsibility. As some reports
of the President's Committee on Civil Rights put it,
"We can make defense of the individual's dignity
and integrity an organized function of the Depart
ment of Justice, of committees in Congress, and ot
a standing executive commission."
We do not need new tradition, and we do not
need to go beyond Jefferson's noble words. What
we do need, thought, is to accept in fullness that
men should not be discriminated against for race,
religion, or belief.
We owe this not only to ourselves, individually
and colectively, but also to our position in the
world. Believe me, the United States is not so strong
and the final triumphy of the democratic ideal sc
inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks
of us and our record.

must take increased responsibility. As some reports
of the President's Committee on Civil Rights put it,
"We can make defense of the individual's dignity
and integrity an organized function of the Depart
ment of Justice, of committees in Congress, and ot
a standing executive commission."
We do not need new tradition, and we do not
need to go beyond Jefferson's noble words. What
we do need, thought, is to accept in fullness that
men should not be discriminated against for race,
religion, or belief.
We owe this not only to ourselves, individually
and colectively, but also to our position in the
world. Believe me, the United States is not so strong
and the final triumphy of the democratic ideal sc
inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks
of us and our record.

Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of
Independence that "all men are created equal." The
words never meant that all men were equal in
intellifence, physical strength, or character. They
meant that men were equal before the law. They
have come to mean even more: that men are equal
in dignity and integrity.

Our predecessors did not live up to what they
said. Some of them were slaveholders—and slaves
were not treated as men or as equals. We are not
living up to what is said now, and we all know
it only two well.

Minorities, in particular Negro minorities, are
disfranchised, denied civil rights, and subjected to
cruel and unusual punishments for crimes of which
they have not been duly convicted. Discriminations
that are unconstitutional, illegal, and contrary to
American traditions prevail even in the District of

Columbia which is under the
Federal rule.
True, there has been many rec
ommendations i'or improvement
proposed, but very few get
through Congress because the
filibuster is permitted in the
Senate. In the case of the poll tax
and in the case of any attempt to
pass a national Fair Employment
Practices Act, the "right" to fili
buster may prevail over equality
before the law and equality of
opportunity.

We may even question whether equal rights—
equality in employment, education, health and med
ical servces, and equality in public accommodations
where segregation is enforced — can be made real
by any law in some communities.
The ignorant must be taught. But we have made
some progress: in the armed services, in labor un
ions, in laws in Northern states, and in fairer and
more liberal treatment of the negro Amriecan in
various Southern states.
But we can make more progress, in which the
Federal Government, representing the whole people,
must take increased responsibility. As some reports
of the President's Committee on Civil Rights put it,
"We can make defense of the individual's dignity
and integrity an organized function of the Depart
ment of Justice, of committees in Congress, and ot
a standing executive commission."
