WASHINGTON (UP)—The Air Transport Com
mand, globe-covering arm of the Air Force, is ex
panding its facilities in the two key world trouble
spots, the Mediterranean and the Arctic.
The big transport planes of the Air Force have
added Athens, Greece, and Ankara. Turkey, to their
list of stops. That is a direct lesult of the 5400.-
000.000 Greek-Turkish Aid Program.
Still a second Mediterranean expansion is plan
ned that wi4l give the Air Transport Command a
shortcut to the Mediterranean political hot-bed.
Planes will fly from the United States to Bermuda,
the Azores, Port Lyautey in French Morocco, and
Wheelus Field, outside Tripoli.
From Wheelus Field they can branch off to Ath
ens. Rome, Ankara. Cairo. Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
and other points in the near East. That will avoid
sending- plar.e> the long route through Europe as
they now travel.
The new route also is expected to provide an
ideal one for possible ferrying of planes to be turned
over to the Greeks and Turks under the Greek-
Turkish aid program. The Air Force has re-surfaced
Ave fle'.ds in Greece. It has turned over a few
trainers and transports to the Greeks but so far no
combat planes have gone to them.
The Turks also are expected to get some surplus
American planes left over from World War 11. The
Air Transport Command expansion in the Arctic
has been extensive. Its planes now fly from West
over Field. Mass.. to Ottawa and Fort Churchill.
Canada, lioose Bay. Labrador, and remote Air
Force posts in Greenland, stretching as far north as
Thule, Eureka Sound and Resolution Bay.
The ATC lines in Alaska, preparing for a 5140.-
000,000 airfield expansion program there, have been
extended. New points added are Norman Wells,
Sawmill Bay, Cambridge and Kittigazuit. The ATC
began last summer a Great Circle air run from
Seattle to Tokyo via Anchorage and Shemya in
the Aleutians.
The ATC is America's largest global air line. It
carried 133,000,000 toil miles of cargo and flew 500.-
000,000 passenger miles in 11)47 without a passenger
fatality «n regular scheduled flflights. It already
has begun replacing its aging C-47 and C-.i4 war
time transports with the modern C-07 Boeing Strato
freighter and the C-74 Globemaster. known
in commercial fields as the DC-7.
Its flights across the Atlantic daily carry passen
gers ar.d freight to Frankfurt. Germany, via Steph
ensville, Newfoundland, the Azores and even Meeks
Field. Iceland. There is a Caribbean run that stretch
es as far as Panama and British Guiana.
The central Pacific route connects Fairfield-Sui
sin, Cal., with Honolulu. Johnston Island. Kwajalein.
Guam. Manila, ■Okinawa. Shanghai. Iwo Jima and
Tokyo.

WASHINGTON (UP)—The Air Transport Com
mand, globe-covering arm of the Air Force, is ex
panding its facilities in the two key world trouble
spots, the Mediterranean and the Arctic.
The big transport planes of the Air Force have
added Athens, Greece, and Ankara. Turkey, to their
list of stops. That is a direct lesult of the 5400.-
000.000 Greek-Turkish Aid Program.
Still a second Mediterranean expansion is plan
ned that wi4l give the Air Transport Command a
shortcut to the Mediterranean political hot-bed.
Planes will fly from the United States to Bermuda,
the Azores, Port Lyautey in French Morocco, and
Wheelus Field, outside Tripoli.
From Wheelus Field they can branch off to Ath
ens. Rome, Ankara. Cairo. Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
and other points in the near East. That will avoid
sending- plar.e> the long route through Europe as
they now travel.
The new route also is expected to provide an
ideal one for possible ferrying of planes to be turned
over to the Greeks and Turks under the Greek-
Turkish aid program. The Air Force has re-surfaced
Ave fle'.ds in Greece. It has turned over a few
trainers and transports to the Greeks but so far no
combat planes have gone to them.
The Turks also are expected to get some surplus
American planes left over from World War 11. The
Air Transport Command expansion in the Arctic
has been extensive. Its planes now fly from West
over Field. Mass.. to Ottawa and Fort Churchill.
Canada, lioose Bay. Labrador, and remote Air
Force posts in Greenland, stretching as far north as
Thule, Eureka Sound and Resolution Bay.
The ATC lines in Alaska, preparing for a 5140.-
000,000 airfield expansion program there, have been
extended. New points added are Norman Wells,
Sawmill Bay, Cambridge and Kittigazuit. The ATC
began last summer a Great Circle air run from
Seattle to Tokyo via Anchorage and Shemya in
the Aleutians.
The ATC is America's largest global air line. It
carried 133,000,000 toil miles of cargo and flew 500.-
000,000 passenger miles in 11)47 without a passenger
fatality «n regular scheduled flflights. It already
has begun replacing its aging C-47 and C-.i4 war
time transports with the modern C-07 Boeing Strato
freighter and the C-74 Globemaster. known
in commercial fields as the DC-7.
Its flights across the Atlantic daily carry passen
gers ar.d freight to Frankfurt. Germany, via Steph
ensville, Newfoundland, the Azores and even Meeks
Field. Iceland. There is a Caribbean run that stretch
es as far as Panama and British Guiana.
