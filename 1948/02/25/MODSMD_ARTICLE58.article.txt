SACRAMENTO ((UP) —Prohibition in California
v.-culd result in a "tremendous" loss of revenue, un
employment, a devaluation of real estate and "vir
tual ruin" of California's agriculture, an assembly
sub-committee or. public morals reported today.
The preliminary report, signed by Assemblymen
Car! Fletcher, D., Long Beach, and Lester A. Mc-
Millan, D., Los Angeles. was approved by the full
public morals committee, headed by John F. Thomp
son, R., San Jose. t
The report pointed out that revenue losses would
be felt by the federal ogvernment and the various
county and city governments as well as the state.
Some 830,000 persons employed in the liquor in
dustry throughout the :> te would Ik 1 thrown out
ot" their jobs if prohibition were introduced, the
sub-committee .stated. Real estate holding would

be devaluated, the report said, endangering the
investments of hundreds of thousand of citizens.
The report declared prohibition "would bring
virtual ruin to California agriculture." "California
vineyards would be uprooted. Our hop growers
would find a diminishing market for their crops."
the report stated.
The sub-committee recommended, however, thai
the legislature forbid the serving of liquor to un
escorted women. It asked also that legislation "clear
ly defining" food serving requirements for bars
provided in the state constitution be enacted. Also
recommended was a law to require local govern
ments to issue entertainment permits to taverns
providing music or entertainment "of any nature."
The sub-committee reported that intensive in
vestigations in southern California found cases where
individual taverns were being operated 'frith "<S
disregard of public welfare and morals." It specific
ally attacked "certain establishments" in the Holly
wood "strip" area which it accused of "staging inde
cent. lewd and lascivious entertainment and in
which tavern managements were permitting their
premises to be used as the gathering place for per
verts and other immoral persons."
"We are loath to believe." the committee stated,
"that the mere sale and consumption of alcoholic
beverages, in itself, was immoral or that the con
sumption of spirits in well-conducted premises did
result in the breakdown of the morals of our citizens."
WASHINGTON. D.C.—The weather man has
pulled a "swap" on Europe and North America it*,
serving up winter this year. Last year he subjected
the Old World to an unmerciful buffeting. Thi.-
season he seems to be making amends by switching
the worst of his icy fury to the western side of thv
Atlantic.
The blazing sun at St. Moritz, Switzerland, push
ed the early February thermometer to 50 degrees.
Turning skating rinks into pools, it put the Winter
Olympic games not "on ice." but off. The unseas
onable mildness was one small sample of how Eur
ope and North America have traded their winter
weather of a year ago. notes the National Geographic
Society.
Cold. snow, sleet, and finally hurricane in 1940--17
added up to one of the Old World's hardest winters
ol the 20th century. When peak production wa
most sorely needed in the war-torn lands, trans
portation was paralyzed by the succession of bliz
zards. Milk, coal. gas. oil, and electricity supplies
failed.
February cost Great Britain alone more than
5300.000.000 in storm-lost production. London and
Paris took worse weather than New York has had
so far this winter. It kept coming right to the Ides
of March when the hurricane pulled the Thames
River to its highest flood stage since 1894.
Toulouse and other cities in southern France in
late January 1947 registered their lowest tempera
tures for a century. A year later to the day, snow
clad Atlanta and Mobile matched cold with Fair
banks. Alaska, briefly in the grip of a "heat wave.'
The present winter to mid-February in Great Bri
tain and western Europe has averaged five or six
degrees warmer than the same period last year
Snow and -sub-freezing temperatures have beer,
rare. Spring flowers have been deceived to the
point of blooming.
But meanwhile in the U.S. near-record cold ha*
been striking Maine. North Dakota, and other bor
der states. The country's record low, minus 06 de
grees, dates hack to February 1933, at Yellowstone
Park. It compares with SI below for the Cauadiau
Yukon, and !M below claimed for eastern Siberia.
