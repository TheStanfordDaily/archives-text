Stanford's American Ked Cross drive has been extended through
Friday in an effort to meet the campus' quota of $5,000.
Donations during the regularly-scheduled drive days totaled only
$1!.51>4.54—81,465.46 short of the goal.
Women's living groups accounted for the major portion of donations,
giving $1,082.21. Fraternities gave $ti9i>.47; Village residents, S(>t»(i.(!0:
Men's dormitories, $450. The balance consists of off-campus and other
contributions.
Red Cross living groups representatives are asked to contact for
donations all those who have not previously contributed. In addition,
contributions will be accepted at tlie ASSI' office throughout the week.
"It is not a good (joint in Stanford's record that it is necessary to extend
our Red Cross drive to meet the quota," stated Diana Powers, head of
the campus drive.
"And the quota is not at all unreasonable," continued .Miss Powers.
"After all, $5,01)0 divided up between 8.000 students amounts to less than
65 cents a person. Surely all of us can afford to give at least that much
of our cigarette money to the Red Cross."
