# Drastic Power Cut Effective at Midnight
## Wartime Dimout Goes into Effect 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25 (UP).
—California returns to its wartime
lighting dimout at midnight tonight
to conserve electric power.
Forced by the worst winter
drought emergency in the state's
history, a drastic electricity curtail
ment will shut off outdoor lighting
and reduce power consumption from
the Oregon border to the Tehachapi
Mountains.
An estimated 3.500,000 persons
will be affected.
Only Southern California will be
exempted from the brownout. Hoo
ver Dam supplies power to the re
gion south of the Tehachapis.
CONSERVE POWER
The brownout was ordered by the
State Public Utilities Commission,
after a one-dav hearing, to conserve
dwindling power and water re
sources. It will continue until rains
—possibly in the autumn —end the
emergency.
Under the order, a 10 per cent cut
in the use of electricity by farmers,
industry, and commercial users will
be enforced by seven Northern and
Central California power companies.
Outdoor lighting is banned, except
theater marquees. Floodlighting of
outdoor sports events must be re
duced 50 per cent.
The order will triple the electric
clock "slow-down" already effec
tive in the drought - stricken area.
Most electric clocks will lose from
12 to 15 minutes per day under the
new frequency.
LITTLE PROSPECT OF RAIN
The prospect of rains which would
ease the brownout—and the agri
cultural emergency—is slight, State
Agricultural Director A. A. Brock
said.
"Even if rainfall should be normal
the rest of the year," he said, "the
chances of developing grain crops in
California's central valleys have
been killed by the dry spell."
Meanwhile, the Utilities Commis
sion urged adoption of daylight sav
ing time —from April 30 to Sept. 30
—as another measure to save elec
tricity. State Sen. Gerald O'Gara
said he would introduce a bill for
daylight saving when the Legisla
ture meets March 1.
