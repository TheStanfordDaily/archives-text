PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Feb. 25 (UP) —Police fired on pro
testing students in Central Prague today shortly after President
Eduard Benes, giving in to leftist pressure, accepted a new cab
inet dictated by communist Premier Klement Gottwald.
Gotiwald completed a lightning coup by forcing Benes to

accept his new cabinet or face a
paralyzing general strike.
Tonight the Reds were in control
of every phase of the national life.
Press, radio, communications, "gov
ernment departments, and city of
ficials were dismissed en mass. There
were numerous arrests in Slovakia
on charges of plotting in concert with
two "western powers"—presumably
the United States and Great Britain
STUDENTS WOUNDED
At least two students were wound -
ed by police, eye-witnesses said,
when police fired on them as the.,
tried to march to Benes' castle to
protest against the communist coup.
Others were beaten with rifle butt..-,
and clubs in the street and in police
stations.
The students alone had dared t.:
make an open protest against th-?
taking over of the country by the
communists.
The communists swiftly organized
a new "Prague Workers' Militia"
under Commander-in-Chief Josef
Pavel. Thousands of them, armed
with newly issued rifles, started
marching through the streets of the
capital at dusk four abreast, in mil
itary formation, with bands.
Premier Gotcwald announced to
a cheering throng in Wenceslaus
Square that Benes. reported to be
exhausted and ill after the collapse
of the coalition government for
which he had fought, had given in
The crisis which resulted in the
communist coup was caused by the
resignation of the national social

bers of these parties in the new
party are those who chose to travel
as fellows of the communists.
ONLY PROTEST
From the students came the only
open protest against the communist
coup which aligned Czechoslovakia
fully with the other countries of
Europe behind the Iron Curtain.
Seven thousand of them tried to
march to President Ber.es' castle.
Most were from Charles University
whose students had demonstrated
in the days of the Autro-HungariatT.
empire and against the Nazis.
Benes wrote a letter yesterday,
protesting against any attempt to
end parliamentary and democratic
government. It was withheld from
publication, presumably by the left
ists, until Gottwald had time to an
