# Meyers Trial Witness Held in Hotel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UP)â€”
Major Gen. Bennett E. Meyers' sub
ornation of perjury trial almost
broke up in a mistrial today when
the prosecution informed the jury
that one of its key witnesses was
being held in a Washington hotel
room "for protection."
The "protected" witness was Miss
June Ballou, a pretty, blue-eyed
stenographer whom the government
had called to back up its charge
that Meyers secretly owned a war
contracting firm while he was a
top purchasing officer for the Army
Air Force.

The incident occurred toward the
end of the session, during which two
government witnesses put the finger
on Meyers as the secret wartime
owner of the Aviation Electric Corp.,
Vandalia, Ohio.
Meyers at the time was the air
force's number two procurement
officer, and he denied to a senate
war investigating committee that he
ever profited from Aviation Electric's
war work.
He is accused of inducing Bleriot
H. LaMarre, $50-a-week "dummy"
president of Aviation Electric, to lie
to the Senate committee.
