# Solons Pass Rent Law
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25 (UP)â€”
Congress today completed action on
a stop-gap bill continuing rent con
trols until April 1, and Republican
leaders predicted that a 14-month
extension law would be enacted
before it expires.
The Senate unanimously approved
the temporary extension and sent it
to the White House where it will
be relayed to President Truman,
now in the Caribbean. He is expect
ed to sign it immediately since the
present rent law expires at midnight
Sunday.
The Senate last night approved
its version of the 14-month exten
sion and Chairman Jesse P. Wolcott,
R., Mich., of the House banking
committee, said the lower chamber
probably would approve it without
"too much more in the way of de
control."
The Senate bill would extend con
trols until April 30, 1949; continue
ceilings until then for tenants who
already have agreed to "voluntary"
15 per cent increase; permit boosts
up to 15 per cent for all other ten
ants if their leases run through 1949;
decontrol rented rooms in private
homes, and extend veterans' bene
fits through May 1. 1949.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0., told
the Senate he had been assured the
House would proceed immediately
with the bill. He said he hoped to
"have the law enacted long before
the end of March."
Senate Democratic Leader Alben
W. Barkley, D., Ky.. said it was "ex
tremely unfortunate" that perm
anent legislation could not have
been completed by the Sunday dead
line.
