# New Indian Constitution Includes Democratic Rule

### 
NEW DELHI. India, Thursday, Feb. 26 (UP)—Lawmakers un
veiled a constitution for India today. It would pledge the gov
ernment to end the ancient caste system and free
people from the evils of poverty and religious oppression.
The 350-page draft needs only the approval of the constituent

assembly to proclaim India a "sov- ■»
ereign democratic republic," with
a federated government modeled
after that of the United States and
promising the same fundamental
rights to its hybrid population.
But the lawmakers said that time
alone would determine whether
these guarantees could be fulfilled,
whether India's teeming, uneducated
masses will drop their suspicions i
and hatreds and accept legal prin- j
ciples of freedom.
GANDHI HOPES REALIZED
It the constitution can be made to
work, the lawmakers said, India i
would have come a long way toward
realizing the hopes of the martyred
saint, Mohandas Iv. Gandhi.
It calls for universal suffrage for
all men and women over 21 and a
president-premier-parliament rela
tionship which combines elements of
the British and American political
systems. It orders the government
to provide within 10 years free and
compulsory education for all persons j
until they are 14 years of age.
It would outlaw the ancient cus
tom of untouchability, which bars
nearly G0,000,000 low-caste Hindus
from society and condemns them ;
and their children to do the same
menial tasks performed by their j
forefathers for thousands of years.
Under the constitution, anyone
who forced an untouchable to ob
serve these penalties would be pun
ishable by law.

The proposed new constitution al- !
so calls for:
1. A bill of fundamental rights,
