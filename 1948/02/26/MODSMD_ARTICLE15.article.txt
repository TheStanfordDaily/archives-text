# Arabs Will Fight UN Palestine Partition
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Feb. 25 (UP).—Egypt warned the United
Nations Security Council today that the Arab world will fight
every UN attempt to enforce the partition of Palestine.
Egypt told the Council that Palestine Arabs will turn their
"fury" on any international army which UN might form. Arabs

from surrounding countries, said I
Egypt, will rush to the rescue of the
Palestine Arabs.
"Persistence in implementing the j
Assembly's resolution will head j
matters to certain disaster," said I
Egypt's Mahmoud Bey Fawzi.
Fawzi said that so far Arab slates
have not intervened in Palestine i
fighting, and that Arabs generally j
have shown great restraint in meet- ;
ing the "invading majority." He ;
added, however, that the trend to- j
ward Jewish dominance in Pales- ,
tine could not continue.
He spoke immediately after the j
United States offered a formal reso
lution to carry out its program for |
Bis? Five consultations on the Pal
estine problem, and the possible use
of an international army to split the
Holy Land into Jewish and Arab J
states.
The resolution called on the Big
Five powers to make recommenda- i
tions "as a matter of urgency." This !
new note of speed was injected into ]
the formal plan, which counters a j
Colombian proposal for delay and j
possible revision of the whole par- j
tition scheme.
The American resolution asked
the Security Council to set up a |
special committee composed of the j
Big Five powers—the United States, j
Russia, Great Britain, France, and i
China. The functions of the com- !
mittee would be to:
1. Keep the Security Council in
formed of the situation in Palestine, i
and suggest what instructions the j
Council could give to the five-mem- i
ber UN Palestine Commission, j

which is charged with administer
ing partition.
2. Study "whether the Palestine
situation constitutes a threat to in
ternational peace and security, and
to report its conclusions as a mat
ter of urgency to the Council, to
gether with any recommendations
for actions by the Security Council."
3. Consult the Palestine Commis
sion, Great Britain, and Palestine
Arabs and Jews about the carrying
out of partition.
