Shall we educate for peace or for i
I war?
In the opinion of Dr. Paul Hanna
I of the School of Education it is nec
j essary to do both. Dr. Hanna gave
j his views when he was guest editor
of a special education issue (winter
1948) of Air Affairs, an international
j quarterly journal published in
: Washington, D C.
I "Schools and colleges must do
| everything to build the physical,
! intellectual, and normal strength

which will discourage potential ag
gressors; but," he added, "should
there be another war, the schools
and colleges must have contributed
to building sufficient physical power
to win that war and preserve rep
resentative democracy."
Schools and colleges, Dr. Hanna
said, must clarify the concept of
democracy, and teach all its basic
truths.
"Schools and colleges foster the
concepts of one-world community
with representative democratic go
vernment," he said.
Dr. James Quillen of the School of
Education was among the group
of 20 leading educators who wrote
in a recent issue of Air Affairs on
the force aviation has had on educa
tion. He has stressed their independ
ency in the modern world.
