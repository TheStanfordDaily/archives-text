# Brandin Urges Voluntary Ration
## 
### 
In an appeal yesterday morning
directed at all Stanford students and
faculty members, A 1 Brandin, bus
iness manager, urged "the voluntary
cutting of all unnecessary lighting."
Complying with the recent PG&E
dictum to '"cut down on Northern
California's electrical consumption
by 10 per cent," Brandin said that
all campus living groups will be
asked to ''turn out all lights when
not in vise."
The business manager made it
clear that, in his opinion, the PG&E
has the legal right to enforce the 10
per cent cut in those places where
it is not observed.
''It is also my belief." Brandin
said, "that the Stanford campus can.
purely by voluntary compliance on
the part of its inhabitants, make
good the proposed cut."
Brandin concluded his statement:
"It is a bothersome thing to be
forced to submit to lighting regula
tions: but these drastic steps will
have to be taken if no voluntary re
sponse is forthcoming."
