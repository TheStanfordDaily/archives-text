# Mineral Sciences Will Display Tools
## 
### 
Tools of the mineral scientists—
$100,000 worth of them — will be
shown at the School of Mineral Sci
ences' first "birthday" open house,
today from 4 to 9 p.m., Dean A, I.
Levorsen announced.
Stanford's 11th school, combining
the geology and mining engineering
departments, established last year,
plans to show its metallograph, for
photographing polished surfaces; its
X-ray that probes inner rock se
crets; a diamond saw for sawing
hard rocks, and other geological
science tools.
Visitors will see the school's shell
collection, one of the finest, where
displays range from tiny gem-like
shells to the 400-pound "homes" of
giant clams. Petroleum tests will
be run in the petroleum laboratory,
and assa\ - furnaces will be in op
eration in the metallurgy depart
ment.
Tea will be served in a setting
flanked by fossil coral and other ex
hibits.
A complete collection of Western
fossils, map exhibits, and topograph
ical models will also be on display.
Faculty members and student
guides will be on hand to operate
the items of technical equipment
and to demonstrate their uses.
