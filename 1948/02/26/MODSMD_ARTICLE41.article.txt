# Varsity Cagers Get Last Shot at Troy tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's next-to-last weekend of basketball will open to
morrow night when the Indian five takes on USC at the Pa
vilion. Saturday night Stanford will meet UCLA.
Meanwhile at Berkeley, California, which has the southern
division title all stowed away, will be playing the southern

schools in reverse order. The Tro
jans and Bruin games will be Stan
ford's big chance to get out of the
conference cellar.
The Indians have had nothing but
misery from Southern Cal, losing all
three of their games to Sam Berry's
club. The last two defeats have been
heartbreakers. In both games Stan
ford scored two more field goals
than the Trojans and lost on the
foul line.
TROJANS' COUSINS?
Coach Everett Dean said yester
day. "We're tired of being cousins
for USC." And the team, in its best
physical condition of the year, is
working hard this week to try to
salvage something from a disap
pointing season.
Friday night's game will also
feature the last round in the duel
between Stanlord's Steve Stephen
son and the Trojans' Alex Hannum,
the two outstanding centers of the
southern division. In their three
previous meetings, it must' be ad
mitted that Steve has come out sec
ond best to the six-foot-six Hannum.
UCLANS NEXT
Stanford has had somewhat better
luck against its Saturday night op
ponent, winning two out of three
games from the Bruins. UCLA's fast
breaking offense has not bothered
the Indians nearly as much as USC's
slow, tantalizing style.
Assuming that Cal beats both USC
and UCLA, Stanford can vault into a
second place tie with the Trojans
by winning both games.
Cal is out of anybody's reach. The
best that second place Southern Cal
can do it a tie for the champion
ship, and that would require Tro
jan victories and Bear defeats in
all the remaining games.
Such a happening is, to say the
least, improbable.


JOHN "BABE" HIGGINS, Indian
basketball captain, is one of the
leading candidates for All-Confer
ence honors, lie will lead his
teammates tomorrow in his last
same against USC.
