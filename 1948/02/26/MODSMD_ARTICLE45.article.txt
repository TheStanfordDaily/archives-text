## 
### 
Stanford came up with a run in the last of the ninth inning
yesterday to edge past the Boston Red Sox Rookies, 10 to 9.
The game was played in the Sunken Diamond.
Dave Dahle, who had just entered the game as a relief pitcher,
set up the winning tally with a long triple. Dave Melton then

went in to run Tor Dahle and scored
on Ted Nell's foul fly to deep light
field.
Stanford came up with five mark
ers in the seventh inning to get baek
into the game after they had blown
an earlier four run lead. The game
was slow moving and both infields
looked very sloppy at times.
Ted Nell score the first run. Bat
ting from the lead-off spot, Ted
walked, went to second on a passed
ball, anil then came home on Bob
Nava's single. The Cards followed
with three more runs in the second,
as Charlie Cole, Ted Nell, and Bob
Peters all crossed the plate. Nell's
solid two-base smash was the only
hit of the inning.
A shaky Stanford infield was re
sponsible for the four run rally that
the visitors put together in the
fourth. Aree, Brownson, and Peters
traded bobbles as starting hurler
Charlie Bell gave up five runs, three
being unearned.
Bell worked for four innings, be
ing replaced in the fifth by Dave
Stott. Winning pitcher Dave Dahle
went in for Stott in the eighth.
The Indians scored their ten runs
on only nine hits. Ted Nell was the
leading batter, getting two hits in
three trips. Buck Brownson had a
bad day, going hitless in four trips
and contributing bobbles along the
way.
Jack Barnes and Frank MacGraw
handled the catching duties.
