WHITTIER. Feb. 25 (UP). â€”Big
Lofty Ed Smith, down from a
lengthy major career, caught the
eye of Hollywood Manager Jimmy
Dykes today as the stars went
through a three-hour fielding and
batting drill.
"Smith is in fine shape and may
become one of my regular hurlers.
In fact it wouldn't surprise me if
he pitches opening day," Dykes
said.
