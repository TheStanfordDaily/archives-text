SAN JOSE, Feb. 25 (UP). —Rap-
pins the National Collegiate "Purity
Code" as subterfuge. Dr. T. W. Mac-
Quarrie. president of San Jose State
College, today advocated that the
colleges substitute a bit of strict hon
esty for the code in intercollegiate
athletics.
| "Each university or college should
| announce what it is doing with re
; spect to subsidizing athletes." wrote
Dr. MacQuarrie in the college
newspaper, the Spartan Daily. "It
, should tell whether it is giving them
, free tuition, board and room, or
providing them with jobs."
MacQuarrie said that "no one
. ever hears of a small college sug
-1 gesting a code."
"They are suggested by the large
, colleges so that they can enjoy all
j the advantages that their size gives
them," lie said.
' Past experience at San Jose State
I College has convinced me that it is
| desirable to furnish board, room,
I and tuition to participants in games
j where the gate is large enough to
pay for it.
"I prefer that method to the one
by which students are expected to .
work their way through college in |
order to play on athletic teams." ,
He recalled that when San Jose '
State announced some years ago j
1 that it was giving subsistence to i
athletes, it was disciplined by col- j
! leges "which were not making an
nouncements."
"I'm sorry we have this code bus- I
j iness now." said Dr. MacQuarrie. i"I
| "I think the men are entitled to
; more support than the code allows j
—and I like to be honest about it." |
