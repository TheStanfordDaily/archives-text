## BASEBALL PCL Race Previewed 
### JACK BLOOD 
With the basketball season reach
j ing its climax and drawing to a
| close, baseball is preparing to take
! the center of the stage on the na
' tional sporting scene.
Bay Area colleges, St. Mary's and
! San Francisco, as well as Stanford
' have already opened their seasons
I and the maior leagues will begin
! training Monday.
The "third major" Pacific Coast
| League began training this week
| with the eight member teams scat
j lered throughout this state at their
j various training quarters.
j Lefty C'Doul's San Francisco
j Seals are the heavy winter book
favorites to win the pennant. Lefty
is still strong in every department,
but will have to find replacements
for his pitching ace Bob Chesnes
j who was sold to Pittsburgh and Neil
Sheridan, clutch-hitting outfielder.
I who was traded to the Bosox. Cliff
I Melton, Bob Joyce, and Jack Brew
er hold O'Doul's mound hopes. Af
ter two years of taking their spring
' training in Hawaii, the Seals are
j this year encamped at Boyes
i Springs.
WATCH THE ANGELS
1 Hot on the Seals' trail will be the
I defending champion. Los Angeles.
Bill Kellv's Angels will be weak-
I ened by the loss of their top hurler,
| Cliff Chambers, and steady outfield
| er Clarence Maddern—both up for
i a shot with the Cubs. In return the
j Cubs gave up Dim Dom Dalassan
! drn, fireplug-sized outfielder, and
; will stock the Angels with further
doles once the training season gets
under way. The Angels began
training yesterday at Fullerton.
Portland, the surprise of the loop
last year in finishing third, will be
dangerous again this year. Milkman
Jim Turner will field a veteran team
including such major leaguers as
Harvey Storey at third, Eddie "The
Violin" Bazinski at second, and Jal;e
Mooty on the hill. The Bevos have
i received another stay of execution
lon their ancient Yaughan Street
Park so will be able to play home
games this season. They are en
camped in Riverside for their pre
season limbering up.
OAKS TOUGH TOO
Another first-division possibility
as well as pennant threat is Oak
land. Casey Stengal's Acorns faded
in the stretch drive last year but
replacements for their two - man
pitching staff —Will Hafey and Gene
Bearden — are forthcoming in Bob
Klinger and Charlie Gassaway.
However. Bearden may be lost to
the Indians, in which case Casey
will have to rely on Hummingbird
Speer to come through. The Hum

mingbird had a 16-14 record last
year. Also back will be dependable
outfielder Brooks Holder.
The Oaks, who set up camp at
San Fernando Monday, will also
rely heavily on prcspects from the
Stockton Ports, their Class C farm.
Fighting for a place in the first
division sun will be Jo-Jo White's
Seattle Rainiers, who if they have
nothing else will have the one and
only Lou Novikoff dodging flyballs
in left field. Herman Besse and
Walt Dubiel are counted on heavily
in Jo-Jo's pitching plans. The Suds'
training camp at Bakersfield was
opened Monday for the battery men.

OAKS TOUGH TOO
Another first-division possibility
as well as pennant threat is Oak
land. Casey Stengal's Acorns faded
in the stretch drive last year but
replacements for their two - man
pitching staff —Will Hafey and Gene
Bearden — are forthcoming in Bob
Klinger and Charlie Gassaway.
However. Bearden may be lost to
the Indians, in which case Casey
will have to rely on Hummingbird
Speer to come through. The Hum

mingbird had a 16-14 record last
year. Also back will be dependable
outfielder Brooks Holder.
The Oaks, who set up camp at
San Fernando Monday, will also
rely heavily on prcspects from the
Stockton Ports, their Class C farm.
Fighting for a place in the first
division sun will be Jo-Jo White's
Seattle Rainiers, who if they have
nothing else will have the one and
only Lou Novikoff dodging flyballs
in left field. Herman Besse and
Walt Dubiel are counted on heavily
in Jo-Jo's pitching plans. The Suds'
training camp at Bakersfield was
opened Monday for the battery men.
With the basketball season reach
j ing its climax and drawing to a
| close, baseball is preparing to take
! the center of the stage on the na
' tional sporting scene.
Bay Area colleges, St. Mary's and
! San Francisco, as well as Stanford
' have already opened their seasons
I and the maior leagues will begin
! training Monday.
The "third major" Pacific Coast
| League began training this week
| with the eight member teams scat
j lered throughout this state at their
j various training quarters.
j Lefty C'Doul's San Francisco
j Seals are the heavy winter book
favorites to win the pennant. Lefty
is still strong in every department,
but will have to find replacements
for his pitching ace Bob Chesnes
j who was sold to Pittsburgh and Neil
Sheridan, clutch-hitting outfielder.
I who was traded to the Bosox. Cliff
I Melton, Bob Joyce, and Jack Brew
er hold O'Doul's mound hopes. Af
ter two years of taking their spring
' training in Hawaii, the Seals are
j this year encamped at Boyes
i Springs.
WATCH THE ANGELS
1 Hot on the Seals' trail will be the
I defending champion. Los Angeles.
Bill Kellv's Angels will be weak-
I ened by the loss of their top hurler,
| Cliff Chambers, and steady outfield
| er Clarence Maddern—both up for
i a shot with the Cubs. In return the
j Cubs gave up Dim Dom Dalassan
! drn, fireplug-sized outfielder, and
; will stock the Angels with further
doles once the training season gets
under way. The Angels began
training yesterday at Fullerton.
Portland, the surprise of the loop
last year in finishing third, will be
dangerous again this year. Milkman
Jim Turner will field a veteran team
including such major leaguers as
Harvey Storey at third, Eddie "The
Violin" Bazinski at second, and Jal;e
Mooty on the hill. The Bevos have
i received another stay of execution
lon their ancient Yaughan Street
Park so will be able to play home
games this season. They are en
camped in Riverside for their pre
season limbering up.
