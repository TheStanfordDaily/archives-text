## The 						House You Live In 
### 
A horrified roar of protest came from, nearly every women's
living group last week when Housing Com members presented
several new housing plans for consideration.
This was entirely unmerited. Perhaps many women don't
realize that this was simply an evaluation of the present plan.
Discussion is healthy. To encourage this the committee evolved
various plans as a basis for comparison.
These have been kicked around now for a week. They
haven't been completely understood. But in any case the wo
men have realized that our present system has a great many
advantages that they weren't aware of before.
A numerical vote will be taken next Monday night. Everyone
in Lag, Ventura, on the Row, in Union, and at Branner will
have a chance to express her opinion. This vote will decide
the issue.
Beware of overemphasizing housing. We are attending
Stanford. Whether you live on the Row, in a small house or
a larger dorm is only of secondary importance. â€”M. H.
