## More on Bolshevism 
### 
To the Editor:
I am very glad Mr. W. Mandel is asking for more information about
the disguised activities Bolshevism. This is the only way to bare its
real face.
If Moscow's Politbureau asks for "friendly governments" in neighboring
countries, it means, as has been dramatically proven, their occupation and
bolshevization. The "protecting of communication lines" is a disguise
for the maintenance of great Soviet armies in the Balkan countries. The
old Bolshevik dogma "liberation of the proletariat from the capitalist
slavery" gives them the "right" to interfere with the internal matters of
any country, and so on.
Sweden had been horrified by Soviet diplomatic and military pressure
throughout 1945 and 1946 She regained her breath only after the Soviet
thrust in Europe had been stopped by U. S. firmness. The guided missiles
were one of the Soviet means of maintaining that horror Moscow called
it "celestial phenomena."
The Swedish General Staff has convincingly revealed that the Soviet
missiles came not from Peenemunde, alone. There are launching plat
form in Travemuende, Warnemuende. Swinemuende, and other places
along the German Baltic coast. The Soviets forced German engineers
to bring them up to highest efficiency, reviving simulta .eouslv the U-boat
industry and guided missiles production and emphasizing uranium min
ing in Saxony and aircraft production in Tueringia.
The American veteran correspondents in Germany—l was among
them for many years —have categorically been refused permission by the
Soviet authorities to visit these places, even Jack Raymond of the N. Y
Times was not an exception. Their insistent requests have up to this
time been turned down But since I had long experience as a correspond
ent in Germany, I found my own ways to reach t ,-se interesting sources
of "celestial phenomena."
