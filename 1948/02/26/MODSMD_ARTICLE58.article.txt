BERKELEY, Cal. (UP) —It costs an unmarried
working girl living in San Francisco 8180.40 a month
to meet her basic needs, the University of California
reports. The university's Heller Committee for .Re
search in Social Economics based its estimate on
price levels in San Francisco (3uiing September, 1947.
The items which cost a working girl 81,127.47 a
year in 11)41, based on March prices of that year,
now cost 82,164.8 a year on the September, 1947,
level, the committee said.
Largest relative increase was in the federal in
come tax which, in 1941 cost San Francisco's Kitty
Foyles only $8.53, but which nicked her budget for
$275 in 1947. Other costs ,were up, too. Board and
room, budgeted at $577.76 in 1941, soared to $1,058.21
in 1947, the survey showed. Clothing costs jumped
from 895 a year in 1941 to 82(32.63 in 1947—and there
was no provision in that for a Parisian frock or a
silly hat with lots of gee-gaws.
Other budget items, based on the September scale
of prices prevailing in San Francisco, included
$66.16 for care of the person, including all cosmetics;
885 for savings, for emergency use only; $117.92 for
recreation; 868.17 for carfare; 816.91 for gifts; 821.94
