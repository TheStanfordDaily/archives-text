### 
COLUMBUS. 0.. (UP) —Lustron Corp.. modified
from a war baby to build enameled steel homes, is
working now to put a dent of 17.500 homes in the
nation's housing shortage before the year is over.
Officials of the pre-fabrication plant hope to
reach a production level of 150 homes a day by
mid-summer on a minimum of private capital and
a 515.500.000 government loan. The company will
employ about 7.500 persons at top production.
Walls, ceilings and roofs of the mass production
homes are made of porcelain enameled steel. Lus
tron will also make its own plumbing fixtures of
porcelain.
Carl G. Strandlund, an immigrant who came to
this country from Sweden at the age of three, is
the spark behind the post-war corporation. He is
president, general manager and controlling stock
holder. although he invested only S 1.000 cash in
the outfit.
Strandlund. who learned mechanical engineer
ing in the farm implement industry at Moline. HI.,
hopes to build production up to a 45.000-homes-a
-year level. If he does. Lustron will produce almost
double the number of homes prefabricated by the
300 other housing factories in the country last year.
The corporation president is setting up his home
fcuilding organization in one of the war-time Curtiss-
Wright buildings on the outskirts of Columbus. The
porcelain-enameled steel house was developed while
Strandlund was vice president of the Chicago Vit
reous Enamel Co. during the war. He was awarded
a diamond medal a few weeks after the war for
what the armed forces said was an outstanding job.
"It actually isn't as simple as that. That's all
the cash I invested directly, but it cost me a lot to
develop the Lustron house and get control of it. The
stockholders gave me 51 percent of the stock, or
about $860,000 worth, because of my development
work and know-how.
