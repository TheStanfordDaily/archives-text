## History 1948 
### 
In two widely separated parts of the world
tragedy struck with dramatic swiftness this week.
Communists staged a bloodless coup d'etat irr.
Czechoslovakia and seized complete power. This is
perhaps no surprise, for the communists are, despite
their pretenses of respectability, a revolutionary
party fundamentally opposed to parliamentary gov
ernment. They were the leading party in Czecho
slovakia but were faced with elections in April in
which they would have lost considerable strength.
While this may have been no surprise, it certain
ly was a shock. A shock to millions of freedom-

loving Czechs who had fought
for centuries to gain their inde
pendence. A shock to men like
Benes who had given their lives
and their health to the cause of
Czech democracy, who had fought
valiantly against the Austrian
Hapsburgs and German storm
troopers, who had come back
from Nazi concentration camps
to rebuild their country and who*
now face Soviet prisons.
More than that it is a shock to

liberals throughout the world—a tragic blow to the
men of goodwill who insist that cooperation with
Russia is not only necessary but essential for con
tinued peace. These men, and I among them, have
pointed to Czechoslovakia as the country where all
parties, including the Communists, democratically
work together. To what shall we point now?
At the same time, tragedy struck four thousand
miles to the west. At Lake Success, a bitterly ironic
misnomer, the UN Security Council listened to a
speech on the Palestine issue by Warren Austin,
chief American delegate, Austin asked for a speciu.
committee to consult with Jews, Arabs, and British
He said that the Security Council could not legally
enforce the partition plan, that an international
police force cannot be used to back such a settlement
This might well mean the end of UN. The United
Nations' own Palestine Commission has stated that
partition cannot be realized without either an inter
national force or a strong Jewish army. We have
refused to accept either alternative. We have made
it impossible for UN to implement its own decisions
effectively and we are refusing to lift the arms
embargo to Palestine. Instead we want consultations
Officially we are in favor of the UN partition
plan. But when it comes to doing anything about ir.
we are opposed. Without our backing the United
Nations cannot solve the Palestine problem. If it
cannot solve it, it is finished as a useful organiza
tion. Like the old League of Nations, it will be an.
empty shell of fine phrases—it will have betrayed
the hopes of humanity. The major share of respons
ibility for this betrayal will be ours.
Thus, 30 months after Hiroshima the chances for
peace have reached a new low. It is clear that a
nationalistic, aggressive Russia will make the most
of any opportunities that arise. It is clear that the
United States, the last important stand of capitalism
in a non-capitalist world, will oppose Soviet moves
with any and all feasible means. It is also clear
that without an effective international organization
the two countries cannot be prevented from clashing
head-on, with atom bombs flying. Even with such
organization the chances are slender. UN is about
to be given a pompous funeral.
What price life?

In two widely separated parts of the world
tragedy struck with dramatic swiftness this week.
Communists staged a bloodless coup d'etat irr.
Czechoslovakia and seized complete power. This is
perhaps no surprise, for the communists are, despite
their pretenses of respectability, a revolutionary
party fundamentally opposed to parliamentary gov
ernment. They were the leading party in Czecho
slovakia but were faced with elections in April in
which they would have lost considerable strength.
While this may have been no surprise, it certain
ly was a shock. A shock to millions of freedom-

loving Czechs who had fought
for centuries to gain their inde
pendence. A shock to men like
Benes who had given their lives
and their health to the cause of
Czech democracy, who had fought
valiantly against the Austrian
Hapsburgs and German storm
troopers, who had come back
from Nazi concentration camps
to rebuild their country and who*
now face Soviet prisons.
More than that it is a shock to

liberals throughout the world—a tragic blow to the
men of goodwill who insist that cooperation with
Russia is not only necessary but essential for con
tinued peace. These men, and I among them, have
pointed to Czechoslovakia as the country where all
parties, including the Communists, democratically
work together. To what shall we point now?
