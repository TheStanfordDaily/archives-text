Stanford roads are in lousy shape and they should
be rebuilt right away, a friend declared the other day.
Checking up on that complaint with Alt' E. Bran
din. Farm business manager, I was able to compile
a little maintenance data about campus roads.
First, Stanford's limited plant budget restricts
construction and repairs. During the war. scarcity
of manpower and materials put the skids to repairs
and replacements, and buildings, equipment, and
utilities aged rapidly because of the deferred main
tenance. Today Stanford is able to dispose only of
the most critical construction problems first and
must let other necessary repairs get by with tem
porary corrections.
Secondly, road maintenance today is accomplish
ed on a temporary basis. Corporation Yard Super
intendent Carroll Blacker has a full-time crew of
men patching up street chuck-holes, leveling off
warped areas, and lining road dips with crushed
rock and macadam to provide partial relief. Rela
tively little sub-surface repair has been ordered.
Road wear and tear from 5,000 vehicles each day
is one factor for rapid street deterioration. An
other difficulty is an invisible one—the adobe subsoil.
Underground moisture absorbed by porous soil
causes streets to sink and form the dips and warped
areas. Only by excavating the affected region and
filling it in with boulders and crushed rocks can a
sinking road be remedied. High labor expenses
make the cost for a large-scale excavation project
prohibitive.
Long stretches of some streets, such as Escon
dido and Galvez, require this involved repair opera
tion—at an estimated 11 cents per square foot Total
cost for the project would run far into the thous
ands of dollars.
I believe that Brar.din and other Administration
leaders are sincere when they emphasize the need

for funds for more seriously deteriorated University
facilities. A few of these proposed allotted diver
sions include:
1. Electrical Project—The first stage of this pro
gram to boost the Farm's electricity load and puc
the system underground will cost an estimated
$160,000. After 18 months' construction that allot
ment will be exhausted. Stanford's former electrical
system was a fire menace to the entire campus.
2. Steam Plant—Although no funds have been di
verted for new facilities, our present steam plant is
inadequate for Stanford's population. Its age, fur
thermore, makes the plant just as inadequate a.»
the campus electrical system.
3. Water System—Stanford's piping for water is
insufficient and primitive for the present popula
tion. The school never will be as small as it was
60 years ago when the utility was laid. Water is a
necessity, and piping facilities must be given top
priority if the University is to function.
4. Buildings Maintenance—Stanford always will
need continuous plant repairs. One costly expense
draining the maintenance budget is replacing many
tile roofing shingles. Without such repair immeas
urable damage would be incurred to buildings,
equipment, and books.
There you have the facts. Dollars from Farm
investments are cheap today; they do not go vers
far; tomorrow they might buy more.
As far as this particular problem of road dis
repair is concerned, I may sum up the situation by
saying that Brandin, more than anyone else, realizes
the seriousness of street conditions on campus. His
files contain a number of cost estimates for major
road repairs. No basis exists for criticism to the
Administration; Stanford is not sitting on a pot
of gold while environmental facilities deteriorate.
