# U.S. May Halt Czech Credit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UP).—
The United States will probably cvit
off further credit to Czechoslovakia
as a result of the Communist seizure
of power there, informed govern
ment officials said tonight.
These sources said there was a
chance this country also would halt
exports to Czechoslovakia—particu
larly of machinery. But they em
phasized that no decisions of such a
nature have been made.
The United States and Britain are
expected to consult on measures
they will take following the capitu
lation of the last Eastern European
country to Communist rule.
Pending such consultation, Amer
ican officials said this appeared to
be the prospect:
The United States probably will
not break off diplomatic relations
with Czechoslovakia. As in Poland
and other "satellite" nations, it
wants to keep its diplomatic station
in Prague as a "window" in the
"iron curtain."
No further credit can be expected
to go to the Czechs, either from this
country directly or from the Inter
national Bank and Monetary Fund,
on which the United States has a
dominant voice.
