# Excom Debates Foreign Scholarship Flans
## 
### 
Excom took no action on voting
' ASSU funds for the foreign scholar
ship pogram. but a spirited discus
sion on the merits of the program
j featured the open meeting in the
j Village auditorium last night.
President Tom Martzloff posed the
j question whether surplus funds of
the ASSU would be better utilized
in the scholarship program than in
other projects under consideration:
j namely, a new Pavilion and Union,
j Later he spoke against the plan.
Jose de Larios, Excom member,
and Bob Coate, senior class presi
dent, led the discussion in favor of
the plan. De Larios said that the
best way to stop Communism is to
| sell democracy abroad; the best way
; to do it is to bring over more poten
: tial leaders to study in the United
States where they will learn that
: the capitalistic system does work.
' CAMPUS INTEREST
Coate pointed out that the proj
ect has already drawn much inter
est around campus; and once the
program is under way at Stanford,
it will be adopted bv other cam

puses. Fraternities through their
national connections will do much
to promote the expansion of a for
eign scholarship program, he said.
Martzloff said he believed the plan
: was impractical, too elaborate, and
too costly. He suggested finding
another plan to promote under
standing of the United States by
helping foreign students already at
J Stanford, and by contributing to
i SIRO.
i Six candidates were nominated
for yell leaders from among the nine
| who tried out. They are:
; John Wentmore. Alfred Green,
Tom Elke, Ray Pascoe. George Jai-
I dar, and Jay Hughes.
PROPOSES AMENDMENT
Excom tabled a proposed amend
i ment to the constitution which
i would fix responsibility for any fu-
I ture mob damage such as that which
! occurred at the recent Pajamarino.
! Inter-Club Council was granted
a date for a spring quarter Reg
dance to be held at the Pavilion.
Excom was told that the Univer

sity was in no way responsible for
financing the Freedom Train.
NSA's budget of $167 was ap
proved.
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Student Manager Gene Mitguard
made proposals for transfers of
funds from defunct organizations.
Under the plan, the $185 balance in
the old Hall accounts (now frater
nities) is to be turned over to In
terfraternity Council. Toyon Hall is
to receivc the balance of $202.24 of
the Freshman Toyon Club for an
improvement fund.
Work of the Student-Faculty Em
ployment Committee was explained
by Jose de Larios. He said the group
will work for better working con
ditions for hashers and other em
ployed students. One phase of the
program will be to set up an agency
which will permit students to find
out whether or not they can sell
services or products or act as agents
on campus. At present the only pol

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Student Manager Gene Mitguard
made proposals for transfers of
funds from defunct organizations.
Under the plan, the $185 balance in
the old Hall accounts (now frater
nities) is to be turned over to In
terfraternity Council. Toyon Hall is
to receivc the balance of $202.24 of
the Freshman Toyon Club for an
improvement fund.
Work of the Student-Faculty Em
ployment Committee was explained
by Jose de Larios. He said the group
will work for better working con
ditions for hashers and other em
ployed students. One phase of the
program will be to set up an agency
which will permit students to find
out whether or not they can sell
services or products or act as agents

President Tom Martzloff posed the
j question whether surplus funds of
the ASSU would be better utilized
in the scholarship program than in
other projects under consideration:

j Later he spoke against the plan.
Jose de Larios, Excom member,
and Bob Coate, senior class presi
dent, led the discussion in favor of
the plan. De Larios said that the
best way to stop Communism is to
| sell democracy abroad; the best way
; to do it is to bring over more poten
: tial leaders to study in the United
States where they will learn that
: the capitalistic system does work.
' CAMPUS INTEREST
Coate pointed out that the proj
ect has already drawn much inter
est around campus; and once the
program is under way at Stanford,
it will be adopted bv other cam

puses. Fraternities through their
national connections will do much
to promote the expansion of a for
eign scholarship program, he said.
Martzloff said he believed the plan
: was impractical, too elaborate, and
too costly. He suggested finding
another plan to promote under
standing of the United States by
helping foreign students already at
J Stanford, and by contributing to
i SIRO.
i Six candidates were nominated
for yell leaders from among the nine
| who tried out. They are:
; John Wentmore. Alfred Green,
Tom Elke, Ray Pascoe. George Jai-
