### 
PRAGUE, Feb. 26 (UP) —The Communists began a sweeping
purge throughout Czechoslovakia today in a drive to consolidate
the power they won in a lightning coup.
Parliament, government departments, the diplomatic service,
city administrations, political parties, newspapers, industry,

schools—even hospitals and sports
organizations—were included in the
leftist sweep.
There were indications that the
Communists would take over the
Boy Scout and Girl Scout move
ments.
SOCIALISTS ARRESTED
Authoritative sources said three
National Socialist members of Par
liament had been arrested and that
warrants had been issued for the
arrest of at least three more clepu- j
ties including Vaclav Majer, a right- j
wing Social Democrat who was food
minister in the old cabinet.
A parliamentary '"action commit- \
tee" led by Communists and Social
Democrats called on all members
of Parliament "except those respon
sible for the crisis" to declare them
selves publicly for the new ''Na
tional Front" of Premier Klement
Gottwald.
A member of Parliament ex
pressed belief that those who would
refuse to declare for Gottwald
would be expelled from the house.
NO OPEN PROTESTS
Except for the students who dem
onstrated against the Communist
coup yesterday there had been no
open protest anywhere in the coun
try - . . i
However, the United States, Brit- :
ain, and France issued an extraor
dinary joint communique condemn
ing the Communist coup in Czecho
slovakia as "dictatorship" and a \
"disastrous" blow to Czech freedom i
today.
There was no hint that a break in
diplomatic relations impended.
The statement drew a parallel be
tween the Red tactics in Czechoslo
vakia and those used in the other
Eastern European satellites which
already have fallen completely un
der Communist domination. But
Russia's backstage role in the
Prague coup was not mentioned.
