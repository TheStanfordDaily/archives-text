# New Virginia Law May Hit Truman
## 
### 
: RICHMOND, Va„ Feb. 26 (UP).—
: Gov. William M. Tuck, in full revolt
| against President Truman's civil
| rights plan, today called for laws to
j take the names of Presidential can
! didates oft' the ballot and allow a
| party convention to decide who
would get Virginia's 11 electoral
votes.
Tuck's lieutenants immediately
started bills to do this through the
House and Senate. They would let
| the state Democratic convention, or
a committee of party leaders, cle
j cide whether to support Mr. Tru
j man.
The bills also would prevent a
; third party from getting on the bal
lot.
Tuck said that if Virginia and oth
er southern states withheld their
electoral votes from Mr. Truman"it
I would prove an effective remedy for
most of our grievances and insure
j us an inffuential voice."
"The so-called civil rights program
I would not improve relations between
| the races," Tuck said, but would on
j ly enforce "imaginary lights which
j do not exist."
The Federal Constitution allows
; each state legislature to pick presi
dential electors in any manner.
Once electors are chosen, the
j Constitution allows them to vote
; for anyone.
