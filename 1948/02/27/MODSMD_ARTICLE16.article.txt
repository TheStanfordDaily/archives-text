# Indians Hosts USC Tonight
## 
### 
A Stanford basketball team
which has been badly shoved
j around in conference play will
try to get some compensation
this weekend when it takes on
Southern Cal and UCLA at th»
Pavilion.
The Trojans invade the Farm to
' night with the Uclans providing the
opposition tomorrow. Both games
will start at 8 p.m.
SECOND PLACE.
Neither the Indians, Trojans, no-
Bruins are going anywhere in th<?
conference race, which has become
a runaway -for the California Bears
But all three clubs are gunning fo;.
j second place.
Right now USC is leading the
"second division" teams with fou
wins and four losses, UCLA ha.-
three and five, and Stanford traiL
with two and six. Cal has won al l
eight of its games.
Three of the Trojans' victories
j have been at the expense of Stan
; ford, and Coach Everett Dean's men
! definitely don't want to lose the

I fourth one to the lucky Trojans.
Against Sam Barry's slow-break
ing outfit. Dean will start Morley
Thompson and Bill Rose at for
wards, Steve Stephenson at center,
and Dave Davidson and Babe Hig-
I gins at guards.
These men will probably be met
