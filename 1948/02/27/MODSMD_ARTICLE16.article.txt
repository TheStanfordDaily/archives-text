# Indians Hosts USC Tonight
## 
### 
A Stanford basketball team
which has been badly shoved
j around in conference play will
try to get some compensation
this weekend when it takes on
Southern Cal and UCLA at th»
Pavilion.
The Trojans invade the Farm to
' night with the Uclans providing the
opposition tomorrow. Both games
will start at 8 p.m.
SECOND PLACE.
Neither the Indians, Trojans, no-
Bruins are going anywhere in th<?
conference race, which has become
a runaway -for the California Bears
But all three clubs are gunning fo;.
j second place.
Right now USC is leading the
"second division" teams with fou
wins and four losses, UCLA ha.-
three and five, and Stanford traiL
with two and six. Cal has won al l
eight of its games.
Three of the Trojans' victories
j have been at the expense of Stan
; ford, and Coach Everett Dean's men
! definitely don't want to lose the

I fourth one to the lucky Trojans.
Against Sam Barry's slow-break
ing outfit. Dean will start Morley
Thompson and Bill Rose at for
wards, Steve Stephenson at center,
and Dave Davidson and Babe Hig-
I gins at guards.
These men will probably be met
)y the regular USC quintet of Bill
Sharman and Abe Androff, for-
A'ards; Alex Hannum, center; and
•'red Bertram and Earl Wallis,
guards.
Leading the Trojan attack will
>e the 6 - foot - 6 Hannum, second
lighest scorer in the southern di
ision. Big Alex has already been
lamed to one all-conference team
ihead of Stanford's Stephenson. Not
i smooth player. Hannum uses his
leight well.
The two forwards, Androff and
>harman, are dangerous when they
re hot. as the Indians have learned
6 their sorrow. Bertram and Wallis
re good on the boards. Barry's
blest reserves are forward Joe
\'hite and guard Don Powars.
None of these men is a really out
tanding star, but together they are
workmanlike ball club.
Tomorrow night's Stanford lineup

depends partly on the showing made
in tonight's game, according to
Dean. But it is safe to say that it
will probably be substantially the
same outfit that starts against Troy.
Stanford's only two conference
victories have been over the Bruins,
who seem to have the makings of a
good ball club but have never quite
arrived.
The Westwooders are led by Cap
! tain Johnny Stanich, forward, and
one-time Ail-American Dave Mi
nor, guard. Neither of these men
has shown much against Stanford.
In the last UCLA game played here
John Stanich was outshone by his
brother George who will start at
center.
If Stanford can throttle the Bruin 1
' fast break and keep from fouling too
I many Trojans while they go through
1 their tantalizing passing routine,
the Indians could come up with a
pair of wins.

workmanlike ball club.
Tomorrow night's Stanford lineup

depends partly on the showing made
in tonight's game, according to
Dean. But it is safe to say that it
will probably be substantially the
same outfit that starts against Troy.
Stanford's only two conference
victories have been over the Bruins,
who seem to have the makings of a
good ball club but have never quite
arrived.
The Westwooders are led by Cap
! tain Johnny Stanich, forward, and
one-time Ail-American Dave Mi
nor, guard. Neither of these men
has shown much against Stanford.
In the last UCLA game played here
John Stanich was outshone by his
brother George who will start at
center.
If Stanford can throttle the Bruin 1
' fast break and keep from fouling too
I many Trojans while they go through
1 their tantalizing passing routine,
the Indians could come up with a
pair of wins.
A Stanford basketball team
which has been badly shoved
j around in conference play will
try to get some compensation
this weekend when it takes on
Southern Cal and UCLA at th»
Pavilion.
The Trojans invade the Farm to
' night with the Uclans providing the
opposition tomorrow. Both games
will start at 8 p.m.
SECOND PLACE.
Neither the Indians, Trojans, no-
Bruins are going anywhere in th<?
conference race, which has become
a runaway -for the California Bears
But all three clubs are gunning fo;.
j second place.
Right now USC is leading the
"second division" teams with fou
wins and four losses, UCLA ha.-
three and five, and Stanford traiL
with two and six. Cal has won al l
eight of its games.
Three of the Trojans' victories
j have been at the expense of Stan
; ford, and Coach Everett Dean's men
! definitely don't want to lose the

I fourth one to the lucky Trojans.
Against Sam Barry's slow-break
ing outfit. Dean will start Morley
Thompson and Bill Rose at for
wards, Steve Stephenson at center,
and Dave Davidson and Babe Hig-
I gins at guards.
These men will probably be met
)y the regular USC quintet of Bill
Sharman and Abe Androff, for-
A'ards; Alex Hannum, center; and
•'red Bertram and Earl Wallis,
guards.
Leading the Trojan attack will
>e the 6 - foot - 6 Hannum, second
lighest scorer in the southern di
ision. Big Alex has already been
lamed to one all-conference team
ihead of Stanford's Stephenson. Not
i smooth player. Hannum uses his
leight well.
The two forwards, Androff and
>harman, are dangerous when they
re hot. as the Indians have learned
6 their sorrow. Bertram and Wallis
re good on the boards. Barry's
blest reserves are forward Joe
\'hite and guard Don Powars.
None of these men is a really out
tanding star, but together they are
workmanlike ball club.
