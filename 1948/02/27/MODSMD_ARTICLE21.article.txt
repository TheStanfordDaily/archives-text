# No Large-Scale Aid to China, Marshall Convinces Senators
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2(5 (UP)—-Several ranking members of the Sena:.
Foreign Relations committee left a closed meeting with Secretary
State George C. Marshall today convinced that any large scale America:-,
military commitments in China would be a "tragic error."
That view was not shared, however, by one influential Senate Repub
lican who said he will propose writing arms-for-China into the new bill
for the Greece-Turkey "quarantine communism" program.

♦" What Marshall told the committee
| about the plight oi anti-communist
military forces in China was closely
I guarded. But members said he made
these points:
1. The administration's new $570.-
000.000 China aid program, mainly
i non-military, would give Chian._
Kai-Shek's Nationalist government
a "breathing-spell" to deal with
what Marshall described as much
needed fiscal and political reforms.
2. U. S. military assistance — in
cluding ammunition and plane?
drawn from surplus war stocks—
! has been larger than heretofore re
i vealed and is continuing.
3. But any actual American com
mitment to underwrite non-com
munist forces in China or the scale
undertaken in Greece would be
risky in the extreme and have littl.
I chance for success.
