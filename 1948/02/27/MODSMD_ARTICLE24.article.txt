Earlier that day he said pledges
to the organization held a meeting
and were told to bring back a fresh
ly killed dog by 6 p.m. or turn in
their pledge pins.
He identified the students who
went to the Santa Monica pound and
obtained the animal as Alexander
Van Dyke, Richard Roberts and Don
Anderson.
"I saw them about 3:30 o'clock
and they said they had the dog," [
Hallock went on. "Some understood j
the dog was to be a mascot although
the house already had two dogs.

"Roberts picked me up at my
house at 5:30 p.m. and told me the
dog was killed. He said the animal, I
i\ black cocker spaniel, was obtained
at the pound, was taken to a vacant j
lof and killed by blows over the t
head while it was drinking milk
and then put in a sack and taken
to t.he fraternity house."
Hallock said that at 9 that even
ing he and the other pledges were {
sent to the basement to bring back
some gunny sacks filled with rocks
i»s part of their initiation.
"In the basement one of the boys I
said, 'I'd better take the sack the
dog was in' and pulled a sack out
of a trunk.
"In the semi-darkness I looked
into the sack and saw what I was
convinced was a dog. It was not very
big and looked like a black mass. It
had the kind of fur that spaniels
have.

"I saw no head, eyes or feet. The
sack was put back into the trunk. I
went upstairs and realized the dog
had been killed and I didn't like it
so I sent a telegram resigning from
the fraternity."
A hearing is scheduled for next
Tuesday at the West Los Angeles
branch of the city attorney's office
and three members of the fraternity
have been cited to appear. The hear
ing will determine if complaints
charging cruelty to animals should
be issued.

ASIvEI) PLEDGES FOR DOG
Earlier that day he said pledges
to the organization held a meeting
and were told to bring back a fresh
ly killed dog by 6 p.m. or turn in
their pledge pins.
He identified the students who
went to the Santa Monica pound and
obtained the animal as Alexander
Van Dyke, Richard Roberts and Don
Anderson.
"I saw them about 3:30 o'clock
and they said they had the dog," [
Hallock went on. "Some understood j
the dog was to be a mascot although
the house already had two dogs.
COCKER SPANIEL BEATEN
"Roberts picked me up at my
house at 5:30 p.m. and told me the
dog was killed. He said the animal, I
i\ black cocker spaniel, was obtained
at the pound, was taken to a vacant j
lof and killed by blows over the t
head while it was drinking milk
and then put in a sack and taken
to t.he fraternity house."
Hallock said that at 9 that even
ing he and the other pledges were {
sent to the basement to bring back
some gunny sacks filled with rocks
i»s part of their initiation.
"In the basement one of the boys I
said, 'I'd better take the sack the
dog was in' and pulled a sack out
of a trunk.
"In the semi-darkness I looked
into the sack and saw what I was
convinced was a dog. It was not very
big and looked like a black mass. It
had the kind of fur that spaniels
have.

"I saw no head, eyes or feet. The
sack was put back into the trunk. I
went upstairs and realized the dog
had been killed and I didn't like it
so I sent a telegram resigning from
the fraternity."
