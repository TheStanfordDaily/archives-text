; were 4 per cent below January's
j peak prices, the Federal Rerserve
j Board reported today.
But January's prices, the board
I said, were more than twice as high
I as the pre-war average.
At the same time, the Labor De
| partment leported that average
; wholesale prices declined three -
| tenths of one per cent last week.
chiefly because of a drop in food
j prices. It was the second week in a
1 row that wholesale prices have gone
! down.
Retail price cuts followed the
I commodity market drop which, in
turn, had caused the general level
of all wholesale prices to fall off 4
per cent between mid-January and
i the latter part of February'.
The board reported that the prices
i of hides, print cloth and some other
; industrial materials also went down.
But the price of semi-finished steel
! and of worsted fabrics used to make
| men's suits went up at the same
i time.

more than usual in January, the
board reported. But they started up
again almost immediately and were
■ 30 per cent higher for the first half
| of February than they had been in
! the same month of 1947.
