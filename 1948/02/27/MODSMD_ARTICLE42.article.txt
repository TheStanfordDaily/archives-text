# Park Theater Will Present 'Masterpiece'
## 
### 
Film masterpieces may be rare,
' but one will start at the Park The
| ater Sunday night.
"Brief Encounter'' takes a simple
i plot and weaves it so skillfully that
it is transformed into a moving
drama of human emotion. J. Arthur
I Rank's production features a skill-
I ful blending of action, photography,
I and music, making the movie a
| masterpiece of technique.
FRESH TREATMENT
The theme of "Brief Encounter" is
I love; but instead of the ridiculous
Hollywood representation of a
glamorous female and a stupid boy,
this love happens between two
plain, middle-aged people. Both are
1 supposedly happily married.
The woman in the story sets the
tone of the movie when she says,"I
didn't think this could happen to
ordinary people." It does happen,
quite accidentally. They struggle
between their emotions and their
reason. The story ends in the real
istic acknowledgement of necessity,
instead of the usual romantic fan
! iasy.
"Brief Encounter" is the Old "boy
meets-girl" story, but its approach
is so fresh and its treatment so real
istic that it becomes a cinema mas
terpiece.
MUSIC AIDS PLOT
Music is very well adapted to the
action of the plot. The varying
moods and tempos of the Rachma
ninoff concerto beautifully reflect
the emotions of the characters.
The acting in "Brief Encounter"
1 achieves a high degree of natural
ness. which aids the movie's effec
-1 tiveness. The minor characteriza-
I tions of rural English personalities
! add a nice touch of humor to bal
ance the serious aspects of the plot.
