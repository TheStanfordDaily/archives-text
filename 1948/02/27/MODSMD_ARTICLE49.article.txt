# Lynx Next For Yearling Nine
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball
team hopes to chalk up win number
two when it meets Lincoln High
{ School of San Francisco on the frosh
diamond tomorrow afternoon at
! 2:30.
Coach Charlie Bushong plans to
start lefty Lloyd Westphal on the
mound against the invading Links.
With three games under their belts
the freshmen have smoothed out
their fielding, and if last Wednes
day's 14-hit attack against Balboa
I High is a sign, iheir offense has also
shifted into high gear.
Be-spectacled Bob Ames at short
and Don McComber at first in par
ticular have shown fine defensive
work. Leading the attack to date
are left fielder Jim Trabucco, third
sacker Sal Coletto, and pitcher Den
ny Tuffanelli, surprisingly enough.
