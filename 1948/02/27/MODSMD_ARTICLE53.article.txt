### JOHN HALL 
Local basketball fans will get to
see some oi' the current hot nominees
for all-conference selection in action
this weekend when USC and UCLA
invade the Stanford pavilion for the
final time this year,
Babe Higgins is playing his last
year of ball for the Farm and will
j wind up his college career in the
j next four games. The Babe has been
I the backbone of the Stanford team
all season. His steady play, great
i ball-handling, and good shooting eye
stamp him as one of ihe outstand
ing players in the conference.
Bill Stephenson, Card center, has
at times keen head and shoulders
; above any center in the loop. He is
! an excellent backboard man, and
] has a deadly set of hook shots, but
he has been having a hard time with
USC. Right now, Alex Hannum, the
: Trojan ace pivot man, rates a slihgt
j edge over Steve.
Hannum has outscored Steve in
' league play, and has the advantage
of playing on the second place ball
club. Still. Stephenson has enough
time left to overtake Big Alex in the
1 scoring, and even the standings could
be reversed if Stanford has a good
weekend. All eyes will be on Han
| num and Stephenson tonight as they
bring to a climax their four game
I duel.
