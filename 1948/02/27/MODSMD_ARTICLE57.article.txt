# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Steam Blowers 
### 
Last week we suggested to Excom that they get all the facts
before voting on an issue. Most of the time they do. But perhaps
it is too much to expect that v/riters of letters to the editor exer
cise the same caution before blowing off steam. Witness the
letter below.
Here are the facts for Tom Brand. As guests of the Village
Council, Excom ate with the Council in the room to which they
were directed by Council members. This room (used for ex
change dinners) was quiet and enabled Excom and Council
members to get acquainted more easily, according to the Village
President.
In the open Excom meeting following dinner, both Excom
and the Village Council attempted to achieve that "common
touch." Everyone in the Village v/as invited to attend, to partic
ipate in the discussion, to express his individual view.
Yet, how many had enough interest to be there? Fifteen
persons were in the audience—ll of these were Council mem
bers and lobbyists. Presumably the remaining four were there
to get to know Excom and to say what they thought on the burn
ing issues facing the campus.
One of the favorite indoor and outdoor sports these days is
damning student government —as a farce, as incompetent, or
useless. That certainly is your privilege, as students. But if you
care enough about student government to castigate it, why not
attend a few meetings first and find out what you're talking
about?
