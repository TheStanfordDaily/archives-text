We hope you noticed "Quad Angles" in yesterday's Daily.
Written with an eye to supplying information rather than pre
senting any particular viewpoint, this new* column will run in
place of "History 1948" twice a week.
"Quad Angles," we believe, fills a definite need on campus.
Author Lorry Lokey can and will speak with authority on each
problem he tackles. Each "Quad Angle" represents several
hours of research and interviews with pertinent officials and rep
resentatives.
The Daily is pleased to have this column. We like it and
we're sure you will enjoy it, too.
