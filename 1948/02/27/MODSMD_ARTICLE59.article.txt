## 'Exclusive' Excom 
### 
To the Editor:
I wish to join the rest of the residents of Stanford Village in giving
three rousing cheers for Excom and our student government for the ex
ample of democracy in action given us Wednesday night. I particularly
feel touched that they should join us at the dinner table, so to speak,
to get to know us, and how we feel on the burning issues facing the cam
pus. The fact that they immediately stuck themselves away in the private
dining room and didn't venture out during meal has, of course. little
effect upon their ideaâ€”Excom and the Common Touvh Forever!
