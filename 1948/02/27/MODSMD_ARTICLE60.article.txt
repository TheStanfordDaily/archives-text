# Corrin Misquoted
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The statement attributed to me that '"it is the job of the government
(USSR) to get the truth and this is done in one newspaper only" is not
only misquoted but untrue. The assumed purpose of the quote was to
point out the Soviet definition of a free press.
Correction of The Daily error canr.ot be made here due to tack of space.
However, an indication of the Soviet point of view is found in this quo
tation: "Unreliable statements and statements not based on facts are not
fit for print." Dissemination of such "statements" is prevented by what we,
in the United States, call "censorship."
