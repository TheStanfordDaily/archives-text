# The 						'Peron Plan'

### 
To the Editor:
I think maybe Brother Bletz has the wrong angle on President Peron's
recent price boost of Argentine wheat. Juan is a slick old slyboots all
right, but not in the sense that he is pocketing all that $5.95 (price of
wheat a bushel) minus $1.35 (payment to the wheat growers).
He has a little "Peron Plan" of his own in wfaich he claims to bo
sending half his wheat to Europe frae to help some of the nations (such
as France. Spain and Italy) recover, and therefore has to raise the price
of wheat he does sell in order to pay for those hand-outs.
In other words he relieves the inconvenience of Argentina in feeding
Europe by making Poorhouse Britain and others pay for his "charities."
Why he is making Britain cough up instead of including her in the dole
out is another matter for speculation.
