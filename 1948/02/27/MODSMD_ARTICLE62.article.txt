## People Hazy on Marshall Plan 
### 
CHICAGO (UP) —A public opinion poll of the
Chicago area shows that more than one-fourth of
the people,who have heard of the Marshall Plan do
not know what it is. The poll was conducted by the
Northwestern University psychology department. It
showed that 87 per cent of the persons interviewed
had heard of the Marshall Plan.
But 28 per cent of them—a "surprisingly large
number"—did not know its aims, structure, or mean
ing. the university said. Seventy-three percent of
the persons questioned believe that another war is
on the way. Of that group. 82 per cent believe it
will come within the next 20 years.
Last year, a Northwestern poll showed that only
63 per cent anticipated war during the next two
decades.
Seventy-six per cent of the persons Interviewed
believe that the United States should give as much
aid to Europe as it can decide upon and afford. Food
and non-military loans received the largest vote.
Only seven per cent of those favoring aid are will
ing to go '"all the way," the university said.
Of five suggested means to achieve lasting peace,
the United Nations received the highest vote, the
university found. However, 55 per cent of the group
voting for the UN felt that at present it is doing
poor job. The other four methods listed for achiev
ing peace were a federal world government, a United
States of Europe, increasing American military
strength, and sharing atomic secrets with other na
tions.
Only one per cent approved sharing secrets of
the atom bomb.
