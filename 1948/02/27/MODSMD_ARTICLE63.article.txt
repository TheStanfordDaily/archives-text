CHICAGO (UP) —An industrialist warns that
American industry must modernize more rapidly to
avoid the "technological decline" which now plagues
Great Britain and France.
William J. Kelley. president of the Machinery and
Allied Products Institute, said in an institute report
that production facilities in the United States have
been wearing out faster since 1930 than they have
been replaced.
The report, based on a study of 25 British indus
tries. plates most of the blame for production dilfi- *
eulties there on the use of "mechanical antiques and
outmoded production methods."
Kelly said many national policies have been adopt -
ed in the United States which are "incompatible with
the maintenance of a dynamic and expanding econ
omy."
"Until we reverse these practices," he said. ''Am
erica will have alarming symptoms of a technological
decline similar to that which has overtaken England
and France."
American workers, the report said, produce akou:
three times as much as British workers, largely be
cause of superior equipment. The report pointed
out that more than half the equipment in use in
large segments of British industry was installed be
fore World War I.
"We have seen both management and labor ob
sessed with a passion for 'security' and 'stability.."
the report said of Great Britain. "We have seen a

tax system inimical to enterprise and adventure . . .
And finally we see in Britain the logical sequence
intervention of the state.
"The parallels between America and Britain art
too close for comfort. We are by no means immune
to the degenerative processes that have sapped tho
vitality of industry overseas."
Kelly said the report was' not issued to disparage
England "but to examine and learn from her exper
ience."
