In spite of the current sky-high prices, American
farmers are being told by Mr. Elmer H. Sexauer,
vice-president of the United States Chamber o:
Commerce, to prepare to cut down on their pro
duction.
His argument was based on the fact that so
long as the United States feeds and clothes a large
portion of the world's population, American farmers

need have no worries nor fears
about getting high prices for their
corn and wheat, their pork and
beef.
But, he went on, this situation
can continue only for a limited
number of years; therefore, Amer
ican farmers had better be think
ing about ways of tapering oft' lest
they bury themselves in unwanted
produce.
No competent economist has ever
undertaken to show that the fann-

ers of the world can produce more than the people
of the world can eat. On the contrary, the real
difficulty is that many cannot pay for the food they
should have. I do not think it is necessary to cite
the diets of China and India to make this point clear.
It can be demonstrated all too easily in certain sec
tions of the United States.
What is needed, then, is not a cut in produc
tion; it is a cut in food costs which is necessary
Certainly, a way ought to be found to reverse the
spiral of inflation before it spins into a crash. Be
yond that, it is a matter of full employment—of
enough purchasing power to assure the farmers o:
a fair profit at a fair price. This is a very big order.
Nevertheless, the way out is hardly to be found in
government loans and other devices which do little
more than give a farmer a few of the dollars he
ought to be getting by selling everything that he
can reasonably raise.
This idle talk of the Chamber of Commerce to
reduce production can prove to be unhealthy and
dangerous. The sad fact is that the failure to produce
reduces opportunity to earn and to buy. It is .
dangerous contagious disease in the realm of eco
nomics.
To thrive, capitalism must be dynamic and ex
pansive. What the United States Chamber of Com
merce proposes, or at least one of its heads proposes,
is to put the system of capitalism into a statu
position.

of Commerce of the United States would be far

In spite of the current sky-high prices, American
farmers are being told by Mr. Elmer H. Sexauer,
vice-president of the United States Chamber o:
Commerce, to prepare to cut down on their pro
duction.
His argument was based on the fact that so
long as the United States feeds and clothes a large
portion of the world's population, American farmers

need have no worries nor fears
about getting high prices for their
corn and wheat, their pork and
beef.
But, he went on, this situation
can continue only for a limited
number of years; therefore, Amer
ican farmers had better be think
ing about ways of tapering oft' lest
they bury themselves in unwanted
produce.
No competent economist has ever
undertaken to show that the fann-

ers of the world can produce more than the people
of the world can eat. On the contrary, the real
difficulty is that many cannot pay for the food they
should have. I do not think it is necessary to cite
