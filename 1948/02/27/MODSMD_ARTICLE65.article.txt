## Bull Session 
### 
Unless I'm mistaken, I've got my picture with
the column this morning. Yep—l'm right. Hello,
vou grinning fool.
So many people wrote in asking if I had two
heads that the editor decided to run a picture.
To those of you who wrote, and who now look
at the picture. I point out that I do not have two
heads. In this case even one is a superfluity.
A guy by the name of Stan Marcus took this

picture. He's a good photographer,
they say.
Three people have already asked
me if I had ulcers and Reader's]
Digest wants to run the picture!
over an article called "Constip^- 1
tion Can Be Cured "
I was going to hold out for a •
Lord Calvert picture, and, as a
matter of fact, had a bottle of Coke
in my hand at the time the picture
was taken, only vou can't see it
from where you're standing.

Actually the little pictures on the Editorial Page
are a part of The Daily's new lo«-k. and there
haven't been as many comments about The Daily as
I expected.
The Roth House hashers wrote in to say that
The Daily had outlived its usefulness—that the paper
was no longer big enough to line garbage cans.
On the other hand, another group, who shall be
nameless, wrote to say that The Daily was now
more valuable than ever—seems that they fold it
once vertically and it just fits on their roll.
If the latter fad gets around, we'll have to print
every third issue on Scott's Tissue.
Of course the real reason for the change in for
mat is two-fjld.
First, it supposedly makes The Daily easier to
read at breakfast and in classes

I don't know about this. I used to turn one pag«
in order to get to the sport page. Now I have t>
flip through five pages of SIRO. lIR, ICC, NSA, an
Henry Wallace before I can find out how far in th.
cellar the team is. And all of this causes a disturb
ing noise in class.
Still they say the paper is easier to handle.
I say there is too much folding ,and point to th
California traveling salesman who flipped his li.
trying to fold a road map back into the little packe
it came in.
The second reason for the new look is that i
gives the new editor something to do.
Each new editor changes something around s
he won't look like the last editor.
Last year, for example, someone yanked th
editorials off of page two and put them on the la.-
page. This was hailed as the greatest change 1
editorials since Brisbane discovered 12-point type
Nobody has given the Editorial Page muc
thought except the people who write it, so the thin
has stayed put, but someone will come along an
put editorials back inside the paper, mark my won
The only thing that hasn't changed about Th
Daily in the past five years is the price. It's sti
free, and a darn good thing.
The stability of The Daily's retail price confirn
a secret report we had from Raymond Moley th;
the price of diamonds hasn't changed much sine
Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba a necklace.
What you, the average reader, do not know
that 50 cents of your ASSU money goes to finani
The Daily. This is a semi-hidden transaction ar:
compares favorably to buttoning your pants wi!
your left hand.
Oh well, it's cheap at half the price, and wh,
would you do during 10 o'clocks if you didn't ha\
Tlie Daily?

What you, the average reader, do not know
that 50 cents of your ASSU money goes to finani
The Daily. This is a semi-hidden transaction ar:
compares favorably to buttoning your pants wi!
your left hand.
Oh well, it's cheap at half the price, and wh,
would you do during 10 o'clocks if you didn't ha\
Tlie Daily?

Unless I'm mistaken, I've got my picture with
the column this morning. Yep—l'm right. Hello,
vou grinning fool.
So many people wrote in asking if I had two
heads that the editor decided to run a picture.
To those of you who wrote, and who now look
at the picture. I point out that I do not have two
heads. In this case even one is a superfluity.
A guy by the name of Stan Marcus took this

picture. He's a good photographer,
they say.
Three people have already asked
me if I had ulcers and Reader's]
Digest wants to run the picture!
over an article called "Constip^- 1
tion Can Be Cured "
I was going to hold out for a •
Lord Calvert picture, and, as a
matter of fact, had a bottle of Coke
in my hand at the time the picture
was taken, only vou can't see it
from where you're standing.

Actually the little pictures on the Editorial Page
are a part of The Daily's new lo«-k. and there
haven't been as many comments about The Daily as
I expected.
The Roth House hashers wrote in to say that
The Daily had outlived its usefulness—that the paper
was no longer big enough to line garbage cans.
On the other hand, another group, who shall be
nameless, wrote to say that The Daily was now
more valuable than ever—seems that they fold it
once vertically and it just fits on their roll.
If the latter fad gets around, we'll have to print
every third issue on Scott's Tissue.
Of course the real reason for the change in for
mat is two-fjld.
First, it supposedly makes The Daily easier to
read at breakfast and in classes

I don't know about this. I used to turn one pag«
in order to get to the sport page. Now I have t>
flip through five pages of SIRO. lIR, ICC, NSA, an
Henry Wallace before I can find out how far in th.
cellar the team is. And all of this causes a disturb
ing noise in class.
Still they say the paper is easier to handle.
I say there is too much folding ,and point to th
California traveling salesman who flipped his li.
trying to fold a road map back into the little packe
it came in.
The second reason for the new look is that i
gives the new editor something to do.
Each new editor changes something around s
he won't look like the last editor.
Last year, for example, someone yanked th
editorials off of page two and put them on the la.-
page. This was hailed as the greatest change 1
editorials since Brisbane discovered 12-point type
Nobody has given the Editorial Page muc
thought except the people who write it, so the thin
has stayed put, but someone will come along an
put editorials back inside the paper, mark my won
The only thing that hasn't changed about Th
Daily in the past five years is the price. It's sti
free, and a darn good thing.
The stability of The Daily's retail price confirn
a secret report we had from Raymond Moley th;
the price of diamonds hasn't changed much sine
