# Crew Dunked As Shell Sinks
## 
### 
Stanford crew's "Washing- i
tonian" floundered and sank
Friday, casting nine members
of the freshman crew into the
wind-swept waters of San Fran
cisco Bay.
After a 40-minute exposure to I
the icy water, the freshmen were
rescued by the crew of a cabin !
cruiser.
Crew members of the "Washing
tonian," formerly the varsity shell, i
were taking a trial run from the
outer Dolphin buoy to the Dumbar
ton Bridge, when high waves swept
the craft, submerging it.
Members of the crew were Don
McKenzie, coxswain, John Hallo
way, A 1 Snyder, Don Casey, Wallv
White, Don Craven, Chuck Palmer.
McGregor Church, and Andy Field. •
They were taken to the Palo Alto
Hospital for emergency treatment
but were released immediately when
it was decided that they suffered no
physical harm from the dousing.
ALL OAKS SAVED
All eight oars were saved from •
the "Washingtonian," which was
found in damaged condition on a
shoal Saturday afternoon.
The rescue cruiser was manned
by Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Savage. Ar
thur C. Morgan, and Miss Julia
Lauchere of San Jose. Savage and
Morgan are instructors at San Jose
Technical High School.
Varsity crew members, headed
by Frosh Coach Bill Morrow, were
preparing a search party when the
crew arrived back at the harbor. I
NOT EVEN A SNIFFLE
The eight freshmen rowed their
customary 10 miles yesterday morn
ing, without a sniffle to show for
their Friday bath.
The mishap came on the heels of '
several favorable developments for 1
the Card crew. Last fall two new j
shells were donated anonymously,
and last month the ASSU provided
funds for a coach's launch.
Sophomore crew members expe
rienced a similar upset in the shell
"Sierra" during an inter-class race
last spring, but were rescued by j
the crews of near-by launches.

Time Schedules for spring quar
ter are now available in the Ad
ministration Building.
