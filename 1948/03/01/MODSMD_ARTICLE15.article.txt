LOS ANGELES, Feb. 29 (UP).—
The Navy, which unveiled its new
FJ-1 jet fighters just a week ago.
limbered up three of them by set
ting new speed records from Seattle
to three California cities.
A fourth record attempt — from
San Francisco to Los Angeles—was
postponed because of aileron dam
age suffered by Lt. Cmdr. R. N.
Elder's plane on a one-hour, 21-
minute flight from Seattle to San
Francisco.
RECORDS ARE:
The records chalked up were
E'der's flight to San Francisco, for
which there was no previous offi
cial mark; a one-hour, 58-minute,
seven-second flight from Seattle to
Los Angeles by Cmdr 4 E. P. Aurand,
breaking the old mark by 16 min
utes; and Lt. Cmdr. John J. Magda's
flight in two hours, 12 minutes. 54
seconds from Seattle to San Diego,
for which there was no previous of
ficial record.
Elder hoped to get his plane fixed
in time to try the San Francisco-
Los Angeles flight tomorrow. The
current record of 42 minutes, 33 sec
onds was set by Army Lt. Claude L.
Wolford Jan. 17. 1946, in an Army
P-80. A P-80 also set the old rec
ord from Seattle to Los Angeles, a
two-hour, 14-minute mark chalked
up April 6, 1946, by Army Capt.
Mack A. Mitchel.
AVERAGE SPEEDS
Aurand averaged slightly faster
than 475 miles an hour on his 950-
mile flight from Seattle and hit a
top speed of 5550 miles an hour
shortly before landing. The 31-
year-old New York native said the
trip was "perfect," made mostly at
25,000 feet.
Magda, whose parents live in
Louisville, Ky.. flew at 35,000 on
most of his run to San Diego, av
eraging 485 miles an hour in his
sleek North American Jet and hit

by thousands of civilians lining the
North Island field for an open house
as he swooshed past the tower a
bare 200 feet oft' the ground.
