# 'Communistic' Charge Faces Stars & Stripes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 (UP) —
Rep. John McDowell, R., Pa., said
today Ihe House committee on Un-
American Activities may consider
charges that the European edition
of Stars and Stripes is printing com
munist propaganda.
The charges were made in a House
speech by Rep. George A. Dondero.
R„ Mich. He said the army papei
carries stories that are "pro-Soviet,
pro-communist, and anti-American."
McDowell, a member of the Un-
American Activities group, said he
will go over with Dondero in the
next day or two evidence on which
he based his complaint.
"If the charge appears to hold
water I will put it before the com
mittee for investigation," McDowell
said. He added that most of the
Stars and Stripes personnel he had
known appeared to be "good, hon
est, hardworking newspapermen—
no different from those in the House
press gallery."
The Army Department has cabl
ed an account of Dondero's accusa
tion to Gen. Lucius D. Clay, Ameri
can occupation commander in Ger
many. The service newspaper is
under Clay's jurisdiction. It identi
fies itself as the "unofficial publica
tion of the United States occupation
forces in Europe." Another edition
is published in Tokyo.
Dondero said he had studied foui
copies of the service paper. In then 1
he said he found stories that make
grist for the communist mill, or af
ford valuable intelligence informa
tion to the Russians.
He read to the House samples of
the material to which he objected
"It will be said that most of these
stories are Press Association dis
patches for which the staff of Stars
and Stripes is not responsible, he
said. "The question is, however, why
were they selected and by whom and
why was not a reply of some kind
added."
One story carried a CIO criticism
of President Truman's commission
on universal training, he said. The
views of the commission were not
presented, he asserted.
Dondero continued:
"On page two of the same issue
we find a cartoon by Bill Maul dir.
showing a drunken American speak
ing to a youngster as follows: 'You
kids are the only hope for a shick
soshiety.'
"What grist this makes for the
communist propaganda mill!"
Dondero objected to stories which
he said were favorable to several
persons in the occupation zone whom
he had criticized earlier as lelt
wingers. These persons were furn
ished with "generous space" to an
swer the charges, he said.
"In other words, a congressman
elected by the people of the United
States is placed upon a par before
American soldiers with persons wh>
have clearly provable communist
records," he added.
He described as a "very valuable
piece of intelligence information for
the Russians" a story quoting John
Nicholas Brown, asssistant Navy
Secretary for Air, as saying the atom
bomb would be of little immediat;
use to the United States if wai
came now.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 (UP) —
Rep. John McDowell, R., Pa., said
today Ihe House committee on Un-
American Activities may consider
charges that the European edition
of Stars and Stripes is printing com
munist propaganda.
The charges were made in a House
speech by Rep. George A. Dondero.
R„ Mich. He said the army papei
carries stories that are "pro-Soviet,
pro-communist, and anti-American."
McDowell, a member of the Un-
American Activities group, said he
will go over with Dondero in the
next day or two evidence on which
he based his complaint.
"If the charge appears to hold
water I will put it before the com
mittee for investigation," McDowell
said. He added that most of the
Stars and Stripes personnel he had
known appeared to be "good, hon
est, hardworking newspapermen—
no different from those in the House
press gallery."
The Army Department has cabl
ed an account of Dondero's accusa
tion to Gen. Lucius D. Clay, Ameri
can occupation commander in Ger
many. The service newspaper is
under Clay's jurisdiction. It identi
fies itself as the "unofficial publica
tion of the United States occupation
forces in Europe." Another edition
is published in Tokyo.
Dondero said he had studied foui
copies of the service paper. In then 1
he said he found stories that make
grist for the communist mill, or af
ford valuable intelligence informa
tion to the Russians.
He read to the House samples of
the material to which he objected
"It will be said that most of these
stories are Press Association dis
patches for which the staff of Stars
and Stripes is not responsible, he
said. "The question is, however, why
were they selected and by whom and
why was not a reply of some kind
added."
One story carried a CIO criticism
