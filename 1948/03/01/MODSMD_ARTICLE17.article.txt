## 
### 
JERUSALEM, Feb. 29 (UP).—
Twenty-eight British soldiers were
killed and 33 were injured today
when three coaches of the Cairo-
Haifa Express were blown up by
electrically detonated mines in east
ern Palestine.
Nine Jews died in other Holy
Land violence, bringing the day's
death toll to at. least 37.
British troops began a thorough
"screening" campaign in the train
explosion area in an effort to find
those responsible. Police suspected
Jews of setting off the explosion in
reprisal for last Sunday's Ben Ye
huda Street bombing in which at
least 51 persons were killed.
COUNCIL MEETS
Eliezer Perelson, acting mayor of
the all-Jewish community of Tel-
Aviv, told a meeting of the munici
pal council that whoever set the
train blast was "besmirching the
Jewish name while the people's fate
is in the balance."
After the Ben Yehuda Street ex
plosion, which occurred at exactly
the same hour last Sunday, Jews
claimed the British were respon
sible, but the Arabs said their "com
mandos" did the job.
100-POUND CHARGES
Today's train explosion occurred
near Rehovoth, a citrus township on
the Cairo-Haifa rail line in eastern
Palestine. The saboteurs placed four
100-pound charges between the rails
so that one would explode under
each of four troop-carrying coaches.
Three of the charges went off, but
the fourth failed to explode.
The soldiers aboard the train were
on their way back to Palestine after
spending their leave in Britain.
