debaters are again respected along
the coast as keen competition after
seven years of silence due to the
war. Having succeeded so well at
Denver and Linfield. we expect to
take our share of the honors at the
spring meeting at College of the Pa

major and minor Western schools
will be represented.
TEAM DEBATES TULSA
Tulsa University, which has an
outstanding debate record but which
was defeated early in the Linfield
contest, has asked to meet Stanford
debaters here this week. Bennett
said.
'"Indian debaters," Bennett said,
"have already begun preparing on
the general topic of French current
problems for the annual Joffre de
bate with the University of Califor
nia. It is the last and most impor
tant debate of the year, the talking
equivalent of the Big Game.
