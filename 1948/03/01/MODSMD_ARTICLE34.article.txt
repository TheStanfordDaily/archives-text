# Benny's Maxwell Is Luxurious Next to Ancient Farm Jalopies

### AL BERRY 
lis mother was a Buick and its
father was a Ford. It was con
ceived by virtue of a head-on
collision at a busy intersection.
It is held together by a thousand
coats of bright red paint, and when
it runs it sounds like the ghosts of
Sheridan's cavalry running rampant
over a tin roof. It is -a Stanford
institution, a Stanford tradition.
This most familiar, if not most
typical, of the Stanford mobile junk
heaps is the Kappa Sig's bus. The
Bus was constructed some 25 years
ago by the White Automotive Com
pany, and it has spent most of its
career as a sight-seeing bus in Yel
lowstone National Park. It was in
Yellowstone that Kappa Sig Bob
Perry met the bus and fell "madly
in love with her."
Alter the exchange of a few green
backs the bus became the property
of Perry and the pride and joy of
Kappa Sigma. The men use the "old
crate" less than they would like to
because there are only a few broth
ers in the house who know how to
navigate it. And at six miles to a
gallon, it won't go very far on fifty
cents worth of gasoline.
LOYAL TO KAPPA SIC,
In the year that the Bus has been
mistress to the Kappa Sigs only
one accident has marred her record
of loyalty. Last quarter, after a foot
ball game, the troops were returning
from a small drinking contest at a
local establishment.
Eighteen voices were crying out
to the world the laurels of a cer
tain friar of great renown. The Bus
was top-heavy; a curve was sharp;
then the pavement was covered with
singing Kappa Sigs, and the old Bus
was lying frustratedly on its .side.
The men got on one side and lifted,
and the Bus was righted and soon
on its way.
CARD SHUFFLE PRODUCT
Last quarter another Stanford ja
lopy hit the headlines. The Junior
Class dance, the Card Shuffle, raf
fled off a shiny, red Model T Ford.
The new owners of the gem, Bar
bara Elliot and Dave Caldwell,
promptly christened Mr. Ford's fin
est, "Beetlebop," and it was in
stantly the first love of the girl at
Elm Cottage.
But evidently "Bettlebop!" did not
care for Miss Elliott or the kindly
care of Villager Caldwell. "Bettle
bop!" died.
It now sits behind a Village bar
racks. Its paint job is beginning to
dull; the wild clatter of its engine
no longer fills the air. Miss Elilott
is looking for buyers.

crate" less than they would like to

cents worth of gasoline.
LOYAL TO KAPPA SIC,
In the year that the Bus has been
mistress to the Kappa Sigs only
one accident has marred her record
of loyalty. Last quarter, after a foot
ball game, the troops were returning
from a small drinking contest at a
local establishment.
Eighteen voices were crying out
to the world the laurels of a cer
tain friar of great renown. The Bus
was top-heavy; a curve was sharp;
then the pavement was covered with
singing Kappa Sigs, and the old Bus
was lying frustratedly on its .side.
The men got on one side and lifted,
and the Bus was righted and soon
on its way.
CARD SHUFFLE PRODUCT
Last quarter another Stanford ja
lopy hit the headlines. The Junior
Class dance, the Card Shuffle, raf
fled off a shiny, red Model T Ford.
The new owners of the gem, Bar
bara Elliot and Dave Caldwell,
promptly christened Mr. Ford's fin
est, "Beetlebop," and it was in
stantly the first love of the girl at
Elm Cottage.
But evidently "Bettlebop!" did not
care for Miss Elliott or the kindly
care of Villager Caldwell. "Bettle
bop!" died.
It now sits behind a Village bar
racks. Its paint job is beginning to
dull; the wild clatter of its engine
no longer fills the air. Miss Elilott
is looking for buyers.

lis mother was a Buick and its
father was a Ford. It was con
ceived by virtue of a head-on
collision at a busy intersection.
It is held together by a thousand
coats of bright red paint, and when
it runs it sounds like the ghosts of
Sheridan's cavalry running rampant
over a tin roof. It is -a Stanford
institution, a Stanford tradition.
This most familiar, if not most
typical, of the Stanford mobile junk
heaps is the Kappa Sig's bus. The
Bus was constructed some 25 years
ago by the White Automotive Com
pany, and it has spent most of its
career as a sight-seeing bus in Yel
lowstone National Park. It was in
Yellowstone that Kappa Sig Bob
Perry met the bus and fell "madly
in love with her."
Alter the exchange of a few green
backs the bus became the property
of Perry and the pride and joy of
Kappa Sigma. The men use the "old
