# Last Rehearsal For 'Cyrano' begins Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford Players' production
of Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano de
Bergerac" goes into final rehearsal
this week. The opening curtain will
go up Thursday evening at 8:15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Utilizing the Brian Hooker trans
lation, written directly for stage
production, the play will preserve
the original Rostand meters and
rhyme schemes, but will turn to
more modern blank verse for the
dialogue.
With over 70 parts in the pro
duction, members of the Stanford
Players will each do more than one
characterization.
Wendell Cole, instructor in speech
and drama, will adapt the Memorial
Auditorium to the seventeenth-cen
tury background. Included in the
sets will be a theater, a bake shop,
a cloister, and a battlefield.
Costumes for the show have been
designed by Virginia Opsvig, in
structor in speech and drama.
Lighting will be supervised by
James McCulloch, technical direc
tor in speech and drama, while
Leonard Ratner, instructor in music,
will direct the incidental music.
Veteran Stanford Player Roy
Poole and newcomer Priscilla
Pointer will appear as Cyrano and
Roxane.
Approximately 200 tickets are
available for both the Thursday and
Saturday performances, with 100
remaining for Friday night. Tickets
may be purchased in room 200, Me
morial Hall, for 90 cents, or reserved
bv calling Palo Alto 22041.
