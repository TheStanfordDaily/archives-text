# Soccermen Lose, 4 to 2; Ramblers Down Ruggers
## 
### 
Although observers described the
contest as the best turned in by the
Stanford soccerites this year, the
Farm men dropped a 4 to 2 thriller
to the Mexico Athletic Club on the
Joeal field Saturday.
A fine passing offense coupled
with the sparkling individual play
of Ara Gaulstrum gave the Cards a
2 to 1 lead at hall time. Tallies by
Stan Hodge and Kick Trejos, scored
early in the period, provided the
Farm shinkickers with a lead that
was not relinquished until midway
in the second canto.
The Indians played together so
well in the first hall that the club
men found it hard to bring the ball
into Stanford territory for more
than a few minutes at a time.
Gaulstrum was easily the best
man on the field. He stole the ball
time after time and set up many
{.hots for his teammates.
Pat McDonnell, Card fullback,
ilso turned in a fine performance
in keeping the ball out of Farm ter
ritory'.

A last-half rally by the Menlo
ruggers overcame an early Stan
ford lead and gave the Ramblers a
14 to 8 victory Saturday morning.
The contest was a practice game and
consequently does not affect league
standings.
The Indians took a 5 to 0 lead in
the first half when Ray Folks scored
and Ed Culin added the conversion.
In the second half Sharky Don
aldson broke loose and went 50
yards to score for Menlo. The con
version attempt was wide. A few
minutes later Culin made good on
a penalty kick and Stanford had an
8 to 3 bulge.
Then the Ramblers started to roll.
Jack Eldridge climaxed a long drib
bling rush by carrying the ball
across for the try.
Menlo took the lead shortly
thereafter when Sonnickson made
good on a penalty kick. The final
Menlo try came in the closing min
utes of play when Bill Saltus went
70 yards to score.
