## '51 QUINTET Frosh Cagers Win and Lose 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team split a two - game weekend
schedule, winning over Mission
High School 48 to 20 and dropping
a close 43 to 42 decision to Lowell
High School.
Friday's contest with Mission,
close lor the first quarter, turned
into a rout of the Bears in the sec
ond per! d with the combined ef
forts of Marvin Gelber and Paul
Watson putting the yearlings far
into th? lead.
FROSH TOO TALL
Captain Dick Clegg played his
best game of the year under the
boards against the shorter Mission
lads. Coach Lloyd Lieth's team had
nary one six-footer and the hustling
City boys couldn't overcome that
handicap. Paul Watson and substi
tute Jack Mc√üirney were high for
the frosh, with nine points apiece.
Lowell's Indians proved to be of
tougher fiber on Saturday and after
36 minutes of play, during which
time the score was tied eight times,
emerged victorious, 43 to 42.
FROSH LEAD AT HALF
Stanford guard Gelber started the
scoring with a two-handed set shot
from outside the foul circle and
irom there on the game was nip and
tuck. Paul Watson meshed a one
handed push shot in the closing
minutes of the first half to provide
the Cards with a 21 to 19 half-time
lead.
With the count knotted at 39 all
and less than two minutes to play,
Ciegg tipped in a follow on Gelber's
shot. Gelber hit a free throw to
make it 12 to 39, but little Glyfkides
put in a basket from far out and.
with but 30 seconds left, Flowers
sealed up a Lowell win with an
under-and-up two-pointer.
Gelber's 12 points paced the frosh,
followed by Paul Watson's 11.
