## Tribe Babes Edge Links 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball -
ers staggered through to a 7 to (i
triumph over Lincoln High of San
Francisco on the frosh diamond Sat
urday but not before a four - run
rally by the visitors in the ninth
had made things uncomfortable for
ihe Tribe.
A walk followed by a single, an
error, another walk, a hit batter,
and a long double to left pushed
across four markers and left run
ners on second and third before
third sacker Sal Coletto grabbed a
pop-up to end the threat and insure
victory.
Up to the near-disastrous ninth
the Cardinals had pecked away at
the offerings of three Link hurlers
for nine hits while building up a
seemingly comfortable 7 to 2 lead.
Triples by Denny Tuffanelli and
John Herbold and a long homer to
center by Dick Vande were the big
factors in the Card attack.
Lefty Lloyd Westphal started on
the mound for the frosh but after
pitching three-hit ball for six in
nings suddenly tired in the seventh
and gave up three more before Tuf
fanelli came in to relieve and finish
out the game.
The freshmen will meet Jefferson
High of Daly City on the freshman
diamond at 3 this afternoon. The
Jeffs have lost 6 to 0 to Balboa and
have whipped the Links 2 to 1, both
of which teams the frosh have
beaten.
