PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Feb. 29
(UP). —Premier Klement Gottwald
called today for a high-pressure re
cruiting drive to increase Commu
nist party ranks by 600,000 before
May 1. Simultaneously his action
committees moved to purge "nega
tive" members of Parliament, the
courts, opposition parties, and sports
organizations.
Gottwald, in a special appeal for
larger party membership printed by
the Communist newspaper Rudd
Lravo, noted that the goal of 1,500,-
000 Communists originally set for
May Day has almost been reached,
and set a new mark of 2,000,000 to
be reached by the Red holiday. The
party now has 1,400,000 members.
RECRUITING DRIVE
The central committee of the par
ty designated the week of March 7
to 15 as "Gottwald Week" and
scheduled an intensive recruiting
drive for that period.
March 7 is the anniversary of the
death of Thomas G. Masaryk, the
"George Washington" of Czechoslo
vakia." and March 15 is the anni
versary of the Nazi occupation of
the country in 1939.
Gottwald also spoke at the closing
session of the two-day meeting of
the National Peasant Congress, re
newing the promise he made yester
day that all farms larger than 124
acres would be cut up among small
farmers.
•NEGATIVES' PURGED
The redistributed estates would
be owned privately, he said, to
"make sure that no one can ever
again lie to you about their being
any kolkhozes (Soviet-style collec
tive farms) here."
The central action committee
formed in last week's lightning
Communist coup formally declared
itself "the center of all public life"
and set up a commission to "cleanse
(non-Communist) parties of the en
emies of the people's democratic re
gime."
The Ministry of Justice announced
that "persons who did not have a
positive attitude . . . have been re
moved from the judicial service,"
and the parliamentary action com
mittee said that "certain selected
members of Parliament" had been
invited to join an uncritical pro
government majority.
SPORTS CLEANSED'
Simultaneously, associations in
nearly every branch of Czechoslo
vak sport announced that they had
formed action committees to purge
persons lacking a positive attitude
or would soon do so.
The Sports Journalists' Associa
tion has recommended that the na
tional newspapermen's organization
oust three sports editors, in addition
to newspapermen already ex
pelled.
JOURNALISTS OUSTED
The action committee of the Jour
nalists' Association confirmed yes
terday's reports that 63 newspaper
men in Prague and the provinces
had been expelled from the asso
ciation.
The Ministry of Information an
nounced that it would go into the
newspaper business, beginning to
morrow. with the first Monday pa
per which has been published in
Prague since the end of the war.
