# Double Defeat Puts Indians in Cellar
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Stanford gained undisputed possession of the southern divi
sion cellar over the weekend, dropping a sad 34 to 46 contest
to USC Friday night and a 46 to 48 double overtime to UCLA.
The Indians will meet California, still undefeated in confer
ence play, this week in their final games of the year.

The Bruin game was close all the
way, with the teams never separated
by more than four points. Captain
Johnny Stanich won the game for
the Udans with a short one-hander
at 4:15 of the second overtime.
The regulation game ended at 41-
all after Steve Stephenson had
brought the Indians from three
points behind with a field goal and
free throw with less than two min
utes to play. Each team scored five
points in the first overtime, and
Stanich's shot was the only score
in the second extra period.
Dave Minor was the Westwood
ers' big gun. pushing through five
shots and converting seven of 10
free throws for 17 points. Morley
Thompson and Stephenson led the
Indians with 11 and 10 respectively.
I SC GAME NO CONTEST'
The less said about Friday night's
game, the better. The Trojans went
ahead, 8 to 2. at 7:30 of the first
half, and from that point is was no
contest. Southern Cal led 22 to 9
at the half. Stanford was able to
score only two field goals in the
first period.
At 9:00 of the second half USC
took a 20-point lead, which was
whittled down to 12 at the end of
the game mainly through the efforts
of Gus Chavaias and Milt Iverson.
TROJANS HIT LONG ONES
The Trojans' uncanny ability to
hit long setshots was matched by
Stanford's equally uncanny knack
of missing shots from anywhere.
Tubby forward Abe Androff, sink
ing 25-foot one-handers from ev
erywhere on the court, was the
leading USC scorer with 16 points.
Androff got lots of scoring assist
ance from Fred Bertram and Bill
Sharman, and big Alex Hannum
dominated both backboards. Iver
son was the only Indian to break
into two figures, scoring 10 points.
All in all. it was a far from satis
factory pair of games. Friday night
Stanford looked dead. The Indians
couldn't penetrate the Southern Cal
man-to-man defense and were in
effective on the boards. They col
lected only nine goals from the field.
Saturday night was somewhat
better. The Cards led at the half
1 y three points as Thompson, Iver
son, and Bill Rose found their

shooting eyes temporarily. This
lead was maintained through 15
minutes of the second period despite
only three field soals. The Indians
made good 80 per cent of their free
throws.
