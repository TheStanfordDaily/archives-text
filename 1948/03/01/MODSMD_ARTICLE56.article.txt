# Mermen Sink Olympic Club; Anderson Sets Pool Record
## 
### 
Taking first place in all but two
events, Stanford's varsity swimming
team easily defeated the Olympic
Club squad. 43 to 1)2, in a non-con
ference meet held Friday night at
the Winged "O" pool.
Ralph Sala and Captain Bob An
derson paced the Indian victory,
each winning two events. Sala nosed
out the Club's Fred Taioli in the
200-yard freestyle lace, and then
returned to cop the quarter - mile
event easily.
Anderson showed that he had re
turned to his old form by setting a
new pool record in the 100 - yard
sprint, after he had won the shorter,
50-yard, race easily. Bob's time of
:52.6 was nearly a second under the
old pool figure.
The hosts' first victory came in
the diving event, with Clubman
Dick Mobley noseing out Louis
Fentnor for first-place honors. The
Winged "O" freestyle relay team
edged the Farm team of Harry Bor
chers, Ed Major, Warren Cutting,
and Woody Hoogs by a scant two
yards for a seven-point victory in
the 400-yard event.
Indian Jack Weeden turned the
tables on his brother A 1 in the 150-

ward backstroke race. Harry Et -
chers was third.
Don Hester won the 200 - yard
breaststroke race in 2:34.2.
Outside of Anderson's new lOC
yard freestyle mark, the timeii
turned in by the Indian swimmers
were generally slow, which may be
attributed in part to the Indians'
unfamiliarity with the odd-sized,
salt-water-filled Olympic Club pool.
In the first day of the Call-Bulle
tin Northern California swimming
and diving championships, held Sat
urday and Sunday in the Crystal
Plunge pool, Bob Anderson cap
tured the 100-yard freestyle title,
and Jack Weeden won the 100-yard
backstroke event.
