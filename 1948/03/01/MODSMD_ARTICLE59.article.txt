## Orchids and Questions

The School of Mineral Sciences celebrated its first birthday
last Thursday by opening its doors to hundreds of persons from
throughout the Bay Area. Some visitors came from as far away
as San Francisco and San Jose; none were disappointed.
The fact that so many people came—and enjoyed—the open
house shows what can be done. Ordinarily, one thinks of a
rock and shell exhibit as something pretty dull, but we don't
think anyone was bored Thursday evening.
Would it be possible for other schools at Stanford to follow
the lead set by the University's newest school? Perhaps other
departments could not stage as big or elaborate displays, but
nevertheless, all have enough material to put on a good exhibit.
What's the point to having an open house? We'll bet Thurs
day's open house gained more respect for and interest in the
School of Mineral Sciences than a dozen research projects or
illustrated pamphlets. Such good-will pays off to Stanford and
more especially to the School of Mineral Sciences.
