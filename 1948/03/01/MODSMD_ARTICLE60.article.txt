# CAMPUS OPINION
## WCC Resolutions 
### 
To the Editor:
On Thursday, February 26, Stanford students voted on 32 Western
College Congress Recommendations. It might be more aptly said that
the students were subjected to the most ambiguous, irresolute, and equivo
cal group of recommendations we have ever encountered.
The language in which the questions were posed is not worthy of a
high school freshman, who at least is taught to be clear and concise.
Take the first question, for example:
"Should the United States take no steps in the strengthening
of the territorial defenses of any nation except through the United
Nations?"
It simply asks whether the U.S. should strengthen the "territorial
defenses" of countries through the UN. But the question is counched in
the most incomprehensible terms; it is stated in the negative so that
i person who wants to vote "yes" has to vote "no, and vice versa.
Surley the author of this question could have found better terms in
which to state it.
Some of the questions contain more than one single proposal, and
cannot be answered either by "yes" or "no.' Question 31:
"Would you recommend that American forces remain in occu
pation of Japan with the military taking a subordinate role to
a UN economic and political council?'
This really contains two proposals: a) Should the American army
occupy Japan, and b) -if so, should the army be subject to a UN council.
Furthermore, just what does this "subordinate role" signify? How can
we honestly state our opinions if the questions are so poorly formed.
Other questions are so unrealistic as to be totally without value. Rec
ommendation 21 asks whether Germany should be permitted "to manu
facture 'direct' military equipment." We have not heard anyone. Ameri
can, Russian, or Colombian, whoever made this proposal. Yet we are
asked to vote on it. Question 15, concerning the disposition of Pomerania
and Upper Silesia, is so esoteric as to be worthless. Really, how many
students, who ever know where these territories are. can be expected
to know enough about the complex issues involved to make an intelligent
answer?
Having students vote on the Western College Congress Recommenda
tions, is an excellent idea. Perhaps in the future the execution ot the
idea will be better than it is at present.
