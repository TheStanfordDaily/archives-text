# Foreign Scholarhips
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Reading yesterday's Daily certainly shocked me to the fact that even
on the Stanford campus we have a negative approach to the question oi
ioreign scholarships. Mr. Martzloff at the last Excom meeting seemed
feci that this piogram of foreign scholarships would cost too much money.
Now, is it. Mr. and Mrs. Stanford Student, too much trouble and too
much money to buy some international good feeling? Anything that we
at Stanford can do to sow good relations with foreign countries is a
worthwhile undertaking.
I leave you with the question which is more importantâ€”saving money
for our own enjoyment or buying good-will for peace so that future of
our children may be secure?
ALFRED JOHN'SON.
