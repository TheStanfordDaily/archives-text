Portal-to-Portal Suits
PITTSBURGH (UP) —Charles A. Margiotti is try
ing to breathe new life into outlawed portal-to-portal
pay suits. As a counsel for labor, he is armed with
40.000 powers-of-attorney. He will file appeals from
previous dismissals with the Third Circuit Court
in Philadelphia.
Margiotti will try to prove:
1. That the portal act of 1947 is unconstitutional
because it deprives a worker the right to seek redress.
2. That hundreds of thousands of workers have
done overtime in the nation's mills and factories
without '"just compensation."
The former Pennsylvania attorney-general was
hired by individual workers, most of them members
of the CIO United Steelworkers, from Carnegie-
Illinois Steel Corp., Sharon Steel Corp., National
Tube Co., and the Homestead Valve Manufacturing
Co. They seek nearly $245,000,000 in back pay and
damages.
The USW, bound under contract not to "support
future or existing claims," has endorsed independ
ent action by its members because it feels strongly
that the portal law is a "violation of the principles
of our constitution."
Not all of the suits up for appeal will be heard,
however. Margiotti. who considers them too bulky
to be handled jointly, has picked the 8180.000,000
suit against Carnegie-Illinois as the "test" case.
Partal-tSo-portal claim*; constitute a fantastic
period in court history in which workers sought
nearly 56.000.000.000 in compensation for on-the
premise walking time, time spent changing clothes,
and a host of other alleged non-productive activities.
"During the war," Margiotti emphasized, "many
plants left only one gate open for security reasons.
That meant a worker sometimes walked an extra
mile.
"When he got to the gate he fell in line behind
hundreds of others to be checked off by plant guards.
And still he had to punch the time clock at his reg
ular hour."
Margiotti said most workers were required to
change into special .safety clothes. Some, he said,
spent a half hour before and after work sharpening
tools.
We're not interested in matters which concern
only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the
scheduled working hours," Margiotti said. "We're
after the overtime that runs into hours."
The suits have their legal foundation under the
fair labor standards act (wage and hour law) of
1933. The act said in a later amendment that over
time should be paid for "hours worked" after 40
hours. But the claims became a national headache
when the Supreme Court ruled in the Mt. Clemens
(Mich.) Pottery Co. case that workers could sue for
portal-to-portal compensation.
The subsequent portal law bans existing claims,
except those compensable to employes through
contract, custom or practice. The ban includes
activities taking place during the workday as well
as before and after, and covers the wage-hour law.

nearly 56.000.000.000 in compensation for on-the
premise walking time, time spent changing clothes,
and a host of other alleged non-productive activities.
"During the war," Margiotti emphasized, "many
plants left only one gate open for security reasons.
That meant a worker sometimes walked an extra
mile.
"When he got to the gate he fell in line behind
hundreds of others to be checked off by plant guards.
And still he had to punch the time clock at his reg
ular hour."
Margiotti said most workers were required to
change into special .safety clothes. Some, he said,
spent a half hour before and after work sharpening
tools.
We're not interested in matters which concern
only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the
scheduled working hours," Margiotti said. "We're
after the overtime that runs into hours."
The suits have their legal foundation under the
fair labor standards act (wage and hour law) of
1933. The act said in a later amendment that over
time should be paid for "hours worked" after 40
hours. But the claims became a national headache
when the Supreme Court ruled in the Mt. Clemens
(Mich.) Pottery Co. case that workers could sue for
portal-to-portal compensation.
The subsequent portal law bans existing claims,
except those compensable to employes through
contract, custom or practice. The ban includes
activities taking place during the workday as well
as before and after, and covers the wage-hour law.

Portal-to-Portal Suits
PITTSBURGH (UP) —Charles A. Margiotti is try
ing to breathe new life into outlawed portal-to-portal
pay suits. As a counsel for labor, he is armed with
40.000 powers-of-attorney. He will file appeals from
previous dismissals with the Third Circuit Court
in Philadelphia.
Margiotti will try to prove:
1. That the portal act of 1947 is unconstitutional
because it deprives a worker the right to seek redress.
2. That hundreds of thousands of workers have
done overtime in the nation's mills and factories
without '"just compensation."
The former Pennsylvania attorney-general was
hired by individual workers, most of them members
of the CIO United Steelworkers, from Carnegie-
Illinois Steel Corp., Sharon Steel Corp., National
Tube Co., and the Homestead Valve Manufacturing
Co. They seek nearly $245,000,000 in back pay and
damages.
The USW, bound under contract not to "support
future or existing claims," has endorsed independ
ent action by its members because it feels strongly
that the portal law is a "violation of the principles
of our constitution."
Not all of the suits up for appeal will be heard,
however. Margiotti. who considers them too bulky
to be handled jointly, has picked the 8180.000,000
suit against Carnegie-Illinois as the "test" case.
Partal-tSo-portal claim*; constitute a fantastic
period in court history in which workers sought
nearly 56.000.000.000 in compensation for on-the
premise walking time, time spent changing clothes,
and a host of other alleged non-productive activities.
