Last November Excom approved and passed an
Honor Code Committee recommendation meant to
stop a long-neglected injustice on the Farm.
Committee Chairman Cal Newman told Excom
numerous fraternity and women's Row houses main
tained complete examination files that put the rest
of the student body at a distinct disadvantage. With
the high scholastic work required of students in
the last two years, the test files developed into a
tremendous asset tor a relatively small number of
students.
Following Excom approval of a measure author
izing the Honor Code Committee to direct filing of
all examination sheets in the library, Newman ap
pointed a subcommittee of three students to organ
ize past tests for library files.
With Bobbie Lipp as chairman, Ruth Jones and
Ken Cundy are contacting all University depart
ments for back examination questions. Tentative
plans call for having secretaries organize all tests
given within their departments. Representatives of
the Honor Code Committee will call for the tests
at the department offices. After examinations are
gathered from all the departments, the quizes will
go to the bindery.
Several problems Miss Lipp's committee must
tackle before a library examination file is available
include:
1. How should the tests be classified? Present
choices include filing examinations chronologically
or by subject.
2. What is the most efficient method for obtaining
test questions? If professors sent individual tests to
the library, the committee would face a confusion
of papers. If the departments will cooperate with
the committee, however, files can be gathered through
department offices.
3. Can a comprehensive test file be compiled?
Newman said the subcommittee intends to accum
ulate examinations extending over a number of quar
ters in previous years. Such files cannot be complete
with just one quarter's record, he said, and the
committee wants to make this project worthwhile
to the students.
4. Will students respect the test files? Though
they may be bound and shelved in the Reserve
Bookroom, examination questions are a temptation
to itchy-fingered students who want to increase
their own private files. The Law Library once main
tained an examination file, but the papers soon
disappeared.
Honor Code Committee's attempt to provide stu
dents an equal opportunity in examinations is an
example of negative legislation. The files are an evil
created to eliminate another evil. Knowledge should
come from books, not past exams. Enforcing an up
to-date exam file, however, bears more practicality
than destroying Row files.
