## Bull Session

Well. I've been meeting 1948 eye to eye for the
past eight weeks, and so far it shapes up to be just
another year.
Boy Scout Week came and went just like any
other year. Europeans are starving to death just
like last year. They had a Sadie Hawkins dance,
just like 1944 which was also a leap year. I didn't
get invited to that one either. Same old year.
Only one thing seems to be different. All the
clocks are running on 59 1 j cycles instead of 60 This

means that your electric clock is
losing about six minutes each
day.
One way of figuring what time
it is, is to set your clock each
morning at eight. Then whenever
you look at the clock during the
day substract eight from what
ever time it is. multiply by GO
and then by .004163. This will
give you the correct time, but by
the time you figure it out you

will probably bo late to wherever you were going
anyway.
Besides this means you have to set your clock
every morning at eight. That just isn't going to be
worth it for a lot of you I know.
Coming to up to school the other morning on the
train, I asked the conductor what time we were
going to get into Palo Alto.
"Well," he says, "about 7:50 by Pacific Time, un
less you're going by daylight saving time which
would be 8:50, unless of course you mean by my
electric clock time which would be about 7:45, unless
of course the train is 15 minutes late which it is."
I didn't make it to class on time, but then neither
did the professor.
I remember oack East they had an allotment
system for tardy? and absences. You were allowed
two flat tires per unit and one grandmother's fun

eral per course. Your Aunt Aggie could have cirrhosis
of the liver once per quarter, and a written state
ment from your doctor saying you were dead was
good for an excused absence anytime.
At Stanford you just kinda sneak into class late
and the professor gives you that "By Gawd. I made
it on time, you can, too" look. And if he demands
an explanation you've got the Honor Code staring
you in the face.
Eight o'clock classes are academic miscarriages
anyway. No one is supposed to think well until he's
had a cup of coffee.
I never can remember anything from eight o'clock
lectures. The words go in one ear and out the
other. Beer does the same thingâ€”more or less.
Speaking of mental activity, and now that the
Olympic Gaines are being held again, I wonder if
Los Angeles will pull some kind of a stunt like they
did in 1934.
In that year, when the athletic games were being
held in Berlin, LA suggested a mental Olympic
Games. Someone sponsored Einstein for the decath
lon, no one showed up and the whole thing fell
through like a bride's first cake.
The committee that was in charge was probably
put to work designing "Los Angeles City Limit"
signs, and everyone was happy.
The thing has possibilities though. I can't imag
ine the outcome of the 100-yard History. Or the
16-lb. Psychology. I suppose the winner of the one
mile Mathematics would get a gold slide rule. The
runner-up would get a box of Mars bars and two
tickets to Joel Kupperman.
Well, that was 11)34, and like I say, 1948 is just
another year. Time moves forward, and civilization
struggles to stay in one place.
I can't help but think that though the Egyptians
were called a civilized people, they are just as dead
today as the crudest savages of their time.
