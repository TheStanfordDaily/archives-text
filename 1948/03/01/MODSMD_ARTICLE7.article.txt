## 
### 
HELSINKI, Finland, Feb. 29 (UP)
â€”The government will ask Parlia
ment Tuesday whether all political
groups are ready to decide if nego
tiations should begin on the military
pact proposed last week by Soviet
Premier Josef Stalin, reliable
sources said today.
These sources said that the gov
ernment's request will be contained
in a carefully worded question
which is not phrased as a direct
query as to whether Parliament de
sires a defense pact with Russia or
not.
The question, according to these
sources, will be: "Is it the opinion
of all political groups that the pro
posed negotiations should be start
ed?"
NOTHING IMPLIED
It was pointed out that a negative
answer could not be construed as a
demonstration against Russia since
the government's question will im
ply nothing beyond its content.
However, none of the political
groups was expected to resist open
ing of negotiations.
None of the political parties, ex
cept the Communists, has officjally |
disclosed an attitude toward the j
pact and non - Communist party j
leaders refused to comment before j
the parliamentary discussions. All I
newspapers, except the Communist !
organs, avoided editorializing on the
pact today.
NEGOTIATIONS HERE
Highly placed, extremely trust
worthy sources said that the nego
tiations, if they take place, would
be held here.
Stalin's letter to President Judo
Paasikivi requesting the discussions
told the Finnish President that he
could decide whether they should
take place here or in Moscow.
Cay Sundstroem, Finnish minister
to Moscow, was delayed at Lenin
grad en route home today and was j
now expected to arrive in the Fin
nish capital late Monday. His re-";
port on the Russian attitude toward
the pact will be important in the
parliamentary debate Tuesday, ob- |
servers said.
