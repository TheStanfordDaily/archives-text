# Toyon Announces Room Priorities
## 
### 
Veterans who attended Stanford
prior to September, 1945, are being
given top priority in the assignment
of rooms at Toyon. The results of
the lottery to determine student pri
ority after the veterans have been
housed will be posted today in the
Nitery, in the Toyon office, and in
the office of the chief counselor for
men.
Available living spaces will be
assigned equally among three
groups: Stanford Village, off-cam
pus students, and the eating clubs.
Today's lottery results, however,
will affect only Village and off
campus students. The eating clubs
will hold a separate drawing to de
termine which of their members
will receive Toyon rooms.
Men whose jobs demand that they
live on campus, including Toyon
switchboard operators and head
hashers, are eligible for a special
Toyon priority list. Men with phys
ical disabilities that demand campus
residence are also eligible for this
list. Those who desire to be includ
ed on this list should see Shelton
Beatty, chief counselor for men, in
the Administration Building.
"This recent drawing is for spring
quarter only," said Frank Hubbard,
Toyon housing representative. A
new system will bo used next auar
ter to determine what men will fill
the 150 fall vacancies. Encina men
will be included in the new system.
