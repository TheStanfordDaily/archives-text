# Southerners Reject Truman Candidacy

ATLANTA, Ga. ( Mar. 1 (UP)—Democratic leaders of South Car
olina and Tennessee today turned thumbs down on Presides*.
Truman as the party's 1948 candidate for the White House.
At the same time, the Mississippi Democratic committee votec
to withdraw from the party's nominating convention in June unless

►it pledged itself to fight "anti-sou
thern" laws —that is President Tru
man's civil rights program.
South Carolina's renunciation of
a Democratic President was made
by the state's Democratic commit
tee. Tennessee's came from E. H.
Crump, head of the powerful Demo
cratic organization in Memphis and
Shelby County and recognized par
ty leader of the state.
SEPARATE CAMPAIGN
Both the South Carolina and Mis
sissippi committees voted to collec*.
political funds against the possibil
ity of a presidential campaign sep
arated from that of the Nationu
Democratic party.
"I will vote for a Democrat nex:
November," Crump said in Mem
phis, "but it will not be Truman."
The Crump forces, headed by Sen
Kenneth D. McKellar, led the figlv
against Mr. Truman at the Chicago
convention in 1944 when the late
President Roosevelt wanted him for
! vice - president. Mr. Truman was
nominated but the Tennessee dele
| gation held out until the bitter end
"COUNTRY OF COWARDS"
"In his scheming, cold-blooded ef
fort to outdo Henry Wallace and
Governor (Tom) Dewey of New
York for the Negro vote." Crump
said of the President, "he has en
! deavored to reduce the South to a
! country of crawling cowards."
He said Mr. Truman has "offered
! every insult and, of course, the Re
: publicans in Congress knowing how
I the South feels on these humiliating
: measures, cheerfully vote for them."
"If Truman is nominated at Phil
adelphia," Crump said, "Senator
Harry Byrd of Virginia, or some
other fine Democrat of his high cali
ber, and another good Southerner
would undoubtedly sweep the Sou
thern states.
"HONOR DEMANDS CHANGE"
"Our national honor demands a
j change. Whenever confidence and
respect fail, civilization crumbles."
Crump thus became the first of
' the so-called big Democratic "ma
j chine bosses" to denounce the ad
: ministration because of the Presi
| dent's civil rights program.
Neither the Mississippi nor South
Carolina committee barred the way
to eventual reconciliation with the
National Democratic leadership. But
both took a step that would be fun
damental in a real cleavage of the
party—arranging for finances to car
ry on independently.
