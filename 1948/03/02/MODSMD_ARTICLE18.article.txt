# Butter Prices Shoot Up
## 
### 
CHICAGO, March 1 (UP).â€”The
price of corn, wheat, oats, hogs, and
butler shot upward today in the
biggest food price upsurge since
commodity markets collapsed early
last month.
The government, which stepped
out of the market when prices broke
four weeks ago, stepped back in to
buy up a limited amount of flour for
export. The government's long
awaited resumption of buying was
like a shot in the arm.
On the Chicago Board of Trade,
corn hit the eight-cent limit in
crease at one point and close to

7 cents a bushel higher. Wheat for
delivery in both March and May
came within a fraction of a cent of
hitting the 10-cent limit increase for
a single day's trading.
Hog prices veered upward as
much as $2 per hundred pounds at
some cornbelt markets.
Despite the wholesale trend, one
large retail grocery chain in New
York cut the price of eggs and some
meats. Eggs were reduced two to
four cents a dozen. Veal cuts, bo
logna, and pork sausage were cut
three to four cents a pound.
