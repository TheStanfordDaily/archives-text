SAN FRANCISCO. March 1
(VP). — Huge agricultural de
mand for hydroelectric power in
California's 4(> drought - parched
counties boosted power consump
tion two per cent over normal de
spite a rigid "dimout" of non-es
sential electricity consumption.
PG&E, the state's largest pub
lic utility, said the water and
power curtailment program had
failed to meet its goal of a 10 per
cent reduction in its first week.
"But the program is by no
means a failure." a spokesman
said. "Without the brownout, the
greatly increased agricultural
pumping tor irrigation in the
drought areas would have boosted
the power load immeasurably."
The power company said it was
setting up patrols to report on
violations of water and power
uses.
