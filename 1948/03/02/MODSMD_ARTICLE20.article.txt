### 
WASHINGTON. Mar. 1 (UP)â€”
A House un-American activities sub
committee today accused Dr. E. U.
Condon, prominent atomic scientist
and director of the National Bureau
of Standards, of consorting with al
leged Soviet spies.
But Condon and the Commerce
Department hotly denied the charge.
The three-man Congressional
group said it had "derogatory infor
mation" about Condon. It demanded
that he be removed from the big
federal research agency, that does
top-secret work for the armed forc
es. unless the Commerce Depart
ment could justify keeping him on.
FOSTER ISSUES DENIAL
Acting Secretary of Commerce
William C. Foster promptly issued

a statement revealing that the de
partment's loyalty board had com
pleted a special investigation of Con
don on Feb. 24. He said "its unani
mous opinion was that no reason
able grounds exist for believing that
Dr. Condon is disloyal to the govern
ment of the United States."
Condon, when informed of the
report by the United Press. replied
that "the accusations are so vagut
that it is hard to comment on them."
He added that his "whole career
and life clearly reveals that 1 am
completely reliable, loyal, conscien
tious and devoted to the interest oi
my country." ,
WALLACE APPOINTEE
The subcommittee, headed b\
Chairman J. Parnell Thomas (R..
N.J.), who had previously attacked
Condon in several magazine articles,
noted that the world-famous physi
cist was appointed to the govern
ment by Henry A. Wallace, when
the third-party presidential candi
date was Commerce secretary.
The subcommittee identified Wal
lace as the communists' "candidate
for president." But it said it hat
"no evidence" that Dr. Condon is .
communist party member.
