LONDON. Mar. 1 (UP)â€”Russian
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov told
a London dinner party less than
three months ago that there will be
no new war for at least five years,
a member of the Labor party said
today in the House of Commons.
Capt. Raymond Blackburn said a
friend of his had attended "the last
dinner party given in London" by
Molotov and his deputy Andrei Vi
shinsky, during the last session of
the Council of Foreign Ministers.
Blackburn's report on Molotov
came during the opening day of de
bate on tne government's defense
policy, outlined in a new white pa
per, in which:
1. Defense Minister A. V. Alex
ander charged that the Soviet Union
advocates disarmament for every
one else, but maintains its own huge
army "to work its will throughout
the world."
2. Rebel Laborite Richard H. S.
Crossman said the United States
bore the responsibility for armed
defense against communist aggres
sion. He said America has not ac
cepted the "military responsibility"
of her own foreign policy.
Alexander proposed:
1. Britain's armed forces be re
duced by 224.000 to 716,000 by 1949
around a core of 400,000 trained
regulars.
2. nance of "adequate"
forces in the Middle East.
3. Retention of peacetime con
scription.
