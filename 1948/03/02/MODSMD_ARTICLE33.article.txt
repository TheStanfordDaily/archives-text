# Another Brooklyn Bridge? Village Is ‘Up for Sale’
## 
### 
They used to talk about those New York sharpies who sold the
Brooklyn bridge to visiting rubes.
But the Gotham fleecers had nothing on (ho perpetrators of the
"Village for Sale" hoax which worried Stanford Villagers into a lather
over the weekend.
Many Village denizens, returning from Saturday and Sunday soiries
in a somewhat fatigued condition, were suddenly revived when they
spied the brand new "For Sale" placard posted on the red and while
Stanford Village sign near the Ravenswood gate.
The sign directed any prospective purchasers to call a realtor by
the name of Carrillo in Redwood City for further details.
Until the olTiee of Dwight Adams, director of the Village, opened
yesterday morning, many Villagers had visions of having their happy
homes sold right from under them.
Yesterday, however, Adams insisted that the Village was not for
sale . . . not yet anyway. He advanced the theory that the culprits who
tacked up the sign might be of the same ilk as those who changed
another sign near the same gate to read, "Stanford Village—for poor
veterans."
