entirely legal.
The newly formed action commit

the people," Erban said.
Vaclav Kopecky, Minister of In
formation, said he could not give
totals on the number of persons ar

government business"' had made it
impossible for them to be present.

term, "but in view of the Sokol
(sports society) festival and the fact
that the legislative work of the As

the crisis, it is possible that there
will be a postponement.
