# Self-Service Laundry Cuts Student Living Expenses
## 
### BOB BUTTERWICK 
One of those seemingly insignificant gaps in the high cost
of living that add up to a great deal of money saved for both
married and single students is the 51 Bendix washing machines
at Stanford Village.
Originally set up to aid married couples keep within their

budgets by providing cheap laundry?
service, the Village administration
has since expanded the project to j
single student houses.
At the present time there are 32
machines in Bui .ding 351. the laun
dry building, and one each in the j
other houses, cxcept for the tar- |
paper buildings. Building 123 has
two Bendixes.
FIRST MACHI SfKS
The first machines were installed
in October, 1946. Soon after, the I
single students heard they could get
their laundry done for a dime, and ,
the machines gained popularity !
from inexperienced washers with >
their two weeks' supply of dirty
clothes.
Everything went in those first i
days. Whites and colored materials i
were mixed indiscriminately. Far \
from being dismayed at the out
come. bets were being made as to
what color the whites would be
when they came out.
Conditions have improved since
then. The biggest problem now is
to keep some curious child from
opening the door of a machine in
operation.
The Village has the Bendixes on
lease from the Pacific Telecoin Co.
Enough revenue is retained to pay
tor the cost of utilities, making it a
non-profit business in so far as the '
Village is concerned.
WASHING MOOCHERS
A pressing problem which arose
soon after the laundry building
opened was a sudden influx of
Menlo Park residents doing their
â– washing at cut-rate prices. Il is the
job of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Johnson,
who take care of the laundry build- j
ing in return for their apartment, to
keep as many outsiders away as
possible.
At the present time the machines
are open for use only to Villagers
and residents of other University j
housing projects. With 19 machines
to serve some 1.400 single students
and 32 to take care of the 326 mar
ried couples and their approximate
ly 250 children, there isn't much
room for anyone else.
