# Cook's Flowers Aid in Brightening Lagunita Tables

### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
If the Lagunita dining hall runs
out of snapdragons for table deco
rations, or if the girls want extra
pansies, the man to see is Sam
Kirschenmann.
Sam, a cook's helper, began to
supply extra flowers for the dining
room last summer when he started
his venture in a small plot back of
the dormitory. His is the only gar
den operated by a large campus
dining hall that partially supplies
tables with flowers.
"We have 'marygoldi,' 'enemies,'
'gladius,' and 'narciscus' for spring,"
said Sam, fondly fingering his "chil
dren,'' planted in neat rows. lie
promised that "we even will have
'punkins' for next Halloween, if I
fix them right."
After trying farming in South Da
kota, Sam came to California in 1941
to work in the shipyards for three
years. He became a full-time cook's
helper at Lagunita after the war.
Digging in his garden now fills his
spare afternoon hours.
Frost and gophers were the only
obstacles to Sam's gardening, and he
hopes to overcome both by time and
an industrious cat, if he can find
them.
