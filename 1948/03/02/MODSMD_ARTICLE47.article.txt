# Opera Recital To Be Given
## 
### 
Opera Workshop will present its
first recital since its reorganization,
tomorrow and Thursday nights at
8:15 in the Women's Clubhouse.
Stanford's operatic training pro
gram was reorganized on a profes
sional basis this year.
Instead of regular students, pro
fessional or semi-professional sing
ers were enrolled. All workshop
members expect to make their ca
reers in opera.
"This is opera the way it should
be done," said Dr. Jan Popper, di
rector of the workshop.
He said that opera should be done
with "young and spirited singers.
It can be done without the old vet
erans."
Modern staging will be featured
in this program. Many breaks are
made in tradition. Staging was di
rected by Joel Carter, instructor in
music.
The entire first act of Mozart's
"Marriage of Figaro" will be the
main work presented.
Scenes from Verdi's "Pigoletto"
and Puccini's "La Boheme" and a
scene from Smetana's "The Bar
tered Bride" and Menotti's "The
Old Maid and the Thief" will round
out the program.
