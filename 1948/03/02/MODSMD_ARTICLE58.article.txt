# Indian Cagers Hope To Snap Cal Victory Streak
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity cagers will have to get up off the floor this
Friday night to meet the champ in his own corner—that is, they
v/ill travel to Berkeley to take on the Big Bad Bears. The Cards
will then stage their season's finale against the Bears at home
in the Pavilion 011 Saturday night.
Right now, the Berkeley boys are riding so high it's hard for

them to breathe. They have already
cinched the confernec southern divi
sion crown. Andy Wolfe has been
called the greatest player in Calitoi -
nia basketball history. Chuck Han
ger is the league's leading scorer.
Coach Nibs Price is looking for his
fourteenth and fifteenth straight con
ference victories, as well as a clean
sweep of this year's 12-game sched
ule. And if that isn't enough, Cal
is also out to maintain its 10-game
winning streak over Stanford.
Only one team can stop the Bears
from becoming the first in Southern
Division history to win every con
ference game, and the cellar-dwell
ing Stanfords would like nothing
better than to gain back a little self
respect by dumping the "great"
Golden Bear.
CAL RATES EDGE
In comparing the records of the
two teams, it wouldn't look as if
Stanford had much of a chance. Cal
has won every game, including two
earlier wins over Stanford. The In
dians are associated with the win
column only through their two vic
tories over the UCLA Bruins.
But it would be suicide for Andy
Wolfe and his crew to sell the Cards
short. One of these nights Higgins
and Davidson and Stephenson are
all going to get hot at the same time.
And one of these night Stanford
is going to get some breaks during
the last minute of play. (Five of
Stanford s eight conference losses
have occurred during the last min
ute of the game).
When that happens, and it could
be against Cal, Stanford isn't go
ing to look like a cellar ball club.
Instead, they're going to look much
more like the team that has beaten
such outfits as Oregon State, Ar
kansas, and Oregon.
Man-for-man Stanford has the
ability to give any team in the na
tion a good fight, but in conference
play the Indians have been as un
lucky as any one team could b«
They own a very poor 2 to 8 rec
ord, yet potentially they have what
it takes to beat Cal who is easing
in with a 10 and 0 record.
LAST. GAME FOR "BABE"
In Babe Higgins, the Cards have
an outstanding team general and
sparkplug. From his guard spot,
Captain Higgins will lead Stanford
aaginst California as he winds up his
college basketball career. Higgins
has been great all season, both as
a forward and guard.
Backing up Babe will be the same
regulars who have been starters
most of the season; Bill Rose, Mor
ley Thompson, Bill Stephenson, and
Dave Davidson.
Milt Scjuinty Iverson has im
proved rapidly in the last four con
ference games and might rate a
starting berth against Cal. Iverson
is a last moving forward, being very
effective on the offensive backboard.
He came into his own last weekend
when he led Stan.ord scorers with
17 points in two games.
Bill Stephenson, who was bottled
up well by USC's and UCLA's two
man-to-one defensive tactics, is be
ing counted upon, to get back into
the two figured scoring column
against the Bears. The reason Ste
phenson hasn't been scoring" is that
the Trojans and Bruins put a man
on each side of him, and everywhere
Steve turned a man was in the way.
TEAM RESTS
Yesterday Coach Everett Dean had
his men take a holiday from practice,
and the varsity met last night to
discuss plans for upsetting the Bears.
Every man on the squad is intact,
and ready to go.
Also playing his last game for
Stanford this weekend will be Bob
Lewis, tall tennis-playing guard.
"Whip" Lewis was at his best when
he was assigned to guard Chuck
Hanger in the first Cal series, and
he came through with two fine de
fensive performances.
Practice will be resumed this af
ternoon with additional sessions
scheduled for tomorrow and Thurs
day. Alter that, it'll be the weekend
ball games and that's all for the
season.

has won every game, including two
earlier wins over Stanford. The In
dians are associated with the win
column only through their two vic
tories over the UCLA Bruins.
But it would be suicide for Andy
Wolfe and his crew to sell the Cards
short. One of these nights Higgins
and Davidson and Stephenson are
all going to get hot at the same time.
And one of these night Stanford
is going to get some breaks during
the last minute of play. (Five of
Stanford s eight conference losses
have occurred during the last min
ute of the game).
When that happens, and it could
be against Cal, Stanford isn't go
ing to look like a cellar ball club.
Instead, they're going to look much
more like the team that has beaten
such outfits as Oregon State, Ar
kansas, and Oregon.
Man-for-man Stanford has the
ability to give any team in the na
tion a good fight, but in conference
play the Indians have been as un
lucky as any one team could b«
They own a very poor 2 to 8 rec
ord, yet potentially they have what
it takes to beat Cal who is easing
in with a 10 and 0 record.
LAST. GAME FOR "BABE"
In Babe Higgins, the Cards have
an outstanding team general and
sparkplug. From his guard spot,
Captain Higgins will lead Stanford
aaginst California as he winds up his
college basketball career. Higgins
has been great all season, both as
a forward and guard.
Backing up Babe will be the same
regulars who have been starters
most of the season; Bill Rose, Mor
ley Thompson, Bill Stephenson, and
Dave Davidson.
Milt Scjuinty Iverson has im
proved rapidly in the last four con
ference games and might rate a
starting berth against Cal. Iverson
is a last moving forward, being very
effective on the offensive backboard.
He came into his own last weekend
when he led Stan.ord scorers with
17 points in two games.
Bill Stephenson, who was bottled
up well by USC's and UCLA's two
man-to-one defensive tactics, is be
ing counted upon, to get back into
the two figured scoring column
against the Bears. The reason Ste
phenson hasn't been scoring" is that
the Trojans and Bruins put a man
on each side of him, and everywhere
Steve turned a man was in the way.
TEAM RESTS
Yesterday Coach Everett Dean had
his men take a holiday from practice,
and the varsity met last night to
discuss plans for upsetting the Bears.
Every man on the squad is intact,
and ready to go.
Also playing his last game for
Stanford this weekend will be Bob
Lewis, tall tennis-playing guard.
"Whip" Lewis was at his best when
he was assigned to guard Chuck
Hanger in the first Cal series, and
he came through with two fine de
fensive performances.
Practice will be resumed this af
ternoon with additional sessions
scheduled for tomorrow and Thurs
day. Alter that, it'll be the weekend
ball games and that's all for the
season.
Stanford's varsity cagers will have to get up off the floor this
Friday night to meet the champ in his own corner—that is, they
v/ill travel to Berkeley to take on the Big Bad Bears. The Cards
will then stage their season's finale against the Bears at home
in the Pavilion 011 Saturday night.
Right now, the Berkeley boys are riding so high it's hard for

them to breathe. They have already
cinched the confernec southern divi
sion crown. Andy Wolfe has been
called the greatest player in Calitoi -
nia basketball history. Chuck Han
ger is the league's leading scorer.
Coach Nibs Price is looking for his
fourteenth and fifteenth straight con
ference victories, as well as a clean
sweep of this year's 12-game sched
ule. And if that isn't enough, Cal
is also out to maintain its 10-game
winning streak over Stanford.
Only one team can stop the Bears
from becoming the first in Southern
Division history to win every con
ference game, and the cellar-dwell
ing Stanfords would like nothing
better than to gain back a little self
respect by dumping the "great"
Golden Bear.

sparkplug. From his guard spot,
Captain Higgins will lead Stanford
aaginst California as he winds up his
college basketball career. Higgins
has been great all season, both as
a forward and guard.
Backing up Babe will be the same
regulars who have been starters
most of the season; Bill Rose, Mor
ley Thompson, Bill Stephenson, and
Dave Davidson.
Milt Scjuinty Iverson has im
proved rapidly in the last four con
ference games and might rate a
starting berth against Cal. Iverson
is a last moving forward, being very
effective on the offensive backboard.
He came into his own last weekend
when he led Stan.ord scorers with
17 points in two games.
Bill Stephenson, who was bottled
up well by USC's and UCLA's two
man-to-one defensive tactics, is be
ing counted upon, to get back into
the two figured scoring column
against the Bears. The reason Ste
phenson hasn't been scoring" is that
the Trojans and Bruins put a man
on each side of him, and everywhere
Steve turned a man was in the way.
TEAM RESTS
Yesterday Coach Everett Dean had
his men take a holiday from practice,
and the varsity met last night to
discuss plans for upsetting the Bears.
Every man on the squad is intact,
and ready to go.
Also playing his last game for
Stanford this weekend will be Bob
Lewis, tall tennis-playing guard.
"Whip" Lewis was at his best when
he was assigned to guard Chuck
Hanger in the first Cal series, and
he came through with two fine de
fensive performances.
Practice will be resumed this af
ternoon with additional sessions
scheduled for tomorrow and Thurs
day. Alter that, it'll be the weekend
ball games and that's all for the
season.
