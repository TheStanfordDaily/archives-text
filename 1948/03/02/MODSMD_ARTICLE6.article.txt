## 
### 
Six students, arrested Sunday
night at Rossotti's, were released
yesterday morning from the Red
wood City jail on $50 bail. They
were charged with disturbing the
peace and malicious mischief.
The students gave thier names as
Paul W. Stremic, 27; John Levy, 26;
Allen Brooks, 24; Ronald Bishop,
26; John J. Thompson, 24; and Vic
tor Caglieri, 25.
The men were released and their
hearing postponed until 10 a.m. Fri
day when the judge recognized their
plea to engage a lawyer before trial.
Officers said that the students,
who had taken three cases of beer
to Rossotti's and had already fin
ished one at the time of arrest, had
ripped up four picnic tables for a
bonfire.
"Pop" Rossotti, proprietor of the
Portola Road picnic grounds, said
he couldn't believe Stanford stu
dents would burn his tables.
"I'm sure they were UC students,"
he declared; "I'm sure they weren't
from Stanford."
Bishop, one of those apprehended,
is not registered at Stanford, but
gave his address as 566 Lasuen.
