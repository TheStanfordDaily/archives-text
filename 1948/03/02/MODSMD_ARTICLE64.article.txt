# Tennis Squad Opens Season
## 
### 
Elwvn Bugge's varsity tennis
squad will inaugurate its 1948 sea
son with a practice match with the
Santa Clara Broncos Wednesday at
2 p.m.
Having lost four of the six top
men of last year's team. Coach
Bugge must rely on Fred and Bob
Lewis, Kirke Mechem, Bob Forbes,
and improved members of the '47
jayvee team for a successful season.
Bob Lewis, who last year occupied
the number one spot temporarily,
should be top man again when he
shifts his .sights from the basketball
floor to the tennis court.
He will have to ward off Mechem
and Forbes, however. Kirke has
developed a slashing net game
which is difficult to break through,
and Forbes is a powerful backcourt
! driver.
Filling out the rest of the team are
Errol Lycette, Lucien a√ürbour. and
Don iHnes. Dave Basham, a veteran
of the '47 team, will give the Farm
j netters strength in the doubles de
-1 partment.


FRED LEWIS is one of the few
returning lettermen on Coach El
wyn Bugge's '48 tennis squad.
