# Bums, Braves, Cards to Lead Race for National League Flag
## 
### JACK BLOOD 
The 16 major league baseball
teams opened spring training yes
terday two weeks later than usual.
The reason for the delay is due to
the players' grievance committee
which last year forced the owners
to shorten the training season dur
ing which the players do not draw
a salary.
The Dodgers, with Lippy Duro
cher back as manager, are the team
to beat. With Eddie Stanky and
Powec Reese forming the best key
stone combination in the league and
scrappy Pistol Pete Reiser in one
piece again, the Dodgers will be
tough to dislodge as National
League champs.
BRAVES ARE DEFINITE THREAT
Billy Southworth's Boston Braves
are ready and able to take over the
top spot if the Dodgers slip. Twin
20 - game winners — Warren Spahn
and Johnny Sain -head the Boston
staff. Slugger Earl Torgeson. John
ny Hopp, and Tommy Holmes will
supply the attack which all adds up
to make the Braves a definite threat.
The slipping Cardinals will prob
ably field the same lineup that was
edged out by the Bums in last Sep
tember's pennant race. Eddie Dyer
still has Harry "The Cat" Breechen,
Howie Pollet, and George Monger
as dependable starters as well as
"Spider" Marion to cover the in
field and Stan Musial on first. Don't
count out the Redbirds; they'll be
up close at the finish.
A good bet for fourth place are
the powerful New York Giants.
Willard Marshall, Walker Cooper,
Johnny Mize, and Tommy Thomp
son, who led the Giants to their

many offensive records last year,
will give Mel Ott all the runs he
! needs if only lVIel can find a few
[ pitchers to go with Larry Jansen,
their ace.
Billy Meyers, veteran minor
I league manager, takes over the helm
jat Pittsburgh. Big Ralph Kiner is
the only one sure of a regular berth
I on the '48 Pirates. Like the Giants,
the Bucs need pitching.
MKRRIIMAN VP WITH REDS
The Cincinnati Reds with fx*esh
man pilot Johnny Neun in the driv
er's seat have Ewell B'.aekwell, the
man with the buggy-whip arm, but
he's not enough. Up for a trial wit!.
j the Reds will be Stanford's Lloyd'
i Merriman. While Lloyd may not
reach the big tent this year, the
Reds need plenty of help.
Jolly Cholly Grimm's Cubs, who
I along with Pittsburgh will train in
California, must replace holes left
by the departure of popular Stan
Hack at third and workhorse Claude
j Passeau on the mound. There's a
i hole at short too.

man with the buggy-whip arm, but
he's not enough. Up for a trial wit!.
j the Reds will be Stanford's Lloyd'
i Merriman. While Lloyd may not
reach the big tent this year, the
Reds need plenty of help.
Jolly Cholly Grimm's Cubs, who
I along with Pittsburgh will train in
California, must replace holes left
by the departure of popular Stan
Hack at third and workhorse Claude
j Passeau on the mound. There's a
i hole at short too.
The 16 major league baseball
teams opened spring training yes
terday two weeks later than usual.
The reason for the delay is due to
the players' grievance committee
which last year forced the owners
to shorten the training season dur
ing which the players do not draw
a salary.
The Dodgers, with Lippy Duro
cher back as manager, are the team
to beat. With Eddie Stanky and
Powec Reese forming the best key
stone combination in the league and
scrappy Pistol Pete Reiser in one
piece again, the Dodgers will be
tough to dislodge as National
League champs.
BRAVES ARE DEFINITE THREAT
Billy Southworth's Boston Braves
are ready and able to take over the
top spot if the Dodgers slip. Twin
20 - game winners — Warren Spahn
and Johnny Sain -head the Boston
staff. Slugger Earl Torgeson. John
ny Hopp, and Tommy Holmes will
supply the attack which all adds up
to make the Braves a definite threat.
The slipping Cardinals will prob
ably field the same lineup that was
edged out by the Bums in last Sep
tember's pennant race. Eddie Dyer
still has Harry "The Cat" Breechen,
Howie Pollet, and George Monger
as dependable starters as well as
"Spider" Marion to cover the in
field and Stan Musial on first. Don't
count out the Redbirds; they'll be
up close at the finish.
A good bet for fourth place are
the powerful New York Giants.
Willard Marshall, Walker Cooper,
Johnny Mize, and Tommy Thomp
son, who led the Giants to their

many offensive records last year,
will give Mel Ott all the runs he
! needs if only lVIel can find a few
[ pitchers to go with Larry Jansen,
their ace.
Billy Meyers, veteran minor
I league manager, takes over the helm
jat Pittsburgh. Big Ralph Kiner is
the only one sure of a regular berth
I on the '48 Pirates. Like the Giants,
the Bucs need pitching.
MKRRIIMAN VP WITH REDS
The Cincinnati Reds with fx*esh
man pilot Johnny Neun in the driv
er's seat have Ewell B'.aekwell, the
man with the buggy-whip arm, but
he's not enough. Up for a trial wit!.
