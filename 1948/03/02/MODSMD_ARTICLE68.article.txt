## A 						Target for Cal 
### 
About a month before the last Big Game, Cal's student body
president, Don Lang, tossed us a suggestion which could well
bear some serious consideration. Though Lang's scheme con
cerns mostly pre-Big Game activities, the present is by no means
a poor time to ponder the issue. ,
Lang proposed that we erect some type of structure similar
to Cal's gold on blue "C" on which paint-and-brush intent Cal
students could spend their energy, thus sparing disfiguring blobs
on Hoover libe, Palm drive, and the facade of the Ad building.
Where to build proposed target is another question. One wit
has suggested we pile up 400 feet of dirt on which could be
stuck a huge neon "SI"
Possibly a more feasible site would be one of the small hills
just off Foot Hill Road and adjoining the golf course.
Site speculation, however, can wait for the moment while we
ponder the more important consideration, to wit: is there any
merit in the Associated Students constructing some type of
appropriate device to serve, mainly—as a target for swabs of
blue and gold paint, and secondarily—to "stand as a monu
ment or symbol of Stanford?
In answer to the very apparent question as to why such a
proposal is offered at this date when the next Big Game is only a
remote thought, we say that the proposal —if found to posses
merit —could very possibly become a project of an interested
group for next quarter, thus making the suggestion a reality by
next November.
To whom the responsibility will fall for discussing the plan
end reporting its feasibility to Excom, is the first step. From here
it looks like a ball for Cardinals or Block "S."—}. A.
