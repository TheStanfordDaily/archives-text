## Students Concerned 
### 
To the Editor:
Students Concerned now consists of 12 young people, in college and
out, who realize that what must undergird any constructive changes in
the world situation is a profound psychological change of attitude in
the individual. In order to present this possibility of change to numerous
people, the group developed a plan of helping an initial group of oO
students to discover what basic attitude is required for the survival of
man, of sending them to Europe for a three months period of service,
and of returning them to this country to share their convictions with
other students.
The fundamental thesis of Students Concerned is that there are only
two alternatives open to man: he can contribute to destruction: or he
can contribute to survival. If he chooses the latter, then his only func
tion is to discover what actions and attitudes lead to life, and to act in
accord with these. Man must not allow his preconceptions, personal de
sires, and prejudices to govern his decisions. He should rather approach
all situations with an open mind and a willingness to consider all relevant
facts. In accord with this principle, Students Concerned welcomes sugges
tions and criticisms as an opportunity for re-evaluating the validity oj:
their methods and convictions.
