# Thanks from the Red Cross
## 
### 
To the Editor:
This is to thank all the students and faculty who helped with the
1948 Red Cross Drive. Without such cooperation our success would have
been severely impaired.
Although we did not make our proposed $5,000 quota, Stanford con
tributed $3,600.99, which surpassed last year's amount by some $200.
For this the participants are to be congratu ted.
I especially want to thank all the collectors who devoted their time
to the drive. Without them nothing could have been done.
DIANA POWERS.
