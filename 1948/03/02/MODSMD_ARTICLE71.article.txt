## Comics and Personality 
### SAM SOUKI 
PITTSBURGH (UP)—Modern comic strips, many
of which long ago forsook comedy for adventure,
love, and satire, now give psychoanalysts a new
means of testing personality.
Dr. Warren W. Sones, professor of education at
the University of Pittsburgh, believes comic strip
preference offers more reliable study material than
the best of tea leaves or the trustiest of palms.
For instance, the reader who fights for each
installment of high adventure, mass homicide, glamor,
and love comics is an "ego enhancement" type—a
person who nurses ambitions for heroism, swash
buckling adventure and glamor.
Readers who follow the "domestic" comic strips
usually ai*e members of happy families.
The strips Dr. Sones refers to as "hate art" in
clude those in which the unscrupulous villain is
foiled. Often the villain is a commonly respected
type of citizen for whom a particular class or type
of individual reserves a special dislike.
Dr. Sones says the frustration of the villains
serves to give the "hate-art" readers vicarious pleas
ure.
In the "strictly for adults" classification, Dr.
Sones lists a limited number of comics which appeal
either directly to adult minds, or use a broad brush
in daubing the strip's continuity with social satire.
The final listing Dr. Sones gives is the purely
educationl, or religious comic strip.
Dr. Sones believes comics have only begun to
progress. He predicts more adequate use of comic
strips in education.
For example, he believes that a text book story
duplicating one four-block sequence of "Prince
Valiant" would run at least 2,500 words long and
have less effect on the memory than the pictures
which can be read in a minute's time.

BOSTON (UP)—Fish swimming in North Atlantic
waters are about to be tabbed by Uncle Sam. The
government is going to take a census of them for
the first time.
There will be no fibbing about ages or other mat
ters when the U. S. Fish and Wild Lite Service
starts its census about April 1.
"We'll count the fish by age groups," said Capt.
Marvin G. Rice of Gloucester, skipper of the census
taking ship Albatross. "We have a positive means
of ascertaining the age by microscopic projection of
fish scales. This will tell us the age of the fish in
much the same way as ridges determine the age
of a tree."
The Albatross, .with Rice and a 22-man crew,
will take sevei'al years to complete a "fairly accurate
census" of haddock, cod. flounder, halibut and other
food fish on Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and
off Nova Scotia.
Federal authorities, faced with the loss of had
dock and other fish from the great feeding grounds
of the North Atlantic, hope to obtain statistics that
will aid in solving the mystery of disappearing fish.
A large otter type trawl will accompany the Alba
tross and will be used to catch the fish.
Skipper Rice hopes to obtain the secretary of inter
ior's permission "to sell the fish we catch in Boston
and other food markets at prevailing prices."
"That," he said, "will place sorely needed food
on the market and will help to defray expenses.

WITH THE ARAB ARMY INSIDE PALESTINE
(UP) —Crossing the frontier from Syria and Lebanon
into Palestine is as easy as going from New York
to New Jersey.
The bearded soldiers of Fawzi El-Kawukji's vol
unteer-Arab-people's army control big chunks of
Northern Palestine and the rifle is their only law.
I crossed the Syro-Lebanese frontier into the
Holy Land by car and drove about 30 miles into the
contested territory, an area administered by soldiers
of the Arab Army of Liberation. Ihey are itching
for action.
As a 19-year-old Seoud Tribesman who guided
me part of the way said, "So far it has been child s
play."
"There have been no attacks worthy of real
men," he said. "We have been shooting off guns,
sniping and ambushing convoys. But wars differ

today from those our fathers fought. There is much
politics mixed in with fighting now."
They spend their time cutting communications
between the Jewish settlements in Northern Pales
tine. They cut roads between supply centers. And
they test Zionist defenses with small forays while
they train Palestine Arab villagers and wait for the
"general offensive."
The offensive is being delayed pending the out
come of UN Security Council debates.
Despite the warlike tension in Palestine, there are
no difficulties about crossing the frontier. At ar.
outpost a villager asked for my identity cards, read
them, and let me proceed.
One of the soldiers under El-Kawukji, who was
a field commander during the last Arab uprisings,
offered to guide me to the area of the commander.
My guide regaled me with tales of skirmishes.
He said, for instance, he regarded Jewesses braver
than Palestine Jews.
"A few days ago. the Jews attacked an Arab
bus in this area," he said. "It was one of the rare
Zionist sorties for these days. A Jewess tossed an
incendiary bomb. set. the bus afire and four Arab>
burned. Three other occupants dived into a ditch.
"Only the driver was armed. He had a pistol. He
peered over the edge of the ditch and saw the
Jewess was armed with a Sten gun and was firing.
Behind her were two Jews carrying Tommy guns.
''Luck was with the Arab. A gust of wind blew
the girl's long hair over her eyes. She raised her
hand to brush the hair back. The Arab raised his
head and pulled the trigger of his pistol. The girl
dropped dea.
"The two men behind her turned and ran.
"They're she devils, these Jewish women."

WITH THE ARAB ARMY INSIDE PALESTINE

into Palestine is as easy as going from New York

The bearded soldiers of Fawzi El-Kawukji's vol
unteer-Arab-people's army control big chunks of
Northern Palestine and the rifle is their only law.
I crossed the Syro-Lebanese frontier into the

today from those our fathers fought. There is much

PITTSBURGH (UP)—Modern comic strips, many
of which long ago forsook comedy for adventure,
love, and satire, now give psychoanalysts a new
means of testing personality.
Dr. Warren W. Sones, professor of education at
the University of Pittsburgh, believes comic strip
preference offers more reliable study material than
the best of tea leaves or the trustiest of palms.
For instance, the reader who fights for each
installment of high adventure, mass homicide, glamor,
and love comics is an "ego enhancement" type—a
person who nurses ambitions for heroism, swash
buckling adventure and glamor.
Readers who follow the "domestic" comic strips
usually ai*e members of happy families.
The strips Dr. Sones refers to as "hate art" in
clude those in which the unscrupulous villain is
foiled. Often the villain is a commonly respected
type of citizen for whom a particular class or type
of individual reserves a special dislike.
Dr. Sones says the frustration of the villains
serves to give the "hate-art" readers vicarious pleas
ure.
In the "strictly for adults" classification, Dr.
Sones lists a limited number of comics which appeal
either directly to adult minds, or use a broad brush
in daubing the strip's continuity with social satire.
The final listing Dr. Sones gives is the purely
educationl, or religious comic strip.
Dr. Sones believes comics have only begun to
progress. He predicts more adequate use of comic
strips in education.
For example, he believes that a text book story
duplicating one four-block sequence of "Prince
Valiant" would run at least 2,500 words long and
have less effect on the memory than the pictures
which can be read in a minute's time.

BOSTON (UP)—Fish swimming in North Atlantic
waters are about to be tabbed by Uncle Sam. The
government is going to take a census of them for
the first time.
There will be no fibbing about ages or other mat
ters when the U. S. Fish and Wild Lite Service
starts its census about April 1.
"We'll count the fish by age groups," said Capt.
Marvin G. Rice of Gloucester, skipper of the census
taking ship Albatross. "We have a positive means
of ascertaining the age by microscopic projection of
fish scales. This will tell us the age of the fish in
much the same way as ridges determine the age
of a tree."
The Albatross, .with Rice and a 22-man crew,
will take sevei'al years to complete a "fairly accurate
census" of haddock, cod. flounder, halibut and other
food fish on Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and
off Nova Scotia.

PITTSBURGH (UP)—Modern comic strips, many
of which long ago forsook comedy for adventure,
love, and satire, now give psychoanalysts a new
means of testing personality.
Dr. Warren W. Sones, professor of education at
the University of Pittsburgh, believes comic strip
preference offers more reliable study material than
the best of tea leaves or the trustiest of palms.
For instance, the reader who fights for each
installment of high adventure, mass homicide, glamor,
and love comics is an "ego enhancement" type—a
person who nurses ambitions for heroism, swash
buckling adventure and glamor.
Readers who follow the "domestic" comic strips
usually ai*e members of happy families.
The strips Dr. Sones refers to as "hate art" in
clude those in which the unscrupulous villain is
foiled. Often the villain is a commonly respected
type of citizen for whom a particular class or type
of individual reserves a special dislike.
Dr. Sones says the frustration of the villains
serves to give the "hate-art" readers vicarious pleas
ure.
In the "strictly for adults" classification, Dr.
Sones lists a limited number of comics which appeal
either directly to adult minds, or use a broad brush
in daubing the strip's continuity with social satire.
The final listing Dr. Sones gives is the purely
educationl, or religious comic strip.
Dr. Sones believes comics have only begun to
progress. He predicts more adequate use of comic
strips in education.
For example, he believes that a text book story
duplicating one four-block sequence of "Prince
Valiant" would run at least 2,500 words long and
have less effect on the memory than the pictures
which can be read in a minute's time.

BOSTON (UP)—Fish swimming in North Atlantic
waters are about to be tabbed by Uncle Sam. The
government is going to take a census of them for
the first time.
There will be no fibbing about ages or other mat
ters when the U. S. Fish and Wild Lite Service
starts its census about April 1.
"We'll count the fish by age groups," said Capt.
Marvin G. Rice of Gloucester, skipper of the census
taking ship Albatross. "We have a positive means
of ascertaining the age by microscopic projection of
fish scales. This will tell us the age of the fish in
much the same way as ridges determine the age
of a tree."
The Albatross, .with Rice and a 22-man crew,
will take sevei'al years to complete a "fairly accurate
census" of haddock, cod. flounder, halibut and other
food fish on Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and
off Nova Scotia.
Federal authorities, faced with the loss of had
dock and other fish from the great feeding grounds
of the North Atlantic, hope to obtain statistics that
will aid in solving the mystery of disappearing fish.
A large otter type trawl will accompany the Alba
tross and will be used to catch the fish.
Skipper Rice hopes to obtain the secretary of inter
ior's permission "to sell the fish we catch in Boston
and other food markets at prevailing prices."
"That," he said, "will place sorely needed food
on the market and will help to defray expenses.

WITH THE ARAB ARMY INSIDE PALESTINE
(UP) —Crossing the frontier from Syria and Lebanon
into Palestine is as easy as going from New York
to New Jersey.
The bearded soldiers of Fawzi El-Kawukji's vol
unteer-Arab-people's army control big chunks of
Northern Palestine and the rifle is their only law.
I crossed the Syro-Lebanese frontier into the
Holy Land by car and drove about 30 miles into the
contested territory, an area administered by soldiers
of the Arab Army of Liberation. Ihey are itching
for action.
As a 19-year-old Seoud Tribesman who guided
me part of the way said, "So far it has been child s

"There have been no attacks worthy of real
men," he said. "We have been shooting off guns,
sniping and ambushing convoys. But wars differ

today from those our fathers fought. There is much
politics mixed in with fighting now."
They spend their time cutting communications
between the Jewish settlements in Northern Pales

they test Zionist defenses with small forays while
they train Palestine Arab villagers and wait for the
"general offensive."

come of UN Security Council debates.
Despite the warlike tension in Palestine, there are
no difficulties about crossing the frontier. At ar.
outpost a villager asked for my identity cards, read
them, and let me proceed.
One of the soldiers under El-Kawukji, who was
a field commander during the last Arab uprisings,
offered to guide me to the area of the commander.
My guide regaled me with tales of skirmishes.
He said, for instance, he regarded Jewesses braver
than Palestine Jews.

bus in this area," he said. "It was one of the rare
Zionist sorties for these days. A Jewess tossed an
