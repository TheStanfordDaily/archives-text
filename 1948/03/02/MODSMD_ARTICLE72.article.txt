## History 1948 
### 
Canada has practiced the kind of planned decon
trol of prices which the United States would have
followed if some people in and out of the govern
ment had not been over-eager, over-greedy, or
ove. -foolish.
Just now, Canada has removed ceilings from many
things, but she retains them on rent, sugar, meat,
wheat, fats, dried fruits, iron, steel, and tin. This
comes just about 15 months later than the wave

of precipitate decontrol in the
United States.
It is very easy to get the whole
story by looking at the compara
tive indexes of the two countries
In Canada, the cost of living rose
only 3G.1 percent from the 1935-3^ l
base period to August 1, 1947
From the same pre-war base, liv
ing cost on this side of the border
rose 57.1 percent up to June 15—
and was very obviously some

notches higher by August 4.
Do you remember how it was argued in the
United States that if we were to continue price con
trols it would seriously hurt business, destroy incen
tives to produce, and completely wreck our whole
economic system? Shall we then say that Canada's
slower pace has wrecked Canadian business?
With a competitive price advantage, Canadian
business has gone ahead fast. The Canadians have
industrial development ambitions and are advanc
ing them very rapidly. Their reasonably priced
exports are in heavy demand.
As sensible people and as our friendly close
neighbors, we should be glad to see them prosper.
The only recourse I and many Americans have is
a feeling of amazement and bewilderment, and we
wonder how our too-eager Americans i'eel about
throwing our good neighbors the finest advantage
an industrial stripling could dream of from a mature
and powerful industrial neighbor.
It is interesting now to note how all of these
men who so bitterly fought price controls are react
ing to the present situation which now faces Ameri
ca and Americans. The excuses that are flowing
from the lips of these "leaders" is just a waste of
breath.
Not to mention any names, but it would be very
interesting to see how Mr. Taft could explain
himself when he vigorously fought for the remova'.
of all price controls. If he ever does, and before the
Republican nominations this year, Taft might as
well wave farewell to any presidential aspirations
he may have. I firmly believe that the American
people now know what we should have done with
price controls a year and a half ago, and what we
should have done with the men who favored abol
ishing them!

ca and Americans. The excuses that are flowing
from the lips of these "leaders" is just a waste of
breath.
Not to mention any names, but it would be very
interesting to see how Mr. Taft could explain
himself when he vigorously fought for the remova'.
of all price controls. If he ever does, and before the
Republican nominations this year, Taft might as
well wave farewell to any presidential aspirations
he may have. I firmly believe that the American
people now know what we should have done with
price controls a year and a half ago, and what we
should have done with the men who favored abol
ishing them!

Canada has practiced the kind of planned decon
trol of prices which the United States would have
followed if some people in and out of the govern
ment had not been over-eager, over-greedy, or
ove. -foolish.
Just now, Canada has removed ceilings from many
things, but she retains them on rent, sugar, meat,
wheat, fats, dried fruits, iron, steel, and tin. This
comes just about 15 months later than the wave

of precipitate decontrol in the
United States.
It is very easy to get the whole
story by looking at the compara
tive indexes of the two countries
In Canada, the cost of living rose
only 3G.1 percent from the 1935-3^ l
base period to August 1, 1947
From the same pre-war base, liv
ing cost on this side of the border
rose 57.1 percent up to June 15—
and was very obviously some

notches higher by August 4.
Do you remember how it was argued in the
United States that if we were to continue price con
trols it would seriously hurt business, destroy incen
tives to produce, and completely wreck our whole
economic system? Shall we then say that Canada's
slower pace has wrecked Canadian business?
With a competitive price advantage, Canadian
business has gone ahead fast. The Canadians have
industrial development ambitions and are advanc
ing them very rapidly. Their reasonably priced
exports are in heavy demand.
As sensible people and as our friendly close
neighbors, we should be glad to see them prosper.
The only recourse I and many Americans have is
a feeling of amazement and bewilderment, and we
wonder how our too-eager Americans i'eel about
throwing our good neighbors the finest advantage
an industrial stripling could dream of from a mature
and powerful industrial neighbor.
It is interesting now to note how all of these
men who so bitterly fought price controls are react
ing to the present situation which now faces Ameri
ca and Americans. The excuses that are flowing
from the lips of these "leaders" is just a waste of
breath.
