The excavation across Escondito, near the Crothers
Hall construction, and the subsequent blocking of
traffic was only a phase of the modernization of the
University's electrical distribution system. The Farm's
electrical system is going underground.
The $150,000 program includes a new power sub
station and an underground distribution circuit. The
circuit will service all the present University plant,
relieve the currently overloaded system, and provide
facilities to take care of the University's needs for
the next 25 years.
Plans call for installation of three extra circuits
—in case of any breakdown —and facilities for street
arc light and tire alarm systems.
Initial steps in the project are the installation

of manholes, the building of distribution ducte, and
the construction of a sub-station.
The sub-station will be located on an island on
Panama St., between the Union and the Journalism
Building. The station will house nine switch gear
units to step down to 4,000 volts the 10,000 volt powei
to be fed into it by the Pacific Gas & Electiic Co.
Theoretically, these initial construction steps will
te fully completed by September 1949. According
to Carrol T. Blacker, superintendent of buildings
and grounds, this work being done by the Univers
ity Corporation Yard is following the schedule.
The sub-station was designed by J. W. Mc-
Donnell, technical advisor to the University's plan
ning department. He shared the planning of the
new underground distribution system with G. M.
Simonson, consulting engineer.
