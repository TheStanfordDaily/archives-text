# Russ Expansion Meets Opposition
## Finnish Leaders May Veto Soviet Friendship Proposal 
### 
HELSINKI, Mar. 2 (UP) —Tension mounted in Finland tonight as
President Juho K. Paasikivi met increased opposition to Josei:
Stalin's request for a treaty of friendship and mutual military as
sistance with Russia.
Indications were that the leftist Social Democrat party, which

holds the balance of power in the
Finnish Diet, might vote against the
proposal.
Stalin asked the ailing 78-year
old President in a personal letter,
dated Feb. 22, to enter negotiations
at Moscow or Helsinki for a treaty
of friendship and mutual military as
sistance in case of possible future
aggression by Germany.
Spurred toward a decision, part;
leaders went from one conferencr
to another and scheduled additions'
meetings tomorrow. Only the popi;-
lar Democratic Union, which ir. -
eludes the communists and controls
50 of the 200 seats in Parliament, ha_:
definitely made up its mind. It fav
ored negotiations as outlined by
Stalin.
The four opposing parties hold 101
of the 200 seats—a very bare major
ity. With Social Democratic support,
however, they could beat the leftist
demand for military negotiations and
possibly work out a counter-pro
posal to the Stalin request.
