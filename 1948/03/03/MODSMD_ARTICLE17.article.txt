WASHINGTON. Mar. 2 (UP)— At
rney General Tom C. Clark said
day that the federal government
>w has "perfect and complete"
.vnership of the oil-rich tidelands
■neath coastal waters.
Opening the government's battle
■r the submerged lands, he told a
Senate-House judiciary subcom
littee that California is actually
espassing on federal property by
mtinuing to lease its tidelands.
"California has been taking prop
•ty that does not belong to it,"he
lid. "That amounts to a trespass —
confiscation by the state."
He did not say what the govern
lent proposes to do about it. But he
ted the 1947 Supreme Court ruling
hich he said had wiped out any
>ssibility that California had rights
> her tidelands.

The court held that the federal
i government has paramount rights to
j its coastal lands and that California
; does not own them. Clark insisted
this decision gave the federal gov-
I ernment the "highest possible rights"
j to the underwater areas, "including
| perfect and complete property own
j ership."
He said the Justice Department is
i now preparing suits against Texas,
J Louisiana and "possibly several other
I Gulf States" to confirm federal own
' ership. He said he knew Texas had
t a special defense —it claims its own
| ership to tidelands was one from
! Spain and not surrendered when
Texas became a state —but indicated
j that issue could be settled by the
| Supreme Court.
