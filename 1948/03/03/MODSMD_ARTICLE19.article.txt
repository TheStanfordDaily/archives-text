# Taft Questions Steel Leaders; Vandenberg Can Be Drafted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Mar. 2 (UP)
—Senate Presdient Arthur H.
Vanderberg left the door open
today for the Republican party
to draft him as its 1948 presi
dential nominee.
The Michigan Republican, a
strongly potential draft candidate,
refused a yes-or-no answer to the
question whether he would accept
the nomination. He said it was im
possible to give a flat answer with
out knowing what the future may
bring. He declined to speculate on
"utterly improbable contingencies."
But he repeated that he is not a
candidate.
Vandenberg's position—and re
newed request that his name be kept
out of Nebraska's April 13 prefer
ential primary—were set forth in
an exchange of telegrams with Ray
mond A. McConnell, Jr.. editor of
the Nebraska State Journal.
"Since he has not ruled himself
out, the committee will carry out its
original intention of filing his name
in the 'all-star' primary," McCon
nell said. "This is so that Nebraska
voters may have a chance to show
their preference among all possible
contenders."
In addition to Vandenberg, the
Nebraska primary will offer the
names of President Truman, Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey of New York. Sen.
Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Gen. Doug
las Mac Arthur, House Speaker Jo
seph W. Martin. Jr., of Massachus
ettes, former Gov. Harold E. Stas
sen of Minnesota, and Gov. Earl
Warren of California.

WASHINGTON, Mar. 2 (UP
—Sen. Robert A. Taft R., O.)

told three of the top steel exec
utives today that their recent
increase in steel prices stiffened
labor's demand for third-round wage
hikes and heightened appeals for
price control.
The industrialists, who appeared
before Taft's joint congressional eco
nomic committee, were Presidents
Benjamin F. Fairless of U. S. Steel
Corp., A. B. Homer of Bethlehem
Steel, and H. G. Batchellor of Alleg
heny Ludlum Steel Corp.
They told their reasons for the re
cent $5-a-ton increase in the price
of semi-finished steel products and
defending them on grounds that the
increase was justified by higher costs
which do not permit further wage
boosts. They denied that there had
been any collusion in the increases.
The committee will decide later
whether to make an investigation.
Three government agencies already
are conducting inquiries on orders
from President Truman.
Taft did most of the questioning
throughout the day-long session,
concentrating primarily on Fairless.
But he asked both Homer and Bat
chellor how it happened that thv
same price rise was made by the
companies at the same time.


SENATOR ROBERT A. TAFT,
who yesterday told steel execu
tives that their price increases had
caused a demand for higher wages.
