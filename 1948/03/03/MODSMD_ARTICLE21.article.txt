# Southern Revolt Big Demo Worry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 2 (UP).â€”
The rebellious Southern chant that
"Truman can't win" was giving the
President's friends more worries
today than the third-party move
ment.
Both the Southern revolt on the
racial rights issue and Henry A.
Wallace's third - party Presidential
bid have given administration Dem
ocrats plenty of reason for alarm
over Mr. Truman's chances to win
the November election.
The Southern revolt is most wor
risome at the moment because it is
getting louder instead of diminish
ing. The third-party menace looks
remote by comparison.
The rebellion involves an attempt
to deny Mr. Truman the party
nomination unless he recants his
racial rights program, as well as
withholding the Southern electoral
votes if he is nominated. It is more
imminent than the third party's
possible effect on the November
election.
The Republican-controlled House
Judiciary Committee added fuel to
the party split today when it ap
proved an anti-lynching bill. Anti
lynching legislation was on Mr.
Truman's civil rights program
which set off the rebellion.
