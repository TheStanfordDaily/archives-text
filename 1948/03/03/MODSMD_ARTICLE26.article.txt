TOKYO. Wednesday, Mar. 3 (UP)
â€”The United States today accused
Russia of attempting to interfere
with the formation of a new Japan
ese government.
The accusation was made at a
meeting of the Allied Council for
Japan after Russia charged that the
occupation refused to permit the

tive" government in the past.

Premier-Designate Hitoshi Ashida
be purged for political activity.
