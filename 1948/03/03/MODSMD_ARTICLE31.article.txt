LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.. Mar. 2
(UP) —Russia today proposed "di
rect Big Five talks on (lie Palestine
situation and backed the United
States in urging the United Nations
Security Council lo accept partition
as the proper solution of the Holy
land problem.
Soviet delegate Andrei Gromyko,
in a partial disclosure of Moscow's
position, attacked segments of the
recent American proposal on Pales
tine as attempts to "complicate and
confuse" the Holy Land issue.
Gromyko said tho Big Five should
begin without delay 10 or 15 days
of "direct consultations." This was
endorsement of the principle if not
the form of the main plank of the
U. S. proposal.
The Soviet diplomat, in arguing
against the American blueprint for
a Big Five committee, said "no great
power should hide behind a com
mittee, as this could only compli
cate and delay the solution" of the
problem.
Gromyko said the big powers could
do just as well explaining their po
sition outside a committee in direct
talks, adding that this approach
would avoid delay.
"Any delay in the consideration
of these question," Gromyko r:aid,
"could not be justified in any way."
