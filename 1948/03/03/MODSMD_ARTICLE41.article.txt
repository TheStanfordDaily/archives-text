# Women of Lagunita 'Adopt' Austrian Village Via CARE
## 
### 
Lagunita Court, under diiection of the Lagunita Overseas Re
lief Committee, has adopted this year a village of the Salzburg
district of Austria, in addition to other addresses in various parts
of Europe.
Each month several boxes of food and clothing are sent out

through CARE or by individual
groups, and in many cases letters
are exchanged with the people to
whom the relief is going.
PEOPLE NEED AID
One of the first contacts made was
with an Austrian bishop who wrote,
"I can assure you that any aid
would be a most helpful gift for
some of our suffering people. . . .
In regard to the selection of cer
tain persons or families who should
receive your personal support, I'm
indeed worried ... as I do not
know how to begin and end because
the need of most of our people in
Austria and Germany is terrible and
seems to be immense in every way."
A friend of the Bishop. Hedwig
Uebersberger, who is an author,
teacher, and wife of a university
professor, wrote describing in detail
the conditions of life in Austria
since the war. She cited the rations
allowed each month, and discussed
the prices in the prohibitively high
black market.
LACK OF CLOTHING
"I think that at least half of the
Austrian population goes to bed
with a stomach calling for more
food. If you are very lucky, you can
appease, not satisfy, your hunger.
. . . The state of the Austrian ward
robes is generally this: probably the
Austrians will not yet die this year
and next by want of clothes, but
you already can pretty well ruin
your health by want of things pro
tecting you from wet and cold. . . ."
This woman speaks of moral
weariness as a fact deserving atten
tion; she reports that "not only
bodies are to be saved, but also
hearts and a bit of Western culture,
the germs of development of a bet
ter future, when Europe again will
be ... a part of the world.''
