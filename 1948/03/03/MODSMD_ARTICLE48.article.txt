women to hand out ballots and
punch student body cards. Benson
will also have to have booths set up
by the early morning deadline ready

quarter voters.
About 4 p.m. on election day,
things will be thrown into high
gear. All the ballots will be brought
into one of the rooms in the Edu
cation Building (publicly an

about 30 students who have com

the task of counting.

one student calling the names and
the other marking a tabulation

sent out for cheeseburgers and
French fries, while the counters
keep on calling votes.
About 7 p.m. KSU will have a
special events man over to do a re
mote broadcast. At. the same time,
hordes of eager candidates and their
friends will descend on the room
and add to the chaos.
About midnight, all votes will
have been counted, and close races
re-counted. Ballots will be boxed
up, an official tabulation sheet will
be drawn up. and a silent prayer
