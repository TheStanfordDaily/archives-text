# 'Treasure' Uncovered
## 
### 
There's gold in them thar hills,
men! And the Stanford Theater fin
ally offers some gold nuggets of
entertainment for long suffering
movie-goers with Warner Brother's
"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
"Sierra Madre" is an unheralded
sleeper that is a truly professional
job of movie making. It tells the
story of three men prospecting for
gold and what the yellow dust does
to them.
Though Humphrey Bogart gets
star billing, Walter Huston steals the
show. He is perfect in the role of
the gabby, philosophical oldtimer
who gets a big chuckle watching
his two companions make various
sorts of fools out of themselves.
BOG ART G RADUATES
Not that "The Hump" is a slouch
by any means. He graduates from
the Machinegun Kelly roles with an
"A" on his report card. He is con
vincing as the novice prospector who
goes nuts from too much of that
wonderful stuff—gold, that is. Tim
Holt also graduates—from Westerns
—into a starring effort as the third
member of the trio.
"Sierra Madre" is an engrossing
character study of these men under
the stress of too much riches for
their own good. Huston is the old
timer who has lived a little too long
to get upset about anything.
Bogart is the not-so-tough tough
guy, greedy but cowardly, the weak
link of the party. Holt, in contrast,
plays a young, decent joe who is
also tempted, but never yields to
the temptation.
The picture hasn't a weak point.
The secondary characters are uni
formly well cast. The incidental con
versation creates a sense of realism.
The music by Max Steiner is good.
LOCALE MEXICAN
The locale is Mexican, but the
typical Pancho and Jose Mexicans
our-puss, slinky females clutter up
are fortunately omitted. No glam
the scenery, either.
"Sierra Madre" restores your faith
in the movie industry. A simple
story, simply told, it has none of
the sickening frills that $50,000 di
rectors are prone to throw in. Emo
tionally high-pitched as it shows
some of the less-human traits of us
humans, it has its lighter moments
too. Try to see it from the beginning.

There's gold in them thar hills,
men! And the Stanford Theater fin
ally offers some gold nuggets of
entertainment for long suffering
movie-goers with Warner Brother's
"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
"Sierra Madre" is an unheralded
sleeper that is a truly professional
job of movie making. It tells the
story of three men prospecting for
gold and what the yellow dust does
to them.
Though Humphrey Bogart gets
star billing, Walter Huston steals the
show. He is perfect in the role of
the gabby, philosophical oldtimer
who gets a big chuckle watching
his two companions make various
sorts of fools out of themselves.
BOG ART G RADUATES
Not that "The Hump" is a slouch
by any means. He graduates from
the Machinegun Kelly roles with an
"A" on his report card. He is con
vincing as the novice prospector who
goes nuts from too much of that
wonderful stuff—gold, that is. Tim
Holt also graduates—from Westerns
—into a starring effort as the third
member of the trio.
"Sierra Madre" is an engrossing
character study of these men under
the stress of too much riches for
their own good. Huston is the old
timer who has lived a little too long
to get upset about anything.
Bogart is the not-so-tough tough
guy, greedy but cowardly, the weak
link of the party. Holt, in contrast,
plays a young, decent joe who is
also tempted, but never yields to
the temptation.
The picture hasn't a weak point.
The secondary characters are uni
formly well cast. The incidental con
versation creates a sense of realism.
The music by Max Steiner is good.
LOCALE MEXICAN
The locale is Mexican, but the
typical Pancho and Jose Mexicans
our-puss, slinky females clutter up
are fortunately omitted. No glam
the scenery, either.
"Sierra Madre" restores your faith
in the movie industry. A simple
story, simply told, it has none of
the sickening frills that $50,000 di
rectors are prone to throw in. Emo
tionally high-pitched as it shows
some of the less-human traits of us
humans, it has its lighter moments
too. Try to see it from the beginning.
