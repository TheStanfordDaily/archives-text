# Poor Ducks to Play Michigan; Grid Practice Begins at WSC
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Oregon's Football Coach Jim Ai
ken probably felt like the proverbial !
lamb being led to the slaughter last
week when it was announced that
the University of Michigan had been
added to his 1948 schedule.
Jim couldn't have wanted that j
game. With a big rebuilding task in
front of him, his slate was already
tough enough.
OUT OF 1 ' THE CELLAR
Last fall, in his first season at
Oregon, Aiken lifted the Webfeet
out of the PCC cellar and developed j
them into one of the top grid ma- I
chines on the coast before the year's
end. However, the star of that team, |
Jake Leicht, and a number of Ore
gon's best footballers will have |
graduated before another campaign |
lolls around.
In view of this, it is doubtful if j
Aiken felt that the Webfeet were
ready to challenge the gridiron su- j
premacy of the Goliath of the Big
Nine.
RED INK TO BLACK
Rather, it is probable that the
athletic council, anxious to convert
red ink into black, was instrumen
tal in arranging for Oregon's first
Btg Nine opponent in 52 years.
It is no secret that the Eugene ;
athletic plant has been losing money I
hand over fist in recent years. Last !
year, expenditures exceeded re
ceipts by some $15,000. In 194t! the

loss was about the same.
Everything from a raise in tuition
to a tightening of the athletic belt
had been suggested in order to bal
ance the budget. With the signing
of the Michigan game, it is obvious
that the Oregon athletic board has
decided upon a solution—schedul
ing big - time opponents. A West
Coast team in the Wolverines' huge
stadium is always good for a crowd
of 70 or 80 thousand paying cus
tomers—a factor which should aid
Oregon's sports bankroll consider
ably.
If the Michigan contest is a finan
cial success, look for Oregon to edge
more and more into the big-time
athletic picture.

Here and there: With the end of
the coast basketball season in sight,
votes are now being cast in both
divisions for the all - conference
teams.
Washington will probably place
center Jack Nichols and forward
Sammy White with WSC's Eddie
Gayda getting the other forward
spot. The two guard positions are
sure to fall to Stan Williamson of
Oregon and Cliff Crandall of OSC.

Washington State has already had
a month of spring football practice.
The Cougars take half of their al
lowed 30 outdoor workouts in Feb
ruary, and the other half in May.
