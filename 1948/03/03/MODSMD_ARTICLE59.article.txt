### JOHN BREIER 
Speculating about athletic futures
it Stanford is, to say the least, a
'ery risky procedure. Witness this
ear's football team.
Last year about this time Card
jasketball fans were saying. "Sure
ve haven't done too wen ..his year,
>ut look, we'll have every one back
lext year." And we did, except for
Dick Berlin, get the starting line
ip back.
Thus far this year Stanford has
von but two conference games.
•Vith any kind of Juck a couple of
he losses could nave been wins,
ndian conference opponents have
cored a scant 28 points more than
he Indians, and yet Stanford has
nst eight games. But that is water
inder the bridge.
\ LOOK AT NEXT YEAR
With that excuse to cover for the
Jossible missfire of the rosy picture
hat is printed here, let's take a
lander at next year's basketball
•lub.
The way things look at this time,
'Iverett Dean will have to shape the
;)49 team without the services of at
east two men.
Captain Babe Higgins and Bob
'enn are definitely to be counted
>ut. Both men have used up all
heir eligibility and this weekend's
lames will be their last for the Car
linals.
MIL STEVE RETURN?
Bill Stephenson has two years of
•ligibility remaining, but it is al
nost certain that the tall center will
3e playing only one more year.
Steve is 23 and is taking an accel
■ rated course in engineering. He is
;oing to school straight through,
ummer and all. It is possible that
le might not be back next year,
-atest information is that he will
eturn for one more season.
Dave Davidson can graduate this
fune, but will be back to use up his
ast year of eligibility. Morley
Thompson is faced with the prob
em of too many units of credit to
ro with the two years he has left.
Ie is undecided, but it is extremely
loubtful that he will play the sec
>nd one. Bight now his case is in
he "don't know class.'
lOSE, LEWIS BACK
Bill Rose has one year remaining.
-Ie played two years for Menlo Jun
or College. Bob Lewis also has one
nore year. He played on the 1944
MCAA championship Utah team and
his is his second year at Stanford.
George Yardley, Milt Iverson. Gus
Zhavalas. and Bill Drehobl have
wo more years.
It is possible that mentor Dean
,vill get some unexpected help from
unior college transfers. If so. and
1 Higgins is the only starter miss
ing when the Cards go into action
iext year, we should do well. Per
laps the Southern Division tille will
:ome back to the Farm for the first
une since 1942. After that .
(Tomorrow. John Breier will dis

Basketball team from this year's
reshman squad).

eturn for one more season.
Dave Davidson can graduate this
fune, but will be back to use up his
ast year of eligibility. Morley
Thompson is faced with the prob
em of too many units of credit to
ro with the two years he has left.
Ie is undecided, but it is extremely
loubtful that he will play the sec
>nd one. Bight now his case is in
he "don't know class.'
lOSE, LEWIS BACK
Bill Rose has one year remaining.
-Ie played two years for Menlo Jun
or College. Bob Lewis also has one
nore year. He played on the 1944
MCAA championship Utah team and
his is his second year at Stanford.
George Yardley, Milt Iverson. Gus
Zhavalas. and Bill Drehobl have
wo more years.
It is possible that mentor Dean
,vill get some unexpected help from
unior college transfers. If so. and
1 Higgins is the only starter miss
ing when the Cards go into action
iext year, we should do well. Per
laps the Southern Division tille will
:ome back to the Farm for the first
une since 1942. After that .
(Tomorrow. John Breier will dis
•uss the additions to the Varsity
Basketball team from this year's
reshman squad).
Speculating about athletic futures
it Stanford is, to say the least, a
'ery risky procedure. Witness this
ear's football team.
Last year about this time Card
jasketball fans were saying. "Sure
ve haven't done too wen ..his year,
>ut look, we'll have every one back
lext year." And we did, except for
Dick Berlin, get the starting line
ip back.
Thus far this year Stanford has
von but two conference games.
•Vith any kind of Juck a couple of
he losses could nave been wins,
ndian conference opponents have
cored a scant 28 points more than
he Indians, and yet Stanford has
nst eight games. But that is water
inder the bridge.
\ LOOK AT NEXT YEAR
With that excuse to cover for the
Jossible missfire of the rosy picture
hat is printed here, let's take a
lander at next year's basketball
•lub.
The way things look at this time,
'Iverett Dean will have to shape the
;)49 team without the services of at
east two men.
Captain Babe Higgins and Bob
'enn are definitely to be counted
>ut. Both men have used up all
heir eligibility and this weekend's
lames will be their last for the Car
linals.
MIL STEVE RETURN?
Bill Stephenson has two years of
•ligibility remaining, but it is al
nost certain that the tall center will
3e playing only one more year.
Steve is 23 and is taking an accel
■ rated course in engineering. He is
;oing to school straight through,
ummer and all. It is possible that
le might not be back next year,
