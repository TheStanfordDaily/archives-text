An unusually effective combina
tion of Stanford's choir, choxus, and
concert band was presented last
night as part of the Tuesday Even
ing series. The magnificence of the
"concertato" style of handling voices
and instruments, and the perfect
synchronization of the blended voic
es emphasized to its fullest extent
the magnificance of Gabrieli's '"In
Ecclesiis Bendicite Domini."
The rich and varied passages of
Bach's extremely difficult "Fantasia
in G Minor" were excellently ex
pressed through the organ by Mr.
Herbert B. Nanney, combining deli
cate runs with forceful crescendos.
The final selection. "Requiem" by
Faure, was made even more varied
by the work of the soloists, Joel Car
ter, baritone, Frances Agnew, so
prano, Joanne Johnson, harpist, and
the University Choir set against the
rich background of organ accompan
iment.
This presentation consisted of sev
en parts, "Introit and Kyrie," "Of
fertoire," "Sanctus," "Die Jesu,"
"Agnus Dei," "Libera Me," and "In
Paradisum."
In each was featured either a so
loist or the choir. The program, al
though composed of Stanford stud
ents, was presented to an audience
consisting mainly of visitors from
nearby towns. â€”Jacqui Atkin.
