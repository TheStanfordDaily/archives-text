# 'Stop Cal,' Card Motto
## 
### 
Determined to rock California
from its unbeaten position in the
conference standings, Stanford's
varsity cagers are hoping to upset
the dope and make their last week
end of basketball a wimvng one.
The Indians have not beaten Cali
fornia in basketball since 19-43. Al
though the '48 season has proved to
be a dismal one. it could be called
a success with a win over the Gold
en Bears.
Berkeley's unbeaten champions
need only to get past Stanford to
become the first team in Southern
Division history to make a clean
sweep of the 12-game schedule.
Led by all-conference aces Andy
Wolfe and Chuck Hanger, the Bears
possess a smooth, chance-taking five
that ranks with the best in the na
tion. They have been breaking rec
ord after record and will be out to
keep their 10-game win streak over
Stanford intact.
The varsity's practice session was
devoted to defense last night, as the
regulars were kept at work trying
to stop the mock Bear plays.
Card Jack Scharfen took the role
of Andy Wolfe, and Dick Schutte
was given the role of the high-scor
ing Hanger. Other Indians who im
itated Cal players were Don Stites
as center Jim Smith. Bill Lewis as
George Walker, and Mike Durket as
Earl Strader.
Looking good for the first-string
ers was center Bill Stephenson, who
has been hitting las shots with
amazing accuracy this week. Milt
Iverson also displayed some fine
basketball. Iverson seems to be get
ting faster every day.
Stanford has a good chance to get
out of the cellar if they can win one
game against the Bears. UCLA will
be playing USC in Los Angeles, and
the Bruins don't figure to stick with
the Trojans this time.
