## Speak Up or Shut Up 
### 
Professional campus gripers will probably be swinging into
action soon. Next week, next quarter, and next year they'll be
found in front of the Cellar or in house bull sessions loudly
arguing that Excom made the worst possible move in appropriat
ing ASSU funds for foreign student scholarships.
For the matter of granting money to bring European students
to Stanford is coming up before Excom tonight and that group
will probably vote in favor of the plan. As soon as the decision
is announced we expect a moan from the gripers.
They raised a stink last year after the plan to send two
student representatives abroad was passed. They screamed after
Excom's "no political-partisan groups" policy was announced.
They're up in arms at the drop of a hat.
Yet, how many of these gripers ever attend an Excom meeting?
The great fault with student government is not its officers,
its organization, or its purposes and processes, but the mass of
uninformed, disinterested, talkative students who offer nothing
but destructive criticisms. This vociferous herd of sheep hurts any
cause or any leader it follows.
The sincere proponents of any stand are especially dragged
down by the hue-and-cry raisers. An honest opinion is made to
look silly by unintelligent arguments.
The Daily is not donning a self-righteous mantle. But we have
observed that the people who make the most noise on campus
are usually the ones who are least informed on the issues at stake.
The foreign students scholarship plan furnishes fodder for
one of the biggest campus issues this year. Many persons will
be talking through their hats about it. Why don't you find out
something about the plan before condemning or supporting it?
A final word to the inevitable gripers. If you have some opin
ion on the foreign student scholarship plan, come to Excom to
night and speak your mind. Or at least, let your Excom represent
ative know what you think. Don't stay away tonight and then
moan and groan the rest of the year.
