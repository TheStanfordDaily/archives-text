## The 						Ability to Teach 
### 
To the Editor:
There exists at Stanford, and many other universities for that matter,
a situation to which attention should be brought. It concerns the ability
of many of our instructors to teach. In my own brief tenure at Stanford,
one of my courses each quarter has been so poorly taught that its \ uiue
to me is considerably less than it should have been. In addition, these
courses required far more than their proportional share of work.
Most of my poor courses have been taught by instructors with high
standing in their own departments. All have been friendly and sinceiel..
interested in teaching, but I doubt if any knew what chaos he â– was pio
ducing in the minds of his students.
There are two general methods by which these courses may be im
proved. First, by the reorganization of the course material; and second,
by allowing someone else to teach the elementary courses, where most
of the trouble is caused.
There is a simple and inoffensive method for the instructors to get an
idea of the sort of a job they have been doing. One instructor passed
out a mimeographed form which had several specific questions about the
course and a space where the students could write any furthei comments.
Signatures were not required or prohibited.
This letter is not intended or should be construed as criticism of
any single course. It is only a suggestion for a remed\ of an undesit
able situation.
