To the Editor:
My heartiest congratulations to Georgie 3runn. At last he seems to
be getting the ungarbled word. On the 26th of February he wrote. The
Communists are, despite their pretenses of respectability, a revolutionary
party fundamentally opposed to parliamentary government." While this
might be a surprising revelation to that writer of "History 1948. mam
people have rather suspected that fact for almost a century. He also stated
that the Czech coup d' etat was somewhat of a shock. Where has "our
historian" been for the last decade? Doesn't he remember Finland.' . . .
or does he view that dastardly attack as merely another "defensive" move
against a threatening powerful neighbor? Yes, George, the realities ot
life are bitter.
We don't need any more of the wishy-washy appeasement tactics of
self-styled liberals. What we need is the determined leadership of real
men with guts enough to face Uncle Joes rabbleâ€”men who will grind
them into dust, so that a lasting peace built on a world federation can
arise from the destruction of the Soviet evil. We have defeated brown
shirted and black-shirted Fascism, now it must be apparent even to
those of our lunatic, fringe (one Presidential candidate excepted) that
before we can have permanent peace red Fascism must be crushed.
Mr. Brunn ends by saying, "What price life?" The ansv to that is:
the price is never too dear when a righteous cause and human dignity
are at stake.
