WASHINGTON (UP) —The old controversy over
civilian vs. military control of atomic energy is
smoldering still.
The administration, the military high command,
and a majority of congressmen, informed sources
say, are just as strong for civilian control now as
they were when it was established by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1946.
But many who then wanted atomic controls left
in army hands still feel—judging by recent signs—
that the country's No. 1 military weapon should
be entrusted solely to the military. They do not
think it enough that the law provides for close
liaison between the civilian Atomic Energy Coin
mission and the armed forces.
The dissidents are not in controlling adminis
tration or military posts. But the Atomic Energy
Commission nevertheless has indicated repeatedly
that it is sensitive to their views.
For many months, as though to reassure those
persons, the commission has been stating and re
stating that it is doing its utmost to perfect atomic
weapons.
In a report to Congress last July 22 the com
mission said it was pushing "production of fissionable
materials and the improvement of atomic weapons."
Last Dec. 2 Chairman David E. Lilienthal report
ed '"improvement of atomic weapons." Two weeks
later he said about the same thing and on Jan. 19
reiterated it.
On Jan. :><) Commissioner Robert F. Bacher re
ported "significant new work on the development
of weapons." On Jan. !J1 the commission told Con
gress it was making progress in the improvement of
atomic weapons and the standardization of parts to
assure continuous production.
The next day the commission read an editorial
criticism of civilian handling of atomic bomb mat
ters. It was itself accused of wasting time on yet
to-be-established peace-time benefits of atomic
energy.
Then, on Feb. 2, Maj. Gen. Leslie 11. Groves, the
man who headed the atomic energy project when it
was under army control, spoke up on retiring to
private life. He said research in peace-time uses ol
atomic energy "should never be permitted to divert
us from our original purpose—the defense of the
United States."
The commission is obligated by law to push both
military and peace-time applications of atomic
energy while at the same time making sure there
are no security leaks. Concerning the dual obli
gation. Bacher in a recent speech to a group of
scientists said:
'"On the one hand, the Atomic Energy Commis
sion is charged with development and production
of atomic weapons. On the other hand, it is asked
to promote vigorously the peaceful uses of atomic
energy and the dissemination of scientific and tech
nical information.
"It is very difficult to pursue at the same time
both objectives with maximum effectiveness. This,
nevertheless, is the job."
The only peace-time application of atomic energy
thus far has been use of radioactive isotopes—by
products of bomb manufacture—for research. The
commission said in its latest report to Congress that
that alone ultimately will more than repay the
nation's $2,500,000,000 atomic investment.
It concedes, however, that practical power from
atomic energy probably is still about 20 years away.
But arguments that atomic energy is a "bomb
and nothing else" are. in Lilienthal's view, "pure
moonshine,"

But arguments that atomic energy is a "bomb
and nothing else" are. in Lilienthal's view, "pure
moonshine,"
WASHINGTON (UP) —The old controversy over
civilian vs. military control of atomic energy is
smoldering still.
The administration, the military high command,
and a majority of congressmen, informed sources
say, are just as strong for civilian control now as
they were when it was established by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1946.
But many who then wanted atomic controls left
in army hands still feel—judging by recent signs—
that the country's No. 1 military weapon should
be entrusted solely to the military. They do not
think it enough that the law provides for close
liaison between the civilian Atomic Energy Coin
mission and the armed forces.
The dissidents are not in controlling adminis
tration or military posts. But the Atomic Energy
Commission nevertheless has indicated repeatedly
that it is sensitive to their views.
For many months, as though to reassure those
persons, the commission has been stating and re
stating that it is doing its utmost to perfect atomic
weapons.
In a report to Congress last July 22 the com
mission said it was pushing "production of fissionable
materials and the improvement of atomic weapons."
Last Dec. 2 Chairman David E. Lilienthal report
ed '"improvement of atomic weapons." Two weeks
later he said about the same thing and on Jan. 19
reiterated it.
On Jan. :><) Commissioner Robert F. Bacher re
ported "significant new work on the development
of weapons." On Jan. !J1 the commission told Con
gress it was making progress in the improvement of
atomic weapons and the standardization of parts to
assure continuous production.
The next day the commission read an editorial
criticism of civilian handling of atomic bomb mat
ters. It was itself accused of wasting time on yet
to-be-established peace-time benefits of atomic
energy.
Then, on Feb. 2, Maj. Gen. Leslie 11. Groves, the
man who headed the atomic energy project when it
was under army control, spoke up on retiring to
private life. He said research in peace-time uses ol
atomic energy "should never be permitted to divert
us from our original purpose—the defense of the
United States."
The commission is obligated by law to push both
military and peace-time applications of atomic
energy while at the same time making sure there
are no security leaks. Concerning the dual obli
gation. Bacher in a recent speech to a group of
scientists said:
'"On the one hand, the Atomic Energy Commis
sion is charged with development and production
of atomic weapons. On the other hand, it is asked
to promote vigorously the peaceful uses of atomic
energy and the dissemination of scientific and tech
nical information.
"It is very difficult to pursue at the same time
both objectives with maximum effectiveness. This,
nevertheless, is the job."
The only peace-time application of atomic energy
thus far has been use of radioactive isotopes—by
products of bomb manufacture—for research. The
commission said in its latest report to Congress that
that alone ultimately will more than repay the
nation's $2,500,000,000 atomic investment.
It concedes, however, that practical power from
atomic energy probably is still about 20 years away.
