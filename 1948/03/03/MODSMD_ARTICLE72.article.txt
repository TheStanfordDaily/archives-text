That villainous gargoyle "Expenses and Finances"'
seems to have crept into every phase of University
life nowadays. He puts the skids to new building
and roads, to new equipment, and to higher faculty
salaries. Now I find that it has slipped past the
portals of our Hoover Library of War, Revolution,
and Peace.
Compared with actual campus necessities it's i
relatively trivial library matter that this character
interferes with. Every Sunday disappointed visitors
back away from the Farm's dominating Tower be
cause old man Expenses prohibits employment of a
salaried library staff member and six or eight vol
unteer students, and Sunday Libe tours are "im
possible."
Research Associate and Curator Mrs. Inez G
Richardson said the Library has a very small staff

for the work that must be done
To open the Tower on Sunday for
visitors would mean over-taxing
the responsibilities undersized
staff wades through the other six
days of the week. The Library
does compensate for Sunday clos
ures, however, by opening its doors
to visitors all day Saturday from.
112 9:30 a.m. to noon and from 1:30 to
4 p.m. The Tower is opened on.
week-days trom 2 to 4 p.m.
I Even if some student group,

such as Cardinals, organized a number of volun
teer student guides on Sunday, at least one Library
staff member would have to be present to direct
the operations. This handicap is present because
Hoover Library bookrooms cannot be locked up.
Hoping off an area or setting up screens with "No
Admittance" signs do not faze the efforts of many
of the younger visitors nor satisfy the curiosity
of a few of the oldsters.
Many of us students take the Tower for granted,
too many have never been to the top. We long i'ut
the weekends when we go to the Top of the Mark,
but at the Top of the Libe not even coke machines
exist.
This columnist holds that Hoover Library service
should be extended to include Sunday, though iz
would involve the expense of hiring another staff
member. Too many disappointed guests miss a view
uncomparatle to those even observed from a low
flying airplane or from Skyline boulevard.

The boys over at the SAE house are embarking
on a praiseworthy landscaping project this year.
House Manager Paul Mallonee described the work
as a pledge project. This quarter the new brother?
dug up the old, splotchy lawn, re-seeded the turf,
and now rake the re-seeded area every Saturday
Water shortage difficulties, however, may defeat the
landscaping this quarter because the house must
depend on the rain supply for moisture.
Situated as it is right across the street from the
Post Office, the ancient SAE house demands more
exterior attention than other houses. A new lawn L?
only the first part of the SAE long range rehabili
tation program for the house.
If the water shortage is eased next quarter, the
pledges will enliven the house's frontyard with a
new flower bed. a number of small shrubs, and a
decorative brick walk. During summer quarter,
the front of the house will get a new coat of paint
Mallonee said costs of the project are covered
by house profits. No personal assessments are levied
because end-of-the-month profits go into this reha
bilitation fund. The SAE's are setting a fine ex
ample for the rest of the Row, and several other
houses might do well to follow their lead if the
water shortage disappears.

Many of us students take the Tower for granted,
too many have never been to the top. We long i'ut
the weekends when we go to the Top of the Mark,

exist.

The boys over at the SAE house are embarking
on a praiseworthy landscaping project this year.
House Manager Paul Mallonee described the work
as a pledge project. This quarter the new brother?
dug up the old, splotchy lawn, re-seeded the turf,
and now rake the re-seeded area every Saturday
Water shortage difficulties, however, may defeat the
landscaping this quarter because the house must
depend on the rain supply for moisture.
Situated as it is right across the street from the
Post Office, the ancient SAE house demands more
exterior attention than other houses. A new lawn L?
only the first part of the SAE long range rehabili
tation program for the house.
If the water shortage is eased next quarter, the
pledges will enliven the house's frontyard with a
new flower bed. a number of small shrubs, and a
decorative brick walk. During summer quarter,
the front of the house will get a new coat of paint
Mallonee said costs of the project are covered
by house profits. No personal assessments are levied
because end-of-the-month profits go into this reha
bilitation fund. The SAE's are setting a fine ex
ample for the rest of the Row, and several other
houses might do well to follow their lead if the
water shortage disappears.

That villainous gargoyle "Expenses and Finances"'
seems to have crept into every phase of University
life nowadays. He puts the skids to new building

salaries. Now I find that it has slipped past the
portals of our Hoover Library of War, Revolution,
and Peace.
