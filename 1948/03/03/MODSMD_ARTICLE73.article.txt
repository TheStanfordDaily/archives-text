## Bull Session 
### 
Went to a party last Saturday night.
This party was different than a lot I've seen.
No one ran in and yeiled:
"All right, party's on—everybody get drunk."
This was a genteel party. That is to say the
hostess had shoes on when the party started and
was fully dressed when the party ended.
Trouble with those genteel parties is they are
so slow getting started. The atmosphere is as
though everyone had taken a course in how to be
the life of the party by playing the piano, and
when they arrived there was no piano.
You need three courses to help you be the life
of the party: piano lessons from a correspondence
school, dancing from Arthur Murray's, and Mar
riage and the Family from Stanford.
In order to stimulate a little conversation at the
party, one of the girls started reading palms. I

had my palm read and found that
I have a very long life line. As
a matter of fact it was still going
strong when it reached my elbow.
The girl guessed I would live to
be a thousand years old. but I re
fused to take off my shirt just to
corroborate her prediction.
She also told fortunes by cards.
Before she started, everyone had
to make a wish. For the most part,
I am a contented person so I mere
ly wished Dr. I. Q. would go east

when he leaves Little Rock. When she told my for
tune, the cards disclosed two fair ladies in my life.
Both of them were in the balcony.
Later in the evening we danced. I would be a

beautiful dancer if it weren't for two things—my
feet! Of course. I'm really not bad. it's just that
no one does the big apple any more. I never got
around to taking dancing lessons, although I diJ
wrestle for the Gettysburg Athletic Club.
At the party I won the first dance in two min
utes and thirty seconds using a Boston toe hold.
I wish the song writers would quit writing
Sambas though. We danced so many sambas that
I just about wore out my Tico Tico. Sambas are
quite the thing in society these days. You're strictly
a square if you can't samba and quote from the
Kinsey report.
Not every one is happy with dancing though. I
heard one co-ed complain once that modern dancing
was just necking set to music. Seems that she didn't
like the music.
And speaking of modern dancing. I see that a
ballet company is coming to San Jose soon.
I'll never forget the drunk that sat next to me
the only time I went to the ballet.
He went to sleep waiting for the show to start.
He awoke only after the ballet had begun. He wiped
his eyes, brushed the chaser from his lips, and
peered cautiously over the person in front of him.
There on the stage, in the softness of the spotlight,
twirled a ballerina. Her lithe body bent to and fro
as she dipped her hands toward the footlights. Her
rosy figure in pastel tights, was like a nude Aphro
dite, chisled in pink marble. For some minutes our
friend sat spellbound, his eyes riveted to the sway
ing body.
Then he loosed his tongue, for he could no longer
hold his peace.
"Gad!" he hissed, "double-jointed."
