# Council Lenient To Code Offender
## 
### 
Men's Council yesterday found
one student guilty of violating the
Honor Code and suspended one fine
for parking violation.
Honor Code violation concerned a
student in an introductory art
course using another student's work
as a basis for his own. Council con
sideered this a technical violation of
the Code, however inadvertent.
Council felt that intangible values
in art rendered the circumstances
extenuating and that extreme len
iency was in order. Punishment for
the offense was confined to a repri
mand, which will be recorded on
the student's transcript.
Fine for parking in the restricted
lot at the Geology corner was sus
pended because it was felt that it
had not been made sufficiently clear
that the lot was restricted.
Attending yesterday's council
meeting were Fred Hannum, chair
man; Dave Guyer, secretary; A 1
Munk, Tom Diamond, Bill Richard
son, and Jack Little, Daily repre
sentative.
