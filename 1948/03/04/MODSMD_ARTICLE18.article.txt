When the seniors sponsored their first moonlight ferry boat |
dance several weeks ago, they found their unusual theme to be
so popular that they sponsored a second ferry boat dance the

were finally going to get some rec
ognition. Rally Com announced that

iiad to weigh 150 pounds or more.
The purpose behind this rule was
j "to promote bigger and better wo
manhood."
"BIGGER AND BETTER"
Stanford women, however, were
not inspired to become "bigger and
better." A former queen of the
: Masque Ball even accused the insti
| gators of the plan of having been
bribed by a San Francisco corset
manufacturer. This and similar pro-
I tests forced Rally Com to lower the
| minimum weight to 105 pounds.

taining a free ticket was released
I over the History Corner. This dance

slides, and other "dangerous infantile
gee-gaws" were eliminated from the
