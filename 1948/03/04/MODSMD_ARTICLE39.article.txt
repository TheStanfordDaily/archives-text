## 
### JACK BLOOD 
Dick Flatland and Dave Stott collaborated to pitch a five-hit
shutout as the Stanford varsity baseballers blanked the Bank
of America, 5 to 0, on the Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon.
The win was the Cards' fifth straight.
Flatland gave up five singles in his six-inning stint, while

Stotl held the Bankers hit less the"
rest of the way. Third baseman Bill
A rce led the skimpy attack, collect
ing two of the Indians' six hits.
The Tribe jumped off to a one
run lead in the first when walks to
Ted Nell and Charlie Cole, coupled
with an error on an attempted pick
off play, sent Nell across the plate.
An error by the first baseman
and singles by Arce and Buck
Brownson pushed across another
run in the fourth. The two hits
were the first off pitcher Perasso
whose slow delivery seemed to
puzzle the Card batters.
THREE RUNS SCOIiE
Stanford sewed up the game in ,
the fifth when three runs clattered j
across the plate. Flatland opened 1
the inning with a walk and moved
to second on Nell's single. Dick |
scored and Ted went to second
when the second baseman dropped
a pickoff throw. Charlie Cole fol
lowed with a hit that moved Nell i
to third.
Another muff by the second base- '
man on Cole's steal permitted Nell
to score and move Charlie lo third. '
Two strikeouts left Charlie on :
third, but Arce came through with i
his second hit to score Cole.
Another Card threat in the sixth
died after two walks and a hit bats
man had loaded the bases. The In
dian hitting was very spotty yester- !
day and seven men were left on '
base.
