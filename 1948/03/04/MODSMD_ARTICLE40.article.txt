# Frosh Batmen Host to Lincoln
## 
### 
The Stanford freshmen will be
after their fourth straight diamond
win this afternoon when they play
host fo Abraham Lincoln High
School of San Jose. The game will
be played on the frosh diamond at
3 p.m.
Coach Charley Bushong has been
highly pleased with the team's per
formance to date. The team has
been hitting well, and last Monday's
game with Jefferson High showed
that the yearlings' fielding and
pitching have improved.
The most pleasant surprise in last
Monday's game was Lefty Lloyd
Westphal's improved control, as he
limited Jefferson to three hits in his
four-inning appearance. Denny Tuf
fanelli, who had been hampered by
overwork, also looked good in his
three-inning stretch.
Defensively, the frosh have cut
down their mechanical errors. How
ever, their worst fault now is the
"mental" error, which crops up in
such forms as throwing to the
wrong base, and making ouls the
hard way instead of employing the
simple force play. Lineup:
Bob Ames, ss; Dick Vande. rf; Sal
Coletto, 3b; Jim Trabucco, If; Larry
Fink, cf; Don McComber, lb; Ken
La Crosse, 2b; John Herbold, c; and
Tuffanelli, p.
