# Injuns, Bears Have Tangled In Hardwood Arena Since '12
## 
### 
Tlie history of the Stanford-Cali
| fornia basketball series is not a
| happy one for the Cardinals. The
j traditional rivals have met on the
hardwoods 107 times, with Cal com
ing out on top on 75 of those occa
j sions.
The series dates back to 1912, but
basketball was so litt'e thought of
in those days that results of the
"Rme do not appear in either the
Daily Palo Alto or the Quad of that
: year. All we know is that Cal won.
In 1917 Stanford joined the Pa
| eifie Coast Basketball Conference,
! and the cage sport came into its own
S on the Farm. In that first year of
] conference play, the Indians drop-
I ped two games to their Berkeley
foes, 20 to 14 and 29 to 20.
! The Cardinals won their first Cal
i series in 1920. as Swede Righter led
; them to two straight victories over
j the Bears and to the conference
j championship.
CROWD OF 10,000
Again in 1921 the series was taken
i by Stanford, this time in two out of
] three games. The deciding game
I drew 10.000 persons to the Oakland
| Auditorium as forward Jimmy Da
i vies and center Bert Mills scored
j all of Stanford's 25 points, which
| were enough to beat the Berkeley
j ites by eight points.
Between '21 and '36, the best years
for the Indians were 1923 and 1929.
In the former year, Stanford, led by

Nip Mel lose, forced the Bears to
j three games for the series. The sec
ond game was apparently a thriller,
judging by. Don Liebendorfer's ac
count in the Daily Palo Alto. Mc-
I Hose won for the Cardinals with a
free throw in the last minute. Score
! was 18 to 17.
ROTIIERT STARS
Captain Harlow Rothert, one of
Stanford's all-lime greats, was on
the scene in '29 and with the help
of Vance Fawcett he brought the
Indians a second place in the south
ern division race.
In 1£34 the Indians knocked Cal
out of the championship with a 34
to 20 upset win, but as usual lost
the series, three games to one. The
next year Stanford again took one
game out of four, the victory being
only the third scored on the home
floor since construction of the Pa
vilion in 1925. .
Then came Luisetti —the immortal
Hank—plus Art Stoefen, Jack Cal
derwood, Howie Turner, and Dinty
Moore. Good as this team was, how
ever, it could not entirely break the
Cal jinx its first year. The series
was split, Cal catching fire to win
the final game G3 to 30. at that time
a record for conference play.
LUISETTI AGAIN
Finally, in 1937, Stanford came
through with three straight victories
over the Bears before losing the last
game of the series. In their final
year Luisetti and Co. again whip
ped the Bears thrice and lost one.
All three of these years, Stanford
was conference champion.
In 1939 and 1940 he had fair suc
cess, splitting even with the Bears.
In 1941 i! was three to one, Stan
ford. and in 1942 the NCAA cham
pionship team of Don Burness, Jim
Pollard. F.d Voss. Howie Dallmar,
and Bill Cowrlen swept the Cal se
ries for the first time since 1920.
Cal won one game of four in 1943,
and since then has scored 10 straight
wins over the Cards, in 1946, 1947,
and the first two erames this year.
