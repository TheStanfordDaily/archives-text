Yesterday this column gave a
ief runover of the standout var
y basketball players expected to
turn next year. Today it will con
rn the merits and prospects of
me of the lads on this year's
eshman squad.
The freshman team of 1948 is
ore like the frosh teams of pre
ir days. The players are younger,
ost of them just out of high school,
d as a rule, it is harder to crack
e squad than before.
Stanford's class of '51 basketball
s have, like the varsity, looked
ry good on some nights and just
e opposite on others. Their rec
d stands at eight wins and four
xses with two contests with the
il frosh left to play. The Card
arlings won the first two eneoun
*s.
That brings vis around -to the
obable replacements from this
ar's l'reshman squad.
V\A LIKES HIS BOYS
Those fans who have followed the
arlings this year have been sing
• the praises of three lads in par
ular. Coach Jack Dana thinks all
e of his starters will see a lot of
ion during the next three years.
go along with Dana.
Marvin Gelber is perhaps the best
'ii on the squad. He should come

is a steady guard who can make
• points if he shoots. A two
nded set shot from outside the
il circle is his specialty, but he is
o-good on the boards.
!»: SCORING WATSONS
forwards Paul Watson and Fran
itson will certainly place on the
rsity. Both lads have the trait
it all coaches like—they can hit
■ hoop, but good. Paul has led
• team in scoring and, despite his
k of real height, he is a fine re
and man.
•""ran Watson has the height and
mid develop into one of the best
yers Stanford has seen in some
le. He is a hustler and if his bad
ee lets him go all out. watch him.
EGG AND HEKRON
7he other two starters are Cap
i Dick Clegg and center Bill
iron. Both are fine ball players,
na rates Clegg as the most im
>ved man on the team.

1 Bill was the lad. He had never
yed the pivot slot before; for

001. He can hit from the outside
lot from the post.
UGH HOAI) AHEAD
hese five players will have a
d time breaking into the lineup
it year for the simple reason that

re right now.
'ime alone will tell just how

them short.
