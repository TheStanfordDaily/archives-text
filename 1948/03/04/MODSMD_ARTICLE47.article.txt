# NCAA Swimming Meet in Three Weeks; Cards Challenge Fullerton on Friday
## 
### 
The finest field of men in the
history of swimming will assemble
at the University of Michigan pool
three weeks hence, for the 25th an
nual NCAA swimming and diving
championships
A number of world, American,
and national collegiate records
should fall before the onslaught of
the star-studded aggregation before
the three-day meet ends on March
27.
Leading the attack on the old
marks will be such famous names in
swimming as , Ohio State's Ei!l
Smith. LaSalle's one - man swim
ming team, Joe Verdeur, Yale's Al
len Stack, and Dick Weinberg.
Harry Holiday, and Bob Sohl of
Michigan, to name but a few.
109 MARK BETTERED
As an example of how tough the
competition will be, last year's 100-
yard freestyle championship race
was won by Dick Weinberg of
Michigan in 52.2 seconds. Four col
legiate swimmers have already been
under :52 flat this season.
The same holds true for nearly all
of the events, with stiff competition
expected particularly in the middle
distance races. Hawaiian-born Bill
Smith of Chio State is given a good
chance to lower his own world rec
ord in the 220. Georce Hoogerhyde
of Michigan State, last year's 1,500-
yard champ. Joe Verdeur, Washing
ton's Pete Powilson. and Ralph Sala
of Stanford shouldn't be far behind
in either the 220 or 440.
Sprint champ Dick Weinberg will
find plenty of competition in both
the 50- and 100-yard races. Wally |
Ris of lowa recently set a new NC
AA record for the distance, and de
throned champs Halo Hirose and
Bob Anderson will both be out to
get their titles back.
BREASTSTROKE RECORD
Joe Verdeur, who set a new world i
breaststroke record for 200 yards at
last year's championship meet held
in Seattle, will have to work hard
to keep his title. At least three i
swimmers should be under 2:17 fiat
this year.
Adolf Keifer's eight - year - old
world backstroke record is in dan
ger of falling to either Allan Stack
or Harry Holiday. Holiday at pres- !
ent holds the NCAA, while Stack j
has been unofficially timed below ;
the world figure. In the terrific duel
that is expected in the 150-yard !
race, the world record should fall
to the winner.
As for the team title, the defend- j
ing champion Ohio State team is
expected to repeat because of its |
great strength in the diving events, :
but not by such a large margin as in \

previous years. Hie Buckeyes have
lost many stars through graduation,
but if Miller Anderson and his crew
of divers succeed in taking the first
four places in both diving events as
they did last year, the Staters will
be tough to beat.
MICHIGAN STRONG
Closely pressing the Buckeyes
will be last year's runner-up, the
University of Michigan. The Wol
verines have terrific power in the
swimming events, particularly the
relays, although the quality of their
diving does not measure up to that
of Ohio State.
Stanford placed third in last
year's championship meet held at
the University of Washington pool.
However, because of the great trav
eling distance, the Indians will not
be able to send a full squad this
year, and should therefore not be
considered as a serious team threat.
Despite the unusually strong
competition, the Farm swimmers
should fare well in the distance,
sprint, backstroke, breaststroke, and
medley relay events, according to
Coach Tom Havnie.

Farm swimming fans will have an
opportnity to see the country's top
junior college team in action tomor
row afternoon, when Fullerton JC
meets the Stanford varsity at the
Encina pools.
Coached by the nationally rec
ognized swimming and water polo
authority James Smith, Fullerton
teams have for years been among
the leaders in Western swimming
circles. Last season, the Fullerton
squad set five new NCAA junior
college records, and took the meas
ure of both the USC and UCLA
teams.
Among the veterans of that team
who return to form the nucleus of
this season's Hornet squad are Ernie
Polte, undoubtedly the best junior
college breaststroker in the country;
Frank Foucher, holder of two NC
AA junior college backstroke rec
ords; and Ed Illsley, a speedy free
styler who could give the Indians
plenty of trouble in the middle dis
tance events.
Thus far this season, Polte has
shattered the NCAA 220 - yard
breaststroke record, and the Hor
nets' four-man 400-yard relay team
has swept to a new national JC
mark of 3:4.l—an average of :55.7
per man. Time: 3:30 p.m.


808 ANDERSON, captain of the
Stanford swimming team, will lead
the Cards against Fullerton JC
tomorrow afternoon in the En
ema Pool. Anderson will be going
after meet records in both the
50-yd. and 100-yd. free-style
events.

109 MARK BETTERED
As an example of how tough the
competition will be, last year's 100-
yard freestyle championship race
was won by Dick Weinberg of
Michigan in 52.2 seconds. Four col
legiate swimmers have already been
under :52 flat this season.
The same holds true for nearly all
of the events, with stiff competition
expected particularly in the middle
distance races. Hawaiian-born Bill
Smith of Chio State is given a good
chance to lower his own world rec
ord in the 220. Georce Hoogerhyde
of Michigan State, last year's 1,500-
yard champ. Joe Verdeur, Washing
ton's Pete Powilson. and Ralph Sala
of Stanford shouldn't be far behind
in either the 220 or 440.
Sprint champ Dick Weinberg will
find plenty of competition in both
the 50- and 100-yard races. Wally |
Ris of lowa recently set a new NC
AA record for the distance, and de
throned champs Halo Hirose and
Bob Anderson will both be out to
get their titles back.
BREASTSTROKE RECORD
Joe Verdeur, who set a new world i
breaststroke record for 200 yards at
last year's championship meet held
in Seattle, will have to work hard
to keep his title. At least three i
swimmers should be under 2:17 fiat
this year.
Adolf Keifer's eight - year - old
world backstroke record is in dan
ger of falling to either Allan Stack
or Harry Holiday. Holiday at pres- !
ent holds the NCAA, while Stack j
has been unofficially timed below ;
the world figure. In the terrific duel
that is expected in the 150-yard !
race, the world record should fall
to the winner.
As for the team title, the defend- j
ing champion Ohio State team is
expected to repeat because of its |
great strength in the diving events, :
but not by such a large margin as in \

previous years. Hie Buckeyes have
lost many stars through graduation,
but if Miller Anderson and his crew
of divers succeed in taking the first
four places in both diving events as
they did last year, the Staters will
be tough to beat.
MICHIGAN STRONG
Closely pressing the Buckeyes
will be last year's runner-up, the
University of Michigan. The Wol
verines have terrific power in the
swimming events, particularly the
relays, although the quality of their
diving does not measure up to that
of Ohio State.
Stanford placed third in last
year's championship meet held at
the University of Washington pool.
However, because of the great trav
eling distance, the Indians will not
be able to send a full squad this
year, and should therefore not be
considered as a serious team threat.
Despite the unusually strong
competition, the Farm swimmers
should fare well in the distance,
sprint, backstroke, breaststroke, and
medley relay events, according to
Coach Tom Havnie.

Farm swimming fans will have an
opportnity to see the country's top
junior college team in action tomor
row afternoon, when Fullerton JC
meets the Stanford varsity at the
Encina pools.
Coached by the nationally rec
ognized swimming and water polo
authority James Smith, Fullerton
teams have for years been among
the leaders in Western swimming
circles. Last season, the Fullerton
squad set five new NCAA junior
college records, and took the meas
ure of both the USC and UCLA
teams.
Among the veterans of that team
who return to form the nucleus of
this season's Hornet squad are Ernie
Polte, undoubtedly the best junior
college breaststroker in the country;
Frank Foucher, holder of two NC
AA junior college backstroke rec
ords; and Ed Illsley, a speedy free
styler who could give the Indians
plenty of trouble in the middle dis
tance events.
Thus far this season, Polte has
shattered the NCAA 220 - yard
breaststroke record, and the Hor
nets' four-man 400-yard relay team
has swept to a new national JC
mark of 3:4.l—an average of :55.7
per man. Time: 3:30 p.m.


808 ANDERSON, captain of the
Stanford swimming team, will lead
the Cards against Fullerton JC
tomorrow afternoon in the En
ema Pool. Anderson will be going
after meet records in both the
50-yd. and 100-yd. free-style
events.
The finest field of men in the
history of swimming will assemble
at the University of Michigan pool
three weeks hence, for the 25th an
nual NCAA swimming and diving
championships
A number of world, American,
and national collegiate records
should fall before the onslaught of
the star-studded aggregation before
the three-day meet ends on March
27.
Leading the attack on the old
marks will be such famous names in

expected particularly in the middle
distance races. Hawaiian-born Bill
Smith of Chio State is given a good
chance to lower his own world rec
ord in the 220. Georce Hoogerhyde
of Michigan State, last year's 1,500-
yard champ. Joe Verdeur, Washing
ton's Pete Powilson. and Ralph Sala
of Stanford shouldn't be far behind
in either the 220 or 440.
Sprint champ Dick Weinberg will
find plenty of competition in both
the 50- and 100-yard races. Wally |
Ris of lowa recently set a new NC
AA record for the distance, and de
throned champs Halo Hirose and
Bob Anderson will both be out to
get their titles back.
BREASTSTROKE RECORD
Joe Verdeur, who set a new world i
breaststroke record for 200 yards at
last year's championship meet held
in Seattle, will have to work hard
to keep his title. At least three i
swimmers should be under 2:17 fiat
this year.
Adolf Keifer's eight - year - old
world backstroke record is in dan
ger of falling to either Allan Stack
or Harry Holiday. Holiday at pres- !
ent holds the NCAA, while Stack j
has been unofficially timed below ;
the world figure. In the terrific duel
that is expected in the 150-yard !
race, the world record should fall
to the winner.
As for the team title, the defend- j
ing champion Ohio State team is
expected to repeat because of its |
great strength in the diving events, :
but not by such a large margin as in \

previous years. Hie Buckeyes have
lost many stars through graduation,
but if Miller Anderson and his crew
of divers succeed in taking the first
four places in both diving events as
they did last year, the Staters will
be tough to beat.
MICHIGAN STRONG
Closely pressing the Buckeyes
will be last year's runner-up, the
University of Michigan. The Wol
verines have terrific power in the
swimming events, particularly the
relays, although the quality of their
diving does not measure up to that
of Ohio State.
Stanford placed third in last
year's championship meet held at
the University of Washington pool.
However, because of the great trav
eling distance, the Indians will not
be able to send a full squad this
year, and should therefore not be
considered as a serious team threat.
Despite the unusually strong
competition, the Farm swimmers
should fare well in the distance,
sprint, backstroke, breaststroke, and
medley relay events, according to
Coach Tom Havnie.

Farm swimming fans will have an
opportnity to see the country's top
junior college team in action tomor
row afternoon, when Fullerton JC
meets the Stanford varsity at the
Encina pools.
Coached by the nationally rec
ognized swimming and water polo
authority James Smith, Fullerton
teams have for years been among
the leaders in Western swimming
circles. Last season, the Fullerton
squad set five new NCAA junior
college records, and took the meas
ure of both the USC and UCLA
teams.
Among the veterans of that team
who return to form the nucleus of
this season's Hornet squad are Ernie
Polte, undoubtedly the best junior
college breaststroker in the country;
Frank Foucher, holder of two NC
AA junior college backstroke rec
ords; and Ed Illsley, a speedy free
styler who could give the Indians
plenty of trouble in the middle dis
tance events.
Thus far this season, Polte has
shattered the NCAA 220 - yard
breaststroke record, and the Hor
nets' four-man 400-yard relay team
has swept to a new national JC
mark of 3:4.l—an average of :55.7
per man. Time: 3:30 p.m.


808 ANDERSON, captain of the
Stanford swimming team, will lead
the Cards against Fullerton JC
tomorrow afternoon in the En
ema Pool. Anderson will be going
after meet records in both the
50-yd. and 100-yd. free-style
events.
The finest field of men in the
history of swimming will assemble
at the University of Michigan pool
three weeks hence, for the 25th an
nual NCAA swimming and diving
championships
A number of world, American,
and national collegiate records
should fall before the onslaught of
the star-studded aggregation before
the three-day meet ends on March
27.
Leading the attack on the old
marks will be such famous names in
swimming as , Ohio State's Ei!l
Smith. LaSalle's one - man swim
ming team, Joe Verdeur, Yale's Al
len Stack, and Dick Weinberg.
Harry Holiday, and Bob Sohl of
Michigan, to name but a few.
109 MARK BETTERED
As an example of how tough the
competition will be, last year's 100-
yard freestyle championship race
was won by Dick Weinberg of
Michigan in 52.2 seconds. Four col
legiate swimmers have already been
under :52 flat this season.
