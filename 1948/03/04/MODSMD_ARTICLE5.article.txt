# FOREIGN STUDENTS PLAN
## Referendum Will Take Place Next Quarter 
### 
By a vote of 11 to 2, Excom last
night approved the authorization of
a maximum of $9,050 for foreign
scholarships pending a vote by the
entire student body next quarter on
the proposal.
A petition requiring the scholar
ship plan be put up before the en
tire student body for final approval
was presented to Excom. An election
will therefore be called within the
first four weeks of spring quarter.
Bob Coate, chairman of the for
eign scholarship committee, said
the maximum expenses of a foreign
student for one year would be:
A full survey of SIRO activities re
s4oo for transportation (round trip);
$50 for books; $20 for spending
money; and $25 for vacation money,
if necessary.
It would therefore cost $1,155
maximum per student per year if
the ASSU provided the tuition; $655
if the administration provides the
tuition, Coate said. Since the ad
ministration has offered to match
any tuition given by the ASSU, up
to five, it would cost the ASSU
$1,810 for two students for one year.
Coate emphasized that all the esti
mates were the maximum figures,
and probably the costs would be
less.

Gene Mitguard. student manager,
listed the estimated balance of AS
SU funds in June at $13,027.80. Mit
guard stated that the ASSU had al
ready made some commitments, as
the Tresidder Memorial and AS
SU's share in the Pajamarino dam
ages. which must come from this
balance. He also advised putting
some of the balance in a contingent
reserve.
Mitguard advised against appro
priating as large a sum as $9,050.
His view was upheld by ASSU
President Tom Martzloff.
Coate, speaking for the plan, said:
"What we do at Stanford really
doesn't mean much, but if other
student bodies take it up, the merit
of the plan is clearly seen. The
fraternities, for example, would
write their chapters throughout the
country about the plan."
Margy Powers, in opposition,
questioned whether it was more im
portant to educate Europeans than
to feed them. "Send food and books
at least this year and next." Miss
Powers advised. 'In this way you
would help not 10 or 11. but thou
sands. Give students a chance to
vote on an alternative plan."
Bill Fairer, one of the two stu
dents sent abroad bv the ASSU last

summer, emphasized that "it is more
important to get across the idea of
democracy." He outlined what oth
er universities were doing for for
eign countries, and stated how anx
ious many countries, particularly
Czechoslovakia, were to send stu
dents to the United States.
Phyl Sutherland, president of
Women's Conference, raised the
question whether Stanford students
would take the time to orient the
foreign students to American life.
"Would it be wise," Miss Sutherland
asked, "to bring foreign students,
who have suffered great hardships,
to a school of comparative luxury
and to a school where the majority
don't particularly care what hap
pens in Europe?"
Excoin mem&er Jose de Larios
boiled the arguments down to "the
value of ideas against food." He
said he believed that nothing could
surpass personal contacts.
SIRO has sent the University of
Nanles 37 packages of clothing and
$180 in CARE packages since au
tumn quarter .according to Molly
Shaw's report on SIRO activities.
Five hundred dollars for tuition;
garding the Italian university will
be published in tomorrow's Daily.

important to get across the idea of
democracy." He outlined what oth
er universities were doing for for

ious many countries, particularly
Czechoslovakia, were to send stu

Phyl Sutherland, president of
Women's Conference, raised the
question whether Stanford students
would take the time to orient the
foreign students to American life.
"Would it be wise," Miss Sutherland
asked, "to bring foreign students,
who have suffered great hardships,
to a school of comparative luxury
and to a school where the majority
don't particularly care what hap
pens in Europe?"
Excoin mem&er Jose de Larios
boiled the arguments down to "the
value of ideas against food." He
said he believed that nothing could
surpass personal contacts.
SIRO has sent the University of
Nanles 37 packages of clothing and
$180 in CARE packages since au
tumn quarter .according to Molly
Shaw's report on SIRO activities.
Five hundred dollars for tuition;
garding the Italian university will
be published in tomorrow's Daily.
By a vote of 11 to 2, Excom last
night approved the authorization of
a maximum of $9,050 for foreign
scholarships pending a vote by the
entire student body next quarter on
the proposal.
A petition requiring the scholar
ship plan be put up before the en
tire student body for final approval
was presented to Excom. An election
will therefore be called within the
first four weeks of spring quarter.
Bob Coate, chairman of the for
eign scholarship committee, said
the maximum expenses of a foreign
student for one year would be:
A full survey of SIRO activities re
s4oo for transportation (round trip);
$50 for books; $20 for spending
money; and $25 for vacation money,
if necessary.
It would therefore cost $1,155
maximum per student per year if
the ASSU provided the tuition; $655
if the administration provides the
tuition, Coate said. Since the ad
ministration has offered to match
any tuition given by the ASSU, up
to five, it would cost the ASSU
$1,810 for two students for one year.
Coate emphasized that all the esti
mates were the maximum figures,
and probably the costs would be
less.

Gene Mitguard. student manager,
listed the estimated balance of AS
SU funds in June at $13,027.80. Mit
guard stated that the ASSU had al
ready made some commitments, as
the Tresidder Memorial and AS
SU's share in the Pajamarino dam
ages. which must come from this
balance. He also advised putting
some of the balance in a contingent
reserve.
Mitguard advised against appro
priating as large a sum as $9,050.
His view was upheld by ASSU
President Tom Martzloff.
Coate, speaking for the plan, said:
"What we do at Stanford really
doesn't mean much, but if other
student bodies take it up, the merit
of the plan is clearly seen. The
fraternities, for example, would
write their chapters throughout the
country about the plan."
Margy Powers, in opposition,
questioned whether it was more im
portant to educate Europeans than
to feed them. "Send food and books
at least this year and next." Miss
Powers advised. 'In this way you
would help not 10 or 11. but thou
sands. Give students a chance to
vote on an alternative plan."
Bill Fairer, one of the two stu
