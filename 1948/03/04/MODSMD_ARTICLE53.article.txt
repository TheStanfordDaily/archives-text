## Why Call a Rally? 
### 
Rally Com has had its turn in the gripe column this quarter.
A usual complaint is "Why no rallies for the basketball
team?" Some students suppose the team is being ignored in the
way of rallies because of its cellar position. They contend that
Rally Com would be only too happy to sponsor rallies were the
team in the win column more often.
From the experience of last year, we believe Rally Com has
made the wisest choice in not sponsoring rallies. Last winter's
rallies were poorly attended and lacked the enthusiasm required
to put over a good rally.
Barbara Carter and Dave Heyler, co-chairmen of the commit
tee, had seriously considered plans for a rally for the Big Game
tomorrow night. The idea was abandoned for three reasons:
1. All tickets to the game were already sold out, so there was
no need of a rally to promote interest in the game.
2. Members of the basketball team had been consulted and
saw no reason for a rally.
3. An informal poll showed that few students thought a
rally necessary and few would attend if one were called outside
the Pavilion.
Why demand the attendance of the team at a rally that
would prove only a letdown if poorly attended by an unen
thusiastic student body?
We believe Stanford students will yell just as loud tomorrow
and Saturday nights without a rally. A rally is great for stirring
up spirit and interest for a football game and even for a bas
ketball game when the conditions are favorable. But why a rally
purely for the sake of a rally? P. N.
