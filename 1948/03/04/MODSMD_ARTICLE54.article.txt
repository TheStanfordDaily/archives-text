# CAMPUS OPINION
## Unapproachable Leaders 
### 
To the Editor:
The sophistic reasoning exemplified by the hero-author of the editorial
"Steam Blowers," is hardly up to the standard we have learned to expect
from The Daily. Why. in the first place, should the blame for the pec
cancy of Excom be placed on the o% r erburdened shoulders of the Village
Council that enabled our present student government to hold power?
Why at this late date in the school year, is there a need for Excom and
the Village Council to get acquainted?
Furthermore, the fact that only 15 ax grinders attended the Excom
meeting only tends to make my original point more clear. Namely, that
such tactics as Excom's hiding itself away from the electorate at the
dinner Wednesday evening at the Village, prove to us all that chey take
no interest in the wants and desires of the student body, especially the
Village residents. Why waste our time in approaching the obviously un
approachable? As long as so-called student leaders retain their present
aristocratic ideas, so Ions? will the students refuse to deal with them.
