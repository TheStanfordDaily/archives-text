# Chinese Constitution

To the Editor:
Yes. indeed. China has a beautiful new constitution which diey trot
out and proudly display to all visiting dignitaries. But, as to whether
this constitution is being instituted in the manner Mr Middlekauff would
have us believe, or whether it is being kept in the national archives
until the people have completed their period of tutelage, (and they've been
going to class for some 20 odd years, now), is something else.
Certainly General Marshall praised this document; so do the Chinese
Communists. There's just one difference: e.g., the people in the com
munist areas are benefiting NOW by the actual implementation of many
constitutional pledges, while their counterparts within the Kuomintang
sections are living under the complete domination of a secret police
state which has seen either the imprisonment or murder of the middle
of-the-roaders, or driven them into political exile from whence many
have chosen to actively align themselves with the communist forces in
China.
As for the recent national elections, it Mr. Middlekauff would take
the time to scan some of the various American Consulate Chinese Press
Reviews I'm sure he would iind ample evidence of just how unrepresent
ative of the enfranchised population they werk?. Something like 10 per
cent turned out for the "ceremonies" which were not unmarked by police
activities resulting in the destruction of non-conformist ballots and the
beating-up of such dissident citizens as had the integrity to vote for
their choice. Death threats also proved effective deterrents to others
•who had read the same constitution ar.d sought to avail themselves of
their new rights.
Wake up, Mr. Middlekauff!
