## Vacation Exodus 
### 
NEW YORK (UP) â€”Most people remember those
pre-war summers when they piled into the family
sedan loaded with luggage and fishing rods, drove all
day and maybe an hour or so after dinner, and then
found a room waiting for them to spend the night.
It's about time to start thinking about this year's
vacation, but it might be well to think twice.
Tourist agencies and automobile clubs predict
there will be more people going places this summer
than ever before. The chief interest is in a "cheap"
vacation. Those who have the money to 101 l in lux
ury will find plenty of room.
But if you're just an average American vacation
ist, you had better reduce your estimate of how many
miles you can drive the car in one day, and figure
on stopping around 4 or 5 p.m. to look for a place
to spend the night.
Ihere will be 7.1MM1.000 more automobiles on
American highways this summer than during the
war. The total registration for 1939 was 30,379.450
vehicles. On Jan. 1. 1948. it had reached 37,164.450.
There'll be more people getting a new car for this
year's vacation than any year since the war.
The petroleum industry is wondering if it can
meet the vacation demand. Not only are there more
automobiles, but the consumption per car is up 300
gallons a year because the bulk of the nation's pri
vately-owned vehicles are pre-war models. The
industry also points to the competition for summer
fuel from farm tractors, now twice the number as
in the last year before the war.
