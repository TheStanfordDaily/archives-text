# Cosmic Ray Secret

TURIN, Italy (UP) —Four Italian physicists have
closed themselves in a cube-like laboratory atop
Mount Cervino in the Alps for a study of cosmic rays.
The squat building nestles on the rocky peak of
Testa Grigia at 12,000 feet above sea level. Geiger
meters, Wilson chambers and other strange instru
ments surround the four men. They keep in con
stant radio communication with their Rome head
quarters to report on their work, which is affiliated
with the United Nations.
When the new laboratory was established, state
officials and Italian and foreign scientists struggled
to hold their footing against a wicked wind screaming
across the highest peaks of the Alps.
Scores of cables held the laboratory to the moun
tain top and snow drifts had piled up around the
little building before the scientists entered. Officials
of the central physics institute said the men might
remain in the observation laboratory for two months
before their first experiments are concluded.
The answers to the fundamental problems of
modern physics are w hat these men seek. They may
be found in the cosmic rays, which constitute a sort
of mist-like rain falling upon the earth. The origin
of this "rain" of cosmic rays is not yet established,
but it is formed of the same particles found in the
atoms and nuclei of which matter is composed.
It has been found that the radiation—or at least
a good part of it—is absorbed in various measure by
the atmosphere. Hence at extreme heights, cosmic
ray particles of greater energy and in greater num
ber can be found. By studying such particles, the
scientists hope to reach the laws which govern the
formation of atomic nuclei.
Under the joint direction of Eduardo Arnaldi
and Gilberto Bernardini, the huge rectangular pre-

fabricated cabin, made with double wails of cork,
phaesite and aluminum, was set up on a cement
base under tremendous difficulties. All material
had to be brought up on sleds and 011 an improvised
funicular under the lashing of cold wind and the
first snows.
On stormy days the laboratory will be cut off
from the world. It is supplied with food and medical
equipment, sufficient to last for 15 days. On bad
days, only well-trained skiiers can reach the town of
Cervini lower down the granite peak. The four
Italian physicists who have begun their exile to
further the progress of science have no fear of
being cut off from all help in case of storms, however
—each is an excellent skier.

TURIN, Italy (UP) —Four Italian physicists have
closed themselves in a cube-like laboratory atop
Mount Cervino in the Alps for a study of cosmic rays.
The squat building nestles on the rocky peak of
Testa Grigia at 12,000 feet above sea level. Geiger
meters, Wilson chambers and other strange instru
ments surround the four men. They keep in con
stant radio communication with their Rome head
quarters to report on their work, which is affiliated
with the United Nations.
When the new laboratory was established, state
officials and Italian and foreign scientists struggled
to hold their footing against a wicked wind screaming
across the highest peaks of the Alps.
Scores of cables held the laboratory to the moun
tain top and snow drifts had piled up around the
little building before the scientists entered. Officials
of the central physics institute said the men might
remain in the observation laboratory for two months
before their first experiments are concluded.
The answers to the fundamental problems of
modern physics are w hat these men seek. They may
be found in the cosmic rays, which constitute a sort
of mist-like rain falling upon the earth. The origin
of this "rain" of cosmic rays is not yet established,
but it is formed of the same particles found in the
atoms and nuclei of which matter is composed.
It has been found that the radiation—or at least
a good part of it—is absorbed in various measure by
the atmosphere. Hence at extreme heights, cosmic
ray particles of greater energy and in greater num
ber can be found. By studying such particles, the
scientists hope to reach the laws which govern the
formation of atomic nuclei.
