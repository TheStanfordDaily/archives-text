## History 1948 
### 
In my estimation I believe that the greatest harm
was done to the liberal movement by those professed
anti-communists who indiscriminately accuse all
people with progressive ideas of being communists
It is always the same group of people who yell "com
munist" when some plan or idea does not agree wit!
their thoughts and theories.
The Hollywood probe for communists, however,
was an example of another type of foolish conflict
entered into by self-seeking publicists. The spending
ol thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money to wave
a finger at some alleged communistic Hollywood
writers and directors and crying "shame on you"
is a flagrant misuse of Congressional power.
The issue is not whether these men are commun
ists or not. Many are well known as followers of the

"red party line." It is simply ...
question of thought and speech,
as guaranteed under the Bill ot
Rights.
The influence of these so-called
"democracy haters" in molding
public opinion is negligible, ex
cept when they are turned intc
martyrs by ill-advised and plain
outright stupid investigation com
mittees. Hollywood has been, and
always will be well equipped to

take care of its own house cleaning, and they car.
accomplish it much better and more efficiently with
out the help of certain Congressmen—Mr. Thomas
and his spotlight-seekers in direct reference.
When the time comes when Congress or any part
of its membership shows any visible signs of at
tempting to refrain political parties from the right
of freedom of thought and speech, then these ver\
same Congressmen might as well repeal the Bill of
Rights, and everything else that spells freedom.
It is always around this time that certain Con
gressional men try desperately to get their faces ir.
the front pages of all newspapers. If they cannot get
publicity in a straight-forward method, they always
manage to find someone to pick on and pretend ti
be doing the American people a great service. Yes,
election year makes some leaders do some very
strange things for the '"good of the people."
In case any members of Congress, especially those
of Mr. Thomas' committee, happen to read this
article and decide that I am a ''red-apologist," please
try to broaden your minds and listen to this: M\
article in no possible way in which you could ever
construe it "stands up" for communist activities. Thv
issue is that of freedom of thought and speech—a
freedom that no Congressmen can smear by yelling
communist.
