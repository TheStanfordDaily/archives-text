# ERLING FORLAND
## Bull Session 
### 
It isn't so very long since everyone was arguing
about whether or not women belonged in the home.
In fact, at one time friends were turned into enemies,
homes were broken, whole communities were divid
ed over this issue. However, you don't hear any
talk about it nowadays. If anyone should stop to
think about it at all, why he'd probably shrug it
off as a question that gradually died out over the
years, without bothering to wonder why it died out.
But, there was one old fellow in New Jersey who
never lost interest in the issue. He firmly believed
that women belong in the home, and told men so
whenever he got a chance —on the street, in bars,
in elevators, in trains, at work, etc. In fact, he even
got up on soap boxes and harangued to crowds on
Saturday nights. But, try as he might, he couldn't
get men interested.
One night after he'd been working at it many
years, he was quite blue and discouraged. He sat
down and wrote a long letter to his Congressman.
He explained to him why he believed women belong
ed in the home, ar.d how he had been crusading these
many long years —seemingly in vain. Men just sim
ply weren't interested anymore, he wrote. It was
a dead issue. Then he asked him why. why men
weren't interested in whether or not women stayed
at home. He then told his Congressman that he
figured that he. as a Congressman, would probably
know what was wrong, why men no longer cared.
Well, after he wrote the letter to his Congress
man he felt tired. The old fire was out of him at
last. Neighbors reported that they often saw him
sitting on park benches, staring into space. Then,
too, he walked slowly now. with his hands stuffed
into his pockets, and with bent head. But then, one
day he received a letter from his Congressman.
Immediately after that the spring returned to his
step, his head came up and set at a jaunty angle,
there was a jovial gleam in his eye. and he had a
careless smile on his lips. He had a ready word for
people he met on the street. Yes. there was a big

change in the old fellow. Decidedly for the better.
Well, after a while the story came out. And it
was a wondrous story that caught hold of the
imagination, and that his neighbors discussed tot
quite some time. It was this:
The letter from his Congressman explained that
he, too. at one time shared the old fellow's views.
In fact, he had often orated in Congress on why he
believed women belonged in the home. The hallowed
halls had rung with his eloquence many times. Tht>
other Congressment were apathetic, but got quite
tired of it over the years, and to shut him up. in
desperation had voted him chairman of a Congres
sional investiagtion to find out why men had let
die the issue of whether or not women belonged
in the home.
Well, the Congressman eagerly ferreted after the
truth. He tracked down many leads, but they all
turned out to be false. Still, he worked and searched
after the truth. After he'd spent many years in hi
quest and was beginning to lose the old enthusiasm,
it came to him one night as he lay in bed. It was a'.',
tied up with Stanford!
For. just about the time the issue was raging at
its hottest, Stanford was founded. The new seho j1
received a lot of publicity, particularly after it ad
mitted women. The American public gradually found
out what a Stanford Woman was. And, fear struck
into the heart of the American male. Men every
where thought to themselves. "By God! I wouldn't
want one of those Stanford Women in my home!'
And quickly, oh so quickly, they stopped
that women belonged in the home.
Well, when the old fellow read that his heart
missed a couple of beats. For, think of the harm he
might have done if men had listened to him! But
then he brightened up, for nobody had listened to
him, any'/ray.
And, that's why his step is jaunty and he has a
pleasant word for everyone. For, HIS home, at any
rate, is free of Stanford Women.

after the truth. After he'd spent many years in hi
quest and was beginning to lose the old enthusiasm,
it came to him one night as he lay in bed. It was a'.',
tied up with Stanford!
For. just about the time the issue was raging at
its hottest, Stanford was founded. The new seho j1
received a lot of publicity, particularly after it ad
mitted women. The American public gradually found
out what a Stanford Woman was. And, fear struck
into the heart of the American male. Men every
where thought to themselves. "By God! I wouldn't
want one of those Stanford Women in my home!'
And quickly, oh so quickly, they stopped
that women belonged in the home.
Well, when the old fellow read that his heart
missed a couple of beats. For, think of the harm he
might have done if men had listened to him! But
then he brightened up, for nobody had listened to
him, any'/ray.
And, that's why his step is jaunty and he has a
pleasant word for everyone. For, HIS home, at any
rate, is free of Stanford Women.
It isn't so very long since everyone was arguing
about whether or not women belonged in the home.
In fact, at one time friends were turned into enemies,
homes were broken, whole communities were divid
ed over this issue. However, you don't hear any
talk about it nowadays. If anyone should stop to
think about it at all, why he'd probably shrug it
off as a question that gradually died out over the
years, without bothering to wonder why it died out.
But, there was one old fellow in New Jersey who
never lost interest in the issue. He firmly believed
that women belong in the home, and told men so
whenever he got a chance —on the street, in bars,
in elevators, in trains, at work, etc. In fact, he even
got up on soap boxes and harangued to crowds on
Saturday nights. But, try as he might, he couldn't
get men interested.
One night after he'd been working at it many
years, he was quite blue and discouraged. He sat
down and wrote a long letter to his Congressman.
He explained to him why he believed women belong
ed in the home, ar.d how he had been crusading these
many long years —seemingly in vain. Men just sim
ply weren't interested anymore, he wrote. It was
a dead issue. Then he asked him why. why men
weren't interested in whether or not women stayed
at home. He then told his Congressman that he
figured that he. as a Congressman, would probably
know what was wrong, why men no longer cared.
Well, after he wrote the letter to his Congress
man he felt tired. The old fire was out of him at
last. Neighbors reported that they often saw him
sitting on park benches, staring into space. Then,
too, he walked slowly now. with his hands stuffed
into his pockets, and with bent head. But then, one
day he received a letter from his Congressman.
Immediately after that the spring returned to his
step, his head came up and set at a jaunty angle,
there was a jovial gleam in his eye. and he had a
careless smile on his lips. He had a ready word for
people he met on the street. Yes. there was a big

change in the old fellow. Decidedly for the better.
Well, after a while the story came out. And it
was a wondrous story that caught hold of the
imagination, and that his neighbors discussed tot
quite some time. It was this:
The letter from his Congressman explained that
he, too. at one time shared the old fellow's views.
In fact, he had often orated in Congress on why he
believed women belonged in the home. The hallowed
halls had rung with his eloquence many times. Tht>
other Congressment were apathetic, but got quite
tired of it over the years, and to shut him up. in
desperation had voted him chairman of a Congres
sional investiagtion to find out why men had let
die the issue of whether or not women belonged
in the home.
Well, the Congressman eagerly ferreted after the
truth. He tracked down many leads, but they all
turned out to be false. Still, he worked and searched
after the truth. After he'd spent many years in hi
quest and was beginning to lose the old enthusiasm,
it came to him one night as he lay in bed. It was a'.',
