# Negre Leader Talks Tuesday
## 
### 
Under the auspices of the Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, Dr. W. E.
B. Du Bois, America's foremost Ne
gro leader, will speak Tuesday night
on "The Fight for Equality and
Peace." His speech will take place
at 8 in the Palo Alto High School
Auditorium.
Admission to the talk will be 50
cents, and all proceeds will be
turned over to the research bureau
of the NAACP for use in its many
studies and investigations on Negro
conditions.
Dr. Du Bois, who has just passed
his 80th birthday, was born in Mas
sachusetts and at an early age
earned the Ph.D. at Harvard. He
has since taught in many leading
universities on such diversified sub
jects as sociology, Latin, history,
and Greek.
Probably the most outstanding of
his cultural achievements, however,
is his attainment of membership in
the exclusive National Institute of
Arts and Letters, which limits its
members to 250.
