# Underdog Indians Meet Bears Tonight
## Cards Hope To Break Cal Streak 
### JOHN HALL 
Win-starved and hungry for
Bear, Stanford gees after Cal s
unscarred championship quin
tet tonight at 8:30 in the Berk
eley Gym. A sell-out crowd wil!
be on hand to watch the fireworks
develop when the Golden Bears try
to maintain their 10-game win streak
over the Indians.
Tomorrow night the Cards come
home to the Pavilion to finish the
Cal series and close up the season.
Stanford is the only team that can
stop California from becoming the
first in Southern Division history to
make a clean-sweep of its 12 game
schedule.
Led by Captain Babe Higgins at
forward, the Indians are determines
to erase the Bear jinx that has beer
bothering them since '43. Higgin>
who has been the only Card to
in every game, will team up with
either Morley Thompson or Bii
Rose at the other forward spot. Mil*
Iverson also figures to see actio: -
here.
Bill Stephenson, who scored 34
points in the first two Cal games
will be at center, and Dave David
son and Bob Lewis will handle the
guard assignments.
Davidson's presence in the start
ing lineup tonight might give the
Indians the spark that was lacking
in the earlier meetings. Dave missed
those games because of the flu. Hii
backboard work and aggressive style
of play will come in handy when the
going gets tough.
Higgins and Lewis will bring t
a climax their college basketball
careei-s this weekend, as will Bob
Penn, veteran eager who has played
the pivot spot behind Stephenson this
season.
California is favored to win -?asily
from the last-place Stanfords, but
the varsity is set to surprise. ;-nd if
working smoothly, Everett Dean's
men could make it plenty tough on
Nibs Price's highriding Bears.
Berkeley's excuse for the gold
dust twins. Andy Wolfe and Chuck
Hanger, will handle most of Cal's
offensive power, as they both go
after new highs in scoring records.
rVolfe will be working on his lirst
place position among Cal's all-time
scoring greats, and Hanger will be
busy adding points to his conference
total of .145.
Spidery George Walker at for
ward, Jim Smith at center, and Dee
Keaton at guard will round out the
Bear starting iive. Earl Strader,
George Cuneo, and Ray Lucas will
also offer strength for th" Berkeley
cause.
Stanford reserve strength will be
formed around tall George Yardley,
who was at his best in the first Bear
games. Yardley is excellent on the
boards and has lots of finesse under
the bucket. He might be moved from
forward to guard to spell Bob Lewis.
Gus Chavalas, a flashy ball-han
dling guard, should also be in the
thick of things. Other reserves are

Ralph Carver, Bill Drehobl, Jack
Scharfen, and Bill Lewis.
Stanford's record against Califor
nia earlier in the season was very
respectable, as the varsity dropped
close six-point and three-point ver
dicts to the Bears. Like several oth
er Stanford losses, those games might
have been listed in the Card win
column if the breaks had gone the
other way.
This weekend will be Stanford's
final chance, and Higgins, Thomp
son, Stephenson, Davidson, and Lew
is want to take advantage of it.


CAPTAIN BABE HIGGINS will
he playing his last collegiate
games this weekend against Cali
fornia. Bahe has heen the most
consistent ball player on the In
dian team this season. He is a
candidate for All-Coast honors.

Stanford's record against Califor
nia earlier in the season was very
respectable, as the varsity dropped
close six-point and three-point ver
dicts to the Bears. Like several oth
er Stanford losses, those games might
have been listed in the Card win
column if the breaks had gone the
other way.
This weekend will be Stanford's
final chance, and Higgins, Thomp
son, Stephenson, Davidson, and Lew
is want to take advantage of it.


CAPTAIN BABE HIGGINS will
he playing his last collegiate
games this weekend against Cali
fornia. Bahe has heen the most
consistent ball player on the In
dian team this season. He is a
candidate for All-Coast honors.
Win-starved and hungry for
Bear, Stanford gees after Cal s
unscarred championship quin
tet tonight at 8:30 in the Berk
eley Gym. A sell-out crowd wil!
be on hand to watch the fireworks
develop when the Golden Bears try
to maintain their 10-game win streak
over the Indians.
Tomorrow night the Cards come
home to the Pavilion to finish the
Cal series and close up the season.
Stanford is the only team that can
stop California from becoming the
first in Southern Division history to
make a clean-sweep of its 12 game
schedule.
Led by Captain Babe Higgins at
forward, the Indians are determines
to erase the Bear jinx that has beer
bothering them since '43. Higgin>
who has been the only Card to
in every game, will team up with
either Morley Thompson or Bii
Rose at the other forward spot. Mil*
Iverson also figures to see actio: -
here.
Bill Stephenson, who scored 34
points in the first two Cal games
will be at center, and Dave David
son and Bob Lewis will handle the
guard assignments.
Davidson's presence in the start
ing lineup tonight might give the
Indians the spark that was lacking
in the earlier meetings. Dave missed
those games because of the flu. Hii
backboard work and aggressive style
of play will come in handy when the
going gets tough.
Higgins and Lewis will bring t
a climax their college basketball
careei-s this weekend, as will Bob
Penn, veteran eager who has played
the pivot spot behind Stephenson this
season.
California is favored to win -?asily
from the last-place Stanfords, but
the varsity is set to surprise. ;-nd if
working smoothly, Everett Dean's
men could make it plenty tough on
Nibs Price's highriding Bears.
Berkeley's excuse for the gold
dust twins. Andy Wolfe and Chuck
Hanger, will handle most of Cal's
offensive power, as they both go
after new highs in scoring records.
rVolfe will be working on his lirst
place position among Cal's all-time
scoring greats, and Hanger will be
busy adding points to his conference
total of .145.
Spidery George Walker at for
ward, Jim Smith at center, and Dee
Keaton at guard will round out the
Bear starting iive. Earl Strader,
George Cuneo, and Ray Lucas will
also offer strength for th" Berkeley
cause.
Stanford reserve strength will be
formed around tall George Yardley,
who was at his best in the first Bear
games. Yardley is excellent on the
boards and has lots of finesse under
the bucket. He might be moved from
forward to guard to spell Bob Lewis.
Gus Chavalas, a flashy ball-han
dling guard, should also be in the
thick of things. Other reserves are

Ralph Carver, Bill Drehobl, Jack
Scharfen, and Bill Lewis.
