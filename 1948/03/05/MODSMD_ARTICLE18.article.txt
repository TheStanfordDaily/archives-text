# Chaparral Solves Tuition Problem
## 
### 
The March Chaparral will be the
biggest and best issue of the Chappie
since the February number. This
statement was made by the Old Boy,
who was found yesterday studying
for finals at a quiet retreat in the
hills between Stanford and Wood
side.
Not only do you get all the usual
features which you all know and
love so well, but in addition this
issue of the Chaparral will present
an idea for the better use of exist
ing University facilities to increase
Stanford's yearly income. "Might
possibly enable the University to
decrease tuition," said the Old Boy
with a sly wink.
Circulation Manager Steve Hyman
says that this great new Chappie
will go on sale Wednesday at the
English. Physics, and Engineering
Corners and at the Cellar.
