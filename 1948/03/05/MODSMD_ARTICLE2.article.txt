WASHINGTON, Mar. 4 (UP) â€”
! Sen. George VV. Malone (R., Nev.),
proposed today that the United
States announce publicly which
j areas of the world it will fight to
I defend, and then develop the mili-
I tary strength to defend them.
Malone made the suggestion dur
ng the fourth day of Senate debate
on the $5.300,000,000 European recov
j ery plan. He denounced the plan as
I a ''preposterous scheme for world
-1 wide distribution of wealth which
\ would tend to level our living stand
j ards down to that of Europe's."
Instead of ERP. he said the United
j States should extend the Monroe
Doctrine to all areas the state de
| partment considers vital to the se
j curitv of this country. This should
| be backed up. he said, by military
1 strength capable of "keeping any
! aggreasive-minded nation on the
1 ground within 48 hours."
