# Branner Hall 'For Men' to Remain In Hands of Farm Coeds Two Years
## 
### JAQUI ATKIN 
Contradicting the prevalent ru
mor that men will move into Bran
ner Hall soon. Assistant to the Pres
ident Thomas Spragens estimated
that women will keep the dorm
for at least two more years.
Spragens, known affectionately as
the "Space Czar," said the question
of Branner's reoccupancy by men
has not been discussed recently; in
fact, it is quite impossible for the
girls to live anywhere else under
the present stress of enrollment.
It is a Stanford rule that Stanford
women must either live on campus
or at home. Furthermore, women
constantly are commuting from
points as far away as Burlingame

and San Jose. Therefore, it would
| be a physical impossibility to allow
, the men to have Branner back, he
declared.
Dean of Students Lawrence
Kimpton, a former Branner resi
dent, observed that because Stan
; ford was built to accommodate 4.500
students, and 8,200 are enrolled now,
j the present housing problem is se
rious. He sees no possibility of
: Branner returning to the men until
the Village is abandoned, which will
not be for an estimated two years.
Stanford's population boom re
sulted from the veteran influx. Al
j though this year's influx comprises
i only 12 per cent of the new class in
j comparison with 50 per cent last
year, the number of incoming men
: still far exceeds that of entering
women.
j While Branner is a men's resi-
I dence on the men's side of the cam
â€¢ pus, the women have lived in it
; since the fall of 1944. After it was
i built men occupied it, but the kitch
j en and dining room were unused
| except for dances.
After the uniformed men of the
Army Specialized Training Program
lived there during the war, ''feel
ing ran rather high." declared Miss
Anastasia Doyle, associate counselor
for women. It was announced that
Branner would be used for a wom
en s residence so that more women
could be accommodated because
men could live in the Village.
Apparently Bianner benefited by
! the change. At first the girls were
not too contented living in an ex
men's dorm, but now the general
feeling is one of satisfaction.
Innovation* are the red drapes,
the initiation of a front door and
doorbell, glass brick in the corridor
between the dining room and the
' main part of the building, laundries,
! and the swinging doors that lead
I to the bedroom corridors.
