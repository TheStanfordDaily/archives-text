The objective tests are special apti
tude, vocational, and personality.
Director Barahal emphasized that
the counselors are not crystal gazers
nor are the tests absolutely indica
tive of the subject's vocational ten
dencies. Nevertheless, the results
help give the veteran a clearer pic
ture of his abilities, interests and
prsonality traits so that he can make
a more intellegent choice of his vo
cational objective.
Eighteen hundred veterans have
taken advantage of the service since
it was established in September, 1946.
These include veterans who have
chosen their future occupation but
who want confirmation of the advis
ability of their choice, students
who are not doing well scholastically
and are possibly in the wrong field,
lower division vets undecided about
a major, and veterans with personal
problems.
For the first time since it was
established on the Stanford campus
the Guidance Service is prepared to
care for any veteran almost imme
diately. Appointments for consulta
