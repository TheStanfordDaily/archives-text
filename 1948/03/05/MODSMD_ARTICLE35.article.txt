# Flashy Costumes Feature 'Cyrano'
## 
### 
Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano de
Bergerac," the Brian Hooker trans
lation, opened last night at Memo
rial Auditorium under the auspices
of the Stanford Players.
As a play it is pure theater, but
in the 51 years since its first pro
duction. it has been observed by
reviewers with increasing disrespect
as to its qualities as a dramatic
work. Brooks Atkinson describes the
title character as '"pure ham."
Granting this, it should be sliced
carefully and garnished well before
serving, for good ham is hard to
come by. This the Stanford Players
have done. The sets, are bigger, the
costumes are more colorful, and the
acting is grander than ever before.
Roy Poole, as Cyrano, gave a
forceful, sometimes touching per
formance of that "Punchinello fig
ure. He had a hard time capping
the climaxes of some of his earlier
scenes and once or twice he became
enmeshed in the masses of verbiage
which the play sports, but his hu
morous readings were unexception
able.
Priscilla Pointer played a charm
ingly brash Roxane. and Angus
Bowmer a most appealing Rague
neau. The Cadets of Gascogne de
serve a unite citation for camara
derie.
The play will be repeated tonight
and tomorrow.â€”Asher Williams
