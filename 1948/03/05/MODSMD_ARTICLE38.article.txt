# Jane, Campus Favorite, Expects Pups
## 
### DALE CHAMPION 
Jane is expecting. And Easter
Sunday is the day elected for the
auspicious event. The couple ap
proaching parenthood are Jane and
Max, Harelecjuin Great Danes.
Until recently, Jane attended
classes with her master, John
Stroud, a graduate psychology stu
dent. But now that she is 14 months
old and about to become a mother,
Stroud .figures she is a big enough
girl to stay at home. While attend
ing Stanford in her merry nine
months of puppyhood, Jane slum
bered through more than her share
of classes.
Jane's life has not been devoted
just to getting an education. In
keeping with a Stanford tradition,
she has been a great Sunday night
movie devotee.
Jane also has a mania for food.
She weighs 125 pounds and has an
epicurean appetite. In her youth
she expanded at the rate of half a
pound a day. Her daily ration of
horse meat is augmented by tidbits
of candy, bananas, ice cream, and
oranges.
The female pooch's worst crime is
pinching second - hand gum. She
once made daily pilgrimages to the

Union, where she found the under
sides of the furniture contained a
wealth of discarded gum.
Max, Jane's canine spouse, is the
property of Mrs. Gertrude Bancroft,
a history undergraduate. A famil
iar sight on Quad, Max is presently
in the throes of auditing Western j
[ Civ. While "getting educated, he can
compare notes with other campus
dogs; for Max can boast a record ;
equally impressive with 185 pounds
of canine flesh.
Max's war record is spiced with
' intrigue and deception. It includes
I service with three different armies.
Being German-bred, the Nazis were
quick to acquire his services, but
not for long.
The Russians, through a bit of
skullduggery, kidnaped him and !
placed Max in their K-9 Corps, and
still later, a detachment of Ameri
can engineers "acquired" him. They
in turn handed him over to his pres
ent owner, who was then serving
overseas as a WAC.
Max is bilingual: he understands
both German and English com
mands. The woofer excels at open
ing doors. Twice, though, in fol
lowing a natural instinct he has
got into trouble. Like any human

being, he has a strong yen for ob
taining a late - evening ice - box
snack. The 15 pounds of clog food
that he got during the first escapade
put him in the hospital for a week
with an acute case of the dog ver
sion of the bellyache.
Max regrets that he will not bo
able to be at Jane's side for the
blessed event. With finals out of
the way, he hopes to vacation in
Massachusetts.
