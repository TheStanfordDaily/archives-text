STANFORD CALIFORNIA
MORLEY THOMPSON forward CHUCK HANGER
It's a toss-up whether THOMPSON or ROSE will start at this spot, but Morley will
probably get the call. He is a point maker with lots ol hustle. HANGER is iop
league scorer. A demon on the boards, he rates as an all-time Cal great. Has
already been named as a possible ail-American.
EDGE: HANGER.
BABE HIGGINS forward GEORGE WALKER
HIGGINS is playing his last weekend of college basketball, and will be shooting
the works against Cal tonight. He is a steady player and rates as one ol the
three best men in the league. WALKER has made points in the clutch and made
UP's second all-conference team.
EDGE: HIGGINS
BILL STEPHENSON center JIM SMITH
STEVE is about ready to run wild. Held down for two weeks in a row. Bill should
start slinging in the points this weekend. He has the ability to be the best
center in the league. Always plays well against the Beais, having averaged 17
points against them in the first two games. Cal's SMITH is a nice guy.
EDGE. STEPHENSON.
808 LEWIS guard ANDY WOLFE
LEWIS gets starting nod because of his earlier performances against Chuck Hanger.
Is a good delensive man, but rarely dusts off his shooting aim. The Handy ANDY
with the smile on his face is outstanding player in loop. He is a come-through
artist from way back and loves to play under pressure. Is one of the most colorful
basketeers to ever play in Southern Division. He also holds the all-time Cal
scoring record.
EDGE: WOLFE.
DAVE DAVIDSON guard BUD KEATON
DAVIDSON is capable of swinging the game Stanford way. He missed the first
series because of the llu, and if he could find his scoring punch Cal will have
trouble. He should rate the edge, but the records don't figure that way. KEATON
will be dividing time with Strader and Lucas, all three being good men. Strader
is most aqqressive of the trio, and together they form a smooth combo.
EDGE: EVEN.
