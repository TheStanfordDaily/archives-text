## 
### 
Winners over the California Bear
Cubs in the first two games between
tlie two clubs, Stanford's freshman
basketball team will again meet the
Berkeley men this weekend in the
preliminary contests to the varsity
games.
Starting time for tlie Friday game
in Berkeley is 5:45. Saturday's tilt
is slated for (5:15 in Stanford's Pa
vilion.
For Card Coach Jack Dana it will
be his last appearance as frosh coach
and for the 1(5 yearlings on the
squad it will be the last games as
members of Stanford's freshman
basketball team.
EH WIT AND FOUR RECORD
Thus far this season the frosh
have won eight games and lost four,
two of the wins being over the Cal
yearlings. 41 to 39 and 35 to 30. But
Coach Dana points out that the
margin of victory in the first game
was but two field goals and one in
the second.
"If we win the game Friday we
will be doing very well, as it is on
the Bears' home court," commented
Dana. He went on to note that Cal
stars Gene Garfinkle and Bill Hag
ler made only 13 points between
them in the two games and that
both lads should do much better
than that in this series.
CAL FORWARD OUT
That Bill Wirth. stellar Cal for
ward, will be out of action due to
ineligibility offers some relief to the
Dana men, but 6-foot-5 Don Stow
has been moved to center and Hau
ler to worward. This, combined with
the offensive change that plays two
men in the pivot area, will give the
Cal men a decided height advan
tage.
For the Indian yearlings, Marvin
Gelber and Dick Clegg will start
from the guard positions with big
Bill Herron in the post spot. A duo
of Watsons, Fran and Paul, will
handle the forward chores.
Others slated to see action are
Jack Mc√üirney and Len Hughes,
who will be substituted in the for
ward wall, and Ken Gardner and
Hal Campen at guard and center
respectively.
Probable starting lineup:
STANFORD CAL
Wat-son. F. F llaglcr
Watson. P. F Smith
Herron C Stow
Clecg G Garlmklc
Gelber G Dodson
