## $9,000 Is a Lot of Jack 
### 
Spring quarter promises to be an exciting ten weeks politic
ally. Not only next year's ASSU officers will be elected, but the
much disputed foreign students scholarship program will be
brought before the student body at a general election.
Before the latter matter becomes too emotionalized with
pre-election arguing and campaigning, it is perhaps wise to
look at the basic issues involved in the plan. Briefly, there are
three chief problems to be solved:
1. How should this year's non-budgeted ASSU funds be
spent? Scholarships for foreign students is but one answer.
The money could also be used for direct relief through an exist
ing agency, for a student union or pavilion fund, for a profes
sorial choir, or for a number of other worthwhile projects.
2. If the money is spent on more than one of these projects,
how much should each get? Both the short and long range bene
fits of each proposal will have to be weighed against the others.
The contribution, not only to Stanford but to all peoples in gen
eral, of each project should be considered in reaching a conclu
sion. In other words, what is the best possible way in which we
can spend $9,000?
3. Should only this year's monetary surplus be used? If so,
SS,OOO for any one project is a large amount in comparison to the
anticipated 313,000 which will be left over in June. If excess
funds from other years are to be used, not only must the legality
of such use be determined but the amount of available money
will have to be decided.
No matter how you look at it, 59,000 is a lot of money. Every
one on campus will have a voice in determining how it is to be
spent at the referendum spring quarter.
