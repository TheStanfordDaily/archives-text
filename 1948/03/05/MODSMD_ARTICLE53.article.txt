## UN Faces Failure 
### 
To the Editor:
As a result of events of the past few days, the Ignited Nations, the
world's last hope for peace, faces failure.
The United Nations is being successfully defied by the Arabs. Our
government was largely responsible for UN s decision to partition Palestine,
but the State Department has taken no action to insist that the decision
be enforced.
"Because of the failure of the United States to adopt a consistent and
courageous policy on Palestine.' writes Sumner Welles, former Undersec
retary of State, "the United Nations is faced with the gravest dilemma in its
history. Once British forces withdraw, war will result unless the United
Nations can send an international constabulary to Palestine.
If the UN fails to enforce its own decisions, it will degenerate into a
futile debating society like the League of Nations became. We are facing
the same situation which confronted the world in 1932 when Japan defied
the League. The great powers did nothing and paved the way for the
League's failure and World War 11.
"The Palestine question is a test case," says Mr. Welles. "Should the
United States persist in its present blind inaction, it will be preparing the
way for failure of the new international organization And if the United
Nations fails, the one hope of force, for the freedom and progress of man
kind, and for the establishment of a peaceful world order will vanish
with it." ' â€¢
We suggest that readers of The Daily contact their representatives in
Washington urging enforcement of the LTN decision on Palestine. The
pressure of public opinion at this point can save the United Nations.
