$366 Per Veteran
WASHINGTON (UP) —Direct government ex
penditures for veterans' activities in the last fiscal
year were the equivalent of $366 per veteran, a study
of Veterans Administration records shows.
Excluding transfers of funds or expenditures
made from revolving funds, the government made
direct appropriation expenditures of $6,678,000,00(1
during the fiscal year ending last June .'5O for an esti
mated veteran population then of 18,237,000.
Each veteran did not receive anywhere near his
proportionate share, the records show. That is be
cause somewhat fewer than 7,000,000 of the 14,-
300.000 World War II veterans did not participate in
any type of veteran program or benefit under the
veterans' administration.
Others receiving up to $500 a year for tuition
in educational institutions and at the same time
received up to $90 a month for living allowances.
Still hundreds of thousands of others were drawing
$20 a week for up to 52 weeks for unemployment
compensation, and others required expensive hospi
talization and medical care.
Expenditures by states shows that the amount
spent per veteran was higher generally in southern
states and some northeastern and western states
than in the middle west and northern states.
All of the middle western states had a higher
percentage of veteran population than the veterans
in those states received proportionately from the
federal government.
