Dear Sister in Christ!
With heartfelt thanks and great pleasure, I ac
knowledge the receipt of a CARE package and three
clothing packages which you had sent to me. T>
such great love as you have shown. I want to say,
"May God regard you." In our present situation
this help is truly the help of God.
The Winter is now upon us with cold and snow.
Hunger and cold is the fate now of millions.
A few days ago, on my trip, I found 3 children,
of 12 to 14 years, who from the area of the greatest
starvation—the French zone—had walked 65 miles
to the American Zone to beg for fruit. It is quite
common for people to collapse every day from weak
ness. Our people now must travel a very dark road
Only one little light shines in the darkness, and
that is the fact that many find a new life—the life
with God. There were numerous young people wh >
became believers during the past summer.
Of the clothing, my two sons can use some very
well, and the other articles we have given to dis
placed persons and to those who lost everything
in the bombings, in our area.
We are very thankful for the great help from
America, also for the help the American Govern
ment gives to the most unfortunate cases here.
As far as politics are concerned, we hope that
the Conference in London will bring America and
Russia to some understanding, that will avert war
I have heard that Secretary of State Marshall is a
practicing Christian. We therefore shall pray for
him the more.
Now I shall close with heartfelt blessings for you
and everyone who has helped us.
Yours,
Herman Mann.
