## Wells Will Aid School Supply 
### 
Two wells will be sunk on campus
to help alleviate the water shortage.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, hopes they
will be finished by July 1.
The wells will be driven at the
golf course and near the Quad. The
one on the course will reach a
depth of 500 feet, and the other a
depth of 1,000 feet.
"At the moment," Blacker said,
"an effort is being made by the
University to conserve water by the
division of the campus into 11 zones,
six residential and five University
proper.
"The University zones are given
one day each for watering. Their
day lasts from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
residential zones are also given one
day a week, and their times have
been set from 4 to 7 p.m."
