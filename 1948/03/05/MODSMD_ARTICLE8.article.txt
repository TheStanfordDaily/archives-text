SACRAMENTO, Mar. 4 (UP)—
Emergency bills to establish daylight
saving time in California were
caught in a legislative jam today as
the state legislature recessed until
Monday.
The bills, which have been intro
duced in both houses to relieve north
state power shortages, were held up
by a dispute over how legislators
were going to decide what are emer
gency laws, the only ones that can
be passed at the present budget
session.
The Senate passed a resolution
setting up a screening committee
from both houses but it failed to
get to a vote in the lower house.
Opponents argued that each house
should decide what it will consider.
And Republican floor leader Ran
dal Dickey of Alameda admitted he
didn't have the necessary 41 votes
to get the measure passed.
He said a one-hour advance in
clocks would save about the amount
of electricity used by the city of
San Francisco.
