# Marshall Flies to Colombia
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 29 (UP)—
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall left by plane last night (9
p.m., EST) for the Inter-American
Conference at Bogota, Colombia,
where he will try to create a solid
Western Hemisphere front against
Russian expansion.
He heads the 90-tnember Amer
ican delegation which includes Sec
retary of Commerce W. Averefl Har
riman. The party is scheduled to
arrive in Bogota this afternoon.
The meeting, officially known as
the Ninth Internation Conference of
American States, will open tomor
row. It is the first of its type since
1938.
The conference will be primarily

interested in reorganization of the
Pan American system, economic aid
to Latin America, creation of a pact
for peaceful settlement of disputes,
and organization of a permanent
Inter-American Defense Council to
enforce the defense treaty signed at
Rio de Janeiro last September.
But Marshall's paramount interest
is in Europe where the "cold war"
with Russia will reach a climax this
month in Italy, and in the Middle
East where only six weeks remain
before the British pull out of Pales
tine.
Marshall is expected to seek sup
port on most of those issues for the
U. S. position in his private talks
with the foreign ministers of the
other American republics.
