# Experimental research results in better Vitamin D source for poultry industry
## 
### 
Fifteen years of work by Du Pont
chemists, biochemists, physicists,
and engineers behind develop
ment of "DELSTEROL"
In 1922, it was shown that vitamin D
controls the utilization of calcium and
phosphorus in the body, especially in
the bones of growing animals. This led
to the discovery that leg weakness in
chicks, poor production,low hatchability
of eggs, and other disturbances were
caused by a deficiency of this vitamin.

Scientists subsequently discovered
that vitamin T) could be made by irradi
ating plant or animal tissues with ultra
violet light. This reaction has since been
shown to consist of transforming cer
tain provitamins from the group known
as sterols, into vitamin D. The final re
sult of these discoveries was the present
large-scale commercial production of the
vitamin by a series of complex chemical
and photo-chemical reactions which re
quire careful control by chemists, bio
chemists, physicists, and engineers. In
this development. Du Pont scientists
played an important part.
Ergosterol onte the only source
For years before 1934 it was assumed
that ergosterol, a sterol first isolated
from vegetable sources, was tin' only
provitamin that yielded vitamin D. In

that year, Du Punt research men —who
had been studying the chemistry and
biochemistry of vitamin D for almost
four years—announced that the pro
vitamin in animal cholesterol was not
ergosterol. They showed that the acti
vated provitamin in cholesterol gave a
vitamin D much more effective for
chicks than that of irradiated ergos
terol. This fact was based on many
comparative assays of irradiated choles
terol, irradiated ergosterol, and irradi
ated mixtures of these substances on
rats and chicks.

Synthesis from Cholesterol developed
Other investigators showed that the
provitamin in cholesterol was 7-dehy
drocholesterol by developing its syn
thesis from cholesterol. The relationship
between cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholes
terol, and vitamin Dj is shown by the
following formulas:

Du Pont chemists and engineers car
ried this forward by devising a success
ful commercial process for making 7-de
hydrocholesterol and irradiating it to
vitamin 1).,. Several forms of vitamin D
are now manufactured by Du Pont,
ranging from oil and dry powder con
centrates —used by the poultry trade
under the trademark "Delsterol" — to
vitamin D 3 crystals of the highest
purity.
Today's chickens are healthier, and
the average annual egg yield over the
last eight years has increased from 134
to 159 per bird. To a considerable de
gree, this is a result of the fifteen years
of research devoted by Du Pont scien
tists to the development of "Delsterol"
"Deactivated animal sterol.

that vitamin T) could be made by irradi
ating plant or animal tissues with ultra
violet light. This reaction has since been
shown to consist of transforming cer
tain provitamins from the group known
as sterols, into vitamin D. The final re
sult of these discoveries was the present
large-scale commercial production of the
vitamin by a series of complex chemical
and photo-chemical reactions which re
quire careful control by chemists, bio
chemists, physicists, and engineers. In
this development. Du Pont scientists
played an important part.
Ergosterol onte the only source
For years before 1934 it was assumed
that ergosterol, a sterol first isolated
from vegetable sources, was tin' only
provitamin that yielded vitamin D. In

that year, Du Punt research men —who
had been studying the chemistry and
biochemistry of vitamin D for almost
four years—announced that the pro
vitamin in animal cholesterol was not
ergosterol. They showed that the acti
vated provitamin in cholesterol gave a
vitamin D much more effective for
chicks than that of irradiated ergos
terol. This fact was based on many
comparative assays of irradiated choles
terol, irradiated ergosterol, and irradi
ated mixtures of these substances on
rats and chicks.

Synthesis from Cholesterol developed
Other investigators showed that the
provitamin in cholesterol was 7-dehy
drocholesterol by developing its syn
thesis from cholesterol. The relationship
between cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholes
terol, and vitamin Dj is shown by the
following formulas:

Du Pont chemists and engineers car
ried this forward by devising a success
ful commercial process for making 7-de
hydrocholesterol and irradiating it to
vitamin 1).,. Several forms of vitamin D
are now manufactured by Du Pont,
ranging from oil and dry powder con
centrates —used by the poultry trade
under the trademark "Delsterol" — to
vitamin D 3 crystals of the highest
purity.
Today's chickens are healthier, and
the average annual egg yield over the
last eight years has increased from 134
to 159 per bird. To a considerable de
gree, this is a result of the fifteen years
of research devoted by Du Pont scien
tists to the development of "Delsterol"
"Deactivated animal sterol.

In 1922, it was shown that vitamin D
controls the utilization of calcium and
phosphorus in the body, especially in
the bones of growing animals. This led
to the discovery that leg weakness in
chicks, poor production,low hatchability
of eggs, and other disturbances were
caused by a deficiency of this vitamin.
