# FBI Agents Enter Coalfields To Investigate Lewis' Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 28 (UP).
â€”FBI agents have been ordered
into the coalfields, it was disclosed
today on the eve of a possible new
showdown between John L. Lewis
and the federal government.
The agents were sent into the
coalfields to see that no federal law
violations are involved in the two
weeks old soft coal strike.
While the FBI was officially si
lent, it was believed the agents might
also be building up evidence to
show that the work stoppage is a
strike under the Taft-Hartley Act.
Since Lewis has not officially called
a strike, such evidence might be
necessary to obtain an injunction to
halt the walkout.
The new showdown between
Lewis, head of the striking United

Mine Workers, and the administr. -
lion is set for 10 a.m. tomorrow
Lewis has been given until then t
say whether he will voluntarily ap
pear to tell President Truman's spe
| cial fact-finding board his side o
the pension dispute that has idlee
most mines since March 15.
Should Lewis refuse to appear or
his own accord, the board has made
clear it will subpena the mine chief-
I tain for its 2 p.m. public hearin,
i tomorrow. The order is enforceable
in the iederal courts. Failure to
obey a court order would subjec:
j Lewis to contempt proceedings,
punishable by fines and a jail sen
tence.
Lewis came off second best in
his last tangle with President Tru
[ man a year ago. Then he and his
union paid $710,000 in fines for fail
ure to obey a court order to call of:
a strike in November. 1946.
Now Mr. Truman is armed wit):
the tough Taft-Hartley Law, givinc
I him direct power to halt a strike by
injunction for 80 days if he consid
ers it a threat to the national wel
fare.
Lewis has hinted a legal figh
against all government efforts under
the Taft-Hartley Law. which h
calls a "slave law." He might thus
delay federal efforts to end tin
strike speedily.
Issuance of an injunction in th-.
I coal mine strike must await the re
i port of the fact-finding board. Th
i board hopes to conclude its public
hearings tomorrow with or withou:
! the testimony of Lewis.
