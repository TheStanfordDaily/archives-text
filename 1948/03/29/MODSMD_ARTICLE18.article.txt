### 
TEHRAN. Iran, March 28 (UP).—
Russia has protested anew against
United States military activities in
Iran and has denounced as "non
sense" reports of Russian troop ac
tivity on the Iranian frontier, it was
.nnounced today.
Russia said in a sharply worded
note that Iran's denial that Ameri
can army men were in dominant
positions was unconvincing.
At the same time the note said
reports of Russian interference in
Iran were "'an injurious fairy tale"
.nd "provocative fabrications."
Iran's course in the current ex
change of charges and denials, the
Russian note added, is "contrary to
.rood neighborly relations as pro
vided by the Iranian-Russian treaty
of Feb. " 26. 1921."
The Russian note was published
today in the bulletin of the Soviet
Embassy. Actually it was delivered
to Premier Mohammed Ilakimi
Wednesday but he did not read it
until last night because of the Ira
nian New Year holiday, it was made
known.
Russia protested Jan. 31 against
alleged American activities in Iran.
Iran rejected the protest and made
counter-charges of Russian inter
ference in Iran's affairs.
In the note made public today
Russia said:
I—Russia "does not consider con
vincing" Iran's statement that Amer
ican advisers in this country do not
hold key posts or have authority to
direct Iranian military affairs.
2—Russia "considers an injurious
fairy tale and rejects" Iran's state
ment that Russia has been active in
turbulent Azerbaijan province bor
dering on the Soviet Union.
3—Russia "rejects ... as entirely

without foundation" charges that
she lias improperly given refuge to
Iranian subjects who fled the coun
try. But Russia under her consti
tution gives refuge to persecuted
foreign political leaders.
4—Allegations that Russia has
permitted Iranian refugees to form
military units aimed against Iran
are "provocative fabrications."
s—''Statements about movements
of Soviet military units and maneu
vers on the Iranian frontier are
nonsense."
(J—'"The Iranian government's ef
forts to make out that the Soviet
note of Jan. 31 is an interference in
Iran's internal affairs must be con
sidered as an endeavor on the Ira
nian government's part to evade po
litical responsibility."
