## Life and Death 
### 
Yesterday was Easter. To Christians the essence of that day
is life. Easter symbolizes the victory of life in the ever-present
struggle between life and death.
This quarter is spring quarter. Here at Stanford life begins
again. The hills are covered with new grass, buds are breaking
out on the trees, the squirrels and birds are renewing their ac
tivity. At no other time of the year are we more aware that we
are immersed in a sea of living, breathing, growing creatures.
But we can't think of life without considering its mate —death.
Current talk at Washington, Moscow, London, Lake Success, has
an atmosphere of death surrounding it. Few persons want or
enjoy such an atmosphere. Perhaps when the hills have been
burned to a desert-like brown, that air will have cleared.
We can't do much on that score except watch and wait —and
hope.
Politicians talk only of potential death now. But there is actual
slow death —starvation —present today in many places. We can
do something there. Everyone will agree we should do some
thing. Just what to do is the question.
We'll be asked this quarter what kind and how many drops to
add to the bucket in the fight for life. The tragedies of both cur
rent and potential death will have to be weighed. What v/ill do
the most good—direct relief, scholarships, or half a dozen other
alternatives? What will sustain the most lives?
Think about it while the grass is green.
