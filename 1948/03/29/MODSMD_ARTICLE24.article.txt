# CAMPUS OPINION
## Political Maturity 
### 
To the Editor:
Having formed a PCA chapter at Stanford, we believe that the stu
dent body was mature enough to discuss and act on political matters.
Following PCA's rejection, 150 students signed a petition asking
Excom to reverse their "partisan political" stand. Under Article IX,
Section 1, of the ASSU Constitution, Excom had the choice of either
passing favorably on the petition or of allowing it to come to a vote.
Unfortunately, the Administration did not agree with PCA's confi
dence in the students' maturity. The petition was tabled and a part
of, the students' academic freedom was sacrificed to the Administration's
will.
Members must now meet with the Palo Alto PCA. We will continue
to work for political freedom at Stanford.
But political thought cannot be suppressed from above. Today there
is a movement on campus to organize a Students-for-Wallace group. All
who are interested should let their voices be heard.
