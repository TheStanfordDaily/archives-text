# The 						Quality of Instructors
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I want to congratulate and praise R. G. Hoffman concerning his very
well-written letter of March 3 in regard to the ability of instructors to
teach their respective courses. I, as do many others, agree with Mr.
Hoffman's views about value received from various elementary courses.
I happen to be in an elementary course where the instructor, as he is
called, has caused no end of bewilderment and disillusionment for the
majority of the class members. If there is a place where a person
shouldn't be utterly confused, it's in a beginning course.
Stanford is a school of high standards — and prices. The student body
should demand that high standards be met in the selection of their in
structors. For what we students are pouring into Stanford University
financially, we should be receiving more in quality of instructors and
learning than some of us have received in the past quarters.
