## On Quad

An important ingredient is passed over at many
of Stanford's all-campus and living group dances.
In most cases, though, the music is good, the re
freshments are tasty, and freindliness prevails among
the couples. Yet this missing ingredient knocks
most dances into the "only okay" class.

Maybe Charlie Moore, Toyon
vice president, hit the nail on the
head a few weeks ago when he
said poor distribution of entertain
ment makes most dances too
monotonous. Many couples prefer
variations during the evening in
"the way of bull sessions, refresh
ments, games and skits, and even
— forgive us — holding hands.
But the best diversion of all four
is a top notch entertainment bill
that holds audience attention and

that serves to break up that four hour stretch of
dancing into several shorter periods.
Last quarter several fraternity houses staged all
campus dances that might be better classed as
carnivals. Phi Kappa Sigma's "Over To Reno" free
for-all saw several hundred students crowd into
the house. The program's chairman, Tom Belknap,
said nearly everyone both danced and played games.
"During the party," he said, "the breakdown of
guests would be 50 per cent dancing, 30 per cent
'gambling,' and 20 per cent sitting around and re
laxing."
After the "Reno" dance, students praised the
house's program because there was so much ac
tivity that dancers never tired of the program.
Even at 1 a.m., when the gambling tables had to
close, students crowded around for more prizes.
Here was proof, then, that theme dances have more
attraction and spirit than non-theme dances and
ordinary open houses where only moderately-sized
crowds accumulate and where the midnight bells
sound the death knell to the occasions.
Meanwhile, a dozen houses and halls could pool
their resources each quarter for eight or 10 theme
dances similar to that of the Phi Kaps' "Over To
Reno." The cost would be under $150 — $80 for a
combo for four hours; $40 for refreshments; $20 for
decorations, and $10 for incidentals. Phi Kaps unani
mously voted for a $3 house assessment per man to
cover expenses. Their main preparation began two
weeks before the dance. On the day of the program
all men pitched in to set up the props. During the
evening's fun, 36 men took turns to pull 45-minute
shifts serving refreshments or managing gambling
tables. Dorms, such as Encina or Branner, can avoid
assessment by paying for party expenses out of their
social funds.
Theme dances are true entertainment only when
they permeate the entire program. Nearly all our
formal and semi-formal dances are "theme" programs
in name only. At 11 or 11:30 p.m. the dancers stop
for 30 minutes to politely guffaw at antics by local
cornmedians. After that the program returns to its
more "dignified" course.
Toyon Hall will alter this monotonous format in a
few weeks at the Toyon formal. The shenanigans
that occur then will cover two hours of the evening's
dancing — and this will be a formal, too. Farm
comedians should hit the jackpot for effectiveness that
night because they will have ample time to shower
their skits on the students. Entertainment will not
be confined to the time it takes the band to walk
around the block a couple of times.
I believe dances would come nearer to paying off
not only their backers but also their guests if a plan
lor effective distributive entertainment were insti
tuted during the entire dance. Ideas for dances could
include:
1. The Old Wild West — This theme would tie in

with California's gold rush centennial. Takeoffs could
copy bars, rodeos, gold mining and lynchings, and
audience participation would improve the theme.
2. World Conditions — Foreign conditions, customs
and products could be duplicated in skits and games.
Dancers could pay for everything in a cigarette
economy — smokes furnished by the house. The
Marshall Plan could be used to feed hungry couples.
Prizes might go to the best costumed couple. The
fellow with the best Stalin mustache might win a
bottle of vodka.
.">. Chaparral takeoffs — Nearly all of the Chappie
issue can be duplicated in games and acts during
dances. The March issue of Chappie's Improvement
edition is a good example for a dance theme.
The longest road in life is the one with no detours;
likewise, the longest dance of the quarter is the one
with few and poor entertainment diversions.
