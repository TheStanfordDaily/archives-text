3 lot or to Alaska
WASHINGTON, Mar. 29 — Interested in a vacation
motor trip to Alaska?
This will be the first summer, notes the National
Geographic Society, in which tourists may go rolling
up the Alaska Highway to Fairbanks as they please,
without red tape.
Addition of road patrols, service stations and
camp grounds with sheltered cook stoves and picnic
tables has enabled Canada to abandon the permit
system that was in force for the route last year.
Canadians now call this pioneer artery the North
west Highway. It is also known as the Alcan, the
Alaska-Canada, the International Highway, and"the
Road." It was constructed in seven months of 1942
to supply airfields on the war-urgent flying route
from the States to Alaska. Some 10,000 U. S. Army
Engineers and 6,000 U. S. and Canadian civilian work
ers laid it at the average rate of eight miles a day.
Southern end of the road is at the railhead vil
lage of Dawson Creek, 450 twisting miles northwest
of Edmonton, Alberta. The gravel roadway crosses
the Peace River farming plains, plunges through
long stretches of rugged forest land, crosses or
skirts four of Canada's chief mountain ranges, and
bridges 200 streams in its 1,220 Canadian and IJOO
Alaskan miles to Fairbanks.
Throughout the war, military transports kept the
highway's dust and gravel flying with joint defense
projects of the United States and Canada. In accord
ance with prior agreements, the Dominion Govern
ment in April, 1946, took control of the Canadian part
of the route along with airfields, telephone lines, and
other war-built facilities.
Since taking over, Royal Canadian Engineers with
civilian aid have kept their Northwest Highway
open the year around. Snowplows push away winter
snows as fast as they fall. Tourists were banned
throughout 1946, however, because service stops were
few.
Even in 1947, there were 100-mile stretches
without roadside service of any sort. But tourists
applying well in advance and carrying specified
extra gasoline, tools, parts, tires and food rations
could obtain permits to make the run. In July,
1947, about (>OO cars crossed the Alaskan border.
Scenery beggars description at many points. One
is where the highway skirts the shores of Kluane
Lake in the Canadian Yukon, close to the Alaska
border. Grades are gentle. Maximum altitude, near
Summit Lake in the Rockies, is only 4,212 feet.
Scenery — yes. But pleasure jaunters are
warned not to expect ideal motoring conditions.
Corduroy stretches, gravel and heavy dust can make
riding far,from pleasant, can play havoc with tires
and motors and cut down daily mileage average.
