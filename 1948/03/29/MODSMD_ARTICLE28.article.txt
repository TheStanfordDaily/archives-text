## Bull Session 
### 
Well, another quarter is beginning.
Spring quarter at that.
Boy, am I glad this is my last quarter at school.
I've barely time to finish my studies and get back
into uniform.
I didn't hear the President's speech of a couple of

weeks ago, but they say he was
tougher than a 65 cent filet mignon.
You scare 'em, Harry, while I
sew the Pfc. stripes back on my
uniform.
Then I'll show 'em the picture
they run with this column and
scare 'em while you put major's
leaves back on your uniform.
I'm not sure I can qualify for
the draft any more. After the
beating I took in last quarter's
finals I'm more than certain I'm
'4-F. Two in Poly Sci, one in Psych

and one in Journalism â€” totals 4-F.
Physically speaking I'm taking no chances. What
with the draft looming as a large possibility, I'm
encouraging an ingrown toenail.
Trouble is you can't always be sure of not pass
ing the physical. A friend of mine thought he would
dodge the draft in 1942 so he bought a truss and
claimed he was ruptured.
Trouble was he put the thing on upside down,
and when the board saw it they sent him to Egypt.
They figured a guy who can wear a truss upside
down could sure as hell ride a camel.
Not to change the subject, but I notice that reg
lines have still got people in them.
I figure this is a good healthy sign, 'cause when
reg lines quit having people in them, I'm going to

slop standing in them. And won't 1 be pleased.
Last quarter the lines were so long they went
clear back to the cellar.
1 bought a cup of coffee while standing in line.
Two hours later I had moved up to the sugar.
1 didn't get to put any in my cup though because
my name didn't begin with A-K.
There were lines all over campus that day. I
couldn't even get into the men's room because I
didn't have a seat card.
I don't think this draft scare has affected regis
tration procedure at all. If I ever look in the Time
Schedule and find that the "Literature of the En
lightenment and the Modern World" in the
Humanities school has been replaced by "Principle:;
of Counter-Mortar Fire" for 5 units, then I'm
woried.
My friend Herman Schmiddling is not around
any more. He got caught violating the Honor Code.
During a final exam in Russian he sneezed and they
threw him out of school for conjugating a verb.
That's all right, Herrfian, the same thing hap
pened to a guy who got caught counting his ribs
in an anatomy final.
First prize for the question of questions in a
final must go to the professor (now famous) who
a^ked:
"If the difference between water and ice is the
price, and a hearty handshake will suffice, then how
old am I?"
As far as I know, only one student got the right
answer which was "44 years old."'
The student says the answer was easy because
he has a 22 year old brother who is half nuts.
I'm glad my brother didn't have to take that
test. I'm 23 years old and 46 is" the wrong answer.
