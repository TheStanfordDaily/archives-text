Forty-five Stanford skiers were
among the group rescued yesterday
after a snowslide in a Utah canyon
had marooned them there since the
middle of last week.
The students returned to their
colleges reluctantly, for they spent
the isolation at a mountain l-esort
skiing, dancing, and enjoying ample
food.
