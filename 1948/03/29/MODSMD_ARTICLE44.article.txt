# Indian Nine Splits Pair With UCLA Baseball Team
## 
### 
Their pennant hopes sadly jolted by the upstart UCLA Bruins, Stan
ford's "once-beaten" baseball team returned to the Farm yesterday after
splitting a pair of games over the weekend. The games were the first
for the powerful Indians in California Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion play.
Friday afternoon the Bruins came up with a four-run eighth inning

to break the undefeated 8-win skein
of (he Indians, 7 to 4. The Farm
nine roared back Saturday to si
lence the Westwood branch, 5 to 1.
TROY AND CAL LEAD
Meanwhile, USC and California
have stepped to the front in the
CIBA race with identical records of
one win and no losses. The In
dians will get a crack at the defend
ing champion Bears on Saturday in
a crucial clash at Berkeley.
Last Friday's sad awakening for
the Cardinals came in a riotous
eighth-inning splurge by the Bruins
that broke a 3-all deadlock. Frank
Munoz of UCLA came up with the
bases loaded and supplied the win
ning punch, a prodigious triple to
clear the bases. The blow came
off Dick Flatland. who had relieved
Dave Stott in the fifth inning.
BIG FIRST INNING
Brightest moment for the Farm
nine came in the first inning, when
they scored three runs on three
walks and two hits. But from then
on, Bruin pitcher Johnny Stanich
shut the door in the face of the
Indians.
Stanford's final run came in the
ninth inning off relief pitcher Bob
Andrews, but the rally died right
there. The Indians only collected
five hits, against nine blows by the
Bruins. Both teams contributed
three bobbles to the carnage.
LEFTY STOPS BRUINS
On Saturday, the Indians did a
complete about -face and handed the
Bruins a 5 to 1 spanking, behind the
steady pitching of left-hander Dave
Dahle. UCLA could only garner
four hits as Dahle went the dis
tance for the victory.
Again the Indians stepped out
with a big first inning splurge, as
they chalked up all of their five
markers before the Bruins came to
bat. The Bruins finally entered the
scoring column in the fourth with

a single marker, but Dahle had the
game under control by then.
NAVA LEADS INDIANS
Eight hits off three Bruin hurlers
were manufactured by the Indians,
who tossed in two errors against
one bobble by UCLA. Bob Nava
led the Tribe with three singles, to
share the spotlight with Dahle.
Meanwhile, California's Bears were
administering a 25 to 7 shellacking
to St. Mary's in the league opener
at Berkeley. The Gaels already
boast a one-run decision over Santa
Clara, 3 to 2.
COP GAME TOMORROW
Tomorrow, Stanford travels to
Stockton to play a practice game
with COP's Tigers. Then the Farm
diamond men will concentrate on
upsetting the Berkeley Bears on

COP GAME TOMORROW
Tomorrow, Stanford travels to
Stockton to play a practice game
with COP's Tigers. Then the Farm
diamond men will concentrate on
upsetting the Berkeley Bears on
Saturday.
Their pennant hopes sadly jolted by the upstart UCLA Bruins, Stan
ford's "once-beaten" baseball team returned to the Farm yesterday after
splitting a pair of games over the weekend. The games were the first
for the powerful Indians in California Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion play.
Friday afternoon the Bruins came up with a four-run eighth inning

to break the undefeated 8-win skein
of (he Indians, 7 to 4. The Farm
nine roared back Saturday to si
lence the Westwood branch, 5 to 1.
TROY AND CAL LEAD
Meanwhile, USC and California
have stepped to the front in the
CIBA race with identical records of
one win and no losses. The In
dians will get a crack at the defend
ing champion Bears on Saturday in
a crucial clash at Berkeley.
Last Friday's sad awakening for
the Cardinals came in a riotous
eighth-inning splurge by the Bruins
that broke a 3-all deadlock. Frank
Munoz of UCLA came up with the
bases loaded and supplied the win
ning punch, a prodigious triple to
clear the bases. The blow came
off Dick Flatland. who had relieved
Dave Stott in the fifth inning.
BIG FIRST INNING
Brightest moment for the Farm
nine came in the first inning, when
they scored three runs on three
walks and two hits. But from then
on, Bruin pitcher Johnny Stanich
shut the door in the face of the
Indians.
Stanford's final run came in the
ninth inning off relief pitcher Bob
Andrews, but the rally died right
there. The Indians only collected
five hits, against nine blows by the
Bruins. Both teams contributed
three bobbles to the carnage.
LEFTY STOPS BRUINS
On Saturday, the Indians did a
complete about -face and handed the
Bruins a 5 to 1 spanking, behind the
steady pitching of left-hander Dave
Dahle. UCLA could only garner
four hits as Dahle went the dis
tance for the victory.
Again the Indians stepped out
with a big first inning splurge, as
they chalked up all of their five
markers before the Bruins came to
bat. The Bruins finally entered the
scoring column in the fourth with

a single marker, but Dahle had the
game under control by then.
NAVA LEADS INDIANS
Eight hits off three Bruin hurlers
were manufactured by the Indians,
who tossed in two errors against
one bobble by UCLA. Bob Nava
led the Tribe with three singles, to
share the spotlight with Dahle.
