under the code. The letter states in
part:
"When each student enters the

University he pledges to uphold the
Honor Code, stating that he will not
give nor receive unpermitted aid in
any work to be used as a basis for
grading, and that he will share in
the responsibility for seeing that
others adhere to the code.
"An important responsibility of
the instructor in the functioning of
the Honor Code is explaining spe
cifically to his class just what is
considered permitted aid and what
is unpermitted aid in the work of
each course in regard to examina
tions, outside papers and reports,
laboratory and daily work; then
there can be no uncertainty in the
student's mind as to what might be
an Honor Code violation."
