# Lagunita Enters Mud Puddle Stage
## 
### 
Water appeared in Lake Lagunita
for the first time this year during
the vacation week. Lagunita still
appears more like an enlarged mud
puddle than a lake.
Water now in the lake has
trickled in from streams below
Searsville and Felt Lakes, for these
lakes do not yet have an overflow,
nor does an overflow appear likelv.
Blacker said that the state-wide
water conservation program and
Stanford's campus rationing set up
two months ago will continue.
