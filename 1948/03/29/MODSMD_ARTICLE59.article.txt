Ed Glass, Stanford's famed blind
veteran graduate, is returning spritv.;
quarter to study for his doctorate

Everything is arranged for his
continued education except a home,
Everett J. Phillips. VA training of
ficer, said. Any student or faculty
member who knows of a furnished
house or apartment is asked to call
Mrs. Jean Farran, Stanford housing'
officer, at 9411, extension 56.
Ed's is not the ordinary housing
problem. Not only must he have a
place for his wife, Louise, and baby.
Maureen, but for Ruff, his guide
dog. The big black Labrador re
triever is actually Ed's ability to .;et
aroundâ€”his eyes both on campus
and at home. The house must be
furnished.
