# Spring Quarter Registration Opens; Slight Drop in Enrollment Predicted
## 
### 
" Spring quarter will officially get under way today when the
doors of the Administration Building open for registration at
8 a.m.
Registration is expected to fall slightly short of the 8,000 mark,
according to the University Registrar. Winter quarter registra-

tion was 8,093.
Registration procedure will be ex
ecuted in the same fashion that it
was carried out in the winter. Each
section of the alphabet has been as
signed to a certain hour. Students
will save time for themselves by
not appearing before the appointed
time, said H. Donald Winbigler, reg
istrar.
NAMES LISTED
Names falling in the S to Z cate
gory will be taken first this quarter,
at 8 a.m., followed in order by the
following groups: A to D, 9 to 10
a.m.; E to K. 10 to 11 a.m.; and L to
R, 11 to 12 p.m. The registration
office will be open to all students
between 1 and 5 p.m.
Those who fail to register after
today will be subject to a late fee.
With the registration books, stu
dents will receive their pre-study
cards, any necessary seat cards, and
winter quarter grades. Books must
be called for in person.
Regular registration procedure
and veterans' procedure can be
found in both the reg books and the
time schedule. Most students will
have only four steps: obtaining
their reg books, making them out,
clearing with the cashier, and turn
ing in the books. Lower division
students must sign up for gym in
addition.

TURN-IN STATIONS
Turn-in stations will be located
in rooms close to the cashiers' j
booths. Books may be returned to
room 124, Graduate School of Busi
ness, or room '202, History Building, ;
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and to the j
Administration Building from 3 to
5:45 p.m.
Registrar Winbigler said that he j
expects the smoothest legistration j
ever accomplished. He guaranteed I
that students would be accommo
dated promptly if they come at the !
times indicated. He recommended ;
that all students who have incurred
administrative deficiencies, such as j
library fines and outstanding fees. !
clear them up immediately so that
their registration will not be de
layed.
The slight decline in the registra- :
tion figure is attributed to the fact {
that no new freshmen are admitted j
spring quarter and that approxi- â– 
mately 600 signified their intention
to leave school at the end of winter ;
quarter.
WINBIGLER PLEASED
Referring to the new pre-regis- J
tration system used .at the end of ;
last quarter, Mr. Winbigler said that
it achieved all that he hoped it !
would. He added that the new
method gave students a chance to
consult advisers in a more leisurely j
manner and to get seat cards j
promptly.
He said that his office expects to |
continue the pre-registration in this ;
manner, with minor improvements. J
Only a few students were unable j
to get the seat cards they desired. j
Music cards were used up Monday
morning, March 8, even after addi
tional sections were opened the pre
vious Saturday. Economics 1 and
80 were closed the following morn
ing and Political Science 1 was
closed Tuesday afternoon.
Other courses still have some
space available for new students
and students with a change of pro
gram. Mr. Winbigler called the seat
card situation the most favorable in
two years.
