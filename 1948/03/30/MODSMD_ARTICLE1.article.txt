### 
WASHINGTON, March 29 (UP) — Bernard M. Baruch today
urged fast action on the draft and universal military training,
backed by a "total preparedness" plan for instant mobilization
of manpower and industrial and economic resources if war
comes.

The elderly financier and
Senate Armed Services Committee
that to deal effectively with Russia
the United States must be strong
and ready.
"If we are to be prepared, it must
be on all fronts," he said.
"What 1 want to see is action and
not waiting for an event to happen.
SELECTIVE SERVICE
The first step in that program of
"action," he said, is immediate re
enactment of the selective service
law, followed by passage of uni
versal military training and a pro
gram for the rehabilitation of all
youths with physical or mental de
fects.
He recommended that those "par
tial mobilization" measures be ac
companied now by a "total plan for
industrial and economic mobilization
so that universal training rests upon
a solidly grounded pyramid of total
preparedness."
READY FOR WAR
That plan should be held in
readiness for instant execution by
presidential proclamation, with the
approval of Congress, on the out
break of war, he said.
His "ready-to-go" plan would in
clude industrial controls, wage,
price, and rent controls, stockpiling
of strategic materials, high taxes to
take the profit out ot war, a work
or - fight wartime draft, and other
measures to gear the nation over
night for total war.
"The same threats which justify
reenacting the draft and other
measures require the immediate
adoption of an economic mobiliza
tion plan which can be put into ef
fect without delay," he said.
