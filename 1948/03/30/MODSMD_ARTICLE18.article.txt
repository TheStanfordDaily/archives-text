# Atom Control Plan Strapped By UN Group
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., March 29
(UP). —The American-led majority
of the United Nations Atomic En
ergy Commission consigned Russia's
propsals for world atomic control to
the diplomatic scrap heap today.
Eight nations agreed with emphatic
finality that the Soviet plan could
not possibly work.
Russia replied that this brings the
UN "to a dead end" in its long and
acrimonious search for agreement
on global atomic control.
Thus the West and the East hard
ened their two-year stalemate and
ended—probably for many months
—any real attempt to settle the un
precedented problem of atomic con
trol.
The development appeared to
mean that the UN Atomic Energy
Commission, while it still must in
dulge in some more talking and
some 9 to 2 votes in the next few
weeks, has given up trying to ac
complish anything in the climate of
conflict which now enshrouds East-
West relations.
Great Britain, France. China, and
Canada cleared the way for the ma
jority's action in the 11 - nation
working committee of the Atomic
Commission today by proposing
formally that all Russia's atomic
proposals be scrapped.
