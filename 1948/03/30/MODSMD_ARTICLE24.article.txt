## A 						New Order 
### 
A time-honored tradition died at Stanford yesterday.
The Chappie lost an important source for its favorite stories
and students are without their pet gripe.
To stand in a reg line, pick up a book, and have it filled out
within 30 minutes was a new experience for undergraduates,
especially those who could remember the all-day orgies of
'45 and '46.
To be sure, few whipped through the lines, but the time and
frayed nerves that were spared were appreciated by most of
the student body.
The biggest bottleneck was caused by students who had
failed to pay last quarter's bills and had to be cleared by the
library or the cashier's office before receiving their reg books.
Mr. H. Donald Winbigler, registrar, said that today's regis
tration was carried out with greater ease than at any previous
time. "We know it isn't perfect yet," he remarked, "and we're
not going to stop trying to improve it."
Maybe it wasn't perfect, but as one student put it, "Someone's
really on the ball." a--*?*
That "someone on the ball" was Mr. Winbigler and his staff
to whom credit is due for the new effective procedure. Students
were free with verbal bouquets for the Administration yester
day.
Efficient reg lines and 8,000 students, spared a tiresome ordeal,
are a good beginning for a new quarter. —P. N.
