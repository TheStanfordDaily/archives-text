## Co-operation Takes Two 
### 
To the Editor:
To label the recent U. S. stand in the Palestine question as weak
kneed and to ponder over a suitable epitaph for the UN is the real
betrayal of the movement. The finger should not be pointed back at
the delegates, but should be directed toward the pessimists — for instance,
Mr. Brunn.
Mr. Brunn, do you really think our UN policies are in the hands
of totally incapable, unthinking men? And do you think that a Palestine
partition could be carried out without UN occupation elements, which
would be composed of mostly American and Russian forces' Russia
would welcome that occupation duty, Mr. Brunn, especially when it
could eventually lead to domination of the Mediterranean area.
Yet, you and your well-meaning "men of good will," so very liberal,
so very cooperative, and so gullible would give Russia legitimate reason
to have military forces in "a house divided against itself."
Cooperation between the U. S. and Russia is essential, but it takes
two to cooperate, and one of the parties can't operate behind closed doors.
Before you attempt to illustrate in later columns that cooperation and
distrust are antithetical, please be aware of the fact that the term does
not imply one nation playing into the hands of the other.
One World, Mr. Brunn? Certainly. But not one Hag.
