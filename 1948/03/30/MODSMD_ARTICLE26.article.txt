# An Affirmative Vote

### 
To the Editor:
Since I will not be in school spring quarter, I would like to cast my
vote or suggestion for the constructive use of the ASSU's $9,000.
I think it would support at least nine foreign students at Stanford for
one academic year. It could be worked in with Bob Coate's plan of
the fraternities' supplying the room and board and the rest of us supply
ing the other expenses.
The adoption of the University of Naples and sending students to
Europe were very creative steps, and now we need to bring students to
this country and demonstrate that we do have a way of life that is con
sistent, unselfish and non-hypocritical.
Whatever we do with the money, let's discuss its use on the basis of
' Where will it do the most good for others?" and not "Where will it
reap the greatest benefits?"
HAL SECREST.
