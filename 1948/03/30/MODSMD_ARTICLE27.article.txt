To the Editor:
One morning last April, a small article appeared in The Daily an
nouncing the offer of 12 scholarships in municipal affairs by the Coro
Foundation of San Francisco. I was fortunate enough to apply and be
accepted for a nine month course. During the past six months, I have
gained a practical experience which it would bo impossible to duplicate
in any other way. I could not recommend this program too highly.
Because I remember how little was known about the Foundation last
year, I thought I might take this method of passing the word along
that the Foundation will soon be taking applications for the course
beginning in September. I would advise any student who might be
interested to contact the Political Science Department or write directly
to the Coro Foundation, 821 Market Street, San Francisco.
