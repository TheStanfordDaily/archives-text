LONDON (UP) — The Labor government has
brought almost 40,000 communist-hating Eastern
European refugees to Britain in the last 10 months
to help in this country's desperate struggle for sur
vival and recovery.
Altogether, 1(10.000 will be brought here from
displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria.
They may provide the margin between success and
failure in Britain's "feed ourselves" and "export
or die" production programs.
Most have come from the Ukraine, from the for
mer Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,
and from the former Polish Ukraine. They were
caught in their homelands by the German invasions
of 1939 and 1941. Some were taken to Germany as
"slave labor." The others fled before the advancing
Red Army rather than come under communist rule.
There were peasants, doctors, machinists, teach
ers, students, and clerks — a cross-section of the
population of Eastern Europe united mainly in
their despair and hate of both communism and
Nazism.
Britain, starved for manpower, offered them a
chance to start life anew with announcement of its
"Westward Ho!" scheme for displaced persons phys
ically fit between 18 and 50 who were willing to
enter essential work.
The first batches of refugees arrived by ship
from Germany in April, 1947, and still are flowing
into this country at a rate of 1.000 a week. By
mid-January, .'{7,512 had arrived — 27,(>(>8 men
and 9.844 women. Of those, 311,944 — 24,439 men
and 9,505 women — had been placed in jobs.
Agriculture alone swallowed up 15,000 refugees,
known here as European volunteer workers. The
seriously undermanned textile industry absorbed
7,100 others, domestic work in hospitals and other
institutions, 5,800, and coal mines, 3,700.
The remainder went into (he iron and steel
industry, nursing, laundries, brick factories, and
timber cutting.
They receive the same wages, draw the same ra
tions, make the same unemployment and health in
surance contributions, and pay the same taxes as
other British workers. They are given a choice of
essential jobs and may shift to other essential work if
not satisfied with the first choice.
Ultimately, they are expected to be given an op
portunity lo become British citizens.
New arrivals are taken to hospitals operated by
the government in former U. S. Army or Royal Air
Force camps. There, meals, laundry facilities, and
recreation rooms are provided.
Because of lack of sufficient accommodation, the
government appealed to householders in the dis
tricts where the European workers were assigned
to take them into their homes as roomers.
For the first week or two, the appeals fell on deaf
ears. Then, as the British became better acquainted
with their new workmates, their traditional reserve
began to melt. Soon, families which refused even to
lake fellow British or Irish workers into their homes
were receiving the refugees.
The language barrier rapidly is being overcome.
Many of the Baltic refugees already spoke Eng
lish and others are learning quickly.
Factory managers found the refugees eager to
learn and work. Some refugees, unaccustomed to
factory work, found it hard lo adjust themselves at
first, but patience by all concerned saw them over
the difficulties.
None of the refugees was permitted to bring
his dependents at first because of (lie housing
shortage, but that is being remedied. The first de
pendents were brought here in December and more
are coming at (lie rate of about 101) a week. It
will be many months before all families are re
united. however.

LONDON (UP) — The Labor government has
brought almost 40,000 communist-hating Eastern
European refugees to Britain in the last 10 months
to help in this country's desperate struggle for sur
vival and recovery.
Altogether, 1(10.000 will be brought here from
displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria.
They may provide the margin between success and
failure in Britain's "feed ourselves" and "export
or die" production programs.
Most have come from the Ukraine, from the for
mer Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,
and from the former Polish Ukraine. They were
caught in their homelands by the German invasions
of 1939 and 1941. Some were taken to Germany as
"slave labor." The others fled before the advancing
Red Army rather than come under communist rule.
There were peasants, doctors, machinists, teach
ers, students, and clerks — a cross-section of the
population of Eastern Europe united mainly in
their despair and hate of both communism and
Nazism.
Britain, starved for manpower, offered them a
chance to start life anew with announcement of its
"Westward Ho!" scheme for displaced persons phys
ically fit between 18 and 50 who were willing to
enter essential work.
The first batches of refugees arrived by ship
from Germany in April, 1947, and still are flowing
into this country at a rate of 1.000 a week. By
mid-January, .'{7,512 had arrived — 27,(>(>8 men
and 9.844 women. Of those, 311,944 — 24,439 men
and 9,505 women — had been placed in jobs.
Agriculture alone swallowed up 15,000 refugees,
known here as European volunteer workers. The
seriously undermanned textile industry absorbed
7,100 others, domestic work in hospitals and other
institutions, 5,800, and coal mines, 3,700.
The remainder went into (he iron and steel
industry, nursing, laundries, brick factories, and
timber cutting.
