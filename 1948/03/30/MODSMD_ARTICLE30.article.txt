## History 1948 
### 
Less than three years after the end of the last
war almost everybody is agreed that we are heading
for a new one. People today no longer ask whether
there will be another war; they only ask when it
will come. The country, as the world, is in the grip
of hopelessness.
Seen from the vantage point of traditional politics

the situation is quite hopeless. If
Soviet aggression is not stopped we
shall be engulfed by Stalinism. If
Iwe build a mighty military ma-
| chine we will sooner or later have
r to fight a war we cannot win, re-
Igardless who will be the victor
on paper. For the most optimistic
estimate, made by Einstein, says
one-third of our population may
survive an atomic war. To say
that the war may not be atomic is
to base your life expectancy on

wishful thinking.
If we drop atom bombs on Russia today wo could
probably defeat Stalin. But, as the San Francisco
Chronicle has pointed out, to keep the vast USSR
occupied it would be necessary to militarize our life
completely. In the process of defeating communism
we would have to give up every shred of democracy
we have.
Yet these are the only alternatives that our states
men know. It is little wonder then that the individual
shakes his head and finds no answer to his question
"what can I do?" In a world of vast industries,
giant governments, and mass armies, Joe Smith has
become pretty insignificant.
But since our statesmen have reached the end of
the road the only chance for peace is in the hands
of all the Joe Smiths and Mary Browns. It is true
that we can't get peace merely by hoping for it. It.
is even truer that we can't get it unless we hope
for it — and work for it. If we resign ourselves to
war we shall have war.
Since international diplomacy is failing once
again, our continued existence depends on finding
a new approach. There is one that has been often
suggested and is now being worked on by a con
siderable number of people.
It goes by many names. Some call it psychology,
some moral education. Some call it Christianity. By
whatever name it goes, it is based on the idea that
to have peace there must be a fundamental change
in the hearts and minds of men.
This sounds so dreamily idealistic that most people
just smile. "Don t you know that you can't change
human nature?" Perhaps you can't. Perhaps it is
only a dream. But we know today that politics
cannot provide a solution. There is at least a faint
chance that this new approach can. It has never
really been tried. If we believe in this faint chance
and work toward its realization perhaps we can
succeed.
Viewed with cold realism we have nothing to
lose. Against the certain doom of traditional states
manship we have the slight hope of the new approach
It costs us nothing to try. But we have everything
to gain.
Among those who are hewing out the new path
are "Students Concerned" on the Stanford campus.
There is also a group of churchmen and laymen,
led by the Brethren, who will travel to Washington
April If). They plan to have three weeks of dis
cussions with high ranking government leaders to
lay a foundation of action for peace.
The possibilities that they can change the minds of
Marshall, Truman, and their congressmen seem slim.
But they will represent thousands of Joe Smiths
and in this era of almost universal gloom it is
important that their voices be heard.
This "World Peace and Brotherhood Mission," led
by Paul Studebaker of the Modesto Church of the
Brethren is trying to save your skin. Give it your
support. This is something you can do.

of hopelessness.
Seen from the vantage point of traditional politics

the situation is quite hopeless. If
Soviet aggression is not stopped we
shall be engulfed by Stalinism. If
Iwe build a mighty military ma-
| chine we will sooner or later have
r to fight a war we cannot win, re-
Igardless who will be the victor
on paper. For the most optimistic
estimate, made by Einstein, says
one-third of our population may
survive an atomic war. To say
that the war may not be atomic is
to base your life expectancy on

wishful thinking.
If we drop atom bombs on Russia today wo could
probably defeat Stalin. But, as the San Francisco
Chronicle has pointed out, to keep the vast USSR
occupied it would be necessary to militarize our life
completely. In the process of defeating communism
we would have to give up every shred of democracy
we have.
Yet these are the only alternatives that our states
men know. It is little wonder then that the individual
shakes his head and finds no answer to his question
"what can I do?" In a world of vast industries,
giant governments, and mass armies, Joe Smith has
become pretty insignificant.
But since our statesmen have reached the end of
the road the only chance for peace is in the hands
of all the Joe Smiths and Mary Browns. It is true
that we can't get peace merely by hoping for it. It.
is even truer that we can't get it unless we hope
for it — and work for it. If we resign ourselves to
war we shall have war.
Since international diplomacy is failing once
again, our continued existence depends on finding
a new approach. There is one that has been often
suggested and is now being worked on by a con
siderable number of people.
It goes by many names. Some call it psychology,
some moral education. Some call it Christianity. By
whatever name it goes, it is based on the idea that
to have peace there must be a fundamental change
in the hearts and minds of men.
This sounds so dreamily idealistic that most people
just smile. "Don t you know that you can't change
human nature?" Perhaps you can't. Perhaps it is
only a dream. But we know today that politics
cannot provide a solution. There is at least a faint
chance that this new approach can. It has never
really been tried. If we believe in this faint chance
and work toward its realization perhaps we can
succeed.
Viewed with cold realism we have nothing to
lose. Against the certain doom of traditional states
manship we have the slight hope of the new approach
It costs us nothing to try. But we have everything
to gain.
Among those who are hewing out the new path
are "Students Concerned" on the Stanford campus.
There is also a group of churchmen and laymen,
led by the Brethren, who will travel to Washington
April If). They plan to have three weeks of dis
cussions with high ranking government leaders to
lay a foundation of action for peace.
The possibilities that they can change the minds of
Marshall, Truman, and their congressmen seem slim.
But they will represent thousands of Joe Smiths
and in this era of almost universal gloom it is
important that their voices be heard.
This "World Peace and Brotherhood Mission," led
by Paul Studebaker of the Modesto Church of the
Brethren is trying to save your skin. Give it your
support. This is something you can do.

Less than three years after the end of the last
war almost everybody is agreed that we are heading
for a new one. People today no longer ask whether
there will be another war; they only ask when it
will come. The country, as the world, is in the grip
of hopelessness.
