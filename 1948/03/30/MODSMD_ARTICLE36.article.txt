# Stock Exchange Workers in N.Y. Go Out on Strike

### 
NEW YORK. March 29 (UP) â€”
Employees of the New York Stock
and Curb Exchanges went on strike
today, but the exchanges, heart of
world finance, kept right on oper
ating by using brokers and super
visors to do the work of page boys,
clerks, and tabulators.
Elevator operators also struck in
the towering exchange buildings.
Well-tailored businessmen were at
the controls of those cars which were
in operation.
There were conflicting claims as
to effectiveness from the manage
ment of the two institutions and
from spokesmen of the United Fi
nancial Employees Union (AFL).
The union said more than 1.000 of
its members were out.
Emil Schram, president of the
stock exchange, said operations were
near normal. The brokers, who pay
more than 550.000 for a seat on the
exchange, had made an operational
blueprint for use in case of the
strike and Schram said that within
a few days the walkout should have
no effect at all.
But union president M. David
Keeke said the usual telephone quo
tation service to customers and the
operation of clearing transactions
were "knocked out." He said his
union was prepared to stay out "for
six months if necessary" and in
tended to call out also UFE em
ployees of brokerage houses.
