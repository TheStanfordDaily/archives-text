# Ronald Colman's Acting Redeems 'A Double Life'
## 
### 
Another of Hollywood's long pa
rade of psychological movies, "A
Double Life," currently playing at
the Varsity Theater, mixes a rather
unbelievable situation with some
very amateur psychology.
That the mixture is not unpleas
ing is due mainly to the excellent
acting of Ronald Colman, who won
the Academy Award for his role.
He does an expert job as Anthony
John, an actor who becomes so
identified with the characters he
plays that he loses his mind. His
scenes as Shakespeare's Othello,
however, are a trifle hammy.
"A Double Life" takes an overly
long time to transform Colman from

the debonair gentleman he is when
j lie aets in a comedy to the jealous
murderer into which Othello turns
him; the basic situation ol the pic
ture, that he should change, is not
| quite believable.
The scene in which Othello kills
Desdemona was played five or six
j times, but an audience does not go
[ to a picture to be able to repeat a
scene word for word and that was
all the scene accomplished.

I wife, and Edmund O'Brien, as the
| press agent, perform adequately if
I nothing more. Shelley Winthers, as
; a tramp waitress, displays a great
I deal of talent. —Levin
