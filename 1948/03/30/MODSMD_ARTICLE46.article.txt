# Cards' Streak Broken In Split With UCLA
## 
### 
If the Stanford varsity baseball \
team can manage to score as many j
runs in other innings as they did in 1
the first inning against UCLA, they
may find themselves up near the top
in the CIBA ladder.
In the two-game series played at
vVestwood last week, the Indians
opened both tilts with big scoring
splurges, but from the second in
ning on, they managed to roil up
only a large number of goose eggs.
In the Friday game the Cards scored ,
three big runs which looked like j
enough for five innings but wasn't.
The locals scored only one more run j
after the big first, and this total !
wasn't enough to match the seven
runs scored by the Bruins.
HICKS KNOCKLD OUT OF BOX
Again on Saturday Coach Wol- j
ter's charges opened up their heavy !
artillery and pushed over five runs
off Bruin hurler Joe Hicks, but once
Hicks left the scene, the Indians :
suffered an acute scoring famine, j
However, left-hander Dave Dahle
administered an even worse dose to j
the enemy and gave up only four i
hits and one run.
With USC's Trojans knocking
over all opposition, collegiate and
professional, and last year's cham- |
pion California Bears showing signs
of returning power, the road toj
glory will be rough and rocky for j
the Indians.
use NOT INVINCIBLE
Already USC has beaten Seattle,
Los Angeles, Hollywood, the Chi- I
cago White Sox, and the Cleveland
Indian B's. However, the Trojans j
can be stopped since they fell 5 to 4 J
c.t the hands of the Douglas Broth- |
ers All-Stars, an only better-than
average semi-pro outfit.

! California is currently sharing the
j loop lead with the Trojans. Each
1 has a one-won and none-lost rec
ord. The Trojans trounced UCLA,
13 to 0, while the Bears did all kinds
|of scoring feats in crushing St.
Mary's, 25 to 7. Even without such
stars as Jensen, Larner, Butler.
Brown, and Remus, the Bears are
plenty rugged.
CARD 111 I TING WEAK
In the Los Angeles contests a
j number of important facts were
i brought out concerning the Indians.
Number one is hitting. Although the
j Cards hit well against a number of
! weak practice-game opponents, they
went into a complete tailspin again, :t
the Bruins.
I In two games Coach Wolter's men
j were able to collect only 11 hits. Of
these there was only one extra base
blow, a double by Arce. Bob Nava
got four singles in two games, Pe
! ters two, and the rest of the squad
| had to be content to point to their
fielding performances.
FARM INFIELD UP TO PAR
The Stanford infield is as good as
any in the league, and the outfield
is not far behind as far as defensive
work goes. No team can go without
pitching, and the Indians are no
exception. Coach Wolter has five
pitchers who are capable of winning
any time with luck.
Stott looked fair in his five-inning
stint on Friday but wasn't impres
sive. Flatland, who lost the game,
just wasn't lucky. Had not Frank
Munoz's blow landed in between
the outfielders the story might have j
been different.
Dave Dahle showed a world of
stuff on Saturday and was always
tough in the clutch.
