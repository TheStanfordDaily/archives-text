# Baseballers to Meet Tonight
## 
### 
The "Stanford varsity baseballers
arc scheduled to travel Ifj Stockton
this evening to engage the College
of Pacific Tigers in a nis?ht game.
However, the game may be called
off or .shifted to an afternoon game
since Coach Harry Wolter is reluc
tant to play at night this early in
the season.
At present the locals arc in need
of hitting practice against good
pitching and tonight's game may.
well be the answer, particularly if
Stan McWilliams, Pacific's all-con
ference baseball and basketball
star, does the pitching. Another fa
mi iar face in the COP line-up is
second baseman Eddie Le Baron
who was all-Coast quarterback for
the Tigers last fall.
Against the UCLA Bruins last
week, the Indians landed only 11
safe blows in two games. This lack
of hitting power caused the Tribe to
drop their first game of the season
and tonight's line-up may include a
few changes since Coach Wolter is
in desperate need of some batting
punch.
Chai lie Bell or Frank La√ürum,
neither of which got into the Bruin
tilts, will get the pitching assign
ment in all probability. After to
night's game the Cards will rest
until Saturday when they will trav
el to Berkeley to play Cal in a
CIBA league game.
