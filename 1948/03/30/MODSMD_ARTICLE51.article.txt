# PCL Season Opens Today: Seals Favored to Win Flag
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Pacific Coast League launches
its 1948 season today and tonight,
an-.! coast moguls are anticipating
another big year at the box office.
Last year's total attendance of 4.-
068.432 set a new record, and the
PCL will be out to better this
mark in an attempt to prove that
the coast is ab'e to support major
league baseball.
From here it looks like a two
way race for the pennant between
Oakland and San Francisco, with
Portland and Sacramento as defi
nite contenders.
SEALS ARE FAVORITES
The Seals have a well-balanced
club and are the logical favorites.
The loss of Chesnes, Sheridan, and
White has been offset by the ac
quisition of pitchers Tom Fine and
Ken Gab'es, outfielder Gene Wood
ling, and first baseman Mickey
Rocco. Rocco, Dino Restelli, and
Joe Brovia furnish the long - ball
hitting, while Cliff Melton, Jack
Brewer, and Bob Joyce are the nu
cleus of a dependable pitching staff.
The Oaks could give their
cross-bay rivals quite a battle pro
viding their pitchers come through.
Will Haley promises to be the num
ber one pitcher on the coast this
year, but the rest of the staff is an
unknown quantity. Merrill Combs
at third base will strengthen the in
field and Scarsella, Lodigiani. and
Christopher provide the hitting.
ORENGO PILOTS SACS
Sacramento, under a new mana
ger, Joe Orengo, could prove to be
the surprise team of the year. The
Solons have an experienced squad
which includes such veterans as
Ernie Lombardi, Babe Dahlgren.
Jack Salveson, Ted Jennings, and
Rip Russell.
Portland has essentially the same
roster which finished third last sea
son. but help from the Yankees
should be forthcoming. Vince Di
Bias should be a 20-game winner,
and the acquisition of hard-hitting
Fenton Mole fills the first base po
sition left vacant by George Vico.
Seattle has strengthened its team
with replacements but lacks heavy
hitters. Herm Besse, a towering
southpaw, has looked good on the
mound while Hillis Layne, PCL lxit

ting champ hist yea' - , is still around.
ANGELS NEED HELP
Los Angeles will be as good as
the Cuks make them. However,
right now the Angels without Os
trowski, Chambers, Dcbernic, and
Maddern are a second - rate ball
club. If the Cubs provide enough
help. LA is definitely a pennant
contender.
San Diego and Hollywood have
improved, but both clubs lack ca
pable pitchers.
The starting pitchers for opening
day games are as loilows:
San Francisco at Sacramento (af
ternoon — Jack Brewer vs. Jack
Salveson.
Portland at Oakland (afternoon)
—Vince Di Biasi or Ad Liska vs.
Will Haley.
Seattle at Hollywood (nieht) —
Rugger Ardizoia vs. Guy Fletcher or
Herm Besse.
Los Angeles at San Diego (night)
Red Lynn vs. Tom Seats.

unknown quantity. Merrill Combs
at third base will strengthen the in
field and Scarsella, Lodigiani. and
Christopher provide the hitting.
ORENGO PILOTS SACS
Sacramento, under a new mana
ger, Joe Orengo, could prove to be
the surprise team of the year. The
Solons have an experienced squad
which includes such veterans as
Ernie Lombardi, Babe Dahlgren.
Jack Salveson, Ted Jennings, and
Rip Russell.
Portland has essentially the same
roster which finished third last sea
son. but help from the Yankees
should be forthcoming. Vince Di
Bias should be a 20-game winner,
and the acquisition of hard-hitting
Fenton Mole fills the first base po
sition left vacant by George Vico.
Seattle has strengthened its team
with replacements but lacks heavy
hitters. Herm Besse, a towering
southpaw, has looked good on the
mound while Hillis Layne, PCL lxit

ting champ hist yea' - , is still around.
ANGELS NEED HELP
Los Angeles will be as good as
the Cuks make them. However,
right now the Angels without Os
trowski, Chambers, Dcbernic, and
Maddern are a second - rate ball
club. If the Cubs provide enough
help. LA is definitely a pennant
contender.
San Diego and Hollywood have
improved, but both clubs lack ca
pable pitchers.
The starting pitchers for opening
day games are as loilows:
San Francisco at Sacramento (af
ternoon — Jack Brewer vs. Jack
Salveson.
Portland at Oakland (afternoon)
—Vince Di Biasi or Ad Liska vs.
Will Haley.
Seattle at Hollywood (nieht) —
Rugger Ardizoia vs. Guy Fletcher or
Herm Besse.
Los Angeles at San Diego (night)
Red Lynn vs. Tom Seats.
The Pacific Coast League launches
its 1948 season today and tonight,
an-.! coast moguls are anticipating
another big year at the box office.
Last year's total attendance of 4.-
068.432 set a new record, and the
PCL will be out to better this
mark in an attempt to prove that
the coast is ab'e to support major
league baseball.
From here it looks like a two
way race for the pennant between
Oakland and San Francisco, with
Portland and Sacramento as defi
nite contenders.
SEALS ARE FAVORITES
The Seals have a well-balanced
club and are the logical favorites.
The loss of Chesnes, Sheridan, and
White has been offset by the ac
quisition of pitchers Tom Fine and
Ken Gab'es, outfielder Gene Wood
ling, and first baseman Mickey
Rocco. Rocco, Dino Restelli, and
Joe Brovia furnish the long - ball
hitting, while Cliff Melton, Jack
Brewer, and Bob Joyce are the nu
cleus of a dependable pitching staff.
The Oaks could give their
cross-bay rivals quite a battle pro
viding their pitchers come through.
Will Haley promises to be the num
ber one pitcher on the coast this
year, but the rest of the staff is an
unknown quantity. Merrill Combs
at third base will strengthen the in
field and Scarsella, Lodigiani. and
