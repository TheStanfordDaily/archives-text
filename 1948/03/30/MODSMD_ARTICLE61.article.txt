# 'Bring British To U.S. Schools' Americans Ask
## 
### 
Several hundred American stu
dents studying in England have ap
pealed to U. S. educators, newspa
pers, and private organizations to
help bring British students to
American colleges in the fall.
The appeal was in the form of a
letter signed by presidents of three
American Student Associations at
Cambridge, London, and Oxford.
The letter pointed out that British
universities are now overcrowded
and American students are further
complicating the situation, that
could be somewhat relieved by
bringing more English students to
this country.
