## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP) — Forced to testify by federal
court order and under threat of a contempt citation, John L.
Lewis told President Truman's fact-finding board today that he
did not "inspire" the 16-day-old soft coal strike.
The burly United Mine Workers president, who took a $710,000

licking in his last court battle with
the government, testified for 50 min
utes. He was angry and defiant.
The board then adjourned its
hearings, and Chairman Sherman
Minton said it might be able to
report to President Truman by to
morrow. The President is then ex
pected to instruct the Justice De
partment to get a court injunction to
end the walkout.
LEWIS APPEARS BY FORCE
Lewis told the three-member
board that he appeared only "under
the compulsion" of a court order is
sued this morning by Federal Judge
Edward M. Curran. That was the
closest he came to renewing his
charges that the Taft-Hartley Act.
under which the board was created,
is unconstitutional and therefore
the. board has no authority.
His denial that he "inspired" the
walkout came at the end of his tes- j
timony. Chairman Minton asked if j
it wasn't a fact that the nation's coal j
supplies have been interrupted as 1
a direct result of a letter Lewis sent j
to union members on March 12 con- 1
cerning his demand for miners' pen- j
sions.
LETTER ONLY "FUND REPORT" I
Lewis replied calmly that the let- |
ter was a "long-delayed, much over
due report on the (welfare) fund
under the contract." In it, he had
said the operators "dishonored" the
wage agreement by refusing to agree
on the pension plan.
"I get my information from the
main sources—the newspaper—like
everyone else does," Lewis replied.
"I think the miners may have come
to the conclusion that they have
been sold a gold brick."


JOHN L. LEWIS testified yester
day before President Truman's
fact-finding board.
