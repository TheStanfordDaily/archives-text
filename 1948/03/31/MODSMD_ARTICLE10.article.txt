# Varied Radio Training Program Will Be Conducted by KSU This Quarter
## 
### 
Station KSU department heads |
will this quarter initiate a training
program for station staff members, I
designed to prepare students for I
jobs in the radio industry.
Station Relations Manager Joe j
Lipper said yesterday that classes J
will be set up for neophyte an- ;
nouncers. studio teclmicians, engi
neers, producers, advertising sales- !
men, and writers. Classes will be :
conducted by experienced staff
members.
STATION IN* SECOND YEAR
"With the station in its second
year," Lipper said, "we'll have to
stop relying heavily on previously
experienced persons, and start pay
ing more attention to those who
have to start from scratch."
Begun a little over a year ago by
a few interested students, KSU dur- j
ing the past year has expanded to j
contain more than 15 special de- |
partments. The increased speciali- j
zation necessary to the running of a
♦•adio station, states Bill Kane, pro
gram director, has made difficulties
in finding specialized personnel.
'"With an increasingly complex
organization," Kane said, "we've !

had to depend largely on persons
with previous experience in com
mercial radio. In pioneering a new
radio station, those persons have j
shouldered most of the load, and
have not had time to train others in
their specialties. Now we'll have to
do just that."
Classes will be designed to ac
quaint newcomers with current
practices in radio. Sessions will be S
held every one or two weeks, and
will be open not only to staff mem
bers and tryoutees but to all inter
ested persons.
OUTSIDE SPEAKERS
In some cases, outside speakers
will be invited to bring members up
to date on industry procedures.
Department heads in charge will j
be Fred Steiner, chief announcer;
Joe Kopsho, chief engineer; Lee ;
Falk, production manager; and j
Chuck Black, continuity director, j
Steve Phillips, station manager, will j
handle advertising and time sales.
Phillips stated that the Univo'Hty
is expanding courses und<:r the |
speech and drama department, but j
the KSU seminars are open to ev
eryone. '
