# House Approves Measure Including Spain in ERP
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP) — The House wrote Franco
Spaih into the European Recovery program today and authorized
the ERP administrator to embargo shipments of any commodity
to Russia and her satellites.
The Senate also completed its own three-part foreign assistance

legislation by approving a one-vear,
$463,000,000 program of military and
economic aid to China. The Senate
previously had passed the $5,300,-
000.000 ERP bill and okayed $275,-
000,000 of military help for Greece
and Turkey.
"SINGLE PACKAGE"
All three projects, plus a $60,-
000,000, contribution to the United
Nations Children's Relief Fund, are
wrapped up in the "single package"
$6,205,000,000 foreign aid bill before
the House.
The Senate passed its China aid
legislation by a thundering voicr
vote after Chairman Arthur H. Van
denberg, R.. Mich., of the foreign
relations committee, warned tha
speed is vital in the present critical
world situation.
STORMY DEBATE
The House, however, engaged ir
angry debate over a rapid-fire suc
cession of amendments offered to
its overall foreign aid measure.
The row started when Rep. Alvin
E. O'Konski. R.. Wis., obtained a
standing vote on his amendment to
add Spain to the ERP countries.
It passed by a 148 to 52 vote over
the alarmed warnings of its foes
that such action would be a "grave
mistake."
The House will get another chance
to pass on the O'Konski amendment;
before the final roll call vote on the
entire bill, but the big margin re
corded on the standing vote made
its passage seem cei-tain.
The amendment authorizing the
ERP administrator to halt commod
ity shipments to Russia and her
Eastern European satellites was of
fered by Rep. Karl E. Mundt, R.„
S. D.. and it, too, was approved by
a voice vote.
