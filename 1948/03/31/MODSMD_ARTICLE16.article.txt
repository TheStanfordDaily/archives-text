# Industry Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP
â€”The armed services today began
drive to register industry for a pos
sible future draft.
It was the first step toward a new
industrial mobilization plan, called
for yesterday by Elder Statesman
Bernard M. Baruch.
Board Chairman Thomas J. Har
greave said the first task in gearing
for possible war production will bt
to send Army, Navy, and Air Force
officers into nearly all plants anc
factories.
There they will try to pin dowr
what each plant can turn out in the
way of war materials if need arise>
Representatives of each service wil
show the plant managers the prod
ucts they want, and the managers
will figure out which ones the\
think they can best produce.
One of the purposes of this meth
od, Hargrave said, is to eliminate
competition between the three serv
ices for the productive capacity o:
individual plants.
