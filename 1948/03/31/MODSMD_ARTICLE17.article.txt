# Truman Approves 'Weak' Rent Law
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 30 (UP).
â€”President Truman today signed
into law the new rent control exten
sion bill but voiced strong doubts
that it would hold the line fully on
rents.
The President's action, which ex
tends rent controls until March 31,
1949, came less than 3G hours before
existing controls were due to ex
pire. The new law, a revised form
of present controls, leaves final de
cisions on disputed local rent rec
ommendations to the Emergency
Appeals Court.
Mr. Truman was sharply critical
of many provisions. He said they
"weakened" his efforts at tighter
rent control but Congress left him
no choice but to sign.
BLAMES CONGRESS
Claiming the measure "will not
give tenants all the protection they
should have" during the present
housing shortage, he added that it
was "better than no rent control at
all."
He said that Congress must shoul
der full responsibility for what
mifjht happen.
WILL USE INJUNCTIONS
He promised that officials will do
all they can under the new law to
keep rents at "reasonable levels."
He said the housing expediter would
make full use of his new power to
file injunctions against landlords
who" charge higher - than - ceiling
rents.
