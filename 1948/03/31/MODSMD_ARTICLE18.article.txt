BOGOTA, Colombia, March 29 (UP) — U. S. Secretary of State
George C. Marshall today obtained the unanimous agreement of
Latin American states for a discussion of the Communist problem
in the Western Hemisphere.
Marshall obtained the agreement from the steering committee

just before the formal opening of
the Ninth Pan-American Confer
ence this afternoon.
ASKS IF DISCUSSION ALLOWED
He asked the committee—formed
of the heads of the 21 delegations—
whether the conference agenda
would allow discussion of subversive
activities in the hemisphere.
"1 should like to raise the question
at this time as to whether the agenda
as now stands may be considered to
permit discussion of the problem of
foreign-inspired subversive activ
ities directed against the institutions
and the peace and security of Amer
ican republics," Marshall said to the
committee.
BRAZILIAN SETS KEYNOTE
Argentine Foreign Minister Juan
A. Brarnuglia suggested that the op
portunity for a discussion would
come when the conference considers
a Guatemalan proposal for the de
fense and preservation of democracy
in America if and when an anti
democratic regime is installed in the
hemisphere.
Brazilian Chief Delegate Joao
Neves da Fontuora set the keynote,
warning that this "materialistic
conception of life—he avoided the
word communism — seeks to drag
humanity towards a new catastro
phe of unforeseeable consequences."
