# Allied Council Still Waiting
## 
### 
BERLIN. March 30 (UP).-Rus
sia's Marshal Vassily D. Sokolovsky,
who walked out of the last Allied
Control Council meeting 10 days
ago, failed to convene the four mili
tary governors today.
The Allied secretariat met this
morning, waited in vain for word
from Sokolovsky to notify the West
ern military governors of a meet
ing, and broke up within ;m hour.
U.S. Military Governor Gen. Lu
cius D. Clay, who becomes chair
man of the council April 1 under
the rotating system, said he had not
yet decided whether he would call
a session next month.
It was not yet clear whether So
kolovsky's action meant the Soviet
Union will boycott the council, Ger
many's governing authority. Should
Clay call a meeting April 10 and the
Russians fail to appear,
