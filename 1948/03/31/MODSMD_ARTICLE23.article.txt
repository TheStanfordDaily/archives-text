## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y„ March 30 (UP) — The United States today
formally proposed a special session of the United Nations General As
sembly to reconsider partition of Palestine.
Russia promptly branded the American plan an "attempt to convert
Palestine into a military-strategic base of the United States and England."'
American Delegate Warren R. Austin also asked the security council
to negotiate an immediate military and political truce between the Jews
and Arabs.
Russian Delegate Andrei Gromyko strongly opposed a special session
of the general assembly, saying it would throw the UN back a year in
its efforts to solve the Palestine dilemma.
He said the United States was bent on killing partition to further its
"own interests and military-Strategic positions in the Middle East."' The
United States had tried in vain to prove that partition could not be carried
out by peaceful means, he added.
Gromyko said the security council was nowhere near exhausting peace
ful possibilities of implementing the UN partition program. He said the
UN should push forward with the partition plan on schedule.
Austin made no mention of the United Slates plan to substitute a
temporary Palestine trusteeship for the UN partition program. But he
emphasized later that the United States still favored this solution, but
did not want to lose time by plunging the council into a debate over details.
