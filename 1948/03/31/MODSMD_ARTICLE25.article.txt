## 'Dear Teacher...' 
### 
Yesterday we told the Administration we thought the reg system
worked far more efficiently this quarter than ever before. Now,
while the quarter is still young, here's a suggestion to the in
structors.
Why don't you, who after all are in charge of the classes, re
mind students of the Honor Code sometime this week? Tell us
what type of assistance and cooperation in outside work you con
sider to be unpermitted aid. Many professors do a fine job in
previewing their course the first few days, but still students are
left in doubt about doing homework together.
Just a few minutes of explanation on your part will clear up
an important point and do away with a lot of grief.
