## Palestine Problem 
### 
To the Editor:
Noting the interest in the Palestine problem as shown by numerous
letters in The Daily, it occurred to me that it might be worthwhile to
publish the excellent objective statement made on this subject by Allen
Drury, a former Stanford student whose column used to be a feature
of the Stanford Daily when he was in school. Drury is now a professional
columnist writing from Washington. His column appears in the Palo Alto
Times three times a week. Most of the contributions hitherto published
have been strongly Zionist. Perhaps we might have one that is merely
American.

TRAGIC PALESTINE ISSUE
BY ALLEN DRURY
Home to roost in the doorsteps of all the people who played politics
to bring it about has come the problem of the Palestine partition.
From the administration, which lobbied and pressured the United
Nations General Assembly into ordering it, to the members of Congress
and the leaders of private organizations whose constant outcries pres
sured the adminstration into pressuring the UN, they are one and all
face to face with the consequences of an action which was hasty, ill
advised and taken without relation to the practical realities which exist
in the present-day world.
Unless luck beyond expectation attends the elTorts of the world, the
partition can very easily turn out to be the crisis which ends the United
Nations and so puts a final stop to perhaps the last great experiment
in peace which mankind will have the chance to make.
In the United States the major goad to administration action on
Palestine has always been the Jewish vote in Now York. The same
inspiration lias been behind the long-continuing congressional demands
that the administration do something about it. . . .
Partition came and chaos followed. Prevented by the Soviet Union
from establishing military forces which might conceivably have been
able to support the decision (a fact which perhaps accounted for the
unusual Soviet willingness to agree with the United States on the
final vote), the UN was left holding the bag. The United States, just
yesterday the prime mover and stout champion, ran along home after
giving the UN its fervent blessing. Immediately the situation began to
deteriorate. Bloodshed broke out in Palestine; the Middle East began
to split at the seams. The United States began to be hoist on its own
petard: the Jews have the votes but the Arabs have the oil. And the
American people won't support a firm stand toward either. . . .
In the face of this unhappy and as yet unresolved situation, the
partition begins to appear for what it was, an over-extension of United
Nations power, a promise which the UN is physically unable, and the
U. S. politically unable, to keep.
By deeds such as this are wars made and the hopes of peoples
cast down.
It is one of the great tragedies of history that when the Jewish dream
at last showed some sign of coming true, it was brought into being too
fast, with too little preparation, and by a method which may very well
destroy the one frail hope of Jew and Gentile alike for a world in
which persecutions can be ended and peace be made secure.

letters in The Daily, it occurred to me that it might be worthwhile to
publish the excellent objective statement made on this subject by Allen
Drury, a former Stanford student whose column used to be a feature
of the Stanford Daily when he was in school. Drury is now a professional
columnist writing from Washington. His column appears in the Palo Alto
Times three times a week. Most of the contributions hitherto published
have been strongly Zionist. Perhaps we might have one that is merely
American.

TRAGIC PALESTINE ISSUE
BY ALLEN DRURY
Home to roost in the doorsteps of all the people who played politics
to bring it about has come the problem of the Palestine partition.
From the administration, which lobbied and pressured the United
Nations General Assembly into ordering it, to the members of Congress
and the leaders of private organizations whose constant outcries pres
sured the adminstration into pressuring the UN, they are one and all
face to face with the consequences of an action which was hasty, ill
advised and taken without relation to the practical realities which exist
in the present-day world.
Unless luck beyond expectation attends the elTorts of the world, the
partition can very easily turn out to be the crisis which ends the United
Nations and so puts a final stop to perhaps the last great experiment
in peace which mankind will have the chance to make.
In the United States the major goad to administration action on
Palestine has always been the Jewish vote in Now York. The same
inspiration lias been behind the long-continuing congressional demands
that the administration do something about it. . . .
Partition came and chaos followed. Prevented by the Soviet Union
from establishing military forces which might conceivably have been
able to support the decision (a fact which perhaps accounted for the
unusual Soviet willingness to agree with the United States on the
final vote), the UN was left holding the bag. The United States, just
yesterday the prime mover and stout champion, ran along home after
giving the UN its fervent blessing. Immediately the situation began to
deteriorate. Bloodshed broke out in Palestine; the Middle East began
to split at the seams. The United States began to be hoist on its own
petard: the Jews have the votes but the Arabs have the oil. And the
American people won't support a firm stand toward either. . . .
In the face of this unhappy and as yet unresolved situation, the
partition begins to appear for what it was, an over-extension of United
Nations power, a promise which the UN is physically unable, and the
U. S. politically unable, to keep.
By deeds such as this are wars made and the hopes of peoples
