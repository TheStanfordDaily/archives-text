## History 1948 
### 
Not since Gen. Winfield Scott's march on Mexico
City has national feeling against Americans been
higher especially among the campesinos, the small
farmers. The United States in just 10 months of
stumbling through Mexico in its eradication of over
300.000 lean and diseased hoof-and-mouth infected
cattle, has tripped over its own diplomacy and fallen
flat—where it hurts the most: on its Pan-American
ism. We're now brushing ourselves off—having been
handed a "cease and desist" order by President
Aleman—and wondering where to Pan-Americanize
next.
Actually our only blunder was naivete.
In April, 1947, after long and anguished screams
for help from Mexico, who suddenly found herself
scourged with hoof-and-mouth disease, we signed a
bi-lateral treaty, agreeing to send Department of
Agriculture men into Mexico to eradicate the disease.
We were well prepared; nine U. S. outbreaks, the
most serious in 1914, which cost the U. S. $9,000,000,
had taught us some lessons. We agreed to bring down
crews, set up slaughter stations, and pay for all
slaughtered cattle; the Mexicans would supply an
army to help us and pay for smaller animals —goats,
sheep, and pigs—that would be killed.
Naively we waded in, flags flying, speeches flowing
—and trailing a blank check which eventually was
filled in for the tidy amount of $35,000,000 and the
recommendation from Congress to keep going and
to keep spending.
That Mexico ever got hoof-and-mouth was no
surprise to anyone. Her own system of mordidas—
the bribe—brought into the country 160 Zebu bulls
from Brazil late in 1946. Despite a U. S.-Mexican
sanitary convention, all signs pointed to an open
violation; the imported bulls, supposed to have been
quarantined on the off-Vera Cruz island of Sacri
ficios, got ashore somehow. In just one month hoof
and-mouth disease was rampant.
None of the other South American countries was
very willing to help; in fact, they were mighty glad
aftosa—hoof-and-mouth—had actually come to Mex
ico. Aftosa was chronic in those countries and it
was good to have a companion in misfortune—
economically it might close U. S. beef markets to
Mexico just as their markets were shut.
The only helping hand came from the United
States.
But the campaign was not underway a month until
the fireworks started. Campesinos, whose cattle
were diagnosed infected, blocked roads. Our Bureau
of Animal Industry men who went to small villages
began to depend more and more on the Mexican
army.
The Mexican Army began to depend more and
more on the Americans—and their equipment rolling
in from the north. By mid-summer, roadblocking
was chronic. In one mile of road 15 heavy stones
might be rolled to stop traffic. The roadblockers
were never visible. Campesinos, used to the terrain,
had a way of vanishing. Campesinos refused to bring
their cattle down to the pits; army troops scurried
the hills, shooting cattle on the spot and not reim
bursing the campesinos, since they had forced the
action by non-cooperation.
The real incident—as everyone knew it would—
came last September., when a Mexican veterinary
and his army escort were invited for dinner by
villagers of Senguio, Michoacan. After dinner the
hosts quietly stabbed and quartered their guests.
Michoacan was site of ex-President General Car
denas' point-blank opposition to the eradication
program. Cardenas is one of the state's biggest
cattle owners. It took President Aleman and the
threat of his federal army to block the Cardenas
move—but no one was fooled. The cattle killing
campaign in Mexico was doomed.
In November of last year the U. S. signed a "modi
fication"' program with Mexico. We would stop
killings except on the outer quarantine zone, now
only .'3OO miles south of the border. Instead of kill
ing we'd turn to vaccine. But vaccine, although ex
perimented with in England, Argentina, and Hoi

land, is not successful. The truth is that we are
expecting hoof-and-mouth to invade our borders
any moment.
Meanwhile, in a bitter indictment by Dr. B. T.
Simms, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, the
U. S. admitted that it has been forced to quit the
killings—forced by the threat that Mexico would
invite us to leave. As far as our men who labored
through the hot summer are concerned, the fight is
lost. The quarantine line is breached. Mexican sci
entists have not even prepared a vaccine yet; $35,-
000.000 have been lost down the Mexican sink hole,
and American naivete is experiencing the DTs—
and a dulling pain in that place that hurts the
most—its Pan-Americanism.

The real incident—as everyone knew it would—
came last September., when a Mexican veterinary
and his army escort were invited for dinner by
villagers of Senguio, Michoacan. After dinner the
hosts quietly stabbed and quartered their guests.
Michoacan was site of ex-President General Car
denas' point-blank opposition to the eradication
program. Cardenas is one of the state's biggest
cattle owners. It took President Aleman and the
threat of his federal army to block the Cardenas
move—but no one was fooled. The cattle killing
campaign in Mexico was doomed.
In November of last year the U. S. signed a "modi
fication"' program with Mexico. We would stop
killings except on the outer quarantine zone, now
only .'3OO miles south of the border. Instead of kill
ing we'd turn to vaccine. But vaccine, although ex
perimented with in England, Argentina, and Hoi

land, is not successful. The truth is that we are
expecting hoof-and-mouth to invade our borders
any moment.
Meanwhile, in a bitter indictment by Dr. B. T.
Simms, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, the
U. S. admitted that it has been forced to quit the
killings—forced by the threat that Mexico would
invite us to leave. As far as our men who labored
through the hot summer are concerned, the fight is
lost. The quarantine line is breached. Mexican sci
entists have not even prepared a vaccine yet; $35,-
000.000 have been lost down the Mexican sink hole,
and American naivete is experiencing the DTs—
and a dulling pain in that place that hurts the
most—its Pan-Americanism.
Not since Gen. Winfield Scott's march on Mexico
City has national feeling against Americans been
higher especially among the campesinos, the small
farmers. The United States in just 10 months of
stumbling through Mexico in its eradication of over
300.000 lean and diseased hoof-and-mouth infected
cattle, has tripped over its own diplomacy and fallen
flat—where it hurts the most: on its Pan-American
ism. We're now brushing ourselves off—having been
handed a "cease and desist" order by President
Aleman—and wondering where to Pan-Americanize
next.
Actually our only blunder was naivete.
In April, 1947, after long and anguished screams
for help from Mexico, who suddenly found herself
scourged with hoof-and-mouth disease, we signed a
bi-lateral treaty, agreeing to send Department of
Agriculture men into Mexico to eradicate the disease.
We were well prepared; nine U. S. outbreaks, the
most serious in 1914, which cost the U. S. $9,000,000,
had taught us some lessons. We agreed to bring down
crews, set up slaughter stations, and pay for all
slaughtered cattle; the Mexicans would supply an
army to help us and pay for smaller animals —goats,
sheep, and pigs—that would be killed.
Naively we waded in, flags flying, speeches flowing
—and trailing a blank check which eventually was
filled in for the tidy amount of $35,000,000 and the
recommendation from Congress to keep going and
to keep spending.
That Mexico ever got hoof-and-mouth was no
surprise to anyone. Her own system of mordidas—
the bribe—brought into the country 160 Zebu bulls
from Brazil late in 1946. Despite a U. S.-Mexican
sanitary convention, all signs pointed to an open
violation; the imported bulls, supposed to have been
quarantined on the off-Vera Cruz island of Sacri
ficios, got ashore somehow. In just one month hoof
and-mouth disease was rampant.
None of the other South American countries was
very willing to help; in fact, they were mighty glad
aftosa—hoof-and-mouth—had actually come to Mex
ico. Aftosa was chronic in those countries and it
was good to have a companion in misfortune—
economically it might close U. S. beef markets to
Mexico just as their markets were shut.
The only helping hand came from the United
States.
But the campaign was not underway a month until
the fireworks started. Campesinos, whose cattle
were diagnosed infected, blocked roads. Our Bureau
of Animal Industry men who went to small villages
began to depend more and more on the Mexican
army.
The Mexican Army began to depend more and
more on the Americans—and their equipment rolling
in from the north. By mid-summer, roadblocking
was chronic. In one mile of road 15 heavy stones
might be rolled to stop traffic. The roadblockers
were never visible. Campesinos, used to the terrain,
had a way of vanishing. Campesinos refused to bring
their cattle down to the pits; army troops scurried
the hills, shooting cattle on the spot and not reim
bursing the campesinos, since they had forced the
action by non-cooperation.

That Mexico ever got hoof-and-mouth was no
surprise to anyone. Her own system of mordidas—
the bribe—brought into the country 160 Zebu bulls
from Brazil late in 1946. Despite a U. S.-Mexican
sanitary convention, all signs pointed to an open
violation; the imported bulls, supposed to have been
quarantined on the off-Vera Cruz island of Sacri
ficios, got ashore somehow. In just one month hoof
and-mouth disease was rampant.
None of the other South American countries was
very willing to help; in fact, they were mighty glad
aftosa—hoof-and-mouth—had actually come to Mex
ico. Aftosa was chronic in those countries and it
was good to have a companion in misfortune—
economically it might close U. S. beef markets to
Mexico just as their markets were shut.
The only helping hand came from the United
States.
But the campaign was not underway a month until
the fireworks started. Campesinos, whose cattle
were diagnosed infected, blocked roads. Our Bureau
of Animal Industry men who went to small villages
began to depend more and more on the Mexican
army.
The Mexican Army began to depend more and
more on the Americans—and their equipment rolling
in from the north. By mid-summer, roadblocking
was chronic. In one mile of road 15 heavy stones
might be rolled to stop traffic. The roadblockers
were never visible. Campesinos, used to the terrain,
had a way of vanishing. Campesinos refused to bring
their cattle down to the pits; army troops scurried
the hills, shooting cattle on the spot and not reim
bursing the campesinos, since they had forced the
action by non-cooperation.
The real incident—as everyone knew it would—
came last September., when a Mexican veterinary
and his army escort were invited for dinner by
villagers of Senguio, Michoacan. After dinner the
hosts quietly stabbed and quartered their guests.
Michoacan was site of ex-President General Car
denas' point-blank opposition to the eradication
program. Cardenas is one of the state's biggest
cattle owners. It took President Aleman and the
threat of his federal army to block the Cardenas
move—but no one was fooled. The cattle killing
campaign in Mexico was doomed.
In November of last year the U. S. signed a "modi
fication"' program with Mexico. We would stop
killings except on the outer quarantine zone, now
only .'3OO miles south of the border. Instead of kill
ing we'd turn to vaccine. But vaccine, although ex
perimented with in England, Argentina, and Hoi

land, is not successful. The truth is that we are
expecting hoof-and-mouth to invade our borders
any moment.
Meanwhile, in a bitter indictment by Dr. B. T.
Simms, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, the
U. S. admitted that it has been forced to quit the
killings—forced by the threat that Mexico would
invite us to leave. As far as our men who labored
through the hot summer are concerned, the fight is
lost. The quarantine line is breached. Mexican sci
entists have not even prepared a vaccine yet; $35,-
000.000 have been lost down the Mexican sink hole,
and American naivete is experiencing the DTs—
and a dulling pain in that place that hurts the
most—its Pan-Americanism.
Not since Gen. Winfield Scott's march on Mexico
City has national feeling against Americans been
higher especially among the campesinos, the small
farmers. The United States in just 10 months of
stumbling through Mexico in its eradication of over
300.000 lean and diseased hoof-and-mouth infected
cattle, has tripped over its own diplomacy and fallen
flat—where it hurts the most: on its Pan-American
ism. We're now brushing ourselves off—having been
handed a "cease and desist" order by President
Aleman—and wondering where to Pan-Americanize
next.
Actually our only blunder was naivete.
In April, 1947, after long and anguished screams
for help from Mexico, who suddenly found herself
scourged with hoof-and-mouth disease, we signed a
bi-lateral treaty, agreeing to send Department of
Agriculture men into Mexico to eradicate the disease.
We were well prepared; nine U. S. outbreaks, the
most serious in 1914, which cost the U. S. $9,000,000,
had taught us some lessons. We agreed to bring down
crews, set up slaughter stations, and pay for all
slaughtered cattle; the Mexicans would supply an
army to help us and pay for smaller animals —goats,
sheep, and pigs—that would be killed.
Naively we waded in, flags flying, speeches flowing
—and trailing a blank check which eventually was
filled in for the tidy amount of $35,000,000 and the
recommendation from Congress to keep going and
to keep spending.
