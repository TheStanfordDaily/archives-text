## Life on a Houseboat 
### 
SEATTLE (UP) —John and Virginia Murray were
looking desperately for a place to live last August,
just like many other young veteran couples in
Seattle.
Glancing through the classified ads In a local
newspaper one day, they saw this:
"Houseboat. Three bedrooms. Three baths.
Large living room. Large utility room. Kitchen with
breakfast nook."
It sounded a little unusual but good. Particularly
because it was moored in Portage Bay on the south
edge of the University of Washington campus, where
John was going to school.
They went to see the houseboat. It turned out
to be the old Ariel, a G5-foot passenger boat which
ran on Lake Washington for many years.
It wasn't exactly as luxurious and spacious as the
ad implied. The only plumbing consisted of one cold
water faucet and the vessel needed a heating sys
tem.
But the Murrays were resourceful, they saw possi
bilities in the old boat, which by this time had be
come almost a museum piece in the Pacific Northwest.
So they bought the Ariel for $2,300. The Murrays
and another college veteran couple, Joe and Ann
Melusky, moved into the boat September 1.
The lour began work to make the old ship a com
fortable home. New needs for repair popped up
continually during the first months.
After they put in a new stove and a refrigerator,
the Ariel developed a list to port. Both had to be
put on the same side because of space limitations.
The favorite story of life aboard the Ariel is about
the morning John nearly fell into the lake while
dashing off the boat to an 8 o'clock class.
"The gangplank had slipped off the doorstep during
the night," Joe says,"and John went tearing out
the door. Luckily, he grabbed the door frame and
hung on."
The Murvays and Meluskys are becoming some
what attached to the old Ariel. But both couples
plan to move out when the two husbands receive
their degrees this June.
"It's kind of fun and certainly convenient," says
John. "But we think a dryland home still is the best."
