# Average Eearnings Rise $52

WASHINGTON (UP) â€”The average factory work
er earned $11 a week when President Taft created
the Labor Department 35 years ago today.
Since then his average weekly earnings have
risen to $52.
That has meant a 100 per cent increase in "real
wages," the department said in a birthday review
of its activities. In other words, although the $52
does not buy as much as $52 would have in 1913, it
does buy more than $22 worth of goods at 1913 prices.
The reason weekly income docs not buy more is
because of current high prices, the department said.
The Labor Department doesn't claim the credit
but it is the agency that keeps the records.
