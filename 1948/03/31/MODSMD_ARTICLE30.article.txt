# Tiger and Lion Successfully Mated
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY (UP)—Throwing out all text
books, the Salt Lake City Zoo has accomplished the
supposedly impossible: mating a full grown lion
and tiger, traditionally deadly enemies.
Mae and Huey are boxing playfully in their cage
at the Hogle Zoological Gardens here these days,
and the zoo keeper, Joe Naylor, said Mae, the
three-year-old tigress, was "expecting her first off
spring either in mid-April or early May."
Lions and tigers have been mated before, but as
far as zoologists know, not when brought together
after reaching maturity. The German animal expert,
Carl Hagenbeck, experimented successfully in the
field but his method was to rear the lion and tiger
together from cubhood.
Some of the resulting progeny were sent to zoos
in England and this country, but no case is on rec
ord of a successful mating in the United States.
The hybrid offspring are variously called "tiglions,"
"ligers," and similarly coined terms.
Naylor took nearly 10 months to get his pair to
gether. Mae had a twin sister, named Daisy, both
born in the San Francisco Zoo. When the Hogle
Zoo acquired Huey from Miami. Fla., he was placed
in a cage four stalls from the young tigresses.
Gradually Naylor moved the young lion closer to
the pair, cage by cage. Finally they were in ad
joining cages and began a friendly, if somewhat cau
tious roaring acquaintance.
Last summer Naylor told his boss. Joseph Sloan
of the city parks department, his plans for mating
the pair.

"I was told I was crazy," Naylor said with a
chuckle. "And not only by local authorities. We had
a visit last summer from experts of Bronz Zoo in
New York, and from several West Coast cities, in
cluding Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San
Diego. They all told me I was nuts in even thinking
about it; that I'd find a dead lion on my hands
some morning."
In mid-December Naylor kicked open Huey's cage.
''I literally shoved him in with Daisy and Mae," he
said. "At first they snarled at each other and the
two tigers backed Huey into a corner. There was a
little blood and some fur flew, but that lion was just
plain scared to death."
After a few days of armed truce, Naylor removed
Daisy and left Huey and Mae together.
Two days later they were as friendly as a couple
of puppies," Naylor said. "They'd box together in
the mornings and romp all over the cage together."
He said that on December 28 the pair was mated,
and that the mating season lasted until January 24.
Naylor added that Mae shows all the signs of being
expectant, and that if she is, the kittens are due in
late April or early May. Tigers have a gestation
period of 105 days and usually produce three cubs.
Watching the two animals lying fondly together
with the tigress' head nestled against the lion's
shoulder, "Cupid" Naylor rubbed his hands cheer
fully.
"They're mated now for life," he gloated. "It'd be a
shame to break up such a happy home. And they
said it couldn't be done!"

Naylor took nearly 10 months to get his pair to
gether. Mae had a twin sister, named Daisy, both
born in the San Francisco Zoo. When the Hogle
Zoo acquired Huey from Miami. Fla., he was placed
in a cage four stalls from the young tigresses.
Gradually Naylor moved the young lion closer to
the pair, cage by cage. Finally they were in ad
joining cages and began a friendly, if somewhat cau
tious roaring acquaintance.
Last summer Naylor told his boss. Joseph Sloan
of the city parks department, his plans for mating
the pair.

"I was told I was crazy," Naylor said with a
chuckle. "And not only by local authorities. We had
a visit last summer from experts of Bronz Zoo in
New York, and from several West Coast cities, in
cluding Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San
Diego. They all told me I was nuts in even thinking
about it; that I'd find a dead lion on my hands
some morning."
In mid-December Naylor kicked open Huey's cage.
''I literally shoved him in with Daisy and Mae," he
said. "At first they snarled at each other and the
two tigers backed Huey into a corner. There was a
little blood and some fur flew, but that lion was just
plain scared to death."
After a few days of armed truce, Naylor removed
Daisy and left Huey and Mae together.
Two days later they were as friendly as a couple
of puppies," Naylor said. "They'd box together in
the mornings and romp all over the cage together."
He said that on December 28 the pair was mated,
and that the mating season lasted until January 24.
Naylor added that Mae shows all the signs of being
expectant, and that if she is, the kittens are due in
late April or early May. Tigers have a gestation
period of 105 days and usually produce three cubs.
Watching the two animals lying fondly together
with the tigress' head nestled against the lion's
shoulder, "Cupid" Naylor rubbed his hands cheer
fully.
"They're mated now for life," he gloated. "It'd be a
shame to break up such a happy home. And they
said it couldn't be done!"
SALT LAKE CITY (UP)—Throwing out all text
books, the Salt Lake City Zoo has accomplished the
supposedly impossible: mating a full grown lion
and tiger, traditionally deadly enemies.
Mae and Huey are boxing playfully in their cage
at the Hogle Zoological Gardens here these days,
and the zoo keeper, Joe Naylor, said Mae, the
three-year-old tigress, was "expecting her first off
spring either in mid-April or early May."
Lions and tigers have been mated before, but as
far as zoologists know, not when brought together
after reaching maturity. The German animal expert,
Carl Hagenbeck, experimented successfully in the
field but his method was to rear the lion and tiger
together from cubhood.
Some of the resulting progeny were sent to zoos
in England and this country, but no case is on rec
ord of a successful mating in the United States.
The hybrid offspring are variously called "tiglions,"
"ligers," and similarly coined terms.
