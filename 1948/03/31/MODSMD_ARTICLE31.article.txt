## 
### 
"Gentlemen's Agreement." now
playing at the Stanford Theater,
portrays anti-Semitism. The story
concerns itself with a writer who
pretends for six weeks that he is a
Jew in order to get material lor a
magazine article.
This picture is intended to reach
those "who would never give a dime
to Gerald L. K. Smith or go near an
..nti-Semitic meeting." Yet it gently
sidesteps the issue and a sugar
coated pill is produced employing
the very euphemisms of those it
seeks to criticize, as when Mr. Peck,
in a rather circuitous manner, ex
plains to his son just what a Jew is.
Although the boys down in Holly
wood deserve some slight praise for
their attempt to deal with a real
problem, they should have waited
until they could tackle the monster

in a more convincing manner.
John Garfield, as a Jewish vet
eran. turns in the best performance.
Gregory Peck, the hero, does well,
although he becomes disconcerting
ly over-elated whenever "an idea
clicks inside of him." Dorothy Mac-
Guire and Ann Revere are also in
volved in the picture.
"Bill and Coo. " produced by Ken
Murray, has a clever idea behind it,
but as it turns out it is an overlong
piece of nonsense. The actors in this
strip consist principally of an unin
teresting crow in addition to what is
probably the largest flock of parrots
ever assembled outside of Central
America. The picture is made in
trucolor. If this does not put you
to sleep. Murray's feckless narration
will. He seems to do better with
Marie Wilson around.—Gilrov
