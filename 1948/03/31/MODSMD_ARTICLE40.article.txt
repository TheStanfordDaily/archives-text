# NY Yankees American Loop Choice; Red Sox Are Strong
## 
### JACK BLOOD 
The seven other American League
clubs will be out to stop the Yan
kees in the 1948 pennant race. All
have opened their respective train
ing camps — five in Florida, one
(Cleveland) in Arizona, and St.
Louis and Chicago near Los Ange
les.
The Yanks of 1948 will remind
sports followers of the old Ruth,
Gehrig, Coombes era and the later
date Murderers' Row of DiMaggio.
Gehrig, Dickey, and Crosetti in the
late thirties. Bucky Harris has Di-
Maggio, Keller, and Henrich in the
outfield; McQuinn, Stirnweiss, Riz
zuto, and Bill Johnson in the infield.
For pitching Harris has Spud
Chandler, Frank Shea, and Allie
Reynolds, all potential 20 - game
winners. In addition, the Yanks
have picked up two more depend
able hurlers — "Red" Embree from
Cleveland and southpaw Eddie Lo
pat from the White Sox.
For utility, the Bombers will have
Bobby Brown, who played on the
1042 Stanford frosh team. Bobby
had the unique distinction of being
a "perfect" pinch hitter in last
year's World Series.
BOSTON COULD BE TOUGH
The Boston Red Sox, under the
new managership of ex-Yankee Joe
McCarthy, seem to be the only team
capable of even challenging the
Yanks. If pitchers Cecil "Tex"
Hughson, Dave Ferris, and Mickey
Harris can regain their 1946 form,
the Bo Sox will be tough.
The Beantowners were strength
ened by obtaining pitcher Jack Kra
mer and shortstop Junior Stephens.
With Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio,
Bobby Doerr, and Stephens supply

ing the power, the Red Sox enul
cause trouble IF their pitchin
comes through.
Whether or not Hal Newhou.sc
and "Dizzy" Trout can maintain an
other big season is the big cjucstio
for Detroit. Trout showed signs (
slowing down last year.
TKiERS HAVE KESEKVES
However, A 1 Benton, "Fire
Trucks, and Freddy Hutchinson wi
Help to take up the slack if Troi
disappoints. Dick Wakefield is sti
Steve O'Neill's leading hitter.
Close behind in the race for thii
should be Cleveland and the A'
The Indians are shy on pitchin
strength with Bobby Feller as the
only "stopper." Joe Gordon and L<>
Boudreau give the Tribe infill
strength and Buddy Rosar is a toj
notch catcher. What Bouclren
needs most is pitching and a pair <
outfielders.
MACKMEN MAY SURPRISE
Connie Mack's Athletics were tl
surprise last year. Marchildo
Fowler, and MacMahon are tlm
effective pitchers. Sophomore fir.
baseman Ferris Fain and vetera
outfielder Sam Chapman shou
give the Mackmen their necessai
punch.
Fighting it out for the last thn
places will probably be the Chicag
White Sox, the Washington Sen;
tors, and the St. Louis Browns. Tl
White Sox under Teddy Lyons hn
a veteran team last year. They mu
rebuild to replace such ancients
Luke Appling, Taffy Wright, an
others.
