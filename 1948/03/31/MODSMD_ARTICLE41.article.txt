# Bear Nine Weakened By Five-Man Loss
## 
### BY JOHN HERBOLD 
Next Saturday the Indians' varsity baseball team will invade the
ir of the snarling California Bear, at present the holder of the Na-
Dnal Collegiate Baseball Championship.
The Bear was severely wounded when five of his first string
layers were unable to don Cal uniforms this year. Four of these

a,vers, Virg Butler, Dick Larner,
ic-kie Jensen, and Jimmy Brown,
ere declared ineligible for further
ay this year. Butler, Lamer, and
rown immediately withdrew from
•liool and signed professional con
acts.
The fifth player, second-baseman
Jinny Ramos, died following an
ltomobile accident.
Although injured, the Bear is still
and shows signs of wanting
• retain the pennant for 1948. Last
•ar the Indians almost pushed the
oars out of the running with a sur
ising victory, and the Bears are
ell aware of their opponent's im
essive record in play so far this
>ar.
Coach Clint Evans probably has
ie strongest outfield in the CIBA
rcuit, with the possible exception
use.
ISCAI INI SLUGGER
"Big John" Fiscalini patrols left—
•Id and does it fairly well, but he
known much better for his hitting
)iJily. Last year the '"big one" led
e league in that department. It
as "Big John" who parked one of
ojan hurler Wally Hood's pitches
r er the wall to win tho play-off
ime for the championship. It was
so "Big John" who singled in the
nth inning against Texas t'> keep
e Bears in the running for the
itional title.
His running mate in center is Lyle
timer, a .377 hitter, who is unques
jnably the best lead-off man and
ise-runner in the loop. Cliff Mc- j
ain is the weakest hitting out

ason.

id Dingfelder can probably hold

fielding is concerned, but Lloyd
erirman's hitting could still be
ed.
In fact, fielding seems to be the
ide of the Stanfrod infield, too. |
11 Arce, who turned in a nice 1
lassisted double play against
CLA, is as good as they come,
lortstop Brownson has had plenty I
experience in fielding.
On the other side of second, not
uch gets by Mr. Bobby Peters
ther. At first base Coach Wolter
obably wishes he could combine j
>nny Cardinalli's hitting with
larlie Cole's fielding, but both do
1 right in either department.
EAR FIELDING WEAK
On the other hand, the Bear's in
id appears to be somewhat like a
■ve.
Second baseman Tim Cronin
esn't play as Joe used to, and
manages to contribute a couple i
errors per game. His stick work
s not been too bad. and there is
.vays room for improvement.
Jerry Silverstein also kicks the
rsehide around like a football at i
ort. The kid is having a rough i
ne trying to fill Jimmy Brown's
oes.
Boots Erb, who is well named, also !
s in at second and does con
bute a couple of boots during the
ne he's there. He gets on base a
, but his hitting has been far |
3m sensational.
Jim Fiscalini, brother of John,
es the catching. He is about on a I
r with Stanford's number one re
.ver, Frank McGraw. Both pack <
tot of power.

Next Saturday the Indians' varsity baseball team will invade the

The Bear was severely wounded when five of his first string
layers were unable to don Cal uniforms this year. Four of these

Jinny Ramos, died following an

Next Saturday the Indians' varsity baseball team will invade the
ir of the snarling California Bear, at present the holder of the Na-
Dnal Collegiate Baseball Championship.
The Bear was severely wounded when five of his first string
layers were unable to don Cal uniforms this year. Four of these

a,vers, Virg Butler, Dick Larner,
ic-kie Jensen, and Jimmy Brown,
ere declared ineligible for further
ay this year. Butler, Lamer, and
rown immediately withdrew from
•liool and signed professional con
acts.
The fifth player, second-baseman
Jinny Ramos, died following an
ltomobile accident.
Although injured, the Bear is still
and shows signs of wanting
• retain the pennant for 1948. Last
•ar the Indians almost pushed the
oars out of the running with a sur
ising victory, and the Bears are
ell aware of their opponent's im
essive record in play so far this
>ar.
Coach Clint Evans probably has
ie strongest outfield in the CIBA
rcuit, with the possible exception
use.
ISCAI INI SLUGGER
"Big John" Fiscalini patrols left—
•Id and does it fairly well, but he
known much better for his hitting
)iJily. Last year the '"big one" led
e league in that department. It
as "Big John" who parked one of
ojan hurler Wally Hood's pitches
r er the wall to win tho play-off
ime for the championship. It was
so "Big John" who singled in the
nth inning against Texas t'> keep
e Bears in the running for the
itional title.
His running mate in center is Lyle
timer, a .377 hitter, who is unques
jnably the best lead-off man and
ise-runner in the loop. Cliff Mc- j
ain is the weakest hitting out
>lder, hitting a measly .34(5 last
ason.
Stanford's outfield of Nell, Nava,
id Dingfelder can probably hold
> against their opponents as far .
fielding is concerned, but Lloyd
erirman's hitting could still be
ed.
In fact, fielding seems to be the
ide of the Stanfrod infield, too. |
11 Arce, who turned in a nice 1
lassisted double play against
CLA, is as good as they come,
lortstop Brownson has had plenty I
experience in fielding.
On the other side of second, not
uch gets by Mr. Bobby Peters
ther. At first base Coach Wolter
obably wishes he could combine j
>nny Cardinalli's hitting with
larlie Cole's fielding, but both do
1 right in either department.
EAR FIELDING WEAK
On the other hand, the Bear's in
id appears to be somewhat like a
■ve.
Second baseman Tim Cronin
esn't play as Joe used to, and
manages to contribute a couple i
errors per game. His stick work
s not been too bad. and there is
.vays room for improvement.
Jerry Silverstein also kicks the
rsehide around like a football at i
ort. The kid is having a rough i
ne trying to fill Jimmy Brown's
oes.
Boots Erb, who is well named, also !
s in at second and does con
bute a couple of boots during the
ne he's there. He gets on base a
, but his hitting has been far |
3m sensational.
Jim Fiscalini, brother of John,
es the catching. He is about on a I
r with Stanford's number one re
.ver, Frank McGraw. Both pack <
tot of power.
