After the NCAA championships
held in the University of Michigan
pool last weekend, four members of
Stanford's varsity swimming team,
accompanied by Coach Tom Haynie,
went on to New Haven. Connecticut,
where they will enter the National
AAU meet this week.
The Stanford entries will be Bob
Anderson. Ralph Sala. Don Hester,
and Jack Weeden.
Anderson won the NCAA 50-yard
sprint title at Ann Arbor last week,
and will be the favorite to annex the
American AAU crown.
Weeden placed fifth in the NCAA
backstroke competition, while Sala
was fifth in the grueling 1.500-yard
NCAA distance swim.
Breaststroker Don Hester teamed
up with Anderson and Weeden to
bring Stanford a second place in the
300-yard medley relay competition.
The field for the AAU meet will
include nearly all the outstanding
college swimmers as well as the na
tion's top athletic club and inde
pendent performers.
