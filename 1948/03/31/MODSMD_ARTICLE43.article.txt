SACRAMENTO, March 30 (UP).
—The pennant-favored San Fran
cisco ' Seals slugged three Sacra
mento pitchers for 1(5 hits to whip
the Solons, 7-4, in the 1948 Pacific-
Coast League opener here today. A
record - breaking crowd of 14.000
fans attended the game.
With veteran infielder Hugh Luby
clouting a home run and two sin
gles to lead the attack, the Seals
pushed across three runs in the first
stanza, added two in the fourth, and
one each in the sixth and eighth to
clinch the contest.
The game got under way in a
barrage of fireworks. After Gov.
Earl Warren had tossed out the first
ball, Manager Lefty O'Doul of the
Seals announced he would play the
game under protest because of the
overflow crowd standing in the out
field.
Sacramento tied it up in the bot
tom of the third as the Solon batters
got to pitcher Jack Brewer for four
hits. First baseman Babe Dahlgren
doubled into the crowd in left cen
ter; Salveson lined a single through
center; and shortstop Leo Wells fol
lowed with a double into the crowd
at left.
