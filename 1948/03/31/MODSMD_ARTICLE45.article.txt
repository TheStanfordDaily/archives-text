# Six join Frosh Baseball Team
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball
team has been strengthened this
quarter by the addition of six new
men. Two of the better prospects
are Dick Clegg and Bill Herron,
who spent last quarter in frosh bas
ketball uniforms.
Four other new players also
signed up, but Bushong has not had
enough time to get a line on their
abilities. Bushong was disappointed

that none of the six new men are
pitchers. He was expecting some
! relief for his small, overworked
> staff.
However, pitchers Lloyd West
phal ant! Denny Tuffanelli are back.
11 they can get enough rest between
! games, they will continue to win.
The rest of the team is strong and
! the new additions will give the frosh
the needed reserves.
