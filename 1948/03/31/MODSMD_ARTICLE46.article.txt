# Blizzard Halts Mountaineers' Try at Middle Palisade Peak
## 
### 
Four members of the Stanford Alpine Club attempted to
climb Middle Palisades Peak during Spring vacation, but were
turned back by a three-day blizzard. The 14,049-foot peak near
Big Pine has never been climbed in winter—and the Stanford
mountaineers learned the reason why.
The climbers, Ulf Ramm-Ericson, Larry Taylor, Dave Harrah,

and Bill Kershaw, started up Big'
Pine Creek. Sunday morning. March
21. Weather was clear and warm,
with freshly-fallen snow on the
ground. However, heavy packs, al
titude, snow and rocks cut the expe
dition's progress to about four miles
a day.
On the second day the party pro
ceeded to Middle Palisade Glacier,
in spite of threatening weather.
They were weathered in on Tues
day, but hoped for suitable condi
tions the following day in order to
climb the last 2,000 feet of rock and
ice. But snow began to fall in the
evening, and over three feet of it
caved in the tent walls during the
night.
When the weather showed no
signs of clearing the group decided
to return to civilization. Cold and
fatigue forced a halt at noon and
they had to spend another night
on the windy mountain before
making their way through heavy
snow to Glacier Lodge.
Ramm-Ericson and Taylor said
they are ready to try again—when [
the snow is not quite so deep. !
Ramm-Ericson was a member of a !
Stan fro rd-California expedition
which last summer climbed and ex
plored virgin areas in the Tiedeman
Glacier area of British Columbia.
