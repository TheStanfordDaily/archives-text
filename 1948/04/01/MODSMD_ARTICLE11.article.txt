# San Jose State College Wins Praise for Tragedy, 'Medea'
## 
### 
Roxana Hildreth and Dorothy,
Lyon carried college drama to new j
achievement last evening with their j
performances in Euripides' great j
tragedy. "Medea."
Playing the role of the nurse to |
Medea in the San Jose State College |
production. Mis Hildreth showed a !
wonderful, terrible weariness over j
the fate of her doomed mistress, j
Miss Hildreth's voice was quiet and
restrained with undertones of great j
depth.
Miss Lyon gave a powerful per
formance as Medea. With less skill
ful handling, the role would have
degenerated into pure histrionics.
The direction of the play could have
called for a little less running about
the stage, which was often con
fusing to the audience; but the fault
did not lie with Miss Lyon.
The male members of the cast 1
were less effective. John Calder
wood as Jason had a tendency to
simper, which tended to strip the
character of any semblance of dig
nity.
Donald Holladay and James For
."ter, portraying respectively Aegeus,
King of Athens, and Kreon, Kign
of Corinth, added too youthful a
flavor to their characterizations to
be truly convincing.

, Stark settings and lighting showed
I how important proper backgrounds
are to the success of a play. The
| lighting, especially, conceived by
1 Barbara Baumann, followed Medea
! closely in the "pride and torment
J of her soul." —LAWRENCE.
