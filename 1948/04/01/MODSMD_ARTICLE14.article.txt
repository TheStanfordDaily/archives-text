### 
TOKYO. March 31 (UP).â€”Allied
' headquarters issued its most sweep
ing ban on strikes today, but about
100,000 communications workers in
eight prefectures remained idle in a
demand for higher pay.
Headquarters issued the new or
ders shortly after it was reported a
compromise proposal had been
made between the government and
its workers.
i The orders, issued by Maj. Gen.
William Marquat, chief of the Eco
! nomic and Scientific Section, out
lawed "systematic" regional strikes,
' which have been staged by tele
phone, telegraph, and postal em
ployees.
Union leaders devised the re
gional strike system after head
quarters banned nationwide strikes.
In this manner, workers in one sec
tion would strike for 24 hours, then
j return to work while workers in
1 another section walked out.
