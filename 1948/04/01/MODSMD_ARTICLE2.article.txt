ROME, March 31 (UP). — A
Communist rally turned into a
pro - American demonstration today
when Palmiro Togliatti, Italy's
Communist chieftain, was booed
and shouted down by cries of "Long
live the United States."
Togliatti was addressing 20,000
people at a Communist - left wing
Socialist election rally at Lecce, in
the heel of the Italian boot. He de
nounced American aid to Italy and
exalted the possibility that Russia
might send Italy wheat.
Boos and catcalls forced Togliatti
to be silent for five minutes, during
which anti - Communists shouted
praise of the United States. Then
the anti-Communists marched off in
a body, continuing their cries of
"Long live America," leaving To
gliatti to finish his speech to only
a few remaining Communists and
leftist Socialists.
Premier Alcide de Gasperi, ad
dressing 50.000 people at Cagliaria,
taunted Togliatti with the prospect
of a government victory in the April
18 election.
"Let Togliatti be calm and not
worry," the Premier said, "because
he will have to be preoccupied with
the result of a victory for the gov
ernment bloc."
The Communists and left wing
Socialists demanded angrily today
that the government stop a flood of
letters from Italians in the United
States urging relatives and friends
to vote against the Communists in
the April 18 election.
The election committee at once
turned down the protest on the
ground that it was not concerned
with what Americans might write to
Italian relatives.
