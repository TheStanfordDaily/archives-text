# Steelman Rumored 'Talking' With Lewis, Mine Operators
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP)—
John R. Steelman, President Tru
man's economic advisor, was re
ported tonight to have talked to
John L. Lewis and "captive" coal
mine operators on the possibility of
arranging a settlement of the 17-
day-old mine strike.
The reports were circulated by in
dustry sources. Neither Steelman
nor Lewis would comment.
Steelman's reported intervention
apparently explained Mr. Truman's
unexpected delay in seeking a fed
eral court injunction to halt the
strike.
The President's fact-finding board
heaped most of the blame for the
walkout on Lewis, and Mr. Truman
had been expected to invoke the
injunction section of the Taft-
Hartley Act immediately on receiv
ing its report. But he stayed his
hand—to the surprise of Lewis, the
soft coal operators and his own fact
finders.
Industry sources reported several
hours later that Steelman had been
in touch wth at least one soft coal
producer and other industry officials,
including operators of "captive"
mines owned by steel companies
and railroads.
Among those named specifically
was George A. Humphries, presi
dent of the Pittsburgh Consolidation
Coal Co., the world's largest com
mercial coal producer.
