NANKING, March 31 (UP) â€”
Three key Shantung Peninsula ports
! won last summer after bloody bat
tles will be abandoned by Nation
! alist forces, a government military
spokesman announced today.
The spokesman, Teng Wen-Yi,
j said the ports would be given up
i "to achieve greater concentration
| and mobility against the rebels." It
was understood government troops
J would be withdrawn to reinforce
Mukden and other towns in com
munist-besieged Manchuria.
Teng said the ports of Lungkow,
Penglai, aid Weihaiwei would be
abandoned, but the chief port of
Chefoo would be retained.
Government spokesmen claimed
last summer that the communists
lost 50.000 troops in dead, wounded,
and captured trying to defend Peng
lai and Weihaiwei and they ad
mitted heavy Nationalist casualties.
Teng's announcements coincided
! with a communist radio broadcast
j claiming the recovery of Yenan "and
the liberation of the northwest is
not far off."
The broadcast indicated the com
munists were massing for new
thrusts in the northwest. Pro-gov
ernment reports yesterday said Na
tionalist troops had pushed the com
munists back from the Peiping-
Suiyuan Railway in Chahar Prov
ince, but the broadcast indicated
the reds might have swung south.
