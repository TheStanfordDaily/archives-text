## Partisan, Political Death 
### 
Stanford is not the only campus where minority organizations
and "liberals" are not allowed to meet. A few weeks ago the
UCLA Daily Bruin said in a front page editorial:
"Such discussion (on political questions) is forbidden by an
11-paragraph document known starkly as University Regulation
17, which denies the use of university facilities 'for partisan,
political, or sectarian religious purposes'."
Sounds like Stanford, doesn't it? The Bruin goes on to say:
"The regulation gives to the head of the university board—
end, we believe, dangerous —power to determine who may
speak on university grounds and who may utilize campus
facilities. For while political and religious activity is verboten
(a fearful word!), the definition of these terms is in the hands of
the university president. . . .
"The record shows that this provision of the regulation is
subject to varying and inconsistent rigidity of interpretation."
Furthermore, the Bruin quotes the state constitution: "The
University shall be entirely independent of all political or sec
tarian influence . . and declares:
"For the term 'political or sectarian influence' can easily and
logically be construed to mean political or sectarian bias in
iavor of certain groups, and nothing more."
Bear in mind that these restrictions apply to a state university
supported by pubic funds, whereas Stanford of course is a
private institution, or rather a private business run by a Board
cf Trustees and an administrative staff.
The Bruin asks that UCLA's "iron-curtain" regulation be revised
to allow public officials to talk on campus and thereby stimu
late student thought and to grant the use of campus facilities to
student political and religious groups. Such a move would tend
to fulfill a university's primary function —"the forging of citizens
and the probing of truth"—they say. The object of our educa
tional system is to prepare students for a useful role in society
is the way the Bruin puts it.
UCLA students have a long fight ahead. For in order to change
regulation 17, the University Board of Regents, and the state
legislature will have to be convinced and the state constitution
probably amended. That's difficult even with a powerful lobby.
It looks as though the "winds of freedom" will remain
calmed at Westwood, too.
