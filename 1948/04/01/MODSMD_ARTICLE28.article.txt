# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Democratic Fear 
### 
To the Editor:
I enjoyed reading the article entitled Political Maturity. I am one
of those who believe in democracy, and faith in the basic common sense
of the mass of individuals can only survive if enough people actually
»dhere to that belief.
We shouldn't cry about democracy, in my opinion, and yet consider
it only in its superficial forms. Restricting youth movements or organ
izations is exactly an acknowledgment of lack of faith in the motives
and. ideas of youth.
Perhaps we should stop using the term "democracy"' as a shield for
self-justification or pride and find out just what makes us fear losing
our opinions through introduction of "rebel"' thought. When we are
afraid of having our opinion.Vc'hanged. then we are afraid of ourselves.
And if we are afraid of ourselves, then we don't really believe in the
innate wisdom and common sense of the individual. If that is the case,
let's come out in the open anH'.«ay so. Perhaps we will find the problem
of insecurity and fear and lack of faith in democracy is a very vital
personal one. We can then begin revitalizing democracy by working at its
source —the individual, and try to rediscover some of the values lost in our
over-emphasis on material democracy and material life.
-I fully believe democracy can survive only if we as individuals learn
to absorb new ideas or concepts and to sift out the chaff instead of
setting up barriers of fear and pride on the assumption that those
ideas will harm us. I'm all for PCA, Students for Wallace, or any organ
ization that can be formed.
