Atomic Lend-Lease
PARIS (UP) â€”French atomic scientists will share
their discoveries with the entire world, according
to members of ihis country's Atomic Energy Com
mission.
Commission officials said the French government
refuses to maintain any sort of secrecy, except on
matters learned by French scientists working with
Canadians and British on atomic energy research
during the war. Secrecy "does more harm than
good," a spokesman told the United Press.
He admitted that to date France's work on ap
plication of atomic energy has been "modest."
France is still in the process of constructing her
first atomic pile at her "Oak Ridge," located at
Fort du Chatillon, near Paris.
"But it is men, materials, and money, in that
order, which count in atomic energy," the spokes
man said. France "certainly has the men," he added.
Chairman of the commission is Communist Fred
eric Joliot-Curie. His wife, Irene, is a member.
Before the war they won a Nobel prize for their
discovery of artificial radio-activity. Joliot-Curie
has always followed a "no secrecy" policy, even
when secrecy was suggested to him by American
officials on the eve of the war.
Another commission member, Pierre Auger,
worked in Canada during the war on research for
the atomic bomb. With three colleagues, he has
just identified a new particle in the cosmic rays
which fall upon the earth from outside its surface.
Joliot-Curie described the discovery as opening up
"tremendous possibilities" in the field of nuclear
physics.
Because America is currently buying almost all
uranium, France is training young scientists and
developing instruments of detection to search for
that material in her territories. Teams of experts
will scour France and her remote possessions.
France's atomic energy research is purely non
military and "will stay that way," officials said.
Commission headquarters, on one of the city's most
beautiful avenues, contrast strangely with the
heavily-guarded headquarters of the American
Atomic Energy Commission in Washington. There
are no police, no doors marked secret, and visitors
are shown in as they would be in any other govern
ment office.
