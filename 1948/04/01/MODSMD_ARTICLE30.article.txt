WASHINGTON (UP) —The army says scientists
are as essential to the national security as soldiers,
sailors and airmen.
In a talk prepared for delivery by commanding
officers to troops, all over the world, entitled "Why
Research and Development?" the army listed the
great advances of science in World War 11.
They were: the atomic bomb, radar, penicillin,
DDT. the proximity fuse and submarine detec
tion devices.
"In the war of the future the decision may well go
to that nation whose research, development and
industrial efforts produce new and better offensive
weapons as well as counter-measures against the
offensive weapons of enemies," the army said.
"Should the United States ever be forced to
fight another. World War. it is certain that the
scientist will play an even more important role
than in World War II."
The army said the United States now faces the
task of maintaining its enviable position in research
against the challenge of other powers.
It warned that the task is not only a military
responsibility but a "national responsibility."
"An adequate program of research and develop
ment in time of peace must be the joint effect of
our educational institutions," the army said.
It said the primary need is in basic research. That
formerly has been done mostly in France, Germany,
Italy, Denmark, and England. War-time dislocations

and destruction have cut their capacity, the army
reported.
The army deplored a shortage of scientists, esti
mated at 90.0(10 bachelors and 5.000 doctors of
science, It said 15.000 additional science doctors
arc needed.
The army contended that the government, indi
viduals, and industry must provide more oppor
tunities for scientists to work.
The armed forces' I!M7 appropriation for research
and development amounts to four-fifths of the total
spent by the government, exclusive of atomic
energy, the army estimated.
The army listed key research programs as im
proved aircraft, long and short-range guided missiles,
anti-submarine devices, improved aircraft carriers,
better radar and radio, and new drugs to fight disease.
