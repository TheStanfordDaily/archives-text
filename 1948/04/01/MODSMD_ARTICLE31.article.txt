## History 1948 
### 
Today the people of this country face a choice of
whether we will allow communism to spread through
one country after another, or whether we will hold
the line by supporting the Marshall Plan to keep
Europe from economic chaos and being ultimately
subject to communist domination.
Some people object to the Marshall proposal on the
basis of its cost, overlooking the fact that it is
less than one-twentieth of what the second World
War cost us, its annual cost being only about two
and a half per cent of our annual income.
Some object to the Marshall Plan because they
fear the effect on food prices in this country. They
fail to recognize that only the smaller part of the
plan calls for food and that the amount of food
involved is less than is annually wasted here.
Some object to the plan lest it increase inflation,
overlooking the fact that our export trade has de
clined since June due to the exhaustion of the dollar
exchange. Only the Marshall Plan can prevent such
a decline in our exports as might seriously affect
our industrial activity.
Some argue that there is no real danger of Italy
and France going communist, because the majority
of the people are anti-communist. They forget that
only three hundred thousand Bolsheviks upset the
Kerensky government in Russia.
And finally, some object to the Marshall Plan be
cause they are critical of the present British govern
ment, and believe that by refusing aid in this grave
crisis they can force a change. The fact is that the
Labor majority in Parliament is so great that it is
unlikely to be upset by anything short of complete
economic collapse.
Great Britain is the only nation wnich is helping
us substantially in our effort to withstand Russian
aggression. There are British troops in Germany,
in Greece, and in the Middle East. If they are with
drawn because of the British economic difficulties,
we will either have to take over with our troops or
perhaps lose the Ruhr and Middle East by default.
The oil reserves in Arabia alone are greater than
all the oil reserves in the United States, and whoever
controls the Middle East is likely to control the
world because it controls the land-bridge between
Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Our choice is simpleâ€”either we must undertake
the cost of the Marshall Plan or pay the much
greater cost of a European collapse.
