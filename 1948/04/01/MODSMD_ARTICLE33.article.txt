## Bull Session 
### 
I'm one of the few people who know that Reginald
Shultz was the first man to go over Niagara Falls
in a beer bottle. Reginald was a midget. No one
cares except Reginald and myself—l think it's re
markable.
* * *
Inflation notes. The Guatemalan Quetzal is now
only worth four Kroons. Think of that before you
start complaining about the price of butter.
* * *
According to an early 1946 survey, there are 21
establishments from Five Points to Stanford that sell
intoxicating beverages. This includes one real estate
office that dispenses beer.
* * *
A man was sent out to check on the number of
"speakeasies" between Stanford and Mountain View
He left in 15)46 and has not yet returned.
It has been deduced that the location of Stanford
University has had an influence in increasing the
number of liquoratoriums.
* * *fc
It's nice to know that I attend an institution that
has played a part in developing such a cultural area
which might otherwise be barren highway.
# * *
Was trying to stimulate a discussion in the Daily
Shack over whom people would vote for in November
if the candidates were Wallace and Mac Arthur. One
far-sighted voter said he'd try Norman Thomas.

Rumor has it that Harry Truman will run for gov
ernor of Missouri in November.

Why is it that the only items you remember from
a course once the quarter is over are either the things
you knew lhat no one else knew, or the things that
everyone else knew and you didn't?

Here are some things I'd like to have cleared up
about elevators:
Why do tlley always close the door just as I am
about to enter?
Why do you have to face the front of the car?
Why does my voice always crack when I give my
floor number?
Why does the fat lady at the back of the car
always get ofT at the second floor?
Do they buy uniforms to fit the operators or do
they hire operators to fit the uniforms?
Whether or not I should leave the car immediately
alter burning a hole in the large man's gabardine
suit with my cigaret?
Why don't operators flip their lids just riding up
and down all day long?

All classes in the Poly Sci. Econ, and History De
partments have been canceled for today, according
to a phone call that came into the Daily last night.
I might also mention that today is April 1.

All classes in the Poly Sci. Econ, and History De
partments have been canceled for today, according
to a phone call that came into the Daily last night.
I might also mention that today is April 1.
I'm one of the few people who know that Reginald
Shultz was the first man to go over Niagara Falls
in a beer bottle. Reginald was a midget. No one
cares except Reginald and myself—l think it's re
markable.

Inflation notes. The Guatemalan Quetzal is now
only worth four Kroons. Think of that before you
start complaining about the price of butter.

According to an early 1946 survey, there are 21
establishments from Five Points to Stanford that sell
intoxicating beverages. This includes one real estate
office that dispenses beer.

A man was sent out to check on the number of
"speakeasies" between Stanford and Mountain View
He left in 15)46 and has not yet returned.
It has been deduced that the location of Stanford
University has had an influence in increasing the
number of liquoratoriums.

It's nice to know that I attend an institution that
has played a part in developing such a cultural area
which might otherwise be barren highway.

Was trying to stimulate a discussion in the Daily
Shack over whom people would vote for in November
if the candidates were Wallace and Mac Arthur. One
far-sighted voter said he'd try Norman Thomas.

Rumor has it that Harry Truman will run for gov
ernor of Missouri in November.

Why is it that the only items you remember from
a course once the quarter is over are either the things

Here are some things I'd like to have cleared up
about elevators:
Why do tlley always close the door just as I am
about to enter?
Why do you have to face the front of the car?
Why does my voice always crack when I give my
floor number?
Why does the fat lady at the back of the car
always get ofT at the second floor?
Do they buy uniforms to fit the operators or do
they hire operators to fit the uniforms?
Whether or not I should leave the car immediately
alter burning a hole in the large man's gabardine
suit with my cigaret?
Why don't operators flip their lids just riding up
and down all day long?
