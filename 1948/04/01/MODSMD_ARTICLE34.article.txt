# Menlo Park's Guild Theater Presents 'This Happy Breed'
## 
### 
Can "literary" films succeed finan-i
. ially? Hollywood says they can't, j
The Guild Theater in Menlo Park,
however, opened Tuesday night to
satisfy what they felt was a demand j
on the Peninsula for the "finest in
cinema art." To find this art, they i
have turned to foreign films, mainly
British. French, and Italian.
THIS NEW THEATER will be an
interesting experiment in current
popular taste. It will tell whether
there are enough people who regard
movies as a form of literature ca
pable of great heights or whether
lovies are still expected to be es- j
rapist trash.
The Guild made a fine opening l
choice with the dependable pair of
.7. Arthur Rank and Noel Coward
combining on "This Happy Breed.
The "breed" is a very normal
London family pictured from 1919
to 1939. The movie consists of a sc
ries of very normal problems faced
by this very normal family in very
abnormal times.
AT FIRST, these scenes appear
clull and disconnected. Normal peo
ple are rarely interesting. But these j
disconnected scenes join to form a |
panorama of human life and human j
history. The situations of World ;
War I post-war exuberance, a gen
*ral strike, and the rise of condi- i
tions that brought on another war |
become the background for the i
common problems of an aging j
couple and their maturing children. j
The very commonness of these uni
versal problems binds the movie to
its audience.
Celia Johnson, star of "Brief En
counter," accurately portrays the
happy woman transformed into a
lousehold drudge, but she is out
,-hone by Robert Newton, who plays
staunch, middle-class Englishman
with a touch of sentimentality.
TIIE APPEARANCE of the Guild
Theater deserves mention, for it
calls itself the luxury "Theater of
Distinction." Modernistic surround
ings, adjustable chairs, and enough
'.ieht to write or read by are fine.
Unfortunately, the Guild has added
luxury prices to its atmosphere,
which will eliminate its greatest po
tential audience on the Farm. A
price reduction for Stanford stu
ents. however, is being considered.
