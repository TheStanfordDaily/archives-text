## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Wliile most Stanford students were
home enjoying their spring vaca
tion, the varsity track squad was
working hai d to prepare for the
coming '43 cinder season under the
j direction of Coach Jack Weiershau-
NT.
1 lie next varsity meet is April 10
with San Jose State, who surprised
Ihe Cards with a 78-53 victory last
; year.
However the Indians hope to turn
the tables this year. With only a
few men gone from last year's var
sity, great improvement is in the
making.
FOUR MEN GONE
The Cards have lost Frank Ga
nahl and Gordy Johnson in the dis
tances, C plain A 1 Snyder in the
hurdles, Don Campbell in the
pole vault.
In the dashes the Indians seem
fairly strong this year. Bob Wood,
who already has been clocked at 10
flat, appears to be the best 100 man.
Both he and Terry Maxwell are
fighting it out in the 220 at around
22 seconds. Other dash men in
clude Bill Smith, veteran of last
year's squad, Gordy Levy, and Bud
Richter.
RELAY TEAM BACK
In the quarter-mile all four men
of Stanford's 3:10 relay team of '47
are back. Larry HofT and Terry
Maxwell have hit 50.3 already, and
Pitch Johnson, A 1 Wilkins, and Al
Hoiu bar are improving faset. Bob
Mclnerney and George Grimes will
probably run the relay.
The Indians have five veterans in
the 880 —George Grimes, Al Holu
bar, Berny Wagner, Ted OfT. and
Dick Meluler. Wagner has broken
two minutes this season, while

Grimes and Holubar are just begin
ning to hit their strdie.
A 1 Lyons and Jose Rael have been
doing most of the Farm's distance
work. Both men are sophomores,
and are much stronger this year.
Rael is constantly hitting around 10
minutes in the two-mile, while Ly
ons is concentrating mostly on the
mile.
FIVE HURDLERS
Stanford is much stronger in the
hurdles. West Coast Relays champ

Downing McKee lias already broken
15 seconds in the highs. Veterans
Dell Russell and Skip Kent, 14.8
men last year, are very close. Gay
Bryan and Bill Smith have been
coming along last.
In the field events, the Cards are
strongest in the' shot. Soph Otis
Chandler, who has been sensational
in spring practice, has several marks
around 52 feet. Able support is be
ing given by Steve McKee, Norm
Nourse, Verne Purcell, and Judge
Finley.
McKee leads the squad in the
discus with a 146-ft. heave. Gene
Mathias, Da!ton Paxman, and Judge
Finley stil! need plenty of work and
development.
In the pole vault Bill Larson and
Marty Anderson appear to be on
their way to a good season. Both
are around 13 feet.
WEAK IN lIIGII JUMP
The high jump still seems to be
the Indians' weak point. Gay Bryan,
who placed third in the Big Meet
last year, will be back this year
I along with Bob Ghilotti and Don
Auxier.
Fred Fank, who has hit 22 ft. 4'->
I in.; Gay Bryan, who recently
I jumped 228 ft. lO'/a in.; and the In
dians' leading broad jump candi
[ dates, Mike Durket and Gus Cha
! valas, both out from basketball, also
j will compete.
In the javelin the Cards appear
j very strong. Bud Held, who threw
: 212 ft. 10 in. in the West Coast Re
! lays last year, may really go places.
He recently threw an unofficial toss
j of 226 feet with a strong wind be
hind him. Wind or no wind, this is
j the best recorded throw in Stanford
| history. He has recorded another
J heave of 196 feet, Chuck Coker and
Scott Goldsborough are both strong
! this year.


OTIS CHANDLER is expected to
carry the Farm's hopes in the shot
I ut events this year. His best ef
fort to date is 51 ft. 11 in. and
Coach Weiersliauser expects this
mark to advance during the track
season.

22 seconds. Other dash men in
clude Bill Smith, veteran of last
year's squad, Gordy Levy, and Bud
Richter.
RELAY TEAM BACK
In the quarter-mile all four men
of Stanford's 3:10 relay team of '47
are back. Larry HofT and Terry
Maxwell have hit 50.3 already, and
Pitch Johnson, A 1 Wilkins, and Al
Hoiu bar are improving faset. Bob
Mclnerney and George Grimes will
probably run the relay.
The Indians have five veterans in
the 880 —George Grimes, Al Holu
bar, Berny Wagner, Ted OfT. and
Dick Meluler. Wagner has broken
two minutes this season, while

Grimes and Holubar are just begin
ning to hit their strdie.
A 1 Lyons and Jose Rael have been
doing most of the Farm's distance
work. Both men are sophomores,
and are much stronger this year.
Rael is constantly hitting around 10
minutes in the two-mile, while Ly
ons is concentrating mostly on the
mile.
FIVE HURDLERS
Stanford is much stronger in the
hurdles. West Coast Relays champ

Downing McKee lias already broken
15 seconds in the highs. Veterans
Dell Russell and Skip Kent, 14.8
men last year, are very close. Gay
Bryan and Bill Smith have been
coming along last.
In the field events, the Cards are
strongest in the' shot. Soph Otis
Chandler, who has been sensational
in spring practice, has several marks
around 52 feet. Able support is be
ing given by Steve McKee, Norm
Nourse, Verne Purcell, and Judge
Finley.
McKee leads the squad in the
discus with a 146-ft. heave. Gene
Mathias, Da!ton Paxman, and Judge
Finley stil! need plenty of work and
development.
In the pole vault Bill Larson and
Marty Anderson appear to be on
their way to a good season. Both
are around 13 feet.
WEAK IN lIIGII JUMP
The high jump still seems to be
the Indians' weak point. Gay Bryan,
who placed third in the Big Meet
last year, will be back this year
I along with Bob Ghilotti and Don
Auxier.
Fred Fank, who has hit 22 ft. 4'->
I in.; Gay Bryan, who recently
I jumped 228 ft. lO'/a in.; and the In
dians' leading broad jump candi
[ dates, Mike Durket and Gus Cha
! valas, both out from basketball, also
j will compete.
In the javelin the Cards appear
j very strong. Bud Held, who threw
: 212 ft. 10 in. in the West Coast Re
! lays last year, may really go places.
He recently threw an unofficial toss
j of 226 feet with a strong wind be
hind him. Wind or no wind, this is
j the best recorded throw in Stanford
| history. He has recorded another
J heave of 196 feet, Chuck Coker and
Scott Goldsborough are both strong
! this year.


OTIS CHANDLER is expected to
carry the Farm's hopes in the shot
I ut events this year. His best ef
fort to date is 51 ft. 11 in. and
Coach Weiersliauser expects this
mark to advance during the track
season.
Wliile most Stanford students were
home enjoying their spring vaca
tion, the varsity track squad was
working hai d to prepare for the
coming '43 cinder season under the
j direction of Coach Jack Weiershau-
NT.
1 lie next varsity meet is April 10
with San Jose State, who surprised
Ihe Cards with a 78-53 victory last
; year.
However the Indians hope to turn
the tables this year. With only a
few men gone from last year's var
sity, great improvement is in the
making.
FOUR MEN GONE
The Cards have lost Frank Ga
nahl and Gordy Johnson in the dis
tances, C plain A 1 Snyder in the
hurdles, Don Campbell in the
pole vault.
In the dashes the Indians seem
fairly strong this year. Bob Wood,
who already has been clocked at 10
flat, appears to be the best 100 man.
Both he and Terry Maxwell are
fighting it out in the 220 at around
22 seconds. Other dash men in

ons is concentrating mostly on the
mile.
FIVE HURDLERS
Stanford is much stronger in the
hurdles. West Coast Relays champ

Downing McKee lias already broken
15 seconds in the highs. Veterans
Dell Russell and Skip Kent, 14.8
men last year, are very close. Gay
Bryan and Bill Smith have been
coming along last.
In the field events, the Cards are
strongest in the' shot. Soph Otis
Chandler, who has been sensational
in spring practice, has several marks
around 52 feet. Able support is be
ing given by Steve McKee, Norm
Nourse, Verne Purcell, and Judge
Finley.
McKee leads the squad in the
discus with a 146-ft. heave. Gene
Mathias, Da!ton Paxman, and Judge
Finley stil! need plenty of work and
development.
In the pole vault Bill Larson and
Marty Anderson appear to be on
their way to a good season. Both
are around 13 feet.
WEAK IN lIIGII JUMP
The high jump still seems to be
the Indians' weak point. Gay Bryan,
who placed third in the Big Meet
last year, will be back this year
I along with Bob Ghilotti and Don
Auxier.
Fred Fank, who has hit 22 ft. 4'->
I in.; Gay Bryan, who recently
I jumped 228 ft. lO'/a in.; and the In
dians' leading broad jump candi
[ dates, Mike Durket and Gus Cha
! valas, both out from basketball, also
j will compete.
In the javelin the Cards appear
j very strong. Bud Held, who threw
: 212 ft. 10 in. in the West Coast Re
! lays last year, may really go places.
He recently threw an unofficial toss
j of 226 feet with a strong wind be
hind him. Wind or no wind, this is
j the best recorded throw in Stanford
| history. He has recorded another
J heave of 196 feet, Chuck Coker and
Scott Goldsborough are both strong
! this year.


OTIS CHANDLER is expected to
carry the Farm's hopes in the shot
I ut events this year. His best ef
fort to date is 51 ft. 11 in. and
Coach Weiersliauser expects this
mark to advance during the track
season.
