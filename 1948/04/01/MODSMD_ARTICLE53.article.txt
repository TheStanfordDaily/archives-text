# Indian Ballclub Preps For Cal Tilt Saturday
## 
### 
Getting ready for their im-+
portant clash with California on
Saturday, Stanford's varsity
baseballers tuned up Tuesday
night at Stockton by outlasting
College of Pacific, 8 to 7.
The Cards were given their first
taste of night ball, and seemed to
like it, as they led the Tigers all
the way.
Stanford will go up against Cal's i
defending national champions boast- \
ing a one-win and one-loss league
record, both contests being played in !
the south last week against UCLA.
BEARS WEAKER
California has appeared in only j
one league game, having run j
through St. Mary's, 25 to 7. Even so,
it is easy to see that Berkeley is
not in as good shape as last year, j
The Bears have been hurt by the
loss of ineligibies, and they are j
ragged in spots.
Stanford horsehide hopes are
higher now than in many past sea
sons. The Cards boast a classy in- j
Held and a hard-hitting outfield, but ;
a big question mark presents itself :
in the pitching department. If 1
Coach Harry Wolters can put to
gether a regular mound corps, the
Indians should continue to go
through their schedule winning a ;
good share of the games.
CONSISTENT WINNERS
So far, they have been very con
sistent in the win side of the ledger,
but both Cal and USC's giant-killing •
Trojans figure to be tough.
Flashy fielding Buck Brownson
at short, and Bill Arce at third form
a strong left-side combination. Both
Brownson and Arce were lauded for ;
their great defensive play against
UCLA.
Bob Peters at second, and Ciuick
Cole at first, round out the smooth
working infield unit. Their batting
averages have not been anything
special, but potentially they are cap
able of hitting at a more regular
clip.
Blasting Bob Nava, taking his cuts
from the cleanup spot, is leading
the Card power attack. Nava plays
left-field, but likes to swing his
war club better than patrolling the ,
field. He is batting .571 in league
competition.
Leadoff man Ted Nell and Clyde
Dingfelder are the other two regu
lar outfielders. Both are dependable '
batsmen.
Dave Dahle and John McGraw
will probably be the starting battery
for Stanford.

Coach Harry Wolters can put to
gether a regular mound corps, the
Indians should continue to go
through their schedule winning a ;
good share of the games.
CONSISTENT WINNERS
So far, they have been very con
sistent in the win side of the ledger,
but both Cal and USC's giant-killing •
Trojans figure to be tough.
Flashy fielding Buck Brownson
at short, and Bill Arce at third form
a strong left-side combination. Both
Brownson and Arce were lauded for ;
their great defensive play against
UCLA.
Bob Peters at second, and Ciuick
Cole at first, round out the smooth
working infield unit. Their batting
averages have not been anything
special, but potentially they are cap
able of hitting at a more regular
clip.
Blasting Bob Nava, taking his cuts
from the cleanup spot, is leading
the Card power attack. Nava plays
left-field, but likes to swing his
war club better than patrolling the ,
field. He is batting .571 in league
competition.
Leadoff man Ted Nell and Clyde
Dingfelder are the other two regu
lar outfielders. Both are dependable '
batsmen.
Dave Dahle and John McGraw
will probably be the starting battery
for Stanford.
Getting ready for their im-+
portant clash with California on
Saturday, Stanford's varsity
baseballers tuned up Tuesday
night at Stockton by outlasting
College of Pacific, 8 to 7.
The Cards were given their first
taste of night ball, and seemed to
like it, as they led the Tigers all
the way.
Stanford will go up against Cal's i
defending national champions boast- \
ing a one-win and one-loss league
record, both contests being played in !
the south last week against UCLA.
BEARS WEAKER
California has appeared in only j
one league game, having run j
through St. Mary's, 25 to 7. Even so,
it is easy to see that Berkeley is
not in as good shape as last year, j
The Bears have been hurt by the
loss of ineligibies, and they are j
ragged in spots.
Stanford horsehide hopes are
higher now than in many past sea
sons. The Cards boast a classy in- j
Held and a hard-hitting outfield, but ;
a big question mark presents itself :
in the pitching department. If 1
