LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y., March
31 (UP) —Chile asked the United
Nations Security Council today to
create a committee to sift all avail- [
able evidence on charges that Russia
manipulated the recent communist ,
seizure of power in Czechoslovakia, i
Chilean Delegate Hernan Santa
Cruz, in the first concrete sugges
tion for handling the bitterly
disputed Czech case, said this could
be a preliminary step to a full
fledged investigation of the alleged
Russian role.
Since Chile is a guest at the coun
cil table, its suggestion would have
to be introduced formally by a
council member if it is to be voted
on. The Western Powers were
known to be considering the idea.
There was a good possibility that
Russia would veto any such move
despite the charter provision that
parties to a dispute may not vote
on proposals for peaceful settlement.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko, '■
who has contended that the political
turnover in Prague was purely a
domestic affair, could use the double
veto—one to kill a move to deny
Rusisa a vote in the case and the
other to veto the proposal for an j
inquiry committee.
Santa Cruz accompanied his sug
gestion for an inquiry with a re- |
buttal to Rusisa's charge that Chile
acted as an American lackey in
bringing the case to the security I
council.
The Chilean diplomat vigorously j
asesrted that Chile acted on her own i
in sponsoring the charges against i
Russia which originally were made
by the dismissed Czech UN dele- j
gate, Dr. Jan Papanek.
In a 26-page speech, he accused j
Gromyko of having indulged in an j
"uncontrolled explosion of raw
bullyism" in branding Chile a tool
of American imperialists. He said I
Gromyko's explosion was "eloquent i
proof of the weakness of his posi- J
tion," and he castigated Soviet for- 1
egin policy as a policy of enslave- j
merit.
