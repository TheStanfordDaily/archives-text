WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP)—
The House today passed its 56.205,-
000.000 global foreign aid bill to
provide American arms, money and
reconstruction supplies for China
and Communist-threatened Europe.
The roll call vote was announced
as 329 to 74. It came after a motion
by Rep. Glen D Johnson. D.. Gkla.,
to send the bill back to the foreign
affairs committee was shouted down.
The legislation was sent to the
Senate where it faced almost certain
rejection because that body handled
the world-wide aid projects in sep
arate bills that differ in some maje:
aspects from the "single package'
House version.
Republican leaders were hopefu
that a compromise conference
agreement could be reached by this
weekend so a completed bill coula
be sent to President Truman for his
signature early next week.
The House bill, labelled by its
friends and foes as an anti-commu
nist "war measure," authorizes:
$5,300,000,000 for the first year of
a four-year recovery program in
which the 16 "Marshall Plan" coun
tries of Western Europe will par
ticipate. along with Trieste and
Western Germany. The House ver
sion also includes Franco Spain in
ERP, but strong Senate opposition
was expected to erase that addei
starter.
5570.000.000 for a 15-month aid
program in China, including $150,-
000,000 for military supplies ani
$420,000,000 of economic help.
$275,000,000 for military assist
ance to Greece and Turkey.
$6,000,000 for the United Nations
Children's Relief Fund.
House action came as President
Truman signed a bill carrying $55,-
000,000 of emergency relief funds to
Carry France. Italy, and Austria
until ERP goes into operation.
The ERP section, which adminis
tration leaders regard as the key
issue in the entile program, provides
a single aid administrator with
broad powers. Including authority
to forbid shipments of any poten
tially-valuable war materials to
Russia and her satellites.

Russia and her satellites.
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP)—
The House today passed its 56.205,-
000.000 global foreign aid bill to
provide American arms, money and
reconstruction supplies for China
and Communist-threatened Europe.
The roll call vote was announced
as 329 to 74. It came after a motion
by Rep. Glen D Johnson. D.. Gkla.,
to send the bill back to the foreign
affairs committee was shouted down.
The legislation was sent to the
Senate where it faced almost certain
rejection because that body handled
the world-wide aid projects in sep
arate bills that differ in some maje:
aspects from the "single package'
House version.
Republican leaders were hopefu
that a compromise conference
agreement could be reached by this
weekend so a completed bill coula
be sent to President Truman for his
signature early next week.
The House bill, labelled by its
friends and foes as an anti-commu
nist "war measure," authorizes:
$5,300,000,000 for the first year of
a four-year recovery program in
which the 16 "Marshall Plan" coun
tries of Western Europe will par
ticipate. along with Trieste and
Western Germany. The House ver
sion also includes Franco Spain in
ERP, but strong Senate opposition
was expected to erase that addei
starter.
5570.000.000 for a 15-month aid
program in China, including $150,-
000,000 for military supplies ani
$420,000,000 of economic help.
$275,000,000 for military assist
ance to Greece and Turkey.
$6,000,000 for the United Nations
Children's Relief Fund.
House action came as President
Truman signed a bill carrying $55,-
000,000 of emergency relief funds to
Carry France. Italy, and Austria
until ERP goes into operation.
The ERP section, which adminis
tration leaders regard as the key
issue in the entile program, provides
a single aid administrator with
broad powers. Including authority
to forbid shipments of any poten
tially-valuable war materials to
Russia and her satellites.
