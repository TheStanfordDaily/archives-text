If you're looking for a dinner You ought to get this straight . . .
And can't find it on the Farm; She's using you as bait!
If your waist is getting thinner,
Don't be filled with false alarm. An ideal man she has in mind:
You'll get calories and vitamins These qualities she hopes to find:
And surely be the "winner" . . . He calls for her at night
If you motor down Camino Without arriving tight;
And eat a LONGBARN dinner. He's at once upon his feet
p ret j Wheeler When she is there to greet.
Levis he does not don;
To The Stanford Man: Each day he uses a razor;
On The Stanford Woman When she has a new dress on,
You think that she lacks beauty; He doesn't neglect to praise her.
You say she has no charm;
You prefer a U.C. cuty So if this wins me a dinner,
To a "monster" from the Farm. Be prepared for what you'll see.
I'll invite a handsome Cal man
Well, to put you in your place, To dine at DINAH'S free!!!
In HER eyes YOU lack grace! —Nancy Stookey

If you don't, start beating your brains out for Eddie, whose address is
