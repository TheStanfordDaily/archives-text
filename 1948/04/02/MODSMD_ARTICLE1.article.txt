University of California has become the victim of what may prove to
be the most elaborate and successful hoax ever devised in college radio.
Associated Students of the University of California, on March 6, pos
sessed for a brief period of 30 minutes a wired wireless station similar to
Stanford's own KSU. And it was through the ''generosity and spirit of

co-operation"' of KSU that this Cal
station existed.
On March 5 the Daily Californian,
Cal's campus newspaper, printed an
article stating that "Byron" Phillips

KSU will present the recorded
"Tale of the Golden Bear" over
the public address system in the
Memorial Auditorium immediate
ly after the Sunday Evening Mov
ie. The program will be rebroad
cast over KSU. 880 kilocycles, at
10:30 Sunday evening.

from the radio station at UCLA

program called "The Tale of the
Golden Bear" at Stephens Union,
heart of the Cal campus, to ascer
tain student opinion on the pro
posed UC radio station. This station
was to be called '"KSUC," "The
Soul of the University of Califor
nia.''
'"BYRON'' PHILLIPS is none oth
er than Steve Phillips, manager of

! Stanford's station KSU, who had
I been plotting the hoax for the past

i Brown, and Jinni Law. Phillips led
his intrepid staff into Stephens Un

| The program which ensued con-
I sisted of interviews in which Cal
students were oriented on "their
new station," which they whole
' heartedly agreed was a "great idea."
i In fact, they agreed to vote money
from the ASUC budget to he'.p fi
nance "The Soul" of their Univer
sity.
CAL ST U D E X T S interviewed
proved to be so gullible that they
j swallowed a line of double - talk
I proving to be hilarious from the
Stanford point of view. In addition
to Stanford's Jack Brown, a Daily
; Californian photographer covered
the inaugural broadcast of "KSUC."
"The Tale of the Golden Bear,"
the program in which the Golden
Bear was swung by the tail, was a
! cultural gift from Cal's "admiring
student body" to the south. Unfor
j tunately, Cal has remained blithely
i unaware of the gift, and will remain
so until they read this article.
