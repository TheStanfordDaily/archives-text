# British Army Forces Russian Withdrawal From Berlin Station
## 
### 
BERLIN, April 1 (UP). â€”The Russians withdrew late tonight
from a control station they set up in the British sector of Berlin,
after 400 British troops, supported by nine armored cars, sur
rounded them on three sides.
The British victory in a new war of nerves came after a tense

day during which United States and
British army chieftains defied a vir
tual Soviet blockade of Berlin by
ordering their air forces to set up
emergency service for passengers
and freight between the capital and
their occupation zones.
IN ADDITION to demanding the
right to inspect all Allied railroad
and transport moving between Ber
lin and the western ocupation zones,
the Russians for two hours set up
road blocks along the boundary o.'
their zone in Berlin.
The Russians withdrew these
posts. But near the British Gatow
Air Field, the Russians suddenly
established a control station in what
the British said was their area.
THE BRITISH with their ar
mored cars moved in. They maneu
vered into position so as to cut the
Russians off on three sides. The
only path left open to the Russians
was a direct line of retreat back into
their own quarter.
Both groups had remained grimly
alert while the British commandant
demanded that the Russians with
draw and the Russians refused to do
so without orders from their high
command.
Flatly rejecting a Russian demand
to inspect railroad trains between
Berlin and the western occupation
zones, the American and British
commanders in chief canceled al
their train service. Motor transport,
also subject to Russian inspection,
was curtailed.
