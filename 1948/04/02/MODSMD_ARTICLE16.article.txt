# Lost and Found Department Moves Office from Mem Aud to Firehouse
## 
### 
"Make it easy for the person to
get his stuff back." That's the motto
of the new Lost and Found De
partment in the Firehouse. The old
Lost and Found offices in Mem Aud,
SAC, and the Cashier's office will j
still be open but all articles will
eventually wind up at the Fire
house.
The firemen have made this new ;
central Lost and Found office
cient. Records are kept of every ar
ticle turned in. The Firehouse is j
open 24 hours a clay. The men who
run this service want to make two j
requests of the student body:
1. Turn in articles to the Fire
house directly, not to a branch
office. It' this is done the rightful
owners can retrieve their goods
more quickly.
2. Remember, "finders keepers"

doesn't hold true until !Â»0 days
have elapsed. ll' you find an ar
ticle and turn it in, it must sta\
in Lost and Found !)0 days before
you can have it.
Don't be like the fellow who
turned in a Parker "51" and then
came in four times in the next two
weeks, each time complaining be
cause the firemen wouldn't let him
have it yet.
Lost and Found has a box full of
slide rules and glasses. But by far
its largest business is done in pens.
There are 77 pens and mechanical
penci's up at the Firehouse, includ
ing half a dozen Parker "51's."
One was turned in accompanied
by a note saying that it had been
lost by a coed in a gray skirt and a
greensweater. The other day a man
walked in and swore up and down
that that same pen was his.
