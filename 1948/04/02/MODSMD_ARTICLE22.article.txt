## Art in Our Time 
### 
If you don't do anything else today, go over to the Art
Gallery and spend half an hour at the student-faculty art exhibi
tion. You'll probably be surprised at the professional guality
of the work—as well as the very practical place that art has
in modern life.
The exhibition is more than the usual collection of pencil
sketches, water colors, and oils. The projects on architecture,
city planning, interior design, and automobile design are par
ticularly breathtaking. Especially the city planning. There in
graphic form is an idea of what the city of the future will look
like, the better housing that the sociologists talk about. Inci
dentally, the projects represent hundreds of hours of work.
Go over, if for no other reason, to get your nose off the grind
stone, to see what the art department is contributing to a good
,ife, to learn that art has more to offer than pure decorations.
By the way, there are some striking nude studies of a hand
some mulatto model. —T. S.
