## Why Poor Teachers? 
### 
To the Editor:
More on the quality of instructors. I spent years in teacher training
and think I can explain why some instructors are so lousy.
I'll spare the ones at Stanford to save them any embarrassment, but
I'll describe a couple of them at another institution I attended since
leaving Stanford.
One taught commercial law, a relatively simple subject on which
any businessman should be informed. In this class, the instructor spent
ALL of the time reading the text book back. He became visibly an
noyed if anyone interrupted to ask a question. Although he belonged
to the State Bar Association, he had little teaching ability.
An instructor in accounting had the same lack of qualifications for
teaching. He stuck to a strict textbook routine. He was a CPA and
had a Phi Beta Kappa key.
Who's to blame for misfits in the teaching business? Not the unfor
tunate instructors who are doing their best but don't know any better.
I would place the blame squarely on the person who hires instructors.
Teaching is a skill which has to be learned just the same as engineer
ing, business administration, or any other major field of activity. It
takes four years to produce a satisfactory grade school teacher and five
years to produce one for high school subjectsâ€”almost all of this time
being spent in learning teaching subjects with only a minimum in
mastering of subject matter. That is why a good teacher can even teach
a subject in which he has no previous experience, and do a good job
of it. He knows how to teach.
Teachers are frequently chosen because they have a Ph.D. or belong
to a professional organization, or were brilliant as a student. Why not
recognize that teaching ability and not mastery of subject matter is
the maximum factor in selection of a good instructor?
