To the Editor:
I have not read the Chinese Press Reviews referred to by Mr. Shawl
in last quarter's Daily. No doubt there was considerable criticism in
them of China's recent election. Being the first in China's long history,
there were bound to be abuses. Competent observers, however, believe
it to be a step in the right direction â€”along the road toward democracy.
Also, the fact that there is an opposition press to point out the abuses
is a good sign.
Mr. Shawl cannot say the same for the communist areas. Tens of
thousands of people have fled those areas during the past two years,
preferring the imperfect freedom of Nationalist China to the Soviet
style "democracy" of communist China. "Voting with their feet'' is
what some have called this migration.
