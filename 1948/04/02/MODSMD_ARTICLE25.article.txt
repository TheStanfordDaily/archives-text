# Solution to the Crisis
## 
### 
To the Editor:
George Bsunn's recent column regarding a "psychological-moral
religious" solution to the crisis and his reference to the Brethren trip
to "D. C." and to Students Concerned was joyously read by myself
and others. I feel that the continual pounding home of these ideas will
have effect. Maybe by 11)50 or 2000.
