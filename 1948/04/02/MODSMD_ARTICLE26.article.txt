It the Egyptian Pharaoh of 4.000 years ago had
drought hardships he should see this part of Cali
fornia during its drought cycles. For the second
straight year, the state faces an extra long season of
blue skies. An eight-year drought period ending
early in 1925 saw Searsville Lake dry lip completely.

On November 25, 1924, a Farm
civil engineering professor said the
Palo *Alto area needed a depend-
I able source for water that could
be relied upon during future
droughts.
This professor suggested Stan
ford arrange to pipe Hetch Hetchy
water from the main pipeline
r feeding the San Francisco area.
Today the University is again
looking to the Hetch Hetchy sup-
I ply to supplement domestic water

supplies if the underground wells in use run dry.
This underground domestic water supply used for
drinking and cooking purposes is limited because the
increased peninsula population is tapping the reserve.
If more underground water is used than flows down
from the coastal hills, then the table level falls and
new wells must be sunk. Expensive Hetch Hetchy
water would fill the gap should drilling operations
end in failure.
Stanford will not let the Searsville-Felt Lakes
supply fall to the level where none would be avail
able to fight fires. If the water level continues to fall,
campus irrigation would all but stop. Water for
Farm lawns and gardens can be piped from one of
the wells near the Convalescent Home now supply
ing Stanford's domestic water.
While the water shortage is a critical problem for
the Stanford Family, it does not warrant a state of
emergency or panic. Careful conservation by every
one should pull us through the year on existing
facilities.
