PHILADELPHIA (UP)—A "school of practical
politics" is teaching bewildered Philadelphia voters
how to recognize and deal with vote-stealing and
other illegal practices of the polling places.
Believed to be the first course of its kind in the
country, it aims at teaching the "facts of polities''
to the average citizen—even if the truth hurts.
The "teachers" are ward leaders, legislators, party
officials, candidates, and other practical politicians,
rather than "political science professors and orators."
As one speaker told his standing-room-only
audience, "First we tell you what the law says.
Then we'll tell you what's actually being done in
the election polls in this city."
The course of eight lessons is sponsored by the
non-partisan, liberal Americans for Democratic Ac
tion in an effort to "interest a higher type of citizen
in going into politics."

II started, sponsors explained, because a group
of them decided to run for committeemen and
women and realized they didn't know the first thing
about how to do it."
The political "babes in the wood" decided to teach
themselves, and anyone else who might be interested,
how to deal with fraud at the polling places, what
their rights as voters and candidates were, and how
to meet the professional politician on his own ground.
