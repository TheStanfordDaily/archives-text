## History 1948 
### 
(Editor's Note: A joint Senate-House conference
disposed of the Spanish controversy with unex
pected speed yesterday by striking Spain from the
European Recovery Program.)
Many times throughout recent years our House of
Representatives has acted in ways somewhat short
of brilliant. This we have come to accept as one of
the necessary evils of representative government.
But we should not idly accept the House's decision
to include Franco Spain in the European Recovery

Program.
' For this action is not merely
stupid, but highly dangerous.
There is no doubt about the na
ture of Franco's regime. It does
not pretend to be democratic. It
is in all essentials an exact coun
terpart of Hitler's and Mussolini's
governments. An AP dispatch last
week reported that Franco has
even refused to undertake "win
dow-dressing reforms" because he
thinks we will help him anyway.

The danger lies in handing the communists
throughout the world a tremendously powerful pro
paganda weapon. Nothing could suit Stalin better
than our support of Spain. For communists can
now argue plausibly that our real purpose in Europe
is to back fascist regimes.
We have been trying to convince the people of
Europe that we are interested in preserving freedom
and democracy and that democracy is our answer to
communism. Our salestalk will become embarras
singly difficult when we back dictatorships. The
suspicions aroused by our support of incompetent
Greek royalists would be fully confirmed by our
embrace of Franco.
It is> time to stop and determine just what steps are
effective to stop Slalin. Blind aid to any anti-commu
nist country is not effective. Fascism, at least as
dangerous as Stalinism, has not yet been defeated.
It is underground in Germany, rising in France under
DeGaulle, and full-grown in Spain. Aiding Franco
is about as intelligent as hiring A 1 Capone's kid
brother as your body guard.
Finally there is, even in this age of supposed
realism, a question of principle. We have long
argued that a basic difference between democracy
and communism is that the latter is willing to use
any means to accomplish its ends. If we doom mil
lions of Spaniards to continued tyranny the word
democracy becomes pretty meaningless.
A lot of Americans spent the best years of their
lives fighting fascism. They fought in vain if they
must now finance it.

There is no doubt about the na
ture of Franco's regime. It does
not pretend to be democratic. It
is in all essentials an exact coun
terpart of Hitler's and Mussolini's
governments. An AP dispatch last
week reported that Franco has
even refused to undertake "win
dow-dressing reforms" because he
thinks we will help him anyway.

The danger lies in handing the communists
throughout the world a tremendously powerful pro
paganda weapon. Nothing could suit Stalin better
than our support of Spain. For communists can
now argue plausibly that our real purpose in Europe
is to back fascist regimes.
We have been trying to convince the people of
Europe that we are interested in preserving freedom
and democracy and that democracy is our answer to
communism. Our salestalk will become embarras
singly difficult when we back dictatorships. The
suspicions aroused by our support of incompetent
Greek royalists would be fully confirmed by our
embrace of Franco.
It is> time to stop and determine just what steps are
effective to stop Slalin. Blind aid to any anti-commu
nist country is not effective. Fascism, at least as
dangerous as Stalinism, has not yet been defeated.
It is underground in Germany, rising in France under
DeGaulle, and full-grown in Spain. Aiding Franco
is about as intelligent as hiring A 1 Capone's kid
brother as your body guard.
Finally there is, even in this age of supposed
realism, a question of principle. We have long
argued that a basic difference between democracy
and communism is that the latter is willing to use
any means to accomplish its ends. If we doom mil
lions of Spaniards to continued tyranny the word
democracy becomes pretty meaningless.
A lot of Americans spent the best years of their
lives fighting fascism. They fought in vain if they
must now finance it.
