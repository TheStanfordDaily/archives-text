# ERLING FORLAND
## Bull Session 
### 
One of my buddies is supposed to be intelligent.
Girls consider him the brooding type. The girls he
goes out with, and he goes out with lots, are usually
starry-eyed when they first meet him, and in the
first flush of excitment at going out with him, usually
bring him home to show him to father and mother.
At first the girls' parents like him a lot, and think
he's a nice quiet boy, and are proud to have their
neighbors see their daughter with him. But. trouble
olten starts when the father gets curious about what
my buddy thinks about.
He looks like he's always brooding over something
you know, but he really isn't. It's just that he looks
that way; he never thinks about anything much.
But. since my buddy doesn't talk much either, they
don't know that. And, before you know it, the
girl's father has forbidden the girl to go out with
him, because he thinks he's a communist organizer
or something. This makes him very unhappy.
He came to the conclusion one day, that to protect
himself he'd have to think about things, so he'd
have little tidbits to tell a girl's folks. Then they
wouldn't think bad things about him. But since he
never had done any thinking, he didn't know exactly
how to go about it. Then he remembered what the
coach told him about baseball—when at bat, always
aim at the ball. He figured that if that advice
worked so well at baseball, why the same stuff ought
to work as far as thinking goes, too. So, he'd aim
his brain at a thought, and then let go. He did just
that.
At first all sorts of funny and crazy things hap
pened, but after a while his brain got the knack
of it. Then he'd start his brain humming and rattling
in the quest of a thought. The thoughts were elusive
at first, but once he connected with them, the world
was his.
Well, anyway, what I started out to tell you was
about three of the thoughts he came up with. His
girl friends' parents all liked them so much that he
wants to pass them on to some other fellows who
are having the same trouble that he once had—•
fellows who were suspected by their girls' parents of
all sorts of terrible things, simply because they look
like they think lots. These fellows, he feels, might
want to use these thoughts until they get some of
their own. So, here they are:
1. Many of the fellows at Stanford really enjoy

going out with girls. In fact, they like nothing better.
But. these boys have troubles that their non-dating
brothers don't have. Namely, money. Some girls
are better in this respect than others, of couVse, but
even the best run into money. Especially if you
date lots, and different ones every time at that.
So, a fellow goes broke occasionally. Well, since it's
a Stanford tradition for the boy to send the girl
flowers if lie gets her locked out. it should be also
by rights a Stanford tradition for the girl to give
the boys a case of cokes if he goes broke taking
her out. That was his first thought.
2. Stanford has always been considered a tough
school. No place at all for anyone who is a little weak
in the head, but especially so in these tough post-war
years, when classrooms are loaded with brainy vets.
Therefore, lots and lots of students go minus and
get flunked out. Well, the Farm is a big place. All
sorts of room. Now, why not give those students
who get flunked out 30 acres and a mule? Give
them another chance at life. Such was thought
number two.
3. Encina is very quiet now. Hardly anyone fools
around any more. Yet, before the war, Encina had
a pretty rugged reputation. All sorts of deviltry was
going on all the time. But. it's different now. The
place is ghostly in its stillness. All you see is fellows
with books in their hands. The halls once rang with
merriment, but they're silent now. Why so? It's
simply that now everyone is too loaded with home
work to bother with merrymaking.
Well, that would seem to be a good solution for
the UN, too. Apparently they don't have much to
do with their time, if they have nothing better
to do than plot another war. If you don't keep idle
dans busy, they'll get into mischief, says the old
proverb. Now, why not give those hoary old diplo
mats at the UN reports and stuff like that to prepare
as a sort of homework after a day's session? Then
they wouldn't have time to think about war, and
then like in Encina, the world could be at peace.
This is his third thought.
Maybe these thoughts aren't much, and probably
everybody won't like them. But as I said before,
these thoughts are some of my buddy's first creations,
and he's kind proud of them. So, I'll pass them
on for what they're worth.
