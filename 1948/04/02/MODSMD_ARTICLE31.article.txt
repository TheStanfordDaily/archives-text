# ‘Magic Town’ Given Okay, ‘Saigon’ Draws Daily Reviewer's Criticism
## 
### 
MAGIC TOWN—Jimmy Stewart plays an opinion poller who falls
for one of his subjects, Jane Wyman. Jimmy finds the mathematical
miracle town, the one that mirrors the opinion of the whole country.
Then things go blooie. If you like Jimmy Stewart in his post-war,
town-saving roles, then you should go for this one. Ned Sparks is back. too.

SAIGON —Alan Ladd plays Alan
Ladd like his Veronica Lake ran dry
in about as horrible a picture as has
come along. After an hour of lead
ing with his right whenever Veronica
appears on the scene, Ladd, to the
surprise of no one, winds up with
the gal, walking into a setting sun
after everyone else has been killed.
Ugh!
THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE—
Eleanor Parker and Ronald Reagan
team up to convert this popular
Broadway play into a highly enter
taining movie. A GI weekends in
New York and falls in love with the
only gal he can get a date with.
Eleanor Parker is captivating as the
heroine and Eve Arden does a good
job as the other woman.
KILLER McCOY—Mickey Rooney
finally gets away from Andy Hardy
in this fairy tale cast in the fight
ring. He whirls through the part
of an up and coming young boxer
with loads of enthusiasm and no
little talent. It's refreshing to find
out what Mickey can do if they'd
only let him. Not as moral as
"Body and Soul," this picture is
<.very bit as entertaining. Brian
Donlevy helps, too.
NAKED ClTY—After all the hul
labaloo has subsided and the rave
notices have faded, it turns out that
Mark Hellinger's last picture has
only some top-llight photography to
recommend it. It is just a run-of
the-mill mystery that attempts to
show the thoroughness of New York
policemen in tracking down the
various bad boys who are always
doing bad things. Barry Fitzgerald
is good as the detective, but the
rest of the cast is from hunger.
There are some good shots of New
York.
WILD HARVEST—A revival with
Alan Ladd and Dotty Lamour, con

cerns wheat harvesters. Alan Ladd
again spends an hour ignoring the
woman and the surprise is that no
body ends up with her. She's a
no-good woman, in the flicker, any
way, so there is no need to make
an honest woman of her.
GOLDEN EARRINGS — Another
revival. Marlene Dietrich plays an
unwashed gypsy in this fantastic
spy story with lost lost weekender
Ray Milland. Miss Dietrich no
speeksa da Anglish so hot, but she
really loves that boy. It seems she
was much better in the good old
days when she bathed regularly.
I WALK ALONE—No. Burt Lan
caster doesn't have 80, but if he
gets cast in another lulu like this
one. even his agent won't walk
with him. He teams up with Liza
beth Scott in a saga of a beer
runner who spends 14 years in the
cooler and then comes back to col
lect the deposit from his partner.
Lizabeth doesn't help the picture a
bit, but she has to earn her salary.
Crime doesn't pay like it used to.
—Ed Booth.
