## 
### BY JACK BLOOD 
Jim. Trabucco's pinch double with two on and two out in the
eighth gave the Stanford Freshmen a 5 to 4 win over Santa
Clara's frosh on the Freshman Diamond yesterday afternoon.
The win was the fifth in a row for Charlie Bushong's freshmen.
The Cards had to overcome a four-run Bronco lead to earn

I>.eir win. The game started out as
a tight pitcher's cluel between Stan
ford's Denny Tuffanelli and Santa
Clara's Bart Bartholemy. Then in
the fifth frame, an error, three sin
gles. and a long triple by Bronco
Fred Myatt brought in three runs
for the Santa Clarans.
THE BKONCO COLTS added an
other run in the top of the sixth
en two walks and a hit by leadofT
man Buz Harrington to assume a
4 to 0 lead. Meanwhile. Bartholemy
had held the Cards to three scat
tered singles although two walks
find a single by Sal Colletto had
loaded the bases in the fifth.
A three-run rally in the last of
the sixth put the Cardbabes back
in the running. It started with Dick
Clegg getting a walk. Tuffanelli fol
lowed with a single and Bruce Cam
eron's pass loaded the bases with
ope down. Another pass to Lloyd
Westphal forced in the first run and
Colletto came through with his sec
ond hit to bat in two more to make
it 4 to 3.
WESTPHAL. who came in to re
lieve Tuffanelli in the sixth, set
the Broncos down in the seventh
and eighth to set the stage for Tra
bucco's game-winning two-bagger.
The inning opened with Tuffanelli,
now playing center, being safe on
an error. Cameron sacrificed for
the first out but Westphal walked
Colletto couldn't advance them and
made it two away. Trabucco then
followed with his long drive which
hit inches from the top of the fence
in deep left center to score Tuffy
and Westphal with runs Nos. 4 and
5. A double play put out a Bronco

threat in the ninth to preserve the
lead.
THE FROSH are scheduled to
meet the California Cubs tomorrow
morning at Berkeley. Harry King
man's Cubs have compiled an im
pressive record in their games to
date.
In Bill Gear and Bill Wilson, the
Cal frosh have a pair of flingers
who have been very effective this
spring. However, they have been
hurt by poor fielding behind them.
THE BIG TEST for the fledgling
Cardinals will be in stopping the
Cubs' hitting attack. Don Monroe,
the shortstop, who is leading the
team in hitting, and sluggers Al
Davics and Gil Beck pack plenty of
offensive punch. Jim Claypool's job
as starting pitcher will be to stop
these boys.
Coach Bushong named the fol
lowing men to make up the traveling
squad for the game: Bob Ames,
Bruce Cameron, Jim Claypool, Dick
Clegg, Sal Colletto, Larry Fink,
Punch Hcrbold, Bill Herron, Ralph
Hillman, Dave Isbell, Ken LaCrosse,
John Licata, Don McComber, Er
nest Parker, Joe Pinotti, Bob Pows
ner, Royal Rudolph, Clay Thomson,
Jim Trabucco, Denny Tuffanelli,
Dick Vande, Lloyd Westphal, and
Russ Wharton.
