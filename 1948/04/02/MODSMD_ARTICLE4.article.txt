## Cave-in Opens Roadside Well 
### 
Yesterday, at approximately 11
a.m., a 50-toot hole was uncovered
by a cave-in at the side of Santa
Maria Road near Foothill Drive.
Called immediately to the scene,
the Corporation Yard erected a pro
tective fence around the four-foot
square opening.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said upon
inspecting the hole that it was prob
ably the shaft of an old, largely
hand-dug we'l that had not been
sufficiently filled in when aban
doned.
Dropping a rock into the mouth
of the gap. Blacker discovered that
the missile splashed some 50 feet
down, and concluded that "some
sort of water pocket probably ex
ists in the surface strata around
hex'e."
Blacker called in Dr. Bailey Wil
lis, of the department of geology, to
investigate further the nature of the
unexpected cave-in.
First man to reach the scene of
the cave - in after the report had
been phoned in was George Green,
labor department foreman of the
Corporation Yard. Green projected
the idea that the uncovered hole
"has some kind of historic signifi
cance."
