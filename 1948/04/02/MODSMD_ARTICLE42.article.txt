## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Varsity baseball takes on a Big Game atmosphere tomorrow
afternoon as Stanford tackles the champion Golden Bears at
Berkeley. The hustling Cards are searching for their second
straight league win, and Lefty Dave Dahle has been nom
inated as the starting pitcher. Dahle looked crood in winninn

♦his game against UCLA last week.
Having been tabbed as timid at
, the plate but fancy in the field, the
| Indians are eyeing Cal starting hurl
| fir Nino aßmise with contempt, and
i they are hoping to fatten their bat
j ting averages at his expense. Bar
j nise is the ace of an otherwise
! shabby Bear mound corps.
808 NAVA. batting from the
cleanup spot, is figured to lead the
Card hitting attack. Ted Noll, Clyde
i Dingfelder, and Bill Arce have also
: been hitting well lately and will be
i depended upon for more of the
same tomorrow.
It has been reported that Cali
fornia is suffering from the loss of
i ineligibles, but the always dangerous
Bears managed to make their one
league game against St. Mary's a
winning one, blasting the Gaels,
25 to 7.
California's outfield is considered
j to be one of the best in college base
, ball. John Fiscalini, Cal left fielder,
; is always a tough customer for the
1 Cards. Fiscalini hits hard and often
and will be the leading Bear threat.
OTHER MEMBERS of the highly
rated outfield combo are leadoil'
man Lyle Palmer in center, and
Cliff McClain in right. All three
hit well over ..'3OO last season.
Cal has two sparkling infielders
in Ed Sanclemente at third and
Bob O'Dell at first.
With Buck Brownson and Bob
Peters working as the keystone com
bination, Bill Arce handling the hot
corner, and Charlie Cole over on
the initial sack. Stanford rates a
slight edge in the infield. That is,
if they can start swinging their bats.
FRANK MactißAW will draw
the starting catching assignment.
He is a capable performer and is
| especially good when he is hitting,
Stanford went through a lengthy
batting practice session and sharp
infield workout last night in warm
ing up for Saturday, The club
seems to be in top shape and ready
for Cal.
The Bears will be slight favorites,
but as always when these two teams
get together, anything can happen.
And Stanford finds itself with one
of its best nines in recent years.


808 LEWIS, recently a star on
the basketball court, has now
switched his talents to tennis.
Lewis will buhl down the number
one spot as the net team hosts
COP tomorrow afternoon.
