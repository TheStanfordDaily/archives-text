## 
### 
"COP is weaker than last year,"
said Tennis Coach Elwyn Bugge
when lie was asked about Stanford's
chances of winning tomorrow's ten
nis matches. "But our team will
have to play good ball to win."
Stanford's varsity tennis team will
meet COP's men tomorrow at 1:30
p.m., after playing Santa Barbara
the same morning at 10.
COP WON the Northern Califor
nia championship last year. Since
that time every letterman in tennis
left school except Hank Pfister,
number one man. and Ted Collins.
Though new men are showing an
excellent game, the loss has put
COP down low in the Pacific Coast
tennis ratings.
Coach Bugge promises a well
balanced team with the doubles
team equally as strong as the singles
matches.
"OUR DOUBLES TEAMS are
strong." he said. "The whole team
has greatly improved since last
year."
Bugge's number one man is lanky
Bob Lewis. He and his twin brother
Fred are tabbed as the number one
doubles team. This doubles team
went into the finals in the Intercol
legiate Tournament at Berkeley last
weekend.
"It's hard to say how the tennis
ladder runs now," said Bugge. He
ventured that the first live men
were Bob Lewis, Kirke Meechem,

Fred Lewis, Bob Forbes, and Errol
Lycette.
STANFORD IS RATED to be
about third in the Pacific Coast
Conference standings by Coach
Bulge's estimate. He placcs UCLA
as first, then USC and Stanford. He
says that Stanford and Cal will be
very closely matched.
Stanford will have trouble when
the team meets USF. The boys from
USF made a remarkable showing in
the Intercollegiate Tournament last
week.
Just about all of the finalists were
USF men. The Dons are the team
to watch this spring tennis season.
