# Drilling Begun On New Well
## 
### 
University workers started drill
ing operations yesterday at a sec
ond campus site to locate a source
of water to supplement Stanford's
two existing wells. First drilling at
tempt was abandoned last week
when a shaft, sunk 580 feet, hit bed
rock.
Although spring rains during the
past 10 days settled the dust, Busi
ness Manager Alf E. Brandin said,
the emergency is far from over.
Searsville Lake is half full, while
the Felt Lake reserve is also below
its normal capacity.
If the water level falls much more
in the two lakes, Farm residents will
be hit by stricter rationing. This
may have to be done to allow
enough water pressure from the
lakes to maintain fire protection at
Stanford.
Campus irrigation is now limited
to one day a week for each of the
six residence and plant zones di
viding the campus area.
Brandin said the voluntary ra
tioning plan initiated six weeks ago
must be continued until campus and
residential areas are notified other
wise.
