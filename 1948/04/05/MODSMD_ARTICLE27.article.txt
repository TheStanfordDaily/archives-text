# English Woman Preacher Tells Today's Need for Non-Violence
## 
### DERBY WELLES 
Miss Muriel Lester, famous Eng
"i.-h preacher and pacifist, yester
day told the congregation of the
Memorial Church that spiritual en
ergy is possessed by every man but
it lacks fulfillment except in the
greatest of them. This constitutes a
basic, reparable wrong in today's
world.
In an interview after her sermon,
Miss Lester declared that sell-iden
tification with victims of evil and
evildoers will help to overcome evil.
Evil cannot be fought with anything
but its opposite, she said.
"The vow of non-theft is almost
s fundamental as that of truth.'
she said, expressing the thought, "if
you have more than you need and
others have less than you, you are
a thief."
As a remedy of the present Euro
pean situation, she suggested that
rich American might attempt self
discipline — the giving Hp of be
tween-meal snacks. The identifica
tion of these few hungry hours wtih
the hunger of Europeans would do
good, she believes.
In her advocacy of non-violence,
Miss Lester wants immediate dis
armament and the use of the "bil
lions spent on bombs used for a
crusade of economic usefulness
throughout the world to eliminate
hunger—which is the worst."
Throughout her sermon she inter
spersed many vivid personal anec
dotes collected in her trips through
Europe and India. She saw the lat
ter country as "the most hopeful
place in the world." —Welles
