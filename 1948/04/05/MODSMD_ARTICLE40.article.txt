ROME, Italy, April 4 (UP)-The
government put 20,000 well
equipped troops and police on na
rade today before 500,000 wildly
cheering Romans today in an ob
vious show of force to communists
just two weeks before the critical
national elections. It was the great
est display of armed strength in
the capital since Mussolini's big
demonstration for Hitler in 1936.
