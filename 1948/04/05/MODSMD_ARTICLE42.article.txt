# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Required Reading 
### 
On page one today is a story that should be reguired reading
for every member of the Stanford student body. For in another
week and a half we will be voting on a 59,000 guestionâ€”
whether or not to embark on a plan of foreign scholarships
next year.
It's almost certain that on the day of the vote, and during
the days preceding, some one is bound to ask, "Just what is
this scholarship plan all about, anyway?" The article on the
bottom of page one today answers that guestion.
In addition. The Daily will present a series of four articles
beginning Friday which will give the pro and con sides of
the guestion.
We think you ought to read them all. As a matter of pride,
if for no other reason. Intelligent and informed voters are
hard to find these days. If they exist anywhere they certainly
should be in a college community.
If you don't think your vote is worth $9,000, don't read and
inform yourself on the issue. If it is, turn to page one.
