## MacArthur for Stanford 
### 
To the Editor:
In iine with the present widspread trend to select outstanding military
figures for top political and educational posts, the committee engaged in
selecting a president for Stanford might do well to consider one of the
most glittering personalities of all—General Douglas Mac Arthur.
Before such a proposal is shouted down by 100 per cent of the ex-navy
personnel enrolled at school, let us consider the many benefits which
would accrue to us all.
In the first place, hopeful Republican aspirants from Senator Robert A.
"Bob" Taft all the way down to Jack "Don't Fire Til You See Their
Red-rimmed Eyes" Tenney, would be delighted at the prospect of one
Jess competitor, and the school would asure itself of a warm friend in
a high place come the GOP avalanche next fall.
William Randolph Hearst, overcoming his initial disappointment, would
probably adjust himself to the role of a minor president-maker as being
better than nothing at all. Conceivably the least we might figure from
him would be a generous grant to the School of Medicine—perhaps en
dowing an anti-vivisection research to investigate the feasibility of sub
stituting known left-wingers on the chopping table instead of good old
Fido.
What's more, there'd be a championship football team here next fall,
by God, or someone would answer to headquarters.
The inauguration ought to be unquestionably the most brilliant affair
in the school's history. Picture 8,000 Stanford men and women standing
on the banks of Lake Lagunita, tears of joy and pride streaming down
their faces as the General strides ashore from a jeep parked in the middle
—without even rolling up his pantslegs.
