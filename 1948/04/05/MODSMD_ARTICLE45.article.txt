To the Editor:
Professor Graham Stuart, in a recent issue of The Daily, quoted Allen
Drury's statement that (he United Nations is unable to handle the
partition of Palestine.
Quoting contradictory authorities, of course, proves nothing, but it is
worth noting that Sumner Welles, who is probably at least as informed
as Mr. Drury. docs not agree; he believes the UN must enforce its de
cision to partition Palestine or face disaster.
In the past (in regard to the Truman Doctrine and ERP) the State
Department's excuse for bypasing the UN has been Russia's veto. Now
when the United States and Russia have at last been able to agree on
a major issue, we are again told that the UN is powerless and cannot
carry out its own decision.
If this tendency persists, will the UN ever be able to carry out any
decision? If the UN cannot act when the major powers are in agreement,
when will it be able to act'.'
Perhaps it is time to stop looking for excuses for not using the UN
r.nd to seek diligently for ways to strengthen it by implementing its
decisions.
