Have you ever noticed out at Rossotti's that the
box for infantile paralysis contributions is full to the
top. Bouquets to the students who go out there to
forget their troubles but not the troubles of others.

I see where a guy by the name of loshio Oda, over

in Japan, is the self-appointed
campaign manager of the Mac-
Arthur for President movement.
This could be a canny move on the
part of Gda to get Mac Arthur out
of Japan.
Closer to home there is Mac-
Arthur sentiment also. At the
close of last quarter there was a
notebook and a pencil on a table
in front of the cellar. In the book
(when I saw it) there were 51
signatures to a petition. The peti-

tion said in substance:
"We, the undersigned, believe that Gen. Douglas
A. Mac Arthur has done such a fine job of govern
ing Japan that he should be kept there at all costs."
(Editor's Note: See Campus Opinion for more Mac-
Arthur sentiment.)

Some of the Democrats have gone "underground."
When they "come up" they hope it will be in the
president's office of the University of Columbia.

According to the campus purveyor of information,
The Stanford Daily, "Love and Marriage Today"
will be discussed in a series of six Thursday eve
ning lectures starting April 8.
One of the topics will be "Children: When, Why,
and Whose?"
I am making a notation to hear the last part of
this lecture.

Speaking of marriage, statistics reveal that it is a

Rocket experts now generally agree they can
gather enough power to send a missile to the moon.
Having found they can do it, they are sitting dewn
and trying to find a good reason for wanting to do
it in the first place.
So far they have not found a reason, but The Daily
will let you know the minute anything turns up.
A half-ton rocket would only weigh one . pound
when it reached the moon because 909 pounds of it
would be l'uel used up during the trip. Besides that,
the terrific speed would produce a heat likely to
melt away half of the one pound left.
And if there is anything that looks silly, it's half a
pound of molten metal hitting around on the moon
doing nothing.
I was in New Jersey when they bounced radar
pulses off the moon, and watched the whole opera
tion. The pulses were transmitted with much ado,
traveled through space, struck the moon, returned,
and made pips of light on a radar screen.
Frankly, the whole thing left me cold, and today
I am in the Department of Journalism.

To eliminate taxes and Stanford University, is the
theme of a political movement on foot at UC.
Tlie trouble with anything "on foot" is that it
doesn't move very fast. Perhaps the brethren at
Berkeley should get on their pogo sticks.

Speaking of marriage, statistics reveal that it is a
preventative against suicide.
This seems only fair, since suicide is a preventa

Rocket experts now generally agree they can
gather enough power to send a missile to the moon.
Having found they can do it, they are sitting dewn
and trying to find a good reason for wanting to do
it in the first place.
So far they have not found a reason, but The Daily
will let you know the minute anything turns up.
A half-ton rocket would only weigh one . pound
when it reached the moon because 909 pounds of it
would be l'uel used up during the trip. Besides that,
the terrific speed would produce a heat likely to
melt away half of the one pound left.
And if there is anything that looks silly, it's half a
pound of molten metal hitting around on the moon
doing nothing.
I was in New Jersey when they bounced radar
pulses off the moon, and watched the whole opera
tion. The pulses were transmitted with much ado,
traveled through space, struck the moon, returned,
and made pips of light on a radar screen.
Frankly, the whole thing left me cold, and today
I am in the Department of Journalism.

To eliminate taxes and Stanford University, is the
theme of a political movement on foot at UC.
Tlie trouble with anything "on foot" is that it
doesn't move very fast. Perhaps the brethren at
Berkeley should get on their pogo sticks.

Have you ever noticed out at Rossotti's that the
box for infantile paralysis contributions is full to the
top. Bouquets to the students who go out there to
forget their troubles but not the troubles of others.

I see where a guy by the name of loshio Oda, over

in Japan, is the self-appointed
campaign manager of the Mac-
Arthur for President movement.
This could be a canny move on the
part of Gda to get Mac Arthur out
of Japan.
Closer to home there is Mac-
Arthur sentiment also. At the
close of last quarter there was a
notebook and a pencil on a table
in front of the cellar. In the book
(when I saw it) there were 51
signatures to a petition. The peti-

tion said in substance:
"We, the undersigned, believe that Gen. Douglas
A. Mac Arthur has done such a fine job of govern
ing Japan that he should be kept there at all costs."
(Editor's Note: See Campus Opinion for more Mac-
Arthur sentiment.)

Some of the Democrats have gone "underground."
When they "come up" they hope it will be in the
