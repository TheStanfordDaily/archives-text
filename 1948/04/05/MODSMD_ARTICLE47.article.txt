## History 1948 
### 
Korea is like a ballet dancer with a tight girdle.
The poor lady is having the very life squeezed nut
of her. In the case of the ballet dancer it might be
humorous; in the case of Korea, girdled by the 38th
parallel, it's catastrophic.
Alter 61 meetings and two sessions of the joint
commission, called to dissolve the 38th parallel bar
rier and unite Korea's agricultural south and indus
trial north, it has become evident that trusteeship as
a bi-lateral partnership is dead.
Trusteeship as defined by the Moscow Agreement
of December, 1945, has been redefined into oblivion
by the Soviet Union. This redefinition, which instead
of mending the 38th incision, has only deepened it,
led to the proclaiming of a "Democratic People'r,
Republic" of North Korea on Feb. 16. Its avowt d
purpose: to eventually overrun the entile country,
whether the U. S. likes it or not.
Back of all this is a chronology of U. S. occupation
blunders—but more important are the revealed tech
niques of the Soviet Union.
The only reason elections have not been held in
Korea—and all the Korean parties given a voice in
choosing their own provisional government—rests
upon the definition of "democracy." The Soviets are
willing to give a democratic hearing to oil parties
which never at any time opposed the idea of trustee
ship for Korea or the Moscow Agreement. This
means a democratic hearing to pro-communist par
ties only, since all others have vociferously opposed
trusteeship. The U. S. wants all parties heard re
gardless of previous or present ideas about trustee
ship. On this point the joint commission has been
hamstrung since March, 1946.
All this time, the Soviets in the North, safe behind
the 38th parallel, have been communizing North
Korea.
While the U. S. hesitated about distributing Jap
owned lands, the Soviets proclaimed one month
after occupation in September, 1945, that "every in
stitution and property in Korea (held by Japs) will
be returned to the Koreans without exception.'' We
haven't yet found our way clear legally to nu.ke
an equitable setlement of land. In Korea, 75 per cent
agricultural, land means everything. Thus, the
Soviets, who are never very hard-pressed when it
comes to scruples, beat us to the political punch.
The first phase of our occupation saw us blatantly
appeasing the Soviets. Wo talked down the up
talking "conservatives" in South Korea, who n we
feared might antagonize the communists. As a result,
we created a political void—a vacuum which the
strongly sovietized north would like to feel.
While we talked ideologically, the Soviets gave
back land, put into effect the stiff rice coilcction
programs, and stabilized the national currency to ,a
greater extent than we. They also conscripted an.
army of Koreans, now reaching 100,000 and maybe
twice that many. Facing each other now along the
38th is an understrengthed U. S. force and a vigor
ous, indoctrinated communistic Korean army. Yes
terday the North Koreans were seen digging
trenches along the 38th—with gun emplacements
pointing southward.
While we soft-pedaled Korean attempts to set up
their own government, while we willy-nillied about
doing anything without Soviet cooperation and en
action, the Soviets built up the North Korean gov
ernment, founded upon People's Committees who
early took charge of most North Korean affairs while
we still kept the Japanese in power in the south.
When trusteeship as a bilateral action died with
the unilateral proclamation of a "Democratic Peo
ple's Republic" in North Korea, we had to admit
(but too late) that behind the guise of redefinition
and lexicology about what "democracy" meant, the
Russians had done a heap of sovietizing in North
Korea, mutilated the Moscow Agreement into the
paper thing it always was, and proved themselves
again masters of propaganda and doctors of
psychology.
