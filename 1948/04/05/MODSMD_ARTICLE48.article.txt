CLEVELAND (UP) —The U. S. Immigration Serv
ice here agrees that the course of true love doesn't
always run smooth, but the bureau chief, Floyd Ault,
says he views suspiciously some of the international
affairs of the heart that wind up in his domain.
Ault said he believes some of them may have
been "engineered." Most of the cases arise out
of the law which permits a veteran to bring a
foreign girl here to marry her. The boy puts up
a 8500 bond to guarantee he'll walk down a church
aisle with her, and then the government gives
them !>0 days to make arrangements.
According to Ault's theory concerning some of the
cases, the law is just being used to get marriageable
girls from the "old country" into the United States.
For example, he said, recent\\ a 17-year-old
Syrian girl arrived from Lebanon to marry a
Cleveland veteran. Immediately they <jot a license
and set the date. Then the boy's American girl
friend saw the announcement in the paper.
The bridegroom-to-be talked it over and made a
decision. The day before his scheduled wedding to
the Syrian girl they eloped.
Rather than see the girl deported, his brother
married her. But the brother wasn't a veteran.
Ault found a law permitting the girl to stay, but
the S5OO bond went into the government's coffers.
Ault said he was a little suspicious of that one
but an international "romance" involving an Italian
girl recently left no doubt in his mind.
In this case, he said, "friends" persuaded a veteran
here to exchange letters with an Italian gill. An

"engagement" followed and his family put up the
bond and paid her plane fare.
The girl stepped from (lie plane at the Cleveland
Airport, took one look at her fiance and declared
nothing on earth would convince her to marry him.
She went right hack to Italy—at her own expense,
