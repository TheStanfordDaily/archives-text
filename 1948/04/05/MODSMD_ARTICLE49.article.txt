WASHINGTON—DipIomats debating the proposed
return of Trieste to Italy may ignore the fact, but
there are some American comic strips in the back
ground.
First, the Free Territory of Trieste set up by
the six-months-old Italian peace treaty is small—
one-quarter the size of Rhode Island. So Italians
have dubbed it Topolino, meaning Mickey Mouse
land.
Second, pending succcss in the search for an ac
ceptable governor, the boomerang-shaped territory
remains divided into Anglo-American and Yugoslav
military zones. The 5,000 Gls on occupation duty
quickly look their cue from the funnies and named
their northern beat Upper Sobbovia and the Yugo
slav-patrolled southern section, Lower Slobbovia,
after (he mythical comic realms.
Because of its position at the head of the Adriatic
Sea and on routes to inland Europe, Trieste is an
age-old center for maritime commerce, notes the
National Geographic Society < Romans, Franks,
Goths, Venetians in turn controlled its deep harbor.
