# Stanford Baseballers Lose Twice to Cal; Varsity Defeated 7 to 3; Frosh Dumped
## 
### BY JACK BLOOD BY JOHN HALL 
A six-run uprising by the
California Frosh in the seventh
1 inning sent the Stanford Fresh
man baseballers down to a 12
to 5 defeat at Berkeley last
| Saturday. The game was played
I on a soggy field and play was sus
pended for 20 minutes in the last
of the fifth when a downpour swept
! over Hilgard Field.
The game opened in much the
same manner as Thursday's Santa
Clara game with pitchers Jim Clay
pool of Stanford and Bill Gear of
the Cubs pitching shutout ball for
four innings. Then in the top of
the fifth a walk by Sal Colletto,
1 Jim Tr."i ueco's single and Dick
Clegg's double to deep right center
pushed the Carls into a 1 to 0 ad
vantage.
IN 'i.!•; BOTTOM half of the in
ninr, a beautiful throw by center
fielder Denny Tuffanelli cut down
a Cal runner, attempting to score
from second on a single, to preserve
the slim advantage. With two Cal
men on base and two down the
; rains came and the umpire called a
halt to the proceedings. When play
resumed, Claypool fanned Beck to
end the threat.
HIE DELAY seemed to have
■ bothered the lanky right hander be
j cause in the sixth he issued three
| passes sandwiched in with an error
I to force one run across and leave
the bases full. Lefty Lloyd West
' phal came in to put out the fire
but not before a walk and hit had
! scored two more runs to put Cal in
front, 3 to 1. Further damage was
averted Vhen right fielder Bill Her
ron cut short a run with another
fine throw to the plate.
TIIE NIGHTMARE Cal seventh
opened inauspiciously with a soft
pop up to McComber. Then fol
lowed five walks, a single by Dod
son, a single by Davies and two
errors to score the six runs. The
i bases were still loaded when a
force play ended the unhappy in-
I ning.

Stanford went up to Berkeley
Saturday and lost a baseball
game. The non-hitting Cards
managed to score three runs
on three hits, but never threat
ened as they dropped their first
contest with the Bears, 7 to 3.
The win put California on top
of the CIBA loop race and low
ered Stanford to next to last, with
one win and two losses. California
has perfect record of two wins and
no losses.
STANFORD, perhaps bothered by
rain, the sudden loss of second
sacker Bob Peters, and the strange
absence of catcher Frank MacGraw,
could not get any consistent offen
sive attack to take hold.
The Indians trailed 7 to 0 going
into the top of the eighth, but in
that inning they combined two
walks, an eror, and a clutch hit by
catcher Dick Alquist to ruin Bar
nise's chance for a shutout.
ONLY OTHER CARDS to touch
Barnise for safe hits were third
basemen Bill Arce and second base
man Bob Mason. Both hits were
singles.
Stanford pitcher Dave Dahle lost
his first league game, and was held
responsible for six of the Boar runs.
He worked six and two-thirds in
nings, striking out six.
DAVE STOTT relieved Dahle in
the seventh, and in turn was re
placed by Frank Labrum, who fin
ished out the game.
One double play was turned in
when Buck Brownson scooped up a
hot grounder to short, threw nicely
to lViason at second, who threw to
Cole at first in time to complete
the play. It was one of the nicest
fielding plays of the day.
AS EXPECTED, Cal left fielder
John Fiscalini hurt Stanford with
his hard hitting. Fiscalini unlim
bered his big warclub to get two
hits and drive in three runs. He led
the Bears' 10—hit attack.
Putting their Bear troubles behind
them, the varsity is now getting
ready to meet Santa Clara Wednes
day in the Sunken Diamond. They
will need a win against the Broncos
to bring their CIBA record to the
.500 mark.
