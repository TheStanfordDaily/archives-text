# United States Olympic Squad Shaping Up
## 
### 
The naming of the 14-man Amer
ican Olympic basketball team was
the major development in America's
Olympic preparations last week.
Heading the list were such stand
out performers as seven-foot Bob
Kurland and Lew Beck, former
OSC star, who paced the Phillips
Oilers to the Olympic playoff
championship; Alex ''The Nose"
Groza. Kentucky's ace ball handler;
and Don Barksdale, UCLA s sensa
tion of last year, whose backboard
play carried the Oakland Bittners
into the Olympic tryout tournament.
OTHER STARS selected were:
Vince Boryla. Denver Nuggets; and
Jesse Renick, Gordon Carpenter,
and R. C. Pitts, all of the Oilers. In
addition to Groza, Kentucky placed
Wah Wah Jones, Ralph Beard, Ken
Rollins, and Cliff Barker on the
team. Jackie Robinson, Baylor's
parson, and Ray Lumpp of NYU
complete the U.S. Olympic cage
squad.
Other Olympic news comes from
Boston and from Madison. Wiscon
sin. where AAU and NCAA boxers
are competing for berths in the
Olympic trials to be held in the
New England city next June. Fight
i rs from California. Cal Aggies. San
Jose State, and the Olympic Club
are entered in the two tournaments.
PLANS TO HAVE an amateur
;'ll-star baseball team play in an
exhibition game in London this
summer are stiil in the tentative
j:t:i.v.e. In the 1936 Olympiad at Ber
lin a picked American squad under
ti e coaching of Stanford's Harry
\Volter played an unofficial game
with the World All - Stars. Coach
W »hei 's men dropped a close 5 to 1
decision before a large crowd.
INTEREST IN the choice of a col
lege shell to represent the United
Slates in O'ympic crew events
mounted with the announcement
that California's oarsmen began in
tensive workouts last £ riday. Coach
Ky Ebright's Bears have already
won two Olympic crew champion
ships and they will bo after their
third.
Strong competition will come
from Washington's Hskies, who won
the Olympic title in 19U6, as well as
Harvard, Syracuse, and Navy, last
war's Poughkeepsie regatta victor.
