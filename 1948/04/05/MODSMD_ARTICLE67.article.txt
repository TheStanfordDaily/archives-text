# Ancient Vases Comprise King-Size Jigsaw Puzzle
## 
### RAY MORGAN Jr 
If you've ever had any trouble
with a jigsaw puzzle, don't read any
further, because you wouldn't be
interested in one that contains over
200,000 pieces.
Three Farm neophyte archaeolo
gists are hard at work on just such
a. project, however, under the di
rection of Dr. Hazel D. Hansen, pro
fessor of classics. Three times a
week, in the basement of the Stan
ford Museum, Mary Sherrill, John
Davis, and Loren Slentz spend their
time piecing together ancient vases
which form part of the General
Luigi Di Cesnola collection.
GENERAL DI CESNOLA was
American consul on the island of
Cyprus during the 1880's. (If you've
forgotten your Western Civ, that's
in the eastern end of the Mediter
ranean.) In his spare time, Di Ces
nola dug up a few graves. The
Cyprians had a custom of sending
along toys, vessels of food and
drink, and even money to keep the
corpse happy during its trip to the
next world.
All in all, the General unearthed
some 40,000 pieces which he even
tually sold to the Metropolitan Mu
seum of New York. An especially
good buy from his point of view, as.
by some coincidence, he happened
to be director of the place. Six thou
sand pieces of this collection were
sold to the Stanford Museum in 1896
—consisting of over 4,500 vases, 500
figurines, 500 lamps, and several
hundred coins.
THE DISPLAY had little more
than been organized when the roof
fell in. Over half the collection was

destroyed in the 1906 earthquake.
The pieces were swept up. carted to
the basement—and forgotten about.
And here's where the putting-to
gether part comes in.
Following an inventory of the
Museum in 1946. Professor Hansen
got her group together and started
all over again. The crates were ex
cavated a second time and all the
potsherds (trade talk for pieces)
cleanscd of a 40-year accumulation
of dust. Next, they were sorted
chronologically and classified as to
design, fabric, and texture.
It was decided to begin with the
vases, and the group is currently
well into the job of reconstruction.
Slentz, an advanced chemistry stu
dent. has come in handy more than
once by testing some piece of clay
to discover the peculiarities of firing
and biscuit.
THE VASES range from three
feet in height to the size of one's
little finger and are glued together
with a special cement bought from
New Jersey. Some of them were
haphazardly mended in the confu
sion following the quake and have
to be taken apart and redone.
Perhaps the most remarkable
thing about the collection is its
range. The relics date from the
early bronze age of 3000 B.C. to the
second century classical Greek pe
riod. The Di Cesnola collection is
also an excellent one for teaching,
as the students are saved only the
trouble of having to dig up the
pieces themselves.
The work is now part of a course
for archaeology majors and is being
readied for future publication and
exhibition.


LIKE PUZZLES? Then you will probably be interested in the work
of the three Farm archaeologists who have undertaken the arduous
task of piecing together ancient pottery. Standing around Dr. Hazel
Hansen, under whose direction the work is being accomplished, they
are. from left to light. Loren Slantz, John Davis, and Mary Sherrill.
