# Scientists Apprehend Sulphur As Criminal in Smog Problem
## 
### 
Elemental sulphur is the chief t
cause of eye initation resulting!
from Los Angeles smog, according i
to recent experiments made by the !
Stanford Research Institute in smog- j
filled Los Angeles.
In an on-the-spot chemical analy- 1
sis of the Los Angles atmosphere, j
Paul L. Magill, chairman in charge
of the smog project, reported that !

I sulphur was present. Later experi
! ments in the Stanford smog cham
ber proved that sulphur was the
! irritating element.
The smog chamber, a machine
j similar to the gas chamber of San
Quentin Prison, is a small, rectan
: gular room with metal walls, glass
| observation windows, and a pipe
! through which gases can be intro
j duced in measured quantities. Var
ious sulphur compounds were tried
j in the chamber without success.
Formaldehyde, sulphur dioxide, sul
i phur trioxide. acrolein, and other
sulphur mixtures produced only
slight irritations. Then the scien
; tists tried elemental sulphur and
j hit a jackpot of "tears" from the
"victim" in the chamber.
I The Institute's scientists have
been unable to discover where the
sulphur in the air comes from, but
they have unearthed one interesting
fact. Although fumes from automo
bile exhaust pipes contain relatively
little sulphur, the sulphur is tied up
with the carbon monoxide automo
biles form, and a scientist staying
in the Second street tunnel long
enough to make a complete survey
| would have died from carbon mo
! noxide poisoning.


STANFORD RESEARCHERS PREPARE to create artificial smog in
a test chamber which is a scientific relative of the San Quentin gas
chamber. Constructed to determine the effect of various air con
taminants in causing eye and throat irritation, the smog chamber is
located in the Stanford Research Institute laboratories at the University.
Dr. li. E. Scantlebury awaits the introduction of sulphur fumes as
Mrs. Myra Rolston (kneeling) checks the gas flow and Mrs. Mavis Mc-
Cormic watches the "victim's" reactions. Ervvin Thorson, meteorologist,
checks the airtight doors.
