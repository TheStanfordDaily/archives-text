# Library Uses New Call Card
## 
### 
A new type of call card is now
in use in the Stanford library. The
card is designed to aid the students
and the librarian in finding the de
sired book or periodical more easily.
On the front side of the 5 x 3-inch
card the student writes the author
and title of the book, or title, vol
ume, and date of the periodical he
wishes.
Other information filled out by
the student is his name, address, and
the call number of the book. The
time the book is due is then
stamped on by the librarian.
Should the book not be available,
the student can keep the card to use
again. Should the book be in a dif
ferent library or room, notation of
this fact will be made on the back
of the card by the librarian. Space
for a staff search record and over
due record is also on the back.
