## 
### HARDIN HOLMES 
On April 14, Stanford students
will decide the future of the For
eign Scholarship Plan by voting on
the following question:
''Do you approve the plan of bring
ing foreign students (as proposed by
the Foreign Scholarship Committee
and tentatively approved by Ex
com) involving a maximum expen
diture of $9,050 from ASSU funds?"
WHAT IS THE PLAN? How did
it come into being?
In January, a group consisting of
Jose de Larios, B. J. Denning, Har
din Holmes, Joe Babich, Kary Fish
er, Chuck Martin, Jim Welch, Bob
Coate, and Dean Lawrence Kimp
ton, met to discuss Stanford's posi

It was assumed, as the object of
the meeting, that Stanford Univer
sity is in a position to aid actively
: n furthering international under
standing. It was also assumed that,
'"spite the good work being done

i by Stanford agencies in certain
j areas, only a small portion of our
possibilities here were being real
ized. The Forign Scholarship Plan
was evolved from their discussion
and investigation.
It provides for bringing 10 Euro
pean student leaders to Stanford for
one year. They will live with cam
pus groups which have volunteered
to provide room and board. Trans
portation and tuition are to be pro
vided by the administration and the
ASSU.
NOMINATIONS WILL BE MADE
by a combination of the Interna
tional Institute of Education, UNES
CO, the State Department, and
Stanfordites abroad. After having
passed minimum entrance require
ments, final selection will be made
by a student committee and the liv
ing pToup concerned.
This proprpm will be extended to
universities throughout the country
by the National Students' Associa

lion, fraternities, and other agen
cies.
Parts of the plan have already
been approved. To date, fraternities
and Toyon have offered to provide
room, board, and, in some cases,
spending money, for as many as 12
students. Lagunita has voted to
provide the board and room for one
foreign student. The University
Committee on Scholarships will
match up to five full tuition schol
arships from the ASSU.
TRANSPORTATION AND INCI
DENTALS will also be provided
from still unbudgeted ASSU funds
now on hand. The absolute maxi
mum cost to the Associated Stu
dents has been computed at $9,050.
In order to provide further in
formation, the Foreign Scholarship
Committee will furnish studr-*
speakers to living groups, and will
hold office hours from 3 to 5 p.m.
daily in the Council office at the
Union.
