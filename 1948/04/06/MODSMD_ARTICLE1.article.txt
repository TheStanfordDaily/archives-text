# Code Violator Suspended By Men's Council
## 
### 
Violation of the Honor Code
resulted yesterday in the guilty
stu d en t's suspension from
school. Punitive action was
taken by Men's Council after
a heated three-hour meeting.
Violation of the Code took place
in a mathematics final examination
winter quarter, when a student took
a completed examination from the
instructor's desk, copied, and then
destroyed it. Conclusive evidence
showed that the suspected student's
work was not his own.
The student will be allowed to
return summer quarter, but will
receive an "F" in the course.
Men's Council also found a stu
dent guilty of making long dis
tance telephone calls from a Uni
versity phone without arranging to
be billed for the calls. He was
sentenced to two hours' work at
the Convalescent Home.
Student suspected of failing to
pay Cellar bills was issued a warn
ing after he had paid two checks
which he had overlooked.
Present at Men's Council meeting
were Chairman Fred Hanr.um. Sec
retary Dave Guyer. BUI Richardson,
Al Munk, Tom Diamond, and Jack
Little.
