### 
MILWAUKEE, April 5 (UP)â€”Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New
York, Harold E. Stassen and Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur face the
first major test of their presidential campaigns tomorrow in
the Wisconsin Republican primary.
Mac Arthur and Stassen have been leading all sample ballots.
Dewey himself concedes MacAr- *

thur's advantage as a Wisconsin
"favorite son" candidate, but said
he would not drop out of the Presi
dential race even if he finished last.
The primary ballot will not be
direct Presidential preferential vot
ing. Instead, it is a battle for Wis
consin's 27 voting delegates at
the Republican national convention
June 21. Each of the candidates has
a full slate of 27 delegate candidates
pledged to him. The voters will
elect the delegates.
The Democrats also will hold a
primary, but all but three of the 53
-candidates for delegates to the
Democratic national convention are
pledged to President Truman.
Voting was expected to be ex
ceptionally heavy, perhaps running
100.000 over the 1944 primary,
when 514,000 ballots were cast.
Some observers predicted that to
morrow's total vote might be as
high as 700,000.
Today, on the eve of the voting,
the Wisconsin camps of the three
principals each expressed confi
dence in the victory of their man.
