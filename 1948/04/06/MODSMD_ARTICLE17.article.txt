### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP).â€”
The armed services have proposed
making a permanent military reser
vation of a big segment of the Aleu
tian Islands lying principally be
tween Dutch Harbor and Attu, it
was learned today.
The Interior Department an
nounced that public hearing on the
Army-Navy-Air Forces request will
be held at Juneau, Alaska, May 4.
No explanation was given for the
proposal, which would withdraw al!
the specified areas from the status
of public lands and close them to
homesteading, exploration, mining,
and fishing.
THE HEARING notice said only
that the armed forces asked for per
manent withdrawal of the lands so
they could be used for military in
stallations and "defensive" air-sea
operations.
Alaskan Delegate E. L. Bartlee
said he has protested the scheme to
Secretary of the Interior J." A. Krug
and will oppose it at the Juneau
hearings unless the armed services
convince him that the withdrawals
are "essential in the interest of na
tional security."
"Lacking any information on that
point," he said, "I feel bound to ob
ject on behalf of the people of
Alaska."
THE ARMY and Air Force want
withdrawal of all of Adak and Great
Sitkin Islands and parts of Am
chitka, Atka, Shemya, Umnak. and
Unalaska Islands and land in the
Cold Bay area.
The Navy wants Attu, Shemya.
Tanaga. Adak. Great Sitkin, Unalca.
the Agattu Islands, the area sur
rounding Dutch Harbor, and a sec
tion of eastern Kodiak Island.
