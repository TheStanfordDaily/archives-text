# U.S. Proposes Tentative Plan For Palestine Trusteeship
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 5 (UP)—The United States proposed a ten
tative blueprint for an indefinite United Nations Palestine trustee
ship today by which specified states would agree in advance to
supply reinforcement troops if necessary.
The long-awaited American plan to replace the virtually
abandoned partition program pro- * —

vided for a governor-general ap- j
pointed by and responsible to UN |
trusteeship council which Russia <
has boycotted.
The governor-general would use ;
a locally recruited police force and j
an additional local volunteer con- j
tingent to maintain order. But if
these proved insufficient, he would
have power to call for help under
the contemplated UN trusteeship
agreement.
TIIE NEW United States formula i
did not suggest any specific states j
to take on the responsibility.
The American plan said the j
trusteeship should remain in force
indefinitely, but should be subject
to prompt termination whenever
the Arabs and Jews of Palestine 1
agreed on a government.
The plan urged that the trustee
ship should not prejudice the char
acter of the eventual Palestine gov
ernment. But the suggestion that
the majority of Palestine's Arabs j
would have to agree on any gov- i
ernment would virtually kill Jewish ;
hopes for a Jewish state.
THE AMERICAN blueprint was
unveiled at a closed meeting of se
curity council members in the
Manhattan offices of American Dele
gate Warren R. Austin. Russian
Delegate Andrei Gromyko and
Ukranian Delegate Vasily Tarsenko
failed to attend.
Both Jews and Arabs quickly
blasted the American proposal.
The Jewish Agency for Palestine
called the plan a scheme to place
the Jews under Arab domination.
Jamal el Husseini, vice chairman
of the Arab Higher Committee who
arrived in New York today, told
newsmen the Arabs of Palestine
would accept no plan that would
place them under a foreign group.
The United States hoped its plan
would draw ideas from the other j
council members and a multilateral
trusteeship plan would be ready for
presentation to the special Palestine
session of the general assembly when
it convenes April 16.
The general assembly will have
just one month to agree on a solu
tion for the Palestine dilemma be
fore the termination of the British j
mandate on May 15.
