## Council Reforms? 
### 
Once more the initiative has come from below.
A group of women, dissatisfied with the present set-up of
Women's Council, have proposed some recommendations which
seem both logical and more democratic.
First, they propose to have the members of Women's Council
elected from the five living districts rather than from the campus
at large. Considering that Excom several years ago adopted
living group representation as more coordinated and democratic
this would seem to be a worthwhile suggestion.
Women's Council members, elected at random from the cam
pus, cannot hope to have contact with the actual workings of
social regulations in each area. For example, at present three
members are from Lagunita and two from the Row. Branner,
Union Unit, and Roble are not represented at all.
Originally it was proposed that the chairmen of the various
committees (i.e. Row Committee of nine) comprise Women's
Council. Some felt this would put too much work on one woman
although this would certainly achieve the desired closer rela
tionship between Council and the women on campus. The pres
ent plan separates the two offices.
The chairmen of the committees would meet with Council
members at least once a week during the first part of the quarter.
No woman would be eligible to run for Women s Council, or
serve as a committee head, until she had wovked on a committee.
This part of the plan has two aspects. There is always danger
in a "continuous" series of jobs controlled by a small group.
This stipulation of previous service, however, might induce
more women to serve on the living group committees, which
are usually manned under protest, since there would be an op
portunity for advancement and greater prestige.
Under this new plan house presidents would promote dis
cussion about Council and committee policies after a report
from the committee representative.
The upshot of it all is that Council has been serving as an arbi
trary board of judgment without the knowledge of circumstances
in each case and each area that it needs to make a fair judgment.
Instead of just complaining one group has done something
about it. Their "reforms" will be coming before you soon.
Some changes do need to be made. Have you any to sug
cest? —M. H.
