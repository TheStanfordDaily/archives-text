# CAMPUS OPINION
## Let Him Come Forth 
### 
To the Editor:
For the past few months The Daily has been replete with Letters-to-
The-Editor condemning the action of the Stanford administration in
denying partisan political activity on campus.
Obviously and unfortunately, the administration's move has led to a
sort of political and ideological frustration among the students for it
is only in such academic atmosphere as Stanford that the future citizen
(the Stanford student) can give careful and unbiased analysis to con
temporary problems.
Campus elections are coming up in the next few weeks:
Surely among 8.000 students there can be found some candidate who
can devise some means of permitting "the winds of freedom to blow"
as The Daily editor put it last week.
Where is the candidate who will do this?
