## Atomic Sea Poisoning 
### 
ROME (UP)—Professor Giovanni Giorgi, Italy's
foremost authority on atomic energy, has concluded
there is no danger of an atomic chain reaction which
might cause the explosion of the earth.
He believes, however, that a real danger of poison
ing the sea and killing all marine life exists.
Author of many books on physics, mechanics, and
mathematics, and originator of the Giorgi electrical
unit system, the scientist said the explosion of huge
uranium bombs in the ocean would release deadly
radiation. Poisoning of the sea and the death of sea
life, if carried out on a large scale, would have grave
consequences on all life, he warned.
Giorgi, who is probably the world's greatest col
lector of sea shells as a hobby for relaxation from .
bard scientific studies, said:
"The oceans are the only source of life against
which man, who destroys everything on earth, has
not yet made many attempts. But this source, too,
immense and fruitful, will be threatened on the first
occasion by a potent poison."
He added that scientists have not devised any
means yet of preventing this possible poisoning
of marine life by uranium radiation. He paused a
moment, nodded his head and said:
"I see only one remedy—all other animals should
come to an agreement to hinder the human species
from destroying life."
Giorgi recalled that when the first experiments
in nuclear physics were made in Berlin for war
purposes, the "most fantastic" precautions were
taken to prevent the atomic flame in a laboratory
from setting afire all the adjacent atoms, setting
off the world like a great atomic bomb.
The French physicist and Nobel Prize winner,
Frederick Joliot, wrote several articles to allay the
alarm resulting from false reports and denied the
possibility of a planetary explosion. Joliot maintained
that the explosive phenomenon of the elements which
constitute the atomic bomb cannot propagate itself
to the other elements of the planet.
Giorgi said another illustrious scientist, Maurise
Karach, denied Joliot's theory and brought still
more confusion into the matter. Karach claimed that
science cannot exclude with certainty the possibility
of the explosion of the earth, because it had only
limited knowledge of the elements within the ter
restrial planet.
"As you see, these two scientists disagreed only
on absolute certainty," Giorgi said.
Giorgi, who maintains close contact with American
atom bomb scientists and with Albert Einstein, con
tinued:
"The danger that man may cause a planetary
catastrophe must be considered insufficient. It could
happen only when a large part of the terrestrial nu
cleus consisted of uranium. Such an existence could
be imagined only at very great depth. But how
could we set it when we cannot go into the bowels
of the earth deeper than three kilometers?"
Giorgi said modern science teaches that the earth
consists of a mass of non-metallic sediment for
hundreds of kilometers. Under the latter rind,
there is a central nucleus whose density is five
times that of water.
"From this degree of density," he said, "it must be
deduced that the great block of uranium does not
exist. We know that inside the earth planet is a
stratum of silicium and magnesium. There follows in
depth a large nucleus of ferric nickel, which is held
to be in a solid state with a temperature of about
300 degrees centigrade.
"Let us suppose, however, as a hypothesis, that
the block of uranium exists. Could the explosion
occur? Yes, but under the absolute condition that
it is a compact and purest block. The ordinary
uranium does not explode. Hence it would be
necessary for laboratories and colossal plants, to

descend into the depths of the earth and proceed
to purify the uranium.
"But let us be precise," the scientist concluded.
"Nobody can give the absolute mathematical cer
tainty that the event will not happen. Whoever
has read articles on high mathematics knows that
Ihe calculation of probabilities does not give the
finding as absolutely sure that even the sun will rise
tomorrow, although there exists a probability, ex
tremely near to certainty, that it will."
