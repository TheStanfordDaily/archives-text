## History 1948 
### 
There is an old American saying that if you don't
toot your own horn no one is going to toot it for
you. The truth of this axiom is well recognized by
the Soviet Union, which is tooting its horn loudly
and with considerable effect all over the world.
Russia has just reorganized the Comintern to add

to the clamor and is offering in
ducements to students from other
lands to study in Moscow, where
they are given better accommo
dations and better food than the
Russian students themselves re
ceive.
At the same time the U. S. horn
tooting abroad has been reduced
almost to a gurgle by the refusal
of Congress to appropriate suf
ficient funds for the State De-

partment's Information and Cultural Program, and
the dearth of dollars has cut almost in half the
number of foreign students who are residents of the
United States.
Pressure is being put on Congress, now, to pass a
bill authorizing a thirty-five million dollar a year
information program for the United States. This is,
in reality, a propaganda program of truth about our
country, which would be the "cheapest weapon" we
could use in combating communism abroad. Also, a
full program of student exchange would do much to
orientate foreigners to our way of life.
It certainly is paradoxical that the country which
has more newspapers than the rest of the world,
more radios and other means of communications, the
country where advertising is a major industry, should
not appreciate without argument the value of letting
"the American story" out to the rest of the world.
Here we are, engaged in an ideological struggle
with another powerful nation, and we are not using
the one weapon which should be most effective, the
one in which we are highly skilled. It certainly is
apparent that the Soviet is doing a bigger and better
job than wc are of selling its ideas of government.
It seems to me that Congress had better realize
these facts quickly and understand the need for an
information program to tell the truth about the
United States; certainly, no one is going to do the
telling for us.
