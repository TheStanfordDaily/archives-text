# French Artist Applies Reds to Stop Blues

### 
PARIS (UP) —When they have the blues, many
people tend to run to Ihe nearest dimly-lighted bar,
wilh its dark red leather seats and black tables.
Jacques Fillacier, a young French painter, finds the
problem not so simple.
"Some colors.'' he said, "have a definite effect
<m personality and moods. Perhaps the person who
seeks solace in a restaurant or bar decorated in red
would rccover much more quickly if he went to a
place painted brilliant blue or yellow.''
Fillacier, a member of the lamed school of Beaux
Arts in Paris, is going to one of Paris' largest insane
asylums to try out his theories.
The young painter will start redecorating the
whole place with an eye to the psychological and
medicinal properties of color.
"At the moment, when it comes to color conscious
ness, we are back in the Middle Ages," he said.
"Glove shops, living rooms, offices — all are
painted a cream color with brown decorations.
For all we know this may lie pleasant, or 011 the
contrary have a bad effect on the individuals who
go there. That is just what I want to find out."
One of Fillacier's theories which would shock con
ventional educators, is that classrooms should be
painted in strong dark colors instead of light cream
or white tones.
"Deep soft red or a forest green should be con
ducive to learning." he said. "If you have light

tones in a classroom, (lie student's mind wanders,
whereas if lie looks at a dark surface he lias to
concentrate on the hook in front of him."
In the insane asylum, called Ville-Evrard, there
is a special section for subnormal children. There
Fillacier plans to paint one classroom a deep green
and another soil scarlet. The walls will be of those
colors, with panels decorated with pictures.
"Alter six months, the doctors and I will make a
survey to see in which classroom the students ac
complish the most work." he said.
His experiments in color on the insane will include
painting window panes blues, violets, and green to
see if light affects different mental diseases.
"White," Fillacier said, "is a tone which makes
you wait. White is full of energy, hut it is waiting
for another color to start the motion. The most
awful thing imaginable, however, is a hospital
room in an insane asylum which is shiny.
"A person given to hallucinations can see forms
and shapes jumping over the wall each time he
moves or the light changes. I am sure that for very
sick people, flat white paint should be used on
the walls."
After the patient who enters the hospital staiT
to recover. Fillacier proposes a series of different
colored rooms which will accustom the patient to
normal balanced "color" life.
