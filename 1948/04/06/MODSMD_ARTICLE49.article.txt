# Rain Ruins First Week Of PCL Play; Seals Lead
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The opening week of activity in
the Coast League was curtailed
somewhat by intermittent rains
which forced postponement of seven
originally scheduled games. Only
Los Angeles and San Diego were
r.ble to complete a full seven-game
series.
The San Francisco Seals ran true
Io form by winning three straight 1
Irom Sacramento and then retired i
to the sidelines as the four remain- j
'jng games of the series were washed
out.
THE BEST PITCHING perform- j
r.nce of the week was tinned in by-
Seal hurler Tom Fine as he pitched
a two-hitter Thursday night to give !
San Francisco a 2-0 win. So mas- !
terful was his pitching that no Solon
advanced beyond second base.
The only other shutout of the j
week was on opening day when Roy
Helser of Portland whitewashed the |
Oaks.

San Diego took four out of seven
games from Los Angeles which gave
the Padres the series victory by the
odd game. San Diego dropped the
first two contests and then proceed
ed to win four in a row. Heavy hit
ting and poor pitching were the
rule as the Padres scored 51 runs to
48 for the Angels. Both LA and San
Diego will need improved hurling
if they expect to break into the first
division.
IN EMERYVILLE the OAKS came
to life after a slow start to gain an
even split in their six-game series
with Portland. Fenton IViole, Bea
ver first sacker, gave the fans a
thrill on Sunday when he blasted
out three consecutive home runs (an
unusual occurrence in PCL base
ball).
Down south the Hollywood Stars
used their power hitting to good ad
vantage as they copped an abbrevi
ated series from Seattle three games
to two. In the season's opener the
Stars garnered 17 runs off three Se
attle hurlers which included an
eight-run inning. With that kind of
hitting and the addition of two first
rate pitchers to the club, the Stars
will be tough to beat.
THIS WEEK the undefeated Seals
head south to meet Hollywood,
where O'Doul hopes his -pitching
staff will be able to throttle Kt>lle
her, Ross and Co. The Stars have
a preponderance of right - handed
hitters in their line-up. so O'Doul
plans to use right-handers on the
mound.
Oakland takes on the defending
champs, Los Angeles, at Emeryville.
The Oaks will be playing without
the services of Les Scarsella, who
V> r>s a badly bruised left hand.
"Scar" will be out of action indefi
nitely.
In other games Seattle plays at
Sacramento, and San Diego hosts
Portland.

The opening week of activity in
the Coast League was curtailed
somewhat by intermittent rains
which forced postponement of seven
originally scheduled games. Only
Los Angeles and San Diego were
r.ble to complete a full seven-game
series.
The San Francisco Seals ran true
Io form by winning three straight 1
Irom Sacramento and then retired i
to the sidelines as the four remain- j
'jng games of the series were washed
out.
THE BEST PITCHING perform- j
r.nce of the week was tinned in by-
Seal hurler Tom Fine as he pitched
a two-hitter Thursday night to give !
San Francisco a 2-0 win. So mas- !
terful was his pitching that no Solon
advanced beyond second base.
The only other shutout of the j
week was on opening day when Roy
Helser of Portland whitewashed the |
Oaks.

San Diego took four out of seven
games from Los Angeles which gave
the Padres the series victory by the
odd game. San Diego dropped the
first two contests and then proceed
ed to win four in a row. Heavy hit
ting and poor pitching were the
rule as the Padres scored 51 runs to
48 for the Angels. Both LA and San
Diego will need improved hurling
if they expect to break into the first
division.
IN EMERYVILLE the OAKS came
to life after a slow start to gain an
even split in their six-game series
with Portland. Fenton IViole, Bea
ver first sacker, gave the fans a
thrill on Sunday when he blasted
out three consecutive home runs (an
unusual occurrence in PCL base
ball).
Down south the Hollywood Stars
used their power hitting to good ad
vantage as they copped an abbrevi
ated series from Seattle three games
to two. In the season's opener the
Stars garnered 17 runs off three Se
attle hurlers which included an
eight-run inning. With that kind of
hitting and the addition of two first
rate pitchers to the club, the Stars
will be tough to beat.
THIS WEEK the undefeated Seals
head south to meet Hollywood,
where O'Doul hopes his -pitching
staff will be able to throttle Kt>lle
her, Ross and Co. The Stars have
a preponderance of right - handed
hitters in their line-up. so O'Doul
plans to use right-handers on the
mound.
Oakland takes on the defending
champs, Los Angeles, at Emeryville.
The Oaks will be playing without
the services of Les Scarsella, who
V> r>s a badly bruised left hand.
"Scar" will be out of action indefi
nitely.
In other games Seattle plays at
Sacramento, and San Diego hosts
Portland.
