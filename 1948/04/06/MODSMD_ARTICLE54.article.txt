# Indian Baseballers Tackle Santa Clara Tomorrow
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity baseballers meet Santa Clara tomorrow at
2:15 in the Sunken diamond. The Indians will be after their
second league win, and should deliver against the last-place
Broncos.
Santa Clara has had only one taste of league competition,

losing its initial encounter to St.
Mary's. Nicest thing said about the
Broncos so far this season is that
they have colorful uniforms.
COACH HARRY WOLTERS has
chosen pitcher Dave Stott to handle
the mound chores for Stanford to
morrow. Stott will be going for his
first win, having missed his chance
against UCLA in the opening game
of the season.
Rain halted last night's batting
and fielding drills, but the Cards
will go back to work this after
noon.
Stanford definitely needs a good
batting drill, as Cal hurler Nino
Barnise proved 'ast Saturday when
he set the regulars down with only
three hits.
808 PETERS, hustling second
baseman, has been lost to Stanford
for good. The scrappy Peters was
graduated at the end of winter
quarter, and is ineligible for fur
ther play. His loss will slow down
Stanford's polished infield, which
has been been rated one of the best
defensive units in the league.
Jim Mason will take over the va
cancy at second. Mason came
through in his debut against Cal
last Saturday when he collected one
of the three Tribe bingles.
EXPECTED TO BE back in uni
form against Santa Clara tomorrow
is catcher Frank MacGraw, who
missed the Cal game. Backstop Mac-
Graw missed the bus and never did
show up last Saturday in the game
against Cal.
Buck Brownson is being tabbed as
one of the best shortstops in the
CIBA loop. Brownson has been a
demon in the field, but his stick
work has not yet warmed up.
Tomorrow's contest will be the
13th of the year for Stanford, and
the Indians have a season record of
11 wins and two losses.


BUCK BIIOWNSON, fancy field
ing Card shortstop, will lie seen
'.n action tomorrow when Stan
ford (.lays its first home league
game.

CIBA loop. Brownson has been a
demon in the field, but his stick
work has not yet warmed up.
Tomorrow's contest will be the
13th of the year for Stanford, and
the Indians have a season record of
11 wins and two losses.


BUCK BIIOWNSON, fancy field
ing Card shortstop, will lie seen
'.n action tomorrow when Stan
ford (.lays its first home league
game.
