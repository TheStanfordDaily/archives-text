# Frosh Mermen In Three Meets
## 
### 
The strength of the frosh swim
ming team wil! be given its first real
test this week when Stanford meets
three strong opponents. Tomorrow
they meet Sequoia Union High
School, and on Friday they chal
lenge powerful Stockton Junior
College. The week's contests end on
Saturday when Stanford meets San
Francisco State.
Up to now, th frosh mermen have
faced only a single opponent, when
they easily overcame the San Jose
frosh, 45-30. The San Jose swim
mers did not press very hard, so the
Stanford boys were not forced to
show their best times.
The swimmers who have shown
the most promise are backstroker
Don Weeden, who has been timed at
1:47.6 for 150 yards; sprinters Don
Patch, Chuck Kelly, and Hub
Stokely, all of whom have done the
50-yard sprint under 25.5; and dis
tance men John Mowat and Junius
Millard. Mowat showed excellent
ability when he posted the outstand
ing time of 2:20 for 220 yards.
