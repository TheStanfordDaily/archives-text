## Thru Breier's Pipe

Yesterday football teams up and down the Coast started what is
known as spring football. Each year at this time coaches cast a hopeful ;
over footballers of various sizes and abilities. Out of a large number j
of boys, such as the 132 head coach Marchie Schwartz now commands, j
the the hardest job of the spring session is to separate, as the saying goes.
Except for a few men out for other sports, the core of the next year's
varsity is before the head man. He must plan his style ol play around ,
this material. He must instill in them the desire to play football—his
style of football.
Last spring some important men were missing from the drills. Without ,
mentioning names we can point to some of the individual play oi persons
who went out for other sports during spring football practice. The lack
of real tackling and blocking ability on the part of these men hurt the j
team last fall.
ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW, and one that Mr. Schwartz holds, is
that with Stanford's present lack of athletes, any lad who can make the
varsity in another sport should be allowed to do so. "We have to share
the men, spread the talent around," commented Marchie.
A very charitable point of viey we might add and one that is highly I
complimentary to the man.
But let us point out that Stanford is hurting in football. A series ol
bad breaks coupled with some near losses gave Stanford its most disas
trous season last year and, contrary to the general belief, we did not
gain much by junior college transfers.
An afternoon San Francisco paper yesterday hinted that after the worst
football season in the school's history, Stanford indulged in a wild prose
lytizing spree that has brought numerous athletes to the school to redeem ;
lost prestige.

ONE QLOT E I) STATEMENT
charged that Stanford "out USCed in
even its palmier days."
Actually Mentor Schwartz has but
about eight JC transfers who can
add much to the squad. Last year
he had even more and some of those
boys were even more highly publi
cized. It is a long step from JC
ball to college play and relatively
few men make the grade the first
year. Only three of eleven aided
the cause much last year.
Up from last year's frosh come
five lads, maybe more, who can
contribute much to the 194S Big Red
Machine. Possibly four or five men
from the junior varsity can cut
next year's varsity.
Twenty-eight out of 3S lettermen
will be back. Of the 10 men lost—
Dick Flatland. Ainslee Bell, and
George Quist were regulars. In ad-

dition to these. Harry Ferris, Sid Smith. John Clark. Marty Feldman, and
Pete August will be missing from the line. Fullback Chuck Coker has
used up his eligibility and it is doubtful that quarterback A 1 Morris can
win his fight to be declared eligible after playing one year for San
Francisco JC and two for Stanford. That remains to be seen.
EIGHT OF THE 11 STARTERS of the memorial 1947 Big Game should
be back. Five of these will be line men. Other transfers who have
become eligible and might well become varsity men are Emery Mitchell,
Bud Cline, Don Stamm. and Gene Matrewitz from Purdue.
A look at the schedule shows that the Schwartzmen will have no easy
way of it come September. Instead of nine games, 10 have been scheduled.
Idaho, Michigan, and Oregon State will be missing with San Jose State.
Washington State, Army, and Montana being added. San Jose State's
Spartans will come to Stanford for the opener loaded for bear, or Indian
in this case. Let us here put forth the warning to look out for this one.
The boys could easily be looking over the Spartans for the trip to the
Palouse country to play Washington State.
OTHER TEAMS CARDED ARE OREGON, Santa Clara. Washington.
UCLA. USC. and California. It is not an easy schedule. Stanford could
do well next year if the team settles down during this spring practice
and learns to really tackle and block and get into condidtion. Injuries
hurt the Cards last year, and in the humble opinion of this writer, many
of these injuries can be avoided by conditioning a la Notre Dame.
Now, during the 30 days of spring practice, is the time to start.
Eighteen days after the first practice session on Sept. 1. 194.8. comes the
first contest. That time cannot be spent in fundamentals, complex plays
must be mastered. Let's not hear the crv of "back to fundamentals on
Sept. 19, 1948."
