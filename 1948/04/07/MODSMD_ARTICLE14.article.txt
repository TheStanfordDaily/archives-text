# Soft Coal Operators To Talk With Lewis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON- April 6 (UP)- Soft coal operators tonight
agreed to meet with John L. Lewis tomorrow to seek a solution
of the 24-day-old mine strike, but not on his terms.
They notified Lewis and his United Mine Workers that they
were agreeable to a 2:30 p.m. meeting tomorrow. But they said

the meeting would be attended only
by operator representatives already
participating in the negotiations.
Lewis had demanded that the
meeting be attended by Benjamin F.
Fairless, president of United States
Sleel Corp., and George M. Hum
phrey, president of Pittsburgh Con
solidation Coal Co.
The operators replied:
"It is not within your province or
authority to choose the persons who
represent the coal operators in col
lective bargaining. It is the opera
tors' responsibility to select their
bargaining representation."
Lewis had suggested tomorrow's
meeting, with the Fairless - Hum
phrey string attached, in rejecting
a proposal by the operators that he
confer with them today.
The operators said Lewis' sugges
tion was "plainly evasive of your
duty and responsibility to comply
forthwith with a mandate of the
federal district court."
