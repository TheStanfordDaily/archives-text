## ERP—Our Concern 
### 
What is the Marshall Plan—and why should we give a hoot?
The first part of the question will be answered quite well by
a series of articles in the editorial columns to the right, beginning
today.
Some practical reasons why we are concerned are set down
here.
Just a month ago many leaders in Congress said frankly
they did not know how their constituents wanted them to vote.
They had received very little correspondence on the ERP.
Somehow a nation of people who would write their congress
men on the least provocation had become very silent —on the
most important legislation of the century. Other leaders com
mented sadly that people did not seem very well-informed on
the subject.
Nov/ that Congress has passed the measure we think it is
more important than ever for everyone—above all university
students-—to know something about the multi-billion dollar
program which ties the United States so closely to European
destiny.
The Rusians thought ERP important enough to blot it off the
news pages by raising a fuss in Berlin. Because of the Berlin
trouble European newspapers buried the news of the final
passage of the Marshall Plan to inside pages. Two English papers
caried not a single line about the greatest gift of modern times.
Ward Matthews of the New York Times foreign bureau said
he believed the Russians raised the blockade trouble deliberately
to drown out ERP news. He pointed out there was no real
crisis—iood trains were allowed to pass.
Well, if it's that important to Uncle Joe, maybe we had better
learn all we can about European Recovery. —T. S.
