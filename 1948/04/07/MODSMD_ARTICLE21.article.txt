# Blackout in Peacetime?
## 
### 
It is not as far-fetched as you may think. The new power
czar has told Stanford to cut its electricity consumption by 20
per cent or else. That "or else" means he has the authority to
pull the switch on all power at the University.
Stanford Village has already taken the lead in conservation.
The University has sent letters to living groups asking coopera
tion.
But the ability to save electricity rests finally with every
member of the Stanford family. It is a voluntary program, along
With water rationing, but it must be carried out successfully.
