## AVC on the Skids? 
### 
To the Editor:
For six quarters I have been attending Stanford I have been a member
of the Stanford chapter of the American Veterans Committee.
This is a wonderful organization which has done good work through
out the country for veterans' housing, etc., but here on the campus we
have confined our action to talking. For many months now I have tried
to convince the members of this chapter that in order to grow we needed
a program of action which would interest the students; but to date
I have failed.
AVC here has not grown and now is on the verge of becoming a
defunct organization. Therefore, I, as an individual, am • writing this
in the hope that some interested veterans will let us know what they
expect and would like to see AVC do.
