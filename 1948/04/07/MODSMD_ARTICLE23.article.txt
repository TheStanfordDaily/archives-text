# Anybody Lost an Overcoat?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
On March 22 I gave a young man a ride in my car from San Fernando
to Castaic, California, along U. S. Highway 99. When he got out at
the town of Castaic, he left his overcoat in my car and I did not find
it until some hours later Although I do not know his name, I know
enough about him to probably locate him and return his coat.
The man is a graduate of The Catholic University of America, Wash
ington, D. C., majored in drama. At the present time he is attending
Stanford University, taking graduate courses in psychology. Don't you
think that these two facts would limit him to a very small group that
could be reached by the notice? Thank you very much for your coopera
tion
