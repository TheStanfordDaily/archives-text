WASHINGTON (UP)—What is the Marshall Plan?
When the hundreds of millions of words and figures
are distilled, the administration's answer is this:
It is a multi-billion dollar American program for
helping Europe help itself back to economic health.
It is a plan to save non-communist Europe from
communism.
It is a plan to stop Russian expansionism short
of war—with economic rather than military measures.
It is a procedure for priming the European
economic pump with major emphasis on coopera
tive self help by the Europeans themselves.
It is not just another relief program. Although
it will keep a lot of the 270,000,000 Western Europeans
from starving, it involves also huge sums of money
for raw materials, machinery, locomotives, steel and
other capital equipment.
It is a plan which (he administration and its lead
ing supporters in Congress hope will stop World
War 111 before it starts.
It is a plan to stabilize Eui'ope, first economically
and then politically. Until such stability is estab
lished. the administration has abandoned all hope of
negotiating a German or Japanese peace settlement
with the Russians.
The plan is not considered charity. But little,
if any of (he money will be returned directly. The
plan is said to be of vital self interest to the U. S.
because "a free, stable and productive community
of nations in Europe" is essential to American se
en rity.
That is a streamlined summary of the adminis
tration's complicated argument for the Marshall Plan,
which is officially known as the European Recovery
Program (ERP).
It envisages an estimated American investment of
about 817,000,000,000 over a period of 4'i years.
Expenditures under it are expected to decrease
during the years of operation eventually to nothing,
but during (lie first year they will be at (lie rate
of 5440.000.000 a month.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall, whose
name adorns the plan, explained the historic project
in simple terms when he tossed out the idea on
June 5, 1947, in a speech at Harvard University.
lie cited the disastrous effects of the war on (he
"fabric" of European economy; the failure of Eu
rope (o recover (o dale despite 5i2.000.000.000 in
American pic-ccmcal pos(-war help. He concluded
that it would take another three or four years of
intensive help by the United States and extensive
work by the Europeans themselves to put Europe
back on its feet.
Marshall then electrified Western Europe and put a
chain of events into operation by stating:
"Before the United States government con pro
ceed much further in its efforts to alleviate the
situation and help start the European world on its
way to recovery, there must be some agreement
among the countries of Europe as to the require
ments of the situation and the parts those countries
themselves will take in order to give proper effect
to whatever action might be undertaken by the gov
ernment. ...
"The initiative must come from Europe. The
role of this country should consist of friendly aid."
When Marshall made his offer, the door was open
to all of Europe, including Russia to participate.
But Russia elected to stay out, thus eliminating
what might have been an emabarrassing situation
for Marshall. If the Russians had agreed to partici
pate, it is doubtful that Congress could have been
persuaded to appropriate billions for the project.
But, nevertheless, i( started out that way. And
the Russians—by walking out —converted the plan
overnight into a program for Western Europe and
one to resist communism.
« Marshall was relatively certain in advance the
Russians would not accept his proposal. His first
experience in Big Four diplomacy at Moscow last
spring had convinced him the Russians did not
want stability in Europe—either economic or political.
Therefore, at Harvard, Marshall carefully defined
his objectives—and conditions:
"Our policy is directed not against any country
or doctrine bill against hunger, poverty, despera
tion, and chaos.
Its purpose should be the revival of a working
economy in the world so as to permit the emergence
of political and social conditions in which free insti
tutions can exist. . . .
"Any government which maneuvers to block the
recovery of other countries cannot expect help
from us.
"Furthermore, governments, political parties, or
groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in
older to profit therefrom politically or otherwise
will encounter the opposition of the United States."
That s how it all started on a warm June day
at Harvard.
