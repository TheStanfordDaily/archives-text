HONGKONG (UP)—Hongkong may become the
first city in the Far East to eliminate the age-old
rickshaw as transportation.

been found satisfactory after police tests. About
150 will be imported if official foreign exchange can
be arranged, according to the assistant superintendent
of police. Geoffrey Binslead.
The "rikmobile" resembles the three-wheeled mo
torcycles which American firms use for deliveries.
Two passengers are seated behind the driver and
are protected from the weather by a plexiglass hood.
It does up to 35 miles per hour and makes 70 miles
