Sometimes the most interesting stories that come
over The Daily's leased wire from United Press are
those which can't be printed, either because they
aren't printable (that kind we paste up on the walls
of the Shack), because they're not newsworthy, or
for lack of space.
Note this flash:
The Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory of
Arizona State College at Tempe has made a numbei
of enlightening studies on that native southwestern
reptile, the Gila (pronounced, Heeluh) Monster,
known in Latin as Heloderma suspectum.
The dictionary says that an allied form, H. hor
ridum, is found in Mexico and is also poisonous.
Neither cousin is related to the Gila Woodpecker,
Centurus uropygialis.
Investigators listed (in what we consider inverse
order of probability for the simple reason that there
must be more individuals in the last group) the
types of persons who are most likely to be bitten
by the animals:
"1. Laboratory workers who handle the Gila Mon
sters so frequently they get careless.
"2. Visitors who are attracted by the brightly col
ored lizard and pick it up.
"And 3. those who are just plain foolish."
Fat and sluggish, "decorated by a gaudy coat of
beady orange and black scales," the reptiles are not
the sizeable giants most of us think they are. They
are seldom more than 16 inches long and only the
largest have enough venom to kill a human being
(or facsimilies thereof).
All of which may be of some satisfaction if you
should fall into one of the categories mentioned
above. Maybe.
For those of you who have debated the question
and for those of you who up to this time have just
never given a damn, they do have teeth. These den
tures feed poison from pockets in their lower jaws
into whatever portion of your anatomy they happen
to latch very securely onto.
No matter how securely they've latched, this old
bunk about having to cut oft' their heads to make
them let go ain't so. "Just slit either side of the
li-card's jay and it will relax its grip," the experts
said.
Or (if your knife happens to be in the wrong
pocket—or you've come unprepared—and your lighter
or matches are handy) just hold a little fire under
its belly. It'll let go. The release makes the un
cautious statement, ". . . and it will soon let go." (And
wouldn't you!)
Well, that's it, thanks to UP: The latest dope on
how to be bitten by Heloderma suspectum and what
to do about it; all you need is a knife, matches, and
not to be color blind.
Or to be in Arizona—they are seldom found in
the Bay Area.

to do about it; all you need is a knife, matches, and
not to be color blind.
Or to be in Arizona—they are seldom found in
the Bay Area.
Sometimes the most interesting stories that come
over The Daily's leased wire from United Press are
those which can't be printed, either because they
aren't printable (that kind we paste up on the walls
of the Shack), because they're not newsworthy, or
for lack of space.
Note this flash:
The Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory of
Arizona State College at Tempe has made a numbei
of enlightening studies on that native southwestern
reptile, the Gila (pronounced, Heeluh) Monster,
known in Latin as Heloderma suspectum.
The dictionary says that an allied form, H. hor
ridum, is found in Mexico and is also poisonous.
Neither cousin is related to the Gila Woodpecker,
Centurus uropygialis.
Investigators listed (in what we consider inverse
order of probability for the simple reason that there
must be more individuals in the last group) the
types of persons who are most likely to be bitten
by the animals:
"1. Laboratory workers who handle the Gila Mon
sters so frequently they get careless.
"2. Visitors who are attracted by the brightly col
ored lizard and pick it up.
"And 3. those who are just plain foolish."
Fat and sluggish, "decorated by a gaudy coat of
beady orange and black scales," the reptiles are not
the sizeable giants most of us think they are. They
are seldom more than 16 inches long and only the
largest have enough venom to kill a human being
(or facsimilies thereof).
All of which may be of some satisfaction if you
should fall into one of the categories mentioned
above. Maybe.
For those of you who have debated the question
and for those of you who up to this time have just
never given a damn, they do have teeth. These den
tures feed poison from pockets in their lower jaws
into whatever portion of your anatomy they happen
to latch very securely onto.
No matter how securely they've latched, this old
bunk about having to cut oft' their heads to make
them let go ain't so. "Just slit either side of the
li-card's jay and it will relax its grip," the experts
said.
Or (if your knife happens to be in the wrong
pocket—or you've come unprepared—and your lighter
or matches are handy) just hold a little fire under
its belly. It'll let go. The release makes the un
cautious statement, ". . . and it will soon let go." (And
wouldn't you!)
Well, that's it, thanks to UP: The latest dope on
how to be bitten by Heloderma suspectum and what
to do about it; all you need is a knife, matches, and
not to be color blind.
