We students have just about forgotten the mean
ing of individual attention in regards to instruction
because of the overcrowded classes. Stanford in
structors hold office hours to advise or aid students
in their studies. But outsfde of that service, little
attention is devoted to the individual unless he goes

minus or is put on scholastic pro
bation.
The University offers deficient
students any corrective aid pos
sible to make up a grade deficit.
The big break for troubled men
and women rests in the hands of
the resident advisors in all of the
living dorms and houses. Resident
advisers for men work from
Shelton Beatty's office of the
counselor for men. All arc grad
luates, but their previous exper-

ience in leadership, personnel work, and in former
jobs is the factor that determines their fitness for
the job.
When Joe Blow goes minus 15 or 20 in one quarter,
Beatty sends a photostatic copy of Joe's record to
his resident adviser. The adviser checks with Joe
to see if the trouble can be straightened out. In
many cases Joe will snap out of it by reading pamph
lets such as "Practical Study Aids" or "How to Read
Rapidly and Well" and practicing what he learned.
Where study habits may be satisfactory, occupa
tional guidance and vocational analysis services may
iron out the deficiency.
Encina resident advisors have a central library in
the dorm's main office designed to equip them tor
vocational analysis, occupational guidance, inter
pretation of the Strong Vocational Test, and im
provement on reading rate and comprehension.
Throughout the crisis, the minus student is urged
to call on Beatty or his adviser for help. With years
of schooling and outside experience behind them,
the advisers pool their knowledge and University
assistance to improve a student's scholastic record.
In the case of the fraternities, advisers check to see
if the house itself cannot aid the deficient student.
Self help keynotes the whole program; students
are not expected to be summoned by Beatty or an
advisor. Deficient students know they are in hot
water, and they are told that the University offers
all the aid it can to cool the situation.
