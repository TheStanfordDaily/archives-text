# Varsity Nine Meets Santa Clara Today
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's defensive - minded In
dians are set to take on the invad
ing Santa Clara Broncos today at
3:15 in the Sunken Diamond. The
Cards will be slight favorites to beat
the last-place Broncos and pick up
their second league win.
Today's game will be the first
chance local baseball fans have had
to see the varsity in CIBA league
action.
THE INDIANS have already per
formed in three loop contests, but
they got off to a disappointing start
on foreign fields when they split
two games with UCLA and lost a
single game to Cal.
Stanford's season record stands
now at one win and two losses. The
Tribe is resting in the next-to-last
spot in conference standings, just
one jump ahead of the Broncos who
are last with no wins and one loss.
DAVE STOTT has been named as
the starting pitcher for Stanford. He
has a good chance of turning in his
first win today. Stanford needs a
victory to get back into the league
race.
Santa Clara has been hot and cold
this season. They played great ball
in spring practice, almost knocking
J off the San Francisco Seals. But
j then they folded to lose their first
| league contest to St. Mary's.
Stanford has a better ballclub
than loop standings indicate. The
t Indians simply haven't been hitting.
In three contests they have collected
only 16 hits in 94 times at bat for a
.170 team batting average.
They are sur§ to improve upon
that kind of sour stickwork in fu
ture games.
TED NELL, trigger - fast center
fielder, will be leadofT man in the
batting order. Nell is a sharp hit
ter, is dangerous on the base paths,
and covers his center garden with
efficiency. His CIBA batting aver
age is only .125, but it should be
I climbing any time now.
CHARLIE COLE, batting second,
is a smooth fielding first sacker. He
j has been slow in getting his bat
I warmed up, and has not yet collect
| ed his first hit.
FRANK MacGRAW, burly 205-


FRANK MacGRAW, veteran catcher, will handle the slants of lanky
Dave Stott this afternoon when the Indians and Broncs tangle on the
Sunken Diamond.
