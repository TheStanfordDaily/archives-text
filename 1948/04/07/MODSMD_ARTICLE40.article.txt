# Frosh Swimmers Face Sequoia High
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman swimming
team returns to the water lanes af
ter a month of inactivity this after
noon to take on Sequoia Higli
School's paddlers in a dual meet at
the Encina Pools. The competition
gets under way at 3 p.m.
Sequoia High always turns out a
strong swimming team, and is the
perennial favorite in Peninsula Ath
letic League water competition. This
year's Sequoia squad is a well
rounded aggregation capable of giv
ing the Farm frosh plenty of trouble
in many races.
The Card yearlings are strong in
the sprints and middle distance
events, but will have to concede
points in diving. They also lack
depth in the breaststroke and back
stroke events.
