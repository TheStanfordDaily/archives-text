# Spartans Looked Strong Against OC; Face Cards
## 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
Despite the poor weather this week making Angell Field very
soft, the Stanford varsity has been working out on the inside
track in preparation for this Saturday's crucial tussle with San
Jose State.
The Spartans showed great ability in practically every event

last week as they trounced the*
Olympic Club, 95 to 36. at the San j
Jose field.
It is true that a few of the best
clubmen did not compete against
San Jose, but even these stars, such
as pole vaulter Guinn Smith, shot
putter Jim Delaney, and javelin- j
thrower Martin Biles, could not turn
the Spartan tide.
SAN JOSE'S ACE sprinter, Don
Smalley, turned in a double win by
winning the 100-yard dash in 9.9
seconds and capturing the 220 in
21.8 seconds. Teammates Bingham
and O'Meara were just one yard
behind Smalley in the 220, while j
Bingham also placed second in the
century. This gives the Spartans
good strength in the dashes.
In the 440 San Jose's Fred Man
gini just did edge out Olympic '
Club's Mode Perry to win the event
in the comparatively slow time of
51.1 seconds. However, one must !
remember that the track was in a ,
slow condition because of the pre
vious day's rain.
THELNO KNOWLES, San Jose
880 star, was clocked at 1:56.2 in the
half-mile run, to beat OC s Kearney
by 15 yards. This is particularly
good early season time, and
Konwles will be tough to beat.
A new school record was set in the :
mile by Spartan Gene Haynes, who
circled the four laps in 4:21.5. :
Haynes probably could give USC's
Olympic hope. Roland Sink, a good,
race.
The two-mile was San Josfe's only
losing running event, in fact, the
Spartans were shut out, This seems
to be one of the few events in which
the Spartans are weak, although all
three of the Olympic Club runners j
were fairly fast.
Eighteen of San Jose's points
were grabbed in the hurdles, as the
Spartans swept both the highs and
the lows. The Olympic Club was
very poor in both events, but Jack
Passey's time of 14.8 in the highs:
speaks for itself.
IN TIIE FIELD the Spartans' best
event is probably the discus. Ray
Overhouse has thrown the platter
157 ft. in two meets. He is given able
support by teammate Linn (153' ;
lG'i;"). who also heaved the shot.
47' 8".
Constant ine Varneck won the,
broad jump and tied for first place
in the high jump for the Spartans.
His 6' 2" high jump tied him with
Morgan, the other Spartan ace. This
gives them two good men in this I
event.
In the pole vault, Howard vermire.
In the pole vault, Howard Over
mire, brother of Ray Overmire, who
Teammate Lankas tied for second
place, clearing 13 I't. against the
Olympic Club.

Despite the poor weather this week making Angell Field very
soft, the Stanford varsity has been working out on the inside
track in preparation for this Saturday's crucial tussle with San
Jose State.
The Spartans showed great ability in practically every event

last week as they trounced the*
Olympic Club, 95 to 36. at the San j
Jose field.
It is true that a few of the best
clubmen did not compete against
San Jose, but even these stars, such
as pole vaulter Guinn Smith, shot
putter Jim Delaney, and javelin- j
thrower Martin Biles, could not turn
the Spartan tide.
SAN JOSE'S ACE sprinter, Don
Smalley, turned in a double win by
winning the 100-yard dash in 9.9
seconds and capturing the 220 in
21.8 seconds. Teammates Bingham
and O'Meara were just one yard
behind Smalley in the 220, while j
Bingham also placed second in the
century. This gives the Spartans
good strength in the dashes.
In the 440 San Jose's Fred Man
gini just did edge out Olympic '
Club's Mode Perry to win the event
in the comparatively slow time of
51.1 seconds. However, one must !
remember that the track was in a ,
slow condition because of the pre
vious day's rain.
THELNO KNOWLES, San Jose
880 star, was clocked at 1:56.2 in the
half-mile run, to beat OC s Kearney
by 15 yards. This is particularly
good early season time, and
Konwles will be tough to beat.
A new school record was set in the :
mile by Spartan Gene Haynes, who
circled the four laps in 4:21.5. :
Haynes probably could give USC's
Olympic hope. Roland Sink, a good,
race.
The two-mile was San Josfe's only
losing running event, in fact, the
Spartans were shut out, This seems
to be one of the few events in which
the Spartans are weak, although all
three of the Olympic Club runners j
were fairly fast.
Eighteen of San Jose's points
were grabbed in the hurdles, as the
Spartans swept both the highs and
the lows. The Olympic Club was
very poor in both events, but Jack
Passey's time of 14.8 in the highs:
speaks for itself.
IN TIIE FIELD the Spartans' best
event is probably the discus. Ray
Overhouse has thrown the platter
157 ft. in two meets. He is given able
support by teammate Linn (153' ;
lG'i;"). who also heaved the shot.
47' 8".
Constant ine Varneck won the,
broad jump and tied for first place
in the high jump for the Spartans.
