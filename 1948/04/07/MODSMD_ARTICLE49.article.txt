# Art Students, Faculty Show Best of Past Year
## 
### 
From nude oil paintings to ultra
modern gas station models, the cur
rent annual student-faculty exhibit
•it the Art Gallery is representative
of the outstanding work done in the
various art departments during the
. ast year. The display, arranged by
Art Professors Mendelowitz and
Thompson, has been given for a
number of years.
Major emphasis is accorded the
sketching, watercolor, and oils de
partments. Figure drawings and
still like sketches line the foyer at
the entrance to the gallery, with
action poses and seated figures pre
dominating. Remarkable for its
brief completeness is the line study
of a man by art student Clayton
Rippey. A male torso in black and
white on blue is also penciled with
unusual skill.
TIIE WATERCOLOR presenta
tions are well drawn and seemingly
Jack nothing but number. Of the
few on exhibition, particular men
tion is due Professor Mendelo
witz' most recent study of the bleak
Dumbarton Flats. This locale is a
tavorite subject of Mr. Mendelo
witz, who always instills into his
treatments of the scene a somber,
suspended quality that adds to the
over-all effect. Joan Trautman, a
student, hps created a pleasing snow
spene, and faculty member James
'Lawrence has submitted two
thoughtful canvases.
Just before the oils corner is a
sculpture and design display includ
ing a number of wood carvings and
some bright, ingenious design pat
terns. Especially eye-catching is the
print of pretty blond and brunette
aeads.
One of the most outstanding
paintings in the oils collection is the
.striking view of a large tree stump
ny Prof. Edward Farmer. Expert
use of color and detail make the

picture vivid and arresting. John
La Plante, also of the faculty, has
two impressively unrealistic works
in the group, one a luminously
green head crossed by off - white
ribbon.
A STIFF PORTRAIT in oils by
Mendelowitz scarcely compares with
his fine technique in watercolors.
Among the several treatments of the
same nude model, art major William
English accomplishes the smoothest
and truest portrayal. An attractive
California countryside scene on dis
play was done by student Charles
Holman.
A number of other departments
have student - faculty achievements
on exhibition. The architectural de
sign section includes several hotel
resort plans and a modular home
layout. A streamlined auto model
by Grove Miller Jr. is the interest
ing highlight of the industrial de
sign exhibit. A. C. Prentice Jr. was
given the top grade in the furniture
design group for his molded ply
wood arrangement. Various wood
models of Palo Alto comprise the
city planning display.
The gas stations of the future and
some cleverly contrived modernistic
homes are part of the architectural
planning department. A full set of
architectural plans by Professor
Thompson completes the show. — D.

tions are well drawn and seemingly
Jack nothing but number. Of the
few on exhibition, particular men
tion is due Professor Mendelo
witz' most recent study of the bleak
Dumbarton Flats. This locale is a
tavorite subject of Mr. Mendelo
witz, who always instills into his
treatments of the scene a somber,
suspended quality that adds to the
over-all effect. Joan Trautman, a
student, hps created a pleasing snow
spene, and faculty member James
'Lawrence has submitted two
thoughtful canvases.
Just before the oils corner is a
sculpture and design display includ
ing a number of wood carvings and
some bright, ingenious design pat
terns. Especially eye-catching is the
print of pretty blond and brunette
aeads.
One of the most outstanding
paintings in the oils collection is the
.striking view of a large tree stump
ny Prof. Edward Farmer. Expert
use of color and detail make the

picture vivid and arresting. John
La Plante, also of the faculty, has
two impressively unrealistic works
in the group, one a luminously
green head crossed by off - white
ribbon.
A STIFF PORTRAIT in oils by
Mendelowitz scarcely compares with
his fine technique in watercolors.
Among the several treatments of the
same nude model, art major William
English accomplishes the smoothest
and truest portrayal. An attractive
California countryside scene on dis
play was done by student Charles
Holman.
A number of other departments
have student - faculty achievements
on exhibition. The architectural de
sign section includes several hotel
resort plans and a modular home
layout. A streamlined auto model
by Grove Miller Jr. is the interest
ing highlight of the industrial de
sign exhibit. A. C. Prentice Jr. was
given the top grade in the furniture
design group for his molded ply
wood arrangement. Various wood
models of Palo Alto comprise the
city planning display.
The gas stations of the future and
some cleverly contrived modernistic
homes are part of the architectural
planning department. A full set of
architectural plans by Professor
Thompson completes the show. — D.

From nude oil paintings to ultra
modern gas station models, the cur
rent annual student-faculty exhibit
•it the Art Gallery is representative
of the outstanding work done in the
various art departments during the
. ast year. The display, arranged by
Art Professors Mendelowitz and
Thompson, has been given for a
number of years.
Major emphasis is accorded the
sketching, watercolor, and oils de
partments. Figure drawings and
still like sketches line the foyer at
the entrance to the gallery, with
action poses and seated figures pre
dominating. Remarkable for its
brief completeness is the line study
of a man by art student Clayton
Rippey. A male torso in black and
