# Water Rationing Needed Despite Recent Rains
## 
### 
Recent rains have not eliminated \
the need for continuance of the vol- j
untary water rationing program at i
Stanford, it was announced yester- '
day by University Business Mana- j
ger Alt E. Brandin.
In asking continued co-operation i
of campus residents in the ration
ing program, which limits watering j
by residents and the University |
alike to specific hours in stated j
areas, Brandin explained that the
rains have been a help but have j
not solved the water shortage prob- I
lem.
Felt Lake is now about half full
and Searsville Lake is two-thirds
ful, but this is far short of the sup
ply needed to meet the campus
needs for irrigation water and wa
ter for fire protection purposes.
He pointed out that the campus j
drinking water comes from wells i
and can be supplemented, if neces
sary, from Hetch-Hetchy supplies
or new wells, a condition which i
does not affect the irrigation water j
supply, which comes entirely from j
the two lakes.
Since the regular consumption of |
irrigation water on the campus is j
about 15 million gallons a week, the j

current supply would last only
about 10 weeks, Brandin pointe
out, in emphasizing the need fo:
continuance of the voluntary wate:
rationing program.
Meanwhile, the University con
tinued its efforts to supplement the
water supply with new wells. One
well, sunk near the Old Red Barn,
was put down 580 feet before it hit
bedrock and had to be abandoned
Another well is now being sunk
some 400 yards off Searsville Road
about half-way between the Car
negie Division of Biology laboratory
and the old gardeh school. This
second well is now down to about
70 feet.
