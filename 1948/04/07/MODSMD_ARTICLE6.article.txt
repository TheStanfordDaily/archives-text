# Italian Reds Vote Protest Strike
## 
### 
ROME, April 6 (UP).—The Com
munist-dominated Labor Confeder
ation today accused the government
of complicity in the murder of 36
Sicilian Leftists and ordered a one
hour protest strike by 6.000.000 Ital
ian workers on April 12.
The strike, voted by the Confed
eration executive committee, would
come just six days before the inter
nationally important Italian elec
tions.
Since the committee rejected a
proposal to strike for one cay in
stead of one hour, some observers
believed the Communists would not
resort to an organized campaign of
violence.
Government circles felt, however,
that the Reds had merely delayed
their labor agitation until the "right
moment.''
Violence continued throughout It
aly today. Ten persons were injured
in Naples tonight in a series of
clashes between Communists and
truck - borne members of the ex
treme right - wing National Union
Youth Movement. Riot squads re
stored order.
