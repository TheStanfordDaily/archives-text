# Orchesis Will Interpret Ancient Court Dances
## 
### 
Orchesis members will present
the first performance of their spring
dance concert tonight at 8:15 in Me
morial Auditorium. The concert, an
all-student production, will be given
again Saturday night.
Orchesis members have developed
original modern interpretations of
15th and 16th century court dances
which will be featured in the con
cert under the direction of Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, director of dance.
To illustrate the dance forms on
which the rest of the program is
based, the concert will open with a
suite of four "authentic" court
dances.
ONE OF THE MOST HUMOROUS
numbers is "Spiritus Fermenti,"
adapted from an earthy peasant
dance performed during the grape
harvest. The dancers appear as
peasants who dump the grapes into
a huge vat and proceed to crush
them into wine with their bare feet
to the music of the bourree.
Among the serious numbers on
the program are "Compromise," de
picting a man's struggle to overcome
his self - centered nature and get
along with the world; "Journey of
Moralia," describing a medieval trip
from piety into the realm of world

\ ly transgression, and a return of the ;
\ devout one; and "Deadline," built j
; on the frustrations of meeting given i
dates.
THE FIN ALE WILL CLOSE with
! a lively group composition. "'Round
up." danced to a medley of cowboy
tunes. Opening with a feeling of j
| the square dance, the finale, set j
against a backdrop of vivid Western
j mountains and cacti, develops into |
I a fast-moving rodeo.
The concert will be presented to
the public without charge.
Orchesis is the Stanford honorary !
! modern dance society. Mary Joyce
j is president and Carol Eller is tech- j
! nical director for the conceit.

one of the 17 original dance compositions to be presented in their
spring concert tonight at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium. An adaptation
of a peasant grape harvest dance, the number was choreographed by
Don Sobieske, who is shown above as the harvest hand who becomes
drunk on the wine. Appearing with him as four disgusted peasant
girls are (left to right) Mary Joyce, Barbara Peyser, Mary Macaulay,
and Mary Pat Sawyer.

Orchesis members will present
the first performance of their spring
dance concert tonight at 8:15 in Me
morial Auditorium. The concert, an
all-student production, will be given
again Saturday night.
Orchesis members have developed
original modern interpretations of
15th and 16th century court dances
which will be featured in the con
cert under the direction of Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, director of dance.
To illustrate the dance forms on
which the rest of the program is
based, the concert will open with a
suite of four "authentic" court
dances.
ONE OF THE MOST HUMOROUS
numbers is "Spiritus Fermenti,"
adapted from an earthy peasant
dance performed during the grape
harvest. The dancers appear as
peasants who dump the grapes into
a huge vat and proceed to crush
them into wine with their bare feet
to the music of the bourree.
Among the serious numbers on
the program are "Compromise," de
picting a man's struggle to overcome
his self - centered nature and get
along with the world; "Journey of
Moralia," describing a medieval trip
from piety into the realm of world

\ ly transgression, and a return of the ;
\ devout one; and "Deadline," built j
; on the frustrations of meeting given i
dates.
THE FIN ALE WILL CLOSE with
! a lively group composition. "'Round
up." danced to a medley of cowboy
tunes. Opening with a feeling of j
| the square dance, the finale, set j
against a backdrop of vivid Western
j mountains and cacti, develops into |
I a fast-moving rodeo.
The concert will be presented to
the public without charge.
Orchesis is the Stanford honorary !
! modern dance society. Mary Joyce
j is president and Carol Eller is tech- j
! nical director for the conceit.
