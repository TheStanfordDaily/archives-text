# Taft, Dewey Discount Stassen Wisconsin Win

MILWAUKEE. April 7 (UP)
Harold E. Stassen boosted his presi- !
dential stock today with a smashing j
victory in the Wisconsin primary \
election that trounced Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur in his adopted state and
apparently blanked Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey of New York.
Stassen's victory hit Dewey the
hardest. The New York governor
appeared to have only a slight
chance of winning one delegate in
the three - cornered battle for the j
state's 27 delegates to the Republican i
nominating convention June 21. j
WTH ALL BUT 102 of the state's j
0.138 precincts reported, returns :
from yesterday's primary gave Stas
sen If) delegates and Mac Arthur 8. i
Dewey, en route to Nebraska for
a campaign tour for next Tuesday's '
primary there, said he was not j
greatly surprised by his own show- j
ing, but had figured Mac Arthur j
would win the majority instead of I
Stassen. He described his showing j
as a "temporary setback," and said
he still was on the right side of
the political ledger.
"We gained 90 delegates in New
York, which is more than four times !

the number any other candidate ac
quired."
Sen. Robert A. Taft also discounted
the importance of Harold E. Stas
sen's victory in the Wisconsin presi
dential primary.
TAFT FORCES believed that Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey's shutout in the
three-man race for Wisconsin con
vention delegates would weaken the
New York governor in the seven
man fight in the Nebraska presi
dential primary next week. Tai't was
entered in the Nebraska test but not
in Wisconsin.

Committee, said here tonight that
Henry Wallace's third party aim was
to create so much confusion that
the November presidential election
would go to the Republicans.
