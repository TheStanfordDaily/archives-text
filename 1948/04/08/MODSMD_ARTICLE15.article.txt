of the Justice Department. Its peti- '
tion charged that Lewis and the
i union "knowingly, wilfully, wrong
: fully, and deliberately disobeyed
i and violated'' the temporary order.
It also said that, besides making

TIIE TEMPORARY ORDER.
handed down by Judge Matthew F.
McGuire. directed Lewis to call off

plies.
Operators quarrelling with Lewis

; himself boycotted the session which
he termed "a forlorn hope.''
