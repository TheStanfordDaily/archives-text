# Research Institute Plans Million Dollar Budget
## 
### JACK VARTY 
"I expect the Stanford Research Institute to be working with
a budget of over a million dollars by the beginning of 1950."
This statement was made, in an interview yesterday, by Dr.
Jesse E. Hobson, new director of the Stanford Research Institute.
This institution is non-profit, and does scientific and technical

research for the benefit of and 4
sponsored by industry and govern- ;
ment.
Dr. Hobson is a 36-year-old elec- [
trical engineer who received his
Ph.D. degree Magna Cum Laude
from Cal Tech in 1935, and in 1940
was named "The Outstanding Young
Electrical Engineer of the United
States." He leaves tha Armour Re- I
search Foundation in Chicago where |
he was director since 1944.
The Stanford Research Institute,
serving the whole West, does $350,- |
000 worth of research yearly, spe
cializing in chemical research. The |
smog project, financed by the pe- j
troleum industries, has found that
elemental sulphur is the chief cause !
of eye irritation resulting from the j
Los Angeles atmosphere.
Dr. Hobson, as an electrical engi- j
neer, will bring new know-how and ■
a broader outlook to the Stanford
Research Institute. In addition, the j
founder of the Armour Research j
Foundation, Dr. Thomas C. Poulter, j
will soon join Dr. Hobson here as
associate director of the Stanford |
Research Institute. Dr. Hobson said j

he is in contact with other men in
the hope of bringing them out to
work for the Institute.
When Dr. Poulter arrives he will
share in the expanded program by
directing research in his special
fields of geophysics, geology, and
explosives. Other new fields of re
search will be ceramics and elec
tronics.
