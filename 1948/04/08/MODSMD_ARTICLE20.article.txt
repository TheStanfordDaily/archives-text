, many today to support the Western
Allies against Russia and told them
; that the nwly enacted European
i Recovery Plan brought them back

In a speech unprecedented since

ficial a partition of Germany be
j tween western and eastern zones in
the foreseeable future, necessitated

Addressing the German North

I tlemen who with democracy on their
lips and a truncheon behind their
backs would filch your German
I freedom," Robertson said.
