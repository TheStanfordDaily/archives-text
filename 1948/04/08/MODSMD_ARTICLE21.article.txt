# Benes Avoids Red Issue

### 
PRAGUE. April 7 (UP).â€”Presi
dent Eduard Benes, in his first pub
lic speech since the Communists
took over Czchoslovakia, said today
that only freedom and tolerance can
bring "a truly happy future."
Not once, either in his speech or
in a prepared statement read by
Communist Minister of Education
Zdenek Nejedly, did Benes mention
the new political conditions in this,
the nation he helped create.
In both speech and statement,
however, he referred often to
"iruth" and "freedom."
Before the end of his three-min
ute address at ceremonies marking
the fiOOth anniversary of Charles
University, Benes' voice weakened
and he appeared near collapse. Some
persons who stood near the 63-
year-old president said he seemed
to have tears in his eyes.
Faltering on almost every word in
the latter half of his text, and
speaking with tremendous effort,
Benes declared:
"Freedom, founded on man's re
spect for man and on common tol
erance, and truth, which tradition
ally has had its home in our uni
versity, will, God willing, once more
lead Charles University, and all of
us with it, to happy prosperity and
a truly happy future."
American Ambassador Laurence
A. Steinhardt, the British ambassa
dor, and the Dutch. Danish, Swe
dish, and Norwegian ministers "ex
cused themselves" from attending
the ceremonies, the Prague radio
reported.
