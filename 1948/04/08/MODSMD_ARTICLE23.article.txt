## The 						Untouched Files 
### 
Activity Files—a program initiated over a year ago—is a
good example of a worthwhile idea that has deteriorated almost
to the point of worthlessness through lack of interest and work.
Theoretically these files were to "increase participation in
extra-curricular affairs" by serving as a clearing house for all
campus organizations.
Mechanically they have carried out this purpose. They now
have a complete file of all Stanford students and their major
interests. They also have a record of all campus organizations
end their officers. They hold office hours twice a week.
Actually there has been almost no call for information. Or
ganizations seem content to dig up committee workers from
r.mong their friends, rather than calling on unknown but inter
ested people.
Everyone will admit that "increased participation in extra
curricular affairs" is a desirable end. Obviously Activity Files
is either the wrong approach or it needs rejuvenating. There
r.eeds to be education to its use.
If the committee itself feels they have fulfilled their respon
sibility then Cardinals should carry the ball. In the words of
the ASSU constitution Cardinals is supposed to "promote cam
pus welfare."
In addition there is N3A. They have expressed their desire
to aid in campus affairs. Their experience with this group, if
they choose to work with them, could be relayed to other schools
who, undobutedly, have this same problem. —M. H.
