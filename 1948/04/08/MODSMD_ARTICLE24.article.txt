# CAMPUS OPINION
## Unity Takes Discussion 
### 
To the Editor:
There is still a chance for students to belong to political groups at
Stanford. President Eurich approves and even encourages their partici
pation. The only important stipulation is that they must meet off-campus.
If those who protested the fate of PCA were sincerely concerned, they
may prove it now by joining an off-campus group, such as the newly
formed Stanford Students for Wallace, a homogenous ogranization which
can better serve student interests than can a Palo Alto group.
Impartial discussion has a legitimate function, but its echoes are faint
in the world's policy chambers. The only time that you and I can
make our opinions count is during an election; to be significant then,
we must .be practically unified, and unity takes discussion, thought,
compromise.
If another war should come, what would be the importance of any
present pursuit. An honest evaluation makes meeting off-campus no
obstacle at all.
