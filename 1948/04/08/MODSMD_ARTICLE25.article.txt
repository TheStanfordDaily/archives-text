# Where Are the Tost Files?

### 
To the Editor:
Just before finals last quarter The Daily printed several letters sug
gesting the establishment of test files.
Such a plan would undoubtedly be very helpful to the whole student
body. It would be of particular assistance to off-campus students who,
at present, are at a disadvantage in comparison with those who live
in university residences maintaining private files.
The plan for the establishment of a permanent and complete file of
tests should be adopted and implemented in the near future.
Let's not wait until the end of the quarter to begin thinking and acting
on this.
