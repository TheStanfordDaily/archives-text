# Spring Fever and the AVC
## 
### 
To the Editor:
This will serve to reply to Miss Hardy's letter in yesterday's column.
At the present time the AVC on the campus is suffering from the peren
nial spring lever, not to mention the well planned red-herring of such
"safety zoners" as Will Rogers Jr.
I wish to mention but two solid projects which would appeal to
every veteran who swore to himself that after the war he would
see that his generation didn't hand his children the mess he inherited.
The state housing commission is a real step toward low-rental homes
for vets and others.
Then there is the "every vet a voter" drive that only will succeed
with active work. Those vets who are so completely rehabilitated as
to have forgotten so soon are in for a big jolt unless they get with it!
'Nuff said.
