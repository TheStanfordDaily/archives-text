This is a short essay on Humor.
A snake once had a funny idea; it turned out to
be the first funny idea of all time. It was a good
joke all right, but a lot of people don't care much
for snakes nowadays.
Since then there have been lots of jokes. Pulling
chairs when people sit down, tying fraternity pledges
to railroad tracks, aiming empty guns, drawing
mustaches on museum paintings, putting wax in
airplane gasoline, and spreading tacks on the floor
are a few. And truly, these things contain the es
sence of humor, which is incongruity. But a lot of
people don't care for them anyway.
University students think up sound jokes. Some
of the boys and girls at Stanford have formulated
ideas which are genuinely funny. They have seen the
incongruity of using picnic tables for firewood in
stead of for eating; they have seen how funny it is
to cut holes in automobiles with chisels, or to tear
off radio aerials so nothing happens when the radio
is turned on; they have seen how funny it is to slash
tires, to draw smutty pictures, to tip garbage cans,
to cut wires, to sound alarms, to smash, to rip, to
borrow, to paint, and to destroy as quickly and as
hilariously as possible.
Sincerely, it is a fortunate thing for our country
that young people are capable of such extraordinary
originality. It is unfortunate that they have neglected
that of university life which attempts to teach
respect for the rights of others. This is a trite thing
to say, but there should be no apology for its repe
tition.
Vandalism under the hypocritical banner of Humor
will continue, for it is a stage in the mental develop
ment of the human. It will continue in Stanford
Village, on the campus, in fraternity houses, and in
dormitories, even as it will be evident wherever
boys and girls are growing up. It is sadly reminiscent
of the vigorous young archers who once realized
how much fun it would be to shoot at the model
of a giant equestrian statue before it could be cast.
It is unfortunate that da Vinci never made another.
