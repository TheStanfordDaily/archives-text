History of the Marshall Plan
WASHINGTON (UP)—Seven days after Japan
surrendered in 1945, President Truman stunned an
allied world still nursing Victory Day hangovers.
He announced that all lend-lease would cease "im
mediately."
From then one. everything was to he on a "cash
and-carry'' basis. Those who couldn't pay cash
could borrow. The United Nations was to take
care of starvation. Eventually the World Bank was
to supply reconstruction loans.
If any one decision started a train of events ulti
mately leading 2 1 *> years later to the need for a
new many-billion dollar recovery program, Mr. Tru
man's announcement on Aug. 21, 1945, probably
was it.
Lend-lease was a war-time measure and had
to end. But when it ended, there was no interim
plan to take care of a world devastated by six
years of war.
Lend-lease is most often thought of in terms of
military equipment. But only half of the $50,000.-
000.000. spent by the U. S. for lend-lease was for
strictly military supplies. The balance was for food,
raw materials, essential civilian supplies, industrial
equipment—many of which were for civilian popu
lations. For example, much of Britain's food supply
during the last years of the war was lend-lease.
No arrangements had been made by Europe to
pick up where lend-lease left oIT. Those countries,
along with the United States, expected the Japa
nese war to last at least another year. Lend
lease was to continue until Japan surrendered.
Thus there was a mad scramble to improvise plans
for keeping the supply lines filled. The only possible
supplier of necessities was the United States. But
dollars in Europe were scarce and the prospect was
that it would be months before such nations as
Britain could reconvert to production for export—
her only way of acquiring dollars to buy food.
The UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Re
habilitation Administration) was in operation.
Britain was not eligible for such relief, not having
been invaded.
The United States, which footed about 70 per cent
of UNRRA's bill, was extremely dissatisfied with that
organization. Congress didn't like it. feeling the
United States was not getting enough credit for its
contributions. Furthermore it was an international
organization and the United States—although con
tributing three-fourths of the money—only had one
vote, as did each of the other members. On United
States initiative, UNRRA was abolished in December,
194(i.
The first immediate result of the termination of
lend-lease was a British SOS. After months of
wrangling, a controversial $.1,750,000,000 loan was
negotiated to last from three to five years. The
British drew the last $100,000,000 of it on March—
months after it was signed.
The United States pursued this policy—the end of
international relief and help projects, loans to indi
vidual countries as needs arose, and single-handed
United States relief in small amounts to prevent
actual starvation—until the spring of 1947.
That program had cast the United States $12.-

000.000,000. But it didn't bring results. Neither
war-time lend-lease nor UNRRA nor the post-war
piecemeal programs was adequate or designed to
meet the problem that eventually developed in
Europe.
Some of the defenders of the administration's
policies in those years place all the blame for failure
on Soviet obstructionism. It certainly made it worse.
But Secretary of State Marshall told the Senate:
"The present economic problem would exist
even though it were not complicated by the ideo
logical struggles in Europe between those who
want to live as free men and those small groups
who aspire to dominate by the method of police
states."
Thus 2 1 12 years after Mr. Truman's lend-lease de
cision. the United States had to reverse its policy.
It had to abandon the idea that Europe could recover
if merely starvation was averted.
Just as the United States at the beginning of the
war decided that all allied resources had to be
pooled to defeat the enemy and devised lend-lease
to do it.it has now been forced to devise a com
parable postwar program. It calls for maximum
cooperative self-help by Europeans, with the
United States providing marginal help to prime
the pump.
