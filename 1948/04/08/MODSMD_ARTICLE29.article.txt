PARIS (UP) â€”Aid under the European Recovery
Program must arrive by May 15 "at the very latest"
to keep factories in France from closing down or
operating at reduced output, French government of
ficials contend.
A representative of tlie ministry of finance told
the United Press that "things will he awfully close"
even if aid arrives by May 1. Supplies of steel
and textiles will he especially affected, he said.
As a last resort, Pierre Mendes-France, represen
tative of France on the International Monetary Fund,
will ask the Export-Import Bank for about 850.000.-
000. Another $38,000,000 was paid France last month
for costs of the American army here during the war.
An estimated $150,000,000 illegally held by French
citizens in American banks will be freed by the
U. S. government June 1.
Those funds should enable France to squeak
just through for another month or two, officials
said.
Textiles, almost non-existent here after the war's
end. began to reappear in shops at almost normal
prices after imports from the United States. Unless
such imports continue, officials said, cloth factories
will come to an almost complete halt. Steel is
equally threatened.
Officials said there is less danger (hat failure of
aid to arrive in time will affect food imports. As
a result of its third mildest winter since 1575,
France is looking forward to its best harvest in
years. Financial experts are planning to divert
funds normally spent on American wheat to farm
machinery instead.
