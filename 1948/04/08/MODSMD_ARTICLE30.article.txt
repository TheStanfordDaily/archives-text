## History 1948 
### 
During the war, soldiers who overstayed their
leave for a few days got long prison sentences. In
rear areas Gls baek from the front were summarily
court-martialed if a button on their field jacket was
missing.
But Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach war;

acquitted.
The head of the gigantic muni
tions combine which had started
to rearm Germany in 1922, in di
rect violation of the Versailles
Treaty, which had financed Hit
ler's rise to power, and without
whose continued support the Nazis
could neither have stayed in
power, nor fought a war, was
found not guilty of plotting ag
gressive war.

The evidence against Krupp is full, clear, and un
contradicted. He knew Hitler's plans, he assisted in
shaping them, and he was essential to their realiza
tion. If that is not plotting aggressive war, what is?
We have hanged a few generals and some of the
more notorious concentration camp guards, but we
let the real criminal escape. No trial at all would
have been better than this shocking whitewash.
For we have now officially announced to the world
that we see nothing wrong in organizing a war and
reaping gigantic profits out of the suffering of
millions. Krupp might still be convicted of plun
dering and using slave labor, but he has been
cleared of the main charge.
We have reduced justice to a matter of political
expediency. Since our so-called statesmen have de
cided to rebuild Germany as a buffer against Russia,
we must not alienate German businessmen. We
welcome the assistance of any gangster as long as
he is anti-communist. Politics first, justice second.
How will we explain our action to the millions
throughout the world who are homeless and hun
gry. who have been through a decade of nightmares
and face no brighter future as a direct consequence
of the activities of a few Krupps? What glib ration
alization will we have for a wrecked and weary
world? How will we now explain democracy and
justice?
In the coming year we will spend six billion dollars
in Europe in a desperate attempt to buy friendship.
It is already dubious whether we can succeed. If
we pull a few more stunts like the Krupp "trial"
all the money in the world will avail us nothing

dering and using slave labor, but he has been
cleared of the main charge.
We have reduced justice to a matter of political
expediency. Since our so-called statesmen have de
cided to rebuild Germany as a buffer against Russia,
we must not alienate German businessmen. We
welcome the assistance of any gangster as long as
he is anti-communist. Politics first, justice second.
How will we explain our action to the millions
throughout the world who are homeless and hun
gry. who have been through a decade of nightmares
and face no brighter future as a direct consequence
of the activities of a few Krupps? What glib ration
alization will we have for a wrecked and weary
world? How will we now explain democracy and
justice?
In the coming year we will spend six billion dollars
in Europe in a desperate attempt to buy friendship.
It is already dubious whether we can succeed. If
we pull a few more stunts like the Krupp "trial"
all the money in the world will avail us nothing
