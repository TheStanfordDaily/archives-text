# Hollywood's 'Northside 777' Rings Melodramatic Bell
## 
### 
I'm walkin' down University Ave
nue, mindin' me own business, when
this guy sidles up to me and sez,
"Call Northside Sebben Sebben
Sebben."
So I calls Northside Sebben Seb
ben Sebben. And whataya know?
It's a moving pitcher!
They have Jimmy Stewart play
ing a hotshot reporter for the Chi
cagah Times. It seems some joker
was railroaded to the pen for shoot
ing a cop without a hunting license.
He's been in the jug for 11 years
and his ever-lovin' maw has been
slaving like ever-lovin' maws do to
get Junior out of that bad environ
ment.

Jimmy goes through a lot of
drama, pathos, and emotion, and
even gets the guy freed. It's a true
story, though, so it must be believ
able. Big-hearted Fox Studios even
paid $1,000 to Frank Wiecek for the
story of his unjust imprisonment.
The Chicago Times' crusade to
free Frank Wiecek makes a good
story. Stewart plays his part well,
but gets too melodramatic to make
the picture really effective. Richard
Conte plays Wiecek and Lee Cobb is
well cast as the Times' managing
editor.
The accompanying piece at the
Stanford is something about those
"Dangerous Years." Juvenile delin
quency gets served up in a seven
course epic. I didn't know whethei
to laugh or cry, so I walked out
rather than get frustrated. â€”Ed
