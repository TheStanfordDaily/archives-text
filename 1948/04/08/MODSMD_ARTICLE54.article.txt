# Cards Dump Broncs; Stoll Goes Distance
## 
### 
Stanford turned four hits into four runs yesterday afternoon
to ease by Santa Clara, 4 to 3. on the Sunken Diamond. It was
Charlie Cole's timely single in the fourth inning that drove in
two runs and paved the way for Stanford's second league win.
Playing before a scattered home crowd, the Cards turned in

a sparkling defensive game, but as*
in previous contests did not use
their warclubs to advantage.
The Indians scored two runs on
two hits in the third inning, and re
peated with two more runs on one |
hit in the fourth hailing.
Pitcher Dave Stott started things
off in the third when he collected
an infield safety in back of second
base. Charlie Cole and Frank Mac-
Graw drew walks to load the bases,
and Clyde Dingfelder knocked in
the first run with a hit through third
base.
MacGraw scored when th Bronco
second sacker juggled Bill Arce's
slow roller.
CHARLIE COLE KEPT the ball
rolling in the next inning when he j
hit a line drive over first to drive
in Jim Mason and Dave Stott. after
Ted Nell had put them in scoring
position with a sacrifice.
Santa Clara opened the game with
a rush when center fielder Bill
Prentice tripled to deep right field.
Harv Toso grounded to Bill Arce at
third, but Harvey Christensen sin
gled to right to score Prentice.
The Broncos continued to threat
en when Bill Renna drove a single
into deep right field, but Tom Kelly
grounded sharply to shortstop Buck '
Brownsafi who scooped up the ball,
tagged second, and threw to Cole at
first to make it a double play and j
end the inning.
Stanford's superb fielding was the
definite feature of the game. Ted
Nell robbed Prentice of an extra
base hit in the fifth when he made
a nice running catch out against the
right field wall. Buck Brownson
also contributed a pair of fielding j
nifties, as did first sacker Charlie
Cole. -
Cole had a big day at the plate,
hitting two for three and driving in
two runs. Other Card hits were
made by Clyde Dingfelder who sin
gled sharply off the third baseman's I
glove in the third inning, and by j
pitcher Dave Stott who beat out an I
infield hit, also in the third inning. :
BROWNSON AND DINGFEL- j
DER were both robbed of base hits j
during the game. It looked as if
Brownson had a sure Texas leaguer
in the fifth, but Bronco second base
man Bob Nard got his fingers on the .
bail to gather it in. Dingfelder was
going for extra bases when third
baseman Bob Ferrari made a diving !
catch of his sizzling liner in the sev
enth inning'.
Santa Clara used three pitchers. •
Starter Galen Norquist was given
the loss, as the other hurlers Jim !
Smith and Hal Toso blanked the In
dians without a hit.
Stanford's team batting average
took another drop yesterday. The
varsity collected only four blows in
26 trips to the plate, and slipped to
. timid .166.
