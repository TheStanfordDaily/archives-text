## Frosh Host SMJC Today 
### 
San Mateo JC's baseball team will
invade the fresh- diamond for a
game with the Stanford Freshmen
this afternoon. Game 1 time is set
i for 3. ,» •"*
With rain and damp "cutting short
baseball activity since last Sat
day's game with the Cal Cubs, the
frosh have not had enough time to
; prepare for today's game. However,
Coach Charlie Bushong sent his
crew through a long workout yes
terday to shake off the effects of
the enforced layoff.
Pitchers Jim- Claypool, Denny
Tuffanelli, Lloyd Westphal, and John
Licata worked on perfecting their
| control. Eleven walks in the Cali
fornia game were very harmful, with
three runs being forced across the
plate on passes. Bases on balls fig
ured in all of the Cubs' run pro
duction and contributed heavily to
their win.
While the pitching nomination for
today has not been announced, it is
fairly certain that Jim Claypool will
I get the assignment. Big Jim was
pitching shutout ball last Saturday
until a half-hour delay due to rain
seemed to rob him of his effective
ness. But in his five-inning stint be
fore the downpour. Claypool showed
plenty of stuff and should be a
! valuable addition to the frosh hurl
: ing corps.
Probable starters:
Bruce Cameron, ss: Denny Tuffa
nelli. cf: Sal Colletto, 3b: Jim Tra
bucco. If; Dick Clegg, c; Bill Herron.
