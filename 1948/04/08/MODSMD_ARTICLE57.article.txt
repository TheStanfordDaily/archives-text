# Varsity Tests Spikes In Workout at Stadium
## 
### 
Stanford Stadium was the scene
yesterday of the varsity track team's
mid-week workout to get in top
shape for the San Jose State meet
Saturday afternoon. The starting
time for the meet, which is to be
held in the Stadium, has been set
at 1:45 for the field events and 2 for
the mile.
This was the first practice the
Indians have had in the stadium
this year. There is a great differ
ence between Angel! Field and the
stadium track, the latter being much
rounder in shape and not having
banked turns to help the runners.
COACH JACK WEIEIISHAUSER
has been hoping for a few good days
of practice before the meet, and in
the past week has recived either
rain or a muddy track. The stadium
track was still soft yesterday, so
the workout times were slower than
usual.
Bill Larsen. top Indian pole vault
er. registered his best mark of the
year by leaping 13 feet 4 inches. He

I cleared four inches above his best
j mark for the season last year, and is
i figured to rive Howard Overmire of
! San Jose a good contest. Overmire
jumped 13 feet G inches against the
j Olympic Club.
Considering the slowness of the
j track (about two seconds difference
i in times in the 440), one may judge
Larry Hoff's 51 fiat second quarter
mile as very good.
However, Cards are yet un
' tested this season, and may very
well show a few surprises to the
Spartans.
