# Libe Scaler Dethroned By Firemen
## 
### 
An enthusiastic crowd of over 100
yesterday afternoon cheered the
Fire Department rescue of Dan :
Page, a student, from the arches
above the main entrance to the j
Library.
Page climbed the face of the build- 1
>ng to retrieve his car keys from I
che plate held by the figure "Sci- !
ence." The keys were thrown from j
below by friends as a practical joke.
Fire Chief John M. Marston said
later, "We've had to get cats and
.students out of trees, but this is
the first time we've had to get a
studenL off a building."
Page said that during his stay he
tried in vain to get someone to open |
the windows so he could get into !
the second-floor periodical room, j
but the only response that he raised
was from an unidentified man who
merely motioned to him to get off I
his precarious perch.
When asked why they didn't use j
a net, firemen said, "He might miss."
Chief Marston said that if students '
climb much higher, there is a good j
chance that ladders will not reach
them, and they will have to jump j
into a net.
