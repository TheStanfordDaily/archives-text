On loan to the Hoover Library is
an exhaustive, almost complete col
lection of Allied leaflets distributed
over Germany during World War II
by the Psychological Warfare Divi
sion. *
While in the possession of the
Hoover Library, the private collec
tion will be reproduced in color on
microfilm. Predominant among the
papers are those that informed the
German troops of the progress of
Allied pincer movements and the
[jeopardy in which the enemy forces
were placed. Many leaflets were
warnings to evacuate issued to the
inhabitants of towns that were to
be bombed.
Safe - conduct leaflets showered
over enemy territory are perhaps
the most interesting papers in the
collection. The paper, when pre
sented at the time of surrender by a
German soldier, insured him fair,
humane treatment. It is estimated
that 80 per cent of soldiers surren
dering at the end of the war had in
their possession a safe-conduct leaf
let.
