# Stanford Eye Bank Restores Sight in Operation on Cornea
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
In 1906, a German doctor,
Edouard Zirm, first performed the
operation successfully which was to
give many blind people the chance
to see. Forty-one years later Dr.
Max Fines, eminent eye surgeon at
the newly established eye bank of
the Stanford University Hospital,
was able to say proudly, '"The cor
neal transplant operation is now a
well-established surgical procedure
in which a trained surgeon under
takes with exact knowledge the
chances for success."
Then last month the Stanford Eye
| Bank in San Francisco, celebrating
| its first anniversary, was able to
j claim a year's record of 33 corneas
provided for eye graft operations.
EYE SOURCES
These eyes came from two sources
I —from living people who had to
lose their eyes because of injury
or disease and from dead people
who had willed their eyes to this
I community srvice organization.
In finding an eye for the operation,
i race, sex, blood-grouping, and age
of the donor are immaterial; even
eyes of still-born babies can often
be used. But there is one restriction
on the cornea supply—speed. Not
more than 48 hours can elapse be
fore the transplant is made, and the
sooner the better. It is this limita
tion which makes it imperative that
a central registry organization such
as the Stanford Eye Bank be ready
to bring donor and patient together
rapidlv.
DELICATE OPERATION
Dean Loren R. Chandler of the
Stanford Medical School said that
j were it not for air service, the op
' eration would be confined to only
j local hospitals. But by means of
j special glass containers enclosed in
a black fiber case which is sur
| rounded with dry ice and packed in
a cardboard box. the cornea can be
| sped as far as the East Coast by
I plane.
The cornea transplant operation is

a delicate but now relatively com
mon operation in which a transpar
ent graft of healthy eye tissue is
grafted into the blinded eye. form
ing a "window" through which im
proved sight is possible. The most
difficult part of this local anaesthetic
operataion is when the diseased cor
nea. a twenty-fifth of an inch thick,
is cut from the faulty eye.
Physicians estimate that one out of
twenty has a type of blindness that
could be remedied by the surgery.
This means that the unbelievable
number of 10.000 blind people have
the opportunity which is extended
by eye banks.
Only 12 surgeons on the Coast can
qualify for the operation and only
three other eye bank "clearance
centers" in the nation are equipped
to handle the corneas. Hie real
foresight however must come from
voluntary "humanitarians" who of
fer their eyes through their wills so
"our blind can see."


MRS. KATHERINE S. HARTMAN places a jar containing a human eye
in the tray of a refrigerator of the eye bank at the Stanford Medical
School in San Francisco. Eyes are kept in the refrigerator until
they are needed for the corneal "eyegraft" operations.
