# Political Probings Reveal Seven Possibilities For April ASSU Presidential Election Race
## 
### BY PAULA NUSSER 
Many Stanford students will agree
wholeheartedly with Will Rogers
who said, ''I tell you. folks, all
polities is applesauce."
But applesauce or not, there are
few other fields that can stir up the
excitement and intei'est of the pub-
I lie as does a hotly contested political
I race.
I Even placid Stanford University
takes more than a casual interest
in the state of student government
come spring elections, especially
this year with the national election
in the forefront.
And what has been going on. in
; the back rooms of Stanford in the
j past couple of weeks? Who will be
our potential Tom Dewevs, Harold
| Stassens, and even our Clare Booth
j Luces?
THE ASSU PRESIDENTIAL field
will not be lacking candidates. Al
ready five have signified they will
accept nomination and two other
men seem only to be waiting for
! the opening gun to give an official
| okay to their petitions.
This year the election spotlight
1 should be focused on the Village.
Candidates would be wise in trying
\ to bring out the Village vote April
| 21. for, up to date, the Village is
| the only large men's area without
j a probable candidate. The women's
| vote should be emphasized because
| the short side of Stanford's ratio
•j turns out the greatest percentage at
the polls.
THE ROW is bristling with would
be-presidents. Gene Martin of the
I Beta House has started to squelch

rumors that the Beta's Morley
Thompson might give the presiden
tial field another try.
Tom Diamond, Theta Chi. has
tossed in his hat and the Zetes are
probably running Bob Anderson,
i although Anderson will not return
j from a swimming meet until this
weekend. Zete Dud DeGroot em
; phatically denied he had ever con
j sidered being a candidate.
A sure bet for a nomination is i
Gus Chevalas, Delt, although he has
; steadfastly refused to commit him-
I self. One of the presidential candi- J
■ dates, however, stated that Chevalas
I already has an organized list of sup
porters ready to work.
JUNIORS ARE WONDERING if
' their class president, Chub Fishback, I
j Deke. will continue straddling the
fence. One of his fraternity brothers
| said campus opinion of the Dekes
i might get a lift "if they got a cap- j
i able candidate in office."
An absolute "no" was Bob Coate's '
: answer to the question of candidacy, j
I This Fiji said if he returned next
fall as a graduate student, it would
j be to study.
S Ken Croft, off-campus student,
. has stepped on the bandwagon. A 1
I Munk, who announced his intention
! of campaigning last week, cancelled
| his plan yesterday "because of the
! probability of doing advanced studies
I at Harvard."
Rumors that Don Core of Toyor i
would be a probable candidate were '
denied by Core's acquaintances, {
j while Norm Swanson, thought to be j
I the Eating Clubs' choice, said he ■
I could not accept the nomination be

! cause of studies and other activities.
TED NORTON, law student and
Encina sponsor, however, stated
Monday that he would enter the
race. The Eating Clubs will un
doubtedly support Norton.
Gordy Yates was a suggested can
didate from the Vilage but Yates
said "no."
This present pre-nomination presi
dential reconnaissance gives us five
candidates for the Row, including
the question marks, one off-campus
student, and one Encina candidate.
Can the Row hope to put across a
candidate with so many nominees
in proportion to their numerical
number on campus? Though Stan
ford has never voted solidly ac
cording to living areas, the ques
tion still remains. A fraternity house
might put over a candidate if:
1. The majority of the Row can
didates were eliminated in the pri
mary; or
2. They could secure support of
the women or the Village in a large
enough block.
AT THIS EARLY DATE, with
only one Encina candidate, the
chances are fair that Norton will at
least pass the primary if he gets
enough votes from the two fac
tions that, as yet, do not have candi
dates.
As for vice-president, three wom
en candidates have replied in the
affirmative regarding their nomina
te ns: B. J. Denning of Lagunita,
v lene Anderson of Roth, and pos
sibly Nan Shepherd of Storey. Buffy
Working, contrary to earlier reports,
said she would not be a candidate
under any condition.

TED NORTON, law student and
Encina sponsor, however, stated
Monday that he would enter the
race. The Eating Clubs will un
doubtedly support Norton.
Gordy Yates was a suggested can
didate from the Vilage but Yates
said "no."
This present pre-nomination presi
dential reconnaissance gives us five
candidates for the Row, including
the question marks, one off-campus
student, and one Encina candidate.
Can the Row hope to put across a
candidate with so many nominees
in proportion to their numerical
number on campus? Though Stan
ford has never voted solidly ac
cording to living areas, the ques
tion still remains. A fraternity house
might put over a candidate if:
1. The majority of the Row can
didates were eliminated in the pri
mary; or
2. They could secure support of
the women or the Village in a large
enough block.
AT THIS EARLY DATE, with
only one Encina candidate, the
chances are fair that Norton will at
least pass the primary if he gets
enough votes from the two fac
tions that, as yet, do not have candi
dates.
As for vice-president, three wom
en candidates have replied in the
affirmative regarding their nomina
te ns: B. J. Denning of Lagunita,
v lene Anderson of Roth, and pos
sibly Nan Shepherd of Storey. Buffy
Working, contrary to earlier reports,
said she would not be a candidate
under any condition.
Many Stanford students will agree
wholeheartedly with Will Rogers
who said, ''I tell you. folks, all
polities is applesauce."
But applesauce or not, there are
few other fields that can stir up the
excitement and intei'est of the pub-
I lie as does a hotly contested political
I race.
I Even placid Stanford University
takes more than a casual interest
in the state of student government
come spring elections, especially
this year with the national election
in the forefront.
And what has been going on. in
; the back rooms of Stanford in the
j past couple of weeks? Who will be
our potential Tom Dewevs, Harold
| Stassens, and even our Clare Booth
j Luces?
THE ASSU PRESIDENTIAL field
will not be lacking candidates. Al
ready five have signified they will
accept nomination and two other
men seem only to be waiting for
! the opening gun to give an official
| okay to their petitions.
This year the election spotlight
1 should be focused on the Village.
Candidates would be wise in trying
\ to bring out the Village vote April
| 21. for, up to date, the Village is
| the only large men's area without
j a probable candidate. The women's
| vote should be emphasized because
| the short side of Stanford's ratio
•j turns out the greatest percentage at
the polls.
THE ROW is bristling with would
be-presidents. Gene Martin of the
I Beta House has started to squelch

rumors that the Beta's Morley
Thompson might give the presiden
tial field another try.
Tom Diamond, Theta Chi. has
tossed in his hat and the Zetes are
probably running Bob Anderson,
i although Anderson will not return
j from a swimming meet until this
weekend. Zete Dud DeGroot em
; phatically denied he had ever con
j sidered being a candidate.
A sure bet for a nomination is i
Gus Chevalas, Delt, although he has
; steadfastly refused to commit him-
I self. One of the presidential candi- J
■ dates, however, stated that Chevalas
I already has an organized list of sup
porters ready to work.
JUNIORS ARE WONDERING if
' their class president, Chub Fishback, I
j Deke. will continue straddling the
fence. One of his fraternity brothers
| said campus opinion of the Dekes
i might get a lift "if they got a cap- j
i able candidate in office."
An absolute "no" was Bob Coate's '
: answer to the question of candidacy, j
I This Fiji said if he returned next
fall as a graduate student, it would
j be to study.
S Ken Croft, off-campus student,
. has stepped on the bandwagon. A 1
I Munk, who announced his intention
! of campaigning last week, cancelled
| his plan yesterday "because of the
! probability of doing advanced studies
I at Harvard."
Rumors that Don Core of Toyor i
would be a probable candidate were '
denied by Core's acquaintances, {
j while Norm Swanson, thought to be j
I the Eating Clubs' choice, said he ■
I could not accept the nomination be

! cause of studies and other activities.
