# Semi-Secrecy, Leniency Charges Hurled at Council
## 
### 
Charges of operating in semi-secrecy and handing out "tissue
paper" justice were leveled on Men's Council last night by
Cal Newman, chairman of the Honor Code Standing Commit
tee. In a letter to the group, Newman said he had not been
notified of Honor Code case hearings, contrary to promises by

the council that he could sit in on
such cases.
Declaring that Men's Council has
"more responsibility than anyone
else in student government." New
man stated he was disturbed by the
nature of punishment in a recent
Honor Code violation.
IN THIS CASE, the man was
given an "F" in the course and
suspended for one quarter. "Before
the war, violators of the Code were
expelled permanently," said New
man. Instead, this man "takes his
vacation now rather than in the
summer and flunks a course he
probably would not have passed
anyway," he said.
"If this trend continues, we will
be punishing flagrant violations of
the Code by requesting the indi
vidual to refrain from eating his
dessert or a week."
"Your actions may alter the course
of a man's life. and. in the final
analysis, you are the guardian of
our most treasured tradition and
privilege," Newman declared.
Replying to Newman's letter.
Council Chairman Fred Hannum
said:
"RECENT COUNCILS have prac
ticed meting out punishment ranging
from a reprimand to suspension
from school. Expulsion has been
considered as extremely severe. This
is a very good subject to discuss
with Newman. I'm certain that we
on Men's Council would consider
any suggestions from the Honor
Code Committee that would aid en
forcement of the Honor Code.
"It must be remembered that
Newman can look at the Honor Code
as a whole and objectively. He is
responsible for its success. How
ever. each case must be considered
individually and subjectively by the
men hearing the case. Where New
man can look at individuals only
as violators of the Honor Code, we
must look at them as persons who
will be stamped forever with dis
honor.
'"NEWMAN SAID a suspension is
merely 'requesting the individual to
refrain from eating his dessert for
a week.' On the contrary, an Honor
Code violation is permanently en
tered on every violator's school
record.
"I agree with Newman that the
council's actions may alter the
course of a man's life. We directly
alter the life of the violator. But
I doubt very much if we have the
right to ruin that man's life. From
the moral standpoint it might be
wise. From the Honor Code Com

mittee's standpoint it would be ad
vantageous. The question is open for
discussion."
NEWMAN RECALLED an Honor
Code case last spring in which three
men were "convicted, suspended,
and then, on an appeal, acquitted
without the introduction of any new
evidence. Report of this final ac
quittal was withheld from publica
tion in The Daily on appeal by the
chairman of the Council that 'it
would not look good'."
Hannum replied:
"I remember the case a year ago
in which three men were convicted
of violating the Honor Code and
later acquitted. The Council had
found the men guilty on evidence
that was insufficient for conviction.
More study of the case convinced
the members of Men's Council that
the men were not guilty, and had
not keen proven guilty. The Coun
cil members said the case 'would
nto look good.' not because of the
acquittal, but because they had con
victed the men unjustly.
"I WOULD LIKE to point out that
these cases have caused the present
Council to search out and to con
sider all evidence that concerns an
Honor Code case.
"Considering trials that have not
appeared in The Daily, I wish to
assert very strongly that Men's
Council has not been reluctant to
have all its activities known by the
student body. Last quarter a few
cases had to be carried over to dead
week to allow consideration of all
the evidence. The Daily was not
published during dead week. I know
of one other trial which was not
fully covered by a Daily reporter.
This was not due to any preventive
or avoidance action by members of
Men's Council."
