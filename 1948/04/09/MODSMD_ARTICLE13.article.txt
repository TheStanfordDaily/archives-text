## 
### 
"Orchids for every girl!" â€” that's
the announcement Diane Porter,
Sophomore Cotillion co-chairman,
made in telling about the dance to
be given April 30 at the Peninsula
Country Club.
"The flowers are being flown in
from Hawaii especially for the Co
tillion," Miss Porter added. They
will be included in the price of the
bid. which is $3 plus tax.
"This is the first time that the
annual Soph Cotillion has been
held off campus," Bob Armstrong,
the other co-chairman, said. "We
feel that in giving the dance at a
country club we can offer many at
tractions which are not ordinarily
present at a school dance," he con
tinued.
Tickets will be sold next week in
the men's Row houses by Vic Ran
dolph, by A 1 Rosenberg in the Vil
lage, and in the ASSU office.
