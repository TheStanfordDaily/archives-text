# Law School Seeks Assignment Plan For Crothers Hall
## 
### 
Stanford law students yesterday
took the first steps toward picking
the 63 lucky legal eagles who will
live in Crothers Hall.
Questionnaires were put in cir
culation to find what method of as
signing rooms in the new law dorm
was most popular with the students.
This polling of opinion is being
done by a five-man student com
mittee headed by Joe Rogers. When
the preferred method of allocation
lias been determined, the committee
will submit -a recommendation to
the faculty urging the use of that
method.
At present, there are about 500
students in law school. Half of these
are single men and therefore eli
gible to live in the dorm.
The poll asks opinions on three
general questions:
1. System of distribution among
the three classes.
2. Method of giving priority to in
dividual students regardless of class.
3. Whether or not some system of
rotation should be used.
