## Education for What? 
### 
Interest in extra-curricular activities and organizations seems
to be waning. The vice chairman of the AVC writes that the local
chapter is doing nothing. A news story follows that the Stanford
chapter expects to dissolve into the Palo Alto group.
Another story comes to our desk saying that only three
scripts were turned in for the Spring Show, and they were
not very good.
Other organizations have reported off the record that in
terest is hard to arouse. Lectures, exhibits, and other good—
and free—activities go unattended.
One reason we can advance for the situation is the constantly
increasing attention to studies at the expense of all else. Quarter
after quarter we have watched people drop out of activities
in the face of the rising grade average.
People say their studies suffer at the expense of extra-curricular
activities. We think it can go to the other extreme, too. Activities
are just as important as textbooks. There is little room in our
world for hermits. Hence the science of organization and getting
along with people is important for college graduates. The
types of jobs they'll have will require a lot of it.
Now, we don't advocate that everyone go around joining
organizations just to be a joiner. On the other hand, we do think
it would be well for everyone to ease his nose off that grind
stone just a little, to stop being a slave to books. After all,
some facts in books become obsolete fast enough.
To people who belong to organizations, we recommend that
Ihey take a personal interest in making their group a live one.
Of the Academic Council and the faculty we ask: is all
the text-book and outside reading thrown at students these
days a good thing? Other universities, particularly foreign uni
versities place a greater stress on discussion of current affairs.
Certainly we could use a little more of it in our ivory tower.
The general comprehension of current affairs is low indeed.
One history professor draws nothing but blanks as he asks
questions of his class of 300.
Maybe we're victims of a system, but the writer can't help
wondering if all the obsession with books is necessary—or
even desirable. —T. M. S.
