# CAMPUS OPINION
## Who Shares the Guilt? 
### 
To the Editor:
A hearty bravo to George Brunn. His comment yesterday was to the
point, truthful, and in the certain sense, representative. But George did
not go far enough. He left us standing on the stairs, when we should
have been invited to enter and view the parlor and kitchen as well as
the stoop and facade.
He should have pointed out that a conviction of Herr Krupp would
merely have placed the finger on an accessory and not the mastermind.
Krupp, without his foreign backers, would have been like a 1926
Model "T" without a "Ruckstell"—he would have gone places, but not
so well. To put our fingers on these powers behind the scene, we must
ring doorbells, not on the Wilhelmstrasse, but on Fleet and Wall streets. We
might press the button of Dillon. Read & Co.; we might buzz Brown Bros.
Harriman and Co.; and, if rio answer is forthcoming from these eminences,
we might walk over and drop a calling card at the fiscal residences of those
old rascals—Morgan and Rockefeller. But I fear we shall not easily do
this financial district missionary work.
But —in the name of peace, let us not fly into paranoidal anguish at
the thought of Krupp going Scot-free. Wc say that he violated the
Versailles Treaty—the same treaty that we righteous Americans declined
to sign. At least Krupp recognized the pact by violating it; we did
not even allow that it existed.
We should not say that the evidence against Krupp '"is full, clear, and
uncontradicted," when, as a matter of fact, a great deal of the truth
has been suppressed by our own American prosecutors as "potentially
embarrassing to certain Americans." We should not say that Krupp alone
is guilty, and imply, therefore, that the other criminals are innocent.
The whitewash brush is too narrow to cover them all at one swipe.
Anyway, Krupp goes free. I would like to be at the dock when the ship
bearing General Clay, Assistant Secretary of War John McCloy, Ambassa
dor Murphy, and General Hilldring noses into Hoboken. Perhaps these
gentlemen could tell us how much pertinent material was concealed
at the trial of Krupp.
In the meantime it would be inane to lump all our frustrations in one
basket and pitch them maniacally at "old Heinie Krupp."

this financial district missionary work.
But —in the name of peace, let us not fly into paranoidal anguish at
the thought of Krupp going Scot-free. Wc say that he violated the
Versailles Treaty—the same treaty that we righteous Americans declined
to sign. At least Krupp recognized the pact by violating it; we did
not even allow that it existed.
We should not say that the evidence against Krupp '"is full, clear, and
uncontradicted," when, as a matter of fact, a great deal of the truth
has been suppressed by our own American prosecutors as "potentially
embarrassing to certain Americans." We should not say that Krupp alone
is guilty, and imply, therefore, that the other criminals are innocent.
The whitewash brush is too narrow to cover them all at one swipe.
Anyway, Krupp goes free. I would like to be at the dock when the ship
bearing General Clay, Assistant Secretary of War John McCloy, Ambassa
dor Murphy, and General Hilldring noses into Hoboken. Perhaps these
gentlemen could tell us how much pertinent material was concealed
at the trial of Krupp.
In the meantime it would be inane to lump all our frustrations in one
basket and pitch them maniacally at "old Heinie Krupp."
