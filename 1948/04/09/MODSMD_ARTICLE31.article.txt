## Crisis Forced ERP 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP)—Acts of God, Soviet expan
sion and obstructionism, French fears of a revived
Germany, and spiraling inflation in the United
States—all combined in the winter of 1946-47 to
bring the slowly developing crisis in Europe to a
head.
The final symptoms of European economic and
political disintegration became apparent with
alarming rapidity.
After two years of mistakes here and abroad, the
American leaders under direction of Secretary of
State George C. Marshall finally concluded that
Europe could not within its own resources achieve
economic stability within a reasonable time.
They also decidcd that Russia and communism
must he stopped; by military means where neces
sary. as in Greece and Turkey, and by economic
means where possible, in Western Europe.
Marshall's decision for new action was made while
flying back from the unsuccessful Big Four Con
ference in Moscow. He concluded that the Russians
didn't want to see Europe recover quickly.
His conviction that something dramatic and com
prehensive must be done was supported strongly by
his then economics undersecretary, William L. Clay
ton. Back from Europe himself, Clayton reported
that the invisible damage to the structure and fabric
of European economy and finances was more
devastating than the physical damage which could
be seen.
Slowly the Marshall Flan began to crystallize.
Marshall based it on these convictions lie brought
back with him from Moscow:
1. No major international political problem could
be settled until the economy of Europe was stabilized.
He found economic problems at the root of all polit
ical disagreements.
2. Communism breeds and continues to breed
on economic chaos and despair. Recovery on a
broad scale would let the economic machinery of
the world function normally, thus ending condi
tions on which all kinds of totalitarianism thrives.
3. The United States, with an economy-minded
Congress, could not continue to pouT out billions
on a piecemeal, nation-by-nation basis. Congress was
demanding results. In the future, U. S. aid should
furnish "a cure rather than a mere palliative."
4. The whole concept of U. S. aid to Europe
had to be changed. The policy of furnishing only
relief—keeping people alive—had to end; hence
forth the emphasis should be on rehabilitation so
that Europe could help itself back onto its own feet.
5. Europe must take drastic steps itself and initiate
a broad program of cooperative self-help.
That was Marshall's answer to the crisis of the
winter of l!)4(i-47 which snowballed rapidly after
the turn of the year.
The severest winter in decades descended on an
already cold, hungry Europe.
Late in Febaruary. the British, hardest hit by
the winter weather, served notice they would have

to pull out of Greece. The"Truman Doctrine" to
save Greece from communism followed.
Great Britain yelled "uncle" in Germany in the
spring, asking the United States to take over most
of the dollar costs of the merged Anglo-American oc
cupation zone.
The British also suspended the policy of convert
ing sterling held by other countries into dollars.
A severe summer drought followed the hard win
ter.
Those and countless other less important prob
lems caused the European workshop, still far below
pre-war levels, to start grinding to a stop. The little
progress made with assistance of $12,000,000,000 from
the U. S. in loans and gifts was in danger of being
lost.
To stem the tide of deterioration, the adminis
tration began considering interim aid until an
overall program could be formulated. However,
while Marshall was putting (lie final touches 011 his
speech at Harvard in June, 1047, when he proposed
the plan, Congrcs was preparing for a summer re
cess. And the sentiment in Congress then was: "No
more money for European relief."
But within a few weeks, the President was calling
a special session of Congress to consider a half a bil
lion dollar interim aid bill and eventually the long
range Marshall Plan.
Ihe reappraisal of future American aid led to
Harvard, which led to the European conference
in Paris, which finally led to Congress at Wash
ington.
The prospect now is that by the first anniversary
ol the Harvard speech, the new American experiment
in combining a recovery program with an anti
communist policy will be underway.

The severest winter in decades descended on an
already cold, hungry Europe.
Late in Febaruary. the British, hardest hit by
the winter weather, served notice they would have

to pull out of Greece. The"Truman Doctrine" to
save Greece from communism followed.
Great Britain yelled "uncle" in Germany in the
spring, asking the United States to take over most
of the dollar costs of the merged Anglo-American oc
cupation zone.
The British also suspended the policy of convert
ing sterling held by other countries into dollars.
A severe summer drought followed the hard win
ter.
Those and countless other less important prob
lems caused the European workshop, still far below
pre-war levels, to start grinding to a stop. The little
progress made with assistance of $12,000,000,000 from
the U. S. in loans and gifts was in danger of being
lost.
To stem the tide of deterioration, the adminis
tration began considering interim aid until an
overall program could be formulated. However,
while Marshall was putting (lie final touches 011 his
speech at Harvard in June, 1047, when he proposed
the plan, Congrcs was preparing for a summer re
cess. And the sentiment in Congress then was: "No
more money for European relief."
But within a few weeks, the President was calling
a special session of Congress to consider a half a bil
lion dollar interim aid bill and eventually the long
range Marshall Plan.
Ihe reappraisal of future American aid led to
Harvard, which led to the European conference
in Paris, which finally led to Congress at Wash
ington.
The prospect now is that by the first anniversary
ol the Harvard speech, the new American experiment
in combining a recovery program with an anti
communist policy will be underway.
WASHINGTON (UP)—Acts of God, Soviet expan
sion and obstructionism, French fears of a revived
Germany, and spiraling inflation in the United
States—all combined in the winter of 1946-47 to
bring the slowly developing crisis in Europe to a
head.
The final symptoms of European economic and
political disintegration became apparent with
alarming rapidity.
After two years of mistakes here and abroad, the
American leaders under direction of Secretary of
State George C. Marshall finally concluded that
Europe could not within its own resources achieve
economic stability within a reasonable time.
They also decidcd that Russia and communism
must he stopped; by military means where neces
sary. as in Greece and Turkey, and by economic
means where possible, in Western Europe.
Marshall's decision for new action was made while
flying back from the unsuccessful Big Four Con
ference in Moscow. He concluded that the Russians
didn't want to see Europe recover quickly.
His conviction that something dramatic and com
prehensive must be done was supported strongly by
his then economics undersecretary, William L. Clay
ton. Back from Europe himself, Clayton reported
that the invisible damage to the structure and fabric
of European economy and finances was more
devastating than the physical damage which could
be seen.
Slowly the Marshall Flan began to crystallize.
Marshall based it on these convictions lie brought
back with him from Moscow:
1. No major international political problem could
be settled until the economy of Europe was stabilized.
He found economic problems at the root of all polit
ical disagreements.
2. Communism breeds and continues to breed
on economic chaos and despair. Recovery on a
broad scale would let the economic machinery of
the world function normally, thus ending condi
tions on which all kinds of totalitarianism thrives.
3. The United States, with an economy-minded
Congress, could not continue to pouT out billions
on a piecemeal, nation-by-nation basis. Congress was
demanding results. In the future, U. S. aid should
furnish "a cure rather than a mere palliative."
4. The whole concept of U. S. aid to Europe
had to be changed. The policy of furnishing only
relief—keeping people alive—had to end; hence
forth the emphasis should be on rehabilitation so
that Europe could help itself back onto its own feet.
5. Europe must take drastic steps itself and initiate
a broad program of cooperative self-help.

the turn of the year.
