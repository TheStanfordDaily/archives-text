Only one major kink in Stanford's improved regis
tration procedure troubles any part of the student
body. Women signing up for physical education
courses at the Women's Gym said they had to line
up tor as long as two hours before they could enroll

in gym classes.
When their choice courses in
tennis, swimming, and golf filled
up, the students either milled
around the desks hoping for a
vacancy or two to appear, or else
they signed up for one of the
unfilled courses in dancing and
fencing.
Some upper division women who
had already completed lower di
vision physical education require
ments quit the lines when their

favorite classes filled. Most of them wondered why
women could not pre-reg for gym courses like they
did for other studies. 'Couldn't seat cards be handed
out" they asked, "if facilities are so short?" Upper
division women determined to sign up for gym
classes found waiting lines stretched out to the
street by 1 p.m., and they found additional shorter
lines for each course inside the building.
Mrs. Maud Lombard Knapp, women's physical
»education director, summed up the basis of most
of the confusion as her department saw it:
1. Many women do not sign up at the-correct
times. If students registered at the gym during
the hour coresponding to their alphabet breakdown
at the Administration Building, waiting lines would
not appear. Places in limited classes are divided
equally among each of the registration groups: In
addition, a few openings are held until the afternoon
when women registering late may appear. It is for
these few openings, Mrs. Knapp said, that the long
after-lunch line may form. Students missing morn
ing gym registration try to crowd into the few
vacancies saved for the late sign-ups.
2. Afternoon registrants wait for openings. Be
cause they did not sign up in the morning, the women
loiter around the gj'm waiting for vacancies in choice
classes to be put up on the block. The milling crowd
only serves to create confusion. There is only a
limited number of teachers, and the department
cannot overload instructor and equipment facilities.
The lottery system of handing out class positions
is not a fair method of distribution, the department
believes. Under their present system, however, an
equal number of class openings are allocated
throughout the alphabet. The probability of chance
that appears under the lottery system does not
affect current methods.
Initiating a pre-registration program in the physical
education department is hardly possible, Mrs. Knapp
explained, because gym classes meet until finals
week. The department does not have enough instruc
tors to handle pre-reg activities and carry on classes
at the same time.

the hour coresponding to their alphabet breakdown
at the Administration Building, waiting lines would
not appear. Places in limited classes are divided
equally among each of the registration groups: In
addition, a few openings are held until the afternoon
when women registering late may appear. It is for
these few openings, Mrs. Knapp said, that the long
after-lunch line may form. Students missing morn
ing gym registration try to crowd into the few
vacancies saved for the late sign-ups.
2. Afternoon registrants wait for openings. Be
cause they did not sign up in the morning, the women
loiter around the gj'm waiting for vacancies in choice
classes to be put up on the block. The milling crowd
only serves to create confusion. There is only a
limited number of teachers, and the department
cannot overload instructor and equipment facilities.
The lottery system of handing out class positions
is not a fair method of distribution, the department
believes. Under their present system, however, an
equal number of class openings are allocated
throughout the alphabet. The probability of chance
that appears under the lottery system does not
affect current methods.
Initiating a pre-registration program in the physical
education department is hardly possible, Mrs. Knapp
explained, because gym classes meet until finals
week. The department does not have enough instruc
tors to handle pre-reg activities and carry on classes
at the same time.

Only one major kink in Stanford's improved regis
tration procedure troubles any part of the student
body. Women signing up for physical education
courses at the Women's Gym said they had to line
up tor as long as two hours before they could enroll

in gym classes.
When their choice courses in
tennis, swimming, and golf filled
up, the students either milled
around the desks hoping for a
vacancy or two to appear, or else
they signed up for one of the
unfilled courses in dancing and
fencing.
Some upper division women who
had already completed lower di
vision physical education require
ments quit the lines when their

favorite classes filled. Most of them wondered why
women could not pre-reg for gym courses like they
did for other studies. 'Couldn't seat cards be handed
out" they asked, "if facilities are so short?" Upper
division women determined to sign up for gym
classes found waiting lines stretched out to the
street by 1 p.m., and they found additional shorter
lines for each course inside the building.
Mrs. Maud Lombard Knapp, women's physical
»education director, summed up the basis of most
of the confusion as her department saw it:
1. Many women do not sign up at the-correct
times. If students registered at the gym during
the hour coresponding to their alphabet breakdown
at the Administration Building, waiting lines would
not appear. Places in limited classes are divided
equally among each of the registration groups: In
addition, a few openings are held until the afternoon
when women registering late may appear. It is for
