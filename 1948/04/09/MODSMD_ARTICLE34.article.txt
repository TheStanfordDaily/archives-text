# Twelve Students Drop Out Of Stanford to Save Mankind
## 
### BY HERB SMITH AND GORDON NESS 
(Editor's Note: Last quarter two Daily reporters were assigned the
task of finding out all they could about "Students Concerned." Little
was known of the organization, its personnel, or its aims at that time.
Below The Daily presents their findings.)

Twelve Stanford students have voluntarily dropped out of
school in the last two months because they are firmly con
vinced that mankind is in danger of extinction.
These and 18 other members of Students Concerned, repre
senting 12 universities, are now taking active part in a training
program at a former YMCA camp ♦

near La Honda. This is the first step |
in a year's time-out which they |
have called in their normal college
careers.
STUDENTS CONCERNED was i
originally inspired by the Sequoia
Seminar at Asilomar, which was
conducted last summer by Professor
Harry J. Rathbun of Stanford Law
School.
Last quarter in an all-day bull
>ession, a group of students who
had attended the seminar decided
that the time for action had come.
They quit school, made their tem
porary headquarters in Professor
Rathbun's home, and proceeded to
make their plans.
Within nine days, personal contri- i
but ions totaling 527.000 had been se- |
cured. With this as a nucleus, Stu- :
dents Concrned traveled to other j
universities in an effort to interest
more people in their plan.
ESSENTIALLY THAT PLAN is a
religious one. with the greatest effort ;
being expended in an attempt to :
understand the mind and thought
of Jesus. Students Concerned feel i
that if the religious motivation of
Jesus, Saint Paul, and similar his
torical figures could be understood
and applied universally, the survival
of mankind could be assured.
Crystallization of the plan has
fallen into this pattern.
1. A group of Pacific Coast stu
dents will be chosen on the basis 1
of their desire for service and for
their maturity.
2. They will undergo a three
month training period at a site near j
Stanford, with professors donating
their time to special seminars.
3. Three months' work on Eu- .
ropcan relief and reconstruction
projects will follow. It is hoped
that a small party may gain ad- j
mittance to the Soviet Union on such |
a project.
4. Back in the U. S., the group
will devote at least nine months to j
peace education on campuses, before
community forums, and by promot
ing such causes as the National
Students Association and the Worlds i
Student Service Fund.
STUDENTS CONCERNED is a
group of serious thinking young |
people. They are not immature.
The average age of the founding ;
croup was 26. They are unselfishly
trying to do something about the
mess the world is in today.
However, since Students Con- j
cerned seems to have such a 24- ;
carat roposition to offer, we can't j
help but wonder why they arc so j
secretive with facts and evasive in j
interviews.
WE ALSO WONDER why con- ;
jrete facts can't be given in place
■>112 such phrases as "Students Con
•erned are committed to action upon
he most creative possibility they '
•an discover in each situation."'

task of finding out all they could about "Students Concerned." Little
was known of the organization, its personnel, or its aims at that time.
Below The Daily presents their findings.)

Twelve Stanford students have voluntarily dropped out of
school in the last two months because they are firmly con
vinced that mankind is in danger of extinction.
These and 18 other members of Students Concerned, repre
senting 12 universities, are now taking active part in a training
program at a former YMCA camp ♦

near La Honda. This is the first step |
in a year's time-out which they |
have called in their normal college
careers.
STUDENTS CONCERNED was i
originally inspired by the Sequoia
Seminar at Asilomar, which was
conducted last summer by Professor
Harry J. Rathbun of Stanford Law
School.
Last quarter in an all-day bull
>ession, a group of students who
had attended the seminar decided
that the time for action had come.
They quit school, made their tem
porary headquarters in Professor
Rathbun's home, and proceeded to
make their plans.
Within nine days, personal contri- i
but ions totaling 527.000 had been se- |
cured. With this as a nucleus, Stu- :
dents Concrned traveled to other j
universities in an effort to interest
more people in their plan.
ESSENTIALLY THAT PLAN is a
religious one. with the greatest effort ;
being expended in an attempt to :
understand the mind and thought
of Jesus. Students Concerned feel i
that if the religious motivation of
Jesus, Saint Paul, and similar his
torical figures could be understood
and applied universally, the survival
of mankind could be assured.
Crystallization of the plan has
fallen into this pattern.
1. A group of Pacific Coast stu
dents will be chosen on the basis 1
of their desire for service and for
their maturity.
2. They will undergo a three
month training period at a site near j
Stanford, with professors donating
their time to special seminars.
3. Three months' work on Eu- .
ropcan relief and reconstruction
projects will follow. It is hoped
that a small party may gain ad- j
mittance to the Soviet Union on such |
a project.
4. Back in the U. S., the group
will devote at least nine months to j
peace education on campuses, before
community forums, and by promot
ing such causes as the National
Students Association and the Worlds i
Student Service Fund.
STUDENTS CONCERNED is a
group of serious thinking young |
people. They are not immature.
The average age of the founding ;
croup was 26. They are unselfishly
