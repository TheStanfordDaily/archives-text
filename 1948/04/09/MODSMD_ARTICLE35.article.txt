# Orchesis Program To Be Repeated
## 
### 
Orchesis' annual spring dance
concert, presented last night in Me
morial Auditorium, was well re
ceived. A repeat performance will
be given Saturday at 8:15 p.m.
One of the most effective dance
interpretations was "There Are No
Tears," choreographed by Jeanne
Rogers and Phyllis Moore. Through
the use of blue lights and white cos
tumes the feeling of complete se
renity was depicted in the smoothly
flowing dance.
'"Spiritus Fermenti" and "Horn
pipe" presented the essential ele
ment of humor in the program. The
first, a peasant dance, presents the
picture of a man who gets drunk on
the wine he is making. "Hornpipe"
shows the actions of two sailors
when the captain is away.â€”McKeon
