# Ski Team Enters 3-Day Meet
## 
### 
This weekend the Stanford ski
team invades Donner Summit to
compete in the Vanderbilt Memorial
Race, sponsored by the University
of California.
The downhill event will be held
on Mount Lincoln this afternoon.
The cross-country and slalom will
be held tomorrow, and the meet will
end on Sunday with the jumping at
Tahoa City.
Captain Jim Brehler's boys have
made a good name for themselves
in previous meets this year.
In this season's Reno Winter Car
nival the Indian team placed third,

behind Nevada and Utah, and in the
PCISU championships at Yosemite
in mid - March the Indians forced
Nevada into the last event, the
cross-country, before the Wolfpack
could claim the championship. Bill
Sigal led the Stanford team in this
meet with a second in both the
jumping and the downhill, and was
fourteenth in the slalom.
The team has also competed in the
Silver Dollar Derby, the California
state meet, and the nationals at Sun
Valley.
