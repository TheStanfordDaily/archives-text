### 
Stanford's varsity swimmers w
face the mermen from Cal Poly in
dual meet at the Encina Pool tl
afternoon at 3.
The meeting, which is a last mi
ute addition to the Farm varsity
schedule, will be the first for t
Indians since before Spring vacati<
Although tha visiting Muslim
are among the favorites to aim
the 2C2A swimming honors tl
year, it is generally conceded th
they are not in the same class wi
most of the Stanford starters. It
expected, therefore, that Coach Tr
Haynie will start a number of 1
reserves in an attempt to even t
meet up, as well as to give the J
a taste of intercollegiate comp
tition.
