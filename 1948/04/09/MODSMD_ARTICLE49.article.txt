# Tracksters Open Season Against SJ Spartans; Freshmen Tackle 3 junior College Teams
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR VIC PALMIERI 
Farm track fans will have their
irst chance oi' the new season to
•iew the '48 edition of the varsity
•rack team tomorrow when they
rieet the powerful San Jose Stats
jpartans at the Stanford Stadium,
veuther permitting. The field events
ire slated to begin at 1:45. while the
nile will start promptly at 2 p.m.
This important contest looms as a
lip and tuck affair. The Spartans
rounced the Olympic Club 95 to 36
n their only meet of the season,
.bile the Cardinal spikesters are
et untested.
HOWEVER, the Indians have
hown great possibilities in many
vents, and some of the pre-season
ials have been good. On the whole
ley have already shown improve
ment and are much deeper than last
ear's squad, which was composed
mostly of frosh.
San Jose's star sprinter, Don
malley. will be very tough to beat
i both of the sprints. Soph Bob
/ood, to date the Cards' best cen
iry runner, will give Smalley a
ood race. Other Stanford entries
tc'ude Gordy Levy and Bud Rich
•r in both the 100 and the 220, and
-Mevan Bill Smith in the 100. Wood
ay also surprise in the 220.
THE QUARTER-MILK seems to
■ the Indians' strongest race. Lar
• Hoff, Terry Maxwell. A 1 Wilkins,
id Pitch Johnson are all potential
inners. This makes the Card relay
jsition also strong, with Rod Rey
jlcls and George Grimes also to
loose from. The latter race could
:-cide the meet. San Jose's Fred
angini did 51.1 against the Olym
c club.
The 880 might be the best race of
e day. Veteran George Grimes of
e Indians is always a dangerous
inner. Thelno Knowles of San
>se did 1:56.2 recently, so he must
given the edge. However,
nowles may run the quarter-mile
id. if pressed, may not be at full
rength fur the 880.
ON THE OTHER HAND. San
>se may want to save Knowles for
e relay. He overtook the Olympic
üb's entry, running anchor lap for
e Spartans in that meet. Berny
agner and A 1 Holubar will both
• right up there in the 880.
In the mile, the Spartans' Gene
lynes also will be tough to beat,
gainst the Olympic Club he ran a
nsational 4:21.5. Soph A 1 Lyons
11 be hot on his tracks and will
zeive a good test of endurance,
d OiY and John Figg-Hoblyn are
finitely in the running.
JOSE RAEL of the Cards, who
s run 9:55, will be the favorite to
p the two-mile event. Bob Knox.
10 won the event for San Jose
■t year, did not place against the
ympic Club, but may improve
er his best time of 10:03. A 1

Lyons will probably double up in
this event.
The meet may be decided in the
hurdles. The Cards have four can
didates. Downing McKee. Dell Rus
sell. Skip Kent, and Bill Kreitz. re
cent JC transfer, in the highs. In
addition to Russell and Kreitz, the
Cards will have Bill Smith, Bob
Bryan, and Fred Fank in the lows,
all good men. San Jose's Passey
brothers are tops.
ALL EYES in the stadium will
be on Otis Chandler, star shot-put
ter of the Indians. Otis has already
thrown several practice tosses
around 52 feet, and there is no
telling where he will stop. Steve
McKee. Norm Nourse. and Judge
Finley will give him good support.
There is nothing very hopeful in
the discus, as the Spartans have
three excellent winners in this
event. Ray Overhouse. Woody Linn,
and Grant Denmark. As yet no
Stanford man has hit 150 feet.
BUD HELD, who has hit well over
200 feet in the javelin, will probably
be in top form. Chuck Coker, Scott
Goldsborough, and Mike Durket
will also compete.
In the jumps, San Jose appears to
have the upper hand. Double win
ner Constantine Varneck will be
tough to beat. Bob Bryan. Bob Ghi
lotti, and Don Auxier are entered in
the high jump, while Bryan. Mike
Durket. Fred Fank. and Marty An
derson are broad-jump contenders.
Heading for the sky in the pole
vault will be the Indians' Bill Lar
son and the Spartans' Howard Over
house. Both are already over 13
feet, and a good duel is in the mak
ing. Marty Anderson will also leap
for the Indians.

Stanford's frosh spikesters face
their second test of the season to
morrow at Angell Field, when they
meet Sacramento, Salinas, and
Menlo JC's in a four-way fracas,
beginning at 10:15.
The yearlings took it out on San
Mateo JC March 5 in the curtain
raiser to the tune of 88-43. As the
score indicates, Coach Ray Dean's
thinclads found little trouble anni
hilating the Bulldogs. Tomorrow's
story, however, promises to be dif
ferent, inasmuch as team depth as
sumes much less importance in a
four-way meet.
AMONG THE SPRINT MEN,
Johnny Robertson, Ronnie Buck,
and Errol French, all of whom
placd against San Mateo, will be
ready to go again in the dashes.
John Holloway, who won the 100
and 220 in the San Mateo meet, may
be able to run despite his spring
football obligations.
The quartermile looms as a Stan
ford race all the way, what with ace
flicks Williams, and Chuck Trask
having made a clean sweep of the
i event against San Mateo.
AGAIN IN THE HALF-MILE,
! the frosh have little cause to worry
with Lorry Gordon out to better his
early-season mark of 1:59.05. The
loss of Drew Terramorse, another
| outstanding performer at the mid
dle distance, cut short what might
i have been a thrilling duel between
: these two boys. Terramorse broke
j his ankle when he hit soft ground
while rounding the inside track.
I Norm Miller will till Drew's shoes.
The distance events look like the
weakest point in the frosh lineup
for today. Woody Bray, miler, how
ever, has recovered from an injury
and may help the Cards'" chances
along with George Mooers and Dave
Harrah in the two-mile.
WITH PETE YOUNG. Bill Nefi.
and Bob Bryan in the high and low
stick events, the frosh have hurdle
strength to spare.
Local hopes in the field events '
rest with high-jumper Dick Saylor, ;
who has hit 5 ft. 10 in.; Dick Abra
i ham. shot-putter; and javelin man
Darrell Jordan.


FRED FANK—double trouble for
the Spartans.
