# Stanfordites Requested to Cut Down On Use of Electricity and Water
## 
### 
Precipitated by the statewide power shortage and the lack of available
water here at Stanford, an appeal has been leveled bv the Business Office
to all occupants of campus living quarters to cut down sharply on all
excessive use of electricity and water.
The appeal for voluntary action on the electrical question will remain

in effect until such time as a
definite plan for a 20 per cent power
cut has been formulated.
Alf Brandin, business manager,
stated yesterday that a survey is
now being made to ascertain the
most desirable places on campus
where the power cut may be en
forced.
Brandin said that he hoped stu
dents would realize the gravity of
the situation and, among other
things "cut their shower time from
a half hour to five minutes."
He said that the reason for the
proposed plan to cut. the use of
power is that of a mandate issued
recently by state power "czar" Rob
ert O'Brien "to cut 20 per cent oft
kilowatt hour consumption."
