# Stanford's Polio Emergency Aid Unit Teaches Treatment, Helps Care for III
## 
### BY NICK GILROY 
Four polio epidemic aid units are
now operating in the United States.
These units, all maintained by the
National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, are located at Stanford
and Northwestern Universities, the
D. T.. Watson School, which is affil
iated with the University of Penn
sylvania, and Tobin Hospital in Bos
ton. The Tobin Hospital unit was
foi merly connected with Harvard
University.
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE of these
units is to teach the modern meth
ods of polio treatment and to assist
in the care of patients during a very
limited period of time. Their value
lies in the fact that they form a
plan whereby patients can be cared
for by a group that is accustomed
to work togethed.
Each unit is composed of a head
nhysician, a pediatrician, two physi
cal therapists, -nd an orthopedic
nurse. They r ;-, to the epidemic

area nearest them at the request of
either the state or local department
of health, or the county or state
medical society.
Each unit serves one general area
of the country. In case of an emer
gency the groups can be shifted
around. Last summer Northwestern
operated as far west as Idaho, and
part of the Boston Hospital unit
went to Germany to handle an out
break among American Army per
sonnel there.
THE NEED for polio epidemic aid
units is mainly in small towns and
other thinly populated locations.
Large cities such as New York, Chi
cago, or Los Angeles possess the
necessary facilities for treating
cases. The last city for instance has
polio at all seasons but because of
adequate facilities is able to handle
•>nv outbreak of the disease.
The units bring no equipment
• ; th them when they move into an

[ epidemic area. Necessary apparatus
is obtained from local authorities.
! Extra personnel can also be re
| cruitea from doctors and physical
' therapists outside the actual units.
THE CHIEF COST of the units
stems from the fact that they must
I be maintained all year round, even
\ during the winter season when an
| epidemic is unlikely to occur in
i most locales. The teams must be
j ready to go into action on 24-hour
j notice. "ftiey rarely have to remain
I in one locality for more than three
j months.
Dr. William Northway, assistant
dean of Stanford Medical School
and associate professor of medicine,
is in charge of the Stanford unit.
Miss Lucil'e Daniels is director of
physical therapy services.
Other members of the unit are se
lected from the staff, and selection
is made according to their individ
ual responsibilities at the time the
unit is called out.
