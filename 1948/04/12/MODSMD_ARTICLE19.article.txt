and physicists
On the surface, the viscose process for
rayon seems fairly simple. Cellulose
from cotton or wood is steeped in
NaOH to give alkali cellulose, which is
treated with OS . to form cellulose xan
thate. Adding NaOH gives molasses
like "viscose," which issquirted through
spinnerets into a coagulating bath ot
acid and salt to form from 500 to 1,000
fila me n t s simultaneously:
R*-0H + NaOH — > R-ONa + H O

Du Pont scientists were working to
improve on the properties of rayon
made by this process when, in 1928, a
rubber company asked for a rayon yarn
that would be stronger than cotton for
tire cords. The problem was given to a
team of organic, physical, and analyti
cal chemists, chemical and mechanical
engineers, and physicists.
Theoretical and Applied Studies
In developing the new improved rayon,
a number of theoretical studies were
carried out: for example, (1) rates of
diffusion of the coagulating bath into
the viscose filaments, (2) the mechan
ism of coagulation of viscose, (3) the
relationship between fiber structure and
properties by x-rays, and (4) a phase
study of spinning baths.
Concurrently, applied research was
necessary. This proceeded along many
lines, but the main problem was to per
fect the spinning technique. It was
known that a short delay in the bath
between the spinneret and the stretch
ing operation allowed greater tension
on the filaments. Du Pont engineers,
therefore, designed a series of rollers,
each revolving faster than the previous
one, to increase the tension gradually.

In addition, a textile finish was de
veloped that combined just the right
amount of plasticizing action and lubri
cating power, allowing the filaments to
twist evenly in forming the cord. A new
adhesive was prepared to join the yarn
with rubber. New twisting techniques
for cord manufacture were found, since
the usual methods caused loss in rayon
strength.
Engineering Problems Solved
Chemical and mechanical engineers
were faced with the design and opera
tion of equipment for more than 15
different types of unit operations. Equip
ment had to operate every minute of t he
day, vet turn out perfectly uniform
yarn. It was necessary to filter the vis
cose so carefully that it would pass
through spinning jet holes less than
A, 1000 th of an inch without plugging.
Some of the most exacting temperature
and humidity control applications in
the chemical industry were required.
Out of this cooperation among scien
tists—ranging from studies of cellulose
as a high polymer to design of enormous
plants—came a new product, "Cor
dura" high-tenacity rayon, as strong as
mild steel, yet able to stand up under
repeated flexing. Today, this yarn is al
most 100'' stronger than 20 years ago.
Tires made with it are less bulky and
cooler running, yet give greater mileage
under the most punishing operating

conditions. In "Cordura," men of Du
Pont havemade one of their most im
portant contributions to the automo
tive industry.
