# Vets Chance Postal Loss
## 
### 
Veterans are needlessly taking the
chance of !osing their money and
their insurance protection when
they mail cash to pay the premiums
on National Service Life Insurance
policies, the Veterans Administration
warned last Friday.
The VA pointed out that a vet
eran making his payments in cash
through ordinary mail has no way
to prove he made the payment in
the event it fails to reach the VA.
Failure to receive policy payments
leaves the VA no choice but to
I lapse the policy.
Veterans are urged to use money
orders, postal notes, or checks for
NSLI payments, and also to use the
yellow envelopes furnished by the
VA in mailing payments.
