# Servants, Luxuries Found in Encina History; Two Robles Have Housed Freshman Women
## 
### JAQUI ATKIN 
When Stanford University was
first built the Stanfords wished it to
be a resident university. Encina and
Roble were the first dorms built,
and housed the entire student body.
Radical changes have been made
since. Old Roble has been aban
doned and a new one built, and the
two halls are now "home" to the
freshman class alone.
"Good o!d clays" at Encina Hall
were really just that, when the
dorm opened at the end of the nine
teenth century. One young rough
was especially impressed, and wrote
home the following letter:
"EVERYTHING IS BRAND NEW
and of the finest. The rooms are all
finished off with hard plaster, and
contain . . . two single iron bed
steads with bronze trimmings, a
large study table, two single or one
double wardrobe, a commode, mir
ror, two rugs, four antique oak
chairs, and a stationary washstand
with hot and cold water faucets. ..."
He continues, "In the corridors
are speaking tubes and electric but

j tons to call for whatever we want,
i . . . The food and the service are
j both of the very best, and there are
I dozens of Chinamen on hand to at
i tend to every want. It is real Fifth
! Avenue Hotel style, and all for
! twenty dollars a month."
Encina was modeled after a hotel
at Lake Silva Plana, Swiss Enga
, dine, Austria, where the Stanfords
( once spent a weekend.
WHEN THE HALL opened the
| electric connections were not yet in,
; and Mrs. Stanford had forbidden the i
! use of kerosene since the lamps
j might explode and set the dormitory
j on fire. Hence the boys used can
! dies for a brief time.
In contrast to the present long
lines of men waiting for their meals
is this description by one youth:
"At 6:30 a.m. the gong rings on
each floor, announcing . . . break
fast in half an hour. From this time
| on heavy footsteps are heard on the
uncarpeted hall ways; groups of
} girls come walking arm in arm from
Roble Hall, where as yet there are
no dining accommodations for the

co-eds. or 'angels' as they are
known here. . . ."
DESTRUCTION. VANDALISM,
and thievery were so prevalent that <
the city office sent down aS night i
watchman an ex - policeman with I
courage and little discretion.
Since the early days, Encina has j
been the site of practical jokes and
waterbagging, including such inci- ;
dents as sheep in the halls (1932) i
and an Austin on the third floor !
(1934).
Compared with Encina, life at
Roble has been relatively mild ;
throughout the years.
OLD ROBLI 3 was constructed on
the west side of the Quad in 1891. j
Originally planned as Encina was,
the structure was altered from the 1
beginning because the building was I
needed within three months.
When the first girls arrived on
Oct. 1. 1891, the plasterer had just |
finished work. The "angels" found |
white woollen blankets on their
beds (the men had red blankets at
Encina) and a Bible for each, the
gift of Mrs. Stanford.
New Roble was built on the edge
of Lake Lagunita and opened Nov. |
28, 1918. Bcause all the men were
in (he army, the first hashers were ;
women.
Old Roble is now known as Se
quoia, and housed roughs until it
was condemned and abandoned in I
1945.
Once a year for several decades
Roble has been the site of either
peaceful serenading or violent at
tack, following the traditional frosh j
Pajamarino.
Here too, as well as in Branner. J
are the objectives of the bad end
of the three-to-one ratio. Surpris
ingly enough, the grade averages
are high.
Originally Roble housed 200 girls,
but nearly a hundred more have j
been crowded into the two- and i
three-room suites. The overflow of
freshman women is hpused at Bran
ner, surrounded by upper - class j
women.
