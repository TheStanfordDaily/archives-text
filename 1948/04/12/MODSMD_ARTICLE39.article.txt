# Freshmen Spark Class Spirit In Sports, Farm Government

### CARYL HARMS 
In an editorial last February, The
Daily commended the return of
class spirit to Stanford. ' Perhaps I
the primary reason behind this re
turn has been the outstanding |
freshman class," said the editorial,
and it went on to enumerate some
of the achievements of 51.
Up to that time and since then the J
frosh have indeed compiled an en- j
viable record in school activities.
FIRST EVIDENCE of unusual in
terest in student body affairs came j
when 400 freshmen petitioned Ex- j
j com for a postponement of their |
I c'ass elections, in order to gain time j
J to become better acquainted with I
their own members and choose class j
j officers.
This political awareness continued J
| as the frosh turned out for a pre- I
| election rally to meet their candi- t
: dates, and then recorded a vote of
approximately 78 per cent in the !
primaries and the finals.
When the unfortunate incidents j
; occurred at the Pajamarino, the j
i class of '51, realizing its responsibil- I
ity, promptly organized a committee i
to investigate the situation. This ;
i group, after collecting information, 1
drew up recommendations for next
year's Pajamarino committee, sug- â– 
: gesting preventive measures to j
avoid a repetition of such mob vio- *
! lence.
IN ATHLETICS, frosh teams have

| shown considerable ability, the foot
ball team going through the season
undefeated and once tied lo capture
; the* southern division championship.
J Indicative of the enthusiasm and
; support of the rest of the class was
' the rally held on the Encina steps
before the Papooses tackled their
toughest opposition, UCLA.
On thg job to keep Cal from raid
j ing the campus before the Big Game.
I the frosh boys also contributed one
of the biggest bonfires in the school's
I history with a blazing pile that
towered 40 feet into the air.
The first classbook since 1042 ap
; peared with the publishing of the
j '51 edition containing pictures of
I most of the freshman class as a
handy reference for blind dates.
WHEN TIIEY I ACEI) some so
i called competition from the sopho
, mores, the frosh again demonstrated
their superiority by capturing the
j trophy for the Frosh-Soph Jambo
; ree weekend. The margin of victory
j was supplied by the football game.
! after they had broken even in the
j field events and won the mural
i award.
! In addition, many freshmen have
1 taken an active part in the work of
SIRO, campus publications, Rally
i Com, Gaieties, YWCA, and the De
; bating Club.
Officers in charge of this so-far
| extremely successful year have been
President Tom August and Secre
tary-Treasurer Louise Burrill, aided
j by Freshman Excom members Pat
Murphy, Gee-Gee Anderson. Jean
MeCallum, Winifred Ainsworth, Jo
Lyon, Betty Colkett, June Daniel,
Gene Allen. John Motheral, Don
