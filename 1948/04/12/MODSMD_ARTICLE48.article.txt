# Frosh Nine Meets San Mateo
## 
### 
After a week of inactivity, Stan
ford's freshmen will return to base
ball action this afternoon when they
play San Mateo JC on the frosh
diamond at 3. Rain and wet grounds
caused postponement of both the
San Jose Slate frosh and San Mateo
JC games last week.
The varsity team will meet Ful
ierton JC this afternoon.
In addition to stopping all play,
the rains wiped out all but one j
practice session. Thus, one workout j
in the past nine days is all the j
freshmen will have to prepare !
themselves for three games this ;
week. After today's game the Cards j
will travel to Santa Clara Wednes

day for a giime with the Bronco
Colts and up to Berkeley Saturday
to tangle with the Cal Cubs in the
; second of their three-game series.
Probable Indian batting order for
I this afternoon's game:
Bruce Cameron, ss; Denny TufTa
nelli, cf; Sal Colletto, 3b; Jim Tra
bucco. If; Dick Clegg, c; Bi!i Her
ron, rf; Ken La Crosse, 2b; Don
McComber, lb; and Jim Claypool, p.
