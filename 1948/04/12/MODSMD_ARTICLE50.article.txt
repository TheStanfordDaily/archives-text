# Track Meet Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Because the floods took over (he
Stanford Stadium last Saturday, lo
cal track fans will see the postponed
Indian-Spartan track meet tomor
row afternoon at 3:30 at Angell
Fie'd. The frosh meet was post
poned indefinitely.
George Grimes, star half-miler.
and George Mooers, distance man,
were elected captains of the varsity
and frosh squads respectively over
the weekend.
City newspapers have hinted sev
eral times that Stanford Coach Jack
Weiershauser is loaded with talent
and set to surprise this season, but
Jack doesn't see it that way. He
admits having a few men who will
be consistent winners, but after that,
things get tough.
SOMI (>! THE CARD sparklers
are easy to figure. First, there's the
big b'o. l 1 guy, Otis Chandler, who
has I eci tossing the shot in the vi
cinity of 52 feet. Sophomore Chan
dler it still improving and could
devc' jp into the best iron-ball man
on the coast. He broke a long
standing freshman record last sea
son at 47 ft. 11 in.
Spear-man Bud Held should be
another who will be gathering in
regular first-place points. The long
and strong Held has thrown the
javelin over 220 feet in practice al
ready, and he needs no more dis
tance than that to win his dual
meet contests with yardage to spare.
Besides these men, Stanford has
others who could deliver. George
Grimes in the 880. Terry Maxwell
in the sprints, and Gay Bryan in the
high jumps are all dangerous, only
to mention a few.
With USC practically out of the
question, the big objective of the
season will be to turn the tables on
the Golden Bear. Right now it looks
as if Stanford has the stuff to do it.
Anyway it'll be a better season than
last year.
