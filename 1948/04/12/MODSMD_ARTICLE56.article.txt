# Frosh Teams Building Future Stanford Greats
## 
### BY JOHN HERBOLD 
Stanford's pendulum of athletics may well be on the upswing
if the athletes of the class of '51 can perform as capably as
varsity men, as they did as frosh players. Varsity coaches
Schwartz, Dean, Wolter, Weirshauser, et al, wait with open arms
and favorable eyes for the arrival of new Frankie Alberts, Lloyd

Merrimans, Ward Walkups, Jim
Pollards, and Hank Luisettis from
the ranks of freshmen sports.
The records of the frosh squads
have proved that the balance of
athletic power may lie in their
hands, and it will be up to them
to turn the chain of events and
return Stanford to the top of the
pack in all sports, be it football,
tennis, water polo, or track.
SO FAR IN ATHLETIC contests
held during the years '47 and '48
the frosh team members have
shown that they are worthy of wear
ing the Cardinal and White of Stan
ford.
Most of the time they have
brought home the laurels of victory,
and the few times they have fallen,
they have done so only after putting
up a game battle to the end. No
Stanford frosh team has been badly
beaten in any tilt held so far.
TIIE BEST FROSH record so far
is probably owned by the football
team coached by Chuck Taylor. The
yearlings won games from San Jose,
Santa Clara, USC. and Cal. A tie
game with UCLA gave them the
championship since the Bruins also
tied USC.
Many of these frosh footballers
will be digging their cleats into the
turf during '48. '49, and '50. Promi
nent frosh players were linemen
Don Lucas, "Tex" White, Dick
Schulze, Terry Watiers. Dick Abra
ham, and many others.
Backfield stars were Boyd Ben
son. Tom Shaw. John Holloway,
Gordon MacLachlan, Jim Hayes,
John Banks. Ken LaCrosse, Bob Os
wald, Harry Hunt, and an unlimited
list of others who showed plenty of
promise for the future.
COACH JACK DANA'S '51 bas
ketballers didn't fare quite as well
as the football team, but thoir record
at the end of season play showed
that they had bowled over a number
of top - notch opponents, including
the Cal frosh twice. Eight tilts were
annexed by the locals, and six were
dropped, all by close scores to good
teams.
Marv Gelber led the frosh five,
aided by Bill Herron, Don Patch,
Lloyd Kelly, Derek Bok, Paul Wat
son, Fran Watson, Captain Dick
Clegg, Hal Campen, Ken Gardner,
and Lenny Hughes.
The baseball team finds itself in
the middle of its season with a six
won, two lost, and one tied record.
'Bush" Bushong, former profes
sional star, tutors the squad, which
is one of the best in Stanford his
tory.
Having held only one meet, not j
much can be said as yet about the
track team. However, that one meet
was a solid win over San Mateo JC.
SS-43. The quarter mile and the
relay seem to be the strongest events
with Cass Ely, Joss Scroggv. Hicks i

i Williams, and Chuck Trask per
forming.
Lorry Gordon looks good in the
half-mile, as docs Johnny Robertson
in the sprints and Bob Bryan in
the low hurdles and broad jump.
DARNELL JORDAN. Dick Abra
ham. and Bob Scott are the main
eventers in the javelin, shot, and
discus, respectively.
Boasting a perfect record with
wins over four opponents, the swim
ing team is heading for a fine sea
son. John Mowat and Bill Millard
in the distances, Chuck Kelly in
3he 50-yard, Don Patch in the
j sprints. Hub Stokely in the 220.
Don Weeden and Dave Elliott in
the backstroke, and Marsh Pearl
man in the breast stroke have all
helped keep the unblemished record.
Jim Harris does the diving.
The crew, water polo, and tennis
squads have also shown prominence.
Coming Stanford successes may
be attributed to the experience,
; ability, spirit, and enjoyment gained
by the players in the different sports
! when they were members of frosh
teams representing Stanford and the
class of '51.


RIARV GELBER, who starred on
Coach Jack Dana's frosh basket -
ball team, is typical of the good
material coming up from the
many high - ranking frosh teams
to help mold next year's \arsity
squads.
