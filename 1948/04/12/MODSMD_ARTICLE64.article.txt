## In the Spotlight 
### 
Today, the freshman class of '51 is in the spotlight, both on
campus and universally.
Today, members of the class are busily engaged in studying
history, to determine what has been done in the past. Tomor
row, they will be making history.
As the national and international situation stands, the future
is unpredictable to the frosh. Talk of draft and universal military
training mingles with discussion of vocations and occupations.
Freshman men nearing or at the ages of 19 don't know whether
they will enter their sophomore year next fall or three years
from now.
Accompanying discussion on the possibilities of draft or UMT
is discussion on the need for such measures. Can peace be
obtained through armed or unarmed preparation?
These are serious thoughts for a class of which the majority
were fortunate enough to escape fighting in World War 11.
Nevertheless, the freshman class is taking full advantage of
the present. Just out of high school, the majority of the class
has not been marked by the seriousness of battle and the ob
stacles of the post war world. The majority realize the purpose
of college, and are quick to take advantage of the education.
This group is also quick to take advantage of the social and
extra-curricular benefits of campus life.
Freshmen can be found in practically every activity. Their
interest in class and university activities is acute. They have
renewed a spark at Stanford that was extinguished by the war.
How long that spark will remain is hard to say. The same goes
for the three to one ratio.
But regardless of the past and despite what may come in the
future, it can not be denied that, at the present, a new spirit
reigneth.
