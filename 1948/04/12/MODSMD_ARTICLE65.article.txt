# CAMPUS OPINION
## Let's Face the Issues 
### 
To the Editor:
This partisan political row is likely to be an issue in the coming
piesidential elections. Let's look at it logically for once instead of
blindly running to and fro screaming "freedom." Freedom in anything—
thought, word, action —implies sacrifice. He who has freedom did not
yell or fight or hold mass demonstrations to get it; he worked hard
to make himself a decent, independently-thinking and acting and there
fore potent citizen.
The issue suggested in The Daily Friday: '"Students should be free
to organize political groups." It's a blind stab at something which could
be very good. Here's why:
1. Students want free exchange of partisan political views. This is good.
2. Organized political groups are organized "to solicit student support,"
not to promote free exchange among students who think for themselves.
3. To miscall "freedom of speech" a reason for pushing organized
political groups is to invite those whose intention it is to cause emotional
confusion and its resultant mental impotence, both of which could easily
lead to our complete loss of "freedom of speech."
4. As soon as political (action) groups organize, the student body would
become one big hell of opposing factions. Let's not kid ourselves that
partisan groups will politely get together for discussion just because
this is a university.
5. As a melting-point for opinions. Stanford may benefit greatly by fre
quent, regular, open, widely-publicized and capably-directed "free ex
changes of political opinion" from all partisan sides. The result: intelligent
acceptance or rejection of political programs, men, and policies, not the
otherwise hasty, emotional, often embittering attachment to plans that
too ofton turn up in broad daylight to be much more than is meant to
meet the eye.
And so on. In this election we must te awake as never before. Poli
ticians and campaign managers may spread a rosy glow over the
"Partisan Politics on Campus" issue. But let's think for ourselves. In a
free exchange everyone has something to say. In an organized political
group the guv in the national office does the talking.
THINK FIRST: THEN VOTE WISELY.
