## HISTORY 1948

Concerning the all-important national armament
question, two schools of thought are today dividing
U. S. public opinion.
The first of these two, supported by such states
men as President Truman, Secretary Marshall, James

Forrestal, and former General Ei
senhower, emphasizes the need for
preparedness and the protection of
world peace and offers, by way of
solution, a draft program supple
mented by Universal Military
Training.
Proponents of this school point
to a recent Gallup poll stating that
"65 per cent of the American peo
ple favor UMT."
The second of the two ideas, sup
ported in essence by opposites Taft
and Wallace, a majority of the

churches, the National Council against Conscription,
and others, also makes use of the common term
'"peace," yet brands the UMT proposal "militaristic,"
"too expensive," "worthless in value," and even
"fascistic" (in the case of Henry Wallace).
President Truman in his speech last month re
quested passage of a limited draft act to raise out
peacetime force to the "protective" level, and a UMT
program which would insure, he said, a large poten
tial force in the event of aggression.
It has been predicted that Congress, now consider
ing the President's proposition, will not come to any
definite legal action until after the coming elections.
This would mean a possible delay of 10 or 12 months.
However, many sources say that either a calamity
in Europe (i.e., a possible communist victory in the
coming Italian elections), or excessive pressure of
public opinion, may precipitate immediate congres
sional action.
In any event, when showdown time comes blasting
around the corners of congressional cloak-room doors,
a bitter struggle will ensue between those to whom
all-out armament is the only answer and those
who want either none of it or a modified version of it.
Thus, in view of the gravity of the suitation and

also of its importance to young men of UMT and draft
ages. The Daily has commissioned two of its reporters
to circulate among the frosh and jot down some of
the more characteristic opinions based on the gen
eral question: "Is the armed or unarmed way the
way to peace?" Their opinions follow:
Jay Hughes, Encina president, stated: "The only
solution for world peace is world disarmament, not
just American disarmament. However, if others in
sist on remaining strong, we (should) keep pace."
Dave Allen, air force veteran, thought that "armed
power seems to be the only language that aggressor
nations have ever been able to understand. I think
there should be UMT for 18 and 19 year olds and draft
for those older."
Phil Xielson. ROTC student, took an unarmed
stand. "An armed policy," he stated, "only admits
a nation's diplomatic failure. The UN should be the
only military force . .
Ken Gardner, frosh basketball player, believes in
UMT "so that we can have something to get tough
with if another country requires that." Selective
service, he said, is definitely not the thing to impose
on a student.
Concluding that the frosh men were well split on
the issue, we turned to the women.
Mary Macaulay, Roble president, thought an un
armed policy would be best, but that "if we put on
a bluff and are called, I feel we should carry it
through."
Both Betty Fish and Marianna Wieder, Roble. be
lieve that we should go towards peace armed for
our own protection.
Calling herself an optimist. Janet Edwards. Bran
ner, thought "you can (not) work towards peace
in an armed condition ... it would be much better
to try cooperating again. . . ."
Probably the most surprising opinion found was
that of Bob Munn, legal student. Munn said, "The
United States has got to go out and conquer the
world, preaching democracy to all nations. After
. . . they realize the advantages which democracy
can offer them . . . we should . . . lower ourselves
to an equal status with (them)."
