Investigations have definitely established the fact
that most fires occurring on campus are caused by
careless smoking. If smokers were on guard at all
times, there would be almost no cause for fires at
Stanford.
The Farm is fortunate to be free from an important

•ause of fires—the location ««of
large kitchens or furnaces in build
ngs. Our central heating plant is
located away from the center of
.he campus and University kitch
2ns are either outside the buildings
Ihey serve, as in Encina, or in
a separate section, as in Roble.
At present 22 fire boxes, extend
ing as far as the Sigma Nu house,
112 serve the main sections of the
I campus. These boxes are incor-
Dorated in a game-well type sys-

tem which constitutes a circuit extending from the
fire house, around the campus, and back to the fire
house again. Fire boxes may be placed at any
point on the circuit and a limited number of
additions can be made. It is true that the outlying
districts are not yet served by the alarm system,
but plans have already been made for, and some pre
liminary work done, on its extension. Conduit for
the system is now being laid in the Farm's new
underground electrical development. The estimated

total cost of this long range plan is $GO.OCO.
Those who lack access to a fire alarm should call
Palo Alto 5111 in case of fire. This number is
reserved for incoming emergency calls only.
Regulations prohibiting use of inflammable liquid.-
and heavy electrical devices in University residences
provide further protection for Stanford. The burning
of rubbish on campus is also maintained by Uni
versity regulations and may be done only on certain
days at appointed hours. State law requires that all
decorations for dances and similar affairs be inspected
and approved as being flame-proof by the local fire
department. On past occasions it has been necessary
to remove decorations because of failure to check
with the department.
The Stanford fire department, which is maintained
entirely by the University, is staffed by Chief John
J. Marston, 6 full time and 13 student firemen. The
chief's car and one of the fire trucks are equipped
with two-way radios. Consequently in an emergency
Stanford can contact local fire departments im
mediately and call into action the mutual aid agree
ment that the university maintain? with fire com
panies in surrounding areas.
Probably the greatest protection for the Farm lies
in the students themselves. All our modern equip
ment, adequate construction of buildings, and numer
ous safety devices would profit us nothing if the
students were apathetic.

decorations for dances and similar affairs be inspected
and approved as being flame-proof by the local fire
department. On past occasions it has been necessary
to remove decorations because of failure to check
with the department.
The Stanford fire department, which is maintained
entirely by the University, is staffed by Chief John
J. Marston, 6 full time and 13 student firemen. The
chief's car and one of the fire trucks are equipped
with two-way radios. Consequently in an emergency
Stanford can contact local fire departments im
mediately and call into action the mutual aid agree
ment that the university maintain? with fire com
panies in surrounding areas.
Probably the greatest protection for the Farm lies
in the students themselves. All our modern equip
ment, adequate construction of buildings, and numer
ous safety devices would profit us nothing if the
students were apathetic.

Investigations have definitely established the fact
that most fires occurring on campus are caused by
careless smoking. If smokers were on guard at all
times, there would be almost no cause for fires at
Stanford.
The Farm is fortunate to be free from an important

•ause of fires—the location ««of
large kitchens or furnaces in build
ngs. Our central heating plant is
located away from the center of
.he campus and University kitch
2ns are either outside the buildings
Ihey serve, as in Encina, or in
a separate section, as in Roble.
At present 22 fire boxes, extend
ing as far as the Sigma Nu house,
112 serve the main sections of the
I campus. These boxes are incor-
Dorated in a game-well type sys-

tem which constitutes a circuit extending from the
fire house, around the campus, and back to the fire
house again. Fire boxes may be placed at any
point on the circuit and a limited number of
additions can be made. It is true that the outlying
districts are not yet served by the alarm system,
but plans have already been made for, and some pre
liminary work done, on its extension. Conduit for
the system is now being laid in the Farm's new
underground electrical development. The estimated

total cost of this long range plan is $GO.OCO.
Those who lack access to a fire alarm should call
Palo Alto 5111 in case of fire. This number is
reserved for incoming emergency calls only.
Regulations prohibiting use of inflammable liquid.-
and heavy electrical devices in University residences
provide further protection for Stanford. The burning
of rubbish on campus is also maintained by Uni
versity regulations and may be done only on certain
days at appointed hours. State law requires that all
decorations for dances and similar affairs be inspected
and approved as being flame-proof by the local fire
department. On past occasions it has been necessary
to remove decorations because of failure to check
