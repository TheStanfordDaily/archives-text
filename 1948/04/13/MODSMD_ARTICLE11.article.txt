### 
WASHINGTON, April 12 (UP) —House Republican leaders agreed to
give top priority to military money bills today and Defense Secretary
James Forrestal disclosed that Russia now has the secret of the atom
bomb but still is unable to make one.
Forrestal told the House Armed Forces Committee that, although the
Russians have learned the know-how of bomb-making, they have no
atomic weapons at present because Soviet industry is not up to the job
<>! making them.

Discounting talk of a war "crisis," he predicted peace if the United
States takes responsible preparedness measures to discourage aggressors.
The House Republican Steering Committee held a strategy session
shortly after Forrestal's testimony. Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr., (R.,
Mass.) said the GOP leaders agreed that all big appropriations bills
except that required by the budget should be shelved until military
needs are met.
"Military spending is paramount to insure a strong national defense,"
Martin said. "For that reason we have got to give it priority. After *that
we'll see what the financial picture is before we act on the other bills
that require big appropriations."
