## 
### BY TOM SHAWVER 
Practically qualified to move into the ranks of Farm traditions
:.s Stanford's popular Tuesday Evening Series, 57 years old this
year.
Each Tuesday evening at 7:30 an average audience of 750
persons gathers in Memorial Auditorium for the series lectures.

What they hear or see there may
range from a larned speech by an
Oxford professor to impressions of
a woman air traveler who in 11)40
:iad flown over 110,000 miles on
commercial air lines.
The Series was established by
Stanford's Dr. David Starr Jordan
n the autumn of 1891 as a means of
acquainting faculty, students, and
citizens of Palo Adto with interesting
•.spects of scholarly investigations
nd the work of outstanding person
alities. The University, it was de
cided, would pay for the lectures
and the public would be admitted
free.

Now under the administration of
the Committee on Public Exercises,
Series speakers are chosen by a
committee of five headed by an an
nually elected chairman. Dr. Hu
bert Heffner of the speech and dra
ma department is the present head
of the committee.
Tn their selection of programs,
committee members attempt to
make the lectures as interesting as
possible without sacrificing the
scholarly aspect on which they were
founded.
Recommendations for speakers in
the Series come from a number of
sources, according to Mrs. W. Carl
Brune. secretary of the Committee
on Public Exercises.

"Besides regular circulars from
lecture agencies, wc also receive a
number of suggestions from faculty
members and students," she said.

"Each department is also asked to
keep on the alert for good speakers
and artists in its own field."
Last year nearly 30.000 persons
attended Series lectures, and there
is good reason to believe that there
may be an even larger total this
year. Figures like these arc proof
that Stanford's idea of giving some
thing worth while to the commu
nity in which it is located has
turned out to be a good one.
