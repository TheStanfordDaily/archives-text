# Chappie Pledges Carrying Sledges
## 
### 
Have you noticed several roughs i
carrying sledgehammers around the j
campus of late?
There is no reason to hope that i
hey form a wrecking crew to knock ;
down the part of the Quad that !
houses the department of Romanic
languages. They are only pledges j
of Hammer and Coflin, the honorary |
society of Chaparral—"the campus I
humor magazine."
All Hammer and Coflin pledges j
are required to carry the sledge- J
hammer for one week. The last day
for carrying hammers will be Fri
day.
Stanford students being initiated
this quarter are:
Steve Rothman, Stan Norton, I
Dick Deßoy, Bob Hudson, John j
Motheral, Jerry Pruett, Geoff Relf, j
Art Herzog, John Murray, and Will
Mead.
II the pledges lose or have their j
hammers stolen during the period of j
initiation they are subject to various j
forms of punishment by the mem
bers.
The sledgehammer is officially
recognized by the ASSU as the !
pledge pin of Hammer and Coffin.
Formal initiation will be held Fri
day night in San Francisco.
