To the Editor:
Just a few comments on Friday's excellent editorial entitled "Education
'or What?" Yes, for what? It's a tragic situation when live interest in
extra-curricular activities takes a nose-dive as it has done at Stanford
since the end of World War 11.
I believe it perfectly in order to blame for this situation two groups:
students and faculty. A good majority of the students at Stanford are not
concerned one iota with anything but grades—as if grades alone were all
that mattered when earning a living in today's world of hard knocks.
Look at most of those persons around you in your classes, etc. They're
not interested in what you learned in a course—just what grade you
made. That's all that counts. A good grade is their God. And how they
do worship that God!
As for professors, I don't see how some of them can sleep at night alter
dishing out some of their assignments (as if that were all we had to do).
It surely takes plenty of gall after the relatively easy times a good portion
of them had in their college days—days when college was a pleasure, not
routine drudgery as is the order of the day at Stanford.
Yes. I'd enjoy very much to be in more activities than I am at present,
but it is utterly impossible due to the gruelling pace set by grade-mad
"scholars" and work-mad professors.
