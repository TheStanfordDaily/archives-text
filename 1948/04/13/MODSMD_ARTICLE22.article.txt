# Thanks, George

To the Editor:
We wish to thank George Riunn & Co.. the PCA. Students for Wallace,
and the other campus malcontents for giving us the truth about our
foreign policy in The Daily.
Enlightened, we now see that Wall Street imperialists caused the war,
and are provoking the present world crisis against the oppressed agrarian
reformers of Eastern Europe; that our State Department is the tool oÂ£
evil corporations; and that we are forcing the countries of Western
Europe to take our dollars, and binding them into imperialist economic
slavery.
