						Memorial to Gandhi—Anglo-Russ Talks
## 
### 
To the Editor:
H. N. Brailsford of England suggested that as a memorial to Gandhi,
Anglo-Russian talks be held "to discover ways of easing the tension
between us." "If Pandit Nehru would consent to act as host it might
begin with an informal talk at Delhi between spokesmen of the two
governments, preferably men who have not been involved in their public
quarrels."
Vera Britain, British author, writes in the London "Peace News," of
Feb. 6, "This is one of the first constructive proposals to lighten the
deepening gloom of Anglo-Russian relations." She thinks representatives
of the United States should also be included.
Sponsored by Nehru, whose "relations with Russia are good," she
suggests as participants the names of several people widely known and
respected in all of the countries involved, such as Nehru's sister, Mrs.
Pandit, now Indian ambassador to Russia; J. B. Priestley and Maude
Royden of England; and Dorothy Thompson of America.
Many tributes wore paid to Gandhi upon his death. Throughout the
world statesmen and leaders, even those who had formerly been bitter
in denunciation and ridicule, paused to pay homage to the little man
whose life was a triumphant demonstration of the power of "Soul Force."
Let us make our tribute more than word service. Before we turn
America into an armed camp, let us endeavor to find a way toward
peace in the spirit of Gandhi.
