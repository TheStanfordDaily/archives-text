## In the Words of George Marshall 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP) —Here are the words with
which Secretary of Stale George C. Marshall first de
scribed the "Marshall Plan":
. .The United States should do whatever it is able
to do to assist in the return of normal economic
health in the world, without which there can be no
potential stability and no assured peace.
"Our policy is directed not against any country
or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, despera
tion, and chaos.
''Its purpose should be the revival of a working
economy in the world so as to permit the emergence
of political and social conditions in which free insti
tutions can exist.
"Such assistance . . . must not be on a piecemeal
basis as various crises develop.
"Any assistance thai this government may render
in the future should provide a cure rather than a
mere palliative.
'"Any government that is willing to assist in the
task of recovery will find full cooperation, I am sure,
on the part of the United States government.
"Any government which maneuvers to block the
recovery of other countries cannot expect help from
us . . . (they can expect) the opposition of the U. S.
"...There must be some agreements among the
countries of Europe as to the requirements of the
situation and the part those countries themselves
will take. . . .
"This is the business of Europeans. The initiative
must come from Europe.
"The role of this country should consist of friendly
aid in drafting of a European program and of later
support of such a prognyn as it may be practical
for us to do so.
"The program should be a joint one. agreed to by a
number, if not all European nations."
