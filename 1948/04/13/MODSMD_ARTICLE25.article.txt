# ERP a Peace-Time Lend-Lease

(This is (he fourth in a series on the Marshall
Plan. This dispatch tells some of the details of the
plan and how it will work.—Ed.)
WASHINGTON (UP) —The European Recovery
Program (ERP) will be virtually a peace-time lend
lease project. As much as 80 per cent, maybe more,
of the United States aid will be in the form of
outright grants.
The program will be set up on a sliding scale under
which it is hoped that Europe will be able to take
almost complete care of herself when the program
as planned ends in the summer of 1952.
"It means to take Western Europe completely ofT
the American dole at the end of the adventure,"
Senate President Arthur 11. Vandenberg (R.. Mich.)
said when presenting the plan to the Senate.
ERP will be for a years duration—to run from
April 1, 1948, through June 30. 1952. The Truman
administration, before Congress acted, estimated the
first 15 months needs at $6,800,000,000.
The total program now is estimated at about $17,-
000.000.000, but may be more if inflation continues.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall was ada
mant that the project not be cut. Time and again
he told Congress and the country that it would be
better not to start the program at all if it is to be
done on an inadequate hasis.
None of the money will be turned over to recipient
countries as money. They will receive the help
mostly in the form of commodities and supplies.
An elaborate organization will be set up in this
country to direct ERP. The most important figure
will be the administrator—an American. He will be
the boss and responsible directly to the President.
Although he will work intimately with Marshall on

foreign policy matters, it will be arranged that the
President will "umpire" any disputes.
'Ilie administrator also will have a "roving am
bassador" in Europe to be his representative with
the recipient countries and to any continuing or
ganization the Europeans set up to run the program.
None of the money will be earmarked in advance
for specific countries. But rough estimates of what
various countries will need and can expect have
been made.

said when presenting the plan to the Senate.
ERP will be for a years duration—to run from
April 1, 1948, through June 30. 1952. The Truman
administration, before Congress acted, estimated the
first 15 months needs at $6,800,000,000.
The total program now is estimated at about $17,-
000.000.000, but may be more if inflation continues.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall was ada
mant that the project not be cut. Time and again
he told Congress and the country that it would be
better not to start the program at all if it is to be
done on an inadequate hasis.
None of the money will be turned over to recipient
countries as money. They will receive the help
mostly in the form of commodities and supplies.
An elaborate organization will be set up in this
country to direct ERP. The most important figure
will be the administrator—an American. He will be
the boss and responsible directly to the President.
Although he will work intimately with Marshall on

foreign policy matters, it will be arranged that the
President will "umpire" any disputes.
'Ilie administrator also will have a "roving am
bassador" in Europe to be his representative with
the recipient countries and to any continuing or
ganization the Europeans set up to run the program.
None of the money will be earmarked in advance
for specific countries. But rough estimates of what
various countries will need and can expect have
been made.
