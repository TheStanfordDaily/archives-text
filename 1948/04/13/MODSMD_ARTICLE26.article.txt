## History 1948 
### 
After the "most unpredictable atom bomb ever
created" raked Termiti island there was nothing left
—nothing but 17 billion turnip termites! Yet high
overhead, the pilot breathed confidently, "Thank
heavens there's nothing alive on that island."
A 1 Capp speaks a lot of comic-strip sense in his
Lil Abner. For the "bomb" dropped on Termiti
was a vitamin bomb—instead of destroying, it nour
ished. In a way, that s exactly what we're doing in
our communist witch-hunt. We're vitaminizing
communism, and forcing liberal democracy under
ground.
The greatest danger in America today is not the
communists, whose actual numbers are unimportant.
What is important is the increasing throttling of
American liberalism. What with the dogmatic Tenney
and Thomas committees, and the indiscriminate
slinging of "communist," we've embarked on a cam
paign of hit-or-miss libel.
Where this libel stops depends on the American
pepole. Scare headlines and the growing feeling that
war is inevitable are band-wagoning millions of
Americans behind the banners of the narrow
thinkers, behind groups and men who in their own
right are as dogmatic as the most flagrant communist.
It is fear that has stampeded freedom of speech
before the winds of intolerance? Is it fear that libeled
the atomic researcher, Dr. Condon? What is this
fear that has come over us?
Perhaps it is the realization that democracy has
lost its dynamic place in world thinking to commu
nism. We are in a decade where two vital ideas
are fighting for world supremacy—the most dynamic
will win. If democracy has lost some of it vitality,
it's about time we do some revaluation, and rescue
it from cold-storage mumble-jumblism, and place it
once again on the same dynamic footing with its
competitor. Our strongest weapon—the idea of de
mocracy—needs an ideological whetstoning. We must
take the world by propaganda—by democratic propa
ganda. Democracy must desert the debaters' platform
and come to live with the people. Dynamicism must
start at home—in the hearts, " minds, actions of
America. It's about time we learned as much about
our constitution of 178!) as the communists know
about theirs of 1936.
It is not the time for witch-hunting—for the libel
ing of our eitzenry under guise of congressional fact
finding. It is time, instead, for stock-taking at home.
How to make democracy live? How to adrenal ize
it with dynamitism? Individualism is the key. Give
a man an idea he can love—give him democracy as a
consuming theocracy; make the Constitution his
testament, the Bill of Rights his scripture. Send him
out as democracy's minister—let him win converts
around the world. Let him write convincingly to
his friends in Europe; let him convert the demagogue
sitting next to him in a bar; let him soap-box for
democracy on the street corner.
Make democracy at atomic idea; give it collectivism
—the collectivism of individuals possessed with a
single idea—to beat at the walls of dogmatism, intol
erance and do-nothingness. Let's fight fire with a
bigger fire—-but let's keep our senses and our liberal
ism. Our fight now is as much to keep our liberals
above ground as to keep misguided passions below.

it with dynamitism? Individualism is the key. Give
a man an idea he can love—give him democracy as a
consuming theocracy; make the Constitution his
testament, the Bill of Rights his scripture. Send him
out as democracy's minister—let him win converts
around the world. Let him write convincingly to
his friends in Europe; let him convert the demagogue
sitting next to him in a bar; let him soap-box for
democracy on the street corner.
Make democracy at atomic idea; give it collectivism
—the collectivism of individuals possessed with a
single idea—to beat at the walls of dogmatism, intol
erance and do-nothingness. Let's fight fire with a
bigger fire—-but let's keep our senses and our liberal
ism. Our fight now is as much to keep our liberals
above ground as to keep misguided passions below.
After the "most unpredictable atom bomb ever
created" raked Termiti island there was nothing left
—nothing but 17 billion turnip termites! Yet high
overhead, the pilot breathed confidently, "Thank
heavens there's nothing alive on that island."
A 1 Capp speaks a lot of comic-strip sense in his
Lil Abner. For the "bomb" dropped on Termiti
was a vitamin bomb—instead of destroying, it nour
ished. In a way, that s exactly what we're doing in
our communist witch-hunt. We're vitaminizing
communism, and forcing liberal democracy under
ground.
The greatest danger in America today is not the
communists, whose actual numbers are unimportant.
What is important is the increasing throttling of
American liberalism. What with the dogmatic Tenney
and Thomas committees, and the indiscriminate
slinging of "communist," we've embarked on a cam
paign of hit-or-miss libel.
Where this libel stops depends on the American
pepole. Scare headlines and the growing feeling that
war is inevitable are band-wagoning millions of
Americans behind the banners of the narrow
thinkers, behind groups and men who in their own
right are as dogmatic as the most flagrant communist.
It is fear that has stampeded freedom of speech
before the winds of intolerance? Is it fear that libeled
the atomic researcher, Dr. Condon? What is this
fear that has come over us?
Perhaps it is the realization that democracy has
lost its dynamic place in world thinking to commu
nism. We are in a decade where two vital ideas
are fighting for world supremacy—the most dynamic
will win. If democracy has lost some of it vitality,
it's about time we do some revaluation, and rescue
it from cold-storage mumble-jumblism, and place it
once again on the same dynamic footing with its
competitor. Our strongest weapon—the idea of de
mocracy—needs an ideological whetstoning. We must
take the world by propaganda—by democratic propa
ganda. Democracy must desert the debaters' platform
and come to live with the people. Dynamicism must
start at home—in the hearts, " minds, actions of
America. It's about time we learned as much about
our constitution of 178!) as the communists know
about theirs of 1936.
It is not the time for witch-hunting—for the libel
ing of our eitzenry under guise of congressional fact
finding. It is time, instead, for stock-taking at home.
How to make democracy live? How to adrenal ize
it with dynamitism? Individualism is the key. Give
a man an idea he can love—give him democracy as a
consuming theocracy; make the Constitution his
testament, the Bill of Rights his scripture. Send him
