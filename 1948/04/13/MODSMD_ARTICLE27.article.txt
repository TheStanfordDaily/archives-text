Someone has done it at last. Made a survey of
the humor on the men's room walls.
The March issue of Campus magazine has uncov
ered the fact that latrine levity is most original
and sparkling in the Medical, English, and Drama
Departments.

The writings on the walls of the
Commerce department, says Cam
pus, are sometimes clever but sel
dom inspired.
Washroom wit reaches a low in
the Physical Education Depart
ment.

Last week some Navajo Indians
discovered uranium on their prop
erty.
There is something undemo
cratic about the discovery, and it's

10-to-l we will take the atom bomb ingredient away
from them. We always have before.

Financial Notes: John Pool, Daily biz manager,
and Loren "ABC Smith, campus big-wig, own part
of an oil well in Pennsylvania.
They in turn have sold part of their ownership
to some Encina hashers.
This is what Russia is hollering about when they
condemn the U.S.A. as a country where even the
peasants own oil wells. Feellhy Encina Kopitalists!

Campus coeds no longer check bawlout averages
or social standing in the selection of their next boy
friend. Popular criterion for selection is:
"I've looked you up in the Kinsey report, and
you're the man for me."

The average weekly increase for labor in the past
35 years has been $52.
At the same time the death rate has declined so
that now one can expect to live to be 65 instead of
merely 52.
In other words, people are refusing to die, and have
got more money to fight the movement. In terms of
an old saying, the philosophy is now:
If you can't take it with you, don't go.
As soon as they develop methods of sending it on
ahead money-mad civilization will have reached an
apex.

Herb Caen, Chronicle's columnist de luxe, reports
that Hank Luisetti, Stanford basketball great, has
car license number 77H777. Luisetti's basketball
number at Stanford was, of course, number 7.
The whole thing is unimportant, but it shows you
the kind of facts columnists will turn up if not given
a steady, decent job.

Senator Hickenlooper (R., Iowa) not so long ago
advocated "immediate use of the atom bomb to
shorten any future war and thus save lives."
May I suggest that the Senator get together with
"Hybrid Henry" Wallace, also from lowa way. Some
place between the two opinions lies the right answer.

KSU has a new radio show. 10:30 Wednesday night
starring Ed Reissen and Di Powers called "Rough and
Ready."
The show is the funniest thing since the invention
of the collapsible chair and the exploding cigar.
The fact that I help write the show has nothing—-
absolutely nothing—to do with my opinion.
