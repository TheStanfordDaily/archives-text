# Seals Still Lead PCL; Oaks Trail By 2 Games
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The inevitable happened last
week. The Seals lost a game; in fact
they lost three. Having extended
their winning streak to six straight,
the O'Doulmen started playing like
bums and dropped two in a row to
Hollywood. However, SF salvaged
the series and their league leader
yfnip by splitting the Sunday twin
bill.
O'DOUL WAS IMPRESSED by
the showing of his two "kid" pitch
ers. Con Dempsy and Bob Drilling.
Dempsey received credit for his first
victory in the PCL Thursday night
when he held the Stars in check for
four innings after replacing Ken
Gables on the mound, while Drilling
hurled three scoreless innings in a
relief job on Saturday.
San Francisco returns to Seals
Stadium tonight where they open a
seven - game series with the San
Diego Padres.
THE OAKS had a little trouble
with Los Angeles last week as they
made it obvious that the club needs
pitching help. Will Hafey has failed
to show the form which made him
look unbeatable in spring exhibition
games, and the rest of the staff has
been inconsistent.
Earl Jones and Damon Hayes are
the only ones who turned in credit
able mound performances last week
while the Angels were winning four
out of seven from the Acorns. Mick
ey Burnett, ex - Oak, returned to
haunt his ormer teammates as he
led the LA batting parade.
BROOKS HOLDER spoiled "Red"
Lynn's bid for a no-hitter Tuesday
night; Holder's sixth-inning double
was the only hit allowed by the
Angel chucker.
Sacramento finally started win
ning. The Sacs snapped a four-game
losing streak, and then won five
.straight from hapless Seattle which
buries the Suds deep in the base
ment.
In San Diego the Padres edged
Portland four games to three. Lack
of clutch hitting spelled defeat for
the Beavers as three of their losses
were by a one-run margin.
TONIGHT MARKS the home
opening for four clubs as the Seals.

Beavers, Rainiers, and Angels re
turn to familiar grounds after two
weeks on the road.
This week's series are as follows:
Sacramento at Los Angeles, Holly
wood at Portland, Oaks at Seattle,
and San Diego at San Francisco.
BRIEFS: The Seals acquired two
right-handed hitting outfielders last
week. Ben Guintini, who played
with the O'Doulmen in '44, was pur
chased from Indianapolis, and Felix
Mackiewicz was purchased from the
Giants. To make room for these
men, pitcher Frank Rosso and Sal
Taormina were released outright.
The Oaks signed "Frenchy" Uhalt,
ex - Seal, to bolster the outfield,
which was weakened by the tem
porary loss of Les Scarsella.
San Diego purchased outfielder
Buster Adams from the Philadel
phia Phils. Adams is an ex-Coast
Leaguer who went up to the majors
from Sacramento in 1940.
