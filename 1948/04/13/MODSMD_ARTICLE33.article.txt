The crude efforts of a group of
callow, inexperienced freshmen re
sulted in the publication of an er
roneous report in yesterday's frosh
edition, evidently because of false
information supplied by an upper- ,
classman.
According to the report, Ainslie .
Bell had signed a professional foot- |
ball contract. This is not true. We I
of the Daily sports staff apologize
for this obvious mistake and lack of 1
discernment.
Frosh will be frosh.
