## GRIDDERS Spring Drills Stress Passes 
### 
With the advent of real spring
I weather, spring football at Stanford
! went into its fourth day yesterday
I with passing offense and defense
1 highlighting the drill.
Head coach Marchie Schwartz was
the first of the 1948 edition of the
Farm grid machine to feel the effects
of a mishap the like of which
i plagued the 1947 outfiit. In this case
I it was but a touch of stomach flu
| and the top man was on hand for
the practice session.
| The drills ran alons the lines set
1 up in the first practice last week,
starting with calesthenics and end
i ing in wind sprints. Schwartz. Pete
' Kmetovic, Ray Hammett, and Mai
Edward worked with the backs and
ends on pass plays. The plan is to
I stress this type of play and defense
! for the first scrimage which will
come on Wednesday or Thursday.
If the weather holds good and the
i staff can cover the basic work in
time, the scrum will probably be
i Thursday. If not, the initial contact
will be held on Saturday morning,
weather permitting.
