# Farm AVC Meets Tonight at Village
## 
### 
The fate of Stanford's AVC chap
ter will be decided at a meeting to
be held in the Village auditorium
tonight at 7:30.
Members will decide the future
autonomy of the chapter. If it is the
opinion of a majority of the mem
bers that sufficient interest does not
exist at Stanford to maintain a vet
erans' organization, the group will
merge with the Palo Alto chapter.
