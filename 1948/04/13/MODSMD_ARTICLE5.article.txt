Arthur Koestler. author of the
best-sellers "Thieves in the Night"
and "Darkness at Noon," visited the
campus Sunday night as a guest of
Jeffery Smith, associate professor of
humanities.
Koestler talked with about 20 stu
dents and faculty members at
Smith's home in the Village, speak
ing "off the record" about the po
litical situation in France, the twists
of Soviet law, and creative writing.
The author was conducted on a
brief tour of the Stanford campus
and expressed interest in restric
tions imposed on students. About
the women's late leave regulations,
he commented, "That sounds liberal
enough."
A former Communist, Koestler is
now anti - totalitarian, being con
vinced that "There must be a Pax
Americana or no peace at all."
Analyzing the position of the
"confused liberals," whom he has
met in abundance since he arrived
here, Koestler said, "We must real
ize that the Soviet Union no longer
lies to the left but to the east."
The liberal today, he said, must
follow the razor edge path between
the dangers of Soviet as well as
Western reaction.
Commenting on Koestler's visit.
Wallace Stegner, professor of cre
ative writing, said, "Koestler is one
of the six men in the world I have
most wanted to meet."
