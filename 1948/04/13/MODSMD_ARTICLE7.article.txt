# Warren Lauds End of Dimout
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, April 12 (UP)—California's emergency hydro
electric power dimout was lifted today as late-season rainstorms
temporarily ended the drought danger in the nation's riches:
farm state.
Governor Earl Warren said tonight he was "gratified" by the

lifting of power restrictions in Cali
fornia but indicated daylight sav
ing would be continued, at least for
the time being.
WARNING NOTE
Warren said "a note of caution"
should be sounded for two reasons:
' First, because the present relax
ation of restrictions is dependent
upon the continuation of daylight
saving and the continued use ot
power from Southern California,
both of which are considered essen
tial by the Public Utilities Commis
sion.
'"Secondly, it is apparent that ever
if this were a reasonably wet year,
there is a serious question as tc
whether we would have sufficient
power to serve our increased popu
lation and to attract the new indus
tries that are essential for full em
ployment."
Under the law by which the 194S
Legislature set up daylight saving
it wi'l remain in effect until next
January unless terminated earlier
by Warren.
State Power Director Robert P.
O'Brien suspended drastic power
conservation measures in Northern
and Central California until June 1,
and restored full industrial and ag
ricultural use of water and elec
tricitv.
NEVADA FOLLOWS
Nevada Governor Vail Pittmar
quickly followed suit and relaxed
all controls in the western half of
his state, which is tied closely to
California power and water supplie>
by a network of giant power plants
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
O'Brien warned that the public
must continue voluntary electrical
savings, however.
O'Brien's sudden relaxation of
controls was brought about by al
most miraculous rains and snows
in the past four weeks—long after
the "normal" California rainy sea
son should have ended.


GOVERNOR EARL WARREN
sounded a note of caution yester
day when he commented on the
lift of the power restrictions. He
announced continuation of Day
light Saving Time.
