# Profs Discuss Rheumatism
## 
### 
Heat, rest, exercise, and massage
are the four major tools in the
treatment of rheumatism, three
members of the faculty of the Stan
ford Medical School pointed out in
a lecture in San Francisco last Fri
day night.
The three physicians, Drs. Roland
Davison, Donald King, and William
Northway, made these major points:
1. No one knows as yet what
causes rheumatism, so treatment
must be directed toward the relief
of symptoms.
2. Rest, which allays rheumatic
pain, has to be balanced with exer
cise, although improper use of ei
ther one of the two keeps the dis
ease active.
Dr. Northway urged that all
young people who have continued
backaches seek medical aid early.
This, he said, would lead to early
diagnosis of rheumatic cases and
would facilitate treatment.
In the lecture next Friday eve
ning at 8 at Lane Hall. Sacramento
and Webster Streets, San Francisco,
Dr. William M. M. Kirby will speak
on "Can Streptomycin Cure Tuber
culosis?" All lectures, conducted
under the auspices of the Stanford
Medical School, are open to the
public without charge.
