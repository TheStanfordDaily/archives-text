# Army, Atom Didn't Mix
## 
### 
The refusal of scientific personnel i
I to work under Army supervision
was the main reason for giving a
civilian commission control of atom- j
I
ic energy, said Dean Lawrence A. :
Kimpton on the Tuesday Evening i
J Series last night.
"You cannot persuade a scientist j
j to punch a timeclock," Dr. Kimpton
| said in explaining his statements.
I "Army regulations, chain of com
j mand procedures, and other forms
of military red tape exasperated
scientists working cn atom bomb
projects during the war and result
ed in unnecessary delay."
ARMY, CIVILIAN RIFT
Another rift in Army-civilian re
lations occurred when scientists dis
covered that their work was to be
used as a military weapon, Dr. i
Kimpton stated. For the Army,
j atomic energy is a weapon of war; I
; for scientists it is a new field of j
j research and a new incentive for |
| financial support of science.
Dean Kimpton. as administrative '
j head of the plutonium research j
I project carried on at the University
of Chicago from 194.1 to 1945, was
given the difficult task of maintain
ing harmony between the wto !
groups.
LACK OF PERSONNEL
Other big problems involved in
| production of the atom bomb were j
I a complete lack of personnel trained j
! for that type of work, the develop- j
ment of unknown materials, and the |
i maintenance of secrecy among the !
j several hundred thousand people
working on the project.
