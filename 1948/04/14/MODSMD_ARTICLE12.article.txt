# Colonel Hurls Kidnap Charge At Russians

BERLIN. April 13 (UP). —Col.
Frank L. Howley, American com
mandant in Berlin, charged today
that the Russians were kidnaping
persons from the American sector of
the city and taking them to the
Russian zone.
Howley read off a long list of
names of persons who, he said, had
disappeared over a period of several
months. He asserted that they had
been kidnaped.
The United States commandant
made his charge at an 11-hour
meeting of the four-power Kom
mandatura which controls Berlin.
RUSSIAN MAJ. GEN. Alexander
Kotikov started it by objecting to
the way in which the United States
used German police in its sector.
Especially he complained that the
police were being given radio cars.
"They are necessary to combat the
large number of kidnapings which
are invariably traced to the Soviet
zone," Howley replied.
Kotikov then said that the Ameri
can sector was being used as "an
asylum for bandits who make raids
on other sectors."
Kotikov threatened to break up
the four-power Public Safety Com
mittee under which the police oper
ate. He said the committee had
"lost its purpose."
RUSSIA'S PROPAGANDA chief
for Germany told a German mass
meeting Sunday that the Marshall
Plan means "Germany's division,
Europe's division—it means a war,"
it was disclosed today.
