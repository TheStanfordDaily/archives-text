### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP) —Spurred by an official warn
ing that Russia is outproducing the United States 12 to 1 in ai:
power, the House rushed a $2,376,100,000 aviation spending bill
through committee today and agreed to start debate on it im
mediately.
At the same time, the Senate Armed Services Committee took

► a step forward in its job of drafting
| a selective service law to meet the
manpower needs of the expanding
military forces. It voted unani
mously to require registration o;
men only through the 25-year-old
age group.
The House went into action on ail -
craft spending after Air Secretary
W. Stuart Symington asserted that
Russia is building the world's great
est air force in order to "reach a
j decision with this country."
He told the House Armed Forces
Committee the Russians are turning
j out 12 times as many combat planes
I as the United States.
Latest published American figures
J are about 1,500 planes a year, which
I would give the Soviet Union an
| annual output of 18,000 or more.
He agreed that the United States
is in the gravest peril of its history
and he said the Soviets seem to be
I aiming at a decision "in the air."
His testimony was given in sup
j port of a draft bill being considered
j by the committee, which wants tc
j put a 30-year-old ceiling on selective
service registrations. He said the
air forces will need 502,000 men by
j the end of 1950 to man the 70 air
j groups they are pointing for.
Admiral Louis E. Denfeld dis
j closed that the navy will concen
| trate on building up its air arm if
] the draft act is passed.
"We will be able to add 11 attack
| carrier groups, four anti-submarine
J warfare groups and six marine sup
port squadrons," he testified.
Even as Symington testified, the
i House Appropriations Committee
put its formal approval on the new
j air spending bill.
It approved the $2,376,100,000 as
an advance against the 1949 military
budget so that Defense Secretary
j James Forrestal can start placing
i contracts immediately for air force
i and navy planes, guided missiles
| and robot aircraft.
Forrestal plans to start spending
j the money within a month after
! Congress votes it in order to prevent
! a slowdown in the aircraft industry
that might cause a delay of as much
as six months in completing the
program.
