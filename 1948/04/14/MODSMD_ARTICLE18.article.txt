# Probation Policy Tightened Up
## 
### 
Students now attending Stanford
who have already been placed on
probation two or more times may be
suspended or disqualified at the end
of the current spring quarter if at
th; 11 time their total deficiency is
—11 or more.
Recently revised scholastic re
quirements have resulted in the is
suing of (he above statement by the
Committee on Scholarship.
Henceforth, students will be per
mitted no more than two quarters
on probation whether or not they
are consecutive, according to the
committee. Probation students are
those whose grade points are be
tween —11 and —20.
To facilitate improvement in
grades, students placed on proba
tion will no longer be eligible for
extra-curricular activities, in so far
as Scholarship Committee regula
tions are concerned. Each student,
however, will have the responsibil
ity of allocating his time in such a
way that he will meet the academic
standards of the University.
Only one suspension per student
will be permitted, the committee de
cided. Students who do not meet
the Scholarship Committee's condi
tions following readmission after
suspension will be subject to dis
qualification.
