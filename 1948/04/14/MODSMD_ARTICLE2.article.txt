### BOB COATE 
With talk of armament and war,
it's time the American people be
came a little more aware of their
responsibilities as citizens. We can
not expect friendship from people
who have been given so much false
propaganda they don't trust us.
We, as university students, can act
in accordance with our unique po
sition. No other group in the coun
try is in as good a position to pro
mote mutual understanding. No
other group can invite people of a
foreign nation to come and live with
them for a year.
FOURTEEN FROM EUROPE
There were over 200 foreign stu
dents at Stanford fall quarter. Only
14 of these were from Europe. The
State Department reports that there
is a desperate need for an increase
in foreign students in American col
leges. This year's total will be cut
almost in half by 1949.
The Foreign Scholarship Plan will
make it possible for Stanford to en
roll 10 European student leaders
who otherwise would have no
chance to see the United States.
These students will live with vis
for one year. The success of the
whole idea depends upon how much
we put out while they are here.
ADMINISTRATION HELPS
The administration will match up
to five scholarships from the ASSU.
We are being asked to budget $9,050
as a maximum for tuition, transpor
ter to gamble a small amount, rather
than 95.4 per cent of all available
funds plus all chance of other con
i structive use of the money?
THEORY HAS MERIT
The plan's theory has much merit;
I do not dispute this. However, my
obligation to endeavor to conduct
! ASSU affairs in a sound, business
, like manner prevents my endorse
! ment of so great an expenditure on a
J plan esentially speculative in nature.
Does any initial experiment merit
I 95.4 per cent of our resources?
I urge you to vote "no" now,
| pending a subsequent modification.
