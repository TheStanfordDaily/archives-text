To the Editor:
Re: Ralph Stevens' Tuesday letter commending the editorial which
criticized the lack of student interest in campus activities. Bravo for
his frankness.
Not to defend the students, but it seems that the inescapable truth
is that we are caught in an ever increasing upward spiral of grade
points which has been induced by "scholarship-happy" professors who
fail to recall the days when extra-curricular activities provided the most
valuable and enjoyable part of college life.
There are numerous organizations on campus that have an urgent
need for conscientious people willing to devote two or three hours per
week not only helping the organization but also helping the individual
to learn some practical task and to meet people with the same interests.
A survey of the various campus activities such as The Daily, Chappie,
KSU and NSA, reveals the startling fact that positions are either vacant
or are being filled by self-sacrificing volunteers who much necessarily
neglect their studies in order to keep the organization functioning
smoothly.
Where does the blame lie? Ask the professor who assigns work which
he knows cannot be accomplished in the time allotted by University
regulations. Also, ask yourself.
