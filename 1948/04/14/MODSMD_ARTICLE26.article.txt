# Brand Contradicts Brunn
## 
### 
To the Editor:
George Brunn, on Thursday, stated: "The evidence against Krupp is
full, clear, and uncontradicted." Does Brunn have information on this
subject not available to the court, or is he usurping the power of the
Almighty when he feels he can judge others by instinct? I am not
defending the court, because I do not know the circumstances, but I
object when Brunn tries to adjudge a man guilty simply on the ground
of "common knowledge." a typical Nazi trick. This country, in spite
of Brunn and his ilk, believes in sentencing a man only when proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As long as we keep this ideal, we
will not fall into the trap of letting hysteria instead of justice prevail,
even though it may mean letting a few guilty men go free.
