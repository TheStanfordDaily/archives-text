# Excom Violated Constitution
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I agree with Mr. Smith that Stanford needs a candidate who will "permit
the winds of freedom to blow."
I speak expressly of the violation of the ASSU Constitution by Excom in
their handling of the issue of political freedom.
The Constitution provides that where a petition for a by-law revision
is submitted, it shall be voted on favorably by Excom or shall be presented
to the student body as a referendum.
Ihe petition for revision of Excom's "partisan, political" decision was
rejected. Yet it has not been submitted to the students.
The conclusions seem obvious. Although Stanford has a student gov
ernment, it is only effective within certain limited spheres. When the
administration intervenes, even the machinery of student government
breaks down. The students are powerless to express themselves.
Yes. there is a need for a candidate who will bring student govern
ment back to the students.
