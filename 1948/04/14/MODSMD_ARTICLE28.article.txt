Soviet's All-out War oil ERP
WASHINGTON (UP)—The Marshall Plan, on
which the Soviets have declared all-out "war," is an
economic program for stopping communism.
Officially, American officials contend it is not
anti-communist; hut they admit that hy stabilizing
Europe's economy, it will eliminate the breeding
ground of all kinds of totalitarianism.
The State Department's official answer when asked
whether Europe will go communist if the Marshall
Plan is not adopted follows:
"If the European Recovery Program is not
adopted, there is no doubt that Europe will go
down hill economically, sinking farther and farther
into violence and anarchy. . . . The forces of the
extreme right and left have attempted to subvert
democratic governments in many countries of
Western Europe.
"With further economic deterioration in Europe,
there can be no doubt that in some countries the
Communist Party would be able quickly to gain
power while in others there would be bitter internal
strife and civil war before any force could control
the government. . . . Freedom and democracy as
we have traditionally known them would be wiped
from the continent of Europe."
Officially, the Russians consider the Marshall
Plan aimed directly at the Soviet Union. Their de
clared objective is to wreck it.
Bu( Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov prob
ably muffed his first and best chance to wreck it
when he walked out of the Paris Conference last
summer.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall had offered
the plan to all of Europe, including Russia, even
though he knew the chanccs of getting congres
sional approval of a plan in which Russia partici
pated was next to nothing. Molotov virtually as
sured congressional approval by turning thumbs
down on the project.
As soon as Britain and France decided to go ahead
and formulate a European aid program without
Russia, the Soviets started their answer:
1. The Czechoslovaks and the Poles were for
bidden to participate, even though they had de
cided earlier to do so.
2. The "Molotov Plan"—a series of trade agreements
and alliances among the Eastern Europeans and
with Russia—was started.
3. The Cominform—Communist Information Bu
reau—was created at a meeting of Communist Party
leaders from all European countries in Warsaw in
September, 1947. The Soviet ace trouble shooter,
Andrei A. Zhdanov, ran the show.
Those moves to consolidate Eastern Europe were
supplemented recently by the conversion of Czecho
slovakia into a completely communist state and by
pressure on Finland. But was Zhdanov's speech at
the Warsaw meeting of the Cominform and Molo
tov's statements before he walked out at Paris that
set the tone of the attack on the Marshall Plan.
"The Marshall Plan." Zhdanov said, "strikes at
the industrialization of (he democratic countries of
Europe, and hence at the foundations of their in
tegrity and independence . . . the nations of Eu
rope can foil this plan of enslavement. All that
is needed is (he determination and readiness of
(he peoples of Europe to resist. As to the USSR,
it will bend every effort in order that this plan be
doomed to failure. . . ."
After hearing Zhdanov, the Cominform passed a
declaration which said, in part:
