Who conducts the most elaborate tour of Stanford
University to new students? My choice for the
winning organization is the ASSU-managed sponsor
program in freshman halls.
Top responsibility for explaining the story of Stan
ford life to inquisitive freshmen rests in the hands

of a group of upper division men
and women who have distinguished
themselves on campus as leaders in
studies, student government, and
social life. The Farm functions for
and by student government, the
sponsors explain, and self-govern
ment begins in the freshmen halls.
Sponsors follow quite a credit
able philosophy at Encina Hall.
They believe that if top sponsor
material sets a good example for
•the frosh, successive freshmen will

be inspired to become University representatives in
their later years at school.
A progressive sponsor program, moreover, will cre
ate such a demand for the positions each year that the
sponsor-choosing committee will have no trouble in
picking top-flight men for Encina and the Village.
Though Encina sponsors carry- on their work in an
informal manner, they do come in daily contact with
every man in their assigned corridors. Through this
contact the frosh are instilled with two essentials of
student government—responsibility and leadership.
Stanford will give as much student government to the
students as they have responsibility to handle. If
student leadership lags, the administration must as
sume some of the responsibility.
During the autumn quarter the sponsors occupy
all Encina Hall offices. Dorm elections come in the
winter quarter, and the newly-elected freshman of
ficers work with the sponsors. The payoff comes in
the spring quarter when the freshmen take all hall
government out of the sponsors' hands and practice
what they have learned since autumn.
Next year Village sponsors may be installed in the
freshman area because resident administrators have
been too occupied with administrative work to devote
enough attention to the frosh. Village and Encina
sponsors would be an integrated organization, and
lieshman class activities between the two groups
would be coordinated to eliminate the Village's de
centralization.
This year's Village frosh had no sponsors because
of the tight budget the Village operates on to make
a profit. Four or five sponsors would drain too much
profit, for when Stanford vacates the Village, this
profit must be spent to tear down the housing. '
During the next few weeks a committee appointed
by Excom will interview prospective sponsors for
Encina and the Village. The committee will pick
students that have set top character records during
their schooling on the Farm, because the actions of
next year's sponsors will determine the character of
the class of '52.

Ihe Truman-Marshall Plan is only a constitu
ent pajt. (he Ruropcan subsection, of the general
plan for the policy of global expansion pursued
hy the United Slates in all parts of the world."
Molotov slammed the door at Paris with the warn
ing to Britain and France of "the consequences" if
they proceeded with the Marshall Plan without Rus
sia and Eastern Europe. He had denounced the
project as one of "interference" with the internal
affairs of European countries by the United States
and, therefore, "altogether unsatisfactory."
