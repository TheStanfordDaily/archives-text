## Bull Session 
### 
Now that spring is here again, the fellows on
campus are beginning to think of girls in terms other
than that of average raisers. Already I've heard a
couple of the old jokes that crop up every year at
this time, like spring is the season that men begin
to think about what women have been thinking about
all winter. But, just how hard spring fever has
hit the campus was brought home to me the other
day as I was standing in the chow line.
As I joined the chow line, a couple of days ago,
I saw one of my old buddies, whom I hadn't seen
since some time last quarter, standing ahead of me.
After the usual "long time no see" stuff was taken
care of, we started in talking. He didn't really have
to tell me that lie recently met the most terrific
little girl in the world, the one he's been waiting for
all his life. No, just one look at his face was enough
to tell me that. So, all the way through chow, and
for half an hour afterwards, he told me all about her.
For the record, I want to say that my buddy has
had it bad before, but never like this.
By this time in life I've sort of gotten used to the
idea that people in love will try to match-make their
friends. In fact, I've learned to take it in my stride.
So, by the time he finished telling me about his girl,
I half expected him to offer to fix me up with her
room mate. Therefore, I had my answer ready, by
which I could politely, but firmly, refuse. So, I was
caught off guard when he told me about the terrific
plan he figured out the other night. Before I go
any further, I want to make it clear that everybody
I know isn't like this. It's just this guy. Still, except
for these brain storms of his, he's essentially a swell
fellow.
This is the time of year that boys and girls start
dating again, he told me. (How he deduced that. I'll
never know.) What with a golden sun shining in
clear blue skies, soft, moonlight nights, how can

they resist? So, the boys will start trooping over to
Roble and the other places on nights, instead of
studying. The lobbies of the various halls will soon
be deserted nights.
He told me that one night as he sat in the Roble
lobby waiting for his girl, he looked at the lamps
that must have been shining brightly there for many
years. He thought of the countless nights they've
spread light and good cheer. And, he felt sorry for
them. Â£ or, now that spring was here once more,
the lobby would soon become deserted. The lamps,
like everybody else, enjoy good company. They'd
be lonesome in there, all by themselves.
And. this is his thought. Why don't the boys from
Encina and ihe other halls put a boy lamp from
the Encina lobby in the back seat of their car when
they go to call for their girl? Then, when they got
to Roble, or one of the other women's halls, they
could put one of Ihe girl lamps from the lobby in the
back seat, together with the boy lamp. Then." as they
sat in the front seat of the car, the lamps could get
together and do whatever it is that lamps like to
do under those circumstances.
Yow! In my time I've seen some of the queer
ways spring fever affects different guys. But,
never have I seen anything that even approximates
this.
Yes. the administration of this University ought
to get busy right away and figure, out just what
they rc going to do when spring quarter gets under
way. If things like this happen in the beginning,
I fear to think of what's going to happen when spring
fever really sets in!
Oh, yes, I almost forgot. My buddy says thnt
fellows who take lamps out of Roble to put in the
back seats of their cars should by all means return
the lamps before lockout-time. Because, he says,
it will be awfully dark in the lobby should the lamps
get a lockout.
