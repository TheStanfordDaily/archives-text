### 
Students for Democratic Action
| yesterday announced a Standard of
Political Freedom which they intend
to present to candidates for student
body offices for endorsement and to
the student body for discussion.
This standard, said Bill Miller,
i chairman of the group, clearly de
| fines the rights and obligations of
student organizations and is based
[ on the following principle:
"Students should be free to or
ganize political groups, to obtain
ASSU recognition for these
groups, and to advocate any opin
ion or action not contrary to law."
"SDA plans to request the Board
; of Trustees to reopen the question
of student political activity," Miller
declared. "We have no intention,
however, of using pressure tactics
1 directed at the board.
K* "Our campaign is to promote the
election of a student government.
"By electing candidates who sup
port the basic idea of political free
dom, we can also make it clear
that the concern for this freedom
is not confined to any one group
I representing some particular view
i point."
