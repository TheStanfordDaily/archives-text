# Martzloff Cites Drain 011 Funds
## 
### BY TOM MARTZLOFF 
Following the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's $9,050 proposal last
quarter, 170 students immediately
petitioned, demanding student body
approval of any expenditure for for
eign scholarships. The present bal
lot proposal offers no opportunity
for compromise; you must accept
or reject it in toto. However, if it
is rejected, the committee indicates
that a modified plan will be sub
mitted in time for the final ballot
April 28. The matter now rests in
your hands. For my part, I feel com
pelled to object strenuously to the
present proposal.
MITGUARD REVEALS
Mitguard, Student Manager for
over a year, reveals that the student
body expects this fiscal year an ex
cess of $12,985.31, which sum must
meet these definite obligations, total
ing $1,500:
1. Ray Lyman Wilbur Scholarship
Fund contribution.
2. J. Pierce . Mitchell Scholarship
Fund contribution.
Secondly, Mitguard recommends
as sound financial policy the with
holding of a minimum of $2,000 for
reserves and unforeseeable expenses.
This leaves 59.485.31 to cover all
further considered expenditures (e.
g., Tresidder Memorial contribution,
New Union Fund contribution. For
eign Scholarship proposal, various
other requests for ASSU funds).
FINANCIALLY SENSIBLE?
But the proposed $9,050 consumes
95.4 per cent of this sum. Finan
cially possible? Yes. Financially
sensible? I think not, considering
the experimental nature of the plan.
Any possible success hinges
largely on the complicated task of
choosing foreign student leaders.
Until a more specific selection
routine is proposed, the plan's ex
perimental aspects are even more
pronounced.
Foreseeing an argument that 10
students (maximum $9,050) are es
sential to any "impact" here or in
Europe, I contend the number at
Stanford to be a minor considera
tion, feeling that the real benefit
will be derived only if other uni
versities should follow our lead, It
seems reasonable that success with
five as well as 10 or 15 students
would serve with equal effectiveness
to encourage other universities.
Consequently, would it not be bet
tation, and incidentals. Toyon and
the fraternities have offered to pro- |
vide board and room for as many (
as .12 students.
Nine thousand fifty dollars for |
8,000 students. This is about Si. 10
per student, already out of your j
pocket — probably less than the
amount of money spent by Stanford
students between the hours of 9 and
11 on Saturday night.
ASSU funds are handled by Ex
com, and Excom voted 11 to 2 to
budget this $9,050 for scholarships.
Since then, one of the two dissen- !
ters has changed his position. This
was a practically unanimous ap
proval by the group which has ac
cess to all the information on the
subiect.
The plan intends to earn more

; than local adoption. Other West
| Coast schools are waiting to hear
J the outcome of our referendum.
Through fraternities, MSA. and oth
|er facilities, nationwide coverage
j will be possible.
If a large number of schools in
the country adopt similar programs,
the students of the United States
will be a potent force for world
peace.
STUDENTS ASSUME LEAD
If we, as Stanford students, as
sume the lead in what could be a
< large - scale movement, we must
I show that we are actually trying
our best — not bringing over two
j students as a token.
Ten scholarships from 8.000 stu
dents is little enough, but it is
SOMETHING. And it's something
that it's possible to do together.

FINANCIALLY SENSIBLE?
But the proposed $9,050 consumes
95.4 per cent of this sum. Finan

Any possible success hinges

routine is proposed, the plan's ex

Foreseeing an argument that 10
students (maximum $9,050) are es
sential to any "impact" here or in
Europe, I contend the number at
Stanford to be a minor considera
tion, feeling that the real benefit
will be derived only if other uni
versities should follow our lead, It
seems reasonable that success with
five as well as 10 or 15 students
would serve with equal effectiveness
to encourage other universities.

Ten scholarships from 8.000 stu

Following the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's $9,050 proposal last
quarter, 170 students immediately
petitioned, demanding student body
approval of any expenditure for for

lot proposal offers no opportunity
for compromise; you must accept
or reject it in toto. However, if it
is rejected, the committee indicates
that a modified plan will be sub
mitted in time for the final ballot
