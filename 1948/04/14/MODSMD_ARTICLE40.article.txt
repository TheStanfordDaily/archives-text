# Tracksters Turn In Year's Best Times To Beat Highly Touted Spartans, 70-61
## Broad Jump Win Clinches Victory 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
Pacific Coast track teams had
better look out.
The Stanford varsity is on
the rampage. Not only did it
pull away from the highly
rated San Jose State Spartans, 70
to 61, at Stanford Stadium yesterday,
but also the Indians individually
set some of the best marks on the
coast so far this year.
HIE CARDS thoroughly avenged
last year's defeat by the Spartans.
Although the weather threatened at
the beginning of the meet, the small
amount of rain did not greatly affect
the condition of the track.
Probably the outstanding per
formance of the day was Card shot
putter Otis Chandler's tremendous
toss of 53 feet 2 inches. There was
no other competitor near him. By
way of comparison, Olympic Club's
Jim Delaney, considered the best
Pacific Coast shotputter, tossed the
iron ball 52 feet 10 inches against
California Monday.
FINALLY BREAKING his year
old meet jinx of 13 feet. Bill Larson
cleared 13 feet 10 inches in the pole
vault, and just missed 14 feet, when
his pole tipped the bar on the way
1 down.
Cards Downing McKee, Larry
Hoff, and George Grimes turned in
unazingly fast times on the track.
McKee flashed over the high hurdles
' in the rapid time of 14.5 seconds
with Darrell Kreitz, Skip Kent, and
Dell Russell of the Indians right
j behind him to sweep the event.
lIOFF, ace Card quarter-miler, set
! his usual rapid pace to win the event
in 48.5) seconds. He was mostly re
sponsible for wearing out Thelno
Knowles, the Spartans' top 880 man,
so that he could not run his best
event in good form.
Grimes ran a tremendous 1:56.9 in
' the half mile. A 1 Holubar of the
Indians pressed him all the way, and
•even passed him at the 660 mark.
However, Grimes' terrific kick,
which carried him to so many vic
tories last season, nipped Holubar
at the finish.
THE BEST all-around perform
ance of the meet was turned in by
Card Gay Bryan, as he led four
Indians to the tape in the low hur
( dies (23.8), garnered a 23'3" first
place in the broad jump, and leaped
6' 2" to grab a third in the high
jump.
In one of the best races of the
meet, Jose Rael. stocky Card two
i miler, lost a heart-breaker to Spar
l tans' double-winner Woody Haynes,
in the good time of 9:48.8. Rael led
j most of the way, but Haynes' sudden
1 and unexpected push in the last 220

yards nipped Rael at the tape. A 1
Lyons doubled up to take third
place after he had run second in
the mile.
THE RELAY TEAM V.ad a com
paratively easy time in beating the
San Jose entry. A 1 Wilkins, Pitch
Johnson, Larry Hoff, and anchor-lap
man George Grimes all ran very
creditable laps.
