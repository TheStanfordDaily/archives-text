# Mermen Face Olympic Club Here Saturday
## 
### BY BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's swimming varsity
will undergo its last serious test
before entering conference
competition when it faces the
San Francisco Olympic Club
team in a return meet Saturday
afternoon at the Eneina Pools.
Coach Tom Haynie's Farm pad
dlers will be out to tie one more
knot in their consecutive dual meet
win string which now stands at 27
straight victories.
WITH ONLY a meet with the
relatively weak College of the Pa
cific team left in their non-con
ference slate, the Indians are almost
a cinch to embark into their PCC
schedule with an unblemished rec
ord—if they can get by the Olympic
Club on Saturday. And that's a
mighty big '"if," too, for when at
full strength, the Winged-O squad is
wholly capable of upsetting the
high-flying Indians.
Keeping athletes in condition, and
getting them all out for the meets
are always the two top problems
that Olympic Club coaches have to
cope with.
THAT IS EXACTLY the plight
that faces Olympic Club swimming

coach George Schroth this year.
With such top names as Fred Taioli.
Al VVeeden, Em Cashin, Klas 801,
and Don Beanston on his roster,
Schroth has what is potentially the
best swimming squad in the West.
But when conflicting business or
study obligations keep some of his
top performers away from the meets
oi- the practice periods, Schroth has
little chance of fielding a champ
ionship team.
Yet. asunving that the Winged-0
team will be minus some of its top
talent for the Saturday meet, the
squad still has enough potential sec

ond and third-place winners to make
a close battle of it.
IN THE season's initial meet be
tween the two teams, held last month
in the Olympic Club pool, the In
dians took first place in all but two
events but only managed to win the
meet by 11 points—just because the
Olympic Clubbers took most of the
seconds and thirds.
If Coach Schroth can get all of
his top talent to the Encina Pools on
Saturday afternoon, the Indians
might well be beaten.
Quite an important "if."


HIE YVEEDEN BROTHERS, AE and JACK, renew their family back
stroke feud at the Enema Fouls Saturday afternoon when the Stanford
varsity engages the San Francisco Olympic Club in a non-conference
meet. Jack swims lor Stanford, while Al. a former Card swimmer, now
competes for the YVinged-O squad.
