# Gridders to Hold Scrimmage
## 
### 
Five days into the spring practice
j session, Stanford's gridders had a
| taste of contact work yesterday in
j preparation for today's scrimmage.
Head Coach Schwartz will line his
| men up in live teams this afternoon,
three on one shift and two on the
other. Teams one, two. and three
will alternate against each other
i while teams four and five scrum
; elsewhere.
Schwartz has issued an invitation
| to all Stanford students and faculty
to attend practices and scrimmages.
Yesterday the gridders ran
j through basic plays with contact
j work being used in the line but with
j orders to spare the backs.

The squad has been divided into
two sections with one section sub
divided into five teams. Varsity
players from last year's squad are
about evenly distributed so that the
teams are about equal in strength.
Saturday lTiorning's drill will be
used up tor the-most part in scrim
mage work.
