# Kindness Gives Pleasure To Village Kitchen Help

### JACK VARTY 
"I cannot think of. all the nice
words to say. But I thank you from
the bottom of my heart."
Those are the words of the thank
you note on the bulletin board in '
the kitchen of Stanford Village's '
cafeteria. They were written by the j
middleaged man in charge of the
dishwashing room. He had to go to \
the hospital and have all of his teeth 5
yanked to the tune of $300. So his ■
fellow employees, male and female,
each contributed some money to a
small pot, not so much to help him [
pay his bill as to let him know
that they were thinking of him.
This isn't the first time that a I
thank-you note has appeared on the
kitchen's bulletin board. It seems
that these low-paid employees who !
perform the smelly, disagreeable j
kitchen work will take a collection
for one of their number at the
slightest excuse. Sickness is one |
valid excuse. Death of a relative is
another. They even take a collec
tion whenever anvone leaves them

to take a job somewhere else. Some
times they give the money itself; at
other times they buy a present.
In Greece and China brother
fights brother. In Bogota they kill
hundreds to make up for the death
of one. In the USA the leaders de
liberate endlessly over whether to
help whom and how much. So it's
nice to know that somewhere peo
ple are happy just helping • each
other.
