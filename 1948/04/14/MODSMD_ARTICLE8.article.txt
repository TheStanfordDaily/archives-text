OMAHA, Neb., April 13 (UP).â€”Former Gov. Harold E. Stasser.
of Minnesota and Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York were wag
ing a close battle tonight for first place in the Nebraska free-for

THE TWO-MAN RACE between
the 41-year-old Stassen and the 46-
year-old Dewey began developing
with first returns from the eastern
section of the state, and continued
with reports from the central agri
cultural area and the western range
country. Each had spent severa
days last week campaigning the
state.
Senator Taft, backed by Sen. Hugh
I Butler, also campaigned the state
last week. But in early returns Taf"
was far behind the young men from
j Minnesota and New York.
A MAJORITY OF EARLY re
j turns were from predominantly ag
ricultural areas. Before the primary
j Stassen predicted he would win in
! a close race and said the farm vote
j would be the deciding factor. Dewey
j also predicted victory, but he did
j not stress farm support.
Dewey won the primary here in
1940 and Stassen won it in 1944. al
