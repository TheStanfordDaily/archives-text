# ICC Panel Emphasizes Critical Italian Election
## 
### 
"What Next in Italy?" was the topic chosen last night by the
International Conference Committee for their first of a series
of panels Wednesday evening. Led by Charles Delzell, curator
of Mediterranean studies of the Hoover Library, 12 students
took part in the current discussion.
Delzell, who traveled in Italy during the war and again in

1946, emphasized the importance of
the division of the population in the
nation. The north, mostly industrial,
is the main communist area. South
of Rome, the moderator explained,
is mostly agricultural and is influ
enced a great deal by the Vatican
and its Christian Democrat Party.
'■Results of the 1946 election seem
somewhat significant." stated Del
zell, "for the Christian Democrats
polled 38 per cent of the votes
against 21 and 19 per cent respec
tively for the Socialists and Com
munists."
The panel decided that no matter
which group won the election, the
economic problems would prove a
"hard nut to crack." The three dil
ficulties seem to lie in unemploy
ment, over-population, and distribu
tion of land and property.
Delzell mentioned that the com
munists have a definite advantage
in the approaching election because
of their determined stand in solving
these problems. The opposing
church-suported party has failed to
instigate agricultural and industrial
reforms which have been such an
important phase of the communist
platform.
In response to a question regard
ing the strength of the Red Party,
the panel chairman traced the
growth of Marxist socialism in Italy.
The first half of the panel was
recorded for the 8 p.m. KSU broad
cast, "International Round Table."
Next week's discussion will deal
with the "Aftermath of the Italian
Elections."
