# U.S. Diplomats, Russ Paper See Red Weakness in Italy
## 
### 
MOSCOW, April 14 (UP).—The
influential trade union weekly New
Times said today that "progressive"
forces in Italy faced a more difficult
situation in next Sunday's election
than they did in the election of
June, 194(i.
The New Times frequently
sounds the keynote for comment in
such situations.
"Reaction" has mobilized all its
forces for the Italian election, the
New Times said,
"American imperialism helps re-i
action," the publication said. "The
Vatican supports it. It widely ap
plies terroristic methods in the
struggle against democratic ele
ments."
The newspaper Red Fleet, organ
of the navy, implied in its editorial
that "reaction" in Italy does not in
tend to yield its present power re
gardless of the election result.
Red Fleet complained that Ital
ian Premier Alcide de Gasperi has
not yet outlined his course in the
event that the Communist Front
wins.
"It is characteristic that up to the
present Gasperi has not given an
answer to the question whether he
will respect the will of the people
and cede his place to a government
of the new front if the front obtains
a victory," Red Fleet said. "Italian
reaction does not hide the fact that
it is preparing to retain power at
all costs."

ROME. April 14 (UP).—Ameri- j
(••-in and British diplomats said to- 1
day Russia has given up hope of i
i Communists winning the April 18 I
election.
They said they believed the
Communists will make no attempt
to seize power illegally, either be
| fore or after the election.
The Western power diplomats |
I joined unanimous Italian opinion j
that Russia's rejection of the Tri- I
este proposal finished the chances |
of local Communists in the ballot- j
j ingr
One top-ranking diplomat even j
went so far as to say Russia's
refusal to negotiate on Trieste j
i marked "final proof of the end of ;
the Cominform policy of direct ac- '
tion and violence in Italy and j
probably in France as well."
Officials had feared post-election
trouble if, say, the Communists won j
. 40 per cent of the vote but then
were excluded from the govern- |
ment. Now they believe the Coc- |
munist-leftwing Socialist bloc will i
| not get enough votes to force its '
way into the coalition.
The two largest independent j
newspapers in Rome agreed that
Russia has written off a Communist I
victory here. They predicted the ,
Christian Democrats will win, and j
said the Soviet Union's refusal to j
return Trieste to Italy can only
mean Russia has abandoned Italy's
Communists for the time being.

MOSCOW, April 14 (UP).—The
influential trade union weekly New
Times said today that "progressive"
forces in Italy faced a more difficult
situation in next Sunday's election
than they did in the election of
June, 194(i.
The New Times frequently
sounds the keynote for comment in
such situations.
"Reaction" has mobilized all its
forces for the Italian election, the
New Times said,
"American imperialism helps re-i
action," the publication said. "The
Vatican supports it. It widely ap
plies terroristic methods in the
struggle against democratic ele
ments."
The newspaper Red Fleet, organ
of the navy, implied in its editorial
that "reaction" in Italy does not in
tend to yield its present power re
gardless of the election result.
Red Fleet complained that Ital
ian Premier Alcide de Gasperi has
not yet outlined his course in the
event that the Communist Front
wins.
"It is characteristic that up to the
present Gasperi has not given an
answer to the question whether he
will respect the will of the people
and cede his place to a government
of the new front if the front obtains
a victory," Red Fleet said. "Italian
reaction does not hide the fact that
it is preparing to retain power at
all costs."

ROME. April 14 (UP).—Ameri- j
(••-in and British diplomats said to- 1
day Russia has given up hope of i
i Communists winning the April 18 I
election.
They said they believed the
Communists will make no attempt
to seize power illegally, either be
| fore or after the election.
The Western power diplomats |
I joined unanimous Italian opinion j
that Russia's rejection of the Tri- I
este proposal finished the chances |
of local Communists in the ballot- j
j ingr
One top-ranking diplomat even j
went so far as to say Russia's
refusal to negotiate on Trieste j
i marked "final proof of the end of ;
the Cominform policy of direct ac- '
tion and violence in Italy and j
probably in France as well."
