## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP)
Gen. Omar N. Bradley told Congress
loday that American security de
mands 1,080.000 ground troops under
..rms because air power alone cannot
defend the nation or wage offensive
war.
The army chief of staff went be
fore the House Armed Services
Commitee to appeal for quick pas
>age of the draft and universal mili
tary training laws and to sound a
jrim warning against over-depend
ence on air power.
UK SPOKE as an air-minded
House opened debate on a bill to
jive the air forces and the navy a
32.376.100,000 advance against their
1949 budgets to buy 3.200 new com
oat planes, guided missiles and robot
aircraft in the 12 months beginning
July 1.
There was loud talk among Re
publicans and Democrats for a big
increase in that appropriation to
help cut down Russia's 12 to 1 edge
in aircraft production. One House
member proposed an amendment to
. ild $2,000.000,000 to the air force
budget.
BIT BRADLEY, without opposing
the air force expansion talk, re
minded the armed services commit
tee that national security requires
balanced strength on land, sea, and
in the air.
"ll we. as a result of weakness in
land or naval strength, permit any
enemy to seize such bases as Alaska,
Greenland. Iceland, Spitzbergen. or
".he Azores, then we shall have laid
our industrial and population een
-.ers open to air attack." he said.
"AI.L THE Ant forces and anti
aircraft artilleries of the world could
not prevent it. Only troops occupy
ing such bases could give us pro
tection. Those troops are the army."
Bradley asked Congress to give
him a regular standing army of 822.-
000 men. 14 now has 542,009 men.
*;Tr below its authorized strength of
1*69,000.

WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP)
Gen. Omar N. Bradley told Congress
loday that American security de
mands 1,080.000 ground troops under
..rms because air power alone cannot
defend the nation or wage offensive
war.
The army chief of staff went be
fore the House Armed Services
Commitee to appeal for quick pas
>age of the draft and universal mili
tary training laws and to sound a
jrim warning against over-depend
ence on air power.
UK SPOKE as an air-minded
House opened debate on a bill to
jive the air forces and the navy a
32.376.100,000 advance against their
1949 budgets to buy 3.200 new com
oat planes, guided missiles and robot
aircraft in the 12 months beginning
July 1.
There was loud talk among Re
publicans and Democrats for a big
increase in that appropriation to
help cut down Russia's 12 to 1 edge
in aircraft production. One House
member proposed an amendment to
. ild $2,000.000,000 to the air force
budget.
BIT BRADLEY, without opposing
the air force expansion talk, re
minded the armed services commit
tee that national security requires
balanced strength on land, sea, and
in the air.
"ll we. as a result of weakness in
land or naval strength, permit any
enemy to seize such bases as Alaska,
Greenland. Iceland, Spitzbergen. or
".he Azores, then we shall have laid
our industrial and population een
-.ers open to air attack." he said.
"AI.L THE Ant forces and anti
aircraft artilleries of the world could

ing such bases could give us pro
tection. Those troops are the army."

him a regular standing army of 822.-
