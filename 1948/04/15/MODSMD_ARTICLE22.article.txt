WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP).â€”
The House Un-American Activities
Committee voted unanimously to
day to back a bill that would re
quire the Communist party and all
its members to be registered with
the Justice Department.
The registration requirement is
part of the committee's sweeping
Communist - control bill which
would make top officials of the U.S.
Communist party liable to a 10-
year jail sentence unless they broke
all tics with Moscow.
The committee also formally ap
proved parts of the proposed over
all bill which would:
1. Prevent any member of a
Communist organization holding a
non-e'ective federal job or running
for an elective office unless he
states that he is a member ol the
organization.
2. Prohibit the issuance of pass
ports to Communists.
