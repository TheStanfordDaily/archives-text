### 
WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP) —

which in 2!) days slowed the nation's
industrial output to a walk, can be
fined or pailed if he is convicted.
His United Mine Workers Union ,

judge and jury, is the same jurist
who slapped a $10,000 fine on Lewis :

17 months ago for defying a similar ;
anti-strike order.
