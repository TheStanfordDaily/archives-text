# Rural Backing Wins Nebraska For Stassen
## 
### 
CMAHA, April 14 (UP)â€”Harold
E. Stassen won the Nebraska Re
publican presidential primary today
against six top drawer opponents by
appealing to the predominant rural
vote and getting it.
He carried his cracker-barrel
campaign technique of shaking
hands and answering questions
straightforwardly to the grass roots
of the farm and range country. It
paid off with victory over Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey of New York, Sen.
Robert A. Taft of Ohio, Sen. Arthur
Vandenberg of Michigan, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur, Gov. Earl War
ren of California, and House Speaker
Joe Martin of Masachusetts.
IN SCORING HIS smashing vic
tory in the Nebraska free-for-all
popularity contest, Stassen amassed
almost half the approximately 180,-
000 primary votes cast yesterday. He
lost Douglas County (Omaha), the
state's metropolitan center, by 4.000
votes to Dewey, but won Lincoln,
the state capital and second largest
city, by a margin of 1,500 votes.
But it was on the farm where
Stassen's star was the brightest, He
campaigned the state intensively,
ranging from west to east and south
to north with single forays to Omaha
and Lincoln. He drummed on farm
policy that met with rural approval,
plugged for development of the Mis
souri River Basin, criticized the Tin
man administration to the citizens
of this overwhelmingly Republican
state, and struck out at comumnism.
