## Watch It! 
### 
Money and politics always seem to bring out the worst in
human beings. Stanford students are no exception. Even here
some candidates will pull almost anything out of the bag to
swing an election. They're the ones to watch.
Watch out for the operators who hitch their wagon to a
popular issue and ride their way into office on that issue. Find
out who and what the candidate is, not what cause he is cur
rently supporting.
Watch out for the big shot who has made a name in some
unrelated activity. Don't vote for him just because he can plan
a good dance or pitches winning horseshoes. These are student
government offices, not positions of popularity.
Watch out for the silent clam who is backed by an influential
group. Charlie McCarthys don't talk or act for themselves.
Watch the candidates themselves in their personal appear
ances at your living group, read what they say in The Daily.
Use a little discretion. It does make a difference; any one
of the candidates is nof as good as the next.
