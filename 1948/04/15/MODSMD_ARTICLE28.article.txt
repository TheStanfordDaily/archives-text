To the Editor:
When the communists took over Russia in 1917, they did so by force.
They then established the procedure—violent overthrow —which they con
sidered proper for the "conversion" of non-communist peoples and gov
ernments. Since then, they have modified this technique, ranging from
peaceful union, in the case of the Baltic nations, through semi-military
extortion, with Central European territories, to open assault on Finland.
We also note some doubtfully indirect "salvation" of several nations who
"independently" accepted the creed of the Comintern.
One cannot help remembering the statement by the rulers of Russia
that communism and capitalism cannot peacefully exist in the same
world. These facts, plus the news that Russia's aircraft production is 12
times ours bring home an inescapable feeling; a feeling that the finger
of communism is pointing at America; that, either we give up our
voluntarily, or they will force us to give it up. That they are becoming
increasingly capable of enforcing this demand is alarmingly apparent.
Well, how about it? Are we going to wait till they're all set to whip us
before we finally wise up? Remember. Last time it was 85 million Ger
mans. This time it will be MO million communists, with, perhaps, the
backing of the industrial might of the whole Eurasian continent.
