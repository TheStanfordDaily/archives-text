# A 						Laugh Has a Price
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It was with singular disappointment that I discovered this morning
that a professor, distinguished for his work in history and greatly
admired for his form of presentation, found it necessary to interject an
anecdote with definite racial implications in his lecture, in order to "get
a laugh" from the students.
"Getting a laugh" is both an honorable and excellent method of teaching,
providing instruction is furthered thereby, but "getting a laugh" at the
expense of charity and understanding is unforgiveable in a university
where both are held to be our common aim.
First shock, then unbelief, then horror, and now sadness have clouded
my estimation of the professor. Respected for his accomplishments, he is
in danger of losing that respect by such senseless flippancy. Admired for
his eloquence, he is selling that eloquence for a snicker*.
