U.S. Builds Anti-Communist Wall
WASHINGTON (UP) —Consolidation of Europe
into a working cooperative group rather than a
number of selfish, competing nations is the prime
objective of the Marshall Plan.
"If the Western* European nations don't hang
together, they will hang separately," one high olli
rial said recently.
The most dramatic move has been the first steps
toward a political and military alliance of all West
ern European countries to answer the challenge of
creeping eommunism.
In the economic field. United States aid. even
though it may amount to many billions in the
next four years, can be only a marginal factor
in Europe's recovery. The chief factor will be
maximum self-help and mutual cooperation among
the Europeans themselves.
Thus, when the Europeans submitted their require
ments to the United States, they pledged themselves
to undertake to:
"Develop its production, particularly of food
and coal.
"Make fullest and most effective use of existing
productive capacity and all available manpower.
"Modernize its equipment and transport.
"Apply all necessary measures leading to internal
financial and economic stability.
"Cooperate to reduce tariffs and other barriers
to trade between themselves and with the rest of
the world.
"Remove progresively the obstacles to the free
movement of persons within Europe.
"Organize together the means by which common
resources can be developed in partnership."
What steps have the European nations taken to
get started toward these "targets"? The State De
partment cites the following:
Food, coal, and steel production—"ln each of these
fields there has ben significant progress." France
expects to produce 400.000 tons more of bread grains
this year than estimated last summer. British coal
for export has increased since the end of 1947. Al
though German coal production slumped early in
1948, it is crawling back. All steel producers except
Britain have increased the raw steel output since
194(>.
Manpower—The Marshall Plan countries conferred
in Rome in January on vfeys of using surplus man
power of one country in other countries and the
movement of such surpluses across international
frontiers.
Monetary stability—The Marshall Plan countries
have "intensified their efforts to balance their budg
ets, reduce inflationary pressures, and restore confi
dence in their currencies."
Trade barriers—Belgium. The Netherlands, France,
Luxembourg, and Italy signed an agreement which
makes it possible for a country with credit with
another country to use it to settle a debit resulting
from current payments to a third country. Fourteen
of the 16 Marshall Plan countries also met to .study
a possible customs union to reduce tariffs.
Extreme critics of the Marshall Plan charge that
it will be a colossal global WPA.
Some of the critics charge that the United States
cannot fulfill the proposed bill for Europe without
creating more shortages, higher prices, and hardships
for the American people.
The President's committees which studied the proj
ect challenged that argument. They unanimously
reported that the United States could afford to
undertake the job and predicted it would cause
minimum sacrifices by Americans.
The State Department's argument for ERP runs
like this: -
"Over the next two or three years, the European
Recovery Program may prevent taxes from being
reduced as much as otherwise might be the case.
Over a somewhat longer period, the European Re
covery Program might very well prevent enormous
tax increases to put this country on a war footing.
"If Western Europe should become dominated

by communists, which is likely in the event of a
European economic breakdown, the United States
probably would be obliged to make up for the loss
of allies in Europe by enormously increasing its
expenditures for military purposes."
The administration admits that ERP will require
"inconveniences and even sacrifices by American
citizens in terms of prices, taxes, and commodity
shortages."
