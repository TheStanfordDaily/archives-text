## History 1948 
### 
The trigger-happy Bogotaian who eclipsed liberal
faction chief Jorge Gaitan and started all the rico
cheting around the Columbian capital was a most
undiplomatic guy. The revolution wasn't scheduled
until later—after the Ninth Pan-American Confer
ence adjourned. But somebody slipped up.
Now with correspondents crawling around on their
tummies dodging lead, the shooting close-up is likely
to remind these imported newsmen of the war some
of them covered not so long ago. Had the conference
not been there, the resident correspondent would
likely have cursed as he left the local cantina to
cover the story. But with Bogota staffed with top
notch scoopers, the headlines make the thing out a
lot more serious than it probably is.
Internationally, this is the most ill-timed revolt
ever staged in Latin America. But as far as Colom
bian liberals are concerned,( they're forcing a quick
settlement with the conservatives). To save face and
restore some order, President Perez suggests a 13-
member coalition—six liberals, six conservatives, and
one nonpolitical militarist.
But the loudest noise diplomatically out of Bogota
was the silence that greeted the reading of Secretary
of State Marshall's message proposing a $500,000,000
Export-Import loan to Latin Americans. When the
speech ended, the delegates just sat on their hands.
In that awful void of diplomatic etiquette, the U. S.
learned how it stands with the Latins.
The revolution will give Mr. Marshall a chance to
think things over; something he badly needs.
Back of Bogota stands eight other Pan-American
conferences, starting in 1889.
At the sixth, in Havana, 1928, the U. S. took another
beating—and deservingly. Coolidge did a verbal flip
flop trying to make amends for his earlier utterance
that "our government has certain rights over and
certain duties toward our own citizens and their
property wherever they might be located." When
Coolidge admitted frankly at Havana that "it is
better for the people to make their own mistakes,"
his words were hollow. The reason: U. S. Marines
were still in Haiti; we continued throttling Cuban
international relations by our 1901-imposed Piatt
amendment to the Cuban Constitution which author
ized us to intervene as guarantee of Cuba's inde
pendence.
When FDR called the seventh Pan-American Con
ference at Montevideo (1933), the "Good Neighbor
Policy" was born and a new era of Latin relations
begun. A year after Montevideo, Roosevelt recalled
the marines from Haiti; it was the first time in 3(5
years that the U. S. had no armed forces in Latin
America.
Through a long line of commercial, industrial,
scientific, and agricultural conventions, the Pan
Americans have gradually lost some of their fear of
the U. S. But Argentina has grown increasingly into
the role of spokesman for Latin America. And the
U. S. rout in Mexico's roof-and-mouth war stamped
us again as Yankee imperialists—if not politically
imperialistic, certainly economically. The jailing of
a Stanford student's father in Argentina recently,
charged with monopoly of the textile industry, was
an example of Latin reaction.
The U. S. went to Bogota with no claim to vir
ginity in Latin American relations. We are finding
out that our economic rough-shodding is becoming
increasingly less palatable to Latin stomachs. But
while even the most anti of the Latins admit they
need capital, most prefer to get it from surplus-rich
Argentina.

Export-Import loan to Latin Americans. When the
speech ended, the delegates just sat on their hands.
In that awful void of diplomatic etiquette, the U. S.
learned how it stands with the Latins.
The revolution will give Mr. Marshall a chance to
think things over; something he badly needs.
Back of Bogota stands eight other Pan-American
conferences, starting in 1889.
At the sixth, in Havana, 1928, the U. S. took another
beating—and deservingly. Coolidge did a verbal flip
flop trying to make amends for his earlier utterance
that "our government has certain rights over and
certain duties toward our own citizens and their
property wherever they might be located." When
Coolidge admitted frankly at Havana that "it is
better for the people to make their own mistakes,"
his words were hollow. The reason: U. S. Marines
were still in Haiti; we continued throttling Cuban
international relations by our 1901-imposed Piatt
amendment to the Cuban Constitution which author
ized us to intervene as guarantee of Cuba's inde
pendence.
When FDR called the seventh Pan-American Con
ference at Montevideo (1933), the "Good Neighbor
Policy" was born and a new era of Latin relations
begun. A year after Montevideo, Roosevelt recalled
the marines from Haiti; it was the first time in 3(5
years that the U. S. had no armed forces in Latin
America.
Through a long line of commercial, industrial,
scientific, and agricultural conventions, the Pan
Americans have gradually lost some of their fear of
the U. S. But Argentina has grown increasingly into
the role of spokesman for Latin America. And the
U. S. rout in Mexico's roof-and-mouth war stamped
us again as Yankee imperialists—if not politically
imperialistic, certainly economically. The jailing of
a Stanford student's father in Argentina recently,
charged with monopoly of the textile industry, was
an example of Latin reaction.
The U. S. went to Bogota with no claim to vir
ginity in Latin American relations. We are finding
out that our economic rough-shodding is becoming
increasingly less palatable to Latin stomachs. But
while even the most anti of the Latins admit they
need capital, most prefer to get it from surplus-rich
Argentina.
The trigger-happy Bogotaian who eclipsed liberal
faction chief Jorge Gaitan and started all the rico
cheting around the Columbian capital was a most
undiplomatic guy. The revolution wasn't scheduled
until later—after the Ninth Pan-American Confer
ence adjourned. But somebody slipped up.
Now with correspondents crawling around on their
tummies dodging lead, the shooting close-up is likely
to remind these imported newsmen of the war some
of them covered not so long ago. Had the conference
not been there, the resident correspondent would
likely have cursed as he left the local cantina to
cover the story. But with Bogota staffed with top
notch scoopers, the headlines make the thing out a
lot more serious than it probably is.
Internationally, this is the most ill-timed revolt
ever staged in Latin America. But as far as Colom
bian liberals are concerned,( they're forcing a quick
settlement with the conservatives). To save face and
restore some order, President Perez suggests a 13-
member coalition—six liberals, six conservatives, and
one nonpolitical militarist.
But the loudest noise diplomatically out of Bogota
was the silence that greeted the reading of Secretary
of State Marshall's message proposing a $500,000,000
Export-Import loan to Latin Americans. When the
speech ended, the delegates just sat on their hands.
