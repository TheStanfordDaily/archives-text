# EVAN CONNELL
## Bull Session 
### 
Come out the art department ducking like I al
ways do ever since George mistook me for a cop and
planted his shoved on my maxillary, and it's raining.
I'm wondering how to get over for my apple juice
without rain when an umbrellacycle whirs by.
Naturally it's George. He backs up.
"George! You old asbestos hound!" I shout, pound
ing him 011 the cervical vertebrae. "Good to see you,
fella!"
"H'lo." says George. After he thinks a while he
says, "Ride?"
So on I hop. While we're whirring along toward
apple juice I say, "Looks like rain." But before
George can answer there is a college girl in the way.
She's stuck. She's got a f no t caught in her fashion,
and here we are whirring down the sidewalk and
she sees us and screams for help. George stamps
on the brakes so we're screeching, and two football
players are yanking on this girl's leg trying to un
swathe her, but she's all gummed up with the flying
folds snarled on the sidewalk and she screams again
only then it's all over so she never felt much pain.
George is picking parts of her wool shroud-suit
out of the gears 011 the umbrellacycle and they are
spreading a sheet over the fashion girl when I see
George is crying. Blubbering all over the tires.
First time I have ever seen this. I am curious.

To mc it seems a good idea: one less New Sack on the
campus, even though I am sorry of course for the
little girl who got sucked in by the magazines-which
understand-taste-in-clothes. But I am curious about
George crying. "Why are you crying, George?"
"She got killed." blubbers George all over his big
fat friendly face.
"Well, that's tough, but you carry on like she was
about to he a mother or something."
Wails from George—loud wails.
"George!" Suddenly I get it. "George! She wasn't
'that way'; it's just the new fashion style for girls
which-know-taste-in-Hothes. Cross myself. Brace
yourself, man. They all all the little girls wear
clothes too big nowadays. It's smart. Don't they look
knocked-out?"
Louder he cries.
I try to cheer him up. "They haven't come un
zipped. or anything, George; they're supposed to look
that way. It's stunning—don't you read the maga
zines? You just think it makes them look fat. Why,
George, pretty soon when you go out with a girl
you won't even know it's a girl. Won't that be mys
terious and fun?"
But I guess I made a mistake because when I look
down on the sidewalk. George is crumpled up numb.
And I look up and the rain is dropping like even
the sky is crying.
Come out the art department ducking like I al

Come out the art department ducking like I al
ways do ever since George mistook me for a cop and
planted his shoved on my maxillary, and it's raining.
I'm wondering how to get over for my apple juice
without rain when an umbrellacycle whirs by.
Naturally it's George. He backs up.
"George! You old asbestos hound!" I shout, pound
ing him 011 the cervical vertebrae. "Good to see you,
fella!"
"H'lo." says George. After he thinks a while he
says, "Ride?"
So on I hop. While we're whirring along toward
apple juice I say, "Looks like rain." But before
George can answer there is a college girl in the way.
She's stuck. She's got a f no t caught in her fashion,
and here we are whirring down the sidewalk and
she sees us and screams for help. George stamps
on the brakes so we're screeching, and two football
players are yanking on this girl's leg trying to un
swathe her, but she's all gummed up with the flying
folds snarled on the sidewalk and she screams again
only then it's all over so she never felt much pain.
George is picking parts of her wool shroud-suit
out of the gears 011 the umbrellacycle and they are
spreading a sheet over the fashion girl when I see
George is crying. Blubbering all over the tires.
First time I have ever seen this. I am curious.

To mc it seems a good idea: one less New Sack on the
campus, even though I am sorry of course for the
little girl who got sucked in by the magazines-which
understand-taste-in-clothes. But I am curious about
George crying. "Why are you crying, George?"
"She got killed." blubbers George all over his big
fat friendly face.
"Well, that's tough, but you carry on like she was
about to he a mother or something."
Wails from George—loud wails.
"George!" Suddenly I get it. "George! She wasn't
'that way'; it's just the new fashion style for girls
which-know-taste-in-Hothes. Cross myself. Brace
yourself, man. They all all the little girls wear
clothes too big nowadays. It's smart. Don't they look
knocked-out?"
Louder he cries.
I try to cheer him up. "They haven't come un
zipped. or anything, George; they're supposed to look
that way. It's stunning—don't you read the maga
zines? You just think it makes them look fat. Why,
George, pretty soon when you go out with a girl
you won't even know it's a girl. Won't that be mys
terious and fun?"
But I guess I made a mistake because when I look
down on the sidewalk. George is crumpled up numb.
And I look up and the rain is dropping like even
the sky is crying.
