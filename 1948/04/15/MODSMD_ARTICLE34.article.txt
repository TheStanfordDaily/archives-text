# Bush Predicts Many Seniors Will Choose the Wrong Job
## 
### BY AL McCOMBS 
Thirty-one per cent of the Stan
ford senior class is undecided about
its future occupation, and of these
a large number may make serious
mistakes in choosing a vocation un
less they seek appropriate special
ized guidance.
This prediction, made by Dr. Rob
ert N. Bush, director of the Stan
ford Appointment Service, is based
upon a tabulation of student re
sponse to a query polling what oc
cupations the students plan to enter
in the future.
Dr. Bush said employment spe
cialists estimate that at least two
thirds of the people employed in
the United States are dissatisfied
with their work. Care, then, should
be exercised by the student in
choosing a life occupation.
SERIOUS THOUGHT concerning
this matter should be made by the
student now, not at the last minute,
Dr. Bush added. This includes en
tering a school where adequate in
struction may be received and out
lining courses in order to receive
maximum background and prepara
tion.
Three types of specialized guid
ance are available to Stanford stu
dents. In addition, the school's cur
riculum has been arranged, except
in pre-med and pre-engineering, so
that the student need not choose a
major until the end of his sopho
more year.
Students in search of guidance
may contact counselors or faculty,
the registration office, or the Ap
pointment Service. Vocational in
terest and aptitude tests may be ac
quired through the administration.
ONE OF THE BEST tests is the
Strong Vocational Interest Test, avail
able at the registration office infor
mation window. This test diagnoses
interests and indicates whether the
student is headed in the right direc
tion. No test, however, should be
accepted as conclusive.
Stanford's Appointment Service
offers help to undecided students

and to the student who wishes job
I employment. The service is anxious
to help and counsel students on vo
cations and occupations, and the
service is always available.
Six conditions are recommended
for consideration by the student
who wants to get into a satisfying
vocation.
The first is ability and aptitude.
Second, the student should con
sider what ability, drive, ambition,
or purpose he possesses.
ANOTHER POINT IS the extent
of interest in the work required fcy
the occupation and interest in work
in common to others employed in
the field so that conflict may be
avoided.
Fourth, the opportunities of the
field should be considered. Is it a
field of growing importance, at its
peak, or declining? A field which
is growing offers the greatest chance
for employment or advancement, al
though a person with outstanding
qualifications usually can get into
any field.
Personal requirements are another
. factor. Each job requires different
personal characteristics.
THE LAST REQUIREMENT di
rectly concerns college students,
i This involves proper training avail
able to prepare oneself for a job.
Students should consider choice of
college realistically from the point
of view of sufficient training.
Persons who limit themselves to
Persons who limit themselves as
to the area they wish to work in
only limit their chances for employ
ment. Seventy-five per cent of the
1 jobs listed with the Appointment
: Service are for the West Coast. This
area is expanding, especially around
Seattle, Portland, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles.
However, many companies send
prospective employes back East for
training and then transfer them to
wherever they are needed. If a stu
dent is trained on the West Coast,
he stands a good chance of remain
ing here.

be exercised by the student in
choosing a life occupation.
SERIOUS THOUGHT concerning
this matter should be made by the
student now, not at the last minute,
Dr. Bush added. This includes en
tering a school where adequate in
struction may be received and out
lining courses in order to receive
maximum background and prepara
tion.
Three types of specialized guid
ance are available to Stanford stu
dents. In addition, the school's cur
riculum has been arranged, except
in pre-med and pre-engineering, so
that the student need not choose a
major until the end of his sopho
more year.
Students in search of guidance
may contact counselors or faculty,
the registration office, or the Ap
pointment Service. Vocational in
terest and aptitude tests may be ac
quired through the administration.
ONE OF THE BEST tests is the
Strong Vocational Interest Test, avail
able at the registration office infor
mation window. This test diagnoses
interests and indicates whether the
student is headed in the right direc
tion. No test, however, should be
accepted as conclusive.
Stanford's Appointment Service
offers help to undecided students

and to the student who wishes job
I employment. The service is anxious
to help and counsel students on vo
cations and occupations, and the
service is always available.
Six conditions are recommended
for consideration by the student
who wants to get into a satisfying
vocation.
The first is ability and aptitude.
Second, the student should con
sider what ability, drive, ambition,
or purpose he possesses.
ANOTHER POINT IS the extent
of interest in the work required fcy
the occupation and interest in work
in common to others employed in
the field so that conflict may be
avoided.
Fourth, the opportunities of the
field should be considered. Is it a
field of growing importance, at its
peak, or declining? A field which
is growing offers the greatest chance
for employment or advancement, al
though a person with outstanding
qualifications usually can get into
any field.
Personal requirements are another
. factor. Each job requires different
personal characteristics.
THE LAST REQUIREMENT di
rectly concerns college students,
i This involves proper training avail
able to prepare oneself for a job.
Students should consider choice of
college realistically from the point
of view of sufficient training.
Persons who limit themselves to
Persons who limit themselves as
to the area they wish to work in
only limit their chances for employ
ment. Seventy-five per cent of the
1 jobs listed with the Appointment
: Service are for the West Coast. This
area is expanding, especially around
Seattle, Portland, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles.
However, many companies send
prospective employes back East for
training and then transfer them to
wherever they are needed. If a stu
dent is trained on the West Coast,
he stands a good chance of remain
ing here.
Thirty-one per cent of the Stan
ford senior class is undecided about
its future occupation, and of these
a large number may make serious
mistakes in choosing a vocation un
less they seek appropriate special
ized guidance.
This prediction, made by Dr. Rob
ert N. Bush, director of the Stan
ford Appointment Service, is based
upon a tabulation of student re
sponse to a query polling what oc
cupations the students plan to enter
in the future.
Dr. Bush said employment spe
cialists estimate that at least two
thirds of the people employed in
the United States are dissatisfied
with their work. Care, then, should
be exercised by the student in
