# 'The Children of Paradise' Presents Theme of despair
## 
### 
"The Children of Paradise" at the
| Guild Theater aren't a happy |
bunch, according to the "classical" j
French film with English subtitles.
All foreign films must have a \
moral and this one is no exception.
! The theme is one of despair and
I futility: you rarely get out of life
j what you want and those who don't
know what they want are usually
; better off.
1 This tableau of the Victor Hugo
| days in the Parisian theater is built 1
around four characters — Baptiste, \
j the sad - faced mimic who brings |
out a woman's maternal instincts;
Frederic, an egotistical but charm
ing actor who sets his sights on
playing "Othello"; Francois, the
t unprincipled "heavy" of the piece; j
and Garance. the mistress of many
I and the lover of only one, Baptiste.
IN ADDITION, there are Natalie,
1 Baptiste's wife, and Edouard, the |
j count who makes a respectable, or
i rather rich, woman of Garance. |
All four men seek the love of Ga
rance. Baptiste is the only one to
1 win it. Francois leads a merry life
of crime, but finally goes too far by
killing Edouard. an act that the
Parisian police force is certain to
j frown upon.
FREDERIC ALSO FAILS in
i winning Garance, and Natalie loses
Bapliste. Nobody gets anything out
of the whole mess, which just

j shows that life is only a trap.
I The technical end of the film is
j poorly handled, the photography is
sub-par, but the excellent charae
j terizations make up for this. -A
minimum of English subtitles is
j used, just enough to carry the non
linguistic movie-goer over the
rough spots.
The names of the cast can be
read during the introduction, if
you're quick enough. However, ii
! makes little difference in enjoy-:
| ment.
Incidentally, the "finest sound
recorder equipment obtainable in
this day of near mechanical perfec
tion,'' as the Guild announcement
so charmingly puts it. broke down
again. Cherchez la femme, I guess.
