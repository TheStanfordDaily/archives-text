# '51 Tankmen Seeking Fifth Straight Win
## 
### 
The St. Mary's varsity swimming
team travels to Stanford tomorrow
to take on the Indian freshmen in
a dual meet scheduled to start at
4 p.m. in the Encina pool. The
Gaels will be the fifth opponent of
the undefeated frosh paddlers.
So far this season, Stanford has
dunked four teams in succession.
They started with the San Jose
frosh, defeating them 45-30. The
three other wins all came last week.
A surprisingly strong Sequoia
High School team held Stanford to
a 34-31 victory. Then, both San
Francisco State and Stockton Jun
ior College were decisioncd, 50-25,
over the week-end.
