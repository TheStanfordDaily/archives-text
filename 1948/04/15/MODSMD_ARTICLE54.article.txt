# Roble Boasts Net Star; Martha Miller in Top 10
## 
### BY PETE GREENFIELD 
One of the outstanding members
of "Robleites Remarkable" is tennis
player Martha Miller, who recently
was ranked tenth in the national
junior girls seedings and named to
the Junior Wightman Cup squad.
Martha obtained this excellent
ranking by her many tournament
victories throughout the Midwest
and her fine performances in the
national junior girls tourney in
Philadelphia. In last year's nationals,
she reached the quarter-final round
in both singles and doubles before
being eliminated.
Incidentally, Miss Miller and
Dorothy Watman form the fifth best
junior girls' doubles combination in
the country.
HINSDALE, a small suburb of
Chicago, is Martha's home town. At
the age of 10, Martha was intro
duced to tennis at a local country
club. Martha received a good be
ginning because her first tennis tu
tor was Sharvey Umbeck, who now
coaches the national collegiate net
champs of College of William and
Mary.
When she was 12, Miss Miller be
gan to hit the high brackets. Two
years later she became junior girls
(18 years and under) champ of Chi
cago.

. THE FOLLOWING SUMMER,
Martha, then a 15-year-old prodigy,
among other victories copped the
women's title in the Northwestern
I States championships at Minne
i apolis.
Martha, now 18. is a Roble fresh
man and a tentative Speech and
Drama major. She is 5 feet 5 inches
tall with a freckled doll-like
decorated by gray eyes and blond
! bangs.
NOWADAYS she usually gets i::
! three tennis sessions a week. Com
petition is not lacking, as Jerry
Jackson of Hurlburt and Patty Nix
on of Lagunita are also adept
racketeers.
"But from now on, I'm going to
engage in very little tournament
tennis," says Martha. "Competing;
in the women's brackets is much,
tougher than playing against girls."
Nevertheless, all Roble will be
rooting for Martha Miller when sh-e
; takes the court with the United
States Junior Wightman Cup team.
