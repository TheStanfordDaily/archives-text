# Farm Shell Collection, Begun in 1892, Is Shown
## 
### 
The Stanford sea-shell collection,
ope of the half-dozen largest in the
United States, is rivaled only by
two other university collections. It I
is on display on the third floor of !
the Geology Building.
"Stanford's collection, featured at |
a. recent geology department open j
house, contains shells from all over
the world, representing most of the !
many varieties of sea-shells.
Miss A. Myra Keen, -curator of
paleontology, is in charge of the
collection, which is available for
study to scientists, students, and
laymen.
THE SHELLS are divided into
two sections. One group is ar- i
ranged according to biological re- !
lationships, and the other according j
to locality and geological horizon, i
The collection is valued at $100,000.
Professor J. C. Branner, head of
the geology department since the
.founding of Stanford, and Dr.
James P. Smith, first professor of ,
paleontology here, began the col- |
lection in 1892 by purchasing the |
Annie Law collection of marine I
and land shells.
The collection has grown stead
ily for 56 years from contributions, ,
student collections, and purchases.
IN ADDITION to their use in the
teaching of biological and mineral
sciences, both in universities and
high schools, the shells have been
found an effective aid in unraveling j
geological structures. Geologists j
have used Stanford's collection as J
a basis for explorations in oil, met
als, and building stone deposits.
During the war, these specimens
were studied by the armed forces,
which were interested in informa- |
tion on edible and non - marine |
mollusks. The latter animals bear !
worms that cause many tropical
diseases.
Emperor Hirohito of Japan, in
private life a biologist, has twice
submitted shipments of material '
from his shell collection to Stanford
for verification.
