# Cord Meyer Says U.N. Is Only 'Armed Truce'
## 
### 
"The United Nations is nothing better than an armed truce,"
Cord Meyer emphasized yesterday. He spoke to a group of
campus leaders in the afternoon and to an overflowing crowd
last night at the Palo Alto High School auditorium.
Meyer, national president of the United World Federalists, said,

"This is a jungle world of separate
sovereign states. The UN has left
unchanged the basic structure of
international anarchy."
Meyer, named one of the 19 out
standing young men of the year by
the U. S. Junior Chamber of Com
merce, believes our foreign policy
must act on two fronts. We must
have a policy of armed prepared
ness so long as other countries pre
pare, and at the same time we must
define in general terms the struc
ture and principles of a world fed
eration which we are willing to back
up.
MEYER EMPHASIZED again a?
in his recent book, "Peace or An
archy," that there is no defense
against the atom bomb nor again>t
the biological and chemical weapons
that have been developed.
"Only a universal structure ir
which all nations are members is ac
ceptable." This organization must
have the power to make and enforce
laws binding all individuals insofar
as they are a danger to peace.
Cord Meyer is on a national speak
ing tour to encourage the formation
of local organizations which can
force the election of leaders com
mitted to world federation.
In answering the question of how
to convince Russia of our sincerity
in wanting peace while we continue
arming, Meyer said our prepared
ness policy can be pursued without
the belligerent tone our press and
put lie officials now assume.
ASKED WHAT our policy should
be if Russia refuses to join the fed
eration, he said we must proceed
with a partial federation, but leave
the door open to those outside. He
repeated Dr. Einstein's prediction
that if Russia did not immediately
join, she would join eventually
rather than try to fight such a
combination.
Meyer pointed out that provision
is made in the UN charter for any
member to call a general meeting
to consider revision of that charter,
and in the United States the presi
dent has the power to call such a
meeting.
