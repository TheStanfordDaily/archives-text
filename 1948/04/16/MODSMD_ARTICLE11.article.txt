### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
Renewing one of their oldest track rivalries, the undefeated
Stanford varsity track team will challenge the San Francisco
Olympic Club, one of the best independent track teams on the
Pacific Cc.-.st, tomorrow at 1:45 p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
The Indians are fresh from their victory over San Jcse State

last Tuesday, as they out-distanced
the Spartans 70 to 61.
Excellent times in almost all of j
the events were turned in against
San Jose, the Cards' first meet of;
the young season. Otis Chandler !
threw 53 ft. 2 in. in the shot put; j
Larry Hoff ran the quarter-mile in >
43.9 seconds; Bill Larson leaped 13 â€¢
ft. 10 in. in the pole vault; and |
Downing McKee flashed over the j
high hurdles in 14.5 seconds.
THE OLYMPIC CLUB has con
sented to add a special event for
the meet tomorrow. Thirty minutes j
after the regular shot put has been i
completed. Otis Chandler will try |
to break a 91 ft. 10 1 in. American
record, in throwing the 16-pound
shot with both the right and left
hands.
But winning the meet may not be
as easy as it sounds. Guinn Smith,
the Olympic Club's ace pole vault- i
er, did not compete against either ;
San Jose or Cal. Martin Biles, who
has thrown 223 ft. in the javelin, j
and Bill Martinson, 9.8-second 100-
yard dash man, head a host of stars ;
from the Winged "O."
IN THE MILE and two - mile i

for the Indians. Cecil Cole recently ,
raced 9:35 in the two-mile, while
Frank Johnson, Jim Coughlin, and
Mushy Girard are all strong in the i
mile. A 1 Lyons and Jose Rael are
the chief Card candidates.
The Indians look strong in the |
middle distances. Larry Hoff, Pitch
Johnson, and x\l Wiikins are speed- 1
sters in the quarter-mile, and com
bine with Captain George Grimes
to run a smooth relay. Grimes and
A 1 Holubar may take the first two
places in the 880.
