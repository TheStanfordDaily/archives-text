# KEEN to Host Student Debate
## 
### 
Four Stanford students to whom
the Palestine problem is more than
a news item will discuss that
thorny issue over station KEEN
Sunday.
They will be the featured speak
ers on the second program of the
Stanford Speaks series which is
heard weekly at 12:30 p.m. over the
San Jose Station.
The speakers are Shaikh Hamad
Al-Khalifah, Allen E. Snyder, Ed
ward M. Ornitz Jr., and Arthur Ri
senfeld.
Al-Khalifah is the first cousin of
the ruler of Bahrein Island in the
heart of the Arab world. Snyder is
a former student at the University
of Beirut in Syria, and has traveled
extensively in the disputed regions.
Ornitz and Risenfeld, both pre
nied students, are studying the
Zionist movement and Jewish
problems in the Holy Land.
