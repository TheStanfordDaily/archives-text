## 'Students Unconcerned'? 
### 
Who can say that enjoying pleasures of college life, like a
good glass of beer or a beach party, is contributing to the general
American apathy on the world situation?
There are those who condemn the Stanford way of life in
that it amounts to nothing more than sticking your head in the
sand. Many, Stanford students among them, have remarked
that Stanford instead of accepting a positive attitude that some
thing can be done to remedy the present serious crisis have
accepted the idea that it's not their baby.
Maybe we aren't quite as wide awake as we should be today
but what would our critics suggest? Should our every moment
be spent in working for a lasting peace? Should we forsake
the trivial gaieties of college life in lieu of the deadly serious
problems facing us?
The solution to the question was answered by one group,
Students Concerned, who felt keenly enough about a real peace
to push every other concern into the background. But the aver
age college student is not ready to accept such a solution.
Certainly, it is a foremost duty in these times to keep pace
with the world scene, to use what small voice one has to vote
for a lasting peace.
But calling students ignorant and unconcerned solely because
they are happily following their own pleasures is a misstatement.
There is a time for serious considerations and a time for amuse
ment, each in the right proportion.
Must this be a school of extremes? Either you're altogether
devoted to working for a world peace or, as the vast majority is
falsely classified, totally unconcerned.
Should not our college years be used to enrich ourselves
both academically and socially. We are here to learn not to
lead a world crusade. —P. N.
