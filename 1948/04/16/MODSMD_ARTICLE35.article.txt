# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Sidestepped Issue 
### 
To the Editor:
Kenneth Dole made some valuable points in his letter appearing in
Monday's Daily, yet his conclusions do not seem logical to me. We all
agree that important issues will be at stake in the coming campus elec
tions and that we voters should attempt to eliminate "emotional con
fusion" in favor of rational consideration of these matters. Therefore,
Jel me first explain that I have no personal axe to grind in this "partisan
politeal action question. I am not running for any office: I am not a
member of any political action group because I do not agree with certain
advocated points in the programs of local active groups; I am only one
of many students who is trying to consider rationally the arguments pro
and con on the admittance of political action group meetings on our
campus.
I do not believe that these political action groups have ever claimed
to be discussion groups, whose function it is to present all sides of an
argument for the intellectual consideration of listeners; rather, their
function is to organize persons for united political action by means of
voting and influencing public opinion, etc., once those persons have agreed
on a course of political action that they think best. So 1 am sure that
we would all agree that it is of fundamental importance lhat we have
frequent non-partisan discussions on important political questions here
on the campus. Yet when a student reaches positive decisions on the.se
matters, should he not also have the right to go ahead and identify himself
with whatever group that actively promotes the conclusions which he
has reached.
I know that the answer which is often given is that "You can go to Palo
Alto if you want to join a political group." This reminds me of the
saying, "Go to Russia if you don't like something in America." Should
Stanford sidestep this political group issue? Or should a university be
a model of democratic action for the larger society of the state? Should
not our student body, which will later take an important place in society,
have experience in democratic action here at school?
