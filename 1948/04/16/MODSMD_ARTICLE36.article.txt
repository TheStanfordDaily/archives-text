# Can We Use Krupp?

To the Editor:
A hearty hurrah for Tom Brand's letter in defense of the Krupp trial
decisions.
After all, Krupp did no more than finance the Wehrmacht and the Nazi
Party. Heaven knows, we need people to finance things, and yes, we
can use Krupp now in our efforts to support capitalism and stop communism
iti Europe.
As to the charge that German industry conducted experiments on
humans and thus destroyed the experimentees, why, did Krupp go into
the laboratories. No, and again, no! It was his employees that did it.
So let me add my voice to Mr. Brand's in his warning to these
un-Americans, "Brunn and his ilk." We real Americans believe in
justice, and you Reds who think Krupp is guilty don't believe in justice.
Anyone who doesn't believe in justice should go back to Russia where
he came from.
