The Facts on EKl®
WASHINGTON (UP)—Facts and figures about the
Marshall Plan:
Ollicial name—European Recovery Program (ERP).
Where did it start? —Secretary of State George C.
Marshall . in a speech at Harvard University on June
5, 1947, suggested that the United States could help
Europe recover if Europe itself would formulate a
program and promise a maximum campaign of co
operative self help.
What nations in Europe are participating?— Great
Britain, Eire, France, Belgium, The Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland,
Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Austria,
plus the merged Anglo-American zone of Germany
and the French zone of Germany. Sixteen nations
plus Western Germany.
Which countries refused to participate?— Soviet
Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria,
Yugoslavia, Romania, and Finland.
Which country was not invited?— Franco Spain.
How did EHP get started?— After Marshall's speech,
the 16 nations met in Paris. They agreed upon a co
operative program of self-help and also agreed on
what help they would need from the United States.
Since then it has been up to the United States to
decide what it will do.
B'ollowing are the chief developments in what Mar
shall calls the most important foreign policy step in
American history:
1. Marshall made his suggestion at Harvard on
June 5, 1947.
2. British Foreign Minister Ei'nest Bevin and French
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault took the initiative
and invited Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov to Paris to consider the American offer.
Molotov walked out of the Paris conference,
rejecting the idea as an American plan to dominate
Europe.
4. Bevin and Bidault decided to go ahead without
Russia. They invited all the European countries ex
cept Spain to a conference. All except Russia and
her satellites attended and formed a committee of
European economic cooperation (CEEC).
5. The CEEC at (irst estimated European needs at
$29,000,000,000. Undersecretary of State William L.
Clayton persuaded CEEC to cut the figure to $22,-
400.000.000 —the figure that was presented to the
United States.
6. Meanwhile, in the United States the greatest
force of talent in history was mobilized by the gov
ernment to study the project. President Truman
set up a non-partisan committee of civilians under
Secretary of Commerce Averell Harriman to advise
on the limits within which the United States could
help Europe and in what form; an expert committee
under Secretary of Interior J. A. Krug to determine
the effects of the project on American national re
sources; and designated the President's council of
economic advisers to determine the impact of the
program on domestic economy.
7. The American committees all agreed that
within the range contemplated the United States
could assume the burden of a vast European recov
ery program.
8. The administration, under the leadership of the
State Department, began last fall to formulate the
detailed program for presentation to Congress. It fi
nally submitted its report and asked for a 4V4-year
program with an estimated $17,000,000,000 cost. It

proposed $6,800,000,000 for the first 15 months
plan starting April 1, 1947, and decreasing ai
each year thereafter.
9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committees
weeks of hearings, eliminated the 817,000,0
figure, leaving the over-all possible cost
and approved authorization of $5.300,000,000 f<
first 12 months.
10. Debate in the Senate started the administi
deadline—but the House committee still was
ing on it.
