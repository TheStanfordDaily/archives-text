Last quarter this column explained why the
versity had been unable to carry out any ext
road rehabilitation on campus. We wrote that '
ford is able to dispose of only the most critica
struction problems first and must let other net
repairs get by with temporary correction.

"Since road maintenance
is accomplished on a temi
basis . . . road wear anc
from 5,000 vehicles each day
factor for rapid street dete
tion."
Student and faculty car <
complain about excessive we
Itear cars undergo through,
tinuous bumping across w
decayed streets. The presen
look indicates that it will be
iyears before Farm roads 1

a thorough reconstruction.
Our current problem, then, is what are we
to do about it? The suggestion that I offer i
signed not as a solution to the situation but
incentive to discussion and ultimate action b
students themselves.
If the more than 4.000 private cars own
Stanford residents and students were to be as
one dollar per quarter, the total funds rai>
several years' time would be sufficient to r
Palm Drive or the road from the SAC Bv
past the stadium.
Along the same line, each year's $12,000 i
could be spent immediately on shorter stretc
street reconstruction, such as the road fro;
varsity tennis courts through the area past
Hall, and funds would still be large enoi
carry on a minor replacement project some
else on campus, such as the Alice-in-Wond
network around the postoffce.
This road fund would not displace mone;
being allocated by the University for current
maintenance. On the contrary, the fund woi
the gap for much-needed repairffs that a Uni
budget will be unable to finance even in th.
future.
I maintain that a quarterly assessment wo
less painful to Farm car drivers than the
road conditions are to vehicles and passengei
assessment plan such as the one outlined abo
be instituted legally and administratively. The
purpose must not be detained until that rail
comes along when labor and material prices c
Rather, the yearly sum would be destined f<
mediate improvements.
Think over this plan; I surely welcome sugg
and constructive criticisms. Talk it over with
car owners. Later in the quarter I will pre
summary of your opinion of this or any othe
rehabilitation plan.
