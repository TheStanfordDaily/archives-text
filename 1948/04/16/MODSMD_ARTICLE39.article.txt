Yesterday I heard a story about Stanford that's so
swell that I want to spread it around. Especially
nowadays, when the newspapers are so full of the
troubles in the world, I think a story of this kind
is. particularly fitting.
Many years ago the University hired a little old
man as a gardener. Of all the countless gardeners
at Stanford, the thing that made him stand out from
the others was his ready smile and twinkling eyes.
He was a lovable old codger, and the students took
him into their hearts. Many counted him as a
friend, and even went to him for advice when they
were troubled. So it was no uncommon sight to
see him in the center of a mixed group of laughing
students.
A man of his personality and talents could easily
have gotten a better job than that of a gardener.
Naturally, therefore, the students were curious to
know why he was satisfied with his station in life.
A select handful of his particular intimate learned
his story—and it's a testimony of their love for him
that at the time that this goes to press (he secret was
kept so well that not more than a round dozen ever
knew it.
Anyway, he had once been a successful banker in
some small town in Indiana. While he was still
quite young, and was well on the road to achieving
great things, his wife met an accidental death in
the home he had built for her. Ho was very much
in love with his wife, so it came as a double shock
to him when he was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Those who had once been his friends turned away
from him in horror at the deed he had supposedly
done. Grief-stricken, he could no longer bear to stay
in the town in which he had once known so much
joy. So, though caring nothing for death, he escaped
from jail one night. After that, in an effort to avoid
the law. he wandered around for several years, drift
ing steadily westward, until at last he came to accept
the job of gardener at Stanford.
