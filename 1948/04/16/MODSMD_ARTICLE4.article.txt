# Women Consider Council Revision
## 
### 
Revision of Women's Council
along lines of co-ordination, orien
tation, and area representation was
suggested to Women's Conference '
yesterday by Anne Heraty of Un
ion Residence.
Citing as her ultimate aim more
effective channels between Coun- j
cil, the judiciary committees in each
area (such as the Roble Committee |
of Five), and the women students. ;
Miss Heraty outlined these three i
parts of the revision:
1. CO-ORDINATION', to include
meetings of the chairmen of the ju
diciary committees in each area I
with Council once a week for the
first four weeks of the quarter, and i
then only when necessary.
2. ORIENTATION, which stipu- '
lates that the newly elected mem- j
bers of Council visit several Council i
meetings and at least one judiciary 1
committee meeting in each area be- j
fore taking office.
3. AREA REPRESENTATION, to
provide for one girl elected from
each of the four areas and one girl
elected at large.
In the case of Roble. a freshman
representative would be elected in !
winter quarter. Before that time.'l
the Rob!e representative would be i
from either the campus at large,
one of the Roble sponsors, or elect
ed from the largest living group on
campus.
MISS HERATY said that with
area representation women students
could achieve better communica- i
Lion with Council in presenting I
their problems. Other Conference |
members felt that it would help to :
get away from the awe of Council. }
which lessened the contact with the |
girls.
Council member June Selder was
against area representation and j
said that Council as a judiciary j
body is supposed to represent the
interests of all the girls, not the
interests of each particular group
like a legislative body.
Dot Dishon, another Council
member, said that it would be
hard to get enough good people to
run in each area—the best people
might all be in one area. There
were several disagreements.
The issue will be discussed in the
living groups Monday.
