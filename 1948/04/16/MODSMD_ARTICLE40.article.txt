# Flying Discs Are Here Again; Roble Hashers Experimenting
## 
### BY SHIRLEY ROGERS 
Secrets of the once-mysterious flying disc have now been divulged by
two Roble hashers.
These disc experiments were first noticed by winter quarter boathouse
okouts who reported extraordinary air activities centering from the
>ually quiet, well-parked road behind Roble.
' You see. the flying discs were really pie-tins," declared Bob Scapple

nd Brett Melendv. "but we could
"t share our knowledge with the
world until we had perfected our
pie-tinning techniques."'
"Pie-tinning is going to become
new national sport." said Scapple,
twisting a beautiful left-handed
-piral with a shiny pie-tin. "Can't
you just see the whole campus
:h rowing curves and double flips?"
PLANS HAVE ALREADY been
ompleted for the team to enter
:: o 1948 Olympics in their own
.xisonal pie-tin division. But the
■-.embers, managed by Stan Rede
•:er. still need a kind alumnus to
provide money for the uniforms
nc traveling expenses.
"Scap" brought the aerial sport
surreptitiously from Cal Tech in
the dark of last winter quarter. The

Pie-tinning enthusiasts will have
1 o choice of either an Eastern grin

or a Western grip, and of four
weights of tins: 100. 200. 300. or the
special typhoon model developed
for Stanford weather conditions.
"We found the weather so unre
liable here that we send up our
own weather balloons every day
before practice," they said.
Scapple and Melendy are now
working upon several new plastic
models and a special boomerang
model designed for one-man teams.
THE CLEVER TWIST, the tim

the techniques that distinguish an
amateur P-T-er from the profes
sional.
Now that they have perfected
their own tin flings to a fine point,
Scapp and Melendy feel the need
of competition. "We might start
with intramurals and then branch
Who knows? Pie - tinning might
become a major sport!"
The two hashers will give a tin
ning demonstration on the Roble
east lawn at 12:!>0 p.m. tomorrow on
the newly prepared infield. They
urge everyone to try out.
