## 
### 

A SIZEABLE AMOUNT of the two and a half
million dollars damage suffered hy Stanford Uni
versity when the earthquake struck April IS. 1906,
was the result of the destruction of the Stanford
Library. The building was constructed to replace
the eld Thomas Wei ton Stanford Library which is
row the Administration Building. All that remains
ia this picture is the *teel framework and expensive
glass dome. The library was awaiting finishing
touches when the earthquake hit. and was never
used. The damage was beyond repair, and the

structure was razed after standing for many months
as a reminder of the disaster.
The great dome and steel supports were un
harmed but their pendulum-like swaying com
pletely wrecked the rest of the building, leaving
students without a place to study.
Fortunately, fear of recurring shocks had kept
students and faculty members out of campus build
ings during the day. so the collapse of the library
and Quad buildings resulted in only two deaths
and few injuries.
