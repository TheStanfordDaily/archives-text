# Early Stanford Life Disrupted; Quad and Buildings Damaged

John Kieran didn't know the answer when they asked him on
Information Please.
"Which caused the most damage, the Chicago fire or the
San Francisco earthquake?"
One thousand three hundred and twenty-seven students of
Stanford University could have told him on April 18, 1906, as
some of them watched the unchecked fires in San Francisco
glow red in the evening sky.
They could have told him about the damage in San Francisco
but most of them were too concerned with their own immediate
safety.
The 1906 San Francisco earthquake that caught a sleeping
Stanford student body at 5:07 a.m. lasted only 47 seconds, but
killed two, injured six, and did 52,800,000 damage to University
buildings.
The two dead were Junius R. Hanna, located after a two-hour
search in the rubble of Encina, and Oito Gerdis. fireman at the
power house.
Gerdis, lauded at the time by President David Starr Jordan,
stuck to his job through the first tremors, and shut off Stanford's
electric power. He undoubtedly saved the University and its
students from even mo]e serious damage, but lost his own life
when killed by falling sections of a 100-foot smokestack.
Largest damage was done to the Memorial Church. The clock
tower of the church, which made the building stand over twice
as tall as it is now, collapsed. Concussion blew the north wall
of the church out into the quad and the works of the clock were
spewed along the fallen beams.
The museum building was wrecked, the entrance gales to
Palm drive were crumbled, the Library was razed, the Men's
Gym was destroyed — the entire campus stood back and looked
at its own demolition.
President Jordan dismissed classes for the semester and an
nounced that seniors well up on their work would be given auto
matic degrees. He urged students to help put departments back
in order.
Six men sleeping on the third floor of Encina were carried into
the basement by the collapse of a chimney through the roof.
The same thing happened to a Rcble girl who traveled from
the third floor to the first floor without leaving her bed.
Up along the Row the students fared better. The Chi Psi
house was shifted 10 feet where it folded like a used Dixie cup
and was reduced to rubble.
The average damage, however, was slight and one fraternity
house estimated its damage at 51.75. Damage was mostly to
personal property, including SAE's prized collection of beer
steins, valued at S2OO.
The Stanford Daily, then the Daily Palo Alto, went to press
as unconcernedly as possible. They produced a four-page paper,
all set by hand, which they circulated to the students, who by
then were living in tents and out of tents on the lawns in front
of the various living quarters.
Relief parties were organized on campus to serve in San Fran
cisco where unchecked fires raged for three days. Telegraph
service was established by filing through Reno and students and
faculty settled down to rebuilding Stanford University.
And it all happened 42 years ago Sunday—the greatest single
earthquake-fire disaster in the history of the United States.
