# Spartan Crew Pushes for Recognition
## Lack of Cash Hinders Team 
### BY LORRY LOKEY 
Some student organizations
show a lot of spunk to keep
:heir clubs active. But the prize
:or effort goes to the Stanford
Crew Association, a group of
40 or 50 men that meets Monday
through Friday at s:bo a.m. at the
Palo Alto Yacht Club for workouts.
Ever since a championship 1915
crew team placed second in the
\ orld famous Poughkeepsie Regat
ta, several score Farm students
have been plugging away for the
day when crew will be admitted
into the circle of letter sports with
U-niversif^ - recognition.
That 1915 team very nearly tied
i:p first place at Poughkeepsie, but
the shell's coxswain misjudged the
(istance to the finish line. Believing
the goal to be half a mile farther
than it was on the four-mile-stretch
the coxswain had his eight men
hold back their full power for the
f.nal yards. As a result, the Farm
lost the bacon by two scant feet.
WHILE OTHER exhausted college
teams were lifted from their shells,
Stanford's untiring nine turned their
shell around and rowed the four
miles back to the starting line. For
their outstanding showing in 1915.
Stanford crew teams have received
yearly invitations to the Poughkeep
sie event.
Those annual invitations to the
biggest event in the sport have gone
unfilled because the Farm associa
tion operates on a budget drawn up
from contributions and club dues.
The Stanford Athletic Council an
r.ually spikes the team's chances for
recognition and support because it
feels operating expense would ex
ceed the sport's value.
As the president of the California
Alumni Club stated last year, "Row
ing has always been an orphan at
every Western school, and it has
been only the dyed-in-the-wool
crew enthusiasts who have man
aged to keep it going."
STANFORD'S CREW association
operates on an annual budget under
$500. On such a sum this year,
Crew Captain Eob Setrakian pro
phesied. "our team this season
should handily cool the spark from
the USC. Oregon State College, and
S ,n Diego State outfits."
The association has a gocd varsity
team this year. The boys believe it
if- good enough to hand UCLA a
still scare—and the UCLA team has
university recognition and support to
the tune of $10,000 per year.
Setrakian outlined how the crew
could field a basic team on a $3,000
budget. For a maximum of 517.000
the association could turn out three
lop teams — varsity, jay vee, and
freshmen. That $17,000 could be
• pared down to a sizeable amount
without undermining the teams, he
said.
The Stanford Athletic Council has |
estimated that $35,000 is needed to
•r.aintain a first-class crew. But !
that sum includes elaborate equip- j
r.-.ent, coaching and traveling allow
ance.
CURRENT CREW equipment in
tiudes a boathouse. two new shells,
two older shells still in use, three
shells being reconditioned, one
raining scow, one coaching launch.

I Aside from their week-day work
j outs, the team puts in four hours
rowing Sunday mornings and after
noons and an hour on Friday after
noons.
The boys are given a break on
Saturdays when no workout trials
occur. But just to keep them in
j shape along with the equipment, Se
: trakian said the team puts in all
i day Saturday cleaning up and re
pairing the gear.
PROSPECTS FOR A TOP varsity
crew are optimistic. It takes two
'■ years to build a varsity team into
a winning outfit; this year's varsity
already has the earmarks of a win
ner. and when they return for meets

next year the team will be looking
at champions in their class.
Present varsity members in the
crew association are bow: Bob Ken
dall. Bob Scothorn, Andy Arnosti.
Jim Smith, Jim Brannaman, Cust
Carr, Norm Swanson; stroke, Ray
Haley; coxswain, John Dee.
Regattas slated by the Stanford
Crew Association this season include
an engagement with UCLA and San
Diego State on May 1 in a 2.000-
meter run; a meet with University
of California on May 8 over a 2.000-

meter course; a contest with Oregon
State College, and another with
'JSC.


TWO FARM COEDS christen the Stanford Crew
Association's newest shell, the "Cardinal" at cere
monies held last year at the Palo Alto Yacht Club.

Only two of the crew's shells arc new, while the
ttthcrs date back a number of years.
