# Bush Estimates Future Job Opportunities
## 
### BY AL McCOMBS 
Today, the United States is at its highest employment peak,
and soon the demand for labor will start to decline, predicts
Dr. Robert N. Bush, director of the Stanford Appointment Service.
Sixty million persons are available for employment at the pres
ent time. Between 54 and 55 million of these are being employed.

Dr. Bush gave the present huge
college enrollment throughout the
country aÂ» the reason that the de
mand for labor will be cut down
especially in about four years. In
the next few years, this great num
ber of students will descend upon
the labor market, causing a drop in
the number of open positions.
FIELDS IN WHICH the demand
for workers is most active are ac
counting. office work and office
management, sales, banking and fi
nance, insurance, retail merchandis
ing, engineering, chemistry and

I
physics, manufacturing, public serv
ice, teaching, jobs abroad, and medi
j cine.
The demand exceeds the number
j of trained people available, especially !
j in stenographic and secretarial work,
accounting chemistry, physics, en-
I gineering research, geology, and
teaching.
Fields in which there are more
candidates than opportunities are
personnel and industrial relations,
public relations, administration,
counseling and guidance in educa

tion, foreign trade and service, ra
dio, journalism, and advertising.
Requests for men for insurance are
well over the supply here at Stan
ford and will probably remain so
lor some time. This survey includes
sales, management, office work, sta
tistics, and other various jobs con
nected with the field.
The demand for engineering stu
dents has become greater in the last
I few years and is expected to reach
the peak by 1951.
By that year, a wide-open and !
still growing field is predicted for
both chemistry and physics. Excel
lent opportunities are open in the
field of biological sciences, espe
cially for those with Master's and
Ph.D. degrees.
MEDICINE IIAS EXPERIENCED
a shortage of workers for some time,
and the number of openings is*ex

pected to remain high. Psychiatric
physicians are needed badly.
The demand far exceeds the sup
ply in education. Well-trained
teachers and instructors are needed
m all fields. Salaries have gone up
within the last five years, and for
students leaving Stanford for the
! field, the average salaries are bet
ter than in business or engineering,
Dr. Bush stated. Although the high
est ppsitions do not pay as well
las in the business, there is more
j chance to advance.
For administrative education, the
! student is advised to teach for two
years, the usual requirement, before
getting some administrative train
ing.
IN GOVERNMENT and public
service, the demand is far greater
than the number of perons enter
ing the work.

The rise or decline in the need for
persons trained in law will depend
on the demand for legal services
in the future. More and more law
students are going into private busi
ness, big law firms, government jobs,
or salary positions instead of estab
lishing their own practices.
Jobs abroad are plentiful, but the
requirements are stiff. Employes
usually must be in excellent physical
condition, willing to sign up for sev
eral years, have a proficiency in
languages, and are preferred without
families. Most needed in this type of
work are specialists in the technical
fields of engineering, physics, and
chemistry.
HARI) COMPETITION ISVesent
in the vocations of journalism and
advertising, but a person who excels
has a good opportunity to get ahead.
