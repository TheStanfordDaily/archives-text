# Farm Baseballers to Meet Cal at Berkeley Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford baseballers go back to Berkeley tomorrow to meet the Bears j
foi a second time. The teams will get together at 2:150 p.m. on California s
Edwards Field.
Stanford's first effort against the defending champs resulted in a disap- j
pointing 7 to 3 setback, but since then Cal has dropped a game to Santa J

Clara and lost its undefeated lus
ter. Wet fields and weak hitting
also p'agued the Cards in that first
meeting, and they will be slight fa
vorites to reverse ihe decision this
HARRY WOLTEK will call on
either Frank Laßrum or Charlie
Bell tomorrow as he sends his men
after their third CIBA win. Both
Dave Stott and Dave Dahle were
used Tuesday night against Santa
Clara.
The Cards are holding onto a
fourth - place spot in conference
standings right now with a record
of two wins and three losses. A
victory over California would move
them up a notch to third place, and
would also bring them within
shooting distance of the Bears.
California gets most of its
strength from a hard-hitting out
field and one pitching ace, Nino
Barnise. Barnise set the Cards
down with only three hits in their
first meeting.
JOHN FISCALINI in left field.
Lyle Palmer in center field, and

seasonal low at .295. Other Card j
batsmen have started to bring their |
averages up a bit, but none have
yet reached . uOO.
STANFORD FIELDING contin
ues to be a strong point, although !
several errors were committed in
the Santa Clara game. The Indian
infield is rated heads and shoul- j
tiers above the Cal unit.
While the Cards and Bears are j
mixing it up this weekend, Santa
Clara will be meeting USC twice,
all of which could be very disas
trous to the recently improved
Broncos. USC leads CIBA compe
tition with one win (UCLA 13 to 0)
and no losses.

Cliff McLain in right field are all
power hitters, and form what Cali
fornians refer to as the "Terrific
Trio."
Stanford bats finally started to
warm tip against Santa Clara when
the varsity pounded out 11 base
hits. Whether they can go to work
on Barnise like that is another
question.
Bob Nava continues to lead Stan
ford batters, but has slipped to his

While the Cards and Bears are j
mixing it up this weekend, Santa

and no losses.

Stanford baseballers go back to Berkeley tomorrow to meet the Bears j
foi a second time. The teams will get together at 2:150 p.m. on California s
Edwards Field.
Stanford's first effort against the defending champs resulted in a disap- j
pointing 7 to 3 setback, but since then Cal has dropped a game to Santa J

Clara and lost its undefeated lus
ter. Wet fields and weak hitting
also p'agued the Cards in that first

HARRY WOLTEK will call on
either Frank Laßrum or Charlie
Bell tomorrow as he sends his men
after their third CIBA win. Both
Dave Stott and Dave Dahle were
used Tuesday night against Santa

The Cards are holding onto a
fourth - place spot in conference
standings right now with a record
of two wins and three losses. A
victory over California would move
them up a notch to third place, and
would also bring them within
shooting distance of the Bears.
California gets most of its
strength from a hard-hitting out
field and one pitching ace, Nino
Barnise. Barnise set the Cards
down with only three hits in their
first meeting.
