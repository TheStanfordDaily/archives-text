will wind up their season tomorrow
night when they meet the best teams
of the West Coast at Berkeley in
the Pacific Coast Championships.
The title meet promises to be an
exhibition of top-flight gymnastics
as UCLA's defending champions,
Southern Cal, Stanford and Cal
compete. The Cards have a better
than-average record to date, boast
ing four wins and one loss.
The oversupply of talent in some
events has always been offset by a
lack of reserve strength in others.

cap will have little effect.
The meet is being held in the
Men's Gym at Berkeley at 7:30 p.m.
The event will be open to the public,
