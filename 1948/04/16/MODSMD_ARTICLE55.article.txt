second game of their three - game
series. The game will be played on
Edwards Field at 10 a.m.
The first game played two weeks

a big part in the Cal win for pitch
er Jim Claypool lost his efTective

half-hour delay in the middle of
the game.

starting pitcher again by Coach
Charlie Bushong. Jim, who stop
ped San Mateo JC in 10 innings in
his last start, will be out to even
the score with Cal. To do so he

Dodson, who hit three for four in
the first, and hard - hitting center
fielder A 1 Davies.
