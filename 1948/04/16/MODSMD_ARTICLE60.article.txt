### 
Stanford's varsity golfers meet
, their first real test of the season
1 today as they travel down to San
Jose to take on the highly touted
Spartans at 1:30 p.m. The IS-hole
match will be played over the San
Jose Country Club course.
The Indians will be strengthened
by the return of Bob Rosburg to
the starting lineup. Rosburg has
just returned from Augusta. Ga.,
where he was competing in the
Masters tournament.
Coach Eddie Twiggs will choose
his starting lineup from this list of
men: Bob Rosburg, Bob Crozier,
Tom Lambie, Jack Shuler, Ernie
Kellberg, Bill Lowe, and Bud Moe.
The Spartans can boast such
well-known and capable golfers as
Bobby Harris and Ely Barriteau
and will hold a distinct advantage
playing on their home grounds.
Last year the Indians and San
Jose split a two-game series.
Stanford opened regular season
play last Saturday, downing an
alumni sextet, 16V2 to lOV2. Tom
Lambie, Bob Crozier, and Bud Moe
turned in good scores, Lambie
carding a par 71 in the singles
matches.
Warren Berl. Bud Edwards, and
Bob Thompson, famous Indian
golfers of past years, competed for
the alumni. Berl, a member of the
'39 and '41 national championship
squads, was particularly impres
sive. Berl was defeated by Lambie
in the singles but came back strong
>n +he afternoon doubles to fire par
golf.
Thompson, a doctor, was in the
operating room all night before the
match and played without having
had any sleep.
111 the Northern California In
tercollegiate tourney held at Santa
Cruz last month, the Farm golfers
took second-place honors, finishing
only two strokes behind winning
San Jose.
