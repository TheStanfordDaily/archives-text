# '51 Thinclads In Stiff Test
## 
### 
Matching strides with a horde o
speedburners from Modesto and
Stockton JC's. Stanford's yearling
1 spikemen take to the cinder paths
again tomorrow in what should be
i their stiflest test ul the season. The
j meet its scheduled to begin at Ift
a.m. at Angell Field.
COACH RAY DEAN predicts a
very busy morning for his men, in
asmuch as the Modesto and Stock
ton squads are among the strongest
JC aggregations in this area. The
• freshmen, as yet unextended in
j competition, have had only one
j meet so far, an easy 88-4.') pasting
of San Mateo JC March 5.
i Spring football and injuries have
given Dean cause for mourning al-
I ready, inasmuch as top sprinter
! John Holloway has turned his at
i tention to the gridiron and Drew
j Terramorse, ace half-miler, broke
! an ankle last week while rounding
| the track on soft ground.
JOHN ROBERTSON AND RON
NIE BUCK, both of whom have hit
10.3 in the 100. will carry the load
j in the sprints along with Errol
French. Stockton's Don Hardy,
! however, has already turned in a
| mark of 10 flat and should show his
spikes to the locals in the century.
With a time of 30.(j to his credit,
j Cass B!y heads the Indians' quar
ter-milers. Along with Bly, Joss
Scroggy, Hicks Williams, and Chuck
Trask combine to make the 440 the
team's strongest entry.
LAWRIE GORDON, who turned
in a 1:59.5 half-mile against San
Mateo, is the lone Card entry in
; the 880 and faces his greatest com
: petition in Stockton's Don Brunner.
whose best so far is 2:02.
George Mooers and Dv/ight Wil-
I bur carry local hopes in the dis-
I tance events, with Mooers entered
lin the mile and Wilbur in the two
i mile. Both men could score Satur
; day.
THE FEATURE OF THE HUR
DLES should be the 220 lows, with
j Stockton's Don Brooks running
i against Stanford's Bob Bryan. Both
I men have been timed around 25 flat
, so far, and can be counted upon to
[ cut down that time considerably.
Bill Nefl in the highs and Pete
Young along with Bryan in the
lows complete Dean's hurdle en
! tries. Young topped the sticks in
i 15.5 against San Mateo in the 120
j highs.
THE FIELD EVENTS loom as a
! toss-up. Either Dick Abraham, who
i has hit 42 ft. 7 in., or Stockton's
Duane Pitnam, with a 42 ft. 8 in.,
: could take the shot. Walt Ragland
I of Modesto, however, with a mark
of 6 ft. 4 in., will be in a class by
| himself in the high jump.
Bob Scott, who pitched the dis
cuss 133 feet against San Mateo,
will compete in that event along
i with Abraham and Terry Watters.
Merritt Van Sant, Bob Bryan, and
| Jerry Simpson, all of whom have
i leaped over 21 feet, complete the
i broad jump entries.

George Mooers and Dv/ight Wil-
I bur carry local hopes in the dis-
I tance events, with Mooers entered
lin the mile and Wilbur in the two
i mile. Both men could score Satur
; day.
THE FEATURE OF THE HUR
DLES should be the 220 lows, with
j Stockton's Don Brooks running
i against Stanford's Bob Bryan. Both
I men have been timed around 25 flat
, so far, and can be counted upon to
[ cut down that time considerably.
Bill Nefl in the highs and Pete
Young along with Bryan in the
lows complete Dean's hurdle en
! tries. Young topped the sticks in
i 15.5 against San Mateo in the 120
j highs.
THE FIELD EVENTS loom as a
! toss-up. Either Dick Abraham, who
i has hit 42 ft. 7 in., or Stockton's
Duane Pitnam, with a 42 ft. 8 in.,
: could take the shot. Walt Ragland
I of Modesto, however, with a mark
of 6 ft. 4 in., will be in a class by
| himself in the high jump.
Bob Scott, who pitched the dis
cuss 133 feet against San Mateo,
will compete in that event along
i with Abraham and Terry Watters.
Merritt Van Sant, Bob Bryan, and
| Jerry Simpson, all of whom have
i leaped over 21 feet, complete the
i broad jump entries.
Matching strides with a horde o
speedburners from Modesto and
Stockton JC's. Stanford's yearling
1 spikemen take to the cinder paths
again tomorrow in what should be
i their stiflest test ul the season. The
j meet its scheduled to begin at Ift
a.m. at Angell Field.
COACH RAY DEAN predicts a
very busy morning for his men, in
asmuch as the Modesto and Stock
ton squads are among the strongest
JC aggregations in this area. The
• freshmen, as yet unextended in
j competition, have had only one
j meet so far, an easy 88-4.') pasting
of San Mateo JC March 5.
i Spring football and injuries have
given Dean cause for mourning al-
I ready, inasmuch as top sprinter
! John Holloway has turned his at
i tention to the gridiron and Drew
j Terramorse, ace half-miler, broke
! an ankle last week while rounding
| the track on soft ground.
JOHN ROBERTSON AND RON
NIE BUCK, both of whom have hit
10.3 in the 100. will carry the load
j in the sprints along with Errol
French. Stockton's Don Hardy,
! however, has already turned in a
| mark of 10 flat and should show his
spikes to the locals in the century.
With a time of 30.(j to his credit,
j Cass B!y heads the Indians' quar
ter-milers. Along with Bly, Joss
Scroggy, Hicks Williams, and Chuck
Trask combine to make the 440 the
team's strongest entry.
LAWRIE GORDON, who turned
