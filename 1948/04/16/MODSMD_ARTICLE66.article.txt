If you are one of those students
who spend those beautiful Satur
day afternoons wondering what to
do, you could do a whole lot worse
than taking in the Stanford-Olym
pic Club track meet here at Stan
ford tomorrow. Starting time is
1:45.
For the true sports fan there will
be no keeping him or her away.
For the average Stanford student it
should not take long to make up
his mind—he should want to go.
ARE ON WAY BACK
For the first time in years Stan
ford has a track team that, to say
the least, should prove highly in
teresting.
Winners over the strong San.Jose
squad by a 70 to (51 score, the Card
cindermen have served notice that
they are well along on the long,
hard road of rebuilding to former
Stanford track glory.
The San Jose win was accom
plished on a home track before a
crowd of predominantly unsympa
thetic fans—namely San Jose stu
dents.
FANS LACKING
Every time a San Jose high
jumper would clear the bar he
would be rewarded with cheers
from his followers. When a Stan
ford man went up and over the
encouraging cheers were noticeably
less—and on a Stanford field.
Rebuilding a track team isn't
done overnight. It is a long, tough
grind. This year's Farm team is
for the most part made up of soph
miores.
This week that team goes up
against a club of veteran perform
ers, men to whom track and field
events are old proceedings. The in
expereincecl Indians will profit by
having a solid, partisan audience.
LONG TURNOUTS
Most of the traeksters have been
turning out since the beginning of
winter quarter, some since the
start of the school year. Such per
severance shouldn't go unrewarded.
This factor of backing a school
team should be only secondary to
the interest, selfish interest if you
will, of spending an enjoyable af
ternoon.
Last Tuesday, due to the shift of
the site of the meet from Angell
Field to the stadiiym, the public an
nouncing system was not set up.
Tomorrow the P.A. system will be
used with Don Liebendorfer.behind
the mike.
A San Francisco sports writer

wrote a very pood column last
Wednesday in which he noted the
lack of organization and policing at
most track meets. Perhaps we are
a bit prejudiced, but last Tuesday
the meet seemed to have been well
carried out. There was no great lag
in the proceedings and the close
score throughout kept interest at a
peak.
As for the policing of the track,
it is true that the center of the
stadium was crowded and that in
some events it was very hard to
tell just who was entered in the
event and who were the onlookers
and judges.
A call to Liebendorfer's office re
vealed that to run a track meet the
like of the San Jose tilt, some 35
officials are needed. Many of these
double up in events.
The greatest violators of the
"keep the center cleared" law are
the athletes themselves. In a close
meet they just naturally gather
around their fellow contestants to
see how things are coming along.
This can be remedied ii the officials
see that the athletes keep to the
areas assigned them.
BLUE. GOLD. JACK
An interesting sidelight to the
Tuesday meet was that Stanford
Coach Jack Weiershauser carried a
blue and gold megaphone the like
of which a certain clothing concern
furnished Indian football fans.
Coach Jack explains it thusly:
''My boys don't like to get hol
lered at anyway, and when I hold
this blue and gold job up. or wave
it in front of the. they just natu
rally get fired up and win."
"Besides that." he added, "its re
minds them that we have a score
to settle about May S."
COME TO SCRUM
With that we'll end this spiel and
head out to watch football prac
tice. Marchmont is getting his boys
ready for a tough scrimmage Sat
urday morning. The scrum starts
about 10 a.m. Those interested 'in
getting a preview of the Big Ked
Machine can wander out to the
rugby field about that time and
take in the play.
Marchie has alwayg invited, and
wanted, the students and faculty to
come out. It's free.

Rebuilding a track team isn't
done overnight. It is a long, tough
grind. This year's Farm team is
for the most part made up of soph
miores.
This week that team goes up
against a club of veteran perform
ers, men to whom track and field
events are old proceedings. The in
expereincecl Indians will profit by
having a solid, partisan audience.
LONG TURNOUTS
Most of the traeksters have been
turning out since the beginning of
winter quarter, some since the
start of the school year. Such per
severance shouldn't go unrewarded.
This factor of backing a school
team should be only secondary to
the interest, selfish interest if you
will, of spending an enjoyable af
ternoon.
Last Tuesday, due to the shift of
the site of the meet from Angell
Field to the stadiiym, the public an
nouncing system was not set up.
Tomorrow the P.A. system will be
used with Don Liebendorfer.behind
the mike.
A San Francisco sports writer

wrote a very pood column last
Wednesday in which he noted the
lack of organization and policing at
most track meets. Perhaps we are
a bit prejudiced, but last Tuesday
the meet seemed to have been well
carried out. There was no great lag
in the proceedings and the close
score throughout kept interest at a
peak.
As for the policing of the track,
it is true that the center of the
stadium was crowded and that in
some events it was very hard to
tell just who was entered in the
event and who were the onlookers
and judges.
A call to Liebendorfer's office re
vealed that to run a track meet the
like of the San Jose tilt, some 35
officials are needed. Many of these
double up in events.
The greatest violators of the
"keep the center cleared" law are
the athletes themselves. In a close
meet they just naturally gather
around their fellow contestants to
see how things are coming along.
This can be remedied ii the officials
see that the athletes keep to the
areas assigned them.
BLUE. GOLD. JACK
An interesting sidelight to the
Tuesday meet was that Stanford
Coach Jack Weiershauser carried a
blue and gold megaphone the like
of which a certain clothing concern
furnished Indian football fans.
Coach Jack explains it thusly:
''My boys don't like to get hol
lered at anyway, and when I hold
this blue and gold job up. or wave
it in front of the. they just natu
rally get fired up and win."
"Besides that." he added, "its re
minds them that we have a score
to settle about May S."
COME TO SCRUM
With that we'll end this spiel and
head out to watch football prac
tice. Marchmont is getting his boys
ready for a tough scrimmage Sat
urday morning. The scrum starts
about 10 a.m. Those interested 'in
getting a preview of the Big Ked
Machine can wander out to the
rugby field about that time and
take in the play.
Marchie has alwayg invited, and
wanted, the students and faculty to
come out. It's free.
If you are one of those students
who spend those beautiful Satur
day afternoons wondering what to
do, you could do a whole lot worse
than taking in the Stanford-Olym
pic Club track meet here at Stan
ford tomorrow. Starting time is
1:45.
For the true sports fan there will
be no keeping him or her away.
For the average Stanford student it
should not take long to make up
his mind—he should want to go.
ARE ON WAY BACK
For the first time in years Stan
ford has a track team that, to say
the least, should prove highly in
teresting.
Winners over the strong San.Jose
squad by a 70 to (51 score, the Card
cindermen have served notice that
they are well along on the long,
hard road of rebuilding to former
Stanford track glory.
The San Jose win was accom
plished on a home track before a
crowd of predominantly unsympa
thetic fans—namely San Jose stu
dents.

Tomorrow the P.A. system will be
used with Don Liebendorfer.behind
the mike.
A San Francisco sports writer

wrote a very pood column last
Wednesday in which he noted the
lack of organization and policing at
most track meets. Perhaps we are
a bit prejudiced, but last Tuesday
the meet seemed to have been well
carried out. There was no great lag
in the proceedings and the close
score throughout kept interest at a
peak.
As for the policing of the track,
it is true that the center of the
stadium was crowded and that in
some events it was very hard to
tell just who was entered in the
event and who were the onlookers
and judges.
A call to Liebendorfer's office re
vealed that to run a track meet the
like of the San Jose tilt, some 35
officials are needed. Many of these
double up in events.
The greatest violators of the
"keep the center cleared" law are
the athletes themselves. In a close
meet they just naturally gather
around their fellow contestants to
see how things are coming along.
This can be remedied ii the officials
see that the athletes keep to the
areas assigned them.
BLUE. GOLD. JACK
An interesting sidelight to the
Tuesday meet was that Stanford
Coach Jack Weiershauser carried a
blue and gold megaphone the like
of which a certain clothing concern
furnished Indian football fans.
Coach Jack explains it thusly:
''My boys don't like to get hol
lered at anyway, and when I hold
this blue and gold job up. or wave
it in front of the. they just natu
rally get fired up and win."
"Besides that." he added, "its re
minds them that we have a score
to settle about May S."
COME TO SCRUM
With that we'll end this spiel and
head out to watch football prac
tice. Marchmont is getting his boys
ready for a tough scrimmage Sat
urday morning. The scrum starts
about 10 a.m. Those interested 'in
getting a preview of the Big Ked
Machine can wander out to the
rugby field about that time and
take in the play.
Marchie has alwayg invited, and
wanted, the students and faculty to
come out. It's free.
