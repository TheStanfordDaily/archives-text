# Leaders Dispute Scholarship Plan
## 
### BY BOB COATE TOM MARTZLOFF 
There are two points concerning the Foreign Scholarship Plan which
must be made clear immediately.
Thi> first is the incomplete financial picture given by Martzloff in
Wednesday's Daily. He used the arguments "...95.4 per cent of all
available funds... and"....95.4 per cent of all our resources." The

truth is that the plan involves budg
eting 79 per cent of current excesses
and 27 per cent of all available
funds.
Here is the way the figures ac
tually add up; these may be checked
at any time in the ASSU office.
Using at first only the current op
erating expenses, we have:
Current excess $12,985
Desired commitments ... 1,500
Recommended reserve .. 2.000
Thus, budgeting $9,050 leaves the
$2,000 plus $435 as reserve. We have
budgeted 79 per cent of our current
excesses.
THIS IS JI'ST a part of the pic
lure. What of the"...all available
funds . . .?" Exactly what per
centage of our immediately avail
able funds does this $9,050 repre
sent?
Balance on hand ....$22,056.00
Current excess 12,985.31
Committed funds -1,500.00
Total available funds 33,541.31
Thus, $9,050 actually represents
11 per cent of all available funds.
The second point is to show clearly
die stand of the ASSU government,
so it will be understood that Martz
loff is presenting a personal opinion
and not speaking for the student
body representatives on Excom.
AT WEDNESDAY'S MEETING; a
questionnaire having this statement
was distributed: "My stand now is
j,for . against ) the plan as
proponed. Here are the results:
Tom Armstrong—for
Bob Brown—for
Gus Chavalas—against
Ken Croft—for
Jose deLarios—for
B. J. Denning—for
Alison Dice—against
Joyce Graybiel—against
Tom Martzloff—against
Gordon Ness —for
Ted Norton—for
Guy la Runyon—for
Ginny Titus —for
Tom Wood—for
THE FOUR VOTING against the
plan have indicated that they would
favor a modified proposal. Three of
those voting in favor would prefer
a higher expenditure.
These are the facts. Check them in
the ASSU office or with your Excom
representative. The $9,050 was
passed as a reasonable investment
of a part of our money in a time
when such investments by American
students are desperately needed.

59.050 of your money is at
stake in next V/ednesdav's
election. Whether or not you
will spend it on 10 foreign stu
dent scholarships this year is

| up to you.
Though approving the princip'e
behind the plan, my responsibility
for sound administration of your
affairs leaves me no alternative but
to urge the plan's rejection, while
favoring the adoption oi' a smaller
scale proposal.
IT IS I'POX these indisputable
facts that I base my stand. These
same facts are available to Excom.
What is your opinion?
A
1. This year we may expect a
current excess of 512.985.31.
2. Definite obligations (listed on
Wednesday) to be met total 51,500.
3. Student manager recommends,
as intelligent business practice, set
ting aside a minimum of $2,000 for
reserves and unforeseen expenses.
4. The remainder, 59.485.31, must
! cover all further considered ex
penses to be incurred this year:
e.g., Tresidder Memorial, Student
Union contributions, etc.
5. Present ballot proposal would
consume 95.4 per cent of these re
maining funds.
B
1- THE ASSU has maintained a
reserve surplus for 21 years, apart
from current funds.
2. This year it totals $22,056.
3. At no time have any funds
ever been removed from this re
serve to finance curren operating
deficits.
4. Five times since 1923 this re
serve has been delved into: four
I times to reduce high interest-bear
-1 ing notes, and once to set up an
endowment fund.
If this precedent and the addi
tional advice of two qualified Uni
versity administrators, the ASSU
bookkeeper, and several Excom
I members is to be heeded, we will
I continue to consider only our cur
-1 rent excess when determining whe

ther this $9,030 proposal is a wise
expenditure this year.
1 REITERATE my contention I
that by far the greatest value of i
this plan lies in "showing the way" j
to other universities; for only then i
will the number of foreign student j
scholarships reach such proportions
as to influence thought in foreign
countries. Is it wise to spend 95.4
per .cent ot our recommended ex- j
cess when the principal value can \
be achieved with a more moderate [
expenditure? Will you gamble so |

Any off-campus student desir
ing information about the foreign
scholarship plan should go to the
ASSI' president's office Thurs
days, It) a.m. to 11 and Fridays,
11 a.m. to noon.

greatly on an untried and unproven
plan when a lesser expenditure will
equally well establish its merit?
Therefore I urge that you:
1. Vote NO on this $9,050 ballot
proposal, and in addition indicate
if you favor a modified plan.
2. Advise your Excom represen
tative of your desire regarding
modification.
3. Formulate and circulate peti
tions expressing your wishes re
garding this modification.
