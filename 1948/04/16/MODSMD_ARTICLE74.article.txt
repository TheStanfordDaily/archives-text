### 
Alvin Colder, cost comptroller for
Libby, McNeil, and Libby in Sunny
vale, addressed a seminar in indus
trial engineering yesterday in which
he stressed the need for extra-cur
ricular activities while in college.
"A man who has participated in
extra-curricular activities," Colder
said, "is more fitted for his job
when he finishes college because he
will have had the experience of
meeting people. It takes a great
many years to acquire the knack ol
getting a'.ong with people. It is best
to begin this in college."
This parallel is expressed in an
editorial printed in The Daily two
weeks ago. The foUowing is a quo
tation from that editorial:
"Activities are just as import
ant as textbooks. There is little
room in the world for hermits.
Hence the science of organization
and getting along with people is
important for college graduates.
The types of jobs they'll have will
require a lot of it."
