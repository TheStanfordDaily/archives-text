The women's and
children's tcear
industries place
a high value on
MANPOWER
These industries, wit#, textiles and men's wear, em
ployed 2,395,000 workers in 19-47 ... more than the
total for the automobile, electric machinery, chemical
and allied products, tobacco, petroleum products and
coal industries combined!*
With so vast a payroll, it is not surprising that the
women's and children's wear industries should be en
gaged in an endless quest for new ideas and business
building techniques.
