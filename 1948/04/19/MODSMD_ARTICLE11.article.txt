# Lewis Faces Court Today For Judgment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 18 (UP).â€”
Beaten in a last-minute move to
kil! the government's case against
him, John L. Lewis returns to fed
eral court tomorrow to be judged
for contempt.
Federal Judge T. Alan Goldsbor
ough, Lewis' old nemesis, has
promised to rule then whether the
United Mine Workers' president
and his union defied an injunction
by waiting nine days before calling
off the soft coal strike.
IF LEWIS AND THE UNION are
found guilty, Justice Department
officials are ready to propose stiff
penalties, but they won't say how
stiff.
The union can be fined only. But
the shaggy-browed Lewis could be
sent to jail and fined, at the discre
tion of Goldsborough.
TIIE CASE AGAINST LEWIS
involves civil as well as criminal
contempt. This means that Golds
borough could order Lewis to take
further steps to get still - striking
miners back to work, and could im
pose a heavy fine for each day's
violation of his order.
It is possible Lewis may get off
easy, if he is not acquitted. Golds
borough indicated when the mine
leader's trial ended that he did not
consider this case as serious as last
year's when he fined Lewis and the
union $3,510,000 for not calling off
the 194(i strike. Those fines later
were reduced to $710,000.
