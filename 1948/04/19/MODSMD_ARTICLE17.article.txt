MARSEILLE. France, April 18
! (UP). —Republican security guards
! swinging their night sticks charged
1 and broke up crowds of husky
Communist youths who swarmed
into the old port tonight after Gen.
I Charles de Gaulle spoke to a crowd
; of 100.000.
Defying a no-violence pledge, the
Communists invaded the water
front, marching abreast and singing
i the "Internationale." Republican
, guards charged the Communists
j and scattered them. They re-formed
and again their ranks were broken.
This was repeated again and again.
COMMUNISTS AND DeGaul
lists clashed briefly in front of the
i Hotel Larbois, headquarters for De
, Gaulle's Rally of the French People
(RPF). which has ended a three
day national convention here.
The disorder was quelled swiftly
! by police.
By 8 p.m. Marseille was entirely
1 calm. Police and republican secu
rity guards still patrolled the
' streets, however.
COMMUNISTS AND DeGaul
lists both held rallies this afternoon
> at the same time but in different
j spots. Ten thousand armed troops.
> security guards, and police formed
a so'id wall, separating the two
demonstrations until after the RPF
| meeting had ended.
De Gaulle, speaking on the water
| front, charged that Russia seeks to
. dominate the world. He called on
i France and America to organize
; free Europe into a military and
economic unit to halt Soviet ex
| pansion.
Do Gaulle aetain demanded an
1 early national election and an all—
| party coalition government.
