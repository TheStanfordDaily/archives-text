Deep Down Definitions
There's COMFORT isuch a subtle
thing' :
The warmth a fireplace can bring;,
A drunkard's nap upon the floor,
The sound of rain against the
door.
DECEIT it is where nothing was,
Or walking as the panther does,
As drinking fiom an empty cup.
Or pointing down while iooking
up.
And FRIENDSHIP is a vulcan
state,
The ringing forge, the welded
plate.
An endiess chain of h'nk to link,
The ratio of pen to ink.
But LOVE is an eternal glow

That's set to music, soft and low
A supple reed, yet never bends.
The osjlden road that never ends.
