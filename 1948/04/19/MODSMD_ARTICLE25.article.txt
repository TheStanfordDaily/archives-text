## Political Pranks 
### 
A Frenchman by the name of Voltaire once said that although
he may not agree with one word a man might say, he
would defend to the death that man's right to say it. Evidently
someone in the Palo Alto area does not believe in such a creed;
rather, he would just as soon see chaos reign as to let the other
guy voice opposition.
Friday night a number of Farm students and faculty mem
bers gathered at the Palo Alto Community Center under the
auspices of Students for Wallace to hear a political discussion.
During the program one hot-headed individualist tossed two
cherry bombs onto the speaker's platform.
Though Hitler won elections by demoralizing opposition with
murderous grenades, it won't work here. Petty party pranks
designed to create confusian in one group by another group
only serve to inflame the attacked to oratorical defense and
martyrdom in this country.
Force by one group signifies admitted defeat by the attackers
in intelligence, oratory, and leadership. It signifies a hot
headed instability that no average American would support.
We are not accusing other students of the attack; that is not
the point of this criticism. Instead, we believe it is a crying
shame to see democracy flicker in a place where it should be
bolstered. â€”Lorry Lokey.
