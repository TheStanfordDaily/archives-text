# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						Truth Is... 
### 
To the Editor:
Some unhappy defeatist who must have personal reasons for wanting
to obstruct the foleign scholarship plan has created some erroneous be
liefs as to what the plan is.
As examples: He has told the Turkish students that those nominated
would be Christians, the liberal minded students that it would be limited
t'j Nazi sympathizers, freshmen that only graduate students could apply,
and others that only Gentiles would be considered. All are untrue.
The only limitations are:
1. That the candidates be student leaders, so that their influence with
us and on their return will be as meaningful as possible.
2. That they be from Europe.
(a) In order that we may add to the few (approximately 14) Eu
ropeans here now, and
(b) Because other universities, who are not so lucky in having as
many people as we from the Near and Far East, will cover those areas
in the near future, and
(c) Because the American story is most crucially weak in Europe.
The number of women students must necessarily be limited by the
number of accommodations volunteered by women's living groups; but
otherwise, these are the only limitations that exist in the minds of the
Foreign Scholarship Committee.
