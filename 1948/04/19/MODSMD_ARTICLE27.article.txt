To the Editor:
In his writings in The Daily, MartzlofT has based his opposition to the
Foreign Scholarship Plan on his opinion lhat a modified plan would be
better. He has failed to state his proposed modifications exactly, but he
has intimated that he might favor a plan of bringing less than 10 students.
We on the Executive Committee who favor the plan would like to
state why 10 is the optimum number and why we voted 11 to 2 in favor
of bring 10 students, rather than 6 or 14.
1. Several of the members favored bringing more than 10.
2. Campus living groups have already offered a year's room and board
for 13 students.
3. The University will pay the tuition of each student whose tuition is
matched by the ASSU for another student—up to five. This would make
a total five paid for by the University and five paid for by the ASSU.
Therefore, the number 10 was chosen as a settlement between those who
favored more and (hose who favored less and (most important) as the
optimum number which would take full advantage of the University's
offer.
