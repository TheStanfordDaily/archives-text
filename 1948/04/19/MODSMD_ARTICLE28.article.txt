# No Choice—and Why

To the Editor:
With regard to the controversy over the Foreign Scholarship Plan, I'd
like to put a little more information before the student body about the
Executive Committee's action on the plan, just to get the record straight.
Let me say that I write solely as an Excom member.
The Executive Committee has been discussing the plan since early in
the fall quarter. We have debated all of the facts and points of view
now being argued by Coate and Martzloff and we have gone over
them more than once. With full knowledge of the facts, Excom voted to
approve the plan as proposed. Some of us, however, felt the matter was
too big to be decided by Excom alone, so ASSU approval was made sub
ject to a vote of the student body.
Excom considered but rejected (with the consent of the Foreign Schol
arship Committee) proposals to put a choice of several versions of the
plan on the ballot—principally, I think, for the reason that the more
(hoices there were, the less definite and accurate the expression of student
opinion would be.
