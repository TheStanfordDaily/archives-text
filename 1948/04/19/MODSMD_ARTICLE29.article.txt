Far Eastern Study Expands
ITHACA. N. Y., April 19 —Far Eastern study pro
grams are expanding at an unprecedented rate in
colleges and universities of the United States under
the impetus of a "virtual revolution" in the field
which resulted from American participation in the
Pacific war, according to an authority on East Asiatic
culture.
Writing in the current issue of The Far Eastern
Quarterly, published at Cornell University, Dr.
Meribeth R. Cameron declares that "no other area
of study was as sharply and deeply affected" by the
war. Today, the article asserts. Far Eastern studies
are flourishing in 13 "primary centers" at U. S.
colleges and universities and in 43 secondary cen
ters. Some 75 other institutions are offering more
limited programs.
The primary centers are listed as University of
California, Berkeley; Associated Colleges of Clare
mont (Calif.); University of California, Los Angeles;
Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale uni
versities, and the Universities of Chicago, Hawaii,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Washington (Seattle).
Dr. Cameron, professor of history and dean of
Milwaukee-Downer College, Milwaukee, asserts
that the study of Eastern Asia has progressed from
a "marginal" position in American education before
Pearl Harbor. "Each crisis in the Far East such
as the Manchurian incident, increased interest, but
the development of Far Eastern studies in the
United States had been unimpressive."
Surveys indicated, Dr. Cameron writes, that neglect
of the field was widespread on all educational levels
before the war and that less than half of the recog
nized American universities offered even a single
course primarily concerned with the Far East. "The
college instructor who essayed to give a course on the
Far East had somehow to operate on the kindergarten
and college levels at once."
In contrast, the study of Eastern Asia enters
upon the postwar period with many assets, the Far
Eastern Association's publication asserts. The task
of carrying the Far East into elementary and high
school curricula, undertaken before the war, was
advanced during the war years by such groups as
the American Council on Education, the American
Association of Teachers' Colleges, the U. S. OHice
of Education, and the American Institute of Pa
cific Relations.
Other spurs included the wartime language pro
grams of army and navy. Among new developments
are the expansion of grants in the field from agencies
such as the Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Foun
dation. and the Fulbright Act, authorizing the State
Department to use proceeds of sale of surplus prop
erty abroad for purposes of educational interchange
and activities with foreign countries.
The historian noted a trend toward the establish
ment of "area" programs, centering in the acquisi
tion of knowledge of a region rather than in the
mastery of a single "discipline" such as anthro
pology or history. She added that many of the
new regional programs will include study of the
Soviet Union as a Far Eastern power.
"In due course of time," Dr. Cameron concluded,
"the study of Eastern Asia may produce an abundant
yield of scholars of high quality."

and activities with foreign countries.
The historian noted a trend toward the establish
ment of "area" programs, centering in the acquisi
tion of knowledge of a region rather than in the
mastery of a single "discipline" such as anthro
pology or history. She added that many of the
new regional programs will include study of the
Soviet Union as a Far Eastern power.
"In due course of time," Dr. Cameron concluded,
"the study of Eastern Asia may produce an abundant
yield of scholars of high quality."
Far Eastern Study Expands
ITHACA. N. Y., April 19 —Far Eastern study pro
grams are expanding at an unprecedented rate in
colleges and universities of the United States under
the impetus of a "virtual revolution" in the field
which resulted from American participation in the
Pacific war, according to an authority on East Asiatic
culture.
Writing in the current issue of The Far Eastern
Quarterly, published at Cornell University, Dr.
Meribeth R. Cameron declares that "no other area
of study was as sharply and deeply affected" by the
war. Today, the article asserts. Far Eastern studies
are flourishing in 13 "primary centers" at U. S.
colleges and universities and in 43 secondary cen
ters. Some 75 other institutions are offering more
limited programs.
The primary centers are listed as University of
California, Berkeley; Associated Colleges of Clare
mont (Calif.); University of California, Los Angeles;
Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale uni
versities, and the Universities of Chicago, Hawaii,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Washington (Seattle).
Dr. Cameron, professor of history and dean of
Milwaukee-Downer College, Milwaukee, asserts
that the study of Eastern Asia has progressed from
a "marginal" position in American education before
Pearl Harbor. "Each crisis in the Far East such
as the Manchurian incident, increased interest, but
the development of Far Eastern studies in the
United States had been unimpressive."
Surveys indicated, Dr. Cameron writes, that neglect
of the field was widespread on all educational levels
before the war and that less than half of the recog
nized American universities offered even a single
course primarily concerned with the Far East. "The
college instructor who essayed to give a course on the
Far East had somehow to operate on the kindergarten
and college levels at once."
In contrast, the study of Eastern Asia enters
upon the postwar period with many assets, the Far
Eastern Association's publication asserts. The task
of carrying the Far East into elementary and high
school curricula, undertaken before the war, was
advanced during the war years by such groups as
the American Council on Education, the American
Association of Teachers' Colleges, the U. S. OHice
of Education, and the American Institute of Pa
cific Relations.
Other spurs included the wartime language pro
grams of army and navy. Among new developments
are the expansion of grants in the field from agencies
such as the Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Foun
dation. and the Fulbright Act, authorizing the State
Department to use proceeds of sale of surplus prop
erty abroad for purposes of educational interchange
and activities with foreign countries.
