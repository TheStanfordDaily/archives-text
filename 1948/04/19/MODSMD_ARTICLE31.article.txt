## History 1948 
### 
The last 14 top Nazi military men in United States
hands who led the German armies on their bloody
march through Europe have now been indicted at
Nuremberg. They bring to 134 the total of individual
defendants accused in the war trials there of crimes
against humanity.

Of the four counts of the indict
ment there are two open to
some question in international law;
those alleging crimes against peace,
and conspiracy. The defense prob
ably will be made that military
men do not formulate policy, they
only carry it out. That is the con
ception of military leadership in
his country.
The military assumes command
only when decision to make war

has been taken by elected civilian
leaders. The German generals and admirals could
say they were only following world practice when
they moved against Czechoslovakia and Austria, and
when they attacked without warning across the
Polish, Norwegian, and Russian borders. Hitler made
the decisions; they only obeyed orders.
The other two counts of the indictment are the
important ones in this instance: that they committed
war crimes against humanity, and that they ordered
plunder, spoliation, and wanton destructions not jus
tified by military necessity. Although there may be
individual exceptions, the record is clear on these
two counts against the great majority of German
generals. Troops under their command committed
excesses that shocked the world.
Practically every rule of so-called civilized warfare
was violated by the German armies, as it was by
the Japanese. The crimes were the more shocking as
committed by the Germans because they had been
raised in the moral atmosphere of the West, which
is based on the dignity of the individual.
There are those who will say that no warfare is
civilized; that it is only legalized murder. That is
the ultimate of cynicism. Would they say, for in
stance, that the people of Europe were not justified in
opposing Hitler or that the United States should
have accepted without answer the attack on Pearl
Harbor and the Philippines?
As long as the world is organized as it is now, by
national groups, there will always be the possibility
of war. Men of good-will have accepted this fact, re
pugnant as it is, and they have attempted to develop
a code governing such decisions by arms. That is
the code which the Germans and the Japanese vio
lated and for which they are now being brought to
trial. Every detail of it was familiar to the German
officer corps.
It is difficult to see what defense they can offer.
A defense that they were only obeying orders from
higher authority is not good enough. There is a line
beyond which a civilized military man cannot go.
The indictment is that these 14 did cross that line.
We all hope that the trials are fair in every way,
but that the sentence of guilty will be tailored to
fit the crime.

We all hope that the trials are fair in every way,
but that the sentence of guilty will be tailored to
fit the crime.

The last 14 top Nazi military men in United States
hands who led the German armies on their bloody
march through Europe have now been indicted at
Nuremberg. They bring to 134 the total of individual
defendants accused in the war trials there of crimes
against humanity.

Of the four counts of the indict
ment there are two open to
some question in international law;
those alleging crimes against peace,
and conspiracy. The defense prob
ably will be made that military
men do not formulate policy, they
only carry it out. That is the con
ception of military leadership in
his country.
The military assumes command
only when decision to make war

has been taken by elected civilian
leaders. The German generals and admirals could
say they were only following world practice when
they moved against Czechoslovakia and Austria, and
when they attacked without warning across the
Polish, Norwegian, and Russian borders. Hitler made
the decisions; they only obeyed orders.
The other two counts of the indictment are the
important ones in this instance: that they committed
war crimes against humanity, and that they ordered
plunder, spoliation, and wanton destructions not jus
tified by military necessity. Although there may be
individual exceptions, the record is clear on these
two counts against the great majority of German
generals. Troops under their command committed
excesses that shocked the world.
Practically every rule of so-called civilized warfare
was violated by the German armies, as it was by
the Japanese. The crimes were the more shocking as
committed by the Germans because they had been
raised in the moral atmosphere of the West, which
is based on the dignity of the individual.
There are those who will say that no warfare is
civilized; that it is only legalized murder. That is
the ultimate of cynicism. Would they say, for in
stance, that the people of Europe were not justified in
opposing Hitler or that the United States should
have accepted without answer the attack on Pearl
Harbor and the Philippines?
As long as the world is organized as it is now, by
national groups, there will always be the possibility
of war. Men of good-will have accepted this fact, re
pugnant as it is, and they have attempted to develop
a code governing such decisions by arms. That is
the code which the Germans and the Japanese vio
lated and for which they are now being brought to
trial. Every detail of it was familiar to the German
officer corps.
It is difficult to see what defense they can offer.
A defense that they were only obeying orders from
higher authority is not good enough. There is a line
beyond which a civilized military man cannot go.
The indictment is that these 14 did cross that line.
We all hope that the trials are fair in every way,
but that the sentence of guilty will be tailored to
fit the crime.
