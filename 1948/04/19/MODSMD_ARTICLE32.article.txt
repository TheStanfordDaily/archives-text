# Difficulties Await Moon Explorers

WASHINGTON. D. C. — "The moon belongs to
everyone" is the gist of what the Department of In
terior has to say to enterprising individuals who bob
up from time to time seeking title to acreage on the
celestial body which the nursery rhyme cow jumped
over.
Sewickley, Pa., is the earthly residence of two of the
latest applicants for official permission to stake out
a land claim on the man-in-the-moon's face. The In
terior Department gave them no encouragement.
But there'll conic a day. say the interplanetary -
minded, when some earthly explorer will rocket
outward and assert on-the-spot title to a choice
moon manor. Thereup. problems of moon owner
ship and sovereignty will become much more real.
How soon could this happen? Not very soon, ven
tures the National Geographic Society, coming up
with some facts that would be ;n the lunar Columbus'
ken.
The moon, traveling its elliptical orbit around the
earth every four weeks (27.3) days, averages 238,900
miles distant—about 30 times the earth's diameter.
If such factors are the earth's gravitational pull
and its course around the sun could he ignored, a
super-spaceliner might set a straight-line course
for where (he moon rides tonight. Holding an
average speed of 175 miles an hour, it would meet
the moon eight weeks from now on the moon's
second return to tonight's position.
But, as rocket experiments prove, gravity cannot
be disregarded. So far, man has not succeeded in
sending any sort of projectile out beyond the gravi
tational pull.
Jet planes are on the verge of speeds faster than
sound—one-fifth of a mile per second. By contrast,
a moonhound jet. in order to escape into free space,
would have to zoom forth at nearly seven miles a
second—24.ooo miles per hour. Even at this fan
tastic speed, it would take 10 hours to reach the
moon, and a huge ship would be required to carry

the enormous quantity of fuel needed for the flight.
Approaching the satellite, new problems would
arise. The most pressing would be how to brake
forward speed, now abetted by the moon's gravita
tional pull, in order to make a gentle landing. Wings
and parachutes would be useless as the moon has no
atmosphere. Only counter-propulsion—jet action at
the ship's nose—would do the braking job.
A second problem of approach would be to pick a
dawn or dusk landing area having a moderate tem
perature at the moment. In its four-week orbit, the
moon presents the same face to the earth at all
times. No earth dweller has ever seen the other
half of the moon.
Luna thus rotates but once in the four-week
tour of its orbit, and has a four-week-long day.
Any spot on its surface endures two weeks of
scorching sun devoid of cloud protection, followed
by two weeks of blackest night. Daytime heat
would easily boil water. Midnight cold is twice as
frigid as Nature's coldest ever recorded on earth.
The mono's diameter, 2.1(H) miles, is two-sevenths
that of the earth. Gravitation at its surface is one
sixth that on earth—too little to retain an atmosphere.
A man's step would be springy on the moon. He
could jump six times his earthly limit.
Man's largest telescopes, such as the 200-inch
reflector on Paloniar Mountain. Calif., can magnify
heavenly bodies as much as 10.000 times. They can
bring the moon to position equivalent to only 2J
miles away. And television already has brought
moon surfaces thus magnified into thousands of
American homes.
Thus, beholders may see clearly the lunar desola
tion. No plant, no animal, no insect can live on its
surface. Weird mountain ranges compare with earth
mountains in height. There are numerous smooth
plains, which early observers mistook for seas. Cra
ters. possibly caused by volcanic eruption or by me
teorites falling uncushioned by air, range up to 140
miles across.
