## Varsity Trackmen Win; Chandler Breaks Mark 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
Setting one American record and many individual "best-ever"
marks, the Stanford track team crushed the Olympic Club squad,
84 1-3 to 46 2-3 Saturday afternoon in Stanford Stadium.
The Indians showed extraordinary strength by sweeping the
low hudles, the 220, the broad jump, and the high hurdles. In

every single event, they accounted
for at least a second place, which
is very important for the meet next
week with USC at Los Angeles.
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE
honors were well-earned by all
around track and field man Gay
Bryan. The tall, husky athlete gar
nered 13 points for the Indians.
He leaped 24 feet 3Vfe inches to
win the broad jump, tied for first
place in the high jump with 6 feet
4 inches, and flashed through the 220
low hurdles to win in 23.8 seconds.
The first two marks were the best
he has ever done, while the last ties
his winning time against San Jose
State last week.
Downing McKee again led the
pack of Indians to the tape in the
high hurdles. In his second appear
ance in a Cardinal uniform, the
Bakersfield flash chopped 2-10 of
a second of! his 14.5 against San
Jose. Darell Kreitz and Skip Kent
followed in close order, all undoubt
edly running the best race of then
careers.
BILL LARSON S 14-FOOT LEAP
places him high on the list of Pa
cific Coast Conference vaulters. Bill
is improving in every meet, and will
receive the supreme test next Satur
day against the Trojan 14-foot men.
Marty Anderson also cleared 13 feet
for the first time.
Lary HofT, the Indians' ace 440
runner, pulled up lame in the quar
ter mile, but Pitch Johnson and A 1
Wilkins made up for it by placing
one-two in the race. According to
Coach Weirshauser, Hoff will be
ready to go against the Trojans.
The sprints, in which Stanford
was so weak last week against San
Jose, found the Cards coming up
with two winners. Gordy Levy
broke 10 fiat in the century for the
first time in his life, while Bud Rit
cher nipped Levy in the 220. There
was no official time for the latter
race because no smoke was dis
charged when (he starter's gun went
off. However, the race was unof
ficially clocked at 21.6 seconds.
ALTHOUGH THE CARDS* Otis
Chandler lost to OC's Jim Delaney
by a few inches in the regular shot
put, he broke a 36-year-old Amer
ican record in the two-handed shot.
He combined a 50 '9 1 •>" right-handed
toss with a 41' 7" heave to break
Ralph Rose's old mark of 91' IOV2".
Good steady performances were
turned in by George Grimes and

A 1 Holubar in the half mile; A 1
Lyons and Jose Rael in the dis
tances; and Fred Fank and Marty
Anderson in the broad jump.
Bud Held broke 200 feet in the
javelin, which may carry him to vic
tory against USC. Steve McKee also
threw a very respectable 145' 10 1 /'
in the discus.
