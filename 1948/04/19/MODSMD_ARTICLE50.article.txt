# Varsity Swimmers Dunk Olympic Club
## 
### BY BILL SWIGART 
Splashing to a first place in every event, Stanford's swimming
team turned back an Olympic Club squad, 54 to 21, before a
capacity crowd at the Encina Pools Saturday afternoon.
The Farm varsity was paced by the performances of Captain
Bob Anderson and Ralph Sala. Anderson won both sprints and

swam anchor lap on the winning
Indian freestyle relay team, while
3ala' was a double winner in the
niddle distance races.
THE INDIAN CAUSE was aided
by a little brown and white dog
who was declared the unofficial win
ler of the 200-yard breaststroke
•ace. After competing in nearly
■very event at the Stanford-Olympic
riub track meet at Stanford Sta
jium, the versatile pooch put in his
ippearance at the pool to become
in unwelcome late entry in the
Dreaststroke race.
When last seen, the mutt was giv
ng swimming lessons to Indians
Bob Anderson and Woody Hoogs.
Best times of the day were turned
n by Sala and by breaststroker Don
fester. In the 220-yard freestyle
■vent, Sala easily outdistanced his
learest Olympic Club rival, Don
Bcanston, to win in the good time
>112 2:14.3.
IN TIIE QUARTER MIL E, it was
lot quite so easy. Sala matched
trokes with his ex-teammate Fred
Caioli for 16 lengths before finally
mling away to win by half a yard,
lis time was 4:53.5.
Don Hester showed his best form
n two years in winning the 200-
'ard breaststroke race. Swimming
vith virtually no "slip" in his
troke, Hester pulled away from the
ield and was never threatened. His
ime of 2:25 was over two seconds
aster than his own PCC record.
Another PCC mark was unoffi
ially bettered when Jack Weeden,
)on Hester, and Nick Narver swam
he 300-yard-medley relay in the
ood time of 2:57.7. The standing
ecord is 2:59.6. set by three USC
wimmers in 1940.
IN OTHER EVENTS, Jim Brad
haw surprised by winning the div
event from Clubman Dick Mob
?y. and Jack Weeden defeated his
rother, Al, in the backstroke race.
Next event on the Stanford swim
ling calendar falls on Wednesday
fternoon when the varsity travels
) Stockton to meet the College of
