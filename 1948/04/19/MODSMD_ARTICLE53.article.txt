# SJS Golfers Edge Indians
## 
### 
Playing over the San Jose Coun
try Club course, Stanford's varsity
golfers dropped a close 12 1 to 14>j
match to the Spartans 'ast Friday
afternoon. Warren McCarty of
San Jose State fired a sensational
64 in the 18-hole match to win low
score honors for the day.
McCarty shot 12 par and 6
birdies to get his 64-stroke score.
Morgan Fottrell, also of San Jose,
carded a 72.
TOM LAMBIE played best golf
for the Indians as he took three
points from the Spartans' Ely Bari
teau in the singles matches and
teamed with Bob Rosburg in the
doubles to win two more points.
Rosburg, who competed in the
Masters tournament in Augusta.
Ga., a couple of weeks ago, missed
the alumni match on April 10, so
this was the first time he has played
with the varsity this season.
Bud Moe and Jack Shuler of
Stanford finished even with Bobby
Harris and Ross Smith of San Jose
in other singles matches, each tak
ing and losing one and one-half
points. Moe had Harris two up with
two holes to play, only to lose the
last holes and split three points.
THE INDIANS trailed 8 to 10 at
the end of the singles and failed to
make up the deficit in the doubles,
as McCarty again did most of the
damage to their cause.
Coach Eddie Twiggs' men will
have a chance to revenge their loss
on May 15 when they take on the
Spartans in a return match on the
local course.
This Saturday the varsity links
men meet Cal here. If comparisons
mean anything, the Indians should
have little difficulty in winning over
the Bears. Already this season Cal
met and was defeated by San Jose,
20-7.

this was the first time he has played
with the varsity this season.
Bud Moe and Jack Shuler of
Stanford finished even with Bobby
Harris and Ross Smith of San Jose
in other singles matches, each tak
ing and losing one and one-half
points. Moe had Harris two up with
two holes to play, only to lose the
last holes and split three points.
THE INDIANS trailed 8 to 10 at
the end of the singles and failed to
make up the deficit in the doubles,
as McCarty again did most of the
damage to their cause.
Coach Eddie Twiggs' men will
have a chance to revenge their loss
on May 15 when they take on the
Spartans in a return match on the
local course.
This Saturday the varsity links
men meet Cal here. If comparisons
mean anything, the Indians should
have little difficulty in winning over
the Bears. Already this season Cal
met and was defeated by San Jose,
20-7.
