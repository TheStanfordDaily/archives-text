# Martzloff and Coate Resume Their Debate on Foreign Scholarship Plan
## 
### TOM MARTZLOFF BY BOB COATE 
(There will he a discussion of the foreign scholarship question on
KSl' tonight at 8.)

Undoubtedly the old "hue and |
j cry" will be going up today; how
! ever, emotions cannot take the
place of facts. The cost of this 10-
foreign - student proposal would
consume 95.4 per cent of our funds
currently recommended as avail
able for considered expenditures.
The con articles of last Wednes
day and Friday give the complete J
financial picture relevant to this
| proposal together with the advice '
| and counsel of those more quali
! fied than I to indicate wise financial ■
' policy. As student body president.
! my sole aim is to acquaint you with
these facts and what I consider to ,
be sound advice, that you may be (
qualified to vote intelligently upon
this issue.
Again I urge you to this positive
action:
1. Vote NO on this 50,030 ballot ■
proposal, ana in addition indicate
that you favor a modified plan.
2. Advise your Excom rep 'escn
tative of your desire tc ar ing
rpo^ification.
3. Formulate and circulate peti- 1
tions expressing your wishes re- ;
T>»T>jnt* this modification.

Now that we have cleared up !
MartzlofT's financial misrepresenta
tions, there remains an additional ;
misconception. Even if Martzloff's
interpretation of the facts had been
accurate, his statement .. my re- i
sponsibility for SOUND administra
tion . . leads one to question j
his use of the word "sound."
The word does not mean, as he :
implies, a simple dollars-and-cents, ,
profit-and-loss bookkeeping theory, j
It does not necessitate suspicion ot i
any expenditure having implications |
beyond our campus boundaries. At
Stanford it is not a grade-school
word!
"Sound" means intelligent action
in relation to the times. Naturally
it is difficult in our world of green
Hi lis, beer busts, and meetings to
realize that we are a part of any
thin" larger than Stanford. But we
are; and we are a part that can
do a lot in relation to our size.
All know of the balance on hand
of $22,000 —but few advocate dipping
into this (although last year it was ]
seen fit to use $7,000 of the balance
on hand to pav off a debt!). All
know of the $13,000 .siill unbudgeted
this year. All know of the $9,050 to
be budgeted by a student body of
8,000.
In what way is the Foreign Schol
arship proposal unSOUND? What il
the plan doesn't show an immediate
dollars-and-eents return to mark
down in the ASSU books before the
end of the year?
Words such as "investment" and
"sound business practices" have in
the United States traditionally im
plied material returns. Conflicts
have largely been material in na
ture until the dollar has come to be
more and more the standard ol ,
judgment of ideas. However, think
ing on an international scale can no
longer be done in terms of dollar |
returns.
Conflicts today are largely ideo
logical (unlike any previous time in
history), and we are citizens of a
nation trying to put over an idea.
For us, "investment" and "business

i sense" mean far more than they |
would in the old and narrow sense. !
Practicality implies action within '
feasible bounds, AND AN EYE
TOWARD MORE THAN THE MG
MENTAi;Y RETURNS.
Our country is convinced of the
soundness of investing hundreds of
millions of dollars in Europe with
no immediate material returns. Our ;
unique position as a university gives
us the opportunity to take a vital
part. We are in a position to make j
contacts and foster understanding ]
far more readily than any other j
agency or institution. The State De
partment constantly cites the des
perate need for an increase in Eu
ropean students attending American
universities.
Is the plan sound? Ten of the 14
people who have worked all year
with our funds passed it at the
level which seemed soundest. Three
of those people would like to sec I
us spend more. Four would like to
sec us do less.
