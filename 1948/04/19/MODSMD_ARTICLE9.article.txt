### 
ROME, April 18 (UP) —Terrorists attacked two great munitions
depots in the communist-dominated north today as Italians, with
the country's fate at stake, voted for a new parliament.
The attackers were not identified as communists. But official
army sources said that the attacks caused them to restudy several

'alleged secret communist plans for i ;
coup in connection with the election.
The army munitions depots out
side Piacienza and Pavia were at
tacked unsuccessfully.
FOR 14 HOURS Italian men and
women flocked to the polls in the
first of two days voting which will
decide whether this ancient country
goes behind the communist iron cur
tain or remains in the camp of the
Western Allies.
At 2 a.m. today the ministry of
interior announced that delay in get
ting reports from all of Italy's 96
provinces was holding up an officia
announcement of the number o
electors who voted yesterday.
BUT UNOFFICIAL surveys indi
cated that the national average haJ
been about 80 per cent with an addi
tional seven hours polling to be helc
today from 7 a.m. (midnight Sundav
EST) to 2 p.m. (7 a.m. EST).

WASHINGTON, April 18 (IT).
—Ihe heavy voting in today's
Italian election means a "decisive"'
victory for the anti - Communist
forces, according to a spokesman
for the Committee for Italian De
mocracy.
He made his claim on the basis
of late dispatches showing an av -
erage vote of 80 per cent of the
Italian electorate with an addi
tional seven hours' polling to go
tomorrow.

Reports from 72 of the 56 prov
inces which form the 31 electora'
colleges under the proportional rep
resentation system for the national
assembly gave the estimated 80 pe'.
cent voting turnout.
INDIVIDUAL REPORTS ranged
from a low of 65 per cent in the
leftist Turin district to a high of
90 per cent in the Parma College
below the Po River.
One reason for the delay in an
official announcement, apparently,
was the size of the vote. In some
scattered areas the polls were kept
open until nearly midnight, two
hours overtime, to accommodate
those still patiently queued up.

ROME, April 18 (UP) —Terrorists attacked two great munitions
depots in the communist-dominated north today as Italians, with
the country's fate at stake, voted for a new parliament.
The attackers were not identified as communists. But official
army sources said that the attacks caused them to restudy several

'alleged secret communist plans for i ;
coup in connection with the election.
The army munitions depots out
side Piacienza and Pavia were at
tacked unsuccessfully.
FOR 14 HOURS Italian men and
women flocked to the polls in the
first of two days voting which will
decide whether this ancient country
goes behind the communist iron cur
tain or remains in the camp of the
Western Allies.
At 2 a.m. today the ministry of
interior announced that delay in get
ting reports from all of Italy's 96
provinces was holding up an officia
announcement of the number o
electors who voted yesterday.
BUT UNOFFICIAL surveys indi
cated that the national average haJ
been about 80 per cent with an addi
tional seven hours polling to be helc
today from 7 a.m. (midnight Sundav
EST) to 2 p.m. (7 a.m. EST).

WASHINGTON, April 18 (IT).
—Ihe heavy voting in today's
Italian election means a "decisive"'
victory for the anti - Communist
forces, according to a spokesman
for the Committee for Italian De
mocracy.
He made his claim on the basis
of late dispatches showing an av -
erage vote of 80 per cent of the
Italian electorate with an addi
tional seven hours' polling to go
tomorrow.

Reports from 72 of the 56 prov
inces which form the 31 electora'
colleges under the proportional rep
resentation system for the national
assembly gave the estimated 80 pe'.
cent voting turnout.
INDIVIDUAL REPORTS ranged
from a low of 65 per cent in the
leftist Turin district to a high of
90 per cent in the Parma College
below the Po River.
One reason for the delay in an
official announcement, apparently,
was the size of the vote. In some
scattered areas the polls were kept
open until nearly midnight, two
hours overtime, to accommodate
those still patiently queued up.
