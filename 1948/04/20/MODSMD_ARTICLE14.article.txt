# Senate Hastens Air Bill; Control on Arms Sought
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 19 (UP) —
The State Department plans to ask
Congress tomorrow for new controls
over arms exports in a move which
may lead to lend-lease aid for non
communist Western Europe, it was
disclosed tonight.
The request is expected to l:e
handed to the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee by state and navy
department spokesmen.
It was said that they will propose
passage of a new munitions control
act which has been shelved since
President Truman requested it a
year ago.
The act would permit the Presi
dent to follow various policies on
shipments of arm and war-potential
goods.
The impending action was re
vealed as Acting Secretary of State
Robert A. Lovett conferred with the
British and French ambassadors,
Lord Inverchapel and Henri Bonnet.
They reportedly discussed how the
United States will back up the five
power mutual defense treaty re
cently signed by Britain, France.
Belgium, The Netherlands, and Lux
embourg.

WASHINGTON. April 19 (UP) —
Fast Senate action was promised to
day on the House-approved $3,198,-
000,000 bill to build a 70-group air
force.
Chairman Styles Bridges (P., N.
H.) said his Senate Appropriations
Committee is ready to take up the
air power program without further
delay because of the "critical" world
situation.
Previously Bridges had indicated
he wanted to delay until he re
ceived the formal recommendations
of the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee. That group is awaiting a de
tailed report from Defense Secre
tary James Forrestal on an overall
military expansion program, includ
ing the draft and universal military
training.
If the armed services committee
is stymied by Wednesday, Bridges
said, the appropriations body may
meet then to schedule hearings on
the air force expansion project.
Meantime, the House Armed Serv
ices Committee ran into strong anti
draft sentiment from the CIO and
two Negro leaders.
