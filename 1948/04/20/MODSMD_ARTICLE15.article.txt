# Court Upholds Negro Rights In Primaries
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 19 (UP).â€”
The Supreme Court ruled again to
day that states cannot legally keep
Negroes from voting in primary
elections.
It refused to review two lower
court decisions upholding the right
of Negroes to vote in South Caro
lina's Democratic primary, even
though the state's "white primary"
law permits the party to bar them
from the polls.
The high court tossed out a simi
lar Texas law as "unconstitutional"
two years ago. A number of South
ern states have proposed revising
their primary laws to get around
that ruling.
Returning to the bench after a
two-week recess, the court also:
1. Refused to interfere in the
suspension of movie director Cecil
B. DeMille from the Federation of
Radio Artists (AFL) for refusing to
pay a $1 political assessment four
years ago.
2. Reaffirmed, over the objections
of Justice Robert A. Jackson, a 194(5
ruling that U.S. unemployment
compensation claims on bankrupt
firms must be paid in full before
state claims are considered.
3. Upheld the government's right
to take over most of the pre-war
U.S. interests in the I.G. Farben
industrie. giant German chemical
combine.
4. Ruled that the government is
not liable for damage to farm prop
erty that occurred during tenancy
by co-operatives formerly under
the now - defunct Farm Security
Administration.
