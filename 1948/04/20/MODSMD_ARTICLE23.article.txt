# Friends Plan Summer Projects
## 
### BY LORRY LOKEY 
Each summer hundreds of stu
dents volunteer for work and study
projects sponsored by the American
Friends Service Committee in the
United States, Mexico, and Europe.
While students contribute their
manual and oral aid to the world
public, they gain in return a know
ledge of cooperative discussion,
.study, and living.
These summer service opportun
ities are sponsored by the Quakers
"in the belief that peace is more than
just the absence of war. Only as
we come together to create can we
find ways to surmount chaos."
The committee, with headquarters
at 20 South 12th street in Philadel
phia, Pa., maintains seven projects
each summer. Student expenses in
tuition and maintenance vary with
each project. Summarized, the proj
ects are:
1. Institutes of International Rela
tions — Thirteen adult Institutes of
International Relations are held for
10 days each summer on college
campuses across the United States.
The Institutes endeavor to present
the problems of peace and the causes
of war, and to stimulate discussion
and action upon the issues involved.
Tuition and maintenance start at
53.75 per day. Western Institutes
this year will be held at Washington
State, Seattle, June 15 to 20; Mills
College. Oakland, June 20 to 30; and
Whittier College, Whittier, July 2

Each summer hundreds of stu
dents volunteer for work and study
projects sponsored by the American
Friends Service Committee in the
United States, Mexico, and Europe.
While students contribute their
manual and oral aid to the world
public, they gain in return a know
ledge of cooperative discussion,
.study, and living.
These summer service opportun
ities are sponsored by the Quakers
"in the belief that peace is more than
just the absence of war. Only as
we come together to create can we
find ways to surmount chaos."
The committee, with headquarters
at 20 South 12th street in Philadel
phia, Pa., maintains seven projects
each summer. Student expenses in
tuition and maintenance vary with
each project. Summarized, the proj
ects are:
1. Institutes of International Rela
tions — Thirteen adult Institutes of
International Relations are held for
10 days each summer on college
campuses across the United States.
The Institutes endeavor to present
the problems of peace and the causes
of war, and to stimulate discussion
and action upon the issues involved.
Tuition and maintenance start at
53.75 per day. Western Institutes
this year will be held at Washington
State, Seattle, June 15 to 20; Mills
College. Oakland, June 20 to 30; and
Whittier College, Whittier, July 2
to 11.
2. Friends Service Units in Mexico
—During 1947, 150 young men and
women worked with Mexicans on
village projects under the direction
of the Mexican government's De
partment of Public Health and Edu
cation. Volunteers are needed this
year for a recreation and handicrafts
program with children, for special
language study, for construction of a
water system in a small town, and
for the expansion of Tlaxcala's
health program. Maintenance costs
on the projects will be $150.
Institutional Service Units —
Students entering this project work
as regular employes of a state men
tal hospital, reformatory, or training
school. They receive the prevailing
salary and do the regular work. But
in addition students attend lectures,
make field trips, and study case his
tories. Volunteers contribute a per
centage of their salaries toward the
maintenance of the ISU program.
4. Peace Caravans — Since 1927,
caravans of three or four selected
college students have gone into com
munities throughout the country
trying to arouse individuals for a
concern in world peace. These stu
dents also channel this concern into
study, discussion, and action. Two

seven-week caravans will be spon- ,
sored in California. Maintenance
will cost $125. Applications may be ,
j sent to the Philadelphia office or to
the Southern California Branch,
I AFSC, 42(5 North Raymond avenue,

ple from nearly every country in
; Europe to help families rebuild
j homes and community facilities de-
I stroyed during the war. Total cost
i per student is approximately $500.
(5. Work Camps — Volunteer work
camps are located in many areas of
the United States to help the resi
j dents improve their community fa
| cilities or living conditions by their
j own efforts. Maintenance is about
