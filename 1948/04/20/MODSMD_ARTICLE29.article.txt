One of the candidates for Lower Row Excom delivered this
criticism of the present Excom members:
1. At the last meeting they disregarded a letter from a small
Eastern college asking Stanford's support of their protest to
Russia on the shooting of a couple of Czech students.
2. They further disregarded a letter from the students of the
University of Hawaii asking Stanford's support of statehood for
Hawaii.
Now, the candidate thinks these letters are Excom's busi
ness, and that Excom was remiss in not attending to it instead
of putting it aside as not in the realm of student government.
So let's get things straight. Excom is elected to run the student
body affairs of Stanford University. With a campus of 8,000
students they have their work cut out for them.
If they spent all their time debating every letter of the sort
mentioned above, and then referring them to the electorate, they
would accomplish very little of the work they are elected to
do. And there are hundreds of such letters that arrive every
month, espousing one cause or another. Most organizations are
publicity conscious these days and they fairly flood newspapers
and other organizations with requests for support.
Most of the requests are for a good cause. Granted. But it
isn't the business of the student body government to examine
them all and then issue a letter proposing to speak for the entire
student body.
Getting right down to earth, it would be a lot of trouble if
Ihey did. On the Hawaii question, a lot of people would like
to see statehood for Alaska and not Hawaii. In regards to the
first letter, students have been shot in Central and South
America for over 100 years because they take their politics
seriously, and no American college has protested.
But the point is Excom is doing the right thing by concerning
itself with Stanford business and not trying to be a sounding
board of public opinion on every affair national and interna
tional. â€”T. M. S.
