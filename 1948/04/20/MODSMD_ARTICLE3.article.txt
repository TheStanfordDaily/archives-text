Let's get squared away on this business of ASSU finances
and the foreign scholarship plan. Student Manager Gene Mit
guard released the following statement today which shows the
financial condition of the ASSU as of March 31, 1948:
Total Income 833,773.80
Total Disbursements 20,798.49
Estimated Operating Balance for Year $12,975.31
Less Commitments:
Scholarships $1,500.00
Estimated Reserve for Normal
Expenditures for Year 2,000.00
Total $ 3.500.00
Balance of Estimated Income for Year 1948-48 $ 9.475.31
Surplus, August 31, 1947 22.05G.00
Total, Surplus and Current Operating Income $31,531.31
What does this mean? It means that we have $9,475.31 extra
cash budgeted to last us until June. That is, $9,475.31 more than
all presently anticipated expenditures for the rest of the year.
If this money is not spent, if we keep within our budget, it will
go into the surplus.
Mitguard says it isn't likely we will stay within the budget.
But we can if Excom approves requests for additional funds only
for campus groups genuinely in need of extra cash.
Any 59,000 expenditure at this time is not the wisest step
financially. But was spending six billion dollars for the Marshall
Plan any wiserâ€”financially? Congress thought so. You will
have to make a comoarable decision tomorrow.
