## How About the $40,000? 
### 
To the Editor:
In the coming election we arc called on to decide whether or not to
approve the foreign scholarship plan. The opponents to this plan have
brought forth an array of figures purporting to show that the ASSU
â– will surely go broke if we approve this plan. Of course there is that
Jittle matter of a $22,000 surplus left over from last year, that has yet to
be explained to our satisfaction. But be that as it may, there is another
item with which we are more familiar.
Some months ago we were considering the question of what to do
with $40,000. We were going to spend it, that was for sure. The only
question seemed to be, "What will give us the most pleasure" So we
Stanford students, on our beautiful university campus, surrounded by all
the material advantages one can wish for, had no trouble deciding to
spend $40,000 toward a new Student Union. But when it comes to spending
less than $10,000 for a little help to our brothers overseas, then we
begin to think we are going broke. Or is it possible that there are
still some of us who think that our Christianity is something we can
put on every Sunday morning about 11 a.m., take o(T about an hour later,
and not be bothered with for the rest of the week?
