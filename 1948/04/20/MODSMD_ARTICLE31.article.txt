# A 						"Modified Plan"
## 
### 
To the Editor:
After hearing speakers on the foreign scholarship plan at a Roble house
meeting, we feel that the ballot on this plan is too narrowly worded.
Those who favor the plan but believe it should be modified have no as
surance that a modified plan to reduce the number of students will be put
through if they vote a definite "no."
If the majority of the students vote "no," it would be impossible to tell
if the students were against the plan as a whole or if they would favor
the plan under modified conditions. We therefore suggest that the stu
dents write in the two words "modified plan" on their ballot if they
desire this alternative.
