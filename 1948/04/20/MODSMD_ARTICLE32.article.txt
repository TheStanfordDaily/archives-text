Sweeping revisions in the system of higher educa
tion in America are called for by the President's
Commission on Higher Education in its series of
six reports recently completed.
The commission, composed of outstanding edu
cators, was appointed by President Truman last
summer to "examine the functions of higher educa
tion in our democracy and the means by which they
can best be performed."
The number one need for higher education today,
the group has found, is the expansion of higher
education facilities so that more students may he
able to attend college. The commission urged ex
tension of free public education through the first
two years of college as one of the steps toward
meeting this need. At the same time, it stated,
there should be a "concerted drive to reduce all
fees for public colleges and universities."
Citing the phenomenal growth of higher education
in this country, the commissioin stated that college
enrollments in 1947 jumped to the unprecedented
total of 2,354,000. Of these about 1,000.000 were vet
erans, receiving college training under the GI Bill
of Rights. In addition there are today approximately
1,500.000 other veterans who are receiving some
form of training through the educational provisions
of the GI Bill of Rights.
Despite this record, however, the commission
stated that "one of the greatest charges to which
American society is subject is that of failing to
provide a reasonable equality of educational op
portunity for its youth."
The commission believes that by 1960 there should
be a minimum of 4.600,000 students enrolled in col
leges and universities. Of this number 2.500.000
would be in junior college, another 1,500,000 at the
senior college level, and the remaining 600,000 would
be college graduates who would continue their studies
in graduate and professional schools. The commis
sion stated that nearly half the population has the
mental ability to complete two years of college and at
least 32 per cent has the mental ability to complete
an advanced liberal or specialized professional edu
cation.
"In a real sense the future of our civilization
depends on the direction education takes, not just
in the distant future but in the days immediately
ahead," the commission stated in its first report.
Education was described as the biggest and most
hopeful of the nation's enterprises, and the com
mission stated that of the principal goals of higher
education, the three which should come "first in
our time" are to bring to all the people of the na
tion:
"Education for a fuller realization of democracy
in every phase of living.
"Education directly and explicitly for international
understanding and cooperation.
"Education for the application of creative imagina
tion and trained intelligence to the solution of social
problems and to the administration of public affairs."

summer to "examine the functions of higher educa
tion in our democracy and the means by which they
can best be performed."
The number one need for higher education today,
the group has found, is the expansion of higher
education facilities so that more students may he
able to attend college. The commission urged ex
tension of free public education through the first
two years of college as one of the steps toward
meeting this need. At the same time, it stated,
there should be a "concerted drive to reduce all
fees for public colleges and universities."
Citing the phenomenal growth of higher education
in this country, the commissioin stated that college
enrollments in 1947 jumped to the unprecedented
total of 2,354,000. Of these about 1,000.000 were vet
erans, receiving college training under the GI Bill
of Rights. In addition there are today approximately
1,500.000 other veterans who are receiving some
form of training through the educational provisions
of the GI Bill of Rights.
Despite this record, however, the commission
stated that "one of the greatest charges to which
American society is subject is that of failing to
provide a reasonable equality of educational op
portunity for its youth."
The commission believes that by 1960 there should
be a minimum of 4.600,000 students enrolled in col
leges and universities. Of this number 2.500.000
would be in junior college, another 1,500,000 at the
senior college level, and the remaining 600,000 would
be college graduates who would continue their studies
in graduate and professional schools. The commis
sion stated that nearly half the population has the
mental ability to complete two years of college and at
least 32 per cent has the mental ability to complete
an advanced liberal or specialized professional edu
cation.
"In a real sense the future of our civilization
depends on the direction education takes, not just
in the distant future but in the days immediately
ahead," the commission stated in its first report.
Education was described as the biggest and most
hopeful of the nation's enterprises, and the com
mission stated that of the principal goals of higher
education, the three which should come "first in
our time" are to bring to all the people of the na
tion:
"Education for a fuller realization of democracy
in every phase of living.
"Education directly and explicitly for international
understanding and cooperation.
"Education for the application of creative imagina
tion and trained intelligence to the solution of social
problems and to the administration of public affairs."

Sweeping revisions in the system of higher educa
tion in America are called for by the President's
Commission on Higher Education in its series of
six reports recently completed.
The commission, composed of outstanding edu
cators, was appointed by President Truman last
summer to "examine the functions of higher educa
tion in our democracy and the means by which they
can best be performed."
