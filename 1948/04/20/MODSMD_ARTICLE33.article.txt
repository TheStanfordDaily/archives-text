PARIS (UP) â€”Nearly three years after the war's
end, both communists and right wing groups have
"important" stocks of arms hidden throughout
France, an authoritative source told the United Press.
The arms include such large-scale weapons as tanks
and cannon. Many of the latter were part of the
Normandy coast defenses. After the war the gov
ernment sold them to "ironmongers" for melting
down purposes, but part are believed to have found
their way into the hands of political groups.
