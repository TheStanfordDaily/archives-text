## History 1948 
### 
Never in time of peace and seldom in time of
war has the modern world been in such danger as
it is today. The situation is comparable with that
in the fall of 1940, when Hitler made his bid to
conquer Britain by air; with that during the winter
after Pearl Harbor; with that following the Nor
mandy landings. Within the next few weeks and
months it will become decisively worse or decisively
better. From that conclusion there is no escape.
Yet to face this fact is no invitation to despair.
The emergency ought to stir men's energies and lift
their thinking out of the narrow and provincial
plane, and to some extent it has done so. The cen
tral peril is the collapse of Western civilization. This
peril reveals itself on many fronts, on all of which
some remedial measures are being taken.
In this country, for examp'e, there is danger of
an inflation which would paralyze our productive
power and destroy American prestige throughout
the world. The answer to the prevalent argument
that free institutions, under private enterprise, are
doomed is to make them work. The proposals which
President Truman has put before Congress are not
the final word, but those who reject them are under
a moral obligation to offer something else which will,
in fact, prevent inflation. This section of the battle
front must be held.
There is the danger of the drying up of the
international trade which is the life-blood of free
economies. This problem is, of course, linked with
the threatened economic and political collapse of
Western Europe. If Europe can import what it needs
within the next four years and if it can thereafter
export enough to pay for its imports, European
civilization will be safe.
The responsibility for making this possible rests
mainly on the United States, and, in peace or war,
we have never assumed a greater one. But the at
tack on the problem is, and has been international.
All nations must work together in a long range
program to stimulate production, employment, and
the exchange of goods and services throughout the
world.
There is danger that the world's great powers will
not be able to agree on the conditions of a lasting
peace. Seemingly we are no nearer an agreement
on the control of atomic weapons than we were a
year ago. The last session of the United Nations As
sembly has only sharpened the edge of disagree
ment between the Soviet bloc and most of the other
nations represented. The "Little Assembly," Greece,
Korea, â€”all are points of division.
The conference of Foreign Ministers brought us
nearer to a settlement in Austria, in Germany, or
in Europe as a whole. In Italy and France the
communists are making a determined effort to sabo
tage the existing democratically chosen governments.
Beyond these dangers, rising out of them, is the
danger of an irreconciliable conflict that will finally
lead to war. This is not a danger to the United States,
to the Soviet Union, or to any particular govern
ment as it is a danger to the entire human race.
The atomic bomb is only one of a number of effec
tive weapons which collectively could wipe out mil
lions of human beings and many centuries of progress.
A ruined world might be preferable to a world
enslaved. We prepare our defenses in that belief.
But we should not cherish the illusion that we would
be left with much that would be of value after even
the most successful defense.
Where do these somber considerations leave us?
First, we believe, with the conclusion that nothing
wc effectively do to spread and guard the areas of
freedom can be deemed costly in comparison with
its benefits. Second, with the conclusion that this
strengthening of freedom will discourage aggression
against freedom. Third, with the hope that the real
ists in the Kremlin will see the ghostly futility of war
and will admit that if no aggression is committed the
Iwo systems can work out their own destinies peace
fully within their own frontiers.
The next few months will hold the answers to the
questions. Let us hope that the answer is written
by men who uphold peace and good-will.
