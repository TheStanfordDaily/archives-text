# ERLING FORLAND
## Bull Session

It's terrible, but I think my buddy's going to col
lege has led him astray. Maybe he should have
stayed in Brooklyn, where his mother could keep a
wary watch over him. For one thing, his roommates
gamble. And. awful as it is to say, sontfetimes he flips
with them to see who is going to pay for the beer.
As long as he was home, he never Hipped a coin.
He was taught that it was a sin.
Lots of the fellows around here go out with girls,
too. That's terrible. My buddy's mother drummed it
into his head, when he was home, that no boy should
think of going out with girls until he has enough
money to set up a comfortable home, and that he
especially shouldn't date girls until he is mature
enough to realize what sort of girls make good wives,
and which don't.
When my buddy tells the boys in Encina that
none of the girls here know how to cook, leave
alone darn socks, they laugh. He thinks it's terrible
that those who are so young treat such a serious
question with levity. Maybe if they went to church
more it would help.
Well, anyway, he says that none of the girls he's
met in class look as though they know how to iron,
even. One day last quarter he talked to a girl in
one of his classes. Somehow the subject turned to
girls. He mentioned that he thought it was foolish
for a boy to even think of dating a girl who doesn't

know how to do the ordinary household tasks. He
said that back home in Brooklyn all the girls were
trained in that. She giggled.
No, something should definitely be done about
all this. When my buddy was at sea, his ship once
docked in a Portuguese port. He says that it was
perfectly lovely the way all the young girls were
always escorted by their mothers or duennas, as he
believes they were called. Once when he was coming
out of a bar, he saw a young girl and her mother
walking along the street. Maybe it was the whiskey,
or maybe it was because he had been out to sea for
so long, but anyhow he must have been gaping, be
cause the girl winked at him. He was very glad
that her mother was there.
A good course that my buddy would be very glad
to sign up for, and he's sure would prove to be very
popular with the other boys in Encina, would be a
course in how to avoid female traps until a fellow is
ready to marry. His mother gave him a couple of
good hints before he left home, but he thinks that he
needs more advice. Though he knows he shouldn't
think about girls until he's at least 30 years old. he
confessed to me that he was toying with the idea
of maybe having one or two dates this quarter, one
night when he and I were out at Rossotti's.
Yes, my buddy's mother was very strict with him.
She always kept girls away from him. How he
wishes she were here now.
