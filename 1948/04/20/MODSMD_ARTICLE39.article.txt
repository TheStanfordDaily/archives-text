# Recent Article Subject To Misinterpretation
## 
### 
A recent article in The Daily by
j Gordon Ness and Herb Smith on
j Students Concerned has been sub
| iect to misinterpretation because the
lack paragraph was deleted for lack
of space.
The writers asked why concrete
facts could not be given by the or
ganization instead of vague gener
-1 alities. The qualifying paragraph,
j which should have appeared, read:
"Perhaps it is because they don't
; wish to tie themselves down to
rigid doctrines while still in the
formulative stage, or for some other
sound reason."
