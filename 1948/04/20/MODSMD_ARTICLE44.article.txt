# Yanks Learn Polo From British, Then Beat 'Em

("Editor's Note: This is (lie first of a series of three articles on polo.)

One spring afternoon in 1881 a
group of sportsmen of the Meadow
Brook Club, Long Island, imported
polo from England. From that day
thousands of American horse-lov
ers from ages 18 to 50 have adopted
polo as the fastest, most exciting
sport to play.
The Americans have since that
lime given their English forerun
ners a few lessons in the art. In
1921 an American team won the
International Cup, the symbol of
challenge competition between (lie
United States and Great Britain,
and has not lost it since.
This sterling silver trophy has
been in competition since 1886.
Twelve times at take, the trophy
has been won nine times by lhe
United States.
THE IMMORTAL team of '21 was
Jed by Thomas Hitchcock Jr., one
of the few players ever to be
awarded a 10-goal handicap. Hitch
cock held that rating 19 years in
succession before he was killed
during the last war. At present
there are two American poloists
with 10-goal handicaps, Cecil Smith
* and Stewart Iglehart.
A handicap rating is earned only
alter years of experience. Smith
has played 25 years for liis rating.
These handicaps are awarded once
a year by the U.S. Polo Association.
Ratings are used to make even
play among teams. Whenever a na
tional meet is held, the total num
ber of handicap points of each
player is added up to make a team
handicap. The team with the small
er goal handicap adds three-quar
ters of the difference to its game
score.
An American team recently com
peted against Mexico's famed Gra-

cida brothers with a team handicap
j of 3G points.
TIIKSK NATIONAL matc:hes of
! ten bring together conflicting meth-
I ods of play. When a team visits the
i United States for a match, it is up
against a free-wheeling, race-track
| style that relies on speed and ac
-1 curacy.
Americans race their opponents
! to the ball. They use no deception.
The harder .they hit the ball the
I better.
In marked contrast Englishmen
j s>ive the game finesse by stressing
, team work and short passes. They
: use strategy to outsmart their op
ponents and lake them out of posi
j tion.
POLO PON IKS AKK trained lo
lake such punishment. They can
stand as many as 30 solid body con
tacts without flinching. When two
horses check on a polo field, a
j thousand pounds of horse flesh and
' muscle create a force that can
\ break the leg of the rider who isn't
alert.
Such body blocks are used to
; force a man away from (he bal! in
! a maneuver called "riding out." A
' player, riding al breakneck speed
i parallel to his opponent, bumps his
1 horse's shoulder and side against
' his opponent's horse and pushes the
player out of position. This is a
j legal move in polo.
THKSE RKATINOS, the sudden,
j stops, and the race - track speed
j wear out the horses quickly. Con
seqcently, each player uses about
six horses in ti polo match.
American horses, thoroughbreds
that are slightslv slow for the track,
i attain speeds of 25 miles an hour.
They are quick to respond to the
touch of the riedr, and must stop
on a dime, wheel, and be off at a
I gallop even with 220-pound Cecil
j Smith up.

One spring afternoon in 1881 a

polo from England. From that day
thousands of American horse-lov

polo as the fastest, most exciting
