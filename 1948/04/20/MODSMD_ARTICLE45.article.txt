# Daily Scribes Pick BoSox, Braves to Cop Majors' Flags
## 
### 
It will be an all-Boston World
Series this fall according to a con
sensus among the Daily sports staff.
Scoring on a basis of 8 for a first
place choice, 7 for a second, and so
on down to .1 for eighth found the
Boston Braves getting (52 points and
the Red Sox 60.
In the American League the Bos
ton Red Sox and the New York
Yankees split eight first-place bal
lots, but enough second-place votes
gave the BoSox the nod GO to 58.
Lou Boudreau's Cleveland Indians
edged out Detroit for third, 44 to
43. Connie Mack's Athletics picked
up 32 points to top the second divi
sion. Washington (23), Chicago
(15), and St. Louis (13) trailed.
Billy Southworth's Braves showed
surprising support in being picked
for six firsts and two seconds for
their 62-point total. Lippy Duro
cher's Bums' drew the other two
first - place votes but were edged
out for runner-up slot by the St.
Louis Cardinals, 51 to 49. The New
York Giants' "Pitchless Wonders"

rounded out the first division with
42 points.
The Pittsburgh Pirates and Cin
einnati Reds, each with 30 points,
were picked to battle it out for
fifth. Choily Grimm's sagging Cubs
and Ihe floundering Phillies split
the seventh- and eighth-place votes
for a 12-point total.
BoSox power against Brave pitch
ing in the World Series? Could be.
