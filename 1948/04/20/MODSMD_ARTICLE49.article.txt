# Card Baseballers Meet College of Pacific at 3:15
## 
### 
Stanford baseballers will try to*
break a two-game losing streak to
day when they meet College of Pa
cific on the Sunken Diamond. The J
first pitch is slated for 3:15.
The Cards have already beaten i
COP once this season, having drop
ped the Tigers 8 to 7 in a night
siame late in March. That game will
not count on CIBA records.
Indian baseball hopes went crash- j
ing to the depths this weekend as |
the varsity lost its second game to 1
California and also its fourth of the
campaign. They are now holding j
on to a fourth-place tie with UCLA
at two wins and four losses.
Card stickwork is still slow, as
almost every batter has slipped to
a low .200. Charlie Cole's bat has i
come to life, however, and the quick
first sacker has banged out five
base hits in the last two games.
Frank LaÃŸrum will probably
start for the locals today. He will
be backed up by the same lineup
that, has started most of the games :
this season.
