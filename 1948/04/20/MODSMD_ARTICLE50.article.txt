In dogdom it lias come to be that
no athletic event is worth the name |
unless at least one member of the
canine family is present to give his ,
b'essing to the occurrence.
Saturday was a busy day on the
Farm in regard to athletic events,
and it fell to the lot of one dog to
uphold the honor of all mutts and
aprear at all the games and meets.
ABOUT 10 A.M. a small, dirty
spaniel sneaked into the football
huddle of the Blacks, heard the
play, and proceeded to follow the
left half on the end sweep —un-
doubtedly ready to receive the lat
eral. The brown and white visitor
repeated this several times and
then found himself tied up to the ,
fence.
Thinking that this was no way. to
treat an official ambassador of dog- j
dom, the indignant pooch howled
and cried. The onlookers took
turns in petting' and mollifying him
in attempts to quiet the cries, but j
to no avail.
Came 2 p.m. and the track meet (
and Representative Spaniel was on
hand. His first visit was 'to the high
jump pit and a quick look at Gay
Bryan. From there he headed over
to the pole vault, passing under .
Bud Held's second jave'in throw
with nary a care.
AFTER ROUNDING the stadium
and assuring himself that the Cards |
were doing well, Spaniel I
himself tied up again.
To be sure, this time his captor
had secured him on the shady side j
of the stdium but, doggone it all. j
why didn't these people realize that
he was as much an official as the
timers? He barked, but loud.
Swimming was next on the list
and Mr. Spaniel barely got to En
cina Pool in time. He witnessed
the 400-yard relay and saw anchor j
man Bob Anderson swimming la- '
zily up and down the pool after j
winning the event.
HIS DAYS WORK over, he felt
that he needed some relaxation and ;
into the pool he went. He found j
Anderson to be an amenable swim- ;
ming companion and proceeded to
play an impromptu game of hide
and seek with the gentleman.
"Ah! - ' thought Mr. Spaniel
"These swimming people recognize
mv oosition."
With this he concluded the day.
but there would be more Saturdays j
and perhaps he would draw the j
Stanford assignment again. But j
then again, he might have to take j
the California job and that was not
so good.
Well, it's a dog's life.

doubtedly ready to receive the lat
eral. The brown and white visitor
repeated this several times and
then found himself tied up to the ,
fence.
Thinking that this was no way. to
treat an official ambassador of dog- j
dom, the indignant pooch howled
and cried. The onlookers took
turns in petting' and mollifying him
in attempts to quiet the cries, but j
to no avail.
Came 2 p.m. and the track meet (
and Representative Spaniel was on
hand. His first visit was 'to the high
jump pit and a quick look at Gay
Bryan. From there he headed over
to the pole vault, passing under .
Bud Held's second jave'in throw
with nary a care.
AFTER ROUNDING the stadium
and assuring himself that the Cards |
were doing well, Spaniel I
himself tied up again.
To be sure, this time his captor
had secured him on the shady side j
of the stdium but, doggone it all. j
why didn't these people realize that
he was as much an official as the
timers? He barked, but loud.
Swimming was next on the list
and Mr. Spaniel barely got to En
cina Pool in time. He witnessed
the 400-yard relay and saw anchor j
man Bob Anderson swimming la- '
zily up and down the pool after j
winning the event.
HIS DAYS WORK over, he felt
that he needed some relaxation and ;
into the pool he went. He found j
Anderson to be an amenable swim- ;

mv oosition."
With this he concluded the day.

the California job and that was not
so good.
Well, it's a dog's life.
In dogdom it lias come to be that
no athletic event is worth the name |

canine family is present to give his ,

Saturday was a busy day on the
Farm in regard to athletic events,
and it fell to the lot of one dog to
uphold the honor of all mutts and
aprear at all the games and meets.
ABOUT 10 A.M. a small, dirty
spaniel sneaked into the football
huddle of the Blacks, heard the
play, and proceeded to follow the
left half on the end sweep —un-
doubtedly ready to receive the lat
eral. The brown and white visitor
repeated this several times and
