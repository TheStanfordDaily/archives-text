## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Pacific Coast League play goes
into the fourth of its 26-week mar
athon tomorrow night with the !
pi e-season favorite S;m Francisco |
Seals still entrenched in first place. :
However, the leaders' margin was'
cut to a mere half-game during last j
week's play.
While Los Angeles was climbing
all over the Sacramento Solons to J
sweep their series five games to 1
two, the best the O'Doulmen could
do against San Diego was a six
game split. A look at the standings
reveals that the Seals have won j
10 while losing 6 for a percentage j
of .625. The Angels come next with |
a 12 won. 9 lost, .571 percentage.
ELSEWHERE IN the League, the
Portland Beavers were the week's
other big winners, taking a 4 to 1
edge in their series with the Holly
wood Stars. The two teams were
slated to play the sixth and seventh j
games last night.
At Seattle, the Oaks split the j
Sunday doubleheader with the Se- j
attle Rainiers to take the odd game
in the seven-contest series.
This week, Sacramento invades
Seal Stadium, Hollywood travels to
Seattle, third-place San Diego vis
its the lair of the Los Angeles An- '
eels, and Oakland opens in Port- '
land's dilapidated Lucky Beaver i
Stadium.
The league's long ball hitters
came into their own last week as I
the sluggers went on a home-run j
spree from one end of the coast to j
the other. In San Francisco the [
Padres' sensational Jack Graham I
smashed out four of the four-sack
ers to set a new series record for
the Park. This brought Graham's
sensoM s total to 10 in 20 games.
SACRAMENTO AM) Los Ange
les picked up an even ten homers i
between them, while Portland's j
first sacker Fenton Mole ran wild,
increasing his season's record to
seven.
