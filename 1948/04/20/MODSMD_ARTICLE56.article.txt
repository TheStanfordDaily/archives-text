### 
A brief respite from the "get
tough" program of Marchie
Schwartz was given Stanford's
griclders yesterday as the head man
let up on spring drills in favor of a
lighter practice.
The usual calisthenic drills,
blocking and tackling practice, and
dummy scrimmage were combined
to give the men a slight rest before
resuming the rugged work of past
days.
Mentor Schwartz passed over
Saturday's scrum as being too early
to appraise the probable value of
individual players.
The play of several men did show
up well though, with Dave Field,
Emery Mitchell. Ken Rose, and Bob
Rohrer showing up better than av
erage.
