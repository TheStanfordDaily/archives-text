Voting booths for the spring j
; primary today will remain open
from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., '
Gordon Luce, chairman of Elec

day.
To facilitate handling of the large j
turnout anticipated, polls will be
placed at the following locations:
History corner, the Library, en
gineering corner, Cellar, post office,
Lagunita, Roble, Encina Commons,
the Village dining hall, and the
business school.
The Village booth will be open
during the lunch hour only and the ,
booth at the business school during j
recess. Students may vote at any j
poll.
Voters must show their student I
body cards and register their names
and classes at the election booth be- j
fore they can obtain their ballot.
Women in charge of the booths will
invalidate other classes appearing
!on the ballot. When ballots are
counted, names of voters will be
j checked against class lists.
BALLOTS WILL be counted pub
licly in room 214 of the History
building starting at 4 p.m. All stu-
I dents and candidates are invited to
j attend the counting.
Luce will submit an election re
port which must be accepted by Ex
'■ com before ballot decisions are an
nounced. At present there is no
i policy on making remarks on the i
bal'ots, but Excom will probably de- j
termine procedure tonight.
"It's up to the students whether j
they want to make comments on [
the ballot," Luce said.

Foreign Scholarship section of their
ballot 'yes' or 'no'," Luce added.

! else written on them may be de- j
clared invalid by Excom."
