He was a quite dramatic cuss;
And when his girl would phone.
Her cooling love would cause a
fuss.
Then she would hear him moan:
"The gas-jet's on, farewell, my
love!"
• His slyness was a crime!*
For living just two flights above
She'd barely be in time.
Last night she phoned, the stories
go . . .
They say she turned him down:
It seems somehow he didn't
know She called from out of
town!
—Roger Chancy

Advicc to Young Skeletons:
Skeleton danced in a coffee pot,
Hummed a gay tune from the
burial plot,
Shuffled his feet to the music hot.
Cracked his skull to the top of
the pot,
Drowned in the grounds of the
coffee hot.
Never dance in a coffee pot
Without your galoshes.

Never haw planes or ocean linahs.
Or atom bombs, or other things

Which was very lucky for
