John L. Lewis and his United Mir.
Workers were fined 51.420.000 fc
criminal contempt of federal cour
today and a few hours later Lew»
moved to halt a protest strike v
miners that was sweeping the sot
coal fields.
The penalties were imposed o!
Lewis and the UMW by Federa
Judge Alan T. Goldsboroueh, wh
hinted strong'y that further pur.
ishment would be dealt out if tk
miners were still on strike Friday
More than 150.000 miners quit th
pits in protest within a few hour
after the fines were announced
Another 100.000 never had eor
back to work from the walkou
which led to the contempt cor
viction.
Lewis ordered them all back <
work late today in a telegram t
field union officials. It said:
"I do hope you will convey t
each member my wish that the;
immediately return to work."
The mine union chief apparent/
was taking no chances on Gol ?
borough's imposing new fines—e
even a jail sentence —if the wa'.k
out continued.
Assistant U.S. Attorney H. Gr?
ham Morison said later he urge<
postponement of the civil contemp
sentence so that
would have "an effective weapon
in case the miners continued the : .
strike.
