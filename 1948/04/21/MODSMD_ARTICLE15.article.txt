# President of Tuskegee Discusses Race Problem
## 
### AL HARBER 
Stanford has a college president
on its campus—not. however, as the
head of an educational institution,
but as a student.
He is Dr. F. D. Patterson, presi
dent of Tuskegee Institute, one of
the South's outstanding schools for
Negroes, who is taking advanced
study under Dr. William H. Cow
ley. Stanford's specialist in the field
of higher education.
Unassuming and frank when
questioned, Dr. Patterson is deeply
concerned with the racial problem
as it confronts America today. He
feels that ethnic minorities cannot
be considered as a race, however,
for races do not act as a whole.
DR. PATTERSON REFUTES the
claim that legislation cannot re
solve the race question. He main
tains that, although it is impossible
to grant equality through law, fair
er conditions can be legislated.
"The Negro." Dr. Patterson said,
"asks tor freedom of the individual
—the light to succeed as an indi
vidual without categorical distinc
tion. The challenge is not the elim
ination of differences, but an ap
preciation of them. Differences
should be accepted, he believes,
without qualification.
THE INSTITUTE with which Dr.
Patterson has been affiliated for 20
years, including 13 years as policy
maker, was founded in 1881. 10
years before Stanford admitted its
first students. With "education
fundamental to the democratic way
of life," he feels that education
should teach skill in living as a
basis for better citizenship.
The school offers courses in agri
culture. teacher training, home eco

nomics, mechanical arts, nursing,
veterinary medicine, and physical
education. A master's degree is of
fered in education, chemistry, and
home economics.
Dr. Patterson was born in Wash
ington, D.C., and grew up in Texas.
He holds a degree of Doctor of Vet
erinary Medicine from lowa State
Co'lege, a Ph.D. degree from Cor
nell University, and is the recipient
of a number of honorary degrees.
