# Candidates Present Views on Presidency
## 
### 
Final campaign statements from
candidates for ASSU president are
given below. Students will vote
today in a primary which will limit
to four the number of candidates
competing for the office.
GUS CHAVALAS —I would just
like to urge the voters to carefully
consider the candidates' platforms
and capabilities before voting. Re
member, our student government is
run by leadership and not by per
sonal affiliations.
GLEN FISHBACII — Judging all
issues on how student government
can become more united and effi
cient and so take more responsible
action is my permanent policy,
rather than temporary platform.
Voting shows student interest. De
spite choice, everyone should vote
today.
TED NORTON — Stanford stu
dents are capable of running their
own affairs and of doing their own
thinking. The function of student
government is to serve the stu
dents. not to regiment them. The
prime requisites for an ASSU pres
ident are experience and impar
tiality and I think that I can offer
both.
As to the "issues," I favor the
foreign scholarship plan and oppose
political action groups on campus.
WOODY HOOC.S—Stanford today
needs an all-out program to attract
high-caliber athletes, eating clubs

filling their important place in
campus life, early steps to achieve
the long-sought student union and
a new pavilion, consolidation in
student organizations, and liberal
ized women's social regulations. We
can obtain all of these things, and
more, with an aggressive campus
minded student government. I will
give you the leadership you need.
TOM DIAMOND —In favor of:
Foreign scholarships, more athletic
support, new union and pavilion.
Opposed to: Organized political
groups.
Qualifications: Administrative ex
perience as captain in A.U.S., Men's
Council, student police, former Vil
lage social chairman, hasher at
Student Union.
KEN CROFT —To be brief, I
strongly favor democratic political
freedom, will work for a strong
NSA, have a proposal to cut ad
ministrative red tape (structural
change), favor the foreign scholar
ship plan, and lastly am the only
absolutely independent candidate.
I espcially urge you to consider the

issues, candidates, and their expe- i
rience, then vote wisely.
ROY GASKIX —My stand on im- !
portant issues has already been i
made known through the? platforms
that I have distributed. It is my j
belief that the chief task of an !
ASSU president is to administrate :
wisely and impartially and carry !
out the wishes of the students I
themselves. If elected, I pledge
myself to carry out this duty.
Frank WollV. I want to: stop the
"office shuffling" in our student gov
ernment and encourage more stu
dents to run for office, to take a
straw vote on the political group
question with appropriate action to ■
follow, to establish a close relation- |
ship between president and student 1
body by a weekly column in The
Daily and a weekly radio program
on KSU.
GENE MARTIN—It is impossible '
to list a political platform in 50
words, especially when a candidate ;
believes the sought-after quality of |
a student body president is sound ;
discretion on student body desires
on small issues which are impos- \
sible to foresee in advance. Basi
cally my platform will be to sup- !
port ideas when student represen- ;
tatives assure me the majority so
desire.
Gordon Ness lias been unable to
appear at his speaking engagements
because he is undergoing treatment
at Palo Alto Hospital.
William Stephenson's name will 1
appear on the ballot, but he asks 1
that no one vote for him.

TED NORTON — Stanford stu
dents are capable of running their
own affairs and of doing their own
thinking. The function of student
government is to serve the stu
dents. not to regiment them. The
prime requisites for an ASSU pres

tiality and I think that I can offer
both.
As to the "issues," I favor the
foreign scholarship plan and oppose
political action groups on campus.
WOODY HOOC.S—Stanford today

high-caliber athletes, eating clubs

filling their important place in

ized women's social regulations. We
can obtain all of these things, and
more, with an aggressive campus
minded student government. I will
give you the leadership you need.
