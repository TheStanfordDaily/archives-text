# CAMPUS OPINION
## There's No Alternative 
### 
To the Editor:
Today the Stanford student body decides the fate of the much discussed
Foreign Scholarship Plan. Several little known and little appreciated data
should be made available to all those who, by voting on the proposal
tomorow, will either kill the present plan or sanction its operation.
Alternative plans for spending our ASSU funds have been suggested,
only two of which are worthy of comment and consideration. First, the
new Union; and second, the Tresidder memorial.
1. If our $9,000 is put into the Union fund, it will not be used in the
most effective manner. Any amount this small when compared with the
total amount which will probably run from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 is so
insignificant as to be useless except in an extremely long range view.
The largest student contribution to the fund comes from the $1 which
is taken from each student's tuition per quarter. In addition, the surplus
from the present Union is substantial. If our Union js built, the money
of necessity must come from outside sources in large sums. Let's put our
money where it can be most effective!
2. A student committee is now working with the Board of Trustees on
the memorial to be dedicated to Dr. Tresidder. In all likelihood, it will
lake considerable time to decide what the memorial will be—a Union, a
living unit, scholarships, or perhaps something else. The alumni, the
administration, the Board of Trustees—all of these groups must agree
before any memorial is announced. The decision may not be reached
this quarter; just what the memorial is will probably influence how
much we, the students, contribute to it.
Let us not allow these alternative proposals to warp our judgment on
the merits of the Foreign Scholarship Plan nr sway our opinion on just
how our money should be spent!

A Foreign Student Speaks
To the Editor:
After the discussion which has been going on in The Daily about the
Foreign Scholarship Plan, I, as a foreign student, feel that I have no
right to remain silent any longer. The students have been told that they
are going to vote on an important financial issue, and that a moral issue
is involved also. I would like to emphasize the latter, and tell from
personal experience how important it. is, to make it clear and certain
that any such efforts are fully appreciated by the recipients. My own
experience here has been invaluable. From this point of view, a tourist
trip is a waste of time and money, but a year among the young genera
tion of a foreign country is priceless. Not only is knowledge increased,
but also values and ideas, whether they are changed or confirmed, are
broadened and acquire more strength and weight.
But personal experience accounts for only one side of the question. The
world as a whole is bound to benefit by such action. To speak the truth,
this action should be ultimately undertaken by governments on a very
large scale. From a broad point of view, we must remember that inter
national education is the first step toward building up the world public
opinion, a sine qua nun condition of a world democracy. One cannot
emphasize too much the virtue and power of education—while democracies
seem to forget it sometimes the totalitarian states never do. The great
French minister of education, Jules Ferry, used to say proudly: "I am
in charge of the department of the souls," and he would have a third
of the nation's budget devoted to educational purposes. Stanford students
today will share in the responsibility for the world "department of the
souls." It is a great event, and they should give all their attention to it.
MARCEL HIST
A Definite Selection Plan
To the Editor:
Claims have been made that the Foreign Scholarship Plan has no effec
tive means for selecting the foreign students to be brought to Stanford.
Actually, a thoroughly organized plan does exist and is ready to be put
into operation immediately.
Names of applicants will be obtained from UNESCO, the Institute of
International Education, and from acquaintances of Stanford students and
professors. Hie first two are international organizations in contact with
every major university in the world. The International Institute of Educa
tion has complete information on every foreign student applying to
study in an American university. A typical record of one of these students
is now available in the ASSU office for anyone to see.
After all applications are received, Dean Kimpton and Dr. Winbigler
will pass on the academic eligibility of each student.
Representatives from each interested living group, working with the
Foreign Scholarship Committee, will then select a foreign student and an
alternate for their house. Selection will be made as carefully as possible
on the basis of the student's purpose for coming, his command of the
English language, his references and past record, and his potential lead
ership ability.
The selection method is felt to be as accurate and thorough as possible
and has been set up in this manner to make certain that the interests
and desires of all persons concerned will be considered carefully.

JSot a Bookkeeping Question
To the Editor:
Roble Corridor 2-C undoubtedly enjoys the highest esteem of our entire
Stanford family, but their equivocating letter of April 20 appealing for
some "modified plan" or other serves only to prevent the forthright and
overwhelming approval of the $9,000 foreign scholarship plan.
These scholarships are the most constructive immediate aspect of world
citizenship and true international understanding that Stanford students
can enter into beyond our own ivory towers.
Roble 2-C, please don't vote in favor of modified plans. That type of
thinking and voting leads only to a modified United Nations, modified
democracy, modified ethical principles, and modified lives for the peoples
of all nations.
The question is really not essentially shall Stanford students expend
$".1000 or only $4,500 so as to maintain some sacrosanct accounting pro
cedure, bilt rather do we earnestly want to invite and assist students from
other countries to come to the United States and come to understand us,
as well as to give vis enhanced opportunities of knowing them and their
countries in a leal atmosphere of understanding and cooperation.
