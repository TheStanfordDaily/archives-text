Election Fever
WASHINGTON, D. C.â€”The quadrennial crop of
oratory, campaign buttons, and political fanfare is
bustin' out all over. The national conventions are
just around the corner.
A unique and colorful feature of the American
scene, these nominating conclaves have been mag
nets for the party faithful since 1832 when the first
presidential candidate was designated by such
methods.
This year all roads for the two major parlies
lead to Philadelphia. There the Republicans fore
gather on June 21 to name their ticket. In the
same convention hall the Democrats will get under
way on July 11.
The ensuing campaign will be settled on the earliest
date a national election can fall. The first Tuesday
after the first Monday this November, is November 2.
The contest will be the 24th between Democrats
and Republicans since the present Republican Party
took form in 1854. Fourteen winners have been Re
publicans, nine have been Democrats.
Only three times before has one city played host
to both major-party conventions, notes the National
Geographic Society. The years were 1884, 1932,
and 1!)44. In each year, the city was Chicago, and
the successful candidate was (he Democrat.
Chicago, hub of transportation lines from all parts
of the country, has hosted more conventions than the
next four cities combined. Seven of 12 Chicago
nominated Republicans have been elected, starting
with Lincoln in 1860. Five of seven Chicago-nomi
nated Democrats won elections, Grover Cleveland
being the first and second, Franklin D. Roosevelt
the third, fourth, and fifth.
By holding both conventions in 1948, Philadelphia
takes clear title to second convention city from St
Louis. Three presidents have been named at five past
Philadelphia conventions. St. Louis' score is two
winners in five tries. Conventions have been held
west to San Francisco, south to Houston, north to
Minneapolis, east to New York City.
Early aspirants for American offices announced
their own candidacies or were named by groups
of leading citizens. From such nominating cau
cuses, the national conventions developed.
A simple majority of delegates nominates in each
party. Prior to 1936, however, the Democrats re
quired a two-thirds vote to nominate. In addition,
the party's rules provide twice as many delegates
as the Republicans use. Consequently, longer ses
sions and more ballots have been the rule at Demo
cratic conventions.
