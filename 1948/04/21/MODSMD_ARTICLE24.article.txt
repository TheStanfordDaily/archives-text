# U.S. Sponsors Cal Atom Research
## 
### 
BERKELEY (UP) —The Atomic Energy Commis
sion has agreed to sponsor exploration of the nucleus
of the atom at the University of California for an
other four years. University President Robert G.
Sproul has announced.
The new contract, which becomes effective July 1,
is an extension of an agreement under which
university's radiation laboratory has been operating
since May 1, 1943. The laboratory was the birthplace
of the atomic bomb and the atom-smashing cyclo
tron.
"This contract indicates the intent of the Atomic
Energy Commission in sustained fundamental re
search and in the training of graduate students,"
Sproul said.
"The general welfare of the people cannot rest
only upon the holding of knowledge we already
possess." he said. "It depends upon the discovery of
new knowledge through the exploration of the tools
which have been presented to us in atomic research."
The contract calls for the operation of the giant
4,000-ton cyclotron which has greatly expanded
man's knowledge of the atomic nucleus since it was
completed a little more than a year ago. The com
mission also will continue to support the construction
and operation of the synchrotron, linear accelerator,
and the 60-inch medical cyclotron in the Crocker
Radiation Laboratory. Provisions also are made for
continued biological and medical research at the
Conner Medical Laboratory.
Sproul noted that "laboratory facilities required
for the pursuit of knowledge in atomic energy are

of such a magnitude that they could not well he
provided except by the cooperative support of all
the people of the country."
He said the contract terms would enable the uni
versity "to balance the applied scientific program un
dertaken by the university at Los Alamos, N. M.,
with a broad scientific program on the Berkeley
campus."
The government actually began to sponsor re
search in the radiation laboratory on Jan. 1. 1942.
The Manhattan Engineer District, which produced
the atomic bomb, took over sponsorship in May,
194:5. and a method was worked out for the electro
magnetic separation of unanium-235 which was
later applied at Oak Ridge. Tenn.
In 1945 the radiation laboratory quit concentrating
on war research and began a reconversion to its tra
ditional role in the fundamental exploration of the
atom and searches for new information in biological
and medical fields.
Laboratory operations are directed by Prof. Ernest
O. Lawrence, Nobel laureate and inventor of the
cyclotron. The Atomic Energy Commission is repre
sented by A. P. Pollman, area manager of the
Berkeley office.
In 1924, John W. Davis was nominated on the 103 rd
ballot to end a nine-day deadlock between McAdoo
and A 1 Smith. In 1920. James M. Cox scored on the
44th ballot; in 1912 it was Woodrow Wilson on the
4(ith. In 1868. Horatio Seymour, unrnentioned for 21
ballots, won on the 22nd. In 1860, Stephen Douglas
was named only when the convention adjourned to
Baltimore after a 57-ballot deadlock in Charleston,
South Carolina.
For the Republicans, Harding was compromise
victor on the 10th ballot in 1920 at Chicago, where
Illinois Governor Lownden and General Leonard
Wood had been the standoffs. Only once has the GOP
required more than 10 ballots.

In 1945 the radiation laboratory quit concentrating
on war research and began a reconversion to its tra
ditional role in the fundamental exploration of the
atom and searches for new information in biological
and medical fields.
Laboratory operations are directed by Prof. Ernest
O. Lawrence, Nobel laureate and inventor of the

In 1924, John W. Davis was nominated on the 103 rd
ballot to end a nine-day deadlock between McAdoo
and A 1 Smith. In 1920. James M. Cox scored on the
44th ballot; in 1912 it was Woodrow Wilson on the
4(ith. In 1868. Horatio Seymour, unrnentioned for 21
ballots, won on the 22nd. In 1860, Stephen Douglas
was named only when the convention adjourned to
Baltimore after a 57-ballot deadlock in Charleston,
South Carolina.
For the Republicans, Harding was compromise
victor on the 10th ballot in 1920 at Chicago, where
Illinois Governor Lownden and General Leonard
Wood had been the standoffs. Only once has the GOP
required more than 10 ballots.
BERKELEY (UP) —The Atomic Energy Commis
sion has agreed to sponsor exploration of the nucleus
of the atom at the University of California for an
other four years. University President Robert G.
Sproul has announced.
The new contract, which becomes effective July 1,
is an extension of an agreement under which
university's radiation laboratory has been operating
since May 1, 1943. The laboratory was the birthplace
of the atomic bomb and the atom-smashing cyclo
tron.
"This contract indicates the intent of the Atomic
Energy Commission in sustained fundamental re
search and in the training of graduate students,"
Sproul said.
"The general welfare of the people cannot rest
only upon the holding of knowledge we already
possess." he said. "It depends upon the discovery of
new knowledge through the exploration of the tools
which have been presented to us in atomic research."
The contract calls for the operation of the giant
4,000-ton cyclotron which has greatly expanded
man's knowledge of the atomic nucleus since it was
completed a little more than a year ago. The com
mission also will continue to support the construction
and operation of the synchrotron, linear accelerator,
and the 60-inch medical cyclotron in the Crocker
Radiation Laboratory. Provisions also are made for
continued biological and medical research at the
Conner Medical Laboratory.
Sproul noted that "laboratory facilities required
for the pursuit of knowledge in atomic energy are

of such a magnitude that they could not well he
provided except by the cooperative support of all
the people of the country."
He said the contract terms would enable the uni
versity "to balance the applied scientific program un
dertaken by the university at Los Alamos, N. M.,
with a broad scientific program on the Berkeley
campus."
The government actually began to sponsor re
search in the radiation laboratory on Jan. 1. 1942.
The Manhattan Engineer District, which produced
the atomic bomb, took over sponsorship in May,
194:5. and a method was worked out for the electro
magnetic separation of unanium-235 which was
later applied at Oak Ridge. Tenn.
