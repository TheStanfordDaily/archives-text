## History 1948

Millions of children at this moment are dying ol
slow starvation, disease, cold, and neglect. They need
lood, and they need all the love and human interest
that world leaders in their non-political moments
can spare. What is their immediate future? The In
ternational Children's Emergency Fund in its last

report to the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations tells
their story in two ways:
1. Rickets, stunted growth and
development, bone tuberculosis be
cause of diet deficiencies, and in
fant mortality are shockingly on
the increase; 2. the flow of as
sistance to countries "can become
large and sustained" only if na
tions, voluntary agencies, and in
dividuals will give the fund their
generous support. Implicit in the

report was that if the Children's Emergency Fund
is to survive, nations must do what must be done—
give.
Almost from its inception this agency has been
crippled by lack of support. An estimated 100.000.000
children are in urgent need of help. It was originally
hoped to reach at least 20,000,000 of them in the first
year of operations with $200,000,000 worth of milk,
basic foods, and medicines. That proposed budget
was cut to a theoretical $70,000.000 the United States
promising to contribute $40,000,000 if other nations
come in with the balance.
The present plight of the fund is an international
disgrace. In the words of Dr. Oswaldo Aranha of
Brazil, president of the general assembly, the agen
cy's resources are "pitifully small"—some $38,000,000,
nearly one-third of it transferred from UNRRA.
What Dr. Aranha failed to mention was that Brazil
was prepared to contribute. Among the countries
undamaged by the war, both Brazil and Argentina
supported the report apparently with their hearts
and their words but not with critically needed mon
eys. And time is running out.
The United States has made one small initial con
tribution of $15,000,000 and the fear is that our own
promised balance of $25,000,000 will be shifted into
"available funds" for general stop-gap aid instead of
saving it for the Children's Fund. The United Nations
has no choice but to respond to the cry of children
everywhere, and answer that cry with enough food
and enough money.
