## Bull Session 
### 
The guy I laughingly refer to as my roommate
was rifling through my bureau the other day, trying
to find some of the socks I ve been stealing from him
all year, and he happened to come across my dishon
orable discharge from high school.
Gad, what a lot of pleasant memories were brought
back by the old sheepskin—well, it wasn't exactly
a sheepskin. In fact, I did so much crying about
my grades that they printed my diploma on a
Kleenex.
What a swell school that was! We had some 1700-
odd students, and when I say odd, 1 mean odd!
I didn't get along too well in high school. It
wasn't the school that I hated, it was just the prin
cipal of the thing. My teachers couldn't seem
to understand that I came from a extremely tem
peramental family. One of my uncles was very
high-strung—the sheriff caught him stealing a horse.
The principal claimed the school had a faculty of
80, but none of my teachers looked a day over 75.
The instructors never seemed to trust me; they al

ways thought I had something up my sleeve besides
my arm. (I did; my roommate's socks.)
I was very athletic in high school. While I was a
member of {he school crew, we won the state
championship in 1942, 1943, and 1945. In 1944 they
found out where we were hiding the outboard
motor.
The boxing coach wanted me to be on his team,
but I was too emotional to fight regularly. On sec
ond thought, "emotional" isn't exactly the right word
to use here. After most of my fights, I was carried
away! But in some of my bouts, they didn't even
get a chance to carry me away. I was knocked out
of the ring so many times that I was the only fighter
in the school with three hours flying time.
My girl friend played left tackle on the football
team. With her in the lineup, we had the only
T-formation on the coast complete with a tea-bag.
Well, I've got to stop this reminiscing, or I'll be
late for my meeting with the Bored of Education.
I'm chairman.
