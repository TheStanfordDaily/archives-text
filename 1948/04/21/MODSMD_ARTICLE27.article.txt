# Spend $9,050 or Not? Students Decide Today
## 
### BY TOM MARTZLOFF BOB COATE 
Now that the figures used in my
earlier articles have been confirmed
by yesterday's front page Daily edi
torial, I would like to summarize for
you my thoughts concerning today's
ballot proposal. Consider them crit
ically.
1. I agree that me must do our
best toward backing he foreign
scholarship idea, hut that "best"
must be judged by this criterion:
a. Amount of current funds avail
able for investment.
b. The experimental aspects of
the $9,050 proposal in relation to
the purpose to be achieved.
c. Other considered investments
(i.e. Tresidder Memorial and New
Union fund.
2. Unquestionably the present pro
posal is an experiment. Until it is
tried, how can we estimate its ef
fectiveness? I favor spending a sub
stantial amount to launch this ex
periment, but less than 95.4 per cent
of our current excess. Will not less
than 10 student equally well fulfill
the purpose of *'pointing the way"
to other schools?
3. I feel a contribution to a Tresid
der Memorial and the New Union
fund warrant more than 4.6 per cent
of our current excess. If we who
set up the Union Fund fail to con
tribute substantially to it, can we
expect the obligation to be fulfilled
in future years? In short, we can
accomplish the purpose of this For
eign Student Scholarship Plan and
in addition satisfy these obligations.
We can do so by a more moderate
appropriation for Foreign Scholar
ships.
Since it is possible that ballots
with any notations other than the
"yes" or "no" provided for may be
invalidated, simply vote NO on to
day's proposal; then demand of Ex
com that a modified plan be sub
mitted.

Well, this is it. We've heard most
of the points pro and con. Today
we vote on the Foreign Scholarship
Plan. We know that it involves
budgeting $9,050, and we know that
the implications that this will break
us ai*e nonsense.
In all the talk of a dollar here
and a dollar there, let's hope the
idea of the plan has not been for
gotten.
The aim is simple: to make com
munication between minds possible
and to establish understanding by
providing a common ground of ex
perience.
The plan is this:
To bring 10 European student
leaders to Stanford for one year,
beginning next fall. In doing this
we will make a positive contribu
tion to world understanding in our
own right and will be showing the
way to other schools.
THIS IS AN investment in friend
ship, an investment which will bring
us more than we give. We cannot
separate the quantitative and quali
tative elements. We know that the
more students we bring, the greater
will be the benefits.
Certain elements give the number
10. The University has expressed
its willingness to match up to 5
ASSU scholarships. Living groups
have volunteered accommodations
for 13 students. The ASSU has $13,-
000 in unbudgeted funds from the
current year alone.
Thus, the Executive Committee,
to take fullest advantage of the of
fei's of the University and living
groups, and to make the wisest fi
nancial decision, voted 10 as the
number.
Why 10 European students? Ths
university populations of European
countries consist of those who will
be the leaders of their countries in
a few short years. The civil servants,
the government officials, the leaders
in industry, the men and women
who will shape the policies of their
countries are*now in European uni
versities.
As students at Stanford University
we are in a unique position. We
can invite some of those people to
come here to live and study with
us for a year. As students we will
share common experiences; in the
years to come we will more nearly
understand one another.
TIIE VERY FACT of our offer will
display to European universities that
we are aware of our fortunate posi

! tion and wish to share with them.
We wish to bring students who
| otherwise would have no way of
coming to the United States.
Those who are presenting the plan
know that it is only one of the many
j things we could do to help estab
lish these bonds of friendship and
I understanding.
IT WOULD BE even more desir
| able if every year we could bring
students from all over the world
to Stanford. It would be better if
we could expand our activities into
all the possible ways that would
help people know each other better.
We have to start someplace.
There are only a certain number
of things for which we are fitted.
: There are the practical limitations
which have been considered. Here
is something which falls well within
our ability and for which we are
particularly suited.
The Foreign Scholarship Plan is
I set up and ready to go the minute
| the ballots are counted. It is a prac

tical investment for future security
and, no matter how small, at least
it is a contribution toward world
understanding.

in future years? In short, we can
accomplish the purpose of this For
eign Student Scholarship Plan and
in addition satisfy these obligations.
We can do so by a more moderate
appropriation for Foreign Scholar
ships.
Since it is possible that ballots
with any notations other than the
"yes" or "no" provided for may be
invalidated, simply vote NO on to
day's proposal; then demand of Ex
com that a modified plan be sub
mitted.

Well, this is it. We've heard most
of the points pro and con. Today
we vote on the Foreign Scholarship
Plan. We know that it involves
budgeting $9,050, and we know that
the implications that this will break
us ai*e nonsense.
In all the talk of a dollar here
and a dollar there, let's hope the
idea of the plan has not been for
gotten.
The aim is simple: to make com
munication between minds possible
and to establish understanding by
providing a common ground of ex
perience.
The plan is this:
To bring 10 European student
leaders to Stanford for one year,
beginning next fall. In doing this
we will make a positive contribu
tion to world understanding in our
own right and will be showing the
way to other schools.
THIS IS AN investment in friend
ship, an investment which will bring
us more than we give. We cannot
separate the quantitative and quali
tative elements. We know that the
more students we bring, the greater
will be the benefits.
Certain elements give the number
10. The University has expressed
its willingness to match up to 5
ASSU scholarships. Living groups
have volunteered accommodations
for 13 students. The ASSU has $13,-
000 in unbudgeted funds from the
current year alone.
Thus, the Executive Committee,
to take fullest advantage of the of
fei's of the University and living
groups, and to make the wisest fi
nancial decision, voted 10 as the
number.
Why 10 European students? Ths
university populations of European
countries consist of those who will
be the leaders of their countries in
a few short years. The civil servants,
the government officials, the leaders
in industry, the men and women
who will shape the policies of their
countries are*now in European uni
versities.
As students at Stanford University
we are in a unique position. We
can invite some of those people to
come here to live and study with
us for a year. As students we will
share common experiences; in the
years to come we will more nearly
understand one another.
TIIE VERY FACT of our offer will
display to European universities that
we are aware of our fortunate posi

! tion and wish to share with them.
We wish to bring students who
| otherwise would have no way of
coming to the United States.
Those who are presenting the plan
know that it is only one of the many
j things we could do to help estab
lish these bonds of friendship and
I understanding.
IT WOULD BE even more desir
| able if every year we could bring
students from all over the world
to Stanford. It would be better if
we could expand our activities into
all the possible ways that would
help people know each other better.
We have to start someplace.
There are only a certain number
of things for which we are fitted.
: There are the practical limitations
which have been considered. Here
is something which falls well within
our ability and for which we are
particularly suited.
The Foreign Scholarship Plan is
I set up and ready to go the minute
| the ballots are counted. It is a prac

tical investment for future security
and, no matter how small, at least
it is a contribution toward world
understanding.
Now that the figures used in my
earlier articles have been confirmed
by yesterday's front page Daily edi
torial, I would like to summarize for
you my thoughts concerning today's
ballot proposal. Consider them crit
ically.
1. I agree that me must do our
best toward backing he foreign
scholarship idea, hut that "best"
must be judged by this criterion:
a. Amount of current funds avail
able for investment.
b. The experimental aspects of
the $9,050 proposal in relation to
the purpose to be achieved.
c. Other considered investments
(i.e. Tresidder Memorial and New
Union fund.
2. Unquestionably the present pro
posal is an experiment. Until it is
tried, how can we estimate its ef
fectiveness? I favor spending a sub
stantial amount to launch this ex
periment, but less than 95.4 per cent
of our current excess. Will not less
than 10 student equally well fulfill
the purpose of *'pointing the way"
to other schools?
3. I feel a contribution to a Tresid
der Memorial and the New Union
fund warrant more than 4.6 per cent
of our current excess. If we who
set up the Union Fund fail to con
tribute substantially to it, can we
expect the obligation to be fulfilled
in future years? In short, we can
accomplish the purpose of this For
eign Student Scholarship Plan and
in addition satisfy these obligations.
We can do so by a more moderate

separate the quantitative and quali
tative elements. We know that the
more students we bring, the greater
will be the benefits.
Certain elements give the number
10. The University has expressed
its willingness to match up to 5
ASSU scholarships. Living groups
have volunteered accommodations
for 13 students. The ASSU has $13,-
000 in unbudgeted funds from the
current year alone.
Thus, the Executive Committee,
to take fullest advantage of the of
fei's of the University and living
groups, and to make the wisest fi
nancial decision, voted 10 as the
number.
Why 10 European students? Ths
university populations of European
countries consist of those who will
be the leaders of their countries in
a few short years. The civil servants,
the government officials, the leaders
in industry, the men and women
who will shape the policies of their
countries are*now in European uni
versities.
As students at Stanford University
we are in a unique position. We
can invite some of those people to
come here to live and study with
us for a year. As students we will
share common experiences; in the
years to come we will more nearly
understand one another.
TIIE VERY FACT of our offer will
display to European universities that
we are aware of our fortunate posi

! tion and wish to share with them.
We wish to bring students who
| otherwise would have no way of
coming to the United States.
Those who are presenting the plan
know that it is only one of the many
j things we could do to help estab
lish these bonds of friendship and
I understanding.
IT WOULD BE even more desir
| able if every year we could bring
students from all over the world
to Stanford. It would be better if
we could expand our activities into
all the possible ways that would
help people know each other better.
We have to start someplace.
There are only a certain number
of things for which we are fitted.
: There are the practical limitations
which have been considered. Here
is something which falls well within
our ability and for which we are
particularly suited.
The Foreign Scholarship Plan is
I set up and ready to go the minute
| the ballots are counted. It is a prac

tical investment for future security
and, no matter how small, at least
it is a contribution toward world
understanding.
Now that the figures used in my
earlier articles have been confirmed
by yesterday's front page Daily edi
torial, I would like to summarize for
you my thoughts concerning today's
ballot proposal. Consider them crit
ically.
1. I agree that me must do our
best toward backing he foreign
scholarship idea, hut that "best"
must be judged by this criterion:
a. Amount of current funds avail
able for investment.
b. The experimental aspects of
the $9,050 proposal in relation to
the purpose to be achieved.
c. Other considered investments
(i.e. Tresidder Memorial and New
Union fund.
2. Unquestionably the present pro
posal is an experiment. Until it is
tried, how can we estimate its ef
fectiveness? I favor spending a sub
stantial amount to launch this ex
periment, but less than 95.4 per cent
of our current excess. Will not less
than 10 student equally well fulfill
the purpose of *'pointing the way"
to other schools?
3. I feel a contribution to a Tresid
der Memorial and the New Union
fund warrant more than 4.6 per cent
of our current excess. If we who
set up the Union Fund fail to con
tribute substantially to it, can we
expect the obligation to be fulfilled
in future years? In short, we can
accomplish the purpose of this For
eign Student Scholarship Plan and
in addition satisfy these obligations.
We can do so by a more moderate
appropriation for Foreign Scholar
ships.
Since it is possible that ballots
with any notations other than the
"yes" or "no" provided for may be
invalidated, simply vote NO on to
day's proposal; then demand of Ex
com that a modified plan be sub
mitted.

Well, this is it. We've heard most
of the points pro and con. Today
we vote on the Foreign Scholarship
Plan. We know that it involves
budgeting $9,050, and we know that
the implications that this will break
us ai*e nonsense.
In all the talk of a dollar here
and a dollar there, let's hope the
idea of the plan has not been for
gotten.
The aim is simple: to make com
munication between minds possible
and to establish understanding by
providing a common ground of ex
perience.
The plan is this:
To bring 10 European student
leaders to Stanford for one year,
beginning next fall. In doing this
we will make a positive contribu
tion to world understanding in our
own right and will be showing the
way to other schools.
THIS IS AN investment in friend
ship, an investment which will bring
us more than we give. We cannot
separate the quantitative and quali
tative elements. We know that the
more students we bring, the greater
will be the benefits.
