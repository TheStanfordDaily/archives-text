# Vote YES on Foreign Scholarships
## 
### 
Stanford has a chance to get out of its tra
ditional ivory tower today. We're in a position
to make a real contribution to international
understanding and world peace—a unique
contribution that can't be accomplished just
as well by dollars from Congress. We—all of
us here—can provide something no one else
can—if enough of us vote "yes" on the For
eign Scholarship Plan today.
Excom set up a committee which studied
the problem over many months. They then
voted 11-2 in favor of the scholarship plan.
Excom is well informed; they considered all
alternatives—including a modified plan. Isn't
such an overwhelming vote on their part
worthy of consideration when you vote?
Here are a few other facts to be considered:
1. The $9,000 figure is a maximum figure. If
all 10 students come from the most distant
country, incur maximum transportation costs,
etc., we will have to pay $9,050. Otherwise
(and probably) it will be less.
2. The plan will not endanger the financial
structure of the ASSU. In addition to the

money already in the hands of ASSU organ
izations, $2,000 has been budgeted for them
for the remaining six weeks of the quarter.
Even if this is spent and the plan costs the
maximum, there will still be $425 left over to
go into the $22,000 ASSU surplus fund.
3. Modifying or defeating the scholarship
plan will not help the proposed Union or
Tresidder Memorial funds. Either will require
an enormous amount of money—s4,ooo or
even $9,050 won't do much more than buy a
few extra fixtures. Already approximately
$50,000 a year is going into the Union fund.
Nine thousand dollars is not much money if
you consider it's only $1.25 per student. How
much did you spend last Saturday night?
Most important of all, this is something we
can really do! Instead of talk, we'll have action
now and concrete, comforting results in a few
years. Ten foreign students here will start
the ball rolling, other colleges will follow suit.
Five or six foreign students would be lost in
the shuffle.
v ote "yes" on the Foreign Scholarship Plan!

Stanford has a chance to get out of its tra
ditional ivory tower today. We're in a position
to make a real contribution to international
understanding and world peace—a unique
contribution that can't be accomplished just
as well by dollars from Congress. We—all of
us here—can provide something no one else
can—if enough of us vote "yes" on the For
eign Scholarship Plan today.
Excom set up a committee which studied
the problem over many months. They then
voted 11-2 in favor of the scholarship plan.
Excom is well informed; they considered all
alternatives—including a modified plan. Isn't
such an overwhelming vote on their part
worthy of consideration when you vote?
Here are a few other facts to be considered:
1. The $9,000 figure is a maximum figure. If
all 10 students come from the most distant
country, incur maximum transportation costs,
etc., we will have to pay $9,050. Otherwise
(and probably) it will be less.
2. The plan will not endanger the financial
structure of the ASSU. In addition to the

money already in the hands of ASSU organ
izations, $2,000 has been budgeted for them
for the remaining six weeks of the quarter.
Even if this is spent and the plan costs the
maximum, there will still be $425 left over to
go into the $22,000 ASSU surplus fund.
3. Modifying or defeating the scholarship
plan will not help the proposed Union or
Tresidder Memorial funds. Either will require
an enormous amount of money—s4,ooo or
even $9,050 won't do much more than buy a
few extra fixtures. Already approximately
$50,000 a year is going into the Union fund.
Nine thousand dollars is not much money if
you consider it's only $1.25 per student. How
much did you spend last Saturday night?
Most important of all, this is something we
can really do! Instead of talk, we'll have action
now and concrete, comforting results in a few
years. Ten foreign students here will start
the ball rolling, other colleges will follow suit.
Five or six foreign students would be lost in
the shuffle.
v ote "yes" on the Foreign Scholarship Plan!
