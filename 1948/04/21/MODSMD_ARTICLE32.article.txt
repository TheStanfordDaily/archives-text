# Mermen Favored Over COP
## 
### 
The Farm swimming team cli
maxes its nonconterence season this
afternoon with an away-from-home
meet with College of the Pacific.
C'omptition will get under way at 4
in COP's varsity pool.
Although the Bengals hold wins
over Cal and UCLA, they are not
conceded much of a chance in to
day's meet.
The COP swimmers nosed out the
perpetually weak Bruins by only a
112 ingle point, 38 to 37, while their
early season win over the Berkeley
112 ranch came while three of Cal's
top stars were elsewhere. Cal sub
sequently gathered together a full
team and trounced the Bengal squad,
48 to 27, in a return meet.
With a number of its performers

beginning to hit midseason form, the
Indian team turned in a lop-sided
victory over the strong San Fran
cisco Olympic Club Saturday. If the
Farm swimmers continue their fast
pace, they shouldn't have much
trouble with Coach Chris Kjeldsen's
Pacific team this afternoon.
Pacific's top stars are middle
distance ace Don Driggs and diver
Jack Bronfin. Bronfin holds a dou
ble win over the highly-touted Cal
diving corps, and should be rated
as a distinct threat in the spring
board event. Driggs, however, will
probably have to be content with a
third place in the 220 and 440.
