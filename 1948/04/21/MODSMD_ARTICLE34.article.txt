# Hurlers Take Spotlight In Major's Play
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 20 (UP)—The
pitchers had it over the home run
hitter today—but not by very much.
Led by the incomparable Bobby
Feller and that little gent with the
elastic arm, Murry Dickson, the
headlines belonged to the hurlers.
The other pitchers who shone were
Emil Leonard, the old bulgin' Bel
gian. Rip Sewell, the blooper ball
expert, Hal Newhouser, who looked
like he was ready to stage a come
back. and Sid Hudson.
Feller topped them all with his
casual two-hit. 4 to 0 triumph over
the Browns at Cleveland before the
largest, opening day crowd in major
league history, 73.163.
Dickson, who didn't win a game
until mid-June of last season,
pitched the Cardinals to a 4 to 0
victory over the Reds at St. Louis
and. though he gave up 10 hits, be
was a miser whenever his shutout
was threatened.
Fmil Leonard, who won 17 games
with the Phils last season, pitched
a six-hit, 3 to 1 triumph over the
Braves at Philadelphia. Eddie Mil
ler, the Phils' new shortstop who
has a talent for hitting homers in
the spring, put the Phils in front
with a sixth-inning round tripper.
