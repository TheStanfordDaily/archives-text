# COP Downs Card Baseballers 13 to 10 in Free-Hitting Contest
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Stanford's sinking baseball club stagaered to its third straight
loss yesterday afternoon, as College of Pacific thumped out a
footballish 13 to 10 victory on tne Sunken Diamond.
Card hurler Ed Shive tossed the first pitch, but it wasn't until
31 hits, 23 runs, and five pitchers later that Ted Nell popped

up to second base to end the game.
Io say the least, it was a loosely
played contest.
FD SIIIN'F. in making his debut
with the Indians, handled his pitch
ing chores with a respectable air for
almost five innings. But when he
started to let his 5 to 1 lead slip
away, Harry Wolters sent Charlie
Be!! to the rescue. Shive had walked
two men to start the fifth and was
in trouble, but Bell couldn't pull
him out. COP put together 3 runs
and was leading 6 to 5 by the end
of the inning.
FRANK LABRUM relieved Bell in
the sixth, and finished out the game.
Alter blowing its initial lead, Stan
ford never led again. The locals got
close in the bottom of the eighth
when they brought the count to 10
to 9, but the Tigers came up with
three runs in the ninth to win going
away.
Tiger hurler Jim McFarland was
the game's winning pitcher. He
came in for starter Stan MeWilliams
in the fourth. McFarland was in
trouble several times, but he man
aged to stick for the win.
The Cards played one of their
worst games to date. The infield
played dropsie all afternoon, and al
though the Cards drove out 15 hits,
pooi' baserunning and errors in the
field wasted most of them.
Harry Wolters tried a new com
bination yesterday when he inserted
George Sloat into right field and
Dave Melton at second base. He also
juggled his batting order by moving
Sloat to second spot, Cole to third,
and Brownson to eighth.
Leadoff man Ted Nell led Stanford
hitting with three hits in six trips
to the plate. Safeties were a dime
a dozen yesterday, however, as
Sloat. Cole, Nava, Alquist. and Mel
ton all picked up pairs.
Blasting Bob Nava got the nicest
hit of the day when he lined a triple
to deep right. Bill Chalmers, Bob
Brown, and Hal Tormic of COP col
lected three hits apiece 1o pace the
visitors.
Charlie Bell was the losing hurler.
