# Aspirants Tell Aims For Vice-Presidency
## 
### 
Vice - presidential candidates tell
their aims in statements printed
below.
ERLINE ANDERSON —I believe
the most important part of the
vice-president's job is her influence
on Excom decisions, both as assist
ant to the president and as social
chairman for the University. I will
make this influence an active one.
a real effort to invigorate student
government.
MARILYN JANECK—The more
intimate, small, and well - planned
type of open house sponsored last
quarter by the fraternities was very
popular and well attended. I pro
pose that this kind of entertain
ment be encouraged by other living
groups such as the Women's Row
houses, some of the eating clubs, or
a few Union units.
■MEREDITH "MIMI" DUNLAP —
As social co-ordinator I'd like to
see greater on-campus integration
of student units, with the Village
having its share of "closed elates";
more informal get-togethers to con
tinue the meeting of the student
body past the freshman year. My
Excom vote would be representa
tive since I have lived in every dis

tvict on campus plus a quarter off
campus.
B. J. DENNING —Among the
candidates, aren't you looking for
one with ideas, interest, c-rod expe
rience of high quality? three
points are my platform. Because
I have worked with many varied
groups. I believe I could actively
carry out one of my main interests:
a far-sighted extra-curricular pro
gram co-ordinated to center sociai
activities on the campus, rather
than the present trend away from
the campus.
Nan Shepherd. A good flock needs
a wise shepherd. Through my past
experience as junior class secretary,
Roble sponsor. Rally Com member,
and in other activities, I feel that
I will be able to represent you wisely
and conscientiously. This job re
quires acceptance of responsibility
and an active interest in all campus
affairs. Let me assure you I have
both.
