A fast polo match, when the
sportsmen play it to the limit, is
a rugged, hard-riding game, ideal
lor the spectators.
The spurts of speed, the sudden
stops and turns, and the grueling
pressure of the offense tax both
horse and rider.
Eight men on eight horses gallop
on a field 300 yards long and 200
yards wide. Each man swings a four
foot mallet, and every player races ,
his opponent for the single 4 V2- i
! ounce ball.
SI'CM A FAST, devil-may-care
game requires the services of a ref
eree and the close observance of
rules to prevent serious accidents.
The referee has final decision
: ous. He interprets the rules and ,
controls the game.
The worst violations occur when a
player rides dangerously or does i
; not respect another's right of way.
A PLAYER has the right of way
i and is in possession cf the ball
j when he is riding on the exact line
the bal! travels. An opponent com-
I mits a foul it' he crosses in front of
1 him and causes him to check his
horse.
A side fouled may be awarded a
free hit, or one goal and a free hit,
foul.
Each game is divided into "chuk
kers," 7 ] 2-minute intervals. This is
an Indian name meaning one-sixth
of the value of an Incian coin. The
name is used because six chuk
kers are played in one polo match.
AT THE START of the game the
two teams line up in the middle
of the field on opposite sides of
the half-way line. The referee
bowls the ball underhand between
the teams and the game begins.
During the progress of the game
"riding out" and "hooking" are al
lowed. Riding out is a maneuver in
which one rider uses the weight of
his horse to force his opponent out
of position.
In hooking, a p!aver hooks his

opponent's mallet with his own
during the swing and interrupts the
stroke.
WHEN A RIDER strokes a ball,
he uses the side of the mallet head
He doesn't use it like a croquet
mallet, but more like a golf club
A goal is scored when the ball
passes between the goal posts.
Whenever a <"oa! is made the teams
change ends W the field.
The polo "pony" is so called be
cause the first animals used for the
sport were 14 1 2 hands (58 inches)
high. Small horses hold an advan
tage with their short strides and
even gaits. During the game riders
must lean far out of their saddles
in order to give their arm frae
movement for a mallet swing.
The rider is in his most unstable
position when he is hitting the ball.
A smooth and even-gaited horse
makes the player's shot more ac
curate.
THE RECENT emphasis on spee*
has caused Americans to breed
larger horses. They have bred
thorouchbred racehorses with qm-.v
terhorses to achieve speed ar.d
stamina.
Cow ponies are now used all ovt
the country. Accustomed to having
a rope whirring over their heads,
these horses are easily adapted to
the sing of the polo mallet with: 1
inches of their touchy ears. The
cow pony is nimble, quick, and has
the couraee to enter a fracas.
THE IDEAL POLO pony has
good balance to facilitate changing
pace easily and smoothly. It re
sponds to every whim of the rider,
who must give his attention to his
mallet swing and the progress of
the game.
He must play his position on the
field, follow the plan of his tear*-
mates. and practice the rules of the
game. A man who is forced to fight,
his horse is little help to the team.
A good polo pony will handle as
easilv as a bievcle.
