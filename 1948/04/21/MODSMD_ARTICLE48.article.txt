# Eating Clubs Aim For Old Prestige
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
Today 45 years of history marked
by strife and good times, dissolu
tion and reorganization stand be
hind Stanford's seven men's eating
clubs. But even now the organi
zations are not content to continue
in their present mode of operation
—they are striving to restore the
eating clubs to the position of
prominence which they held before
the outbreak of World War 11.
Breakers, the oldest of the ex
isting clubs, was organized about
1903, and in the intervening years
has been reorganized under a dif
ferent name. Probably the oldest
name among the eating clubs is
that of Los Arcos, which was or
ganized somewhere around 1907
and has retained its original name
ever since. The other groups—El
Cuadro, El Toro, E! Tigre, El Capi
tan, and El Campo—were founded
before 1920.
PRIOR TO THE LAST WAR,
eating clubs were exceedingly ac
tive in campus life. Three of the
groups, Breakers, El Campo, and
El Toro, had private clubrooms in
what was known as the "little
quad." This group of three build
ings was located near Toyon Hall,
and there the three groups took
charge of their own management
and cooking.
The other four organizations had
private rooms in Encina Commons.
When the club members returned
from the battlefields to reorganize
their groups, they were astounded
to find that the "little quad" was
no longer located near Toyon. In
stead they found it crudely cast
aside near the ROTC drill grounds.
They soon learned that the build
ings had been condemned because,
according to University authorities,
the structure of the buildings was
unsound and the kitchen facilities
of the dining rooms had not been
found to be on a par with those of
other privately operated residences.

AT THE PRESENT TIiME the
members of the eating clubs are at
tempting to find a common ground
for agreement with University offi
cials prior to getting actual nego
tiations under way for the future
expansion of activities.
The seven eating clubs have ap
proximately IGO active members
today; they boast more than 2,000
alumni. The clubs conduct a rush
ing period shortly after the regular
fraternity rushing. Dues vary from
group to group, but seldom exceed
eight dollars per quarter. Break
ers is unique in its dues plan: each
member is charged a slight break-

Stanford eating clubs invite
all Farm men to an open house
at Toyon Hall tonight from 7:30
to 9:30. The rushing is informal,
and frosh will be invited to eat
with the various eating clubs
dining the rushing period.
Sign-up lists in Encina and at
the Village will he posted by stu
dents unable to attend the open
house tonight or those who do
not sign with any particular club.
Free cigarettes will be distributed
by Loren "ABC" Smith.

THE PURPOSE of the organiza
tions is to promote good fellowship
through eating together and through
the planning and execution of vari
ous social functions. In addition,
the clubs take part in the intra
mural sports competition, and in
other Farm activities.
One of the oldest traditions which
still exists is to be found in Break
ers. The members of this organiza
tion still do not invite women to
their parties, nor to any of their
meals. The tradition stems from the
almost ancient spirit of brotherhood
typical of all clubs.

has been reorganized under a dif
ferent name. Probably the oldest
name among the eating clubs is
that of Los Arcos, which was or
ganized somewhere around 1907
and has retained its original name
ever since. The other groups—El
Cuadro, El Toro, E! Tigre, El Capi
tan, and El Campo—were founded
before 1920.
PRIOR TO THE LAST WAR,
eating clubs were exceedingly ac
tive in campus life. Three of the
groups, Breakers, El Campo, and
El Toro, had private clubrooms in
what was known as the "little
quad." This group of three build
ings was located near Toyon Hall,
and there the three groups took
charge of their own management
and cooking.
The other four organizations had
private rooms in Encina Commons.
When the club members returned
from the battlefields to reorganize
their groups, they were astounded
to find that the "little quad" was
no longer located near Toyon. In
stead they found it crudely cast
aside near the ROTC drill grounds.
They soon learned that the build
ings had been condemned because,
according to University authorities,
the structure of the buildings was
unsound and the kitchen facilities
of the dining rooms had not been
found to be on a par with those of
other privately operated residences.

AT THE PRESENT TIiME the
members of the eating clubs are at
tempting to find a common ground
for agreement with University offi
cials prior to getting actual nego
tiations under way for the future
expansion of activities.
The seven eating clubs have ap
proximately IGO active members
today; they boast more than 2,000
alumni. The clubs conduct a rush

fraternity rushing. Dues vary from
group to group, but seldom exceed
eight dollars per quarter. Break

member is charged a slight break-
