# Three of Nine Proposed Farm Buildings Set to Go
## 
### BY DIANE JESSEN 
Three of Stanford's nine specified
building funds now stand in the
construction bidding stage with a
score of one down and two to go.
Construction of stacks on the fifth
through the eighth floors of the
Hoover Library is ready to begin.
Stacks will be styled like mezzanines
on the fourth and ninth floors and
will be built from gifts to the Uni
versity totaling $106,140.
Within the next few months, plans
and specifications for both the Law
Quad and Stern Hall will be ready
for bids, providing that building
costs and materials remain fairly
stable.
Building on the Law Quad will
be delayed until offices can be
moved from the Administration
Building, which will house the law
school. The Law Quad fund consists

of $200,000 in gifts, Lai. total cost of
| the construction will be upward ol
S7 50.000.
The Stern Hall fund of $400.00,
was given to the University by Mrs
Lucie Stern of Palo Alto, well knowi;
at Stanford for the help she ad
vanced to many students. The hall
will be a two-story men's residence
located between Escondido and Gal
vez streets, across from Crother.-
! Hall, which is now under construc
; tion.
Eventually it is hoped that Sterr
Hall will form one of a three-unil
i quadrangle dorm served by indi
[ vidual dining units and a central
j kitchen.
Similar long-range plans are held
for Crothers Hall, housing unit foi
! Go law students, which will some da>
i form part of a quadrangle unit with
| a central dining and kitchen unit
j Expected to be completed in June
J the hall was made possible by Judge
George E. Crothers of San Francisco,
! who served as counselor and ad
visor to Mrs. Leland Stanford. Total
cost of the hall will be between
$300,000 and $350,000.
Five other building funds are now
established, but as yet no definite
plans have been laid for their
transformation into buildings.
Tentative plans call for extension
| of the Union Unit to the site where
the Corporation yard now stands.
A Publications fund, composed of
profits from The Daily, Quad, and
Hammer and Coffin society, will fi
| nance a publications building for
these organizations. Of the $24.-
262.03 now in the fund, Hammei
and Coffin has contributed $14.-
735.13. Quad $4,920.68, and The Dailv
$4,588.22.
The $700,000 gift of Mrs. Frank
Coffin Edwards will make possible
a Stanford Medical building in San
Francisco.
Two other funds, one composed of
gifts amounting to $13,000 and the
other an $83,000 gift from Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Luce, will probably be
used for music buildings. The Luces"
gift was made in memory of their
daughter. Ann Brokaw. who was
killed in an automobile accident
nearly five years ago.
