### 
DETROIT, April 21 (UP).—Wal
ter P. Reuther, scrappy chief of
i) 00,000 CIO United Auto Workers,
was declared out of danger today
as rewards for the capture of the
shotgun assailant who blasted him
from ambush last night mounted to
$111,600;
But doctors who operated on the
40-year-old president of the na
tion's biggest industrial union at
New Grace Hospital said he might
lose the vise of his right arm, which
caught the brunt of the would-be
assassin's shot.
Top reward of $100,000 was post
ed by the UAW's international ex
ecutive board, which met in emer
gency session to discuss the shoot
ing. The Detroit city council voted
$10,000, Reuther's home local 174
$1,000. the Michigan Communist
party $500. and the Wayne County
CIO Council $100.
The reward total jumped when
Dan Tobin, president of the AFL
teamsters, wired from Indianapolis
that his union would contribute
$5,000 toward the reward.
Dr. Raymond A. Soko!ov, who
removed four of the pellets from
Reuther's arm and operated on a
less serious chest wound, said he
was "virtually certain the arm will
be saved, but we do not know yet
if the radial nerve was damaged."
■'If it was, he may never have the
full use of his arm again," he said.
