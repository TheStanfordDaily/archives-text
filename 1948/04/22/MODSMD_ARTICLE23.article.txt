JERUSALEM, April 21 (UP).—
British troops in Haifa opened up
on Jewish snipers with cannons and
tanks today as the British evacu
ated most of the port city and Ha
ganah took it over.
Haifa reports said the British
evacuated all the city except for a
strategic fortress atop Mount Car
mel. the port area, and one road
leading through the city to the
docks—chief debarkation point for !
withdrawing forces.
These reports coincided with an
official announcement in Jerusalem
that "some" British troops would
remain in the Holy Land until the
Aug. 1 deadline set by Britain's
cabinet when it decided to lay
down the mandate May 15.
The announcement said troops
remaining here between May 15 and
Aug. 1 will exercise the same au
thority "as accorded troops in the
occupation of a foreign territory.'
