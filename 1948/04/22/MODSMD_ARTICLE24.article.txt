SACRAMENTO. April 21 (UP). —
Recent storms have increased the
summer water prospects in Califor
nia's central valleys even beyond
the predictions of the State Division
of Water Resources 10 days ago,
State Engineer Edward Hyatt de
clared today.
Hyatt said present indications are
that the runoff from the Sacra
mento Valley watershed will be
about 70 per cent of normal in
stead of the 56 per cent estimated
April 10. Flow from the San Joa
quin watershed should be GO per
cent of normal instead of the April
10 estimate of 49 per cent, he said.
