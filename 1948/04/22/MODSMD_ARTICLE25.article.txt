WASHINGTON, April 21 (UP).—
Defense Secretary James Forrestal
today handed Congress a compro
mise national defense plan calling
for a 66-group Air Force of some
6,669 planes and an increase of $3,-
481.000.000 in military spending.
The Senate Armed Services Com
mittee had demanded the revised
program after disputes developed
within Congress and the three mili
tary branches over Forrestal's plan
for a 55-group Air Force.
Air Force officials insisted they
must have 70 groups but President
Truman backed Forrestal.
As submitted to the committee.
Forrestal's new program still calls
for a 19-through-25 draft and early
adoption of universal military
training. But the revision stresses
the requested changes in air power.
