SACRAMENTO. April 21 (UP).—
Gov. Earl Warren tonight called for
the election of a Republican Presi
dent and Congress because "the
present administration has lost its
capacity for leadership at a time
when leadership is the nation's
most urgent need."
At the same time Warren, an
avowed candidate for the Republi
can Presidential nomination, told
his own party that Americans want
an administration which will have
''no part of radicals or counterfeit
liberals on the one hand, nor blind
reactionaries on the other."
His remarks were made in a
coast-to-coast (CBS) radio address,
part of a network series offering
Presidential aspirants the chance to
air their views. It was Warren's
first nationwide campaign speech.
