## Especially You New Men 
### 
One of the favorite expressions of first sergeants was, "Now
let me have your attention, men—especially you new men."
Remember? Well, this editorial is directed to all of you—but
especially you new men and women, the class of 51.
Cal Newman last week repeated some rather startling figures
on the result of his honor code questionnaire. Of the 5,700 people
returning questionnaires, 4,900 said they had observed violations
of the honor code. Now that doesn't mean that there are that
many violators. Perhaps a lot of these were not actually viola
tions, the confusion resulting from lack of knowledge as to what
constitutes a violation. And, of course, hundreds could observe
the same violation.
But, being more specific, Cal pointed out that there were three
cases involving over 20 students last quarter, all of them fresh
men. Lack of indoctrination responsible? We hope that is all.
The Honor Code is Stanford's most priceles possession. Its
value carries over into post-school life because it develops some
thing of immeasurable value in business or professional life
intellectual honesty.
You all know that a person can get away with sharp practices
for a long time—that is, nothing is said. But then will come the
day when the boss is looking for a responsible man for a
good position. Do you think he will choose the man who has
been "getting away" with cheating, just a little bit? Ask any
successful business or professional man you know.
But, if you don't want to be philosophical about this honor
code business, let's be pessimistic and assume that violations of
the honor code become so great the code is abandoned and a
system of monitoring is set up. So what, you ask! Well, we
can think of one thing. Say the code is abandoned in 1949.
Thereafter when you mention that you were at Stanford in 1949,
people will very likely comment, "Oh yes, that was the year
the Honor Code was abandoned. -* T. M. S.
