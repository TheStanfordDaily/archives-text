## Cheap Demagoguery 
### 
To the Editor: . ,
Mr. Carney's letter (last Friday) on Krupp reaches a new low in cheap
demagoguery. Unprecise, emotional and ill-informed, he beats about
with wild accusations. The court acquitted Alfied Krupp (on y t e son
of the man who controlled Krupp Co. during the war) only of the count
of plotting aggressive war. He is yet to be adjudged on the remaining
charges. Brand states properly that such a serious charge must be pi oven
btvond reasonable doubt and that the court was in a better position to
decide this than George Brunn. Neither Brand nor any reasonable person
can condone the record of Big Business in Germany, but we would do
disservice to a just cause and only harm ourselves, were we to condemn
all on all counts. , , ,
The charge of un-Americanism against Brunn, is purely a red hei
ring product of Carney's imagination and was not contained in Brand s let
ter Carney's charge of experiments with humans in German industry
must be related to Alfred Krupp before he can be convicted on this
count. Even if this can be done, such proof is still no basis loi con
viciton of plotting aggressive war.
Carney's letter deserves emphasis far in excess of its immediate content.
It illustrates a great typical weakness: irresponsibility of the journalist
matched with underdeveloped objectivity of the reading public A good
cause is never served by these means, a bad one should not he furthered.
If Carney's letter is on indication of what he might have done in Nuern
berg, I would vastly prefer to quarantine him here where less harm
