# The 						"Wish" to Co-operate

To the Editor:
A recent letter to the editor from Daryl Reagan makes the assertion:
"One cannot help remembering the statement by the rulers oi Russia
that communism and capitalism cannot pacefully exist in the same woild.
These facts, ..." â€ž
I must confess that lam one who could not remember this lact. In
trying to refresh my memory, I discovered that on April 9, 1947, Haro d
E. Stassen in an interview with Stalin in Moscow asked the question:
"I would be interested to know if you think these two economic sys
tems (capitalism and communism) can exist together in the same modern
world in harmony with each other?
Stalin replied: , u
"Of course they can; if during the war they could, why cant tney
during the peace?"
Regarding cooperation, Stalin added:
"It is necessary to make a distinction between the possibility of cooper
ating and the wish to cooperate. The possibility of cooperation always
exists but there is not always present the wish to cooperate. If one
party does not wish to cooperate then the result will be conflict and war.
I want to bear testimony to the fact that Russia wants to cooperate.
I wonder if the rest of Mr. Reagan's facts are cut from the same cloth.
