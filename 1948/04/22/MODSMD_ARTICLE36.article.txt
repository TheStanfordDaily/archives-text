Once upon a time there was a man who owned
a pair of flashy white summer shoes that he wore
only a few times during the warm months of the
year. Several years after he purchased them he
went to his closet to dig the shoes out of storage,
but he gasped when he found they had rotted.

Likewise, there were some edu
cators and students who owned a
university. They used it nine
months per year, but they let it
stand idle for three months. Dur
ing this inactivity, the school con
tinued to age and the university's
owners had to spend money for
materials they had not used full
time.
Until two summers ago, Stan
ford was a nine-months school.

Summer sessions were attended by a number of
graduates, full time teachers in the Education De
partment, a few bright undergraduate students in
a hurry to graduate, and a few other undergrads
making up courses they had flunked during the regu
lar school year.
The student-veteran rush, however, changed the
whole picture two years ago when undergraduates,
outnumbering other summer students two to one,
pushed enrollment far above the 3,000 mark .
Stanford no longer was lying idle; its excellent
facilities, some of its best professors, and the won
derful recreational weather offered students a three
month program similar to the regular year. Al
though plant facilities depreciated, they were being
used for a profitable purpose.
This year Stanford's summer program will be the
most extensive in the University's history. The quar
ter will offer a full curriculum for regular students;
a University-wide program for educators; and a
series of workshops, conferences, and institutes in
the fields of business, labor, industry, arts, govern
ment, and education. The program's theme, "Issues
of One World: America's Responsibilities," is designed
"to extend the influence of the University beyond its
student body to responsible adult leaders of the na
tion."
To graduate and experienced adult leaders through
out the country, the summer theme means a flexible
program, of short, intensive training periods. For
these mature graduates, and other adults who plan
to attend summer quarter only, Stanford opens the
doors to them as nonmatriculated students â€”no credit
granted towards a degree or credential.
Regular term housing and eating facilities will be
open this summer. Undergraduate students will have
an extra quarter of beaches and picnics to blend in
with a ful balanced program of studies.
Undergraduate students will have.an extra quar
ter oi beaches and picnics to blend in with a lull
balanced program of studies. While adult citizens
attend the sumemr session to build up their leader
ship within a One World, regular students will be able
to take makeup courses or study to speed their day
of graduation.
The lull summer quarter program, then, will profit
the University in two ways:
1. It will bring outstanding scholars to the faculty
staff, and business leaders and educators will find it
profitable to study under them. Top educators will
instruct Farm courses in English, education, art,
biology, humanities, business, history, journalism,
psychology, law, speech and drama, political science,
chemistry, and sociology.
2. Summer quarter income will create additional

resources to the University and to the ASSU. Instead
of idle plant facilities, the Farm will sell three
valuable months of education in return for an income
that will be a shot in the arm to supplement the
regular year's receipts.
