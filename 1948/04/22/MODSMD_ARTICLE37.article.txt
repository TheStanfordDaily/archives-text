## Communists Push Far East Drive 
### 
SHANGHAI (UP) â€”Communists are working hard
in all countries of the Far East to consolidate their
aims before American aid can be used to halt Chinese
Communism.
Information from several authentic sources suggests
that if Communism in the Far East achieves its ulti
mate goal, it would aim not only to subjugate China
tut would build a ring around American possessions
and interests from Bering Strait to the Philippines.
To that end the communists are active in Korea,
Manchuria. China. Indo-China, Hongkong, Malaya,
Burma, Siam, India, and the Philippines.
Americans in Shanghai, as well as Chinese and
Dutch sources, warn that China is the keystone.
United States aid to China, they agree, is the last
chance to halt communism's march across the Orient.
Once China were subjugated to communism, they
argue that the other pieces of the pattern soon
would fall into place. Not only the United States,
hut France, Great Britain, and The Netherlands,
along with the newly-created governments of India,
Pakistan, and Burma, would be affected.
In most all areas of continental Asia and in the
South Sea and the Philippines, Chinese communists
are among the leaders in organizational work, ac
cording to documents which detail their activities.
Chinese communists are particularly active in the
Philippines, Indo-China, Burma, and Hongkong.
In the Philippines, their organization has evolved
from the "Chinese Detachment" which fought
against the Japanese. Then it became the "Resis
tance Army," and finally the "Great Democratic
League,' 'now forced into the underground by Fili
pino authorities.
In Indo-China, the two leading Red organizations
are the Indo-China Liberation League and the
Chinees Democratic League.
In Indonesia, the Chinese communists are a full
fledged party, with offshoots in the form of the
Workers Party and the Socialist Youth Party, which
they are seeking to weld into an amalgamated Leftist
Front Party.
In Burma they operate as the Burmese Marxist
League, the Socialist Party, and the People's Volun
teer Group.
In Siam. the South China Bureau has a base of
operations. About half of the Burmese communists
are local Chinese residents.
There are two major Red organizations in Malaya.
One acts openly as the 'Whites," and the other, a
secret organization, calls itself the "Red" commu
nists. The dominating influence in Malaya likewise
is Chinese.
The seeds for the Red program in India and Paki
stan were sown in the recent Far East youth confer
ence held in Calcutta. The Chinese communist radio
made no secret of its support of the conference.
Daily, its broadcasts to the world were concerned
with the porgress, aims, and purposes of the confer
ence.
In Hongkong, the communist South China
League had its headquarters. Most of the commu
nist political and propaganda strategy for Malaya,
Burma, Siam. and other South Pacific areas is
mapped in Hongkong and distributed from there.
