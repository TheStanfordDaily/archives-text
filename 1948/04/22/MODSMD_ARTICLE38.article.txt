Spring, like Gen. Mas Arthur, has returned.
There is a general northbound movement of people
as each animal seeks his natural habitat.
The people from Florida are returning from
Panama, where they have been spending the winter.
The people from New York are returning from

Florida where they have been
spending the winter; and the peo
ple from Maine are returning from
New York where they have beeni
spending the winter.
The same sort of movement is
prevalent on the West Coast, only
includes Mexico, Palm Springs,
Los Angeles, etc.
I wonder which direction the
swallows come from when they re
turn to Capistrano?

Song of the week: This week's selection is the
plumber's song, "You go to my head.

I have heard from people who know, that the KSU
engineers have wired Lagunita boathouse lor sound.
That is to say, it is possible to park a car in the
darkness out there and still hear station KSU.
If it is crowded out there at night, it must be proof
of student interest in their own radio station.

They say, lo err is Truman. Some Republicans,
however, are not living long enough to commit er
rors. They are rapidly being a-Stassenated.

Shortly after the war was over, a new hand lo
tion sprang into competition with Jergens Lotion.
The new product was known as Atom Balm, and for

a while there was some speculation as to whether
or not it would replace Vitalis as the most favorite
on-campus stimulant.
Facts and figures in this case prove nothing. It
only shows there is nothing like a hard, fast war
to make a man real thirsty.

A letter arrived at The Daily the other day, from
a guy who has been hitch-hiking to school from the
Village for two years. He totaled up the miles and
figured he owes the drivers a lot of dough.
He first thought of giving each driver a nickel from
now on, but figured it would embarrass the driver
and make the hitch-hiker look as cheap as a 10-cent
tip -
Now he has hit on the idea of slipping a dollar
bill into the car of each 20th driver. This buys the
driver a few beers and builds up the hitch-hiker s
self respect at the same time.
I think it's a great idea. A little kindness given,
and a little kindness returned.
Sounds as trite has can be, but maybe it will help
knock hell out of some of those old rumors about
selfish, thoughtless, n-good rich kids that go to
Stanford.

San Francisco is being bothered with chain letters
again. The old 10-cent chain letter, due to inflation,
has been replaced with the $5 chain letter. Both are
as illegal as Ben Franklin's children.
There is a chain letter movement afoot whereby
you send your girl friend to the man on the top
of the list.
When your name gets to the top of the list, you
stand to receive 16,187 women.
If you break the chain, of course, you ruin every
thing and get your old Stanford woman back again.
