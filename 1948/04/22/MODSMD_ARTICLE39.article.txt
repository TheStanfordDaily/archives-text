# 'Sitting Pretty' Is Fun; But Cary Grant's Angelic
## 
### 
"The Bishop's Wife" at the Var
sity has several rewarding features
in the person of Cary Grant. He
plays a somewhat worldly angel
who has been sent down by the
powers above to lend a helping
hand to an even more worldly
bishop, played by David Niven.
The almost trite angel-in-mor
tal-garb theme is rehashed in a
lively and entertaining fashion. The
main idea is for Cary, as the angel
Dudley, to save the bishop's mar
riage, among other things. He does,
but not before he forms an unan
gelic attachment for the bishop's
wife. Loretta Young.
CARY DASHES ABOUT merrily
in a Christmas setting, filling up
wine bottles, opening locked boxes,
and even dictating a sermon to an
operatorless typewriter.
David Niven is properly preoccu
pied before donning the robes of
the jealous husband and setting
things right with his wife. Loretta
Young, as the bishop's wife, is good
enough to warm the hearts of a
flock of angels.
Monty Woolley is his usual chip
per self as a retired college profes
sor who has been putting off writ
ing his great history for 25 years—
and then gets the good word from
Dudley and piles back into his task.
THE COMPANION PIECE, about
"A Woman's Revenge," sends Chazz
Boyer on a cradle-snatching ven
ture. A middleaged ne'er-do-well
saddled with an invalid wife, he
marries an 18-year-old lass just as
soon as his wife leaves this cruel
world under extenuating circum
stances.
The extenuating circumstances
are a jigger of arsenic administered
by a neurotic family friend, played
by Jessica Tandy, who feels that
the great lover is hers.
Needless to say, she is not over
joyed at his marriage to Ann
Blythe. The revenge sets in like
rigor mortis and Chazz is convicted
of murdering his wife.
Unfortunately, Jessica cracks up
under skilled handling by Sir Ced
ric Hardwicke and Chazz is saved. —

Mr. Belvedere is one of the most
delightful characters to hit the
screen since Grumpy in "Snow
White." He is the sophisticated gen
tleman in the film "Sitting Pretty"
who hates children and takes a job
as a baby-sitter.
Played with dead-pan humor by
Clifton Webb, Mr. Belvedere eas
ily steals the picture from the
rest of an excellent cast that in
cludes Robert Young and Maureen
O'Hara as a young couple with
three children and a Great Dane;
and Richard Haydn, as the town
gossip, whose life work is cross
pollenating irisis.
"Sitting Pretty" is consistently
funny. Some of its high-spots in
clude Richard Haydn's morning
walk. Webb's tussle with a bowl of
oatmeal, and his answer to a ques
tion as to his occupation.
He replied, "Madame, I am a
genius."
One of the assets of the picture
is the expert job done by the
smallest bit players. The three chil
dren do not have the saccharine
sweet character typical of children
in Hollywood movies.
The picture, playing at the Stan
ford Theater, furnishes two hours
of hearty laughs.—A. Levin

cludes Robert Young and Maureen
O'Hara as a young couple with
three children and a Great Dane;
and Richard Haydn, as the town
gossip, whose life work is cross
pollenating irisis.
"Sitting Pretty" is consistently
funny. Some of its high-spots in
clude Richard Haydn's morning
walk. Webb's tussle with a bowl of
oatmeal, and his answer to a ques
tion as to his occupation.
He replied, "Madame, I am a
genius."
One of the assets of the picture
is the expert job done by the
smallest bit players. The three chil
dren do not have the saccharine
sweet character typical of children
in Hollywood movies.
The picture, playing at the Stan
ford Theater, furnishes two hours
of hearty laughs.—A. Levin
"The Bishop's Wife" at the Var
sity has several rewarding features
in the person of Cary Grant. He
plays a somewhat worldly angel
who has been sent down by the
powers above to lend a helping
hand to an even more worldly
bishop, played by David Niven.
The almost trite angel-in-mor
tal-garb theme is rehashed in a
lively and entertaining fashion. The
main idea is for Cary, as the angel
Dudley, to save the bishop's mar
riage, among other things. He does,
but not before he forms an unan
gelic attachment for the bishop's
wife. Loretta Young.
CARY DASHES ABOUT merrily
in a Christmas setting, filling up
wine bottles, opening locked boxes,
and even dictating a sermon to an
operatorless typewriter.
David Niven is properly preoccu
pied before donning the robes of
the jealous husband and setting
things right with his wife. Loretta
Young, as the bishop's wife, is good
enough to warm the hearts of a
flock of angels.
Monty Woolley is his usual chip
per self as a retired college profes
sor who has been putting off writ
ing his great history for 25 years—
and then gets the good word from
Dudley and piles back into his task.
THE COMPANION PIECE, about
"A Woman's Revenge," sends Chazz
Boyer on a cradle-snatching ven
ture. A middleaged ne'er-do-well
saddled with an invalid wife, he
marries an 18-year-old lass just as
soon as his wife leaves this cruel
world under extenuating circum
stances.
The extenuating circumstances
are a jigger of arsenic administered
by a neurotic family friend, played
by Jessica Tandy, who feels that
the great lover is hers.
Needless to say, she is not over
joyed at his marriage to Ann
Blythe. The revenge sets in like
rigor mortis and Chazz is convicted
of murdering his wife.
Unfortunately, Jessica cracks up
under skilled handling by Sir Ced
ric Hardwicke and Chazz is saved. —

Mr. Belvedere is one of the most
delightful characters to hit the
screen since Grumpy in "Snow
White." He is the sophisticated gen
tleman in the film "Sitting Pretty"
who hates children and takes a job
as a baby-sitter.
Played with dead-pan humor by
Clifton Webb, Mr. Belvedere eas
ily steals the picture from the
rest of an excellent cast that in
cludes Robert Young and Maureen
O'Hara as a young couple with
three children and a Great Dane;
and Richard Haydn, as the town
gossip, whose life work is cross
