# U.S. Outlaws Coal Walkout; Pension Disapproval Asked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 21 (UP).â€”
The government obtained an anti
strike injunction against John L.
Lewis' United Mine Workers today
and the mine owners asked the
courts to throw out the pension
settlement Lewis won nine days
ago.
Following closely on the con
tempt of court convictions which
resulted in Lewis being fined $20.-
000 and his union $1,400,000 yes
terday, today's legal moves ap
peared to put the mine leader in
a tight position.
Lewis' old nemesis, Federal Judge
T. Alan Goldsborough, issued a
preliminary injunction outlawing
another soft coal strike indefinitely.
He acted under the Taft-Hartley
Law in response to a government
petition which said that labor un
rest in the bituminous fields im
perils the national health and wel
fare.
Barely an hour later, the soft coal
operators filed suit in the same fed
eral district court for a restraining
order to bar payments under the
new pension agreement until the
court passes on its legality.
They contended that the agree
ment violated the Taft-Hartley Law
because it allows pensions to min
ers whose employers do not con
tribute directly to the welfare fund
from which the pensions are to be
paid.
The operators asked that Lewis
and Sen. Styles Bridges, R., N.H.,
the two welfare fund trustees who
outvoted the industry member and
put the pension plan across, be held
responsible for any money that may
be paid out before the court de
cides the issue.
