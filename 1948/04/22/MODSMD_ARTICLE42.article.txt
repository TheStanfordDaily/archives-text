# UNESCO to Sponsor Bicycle Trip Sunday
## 
### 
A bicycle trip to Hidden Villa, a
youth hostel west of Stanford, is
being sponsored Sunday by the
Council for UNESCO, chairman
Howard Loekwood said yesterday.
UNESCO is sponsoring the trips
to condition those students who
plan to hostel abroad this summer.
Those going will meet at the Post
Office at 1 p.m. Sunday. A bicycle
is the only requisite for the trip.
