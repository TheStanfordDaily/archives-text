# Men's Dorm Will Be Built By Spring '49
## 
### 
Stanford men will have a new
dorm by spring 1949, donated by
Mrs. Lucie Stern of Palo Alto.
The dorm will be located across
Escondido Road from Crothers Hall,
the new dorm being constructed for
graduate law students.
Stanford Board of Trustees last
week authorized a ca!l for bids for
the new dorm.
Mrs. Stern, "Aunt Lucie" to gen
erations of Stanford men, stipulated
in the gift that no discrimination
on the grounds of race, color, or
creed ever be made in assigning
students rooms in the hall.
Dr. Tresidder said at the time the
gift was received that the hall
would be named for Mrs. Stern.
Mrs. Stern was responsible for
the Ruth Stern Research Labora
tory at the Stanford Hospital, a
children's free bed fund at the Con
Home, the Lucie Stern Fellowship
for Special Study, and the fluoro
scopic unit at the Health Service.
