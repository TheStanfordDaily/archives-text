# Card Nine Tests 'Giant-Killers'
## 
### 
Big league baseball conies to
Stanford Saturday when the gold
en-toned USC Trojans invade the
Sunken Diamond. It will be USC's
first appearance in these parts, but
Trojan press notices have been here
for several weeks.
USC has beaten the best of the
professionals, having a list of vic
tims that includes the Cleveland
Indians, Chicago White Sox, Holly
wood Stars, and Los Angeles An
gels. Their only mistake in league
play has been at the hands of Santa
Clara.
Trojan pitcher Wally Hood has
won 10 out of his last 11 starts, and
is considered to be in a class by
himself. Besides Hood, the south
landers are loaded in every posi
tion. Shortstop Jimmy Brideweser,

second baseman Art Mazmanian,
and catcher Bill Zuber are all top
notch performers.
Stanford will be out after its
third win. The Cards are limping
along now with two wins and four
losses, being tied with UCLA for
last place in loop standings.
However, the Indians have the
stud to stay right with USC. They
proved it when they dropped Santa
Clara two weeks ago. And Santa
Clara turned right around to knock
over the Trojans.
Stanford is in the throes of a
three-game losing streak, but var
sity hitting has been improving
steadily. If the fielders can get rid
of their recent juggling habits, Sat
urday's game will turn out to be
a good match.
