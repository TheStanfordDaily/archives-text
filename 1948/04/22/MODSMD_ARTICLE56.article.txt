## BASEBALL Frosh Clash With Spartans 
### 
Out to snap their three - game I
losing streak, the Stanford fresh
men will meet San Jose State's
l'rosh nine on the frosh diamond at
3 this afternoon. The game is a
play-off of the rained-out April 6
game.
Coach Charlie Bushong's pitching
nominee is Jim Claypoolâ€”provided
the soreness in Jim's arm is gone.
Otherwise it'll be Lloyd Westphal
or Denny Tuffanelli.
The going has been rough for the
frosh in the last week. After taking
a 7 to 0 ten-inning game from San
Mateo JC last Monday, the year
lings have dropped games to Santa
Clara, California, and Stockton JC.
With an aim toward keeping their
record above (he .500 mark, the
team is pointing for this win.
Probable lineup:
Ken LaCrosse, ss; Denny Tuffa
nelli. cf; Sal Colletto. 3b; Jim Tra
bucco. If: Dick Clegg. c; Larry Fink,
rf; Joe Pinotti. 2b; Don McComber,
lb; and Jim Claypool, p.
Slugger Tod Williams once shot j
out all the lights in a ball park with
a pistol.
