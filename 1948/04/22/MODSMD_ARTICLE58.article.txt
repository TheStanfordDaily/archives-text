# Indian Cindermen Point For Upset Win Over Troy
## 
### 
Having completed their last major workout of the week yes
terday, the Stanford varsity cindermen are looking ahead with
great anxiety to their all-important meet with USC at the Los
| Angeles Coliseum Saturday.
The Indians have tasted defeat at the hands of the Trojans

every season since 1933. With de
cisive victories over San Jose State
and the Olympic Club plus some of
the best marks recorded so far this
year on the Pacific Coast, there is a
spark of hope for an upset.
THE TRAVELING SQUAD of 2fi
men has been announced. They will
leave for Los Angeles on Friday's
Noon Daylight and stay at the
Mayfair Hotel in Los Angeles.
Marty Anderson, Gay Bryan, Otis
Chandler, Chuck Coker, Fred Fank,
Scott Goldsborough, Bob Ghilotti,
George Grimes. Bud Held, Larry
HofY, A 1 Holubar, Pitch Johnson,
Skip Kent, Darrell Krcitz, Bill Lar
son.
Gordy Levy, A 1 Lyons, Downing
McKee, Steve McKee, Norm
Nourse, Jose Rael, Bud Ritcher,
Dell Russell, A 1 Wilkins, Bob
Wood, Terry Maxwell, and Bob
McLean, manager.
IT IS INTERESTING to compare
some of the excellent marks set by
Stanford men against the Olympic
Club with those in other parts of
the country, and in Stanford his
tory.
Gay Bryan's 24—ft. 3 3 i»-in. jump
seems to be the best recorded mark
in the country so far this season. If
he does as well or improves his
mark against the Trojans, Bryan
will be a serious contender for this
year's Olympics. The University
record is 24 ft. 10 7 « in., set by Kim
Dyer.
Equaling the third best mark in
Stanford's track history was pole
vaulter Bill Larson in his 14-ft. leap
against the Olympic Club last Sat
urday. Bud Deacon (14 ft. 2 :! 4 in.)
and Bill Miller (14 ft. 1"h in.) were
the only ones to top him. Miller
made his leap in the '36 Olympics.
DOWNING McKEE'S high hur
dles effort is certainly worth recog
nition. In his second race in Stan
ford colors, he raced 14.3 nearing
the all-time record of 14.1 by the
Indians' Sammy Klopstock. McKee
will have plenty of competition
from UCLA's Craig Dixon as well
as from teammates Darrell Kreitz
and Skip Kent.

will be a serious contender for this
year's Olympics. The University
record is 24 ft. 10 7 « in., set by Kim
Dyer.
Equaling the third best mark in
Stanford's track history was pole
vaulter Bill Larson in his 14-ft. leap
against the Olympic Club last Sat
urday. Bud Deacon (14 ft. 2 :! 4 in.)
and Bill Miller (14 ft. 1"h in.) were
the only ones to top him. Miller
made his leap in the '36 Olympics.
DOWNING McKEE'S high hur
dles effort is certainly worth recog
nition. In his second race in Stan
ford colors, he raced 14.3 nearing
the all-time record of 14.1 by the
Indians' Sammy Klopstock. McKee
will have plenty of competition
from UCLA's Craig Dixon as well
as from teammates Darrell Kreitz
and Skip Kent.
Having completed their last major workout of the week yes
terday, the Stanford varsity cindermen are looking ahead with
great anxiety to their all-important meet with USC at the Los
| Angeles Coliseum Saturday.
The Indians have tasted defeat at the hands of the Trojans

every season since 1933. With de
cisive victories over San Jose State
and the Olympic Club plus some of
the best marks recorded so far this
year on the Pacific Coast, there is a
spark of hope for an upset.
THE TRAVELING SQUAD of 2fi
men has been announced. They will
leave for Los Angeles on Friday's
Noon Daylight and stay at the
Mayfair Hotel in Los Angeles.

Gordy Levy, A 1 Lyons, Downing
McKee, Steve McKee, Norm
Nourse, Jose Rael, Bud Ritcher,

IT IS INTERESTING to compare
some of the excellent marks set by
Stanford men against the Olympic
Club with those in other parts of
the country, and in Stanford his
tory.
Gay Bryan's 24—ft. 3 3 i»-in. jump
seems to be the best recorded mark
in the country so far this season. If
he does as well or improves his
mark against the Trojans, Bryan
will be a serious contender for this
year's Olympics. The University
record is 24 ft. 10 7 « in., set by Kim
