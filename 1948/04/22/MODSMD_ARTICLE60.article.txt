# Newly-Formed JV Nine Faces Menlo in Opener
## 
### BY JOHN HERBOLD 
Branch Rickey and the St. Louis Cards started it a long time
ago, and now Harry Wolter and the Stanford Cards are picking
it up. That "it" we happen to be referring to is the newly-formed
JV baseball team.
Coached by Bobby Peters, the JVs open their season today

against Menlo JC on the home
field. Game time is 3:15 p.m.
PETERS, varsity regular until
declared ine'igible for further
league play (Happy had nothing to
do with it), is not yet sure of his
opening line-up. But it is a cer
tainty that any Peters-coached ag
gregation won't be lacking in
hustle or determination.
During the recent series at UC
LA. Peters (all 150 pounds of him)
imade iootballer Jack Meyers (a
midget at 225 plus) take a back
ward step in a slight altercation at
first base.
MENLO has a good team this
year and should give the junior
Cards a good game and Peters a
good idea of his team's ability.
Other games are in the process
of being scheduled, including a
proposed three - game series with
Cal. The Jayvees practice nightly
behind the varsity diamond on
their own field.
Although he now has enough re
cruits, Peters reports that he will
offer contracts to any men who
want to come out and can make the
team. Some baseball experience is
required, but the main emphasis
will be put on attendance and
hustle.
UP UNTIL RECENTLY the frosh
team has been the only source of
supply and talent for the varsity,
but addition of a Jayvee team will
help develop promising prospects
not quite ready for "big league"
play. The way the "big league" In
dians are going now, they can use
some help.
So far Peters' roster reads as fol
lows: George York and Rog Still
son, catchers; Bill Freeland and Ben
Cardinelli, first base; Miles Chute,
Ken North, and Harry Reichling,
second base; Ray Winterhalter,
short: Bill Hurley, third base.
In the outfield it will be Pete Mc-
Closkey, John Williams, and Don
Gabrielson, who will also pitch.
Other hurlers are Jack Heinen,
Jack Bradshaw, and Forrest Shum
way.

Branch Rickey and the St. Louis Cards started it a long time
ago, and now Harry Wolter and the Stanford Cards are picking
it up. That "it" we happen to be referring to is the newly-formed
JV baseball team.
Coached by Bobby Peters, the JVs open their season today

against Menlo JC on the home
field. Game time is 3:15 p.m.
PETERS, varsity regular until
declared ine'igible for further
league play (Happy had nothing to
do with it), is not yet sure of his
opening line-up. But it is a cer
tainty that any Peters-coached ag
gregation won't be lacking in
hustle or determination.
During the recent series at UC
LA. Peters (all 150 pounds of him)
imade iootballer Jack Meyers (a
midget at 225 plus) take a back
ward step in a slight altercation at
first base.
MENLO has a good team this
year and should give the junior
Cards a good game and Peters a
good idea of his team's ability.
Other games are in the process
of being scheduled, including a
proposed three - game series with
Cal. The Jayvees practice nightly
behind the varsity diamond on
their own field.
Although he now has enough re
cruits, Peters reports that he will
offer contracts to any men who
want to come out and can make the
team. Some baseball experience is
required, but the main emphasis
will be put on attendance and
hustle.
UP UNTIL RECENTLY the frosh
team has been the only source of
supply and talent for the varsity,
but addition of a Jayvee team will
help develop promising prospects
not quite ready for "big league"
play. The way the "big league" In
dians are going now, they can use
some help.
So far Peters' roster reads as fol
lows: George York and Rog Still
son, catchers; Bill Freeland and Ben
Cardinelli, first base; Miles Chute,
Ken North, and Harry Reichling,
second base; Ray Winterhalter,
short: Bill Hurley, third base.
In the outfield it will be Pete Mc-
Closkey, John Williams, and Don
Gabrielson, who will also pitch.
Other hurlers are Jack Heinen,
Jack Bradshaw, and Forrest Shum
way.
