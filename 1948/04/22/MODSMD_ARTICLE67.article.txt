# Women Originate, Carry Out Sponsoring System on Farm
## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Sponsoring on the Farm is one
of the important Stanford traditions
which was originated and carried
out entirely by the students them
selves.
A group of sorority women came
to Dean Mary Yost one night in
1924 and offered to help orient the
freshmen. According to Miss Lu
cie Lataillade, director of Roble
Hall, at that time Roble housed
freshman and independent women.
These independents helped the
freshmen and the sororities felt that
they were losing out.
SO, MISS LA said, they wanted
the Panhellenic Law revised so that
sorority women could leave their
houses for two quarters and come
to Roble to help introduce the
freshmen to the Farm.
This was the beginning of Stan
ford's sponsor system. As time
went on, a junior and a senior
sponsor were chosen for each cor
ridor. The junior sponsors were
always independents; the senior
sponsors were from both the soro
rities and independents—chosen on
a basis of the best qualified, area
making no difference.
The sponsors ran the hall the first
quarter, then the freshmen took
over some of the duties winter
quarter, and spring quarter the
freshmen took complete charge of
the hall and sponsors were no long
er needed.
DURING THE WAR the system
was somewhat changed. Since a
new group of freshmen was admit
ted each quarter, sponsors were
needed all the time. Thus one spon
sor livde in each corridor all four
quarters. The group of sponsors
changed often, with each girl stay
ing as long as she could .The sys
tem. Miss La said, lost some of its
have only been admitted fall and
winter quarters, so the old sponsor
system is returning. It is not en
tirely the same, though, for senior
and junior sponsors do not always
have senior and junior standing.
Also, the junior sponsors may come
from any area.
SPONSORS ARE found wher
ever there are freshmen. Miss La
went on. During the war freshmen
lived in Ventura and in Lagunita,
and before the war, in one Union
Unit house. Some years sponsors
have lived with the transfer stu
dents for one quarter.
"It is important." Miss La con
cluded, "for sponsors to have inter
ests and activities outside of spon
soring, for in that way the freshmen
become interested in those activi
ties."
Applications for sponsoring next
year may be filled out in the ASSU
oce today and tomorrow.

MISS MARY YOST
Sponsoring on the Farm is one
of the important Stanford traditions
which was originated and carried
out entirely by the students them
selves.
A group of sorority women came
to Dean Mary Yost one night in
1924 and offered to help orient the
freshmen. According to Miss Lu
cie Lataillade, director of Roble
Hall, at that time Roble housed
freshman and independent women.
These independents helped the
freshmen and the sororities felt that
they were losing out.
SO, MISS LA said, they wanted
the Panhellenic Law revised so that
sorority women could leave their
houses for two quarters and come
to Roble to help introduce the
freshmen to the Farm.
This was the beginning of Stan
ford's sponsor system. As time
went on, a junior and a senior
sponsor were chosen for each cor
ridor. The junior sponsors were
always independents; the senior
sponsors were from both the soro
rities and independents—chosen on
a basis of the best qualified, area
making no difference.
The sponsors ran the hall the first
quarter, then the freshmen took
over some of the duties winter
quarter, and spring quarter the
freshmen took complete charge of
the hall and sponsors were no long
er needed.
DURING THE WAR the system
was somewhat changed. Since a
new group of freshmen was admit
ted each quarter, sponsors were
needed all the time. Thus one spon
sor livde in each corridor all four
quarters. The group of sponsors
changed often, with each girl stay
ing as long as she could .The sys
tem. Miss La said, lost some of its
have only been admitted fall and
winter quarters, so the old sponsor
system is returning. It is not en
tirely the same, though, for senior
and junior sponsors do not always
have senior and junior standing.
Also, the junior sponsors may come
from any area.
SPONSORS ARE found wher
ever there are freshmen. Miss La
went on. During the war freshmen
lived in Ventura and in Lagunita,
and before the war, in one Union
Unit house. Some years sponsors
have lived with the transfer stu
dents for one quarter.
