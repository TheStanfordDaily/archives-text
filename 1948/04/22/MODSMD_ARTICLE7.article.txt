# Excom Says Election OK
## 
### 
Final results of yesterday's AS
SU primary election were approved
by Excom last night.
A straw vote on the national
presidency will be conducted in
conjunction with the final election
Wednesday. This motion, sponsored
by Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary po
litical science fraternity, was passed
by Excom.
Excom specified that the candi
dates for national president be
printed on a separate ballot from
that of the ASSU and class officers,
and that Pi Sigma Alpha count the
votes.
Gordon Luce. Election Board
head, received some complaint from
Excom members regarding the
crossing out in pencil of offices that
were not to be voted on. It was
felt a more indelible method should
be used in the final election.
Bob Brown questioned whether
the use of campaign funds should
not be put to a student vote at this
time. The matter was not voted on
by Excom and discussion was ta
bled for a later date. Ted Norton
pointed out that any group of stu
dents desirous of putting the ques
tion on the ballot may do so by
turning in a petition of 150 names.
Excom approved the awarding of
Circle Block "S" for varsity wres
tling to George Bevier. Dick Cruce,
Dick Esbenshade, Roy Gaskin, Ray
Harris, Vein Jones, Jim Kurfess,
Winston Mumby. and John White.
A box for rebate slips will be
placed in the Bookstore here stu
dents may drop unwanted rebates.
All donations will be turned over
to campus drives such as the Red
Cross.
