Thoy Are Either Too Young or
Too Old or
One Down and Always One More
To Co!
I have found the old ones not to
be the true ones . . .
None the one I could adore,
But when I tried the young ones
I saw that they were somcones
Who could only offer less, not
more!
Somewhere there's a right one. a
lovely day and night one . . .
Or so at least I'm told —
Most often by an old one (too
often she's a cold one)
And sometimes by a young one,
bright not bold!
— Larry Wing

Rodeo
0 the Steed of Fate's a frisky colt,
And many's the Rider's found
Fate's a filly loves to bolt
And toss his man a-ground!
Then little's the use or groan and
moan
And little's the use to wail
And little's the use for the Horse
man thrown
.Who clings to the Horses's tail!!!
—Alice Hurst
1 quoted proverbs to my son,
I filled his mind with concepts
deep;
Then diapered him with absent
skill.
And heard him gurgle, "Talc is
cheap."
—AI Young
