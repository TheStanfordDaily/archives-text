## It Can't Happen Here 
### 
It can't happen here. That's what we thought until just this
week. In Texas, yes. There, a Pappy Lee O'Daniel can clown
his way into office, with a "git-tar" in his hand, corn pone in
his mouth, and nothing in his head. It's a shame such tactics
can swing an election, we thought, but maybe it's just because
Ihe voters don't know any better or don't care.
Perhaps if the "people" were better educated, such farces as
"Pass the Biscuits, Pappy" O'Daniel would be eliminated and
our government would more nearly approach its ideals. Col
lege-educated persons, or even those of high school levels,
would never be misled by a circus. That's what we thought.
This week, we've changed our ideas. Apparently even at
college level, voters can't or don't, vote intelligently. Back
ground, experience, platform, character â€”are these considered
by the voters? No, it takes a vaudeville show to determine
fitness for office. . .
Bob Hope and Gypsy Rose Lee would probably walk away
with an election at Stanford.
