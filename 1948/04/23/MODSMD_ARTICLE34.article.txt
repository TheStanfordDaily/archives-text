# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						Issue: Civil Liberty 
### 
To the Editor:
As shown by the campaign platforms, this coming election at Stanford
rests on an issue of civil liberty. Will we have freedom of political belief,
speech, and assembly at Stanford? Last year a group of students wishing
to exercise their franchise of free speech were prohibited through a
closed meeting of Excom from assembling on campus, This is not a
day school; students who attend Stanford live hetfe, yet they are denied
free speech and freedom of assembly in their own Residence.
We think it is commonly accepted that the men who signed our country s
constitution held the belief that democracy rests on the right of the
individual to protest and to render his grievances verbally so that the
majority can consider the justice of his complaint and its remedy;
and that they may vote on suggestions for reform. If, in one instance —
a college of 8,000 supposedly near-mature students —that franchise is
denied, and secrecy and silence the basis of political life, then democracy
has failed.
It is only when a political group has been heard that they can be
declared wrong. If you think that ignorance is the bedfellow of truth,
why did you come to college?
