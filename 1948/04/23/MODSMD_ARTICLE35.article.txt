# How to Choose a Candidate
## 
### 
To the E<litor:
Today's editorial (April 15> was apparently written to prove the point
expressed in The Daily editorial of April 13: "Some days you just can t
write an editorial." (Most days, in fact.)
On what basis does the editor suggest that executives be selected? He
has ruled out the candidate's stand on campus issues, his record in former
positions held, his popularity, his support by groups advocating specific
policies, and even his ability at horseshoes. The editor proposes that
voters make their judgments on the basis of "who and what the candidate
is." Who and what is the candidate if not a weighed composite of these
qualities which the editor has rejected as valid considerations? A gradu
ate of the Snodgrass School for the Sons of Successful Stockholders?
The only red-headed, bicephalic individual known to medical science?
Watch it!
