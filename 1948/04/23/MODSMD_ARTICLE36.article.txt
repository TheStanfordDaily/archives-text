To the Editor:
I really hate to put your hard worked staff to any further trouble in
these days of extreme difficulties all around the world, and I realize that
newsprint is very expensive, but don't you think it might be possible
to have my name listed with those of the other girls running for Women's
Council?
You did the same thing last week, and now I'm just wondering if my
name will even appear on the ballot. Otherwise, thinks for your daily
laughs, and I don't mean Daily laughs.
