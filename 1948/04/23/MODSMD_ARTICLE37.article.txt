In ('ast' of Attack
WASHINGTON (UP)—lf there should be another
war, every United States city must be ready with
an efficiently-organized plan for evacuation and for
coping with war-borne disaster.
That is the opinion of Maj. Gen. Philip B. Fleming,
federal works administrator.
Fleming's public roads commission already is
laying plans for building a system of urban streets,
expressways and rural highways. They would fa
cilitate evacuation and maintain supply routes if
railroads and main highways should be knocked
out by bombs.
Fleming favors bringing back the war-time office
of civilian defense. In the defense department a
new director of civilian defense planning has just
started work on plans for a future civilian defense
program.
He is Itussel J. Hoplcy, president of the North
west Bell Telephone Co., Omaha. Neb. Hoplcy
hopes to complete within six. months a plan to pro
tect American cities against possible military at
tack.
Hopley shares Fleming's view about the need for
efficient local disaster organizations.
"Just as every American city needs a fire depart
ment, we must have a sound civilian defense or
ganization 011 hand in case this country is attacked
by an enemy," Hopley said.
He urged each U. S. city to start now to develop its
own disaster relief organization. His job, he said,
will be to co-relate various government reports out
lining proposals for protection against atomic and
other weapons and recommend "a workable system
based on individual and community responsibility."
Fleming believes every American should be
versed in whatever methods exist for dealing with
the disasters that would result from an atomic
bomb, a guided missile, or other weapons of a
future war.
He recalled that "countless lives were lost need
lessly" in Europe in World War II as a result of
organization. The same thing, he said, has happened
in peace-time disasters in this country, such as the
Texas City explosion and the Maine forest fires.
During the last war, the office of civilian defense
made up a nation-wide network of voluntary
civilian teams extending down to the smallest
community. Members of the teams perched on
church towers and skyscrapers as air raid spotters,
issued gas masks, and carried on blackout drills.
In any future war, Fleming said, civilian teams
must have worked out in advance a system of or
ganized collection of people and property for evacua
tion. They must be able to direct traffic out of cities
in an orderly fashion.
He believes that every bus, truck, and automo
bile that would be available for civilian use in an
emergency should have certain duties and passen
gers assigned to it in advance. Every car driver
should be assigned a specific route he is to follow
out of town.
Even if such advance arrangements never are
called into use by a war disaster, Fleming said,
they would be useful in coping with such peace
time emergencies as flood or fire.

by an enemy," Hopley said.
He urged each U. S. city to start now to develop its
own disaster relief organization. His job, he said,
will be to co-relate various government reports out
lining proposals for protection against atomic and
other weapons and recommend "a workable system
based on individual and community responsibility."
Fleming believes every American should be
versed in whatever methods exist for dealing with
the disasters that would result from an atomic
bomb, a guided missile, or other weapons of a
future war.
He recalled that "countless lives were lost need
lessly" in Europe in World War II as a result of
organization. The same thing, he said, has happened
in peace-time disasters in this country, such as the
Texas City explosion and the Maine forest fires.
During the last war, the office of civilian defense
made up a nation-wide network of voluntary
civilian teams extending down to the smallest
community. Members of the teams perched on
church towers and skyscrapers as air raid spotters,
issued gas masks, and carried on blackout drills.
In any future war, Fleming said, civilian teams
must have worked out in advance a system of or
ganized collection of people and property for evacua
tion. They must be able to direct traffic out of cities
in an orderly fashion.
He believes that every bus, truck, and automo
bile that would be available for civilian use in an
emergency should have certain duties and passen
gers assigned to it in advance. Every car driver
should be assigned a specific route he is to follow
out of town.
Even if such advance arrangements never are
called into use by a war disaster, Fleming said,
they would be useful in coping with such peace
time emergencies as flood or fire.
In ('ast' of Attack
WASHINGTON (UP)—lf there should be another
war, every United States city must be ready with
an efficiently-organized plan for evacuation and for
coping with war-borne disaster.
That is the opinion of Maj. Gen. Philip B. Fleming,
federal works administrator.
Fleming's public roads commission already is
laying plans for building a system of urban streets,
expressways and rural highways. They would fa
cilitate evacuation and maintain supply routes if
railroads and main highways should be knocked
out by bombs.
Fleming favors bringing back the war-time office
of civilian defense. In the defense department a
new director of civilian defense planning has just
started work on plans for a future civilian defense
program.
He is Itussel J. Hoplcy, president of the North
west Bell Telephone Co., Omaha. Neb. Hoplcy
hopes to complete within six. months a plan to pro
tect American cities against possible military at
tack.
Hopley shares Fleming's view about the need for
efficient local disaster organizations.
"Just as every American city needs a fire depart
ment, we must have a sound civilian defense or
ganization 011 hand in case this country is attacked
by an enemy," Hopley said.
