In many quarters it is being alleged that high
taxes are the cause of high prices. To ease the
pressure of prices, therefore, it Is proposed to lower
taxes. An analysis of the relationship between prices
and taxes indicates that this line of reasoning involves
a serious oversimplification of the problem under

present conditions.
There are two ways in which
taxes affect prices: (1) by adding to
costs and (2) by reducing the in
-1 centive to produce, and, hence, re
sulting in a smaller supply than
would otherwise be available.
It is true that if taxes were lower
industry could sell at a lower
price and maintain the current
profit margins. It is also true that
if cxciee taxes were reduced there
might be a tendency for the effec-

tive price to consumers to be reduced.
There is a much graver doubt, however, that a
reduction in taxes would result in an expansion in
supplies because that action would have a favorable
effect upon the incentive to produce. With the
economy operating at fairly close to full capacity, it
is difficult to understand where this added expan
sion would take place without resulting in a corre
sponding contraction in some other area of economy.
As an offset to the foregoing tendencies toward cost
and price reduction, a decrease in taxes would mean
an increase in consumer purchasing power. It is gen
erally agreed that one of the major factors, in the
present high level of prices has been the pressure
resulting from a large consumer demand. Tax re
ductions would necessarily mean a still greater de
mand, and, hence, still greater pressure for price
rises.
During a period of boom, proper fiscal policy calls
for an excess of tax collections and a budgetary sur
plus in order to place a damper on the boom. The
main problem at such a time is too much purchasing
power, not too little. Any actions which will have
the effect of expanding purchasing power still further
— and a tax reduction, unless offset by an equal
reduction of government, spending, represents such
an action—would accentuate the very conditions it
is most desirable to curb.
