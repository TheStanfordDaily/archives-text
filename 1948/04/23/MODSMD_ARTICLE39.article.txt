# Strategic Link to Alaska
## 
### 
VANCOUVER, B. C. (UP)—The Pacific Great
Eastern Railroad is a white elephant. It has cost
British Columbia taxpayers near $100,000,000 since it
was born in 1912.
However, the ,'145-mile railroad connecting Van
couver with Quesnel, B. C„ may become one of
great strategic interest in the Pacific Northwest.
If present plans go through, the PGE may become
a vital land link between Seattle and Alaska. It
would shorten by 1,000 miles the Alcan overland
route between Washington State and Alaska.
The event which has brought the PGE into the
forefront of interest is discovery of large deposits
of anthracite coal at Prince George, a $5 bus ride
from Quesnel.
That means running the railroad nearer to Alaska.
