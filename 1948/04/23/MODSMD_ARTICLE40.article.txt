One thing that can't be said about Encina is that
life there ever gets dull Quite the contrary.
Something rather funny happened to one of my
buddies last Saturday night„ What makes it so rare,
though, is that's actually true. In fact, my buddy
asked me to write it up in ihe express hope that the
participants in this little human interest drama
might get so shocked by seeing their actions in print
that they might change their ways. Sort of go up
to their rooms some night and check over their
personalities, to see whether or not there are any
little faults they should correct. Do them a world of
good, my buddy said.
Anyhow, about 7 p.m. last Saturday night my
buddy was in his room talking with some fellows who
had dropped by. He had a date with a girl in Roble
around before getting ready.
Suddenly the buzzer sounded. Everyone in the
room turned around and looked at it, wondering
who would want to telephone anyone on a Saturday
night. While they were thinking that one over, my
buddy's roommate spoke up and said that it was
probably the girl my buddy had a date with, calling
up to Dear John him. This apparently sounded reas
onable to my buddy, because he got up to answer it.
Being uncurious, the way boys usually are about
those things, everyone snickered after he left, and
started a discussion on some of the ingenious reasons
girls have given for breaking dates.
When my buddy got into the corridor, he found that
the "hall-romeo" was vising the house-phone. From
past experience, he realized that there was little point
in waiting for that lad to finish. So, he trotted up to
the next floor to use the house-phone up there. He
was a little out of breath when he reached the phone,
but he quickly picked it vip and waited for the
operator of the Encina-Toyon-Branner telephone ex
change to connect him with the person who was
phoning. That's right, he waited.
He must have waited a full three minutes before
he realized that the phone was apparently dead. With
that thought in mind, he ambled downstairs to a pay
phone outside his room. He plopped in his nickel
and phoned Encina. When the operator answered, he
told him that someone was trying to phone his

room. The operator said yes. That was the last
sound he heard on the phone, but he waited patiently.
Five minutes later his roommate poked his head
into the phone booth and told him that the room was
buzzed again. My buddy looked at the nearby hall
phone. The "hall-romeo" was still talking away on it
—to some fellow in Toyon, as he found out later.
My buddy then asked his roommate to run up to
one of the other floors and to try to vise a house
phone up there, to see if he could get the call on that.
A little after his roommate left, it must have seemed
like a good idea to my buddy to hang up, and then
call Encina again. That way he would at least get
to talk to the operator again.
So, he dropped in another nickel and dialed once
more. The operator answered, but before my buddy
could say a word he was connected—with his room
mate! That was rather funny, the way the two of
them started cursing into the phones. When he
couldn't go on repeating himself, my buddy hung up.
He dialed the Encina number again. When the op
erator answered, he begged not to connect him to
anyone until he had finished talking, and then re
peated the whole sad story, as I've told it above.
When he was through, he listened to hear what the
operator had to say for himself. And, this is what
he said, "Please don't talk to me now. I'm busy."
That flashing repartee almost broke my buddy's
spirit. After awhile he pulled himself together, and
phoned the girl he had a date with. When he was
connected with her, he asked if she had phoned
him. She said no, she hadn't. Thereupon he "Sobbed
out his tale of woe and tribulation. After he fin
ished, she said she was glad that lie phoned her, be
cause the same day, while riding a friend on the
handlebars of her bicycle, she herself had fallen off
and hurt her ankle. Therefore, she was sorry, but
she wouldn't be able to go to the dance with him,
but quickly added that a movie would be fine. So,
that's what they did. He took her to a movie.
By the way. my buddy and his roommates haven't
as yet found out who phoned. Not that they're
curious or anything like that, but if the person who
phoned them last Saturday night should read this,
they'd appreciate it very much if he would call
them once more.

cause the same day, while riding a friend on the
handlebars of her bicycle, she herself had fallen off
and hurt her ankle. Therefore, she was sorry, but
she wouldn't be able to go to the dance with him,
but quickly added that a movie would be fine. So,
that's what they did. He took her to a movie.
By the way. my buddy and his roommates haven't
as yet found out who phoned. Not that they're
curious or anything like that, but if the person who
phoned them last Saturday night should read this,
they'd appreciate it very much if he would call
them once more.
One thing that can't be said about Encina is that
life there ever gets dull Quite the contrary.
Something rather funny happened to one of my
buddies last Saturday night„ What makes it so rare,
though, is that's actually true. In fact, my buddy
asked me to write it up in ihe express hope that the
participants in this little human interest drama
might get so shocked by seeing their actions in print
that they might change their ways. Sort of go up
to their rooms some night and check over their
personalities, to see whether or not there are any
little faults they should correct. Do them a world of
good, my buddy said.
Anyhow, about 7 p.m. last Saturday night my
buddy was in his room talking with some fellows who
had dropped by. He had a date with a girl in Roble
around before getting ready.
Suddenly the buzzer sounded. Everyone in the
room turned around and looked at it, wondering
who would want to telephone anyone on a Saturday
night. While they were thinking that one over, my
buddy's roommate spoke up and said that it was
probably the girl my buddy had a date with, calling
up to Dear John him. This apparently sounded reas
onable to my buddy, because he got up to answer it.
Being uncurious, the way boys usually are about
those things, everyone snickered after he left, and
started a discussion on some of the ingenious reasons
girls have given for breaking dates.
When my buddy got into the corridor, he found that
the "hall-romeo" was vising the house-phone. From
past experience, he realized that there was little point
in waiting for that lad to finish. So, he trotted up to
the next floor to use the house-phone up there. He
was a little out of breath when he reached the phone,
but he quickly picked it vip and waited for the
operator of the Encina-Toyon-Branner telephone ex
change to connect him with the person who was
phoning. That's right, he waited.
He must have waited a full three minutes before
he realized that the phone was apparently dead. With
that thought in mind, he ambled downstairs to a pay
phone outside his room. He plopped in his nickel
and phoned Encina. When the operator answered, he
told him that someone was trying to phone his

room. The operator said yes. That was the last
sound he heard on the phone, but he waited patiently.
Five minutes later his roommate poked his head
into the phone booth and told him that the room was
buzzed again. My buddy looked at the nearby hall
phone. The "hall-romeo" was still talking away on it
—to some fellow in Toyon, as he found out later.
My buddy then asked his roommate to run up to
one of the other floors and to try to vise a house
phone up there, to see if he could get the call on that.
A little after his roommate left, it must have seemed
like a good idea to my buddy to hang up, and then
call Encina again. That way he would at least get
to talk to the operator again.
So, he dropped in another nickel and dialed once
more. The operator answered, but before my buddy
could say a word he was connected—with his room
mate! That was rather funny, the way the two of
them started cursing into the phones. When he
couldn't go on repeating himself, my buddy hung up.
He dialed the Encina number again. When the op
erator answered, he begged not to connect him to
anyone until he had finished talking, and then re
peated the whole sad story, as I've told it above.
When he was through, he listened to hear what the
operator had to say for himself. And, this is what
he said, "Please don't talk to me now. I'm busy."
That flashing repartee almost broke my buddy's
spirit. After awhile he pulled himself together, and
phoned the girl he had a date with. When he was
connected with her, he asked if she had phoned
him. She said no, she hadn't. Thereupon he "Sobbed
out his tale of woe and tribulation. After he fin
ished, she said she was glad that lie phoned her, be
cause the same day, while riding a friend on the
handlebars of her bicycle, she herself had fallen off
and hurt her ankle. Therefore, she was sorry, but

peated the whole sad story, as I've told it above.
When he was through, he listened to hear what the
operator had to say for himself. And, this is what
he said, "Please don't talk to me now. I'm busy."
That flashing repartee almost broke my buddy's
spirit. After awhile he pulled himself together, and
phoned the girl he had a date with. When he was
connected with her, he asked if she had phoned
him. She said no, she hadn't. Thereupon he "Sobbed
out his tale of woe and tribulation. After he fin
ished, she said she was glad that lie phoned her, be
cause the same day, while riding a friend on the
handlebars of her bicycle, she herself had fallen off
and hurt her ankle. Therefore, she was sorry, but
she wouldn't be able to go to the dance with him,
but quickly added that a movie would be fine. So,
that's what they did. He took her to a movie.
By the way. my buddy and his roommates haven't
as yet found out who phoned. Not that they're
curious or anything like that, but if the person who
phoned them last Saturday night should read this,
they'd appreciate it very much if he would call
them once more.
One thing that can't be said about Encina is that
life there ever gets dull Quite the contrary.
Something rather funny happened to one of my
buddies last Saturday night„ What makes it so rare,
though, is that's actually true. In fact, my buddy
asked me to write it up in ihe express hope that the
participants in this little human interest drama
might get so shocked by seeing their actions in print
that they might change their ways. Sort of go up
to their rooms some night and check over their
personalities, to see whether or not there are any
little faults they should correct. Do them a world of
good, my buddy said.
Anyhow, about 7 p.m. last Saturday night my
buddy was in his room talking with some fellows who
had dropped by. He had a date with a girl in Roble
around before getting ready.
Suddenly the buzzer sounded. Everyone in the
room turned around and looked at it, wondering
who would want to telephone anyone on a Saturday
night. While they were thinking that one over, my
buddy's roommate spoke up and said that it was
probably the girl my buddy had a date with, calling
up to Dear John him. This apparently sounded reas
onable to my buddy, because he got up to answer it.
Being uncurious, the way boys usually are about
those things, everyone snickered after he left, and
started a discussion on some of the ingenious reasons
girls have given for breaking dates.
When my buddy got into the corridor, he found that
the "hall-romeo" was vising the house-phone. From
past experience, he realized that there was little point
in waiting for that lad to finish. So, he trotted up to
the next floor to use the house-phone up there. He
was a little out of breath when he reached the phone,
but he quickly picked it vip and waited for the
operator of the Encina-Toyon-Branner telephone ex
change to connect him with the person who was
phoning. That's right, he waited.
He must have waited a full three minutes before
he realized that the phone was apparently dead. With
that thought in mind, he ambled downstairs to a pay
phone outside his room. He plopped in his nickel
and phoned Encina. When the operator answered, he
told him that someone was trying to phone his

room. The operator said yes. That was the last
sound he heard on the phone, but he waited patiently.
Five minutes later his roommate poked his head
into the phone booth and told him that the room was
buzzed again. My buddy looked at the nearby hall
phone. The "hall-romeo" was still talking away on it
—to some fellow in Toyon, as he found out later.
My buddy then asked his roommate to run up to
one of the other floors and to try to vise a house
phone up there, to see if he could get the call on that.
A little after his roommate left, it must have seemed
like a good idea to my buddy to hang up, and then
call Encina again. That way he would at least get
to talk to the operator again.
So, he dropped in another nickel and dialed once
more. The operator answered, but before my buddy
could say a word he was connected—with his room
mate! That was rather funny, the way the two of
them started cursing into the phones. When he
couldn't go on repeating himself, my buddy hung up.
He dialed the Encina number again. When the op
erator answered, he begged not to connect him to
anyone until he had finished talking, and then re
peated the whole sad story, as I've told it above.
When he was through, he listened to hear what the
operator had to say for himself. And, this is what
he said, "Please don't talk to me now. I'm busy."
