# '51, Spartans Run Today
## 
### 
Held in check for the past
three weeks, coach Ray Dean's
frosh track men unleash their
stored-up energies against the
San Jose State Spartans today
at Angell Field. The cinderfest is
scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m.
MENTOR DEAN looks to his
quarter mile entry again this after
noon as the locals' strongest event.
Cass Bly, Hicks Willams, Joss Scrog
gy, and Chuck Trask have turned
in consistently good times in prac
tice. and should give the Spartans
more than they can handle in the
440.
LAWRIE GORDON, half miler
who seldom runs over two minutes,
is the Indians' big hope in the 880.
The loss of Drew Terramorse, an
other ace half-miler, due to injuries,
weakened what might have been a
sure win.
