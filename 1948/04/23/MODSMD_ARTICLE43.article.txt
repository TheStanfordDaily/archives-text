# Cards Leave for USC Cinder Meet
## 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
Seeking their first victory
over USC in 15 years, 26 var
sity track men along with Coach
Jack Weiershauser will leave for
Los Angeles on the noon Day
light today. They will meet the
Trojans in the Coliseum tomorrow
afternoon.
The Indians will go into the im
portant tussle as slight underdogs
because of the Trojans' superiority
in the track events. However, the
Cards hold the edge in the field, and
it. is here that they must take at
least four out of the six first places.
THE INDIANS in the past two
weeks have rolled p;ist SJ State,
70 to 61, and the Olympic Club,
84 1-3 to 46 2-3. The team seems to
be iu good shape, with excellent
times recorded in both meets.
In the sprints the Trojans have
practically a cinch winner in Mel
Patton, who is the co-holder of the
world's record in the 100-yard dash.
However, the Cards have Gordy
Levy, a 9.9 sprinter in the century,
and Bud Ritcher, a 220 flash, who

could grab second places. Bob Wood,
sophomore ace, hasn't run up to par
as yet, but he could surprise.
Because of his recent 48.9 effort in
the quarter-mile, Larry HofT of the
Indians is a slight favorite to take

this event. Wells DeLoach is Troy's
j top performer in the 440. but he ran
j a poor fourth in his last meet. Pitch
i Johnson and A 1 Wilkins round out
; the Card entries in this event.
' It doesn't look too good for the

Indians in the distances. With Ro
land Sink of Troy as a double win
ner, and able support from Carmen
Bova, Art Nash, and Joe Amaya, a
second place by A 1 Lyons or Jose
Rael in either event for the Cards
would be a welcome surprise.
In the hurdles the situation is a
little different. Former JC champs
Downing McKee and Darrell Kreitz
will give the Trojans plenty of com
petition in the highs. Ron Frazier
of SC, who took a place in the na
tionals last year in the low hurdles,
will probably take his event, but
Bob Bryan and Kreitz are good con
tenders for the places.
BILL LAJISON may have to bet
ter his mark of 14 ft. in the pole
vault to win or even place against
Southern Cal's aces. The Trojans
have three men over 14 feet —Bob
Hart, John Montgomery, and John
Sanders.
The relay race looks extremely
close. Troy has done 3:19 to the
Cards' 3:20, but Stanford was never
closely pressed. A lot depends on
Larry HofT's condition. We'll know
Monday!

be iu good shape, with excellent
times recorded in both meets.
In the sprints the Trojans have
practically a cinch winner in Mel
Patton, who is the co-holder of the
world's record in the 100-yard dash.
However, the Cards have Gordy
Levy, a 9.9 sprinter in the century,
and Bud Ritcher, a 220 flash, who

could grab second places. Bob Wood,
sophomore ace, hasn't run up to par
as yet, but he could surprise.
Because of his recent 48.9 effort in
the quarter-mile, Larry HofT of the
Indians is a slight favorite to take

this event. Wells DeLoach is Troy's
j top performer in the 440. but he ran
j a poor fourth in his last meet. Pitch
i Johnson and A 1 Wilkins round out
; the Card entries in this event.
' It doesn't look too good for the

Indians in the distances. With Ro
land Sink of Troy as a double win
ner, and able support from Carmen
Bova, Art Nash, and Joe Amaya, a
second place by A 1 Lyons or Jose
Rael in either event for the Cards
would be a welcome surprise.
In the hurdles the situation is a
little different. Former JC champs
Downing McKee and Darrell Kreitz
will give the Trojans plenty of com
petition in the highs. Ron Frazier
of SC, who took a place in the na
tionals last year in the low hurdles,
will probably take his event, but
Bob Bryan and Kreitz are good con
tenders for the places.
BILL LAJISON may have to bet
ter his mark of 14 ft. in the pole
vault to win or even place against
Southern Cal's aces. The Trojans
have three men over 14 feet —Bob
Hart, John Montgomery, and John
Sanders.
The relay race looks extremely
close. Troy has done 3:19 to the
Cards' 3:20, but Stanford was never
closely pressed. A lot depends on
Larry HofT's condition. We'll know
Monday!
Seeking their first victory
over USC in 15 years, 26 var
sity track men along with Coach
Jack Weiershauser will leave for
Los Angeles on the noon Day
light today. They will meet the
Trojans in the Coliseum tomorrow
afternoon.
The Indians will go into the im
portant tussle as slight underdogs
because of the Trojans' superiority
in the track events. However, the
Cards hold the edge in the field, and
it. is here that they must take at
least four out of the six first places.
THE INDIANS in the past two
weeks have rolled p;ist SJ State,
70 to 61, and the Olympic Club,
84 1-3 to 46 2-3. The team seems to
