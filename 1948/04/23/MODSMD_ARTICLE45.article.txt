## Card Nine Seeks Upset Over Touted SC Squad 
### BY JOHN HALL 
USC's horsehide hotshots, still favorites to run off with all
the CIBA loop honors, will invade the Sunken Diamond tomor
row at 2:30 p.m. to meet an underdog Stanford nine that is in
the midst of a three-game losing streak.
It will be Stanford's seventh league game and USC's fifth.

(The Trojans play their fourth
against Santa Clara tonight.) Sam
Barry's pride and joy, Troy's ace
Hurler Wally Hood will probably be
used against the Broncos and will
not work against Stanford. Instead,
USC's number two man, Dick Bishop
will carry the load.
EITHER SOUTHPAW Dave Dahle
or lanky Dave Stott will draw the
starting mound assignment as Stan
ford goes out to prove itself against
the Terrible Trojans. The game will
be Stanford's final chance to get
back into the conference scramble,
and Harry Wolters will be shooting
the works when he sends his men
onto the field tomorrow.
Stanford has been up and down
like a yoyo this season. At one time
the Cards had put together a seven
game win streak, but they have also
looked very bad at times, as in their
recent 13 to 10 loss to COP.
IN LEAGUE PLAY, Stanford has
beaten UCLA and Santa Clara. The
varsity has also dropped games to
those two clubs, and has lost a pair
to California. The Indians are rest
ing now in a last-place tie with
UCLA at two wins and four losses.
Charlie Cole, a talented man
around the initial sack, has taken
over the team's batting lead. Cole
got off to a slow start this season,
but has pounded out five hits in the
last two games for a CIBA aver
aye of .304. He is followed by long
ball-hitting Bob Nava at .272. Most
of Nava's hits are of extra base
variety.
TED NELL'S bat has been slow
in going to work this season. Nell, ,
who was a nifty man at the plate i
last year, is still below .200. But he
is a great defensive man, and his j
work in the center patch has been
brilliant at times.
Catcher Frank McGraw will prob
ably catch tomorrow afternoon.

ag e places hi in

He is an excellent

cr.
This is Arce's
second season on
the Card varsity,
and his peppery
play is li e 1 p 112 u 1
when the going
{iois tough.
USC's horsehide hotshots, still favorites to run off with all
the CIBA loop honors, will invade the Sunken Diamond tomor
row at 2:30 p.m. to meet an underdog Stanford nine that is in
the midst of a three-game losing streak.
It will be Stanford's seventh league game and USC's fifth.

(The Trojans play their fourth
against Santa Clara tonight.) Sam
Barry's pride and joy, Troy's ace
Hurler Wally Hood will probably be
used against the Broncos and will
not work against Stanford. Instead,
USC's number two man, Dick Bishop
will carry the load.
EITHER SOUTHPAW Dave Dahle
or lanky Dave Stott will draw the
starting mound assignment as Stan
ford goes out to prove itself against
the Terrible Trojans. The game will
be Stanford's final chance to get
back into the conference scramble,
and Harry Wolters will be shooting
the works when he sends his men
onto the field tomorrow.
Stanford has been up and down
like a yoyo this season. At one time
the Cards had put together a seven
game win streak, but they have also
looked very bad at times, as in their
recent 13 to 10 loss to COP.
IN LEAGUE PLAY, Stanford has
beaten UCLA and Santa Clara. The
varsity has also dropped games to
those two clubs, and has lost a pair
to California. The Indians are rest
ing now in a last-place tie with
UCLA at two wins and four losses.
Charlie Cole, a talented man
around the initial sack, has taken
over the team's batting lead. Cole
got off to a slow start this season,
but has pounded out five hits in the
last two games for a CIBA aver
aye of .304. He is followed by long
ball-hitting Bob Nava at .272. Most
of Nava's hits are of extra base
variety.
TED NELL'S bat has been slow
in going to work this season. Nell, ,
who was a nifty man at the plate i
last year, is still below .200. But he
is a great defensive man, and his j
work in the center patch has been
brilliant at times.
Catcher Frank McGraw will prob
ably catch tomorrow afternoon.
