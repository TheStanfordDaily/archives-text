If comparisons mean anything,
Coach Eddie Twiggs' varsity golf
j ers should have little trouble in
| downing California on the local
I links tomorrow.
So far this season both teams
have met a strong San Jose sextet,
Cal taking a 7-20 trouncing and the
Indians dropping a close 12 1 to
1412 decision.
STANFORD WILL HAVE Tom
Lambie, Bob Rosbure, Jack Shuler,
Bud Moe, Ernie Kellberg, and Bob
Crozier in the starting lineup to
morrow. All except Crozier and
Moe are veterans of last year's
squad, which took third-place hon
ors in the Nationals in Ann Arbor.
In three appearances so far this
season, Crozier and Moe have
shown every indication of develop
ing into top - notch golfers. Both
turned in steady performances at

Santa Cruz and against Sun Jose
and the alumni.
TEEING-OFF TIME for the var
sity-Cal match is 9 a.m. for the
singles and 1:30 p.m. for the doub
les.
Stanford's freshman golfers en
tertain the Ca! frosh here tomorrow
in a 36-holc match, teeing off at 9:30
a.m. in the singles and 2 p.m. in
the doubles.
Frosh golfers who will probably
see action against the Cubs are
Jerry Cassaday, Francis Watson,
Stu Rhodes. Bill Sight. Ross Moun
sev, and Art Eckhardt.
