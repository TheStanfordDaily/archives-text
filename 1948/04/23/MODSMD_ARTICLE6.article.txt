## 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Stanford varsity faces the
University of California mermen
tomorrow afternoon in a renewal of
one of intercollegiate swimming's
oldest rivalries. The two teams will
square off for the 32nd time at the
Encina Pools beginning at 1:30.
THE MEET has been moved
ahead from'its' originally scheduled
starting time in order to enable
sports fans to witness both the
swimming meet and the USC base
ball game. Tariff for the event, ac-

Stanford's undefeated freshman
swimming team tangles with the
Cal Cubs at the Encina Pools to
morrow morning at 11. The meet
will he the last home appearance
for the Indian yearlings this rea
son.

cording to the SAC. will be 40 cents
for students and 80 cents for the
general public.
IN THE FIRST race, the Stanford
medley relay team of A 1 Weeden,
Don Hester, and Warren Cutting
will make an all-out attempt on the
conference mark for the 300-yard
distance. The standing record, set
by three USC swimmers at the En
cina Pools in 1940, is 2:59.6. With
Dick Narver swimming in place of
Cutting, the trio swam an unofficial
2:57.7 against the Olympic Club
last week.
Hester will return in his special
ty, the 200-yard breaststroke race,
with the intention of lowering his j
own PCC record of 2:27.3. Lanky j
Don swam an easy 2:25 a week ago,
and is capable of knocking several
seconds oft' that time if he is I
pressed.
STILL ANOTHER RECORD at
tempt will be made when Stan
ford's Ralph Sala enters the water i
for the 220-yard freestyle event, j
Sala turned in the best furlong seen
on the coast in 13 years when he |
swam a 2:14.3 against the Olympic j
Club last week. The existing PCC
stendard of 2:12.3 was set by Gil- i
hula of USC in 1935.
Ralph is one of the fastest im- ,
proving swimmers on the Indian ,
team, and nearly all observers are \
convinced that it is just a matter I
of time until he cracks the record.
Tomorrow could be the day.
THE SPRINTS should be the best
races of the afternoon. The 50 is
anybody's race. Anderson and Mor
ketter will be the favorites, but
Stanford's Woody Hoogs and Cal's
Don Fisher are in a position to sur- j
prise.
In the 100. Anderson and Mor- '
ketter are more in a class by them
selves, but Card Ed Major will be
battling it out with Fisher in what
should be a close race for third.
Stanford entry Jack Weeden fig
ures to be all alone at the finish in 1
the backstroke race, as does Hester
in the breaststroke, and Sala in 1
both the 220- and 440-yard free- !
style. However, the races for sec- !
onds and thirds in all of these i
events will be very close.
