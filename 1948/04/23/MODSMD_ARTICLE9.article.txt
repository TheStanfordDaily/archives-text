# More Liberal Late Leaves Proposed
## 
### 
More liberal social regulations,
designed to develop responsibility
and discretion in the college wom
en, were suggested to Women's
Conference yesterday by Ginny
Davis of Elm Cottage.
The proposed regulations are the
second part of the Women's Coun
cil revisions which have been drawn
up by a group of Union Unit girls.
The reorganization of Council was
brought up in Conference last
week.
The proposed program is as fol
lows:
1. Two 2:3o*s a weekend, as
women were allowed in 1940. One
of those 2:3o's could be taken in
the middle of the week.
2. Unlimited 2:3o's for senior
women.
3. Unlimited l:3o's for junior
women.
The above two would apply, re

gardless of grade-point average.
4. Twenty 1:30 floaters for soph
omores. Sophomores who were mi
nus the previous quarter would
have ten 1:30 floaters. Sophomores
who are minus totally would revert
to freshman standing.
5. Freshman late leaves would be
the same, except that number 1,
above, applies to them also.
It was felt, Miss Davis said, that
the present social regulations are
unnecessary and a hindrance.
One function of college life is to
develop responsibility and discre
tion in the individual — an end
which would be better accom
plished by more liberal social reg
ulations, Miss Davis said.
The program, she added, though
not too liberal for freshmen, pro
vides them opportunity to progress
through college life, so that they

would graduate capable of handling
their own social affairs.
It was also felt that the unlim
ited leaves would relieve the pres
sure of using up an entire late
leave.
One member of Conferenc sug
gested that the plan would not take
into account academic responsibili
ties in upper division. However,
Miss Davis said, junior and senior
girls should be able to balance then
work and play by that time.
If they cannot do this, she went
on, they will be caught by the
more stringent academic regula
tions, and their places will be taken
by other people.
This plan is merely a suggestion,
Miss Davis added, and if it went
into effect it would be on a trial
basis at first. The plan will be
discussed in the living units at
house meetings.

1. Two 2:3o*s a weekend, as
women were allowed in 1940. One
of those 2:3o's could be taken in
the middle of the week.
2. Unlimited 2:3o's for senior
women.
3. Unlimited l:3o's for junior
women.
The above two would apply, re

gardless of grade-point average.
4. Twenty 1:30 floaters for soph
omores. Sophomores who were mi
nus the previous quarter would
have ten 1:30 floaters. Sophomores
who are minus totally would revert
to freshman standing.
5. Freshman late leaves would be
the same, except that number 1,
above, applies to them also.
It was felt, Miss Davis said, that
the present social regulations are
unnecessary and a hindrance.
One function of college life is to
develop responsibility and discre
tion in the individual — an end
which would be better accom
plished by more liberal social reg
ulations, Miss Davis said.
The program, she added, though
not too liberal for freshmen, pro
vides them opportunity to progress
through college life, so that they

would graduate capable of handling
their own social affairs.
It was also felt that the unlim
ited leaves would relieve the pres
sure of using up an entire late
leave.
One member of Conferenc sug
gested that the plan would not take
into account academic responsibili
ties in upper division. However,
Miss Davis said, junior and senior
girls should be able to balance then
work and play by that time.
If they cannot do this, she went
on, they will be caught by the
more stringent academic regula
tions, and their places will be taken
by other people.
This plan is merely a suggestion,
Miss Davis added, and if it went
into effect it would be on a trial
basis at first. The plan will be
discussed in the living units at
house meetings.
More liberal social regulations,
designed to develop responsibility
and discretion in the college wom
en, were suggested to Women's
Conference yesterday by Ginny
Davis of Elm Cottage.
The proposed regulations are the
second part of the Women's Coun
cil revisions which have been drawn
up by a group of Union Unit girls.
The reorganization of Council was
brought up in Conference last
week.
The proposed program is as fol
lows:
1. Two 2:3o*s a weekend, as
women were allowed in 1940. One
of those 2:3o's could be taken in
the middle of the week.
2. Unlimited 2:3o's for senior
women.
3. Unlimited l:3o's for junior
women.

gardless of grade-point average.

omores. Sophomores who were mi

who are minus totally would revert
