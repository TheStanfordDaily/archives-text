### 
WASHINGTON, April 25 (UP)
â€”President Truman will send
Congress a plan for limited ship
ments of American arms to the
five - nation "Western Union"
within the next three weeks, in
formed Congressional sources
said today.
The plan already has been pre
sented informally to Senate Presi
dent Arthur H. Vandenberg by
Undersecretary of State Robert A.
Lovett in two private conferences,
PATTERNED ALTER war - time
lend-lease, American military back
ing thus woidd be provided for the
five nations which last month signed
a mutual defense and economic pact
at Brussels--Britain, France, Bel
gium, the Netherlands, and Luxem
bourg.
The executive committee of this
"Western Union" met for the first
time in London yesterday. It is ex
pected to establish a permanent mil
itary committee immediately, prob
ably including representatives of the
five general staffs.
ACTION OF THAT TYPE is being
awaited in both Congressional and
administration circles as the prelude
to assurances of American military
backing.
The U.S. plan has been put in final
form. But the return of Secretary
of State George C. Marshall from
Bogota, Colombia, may put new
pressure behind it.
