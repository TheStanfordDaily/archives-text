To the Editor:
Friday's editorial. "It Can't Happen Here," is a discredit to both the
newspaper profession, and more particularly to the students of Stanford
University. There is nothing worse in the world of journalism than a
bigoted, self-righteous person going off half-cocked in a half baked manner.
I suggest that The Daily keep to its place in campus affairs, and follow
a course of non-partisanship in campus politics. If Friday's editorial is
representative of Daily policy, then it is certainly not a publication repre
senting the best interests of the student bodv.
