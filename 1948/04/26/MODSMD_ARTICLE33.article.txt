To the Editor:
Who the hell do you think owns the Stanford Daily anywayâ€”the stu
dents or you?
William Randolph can print as many one-sided views as he pleases.
But in his case, he owns the paper, and the people can buy a rival paper.
We. however, have no competitor-sheet to turn to. You may be violently
opposed to someone or something. Go ahead, print it. But since we own
the paper, we might also like to see Bob Hope's and G. R. Lee's side of
the story alongside.
