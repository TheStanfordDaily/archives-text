To the Editor:
Friday's editorial displayed an amazing lack of discrimination and in
sight into the reasons for the perhaps surprising strength this candidate
demonstrated.
We submit the votes for the "git-tar" playing nominee stemmed from
two sources: (1) Those who know the candidate and believe him best
suited for the office regardless of his campaign methods; and (2) Those
who voted for him to indicate that student body government at Stanford
is a complete farce finding its logical conclusion in this campaign.
The Daily's lack of discernment will accrue only to the advantage of
thp cause which it attacks. Had The Daily remained silent, there is no
doubt that the student body in the final elections would realize that
student body government at Stanford, although far from perfect, is not
a farcical institution but is worthy of continuance as a valuable training
ground and a responsible organization within its scope. We believe that
the student body would try to cast an intelligent-vote for the candidates
•on their merit as demonstrated by their campaign speeches, their per
sonal appearance and interests, and most important, their record of
achievement at Stanford.
But lending support to those who believe student government is run
by a group of narrow, somewhat dull BMOCs, The Daily
came out in an editorial libelous to the candidate in particular and
insulting to the student body in general. If The Daily wished to attack
a campaign which began as a farce and has become a serious atte'mpt
to win the presidency, it could have done so far better than it did in its
bombastic blast of Friday morning.
