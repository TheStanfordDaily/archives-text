To the Editor:
Confidentially. The Daily has done it again. For some time now I have
maintained that The Daily, if nothing else, has the virtue of consistency.
That is, if there is a wrong side to an issue, The Daily is for it. You
have been a trifle slow in condemning a candidate, but you got around
to it finally. But I am disappointed.
After all, on the Bridge Rally, you were out with a scathing editorial
even before the thing took place. Now that is what I call a real scoop.
Are you slowing up? Keep on with the good work . . . maintain that
policy of stamping out any indication of frivolous thought (that is, any
thing less weighty than the current UN bickerings). . . . Down with
any upstart individuals who show some sign of life around this nice
old mossy institution. . . . Away with such childish humorists who still
naively think that something can be clever besides the smutty Bull Session
remarks.
EXCELSIOR!
WILLIAM O. JONES
