To the Editor:
By now most of us have been regaled with a flamboyant election cam
paign—through strategically-placed, ten-foot photographs, blaring loud
speakers, and a series of lively noonday clambakes at the Cellar, with
singing and a guitar. All of this has been unquestionably entertaining.
The fact that the candidate successfully withstood the rigors of this
week's primary election, however, should give some of us pause.
Never having met one of the candidates, I can judge his attributes of
leadership and integrity solely on the basis of his public statements and
actions. To all appearances, his platform is rooted firmly on his ad
mitted mediocrity and a desire to speak on KSU and write for The Daily.
Beyond this, he has demonstrated that he can make faces, play the
guitar and sing pleasantly, somewhat in the manner of one of our better
known Alabama governors. He would be an undoubted asset to the
Spring Show or "Gaieties. Unfortunately, he is" running for ASSU presi
dent—which may or may not mean something—and doing quite well for
himself.
There have been constant complaints to the effect that student govern
ment is impotent, and, in general, a farce. Given a chance to do some
thing about this claim last Wednesday, the student body was apparently
determined merely to prove it.
