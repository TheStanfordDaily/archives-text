SACRAMENTO (UP) —State and local- officials
from Washington, Oregon, and California have been
told that every effort is being made to activate a
national civilian defense organization within the
next few months.
Clement D. Johnston, assistant federal director
for civilian defense planning, told delegates the
Pacific Coast Board of Intergovernmental Rela
tions here his agency would like to have a program
laid out in three or four months.
Johnston said that any civil defense setup must
"be right the first time" in the event of another war.
"There will be no opportunity for second guessing
this time," he said. "There will be no England,
France, or Philippines to protect us from the realities
of war for a while."
Johnston said the main problem to he met is to
overcome an apparent feeling by the public that
"there is something immoral" about civilian de
fense.
"We've got to get through that before we can do
anything," he said.
