# The 						Unknown "Carrier"

SAN FRANCISCO (UP) —Thousands of persons
apparently in perfect health have been branded as
the "polio carriers" responsible for spreading infan
tile paralysis epidemics across the nation.
Dr. Albert B. Sabin, University of Cincinnati
polio specialist, said that countless persons not
aware they are stricken by poliomyelitis are the
greatest known source of the crippling epidemics.
He reported that polio-infected persons can live
indefinitely without becoming paralyzed or showing
and definite symptoms other than "summer grippe"
or a "summer sore throat."
However, he told the American College of Physi
cians convention, when the balance between the
body's defensive systems and the polio virus is
upset, the disease may strike its victim down almost
immediately.
"There are many cases on record of attacks within
24 hours after fatiguing exercise or severe exertion,"
Sabin said. "This may be the 'agent provocateur'
which upsets the equilibrium between the virus and
its human host."
Sabin told nearly 15.00 ft physicians that he ex
amined a group of Cincinnati children afflicted with
"summer grippe." They were only mildly sick, but
more than half of them showed evidence of polio in
their spinal fluids. None became paralyzed.
"Paralytic polio is only one part of a clinical
spectrum resulting from infection with the virus,"
he explained. "Persons infected may show no obvious
signs of disease, or have only a mild illness. Some
may develop a stiff neck and spine, or the obvious
and frightening symptoms of paralysis in some
degree."
Science does not yet know the extent to which
this "armed truce" between the disease organism
and the victim can exist, Sabin said, nor exactly
how the disease is transmitted. Hut the only place
in the body where the virus is commonly found—
in addition to the nervous system—is the intes
tinal tract. Polio's crippling damage is concen
trated on the nervous system.
Sabin said the spread of infantile paralysis prob
ably was accomplished either by being transmitted
from the nose and mouth of one person and then
breathed in by another; by contaminated food, or by
dissemination of flies contaminated by infected hu
man excrement.
Those who carry the polio virus, like "Typhoid
Mary" of the middle-ages, are more likely to infect
others, he added, than individuals who become para
lyzed—who usually are removed from contact with
others and so are less likely to be responsible for
spread of the crippling disease.
