PHILADELPHIA (UP) â€” Scientists at the Fels
Planetarium of the Franklin Institute are illustrating
ways by which the world might come to an end.
The astronomers show some of the violent possi

bilities. such as an explosion of the sun which
would burn all vestiges of life 011 earth. Great
volcanic eruptions or by sweeping tidal waves.
The scientists coolly admit that end of the world,
due to some unforeseen cataclysm, might happen at
any moment.
"Our earth, they say. "is delicately balanced
between the too hot and the too cold, the too dry
and too wet. for life of the kind we know."
If something should happen to upset the existing
conditions most of the higher life on earth would
come to an end, they add.
