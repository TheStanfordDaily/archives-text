## History 1948 
### 
This is a report on the iorgotten home front. Wor
ries about Russia, Greece, Palestine, and half a dozen
other countries have turned our thoughts from our
own problems. In face of a critical foreign situation
we have paid too little attention to domestic diffi
culties that are rapidly becoming critical.

Economists can sketch much of
the trouble with a few figures. The
National City Bank of New York—
hardly pro-communist — reports
that corporation profits after taxes
were 37 per cent higher in 1947
than in 1946. They were more than
double the profits of the big boom
year of 1920.
Al the same time a congressional
joint committee and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics report that be
tween June '46, the last month

under bureaucratic OPA, and December '47 prices of
consumer goods were up 25 per cent, food prices up
42 per cent.
The same sources point out that during that time
the spendable wages of manufacturing workers in
creased only 15 per cent.
In short, profits are up 37 per cent, prices 25 per
cent, and wages 15 per cent.
These dry statistics mean a lot in terms of politics,
prosperity, and peace.
They show how wrong the politicians were who
abolished price controls, claiming it would result in
higher production and lower prices. They were right
about production — it increased 15 per cent last year
over the year before. But prices keep going up. In
cidentally, these are the politicians who will likely
take over our government next November.
To Joe Smith, worker, the figures mean that he
can afford to buy less and less of the things he
needs. While business keeps getting a larger slice of
the pie, he must do with less food, fewer clothes, and
less adequate medical care.
To the country as a whole, they mean a serious
danger of runaway inflation. Writes the joint con
gressional committee:
"Inflationary movements develop firm roots during
wars . . .and feed themselves to higher and higher
levels unless the basic causal pressures are rechan
neled or removed."
What is Congress doing to remove these basic
pressures? Nothing. It pays no heed to the expert
counsel of its own advisers that at least moderate
controls are desperately needed. Instead it parrots
morosely the phony slogan of the NAM: more pro
duction.
Congressional advisers have pointed out repeatedly
that with the large expenditures under the Marshall
Plan and our increased armaments program these
pressures will vastly increase. They will more than
offset any normal postwar readjustment, and drive
the spiral up, faster and faster, to the inevitable
wreck.
For all the attention the advisers get, they might
just as well be speaking to the inmates of an insane
asylum.
To a large extent the peace of the world depends
on us. It has been made clear to us that the recon
struction of Europe is essential to avert communism
and war. We have undertaken large scale commit
ments throughout the world.
It should be equally clear that Europe cannot be
rebuilt, that our commitments cannot be kept, unless
we keep our own economy in a healthy state. If we
cannot shed a few of our economic prejudices to
avoid inflation we shall lose both prosperity and
peace. If we insist on using 19th century ideas to
solve 20th century problems, we will never see the
21st.

morosely the phony slogan of the NAM: more pro
duction.
Congressional advisers have pointed out repeatedly
that with the large expenditures under the Marshall
Plan and our increased armaments program these
pressures will vastly increase. They will more than
offset any normal postwar readjustment, and drive
the spiral up, faster and faster, to the inevitable
wreck.
For all the attention the advisers get, they might
just as well be speaking to the inmates of an insane
asylum.
To a large extent the peace of the world depends
on us. It has been made clear to us that the recon
struction of Europe is essential to avert communism
and war. We have undertaken large scale commit
ments throughout the world.
It should be equally clear that Europe cannot be
rebuilt, that our commitments cannot be kept, unless
we keep our own economy in a healthy state. If we
cannot shed a few of our economic prejudices to
avoid inflation we shall lose both prosperity and
peace. If we insist on using 19th century ideas to
solve 20th century problems, we will never see the
21st.

This is a report on the iorgotten home front. Wor
ries about Russia, Greece, Palestine, and half a dozen
other countries have turned our thoughts from our
own problems. In face of a critical foreign situation
we have paid too little attention to domestic diffi
culties that are rapidly becoming critical.

Economists can sketch much of
the trouble with a few figures. The
National City Bank of New York—
hardly pro-communist — reports
that corporation profits after taxes
were 37 per cent higher in 1947
than in 1946. They were more than
double the profits of the big boom
year of 1920.
Al the same time a congressional
joint committee and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics report that be
tween June '46, the last month

under bureaucratic OPA, and December '47 prices of
consumer goods were up 25 per cent, food prices up
42 per cent.
The same sources point out that during that time
the spendable wages of manufacturing workers in
creased only 15 per cent.
In short, profits are up 37 per cent, prices 25 per
cent, and wages 15 per cent.
These dry statistics mean a lot in terms of politics,
prosperity, and peace.
They show how wrong the politicians were who
abolished price controls, claiming it would result in
higher production and lower prices. They were right
about production — it increased 15 per cent last year
over the year before. But prices keep going up. In
cidentally, these are the politicians who will likely
take over our government next November.
To Joe Smith, worker, the figures mean that he
can afford to buy less and less of the things he
needs. While business keeps getting a larger slice of
the pie, he must do with less food, fewer clothes, and
less adequate medical care.
To the country as a whole, they mean a serious
danger of runaway inflation. Writes the joint con
gressional committee:
"Inflationary movements develop firm roots during
wars . . .and feed themselves to higher and higher
levels unless the basic causal pressures are rechan
neled or removed."
What is Congress doing to remove these basic
pressures? Nothing. It pays no heed to the expert
counsel of its own advisers that at least moderate
controls are desperately needed. Instead it parrots
morosely the phony slogan of the NAM: more pro
duction.
