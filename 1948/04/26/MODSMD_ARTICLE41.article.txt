Whoever thought up the bright idea of having a
funny Chappie this last issue will have a lot to
answer for when he reaches the Pearly Gates.
Not only that, but his journey to his ultimate
reward might be speeded up a little if some of my
buddies find out who he is. They're awafully mad at
him. Last night they were trying to decide among
themselves what order they were to follow if they
should ever meet him. Everyone claimed the honor
of getting the first chance at beating him up.
One of our little group is an awfully swell fellow.
There isn't anything he wouldn't do for any of us.
Like they say of such lads in the cowboy books,
he'd lend you his last dollar. He's a nice, smiling
fellow, always ready for a laugh. But, lately he's em
bittered everyone.
And, all my buddies lay the blame on the guy
who got the bright idea of making the last Chappie
funny. They accuse him of making our friend the
way he is, forcing us to shun him.
Last Wednesday this buddy of mine who has lately
become so unpopular with us came running in with
the Chappie. He was laughing so hard at all the
funny comics and stuff that the rest of us got rather

curious. From past 'experience, we knew that the
Chappie wasn't worth the two-bits asked for it. So.
some of us went around and borrowed copies from
fellows who had bought the issue and had already
finished reading it.
We were expecting the usual jokes stolen from
the usual "funny-books.' So. we were pleasantly
surprised to find out that some original fellow on
the Chappie staff had gotten the bright idea of bur
lesqueing comic strips and The Stanford Daily. We
thought it was awfully funny.
But. after reading and laughing at it for awhile,
we turned to other interests. Not so with this un
fortunate buddy of mine that we're temporarily
avoiding. He, apparently, can't get used to the idea
that at last the Chappie has come up with something
funny.
We're a little more blase and sophisticated than our
hapless friend. We realize, also, that undoubtedly
there are seniors on campus that can remember other
funny Chappies. So. we're pretty tired of having
our buddy constantly regaling us with tid-bits about
the Prone Ranger, the Banshee, etc.
No. funny as it is, my buddies prefer the old-style
Chappies.

become so unpopular with us came running in with
the Chappie. He was laughing so hard at all the
funny comics and stuff that the rest of us got rather

curious. From past 'experience, we knew that the
Chappie wasn't worth the two-bits asked for it. So.
some of us went around and borrowed copies from
fellows who had bought the issue and had already
finished reading it.
We were expecting the usual jokes stolen from
the usual "funny-books.' So. we were pleasantly
surprised to find out that some original fellow on
the Chappie staff had gotten the bright idea of bur
lesqueing comic strips and The Stanford Daily. We
thought it was awfully funny.
But. after reading and laughing at it for awhile,
we turned to other interests. Not so with this un
fortunate buddy of mine that we're temporarily
avoiding. He, apparently, can't get used to the idea
that at last the Chappie has come up with something
funny.
We're a little more blase and sophisticated than our
hapless friend. We realize, also, that undoubtedly
there are seniors on campus that can remember other
funny Chappies. So. we're pretty tired of having
our buddy constantly regaling us with tid-bits about
the Prone Ranger, the Banshee, etc.
No. funny as it is, my buddies prefer the old-style
Chappies.
Whoever thought up the bright idea of having a
funny Chappie this last issue will have a lot to
answer for when he reaches the Pearly Gates.
Not only that, but his journey to his ultimate
reward might be speeded up a little if some of my
buddies find out who he is. They're awafully mad at
him. Last night they were trying to decide among
themselves what order they were to follow if they
should ever meet him. Everyone claimed the honor
of getting the first chance at beating him up.
One of our little group is an awfully swell fellow.
There isn't anything he wouldn't do for any of us.
Like they say of such lads in the cowboy books,
he'd lend you his last dollar. He's a nice, smiling
fellow, always ready for a laugh. But, lately he's em
bittered everyone.
And, all my buddies lay the blame on the guy
who got the bright idea of making the last Chappie
funny. They accuse him of making our friend the
way he is, forcing us to shun him.
