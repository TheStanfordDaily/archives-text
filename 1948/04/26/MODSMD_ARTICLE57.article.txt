# Late Trojan Rally Downs Indian Nine
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Stanford came within one out of turning back USC's league
leading Trojans Saturday, but faltered in the 10th inning as
USC pushed over two runs to win, 12 to 12. The game was
played on the Sunken Diamond.
Three thousand fans were on hand to see one of the most

crowd-pleasing games of the season.
The lead changed hands seven dif
ferent times, as Stanford outhit,
out hustled, and did everything but
outscot;e the touted Trojans.
TIIE CARDS led 10 to D in the
ninth and had victory within their
grasp, as with two out and a man
on second, they needed just one
more putout. But Trojan power hit
ter, Hank Workman came through
with a clutch single to drive in the
lying run. With two men on in
the top of the 10th, Troy's Dick
Henley tripled to deep left-center
and that was the ballgame.
Stanford's starting hurler, Dave
Dahle turned in his best performance
of the season. He limited the Trojans
to only five hits in eight innings,
and would have been complete mas
ter if his outfielders had not gone to
pieces and handed the Troys four
unearned runs. Dahle struck out
seven men and retired the side in
order in the second, fifth and sev
enth innings.
Seven Card errors paved the way
for USC's earlier scores and kept
Dahle in constant trouble. Harry
Wolters decided to relieve Dahle
with Dave Stott in the eighth, but
by that time Trojan bats had
warmed up. Stott gave up four hits
and three runs to become the losing
pitcher.
USC COACH Sam Barry had to
call on his ace, Wonderboy Wally
Hood to do a relief job in the last
three frames. Hooci liad pitched nine
innings the night before against
Santa Clara (winning 8 to 2), but
was called to the rescue as the
Barrymen went all out to win.
USC's first two pitchers. Bill
Horst and Dick Bishop, couldn't stop
the worked-up Indian batsmen, but
Hood had the stuff to do it. He gave
up two hits in the eighth, but
wasn't touched in the final two in
nings.
Stanford outhit USC 12 to 9.
Blasting Bob Nava was the day's
heaviest hitter, collecting a home
run, double, and single. Nava was
followed by Bill Aree. who picked
lip three single, and Charlie Cole
and Buck Brownson with two hits
apiece.
THE INDIANS SCORED four runs
in the third to, lead ti to 4. Ted
Nell started the rally with a single.
Charlie Cole walked and Bob Nava
singled to load the bases. Nell was
forced across on Melton's walk and
Cole scored on Dingfelder's fly to
centerfield. Then, after Arce had
singled to load the bases again,
Brownson singled sharply to drive
in two more runs.
Bob Nava's 400-foot home run
over the centerfielder's head with
two men on base, brought in three
more runs in the sixth inning. It
also gave Stanford a temporary 9
to 7 lead. USC's Jim Brideweser
smashed out two triples to lead his
team in hitting.
FOUL Tll'S: Wally Hood's win
â€¢Saturday gave him two wins for
tlu* weekend and made him the
league's leading hurler. . . . Bench
jockeys were giving Trojan sec
ond sacker. Art Mazmanian. a bad
time. Mazmanian talked too much

and too loud to suit the fans, but
he got in he last word when he
singled the game's winning run in
the 10th. . . . Charlie Colo con
tinues to lead Stanford hitters.
His two hits for three trips to the
plate gave him a season's total of
!) for 2<i and a CIBA average of
. . . Elevator Sam Barry was
up and down the Trojan bench all
afternoon. lie argued with the
umpires, made several trips to the
bullpen to talk with his pitchers,
used pinch runners and pinch hit
ters, and kept his men hustling all
the time. He likes to win his ball
games.
