# Yearling Thinclads Defeat San Jose
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman track team
remained unbeaten by defeating the
San Jose State freshmen 67 I ■> to 63\ >
at Angell Field last Friday. The
win was the Cards' second in two
meets this spring.
The final outcome was in doubt
all the way and it wasn't until the
final event—the mile relay—that the
meet was won. - Going into that race
the Indians were trailing by one
point and they needed a victory to
clinch the meet.
Outstanding Stanford perform
ances were turned in by Cass Bly
in the quarter-mi!e and by Merrill
Van Sant in the broad jump. Bly
ran the 4-10 in the excellent time of
:49.5. Van Sant's leap in the broad
jump carried him 23 feet 1 inch to
an easy first place.
