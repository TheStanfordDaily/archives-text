# Stanford's Soph Cindermen Nearly Topple Mighty Troy
## 
### 
Stanford's sophomore track team
returned to the campus last night
alter coming within 11 points ol' be
ing the first Card squad to defeat
Dean Cromwell's vaunted Troy cin
dermen in 15 years.
Individually, Indians outdid them
selves in almost every event, but
Ihe best they could do collectively
was a 60 to 71 "moral victory."
The same Stanford team that could
score only 36 points against USC last
year maintained itself on almost
even teams with the renowned Tro
jan cindermen down to the final
event, the mile relay. Had the Cards
picked up one more third place
somewhere down the line and had
Larry Hoff been able to run the
anchor lap in the relay, the meet
would have gone the other way.
The Indians held their own and
then some in the field events but it
was Troy's superiority on the track
that spelled their defeat.
All that the Indian weightmen and
jumpers could do was not enough to
offset this difference.
Outstanding Indian performances
were turned in by shotputter Gtis
Chandler, who improved upon his
best mark of 53 ft. 2 in. by two
inches; Gay Bryan, \vho scored two
firsts and a tie for first in the low
hurdles and the jumps, and Steve
McKee who hit 150 feet in the discus

for the first time in his life.
