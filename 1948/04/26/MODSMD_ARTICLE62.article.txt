### 
A Stanford professor Satur
day warned against the "dan
gerous practice" of slapping the
"pink" label on a school be
cause it presents a viewpoint
with which the critic does not
agree.
Speaking before a Stanford alum
ni conference in Fresno, Dr. A. John
Bartky, clean of the Stanford School
of Education, pointed out the real
dangers of using the red tag indis
criminately.
HE SPOKE on the subject "Is
the Little Red Schoolhouse Pink?"'
It is our duty "to cry to the high
heavens if we feel that a school is
becoming subversive," he declared.
"But if we persist in calling every
thing pink, we will soon lull the
public into a complacency about the
whole mater. Crying pink too often
will bring the same result as crying
wolf too often."
THERE IS A PERIL, he said, that
much of what certain critics call
subversive is really the teaching of
American ideals.
He said that school.: should teach
two kinds of history.
"One is the romantic history which
emotionalizes and fixes our Ameri
can ideals. The other is a scientific
history which investigates how well
we have followed our American
ideals."
IN '1 HIS LATTER type of history,
he said, the school must point out
our mistakes in history which were
in conflict with the ideals.
When it points out these mistakes,
however, there will always be peo
ple who feel that such criticism is
unjust, he said.
"These people will call the schools
either pink or black depending on
whether they are conservative in
their interpretation of American

ideals or whether they are liberal."
ACTUALLY, he said, this kind of
history does not teach that Ameri
can ideals are wrong, but it shows
how well we have followed our
ideals and suggests how to modify
our future conduct in the light of
our past mistakes.
He hit at critics of present-day
school curricula.
"UNDER OUR LAWS." he said,
"the nature of the school curriculum
is determined by the people.
"If the curriculum of an individual
school is pink, it is the fault of the
people for not participating more in
its construction.
"Every modern school system in
vites the community in to assist in
curriculum construction, but fre
quently the public is indifferent to
this invitation, preferring to kibitz
after the job is done."

ACTUALLY, he said, this kind of
history does not teach that Ameri
can ideals are wrong, but it shows
how well we have followed our
ideals and suggests how to modify
our future conduct in the light of
our past mistakes.
He hit at critics of present-day
school curricula.
"UNDER OUR LAWS." he said,
"the nature of the school curriculum
is determined by the people.
"If the curriculum of an individual
school is pink, it is the fault of the
people for not participating more in
its construction.
"Every modern school system in
vites the community in to assist in
curriculum construction, but fre
quently the public is indifferent to
this invitation, preferring to kibitz
after the job is done."


I)EAN A. JOHN BARTKY, of the
School of Education, who spoke to
an alumni group in Fresno Sat
urday on the topic "Is the Little
Red Schoolhouse Pink?"
A Stanford professor Satur
day warned against the "dan
gerous practice" of slapping the
"pink" label on a school be
cause it presents a viewpoint
with which the critic does not
agree.
Speaking before a Stanford alum
ni conference in Fresno, Dr. A. John
Bartky, clean of the Stanford School
of Education, pointed out the real
dangers of using the red tag indis
criminately.
HE SPOKE on the subject "Is
the Little Red Schoolhouse Pink?"'
It is our duty "to cry to the high
heavens if we feel that a school is
becoming subversive," he declared.
"But if we persist in calling every
thing pink, we will soon lull the
public into a complacency about the
whole mater. Crying pink too often
will bring the same result as crying
wolf too often."
THERE IS A PERIL, he said, that
much of what certain critics call
subversive is really the teaching of
American ideals.
He said that school.: should teach
two kinds of history.
"One is the romantic history which
emotionalizes and fixes our Ameri
can ideals. The other is a scientific
history which investigates how well
we have followed our American
ideals."
IN '1 HIS LATTER type of history,
he said, the school must point out
our mistakes in history which were
in conflict with the ideals.
When it points out these mistakes,
however, there will always be peo
ple who feel that such criticism is
unjust, he said.
"These people will call the schools
either pink or black depending on
whether they are conservative in
their interpretation of American

ideals or whether they are liberal."
