# Shinstrom, Brown Debate Women's Council Revisions
## 
### GAIL SHINSTRCM SALLY BROWN 
Revisions of Women's Council, brought up by a group of Union Unit
women, have been proposed to Women's Conference in the last few
weeks. In the reorganization section, consisting of coordination, orien
tation, and area representation, the latter has been the most debated,
and will be voted on numerically in the various living units tonight.
The other part of the revisions of more liberal regulations, drawn up
by Jo Ann Diamos and Ginny Davis, will be discussed.
Pros and cons of the area representation plan are given below by
Gail Shinstrom, Union president, and Sally Brown, YWCA president.

For some time a great deal of
confusion has existed regarding
Women's Council. Thre hasn't been
Women's Council. There hasn't been
between the women, the various
area committees, and Women's
Council.
This organization that once served
only 500 women definitely needs
revision 1o serve the present 2,000
women. There needs to be a new
kind of machinery which wi'l open
channels of communication and
provide a more efficient organiza
tion.
The proposed plan will achieve
these ends. Each area has different
problems best understood by the
girls in that group. A representa
tive from each area could present
these problems to Council more
easily because she would under
stand the situation.
There would be a greater ex
change of ideas between areas and
a greater understanding of the me
chanics of all area committees. In
this way Council would be able to
produce more integrated solutions
for the women as a whole simply
by understanding thoroughly all
the problems of each group.

In opposing area representation
on Women's Council we would like
to make the following points:
Women's Council' is a judicial,
not a legislative body, and its mem
bers should represent the interests
of the women students as a whole,
not the interests of one area. Area
representation would eliminate
many qualified women because
they live in the same area.
However, since Women's Council
interprets existing social regula
tions by making policies, each
woman in every area should have
an opportunity to bring her opin
ions and ideas about policies to
Council and should be able to con
tact conveniently someone who can
answer her questions concerning so
cial regulations ana policies.
We feel that area representation
would not most effectively facili
tate this co-ordination. Under area

representation, only five living
units out of 20 would have the con
venience of being in close contact
with a Council member.
Closer co-ordination could be
more effectively accomplished if
the Council representatives (Com
mittee of Five, for instance) in
each unit were given more respon
sibility. They could bring the opin
ions of these units to Council with
first-hand knowledge of the condi
tions in their particular house.
