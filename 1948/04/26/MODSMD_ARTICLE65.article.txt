### 
The story of what American citi
zenship has meant to a Stanford pro
fessor will be made available to the
reading public today.
For today is the publishing date
of "Personal Equation," written by
Dr. Albert L. Guerard, professor of
general literature emeritus^
'■PERSONAL EQUATION" is the
autobiography of a Frenchman
turned American. It tells of the in
fluences which have shaped his out
look on American democracy—a way
of life he adopted by choice and
which he has come to treasure
highly.
The book is replete with Stan
fordiana. In one chapter. Dr. Gue
rard relates how David Starr Jordan,
Stanford's first president, taught
him the healing virtue of American
humor.
IT WAS JORDAN, he says, ' who
taught me that America was the
land where hate dies away. He con
firmed my faith in the essential radi
calism of the American mind. . . .
This country is based, not on un
reasoning traditions, but on prin
ciples which are still dynamic to
day."
Later in the book, the author deals
with his return to Stanford after 12
years' absence and tells of his asso
ciation with Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
the new president of the University.
Dr. Guerard first came to Stanford
in 1925. This is his seventh book.
It is being published by W. W. Nor
ton and Company, New Cork.
