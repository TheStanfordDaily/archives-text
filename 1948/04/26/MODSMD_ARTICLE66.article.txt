Stanford students and alumni
have a close tie through the activi
ties of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation, an organization that acts for
the mutual benefit of the Univer
sity and the alumni.
Jack Shoup, alumni dirctor, ex
plained that "While we are Stan
-1 ford students for a few years, we
are alumni for the rest of our
lives."
"TOO MANY PEOPLE lose touch
with the richest and fullest four
years of their lives," Shoup added.
"The contacts we make at Stanford
are lasting, and they become even
more so through the activities of
I the Alumni Association."
The association is independent of
j the University administration in
I financial and policy matters; how
j ever, the aims are actually one with
| the University and for the good of
! Stanford.
Through conferences, the Alumni
I Review, and the Stanford Clubs,
I Stanford graduates are able to keep
! in touch with their school. The as
sociation also affords priority in get
j ting football game tickets.
, ALUMNI CONFERENCES are held
| each year at which alumni hear
j prominent members of the faculty
j speak to them on their chosen fields
I and are brought up to date on
| Stanford's current problems.
Four of these conferences have
i been held this year in Seattle. Port
land, La Jolla, and Los Angeles.
Each had record-breaking crowds.
On May 15 there will be a confer
! ence on the campus at which a new
attendance record is expected to be
set.
