# Russ Drop UN Trustee Council Ban

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April
25 (UP). â€” Russia dropped its
long boycott of the United Na
tions Trusteeship Council to
day.
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko notified UN Sec
retary General Trygve Lie that Se
men K. Tsarapkin, who represented
Russia at Dumbarton Oaks and San
Francisco, would be Russia's dele
gate to the trusteeship branch of
the UN.
Tsarapkin also is a delegate to the
present special session of the Gen
eral Assembly.
RELIABLE SOURCES said the
Russian decision to take part in UN
trusteeship discussions resulted from
the current Palestine negotiations.
With a representative on the Trus
-1 teeship Council, the Soviets will gain
a voice in the forthcoming debate
on the protection of Jerusalem. They
will also be able to take part in the
more important negotiations to come
if the UN decides to place Palestine
under trusteeship as has been pro
posed by the United States.
RUSSIA HAS BOYCOTTED the
Trusteeship Council ever since it
started work early last year. Soviet
spokesmen said the council was
formed illegally because trusteeship
agreements were in violation of the
UN charter.
Soviet participation in the work
of the Trusteeship Council will not
prevent the Western powers from
controlling Palestine if the Ameri
can trusteeship plan is approved.
The veto power does not extend to
the Trusteeship Council, even though
it is one of the UN's four major
organs.
