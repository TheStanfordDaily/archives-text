# KSU Refuses Political Time
## 
### 
KSU-ers are running out of air—
both radio time and breath—as they
turn away political aspirants who
want to use the campus station to
voice their viewpoints, says Steve
Phillips, station manager.
"All have been refused," declares
Phillips, "but all have been offered
equal time on the air."
KSU's manager points out that as
a mass campus medium, the sta
tion trumpets nobody's horn, and
besides, the radio industry has for
years followed a policy of non-edi
torialization.
