# Frosh Excom Considers Honor Code's Meaning
## 
### 
Attempting to correct the ambiguity and overlapping ol the
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard, Marjorie Gavin, fresh
man, presented to Frosh Excom last week a plan which would
combine the two codes into a single specified Honor Code.
The new code is divided into academic and non-academic

'phases. It is now open for freshman
discussion prior to a decisive vote by
Frosh Excom.
The revised system would give a
clear-cut definition of the Honoi
Code and state student responsibility
to it, individually and collectively.
THIS PLAN is designed to ac
complish two things.
1. To clarify the present meaning
and duties of the Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code in order tc
make student enforcement simpler.
2. To make a provision for en
forcement of the Fundamental Stan
dard similar to steps now taken in
Honor Code cases.
"The real value of the revision
comes through the discussion of it,"
said Miss Gavin. "Even if it is not
set down in a permanent form, it
will help to clarify the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code for tht
students and a part of its purpose
will have been accomplished.
WHEN YOU REALIZE that even
the freshmen, who have been thor
oughly and recently indoctrinated b\
their sponsors, are confused as to tht
exact provisions of these two tradi
tions, the vagueness which must
reign over the rest ol the campus be
comes lrighteningly obvious."
Information for this plan was gath
ered from ASSU Excom minutes.

THE FUNDAMENTAL STAN
DARD and Honor Code have been
rubbing elbows for many years, but
have never been synthesized satis
factorily, said Miss Gavin.
Before there was a student gov
ernment at Stanford, David Stan
Jordon laid down the Fundamental
Standard as the thing he would like
to see the students live up to. When
a student government was estab
lished, the law students suggested
the Honor Code.
In 1944 the Honor Code standing
committee was asked to give a def
inite interpretation of the Honor
Code. They could not distinguish
between phases of honorable con
duct and interpreted the Honor Code
to cover all phases of life at Stan
ford.
A wider split between the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
came when a 10-point Social Code
proved unsatisfactory. Since that
time both terms have been used.

The new code is divided into academic and non-academic

'phases. It is now open for freshman
discussion prior to a decisive vote by
Frosh Excom.
The revised system would give a
clear-cut definition of the Honoi
Code and state student responsibility
to it, individually and collectively.
THIS PLAN is designed to ac
complish two things.
1. To clarify the present meaning
and duties of the Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code in order tc
make student enforcement simpler.
2. To make a provision for en
forcement of the Fundamental Stan
dard similar to steps now taken in
Honor Code cases.
"The real value of the revision
comes through the discussion of it,"
said Miss Gavin. "Even if it is not
set down in a permanent form, it
will help to clarify the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code for tht
students and a part of its purpose
will have been accomplished.
WHEN YOU REALIZE that even
the freshmen, who have been thor
oughly and recently indoctrinated b\
their sponsors, are confused as to tht
exact provisions of these two tradi
tions, the vagueness which must
reign over the rest ol the campus be
comes lrighteningly obvious."
Information for this plan was gath
ered from ASSU Excom minutes.

THE FUNDAMENTAL STAN
DARD and Honor Code have been
rubbing elbows for many years, but
have never been synthesized satis
factorily, said Miss Gavin.
Before there was a student gov
ernment at Stanford, David Stan
Jordon laid down the Fundamental
Standard as the thing he would like
to see the students live up to. When
a student government was estab
lished, the law students suggested
the Honor Code.
In 1944 the Honor Code standing
committee was asked to give a def
inite interpretation of the Honor
Code. They could not distinguish
between phases of honorable con
duct and interpreted the Honor Code
to cover all phases of life at Stan
ford.
A wider split between the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
came when a 10-point Social Code
proved unsatisfactory. Since that
time both terms have been used.
Attempting to correct the ambiguity and overlapping ol the
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard, Marjorie Gavin, fresh
man, presented to Frosh Excom last week a plan which would
combine the two codes into a single specified Honor Code.
