BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 2(5 (UP).
King Abdullah of Transjordan is
determined to fight the Jews in Pal
estine. If he is victorious, he in
tends to demand a plebiscite on the
question of joining Palestine to his
country, advices from Amman said
today.
These advices are from respon
sible sources in Amman, which is
Abdullah's capital. They said that
May IG. the day after the end of
the British mandate in Palestine, is
his probable D-Day.
Informants believe that Abdul
lah's Arab Legion will be reinforced
by regular units from Iraq who are
.already in Transjordan. It is under
stood that more than 5,000 Iraqis,
well equipped, already have put
themselves under Abdullah's com
mand.
It is reported without confirma
tion that Abdullah has just received
about i>o tanks from the British in
fulfillment of conditions in the An
glo -Trans j or da nt rea ty.
Arab leaders point out that King
Abdullah is not bound by the char
ter of the United Nations, because
Russia has vetoed his government's
application for membership.

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 2<>
(UP). â€” The Arabs of Palestine
served notice on the United Nations
today that they would set up an in
dependent Arab state in Palestine
May 15 unless the UN guaranteed
them control of the Holy Land at a
fixed future date.
Faced with a similar threat by j
the Jews of Palestine and the pros- I
pect of all-out civil war in the Holy ,
Land 19 days from now, the UN ;
General Assembly ordered the
Trusteeship Council to draft emer
gency steps to protect the city of
Jerusalem and its shrines.
THE MOVE could conceivably |
lead to use of American Marines j
now with the Mediterranean fleet. '
as party of police force for Jeru
salem.
Jamal El Husseini of the Arab
Higher Committee added dangerous I
new complications to the seething
Palestine problem by warning that
the Arabs would proclaim a Pales
tine state on May 15 when the Brit
ish mandate expires.
IFE TOLD the 58 members of the
General Assembly political commit
tee that the Arabs of Palestine would 1
not even consider the American
trusteeship formula unless it was
intended to give Palestine to the J
Arabs after a "short and fixed pe- j
riod."
Husseini said the League of Na
tions mandate specifically provided
that it should be succeeded by an
independent Palestinian govern
ment.
"Now that the mandatory (Brit
ain) has failed to fulfill this duty,
the overwhelming majority of the
people of the country have decided
to carry it out themselves in expres
sion of their inalienable right of
self-determination." he said.
