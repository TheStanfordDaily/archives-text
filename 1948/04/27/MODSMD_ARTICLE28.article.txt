### 
BERKELEY. April 26 (UP). —A
monster atom-smasher 20 times as
powerful as any other in existence
will be constructed at the Univer
sity of California, the Atomic Energy
Commission announced tonight.
The mighty new super-cyclotron
will probe into the secrets of matter
by hurling atomic bullets at ter
rific energies ranging up to 10 billion
electron volts.
The present world's largest cyclo
tron, now in operation here, gen
erates only 350.000 electron volts.
Chairman David E. Lilienthal of
the Atomic Energy Commission said
the projected new $9,000,000 atomic
gun "serves notice to the world that
it is the intention of the people of
the United States to widen their
lead in the development and appli
cation of fundamental science of all
kinds."
