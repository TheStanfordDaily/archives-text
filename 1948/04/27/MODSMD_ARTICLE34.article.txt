# CAMPUS OPINION
## Letters, Letters

To the Editor:
It is really none of your damn business how any candidate runs his
campaign.
Referring to your editorial of April 23, you have a lot of nerve saying
that the students who cast their ballot for Wolff weren't voting "intelli
gently." What proof do you have to back this statement up. How do you
know that any candidate won't be just as good an officer as his running
mates?
You seem rather stupid in your psychology. Your editorial has given
one man better publicity than he had during his campaign and has stirred
more of controversy than was ever dreamed of.
If you really want to get out the votes, just continue to write similar
editorials the first three days of this week!
