To the Editor:
The April 23 editorial in The Daily is a rather amazing phenomenon.
Not amazing in that the expressed opinions are what they are, but rather
that such obvious bias should be so freely admitted, that it could actually
emanate in printed editorial form, even from such an intellectual swamp
as the Daily shack.
Even after overlooking the dubious sportsmanship involved, one cannot
but wonder what the background and experience of the editor are, which
apparently qualify him for the role of political arbiter. To assume, without
proof, that he has this background, would be, by his own argument, "un
intelligent."
For some time now, it has been the practice of The Daily to whip up
the moulting internationalists and intellectual grandmothers on campus
into a white heat ever every real or imagined issue that can be found.
These people, in turn, ffay the student body in general for their "apathy."
Apparently no question is too mean, no issue too piddling, to set off this
chain reaction. And as most of the students are NOT, in my opinion, apa
thetic to genuine political issues or world affairs, they become annoyed
at being so constantly maligned. In the past, they have expressed this
annoyance, often, by not voting in campus elections.
In the impending election, one of the questions to be answered is: Which
of the candidates shall wield the micro-infinitesimal amount of power that
goes with the ASSU presidential office? One of the candidates has at least
indicated that he has a sense of humor. The other candidates have not, as
yet, even done this. Rather, they have been content to mouth certain
stereotyped "platforms," most of which are far beyond the authority of
the presidential office to meet.
A "Pappy O'Daniel" campaign on a college campus does, I grant, seem
rather unkind, especially in view of the fact that none of the hack politi
cians 011 campus thought of it first. And yet, I predict that voting,will be
heavier this time.
Your editorial stated that Bob Hope or Gypsy Rose Lee could win an
election here. I agree. Unfortunately, neither of them is running.
