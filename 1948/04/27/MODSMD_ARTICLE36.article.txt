To the Editor:
1 would like to express my strong objection to the editorial in Friday's
Daily.
(1) It seems to me to be a course of doubtful validity for The Daily
to implicitly take sides in a student body election. Though there probably
is no by-law to prohibit it, I believe that a majority of th« student body
would agree with me when I say that The Daily should be operated not as
the private property of the editorial board but as a trust for the entire
student body.
(2) The piece implies (a) that student government is a matter of vital
concern, only to be mentioned in reverent whispers, and (b) that student
government, such as it is, requires another George Washington or Abraham
Lincoln for student body president.
Both of these assumptions are erroneous. The importance of student
government certainly cannot stem from the vast powers which it possesses.
Whether Hustle House or Alpha Cholera is chosen to have a dance Satur
day is a matter of undoubted interest, but hardly of commanding impor
tance.
Isn't student government important because it is practice in democ
racy? No. Those who make this claim confuse their means with ends. Men
do not institute government in order that they run it democratically; rather
(hey see that since the subjects for legislation demand that broad powers
lx invesed in the national and state governments, democracy is the best
means for controlling these powers. When, as in the case of Stanford
student government, the subject matter on which the government operates
is so microscopic as to lx? of little or no importance to anyone, democracy
as a means or as a form loses its meaning.
Likewise, the oflice of student body president need not be approached
with quite the humble respect which The Daily implies. From my obser
vations, the prime requisite of the ASSU president is a genial manner and
a habit of saying "hello" on Quad. I would like to vote for a man who has
not forgotten how to laugh at himself rather than one who is completely
overawed by his own mouthing of meaningless phrases and impossible
promises which pass under the name of campaign oratory.
I suggest that the editor relax, or soon he will be eligible for Students
Concerned. What our political campaign needs is fewer platforms and
more free beer.
