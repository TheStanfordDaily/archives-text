## Speedway Cocktail 
### 
CHICAGO (UP). â€”Joe Lencki, who has dabbled in
automobiles and motors since 1922, thinks the time
is ripe now to bring out one of two new fluids he
has developed to make a car run better.
Lencki is preparing for the present to market what
he calls the "speedway cocktail."
Two or three years from now it's going to l>e the
"Lencki cocktail."
The speedway cocktail is a fluid which can be
put in a motor to provide lubrication for moving parts
when the motor is started. But the Lencki cocktail
is to replace gasoline and give 100 miles to the
gallon to boot.
"The hole i> beginning to run dry." Lcncki said.
"That's why the automotive industry is interested
in the fuel.
"But they're interested in the speedway cocktail,
too. And that columnist who said I had sold the fuel
to some Detroit manufacturers was wrong. I haven't
sold anything yet, but they're talking about buying
the speedway cocktail." .
Lencki said the automotive manufacturers could
use his lubricating fluid in the present motors, but
to use the gasoline substitute they would have to
use his own motor design.
"They could use my design with only minor
changes in the machines and molds they have now,''
he said. "The only thing radical about it would be
that they could build engines with, oh, a 35 per cent
cut in costs."
Lencki designed his first automobile motor in 1922
and designed and built his first motor in 1928. He
says his new fuel can be manufactured at a lower
cost than gasoline.
"I believe it can be produced cheaper and sold
cheaper," he said.
