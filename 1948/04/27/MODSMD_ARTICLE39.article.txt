# Students Beat Market

CLEVELAND (UP). â€”Investment experts of the
Cleveland Stock Exchange are taking a surprised
interest in the 11.53 per cent profit showing of 50
college students who have been playing the stock
market during the past year.
The students are enrolled at Baldwin-Wallace
College at nearby Berea. They play the market as
part of an economics course organized by Prof. Jacob
O. Kamm. He thinks it is the best way to teach the
complexities of stock market procedure.
Organized as "The B-W Commerce Fund Corp.,"
the students started out with a $300 fund donated
l>y Prof. Kamm. Richard Gottron. president of the
Cleveland Stock Exchange, members of the firm of
Ciuttroii Russcl &. Co., and graduates of the Bald
win-Wallace economics department.
The fledgling stock buyers already have increased
their original investment by earnings of $44.81.
"If the amount originally invested had been $100,-
000, we would have realized a profit of $11,500," Dr.
Kamm said. "If the annual gain were consistent over
a 50-year period, we'd have an impressive fortune
on our hands."
Richard Marous, 2(>, secretary of the student
corporation, said he was not optimistic about the
market at present.
"I follow the Dow theory," Marous said. "You
know, tides, waves, and ripples. Right now the
tide is down. It's all psychological."
Baldwin-Wallace is the second college in the
country to use the practical method of teaching mar
ket transactions. The first group was organized at
Smith College several years ago.
Cleveland Stock Exchange officials said they might
attend a few of Prof. Kamm's classes if the student
group continues to reap profits.
