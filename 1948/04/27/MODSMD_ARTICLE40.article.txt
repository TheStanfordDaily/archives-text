# New Wall of Air Secrecy
## 
### 
WIESBADEN, Germany (UP).—The U.S. Air
Force in Europe has pulled its operations back behind
a solid wall of secrecy.
The "silent treatment" was first noticed by re
porters when three squadrons of B-29 Superfortress
bombers arrived from the United States for "routine
training."
Ll. (Jen. Curtis LeMay, Air Force commander
here, now refuses to speak for quotation unless he
is allowed to censor his remarks in writing before
correspondents file their dispatches.

The 270 Air Force officers and enlisted men who
brought the 27 B-29's to Furstenfeldbruck Air Base
near Munich have been thoroughly gagged. They
refer all questions to European air headquarters here.
LcMay himself refused to discuss the mock
battle the B-2!)'s staged with Royal Air Force
Spitfires over England earlier last week despite a
statement by a British Air Ministry spokesman that
the Spits "kicked the stuffing" out of the American
bombers.
Nevertheless, these facts about the American air
arm in Europe have been admitted by Air Force offi
cers:
1. American fighter planes in Germany are out
numbered by Russian planes approximately 53 to
one. Best-informed estimates of Russian strength
put the figures at about 4.000 fighters. The Ameri
cans have admittedly "well below 100."
2. The U.S. Air Force has no permanent com
plement of heavy bombers in Germany and does
not plan to establish any. The visiting Superforts
comprise the United States' only bomber strength
here.
3. Radar and anti-aircraft defense at American
bases in Germany are conceded to be close to abso
lute zero.
4. The dccimated air command is weakened by
the fact that approximately one-third of its per
sonnel is engaged directly or indircctly in provid
ing services for the Air Force's 2.H00 dependents—
wives and children —in Germany.
This latter burden will be eased soon, however,
when 1,500 dependents will be flown back to the
United States at government expense. They expressed
a desire to get out of Germany immediately when
asked by Air Force headquarters earlier this month.
