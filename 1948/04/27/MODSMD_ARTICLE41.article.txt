Yipes! The money we don't have at this Univer
sity would make a theorist rich. This time the issue
under discussion is parking lots. One of the most
crowded parking areas on campus is the one tucked
in behind the main library adjacent to the temporary
buildings. On the other side of the buildings is a large
plowed area; paving this area would ease the parking
situation.
Two years ago Stanford designed emergency park
ing areas to handle the influx of students with cars.
This year the Farm has more cars than last year;

winter quarter had more cars
than autumn quarter.
This emergency parking lot
program two years ago was de
signed to follow general postwar
construction projects. The soil
around the temporary buildings is
adobe and would have to be
paved because oil and rock would
not last. Weil, you can still park
around the lake.
Valparaiso Street, between
Mayfield and Salvatierra, has
been converted from a dirt lane

to one covered with a hard, but temporary, surface
of oil and gravel. Total cost was under $500.
Palm Drive received the same treatment earlier
this week. Purpose of the project is to seal the road
and to prevent chuck holes from forming that would
require heavy repair expenses.
A new service group, Alpha Phi Omega fraternity,
is forming on campus for college men who are or have
been affiliated with the Scouts. Any college commu
nity requires pertain minor jobs to be done without
compensation. Here at Stanford the group already
has considered three service projects for the fra
ternity.
Ushering at Stanford Players productions, assist
ing the University in its voluntary power conserva
tion program, and monitoring campus bulletin boards
to keep them in order and up to date probably will
be the organization's first duties.
Alpha Phi Omega chapters do not maintain fra
ternity houses, but they clo use rooms provided by
schools for general meetings. The chapter seeks co
operation with other campus organizations to broaden
the scope of service to students, faculty, University,
and community.
Their only reward will be kind thank-you's; but
these men will gain self-satisfaction among them
selves for their unselfish interest in bettering our
local environment.
