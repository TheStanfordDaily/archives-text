## Bull Session 
### 
The other day I saw a notice on page four that
the Stanford Players were holding auditions for one
of (heir forthcoming productions. 1 had half a mind
to go over and try out, but I imagine it would be
rather difficult for them to find a part for someone
with half a mind.
With all my theatrical experience I should bo a
natural for one of these shows. I got most of my
training by playing the leading parts in stock shows
. . . livestock shows. My director said 1 was superb
in Pig-malion.
I'm the kind of actor who would do anything for
realism. For one role I even dyed my hair blond. I
was playing the part of a palomino in "Three Men on
a Horse."
But there will always be a soft spot in my heart
for animal roles. It was an animal role that started
me back on the road to success after an extremely
low point in my career. I was cast as a cocker spaniel
in "Bulldog Drummond Gets Rabies." The part gave
me a new leash on life.
Even Shakespeare is included in my repertoire.

Most theatrical companies pattern their Shakespear
ean performances after the type done by Maurice
Evans. Our company used to do what was called a
"generous production." When we did "Hamlet." there
was enough ham left over for "seconds" for everyone.
Horse operas have always been my favorite kind
of movies. I once had a role where the only tiling I
did was put a piece of metal in the horses mouth.
It was just a bit part.
Ram's Head has made me several offers recently.
They want me to go on tour with one of their
shows. At least., I think they do. The last time I
was over there, the director told me to "Hit the
road."
But my theatrical education won't be complete
until I see another one of those new English movies.
The only time I ever saw one, I couldn't understand
anything the leading man was saying. All I could
hear was a series of mumbles, punctuated by "Pip.
pip!" By the time I figured out what the guy was
talking about, I was too pooped to give a pip.
