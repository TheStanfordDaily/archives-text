"Peter Grimes," by the young Brit
ish composer, Benjamin Britten, is
considered an extremely difficult
opera to produce because of its
musical complexities. Its dissonances
and contrapuntal passages involving
soloist, chorus, and orchestra pose
tremendous problems, especially for
non-professional performers.
THIS WAS the only new opera
presented by New York's Metro
politan Opera House this year. Crit
ics generally agreed that the opera
was a success, but in spite of the
Met's staging. They claimed that the
Met was too accustomed to the clas
sical tradition to adjust to the mod
ern drama techniques that are used
in addition to the modern musical
techniques.
The plot of the opera centers
around a Suffolk fishing town. Peter,
an ambitious and poetic fisherman,
is driven to his death by the vicious
moral judgment of his gossipy com
munity. This plot makes the opera
a grim drama against the back
ground of salty rhythms.
