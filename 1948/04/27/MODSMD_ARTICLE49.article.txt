# Camera Club Sets Policies
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Stanford
Camera Club last week, members set
a policy of minimizing business
meetings and stressing darkroom
activities. An attempt will also be
made to combine recreation and
photographic efforts in such activ
ities as beach parties and picnics.
Jim Joseph, president of the club,
resigned from his post. His office is
now filled by Harold Freeman.
The club has a complete dark
room in the Village, containing a
contact printer, a good enlarger,
and developing supplies. At pres
ent, these facilities are not receiv
ing their maximum use, and a
number of new members can be
accommodated, Freeman said.
Dues are $1 per year plus a $1
per quarter darkroom fee. Anyone
interested in taking advantage of
the equipment and in joining the
Camera Club should sec Freeman
in room 216, Building 117, Vilage,
or C. E. Cunningham, assistant Vil
lage director.
