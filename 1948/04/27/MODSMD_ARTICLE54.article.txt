J last article of a scries on polo.)
Polo got ils name from India 'way
j back in 1X(»0.
J A British officer, witnessing a
I match in that country, asked a
I tribesman the name of the game.
There was a language barrier, and
I the officer's linger seemed to point
j to the ball being used. The native
! answered, "Pulu," the word for wil
low root in Indian.
I . .THE GAME h as remained popu-
I lar not only because it requires skill,
stamina, and strategy, but also be-
I cause it combines the color and
j beauty of a horse show with con
j stan t action.
Every one of the four men who
i compose a polo team is given a posi
, tion to p!;iy. On an attack the team
theoretically lines up one behind the
other with the number one forward
j first and the number four back last.
The bi:il is passed on a straight
j line frc m the back to the front to
set up a shot for the One. If any
: man misses a pass, the player be
| hind him is ready to pick it up. If
I the defense intercepts a pass, all
players pair off with their opponents
to break the attack.
THE OBJECT is to create a situa
; lion that results in a score, and ev
j ery player must be alert to the shift
- ing strategy.
The One position, or first forward,
| is filled by a man who has an accu-
I rate and powerful shot. It is his duty
to lead the attack and make the
goals whenever the ball is set up for
! him. This is a scoring position, and
i the man should gamble to get him
i self in that position.
STANFORD'S ONE, Bill Decker.
| plays an aggressive game with his
eyes open for scoring opportunities.
A clever horseman, Decker blights
his opponents with his steady drives
| and powerful strokes.
Experienced on the fine Arizona
j team, one of the best college teams
in the country. Decker coaches the
I Stanford Polo Association members.
The man filling the Two position,
or second forward, on a polo team is
i the most aggressive and active play
er on the field. He must force the

attack and be in every play.
EVEN ON THE DEFENSE he
forges ahead and hurries his oppo
nent. Always watching for passes
from his teammates behind him, the
Two sets up shots for the One.
Todd Helser, known at Stanford
for his "circus" shots, is the var
sity Two. Helser practiced last sum
mer under the critical eye of Will
Tevis. Mr. Polo of San Francisco

1 sports circles. Playing his seen
year here, Helser first learned p<
in Oregon.
The first thought of the Three,
halfback, is to cover or block 1
! opposing Two. He must play mc
defensive than offensive ball and .
the Four in his goal defense. Whi
i ever possible he must ride his ■
vaneing opponent out of the plaj
HILL FOSTER, Stanford's c;
tain, once on the crack New Mex
Military Institute team, holds Ho
the Three. Foster played on
pre-war Stanford polo team ;
continues to delight .spectators w
his horsemanship and brilliant h
The Four, or Back, is responsi
for the defense. This man must h;
a strong backhand shot to keep
ball away from his goal and out
reach of his opponents. He m
keep the opposing One from gett
I behind him and taking a run at
; goal. He aids the attack, but is
ways careful to remain safely
position to make a sturdy defense
The president of the Stanford P
Association, Bob Lawson, fills
Four. Lawson learned his polo
NMMI as did Foster. He is play
his second year of polo at Stanfc
The association, formed last spri
plans to have regularly schedu
matches every weekend. Recen
a series of matches was held \v
the Palo A'to Ranchers.
