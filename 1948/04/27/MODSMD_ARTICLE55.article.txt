Tlie 1948 Stanford-USC track and field meet is over now, but don't
that 71 to GO score fool you for a minute. Our boys were in that meet
the way, and one break anywhere along the line could have put the
a! outcome up to the mile relay.
The Stanford track team covered itself with glory. A few capable
»erves to take care of the seconds and thirds, and the Care's would have
lied the upset of the track season. USC is rated as the best team in the
-intry, bar none. That makes our boys look pretty good.
AT THIS POINT we could relate the series of miscues on the part of
■ officials that lost points for the Indians, but all that has been hashed
er elsewhere. It is sufficient to note that high school kids handled the
irking of the javelin tosses, and that Gordon Levy should have been
'en at least a tie for second in the 100-yard dash. The discrepancies
re many but that has come to be expected in the Southland.
To us the amazing part of the whole affair is the. spirit that Jack Weiers
user and his lads showed against a very tough foe.
The best race of the day was that run by Stanford's Larry Hofi. He
1 Troy's Wells DeLoach for about 350 yards in the 440. At that point
Loach caught up and the two ran side by side for the next 80 yards. Hoff
lied ahead to win by one yard in the best race this reporter has seen in
long time.
c ard high jumpers and pole vaulters found a surprise awaiting
•m when they entered the Coliseum. The high jump pit and pole vault
were raised about four feet above the ground. Sandbags held the
vdust in a bin-like affair so that when the jumpers landed they would
d about four feet higher than if the bins were not there.
This arrangement helped in that the drop wasn't as great, but the
npers, if they found themselves off stride, had no choice but to jump
crash into the sandbags. One athlete described it by saying, "It seemed
if we were running into a wall."
HOI,AND SINK put on his usual crowd-pleasing act. He stayed behind
inford's A 1 Lyons for the first seven laps in the two-mile grind. At the
rt of the home stretch he poured on the coal and ran the last 440 in (50
onds flat. All that after winning the mile. We wonder what would have
jpened if Frank Ganahl hadn't been killed in an auto accident last
nmer. His best mile time was considerably under Sink's 4:29.9.
Gay Bryan was the best all-around athlete on the field. All three of his
uul jump attempts were better than the best effort of the second-place
>jan.
Otis Chandler was well received in his homeland and proceeded to put
.-hot lor his all-time high on the first qualifying toss (s'.] feet 4 inches).
MAN\ FA KM FANS may be ignorant of the fact, but there are two
Kees on the Card squad and both boys handle themselves very well,
vvning won the high hurdles and placed third in the lows. Steve hit his
-time mark in the discus to win the event. What with Bryan's feats, one
ow sitting behind us remarked, "Heck, these Stanford guys could win
st meets with those two guys Bryan and McKee alone."
Don t be surprised if California comes closer to the Trojans than did
nford. The Bears have strength where Stanford doesn't. Vefiing will
e Sink a good time in the mile and two-mile, if he runs both of them,
n Anderson should place second in the dashes.
No sooner did the trackmen complete their own meet than they bought
papers and started doping out the probable results of the Stanford-
LA meet. It looks to be very close with the mile relay deciding the
et score.
Of course, the day's activities ended with the boys taking in the show
the Sixth and Main Streets' Burbank Theater.

Spring footbail has reached the mid-point with yesterday's practice, and
will soon start a run-over of the roster and mention possible candidates
varsity berths on next year's squad. The plan is to take position by
ition and give the - qualifications as they stack up at this time.
