## Seals Still Lead PCL 
### BY CRAYTON JONES 
After four weeks of activity in the
Coast League, it's apparent that the
j Seals are just another ball club.
The so-called experts bubbled with
enthusiasm while watching the Seals
during spring training and promptly
predicted that the O'Doulmen would
leave the rest of the field far behind.
| It seems that this enthusiasm was
i hardly justified.
San Francisco managed to main
tain their league lead last week by
taking 5 out of 7 from hapless Sac
! ramento, but the Oaks and Angels
| are close behindâ€”only l'a games
: out.
RIGHT NG'W it looks like a close
I race all the way with the Seals,
| Oaks, Angels, and Beavers looking
; the strongest. No doubt many of
the clubs will pick up additional
help when the major league teams
are forced to cut their rosters in
order to meet the player limit.
The Oaks started to roll last week
! as their pitching staff really came
through. Earl Jones, Floyd Speer.
i Damon Hayes, Will Hafey, and Ralph
i Buxton all turned in well-pitched
j games with the Acorns win
| ning 5 out of 6 from Portland. The
batters cooperated by shelling Bea
i ver pitching for a weekly total of 30
! runs and 62 hits.
CON DEMPSEY, former USF
| hurler, was the big hero for the Seals
I last week. Big Con saved two games
' as he rescued Cliff Melton on Satur
i day to preserve a 6-2 lead, and he
pitched the last two innings of the
! nightcap on Sunday to give Al Lien
j a 4-3 win. In 10 innings of relief
I pitching Dempsey has yet to allow an
earned run. Big Joe Brovia pulled
out of his slump by hitting .625 for
the week, which included two home
runs.
Jack Graham, current home run
king, raised his four-bagger total to
14 while his teammates were drop
ping their series to Los Angeles by
the odd game. The Angels are now
I tied with the Oaks for second place.
