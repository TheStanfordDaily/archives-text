The big blackboard down at the
Cardinal crew's boathouse reads
"three more workouts until UCLA"
now, as the three boatloads of oars
men round 'the final turn of their
pre-season conditioning progra m.
With seven long months of prepara
tion behind them, the l'rosh, jayvee,
and varsity will pit their know-how
and power against that of the
Bruins on Bellona Creek in Los An

are Johnny Dee and Bob Setrakian.
The 24 men (including the fresh
men), their substitutes, and coaches
will leave for UCLA on Thursday
; noon. Plans call for accommodations
on campus at Westwood and loosen
ing up workouts with UCLA shells
!on Fridays and Saturday morning.
