# Stanfordites Take Part In Regional NSA Meet
## 
### 
Student government at Stanford is not "infinitesimal" or "farci
cal," Farm delegates learned at the National Students Association
regional meeting at UCLA last weekend.
Delegates from other schools said that Stanford student gov
ernment is outstanding in its scope and freedom. They expressed

surprise at the record vote of 47 *
per cent in- the primary elections— ;
a figure much higher than elec
tion turnouts at their schools.
Stanford's role in the California-
Nevada-Hawaii convention was pri
marily in the international field.
Erskine Childers, vice-president of
the lIR, was elected chairman of
the regional international sub-com- j
mission, which is located at Stan
ford.
STANFORD'S FOREIGN scholar
ship plan, voted on last week, was |
enthusiastically endorsed and
adopted by the other schools in the
region. Stanford's NSA will send
out information on the plan.
The assembly also approved Stan
ford's Student Mission, a new plan,
under which students going to Eu
rope this summer will report back
their interpretation of continental
affairs.
DEAN LAWRENCE KIMPTON
was unanimously chosen on the first
ballot to serve two years as re- j
gional faculty adviser for NSA. Paul
Smith of the San Francisco Chron- j
icle was also elected as a two-year
officer.
Following reports from Domestic
and International Commissions and
from individual schools, the plenary J
session resolved into six panels, j
Representatives from Stanford took
part in discussing discrimination,;
student publications, foreign study j
and travel, social, cultural and [
physical welfare, student govern- [
ment, and NSA's part in the coming
UNESCO conference at San Fran- |
cisco.
"IF CAMPUS BRANCHES of NSA
succeed in overcoming student j
apathy, I have no doubt that they j
will find the leadership and the pro- j
gram to face real problems and to j
find democratic solutions to them." !
Dr. Dean McHenry of UCLA said in I
the keynote address. '"Remember j
that communism thrives on our un
solved problems," he concluded.

anna Olmstead, Erskine Childers. j

Student government at Stanford is not "infinitesimal" or "farci
cal," Farm delegates learned at the National Students Association
regional meeting at UCLA last weekend.
Delegates from other schools said that Stanford student gov
ernment is outstanding in its scope and freedom. They expressed

surprise at the record vote of 47 *
per cent in- the primary elections— ;
a figure much higher than elec
tion turnouts at their schools.
Stanford's role in the California-
Nevada-Hawaii convention was pri
marily in the international field.
Erskine Childers, vice-president of
the lIR, was elected chairman of
the regional international sub-com- j
mission, which is located at Stan
ford.
STANFORD'S FOREIGN scholar
ship plan, voted on last week, was |
enthusiastically endorsed and
adopted by the other schools in the
region. Stanford's NSA will send
out information on the plan.
The assembly also approved Stan
ford's Student Mission, a new plan,
under which students going to Eu
rope this summer will report back
their interpretation of continental
affairs.
DEAN LAWRENCE KIMPTON
was unanimously chosen on the first
ballot to serve two years as re- j
gional faculty adviser for NSA. Paul
Smith of the San Francisco Chron- j
icle was also elected as a two-year
officer.
Following reports from Domestic
and International Commissions and
from individual schools, the plenary J
session resolved into six panels, j
Representatives from Stanford took
part in discussing discrimination,;
student publications, foreign study j
and travel, social, cultural and [
physical welfare, student govern- [
ment, and NSA's part in the coming
UNESCO conference at San Fran- |
cisco.
"IF CAMPUS BRANCHES of NSA
succeed in overcoming student j
apathy, I have no doubt that they j
will find the leadership and the pro- j
gram to face real problems and to j
find democratic solutions to them." !
