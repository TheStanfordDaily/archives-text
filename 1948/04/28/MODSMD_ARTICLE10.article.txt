To the Editor:
Much of the criticism leveled at The Daily editorial of last Friday has
overlooked the point that the editorial was not directed at a candidate
personally but rather at the campaign methods which were employed in
the primary by a group ol his partisans. Considerations ol the political
wisdom in printing the editorial at that time are irrelevant to the issue
of whether the editorial was justified in its criticism.
At certain times, even a non-partisan newspaper must protest against
unspeakably low and degrading methods of electioneering which threaten
to draw the whole student body down into a mire of political sneak
thievery and duplicity. The offenses perpetrated against the Election
Code in this campaign are beyond number; and it is time that the vio
lators of our laws be brought to bar; or the existence of these rules
in our Constitution will become a solemn farce.
It is undoubtedly true that it has become fashionable to politely sneer
at the traditions of our University and to poke fun at "this nice old mossy
institution." But when this sort of thing threatens to destroy all respect
for rules set up for social control, then it is time to take stock of the
situation. Either our Election Code must be enforced or there is cer
tainly no point to maintaining it in the Constitution.
