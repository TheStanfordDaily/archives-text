To the Editor:
A "Committee Representing Village Houses" has issued a mimeographed
report and posted same on Village bulletin boards containing advice as
to how it feels Villagers should vote in the coming school elections. It has
chosen two presidential candidates as best, suggesting that Villagers
vote for one of the two.
if this type of advice comes from a non-official body, it cannot be
criticized as any group is entitled to campaign for whomever it chooses.
If the group had been an official one acting within the scope of its au
thority. there could again be no criticism.
But this particular committee was made up of a miscellaneous group
of house presidents and minor house wheels meeting atter the Village
Council had adjourned thereby giving the false impression that the advice
was official. If this had been an action by the Village Council, and the
mimeographed report does not clarify this point, it would have been
improper since there is no such authority in its constitution for this type
of activity—its members ate elected as representatives of the houses,
not as advisors.
If the Council feels that the Villagers are not interested and intelligent
enough to choose a candidate for themselves, let them stimulate interest
in a non-partisan way. We feel that an unofficial partisan group has
no right to masquerade as a non-partisan official body.
