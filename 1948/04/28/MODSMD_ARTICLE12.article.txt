To the Editor:
The flood of letters condemning Friday's Daily editorial seems to be
in line with the rest of the campaign conducted by some "humorists."
Many are aware that the campaign started as a satire on politics, and
now continues because these humorists think student government is a
farce, and the student body president a figurehead. Reference to the
past refutes this completely. The Administration did not hand us the
Honor Code on a silver platter. It is true that the office is only as
strong as the man in it. but is this an argument for any candidate who
considers it a joke?
There are strong and serious candidates running who are too busy to
push blatant circus campaigns, but who could regain the authority and
prestige the ASSU constitution allots to the presidency. Those who are
uninterested in student government, or who think it is a joke should
not destroy it for those who know better.
