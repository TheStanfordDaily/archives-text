To the Editor:
Your editorial of April 23 seemed to me to be somewhat biased. You
even go so far as to call the campaign of one of the candidates a
"circus" and a "vaudeville show." That the campaign in question has been
waged on a popular level cannot be denied. But this method seems
to be logical in a campaign singularly lacking in important issues, if
one candidates can show originality and humor in addition to the
qualities possessed by all the candidates, this, to my mind, is a deciding
factor in favor of that candidate.
