## King of Beasts Is Cheap 
### 
WASHINGTON. D. C.—Like the housewife watch
ing the cow disappear over the cost-of-living moon,
zoo and circus directors are bewailing the price of
the even rarer beasts needed to restore their war
depleted collections.
Australia's unique duck-hilled, web-fuoted, egg
laying platypus was recently marked at $1,600.
This fabulous mammal which evolution forgot is a
very special creature, however. The three speci
mens obtained b\ the New York Zoo in 11(47 are
believed the only ones outside the home continent.
The official platypus price, moreover, is much lower
than quotations on many other animals. A South
African baby elephant, for instance, has been of
fered at $4,U00. Even before World War II scat
tered collections, cut off supply sources and ship
ping facilities an orangutan sold for $.'i.0()0, and a
pair of giraffes for $7,000.
To a layman, notes the National Geographic
Society, the business of wild animal collection and
dealing is an Alice-in-Wonderland affair. And
not the least of its oddities is the cost variation.
The lion, king of the beasts, is comparatively low
priced. for example. So is the spectacular but com
mon zebra.
The python is not expensive—-up to a point. This
snake is sold by the foot, at between five and 10
dollars for each of the first six feet, but the rate
skyrockets when an unusually long reptile unwinds.
First place for the most valuable animal of its
kind in any of the world's zoos went in 1947 to a
six-foot-two, 520-pound gorilla in Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo. Its value was estimated at $100,000.
As with other commodities, the price range for
wild animals is a matter of demand and availabil
ity. A little showmanship is involved, too. Out
landish or performing beasts are treasured for
the enthusiastic crowds they draw.
The ordinai*y lion is cheap—changing hands some
times for as little as $100 —because it breeds well
in captivity. On the other hand, the strange okapi,
between a giraffe and a zebra, may sell for $15,000.
More than $12,000 was once paid for a pair of
Indian rhinos in remote Nepal.
Wild animal collectors and professional dealers
travel many thousands of miles for captives, re
turning with virtual Noah's Ark variety. An ex
pedition led by the director of the Washington
Zoo and sponsored by the National Geographic
Society and Smithsonian Institution once brought
back alive nearly 800 animals, birds, and reptiles.
Included in the haul were as many fascinating
stories. At one time, an excited native rushed into
the expedition's Sumatra base bearing a "rare" find.
It turned out to be an escaped American opossum,
one of the good-will gifts brought along by the party
to exchange for Far Eastern prizes.

one of the good-will gifts brought along by the party
to exchange for Far Eastern prizes.
WASHINGTON. D. C.—Like the housewife watch
ing the cow disappear over the cost-of-living moon,
zoo and circus directors are bewailing the price of
the even rarer beasts needed to restore their war
depleted collections.
Australia's unique duck-hilled, web-fuoted, egg
laying platypus was recently marked at $1,600.
This fabulous mammal which evolution forgot is a
very special creature, however. The three speci
mens obtained b\ the New York Zoo in 11(47 are
believed the only ones outside the home continent.
The official platypus price, moreover, is much lower
than quotations on many other animals. A South
African baby elephant, for instance, has been of
fered at $4,U00. Even before World War II scat
tered collections, cut off supply sources and ship
ping facilities an orangutan sold for $.'i.0()0, and a
pair of giraffes for $7,000.
To a layman, notes the National Geographic
Society, the business of wild animal collection and
dealing is an Alice-in-Wonderland affair. And
not the least of its oddities is the cost variation.
The lion, king of the beasts, is comparatively low
priced. for example. So is the spectacular but com
mon zebra.
The python is not expensive—-up to a point. This
snake is sold by the foot, at between five and 10
dollars for each of the first six feet, but the rate
skyrockets when an unusually long reptile unwinds.
First place for the most valuable animal of its
kind in any of the world's zoos went in 1947 to a
six-foot-two, 520-pound gorilla in Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo. Its value was estimated at $100,000.
As with other commodities, the price range for
wild animals is a matter of demand and availabil
ity. A little showmanship is involved, too. Out
landish or performing beasts are treasured for
the enthusiastic crowds they draw.
The ordinai*y lion is cheap—changing hands some
times for as little as $100 —because it breeds well
in captivity. On the other hand, the strange okapi,
between a giraffe and a zebra, may sell for $15,000.
More than $12,000 was once paid for a pair of
Indian rhinos in remote Nepal.
Wild animal collectors and professional dealers
travel many thousands of miles for captives, re
turning with virtual Noah's Ark variety. An ex
pedition led by the director of the Washington
Zoo and sponsored by the National Geographic
Society and Smithsonian Institution once brought
back alive nearly 800 animals, birds, and reptiles.
Included in the haul were as many fascinating
stories. At one time, an excited native rushed into
the expedition's Sumatra base bearing a "rare" find.
It turned out to be an escaped American opossum,
one of the good-will gifts brought along by the party
to exchange for Far Eastern prizes.
