# Prevent Forest Fires
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP) â€”The government has opened
the sixlh annual forest fire prevention campaign with
some grim statistics:
Forest, woods, and range fires last year burned
enough saw timber trees to build 80.000 five-room
houses.
They destroyed enough pole-sized trees to pro
vide a year's supply of newsprint for every news
paper in the United States.
Forestry officials said the above is evidence that
forest fires, although decreasing in number, are "still
a major national problem." Forest fires dropped to
172.000 last year, as compared with an annual pre
war average of 210,000.
Oilicials said nine out of 10 forest fires are man

caused. A .'5l per cent increase in the number of
persons visiting national forests now, compared
with 1941, means there is greater necessity for cau
tion to prevent increased fire losses.
The fire prevention campaign was announced joint
ly by the Forest Service, the Agriculture Department,
the Association of State Foresters, and the Adver
tising Council.
"We can't prevent the 10 per cent of our forest
fires that result from lightning,' Secretary of Agri
culture Clinton I'. Anderson said. "But each one of
us can be sure that he does not contribute to
starting the other 90 per cent through a lighted
match dropped in the woods, a neglected campfire.
or other inexcusable carelessness."
Fighting forest fires has its glamorous side and its
dull side. Rangers sometimes are dropped by para
chute to put out fires in isolated areas. The dull side
of fire fighting is the tedious, day-long job of fire
lookout in remote places. During the war women
took over the lonely vigil, and the service kept a
few of them on after the men returned.
