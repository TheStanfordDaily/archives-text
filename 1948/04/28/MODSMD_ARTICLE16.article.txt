What are we going to do about those "forgott'ei
cities" of human beings—the DP camps of Europe
where 1,100,000 men, women, and children still des
perately cling to life and the idea that the rest of
the world will act like human beings?
They need no spokesman for their courage. They
have shown that they are able.

agreements with IRO to take perhaps 314,000 DPs

of our restrictive, highly selective immigration law.
