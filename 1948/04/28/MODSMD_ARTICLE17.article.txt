## Bull Session

There's a terrific resemblance between Italy and
Stanford in this month of April. Any town being
visited by Clyde Beatty's circus might qualify, too.
All two or three —of them are plastered.
Of course, the snide remark that the Italians are
always plastered is unfortunate, because that's not
what I mean —exactly.
The Latins just had an election. Stanford's hav
ing its, and Clyde—well, he's had it, too.
Now. I'm not going to draw any parallel between
Italy and Stanford. The point is both the poor
Italians and the poor Stanford students are being
subjected to the same type of cruelty: proselytizing
promising posters. An Italian still can't walk into a
church or rest room at this late date without seeing
banners and posters:
"Italianos! A vote for Gasperi is a Vote for
American Spaghetti." (This has been one of Italy's
most practical elections.)
"A Vote for Togliatti is a Vote for Russian
Caviar."
"A Vote for Both is Buffet."
"Vote for Gasperi; Los Angeles Has a Coliseum.
Too."
"Vote for Togliatti's Man: He's the Best Damned
Little Street Fighter You Ever Saw."
"Vote Christian Democrat or Forfeit Your Seniority
With St. Peter."
"Tag Along With Toggy."
"Gasp Along With Gaspy."
Hinni!! Those Italians haven't improved their cam
paign slogans much in the last 2,000 years. They dug
up a marble poster in Home the other day which
thev cemented to a wall around 49 B.C. It read:

'A Vote For Caesar Ees Slap Een Crassus'
Keeser."
Propaganda is rather trying at Stanford, too. I
walked into the Encina gym shower minding my own
business, when I perceived feminine eyes looking at
me. Gad! Was I embarrassed. I didn't even know
the girl. This gal, she's running for some ASSU
office, has her campaign picture tacked up to the
showers entrance. All the guys have to pass her pic
ture before they can get into the shower. So far, the
picture's still up.
We've been pulling out napkins in the Encina
dining hall and wiping our lips and blowing our
noses on another candidate.
As one hopeful Democrat put it, '"By God, this
looks like a slam bang Harry election year!"
Course, there's one good thing about these thou
sands of signs covering the walls of the University
They keep off the flyspecks.
My many supporters have been urging me to throw
my hat into the political ring, too. I can't quite see it.
IYIv receding hair line embarrasses .me so.
Of course, they say I've got a natural election slo
gan. myself:
•VOTE!
Velliotes Rhymes With Coyotes
But For You He'H Be Foxy."
Personally, I like to regard myself as more of a
lone wolf. The feminie voters won't cooperate
though. They just stare at the phone when I call
them and laugh like hyenas.
Hmmm. Let's see - Donkey, elephant, Coliseum,
foxy, coyotes, wolf, hyenas, or wild pigs— Say. now.
we're back to Clyde's circus!
