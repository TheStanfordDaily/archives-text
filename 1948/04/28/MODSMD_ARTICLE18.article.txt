# Do You Know the Candidates?
## Presidential Nominees Give Final Statements 
### 
Names of four ASSU presidential candidates will appear on the
student body ballot in the final voting today. One will be chosen
by preferential balloting. Below are the candidate's final state
ments.

(;I S CIIAVALAS 1 am hesitant
to establish an inflexible platform ol
"election pledges." Views which are
appropriate today may seem short
sighted or inadequate in the future.
Issues should be considered on their
merits rather than past political
promises. Our construction, inter
national. athletic, and NSA pro
grams need active support. Qualifi
cations: ASSU Excom, Block "S"
Excom.
KEN CROFT To be brief, I
strongly favor democratic political
freedom, will work for a strong
NSA. have a proposal to cut admin
istrative ted tape (structural
change), favor the foreign scholar
ship plan, and lastly, am the only
absolutely independent candidate. 1
especially urge you to consider the
issues, candidates, and their expe
riences. then vote wisely.
ROY GASKIN—If we are to es
tablish the pre-war unity of the
Stanford Family, hall. Row, and
Village must work together to make
student government effective. Stu
denl government is what we make
it. The ofTice of student body presi
lent is what the ASSU president
makes it. I do not propose to be a
mere figurehead.
FRANK WOLFF— Although my
campaign so far has been out of the
ordinary, and may continue to be
so. 1 sincrely want to become ASSU
president. As president, I would
strive lor a closer relationship be
tween student government and stu
dent body. Campus life needs re
newed spirit.
