# Senators Drop UMT; Ask Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 27 (UP) —
The Senate Armed Forces Commit
tee today voted to scrap universal
military training in favor of an 18-
through-25 draft that would induct
351,000 youths annually for one to
two years' service.
The plan was offered jointly by the
army, navy, and air forces as a
compromise with the strong anti-
UMT sentiment in Congress.
COMBINING FEATURES of both
UMT and the draft, it would provide
161.000 youths between 18 and 19'.a
years of age for 12 months' regular
military service and 190,000 in the
19 1 .2-through-25 bracket for two
years.
The older draftees inducted in the
first year would all go into the army
for unlimited duty. The younger
group would be divided among the
three services and could not serve
in foreign lands.
THE SENATE committee approved
it unanimously—but not finally—as
the best way to meet the armed
forces' manpower needs and still
satisfy congressional foes of uni
versal training.
The committee will get another
vote on the proposal after its staff
finishes writing a formal bill, prob
ably Thursday or Friday.
Strong opposition already was
shaping up in the House Armed
Services Committee. Chairman Wal
ter G. Andrews (R-N. Y.), said it
was "utterly foolish" to combine a
draft law with UMT. His commit
tee is putting the finishing touches
on its own draft bill covering men
in the 19-through-25 age groups.
