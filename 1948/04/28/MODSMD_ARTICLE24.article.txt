## 
### 
ERLINE ANDERSON In answer
to many of you who have wondered
what my qualifications are as a can
didate for vice-president of ASSU. |
I would like to explain that I was j
.secretary-treasurer of Roble, secre
tary of Women's Conference, v ice- !
president of Roth House, chairman
of the Foreign Students Committee
of the "Y" Cabinet, a member of
Sophomore Excom, and 1 have a
genuine interest in the welfare ot
the student body as a whole.
R. .1. DENNING Among the can
didates, aren't you looking for one
with ideas, interest, and experience
of high quality? These three points
are my platform. Because 1 have
worked with many varied groups, 1
believe I could actively carry out
one of my main interests: a far- i
sighted extra - curricular program
co-ordinated to center social activi
ties on the campus, rather than the !
present trend away from the cam
pus.
MEREDITH * MIMI DUNLAP
I'd like to see greater on-campus in
tegration of student units, with the
Village having its share of "closed
dates," more informal get-togethers

to continue the meeting of the stu
dent body past (he freshman year.
My Excom vote would be represen
tative since I have lived in every
district on campus plus a quarter
oft' campus. I have the interest and
would devote my time to the job.
MARILYN JANIX'K I would en
deavor to promote a broader social
program by encouraging more group
participation in campus activities
and by promoting more informal
open houses and al -campus fire
sides. A monthly meeting of all so
cial chairmen would plan the sched
ule of future social functions so that
more selectivity might be made
available each weekend.
NAN SIIKPHbRI) â€” The vice
president must be more than a social
eo-ordinator. She represents Stan
ford to the public, the alumni, md
the administration. I feel, therefore,
that it is of utmost importance to
have an interested officer, one who
has a broad view of campus affairs
and their problems.


VICE-PRESIDENTIAL candidates who will appear on the final ballot
today are (left to right) Mimi Dnnlap, Maril>n Janeck, and B. J. Den
ning. Absent arc Erline Anderson and Nan Shepherd.
