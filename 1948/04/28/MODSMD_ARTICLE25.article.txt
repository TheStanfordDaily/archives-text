When I was a boy, I lived on
a farm;
We ate in the house instead of
the barn,
But we came out West, and was
I surprised!
To hear of a Barn that special
ized . . .
In food for people, instead of
.1 horse,
I'm speaking . . . about LONG
BARN ... of course!!!

Gangsters arc a greedy bunch —
They all belong beneath the sod;

Give one of them an inch,
And he will grab a rod.

"The star is in fine form today,"
Announce his adulators,
"And soon he'll be almost as
good
As his impersonators. l '

Little girls like dolls.
Little boys like soldiers.
Bis; gills like soldiers,
Dig boys like dolls.
