# Men Will Elect Two To Council
## 
### 
Men voters will choose two
representatives to Men's Coun
cil from the four candidates who
are entered in the final balloting.
Voting will be by straight, not
preferential method as with
most of the other candidates.
808 ANDERSON—I believe the
Honor Code to be fundamental. As
1 think that Men's Council is an im
portant part of Stanford life, I
would like -to serve as your repre
sentative.
FRED T. LOOMIS—It is my de
sire, if elected to Men's Council, to
weigh every part of each question
objectively, and to see that justice,
and not precedent, is maintained in
all decisions.
OREN RUSH —It is with Men's
Council that final responsibility for
student government's continued suc
cess rests. Because of this the judi
cial body must be strict without los
ing sight of the fact that each case
is a new problem. My platform is a
pledge of impartial and earnest in
terest in keeping alive the tradi
tional Stanford spirit of student re
sponsibility.
Other candidate—BILL BUBKE.
