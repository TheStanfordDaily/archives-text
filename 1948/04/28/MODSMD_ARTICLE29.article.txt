didates are on the ballot for secretary of the women's organization.
Statements of these candidates appear below.

SECRETARY
WIN AINSWORTII Someone
seeking the office of secretary of
Women's Conference should have
two definite qualifications—experi
ence in similar committee work and
enthusiastic interest in the workings
of Conference. My work as a mem
ber of Freshman Excom has given
me both an insight into school prob
lems and the desire to continue serv
ing in school affairs.
GEE-GEE ANDERSON — Having
worked on Freshman Excom and at
tended Women's Conference during
the fall quarter as an off-campus
representative. I would like to have
the chance to be secretary of Wom
en's Conference, for I believe that
it is a very important part of stu
dent government at Stanford.
I\IA R.I OR IK" L.AVIN — Oonf erence
can be a mediocre organization or a
powerful center of student control;
it's up to the officers to set the pace.
If elected secretary, I would strive
to accomplish the prime purpose of
Women's Conference—to further the
interests of the women students at
Stanford.
