# Wolff Charges Dropped
## 
### 
Charges concerning the validity of
the campaign expenditures of Frank
Wolff, candidate for ASSU president,
were dropped by Excom on the basis
of "inconclusive evidence" at a spe
cial meeting called last night.
A packed Nitery of over 100 spec
tators witnessed a heated debate be
tween "Doc" Klauser, who requested
an investigation, and Wolff's sup
porters.
Klauser contended that the cost of
a loud speaker system on a car was
not included in the expenditures,
while Tom Elke argued that the
loud speaker system was available
to every candidate and therefore
not an expense to be charged to
Wolff.
KLAUSER FURTHER charged
that a Phelps-Terkel ad run in The
Daily, in which Wolff's name was
used, was a form of publicity not
available to every candidate. He
stated that Phelps was contacted and
refused to use any other ASSU can
didate's name in connection with an
ad. According to the constitution, all
campaign materials must be avail
able to all candidates.
Wolff's forces maintained that
their candidate was rendering Phelps
a service, not vice-versa. "No money
was spent in this connection by
Wolff," they contended. Their view
point was upheld by Fred Hannum
who said that Wolff's managers were
present at the right moment, and had
any of the other candidates' sup
porters been there instead, a sim
ilar arrangements would have been
worked out.
Excom, after one hour and a half
of debate, did not choose to inter
pret any section of the constitution
pertaining to elections. Instead it
voted to accept the resolution pro
posed by Bob Brown that "because
the evidence presented is inconclu
sive, charges be dropped against
candidate Frank Wolff."
ASSU President Tom Martzloff
pointed out that under the consti
tution any student may challenge
a candidate's campaign expenditures
at any time. Last night's action by
Excom does not preclude reexamina
tion of the case should it be brought
up by any student at a future date,
he said.
