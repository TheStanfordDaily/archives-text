# Council Views Given By Women Candidates
## 
### 
Three all-campus representatives to Women's Council will be
chosen by women voters from the 11 candidates who seek the
post for the 1948-49 term of office. Candidates for the office have
given their statements below.

PAULA BLAIR —As a member of i
Committee of Seven at Lagunita I j
learned how important it is to have
the house committees well inle- I
grated with Women's Council. Only
with this integration is it possible
to clarify the rules in the women's
rseidences. I believe that the pri
mary function of the Council is to
prevent violatons; however, where
cases are brought before the Council,
I wou!d try them impartially.
NAN DRAPER — A constructive
effort to bring social regulations up
to date at Stanford is being made j
at present. And, at the same time, a j
constructive effort to clear the books
as regards petty details and the pen
alty system is being attempted. As
chairman of Committee of Nine and
as a member of the committee that j
is trying to better social regulations j
here on campus, I would welcome
the opportunity to continue this en- !
deavor as a member of Women's
Council.
JOAN FRASER—Women's Coun
cil p'ays a vital role in the life of I
every Stanford woman, not only be- j
cause of its judicial function, but
because it is a policy-making body, I
and because each Council member
represents every woman on campus. [
I fully realize the importance of the
position, and I am very anxious to j
serve you through Council. Quali
fications: Council representative on j
Committee of Nine for a year.
MARGE GRUNEWALD—I believe
that the most important work of j
Women's Council is in the interpre- I
tation of the Honor Code, and as a
member of the Honor Code Com- j
mittee, I feel that I have a good un
derstanding of its meaning. If I'm
elected I shall consider each case in J
the light of the particular circum- !
stances concerned and decide ac- j
ordingiy.
ANN lIERATY —My interest in
Women's Council was increased by
working on the committee which |
submitted to you the suggested plan
for Council revision. The aim of

this plan is to achieve a more effi
cient kind of machinery through co
ordination, orientation, and, if you
deign, area representation.
CYNTHIA (CECE) STOLTZE
Qualifications: Committee of Eight
(Union). Platform: Careful, un
biased consideration of cases and of
new social policies. Changes in
Women's Council according to the
program now under discussion
which includes better orientation for
new members of Council, more co
ordination of Council with various
group committees, and area repre
sentation in Women's Council itself.
"BUFFY" WORKING—I am ex
tremely interested in the work of
Women's Council because I believe
that the Honor Code and the Funda
mental Standard are two of the most
valuable features of Stanford life.
Furthermore, I feel that I am well
qualified for a position on Women's
Council. My past experience in
cludes being head sponsor at Bran
ner this year and being a member on
the Housing Committee last year.
Other candidates — BARBARA
BORTHWICK. THEO McGl T IRE,
MARTHA REDDING, JODIE DE
REMER.
