TED BUTTXER—The class of '51
next fa 11 can stand as a line example

our potentialiies as we have started
to do this year. My desire is to co
ordinate the class toward this goal
of putting Stanford spirit back on
top.

shown by the class of '51 this year
has been admired by the entire |
Stanford campus. Our opportunities :
for successful activities will be i
equally great next year. But wc

this quarter, to give Us a head start
on plans for the fall.
JO LYON—Our class of '51 has
shown itself to be outstanding in
leadership, initiative, and athlctics.
I'd very much like to have the op
portunity to help continue our line ;

rience on Frosh Excom and mv sin- i
cere enthusiasm are my qualifica
tions.
MARILYN MYERSOX—In fulfill
ing a job like sophomore class sec
retary-treasurer, the "extras" count
— the ability to ofTer suggestions,
ideas, and to help put them across, i

resentative of this, the best class 1
