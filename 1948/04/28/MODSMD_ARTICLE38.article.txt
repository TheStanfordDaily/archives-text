These are the statements of the candidates:

DISTRICT 111 *
BILL BEEK —An elected repre
sentative, holding an office of re
sponsibility, has a great deal more
to do than exercise his best judg
ment at meetings. Ho should main
tain a close contact with his con
stituents, attempting to inform them
and himself more fully on the af
fairs and opinions of the student
body. This I propose to do.
Other candi d a 1 e s DAVII)
DAHLE, DON MX, VI(J RAN
DOLPH.
DISTRICT IV
AL BUCKLEY — The demands
upon an Excom representative are
hard work, clear thinking, and close
acquaintance with all facets of cam- !
pus life. Do I qualify? Judge for
yourself. Daily business staff (1946-
47), fraternity scribe (1948), wres
tling team (1946-47), co-ordinator of j
Convalescent Home activities for j
Toyon (1947), co - organizer and!
president of Los Arcos eating club
(1946-47), University Chorus (1946-
48), Army administrative NCO
(1944-46).
DON DA VIES—I would like to
have an active part in giving Stan- :
ford an aggressive, colorful, student
minded student government. Excom
should take immediate steps to se- j
cure a Student Union and build up i
the school's athletic program. As
your Excom representative I would
hold a weekly meeting with a rep
resentative from each Upper Row
house, so that I could take back to
Excom your ideas as well as my ;

own. I feel I have had enough expe
rience in student government to 1
qualify me to serve as your Excom
representative.
Other candidate—BlLL ARCE.
DISTRICT VII
RICHARD KELTON—Specific is- |
sues change—the main problem is
to meet all the issues as a true rep
resentative of the opinion of Toyon I
Hal!. I propose, if elected, to post
summaries of Excom meeetings ;

above suggestion boxes on the two
main bulletin boards in the hall, en
abling me to keep in touch with
you. I'd like the privilege of being
your representative.

choice in both districts.
Statements of the candidates are as follows:

DISTRICT II
ANN ERASER—As my first two
years of college were spent on an
other campus, I have had opportu

practices which I feel could be ap

be positive contributions to Stan

views are adequately presented to
Excom on all issues. Qualifications:
