# Off-Campus Students Choose 3 for Excom
## 
### 
Off-campus students will elect a short term candidate to Excom
from District I to fill out the rest of the spring quarter. They will
also choose two long term representatives from their district for
the 1948-49 school year. Two are seeking the short term post
while seven seek two long term seats.
Statements appear below.

ROBB CRIST — Off-campus stu
dents contribute a majority of Un
ion business. Either let's get our
money's worth (which means lower
prices), or have the Union profit
spent to help us, perhaps for a new
Union. Also I would like to see stu
dent activities get the money and
recognition they deserve.
JERRY DAKIN (long and short
term) —Since off-campus students
are often step-children in the Stan
ford Family, I propose an off-campus
organization, together with increased
"activity" opportunities for all stu
dents. I will work for a new Union
with facilities for off-campus stu
dents and will strive to further the
campus programs of such national
student organizations as NSA.
REID DENNIS—I firmly believe
in a progressive student government,
actively concerned with conditions
on our own campus and in other
parts of the world. But Stanford
must come first. Student funds must
not be used for the interests of a
small minority but must in some
measure benefit the whole.
AL JOHNSON —One feature of my
program is to achieve greater ofT
campus participation in student body
activities. I wish to organize a
men's off-campus club to work with
the women's off-campus club. Kla
hoya, to arrange for off-campus ac
tivities, including work with for
eign groups for their greater partici
pation in Stanford's student affairs.
BILL ROSE and MURRAY TODD
—We are campaigning together be
cause we firmly believe in the ne
cessity of a strong unified voice in
Excom for the estimated 2.400 off
campus students. This doesn't mean
a little two-man block. Rather it
means the agreement of the two off
campus members to co-operate fully
with their constituents in voicing the

needs and wants of all off-campus
students. We believe our concerted
action is the most effective repre
sentation off - campus students can
get. #
ERNIE SCHMIDT (short term)—
(1) I intend to support the foreign
scholarship plan as passed by the
student body; oppose the ban
on political groups which prevents
them from holding meetings on cam
pus; (3) I favor increased recogni
tion of the minor sports; (4) I favor
additional appropriations for student
intellectual activity; (5) I favor a
reapportioning of Excom seats with
increased representation for those
districts warranting it.
LEON SLOSS — Have served on
Sophomore Excom (1946-47), as spe
cial assistant for SIRO, president of
El Toro eating club and of Inter-
Club Council. My only campaign
promise is that I would go into stu
dent government with a sincere de
sire to serve the student body and
the University. I believe this can
only be done by close personal con
tact with student opinion.

Kohl) Crist. A 1 Johnson, and Leon Sloss. Not present are Jerry
Dakin (long and short term). Bill Rose, Ernie Schmidt (short temi), and
