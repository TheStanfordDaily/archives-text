# Six Pledges Swipe Silver, Bag Blankets
## 
### BY WAYNE SARGENT 
Members of Sigma Chi slept less
warmly last night than usual, and
there may have been doubts in the
minds of some as to whether or not
they were going to be able to eat
breakfast.
The reason was that their six
pledges stole the two items no fra
ternity house should be withoutâ€”
blankets and silverware.
During a house meeting of the
regular members night before last,
the six pledges efficiently looted all
the blankets and silverware in the
house.
THE NEOPHYTES finally de
posited the silver in front of an En
cina freshman's door, and the blan
kets on the porch of Cubberley house
about six o'clock in the morning.
The silverware was discovered by
the frosh in the morning, who rec
ognized the monogram of Sigma Chi,
the monogram of the Palace, and
others.
THE SILVERWARE was prompt
ly picked up by the Sigma Chi mem
bers, but they insisted it was the
pledges' duty to retrieve the blan
kets.
Meanwhile, the women of Cub
berley decided to turn their littered
porch into some sort of economic
asset. A "surplus blanket" sale fol
lowed in which some fine $20 virgin
wool blankets were sold for the
inflationary prices of 15 to 50 cents.
The members of Sigma Chi now
occupy a different owner relation
ship with their silverware, blankets,
and pledges. For while the silver
ware is back, only some of the blan
kets have been recovered, and nary
a one of the pledges has yet re
turned.
