# A 						Farce?

(EDITORIAL)

Is student government at Stanford a farce?
Sometimes it seems so, but actually it is not!
Student government is a vital and necessary
cog in this University, just as the Palo Alto city
council is vital to that town.
If Stanford student government is a farce, so
is our American form of democracy. Who will
admit that?
Here's why our student government is not
a farce:
1. Organization.—Doesn't a well-run group
defeat a disorganized mob every time? What
could we accomplish as single individuals?
2. Administration.—Who would attend to the
countless details of any society if some sort of
government did not take the time and effort to
do so? Who holds what dances when may not
be an important question in itself, but think of
the chaos here at Stanford or at any other place
if everyone did as he pleased with no sort of
regulation at all. (Incidentally, isn't any amount
of self-regulation better than outside regula
tion?)
3. Channel of information.—Even the most se

vere critic will admit the Administration makes
at least a nominal effort to keep students happy.
That's plain smart business. And it certainly is
of benefit to the students. Kow can the Ad
ministration know and, to some extent, cater to
the wishes of the student body unless there is
an organization to communicate those wishes?
4. Representation.—ln the eyes of the outside
world, who is the Stanford student body? The
ASSU president represents Stanford students
everywhere he goes in an official capacity. The
alumni, for instance, base their judgment of
current students on the impression they get
from the ASSU president and other student body
officers. The alumni materially help in sup
porting this University.
Is student government useless? The foreign
scholarship plan, involving $9,000, was con
ceived, brought into being, and will be carried
out completely by students working through
student government. Is that $9,000 worth of use
lessness? And how about the Honor Code?
Student government a farce? We don't think
so. It depends on the voters to keep it f r im
becoming a farce. You get what you vote fv.
