Wherever you sit in Western
Pacific's new Vista - Dome cars,
you're next to a window and
close to a sweeping view...
Vista-Dome cars are like glass
houses on wheels with transpar
ent thermapane walls and roof.
The whole breath-taking pano
rama is yours... all the way
... as you relax in comfort...
see the Feather River Canyon
and Colorado Rockies by day
light this summer. W. P. is the
only western railroad to have
Vista-Dome coaches. No extra
fare for this extra look along
"the most scenic railroad in
America." No wonder Western
Pacific's giant diesel-powered
transcontinental trains sell out
fast. Make your reservations
now! Coast to Coast... no
change of Pullman or porter.
