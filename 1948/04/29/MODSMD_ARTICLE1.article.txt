TEL AVIV. April 28 (UP)
Rocket-firing RAF planes and heavy
British tanks were thrown into the
battle for Jaffa today against ad
vancing forces of the Jewish Irgun
Zvai Leumi, it was announced ofii
ciallv.
Planes armed with cannon and
rockets fired into the Jewish sec
tion of Bat Yam. springboard for
Irgun attacks on battered Jaffa, the
announcement said.
RAILWAY PROPERTY in Jaffa
was reprted ablaze after 24 hours
oi' intensive Jewish mortar attack.
The Irgun advance on the northern
outskirts of Jaffa was slow, in the
face oi' strong Arab resistance.
A British report said the Arabs
had repulsed several attacks but had
suffered heavy casualties.
British tanks rumbled into the
cross-fire between Arabs and Jews,
holding up Irgun's advance.
BUT OTHER Jewish forces were
hammering from the south and
northeast to complete an encircle
ment of the all-Arab city of GO,OOO.
Panic-stricken Arabs swarmed to
Jaffa's dock area—the only sector
still open—and scrambled aboard
Egyptian and Lebanese sailing boats
and anything else that could take
them away. It was reminiscent of
the wild Arab evacuation that fol
lowed the Jewish victory at Haifa.
It was impossible to compile ac
curate casualty lists as the battle
raged on at least four separate fronts
r>nd among four distinct forces—
the British Army, the Arabs, the
moderate Jewish Haganah Organ
ization and the extremist Irgun.
