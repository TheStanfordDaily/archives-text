HELSINKI, Finland, April 28 (UP)
â€”Parliament today approved the
Finnish-Russian treaty of friendship
and mutual assistance after three
hours of orderly and peaceful de
bate.
The final vote followed the defeat
of a Liberal Party proposal that the
pact be disapproved, and a commu
nist amendment that sought a change
in interpretation of the treaty's
military assistance clause.
Nineteen deputies spoke during
the debate but only liberal members
oposed approving the pact. Soviet
Premier Joseph Stalin himself ap
proved the pact Feb. 22 in a personal
letter to Finnish President Julio K.
Paasikivi. Negotiations were con
cluded April G when the treaty was
signed in Moscow.
The galleries were only half-filled
and there were no crowds outside
when today's session started. Police
had taken no special precautions
against disorder although a smte of
preparedness decreed two days ago
still was effective. There were no
disturbances.
Final approval of the pact was
preceded by the defeat of a commu
nist amendment to change the for
eign affairs committee's recom
mendation on the interpretation of
the treaty's second clause which
said Finland must decide whether
10 ask military assistance from Rus
sia in event of an attack.
