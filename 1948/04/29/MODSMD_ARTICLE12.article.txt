WASHINGTON, April 28 (UP)—
The House Un-American Activities
Committee today approved a com
munist-control bill loaded with pro
visions its backers hope are tough
enough to drive the party out o!
business.
Committee members hope to
bring the measure to a showdown
vote on the House floor early next
j week.
Sponsored by Rep. Karl E. Mundt
(R-S. D.), the bill would brand the
American Communist Party as part
of an international conspiracy. The
present party leaders from Chairman
William Z. Foster down would bt.
subject to a possible $10,000 tint
and one year in jail for criminal
conspiracy unless they renounced
all ties with Moscow.
The party itself would be com
pelled to register annually with the
Justice Department and give th„
government a list of all iis mem
bers.
The party and its fronts would lx
obliged to label plainly all propa
. ganda material sent through the
mails and to put the same "red"
tag on communist-sponsored radi
broadcasts.
Members of the Communist Part;,
would be barred from the federal
payroll and would be forbidden evt:
to seek a government job withoi
I disclosing that they are communist.-
