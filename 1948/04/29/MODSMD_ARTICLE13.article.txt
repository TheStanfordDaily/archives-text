# Letter from Bogota Tells of Violence
## Girl Tells of Fright From Snipers, Fires 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is a letter received by Pat Paterson
from Jeanne Sersanous Scott, now in Bogota, where her husband is work
ing for an oil company. Mrs. Scott attended Stanford 1944-1947.)
Dear Patty,
Yesterday I sent a cable home (for 14 pesos) saying "safe."
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty, for right now there is so
vnuch shooting in the streets that the noise is deafening.
I hardly pay any attention to it any more, which is proved by
the fact that last night I slept through half an hour of it while

Matilda was up pacing the floor. It
was the first thing I heard this
morning when I awoke.
IF THEY'RE SNIPING at the
building you certainly can't run out
on the street and into their arms.
So with this fatalistic view I just
turned over and went back to sleep.
No place I'd rather die than in my
own soft bed anyway.
I will try to go over for you the
Things that have happened here.
These past few days have been filled
with terror and horror and they will
be with me till I die. On Friday
when this all started I had decided
to spend the day in bed. I had been
to a cocktail party the night before,
and I was lying there surrounded by
magazines when Matilda brought
the news that Gaitan had been shot.
Pie was like Gandhi, she said, and
people were fighting in the streets.
I PUT IT DOWN to localized riot—
in:* and didn't think much about it.
But Matilda was quite uneasy and I
gave her permission to go clown
stairs again. About 20 minutes later
I began to hear shooting — so I
thought I would just turn on the
radio to see what was happening.
That was when I received my first
shock. A hoarse voice was crying
"Down with the Conservatives!" and
it was demanding the President's
resignation, threatening to shoot him
on sight, calling all men to arms,
telling them to break into the stores
ro get weapons—they wouldn't be
stealing, just defending themselves—
and crying, "Revolucion, revolu
tion!" Thus was born the revolu
tion.
I WAS STUNNED, but all it meant
to me at the time was that I'd prob
ably have to spend the weekend
locked in the apartment. I was still
thinking along those lines when Ma
tilda came running in to say that the
city was on fire.
Throwing a coat over my pajamas
I dashed up to the seventh floor to
see. Sure enough, there were half
a dozen fires scattered around. Ma
tilda pointed them out as the Con
servative newspaper building and
several government buildings.
I WAS SHOCKED more than any
thing—how could these people set
fire to their own city! I worried
because the buildings are old and
not at all substantial, and I was
afraid that the fire would spread.
We finished dinner when all of
a sudden everyone began running
and screaming in the halls. When
I threw open the door there was

smoke filtering up the steps. It was
then that I got that feeling of sick
terror which is still with me. I felt
ns if I had a load of lead in my
stomach. As I watched people come
running down the stairs with coats
and suitcases 1 could only stand
there completely numb and watch.
IT CAME OVER ME then 1 10 w
alone I was and that 1 had abso
lutely no place to go. I ran down
stairs finally, and the hall was tilled
with smoke. Yet I couldn't see any
fire. Nobody down there spoke
English and I didn't know what was
happening.
I tried to call my only friend here
in the building but there was noth
ing to do but come back up and col
lect a few things. I always wondered
what I would take with me in a lire.
I gathered all my money and my
sweetheart pin, put on my fur coat
with my raincoat over it, grabbed
the camera and opened the door.
I'll never forget the feeling of re
lief that flowed through me when
I saw Chris and Grove Blood, my
friends from upstairs, standing out
side my door.
TIIEY I1AI) COME DOWN to get
me and I was so grateful I could
have cried. But they said that the
fire was across the street and they
weren't sure whether we would have
to leave or not. So I went up to their
apartment which faced the fire. An
other man came in and the four of
us decided not to evacuate until we
had to. We had no place to go, and
I could see now that the street was
filled with mobs — violent mobs,

smashing everything in sight and
carrying machetes, bayonets, rifles,
and revolvers.
So the danger became threefold—
the fire across the narrow one-way
street might blow our way; the mob
on the street might break in and
set fire to our building. If either of
these happened and we had to go out
on the street, we might be killed be
fore we had taken two steps. I
think this last frightened me more
than anything.
AT ANY RATE I could only sit
I there and watch dully as Grove took
down all the curtains and pushed
the furniture back into the middle of
the room. I stayed there all night,
; with my coats on and my camera
around my neck and underneath so
that 1 looked about eight months
I pregnant, and everyone who came
i along felt so sorry for me having to
go through all that in my "condi
tion." *•
I was so sick I didn't even bother
to explain. I clutched my money and
my pin and even when Grove finally
: sent Chris and me to lie down about
S 3 a.m., I wouldn't let go of it. But
how can you sleep when the fire
lights up the whole room. An elec
tric shop down the street caught on
and exploded for half an hour.
BUT EAR WORSE was the mob
in the street shouting "Viva la Co
lombia," while they smashed and
s set fire to everything in sight. Ev
! ery time they yelled, cold chills went
all over me.
Well, we lived through the night,
and on Saturday Bogota was already
the picture of devastation. The whole
I block across from us was burning,
and the smoke was so thick that we
! couldn't see much beyond. We found
that during the night our electricity
had gone oIT so I came down to my
apartment to cat a cold breakfast.
I WAS TOO TERRIFIED to stay
alone so I went back upstairs. The
i mob was still on the street looting
and I have never seen anything like
! it. They carried off radios, refriger
ators, sewing machines, food, cloth
; ing, furniture—it was unbelievable.
| About that time they broke into a
restaurant and bar directly below
us. so we had a good view of it all
from the window.
First they smashed the glass with
i various objects. One man wielded a

naked mannikin which was ex
tremely effective! Then they slashed
their way in with machetes. The
first thing that they carried off were
the bar stools. What possible use
they will have in an adobe hut is
beyond me. Next came the tables
and chairs, then dishes, silver, lin
ens, liquor, and finally a woman
struggled out with two huge kitchen
pots still filled with yesterday's to
mato soup!
AT THAT POINT the owner came
out with a pistol and started shoot
ing and that was the end of that.
Maybe you are surprised that I
mentioned a woman looting—there
were hundreds of them, and children
and old people — all dragging off
whatever they could handle.
Most of it was disgusting but some

of it amusing in a way. They looted
a bookstore. It was just around the
corner and everyone ran up our
street stopping just in front of us
to inspect the books they had taken.
They hadn't even bothered to look!
And, Patty, you could see that I bey
were all ignorant peasants and
couldn't read a word anyway. A
friend of our was standing down in
the doorway when a ragged man
went by with a thick red engineer
ing book.
Our friend stopped him and asked
him what he was going to do with it.
The boy clutched it to him and
cried, "It's mine! It's mine!" and
ran off. And that's the general at
titude.

and I have never seen anything like
! it. They carried off radios, refriger
ators, sewing machines, food, cloth
; ing, furniture—it was unbelievable.
| About that time they broke into a
restaurant and bar directly below
us. so we had a good view of it all
from the window.
First they smashed the glass with
i various objects. One man wielded a

naked mannikin which was ex
tremely effective! Then they slashed
their way in with machetes. The
first thing that they carried off were
the bar stools. What possible use
they will have in an adobe hut is
beyond me. Next came the tables
and chairs, then dishes, silver, lin
ens, liquor, and finally a woman
struggled out with two huge kitchen
pots still filled with yesterday's to
mato soup!
AT THAT POINT the owner came
out with a pistol and started shoot
ing and that was the end of that.
Maybe you are surprised that I
mentioned a woman looting—there
were hundreds of them, and children
and old people — all dragging off
whatever they could handle.
Most of it was disgusting but some

of it amusing in a way. They looted
a bookstore. It was just around the
corner and everyone ran up our
street stopping just in front of us
to inspect the books they had taken.
They hadn't even bothered to look!
And, Patty, you could see that I bey
were all ignorant peasants and
couldn't read a word anyway. A
friend of our was standing down in
the doorway when a ragged man
went by with a thick red engineer
ing book.
Our friend stopped him and asked
him what he was going to do with it.
The boy clutched it to him and
cried, "It's mine! It's mine!" and
ran off. And that's the general at

(Editor's note: The following is a letter received by Pat Paterson
from Jeanne Sersanous Scott, now in Bogota, where her husband is work
ing for an oil company. Mrs. Scott attended Stanford 1944-1947.)
Dear Patty,
Yesterday I sent a cable home (for 14 pesos) saying "safe."
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty, for right now there is so
vnuch shooting in the streets that the noise is deafening.
I hardly pay any attention to it any more, which is proved by
the fact that last night I slept through half an hour of it while

Matilda was up pacing the floor. It
was the first thing I heard this
morning when I awoke.
IF THEY'RE SNIPING at the
building you certainly can't run out
on the street and into their arms.
So with this fatalistic view I just
turned over and went back to sleep.
No place I'd rather die than in my
own soft bed anyway.
I will try to go over for you the
Things that have happened here.
These past few days have been filled
with terror and horror and they will
be with me till I die. On Friday
when this all started I had decided
to spend the day in bed. I had been
to a cocktail party the night before,
and I was lying there surrounded by
magazines when Matilda brought
the news that Gaitan had been shot.
Pie was like Gandhi, she said, and
people were fighting in the streets.
I PUT IT DOWN to localized riot—
in:* and didn't think much about it.
But Matilda was quite uneasy and I
gave her permission to go clown
stairs again. About 20 minutes later
I began to hear shooting — so I
thought I would just turn on the
radio to see what was happening.
That was when I received my first
shock. A hoarse voice was crying
"Down with the Conservatives!" and
it was demanding the President's
resignation, threatening to shoot him
on sight, calling all men to arms,
telling them to break into the stores
ro get weapons—they wouldn't be
stealing, just defending themselves—
and crying, "Revolucion, revolu
tion!" Thus was born the revolu
tion.
I WAS STUNNED, but all it meant
to me at the time was that I'd prob
ably have to spend the weekend
locked in the apartment. I was still
thinking along those lines when Ma
tilda came running in to say that the
city was on fire.
Throwing a coat over my pajamas
I dashed up to the seventh floor to
see. Sure enough, there were half
a dozen fires scattered around. Ma
tilda pointed them out as the Con
servative newspaper building and
several government buildings.
I WAS SHOCKED more than any
thing—how could these people set
fire to their own city! I worried
because the buildings are old and
not at all substantial, and I was
afraid that the fire would spread.
We finished dinner when all of
a sudden everyone began running
and screaming in the halls. When
I threw open the door there was

smoke filtering up the steps. It was
then that I got that feeling of sick
terror which is still with me. I felt
ns if I had a load of lead in my
stomach. As I watched people come
running down the stairs with coats
and suitcases 1 could only stand
there completely numb and watch.
IT CAME OVER ME then 1 10 w
alone I was and that 1 had abso
lutely no place to go. I ran down
stairs finally, and the hall was tilled
with smoke. Yet I couldn't see any
fire. Nobody down there spoke
English and I didn't know what was
happening.
I tried to call my only friend here
in the building but there was noth
ing to do but come back up and col
lect a few things. I always wondered
what I would take with me in a lire.
I gathered all my money and my
sweetheart pin, put on my fur coat
with my raincoat over it, grabbed
the camera and opened the door.
I'll never forget the feeling of re
lief that flowed through me when
I saw Chris and Grove Blood, my
friends from upstairs, standing out
side my door.
TIIEY I1AI) COME DOWN to get
me and I was so grateful I could
have cried. But they said that the
fire was across the street and they
weren't sure whether we would have
to leave or not. So I went up to their
apartment which faced the fire. An
other man came in and the four of
us decided not to evacuate until we
had to. We had no place to go, and
I could see now that the street was
filled with mobs — violent mobs,

smashing everything in sight and
carrying machetes, bayonets, rifles,
and revolvers.
So the danger became threefold—
the fire across the narrow one-way
street might blow our way; the mob
on the street might break in and
set fire to our building. If either of
these happened and we had to go out
on the street, we might be killed be
fore we had taken two steps. I
think this last frightened me more
than anything.
AT ANY RATE I could only sit
I there and watch dully as Grove took
down all the curtains and pushed
the furniture back into the middle of
the room. I stayed there all night,
; with my coats on and my camera
around my neck and underneath so
that 1 looked about eight months
I pregnant, and everyone who came
i along felt so sorry for me having to
go through all that in my "condi
tion." *•
I was so sick I didn't even bother
to explain. I clutched my money and
my pin and even when Grove finally
: sent Chris and me to lie down about
S 3 a.m., I wouldn't let go of it. But
how can you sleep when the fire
lights up the whole room. An elec
tric shop down the street caught on
and exploded for half an hour.
BUT EAR WORSE was the mob
in the street shouting "Viva la Co
lombia," while they smashed and
s set fire to everything in sight. Ev
! ery time they yelled, cold chills went
all over me.
Well, we lived through the night,
and on Saturday Bogota was already
the picture of devastation. The whole
I block across from us was burning,
and the smoke was so thick that we
! couldn't see much beyond. We found
that during the night our electricity
had gone oIT so I came down to my
apartment to cat a cold breakfast.
I WAS TOO TERRIFIED to stay
alone so I went back upstairs. The
i mob was still on the street looting
and I have never seen anything like
! it. They carried off radios, refriger
ators, sewing machines, food, cloth
; ing, furniture—it was unbelievable.

the fire across the narrow one-way
street might blow our way; the mob
on the street might break in and
set fire to our building. If either of
these happened and we had to go out
on the street, we might be killed be
fore we had taken two steps. I
think this last frightened me more
than anything.
AT ANY RATE I could only sit
I there and watch dully as Grove took
down all the curtains and pushed
the furniture back into the middle of
the room. I stayed there all night,
; with my coats on and my camera
around my neck and underneath so
that 1 looked about eight months
I pregnant, and everyone who came
i along felt so sorry for me having to
go through all that in my "condi
tion." *•
I was so sick I didn't even bother
to explain. I clutched my money and
my pin and even when Grove finally
: sent Chris and me to lie down about
S 3 a.m., I wouldn't let go of it. But
how can you sleep when the fire
lights up the whole room. An elec
tric shop down the street caught on
and exploded for half an hour.
BUT EAR WORSE was the mob
in the street shouting "Viva la Co
lombia," while they smashed and
s set fire to everything in sight. Ev
! ery time they yelled, cold chills went
all over me.
Well, we lived through the night,
and on Saturday Bogota was already
the picture of devastation. The whole
I block across from us was burning,
and the smoke was so thick that we
! couldn't see much beyond. We found
that during the night our electricity
had gone oIT so I came down to my
apartment to cat a cold breakfast.
I WAS TOO TERRIFIED to stay
alone so I went back upstairs. The
i mob was still on the street looting
and I have never seen anything like
! it. They carried off radios, refriger
ators, sewing machines, food, cloth
; ing, furniture—it was unbelievable.
| About that time they broke into a
restaurant and bar directly below
us. so we had a good view of it all
from the window.
First they smashed the glass with
i various objects. One man wielded a

naked mannikin which was ex
tremely effective! Then they slashed
their way in with machetes. The
first thing that they carried off were
the bar stools. What possible use
they will have in an adobe hut is
beyond me. Next came the tables
and chairs, then dishes, silver, lin
ens, liquor, and finally a woman
struggled out with two huge kitchen
pots still filled with yesterday's to
mato soup!
AT THAT POINT the owner came
out with a pistol and started shoot
ing and that was the end of that.
Maybe you are surprised that I
mentioned a woman looting—there
were hundreds of them, and children
and old people — all dragging off
whatever they could handle.
Most of it was disgusting but some

of it amusing in a way. They looted
a bookstore. It was just around the
corner and everyone ran up our
street stopping just in front of us
to inspect the books they had taken.
They hadn't even bothered to look!
And, Patty, you could see that I bey
were all ignorant peasants and
couldn't read a word anyway. A
friend of our was standing down in
the doorway when a ragged man
went by with a thick red engineer
ing book.
Our friend stopped him and asked
him what he was going to do with it.
The boy clutched it to him and
cried, "It's mine! It's mine!" and
ran off. And that's the general at

(Editor's note: The following is a letter received by Pat Paterson
from Jeanne Sersanous Scott, now in Bogota, where her husband is work
ing for an oil company. Mrs. Scott attended Stanford 1944-1947.)
Dear Patty,
Yesterday I sent a cable home (for 14 pesos) saying "safe."
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty, for right now there is so
vnuch shooting in the streets that the noise is deafening.
I hardly pay any attention to it any more, which is proved by
the fact that last night I slept through half an hour of it while

Matilda was up pacing the floor. It
was the first thing I heard this
morning when I awoke.
IF THEY'RE SNIPING at the
building you certainly can't run out
on the street and into their arms.
So with this fatalistic view I just
turned over and went back to sleep.
No place I'd rather die than in my
own soft bed anyway.
I will try to go over for you the
Things that have happened here.
These past few days have been filled
with terror and horror and they will
be with me till I die. On Friday
when this all started I had decided
to spend the day in bed. I had been
to a cocktail party the night before,
and I was lying there surrounded by
magazines when Matilda brought
the news that Gaitan had been shot.
Pie was like Gandhi, she said, and
people were fighting in the streets.
I PUT IT DOWN to localized riot—
in:* and didn't think much about it.
But Matilda was quite uneasy and I
gave her permission to go clown
stairs again. About 20 minutes later
I began to hear shooting — so I
thought I would just turn on the
radio to see what was happening.
That was when I received my first
shock. A hoarse voice was crying
"Down with the Conservatives!" and
it was demanding the President's
resignation, threatening to shoot him
on sight, calling all men to arms,
telling them to break into the stores
ro get weapons—they wouldn't be
stealing, just defending themselves—
and crying, "Revolucion, revolu
tion!" Thus was born the revolu
tion.
I WAS STUNNED, but all it meant
to me at the time was that I'd prob
ably have to spend the weekend
locked in the apartment. I was still
thinking along those lines when Ma
tilda came running in to say that the
city was on fire.
Throwing a coat over my pajamas
I dashed up to the seventh floor to
see. Sure enough, there were half
a dozen fires scattered around. Ma
tilda pointed them out as the Con
servative newspaper building and
several government buildings.
I WAS SHOCKED more than any
thing—how could these people set
fire to their own city! I worried
because the buildings are old and
not at all substantial, and I was
afraid that the fire would spread.
We finished dinner when all of
a sudden everyone began running
and screaming in the halls. When
I threw open the door there was

smoke filtering up the steps. It was
then that I got that feeling of sick
terror which is still with me. I felt
ns if I had a load of lead in my
stomach. As I watched people come
running down the stairs with coats
and suitcases 1 could only stand
there completely numb and watch.
IT CAME OVER ME then 1 10 w
alone I was and that 1 had abso
lutely no place to go. I ran down
stairs finally, and the hall was tilled
with smoke. Yet I couldn't see any
fire. Nobody down there spoke
English and I didn't know what was
happening.
I tried to call my only friend here
in the building but there was noth
ing to do but come back up and col
lect a few things. I always wondered
what I would take with me in a lire.
I gathered all my money and my
sweetheart pin, put on my fur coat
with my raincoat over it, grabbed
the camera and opened the door.
I'll never forget the feeling of re
lief that flowed through me when
I saw Chris and Grove Blood, my
friends from upstairs, standing out
side my door.
TIIEY I1AI) COME DOWN to get
me and I was so grateful I could
have cried. But they said that the
fire was across the street and they
weren't sure whether we would have
to leave or not. So I went up to their
apartment which faced the fire. An
other man came in and the four of
us decided not to evacuate until we
had to. We had no place to go, and
I could see now that the street was
filled with mobs — violent mobs,

smashing everything in sight and
carrying machetes, bayonets, rifles,
and revolvers.
So the danger became threefold—
the fire across the narrow one-way
street might blow our way; the mob
on the street might break in and

and screaming in the halls. When
I threw open the door there was

smoke filtering up the steps. It was
then that I got that feeling of sick
terror which is still with me. I felt
ns if I had a load of lead in my
stomach. As I watched people come
running down the stairs with coats
and suitcases 1 could only stand
there completely numb and watch.
IT CAME OVER ME then 1 10 w
alone I was and that 1 had abso
lutely no place to go. I ran down
stairs finally, and the hall was tilled
with smoke. Yet I couldn't see any
fire. Nobody down there spoke
English and I didn't know what was
happening.
I tried to call my only friend here
in the building but there was noth
ing to do but come back up and col
lect a few things. I always wondered
what I would take with me in a lire.
I gathered all my money and my
sweetheart pin, put on my fur coat
with my raincoat over it, grabbed
the camera and opened the door.
I'll never forget the feeling of re
lief that flowed through me when
I saw Chris and Grove Blood, my
friends from upstairs, standing out
side my door.
TIIEY I1AI) COME DOWN to get
me and I was so grateful I could
have cried. But they said that the
fire was across the street and they
weren't sure whether we would have
to leave or not. So I went up to their
apartment which faced the fire. An
other man came in and the four of
us decided not to evacuate until we
had to. We had no place to go, and
I could see now that the street was
filled with mobs — violent mobs,

smashing everything in sight and
carrying machetes, bayonets, rifles,
and revolvers.
So the danger became threefold—
the fire across the narrow one-way
street might blow our way; the mob
on the street might break in and
set fire to our building. If either of
these happened and we had to go out
on the street, we might be killed be
fore we had taken two steps. I
think this last frightened me more
than anything.
AT ANY RATE I could only sit
I there and watch dully as Grove took
down all the curtains and pushed
the furniture back into the middle of
the room. I stayed there all night,
; with my coats on and my camera
around my neck and underneath so
that 1 looked about eight months
I pregnant, and everyone who came
i along felt so sorry for me having to
go through all that in my "condi
tion." *•
I was so sick I didn't even bother
to explain. I clutched my money and
my pin and even when Grove finally
: sent Chris and me to lie down about
S 3 a.m., I wouldn't let go of it. But
how can you sleep when the fire
lights up the whole room. An elec
tric shop down the street caught on
and exploded for half an hour.
BUT EAR WORSE was the mob
in the street shouting "Viva la Co
lombia," while they smashed and
s set fire to everything in sight. Ev
! ery time they yelled, cold chills went
all over me.
Well, we lived through the night,
and on Saturday Bogota was already
the picture of devastation. The whole
I block across from us was burning,
and the smoke was so thick that we
! couldn't see much beyond. We found
that during the night our electricity
had gone oIT so I came down to my
apartment to cat a cold breakfast.
I WAS TOO TERRIFIED to stay
alone so I went back upstairs. The
i mob was still on the street looting
and I have never seen anything like
! it. They carried off radios, refriger
ators, sewing machines, food, cloth
; ing, furniture—it was unbelievable.
| About that time they broke into a
restaurant and bar directly below
us. so we had a good view of it all
from the window.
First they smashed the glass with
i various objects. One man wielded a

naked mannikin which was ex
tremely effective! Then they slashed
their way in with machetes. The
first thing that they carried off were
the bar stools. What possible use
they will have in an adobe hut is
beyond me. Next came the tables
and chairs, then dishes, silver, lin
ens, liquor, and finally a woman
struggled out with two huge kitchen
pots still filled with yesterday's to
mato soup!
AT THAT POINT the owner came
out with a pistol and started shoot
ing and that was the end of that.
Maybe you are surprised that I
mentioned a woman looting—there
were hundreds of them, and children
and old people — all dragging off
whatever they could handle.
Most of it was disgusting but some

of it amusing in a way. They looted
a bookstore. It was just around the
corner and everyone ran up our
street stopping just in front of us
to inspect the books they had taken.
They hadn't even bothered to look!
And, Patty, you could see that I bey
were all ignorant peasants and
couldn't read a word anyway. A
friend of our was standing down in
the doorway when a ragged man
went by with a thick red engineer
ing book.
Our friend stopped him and asked
him what he was going to do with it.
The boy clutched it to him and
cried, "It's mine! It's mine!" and
ran off. And that's the general at

(Editor's note: The following is a letter received by Pat Paterson
from Jeanne Sersanous Scott, now in Bogota, where her husband is work
ing for an oil company. Mrs. Scott attended Stanford 1944-1947.)
Dear Patty,
Yesterday I sent a cable home (for 14 pesos) saying "safe."
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hasty, for right now there is so
vnuch shooting in the streets that the noise is deafening.
I hardly pay any attention to it any more, which is proved by
the fact that last night I slept through half an hour of it while

Matilda was up pacing the floor. It
was the first thing I heard this
morning when I awoke.
IF THEY'RE SNIPING at the
building you certainly can't run out
on the street and into their arms.
So with this fatalistic view I just
turned over and went back to sleep.
No place I'd rather die than in my
own soft bed anyway.
I will try to go over for you the
Things that have happened here.
These past few days have been filled
with terror and horror and they will
be with me till I die. On Friday
when this all started I had decided
to spend the day in bed. I had been
to a cocktail party the night before,
and I was lying there surrounded by
magazines when Matilda brought
the news that Gaitan had been shot.
Pie was like Gandhi, she said, and
people were fighting in the streets.
I PUT IT DOWN to localized riot—
in:* and didn't think much about it.
But Matilda was quite uneasy and I
gave her permission to go clown
stairs again. About 20 minutes later
I began to hear shooting — so I
thought I would just turn on the
radio to see what was happening.
That was when I received my first
shock. A hoarse voice was crying
"Down with the Conservatives!" and
it was demanding the President's
resignation, threatening to shoot him
on sight, calling all men to arms,
telling them to break into the stores
ro get weapons—they wouldn't be
stealing, just defending themselves—
and crying, "Revolucion, revolu
tion!" Thus was born the revolu
tion.
I WAS STUNNED, but all it meant
to me at the time was that I'd prob
ably have to spend the weekend
locked in the apartment. I was still
thinking along those lines when Ma
tilda came running in to say that the
city was on fire.
Throwing a coat over my pajamas
I dashed up to the seventh floor to
see. Sure enough, there were half
a dozen fires scattered around. Ma
tilda pointed them out as the Con
servative newspaper building and
several government buildings.
I WAS SHOCKED more than any
thing—how could these people set
fire to their own city! I worried
because the buildings are old and
not at all substantial, and I was
afraid that the fire would spread.
We finished dinner when all of
a sudden everyone began running
and screaming in the halls. When
I threw open the door there was

smoke filtering up the steps. It was
then that I got that feeling of sick
terror which is still with me. I felt
