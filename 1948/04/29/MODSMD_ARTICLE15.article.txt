## More Late Leaves 
### 
Stanford women are capable of assuming more responsibility
in regulating their social life than they now have.
A revision of late leave regulations has been suggested which
is the first step toward greater freedom for all women. Oppo
nents of the plan feel there are some women who, given the
chance, will overestimate their ability to stay out and still keep
up their studies.
Those women are in the minority, and the majority of women
should not be restricted for the few. College is the transformation
period from a giggling high-school girl to an adult woman. Op
portunities to mature, to make decisions, and to exercise respon
sibility should be utilized.
The University has tightened up on scholarship regulations.
Any woman who goes on probation once now has only two more
chances to raise her average above minus 11. If the use of a
greater number of late leaves was the sole cause of her being
suspended, then she obviously would have placed more value
on going out than on studying. She would deserve to be sus
pended to make room for some woman who could learn how to
budget her time. The fault would lie with the individual and not
with the system.
The plan under consideration would allow seniors unlimited
2:3o's, juniors unlimited l:3o's, and sophomores 20 1:30 s. These
would apply to all women not totally minus. Everyone, minus or
not, would have two 2:3o's each week. One of those could be
used during the week.
There is some objection to allowing freshmen these two 2:3o's
each week. However, in 1940 freshmen had one 2:30 each week
plus five additional during the guarter. This plan calls for only
five more a guarter. Thus the new plan is only slightly more
"liberal" than the regulations that existed previously.
Sophomores and juniors now feel that when they use a pre
cious late leave they must utilize it to the very last second. With
more late leaves they could go out oftener for shorter periods of
time with a less damaging effect on their studies.
Men don't seem to have any trouble in regulating their time
and keeping up their grades, and the women s won t either if
given a chance. —M. H.
