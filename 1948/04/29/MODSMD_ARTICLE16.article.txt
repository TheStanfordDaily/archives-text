# CAMPUS OPINION
## The
						Off-Campus Hall

Tu the Editor:
■It seems to mc that the proper name was not given to our auditorium.
Instead of the Memorial Auditorium, it should be called the Off-Camptis
Students' Auditorium.
Take a look at the facts. Last year the Stanford Union made $43,000.
All of this money was used to pay the debt on the theater. Off-campus
students contribute about three-fourths of the Union's business. Thus
about $:)0.000 was contributed by off-campus students. That's $15 a person.
For one group of students to pay $15 a year toward the theater while the
rest of the students pay about $2. is about as fair as assessing each frater
nity $2,000 to build a new Women's Clubhouse.
How can we correct this?
There are two ways. (1) Wo can insist that the Union be n non-pi of it
organization. This would mean that prices would be lowered a great deal.
Or (2) if the Union is going to continue to make money, then let's spend
the profit in such a way as to benefit the people who have made that profit
possible. For instance, let's build a new Union. In this way the people
who use the Union the most, and who contribute the most to its income,
will receive the benefits.
