To the Editor:
Congratulations to the Administration for the magnificent job they did
in repaying Palm Drive. It is really unfortunate that a light breeze came
lip and blew the new "pavement" away immediately.
We will disregard the waste of money that these repairs caused, for,
alter all, this money merely came out of the tuition-payers' pockets. How
ever. we must voice strong objections to the waste of such enormous quan
tities of sand. We feel that this scarce and costly material could have
been applied much more beneficially in the construction of a big sandpile
in the middle of Quad in which the students and their professors could
plav between classes.
