Some organizations and individuals on campus
stage annual crusades for recognition, finances, or
improvement. Most of the groups are pretty per
sistent, but one club that has tried the hardest is the
Stanford Crew Association.
Ever since they came in a close second at the
1915 Poughkeepsie Regatta, Farm crewmen have

hoped that each succeeding year
would bring University recogni
tion to the team and subsequent
funds from the SAC budget.
On the Administration side of
the ledger, SAC funds have been
in hot water during the past two
years. Last year they placed in
the red, while this year the books
show a little black in the balance.
Football is the profit sport here,
and support for other athletic
events means a drain on football's
profits. This year a little profit

was made in basketball. Crew is a non-spectator
sport and thus has no spectator revenue.
But victorious crew teams do bring fame to a
school, and Stanford thrives on the prestige in its
name. A large percentage of the value of our sheep
skins will be the Stanford name. Any organization
or individual that can brighten that name is a
welcome one. Yet, somehow the Stanford Crew
Association has slipped by the nod of recognition and
support for over 30 years.
University of California maintains an elaborate
set-up for its crew team—elaborate to the tune of
$35,000 a year. Most of that huge sum pays for two
full-time coaches, maintains a Poughkeepsie boat
house for use once a year, and covers the Alameda
Estuary boathouse costs plus a caretaker's wages.
Much of tips sum could he cut by the co-operative
Farm crew because the boys maintain their own
equipment. With student coaches assisting, only one
full-time coach would have to be University-hired,
and maximum cost for crew would fall under $20,000
per year.
Director of Athletics A! Masters released a dis
couraging note for local crew enthusiasts 13 months
ago. He said:
"If we get additional funds it is my intention to
put more "B" and "C" teams into competition in
the various sports. By doing this we could benefit
more students athletically than we could in a sport
like rowing where only a small number compete."
Mr. Masters failed to take into consideration the
turn-out crew has had here at Stanford. Every week
day morning at 5:30 four shells with 36 men leave
the Palo Alto Yacht Club for an eight-mile practice
run. That is more men than three football teams.
Moreover, the Crew Association has enough reserves
to more than fill another shell. In addition, crew
captain Bob Setrakian had to turn away potential
crew members last autumn because the men were too
green and the association did not have facilities to
train them from the beginning.
As poor in resources as our Stanford crew is, it
struggles from year to year meeting Western op
ponents. The team expects to score wins over Ore
gon State, San Diego State, and USC. They hope for
an upset win over UCLA and a tight finish with the
Olympic hopefuls from the University of California—
all this on a $500 budget for the season.
Saturday the crew %i 11 take on UCLA at Los An
geles: the following Saturday we meet the hot Uni
versity of California crew. Maybe before another 30
years pass Stanford will have a Stanford crew team
representing the Farm rather than a Stanford Crew
Association representing another one of the Farm's
many on-campus clubs.

Association has slipped by the nod of recognition and
support for over 30 years.
University of California maintains an elaborate
set-up for its crew team—elaborate to the tune of
$35,000 a year. Most of that huge sum pays for two
full-time coaches, maintains a Poughkeepsie boat
house for use once a year, and covers the Alameda
Estuary boathouse costs plus a caretaker's wages.
Much of tips sum could he cut by the co-operative
Farm crew because the boys maintain their own
equipment. With student coaches assisting, only one
full-time coach would have to be University-hired,
and maximum cost for crew would fall under $20,000
per year.
Director of Athletics A! Masters released a dis
couraging note for local crew enthusiasts 13 months
ago. He said:
"If we get additional funds it is my intention to
put more "B" and "C" teams into competition in
the various sports. By doing this we could benefit
more students athletically than we could in a sport
like rowing where only a small number compete."
Mr. Masters failed to take into consideration the
turn-out crew has had here at Stanford. Every week
day morning at 5:30 four shells with 36 men leave
the Palo Alto Yacht Club for an eight-mile practice
run. That is more men than three football teams.
Moreover, the Crew Association has enough reserves
to more than fill another shell. In addition, crew
captain Bob Setrakian had to turn away potential
crew members last autumn because the men were too
green and the association did not have facilities to
train them from the beginning.
As poor in resources as our Stanford crew is, it
struggles from year to year meeting Western op
ponents. The team expects to score wins over Ore
gon State, San Diego State, and USC. They hope for
an upset win over UCLA and a tight finish with the
Olympic hopefuls from the University of California—
all this on a $500 budget for the season.
Saturday the crew %i 11 take on UCLA at Los An
geles: the following Saturday we meet the hot Uni
versity of California crew. Maybe before another 30
years pass Stanford will have a Stanford crew team
representing the Farm rather than a Stanford Crew
Association representing another one of the Farm's
many on-campus clubs.

Some organizations and individuals on campus
stage annual crusades for recognition, finances, or
improvement. Most of the groups are pretty per
sistent, but one club that has tried the hardest is the
Stanford Crew Association.
Ever since they came in a close second at the
1915 Poughkeepsie Regatta, Farm crewmen have

hoped that each succeeding year
would bring University recogni
tion to the team and subsequent
funds from the SAC budget.
On the Administration side of
the ledger, SAC funds have been
in hot water during the past two
years. Last year they placed in
the red, while this year the books
show a little black in the balance.
Football is the profit sport here,
and support for other athletic
events means a drain on football's
profits. This year a little profit

was made in basketball. Crew is a non-spectator
sport and thus has no spectator revenue.
But victorious crew teams do bring fame to a
school, and Stanford thrives on the prestige in its
name. A large percentage of the value of our sheep
skins will be the Stanford name. Any organization
or individual that can brighten that name is a
welcome one. Yet, somehow the Stanford Crew
Association has slipped by the nod of recognition and
support for over 30 years.
