To the Editor:
Campaign upon campaign has gone by without
the majority of the student body ever having known
who was running for office. Deplore if you will the
selection of a "git-tar" strumming politico as a run
off candidate for the office of president of the ASSU.
but at least those who voted for him were cognizant
of his appearance, a novel situation at Stanford.
The record-breaking 47 per cent turnout can be
traced directly to the campaign of this one individual.
For the first time in many a long Indian summer
the student body has interested itself in its own gov
ernment. Rather than criticize blindly, one must be
prepared to evaluate coldly the significance of the
"corn-pone" tactics so utilized. No longer will it Im
possible for one to run for political office at Stanford
on the basis of a well-executed pivot shot, off-tackle
smash, or societal standing. A candidate must now
sell himself.
To use the editorial columns to discriminate
against one of four candidates i* a shameful abuse of
the prerogatives of the freedom of campus press.
Instead of having requisitioned the space to lambaste
one candidate and his political electioneering, the
three inches could have been put to better use con
gratulating the students for their increased school
interest and record vote.

To the Editor:
Your Nice Nelly editorial condemning Frank Wolff
struck me as a prim old maid protesting against men
appearing on the beach in topless bathing suits. Back
in 1840. William Henry Harrison was elected to the
presidency of the United States on two platforms: a
log cabin and a jug of whisky. Although he died al
most immediately on taking office, my informants
tell me Mr. Wolff enjoys excellent health.
In traditional American politics, campaign bally
hoo does not in any way reflect on a candidate's es
sential stand on serious issues. Even Senator Taft has
appeared in Indian costume during an election year.
The so-called "circus" and "vaudeville" tactics to
which you refer have been legitimate means of bring
ing the name of a deserving candidate to the attention
of democratically minded voters.

To the Editor:
Regarding Friday's editorial, it appears that Stan
ford is truly participating in the Pappy O'Daniels
type of politics—"git-tar" playing candidates and
mud-slinging editorials.
It is the editor's opinion. "Apparently even at
college level, voters can't or don't vote intelligently."'
Just what is voting intelligently at Stanford Univer
sity? Is a 50-word article and a two-minute speech
by each aspirant sufficient for the voters to make a
wise choice? Perhaps the Stanford-Binet test should
be given to determine if the student is capable of vot
ing judiciously. Would our esteemed editor oblige
us by proposing a solution to our dilemma?

To the Editor:
Now that the big water-shortage scare is ofT, and
spring is here, why doesn't the Administration or
somebody get off the dime and turn on the various
fountains around campus? The fountains in front
of the Libe and the Union would add a lot of beauty
1o these respective institutions if they were allowed
to perform their allotted function. How about it?
This is not to be construed as an endorsement of
any political candidate, local or national.

To the Editor:
Your Nice Nelly editorial condemning Frank Wolff
struck me as a prim old maid protesting against men
appearing on the beach in topless bathing suits. Back
in 1840. William Henry Harrison was elected to the
presidency of the United States on two platforms: a
log cabin and a jug of whisky. Although he died al
most immediately on taking office, my informants
tell me Mr. Wolff enjoys excellent health.
In traditional American politics, campaign bally
hoo does not in any way reflect on a candidate's es
sential stand on serious issues. Even Senator Taft has
appeared in Indian costume during an election year.
The so-called "circus" and "vaudeville" tactics to
which you refer have been legitimate means of bring
ing the name of a deserving candidate to the attention
of democratically minded voters.

To the Editor:
Regarding Friday's editorial, it appears that Stan
ford is truly participating in the Pappy O'Daniels
type of politics—"git-tar" playing candidates and
mud-slinging editorials.
It is the editor's opinion. "Apparently even at
college level, voters can't or don't vote intelligently."'
Just what is voting intelligently at Stanford Univer
sity? Is a 50-word article and a two-minute speech
by each aspirant sufficient for the voters to make a
wise choice? Perhaps the Stanford-Binet test should
be given to determine if the student is capable of vot
ing judiciously. Would our esteemed editor oblige
us by proposing a solution to our dilemma?

To the Editor:
Now that the big water-shortage scare is ofT, and
spring is here, why doesn't the Administration or
somebody get off the dime and turn on the various
fountains around campus? The fountains in front
of the Libe and the Union would add a lot of beauty
1o these respective institutions if they were allowed
to perform their allotted function. How about it?
This is not to be construed as an endorsement of
any political candidate, local or national.

To the Editor:
Campaign upon campaign has gone by without
the majority of the student body ever having known
who was running for office. Deplore if you will the
selection of a "git-tar" strumming politico as a run
off candidate for the office of president of the ASSU.
but at least those who voted for him were cognizant
of his appearance, a novel situation at Stanford.
The record-breaking 47 per cent turnout can be
traced directly to the campaign of this one individual.
For the first time in many a long Indian summer
the student body has interested itself in its own gov
ernment. Rather than criticize blindly, one must be
prepared to evaluate coldly the significance of the
"corn-pone" tactics so utilized. No longer will it Im
possible for one to run for political office at Stanford
on the basis of a well-executed pivot shot, off-tackle
smash, or societal standing. A candidate must now
sell himself.
To use the editorial columns to discriminate
against one of four candidates i* a shameful abuse of
the prerogatives of the freedom of campus press.

one candidate and his political electioneering, the
