## Bull Session 
### 
(Editor's note: Kvcrv once in a while The Daily
receives a letter to the editor which we think is
more than just a letter. The following from Bob
Rigne.v we believe makes a good Bull Session.)
As the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Woodman, Ihe
Scarecrow, and Dorothy left the land of Oz, they
entered the wonderful state of Stanford. The Stan
fordites were deciding on a new president and all
over the land could be seen people flipping coins and
drawing straws as they intelligently decided 011 the
candidate of their choice.
"What arc the duties of this mighty president?"
growled the Cowardly Lion as he cornered a passing
student between his jaws.
After assuring himself that the Cowardly Lion
was not a California Bear in disguise, with iolty scorn
the student condescended to reply, "I don t know,
of course. Such details do not bother us who talk
in universal and have the free will to determine
our own predestination.' The fellow had just come
out of the Western Civ Libe and felt he must dissem
inate his own knowledge before he sank under its
weight.
"Well, are you going" to vote for the one with the
most courage?" roared the Cowardly Lion.
"Oh, dear me, no!" exclaimed the student as he
admired the symmetrical row of gashes that the lion's
teeth had torn in his flesh. (After all, one must get as
much beauty out of life as one can.) "The record
shows that the candidate does not need a strong back
bone if he has a firm handshake."
"Then you will vote for the one with the most
brains?" questioned the Scarecrow, anil he rubbed his
high forehead when' he saw everyone was looking.
The student, being polite, didn't laugh too loud

but merely said. "A quick tongue is more important
than a quick brain. He has no important political de
cisions to make and the record shows ASSU presi
dents are not noted for solving problems or originat
ing ideas."
"You're all wrong," interrupted the Tin Wood
man with a beatific smile on his face. "The man with
the kind heart should have the office.''
"What!" the others cried in unison. "You know no
politician has a heart in these days."
Dorothy, however, didn't say anything for she was
so dazzled by the three-to-one ratio that she thought
no such school could have a bad governor.
"Now." continued the student, who couldn't bear
to remain silent for two minutes after his intensive
class participation training in Western Civ. "I shall
vote for the man who shows the most imagination,
the truest sense of humor."
Astounded, the travelers from Oz marveled at the
innate intelligence which, though heavily disguised,
radiated from the Stanford student. "Of course.' said
the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion, "it takes
courage and brains to have imagination.
"And it takes a kind heart to have a truly great
sense of humor and to keep a man from being too
impressed with his own importance, finished the
Tin Woodman. "If the president does nothing but
keep up the ballyhoo required of his office, he will
be the best man. If he is a good president and tries
to do something important it will take imagination
and a sense of humor to put it over."
"There remains but one question," said Dorothy
as she tore herself away from her 3.2 man. "Why
would a man with any imagination want the office
in the first place?"

brains?" questioned the Scarecrow, anil he rubbed his
high forehead when' he saw everyone was looking.
The student, being polite, didn't laugh too loud

but merely said. "A quick tongue is more important
than a quick brain. He has no important political de
cisions to make and the record shows ASSU presi
dents are not noted for solving problems or originat
ing ideas."
"You're all wrong," interrupted the Tin Wood
man with a beatific smile on his face. "The man with
the kind heart should have the office.''
"What!" the others cried in unison. "You know no
politician has a heart in these days."
Dorothy, however, didn't say anything for she was
so dazzled by the three-to-one ratio that she thought
no such school could have a bad governor.
"Now." continued the student, who couldn't bear
to remain silent for two minutes after his intensive
class participation training in Western Civ. "I shall
vote for the man who shows the most imagination,
the truest sense of humor."
Astounded, the travelers from Oz marveled at the
innate intelligence which, though heavily disguised,
radiated from the Stanford student. "Of course.' said
the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion, "it takes
courage and brains to have imagination.
"And it takes a kind heart to have a truly great
sense of humor and to keep a man from being too
impressed with his own importance, finished the
Tin Woodman. "If the president does nothing but
keep up the ballyhoo required of his office, he will
be the best man. If he is a good president and tries
to do something important it will take imagination
and a sense of humor to put it over."
"There remains but one question," said Dorothy
as she tore herself away from her 3.2 man. "Why
would a man with any imagination want the office
in the first place?"

As the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Woodman, Ihe
Scarecrow, and Dorothy left the land of Oz, they
entered the wonderful state of Stanford. The Stan
fordites were deciding on a new president and all
over the land could be seen people flipping coins and
drawing straws as they intelligently decided 011 the
candidate of their choice.
"What arc the duties of this mighty president?"
growled the Cowardly Lion as he cornered a passing
student between his jaws.
After assuring himself that the Cowardly Lion
was not a California Bear in disguise, with iolty scorn
the student condescended to reply, "I don t know,
of course. Such details do not bother us who talk
in universal and have the free will to determine
our own predestination.' The fellow had just come
out of the Western Civ Libe and felt he must dissem
inate his own knowledge before he sank under its
weight.
"Well, are you going" to vote for the one with the
most courage?" roared the Cowardly Lion.
"Oh, dear me, no!" exclaimed the student as he
admired the symmetrical row of gashes that the lion's
teeth had torn in his flesh. (After all, one must get as
much beauty out of life as one can.) "The record
shows that the candidate does not need a strong back
bone if he has a firm handshake."
"Then you will vote for the one with the most
brains?" questioned the Scarecrow, anil he rubbed his
high forehead when' he saw everyone was looking.
The student, being polite, didn't laugh too loud

but merely said. "A quick tongue is more important
than a quick brain. He has no important political de
