# Lawyers Vie In Moot Court
## 
### 
Twelve law students will take part
in moot court semi-final competi
tions at Stanford today and tomor
row.
The four best "lawyers" will coin
pete in the finals next fall.
Winners in the current competi
tion will be selected on individual
ability without regard to the judg
ment of the case itself. Thus the
loser of his case may actually be
one of the four selected.
The three cases being tried, in
their order, will involve issues of:
1. A person alleged to have re
fused lo testify before the Thomas
Un-American Activities Committee
in Washington.
2. Rights of Japanese aliens.
3. The light of different nation
alities to sue in federal court.
