# Oarsmen To Meet Bruins
## 
### 
While the campus began to rub
the sleep out of its eyes this morn
ing, the Farm's three crews got in
their last practice licks on the calm
Bay waters.
This noon the 30 men of the var
sity, jayvee, and frosh boats, sub
stitutes, and coaches will start the
southward jaunt to the UCLA cam
pus to race the Bruin eights on Sat
urday afternon. The meet will be
the first of the year for the Card
oarsmen and the culmination of an
entire school year's preparation.
THE THREE BOATLOADS have
been working intensively since the
beginning of the quarter to get in
top condition for the grueling 2,000-
meter sprint race they will row at
Los Angeles. The first week of the
quarter the boats hit the water at 4
p.m. for two-hour afternoon work
outs.
Then as the winds got more both
ersome the coaches and 32 men in
the first four boats decided to turn
out at 5 o'clock in the morning to
take advantage of the calm water.
This morning's session climaxed
three and a half weeks of the early
practices with an inter-squad race.
THE PRACTICES were calculated
by Coach A. A. Clark to put his men
in the best shape for a short race.
The long eight-mile daily endurance
runs developed the lasting power
that provides the margin of victory
at the final dash.
The 40-stroke-per-minute racing
starts that the three boats have been
working for the past two weeks give
them the last getaway which puts
shells ahead at the outset, thus pro

viding the psychological boost of be
ing out in front.
Coach Clark's main emphasis of
the past week has been the check
ing, or loss of glide by improper
control of the oar and body on the
recovery of the blade for the next
stroke. ,
