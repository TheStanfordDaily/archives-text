# Stanford Golf Team Competes In Southland
## 
### MARSHALL NUNN 
Coach Eddie Twiggs and his Stanford golf team board the
noon Daylight today for Los Angeles, where they will meet
UCLA and USC over the weekend. The Indians will play the
Bruins in a dual match over the Bellaire Country Club course
tomorrow and will meet the Trojans Saturday over the Los An-

geles Country Club course.
Coach Twiggs will probably start
the same sextet that took a 20 to 7
decision from California last Satur
day with one change. Bill Lowe is
slated to take Ernie Kellberg's place
in the starting lineup'. The rest of
the lineup will remain the sameâ€”
Tom Lambie, Bob Rosburg, Bud
Moe, Bob Crozier, and Jack Shuler.
. TIIE DUAL MATCHES this week
end will be the fifth and sixth out
ings for the Redskins this season.
They won second place in the
Northern California
late in March, met and downed the
alumni on April 10, lost a close de
cision to San Jose on April 16, and
swamped the Cal Bears last week.
Tomorrow's match with UCLA
will probably be the toughest one
of the trip. The Bruins are defi
nitely loaded and will once again
boast the services of long-driving
I Bob Gardner. If Stanford can win
, over the Bruins tomorrow they will
i chalk up their third dual match
| victory of the season and their scc
; on PCC one.
The feature attraction of the UC
LA match will be the duel between
Tom Lambie, No. 1 Indian man, and
: Gardner. Lambie showed good form
; by downing the Bruin ace last last
year when Stanford rolled over UC
LA 20 1 j to here. If Lambie plays
j as well against the Bruins as he has
in competition so far this year, he
should take Gardner again. Last
week he shot a sizzling (>!) as his
teammates humbled Cal here.
LITTLE IS KNOWN about the
Trojan golf team that Stanford will
| meet Saturday. The Farm sextet
should win, however, on the basis of
: their improved showings this year
I and their 19 1 to win last season
| when the two teams clashed here.
All of Coach Twiggs' men are ap
proaching mid-season form. Show
ing especially good promise are Bud
; Moe. Bob Crozier, and Jack Shuler.
Shuler played on both the "4(J and
'47 teams that won high honors in
the v -- National Intercollegiates. At
first it was believed that he had
used up all his eligibility but he
| was recently declared eligible for
| competition.


COACII EDDIE TWIGGS takes
his Indian linksmen to Los An
geles this weekend for matches
with UCLA tomorrow and USC
Saturday. The Farm golfers, fresh
from a victory over Cal. will he
seeking their third dual match win
of the current season.
