## Daily Sports 
### BY BILL SWIGART 
The swimming spotlight will focus on the Southland this week
end as Coach Tom Haynie leads his power-laden Stanford varsity
against the USC Trojans and the UCLA Bruins. The Troy meet
is slated lor tomorrow afternoon and the Uclan encounter for
Saturday morning.
Although the Cards will be top-heavy favorites against both
opponents, considerable interest will
surround the meets.

IN THE I IKST PLACE, the In
dians are expected to make an all
out attempt on several conference
records in UCLA's fast 20-yard
varsity pool, and secondly the out
comes of the individual events will
determine the favorites in the com
ing conference championships.
Stanford's powerful team of last
season erased nearly every 20-yard
pool mark in the conference, setting
many of the new marks so low that
they should defy the efforts of PCC
performers for years to come.
However, a few records remain
within the grasp of the current In
dian performers. Pete Powlison's
record of 2:12.5 for the 220-yard
freestyle should go to Fialph Sala.
SALA'S TIME HAS been down
around the 2:13 figure in recent
weeks, and he is capable of hitting
well under tiiat figure in UCLA's
short, fast pool.
Other marks that might fall to the
Indians are Ted Wiget's quarter
mile record of 4:51.2, Bob Ander
son's own record in the 60-yard
sprint, and Stanford's freestyle relay
mark.


INDIAN SWIMMERS Warren Cutting. Dick Narver. Bob Anderson, and
Woody Hoogs will be out to break the 440-yard relay team mark iet
last year by a Stanford foursome when Coaches Ernie Brandsten and
Tom Haynie take the Farm squad to Los Angeles for meets with L'SC
and UCLA.
