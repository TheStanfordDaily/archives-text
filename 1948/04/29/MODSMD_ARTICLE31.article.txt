# Giants, Tribe Lead Majors
## 
### 
With the major leagues entering
the second week of the season, seme
ol the pre-season favorites are find- j
ing themselves in embarrassing posi
lions at the tail end of the league.
Detroit and Boston, two first di
vision selections in the American
League, are resting uncomfortably
in sixth and seventh places as their
pitching has been weak. The Yan- :
kees, co-favorites with the Red Sox
to win the pennant, also had tough
going to keep above the .500 mark, j
However, the Bombers took two out
of three in their first series with
Boston.
THE SURPRISING Cleveland In
dians, paced by Bob Feller's two
wins, are unbeaten at the top of
the junior league standings. The St.
Louis Browns have scrambled up to
second on good hitting alone.
In the National League the pow
erful New York Giants are leading
the field as a result of a six-game :
winning streak. The Giants have
come up with a "rookie-of-the-year"
candidate in Sheldon "Available"
Jones.
Jones has given the New Yorkers
the pitching they need so badly by
winning his first two starts. Oldsters
Dave Koslo and Ray Poat have also
shown well to give ace Larry Jensen
some support.
WHILE THE GIANTS were rising
to the top, the other first division j
choices were running into trouble.
The Boston Braves are floundering
in the cellar as the Beantown hit- !
ters were having difficulty getting
started.
The Brooklyn Dodgers were hav
ing organizational troubles as Lippy !
Durocher strove to find his best j
lineup from a squad of veterans and
rookies. Jackie Robinson has been i
having trouble getting into condi
tion and second base is not yet set
tled. m
