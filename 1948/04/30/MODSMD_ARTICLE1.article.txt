# Track Team All Primed For Bruins
## Close Meet Seen; Uclans Due Today 
### 
Fresh from their excellent
showing against USC last Sat
urday, the Stanford varsity
tracksters will clash with the
UCLA Bruins tomorrow at 1:45
in Stanford Stadium, weather per
mitting.
The rain in the past two days has
thoroughly soaked the Stadium
track, but if there is no further
rain, the meet probably will be held.
The UCLA squad is scheduled to
leave Los Angeles on today's noon
Daylight.
THE BRUINS created a mild sur
prise two weeks ago when they
tripped the California Bears. 71 to
t3O. on UCLA's track. Coach Ducky
Drake's cindermen turned in some
good times against the Bears, as
well as grabbing nine first places.
Veteran Craig Dixon registered a
triple victory, winning the 100-yard
dash in addition to his usual hurdle
victories. He ran the century in 9.8
seconds and is favored to repeat his
win against the Indians.
ALTHOUGH HATED one of the
best hurdlers in the country. Dixon
may have some trouble in garnering
wins in both races. Downing McKee
ran a 14.3 in the highs against the
Olympic Club two weeks ago with
Darrell Kreitz and Skip Kent right
behind him. These men placed one.
two. and three in the Trojan battle.
In the lows, triple-event star Gay
Bryan Hashed to his third straight
victory in this race by beating Troy's
high-regarded Ron Frazier by a con
siderable margin. However. Bruin
ace Dixon did 23.1 last week.
It will be a battle of the captains
tomorrow in the half-mile with
George Grimes of the Indians and
Frank Fletcher of the 3ruins as the
top men in this event. Al Hoiubar
probably will take the third posi
tion.
LARRY HOFF will really have to
ramble to beat UCLA's Al Kapp in
the quarter.
Against the Bears. Kapp was
clocked in the regular 440. and a
48.7 second effort in the relay. HotT
will be fully recovered front the leg
injury which has been bothering
him since the beginning of the sea
son. Pitch Johnson and A 1 Wilkins
will give the relay added punch, as
well as competing in the quarter
mile.
In the distances. UCLA has the
definite edge. A 1 Lyons and Jose
Rael will be fighting for those all
important points that may decide
the meet. Both did a creditable job
against the Trojan distance aces.
IN' THE WEIGHTS. Ctis Chandler
and much-improved Steve McKee
wil have some mighty good compe
tition from Jerry Shipkey and Tay
lor Lewis of the Bruins. Shipkey
has thrown 53 feet in the shot,
while Lewis tosses the platter around
15 feet. Shipkey will also be pitted
against Stanford's Bud Held in the
javelin.
George Stanieh, who high jumped
6 ft. C in. against Cal, and Dave
Minor, a 23-foot broad jumper, will
be a troublesome duo for Card Ga\
Bryan. Bill Larson is far above the
field in the pole vault.

Drake's cindermen turned in some
good times against the Bears, as
well as grabbing nine first places.
Veteran Craig Dixon registered a
triple victory, winning the 100-yard
dash in addition to his usual hurdle
victories. He ran the century in 9.8
seconds and is favored to repeat his
win against the Indians.
ALTHOUGH HATED one of the
best hurdlers in the country. Dixon
may have some trouble in garnering
wins in both races. Downing McKee
ran a 14.3 in the highs against the
Olympic Club two weeks ago with
Darrell Kreitz and Skip Kent right
behind him. These men placed one.
two. and three in the Trojan battle.
In the lows, triple-event star Gay
Bryan Hashed to his third straight
victory in this race by beating Troy's
high-regarded Ron Frazier by a con
siderable margin. However. Bruin
ace Dixon did 23.1 last week.
It will be a battle of the captains
tomorrow in the half-mile with
George Grimes of the Indians and
Frank Fletcher of the 3ruins as the
top men in this event. Al Hoiubar
probably will take the third posi
tion.
LARRY HOFF will really have to
ramble to beat UCLA's Al Kapp in
the quarter.
Against the Bears. Kapp was
clocked in the regular 440. and a
48.7 second effort in the relay. HotT
will be fully recovered front the leg
injury which has been bothering
him since the beginning of the sea
son. Pitch Johnson and A 1 Wilkins
will give the relay added punch, as
well as competing in the quarter
mile.
In the distances. UCLA has the
definite edge. A 1 Lyons and Jose
Rael will be fighting for those all
important points that may decide
the meet. Both did a creditable job
against the Trojan distance aces.
IN' THE WEIGHTS. Ctis Chandler
and much-improved Steve McKee
wil have some mighty good compe
tition from Jerry Shipkey and Tay
lor Lewis of the Bruins. Shipkey
has thrown 53 feet in the shot,
while Lewis tosses the platter around
15 feet. Shipkey will also be pitted
against Stanford's Bud Held in the
javelin.
George Stanieh, who high jumped
6 ft. C in. against Cal, and Dave
Minor, a 23-foot broad jumper, will
be a troublesome duo for Card Ga\
Bryan. Bill Larson is far above the
field in the pole vault.
Fresh from their excellent
showing against USC last Sat
urday, the Stanford varsity
tracksters will clash with the
UCLA Bruins tomorrow at 1:45
in Stanford Stadium, weather per
mitting.
The rain in the past two days has
thoroughly soaked the Stadium
track, but if there is no further
rain, the meet probably will be held.
The UCLA squad is scheduled to
leave Los Angeles on today's noon
Daylight.
THE BRUINS created a mild sur
prise two weeks ago when they
tripped the California Bears. 71 to
t3O. on UCLA's track. Coach Ducky
Drake's cindermen turned in some
good times against the Bears, as
well as grabbing nine first places.
