Give a man some peanuts to
shuck;
Give a man a fire for the shells,
And the flaming glow flitting to
and fro—
All worry and care dispells.
Give a man a juicy steak
Cooked to a taste-tempting "T,"
A Lucullan repast, quite unsur
passed.
And he'll eat like a dining
grandee.
Give a man such pleasures as
these,
And then he will really live.
Oh, and one thing yet . . . don't
forget—
I'M the one to whom you should
give!!!
—E. C. Keller

In contests I've participated,
But a prire I have never rated.
I've sent in boxtops by the doz
ens.
My own and filched from friends
and cousins;
There's so much stuff in my fair
house
You'd think I'd live inside a ware
house.
Perhaps before I close life's eyes
I may yet win a contest prise
(I met a winner once, named
Sonia,
A native girl, in Patagonia.)
