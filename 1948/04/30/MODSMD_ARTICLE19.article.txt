# Draft Plan Gets Okay By Truman
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 29 (UP) —
President Truman agreed reluctant
ly today to accept a compromise plan
that would combine the draft and
universal military training.
He told a press conference that
the compromise, which his top de
fense aides proposed to the Senate
Armed Services Committee earlier
this week, isn't what he wants. But
he said it seems to be all he can
get from Congress and that it is at
least a step in the right direction.
The plan calls for induction of
ItU.OOO youths between IS and ID 1 !*
years of age for one year of regu
lar military training in the United
States. Another 190,000. IS 1 ' through
25. would be drafted for regular
duty, including overseas service.
The Senate committee is expected
to approve it next week, but the
House Armed Services Committee is
against it. The House group wants
an outright 19-through-25 draft with
a definite termination date, after
which UMT would become effective.
