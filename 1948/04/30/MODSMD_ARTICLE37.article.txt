To the Editor:
Due to several "automotive close-shaves' in as many days, it has
occurred to me that an apt subject for research would be to determine
what correlation (if any) exists between the"I. Q. of a Stanford Rough
and his on-campus driving habits. In all probability it would be a nega
tive correlation since the caliber of the driving points in that direction.
Surely it isn't too much to expect that any student at Stanford should
rxhibit at least a modicum of good manners and intelligence in his
driving about the campus.
As for the time involved in making proper signals, driving to an inter
section for turning around (instead of the middle of the block) —well,
figure it out for yourself in terms of crushed fenders, locked bumpers,
burnt rubber, etc.
It would seem that Stanford "Roughs" could begin any day now to
exercise their intelligence "at the wheel' as well as in the class
room.
