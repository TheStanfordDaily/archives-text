To the Editor:
The Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard are one of the really
fine things of the Stanford tradition. While it is regrettable that the same
high standards which make possible their operation on campus do not
always prevail out in the business and political worlds, we should not be
discouraged by this fact. We should rather remember that it is what we
are and what we stand for which are really important, rather than how
much we get.
When we leave this institution we should carry with us these same high
ideals and try perhaps to raise the ethical standards of the activities in
which we engage. That our material reward will perhaps not be as great
us if we were to "play the game as tlie game is played" should in no way
deter us. A few less dollars is indeed a small price to pay for the knowl
edge that we are doing our bit to uphold the noble ideals which are re
flected in our Honor Code and our Fundamental Standard.
