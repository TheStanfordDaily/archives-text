# CAMPUS OPINION
## Partisan Politics 
### 
To to Editor:
Student views on political freedom have been well
presented in The Daily. We should now ask what
arguments will hold water with the Board' of
Trustees.
The main concern of the Botud seems to be to pre
vent the connection of the University's name with
any partisan views. But is the prohibition of campus
groups the best way to protect a non-partisan repu
tation?
In previous election years Stanford students have
formed political groups on campus. Now they must
meet in Palo Alto, but this has not detelred political
activity. First it was PCA, then "Students for Wal
lace," and now we hear rumors of "Citizens for
Stassen." Some incident such as the disruption of
the Wallace meeting will inevitably get in the papers.
The recent publicity given to communist activity
in olf-campus groups at UCLA indicates that such
groups are likely to become irresponsible. In contrast
the granting of campus privileges would seem likely
to deter political groups from irresponsible actions
and consequent loss of charters.
SDA strongly urges the election of a student gov
ernment which will present the best possible case for
political freedom. PRESTON C. BURCHARD
