To the Editor:
I. too, would criticize the Administration's view
of partisan political activity among its students.
Such has not always been the case. In its issue of
March 13, 1928. The Stanford Daily carried a story
which began, "In an endeavor to enlist the active sup
port of college men and women for Herbert Hoover
in the coming presidential election, a Stanford Hoover
Club has been organized here by student leaders. A
wide-spread and definitely organized endorsement of
Hoover among college students throughout the coun
try should exert considerable influence in his favor
through newspaper and magazine publication. . .
An editorial, in the same issue, supports the con
tention. Again, in The Daily of October 3, 1932. this
story appeared: "Plans are now being formulated
for organization of a "Hoover for President" club
on the campus and within two or three days a com
mittee of students will open its office to give out
political information to the students. . . . The Repub
lican group will bring political speakers to the cam
pus, give information regarding absentee balloting
and other election procedure. . . ."
The New York Times of November 7, 1928, car
ried a story which said: "The first public utterance of
President-elect Herbert Hoover was a greeting of
appreciation to the students of Stanford University,
who gathered around his home to celebrate his vic
tory." The San Francisco Chronicle of thaL date told
more in its story of an undoubtedly sincere mani
festation on the part of Stanford students toward
one who is a loyal friend to this University. Later
years say the existence of a "Roosevelt for President"
club and in the 19305, Norman Thomas, the Socialist
candidate, spoke on campus.
Heretofore, quite obviously, Stanford students, fac
ulty, and administration alike participated freely in
political activity, and rightly so. It is the right of
everyone to display his interest in politics both indi
vidually and in an organized fashion, else the well
informed individual who votes wisely would soon be
extinct. It is the place of a university, which as an
educator, sets out to develop and cultivate the stu
dent mentally and morally, to encourage an activity
which mears so directly as does free political ex
change on the individual and common future of us
all, for it is still a truth that this democracy is only as
good as its vote. Our Administration has encouraged
partisan political activity, on the one hand, while
restricting it to off-campus areas on the other. This
is not encouragement.
I suspect that unfortunately the Administration has
been swayed by the prevailing winds of fear whose
origins lie in Washington and Sacramento, wherein
the investigation, the loyalty check, and the blacklist
of organizations and people whose opinions are even
faintly left of center has become commonplace of
late. Liberal activity has become bad odor. That the
administration of a university should adopt such a
view, if true, is understandable, but it is nonethe
les blameworthy. These halls above all must be kept
free from fear." JOSEPH H. YOUNG
