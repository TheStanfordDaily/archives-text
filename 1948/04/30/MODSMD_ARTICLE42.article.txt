## History 1948 
### 
Whether (he Peron government in Argentina is
preparing to abate its policy of charging exorbitant
prices for the surplus grains so desperately needed
by the hungry world seems a little uncertain.
Last month it sold the United States three ship
loads of com at a price about a dollar a bushel above

the prevalent rate in this country,
and since this includes delivery at
the Buenous Aires docks, it is
thought to be fairly reasonable. In
the future, our negotiators were
assured, we could buy at the
''world price," provided we would
sell Argentina oil and fuel at what
Senor Peron considered a fair rate.
Possibly we are arriving at a
workable economic understanding
and possibly we are not.

But whatever may be his ex
ternal policies Senor Peron is still following internal
policies strongly reminiscent of Mussolini's Italy and
in some respects similar to those of Franco's Spain:
A few months ago he received the degree of "Doctor
Honoris Causa" from six of the national universities
which he last year took under his control. His way
of earning this distinction was indicated in a speech
the day before the degrees were bestowed upon him.
He was aware, he said, of "the forces of evil
that work in the cultural field." To overcome these
forces, he said, "we have disciplined ourselves a lit
tle." The disciplining will be done by a new "cul
turual agency," probably under a secretariat of edu
cation. Academic freedom in Argentina has been in
jeopardy ever since Peron took office. Its propects
will not be improved when Peron's "forces of good"
are officially organized.
None of us can really extend our distaste for Peron
to his corn and wheat. If Argentina will sell at a
reasonable price we will have to buy, and if she will
buy, at a reasonable price, goods we can spare, we
will have to sell.
But, and this is an important but, for I believe all
Americans should keep this one last thought in their
minds, and that is that these business transactions
between Argentina and the United States need not
carry with them the moral approval of Peron's cold
blooded campaign to root out the remnant of Ar
gentine democracy.
