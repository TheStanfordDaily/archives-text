Lire Begins at 65
SAN FRANCISCO (UP)â€”The president of the
American Medical Association recently attacked so
cial security retirement at the age of 65 as a "per
nicious program" which might "kill off" the nation's
older population.
Dr. Edward L. Bortz said existing and planned re
tirement programs "put many valuable members of
society on the shelf" at the height of their health and
vigor, ignoring the fact that great medical advances
in the last century have lengthened the average
American life span by 30 years.
He declared many people taken off their jobs in
their 60s die within a few years because of their
lack of activities in interests.
"If people retire out of life," Bortz said, "life will
retire out of the people."
Bortz, who is 52, suggested that social security pro
grams be based on voluntary retirement "not at a
particular age but at a time when people can no
longer help themselves."
"There is no need for our older people to become
charges of society before their period of productivity
is ended," he added.
"People these days retain their vitality and vigor
lonoger. It isn't necessarily the longer period of
their life, but the greater quality of it for a longer
period."
He said medical science had opened a new era in
the last century by lengthening human life "almost
unbelievably."
