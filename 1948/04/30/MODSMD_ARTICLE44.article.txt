Once in a very great while the Hollywood puppet -
masters who pull the strings in the movie capital
momentarily forget alxiut their five-million dollar
film biographies and their stcotyped musical sex
travaganzas long enough to produce a wholesome film
that actually comes close to being worth the price of
admission.
The cause for this sudden declaration that there
may yet be hope for the movie industry is, of course,
that gay flick, "Sitting Pretty," which has been
garcing the local screens for the past week or so.
Produced by 20th Century-Fox. "Sitting Pretty"
reminds us very much of "Miracle on 34th Street,"
which came frin the same studio last year. Both
were low-budget films, costing less than a million
scooties to make. And both were strictly the acting
property of the respective supporting actors. As did
Edmud Gwenn in "34th Street." Cilfton Webb rises
above the mediocritiy of the two principals—Robert
Young and Maureen O'Hara. in this case—and turns
"Sitting Pretty" into an extremely enjoyable eve
ning. See it if you can: it's worth the effort.
Speaking of 20th Century-Fox, we're reminded of

the remark made by Rene Clair, the famed French
motion picture director who recently folded his tent
and silently slipped away from the Fox lot. Clair,
whose directorial efforts on the American screen had
gone over with a distinct hush, was moved to proclaim
upon his departure that "he had thoroughly enjoyed
the privilege of associating with such an up-to-date
company as '19th Century-Fox'."
As long as this piece has turned out to be a dis
sertation on the movies, we feel it is our duty to
caution you not to waste your hard-earned vet
erans' checks on C. B. DeMille's latest contributi<6i
to the retarding of the entertainment world, "The
Un-corn-quered," which is showing locally. (Sample
of the love-affair dialogue: "Let's not fight this thing;
it's bigger than both of us.") Need we say more?
And finally, we mustn't overlook the fact that Lana
Turner has ust become a blushing (sic) bride for the
fourth time. When someone has been to the altar
as many times as Johnny Longden has been in the
winner's circle, we find it easy to think of several
reasons why she should be a blushing bride.

Once in a very great while the Hollywood puppet -
masters who pull the strings in the movie capital
momentarily forget alxiut their five-million dollar
film biographies and their stcotyped musical sex
travaganzas long enough to produce a wholesome film
that actually comes close to being worth the price of
admission.
The cause for this sudden declaration that there
may yet be hope for the movie industry is, of course,
that gay flick, "Sitting Pretty," which has been
garcing the local screens for the past week or so.
Produced by 20th Century-Fox. "Sitting Pretty"
reminds us very much of "Miracle on 34th Street,"
which came frin the same studio last year. Both
were low-budget films, costing less than a million
scooties to make. And both were strictly the acting
property of the respective supporting actors. As did
Edmud Gwenn in "34th Street." Cilfton Webb rises
above the mediocritiy of the two principals—Robert
Young and Maureen O'Hara. in this case—and turns
"Sitting Pretty" into an extremely enjoyable eve
ning. See it if you can: it's worth the effort.
Speaking of 20th Century-Fox, we're reminded of

the remark made by Rene Clair, the famed French
motion picture director who recently folded his tent
and silently slipped away from the Fox lot. Clair,
whose directorial efforts on the American screen had
gone over with a distinct hush, was moved to proclaim
upon his departure that "he had thoroughly enjoyed
the privilege of associating with such an up-to-date
company as '19th Century-Fox'."
