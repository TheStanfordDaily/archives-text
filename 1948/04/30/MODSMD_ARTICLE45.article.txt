# Letter Tells of Bogota Chaos and Revolution
## Alumnus Describes Street Fightine, Razing of Buildings, Shop Looting 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is the second and final installment of a
letter received by Pat Paterson from Jeanne Sersanous Scott, now in
Bogota, where her husband is working for an oil company.)
On Saturday we were still in danger of fire because the wind
was changing. But the day passed and nothing happened. So
we just sat at the window and watched the shooting and looting.
At this time the city was wide open to everything. No police,
army, or fire department could be found. We could hardly be
lieve it. '

All in all it was fairly quiet. I |
guess the mob had worn itself out. I
Nevertheless, as we sat in the dark
in the evening we watched four
fresh fires start up. One was a mon
astery and another a hotel. I finally j
took my candle and came down to |
bed. I made myself do it although I :
could have spent the night upstairs, i
ON SUNDAY I found that my
milk was sour, and I couldn't eat j
my cold cereal. We still had no J
electricity. So the Bloods gave me
breakfast which they cooked in their j
fireplace. Things looked pretty quiet, |
although fires were still smoldering j
and walls falling in. We had seen >
policemen on the street. It looked !
like a fairly good sign, so we ven
tured outside to stand for a breath
of fresh air.
No sooner had we appeared than
three men rushed at us with bayo
nets! We certainly came indoors in
a hurry.
It seems they were the state mi
litia and didn't want anyone on the
streets. Who were we to argue? We
passed the day quietly inside, and
Sunday night I had my first good
night's sleep.
ON MONDAY a meeting was .
called for all the men in the build
ing. They were informed that there
were snipers on. the roofs of the
buildings and we were all to stay
indoors away from the windows.
They also made plans for the de
fense of the building if necessary.
In the streets there was much i
shooting. Police and army men were
running around shooting into the
air to scare people off the streets.
It worked!
Al 2 p.m. martial law went into
effect and everyone found on the
street alter that time was to be
shot on sight. There was a lot of
shooting that afternoon. People ran
around with their hands up. At first
we jumped every time we heard
a shot and ran to the window, but
now we are accustomed to it and
hardly pay any attention any more.
ON TUESDAY' Mary and Bob
Bob came by and we went down
to send cables. I was pretty uneasy
because of all that had been going
on. But we made the trip safely.
Oh, it was horrible, though! Bogota
is completely ruined. It's really
heartbreaking to see old buildings
nothing but a pile of ashes. His
torical churches are gone and some
had been here since lfiOO. Nothing
was spared. What hasn't been burned
has been wrecked and looted.
TODAY SEVERAL BATTLES oc
curred on our corner between snip

ers and the army. The snipers were
up on a roof and the soldiers on
the street. One or two bullets hit
our building. The noise is deafening
but I don't think we are in any
danger. The Angels have been won
derful. They live here and it's their
lives, too, but they have given us
such a feeling of protection.
Every night they place men at the
door with rifles. This afternoon
milk was sold in the buildingâ€”after
Matilde risked her life to get me
three quarts this morning!
1 WILL CERTAINLY hand it to
our muchachas. They have been so
loyal. Friday night Matilde's one
thought was that I was alone. She
was so worried about me. I'm sure
they all thought it was the end of
the world, but they only said over
and over "Una cosa tan horrible,"
which has now changed to "Santi
sima Virgen!"
I sent Matilde home to see if her
family was all right as soon as pos
sible. She returned the next day
after walking three hours to stay
here with me in the apartment. She
braves the firing to go out to buy
what little she can for me to eat.
There's very little here left to eat
but she is determined to find what
she can for me.
I KNOW SHE is as nervous about
being out as I am, but I have to
command her to stay in. Then she
usually sneaks somehow to buy
just one more thing she thinks we
might need.
I THINK GROVE said that about
40 buildings would be able to be
repaired and that (500 are gone for
ever. The figure seems high but then
you should see the city! It will take
years to rebuild it. The monuments
of historical significance can never
be again. The beautiful palace which
they had furnished so beautifully
for the conference is completely
wrecked.
GROVE lIEARU that a railway
bridge connecting Bogota to the in
terior is gone. If so, we are isolated,
except for air. It would take two
or three years to rebuild the bridge.
But that may be rumor. We hear so
many things and we never know.
Please write. But don't you dare
say how exciting to have been in a
revolution. It is really more of a
riot according to a course I took
once from LaPiere. It's really been
pretty grim and so far I haven't
found a thing to get excited about.
It isn't over yet.
Love,
SERS
