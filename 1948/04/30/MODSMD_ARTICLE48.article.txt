# Farm Players' 'Dear Brutus' Fails to Inspire Reviewer
## 
### 
The Stanford Players' production
of "Dear Brutus" opened last night
in the Memorial Auditorium. It did
n't make the grade.
The audience received the first
act with substantial applause, but
that's where it ended. When the play
was over the audience response died
a slow death. And this crowd of
play-goers was just as potentially
enthusiastic as those who received
"Richard III," "Winterset," "Cyr
ano," and"The Miser" with great
praise.
We don't think it was the indi
vidual acting; it was good, and some
of it was very good. David Hawes
was superb in Poole's "Oh Foolish
Love," and his performance last
night was just as good. Walt Whit
cover's portrayal was very impres
sive, as was Richard Hawkins'.
Ann Guilbert carried her difficult
little-girl role in a wholly charming
manner, and Kathryn Manfrin was
excellent in every respect. For that
matter, the entire cast, as individ
uals, were more than competent. A.
Nicholas Vardac, Frances Waller,
Ruth Fisher, Nancy De Groot. Ra'.ph
McCormic, Elaine Maltzman ... all
were good.
But "Dear Brutus" requires more
than individual acting ability. En
semble playing is the keynote, more
so than in any other recent Players'
production. There are no outstand
ing. leading roles. Earrie's play can
be bright and engrossing, despite a

thread of cynicism and disillusion
ment. It wasn't. It dragged and
staggered because the players' por
trayals didn't fit together.
The result was an unwieldy,
ragged presentation. That flimsy
web that binds an audience to the
players was stretched too far early
in the second act. It broke, it was
an awfully flimsy web from the
beginning. Better directing might
have strengthened it. If it had been
presented in the Little Theater to
a smaller audience and with better
acoustics the web might have been
strong enough.
Wendell Cole's sets were very im
pressive, and costuming and lighting
was capably handled. —Little
