# Yanks Dump Senators; Dodgers Win, 17 to 7
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 29 (UP).—
Cleveland hasn't got a Broadway
hit like "Mr. Roberts" to intrigue
its citizens, hut for the time being,
anyway, their Mr. Roberts—Lemon
and Feller—were doing a fine job of
stirring up the baseball populace.
Today. Lemon pitched the Indians
to their sixth straight victory, 5 to 2
over the St. Louis Browns, leaving
them as the only club in either
league still without defeat. It was
his second victory and it was well
earned, lie scattered eight hits, gave
up only one walk, and struck out
four to pull up even with Feller,
who won his second game last Sai
urday, and who goes out after num
ber three tomorrow.
THE Y ANKEES won their fourth
straight, topping the Senators- at
New York. 5 to 4 in the 10th when
Joe DiMaggio's long fly with the
bases loaded sent Bobby Brown
across with the winning run.
As usual. Joe Page, the master re
lief artist, had to come on to help
a faltering starter and his four hit -
less innings gained him the victory.
The Red Sox, getting four homers,
each with a man on base, didn't need
any more offensive help in their 11
to 5 victory over the Athletics at
Philadelphia. Sam Mele, Joe Dob
son, Ted Williams, and Murrell
(Jake) Jones got the round-trippers.
Dobson, an 18 - game winner last
year, gained his first triumph.
THE Ki:i)S HAD TO (JO 14 in
nings and then cash in a homer by
rookie Hank Sauer to defeat the St.
Louis Cardinals. 5 to 4, at Cincin
nati. It was Salter's fifth homer of
the season, putting him in a tie with
Ken Keltner of the Indians for the
major league lead.
Elmer Riddle, who apparently has
licked the arm trouble that plagued
him for four years, scored his sec

ond impressive pitching triumph, a
seven-hit. 4 to 2 decision for the Pi
rates over the Cubs at Chicago.
Frankie Gustine led the 10-hit at
tack for Pittsburgh with a double
and two singles.
The Dodgers got bat happy, put
ting on a 20-hit display that in
cluded terrific homers by rookie
Preston Ward and oldster Pete Rei
ser in a 17 to 7 victory over the
Giants. The victory ended a six
game Giant winning streak and a
three-game Dodger losing skein.

NEW YORK. April 29 (UP).—
Cleveland hasn't got a Broadway
hit like "Mr. Roberts" to intrigue
its citizens, hut for the time being,
anyway, their Mr. Roberts—Lemon
and Feller—were doing a fine job of
stirring up the baseball populace.
Today. Lemon pitched the Indians
to their sixth straight victory, 5 to 2
over the St. Louis Browns, leaving
them as the only club in either
league still without defeat. It was
his second victory and it was well
earned, lie scattered eight hits, gave
up only one walk, and struck out
four to pull up even with Feller,
who won his second game last Sai
urday, and who goes out after num
ber three tomorrow.
THE Y ANKEES won their fourth
straight, topping the Senators- at
New York. 5 to 4 in the 10th when
Joe DiMaggio's long fly with the
bases loaded sent Bobby Brown
across with the winning run.
As usual. Joe Page, the master re
lief artist, had to come on to help
a faltering starter and his four hit -
less innings gained him the victory.
The Red Sox, getting four homers,
each with a man on base, didn't need
any more offensive help in their 11
to 5 victory over the Athletics at
Philadelphia. Sam Mele, Joe Dob
son, Ted Williams, and Murrell
(Jake) Jones got the round-trippers.
Dobson, an 18 - game winner last
year, gained his first triumph.
THE Ki:i)S HAD TO (JO 14 in
nings and then cash in a homer by
rookie Hank Sauer to defeat the St.
Louis Cardinals. 5 to 4, at Cincin
nati. It was Salter's fifth homer of
the season, putting him in a tie with
Ken Keltner of the Indians for the
major league lead.
Elmer Riddle, who apparently has
licked the arm trouble that plagued
him for four years, scored his sec

ond impressive pitching triumph, a
seven-hit. 4 to 2 decision for the Pi
rates over the Cubs at Chicago.
Frankie Gustine led the 10-hit at
tack for Pittsburgh with a double
and two singles.
The Dodgers got bat happy, put
ting on a 20-hit display that in
cluded terrific homers by rookie
Preston Ward and oldster Pete Rei
ser in a 17 to 7 victory over the
Giants. The victory ended a six
game Giant winning streak and a
three-game Dodger losing skein.

NEW YORK. April 29 (UP).—
Cleveland hasn't got a Broadway
hit like "Mr. Roberts" to intrigue
its citizens, hut for the time being,
anyway, their Mr. Roberts—Lemon
and Feller—were doing a fine job of
stirring up the baseball populace.
Today. Lemon pitched the Indians
to their sixth straight victory, 5 to 2
over the St. Louis Browns, leaving
them as the only club in either
league still without defeat. It was
his second victory and it was well
earned, lie scattered eight hits, gave
up only one walk, and struck out
four to pull up even with Feller,
who won his second game last Sai
urday, and who goes out after num
ber three tomorrow.
THE Y ANKEES won their fourth
straight, topping the Senators- at
New York. 5 to 4 in the 10th when
Joe DiMaggio's long fly with the
bases loaded sent Bobby Brown
across with the winning run.
As usual. Joe Page, the master re
lief artist, had to come on to help
a faltering starter and his four hit -
less innings gained him the victory.
The Red Sox, getting four homers,
each with a man on base, didn't need
any more offensive help in their 11
to 5 victory over the Athletics at
Philadelphia. Sam Mele, Joe Dob
son, Ted Williams, and Murrell
(Jake) Jones got the round-trippers.
Dobson, an 18 - game winner last
year, gained his first triumph.
THE Ki:i)S HAD TO (JO 14 in
nings and then cash in a homer by
rookie Hank Sauer to defeat the St.
Louis Cardinals. 5 to 4, at Cincin
nati. It was Salter's fifth homer of
the season, putting him in a tie with
Ken Keltner of the Indians for the
major league lead.
Elmer Riddle, who apparently has
licked the arm trouble that plagued
him for four years, scored his sec

ond impressive pitching triumph, a
seven-hit. 4 to 2 decision for the Pi
rates over the Cubs at Chicago.
Frankie Gustine led the 10-hit at
tack for Pittsburgh with a double
and two singles.
The Dodgers got bat happy, put
ting on a 20-hit display that in
cluded terrific homers by rookie
Preston Ward and oldster Pete Rei
ser in a 17 to 7 victory over the
Giants. The victory ended a six
game Giant winning streak and a
three-game Dodger losing skein.
