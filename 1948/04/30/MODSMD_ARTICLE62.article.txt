# Cards Play Ucla Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
If the rains go away and the lake that has tr.ken over
the Sunken Diamond dries up, Stanford will play iis
eighth CIBA game tomorrow at 3:15 p.m. against the
invading UCLA Bruins. Odds quoted from the weather
man are 2 to 1 that the rain will stay.
UCLA comes to Stanford just after playing its, best
game of the year against USC. The Bruins upset USC
last Monday when their ace 'pitcher, George Stannich,
shut out the Trojans 2 to 0.
UCLA is in third place in conference standings, with
three wins and four losses. In previous games with Stan
ford, the Bruins won one and lost one.
STANFORD WILL GET a break if hurler Stannich
decides to high jump Saturday instead of pitching, it is
probable that he wil! be most needed at the track meet
and will spend his time there. He beat the Card baseball
men in his first appearance against them.
Stanford will go into the game as a slight favorite,
even though the Cards are resting squarely in the cellar
with two wins and live defeats. The Indians will be
fighting to break a three-game losing streak.
Lanky Dave Stott will probably get the starting
mound assignment, although every pitcher on the squad
is rested and ready to go. Dave Dah'.e was the one who
beat UCLA in the first series.
LEADING THE BRUIN BATSMEN into action will
be their center fieider, Bob Seltzer. Other Bruinfe who
have been tough customers at the plate are footballer
Moose Myers at first base. Skip Rowland at second base,
and Barry Hicks, catcher. â€¢
Jim Kairman will probably start for the Bruins. He
will be backed up by Sid Gilmore and Georce Grue.U
but neither is in the same class with George Stannich.
STANFORD CAN MOVE into a third-place tie with
UCLA it' it wins tomorrow. Charlie Cole and Bob Nava
will be expected to supply the heavy stickwork. They
will be backed up by Bill Arce. who is the only other
.300 hitter on the squad.


CHARLIE COLE. Stanford's flashy first-baseman,
will be on hand tomorrow a* Stanford takes on
UCIA Cole is leading Indian batters with a CIBA
average of and has bit consecutively in the
last seven games.
