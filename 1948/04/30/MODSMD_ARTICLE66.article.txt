# Farm Band to Present Annual Spring Concert
## 
### 
Stanford's 96-pieee band will present its annual spring concert Sunday
afternoon at 4 in the Memorial Auditorium. Music written especially
for concert band will be featured, instead of the usual orchestral
works.
The newly organized brass choir will also take port in the concert.

This group consists of 16 brass in- -1
struments, played by regular band
members. The choir will play four
seventeenth century works.
Members will appear wearing new
uniforms for the first time. The last
of the long-awaited uniforms ar
rived two weeks ago.
SIX WOMEN JOINED the band
after the football season and will
make their first band appearance in
this concert.
Julius E. Shuchat, director of both
the cancert and the brass choir,
said that this will be one of
the few formal concerts attempted
by the band. In past years, such
sites as the Frost Amphitheater and
the Boathouse were used for the 1
spring concerts, lending an infor- ;
mal atmosphere to the audience as
well as the music.
SUNDAY'S PROGRAM includes
"Marche pour la Spartakiade" by '
Serge Prokofieff, "Euryanthe Over- '
ture" by C. M. von Weber, and a
"Folk-Song Suite" by Ralph Vaugh- *
an Williams.
The brass choir will then play 1
works by Orlando di Benedict
Grep. John Adson, and Johann
Pozel.
The band will conclude with the
finale of Paul Fauchet's Symphony
in B Flat and Gustav Hoist's First
Suite in E Fiat.
