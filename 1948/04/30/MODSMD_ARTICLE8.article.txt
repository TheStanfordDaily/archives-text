three and assorted single votes were '
; cast for Gerald L. K. Smith, Earl

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY had
I a two-to-one majority over the |
! Democrats. The tabulations of party
strength were Republican Party.
' 1.772: Democratic Party. 862: Inde
pendent Progressive Party, 201; So
! cialist, 20: and Communist. 10. The
1 Prohibitionist Party received one
| write-in vote.
Members of Pi Sigma Alpha, hon
orary political science fraternity,
who sponsored the straw ballot, also
weighted first, second, and third -
place votes as three, two, and one
j points respectively.
i STASSEN, EISENHOWER, and I
| Dewey remained well ahead of the j
field in this count, but Warren re- !
ceived an overwhelming number of l
third-place votes to jump to fifth .
place. Vandenberg aiso received
strong second and third-place sup- j
port.
Second and third-place voting left
the poll tabulators slightly puzzled.
Both Truman and Wallace got a
majority of their second and third
place votes from Republican voters,
while Stassen was the Democratic
choice. Wallace had received only
two first places from Republicans.
The fraternity hopes to conduct a
similar mock election soot: among i (
the faculty.
