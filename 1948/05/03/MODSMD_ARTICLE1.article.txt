## 
### 
JERUSALEM, May 2 (UP)—Great Britain is sending strong rein
forcements to Palestine including Royal Marine commandos, in
fantry, tanks, and artillery, it was announced today.
The reinforcements are being sent because an attack on Arab
Jaffa by the Jewish Irqun Zvai Leumi organization has caused

"serious deterioration" in the Pales
tine situation, it was explained.
British authorities here at the
same time issued an ultimative de
band to Jews and Arabs to stop fir
ing in Jerusalem at 4 p.m. today
(10 a.m. EST) for a 48-hour period,
so that a truce for the entire Holy
City may be arranged.
As part of the cease-fire ulti
matum, the British announced they
would turn the full force of their
troops against either Jews or Arabs
who tried to advance in the Katamon
suburb beyond the postions they
ocupied at 4 p.m. Saturday.
The cease-fire order was received
with relief by both the Jewish and
Arab communities. A dwindling of
firing soon after it was issued indi
cated that both Jews and Arabs had
accepted it.
Britain's announcement that strong
reinforcements were being sent to
Palestine, after weeks of troop with
drawals, was a surprise.

(However, a Jerusalem dispatch of
the British Exchange Telegraph said
that Eliezer Kaplan, spokesman for

tested against the reinforcement
program.)
