## Let's Make a Change 
### 
One thing everyone will agree upon is that the recent student
body elections were far from perfect. Admitted this was the
first time in recent years electioneering was permitted, but mis
takes were made which should not be tolerated next year.
Now that such mistakes have been demonstrated, election
board and Excom should take definite action this quarter.
Enough confusion and ill feeling has already been caused without
a second year of election time chaos.
We suggest:
1. That the ASSU constitution be reworded so that the section
on election expenditures is clearcut and comprehensive. If an
inclusive list cannot be included in the constitution, at least a
definite policy should be laid down in election board rules of
procedure.
1. That, in all future elections, each candidate should submit
to election board each item of expense prior to putting out
money for that item and that election board keep an official
expense account for each candidate. This would serve two pur
poses. First, there would be no confusion as to how much each
person spent. Interpretation of the constitution would not be
in the hands of campaign managers but up to election board
where it belongs. Candidates could still spring campaign sur
prises; election board would keep proposed expenditures secret
until after the election. Second, it would prevent an unscrupu
lous candidate from disqualifying his opponent by spending
more than the authorized amount in his opponent's name. Under
present rules, any aid, whether from friend or foe, must be in
cluded in the budget.
3. That some group enforce rules regarding the placing of
posters on poles and trees. Throughout the campaign, our cam
pus looked like Bay Meadows after the last race. If necessary,
special boards should be erected at election time for posters.
4. That all ballot boxes be locked and inspected by a reliable
official before and after voting. Ballot box stuffing was no im
possible last week.
5. That regularly appointed, responsible persons count the bal
lots. Any volunteer having enough interest in the election to
give time to count ballots is hardly disinterested in the results.
6. That indelible pencil or a punch be used to void sections
of the ballot where necessary. The soft pencil marks used in
the last election could be easily erased.
We repeat, these are suggestions only. Excom and election
board will have to study the matter before any action is taken.
But, such action should be taken this quarter.

1. That, in all future elections, each candidate should submit
to election board each item of expense prior to putting out
money for that item and that election board keep an official
expense account for each candidate. This would serve two pur
poses. First, there would be no confusion as to how much each
person spent. Interpretation of the constitution would not be
in the hands of campaign managers but up to election board
where it belongs. Candidates could still spring campaign sur
prises; election board would keep proposed expenditures secret
until after the election. Second, it would prevent an unscrupu
lous candidate from disqualifying his opponent by spending
more than the authorized amount in his opponent's name. Under
present rules, any aid, whether from friend or foe, must be in
cluded in the budget.
3. That some group enforce rules regarding the placing of
posters on poles and trees. Throughout the campaign, our cam
pus looked like Bay Meadows after the last race. If necessary,
special boards should be erected at election time for posters.
4. That all ballot boxes be locked and inspected by a reliable
official before and after voting. Ballot box stuffing was no im
possible last week.
5. That regularly appointed, responsible persons count the bal
lots. Any volunteer having enough interest in the election to
give time to count ballots is hardly disinterested in the results.
6. That indelible pencil or a punch be used to void sections
of the ballot where necessary. The soft pencil marks used in
the last election could be easily erased.
We repeat, these are suggestions only. Excom and election
board will have to study the matter before any action is taken.
But, such action should be taken this quarter.
