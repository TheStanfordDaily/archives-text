# CAMPUS OPINION
## Revise Election Code 
### 
To the Editor:
Last week's elections and the campaign that preceded them represented
a step toward relative political maturity for the Stanford campus. Future
campaigns will undoubtedly give the student body even greater oppor
tunities to see their candidates in action, and the record 58 per cent vote
should satisfy nobody. If the "new era" brings a real rise in interest in
student government there will be no further basis for the charge that
this government is a farce. But if the result is the fabulously expensive,
over-ballyhooed, mud-slinging type of prestige contest that is common at
certain other California universities, the advantage gained will not be
worth the price.
The instrument for preventing campaign excesses is available, but in
its present condition it will not do the job. The election code must be
revised and elaborated, not interpreted. Its present inadequacy and am
biguity were demonstrated by the inability of Election Board officials
during the campaign to tell candidates exactly what they could and could
not do, and by the inability of Excom to provide any interpretations during
the investigation Tuesday night. The clause that reads "Campaign mate
rial should be such as is available to all candidates," in particular, needs
to be given a detailed explanation, not by the law department, but by
Excom. A committee could be appointed to draw up a new set of by-laws
for submission sometime before the next elections.
The new by-laws should be comprehensive and enforceable, but should
not discourage the type of imaginative campaigning that has proved its
ability to get out the vote. Here's for bigger, better, and adequately
regulated election campaigns.
