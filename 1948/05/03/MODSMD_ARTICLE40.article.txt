## History 1948 Control of the Press Essential to Dictators 
### 
President Peron of Argentina has evidently been
studying recent history. At least he knows, as a
student of the period would learn, that conti'ol of
the press has been essential to those who would rule
Nvith a heavy hand. This has been the case because
it is only through a free press that the entire com-

munity can be made aware of
the abuses imposed upon parts
of it, and thus be afforded the
opportunity to rally its collec
tive strength in opposition to the
minority that is seizing and mis
using power.
Soviet Russia furnishes the
earliest Jesson. Free press and
free enterprise went out togeth
er. Neither disappeared imme
diately after the November revo
lution in 1917.- At first the new
regime did not eliminate the en-

lire press but only a part of the bourgeois press,
meantime making things as difficult as possible for
the non-Bolshevik newspapers.
But on June 28, 1919, the Soviet authorities de
creed the nationalization of all large-scale industry,
and in the events that swiftly followed, freedom of
expression and other civil liberties were extin
guished.
Italy came next. The suppression on Sept. 30,
1925, of Italy's second largest newspaper, the Turin
Stampa, because of critical comment on the Italian
maneuvers of that year, was not recognized by many
Italians as the beginning of a process that would
end with the extinction of all freedom.
This should have made clear to them the meaning
of the new Fascist press law, but it did not, since the
Fascist violation of political rights seemed to a large
part of the Italian people a small price to pay for
"tranquillity and security." They learned, to their
sorrow, that liberty is indivisible.
Germany was next in line. Prior to the impo
sition of press controls, the circulation of daily and
weekly newspapers in Germany supporting the Nazis
amounted to less than four per cent of the total. The
first press law, proclaimed on Oct. 4, 1933, made all
journalists semi-state officials independent of direc
tion by their employers, and subject to registration
and licensing by the state.
The second series of decrees, in April, 1935, gave
the party press of the National Socialists the right
to suppress any competition and provided for the
strict regulation of any "co-ordinated" newspapers
still surviving. The last vestiges of press and other
freedoms were swiftly extinguished.
Franco Spain gave another demonstration of Ihe
inseparability of all private rights and freedoms.
When Franco achieved power, Falangc dictators were
installed in all party newspapers; plants of opposing
newspapers were confiscated; newsprint was rationed
by a Falange syndicate all newspaper men were
licensed and unable to engage in the profession with
out a permit. Press freedom, there as elsewhere,
ended with other civil liberties.
President Peron's latest move against the Argen
tine newspapers is a decree providing for govern
ment "acquisition and expropriation" of newsprint,
in which opposition papers, now facing a newsprint
crisis, see increased evidence that the government
seeks to establish a monopoly in newsprint for the
purpose of squeezing out critics.
This is the classic first step by which dictatorship
is imposed upon a people. By its very nature, dic
tatoi'ship moves inexorably to stifle the voice of a
free press and to destroy the sources of information

which are essential to an intelligent and effective
public opinion.
In following in this respect the pattern endorsed
by Stalin and Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, Senor
Peron has embarked on a course of infinite danger
to his country. We really must take our hats off to
the great newspapers of Buenos Aires, La Prensa
and La Nacion, which still carry on the critical and
decisive battle for a free press in Argentina.

installed in all party newspapers; plants of opposing
newspapers were confiscated; newsprint was rationed
by a Falange syndicate all newspaper men were
licensed and unable to engage in the profession with
out a permit. Press freedom, there as elsewhere,
ended with other civil liberties.
President Peron's latest move against the Argen
tine newspapers is a decree providing for govern
ment "acquisition and expropriation" of newsprint,
in which opposition papers, now facing a newsprint
crisis, see increased evidence that the government
seeks to establish a monopoly in newsprint for the
purpose of squeezing out critics.
This is the classic first step by which dictatorship
is imposed upon a people. By its very nature, dic
tatoi'ship moves inexorably to stifle the voice of a
free press and to destroy the sources of information

which are essential to an intelligent and effective
public opinion.
In following in this respect the pattern endorsed
by Stalin and Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, Senor
Peron has embarked on a course of infinite danger
to his country. We really must take our hats off to
the great newspapers of Buenos Aires, La Prensa
and La Nacion, which still carry on the critical and
decisive battle for a free press in Argentina.

President Peron of Argentina has evidently been
studying recent history. At least he knows, as a
student of the period would learn, that conti'ol of
the press has been essential to those who would rule
Nvith a heavy hand. This has been the case because
it is only through a free press that the entire com-

munity can be made aware of
the abuses imposed upon parts
of it, and thus be afforded the
opportunity to rally its collec
tive strength in opposition to the
minority that is seizing and mis
using power.
Soviet Russia furnishes the
earliest Jesson. Free press and
free enterprise went out togeth
er. Neither disappeared imme
diately after the November revo
lution in 1917.- At first the new
regime did not eliminate the en-

lire press but only a part of the bourgeois press,
meantime making things as difficult as possible for
the non-Bolshevik newspapers.
But on June 28, 1919, the Soviet authorities de
creed the nationalization of all large-scale industry,
and in the events that swiftly followed, freedom of
expression and other civil liberties were extin
guished.
Italy came next. The suppression on Sept. 30,
1925, of Italy's second largest newspaper, the Turin
Stampa, because of critical comment on the Italian
maneuvers of that year, was not recognized by many
Italians as the beginning of a process that would
end with the extinction of all freedom.
This should have made clear to them the meaning
of the new Fascist press law, but it did not, since the
Fascist violation of political rights seemed to a large
part of the Italian people a small price to pay for
"tranquillity and security." They learned, to their
sorrow, that liberty is indivisible.
Germany was next in line. Prior to the impo
sition of press controls, the circulation of daily and
weekly newspapers in Germany supporting the Nazis
amounted to less than four per cent of the total. The
first press law, proclaimed on Oct. 4, 1933, made all
journalists semi-state officials independent of direc
tion by their employers, and subject to registration
and licensing by the state.
The second series of decrees, in April, 1935, gave
the party press of the National Socialists the right
to suppress any competition and provided for the
strict regulation of any "co-ordinated" newspapers
still surviving. The last vestiges of press and other
freedoms were swiftly extinguished.
Franco Spain gave another demonstration of Ihe
inseparability of all private rights and freedoms.
When Franco achieved power, Falangc dictators were
installed in all party newspapers; plants of opposing
newspapers were confiscated; newsprint was rationed
by a Falange syndicate all newspaper men were
licensed and unable to engage in the profession with
out a permit. Press freedom, there as elsewhere,
