## Aerial 'Road Signs' 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C.—The United States is busy
these clays putting up aerial "road signs."
A thousand freshly painted markers on rooftops
and highways emblazon Skyway Number One from
Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. About 4,000 more
are needed to mark every community in a 40-mile
widc band along the 4,100 miles of the forking route.
Underscoring a new era in private flying, Sky
way Number One was dedicated as "the Wright
Way" at multiple exercises in cities of the route
on April 24, notes the National Geographic So
ciety.
The Wright Way is the first continuous contact
flying route in an envisioned national network to be
gradually achieved through efforts of local airports
and chambers of commerce. Its prime movers are
the Washington Board of Trade and the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce.
Running east 1,150 miles from Los Angeles to
Abilene, Texas, the sky route touches Phoenix,
Tucson, and El Paso. Eastward from Abilene, it
branches into a 1,440-mile northern lane reaching
Washington by way of Tulsa, St. Louis, Indianapolis,
and Pittsburgh, and a 1,510-mile southern route
touching Shreveport, Atlanta, Greensboro, and Rich
mond.
Part of the northern route—the 112 miles be
tween Indianapolis and Dayton — was the first
stretch marked for air travel in the country. Day
ton, home of the Army Air Forces' vast Wright
Field, was the home of pioneer aircraft experimen
tation by Wilbur and Orville Wright.
Of nearly 6,000 airports and landing fields now
counted by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, an esti
mated 1,500 catering to private planes lie along or
near the Wright Way. The country's airfields num
bered only 1,000 when Lindbergh hopped the Atlan
tic in 1927. Spurred by the Federal aid of the Na
tional Airport program, approved in May, 194G, air
ports increased more than 1,000 in 1947 alone.
Texas and California, with more than 400 air
fields each, lead the states, followed by Florida
and New York. Pennsylvania is in the van in
air-marking its towns.
New trends in flying fields include the airpark,
pioneered at Eldon, Missouri, with hotel, resort, and
service facilities for the flying family on vacation;
the flight&top in open areas of the West, where serv
ice stations supply both planes and autos on cross
country trips; and farmers' and ranchers' air centers
as at Davis, California, where air-minded farmers
by the score visit University of California experi
mental farms.
Besides the current rapid increase in airfields
catering to private planes, pilots and aircraft are
also on the rise. There are nearly 100,000 regis
tered aircraft available for the use of about 240.000
private and 200.000 commercial licensed nilols.
And to Skyway Number One. add Skyway Num
ber Eleven, recently designated by the CAA. From
a northern terminal at Pembina, North Dakota, GO
miles south of Winnipeg, it runs southward to San
Antonio, Texas. There it sends separate spurs on to
the Mexican border—one to Brownsville, the other
to Laredo.

private and 200.000 commercial licensed nilols.
And to Skyway Number One. add Skyway Num
ber Eleven, recently designated by the CAA. From
a northern terminal at Pembina, North Dakota, GO
miles south of Winnipeg, it runs southward to San
Antonio, Texas. There it sends separate spurs on to
the Mexican border—one to Brownsville, the other
to Laredo.
WASHINGTON, D.C.—The United States is busy
these clays putting up aerial "road signs."
A thousand freshly painted markers on rooftops
and highways emblazon Skyway Number One from
Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. About 4,000 more
are needed to mark every community in a 40-mile
widc band along the 4,100 miles of the forking route.
Underscoring a new era in private flying, Sky
way Number One was dedicated as "the Wright
Way" at multiple exercises in cities of the route
on April 24, notes the National Geographic So
ciety.
The Wright Way is the first continuous contact
flying route in an envisioned national network to be
gradually achieved through efforts of local airports
and chambers of commerce. Its prime movers are
the Washington Board of Trade and the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce.
Running east 1,150 miles from Los Angeles to
Abilene, Texas, the sky route touches Phoenix,
Tucson, and El Paso. Eastward from Abilene, it
branches into a 1,440-mile northern lane reaching
Washington by way of Tulsa, St. Louis, Indianapolis,
and Pittsburgh, and a 1,510-mile southern route
touching Shreveport, Atlanta, Greensboro, and Rich
mond.
Part of the northern route—the 112 miles be
tween Indianapolis and Dayton — was the first
stretch marked for air travel in the country. Day
ton, home of the Army Air Forces' vast Wright
Field, was the home of pioneer aircraft experimen
tation by Wilbur and Orville Wright.
Of nearly 6,000 airports and landing fields now
counted by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, an esti
mated 1,500 catering to private planes lie along or
near the Wright Way. The country's airfields num
bered only 1,000 when Lindbergh hopped the Atlan
tic in 1927. Spurred by the Federal aid of the Na
tional Airport program, approved in May, 194G, air
ports increased more than 1,000 in 1947 alone.
Texas and California, with more than 400 air
fields each, lead the states, followed by Florida
and New York. Pennsylvania is in the van in
air-marking its towns.
New trends in flying fields include the airpark,
pioneered at Eldon, Missouri, with hotel, resort, and
service facilities for the flying family on vacation;
the flight&top in open areas of the West, where serv
ice stations supply both planes and autos on cross
country trips; and farmers' and ranchers' air centers
as at Davis, California, where air-minded farmers
by the score visit University of California experi
mental farms.
Besides the current rapid increase in airfields
catering to private planes, pilots and aircraft are
also on the rise. There are nearly 100,000 regis
tered aircraft available for the use of about 240.000
private and 200.000 commercial licensed nilols.
