## Bull Session 
### 
Clyde Beatty's circus is in town. I found out the
hard way.
Coming home from LOmmies the other night, I
almost ran into six of their elephants. They were
crossing El Camino with the green light, on then
way to pasture, and holding on to one another's
tails with their trunks.
The light from the overhead signal gave the
elephants a greenish hue, and if you think a thing

like that doesn't gave you a
shock, Ihen you've never re
turned from L'Ommie's at one
o'clock in the morning.
* # *
Overheard between coeds on
campus: "Ahe you working for
your MA or your MRS?"
* * *
For the first time in many
months, local police handed out
citations to cars parked in front
of The Daily. It seems there are
three spaces out there limited to

one hour only.
Next day when the officer came around he was
unable to give out more tickets legally. Why?
Wei, it seems that the "one hour" parking sign
was sawed off and disappeared during the night.
Just another example of Yankee ingenuity.
My suggestion to you, officer, is paint the curb
red. Damn college kids, let 'em try and take that
away.
Or better yet, just forget the whole thing.

Question of the week: This week s selection ap

peared on the Sociology 1 midquarter of Professor
Reuter. The question:
"Are midget bookkeepers the little things that
count?"
The answer, of course, is "false." The little things
that really do count are questions like Professor
Reuter's. I've never met the gentleman, but I'll bet
he's what we call a "right guy." And fie on those
academicians who say the question was "unethical.''
Its value remains even if never graded.
* * *
Why is it dessert, the best part of the dinner, is
served last when you're too full to eat it? Has there
ever been a "dessert first" movement?
* * *
Joke:
First drinker: "I'll have a Horse's Neck."
Second drinker: "I'll have a Horse's Tail—no use
killing two horses."
♦ # *
I had another one for this space, but there's no
sense in killing two jokes either.
* * *
There is a copy of a Chinese newspaper in the
office.
That is to say, il is written in English but pub
lished in Shanghai. The price is 55,000 a copy, which
is only slightly more than you owe the Administra
tion. The yearly subscription rate is $1,800,000.
Now then, I say to those people who constantly
criticize their own little publication, aren't you glad
you weren't born in Shanghai? You may not always
like what we print in The Daily, but look at the
money you've saved.

Clyde Beatty's circus is in town. I found out the
hard way.
Coming home from LOmmies the other night, I
almost ran into six of their elephants. They were
crossing El Camino with the green light, on then
way to pasture, and holding on to one another's
tails with their trunks.
The light from the overhead signal gave the
elephants a greenish hue, and if you think a thing

like that doesn't gave you a
shock, Ihen you've never re
turned from L'Ommie's at one
o'clock in the morning.
* # *
Overheard between coeds on
campus: "Ahe you working for
your MA or your MRS?"
* * *
For the first time in many
months, local police handed out
citations to cars parked in front
of The Daily. It seems there are
three spaces out there limited to

one hour only.
Next day when the officer came around he was
unable to give out more tickets legally. Why?
Wei, it seems that the "one hour" parking sign
was sawed off and disappeared during the night.
Just another example of Yankee ingenuity.
My suggestion to you, officer, is paint the curb
red. Damn college kids, let 'em try and take that
away.
Or better yet, just forget the whole thing.

Question of the week: This week s selection ap

peared on the Sociology 1 midquarter of Professor
Reuter. The question:
"Are midget bookkeepers the little things that
count?"
The answer, of course, is "false." The little things
that really do count are questions like Professor
Reuter's. I've never met the gentleman, but I'll bet
he's what we call a "right guy." And fie on those
academicians who say the question was "unethical.''
Its value remains even if never graded.

Why is it dessert, the best part of the dinner, is
served last when you're too full to eat it? Has there
ever been a "dessert first" movement?
* * *
Joke:
First drinker: "I'll have a Horse's Neck."
Second drinker: "I'll have a Horse's Tail—no use
killing two horses."

I had another one for this space, but there's no
sense in killing two jokes either.

There is a copy of a Chinese newspaper in the
office.
That is to say, il is written in English but pub
lished in Shanghai. The price is 55,000 a copy, which
is only slightly more than you owe the Administra
tion. The yearly subscription rate is $1,800,000.
Now then, I say to those people who constantly
criticize their own little publication, aren't you glad
you weren't born in Shanghai? You may not always
like what we print in The Daily, but look at the
money you've saved.
