### 
j Campus police request that prank
| sters do not set fire to the lion in
| front of the SAE house.
In the past, jokesters have poured
oil on the lion and lighted it, causing
; the oil and paint to burn. Last
1 Thursday morning the police were
! called away from other necessary
duties to resave the lion.
Jim Rose, SAE president, also has
asked future feline pyromaniacs to
refrain from setting fire to the lion,
especially in view of the lion's "pres
ent delicate condition."
Chief of Police Gordon Davis has
also announced that payment of fines
is due within three days after the
fine is incurred. A fee of one dollar
| will be levied on those who do not
pay their fines on time.
