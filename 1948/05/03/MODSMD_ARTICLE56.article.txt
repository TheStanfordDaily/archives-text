# TOO MUCH AND TOO FEW
## UCLA Tops Thinclads 80-50 at Westwood 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
It was just a case of too much
travel, too much wind, and too few
points in the distances and sprints,
as the Stanford track team was j
humbled by the UCLA Bruins 80' - '
to 50Vi> at Westwood Saturday.
In a last-day notice, the Cards j
were hurried to Los Angeles on the
Coaster, after a three-day downpour j
had washed away the Stadium track
and three valuable days of prac
tice.
TIIE INDIAN field team broke 1
three meet records. Otis Chandler j
of the Cards broke the old meet
mark by heaving the shot 53 ft. 2 in. j
to retain the position of the Coast's '
best shotputler. Jeffry Shipkey. j
Bruin three-event ace, threw 53 ft. !
o'ii in. last week, but had to be j
satisfied with a 52 ft. 4 in. toss Sat- I
urday.
A "best-ever" mark of 24 ft. 5 in. J
was registered by Card Gay Bryan
in the broad jump, even though a ;
Charley horse plagued him through
out the meet. However, the latter
affected his other events as he j
jumped six feet in the high jump
and fell back in pain after the fifth
hurdle in the lows.
Bill Larson also broke a meet rec- 1
ord in the pole vault. Even with a ;
strong cross-wind he managed to j
leap 13 ft. 7~'s in. Marty Anderson
cleared 13 ft. even.
LARRY HOFF of the Indians was
given a severe test in the quarter i
mile and in the last lap of the relay, !
but he came through with flying:
colors. In the 440, Larry was in
fourth place at the half-way mark,
as A 1 Kapp of the Bruins set a
killing pace of 21.9 seconds. But
around the last turn Hoflf put on
the steam as Kapp slowly wilted to
win driving hard.
Although George Grimes ran his |
fastest half-mile of the year for the |

Indians (1:55.2), UCLA's Frank j
Fletcher had just a little too much j
strength and outlasted him in a j
close race.
In the hurdles, Downing McKee I
took bad spills in both races, but
Darrell Kreitz went on to turn in I
two good performances against!
Bruin Craig Dixon, who broke two j
meet records.
