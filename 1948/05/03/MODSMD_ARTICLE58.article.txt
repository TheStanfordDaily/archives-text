## 
### FRED HANNUM 
After disappointing partisan spectators by losing the first sets
of the number one, three, and five matches, Stanford's varsity
tennis team settled down to business and slammed the Univer
sity of California with a 7 to 2 victory here Saturday.
It looked like a lost cause when Kirke Mechem, Bob Forbes,

and Lucien Barbour, the first per
formers of the afternoon, dropped
their initial sets. The Cal opponents,
George Gossler. Phil Seymour and
Jim Moulton. had the situation well
in hand, and Stanford appeared des
tined for another loss.
But the Indians were not to be
dealt with so easily. Mechem, no
toriously a slow starter, began slug
ging deep and accurate drives which
were just too hot to handle. The
number one match ended with
Mechem going away, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Forbes, not at his best Saturday,
missed many of his shots against
Cal's Seymour. A smart player, Sey
mour walked away with the number
three match in two straight sets,
G-2, 6-2.
BARBOUR, the number five sin
gles man and the only other man
to lose his first set, outsteadied
Moulton in the next two sets to win,
4-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Bob Lewis, playing at number two,
got worried in his second set against
Dick Grenfell when he discovered
lie was losing, 4-1. Lewis began to
rush the net after forcing Grenfell
away with accurate passing shots,
j and his strong net play downed an
-1 other Cal opponent, 6-3, 7-5.
The second loss to Stanford was
i marked up against Errol Lycette at
j the numebr four position. Lycette
j played a steady, drawn-out match
j against Morrie Sockolov, but fal
j tercd on the long ralies. The out
come was in Sockolov's favor, 8-6,
I 6-1.
FRED LEWIS, handled Bob Sey
mour in the number six spot to win,
I 7-5, 6-4. Lewis might have done
| better if his volley had been steadier.
He won the match on his net play.
Stanford's doubles teams won
matches after coming from behind
| in the same manner as the first
| singles matches.
At number one doubles the Lewis
i twins battled Gossler and Moulton
through three hot sets before finally
i winning, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
Mechem and Barb o u r ware
' stopped the first set, but came back
! strong against Phil Seymour and Mel
Witt to win. 8-10. 6-3, 6-2, and Dave
