# Triple Crew Victory Caps Success Saga
## 
### BY BILL BETHKE 
Horatio Alger himself could hardly
have written a better success story
than the saga of the Stanford crew
which started out last fall with next
to nothing in the way of equipment
and funds and ended by humbling
the eights of UCLA, USC, and San
Diego State last Saturday afternoon
at Los Angeles before 2,000 fans.
Jayvee, frosh, and varsity, in that
order of appearance, swept all the
first place laurels in their first meet J
of the season, winning by greater j
margin in each succeeding 2.000- j
meter race.
THE JUNIOR VARSITY started !
the landslide as they slid by a green
but game San Diego bunch with a
half a length to spare and won in !
6:14. The race was the largest of
the afternoon with the USC and San j
Diego varsity shells rowing against
the Card and Bruin jayvees.
Winds and currents created start- 1
ing line confusion and one mis
start, but the second try was good,
and the four shells leaped through
the first 100 meters in a virtual dead
lock. Gradually the Farm boat
puled out to a half-length lead on
San Diego that they grimly held for
| the remainder of the way.
TWICE THE SAN DIEGO boat
| pulled "big ten" drives and began j
j to creep up on the leaders, but each '
j time the Cardinal oarsmen matched !
their bids with long, smooth, extra- j
I power strokes that kept them in the |
j lead. USC and UCLA were never j
j serious contenders.
Bob S e 11' a k i a n, crew captain, ;
| coxed the jayvees with Jack To- |
bin in the stroke's scat. The other !
I seven men were Tony English, Curt
i Tarr, Max King, Norm Silberling,
j John Lightner, Bob Scothorn, and
Dave Erickson.
The Farm and UCLA frosh took i
to the water next and made their !
first start good. It was a Stanford |
race all the way as the yearlings ;
i widened their early one length lead '
j to nearly six at the finish to win i
i in 6:150.4. Don McKenzie was the i
frosh cox and Bill Bethke was the :
stroke. Mack Church, Andy Field, :
: Jim Lenhart, Chuck Bateson. Don '
1 Casey, A 1 Snyder, and John Hollo- ;
! way filled out the shell.
IN THE FEATURE event of the
■ afternoon Stanford's varsity knifed
through the Ballona Creek waters
t leaving the UCLA first boat almost
out of sight 10 lengths behind and
stopping the watch at 0:01.1, just
| :03.1 seconds short of the course i
j record of 5:58. An fine start gave I
| the Card shell an immediate half- j

length load that they widened
rapidly.
John Dee was the third Farm cox
to get the victor's dunking while
Ted Bohlander was the stroke.
Norm Swanson, Bob Phelps, Jim
Brannaman, Jim Smith, Tony Ar
nosti, Ray Haley, Bob Kendall were
the other varsity oarsmen.
Coaches A. A. Clark and Bill Mer
rill shared the enthusiasm of the
oarsmen over their clean sweep, and
predicted that all three boats would
give Cal a good race on the Oakland
Estuary this coming Saturday.

length load that they widened

John Dee was the third Farm cox
to get the victor's dunking while

Norm Swanson, Bob Phelps, Jim

give Cal a good race on the Oakland
Estuary this coming Saturday.
Horatio Alger himself could hardly
have written a better success story
than the saga of the Stanford crew
which started out last fall with next
to nothing in the way of equipment

the eights of UCLA, USC, and San

at Los Angeles before 2,000 fans.
Jayvee, frosh, and varsity, in that

but game San Diego bunch with a
half a length to spare and won in !
6:14. The race was the largest of
the afternoon with the USC and San j
Diego varsity shells rowing against
the Card and Bruin jayvees.
Winds and currents created start- 1
ing line confusion and one mis
start, but the second try was good,
and the four shells leaped through
the first 100 meters in a virtual dead
lock. Gradually the Farm boat
puled out to a half-length lead on
San Diego that they grimly held for
| the remainder of the way.

j to creep up on the leaders, but each '
