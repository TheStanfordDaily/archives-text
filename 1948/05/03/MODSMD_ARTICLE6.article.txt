# Triple Crew Victory Caps Success Saga
## 
### BY BILL BETHKE 
Horatio Alger himself could hardly
have written a better success story
than the saga of the Stanford crew
which started out last fall with next
to nothing in the way of equipment
and funds and ended by humbling
the eights of UCLA, USC, and San
Diego State last Saturday afternoon
at Los Angeles before 2,000 fans.
Jayvee, frosh, and varsity, in that
order of appearance, swept all the
first place laurels in their first meet J
of the season, winning by greater j
margin in each succeeding 2.000- j
meter race.
THE JUNIOR VARSITY started !
the landslide as they slid by a green
but game San Diego bunch with a
half a length to spare and won in !
6:14. The race was the largest of
the afternoon with the USC and San j
Diego varsity shells rowing against
the Card and Bruin jayvees.
Winds and currents created start- 1
ing line confusion and one mis
start, but the second try was good,
and the four shells leaped through
the first 100 meters in a virtual dead
lock. Gradually the Farm boat
puled out to a half-length lead on
