# Indians Clip Ucla Nine, 6-2 Behind Dahle's One-Hitter
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Lefty Dahle's one-hit pitching
performance bounced Stanford
back into CIBA contention Sat
urday, as the Cards ran past
UCLA 6 to 2 on the Sunken
Diamond. The only hit off Dahle
was a scratch infield roller by
Moose Myers.
Besides limiting the Bruins to
one hit, Dahle struck out twelve
and was never in trouble after the
first inning. Dahle walked two in
the ninth, but tightened to win in
a breeze.
STANFORD looked much im
proved from its recent perform
ances, as only one error was com
mitted. Hitting in the clutch was
consistent, and the Indians proved
that they are still in the running
for the CIBA crown.
UCLA scored twice in the first
inning, but Stanford came back
with two runs in its half to even
the account. Dave Melton, with the
first of three hits, drove in the tying
run, and from then on the Cards
knew where they were going.
Biil Arce started the second with
a single, advanced to scoring posi-

tion on a sacrifice by Buck Brown
son, and came home on Ted Nell's
perfect squeeze bunt. Stanford
cinched the game in the third when
Arce singled with men on second
i:nd third, to drive in two more
runs.
THE CARDS scored one more in
the fourth, and then settled down
to protect their lead. The win raised
Stanford two notches in the league
race, and placed them within shoot
ing distance once more of Califor
nia.
The Golden Bears had a disas
trous weekend down south, drop
ping both of their games to the
USC Trojans. UCLA also dropped
two games over the weekend, com
ing out on the short end of an S to 5
count with Santa Clara Saturday
i ight. The CIBA race has been
turned into a wild scramble, and
every team in the league still has
a chance to grab top honors.
Dave Melton led the Stanford at
tack Saturday with three hits in
four trips to the plate. He was fol
lowed by Bill Arce who collected
two hits.
FOUL TIPS . . . When Dahle
won his game Saturday he ended

Stanford's three - game losing
streak, gained his second win and
Stanford's third of the season,
and brought his strike-out total
to 19 for the last two games. . . .
Kiil Aire's two hits raised his
CIBA average up to .354 and
made him the leading hitter on
the squad. Charlie Cole picked
up one hit to hold the second spot
in the averages with .344. . . .
Stanford h%s only one game (San
Jose) before it goes up against
California next Saturday. It will
he Cal's first appearance this year
in the Sunken Diamond. . . . Tips
from the south have it that UC
LA's win over USC last week was
the first time in eleven years that
the Bruins have been able to
down the Trojans in baseball.

LEFTY DAVE

brilliant pitch
ing p erf o rm
ance gave Stan
