# Card Mermen Set Two PCC Records
## 
### 
Two PCC records were erased
over the weekend as Stanford's
powerful varsity swimming team
posted a double win over the USC
and the UCLA Bruin squads.
On Friday afternoon Indian cap
tain Bob Anderson led his team
mates to a scant 39 to 36 victory
over the Troymen by eclipsing a
tenth of a second off his own con
ference record of 23.1 for the 50-yard
sprint.
On Saturday, Ralph Sala swam to
a 2:13.2 new record in the 220-yard
freestyle event as the Indians
downed UCLA 48 to 27 at the West
wood tank. The old mark of 2:13.3
was set by Washington's Jack Medi
ca in 1934.
