# Draft Bill Before House To Include Collegians
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 3 (UP).â€”The House Armed Services
Committee today passed a bill to draft men 19 through 25 years
of age. The bill does not exempt college men who have had less
than one year in the armed services, but it does permit them to
finish an academic year.

The measure by-passes universal military training. It cleared

the committee by a 28 to 5 vote and
its backers hope the full House will
pass it next week.
THE BILL would have to be ap
proved by the Senate and signed by
the President, after which the lirst
draftees could be called up in 90
days.
The Senate Armed Services Com
mtitee still is considering its own
military manpower act, a combina
tion. of the draft and UMT which
has the administration's blessing but
which is strongly opposed in the
House.
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ap
proved a separate UMT measure last
summer, but the Republican lead
ership has refused to clear it for
floor action and appears determined
to block it at least for the rest of
this session.
The number of youths 'o be in
ducted under the House draft is
uncertain. It depends upon the rate
of re-enlistments among men now
in the armed forces. But the most
popular guess was that at least
700.000 would have to be drafted
during the two-year life of the
measure.
THE BILL PROVIDES for regis
tration of all men 18 through 30, but
limits the draft to the 19-through
-25 group and exempts veterans of
more than one year's service in
World War 11.
Ex-servicemen who were in the
armed forces more than 90 days but
less than one year could be drafted
unless they joined the organized re
serves.
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS,
clergymen, and divinity students
Would be exempted.
High school students would be
permitted to graduate before in
duction. provided they finished
school before reaching 20.
After each draftee served his two
year tour of duty, he would have to
join the inactive reserves for five
years. He could avoid that by sign
ing on for another year of regular
military service.
