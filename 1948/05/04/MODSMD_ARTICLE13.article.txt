# Taft, Stassen Vie In Ohio Primary
## 
### 
CINCINNATI, May 3 (UP)â€”The
torid Ohio test of the presidential
campaigns of Sen. Robert A. Taft
and Harold E. Stassen will reach
the voters tomorrow in the state's
primary election which is expected
to see a turnout of 1,200,000 voters.
Stakes are high in the Ohio con
test that ends tonight with llth-hour
radio appeals by Taft, favorite son
by choice of the regular GOP organ
ization in the state, and the invading
former governor of Minnesota.
Hopes of both Taft and Stassen are
bright in the important pre-conven
tion primary. Taft has predicted he
will score a shutout and take all 53
Ohio delegates to the GOP national
convention, Stassen predicts he will
win with at least 12 of his 23 entries.
Taft will gain a majority of the
state's delegation without a contest.
Stassen entered two candidates each
in 11 congressional districts and one
for delegate-at-large, assuring Taft
candidates eight at-large seats and
22 district spots.
