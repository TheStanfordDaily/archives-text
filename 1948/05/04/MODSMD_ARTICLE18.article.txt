### 
WASHINGTON, May 3 (UP) —
The Supreme Court today knocked
down the legal bars raised by real
estate owners to keep Negroes and
other minority groups out of "white"
neighborhoods.
The justices ruled 6 to 0 that "jim
crow" real estate agreements can
not be enforced by any court or
police power and need not be ob
served.
THE DECISION was delivered by
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson in a
series of test cases brought by Negro
families in the District of Columbia,
Detroit, and St. Louis.
Associate Justices Robert H. Jack
son, Stanley F. Reed, and Wiley B.
Rutledge disqualified themselves
from the cases. Jackson and Rut
ledge at least are known to own
"restricted" property.
The decision kicked the props
from under countless "whites only"
covenants between real estate own
ers all over the country.
VINSON SAID such covenants are
not illegal in themselves, but un
der the 14th amendment to the Con
stitution, he ruled, the federal and
state governments cannot enforce
them.
The 14th amendment guarantees
all citizens equal protection under
the law and forbids any state to
"abridge the privileges or immun
ities of citizens of the United States."
IF THE STATES are forbidden to
take discriminatory action, Vinson
said, there is no ground for permit
ting the federal government to do so.
The decision concerned Negro
families who bought property in
"white" neighborhoods of St. Louis
and Detroit. The state courts had
ordered the Negroes evicted because
of the real estate pacts.
