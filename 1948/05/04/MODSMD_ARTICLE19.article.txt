# British Propose Palestine Solution
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. May 3 (UP) —
Britain appealed to the United Na
tions today to shelve all other pro
posals and create a "neutral au
thority" in Palestine to assure some
central administration during Arab-
Jewish warfare.
British Delegate Arthur Creech
Jones told the political committee of
the UN General Assembly that Brit
ain's "sole purpose" in rushing troop
reinforcements to the Holy Land was
to enable it to "carry out its task"
until the mandate ends a week from
Saturday.
After that, said Creech Jones, the
UN should pick up the thread ot
legal authority and continue UN ef
forts on the spot to settle the Arab-
Jewish conflict.
The British colonial secretary em
phasized that he was suggesting
merely a "stop-gap administration"
without power to maintain law and
order in Palestine. He said it was
too late to set up the UN trustee
ship favored by the United States
or to return to the original UN par
tition program.
The new British approach was put
forward shortly after it was an
nounced that the International Red
Cross had offered to step into the
faltering UN efforts to arrange a
truce that would save municipal
Jerusalem from chaos.
