# Rail Strike Settlement Hopes Fade

### 
CHICAGO. May 3 (UP) —Govern-
ment hopes to avert a national rail
road strike May tl faded today
while new labor demands were made
in other industries.
The eight-weeks-old meat strike
threatened to spread to independent
packers and unions in the telephone
and automobile industries, and un
covered plans for third-round wage j
battles.
A government mediator dispatched
from Washington to attempt to halt
a railways walkout said that "it '■
looks very much like there might
be a national railway strike May 11."
FRANK P. DOUGLASS, chairman
of the national railway mediation
board said "we are very discour
aged'' after four days of confer
ences with rail officials and repre- [
sentatives of brotherhoods repre
senting engineers, firemen, and
switchmen.
Douglass said a final meeting was j
scheduled tomorrow and after that j
he would probably have to give up.
Meanwhile striking CIO Packing
house Workers fought an attempt
of large packers to restore operations ;
and threatened to tie up independ
ent plants to strengthen the strike, j

massed 1,500 pickets at Wilson &
Co. gates in Chicago to fight a back
to-work movement at major meat j

At the same time Union President
Ralph Helstein said strikes had been !
authorized against independent j
packers, wherever the union legally j
can call a walkout. The walkout
already had spread to Detroit and j
was threatening at St. Paul.
Helstein told a newo conference i
meat packing strike for a nine-cent"!
he would "consider" settling the 1
hourly raise if packers cut meat ;
prices, but observers believed this j
was unlikely. The union has de- !
manded a 20-cent wage boost.
