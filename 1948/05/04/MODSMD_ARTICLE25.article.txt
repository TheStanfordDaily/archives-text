# Old Parties Are Now Alike, Wallace Supporters Claim
## 
### 
The difTerence between the Re- j
publican and Democratic parties to- j
day is no more than that between i
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, as- j
serted round table speakers who |
supported the formation of the j
newly-formed Third Party last night |
in Cubberley Auditorium. The
meeting was sponsored by the Stan
ford chapter of Students for Demo- \
era tic Action.
A bipartisan audience applauded I
enthusiastically views presented by
Forrest K. Barnes and Dr. Robert
Weinstock, presenting the pi'o side !
of ihe question, and Dr. Theodore j
J. Kreps and Francis M. Carney. ;
"who spoke against the party.
Regardless of the party platform
against the Marshall Plan and aid |
to Greece and Turkey, reliable polls j
reveal that members of the party
are strongly for the movements, said j
Dr. Kreps in answer to arguments

given by Third Party adherents.
"This is proof that they actually
have no party platform ahd I look
in vain for issue. What Wallace sup
porters are doing is guaranteeing a
parly split and the election of a Re
publican Congress. The Democratic
Party is still the true liberal party,"
he declared.
