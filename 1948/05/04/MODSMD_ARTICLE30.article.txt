Why preferential balloting? Why as in the elections last week should
a man who was favored by more voters than any other candidate lose to
someone else's second or third choice? The campaign was essentially a
selling campaign. Frank Wolff sold himself to more people as the best
man for the job, yet he lost. The other candidates had a much lower first
place vote than did Wolff, yet one of them won because he was a second
er third-rate choice. What about those 1817 people who voted for Wolff?
There were more of them than for any other candidate by a very large
number. Twenty-five per cent of the student body voted for Frank Wolff.
Are they to be unrepresented?
I don't think people when voting are prepared to evaluate four candi
dates in a strict one to four order. It's hard enough to make up your mind
on one candidate, let alone four. It seems to me that it should be a case
of letting the better man win, and in this case the better man seems to
be the one who can make the voters think that he is the best man, not
just second or third best.
It is my idea that the fairest method of electing officers is to have but
two candidates to choose from in the finals. If necessary have two pri
maries. Excom should go into this matter of preferential balloting soon
snd with the assistance and advice of both Gus Chavalas and Frank Wolff.
