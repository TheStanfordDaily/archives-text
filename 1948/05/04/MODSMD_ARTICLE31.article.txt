# Ignoring the Plurality
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In view of the returns in the ASSU presidential election, we feel that
consideration should be given to the discarding of the preferential ballot.
It would seem that when one candidate wins by a margin of 500 votes 011
the first count, and then is defeated in the final count by the preferential
system, the wishes of the plurality have been ignored. The second and
third choices often do not definitely represent considered opinions—in
fact they are often frivolous.
We feel that those who are now revising the constitution should con
sider abandoning the preferential system.
We would appreciate comment on the "pros" and "cons" on this idea.
(Incidentally, we voted two for Chavalas and two for Wolf.)
