# Spread the Jobs Around

To the Editor:
The best solution to date on this whole question of activities lies in the
very activity files referred to in your editorial at the beginning of this
quarter. At present there are a great many activities work-horses, and a
great many on-lookers—an admittedly unhealthy situation. Campus ac
tivities themselves can correct this by making use of the files.
A telephone call or a visit to the Activities Agency office during office
hours (at other times contact the co-chairmen) is all that is necessary to
secure a list of people of any desired interests and qualifications. In this
way jobs can be spread around, new blood brought into activities, and no
one's marks need suffer.
All this depends to a great extent on the organizations themselves.
The files are there, but they can never be successful unless more exten
sive use is made of them.
