# Is Uncle Sam a Cheerful Giver?

To the Editor:
A few weeks ago the Stanford Students for Wallace meeting was held.
After the meeting I joined one of the bull-sessions in which two people
were discussing pro and con of the Marshall Plan. One of the contestants
argued that the Marshall Plan was not in form a truly democratic plan,
and the other thought there was nothing inherent in the plan that was
anti-democratic. Tempers rose, as each tried to bring in pertinent data to
support his stand. I couldn't help but feel that perhaps the vital point
of the discussion was lost in a maze of particulars. The plan doesn't seem
to me just a product of American financial and economic imperialism, and
Mop Russia expediency; or on the other hand, a good, sound, democratic
business investment; but more important, the only way to give freedom
*.nd hope to a war-sick, diseased world.
I believe nothing given in the long run is beneficial or permanent,
unless given without strings attachedâ€”without a spirit of, here is our
help, remember that WE gave it to you. We are not giving, in the true
sense, when we demand something in return.
