## Atomic Power from Thorium 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP). —Tho disclosure that tho
rium metal is being transformed into atomic fuel has
stirred scientists here. It alters the future of nuclear
power, as they picture it.
Thorium is three or four times as plentiful as ura
nium, the only other natural source of atomic energy
used at present. It is easier to handle chemically and
to store.
Scientists have been saying for a long time that
nuclear power plants will not be able to compete
economically with plants using ordinary fuels.
The most promising future for the new power,
the experts have said. lies in desert or cold re
gions where transportation co:.ts would be in
atomic energy's favor.
The new prospects that nuclear fuel supplies
may in the end be more than tripled could alter
such views.
At the same time, a point is added to talk of stock
piling atomic bombs. Uranium deposits are scarce,
compared to other natural resources such as coal
and oil.
The view of many scientists has been that richer
sources or more efficient refining methods must be
developed. Until then, it is dreaming to talk of stock
piling bombs in any very large numbers, they said.
But with the practical conversion of thorium into
raw material for atomic energy on an industrial scale,
new sources of nuclear fuel would be at hand.
Relatively rich deposits of thorium ore exist in
India and Brazil. Other-., are in Ceylon, the Neth
erlands East Indies, and North Carolina, South
Carolina. Florida, and Idaho.
There have been reports of a rich thorium strike,
said to be coveted by Russia, in the westernmost
Chinese province of Sinkiang.
Laboratory physicists have long known that tho
rium may be transmuted into uranium-233 under
bombardment by neutrons liberated from atomic
nuclei. And U-233 is an atomic explosive like U-235
and man-made plutonium.
But not until last March 5 was it officially dis
closed that thorium actually was being transmuted
into U-233. The transformation is taking place in
the nuclear furnaces of the sprawling Ilanford,
Wash., plutonium works.
Those are the same furnaces which transmute
non-explosive U-238 into explosive plutonium.
According to Prof. Glenn T. Seaborg of the Uni
versity of California, a few milligrams of the newest
explosive have been made at Hanford by bombard
ing thorium with neutrons generated in the pluto
nium ovens.
Some sources here look on this as an understate
ment. They say U-233 alchemy has been going on
at Hanford for more than a year. It is known that
scientists many months ago proposed that plutonium
piles be lined with thorium to use extra neutrons
which otherwise would escape and be wasted.

compared to other natural resources such as coal
and oil.
The view of many scientists has been that richer
sources or more efficient refining methods must be
developed. Until then, it is dreaming to talk of stock
piling bombs in any very large numbers, they said.
But with the practical conversion of thorium into
raw material for atomic energy on an industrial scale,
new sources of nuclear fuel would be at hand.
Relatively rich deposits of thorium ore exist in
India and Brazil. Other-., are in Ceylon, the Neth
erlands East Indies, and North Carolina, South
Carolina. Florida, and Idaho.
There have been reports of a rich thorium strike,
said to be coveted by Russia, in the westernmost
Chinese province of Sinkiang.
Laboratory physicists have long known that tho
rium may be transmuted into uranium-233 under
bombardment by neutrons liberated from atomic
nuclei. And U-233 is an atomic explosive like U-235
and man-made plutonium.
But not until last March 5 was it officially dis
closed that thorium actually was being transmuted
into U-233. The transformation is taking place in
the nuclear furnaces of the sprawling Ilanford,
Wash., plutonium works.
Those are the same furnaces which transmute
non-explosive U-238 into explosive plutonium.
According to Prof. Glenn T. Seaborg of the Uni
versity of California, a few milligrams of the newest
explosive have been made at Hanford by bombard
ing thorium with neutrons generated in the pluto
nium ovens.
Some sources here look on this as an understate
ment. They say U-233 alchemy has been going on
at Hanford for more than a year. It is known that
scientists many months ago proposed that plutonium
piles be lined with thorium to use extra neutrons
which otherwise would escape and be wasted.
WASHINGTON (UP). —Tho disclosure that tho
rium metal is being transformed into atomic fuel has
stirred scientists here. It alters the future of nuclear
power, as they picture it.
Thorium is three or four times as plentiful as ura
nium, the only other natural source of atomic energy
used at present. It is easier to handle chemically and
to store.
Scientists have been saying for a long time that
nuclear power plants will not be able to compete
economically with plants using ordinary fuels.
The most promising future for the new power,
the experts have said. lies in desert or cold re
gions where transportation co:.ts would be in
atomic energy's favor.
The new prospects that nuclear fuel supplies
may in the end be more than tripled could alter
such views.
At the same time, a point is added to talk of stock
piling atomic bombs. Uranium deposits are scarce,
compared to other natural resources such as coal
and oil.
