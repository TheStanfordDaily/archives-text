# The 						Forgotten Land

WASHINGTON (UP). —The new plan to develop
Cyprus as a British bastion of the eastern Mediter
ranean is a reminder that this is a land that many
nations forgot—and then, at dramatic moments of
history, remembered with a will.
For more than thirty centuries, the big island
otr the coast of Asia Minor has played a periodic
but significant role in world events, note'j the
National Geographic Society.
Today, as in the time of the Pharaoahs and the
Crusaders, geography has placed it in a key position
along routes to the Middle East. Its barren, ruddy
mountains rise from the blue Mediterranean little
more than 40 miles from the Turkish shore. Syria
and Palestine are respectively only 65 and 140 miles
away.
With the prospective withdrawal of British
forces from Palestine, the Cyprus Crown Colony
will be the nearest British-held territory to the
entrance of the Suez Canal.
Cyprus has been called the isle of Aphrodite,

goddess of love and beauty. From the heat-shim
mering plains of its broad central lowland, cool
green hills rise into rugged mountain ranges,
shrouded with purple haze or painted with tints ot
sun and sky.
