## History 1948 The 						'Other Party' In Labor Disputes 
### 
An American flag hung before the tipple of a
Pennsylvania coal mine. A long line of miners waited
in the cold morning; soon they would go under
ground.
"Things no better now th' government's taken
over, eh Mike?" a burly miner asked his partner.
"No better," his companion said; "just another
damned mine owner."
Government finds itself today — just another
"damned" mine owner, an opponent of labor. Private
management increasingly is turning over its labor
disputes to government, casting government as more
than a third party, more than a disinterested media
tor—as an actual participant. Government finds it
self. more often than not, the other party in labor
management disputes.
Such was the case with the soft coal strike in the
winter of 1946; the labor-management issue became
insignificant beside Lewis' violation of a government
injunction. U.S. District Court Justice T. Alan
Goldsborough found the union and Lewis guilty of
criminal contempt and fine them both. On March 6,
1947, the Supreme Court upheld the findings. Judge
Goldsborough's more recent conviction of % Lewis
under the Taft-Hartley rulings, despite the labor
chief's contention that no strike—as defined—existed,
again placed the government in combat with labor.
The seriousness of this feeling that government is
opposed to labor, that it is the chief antagonist and
most forthright destroyer of the laboring man's right
to work and right to strike could undermine the
worker's confidence in his government.
Under the Taft-Hartley Act, government looks
like Simon Legree to labor—foreclosing on its lib
erties.
Labor has reversed its methods the last ten years;
now it strikes first and arbitrates afterward ... a
primary cause for the Congressional overriding of
President Truman's veto, June 20, 1947, which made
the Taft-Hartley Act law.
Potentially organized labor's 15,400,000 members
(autumn, 1947) hold U.S. production in their hands.
Work stoppages increased from 637 in 1930 to 4,985
in 1946. During the war period alone there were
14,731 strikes involving 6,744,000 workers, and 36,-
300.000 idle man-days.
The big guns of labor's press, once leveled on
management, have turned on government. The Ma
chinist, the International Association of Machinists'
monthly, speaking for 624,000 skilled industrial me
chanics, lashes out today as vehemently against gov
ernment as it formerly did against management.
Monthly this magazine carries names of congressmen
who voted for the Taft-Hartley Bill; in November it
hopes to oust these "crucifiers" of labor.
Within the ranks of labor grows a schizophrenia
caused by double allegiance that pits labor loyalty
against national patriotism. Thus far government has
come out second best. ,
Strikes called against nation-wide industries like
steel, coal, transportation, and communications begin
as labor-management bouts, end up with government
left in the ring to fight it out with labor, while man
agement slyly heads for the showers. Thus govern
ment, once a paternalistic mediator, becomes, in
many laboring minds, the avowed belligerent of
labor.
Government shouldn't have to do the referecing
at all; but obviously management can't do its own
fighting. The alternative is economic crippling.
And yet, there should never exist a choice in
American labor minds: government or union—an
impasse that has led in other nations to civil war
and governmental overthrow.
