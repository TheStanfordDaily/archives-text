# ERLING FORLAND
## Bull Session 
### 
I'm uery hesitant about saying this, let alone
writing it where everyone can see it, but one of my
buddies is a snooper. The rest ot' my buddies are also
ashamed of him, as I am. We've thought of all sorts
of things to do to straighten him out, but nothing
seems to help. He's stuck in his ways. Bad home
training. I guess. In every other way, he's a very nice
guy; it's just his snoopiness that bothers us.
Well, a couple of days ago he was up to his old
tricks at Branner. He was sitting in the lobby wait
ing for a girl he knows, so he tells us. My buddies
don't really believe that. They're pretty sure he
hasn't had a date yet at Stanford. They think he
just went there to snoop. But, that's beside the
point—he was there.
He tells us that as he was sitting there, a group
of girls were off in a corner by themselves, whisper
ing in hushed tones. He couldn't hear so well, so
he got up to get a newspaper from a table that was
near them. To all intents he started reading the
sports section; at least that's what the girls thought,
because they continued talking. As I said before,
he's well trained in snooping. One of my buddies,
who is rather catty, said that our snoopy friend was
trained by his mother when he was rather young,
so that she could keep up on the latest gossip.
Anyway, my buddy tells us that these girls were
bemoaning what happened to them since they came
to Stanford. When they were home, the pills said.

they were sweet and innocent of any terrible
thoughts. But, since they arrived, and were forced
to sign up for courses like Biology and Western Civ,
all sorts of awful ideas have entered their minds.
They no longer have any respect for anything, not
even themselves. Now, when the girls go out on
the Branner sun-porch to sun-bathe, they go with
cold calculation. They treat themselves like a roast
of meat. Keep on turning over and over, so as to
get browned all over. Where is the beauty in life
any more, the girls asked.
No, the girls were well agreed that Biology and
Western Civ had ruined their fine conceptions. When
they were taught that the world is little more than a
machine, and that their bodies are simply a highly
developed mechanism, something fine and beautiful
within them died. It's terrible.
When my snopy buddy came home with this
news, the rest of my buddies set in stunned silence.
It was a long time before anyone said anything.
When at long last someone spoke up. he reproached
our news-gatherer for snooping again, but told him
that this time he was glad that he did what he did.
When such awful things as this happen at our be
loved Stanford, everyone should know about it.
With an enlightened student body, something can be
done, might even force the faculty to drop Western
Civ and Biology from the requirements.

machine, and that their bodies are simply a highly
developed mechanism, something fine and beautiful
within them died. It's terrible.
When my snopy buddy came home with this
news, the rest of my buddies set in stunned silence.
It was a long time before anyone said anything.
When at long last someone spoke up. he reproached
our news-gatherer for snooping again, but told him
that this time he was glad that he did what he did.
When such awful things as this happen at our be
loved Stanford, everyone should know about it.
With an enlightened student body, something can be
done, might even force the faculty to drop Western
Civ and Biology from the requirements.
I'm uery hesitant about saying this, let alone
writing it where everyone can see it, but one of my
buddies is a snooper. The rest ot' my buddies are also
ashamed of him, as I am. We've thought of all sorts
of things to do to straighten him out, but nothing
seems to help. He's stuck in his ways. Bad home
training. I guess. In every other way, he's a very nice
guy; it's just his snoopiness that bothers us.
Well, a couple of days ago he was up to his old
tricks at Branner. He was sitting in the lobby wait
ing for a girl he knows, so he tells us. My buddies
don't really believe that. They're pretty sure he
hasn't had a date yet at Stanford. They think he
just went there to snoop. But, that's beside the
point—he was there.
He tells us that as he was sitting there, a group
of girls were off in a corner by themselves, whisper
ing in hushed tones. He couldn't hear so well, so
he got up to get a newspaper from a table that was
near them. To all intents he started reading the
sports section; at least that's what the girls thought,
because they continued talking. As I said before,
he's well trained in snooping. One of my buddies,
who is rather catty, said that our snoopy friend was
trained by his mother when he was rather young,
so that she could keep up on the latest gossip.
Anyway, my buddy tells us that these girls were
bemoaning what happened to them since they came
to Stanford. When they were home, the pills said.

they were sweet and innocent of any terrible
thoughts. But, since they arrived, and were forced
to sign up for courses like Biology and Western Civ,
all sorts of awful ideas have entered their minds.
They no longer have any respect for anything, not
even themselves. Now, when the girls go out on
the Branner sun-porch to sun-bathe, they go with
cold calculation. They treat themselves like a roast
of meat. Keep on turning over and over, so as to
get browned all over. Where is the beauty in life
any more, the girls asked.
No, the girls were well agreed that Biology and
Western Civ had ruined their fine conceptions. When
they were taught that the world is little more than a
machine, and that their bodies are simply a highly
developed mechanism, something fine and beautiful
within them died. It's terrible.
