# New English Film Called Rank Failure
## 
### 
Two booms, J. Arthur Rank and Charles Dickens, are quite a
combination, but they fail to click on "Nicholas Nickleby," latest
arrival at the Guild Theater.
The Dickens novel is apparently transferred from book to
screen literally without adjustments to a different medium.

What is held together by an au
thor's style becomes a chain of situ
ations, going from the grotesque to
the pleasant; held together by the
fact that two Nicklebys are some
how involved in each situation.
NEITHER NICKLEBY is part of
a situation. Uncle Nickleby is al
ways pushing it toward evil; young
Nicholas is always pushing it to
ward good. Uncle (evil) triumphs
r.t first, but Nicholas (good) wins
in the end.
The social significance of this story
in its time was tremendous. Uncle
Nickelby is a capitalist who leaves a
trail of ruined debtors behind him.
Selfishness, greed, depravity are
vividly portrayed in the usual Dick
ens manner, being intimately con
nected to the economic system. A
prison- like school also appears to
horrify the audience.
DEREK BOND as Nicholas and
Sir Ccdric Hardwicke as Uncle
Ralph the capitalist, turn iti excel
lent performances. Among the sup
porting characters, Stanley Hollo
way deserves special praise. He
keeps popping up in supporting roles
in almost every J. Arthur Rank film
that hits this country, and he is
consistently excellent.
The incidents in this picture are
too repetitious to provide dramatic
qualities essential to a good movie.
