# Library Has Full Set of Lawrence
## 
### BY HERB SMITH 
The Stanford University Library
has one of the most complete col
lections of D. H. Lawrence, con
temporary British author, in exist
ence. These books and manuscripts
were a gift of Mrs. Felton and are
in the library that bears her name.
A collection of Lawrence is
especially valuable because most of
his works were published in small,
privately distributed editions. This
was necessary because Lawrence
was prone to use Anglo Saxon words
in describing things that offended
Anglo Saxon sensibilities.
Probably no author in history,
with the exception of James Joyce,
has had more trouble with prudish
censors than D. H. Lawrence. Even
today an unexpurgated edition of
Lady Chatterly's Lover has not been
published in the United States. The
Felton Library contains both the
Paris and Florence unexpurgated
editions of this famous work.
