Chesterfield representatives Dilys
Jones and Loren "ABC" Smith an
nounced yesterday the opening of a
contest to guess the score of the
big track meet with Cal Saturday.
"The rules are simple," said Smith.
"Write your guess on the back of
an empty Chesterfield package, sign
it including your address, and de

posit it in containers located at En
cina Cellar, Union Cellar, and in
front of the post office."
Jones and Smith stressed that any
number of guesses may be made,
but only one per package. Every
one who guesses the correct score
will receive a carton of Chester
fields.
