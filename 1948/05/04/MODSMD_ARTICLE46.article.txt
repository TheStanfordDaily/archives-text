# White, Fix Look To Be Best Tackle and Guard; Big Scrum on Saturday
## 
### BY JOHN BREIER 
Eighteen practice sessions have come and gone since Marchie
Schwartz first issued the call lor spring football drills. Now, in
the words of Schwartz, "We are beginning to shape up."
And shape up they have for the 1948 Big Red Machine is
working in earnest to prepare for the tough 10-game schedule

laid out for next year. i
Although hampered in the past '
weeks by adverse weather, the grid
ders will hold their big spring
scrimmage Saturday. Stands will be
set up and the teams will be decked
out in different colored jerseys. Ray
Hammett will handle the announcing
chores.
From the 115 men out for spring [
practice, 7 appear to be in line for j
the starting guard positions.
AT THIS POINT Bob Rohrer ap
pears to be one of the best men on
the field in the left guard- class.
Rohrer was called to varsity duty
just before the UCLA game last j
season. At that time he was switched
from end to guard and brought up j
from the JV squad. He has shown j
vast improvement in the drills thus I
far this spring. He is a tricky man
imd very deceptive on defense.

| ;
Jack McKittrick worked himself
into the starting left guard slot last
year and was one of the top per
formers in the USC contest. His
class schedule has kept him from
attending many of the practices this
spring. He should be right up there
j next year.
A TIIIRI) CANDIDATE for the
I position, and one that may well
J find himself a starting berth is 200-
pound Don Lucas. Lucas was a first
string guard on the frosh team of
last year. He is big and a stalwart
on defense.
Four men are standouts at right
| guard. Don Fix, who broke into the
! lineup before last year's UCLA tilt,
j seems to be top man here. Fix was
a fullback at Dayton, Washington.
He is fast for a lineman and is
equally good on offense and defense.

He t'ns the scales at around 200
! pounds.
Others who have looked good are
Ted Lilenwall, Walt Smith, and Har
| ry Hunt. Lilenwall was on the var
; sity last year. Smith is a converted
end from the Jayvees, and Hunt was
a first stringer on the frosh of last
year.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST battles
next year should come from the men
: seeking a first string tackle berth.
From where this reporter sits,
Gordon White is the best man 011
the field. White is big and aggres
sive. He seems to hit harder than
any other man out at this time.
Gordy played first string tackle for
the frosh last year.
Atherton Pheleger was a first
string man last year but the big
fellow is going to lind it rough going
to claim exclusive ownership of that
position next year. Harry Davison.
Ted Burke, and Terry Walters all
look good at this time.
A1 Rau broke his ankle during
the first two minutes of the first
j game last year and did not see ac
tion again that season. He is not out
for spring football but will be active
again next year. Watch him. He
may be a starter.
(Tomorow The Daily will review
the candidates out for end and
ctnter positions.)


TYPICAL OF THE TYPE OF WORK going on every day on the spring
football practice fields is this scene of two gridders working on a block
ing dummy. On Saturday the footballers will hold their annual big
! spring t crinunage.

Schwartz first issued the call lor spring football drills. Now, in
the words of Schwartz, "We are beginning to shape up."
And shape up they have for the 1948 Big Red Machine is
working in earnest to prepare for the tough 10-game schedule

laid out for next year. i
Although hampered in the past '
weeks by adverse weather, the grid
ders will hold their big spring
scrimmage Saturday. Stands will be
set up and the teams will be decked
out in different colored jerseys. Ray
Hammett will handle the announcing
chores.
From the 115 men out for spring [
practice, 7 appear to be in line for j
the starting guard positions.
AT THIS POINT Bob Rohrer ap
pears to be one of the best men on
the field in the left guard- class.
Rohrer was called to varsity duty
just before the UCLA game last j
season. At that time he was switched
from end to guard and brought up j
from the JV squad. He has shown j
vast improvement in the drills thus I
far this spring. He is a tricky man
imd very deceptive on defense.

| ;
Jack McKittrick worked himself
into the starting left guard slot last
year and was one of the top per
formers in the USC contest. His
class schedule has kept him from
attending many of the practices this
spring. He should be right up there
j next year.
A TIIIRI) CANDIDATE for the
I position, and one that may well
J find himself a starting berth is 200-
pound Don Lucas. Lucas was a first
string guard on the frosh team of
last year. He is big and a stalwart
on defense.
Four men are standouts at right
| guard. Don Fix, who broke into the
! lineup before last year's UCLA tilt,
j seems to be top man here. Fix was
a fullback at Dayton, Washington.
He is fast for a lineman and is
equally good on offense and defense.

He t'ns the scales at around 200
! pounds.
Others who have looked good are
Ted Lilenwall, Walt Smith, and Har
| ry Hunt. Lilenwall was on the var
; sity last year. Smith is a converted
end from the Jayvees, and Hunt was
a first stringer on the frosh of last
year.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST battles
next year should come from the men
: seeking a first string tackle berth.
From where this reporter sits,
Gordon White is the best man 011
the field. White is big and aggres
sive. He seems to hit harder than
any other man out at this time.
Gordy played first string tackle for
the frosh last year.
Atherton Pheleger was a first
string man last year but the big
fellow is going to lind it rough going
to claim exclusive ownership of that
position next year. Harry Davison.
Ted Burke, and Terry Walters all
look good at this time.
A1 Rau broke his ankle during
the first two minutes of the first
j game last year and did not see ac
tion again that season. He is not out
for spring football but will be active
again next year. Watch him. He
may be a starter.
(Tomorow The Daily will review
the candidates out for end and
ctnter positions.)


TYPICAL OF THE TYPE OF WORK going on every day on the spring
football practice fields is this scene of two gridders working on a block
ing dummy. On Saturday the footballers will hold their annual big
! spring t crinunage.
