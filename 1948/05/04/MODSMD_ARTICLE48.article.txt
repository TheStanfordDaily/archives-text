# Cindermen Prep for Cal
## 
### 
With only three full days of prac
tice remaining before the Cal meet,
the varsity tracksters are looking
forward with great anxiety to the
"big" one.
The meet right now looks very
close, and if the Cards come through
and win, they will present their
coach, Jack Weirshauser, with his
first Pacific Coast Conference vic
tory.
There are many events which ap
pear to be extremely close. Before
the Cal-Southern Cal meet last
Saturday, it was even money that
the Indians would place one-two in
the javelin. However, in the latter
meet, Bear Friedenbach heaved
the stick 209 feet, something for
Messrs. Held, Cokcr, and Golds
borough tii think about.
Larry Hofl is looking for revenge
from his last season's defeat in the
quarter mile at the hands of Cal.
Bob Cooper and Jim Lytjen both
looked good last weekend against
the Trojans, as Cooper buried Troy's
Wells DeLoach in a stretch drive.
These two men also form the nu
cleus of a powerful relay team,
which came in just a yard short of
Troy's 3:18.

) Dell Russell ran a 50.6 second re
lay lap against the Bruins last Sat
! urday to help the Indians win that
] event in 3:20. Other members of
the team were A 1 Wilkins. leadoff;
I Pitch Johnson, third iap; and Larry
Hoff, anchor. Whether or not George
Grimes of the Cards will be ready
to run the relay after a tough race
with Cal's Jackson in the half mile,
I is a question yet to be answered.
