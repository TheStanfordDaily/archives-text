## Cards, San Jose Vie 
### 
Hot on the trail of Bronco and
Bear, Stanford's once again potent
baseball club will take a side trip
ihis afternoon to meet the San Jose
State Spartans in San Jose.
The game will have no bearing on
CIBA standings and will serve
mainly as a prep for Saturday's cru
cial contest with California. Stan
ford is on the upclimb now in con
ference standings, and the Cal game
will be all-important in determin
ing just how far the Cards can go.
MATHEMATICALLY, they still
stand a chance of climbing right to
the top of the CIBA ladder. Re
maining on Stanford's CIBA sched
ule are three games with St. Mary's,
single games with Santa Clara and
California, and two tough ones with
the USC Trojans.
Santa Clara trounced St. Mary's
10 to 0 Sunday to tighten its grip
on third spot in the standings, but
the Broncos can be had. Stanford is
just a game behind them, and has
an easier schedule to play during
the rest of the season.
FRANK LA BRUM or Ed Shive
will probably start today for Stan
iord, as the varsity goes to work
against the Spartans. Dave Melton
whose warclub began to sing
against the Bruins, and Charlie Cole
will be expected to lead the batting
attack.
