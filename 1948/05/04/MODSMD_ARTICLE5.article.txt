mer quarter registration in Stan
ford's history, the registrar's office
predicted yesterday. More than
2.000 of the current student body
have indicated already that they
plan to attend.
In anticipation of the heavy en
rollment, University officials an
nounced housing plans for the June
17 to August 28 period.
NEW LOWER DIVISION men
and returning freshmen will room
and board at Encina. Other under
graduate and graduate men may
room at either Toyon or Encina, but
undergraduates who choose to room
at Encina will also board there.
Graduates may board there if they
choose, declared Shelton Beatty,
men's counselor.
Siiouil further space for men be

needed, other facilities will be used,
including Stanford Village, Beatty
said.
Miss Anastasia Doyle, associate
counselor for women, said that
freshman women will be housed in
Union Residence.
OTHER UNDERGRADUATE
women will be housed in Madrono,
Casa Ventura, and Mariposa. All
undergraduate women will eat in
the Union dining room.
Because of the heavy schedule of
conferences, a burden will be placed
on University housing, Bealty as
serted. For that reason Lagunita
Court will be turned over to "on
ference personnel throughout most
of the quarter.
Roble Hall also will be used for
conference personnel from June 17
to July 5.
