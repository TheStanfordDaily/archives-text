# SF, Angels Share Lead
## 
### BY CRAYTON JONES 
The PCL season enters its sixth
week tonight, and the league lead
is ortce again shared by the same
two clubs which finished the '47
season in a dead heat. Only .015
percentage points separate the Seals
and Angels while the Oaks trail by
two full games.
Irate Padre fans, seemingly con
vinced that Paul Fagan, Seal owner,
had attempted to eliminate their
club from the league, gave the Seals
a raucous reception in the South
land. Despite the atmosphere of
bitterness, the O'Doulmen managed
to pull through with a 4-3 series
win.
AS USUAL, the caliber of Seal
pitching fluctuated from fair lo poor.
Lefthanders Cliff Melton and Bill
Werle both came through with cred
itable performances as did Manny
Perez, who managed to last beyond
the first inning for a change. Lucky
Jack Brewer was blasted on two oc
casions, but relief artist, Con Demp
sey, saved one game for him as he
cut short a Padre rally.
Unreliable Bob Joyce started
throwing home run balls again, so
he was yanked Saturday after pitch
ing only one inning.
TIIE OAKS passed up a chance
to gain on the leaders as they were
only able to gain an even split of
their six-game series with the Rain
iers. Right now the Acorns are
plagued by injuries. Nick Etten has
a bruised left arm, and Dario Van
Robays at first base in place of Et
ten; Maurice is a good hitter, but
his fielding leaves much to be de
sired.
However, Stengel is encouraged by
the fact that Les Scarsella is round
ing into shape, and Les will make
the trip to Sacramento this week.
PORTLAND is in the midst of an
early season slump, having dropped
10 out of their last 11 games. Fail
ure to hit in the clutch has defeated
the Beavers on numerous occasions.
Last week Hajlywood took 5 out of
(3 from the luckless northerners
which boosts the Stars into a fourth
place tie with San Diego.
Sacramento maintained their lowly
position in the standings by drop
ping their series to Los Angeles 5
games to 1. Two of the Angel wins
were by a 1-0 count as Red Adams
and Walt Lanfranconi turned in
whitewash jobs.
This week's activity finds Portland
at San Francisco, Oakland at Sac
ramento, San Diego at Seattle, and
Los Angeles at Hollywood.

The PCL season enters its sixth
week tonight, and the league lead
is ortce again shared by the same
two clubs which finished the '47
season in a dead heat. Only .015
percentage points separate the Seals
and Angels while the Oaks trail by
two full games.
Irate Padre fans, seemingly con
vinced that Paul Fagan, Seal owner,
had attempted to eliminate their
club from the league, gave the Seals
a raucous reception in the South
land. Despite the atmosphere of
bitterness, the O'Doulmen managed
to pull through with a 4-3 series
win.
AS USUAL, the caliber of Seal
pitching fluctuated from fair lo poor.
Lefthanders Cliff Melton and Bill
Werle both came through with cred
itable performances as did Manny
Perez, who managed to last beyond
the first inning for a change. Lucky
Jack Brewer was blasted on two oc
casions, but relief artist, Con Demp
sey, saved one game for him as he
cut short a Padre rally.
Unreliable Bob Joyce started
throwing home run balls again, so
he was yanked Saturday after pitch
ing only one inning.
TIIE OAKS passed up a chance
to gain on the leaders as they were
only able to gain an even split of
their six-game series with the Rain
iers. Right now the Acorns are
plagued by injuries. Nick Etten has
a bruised left arm, and Dario Van
Robays at first base in place of Et
ten; Maurice is a good hitter, but
his fielding leaves much to be de
sired.
However, Stengel is encouraged by
the fact that Les Scarsella is round
ing into shape, and Les will make
the trip to Sacramento this week.
PORTLAND is in the midst of an
early season slump, having dropped
10 out of their last 11 games. Fail
ure to hit in the clutch has defeated
the Beavers on numerous occasions.
Last week Hajlywood took 5 out of
(3 from the luckless northerners
which boosts the Stars into a fourth
place tie with San Diego.
Sacramento maintained their lowly
position in the standings by drop
ping their series to Los Angeles 5
games to 1. Two of the Angel wins
were by a 1-0 count as Red Adams
and Walt Lanfranconi turned in
whitewash jobs.
This week's activity finds Portland
at San Francisco, Oakland at Sac
ramento, San Diego at Seattle, and
Los Angeles at Hollywood.
