### 
Mike Durket gave up only one
hit as he led the DU nine to a 12
to 2 victory over the Theta Chi
squad in an intramural softball game
yesterday. Durket was stingy with
Theta Chi batters while his team
mates slugged the opposing pitcher
for 12 big runs.
In League II John Dreyfuss was
nicked for three runs but held a
sale margin as the Kappa Alpha
team blasted Phi Psi 11, 12 to 3. Red
Machine and Phi Delt I held a slug-

in the last inning when a rally put
across three runs before the Phi
Sigs could put out the lire.
Viilage 312 played tight defensive
ball to nip the Village 253 nine 8
fest with the Machine coming out
on top by a 13 to 9 count.
Smacking out five runs in the first
inning the Phi Sig squad went on
to defeat El Toro 11 to 4. El Toro
threatened to make it a game only

to 1 in League 111. In another 1
League 111 game Lyle Hoeft of Vil- i
lage 117 weakened in the last two |
frames to give up seven runs, but !
his squad suppiled heavy stick work j
as the Villagers trounced El Campo i
11 to 7.
In volleyball play Theta Chi II de- j
feated the Phi Delt Peacocks 15 to 7 j
and 15 to 10. Phi Psi volleyballers i
bounced the Kappa Sigs, and Village !
210 won from Village 212 by for- !
feit.
