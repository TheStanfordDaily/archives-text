# Summer Study Abroad Okayed for Veterans
## 
### 
Veterans now attending American
colleges during the regular school
year under the GI Bill who desire
to study abroad during the summer
must meet the following require
ments:
1. The veteran must obtain a letter
of acceptance from the VA-approved
foreign school he plans to attend.
2. Next, he must secure a supple
ment certificate of eligibility from
his VA regional office.
3. THE STUDENT uses the let
ter of acccptance and supplemental
certificate as evidence in securing
the necessary passports and visas
from the State Department author
izing his travel to the foreign school.
Students have to pay all transpor
tation costs.
Students are urged by the VA to
attend approved schools in foreign
countries that are served by an At
tache of Veterans Affairs. Countries
served by attaches include Great
Britain, Mexico, France, Switzer
land (no visa required), Italy, Nor
way, Sweden, Denmark, and Bel
gium.
IF A STUDENT attends a school
in one of these countries, his records
do not have to be transferred from
the United States. Attendance in
countries other than those listed in
volves a considerable time consumed

in the transfer of the veteran's rec
ords. This results in a delay in the
receipt of subsistence checks.
Interested veterans may obtain in
formation on foreign schools ap
proved by the VA by writing their
regional office or the Director of
Registration and Research, Vocation
al Rehabilitation and Education
Service. Veterans Administration,
Washington 25, D. C.
