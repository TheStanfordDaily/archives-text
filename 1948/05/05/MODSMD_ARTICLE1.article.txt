COLUMBUS. May 4 (UP). â€”
Sen. Robert A. Taft tonight was
beating back the threat to his
national prestige made by Har
old E. Stassen on the basis of
latest returns from the Ohio

Inconclusive returns at midnight
gave Taft a total of 48 delegates
and Stassen five. Thirty delegates
pledged to Taft were not contested
by the former Minnesota Governor.
In the statewide showing of
strength, Taft's nine candidates for
delegates -at - large were outdis
tancing the single entry made by
Stassen.
Carrinton T. Marshall, former
state supreme court justice pledged
to Stassen, received 12.69G votes
from 577 of the state's 9,385 pre
cincts. The low Taft delegate in the
list of ten had 13,631 and the top
Taft man received 17.084 votes.
Stassen had predicted that he
would win a majority of the 23 can
didates he entered in the state and
that his single-shot for delegate-at
large would run in the top four. The
top nine of ten candidates for dele
gate-at-large will be elected.
