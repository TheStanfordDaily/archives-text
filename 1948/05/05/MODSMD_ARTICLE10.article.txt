# Greek Chaos Entangles US
## 
### 
America today has become so
deeply involved in the political af
fairs of Greece that any attempt to
withdraw would prove far more dif
ficult than our original moves to ex
tend aid to that country.
So said Dr. Hazel D. Hansen, Stan
ford professor of classics, last night
on the Tuesday Evening Series.
Her lecture on "The Greek Dilem
ma" was given before an audience
of over 500 in Memorial Auditorium.
Few people realize the extent of
actual fighting in Greece." she said.
"There can be no compromise in this
war; either the right or the leftist j
forces must be completely triumph- ;
ant and both sides will yield only
to actual defeat by arms."
Economic aid and then military |
aid have proved ineffective against j
the continuing successes of leftist ;
guerrilla forces and now it has be- j
come necessary for the United States i
to enter into the political affairs oi j
Greece, Dr. Hansen said.
"We cannot afford not to interfere
with Greek government in order to
help it to its feet again," she as
serted. "The forces we support are
poorly organized while guerrilla
armies have achieved a remarkable j
degree of coordination."
Our job, she said, is first to help
in the defeat of communist-sup- j
ported guerrilla forces waging all- |
out war against the peasants of the
country and then to aid in the for- j
mation of a healthy and dynamic j
Greek government.
