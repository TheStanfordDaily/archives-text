Political freedom is a popular cause.
When the cry went up a few months ago that Stanford's po
litical freedom was being usurped by the decision that political
action groups may not meet on campus, opponents of the decision
found a ready group of adherents.
The opposition had valid reasons; these reasons have been
aired both in The Daily and during the recent campaigns.
The Administration, namely the Board of Trustees which has
the final say in this case, also has reasons which should be given
a hearing.
This is the case for the Administration as presented by Dr.
Lawrence Kimpton, dean of students. These are the reasons:
"(1) What is the purpose of an educational institution? The
answer is obviously to supply education, including an education
in politics. The primary interest of political action groups is
propaganda, not education. They are trying to 'sell Taft, Wallace,
or Truman.'
"(2) Student political groups are under pressure to be used
as a 'front' for outside organizations, which have their own drums
to beat. They must constantly fight against becoming the mouth
piece of a more powerful, less scrupulous body.
"(3) Stanford University might unwittingly be committed to
a political stand by one of these student groups. For example,
were a huge rally held for Taft on the campus, reports would
appear in the city papers that Stanford, not a group of students,
had come out in favor of the Ohio Senator. Stanford cannot afford
io be tied in politically in the ptiblic eye with either the extreme
right dr left.
"In other universities such vague tie-ins have led to investi
gations that have cost the universities millions of dollars in costs
and lost endowments. Stanford is not financially rich; it could
not afford an investigation."
These are the views of the Administration; these are the rea
sons that led to abolishing political groups from the campus.
