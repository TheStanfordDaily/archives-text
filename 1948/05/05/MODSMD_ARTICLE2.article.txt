### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., May 4 (UP)
â€” Anti - Truman convention dele
gates and electors took the lead in
first returns from the Democratic
primary tonight, but strong "loy
alty" candidates were cutting down
their margin.
At the same time. Gov. James E.
Folsom was taking an indirect ,; ck
iug. His endorsed candidates fo-
U.S. Senator and national commit
teeman trailed badly. Folsom him
self was well back in the scramble
for a delegate-at-large post.
In the first Southern ballot en
dorsement of the Dixie revolt
against President Truman, delegate
at-large candidates pleged to bolt
against a civil rights platform placed
five men among the eight leaders.
In the race for the 11 Electoral
College seats, however, all 11 lead
ers were pledged to vote against
Mr. Truman or any other civil
rights nominee, according to the
-arly returns.
