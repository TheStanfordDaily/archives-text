# Convalescing Children Enjoy Farm
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Ice cream cones each Wednesday and
a "picnic supper" every Tuesday eve
ning — these are as important in the
lives of 80 youngsters at the Stanford
Convalescent Home as a Sunday movie
or a Saturday track meet is to the Farm's
8,000 roughs and coeds.
Nowhere in the state do convalescing
children have as favorable an environ
ment as on the Stanford campus.
The Stanford Convalescent Home,
founded in 1919 and incorporated in
1924, has seen the necessity of a well
rounded program of recuperation. Its
purpose is to provide nursing care,
medical services, and instruction for
convalescent children.
The "Con Home," as it is appropri
ately referred to by the Encina "con
victs" who are sent there to work
hours," is a compact organism made
up of four units: three stucco and tile
children's units and, in the center of
activity, Senator Stanford's old three
story mansion now serving as office
building, library, and nurses' guarters.
Staffed by about 40 paid attendants
including nurses, ward-helpers, house
mothers, kitchen help, and janitors, the
Home is a virtual haven of sunshine and
recovery to the pale and sickly who
come there largely from San Francisco
and the Bay Area.
' They're brown as berries in the sum
mer time," said Miss June Bengtson,
Supervising Head Nurse, "and with the

weight they put on it's no wonder their
parents fail to recognize them when vis
iting days come around."
"An occupational therapist is contin
ually on the job devising new and more
interesting ways of play for the kids,"
she explained. "To neglect the mental
disposition of the child and his interest
in constructive play is to prolong and
even defeat, in some cases, physical
recovery."
In connection with this, she men
tioned that the children have a rhythm
band of their own, a tree house for the
girls, a boys' club house, and a life
sized model of a three-room home in
which the youngsters may "play real
house."
Not only has the Home achieved
fame for its Cub Scout and Brownie
packs, but it has also attained promi
nence for its rhythm band. When the
Stanford Band serenades the Home
later this week, the rhythm band is
slated fo return with a short number.
The children, who have illnesses
ranging from rheumatic fever to mal
nutrition, are selected for admission by
the Home's social worker in co-opera
tion with the child's parents.
Upon this initial approval, the child's
application then goes to the medical
director of the Home who must pass on
final admission before the entrant is
placed on the waiting list.
"There always seems to be a waiting
list," Miss Bengtson explained, "and it

is our goal to expand the Convalescent
Home as much as possible to accommo
date the pressing need."
Once the child has entered the Home,
k he is assigned to a life of comparative
seclusion for the rest of his stay. People
may visit him but, for protective rea
sons, he is not allowed to go home for
Christmas or for vacation.
Ordinarily, children are not allowed
to stay at the Home more than a year.
They usually have achieved, in that
time, the maximum amount of benefit
attainable from this type of environ
ment.
While at the Home, the child loses
out neither on schooling nor on medical
care. A teacher is present for four
hours each day. Credited pediatricians
and dentists donate their services free
of charge, visiting the patients regularly
and in case of emergency.
A dentist for the Home has doubled
as Santa Claus for the kids for some
15 years.
Financially, the Convalescent Home is
run entirely on a charitable basis. Main
contributors include the ASSU, Menlo
Circus Club, San Francisco Community
Chest, Elks Club, Rotary Club, and var
ious women's auxiliaries on the Penin
sula.
Cost for one bed per year runs to
approximately SI,8C0; the ASSU appro
priates $7,200 in its capacity as donor
for four of the beds.
Other smaller contributors are scat

tered throughout the state, and many
give regularly to support what is gener
ally considered "the finest convalescent
home of its type in the state."
In response to one such generous
contribution, one small boy wrote:
"Dear Friends:
"I am writing to thank you for the
gifts you have made us of large stuffed
toys and dolls.
"We have the great big stuffed cub
bear all dressed up in a Cub Scout's
uniform, and he is our Den Mascot. He
comes to all our Cub meetings, and he
makes a good Cub Scout.
"With many thanks for your kind
ness,
"Your friend,
"WALTER
"Den Chief, Cub Pack 51, BSA."
The Home has received countless let
ters from grateful parents who have
noted improvements in their children
after a stay at the Home. Excerpts from
three such letters follow:
"If my boy continues as well as ho is
now, I can assure you I'll have nothing
but praise for the Convalescent Heme."
"We remember with very deep appre
ciation not only the comfort and care
given your children, but the love end
security they seem to feel while in
your care. It is wonderful work you
are doing."
"... I have heard nothing but the
highest ox praises for the excellent work
the Home does with children."

Ice cream cones each Wednesday and
a "picnic supper" every Tuesday eve
ning — these are as important in the
lives of 80 youngsters at the Stanford
Convalescent Home as a Sunday movie
or a Saturday track meet is to the Farm's
8,000 roughs and coeds.
Nowhere in the state do convalescing
children have as favorable an environ
ment as on the Stanford campus.
The Stanford Convalescent Home,
founded in 1919 and incorporated in
1924, has seen the necessity of a well
rounded program of recuperation. Its
purpose is to provide nursing care,
medical services, and instruction for
convalescent children.
The "Con Home," as it is appropri
ately referred to by the Encina "con
victs" who are sent there to work
hours," is a compact organism made
up of four units: three stucco and tile
children's units and, in the center of
activity, Senator Stanford's old three
story mansion now serving as office
building, library, and nurses' guarters.
Staffed by about 40 paid attendants
including nurses, ward-helpers, house
mothers, kitchen help, and janitors, the
Home is a virtual haven of sunshine and
recovery to the pale and sickly who
come there largely from San Francisco
and the Bay Area.
' They're brown as berries in the sum
mer time," said Miss June Bengtson,
Supervising Head Nurse, "and with the

weight they put on it's no wonder their
parents fail to recognize them when vis
iting days come around."
"An occupational therapist is contin
ually on the job devising new and more
interesting ways of play for the kids,"
she explained. "To neglect the mental
disposition of the child and his interest
in constructive play is to prolong and
even defeat, in some cases, physical
recovery."
In connection with this, she men
tioned that the children have a rhythm
band of their own, a tree house for the
girls, a boys' club house, and a life
sized model of a three-room home in
which the youngsters may "play real
house."
Not only has the Home achieved
fame for its Cub Scout and Brownie
packs, but it has also attained promi
nence for its rhythm band. When the
Stanford Band serenades the Home
later this week, the rhythm band is
slated fo return with a short number.
The children, who have illnesses
ranging from rheumatic fever to mal
nutrition, are selected for admission by
the Home's social worker in co-opera
tion with the child's parents.
Upon this initial approval, the child's
application then goes to the medical
director of the Home who must pass on
final admission before the entrant is
placed on the waiting list.
"There always seems to be a waiting
list," Miss Bengtson explained, "and it

is our goal to expand the Convalescent
Home as much as possible to accommo
date the pressing need."
Once the child has entered the Home,
k he is assigned to a life of comparative
seclusion for the rest of his stay. People
may visit him but, for protective rea
sons, he is not allowed to go home for
Christmas or for vacation.
Ordinarily, children are not allowed
to stay at the Home more than a year.
They usually have achieved, in that
time, the maximum amount of benefit
attainable from this type of environ
ment.
While at the Home, the child loses
out neither on schooling nor on medical
care. A teacher is present for four
hours each day. Credited pediatricians
and dentists donate their services free
of charge, visiting the patients regularly
and in case of emergency.
A dentist for the Home has doubled
as Santa Claus for the kids for some
15 years.
Financially, the Convalescent Home is
run entirely on a charitable basis. Main
contributors include the ASSU, Menlo
Circus Club, San Francisco Community
Chest, Elks Club, Rotary Club, and var
ious women's auxiliaries on the Penin
sula.
Cost for one bed per year runs to
approximately SI,8C0; the ASSU appro
priates $7,200 in its capacity as donor
for four of the beds.
Other smaller contributors are scat

tered throughout the state, and many
give regularly to support what is gener
ally considered "the finest convalescent
home of its type in the state."

after a stay at the Home. Excerpts from
three such letters follow:
"If my boy continues as well as ho is

but praise for the Convalescent Heme."
"We remember with very deep appre

"... I have heard nothing but the

Ice cream cones each Wednesday and
a "picnic supper" every Tuesday eve
ning — these are as important in the
lives of 80 youngsters at the Stanford
Convalescent Home as a Sunday movie
or a Saturday track meet is to the Farm's
8,000 roughs and coeds.
Nowhere in the state do convalescing
children have as favorable an environ
ment as on the Stanford campus.
The Stanford Convalescent Home,
founded in 1919 and incorporated in
1924, has seen the necessity of a well
rounded program of recuperation. Its
purpose is to provide nursing care,
medical services, and instruction for
convalescent children.
The "Con Home," as it is appropri
ately referred to by the Encina "con
victs" who are sent there to work
hours," is a compact organism made
up of four units: three stucco and tile
children's units and, in the center of
activity, Senator Stanford's old three
story mansion now serving as office
building, library, and nurses' guarters.
Staffed by about 40 paid attendants
including nurses, ward-helpers, house
mothers, kitchen help, and janitors, the
Home is a virtual haven of sunshine and
recovery to the pale and sickly who
come there largely from San Francisco
and the Bay Area.
' They're brown as berries in the sum
mer time," said Miss June Bengtson,
Supervising Head Nurse, "and with the

weight they put on it's no wonder their
parents fail to recognize them when vis
iting days come around."
"An occupational therapist is contin
ually on the job devising new and more
interesting ways of play for the kids,"
she explained. "To neglect the mental
disposition of the child and his interest
in constructive play is to prolong and
even defeat, in some cases, physical
recovery."
In connection with this, she men
tioned that the children have a rhythm
band of their own, a tree house for the
girls, a boys' club house, and a life
sized model of a three-room home in
which the youngsters may "play real
house."
Not only has the Home achieved
fame for its Cub Scout and Brownie
packs, but it has also attained promi
nence for its rhythm band. When the
Stanford Band serenades the Home
later this week, the rhythm band is
slated fo return with a short number.
The children, who have illnesses
ranging from rheumatic fever to mal
nutrition, are selected for admission by
the Home's social worker in co-opera
tion with the child's parents.
Upon this initial approval, the child's
application then goes to the medical
director of the Home who must pass on
final admission before the entrant is
placed on the waiting list.
"There always seems to be a waiting
list," Miss Bengtson explained, "and it

is our goal to expand the Convalescent
Home as much as possible to accommo
date the pressing need."
Once the child has entered the Home,
k he is assigned to a life of comparative
seclusion for the rest of his stay. People
may visit him but, for protective rea
sons, he is not allowed to go home for
Christmas or for vacation.
Ordinarily, children are not allowed
to stay at the Home more than a year.
They usually have achieved, in that
time, the maximum amount of benefit
attainable from this type of environ
ment.
