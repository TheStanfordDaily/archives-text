# Con Home Helps Children, Spreads Fun and Good Will
## 
### BY JIM HAGGART 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
is typical of Stanford. It is a "fam
ily" affair—a blend of service and
fun, a fruit of someone's good ideas
taken up spontaneously by effective
volunteers with good will.
Before 1917. Dr. Charles D. Gard
ner, known to almost everyone as
the "Padre," organized students into
a social corps. In their free time,
this group went to San Francisco
clinics to assist children there. Be
lieving that mqny of the patients

were discharged too early from these
, institutions, the "Padre" proposed a
two-month summer camp on the
! Stanford campus.
Immediately, Dr. Gardner was
gratified to find that he had an
army of supporters who dickered
for the Stanford Isolation Hospital,
! and gathered from their friends
fresh garden vegetables and fruit to
j supplement the youngsters' diets.
TIIE NEXT SUMMER the "home"
i was moved to the foot of Cooksey
lane, the present Phi Sigma Kappa
' house. Twenty children summered
j there, with a cook and one volun
j teer mother supervising them.
| In 1910 the home set up house
; keeping in its present form and site,
j and every year expanded along the
line of its original purpose.
By 1920 it had increased its capac
ity to 20 beds, and was under the
I direction of one graduate nurse and
J her staff.
The McLaughlin unit was donated
in 1923 by Mrs. Henry J. Crocker.
It now houses 20 beds in the main
j ward, and seven additional beds in
the admission ward, which was
added in 1928. In her will, Mrs.
! Harry Babcock left $4,000 for an
| other unit which was •completed in
1928. The final unit was donated
!
J by the Ladies Auxiliary Board in
: 1929, and now accommodates 30 chil
dren.
TIIE CONVALESCENT HOME in
augurated a summer school pro
i gram with two teachers in 1929, and
! every year since the Bay Area chil
dren have participated in the eight
i week course. The cost of the pro
j gram is defrayed by the school dis-
I trict from which the individual pu
| pil comes, and the course is super
i vised by the Palo Alto Board of
I Education.
Thirteen student nurses from the
i Stanford University School of Nurs
ing serve each year at the Conval
escent Home for a period of one
month each. At the home, they ac
quire experience in advanced pedi
atries work and take a course which
includes six lectures, assigned read
i ing, administrative experience, new
' nursing techniques, and new case
studies.
IN RECENT YEARS, the Conval
| escent Home has employed a full —
J term medical social worker, who
| makes personal visits to the homes
! of children who are recovering, and

advises parents on the child's prog
ress. The Home also employs an
occupational therapist on a full-time
basis and a part-time visiting medi
cal staff.
Now. more than 45 of the 80 pa
tients are suffering from rheumatic
fever, which demands a great deal
of special care. Since there are so
few institutions offering this serv
ice, the Convalescent Home has a
long waiting list.

The Stanford Convalescent Home
is typical of Stanford. It is a "fam
ily" affair—a blend of service and
fun, a fruit of someone's good ideas
taken up spontaneously by effective
volunteers with good will.
Before 1917. Dr. Charles D. Gard
ner, known to almost everyone as
the "Padre," organized students into
a social corps. In their free time,
this group went to San Francisco
clinics to assist children there. Be
lieving that mqny of the patients

were discharged too early from these
, institutions, the "Padre" proposed a
two-month summer camp on the
! Stanford campus.
Immediately, Dr. Gardner was
gratified to find that he had an
army of supporters who dickered
for the Stanford Isolation Hospital,
! and gathered from their friends
fresh garden vegetables and fruit to
j supplement the youngsters' diets.
TIIE NEXT SUMMER the "home"
i was moved to the foot of Cooksey
lane, the present Phi Sigma Kappa
' house. Twenty children summered
j there, with a cook and one volun
j teer mother supervising them.

; keeping in its present form and site,
j and every year expanded along the
line of its original purpose.
