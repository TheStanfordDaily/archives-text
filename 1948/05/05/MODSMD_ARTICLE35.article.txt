Stanford's annual Sophomore
Carnival has not always been staged
to raise funds for the Convalescent
Home children, nor has it always
been held in the spring.
In the fall quarter of 1930 the
first Carnival was held in the Pa
vilion. The "Five Hundred" women
sponsored the affair to raise funds
for furnishing the new Women's
Gym.
A PARADE OF CARS, led by a
student orchestra, aroused enthu
siasm on the morning of the event.
The Carnival itself featured a bur
lesque by freshman women, a mys
tery maze, and tea at 10 cents a cup.
In 1932, a depression year, the

Carnival was held to raise money
for student relief.
A chuck-a-luck table, imported
from Reno, quick sketch caricatures,
and numerous games of chance
were added. The net profit was $443.
THE CARNIVAL came back on
campus in 1936 following a two-year
layoff, and was held spring quarter
\ instead of fall quarter. Taxi danc
ing and ringing the necks of wild
ducks with -hoops were two of the
| concessions which helped the Car
nival make $450.
Multi-colored beetles added in
i terest in the 1937 Carnival. Ten
! green beetles and one red one were
' placed in a pan. The trick was to
I snag the one red beetle with a me-
I chanicaliy operated paper cup. The
profits that year went to the Con
valescent Home.
A MODEL T FORD was raffled
ofT during the 1938 Carnival, and
> customers threw baseballs at a
i target which, when hit, ducked fra
j ternity pledges in icy water. The
successful Carnival netted $900 that
year.
Last year a mystery house, tur
tle races, and pie throwing were
among the popular concessions, and
profits for the Convalescent Home
reached an all-time high of $1,300.
A record student enrollment in
dicates record student participation
this year. "Indians Play so Papoose
May" is the slogan and Carnival
â–  goers are assured they will receive
ample entertainment at the vari
ous concessions.
