# AND THE BAND PLAYED ON
## 
### 
'"All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy," decided Farm stu
dents in li) 21 during Labor Day. So
after putting in a hard day's work
over at the Convalescent Home, the
Stanford roughs and maidens leaned
back, enjoyed a barbecue dinner,
and heard original skits presented
by Roble women. An original song
hit was also introduced. During
the day, the band played.
