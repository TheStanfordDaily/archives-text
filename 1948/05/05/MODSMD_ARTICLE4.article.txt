# Nation Faces Labor Crisis
## 
### 
CHICAGO. May 4 (UP).—One of
the nation's worst labor crises
loomed tonight as government me
diation efforts in the impending na
tional railroad strike collapsed.
A strike of 130,000 railroad engi
neers, firemen, and switchmen has
been set for Tuesday. A walkout
would virtually paralyze rail trans
port in the country.
Meanwhile, the eight-week strike
of CIO packinghouse workers
against major meat firms spread to
independent plants.
Another major strike date was
set for Wednesday against Chrysler
Corp.
In Wisconsin alone, more than
16,000 unionists either were on
strike or preparing to strike in the
automobile, brewery, meat pack
ing, painting, and wholesale gro
cery industries.
At Evansville, Ind.. a steel com
pany refused to deal with the CIO
Electrical Workers' Union on the
grounds that it was "communist
dominated." Officials of the Bucy
rus-Erie Steel Co. said they believed
they were the first to take such
action.
A national telephone strike threat
was all but eliminated by a union
decision to exhaust all possible bar
gaining procedure, but a strike of
22,000 long distance operators Sun
day remained a possibility.

WASHINGTON. May 4 (UP) —
The government is studying the
possibility of seizing the railroads to
avert the strike set for Tuesday, it
was disclosed today.
Seizure would take place under
a law signed in 1916 by President
Woodrow Wilson vesting him with
authority to take over the lines ' in
time of war."
Justice Department lawyers are
said to feel the statute is still good
because President Truman has not
yet proclaimed the end of World
War 11. Thus the nation technically
is still at war.
