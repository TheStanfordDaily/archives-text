# End Positions Look Strong This Season
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Take five or six familiar faces, mix thoroughly with JC transfers,
and you have the situation that faces the gentleman who will
choose the starting ends for the 1948 Stanford football team.
The end position cannot help but be stronger next year. As it
appears now, not one of the varsity ends will be missing when

the San Jose State game starts the 1
season.
DAN MERVIN. Gene Martin, and
Bob Ghilotti alternated at the start
ing slot last year. The first two
men are out tor spring practice I
now, although Mervin just gave up
baseball togs for football gear. Ghil
otti is out for track but will be on j
hand next year.
If Marchie Schwartz has one
strong position, the end spot may
be it. He can alternate by sets it' i
he so wishes; two men for defense
and another brace for offense with
out either phase of play suffering.
Martin and Mervin are rated as I
the best offensive brace, but Ghilotti j
can well be figured to draw the nod
for defensive duties. Bob Childs saw
a lot of action last year and should
play a lot of defense next year. He
is a crasher. Offensively he just
doesn't get those signals down cor- j
reetly.
Two junior college men are on
hand at this time that cannot be
dealt out. Ken Rose from Modesto
JC is the big rangy type of end
who excels on spot passes as well as \
the long ones. He gets in the cen
ter. the ball is thrown, and whoof! j
it disappears in his arms â€”five yards
gained.
DON ENBURG. product of Stock
ton JC, is a fellow who is going j
to give the old timers a rough time
of it. He is light on his feet and
recovers well from the initial blocks.
He is a good hand fighter.
A 1 Laakso, up from the junior
varsity, has looked good thus far.
He has drawn a starting jaosition
in Saturday's scrimmage. He is also i
quick on his feet and can recover ;
fast enough to catch outside runners. (
Earl Stites is another jayvee man
up for a try on the varsity.
THREE FRESHMEN, all big and
tough, provide a good reserve force.
It is doubtful that any one of them
can crack the first string next year.
Give them time to develop and watch
out. Two Toms, Vasilatos and Au
gust, were starters on Chuck Tay
lor's frosh of this year. Bob Scott
also saw a lot of action on that team.
(Tomorrow: Centers and lull
backs.)
