## Crew Gets Free Meals 
### 
Rickey's and Motley's have of
fered their services to the Stanford
crew in the form of a training table
which will furnish the crewmen
with three properly-proportioned
mealsâ€”free of charge, according to
Bob Setrakian, crew captain.
Rickey's will feed 34 oarsmen,
which include those in the varsity,
jayvee, and freshmen shells, on
Thursday and Friday night while
Motley's will furnish breakfast on
Saturday morning before the crew
departs for Berkeley and the "Big
Race" with Cal.
Long workouts have been the rule
thus far this week as the boys at
tempt to get rid of the kinks ac
quired during the long trip south.
The workouts during the remainder
of the week will stress racing starts
and time trials.
A race with USC has been tenta
tively scheduled for May 15 when
the Trojans will make the trip north.
The Stanford jayvee crew defeated
the Trojan varsity last Saturday in
Los Angeles.
