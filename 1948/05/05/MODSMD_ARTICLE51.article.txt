# '57 Tennismen Looking Good
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis squad
has been burning up the courts in
recent matches. The marked im
provement in form during the sea
son presents a winning team that
will show no mercy for the four re
maining opponents.
Their next match against Stockton
JC scheduled for today has been
postponed until next Wednesday.
The ruthlessness of the tennismen
is almost a byword after the last two
lopsided wins over the University of
California frosh and Monterey Union
High School.
The match last Saturday humbled
the Golden Bears in a whitewash,
9 to 0. Since Cal was the only con
ference school to encounter our eight
freshman dependables, the victory
was.the most important this year.
Just two weeks ago the freshman
team visited Monterey Union High
School and a team packed with for
mer boys' league champions. Our
men showed their disdain by slip
ping Monterey an 8 to 0 loss.
This week the squad is testing
for position in the hotly contested
tennis ladder. The number one posi
tion is ably guarded by Dick Me
chem, brother to varsity number
one, Kirk Mechem.
Close behind Mechem are Vincent
Schmeider, Adidson Appleby, John
Huneke, Bruce Taft. and Bob Seder
holm.
