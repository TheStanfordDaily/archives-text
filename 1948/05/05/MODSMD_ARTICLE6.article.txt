# Deposits Go Up $15 In Autumn
## 
### 
Room deposit fees for men's res
idences will be increased from SlO
to $25 for autumn quarter, it was
announced yesterday by Dean of
Students Lawrence Kimpton.
The reason for the deposit fee in
crease, the dean explained, is that
an unreasonably large number of
students have forfeited their $10 fee
without notifying the University
they did not intend to occupy the
space.
This was unfair to other students
who were refused housing tied up
by persons who later forfeited fees.
Dean Kimpton said he hopes that
the higher deposit, which is refund
ed at the time a student withdraws
from University residence, will cut
down forfeitures and make housing
allocation more efficient and fair.
The present $10 fee will be cred
ited toward the $25 deposit for au
tumn quarter, necessitating an ad
ditional payment of only $15 for
those men students now occupying
University residences.
The new fee, which corresponds
to that charged by most other uni
versities, will standardize the de
posits for all University residences.
Women students have paid a $25
deposit for many years.
Students now in University res
idence who plan to attend Stanford
this summer quarter, but will not
be here in the fall, can transfer
their present $10 fee. The increased
deposit is applicable only for stu
dents planning to be here in the
fall.
Under a decentralized plan of
room applications and deposits in
augurated this quarter, summer and
fall applications and deposits for

May 17-18, Village residents; May
13, Toyon residents; and May 19,
Encina residents.
