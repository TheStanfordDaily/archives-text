# Coins Begin To Fill Farm's Hollow Leg
## 
### 
The mannikin leg in front of the
Cellar is beginning to look more
healthy as copper coins gleamed
through its transparent ankle last
night.
'We want to fill the leg with
pennies right up to its red garter,"
said Pat Murphy, chairman of the
Copper Coin Collection.
Friday night, after the leg is
filled, it will become a penny
guessing concession at the all
campus Sophomore Carnival.
