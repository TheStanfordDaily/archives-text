SEOUL. Korea, May 5 (UP) â€”
Two powerful right-wing political
leaders from South Korea announced
today that they had reached an
agreement with the North Korean
communist government on forma- j
tion of a unified, independent state.
The agreement defied American
occupation policy and was likely to
affect the United Nations-sponsored
elections in South Korea set for next
j Monday.
The rightists, Kim Koo and Kimm
Kiu Sic, who was hand-picked by
American occupation authorities as |
president of the South Korean in- j
terim legislature, said the Korean
communist government agreed to a
five-point program which included
the withdrawal of American and
! Soviet troops from Korea.
Earlier today, U. S. Military Gov
ernor Lt. Gen. John R. Hodge flatly
rejected a communist suggestion that
American troops withdraw immed- i
I iately.
"There is every reason to believe
that if such a withdrawal were car
! ried out as demanded, the North
i Korean communist army and its
; horde of power-hungry camp fol
lowers and stooges already selected
j and trained for the job would take
I control of the rest of the nation," :
i Hodge said.
