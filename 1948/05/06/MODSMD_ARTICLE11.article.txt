### 
WASHINGTON. May 5 (UP)
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall and Warren R. Austin warned
Congress today that elimination of
the Big-Power veto in the United
Nations would destroy the world
peace organization.
They told the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee that the widening
breach between Russia and the
United States can not be closed by
tampering with the UN Charter, as
proposed by some House members.
Austin, chief American delegate to
the UN. said that unanimity among
the major world powers is "the one
essential" to a real peace.
He predicted the Soviets would
veto any attempt to rewrite the
charter. And if the revisions were
forced upon them by a majority vote,
he said, they probably would quit
UN altogether, and "a complete
break between the East and West
would occur."
Austin recommended instead that
Congress work to strengthen the
world body within the existing char
ter; that the United States
strengthen its own military position
and that of its friends; that more
regional security alliances like the
eWstern Hemisphere pact be made,
and that the European Recovery
Program be pushed to a succesful
end.
"Creation of additional machin
ery would not affect the basic polit
ical situation with which we are
confronted," said Austin. "What is
necessary is a fundamental adjust
ment between East and West. This
will have to be undertaken at the
suitable time."
