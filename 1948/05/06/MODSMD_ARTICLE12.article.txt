WASHINGTON. May 5 (UP)
Secretary of State George C. Mar
shall today threw out a strong hint
that the administration may ask
Congress to amend the European
Recovery Program to provide Amer
ican arms to the 1G participating
countries.
He also said again that the State
Department is considering a proposal
for limited military lend-lease sup
plies to the five-nation Western
European Defense Alliance.
The White House last week denied
a report that such a military-aid
to-Europe program was being
drafted and soon would be sub
mitted to Congress.
Marshall, who testified before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee,
did not indicate how soon the ad
ministration might act on the mili
tary aid question.
He said he could not. go into de
tails at a public committee session.
