tions refuse to recognize any inde
pendent states, either Jewish or

decides upon some regime for Pal
estine.

against Belt's idea, came from the
Russian ambassador to the United
States, A. S. Panyushkin. He ob
jected strenuously, arguing that the

tion plan under which separate
Jewish and Arab states would bt
created.
