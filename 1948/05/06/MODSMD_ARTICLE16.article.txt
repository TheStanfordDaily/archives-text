"We expect this to be the largest
Sophomore Carnival on record,"
said co-chairman Ed Wright of the
Convalescent Home fun-fest sched
uled for tomorrow night from 8 to 12.
This afternoon, workers from each
living group will begin building and
decorating more than 50 booths and
concessions inside and outside the
Pavilion.
WRIGHT REQUESTED living
groups to provide most of the lum
ber for construction of separate con
cessions, as only small amounts of
lumber wil be available at the Cor
poration Yard. Booth builders
should contact Claude Rosenberg,

Village 308, for space allotment and
building directions.
A prize will be offered to the liv
ing group with the best decorated I
booth. Materials for decoration and
prizes for separate games should be
supplied by each group.
There may not be a roller coaster,
but the sophomore committee has
promised almost every other imagin
able concession for campus carnival- |
goers.
A MINIATURE GOLF course, rat j
races, penny guessing, a rope climb,
a minstrel show, Cubberley House's i
freak show, dancing girls provided !
by the sophomore class, and a cow- j
milking contest will provide a good
time for the holders of 10-cent tick
ets.
Tickets will be available at six
locations around the Pavilion. How
ever, no money will be handled in
separate booths, Wright said.
The carnival committee includes: j
Ed Wright, co-chairman; Helen
Compton, Fred Cummings, Ed i
O'Neill, Nancy Toll, Orie Adcock, j
and Lamar Briner.
