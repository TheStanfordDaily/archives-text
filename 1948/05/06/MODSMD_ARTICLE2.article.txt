WIDE-EYED AND WONDERING,
80 Con Home kids marveled as
Farm students set about with hoes
and shovels in their one-day cam

prepared, as always, by Sam Mac-
Donald. Four thousand jean-clad
workers trooped down to the Con
Home as the band played songs

for kiddies and workers. Thus
far student contributions have
lagged and even minimum goals
for Con Home support have not
been met.
