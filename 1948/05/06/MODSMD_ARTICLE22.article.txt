# Farm Obtains Stern Grant
## 
### 
Stanford was awarded $1G6,714 I
from the estate of the late Mrs. I
Lucie Stern yesterday. The Uni- !
versity received a first accounting of j
its share in the estate after court I
action.
It will receive more two years
after the death of Mrs. Stern's J
daughter, if not before, according i
to the terms of the will.
The Palo Alto woman died in
January, 1946. Her will when pro
bated showed an estate of over
three million dollars to be distrib- |
uted by the guardian of the estate,
Walter A. Hass.
The court was asked to grant the j
amount to Stanford under a pro- {
vision of the will which provided
that Hass could distribute it at his j
discretion as long as the daughter!
was adequately cared for. Superior
Judge Leonard R. Avilla of Santa
Clara County granted the request.
