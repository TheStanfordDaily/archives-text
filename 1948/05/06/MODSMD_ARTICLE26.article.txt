# One-Acts Charming
## 
### 
Three one-act plays formed a
charming trio at the Little Theater
last night.
Sir James Barrie's well known
"The Twelve Pound Look" led off
the list. Sir James was at his best,
and the Stanford Players came as
close to him as could probably be
expected.
Harold Todd as Harry Sims started
off in an unnecessarily stiff manner
but soon struck the expected bal
ance between the pompous and the
human. Nancy DeGroot oozed charm
.and vitality, a bit too much of it.
Paula Blanchard as Mrs. Sims
maintained the correct dullness but
failed in her exit line to show the
"twelve pound look," which the
whole thing was about.
Two scenes from Arthur Schnitz
ler's "Anatol" were adapted to be
come the remaining one-acters. The
last one, "The Wedding Morning,"
was the »vening's highlight.
The idea of a man on his wed
ding morning trying to get rid of
another woman, with whom he has
just spent the night, was carried to
its full potentialities.
"Questioning Fate," which finds a
man with the unusual power ol
hypnotism over his girl friend, suf
fered from the fact that actors were
continually moving while speaking.
