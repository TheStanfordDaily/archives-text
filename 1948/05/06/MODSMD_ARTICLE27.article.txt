# Sorry, Lake Lag Closed This Year
## 
### 
No swimming will be permitted in
j Lake .Lagunita this year the stu
; dent manager's office announced
yesterday.
Lagunita is 40 per cent full with
a scant 48 million gallons—7o mil—
! lion less than capacity. Depth at
the lake's deepest point is 9*2 feet.
Last year Lagunita was declared
open. It was a foot and a half
! deeper than it is now. Rapid water
i loss forced closing after a one-week
j season.
Lagunita loses approximately two
million gallons daily through leak
age. Water intake would have to
equal this amount to maintain the
same level.
Since rains have stopped, Lagunita
is expected to dry up rapidly.
