What degree of penalty constitutes corrective pun
ishment? Is expulsion from the University a just
punishment for a student convicted of cheating in
an examination?
Questions such as these must be determined sev
eral times each quarter by the five men elected to

Men's Council. These part-time
judges are the main line of defense
lor upholding Honor Code prin
ciples — a code that few other
schools in the nation enjoy.
Men's Council Chairman Fred
Hannum said his group bases its
penalties on precedent, the category
of the offense, and 011 the indi
vidual student. He defines each
of these three factors as:
1. Precedent — Prewar Honor
Code violations were punished by

expulsion, suspension, and reprimand. While these
sentences included a number of expulsions from
the University, recent councils have limited penalties
to reprimands and suspensions.
This year code violators have received only one or
two quarters' suspension. But in the future the
council will get tougher; three or four quarters'
suspension will be the sentence for flagrant violations.
2. Category of the offense — If one student cheats
in an unimportant 10-minute quiz and another man
copies answers to a final examination, how should
the council mete out the punishment if convictions
follow?
In one case a student fudged on a test that may
have no effect on his final grade; in the other case
the student cheated on a test that would probably
determine his final grade.
Surely, then, some differentiation in penalties is
in older.
You may say that they both cheated; therefore,
kick them both out of school. On the other hand,
remember that the man attempting an unarmed
robbery fares far better than the armed bank rob
ber when judgment is passed by the court.
3. The individual student — Character of the ac
cused man plays an important part in council de
cisions. How should a second offender be puished?
Surely a two-time violator is not fit to remain or to
return to Stanford.
Cases appear where students violated the Code
without realizing their error. In such individual
cases, the council may settle the account with a
severe reprimand, Convalescent Home work, or a
short suspension. Flagrancy, then, plays a large
part in the council's decisions; the more deliberate
the Code violation, the sliffer must be the penalty
levied by the judges.
For the Code offenders the council is sympathetic
for their luture lives; flunking one exam is only a
temporary black mark for the student, but to go
through life with a conviction against one's character
can be ruinous to his future security.
Two points should be raised at this point—the pros
and cons of suspending a student for one to four
quarters or expelling him from ever returning to the
Farm.
1. Expulsion — The present Men's Council dis
favors expulsion because the penalty places perma
nent dishonor on a man's record. His Stanford tran
script must follow him throughout his life with a
notation "Expelled for violation of the Honor Code."
Other schools would hardly greet him with open
