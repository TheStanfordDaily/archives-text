## Bull Session 
### 
At the risk of having this piece sound like one
of Bill Stern's dra-ham-matic sports stories, we
would like to pass on a tale about one of our
varsity basketball playei's.
When this fellow was playing high school basket
ball in Technical High School up in Oakland back
in 1041-43, he was strictly a second-rater. He was on
the varsity for three years and never was quite
good enough to make the first team. No one, espe
cially the coach, held any illusions about his ever
playing college basketball. And when he was grabbed
into the army light after high school graduation,
his basketball was pushed into the background and
temporarily forgotten.
It wasn't until his army outfit in the European
Theater organized a hoop team that he began playing
ball again. Still he was no sensation. Just about the
same as in high school—no better, no worse. That is,
until one day, when the tall, likeable Negro boy
who was playing a terrific game at center for the
outfit, took him aside and told him that he had the
makings of a real ballplayer.
The center was certain that with proper instruc
tion, the medium-sized guard would develop into
an outstanding player. And so they went to work;
the colored boy doing the teaching; his white friend
doing the learning.
Before long, the tall center and his protege had
become the talk of the army league. And when the
all-European service teams were announced, no one
was at all surprised to find as the number one guard
our stocky friend who wasn't good enough to make
the first team in high school. We think perhaps you
know the fellow in question. His name—Gus Cha
valas.
But what about the talented center on that army
team who gave Gus his supply of basketball tricks?
What happened to him?
If you've followed Coast Conference play for the
past two years, you have undoubtedly seen him in
action. And you may have wondered why there is
always a greeting which borders on an actual em
brace when two players, one from Stanford and the
other from UCLA meet each other on the court.
Now you know it's merely a "class reunion" for
Gus Chavalas, the pupil, and his ex-teacher, UCLA's
great guard, Dave Minor!
arms if he applied for entrance.
Expulsions, however, uphold tjie meaning and pur
pose of the Honor Code — honesty in completing
academic studies. Permanent suspensions, moreover,
strengthen the effectiveness of the Code leaving an
indelible mark on students' minds as to what would
happen following a Code conviction.
2. Suspension — But is this attitude just; should
we lash down with full force <*i a man regardless of
his crime? Is the death penalty the only solution to
discourage potential criminals? The council thinks
not. Suspension in itself carries a terrible mark for
the cheater; his transcript will carry a remark noting
his violation. During his absence from school, he
must face the folks at home. If he returns to Stan
ford, however, he has a good chance to erase the
shame from his past.
Suspension can uphold the Honor Code; it can
keep faculty and student confidence in the priv
ilege. And a flexible suspension system serves to
show the degree of the violation providing the maxi
mum suspension sentence is not too lenient. A very
few exceptions, however, do warrant expulsion in
very flagrant violations.

2. Suspension — But is this attitude just; should
we lash down with full force <*i a man regardless of
his crime? Is the death penalty the only solution to
discourage potential criminals? The council thinks
not. Suspension in itself carries a terrible mark for
the cheater; his transcript will carry a remark noting
his violation. During his absence from school, he
must face the folks at home. If he returns to Stan
ford, however, he has a good chance to erase the
shame from his past.
Suspension can uphold the Honor Code; it can
keep faculty and student confidence in the priv
ilege. And a flexible suspension system serves to
show the degree of the violation providing the maxi
mum suspension sentence is not too lenient. A very
few exceptions, however, do warrant expulsion in
very flagrant violations.
At the risk of having this piece sound like one
of Bill Stern's dra-ham-matic sports stories, we
would like to pass on a tale about one of our
varsity basketball playei's.
When this fellow was playing high school basket
ball in Technical High School up in Oakland back
in 1041-43, he was strictly a second-rater. He was on
the varsity for three years and never was quite
good enough to make the first team. No one, espe
cially the coach, held any illusions about his ever
playing college basketball. And when he was grabbed
into the army light after high school graduation,
his basketball was pushed into the background and
temporarily forgotten.
It wasn't until his army outfit in the European
Theater organized a hoop team that he began playing
ball again. Still he was no sensation. Just about the
same as in high school—no better, no worse. That is,
until one day, when the tall, likeable Negro boy
who was playing a terrific game at center for the
outfit, took him aside and told him that he had the
makings of a real ballplayer.
The center was certain that with proper instruc
tion, the medium-sized guard would develop into
an outstanding player. And so they went to work;
the colored boy doing the teaching; his white friend
doing the learning.
Before long, the tall center and his protege had
become the talk of the army league. And when the
all-European service teams were announced, no one
was at all surprised to find as the number one guard
our stocky friend who wasn't good enough to make
the first team in high school. We think perhaps you
know the fellow in question. His name—Gus Cha
valas.
But what about the talented center on that army
team who gave Gus his supply of basketball tricks?
What happened to him?
If you've followed Coast Conference play for the
past two years, you have undoubtedly seen him in
action. And you may have wondered why there is
always a greeting which borders on an actual em
brace when two players, one from Stanford and the
other from UCLA meet each other on the court.
Now you know it's merely a "class reunion" for
Gus Chavalas, the pupil, and his ex-teacher, UCLA's
great guard, Dave Minor!
arms if he applied for entrance.
Expulsions, however, uphold tjie meaning and pur
pose of the Honor Code — honesty in completing
academic studies. Permanent suspensions, moreover,
strengthen the effectiveness of the Code leaving an
indelible mark on students' minds as to what would
happen following a Code conviction.
