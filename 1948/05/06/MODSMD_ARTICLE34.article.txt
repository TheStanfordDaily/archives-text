## History 1948 
### 
War has come to the little country by the Medi
terranean.
Arab armies appear to have launched their invasion
of Palestine. UN observers in Jerusalem have wired
that the situation is rapidly becoming chaotic. At
Lake Success further truce attempts have been

called hopeless.
Small Jewish Haganah forces,
inadequately armed thanks to|
British prohibitions and our "neu-l
trality" embargo, will defend their'
farms and towns, overwhelmingly
outnumbered by the British
trained and British-equipped Arab
legions.
Thousands of men will die, farms
will be burned, towns looted be
cause UN did not act. UN could
not act because we changed our

minds on the partition plan and offered nothing but
unintelligible double talk in return.
The reasons for our reversal are well known. To
enforce partition UN troops would be needed; UN
troops would include Soviet soldiers, and we are
understandably reluctant to have Russians near our
Middle-East oil wells. Also, we don't want to an
tagonize the Arabs. We said that we could not
afford to have trouble in the Middle-East.
Granted that we need the oil, our decision still
was not very intelligent. For instead of avoiding
trouble it is causing more. The 30 years of broken
promises by England and of the verbose futility of
the League of Nations and UN have made the Jews
so mad that they will,fight, come hell or high water.
They are no longer interested in commissions and
reports. They have seen an endless number of them
accomplishing precisely nothing. For over a quarter
of a century they have been a helpless pawn in the
game of power politics. They have found out through

bitter experience that if they don't defend their
own rights, nobody will do it for them.
They will fight all comers, including us, should we
be foolish enough to send troops there to stop them.
Our oil is no safer than it would have been with
partition. Haganah men have had years of experience
of blowing things up. They know that they must
defend themselves against the invading Arabs and in
the face of tremendous odds because of our policies.
They might want to try their skill with explosives
on our wells.
In 1939 we denounced the Munich pact with righ
teous indignation as selling Czechoslovakia down the
river. That was supposed to bring "peace in our
time." It failed. We have sold Palestine down (he
river to bring "oil for our battleships." This, too,
will fail.
The blood of a nation is on our hands. Our vain
efforts to buy security by imposing a pax-Americana
on the world end in sudden death in Bethlehem.
For security cannot be boughtâ€”neither with money
nor with guns. This is as true today as it was in
the days of the Roman Empire. Security is possible
only when the basic causes of insecurity are removed.
We want to stop communism. We cannot do it by
shooting communists, by blackmailing people to vote
for us, or by letting Jews die in Palestine. Com
munism will be stopped when, and only when, hun
ger, poverty, and oppression are stopped.
We want to "sell" our way of life throughout the
world. It is a sad sales talk for democracy to let
others die because you erroneously believe that this
will help you. The Secretary of Defense, well-qualified
for his position by his experience as a tax-dodging
stockbroker, and the other little politicians in Wash
ington would do well to remember Lincoln's idea:
"I am for both man and the dollar, but in case of
conflict. I am for the man."
