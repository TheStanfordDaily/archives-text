# Farm Guests Need Homes
## 
### 
Foreign students will visit the
United States this summer, but will
be allowed to bring only $100 with
them. The limit is imposed because
of the shortage of American dollars
overseas, the $100 will go for trans
portation to America.
For this reason, the National Stu
dents Association, which has ex
tended the invitation to small groups
of students in several European
countries, is asking American fam
ilies to help.
Families have been asked to pro
vide for the students during the two
week periods which they will stay.
Students interested in having for
eign guests should leave informa
tion at the NSA desks in the IIR
Shack (behind the Quad office) to
day or tomorrow.
Information should include:
Name
College
Address to which you arc in
viting student
Dates during which you would

like to have student (any two
week period from July 1 to
Aug. 23)
Preferences: Sex, nationality,
interests
Ability to pay guest's full ex
pense during the visit
Brief description of summer sur
roundings and activities
Other young people in your fam
ily
Students whose families accept the
plan will be notified of the name,
nationality, and date of arrival of
their summer guests.
