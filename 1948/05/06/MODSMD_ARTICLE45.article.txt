# Line Backers Improve
## 
### BY JOHN BREIER 
Both of the lads who did most of i
Ihe line backing on last year's foot- |
ball team will not be back next j
.year. Today we will review the can
didates for center and fullback—
men who will probably do a lot of
lhat line backing as well as their
offensive jobs.
George Quist is gone and with
him the only really good line-backer
the Farm squad had last season.
One of five centers now out will
jf.ll heir to half of that job.
OFFENSIVELY, John Rosekrans
stacks up as number one center right
now. He played on the varsity last
year and thus knows the signals,
blocking asignments, etc., better
than the other four men out for
center.
However, this corner will nomi
nate Jim Castagnoli for first-string
honors come next September. The
210-pound Vallejo transfer has j
played from the long punt forma
tion and can qualify as the best
long passer. He is a good line
backer and should do better than
anyone Marchie Schwartz had in
this spot last year.
THE CLASS OF '51 's contribu
-Ison to the center post is a man
to watch. Dick Abraham is a 200-
pounder who looks good on offense. |
Once he gets experience at backing j
up the line it will be very hard to |
"beat him out of the position.
Steve Hubbard is a made-over j
hillback from San Jose State. He I
lis a big fellow but has not had the j
experience needed to handle the ,
defensive duties of a center. Ken !

Schuchard, from San Francisco JC,
is a candidate but has been missing
from practice because of a skin dis
order.
EMERY MITCHELL is the lad
who has drawn the attention of just
about everybody who has watched j
the boys practice. He is a sure bet j
to see a lot of action if not latch
onto .the first-string position for j
good.
Mitchell is a hard runner, the like
of which was not on last year's
squad. Watch him in Saturday's
scrum.
The other lad who has looked j
good in the spring drills is Bud Klein
from COP. He is eligible for the
first time. Klein is a swivel-hipped
runner who can gain yardage once ]
he clears the line. He is not the j
hard runner that one associates with
the fullback job.
808 SHEFFLES of last year's
jayvees is good. He did not get a
chance to show his stuff last year as
he was injured in the first JV game, j
He is the type who can be counted
on for a yard or two each and j
every try.
Gordon MacLachlan and Rob Al- j
tick are up from the frosh for a try
at varsity play. MacLachlan and j
Altick have looked good as runners, >
Again, experience is needed.
Marty Anderson has one more
year of ball left. He is out for j
track now, but will be on hand next ]
fall. He drew a lot of favorable |
comment during several of the |
games last year. He can not be
counted out. Nor can Jack Barnes j
who is playing baseball now.

at varsity play. MacLachlan and j
Altick have looked good as runners, >
Again, experience is needed.
Marty Anderson has one more
year of ball left. He is out for j
track now, but will be on hand next ]
fall. He drew a lot of favorable |
comment during several of the |
games last year. He can not be
counted out. Nor can Jack Barnes j
who is playing baseball now.
Both of the lads who did most of i
Ihe line backing on last year's foot- |
ball team will not be back next j
.year. Today we will review the can
didates for center and fullback—
men who will probably do a lot of
lhat line backing as well as their
offensive jobs.
George Quist is gone and with
him the only really good line-backer
the Farm squad had last season.
One of five centers now out will
jf.ll heir to half of that job.
OFFENSIVELY, John Rosekrans
stacks up as number one center right
now. He played on the varsity last
year and thus knows the signals,
blocking asignments, etc., better
than the other four men out for
center.
However, this corner will nomi
nate Jim Castagnoli for first-string
honors come next September. The
210-pound Vallejo transfer has j
played from the long punt forma
tion and can qualify as the best
long passer. He is a good line
backer and should do better than
anyone Marchie Schwartz had in
this spot last year.
THE CLASS OF '51 's contribu
-Ison to the center post is a man
to watch. Dick Abraham is a 200-
pounder who looks good on offense. |
Once he gets experience at backing j
up the line it will be very hard to |
"beat him out of the position.
Steve Hubbard is a made-over j
hillback from San Jose State. He I
lis a big fellow but has not had the j
experience needed to handle the ,
defensive duties of a center. Ken !

Schuchard, from San Francisco JC,
is a candidate but has been missing
from practice because of a skin dis
order.
EMERY MITCHELL is the lad
who has drawn the attention of just
about everybody who has watched j
the boys practice. He is a sure bet j
to see a lot of action if not latch
onto .the first-string position for j
good.
Mitchell is a hard runner, the like
of which was not on last year's
squad. Watch him in Saturday's
scrum.
The other lad who has looked j
good in the spring drills is Bud Klein
from COP. He is eligible for the
first time. Klein is a swivel-hipped
runner who can gain yardage once ]
he clears the line. He is not the j
hard runner that one associates with
the fullback job.
808 SHEFFLES of last year's
jayvees is good. He did not get a
chance to show his stuff last year as
he was injured in the first JV game, j
He is the type who can be counted
on for a yard or two each and j
every try.
Gordon MacLachlan and Rob Al- j
tick are up from the frosh for a try
at varsity play. MacLachlan and j
Altick have looked good as runners, >
