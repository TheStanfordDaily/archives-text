## SATURDAY Racketmen Face UCLA 
### 
With one lopsided victory and two J
defeats recorded on their Pacific-
Coast Conference ledger, Stanford's i
tennis men are practicing seriously |
this week. A surprise victory over j
UCLA here Saturday would make j
them second only to the powerful 1
USC squad.
THE MATCH, scheduled for 1:30,:
will be Ihe second meeting for the
teams in the double round-robin j
competition. Two weeks ago Stan- j
ford lost to UCLA. 6 to 3, for the j
team's first conference defeat. The j
next day our men lost to USC.
But the clean sweep in all matches !
against Cal last Saturday shot new I
spirit into the squad. Our seven 1
men, playing on their home court, j
might have the extra energy to upset j
the brazen Bruins.
UCLA. JUST missing a win over j
USC in a 5 to 4 match that was |
undecided until the number three
doubles, will be out to display its
power. Such men as Herb Flam, !
one of the top amateur tennis |
men in the nation, and teammate
Gene Garrett, are the claws of the
Bruin squad.
Stanford's Kirk Mechem and Bob
Lewis will be assigned the job of
keeping Flam and Garrett from
crippling the relatively unarmed In
dians. Mechem fought well against
Flam in the last match, losing 4-6. |
4-6.
A GOOD START in the top posi
tions might inspire Errol Lycette.
Lucien Barbour, Fred Lewis, and
Bob Forbes to supreme efforts.
All of Stanford's varsity squad is
returning next year. So the old In
dian cry is in order.
"Wait 'til next year."
