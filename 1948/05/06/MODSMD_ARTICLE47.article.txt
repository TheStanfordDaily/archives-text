# Indian Crews Point For Win Over Bears
## 
### BILL BETHKE 
With their "foot on the bottom
rung" of the big league ladder by
virtue of the walloping given to
UCLA last Saturday, the Stanford
crew will be going all out to crash
the top circle when it meets Cal's
varsity, jayvee, and frosh shells Sat
urday morning on the Oakland Es
tuary. The three Card boatloads
have been getting in their final
practice licks this week, turning out
at the customary 5:30 a.m. hour.
LAST WEEK'S clean sweep in
Los Angeles gave Coach A. A.
Clark's oarsmen the self-confidence
and enthusiasm they needed for the
Big Race.
Final practices have stressed form,
power, and starts to put on the final
polish that may be the margin of
victory.
None of the crewmen hold Cal to
be an easy foe. The Bears are one
of the country's top 12 crews and
are especially motivated by a shot
at the 1948 Olympic crew team
berth. Coach Ky Ebright has back
the entire jayvee crew that won the
jayvee race at Poughkeepsie last
June. This year's jayvees set a new
meet record last week, and the
frosh came in second in a recent
inter-class meet.
THE CARDS, however, are far
from being the underdogs. The var
sity turned in a highly respectable
6:01.1 last Saturday while waltzing
away from UCLA. The jayvees had
the extra that allowed
them to match determined drives in
last week's meet and come out
ahead. All but two men in this
first pair of shells will be eligible
next year. The frosh were never
prodded and came home ahead in
0:30.
Although Cal may boast some
better times, the crewmen have
given this less thought than might
be expected, for the wind, current,
and weather make an appreciable
difference in times.
MORE IMPORTANT than previ
ous performances or potential pow
er. however, is the great spirit the
Farm oarsmen have displayed. Their

sacrifices, both in early morning
sleeping time and in equipment,
have made the .sport more impor
tant to them than to most crew en
thusiasts.
THE CONSTANT DESIKE to
make a good showing and to prove
that they deserve better support has
spurred them to work harder and
longer than has seemed actually
necessary. The long seven-month
preparation season, the pre-break
fast workouts, and the Sunday prac
tices of spring quarter have been
undertaken and sustained with the
hope of producing a first-class crew
as the motivating force.
Wins over the Bears would mean
glory for participating men and
coaches, but several men behind the
scenes deserve a great deal of cred
it. Managei's George Benedict, Mort
Gollender, and Bill Bowes have kept
the shells and launch in running
order all year and run the coaching
launch for the early morning work
outs. Wally White, Bob Fox, Don
Davis, and George Reideman, the
alternate oarsmen, turn out for all
the workouts and make the trips
on the chance of replacing an in
jured oarsman.
IN THE VARSITY SHELL Sat
urday will be John Dee. cox; Ted
Bohlander, stroke; Norm Swanson,
Bob Phelps, Jim Brannaman, Jim
Smith, Andy Arnosti, Ray Haley,
and Bob Kendall.
Bob Setrakian will cox the jay
vees and stroke Jack Tobin, Tony
English, Curt Tarr, Max King, Norm
Silberling, John Liyhtner. Bob Sco
thorn, and Dave Erickson.
Don McKenzie is the frosh cox,
and Bill Betlike is the stroke. Mack
Church, Andy Field, Jim Lenhart,
A 1 Snyder, Don Casey, Chuck Bate
son, and John Holloway fill out the
shell.

sity turned in a highly respectable
6:01.1 last Saturday while waltzing
away from UCLA. The jayvees had
the extra that allowed
them to match determined drives in
last week's meet and come out
ahead. All but two men in this
first pair of shells will be eligible
next year. The frosh were never
prodded and came home ahead in
0:30.
Although Cal may boast some
better times, the crewmen have
given this less thought than might
be expected, for the wind, current,
and weather make an appreciable
difference in times.
MORE IMPORTANT than previ
ous performances or potential pow
er. however, is the great spirit the
Farm oarsmen have displayed. Their

sacrifices, both in early morning
sleeping time and in equipment,
have made the .sport more impor
tant to them than to most crew en
thusiasts.
THE CONSTANT DESIKE to
make a good showing and to prove
that they deserve better support has
spurred them to work harder and
longer than has seemed actually
necessary. The long seven-month
preparation season, the pre-break
fast workouts, and the Sunday prac
tices of spring quarter have been
undertaken and sustained with the
hope of producing a first-class crew
as the motivating force.
Wins over the Bears would mean
glory for participating men and
coaches, but several men behind the
scenes deserve a great deal of cred
it. Managei's George Benedict, Mort
Gollender, and Bill Bowes have kept
the shells and launch in running
order all year and run the coaching
launch for the early morning work
outs. Wally White, Bob Fox, Don
Davis, and George Reideman, the
alternate oarsmen, turn out for all
the workouts and make the trips
on the chance of replacing an in
jured oarsman.
IN THE VARSITY SHELL Sat
urday will be John Dee. cox; Ted
Bohlander, stroke; Norm Swanson,
Bob Phelps, Jim Brannaman, Jim
Smith, Andy Arnosti, Ray Haley,
and Bob Kendall.
Bob Setrakian will cox the jay
vees and stroke Jack Tobin, Tony
English, Curt Tarr, Max King, Norm
Silberling, John Liyhtner. Bob Sco
thorn, and Dave Erickson.
Don McKenzie is the frosh cox,
and Bill Betlike is the stroke. Mack
Church, Andy Field, Jim Lenhart,
A 1 Snyder, Don Casey, Chuck Bate
son, and John Holloway fill out the
shell.
With their "foot on the bottom
rung" of the big league ladder by
virtue of the walloping given to
UCLA last Saturday, the Stanford
crew will be going all out to crash
the top circle when it meets Cal's
varsity, jayvee, and frosh shells Sat
urday morning on the Oakland Es
tuary. The three Card boatloads
have been getting in their final
practice licks this week, turning out
at the customary 5:30 a.m. hour.
LAST WEEK'S clean sweep in
Los Angeles gave Coach A. A.
Clark's oarsmen the self-confidence
and enthusiasm they needed for the
Big Race.
Final practices have stressed form,
power, and starts to put on the final
polish that may be the margin of
victory.
None of the crewmen hold Cal to
be an easy foe. The Bears are one
of the country's top 12 crews and
are especially motivated by a shot
at the 1948 Olympic crew team
berth. Coach Ky Ebright has back
the entire jayvee crew that won the
jayvee race at Poughkeepsie last
June. This year's jayvees set a new
meet record last week, and the
frosh came in second in a recent
inter-class meet.

from being the underdogs. The var
