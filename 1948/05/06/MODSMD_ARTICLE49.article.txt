## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 5 (UP).—Ev
erybody was talking today about the
old creaky pitchers with whom the
Pittsburgh Pirates are winning ball
games, but what about the star
hurlers for the opposition they have
been mistreating?
Today, when Danny Murtaugh
singled home the winning run in a
two-run ninth-inning rally to beat
the Boston Braves, 3 to 2, nobody
but right-handed ace Johnny Sain,
a 21-game winner last season, was
the victim.
LAST NIGHT, the Pirates had the
Braves' other ace, Lei'ty Warren
Spahn, on the ropes, leading him
3 to 0 in the fourth inning, when the
game was called off because of rain.
Spahn, like Sain, was a 21-game
winner last season.
Today's win was their sixth
straight and it was the third in a
row for Elmer Riddle, who traded
in the bone chips in his elbow for
a stack of blue chips, on which he
has been staging a winning gamble
for his pitching life.
THE PHILLIES won a bat battle
from the Cubs at Chicago, 13 to 9.
but it was a costly one,because vet
eran pitcher Lyn Rowe suffered a
fractured thumb knocking down a
line drive. Syrian Sam Nahem,
back in the majors after playing
semi - pro bull with the Brooklyn
Bush wicks, was the winning pitcher,

I holding Chicago to two hits in three j
I innings.
The Red Sox won a hair-raiser j
in Boston when Vernon Stephens;
I hit an llth-inning homer to top the
