# Taft Hails Major Victory; Stassen Bandwagon Slows

### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP)—
Returns from Ohio's Republican
presidential primary slowed Harold
E. Stassen's bandwagon today and
demonstrated the labor front weak
ness of Sen. Robert A. Taft.
Both fell short of their predictions
but Taft claimed "victory for me and
defeat for Stassen" on the basis of
returns showing he won their Ohio
delegate contest by a scoi'e of 14 to 9.
In addition, Taft won 30 delegate
seats which Stassen did not contest. !
TAFT IIAILEl) his showing as a
major victory and claimed he now
had more first ballot convention
delegates than any other candidate.
He said Stassen had been defeated.
The Republican leader in the
Senate based his claims for victory
on the shutout he scored in the
delegate-at-large race and the fact
that Stassen fell short of predictions. I
The former Minnesota governor
disagreed. He said his feat of win
ning nearly half the delegates he
sought was a definite victory and
"another step toward his nomination
at the Philadelphia convention."
ONE FACT CERTAIN: Taft would
have a split delegation when he went
to Philadelphia next month. An- I
other thing was true: Stassen failed i
to match his own estimate of j
strength.
Voters in Alabama lined up behind j
a revolt against the nomination of i
President Truman. Five of eight ap- •

parent winners for delegate-at
large were pledged to desert the
Democrats if they called for a civil
rights program at their convention.
Gov. James E. (Big Jim) Folsom,
seeking a delegate-at-large spot as
a supporter of Truman, was running
behind. He also lost out in his at
tempt to unseat U. S. Sen. John J.
Sparkman.
