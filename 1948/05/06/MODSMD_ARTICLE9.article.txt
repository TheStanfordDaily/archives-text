WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP)
Dalton Trum bo, $80,000-a-year
Hollywood movie writer, was con
victed of contempt of Congress today
by a federal district court jury.
The jury of seven men and five
women took just two hours to find
Trumbo guilty of a two-count charge
of refusing to tell the House Un-
Ameri c a il Activities Committee
whether he ever belonged to the
Communist Party, or whether he
was ever a member of the Screen
Writers Guild.
He faces a maximum penalty of
two years in jail and $2,000 fine.
Trumbo, who wrote such movie
hits as "A Guy Named Joe" and
"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes,"
was the second Hollywood person
ality to be convicted on contempt
charges growing out of the House
committee's stormy communism-in-
Hollywood hearings last summer.
