# Panel Reviews Communism
## 
### 
"How Far Can Communism Go?"
was the topic of the lIR panel held
at Rob!e last night. Led by Ed
Chambers, graduate student in inter
national relations, the discussion
turned into a fast-moving, question
ing session in which one of the lis
teners, Gerson Kaplan, took an ac
tive part.
The panel centered on the evolu
tion of communism—from capitalism
to socialism and finally to commu
nism. It was mentioned that in
many countries the final step would
never be attained. Also, the Com
munist movement is only a rela
tively new experiment, one of the
reasons for its appeal to discouraged
Europoans.
Success of the movement in Rus

sin was attributed largely to the:
strong nationalism among all the
people. Chambers called the group's
attention to the fact that education
was stressed in the Soviet Union,
thereby raising the nation's standard
of literacy and creating interest in
the government's activities.
The moderator expressed the view
that the United States could adopt
a positive program against Commu
nism by eliminating racial prejudice
and other causes of citizen discon
tent.
"In Italy," Chambers said, "the
Communist movement did not take
hold earlier because of the lack of
the chief requisite, an industrial so
ciety. Only because of the Italians'
discontent did the Communists stage
their campaign."
