## Are You a Griper? 
### 
Cardinals have always had more than their share of criticism
from the professional do-nothing gripers.
At the moment they are conducting tryouts for next year's
members. They consider senior and junior students both with a
record of service to the student body and those without. The
quality the previous work is more important than the quantity.
People without activities experience who demonstrate a willing
ness to work on constructive ideas will be welcome.

Many people have considered Cardinals as a small group
of "names" basking in the glory of a high student body position.
Cardinals list of activities this year included Homecoming, two
all-campus drives, Con Home Week, ASSU-sponsored dances,
supervision of Rally Com, and numerous smaller services.
Their opportunity for more service is great. Whether or not
ihese opportunities are utilized depends on the individuals they
choose, i.e. greater liaison with NSA, a rejuvenation of the Ac
tivities Files, better student-Administration relationships, etc.

Cardinals will, we hope, be careful in their selection of mem
bers —choosing sincere workers rather than glory-seekers. You
will, we hope, decide to activate your ideas. —M. H.
