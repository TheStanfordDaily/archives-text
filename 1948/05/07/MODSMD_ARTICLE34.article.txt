# CAMPUS OPINION
## Stanford Glamor 
### 
To the Editor:
There was an admirable letter in the Feb. 17 Daily. It was signed by
a Jerry H. Werlin and beautifully denied that Stanford unduly discrimi
nated between races and religions. I was delighted that someone finally
stopped feeling sorry for himself and appreciated Stanford, at last. It had
seemed to me that, since the war, hundreds of veterans came to Stanford
under the GI Bill who'd been attracted by certain of its "charms" but
who heretofore had been unable to afford it—now with bills paid they d
come to our campus and proceeded to attempt to change all those things
that had attracted them.
Whether we like it or not, Stanford is considered a "rich man's school,
despite the fact that USC tuition is much higher. At any rate Stanford
has "glamour," and it's rather annoying to watch attempts at making it
"Stanford State College."
So, I was proud of Mr. Werlin, who seemed to like Stanford as is.
But the damn fool had to "retract in toto" his letter a couple of days
later. Whoever edited his letter did a wonderful job. Just thinks If he'd
kept his mouth shut he'd always have had at least ONE fan—me! As a
matter of fact, before the i-etraction, I wanted to compliment him on his
first letter. Oh, well, I'll get off my soap box now.
