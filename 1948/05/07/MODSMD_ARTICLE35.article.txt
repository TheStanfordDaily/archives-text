WASHINGTON, May 6 (UP) —
President Truman said today there
is "room enough for everybody in
this world—room enough ... to
have peace."
The Chief Executive discussed
peace, politics, and the housing
shortage in a 15-minute impromptu
speech to the National Conference
on Family Life. His words were
broadcast to the nation and added
ap to the longest extemporaneous
address any U. S. president has
ever made on the air.
He deplored the housing shortage,
which he said has become "almost
a fatal one," and urged the 900 dele
gates to bring voter pressure on
their congressmen to get the Taft-
Ellender-Wagner long-range hous
ing bill passed.
"They probably will listen to you
better than they will to me," he said.
Mr. Truman followed up this jok
ing reference to current politics by
remarking somberly that in some
ways "it is too bad" that this is
an election year.

OAKLAND, May 6 (UP)—A near
riot of 350 junior high school stu

dents, touched off by grumbling
over results of a recent track meet,
was squelched by two squads of
police today.
Sixteen policemen, tipped that an
outbreak was expected between sep
arate factions at Frick and Elmhurst
Junior Highs, moved into a milling
throng in front of Frick School just
after school let out at 3:05 p.m.
today.
Twelve youths were arrested and
held for questioning in the impend
ing "gang war" that had begun with
scattered fist fights and threatened
to turn into a melee where clubs
and other weapons were used.
Police confiscated a pile of
wrenches, knives, lead pipe, and
sawed-off baseball bats.
No one was seriously injured.
Sgt. Edward Hay, in charge of the
special "riot" detail assigned to the
school, said a preliminary investi
gation disclosed that ill-feeling re
sulted from a recent Frick-Elmhurst
track meet precipitated the melee.
Most of the participants, he said,
represented two factions within
Frick that disagreed over the re
sults of the meet. Some other came
from Elmhurst.

after school let out at 3:05 p.m.
today.
Twelve youths were arrested and
held for questioning in the impend
ing "gang war" that had begun with
scattered fist fights and threatened
to turn into a melee where clubs
and other weapons were used.
Police confiscated a pile of
wrenches, knives, lead pipe, and
sawed-off baseball bats.
No one was seriously injured.
Sgt. Edward Hay, in charge of the
special "riot" detail assigned to the
school, said a preliminary investi
gation disclosed that ill-feeling re
sulted from a recent Frick-Elmhurst
track meet precipitated the melee.
Most of the participants, he said,
represented two factions within
Frick that disagreed over the re
sults of the meet. Some other came
from Elmhurst.
