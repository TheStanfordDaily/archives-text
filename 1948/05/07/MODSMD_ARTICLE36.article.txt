## Buried Treasure

WASHINGTON—The new look at coast resorts
this summer will be the downward look. A mild
rage of beachcombing and probing in coastal dunes
may be expected to follow the recent discovery of
gold coins of the mid-1700's near Sandy Hook, New
Jersey.
The lure of undiscovered treasure may inspire
better-equipped salvage expeditions. It could even
produce a popular-priced divining rod for shore
cottagers' use.
For it is a matter of record that treasure worth
countless millions lies in hundreds of sunken ships
only a few fathoms down, all along the world'*
coasts, says the National Geographic Society. And
there are the countless stories of fabulous pirate
loot buried ashore.
In New York's East River 30 miles north of Sandy
Hook, the British frigate Hussar sank in 1780 after
hitting a rock. It went down with $4,000,000 —pos-
sibly much more—meant as pay lor British Redcoats.
Salvage attempts have been numerous, but without
success.
Quite similar was the fate of the British frigate
Lexington, carrying gold and silver bullion north
from Vera Cruz. Mexico. It sank in the same year
close by in Hell Gate Passage, and its treasure has
never been recovered.
A mile off Lewes, Delaware, the warsloop De
Braak sank in 1798, victim of a sudden squall. At
tempts to salvage its $15,000,000 cargo of precious
metals began a year later and have continued to the
present day. Rumors of finds of old coins on nearby
sands have persisted.
To sample more recent times in the same East
Coast area, the British liner Republic foundered off
Nantucket in 1909, taking $3,000,000 in American
"gold eagles" to a grave so far too deep for salvage.
In 1911. the liner Merida carried $5,000,000 in specie,
bullion, and storied Mexican jewels to Davy Jones
off Cape Charles, Virginia. Both sinkings resulted
from collision.
These are small-change salvage prospects com
pared ~to some on the log. In Vigo Bay, Spain,
allied British and Dutch fleets in 1702 destroyed
16 Spanish galleon?*. But the galleons carried to the
bottom most of the estimated $150,000,000 loot
they were bringing back from raiding the Carib
bean. Salvage workers of many nations have re
covered only a small part of the total.
Of comparable value were gold, silver, and
jewels lost with 16 Spanish ships in 1643. A West
Indian hurricane drove them on a rocky shoal north
of Hispaniola. Success in salavging a small part of
the treasure at this site in 1687 paved the way for
salty Captain William Pliips to the governorship
of Massachusetts. Another hurricane sent 14 Span
ish ships and $65,000,000 in treasure down off Long
Cay. Florida, in 1715.
Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, the
Galapagos Islands off Ecuador, and Cocos, Costa
Ivican island 400 miles west of Panama, are steeped
in lore of buried treasure. Cooos is supposed to
conceal the famous loot of Lima, Peru.
