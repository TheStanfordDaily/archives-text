## History 1948 Communism Is At the Top 
### 
The Los Angeles Times forced UCLA's Clarence
Dykstra to admit recently that there are some -10 paid
Communist agents working among student groups
on the Bruin campus.
If agents are known, why not expel them? The
answer is that among the 40 are top-rate students
and it takes more than proof of party affiliation to
warrant ousting.
Which brings up a logical question: Just how
deeply has Communism probed through the strata
in America?
Communist activities to date have been mostly
among intellectuals. Except for evidence of a few
infested labor unions—and then at the top—and a
scattering of intellectual party-liners, there is very
little proof of any Communistic band-wagoning
among the laboring men of America.
One answer is that while the intellectuals—a few
college professors, union leaders, and political ideal
ists—mouth the Communist lines, they still eat regu
larly from incomes derived from non-Communistic
pursuits. Their drivel is so much textbook idealism,
and is probably as good a Utopian cathartic for their
own intellectual constipation as any.
To date, the average worker can solve his neu
roses. Even the workers who might be dissatisfied
enough to take up the party line finds more nourish
ment in a full dinner pail than in intellectual tidbits.
A better reason for Communism's non-persua
siveness among Americans is that almost no one, no
matter how loud his shouts about capitalistic op
pression, really believes his own shoutings.
A Fortune poll taken in 1939 asked people to
what social class they felt they belonged and of
what econmic group they thought they were mem
bers. Only 6 per cent of the 31 per cent who iden
tified themselves economically with the lower groups,
thought they belonged in the lower social bracket.
Eighty-eight per cent considered themselves so
cially members of the middle class, although 52 per
cent of these identified themselves with the lower
middle and lower economic groups.
The 1939 poll reveals a lack of class consciousness
and a certain optimism about social strata, despite
income level. Even the top economic brackets iden
tified themselves with the middle class.
A wave of native Communism—grass-roots Com
munism—will have a real chance to gain a foothold
when more of the low-income groups lose their
middle-class rationale, and choose to be grouped with
the lower social class. This will be the era of pes
simism—and mark the rise of class consciousness.
It will be the signal for the intellectual Communists.
Perhaps this explains the government's drive to
root Communism out at the top—as seen by the
Taft-Hartley allegiance clause. Not that anyone wor
ries very much if a Carmel artist slobbers party line
over his pallette. Leaders without followers are not
leaders at all—but merely frustrates.
But with inflation spiraling, and no assurance
that economic chaos will not come, the chance of
supplying that necessary following increases.
