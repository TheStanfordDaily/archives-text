Are YOU an individual or are you just another
number?
We WON student government and the Honor
Code because men and women of a generation ago
demanded that they have a place in the world; they
were not awarded a constitution by some adminis
trators for the fun of practicing.
Yesterday I outlined the penalizing powers and
problems for Honor Code management by Men's

Council. Today this column cov
ers the part of both the Honor
Code and the Fundamental
Standard in the Stanford Family.
1. For students the Honor Code
means that we will not give or
receive aid in academic studies
used by instructors as the basis
of grading. In return for our
creditable conduct in school
work, the University places its
confidence in the men and wom
en by refraining from adopting
any spy or proctor system.

But the Honor Code is not an agreement. It was
not drawn up on the basis of "We will do this if you
will do that." Rather, the Code is a right; it is not
a privilege. A proctor system signifies distrust; an
Honor Code establishes the declaration of honesty and
good faith by each individual. We should regard an
Honor Code violation as we would regard a refu
tation of any or all of the Ten Commandments.
2. As (he Honor Code applies to academic work,
so. too, does tlie Fundamental Standard apply to the
balance of University life and off-campus social and
business activities. Unfortunately the Standard needs
centralization at this time because its enforcement
has tended to split among Men's Council, Interfra
ternity Council, and University leaders.
In practice the Fundamental Standard signifies
respect for order, morality, personal honor, business
integrity, a spirit of equality within the University,
and a respect for the rights of others. Fundamental
Standard violators may be penalized by a reprimand
up to dismissal from Stanford.
Punitive measures for the Deke house (Delta
Kappa Epsilon) at the beginning of this quarter came
under Fundamental Standard jurisdiction. The house

had acted in a manner "detrimental to the mainte
nance of good conduct" on campus. (A later column
will describe corrective steps being taken within the
fraternity.)
But this punitive action stemmed from University
and Interfraternity quarters, and Men's Council was
not consulted in the matter. Here was an issue in
volving disorder—a violation that should pass through
Council for Student Control jurisdiction—and outside
officials heard the issue and passed judgment.
In this Deke case the University interceded for
Men's Council because liquor violations were in
volved. Since that time, however, the University has
consented to let Men's Council have first jurisdic
tion on liquor cases as it has had in aLI other Fun
damental Standard cases. Men's Council had never
had that power before.
Within recent months Interfraternity Council has
tended to employ disciplinary powers formerly exer
cised by Men's Council on the basis that fraternity
violations should be handled within the Row family.
If such action were to continue Stanford would be
governed by a council here and a council there.
Decentralization would weaken Men's Council when
the absolute responsibility it must bear disappears.
Three of the men serving on Men's Council live
in Farm fraternities. They would be doing the Council
and the fraternities a great service by checking the
judicial powers of Interfraternity Council or any other
campus council overstepping its power.
Interfraternity Council can act as a hinge be
tween fraternity Fundamental Standard violators
and Men's Council by passing the cases to the
proper council for hearing. A closer working associ
ation should evolve between these two important
councils. Stanford is too small a community for two
independent councils for men. While Encina has a
Hall Council, this organization tries cases where stu
dents violate hall rules. Interfraternity Council func
tions, judicially, in maintaining house rules—some
thing Men's Council cannot control.

Fairness and equality tarnish when a group of
citizens maintain their own court whose use is re
stricted to the group's own members. How's aboul
Men's and Interfraternity Councils getting together
to hash out this wrinkle in student government.
