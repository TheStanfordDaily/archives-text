# Indian Cinder Men Face Eight-Year Jinx
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
It's been eight sad years since |
Stanford last turned back the Golden
Bear thinclads, but tomorrow in the
53rd Big Meet, things should be
different. At long last, the Cards
:00k ready, willing, and able to ruin
the galloping Bear.
Stanford's last victory over Cali
fornia was in 1940 when the Cards
romped to an 80V:> to 5012 Big Meet 1
win. Those were the days when (
Clyde Jeffrey was being called the
world's fastest human, and Card
Paul Moore was running 4:11 miles.
That was also the year that the
Card relay team licked everyone in
sight and later set a world record
at 3:12.9.
SINCE THEN, C al has come forth !
with middle-distance man Grover
Klemmer, pole vaulter Guinn Smith,
and sprinter Hal Davis. And the
Bears have had all their own way |
;n winning five straight Big Meets, j
Even with five straight setbacks 1
staring them in the face, the Cards J
still hold a lead of 26 to 24 in the
total 52-meet series. Two meets have
ended in ties.
Stanford has the honor of win- I
ning by both the highest and largest
scores of the series. In 1931, Stan
ford thundered past California to
win 101 1 5 to 29 4/5. Before that
in 1913, the Indians squeezed past
the Bears 61 1 5 to 00 4/5.
OUTSTANDING Big Meet records j
include Clyde Jeffrey's 20.8 effort I
in the 220, Cal's Dick Peters' 4:11.5 1
in the mile, and Jack Weiershauser's 1
23.2 in the 220 low hurdles. None of |
these will be touched tomorrow.
However, tomorrow's affair prom
ises to be one of the most thrilling
of an already thrill-packed series.
Stanford will be all out to break
the Bear win streak and also gain

a little revenge for the USC and |
UCLA setbacks.
CALIFORNIA came to life last i
Saturday against USC, and as a re
sult is being tabbed a tossup to
defend its winning ways against
Stanford. It is definite that the Bears
will be tough. Sore-legs Veiling in
the mile, Donnie Anderson in the
sprints, and high jumpers Bryant
and Hanger figure to add lots of Cal
points which might add up to give
Berkeley the nod.
Terrific duels are expected in the
440 between Indian Larry Ho IT and
Bear Bob Cooper, and in the 880
between Stanford Captain George
Grimes and Don Jackson of Cal.
Berkeley's Ted Rademaker also fig
ures to make things difficult in both
hurdle races. Stray points in any
of these races could prove the dif
ference.
Anyway, tomorrow is the day. It's
the 53rd running of the Stanford-
California Big Meet.

Card relay team licked everyone in
sight and later set a world record
at 3:12.9.
SINCE THEN, C al has come forth !
with middle-distance man Grover
Klemmer, pole vaulter Guinn Smith,
and sprinter Hal Davis. And the
Bears have had all their own way |
;n winning five straight Big Meets, j
Even with five straight setbacks 1
staring them in the face, the Cards J
still hold a lead of 26 to 24 in the
total 52-meet series. Two meets have
ended in ties.
Stanford has the honor of win- I
ning by both the highest and largest
scores of the series. In 1931, Stan
ford thundered past California to
win 101 1 5 to 29 4/5. Before that
in 1913, the Indians squeezed past
the Bears 61 1 5 to 00 4/5.
OUTSTANDING Big Meet records j
include Clyde Jeffrey's 20.8 effort I
in the 220, Cal's Dick Peters' 4:11.5 1
in the mile, and Jack Weiershauser's 1
23.2 in the 220 low hurdles. None of |
these will be touched tomorrow.
However, tomorrow's affair prom
ises to be one of the most thrilling
of an already thrill-packed series.
Stanford will be all out to break
the Bear win streak and also gain

a little revenge for the USC and |
UCLA setbacks.
CALIFORNIA came to life last i
Saturday against USC, and as a re
sult is being tabbed a tossup to
defend its winning ways against
Stanford. It is definite that the Bears
will be tough. Sore-legs Veiling in
the mile, Donnie Anderson in the
sprints, and high jumpers Bryant
and Hanger figure to add lots of Cal
points which might add up to give
Berkeley the nod.
Terrific duels are expected in the
440 between Indian Larry Ho IT and
Bear Bob Cooper, and in the 880
between Stanford Captain George
Grimes and Don Jackson of Cal.
Berkeley's Ted Rademaker also fig
ures to make things difficult in both
hurdle races. Stray points in any
of these races could prove the dif
ference.
Anyway, tomorrow is the day. It's
the 53rd running of the Stanford-
California Big Meet.

ford thundered past California to
win 101 1 5 to 29 4/5. Before that
in 1913, the Indians squeezed past
the Bears 61 1 5 to 00 4/5.
OUTSTANDING Big Meet records j
include Clyde Jeffrey's 20.8 effort I
in the 220, Cal's Dick Peters' 4:11.5 1
in the mile, and Jack Weiershauser's 1
23.2 in the 220 low hurdles. None of |
these will be touched tomorrow.
However, tomorrow's affair prom
ises to be one of the most thrilling
of an already thrill-packed series.
Stanford will be all out to break
the Bear win streak and also gain

a little revenge for the USC and |
UCLA setbacks.
CALIFORNIA came to life last i
Saturday against USC, and as a re
sult is being tabbed a tossup to
defend its winning ways against
Stanford. It is definite that the Bears
will be tough. Sore-legs Veiling in
the mile, Donnie Anderson in the
sprints, and high jumpers Bryant
and Hanger figure to add lots of Cal
points which might add up to give
Berkeley the nod.
Terrific duels are expected in the
440 between Indian Larry Ho IT and
Bear Bob Cooper, and in the 880
between Stanford Captain George
Grimes and Don Jackson of Cal.
Berkeley's Ted Rademaker also fig
ures to make things difficult in both
hurdle races. Stray points in any
of these races could prove the dif
ference.
Anyway, tomorrow is the day. It's
the 53rd running of the Stanford-
California Big Meet.
