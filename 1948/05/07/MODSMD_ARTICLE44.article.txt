The third time is the charm
—or so hope Stanford's erratic
diamond specialists as they
meet the favored California
Bears for the final time this sea
son. The game is set to begin at
3:15 p.m. in the Sunken Dia
mond.
Defeated by the Bears twice al
ready this season (7 to 3 and
9 to (j). Stanford will be out to make
a few changes. First, the Cards need
to beat the Bears to stay in the con
ference race. Second, they need to

beat the Bears just because they are
Bears.
DAVE DAIILE, two - time con
queror of UCLA and fancy flinging
southpaw, will be Stanford's starting
moundsman. Dahle is riding the
crest of a mid-season hot streak, hav
ing allowed only four hits in the
last 17 innings he has worked.
California's starting pitcher will
be papa Nino Barnise. He has a
strange way with Card batsmen and
has beaten them consistently for the
last two years. Barnise tossed a
three-hitter against Stanford in their
first meeting this season.
STANFORD CAN'T be counted
out of tomorrow's game. Harry Wel
ters men looked good in downing
UCLA, and man-for-man they rate
right along side of California. Wel
ters will probably start the same
lineup that ruined the Bruins.

The Bear outfield must be given
the edge, as John Fiscalini, Cliff
McClain, and Llye Painter form the
smoothest combination in the league.
But Stanford's infield can equal Ihe
Bears in anything they do. Charlie
Cole (.344) at first, and Biil Arce
(.333) at third can play with the
best. They are backed up by Buck
Brownson at short, and hard-hitting
Dave Melton at second.
Stanford's 3-5 season record does
n't compare very well with Califor
nia's 7-3 rating, but the Indians ex
pect to do things to that. A 4-(i rec
ord would raise Stanford to a pos
sible third place in CIBA standings.
HIE MOST AVID of Indian sports
fans will probably be worn out by
the time they move from the football
scrimmage at 9:30 a.m. to the Big
Meet at 1:45 p.m., to the baseball
game at 3:15 p.m., but a capacity
crowd is expected.
A slight fee will be charged at the
gate of the baseball game—a slight
fee that would get you into almost
any major league game.
STANFORD'S TIMID TAPPERS,
Frank MacGraw with a CIBA aver
age of . 163, Buck Brownson at . 166,
and Clyde Dingfelder at .156, are
actually better hitters than their av
erages relate. All three will be in
the thick of things tomorrow. It was
a home run by Clyde Dingfelder that
enabled Stanford to beat California
last year.
Blasting Bob Nava and Captain
Ted Nell round out Stanford's nine.
Both are good defensive men and ef
fective clutch hitters. Nell is lead
off man in the batting order, being
small and fast. He manages to get
on base consistently.
Bob Nava bats cleanup and is the
team's leading power hitter. He hits
the ball long and often, ranking third
among Card hitters with a .312 bat
ting average. Nava blasted out a
triple against California last time
they met.

moundsman. Dahle is riding the
crest of a mid-season hot streak, hav
ing allowed only four hits in the
last 17 innings he has worked.
California's starting pitcher will
be papa Nino Barnise. He has a
strange way with Card batsmen and
has beaten them consistently for the
last two years. Barnise tossed a
three-hitter against Stanford in their
first meeting this season.
STANFORD CAN'T be counted
out of tomorrow's game. Harry Wel
ters men looked good in downing
UCLA, and man-for-man they rate
right along side of California. Wel
ters will probably start the same
lineup that ruined the Bruins.

The Bear outfield must be given
the edge, as John Fiscalini, Cliff
McClain, and Llye Painter form the
smoothest combination in the league.
But Stanford's infield can equal Ihe
Bears in anything they do. Charlie
Cole (.344) at first, and Biil Arce
(.333) at third can play with the
best. They are backed up by Buck
Brownson at short, and hard-hitting
Dave Melton at second.
Stanford's 3-5 season record does
n't compare very well with Califor
nia's 7-3 rating, but the Indians ex
pect to do things to that. A 4-(i rec
ord would raise Stanford to a pos
sible third place in CIBA standings.
HIE MOST AVID of Indian sports
fans will probably be worn out by
the time they move from the football
scrimmage at 9:30 a.m. to the Big
Meet at 1:45 p.m., to the baseball
game at 3:15 p.m., but a capacity
crowd is expected.
A slight fee will be charged at the

fee that would get you into almost
any major league game.
STANFORD'S TIMID TAPPERS,
Frank MacGraw with a CIBA aver
age of . 163, Buck Brownson at . 166,
and Clyde Dingfelder at .156, are
actually better hitters than their av
erages relate. All three will be in
the thick of things tomorrow. It was
a home run by Clyde Dingfelder that
enabled Stanford to beat California
last year.
Blasting Bob Nava and Captain
Ted Nell round out Stanford's nine.
Both are good defensive men and ef
fective clutch hitters. Nell is lead
off man in the batting order, being
small and fast. He manages to get
on base consistently.
Bob Nava bats cleanup and is the

lineup that ruined the Bruins.

The Bear outfield must be given
the edge, as John Fiscalini, Cliff
McClain, and Llye Painter form the
smoothest combination in the league.
But Stanford's infield can equal Ihe
Bears in anything they do. Charlie
Cole (.344) at first, and Biil Arce
(.333) at third can play with the
best. They are backed up by Buck
Brownson at short, and hard-hitting
Dave Melton at second.
Stanford's 3-5 season record does
n't compare very well with Califor
nia's 7-3 rating, but the Indians ex
pect to do things to that. A 4-(i rec
ord would raise Stanford to a pos
sible third place in CIBA standings.
HIE MOST AVID of Indian sports
fans will probably be worn out by
the time they move from the football
scrimmage at 9:30 a.m. to the Big
Meet at 1:45 p.m., to the baseball
game at 3:15 p.m., but a capacity
crowd is expected.
A slight fee will be charged at the
gate of the baseball game—a slight
fee that would get you into almost
any major league game.
STANFORD'S TIMID TAPPERS,
Frank MacGraw with a CIBA aver
age of . 163, Buck Brownson at . 166,
and Clyde Dingfelder at .156, are
actually better hitters than their av
erages relate. All three will be in
the thick of things tomorrow. It was
a home run by Clyde Dingfelder that
enabled Stanford to beat California
last year.
Blasting Bob Nava and Captain
Ted Nell round out Stanford's nine.
Both are good defensive men and ef
fective clutch hitters. Nell is lead
off man in the batting order, being
small and fast. He manages to get
on base consistently.
Bob Nava bats cleanup and is the
team's leading power hitter. He hits
the ball long and often, ranking third
among Card hitters with a .312 bat
ting average. Nava blasted out a
triple against California last time
they met.

CLYDE DfNG
FELDER, hero of
last year's victory
over the champ
ion 15 ear s, has
been in a hatting
slump for the last
few games. Hut
Dingfelder's bat is
expected to play
an important part
in tomorrow's bat
tle with Califor
nia. Clyde banged
out a home run to
win last yea rs
Ca I game. He
plays right field,
and bats and
