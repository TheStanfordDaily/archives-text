FARM FOOTBALL GREATS of
past years, including Ernie Nevers J
and "Bones" Hamilton, are expected
to be on hand as members of the

present. Men such as Bobby Ander
son, Marty Anderson, Bob Ghilotti.
Mike Durket, Jack Barnes, and Ken j
Peck are not out for spring practice !
but will be on hand next fall.
SCHWARTZ will be without the [
services of four freshmen who are j
entered in the frosh track meet in

quarterbacks with the coaches sit
ting on the sidelines watching the
progress made by their charges since I
