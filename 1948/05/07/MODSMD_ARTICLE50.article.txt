sity netnien take on the Golden
Bears younger brother from West
wood tomorrow morning on the

This will be the second meeting
of the season between the two
squads, UCLA having downed tho
Indians, G to 3, two weeks ago in
Los Angeles.
Led by sophomore Herbie Flam,
and a smooth doubles player named
Gene Garriot, the Bruins have been
knocking off all competitors. Their
lone collegiate loss of the season
came against the powerful USC team
in a match that was not decided
until the final doubles score was
posted.
Coach Elwyn Bugge's netmen will
be out to notch their first win over
a Bruin tennis team since 1942. If
