# Poloists Play Pogonip Club
## 
### 
Stanford's crippled polo squad runs
up against its toughest competition i
of the current season Sunday when
the Pogonip Club of Santa Cruz in
vades the Farm for a six-chukker j
match. The meeting gets under way
at 10:30 on the intramural field next
to El Camino.
The Indians will go against the na
tionally-ranked Santa Cruz quartet
minus the services of its two stars,,
Captain Bill Dirker and Hill Foster.
The team's number two and three
men, Raoi Grether, and Todd Helser, |
are still recovering from injuries
incurred in earlier games, but
should be able to play.
Farm polo enthusiasts are ex
pected to turn out in large num- j
bers to see the Pogonip Club's stars, J
Dr. Frederic Barron and Maj. Dick j
Collins. Barron and Collins rank !
high among the nation's outstanding |
polo players.
However, on its showing against 1
the strong Woodside-Palo Alto team
last week, the Farm squad expects |
to make a good showing against the
touted Pogonips. The Indians are I
riding on the crest of a one-game '
winning streak, having beaten the
Palo Alto team, 4 to 1, last Sunday
after tying Stockton's Central Val
ley squad, 4 to 4, in seven chukkers
the previous weekend.
