# 'Buck a Month' Club Aids Farm Athletes
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Confeience rules prevent the subsidy of college
athletes, but a worthy organization, the Buck of the Month Club
has taken financial interest in aiding needy Stanford athletes to
' pay their tuition.
This club, separate from the University, contributes money

♦directly to the school strictly in ac
, cordance with the conference rules,
j The aid has marked importance,
i since the tuition has reached an
i all-time high.
Made up 04' Stanford alumni and
other interested sports-minded per
sons, the Buck of the Month Club
! operates on the principle that an
; athlete, after practicing two to three
; hours each day, has little time left
J for part-time jobs. He cannot be
| come self-sufiicient and still main
) lain his studies and sports activities.
I Contributions of club members have
j thus made it possible for many cap
| able and worthy athletes to attend
5 Stanford.
HALF A DOZEN ALUMNI of
i Stanford University founded the 01-
i (.utilization in 19134. They started out
I by interesting other persons in con
i tributing one dollar each month to
j pay the tuition of athletes.
The very founders, who started
i out with a modest idea, would be
{ amazed that the club has risen to
a membership of 1 ,'JOO. Contribu
tions have increased so that there
are now many "Big Bucks," who
pay $100 or more a year to the club.
The largest individual donation is
recorded at $2,200.

j knowing he is promoting Stanford
I sports by helping a worthy ath-
J lete, the Buck of the Month Club
•; member receives tangible benefits.

l | cation for all Stanford football
[ games, and a monthly bulletin about
athletic developments on the Farm.
There is 110 formal organization to
I the club. It is operated by the steer
ing committee, which sets the poli
* cics, and the Buckkeeper, who ad-
I ministers contributions.
The only requisite required for
- becoming a member is the payment
of a minimum of $12 a year. Rec-
I ords are kept in the athletic office.

I Contributions of club members have
j thus made it possible for many cap
| able and worthy athletes to attend
5 Stanford.
HALF A DOZEN ALUMNI of
i Stanford University founded the 01-
i (.utilization in 19134. They started out
I by interesting other persons in con
i tributing one dollar each month to
j pay the tuition of athletes.
The very founders, who started
i out with a modest idea, would be
{ amazed that the club has risen to
a membership of 1 ,'JOO. Contribu
tions have increased so that there
are now many "Big Bucks," who
pay $100 or more a year to the club.
The largest individual donation is
recorded at $2,200.
