10 in the first game of the baseball
j triple-header with Cal. Bushong
i has nominated Jim Claypool, lanky
I right-hander, to handle the mound
j chores.
Jim started the first two games
I of the Cal series at Berkeley but
j was victimized by erratic support,

I be blond Bill Gear, Cal's ace who
set down the Cardbabes, 12 to 5 and
7 to 3, in the games at Berkeley.
Supporting him will be such stars
as Don Dodson at third base, Jim
Howe at first, and hard-hitting out
fielder, Howie Moran.
