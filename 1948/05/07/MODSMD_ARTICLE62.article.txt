### 
Increased speculation concerning
j the possibility of military conscrip
j tion has brought many student in
! quiries to the campus ROTC head-
I quarters.
Students who wish to join the
j ROTC unit in hopes that they will
j escape the possible draft cannot be
promised openings, according to
Colonel Basil H. Perry, professor
! of military science and tactics.
COLONEL PERRY said yesterday

that incoming freshmen next fall
will be given priority because they
will be signing up for the full four
year course. Veterans wishing to
take additional training will be ac
cepted at any time.
At the present, the military sci
ence department is maintaining a
list of interested students who will
be allowed to sign up for the fall
quarter if there is room. Registra
tions will be taken during pre-reg
week as long as the limited quota
remains unfilled, Colonel Perry said.
TIIE QUOTA can only be in
creased by orders from Washington.
A bill which recently passed the
House Armed Services Committee
would exempt all college students

in junior or senior ROTC courses
I plus all other ROTC students who.
joined 90 days before the bill goes
into effect as law, if it i.s passed.
Those with less than 90 days'
training in the ROTC would be eli
gible for the draft.
ANOTHER BILL being consid
ered by the Senate would exclude
all students in senior (i.e. college
ROTC, Colonel Perry said.
Stanford's ROTC unit established
a special two-year training course
at the beginning of spring quarter
for students who became interested
in the program following President
Truman's request for a draft and
universal military conscription las:
1 winter.
