# Thinclads, Crew Face Cal
## Crew Races At Estuary Tomorrow 
### BY BILL BETHKE 
Tomorrow morning at 10:30 the first
of the Farm's three crews will dig
their eight 12-foot oars into the wa
ters of the Oakland Estuary for the
big race.against University of Cali
fornia.
Frosh, jayvee, and varsity shells
will be pulling with all their power
and using all the know-how of sev
en months' accumulation that they
can muster in a do-or-die attempt
to best the highly-touted crew from
Berkeley.
The races tomorrow will be the
high point of the crew's rising star.
The Cardinal challengers, with a
heartening triumph over UCLA last
week tucked under their belt, will
be clashing with a Cal crew that
is good and will be out to prove
it conclusively.
The frosh boats will vie in the
first race which will start at 10:45
a.m., although the boats will leave
the boathouse for the starting line
sooner. The next tiff will have the
Cal and Stanford jayvee eights com-

HOW TO GET THERE — Cross

undeniably tough Cal team.
"This won't be any walkaway,"
I stated Coach A. A. Clark yesterday.
"It'll be close all the way, probably
I no more than half a length's differ

I ings failed to put a damper on the
I oarsmen's spirit, as they kept work

Doing their part toward putting
I the crew in top shape for the races,
Rickey's set the 34 team members

I stated Coach A. A. Clark yesterday.

I no more than half a length's differ

Rickey's set the 34 team members

Mr. and Miss ABC will be on
campus for the next two week's.

smoking Chesterfields.
Tomorrow morning at 10:30 the first
of the Farm's three crews will dig
their eight 12-foot oars into the wa
ters of the Oakland Estuary for the
big race.against University of Cali

will be pulling with all their power
and using all the know-how of sev
en months' accumulation that they
can muster in a do-or-die attempt
to best the highly-touted crew from
Berkeley.
The races tomorrow will be the
high point of the crew's rising star.
The Cardinal challengers, with a
heartening triumph over UCLA last
week tucked under their belt, will
be clashing with a Cal crew that
is good and will be out to prove
it conclusively.
The frosh boats will vie in the
first race which will start at 10:45
a.m., although the boats will leave
the boathouse for the starting line
sooner. The next tiff will have the
Cal and Stanford jayvee eights com-
