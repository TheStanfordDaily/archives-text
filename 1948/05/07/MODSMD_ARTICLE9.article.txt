The Block S Society re-organized
last spring after a number of years
of inactivity. Since then, the letter
man society has aided the SAC in
entertaining visiting athletes and
has prepared a regular program of
future activity.
PLANS FOR A TROPHY room on j
campus where athletic awards can
be adequately displayed have been
formulated by the Block S. Another
innovation sought by the society is
a Block S newsletter which could
inform interested alumni about ath
letics at Stanford.
Recognition of junior varsity
sports awards has also been dis
cussed by the Block S, according to
Publicist Grover Miller. Sugges
tions included a diamond-shaped
letter for junior varsity players.
