WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP
â€” The White House tonigh
sought to head off the threat

enth-hour "showdown" confer
ences in which President Trumat
was playing a behind the scene.-
role.
At 10:35 p.m. (EDT), after a day
of futile talks with union and car
rier representatives. Presidential As
sistant John R. Steelman, who is act
ing for the President in the crisis,
called union leaders back for an
: other parley.
HE ISSUED THE CALL only ?
I few minutes after another sessior
with the operators, concurrent wit
reports that the President will or
der the government to seize the line
unless the stalemated union-man
agreement wage dispute is broken ;
once.
Presidential Secretary Charles C
Ross kept the press advised of dt
velopments. Asked if Steelman w;
making progress toward a settlemeu
- Ross said:
"The only interpretation anybod
can put on these conferences i
i they're still trying."
THE CARRIER representatives re
! mained at the White House while
Steelman talked to the union men
| Ross hinted at the possibility of a
| later joint union-management con
| ference but would not elaborate.
President Truman remained in
office while the talks were going 01
but was being kept abreast of de-
I velopments by Steelman.
If the last-minute conferences fai'
I it was said on good authority, the
President will order the Office o
| Defense Transportation to seize tlu
I railroads and operate them.
THE SEIZURE order would be is
j sued some time tomorrow, less than
j 24 hours in advance of the 6 a.m.
Tuesday strike deadline.
STEELMAN'S last parley with the
unions and carriers broke up at 6:47
! p.m. with the Brotherhoods standing
; pat on their wage demands and the
j rail operators equally adamant
j against granting them.
The unions, Brotherhoods of Loco
motive Engineers, Enginemen, and
Firemen, and Switchmen, want $3 a
day more plus remunerative rules
changes. The carriers were willing
to grant only 14 rules changes and
I a $1.24 a day hike recommended by
| a presidential fact-finding board last
I March.
The carriers were said to be press-
I ing for seizure. They took the posi
tion tha they could not surrender to
the wage remands without making
similar concessions to the other rail
I unions.
