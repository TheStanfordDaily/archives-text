## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP).—
Strong sentiment has developed I
among House members for setting j
up draft machinery on a stand-by j
basis, instead of authorizing imme
diate inductions, a top Republican
leader revealed today.
The high GOP official, who de
clined to let his name be used, said
; he saw no prospect of Congress go- i
ing along with Rep. Lee Allen's plan
for avoiding the draft entirely by
offering $500-a-year cash bonuses to
voluntary enlistees.
HE PREDICTED that opponents
of the draft will rally around a plan
to put selective service legislation
on the books, but hold off the ac
tual calling up of men until the
President or Congress declares an
emergency.
Allen said meanwhile that he has
not yet decided whether to put up
a floor fight ior his bonus proposal.
The Illinois Republican, who heads
the powerful House Rules Commit
tee, said he is being deluged with
letters and telegrams supporting his
plan.
HE CONCEDED that the response
from members of Congress has not j
bee'n as enthusiastic as he had
I hoped, but said he plans to discuss
| the question again this week with
j other Republican leaders.
He promised, meanwhile, that his
| committee will make '"no effort to
delay the draft bill" which has been

approved by the House Armed
Forces Committee.
That bill calls for two-year in
ductions of men 19-through-25, and
is intended to bring the armed
forces up to a strength of slightly
above 2.000.000 mer.
