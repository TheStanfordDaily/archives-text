### 
WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP)â€”The
Air Force has imposed rigid new
security rules on aircraft and guided
misile information in an effort to
prevent "unauthorized" leaks to the
press and foreign governments, it
was revealed today.
Manufacturers and air force per
sonnel have been told to discuss clas
sified proects only when "required
in the conduct of official U. S. Air
Force business" and to remember
that "fishing for information is prac
ticed no less by the news-avid press
than the saboteur or espionage
agent."
New policies were drawn up by
Maj. Gen. L. C. Craigie. director of
research and development, at the
command of Gen. Carl A. Spaatz,
former chief of staff, after a number
of unofficial revelations had left the
Air Force extremely unhappy.
One of these was the fact that the
Bell XS-1 rocket plane had flown
faster than the speed of sound.
