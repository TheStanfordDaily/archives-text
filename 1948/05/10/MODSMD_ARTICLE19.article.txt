## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP).
President Truman has denied ru
mors that Russia has made over
tures to end the "cold war" or thai
Premier Josef Stalin wants to meet
with him in some neutral European
spot, Sen. Millard E. Tydings, D .
Md., revealed today.
The Senator said he asked the
chief executive about the reports at
the request of an unnamed Freder
ick, Md., clergyman.
"THE PRESIDENT answered m<
categorically with 'no'," Tydings
said in a radio speech (WBAL, Bal
timore).
Most of the rumors have been cir
culated in European capitals. They
have become more persistent even
though the President has state*-
again and again that he is always
ready to meet with Stalin but that
such a meeting must take place i::
Washington.
Tydings said he asked Mr. Tru
man whether Stalin "or anybody
representing Russia" had made ad
vances looking to an accord on dis
putes between the East and the
West. He also asked whether the
President had refused a bid to meet
Stalin in the free city of Trieste, in
Norway, or some other "neutral"
area.
THE SENATOR put forth a five
point program which he said the
Soviet Union should carry out be
fore any Truman-Stalin parley, but
did not indicate whether it had the
President's approval.
At the same time, Sen. Ralph E.
Flanders, R., Vt., called for a "major
effort at a general peace settlement"
between Russia and the Western
powers in the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly.
Flanders said the great powers
should "get down to brass tacks or
what each thinks is the matter with
the other, and what the possibilities
are for resolving their differences."
"A strong UN would be able to
give Russia the things for which she
has fought for centuries, such as
free access to the Mediterranean."
Flanders said. "Such a UN would
be able to control the Dardanelles.
Suez, Gibraltar—and we'd also have
to say the Panama Canal."
