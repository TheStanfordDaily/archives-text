# JAPANESE ECLIPSE
## 
### 
REBUN JIMA. Japan, May
(UP). —The prayers of 30 Japanese
school children were answered to
day. The sun peeped through over
cast skies just long enough for 200
scientists to see the total eclipse for
which they had planned for months
Yesterday the youngsters knelt or.
a narrow, dusty road amid scien
tific instruments which had been in
stalled in this remote seaeoast area,
and asked the gods to clear the skies
for the solar blackout.
