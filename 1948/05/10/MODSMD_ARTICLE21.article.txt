## New Clash Seen Near Jerusalem 
### 
JERUSALEM, May 9 (UP) —
Thousands of Jews and Arabs are
battling on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv
Highway 12 miles west of the Holy
City and planes of the Jewish Ha
ganah militia have entered the ac
tion, unofficial reports said tonight.
The reports were unconfirmed but
flares reflected from the area were
visible on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
c>
It was asserted that 2,000 Haganah
militiamen were battling an esti
mated 7,000 Arabs in an attempt to
clear the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv High
way.
SUCH AN ACTION would be de
signed to open the road in order
to avoid acceptance of an Arab offer,
under a Jerusalem truce, to deliver
food to Jews in the city while the
road remained closed to Jewish traf
fic.
Informants said that in the action,
in the vicinity of Bab el Wad, the
Palmach striking force of Haganah
was attempting to blow up road
blocks with the aid of planes.
The original Arab force was
strengthened by thousands who
made for the scene, informants said.
They reported that the fight was in
tensifying late tonight after a lull
at nightfall while Haganah awaited
reinforcements.
A UNITED STATES navy detach
ment, anticipating possible chaos in
Palestine when the British mandate
ends, arrived here today to set up
emergency radio communication fa
cilities at the American Consulate
General.
Lt. Heber L. Robertson, USN, ar
rived with 12 men and 9.000 pounds
of equipment to establish the com
munications station.
It is planned that if all other
communications fail, as is threatened,
the consulate still will be able to
maintain direct radio contact with
the outside world.
