i (UP) —United Nations circles re
ported today that a British bank
manager is likely to become the UN's
j "emergency mayor" for Jerusalem.
The Briton is A. P. S. Clark, man
| ager of the Jerusalem branch of
I Barclays Bank and a resident of Pal
estine for more than 30 years.
Arabs and Jews reportedly have
i agreed on Clark as the most satis
factory of several men being con
sidered secretly here and in Jeru
| salem after Great Britain ends her
mandate next Saturday.
In the only concrete step it has
taken during its emergency meeting
on the Palestine crisis, the United
| Nations General Assembly agreed
i last week that the "emergency
| mayor" should be appointed in or
j der to provide at least a shadow of
! authority in the Holy City when
British rule ends.
