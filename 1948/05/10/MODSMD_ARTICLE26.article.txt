# DAILY EDITORIALS
## We're Proud . . . 
### 
Half a dozen people have approached us since Saturday say
ing, "You ought to write an editorial on our crew. They've done
a terrific job."
We agree. The Stanford crew has been outstanding through
out the season and even in defeat is a group to be proud of.
It takes more than enthusiasm and love of the sport to get up
at 5:30 in the morning and row a few miles on the cold Bay
before classes. Nothing is much fun that time of the day.
Remember last fall's football team? Eight straight losses and
they still had the courage and determination —maybe even the
egotism —to think they could go into the Stadium and whip Cal.
And they almost did.
Those two groups of Stanford athletes typify what we think
is the most important element of any competition —the will to
win under any circumstances or to stick to it down to the last
bitter defeat. Call it spirit, morale, or what you will. If our
teams have it, we've got champion teams no matter how many
games or races they lose. That's the kind of team we can be
proud of.
