# CAMPUS OPINION
## Cancelled Privilege 
### 
To the Editor:
Now that the tumult and the shouting has died, let us analyze just
what has made the past election the most interesting, the most controver
sial and successful election ever held at Stanford. The most successful in
that the largest number of voters in the history of Stanford turned out in
the rain to vote on an issue that had become a controversy. If the students
and the Stanford Daily had been muzzled and not allowed to express their
opinions on a controversial issue both in The Daily and on the campus,
there could have been no democratic election. No matter who we may have
voted for, on whatever side we were on, let's remember that The Daily
proportioned equal space to both sides. That's democratic, that s Stanford.
. . . Let the Winds of Freedom Blow!
However, why should we not have the same privilege on national and
international issues? Your fathers had that privilege 20 years ago at Stan
ford. Who canceled it? And why?
Using Dr. Thomas A. Bailey's technique of "leafing through the yel
lowed pages" of the Stanford Daily of 1928, in a search for the facts, we
find that on the very day Presidential candidate Herbert Hoover returned
to his home on the Stanford campus to cast his vote (Nov. 5, 1!)28), equal
space was allotted on the front page of the Stanford Daily to opposition
candidate Alfred E. Smith!
Today, the average Stanford student is more alert, sharper, and getting
better grades than his father. The average age is higher, and 50 per cent
are veterans of a world war. With the excellent training that the political
science, history, and international relations departments supply, the Stan
ford student is in a better position to cut through the miasma of misin
formation, propaganda, and emotional thinking than is the "man on the
street," regardless of what his age is! A premium was put on this kind of
training during the war; why should It not be used to help solve the
equally vital problems facing America in its choice this November?
