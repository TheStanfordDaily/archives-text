To the Editor:
In defense of all Gl's at Stanford, one can't sit by and let B. M. Reiser's
letter of May 7 go uncontested. Helser declares that Gl's, heretofore un
able to afford Stanford, have come here now that their bills are paid and
are proceeding to "change all those things that had attracted them." Mr.
Helser goes on to uphold and defend Stanford as a rich man s school,
and actually, though he doesn't specifically state it, he feels incensed that
the veterans have made significant strides in bringing snobbishness down
to its proper low level.
I've never seen nor heard of Mr. Helser but I'd be willing to bet several
cups of Cellar coffee that he lives in a fraternity house, drives a new car,
and is a steady patron of Longbarn.
More power to the veterans —God bless em.
