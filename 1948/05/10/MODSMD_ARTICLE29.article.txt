## Perpetual Motion Machine 
### 
SEATTLE (UP). —Somewhere in the Northwest
today there is a machine which represents a half
million-dollar investment and half the life ol Peter
Mollow Ivanoff.
Ivanoff worked for 30 years in his $300,000 Seattle
machine shop to overcome friction. But he would
have bristled with indignation if you asked him,
"And how's your perpetual motion machine coming
along these days, Ivanoff?"
"He called it a co-motional motion machine,"
said Lawrence Vick. devout disciple of the brilliant
Bulgarian, who died here in February. 1945.
"He wasn't a failure—he had something, I'm sure
of it," Vick said.
"You could walk into his shop, twirl a shaft of
n multi-geared gadget. And you couldn't hold the
other end of the shaft with a Stillson wrench."
Today, Vick offers bis 20 years' experience as
machinist with Ivanoff to any engineer who is
willing to continue where the Bulgarian left off.
"But it would be much easier if we could find
that machine," he said.
Ivanoff, having no living relatives, bequeathed his
plant and machine to several Vancouver, 8.C., resi
dents who had subsidized his work with cash gifts.
Vick said he thought the frictionless machine was
gathering dust in some Vancouver warehouse, but
the 14 trustees claim the machine is still in Seattle.
"Ivanoff ignored the guffaws and chiding of
professors who referred him to basic physical laws
when he began bis experiments," Vick said.
But finally—after 30 years' work—he was ready
to unveil his invention and a large electrical com
pany sent an engineer to conduct tests.
"A battery of meters was attached and volumi
nous notes were taken," Vick said.
"The last meter was read. Immediately the en
gineer signed an affidavit claiming the machine
was free of friction."
But the engineer was signing his own dismissal
notice. "The company fined him on the spot, accus
ing him of wrongly connecting a meter," Vick said.
Vick, however, believes the engineer. No one
knows what Ivanoff thought, but shortly afterward
he began wasting away. The doctors said he died of
cancer. Vick thinks differently.
