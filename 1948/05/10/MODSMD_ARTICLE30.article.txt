# Throwback’ Myth Exploded
## 
### 
BERKELEY—There is no scientific basis for the
belief that black "throwback" progeny will result
from the marriage of one white person with another
of partial Negro ancestry.
This is the statement of Dr. Curt Stern, professor
of zoology at the University of California, in the
Journal of Heredity.
Furthermore, Dr. Stern added, present knowledge
of genetics makes it very unlikely that the "throw
back" can occur. A white person of remote Negro
ancestry has probably inherited few if any of the
genes which make for dark color. If married to an
other white person lacking dark color genes there
should be no more chance for a black child to be
born than in marriages of whites without Negro
ancestry.
Dr. Stern presented an alleged case which he in
vestigated personally. The allegation proved un
founded, and was based on word-of-mouth stories
which had reached the point of myth by the time
the story was related to Dr. Stern.
