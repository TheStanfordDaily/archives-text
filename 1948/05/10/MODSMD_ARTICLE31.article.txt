## History 1948 Disloyalty Trials Without Public Hearing 
### 
Article V of the Constitution of the United States
says, "No person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a present
ment or indictment of a grand jury." Article VI says,
"The accused shall enjoy the light to be confronted
with the witnesses against him."
It is, of course, an "infamous crime" to be dis
loyal to one's country. Yet according to the rules
announced by the government's Loyalty Review

Board it will be possible, in ef
fect, for a citi/.cn to be convicted
of disloyalty by an administra
tive tribunal, without a grand
jury indictment or trial by bis
peers and without being
fronted by his accusers.
Chairman Scth W. Richardson
of the Loyalty Review Board
himself says, "A charge of dis
loyalty to the government is a
perfectly terrible charge, carry
ing a lasting stigma." Yet he is
willing for this stigma to be im-

posed on American citizens without the protection
of their constitutional rights.
In a police state, where it is considered better for
ninety-nine innocent people to be convicted rather
than for one guilty person to go free, this procedure
would make sense. In the United. States, where the
passion for individual justice survives, it makes no
sense at all.
For the ancient right of the accused to confront
his accuser, this procedure would substitute the
word of stool pigeons, political graft, curriers of
political favor, and malicious gossips. For the pro
tection of a court trial, it would substitute the fist
of bureaucratic tribunal. For the guaranties of the
Bill of Rights, it would substitute the dangers of a
Gestapo.
To meet the objection of lack of confrontation with
source-witnesses, the board has outlined an elabo
rate hearing and review procedure. But this right
is so basic to our system of liberty that there can
be no substitute for it.
The board justifies its stand on the ground that
the government has as much right as a private
employer "to discharge for reasons which seem suf
ficient," and without hearing. This is a false prem
ise. In the first place, it denies the whole fact and
purpose of the Civil Service law. It also overlooks
the public stewardship and responsibility of govern
ment service.
If a government department or bureau is to have
the right to throw out employees without public
hearing and because of disagreement on political
issues, then the government may expect to retain the
services chiefly of persons of slight character or con
viction, who will change their opinions as readily
as they change their clothes.
If the Loyalty Board's procedure is permitted to
go into effect, with the FBI making the "loyalty
checks" as planned, I think there may eventually be
as pronounced a revulsion as there was against the
police state tactics invoked by the Attorney General
in the latter years of the Wilson administration. The
existence of machinery to spread the smear of "dis
loyal" on United States citizens without jury trial
and without confrontation with the accuser is in
tolerable.

tolerable.

Article V of the Constitution of the United States
says, "No person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a present
ment or indictment of a grand jury." Article VI says,
"The accused shall enjoy the light to be confronted
with the witnesses against him."
It is, of course, an "infamous crime" to be dis
loyal to one's country. Yet according to the rules
announced by the government's Loyalty Review

Board it will be possible, in ef
fect, for a citi/.cn to be convicted
of disloyalty by an administra
tive tribunal, without a grand
jury indictment or trial by bis
peers and without being
fronted by his accusers.
Chairman Scth W. Richardson
of the Loyalty Review Board
himself says, "A charge of dis
loyalty to the government is a
perfectly terrible charge, carry
ing a lasting stigma." Yet he is
willing for this stigma to be im-

posed on American citizens without the protection
of their constitutional rights.
In a police state, where it is considered better for
ninety-nine innocent people to be convicted rather
than for one guilty person to go free, this procedure
would make sense. In the United. States, where the
passion for individual justice survives, it makes no
sense at all.
For the ancient right of the accused to confront
his accuser, this procedure would substitute the
word of stool pigeons, political graft, curriers of
political favor, and malicious gossips. For the pro
tection of a court trial, it would substitute the fist
of bureaucratic tribunal. For the guaranties of the
Bill of Rights, it would substitute the dangers of a
Gestapo.
To meet the objection of lack of confrontation with
source-witnesses, the board has outlined an elabo
rate hearing and review procedure. But this right
is so basic to our system of liberty that there can
be no substitute for it.
The board justifies its stand on the ground that
the government has as much right as a private
employer "to discharge for reasons which seem suf
ficient," and without hearing. This is a false prem
ise. In the first place, it denies the whole fact and
purpose of the Civil Service law. It also overlooks
the public stewardship and responsibility of govern
ment service.
If a government department or bureau is to have
the right to throw out employees without public
hearing and because of disagreement on political
issues, then the government may expect to retain the
services chiefly of persons of slight character or con
viction, who will change their opinions as readily
as they change their clothes.
If the Loyalty Board's procedure is permitted to
go into effect, with the FBI making the "loyalty
checks" as planned, I think there may eventually be
as pronounced a revulsion as there was against the
police state tactics invoked by the Attorney General
in the latter years of the Wilson administration. The
existence of machinery to spread the smear of "dis
loyal" on United States citizens without jury trial
and without confrontation with the accuser is in
tolerable.
