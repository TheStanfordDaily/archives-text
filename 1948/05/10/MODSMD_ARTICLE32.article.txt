A few weeks ago, one of the San Francisco Chron
icle sports columnists suggested that the Stanford
Stadium with its 90,000 seats be opened each Jan
uary 1 for the East-West Shrine game. Receipts from
the game, he said, would be appreciably larger than
Kezar Stadium's 50,000-seat sale each year. Costs for
use of the Stadium facilities would be financed by

game receipts, and the Shrine
charity still would receive a very
large donation increase from the
event.
An important University offi
cial said such University facili
ties could not be rented out—
even to such worthwhile chari
ties as the Shriners. He said
many worthwhile organizations
financed by public donations
have approached the University
for use of its building facilities.
These requests have been re-

fused in the past on a basis of precedent; if one is
accepted, then the others must be acknowledged or
else the University will be labeled as an institution
that practices discrimination against charities.
From (he Administration's position that reasoning
seems sound and fair. From the public's viewpoint,
however, the deduction is illogical and weak.
1. First of all, I believe there is an overuse of
(hat word ogre "precedent.'' This school rests on tog
firm a footing to seek relief from such a six-bit word.
The University has not been officially approached
for use of the Stadium for an East-West football
game, but the official's opinion was indicative of (he
answer (he Shriners would receive.
Too many requests are being refused by Stanford
on (he sole basis that a precedent would be set. The
University, however, is not the only party utilizing
such a weak excuse. Students and student organi
zations also are guilty of overuse of a formerly re
spected term.

Opponents to the election campaign expenses
bill last year argued that it had once been tried and
had failed when the system got out of hand. Elec
tioneering got out of hand this quarter, but now
Excom is trying to find a solution to the problem
and still retain campaign expenditures if the student
body wants the system.
2. Secondly, this cxcuse of settiiifj a precedent is
illogical because the Stadium would be used by
the Shriners during a vacation period when no stu
dents were here and at a time when the University
would have no other use for the plant.
Use of the Stadium would be paid for by game
receipts. More important yet is the free, beneficial
publicity Stanford University would receive as radio
announcers and reporters described the Stadium and
the Farm to sports fans throughout the country.
Stanford does have the largest collegiate stadium in
the world, and we do go to one of the most beauti
fully designed schools in the country.
The above reasoning is weak, but it is a good point
to bring up in regard to the use of our Stadium
for the Shrine game.
Stronger reasoning attacks this business of ac
cepting one charity and discriminating against all of
the other charitable organizations if the school re
fused them campus facilities.
Accepting the request of one charity floes not
have to involve the University in every other char
ity that comes along. An individual or an organi
zation is not a discriminatory one in the sense of
ill will if one charity is accepted and another one is
refused. Many groups approach Stanford for space
just as they approach private citizens for monetary
support. Both Stanford and the citizens draw a line
for these groups because of the ability to contribute.
Refusing all charities on the basis that you cannot
contribute to all of their goals is stinginess, and that
is the point where discrimination against charities
begins.

cial said such University facili
ties could not be rented out—
even to such worthwhile chari
ties as the Shriners. He said
many worthwhile organizations
financed by public donations
have approached the University
for use of its building facilities.
These requests have been re-

fused in the past on a basis of precedent; if one is
accepted, then the others must be acknowledged or
else the University will be labeled as an institution
that practices discrimination against charities.
From (he Administration's position that reasoning
seems sound and fair. From the public's viewpoint,
however, the deduction is illogical and weak.
1. First of all, I believe there is an overuse of
(hat word ogre "precedent.'' This school rests on tog
firm a footing to seek relief from such a six-bit word.
The University has not been officially approached
for use of the Stadium for an East-West football
game, but the official's opinion was indicative of (he
answer (he Shriners would receive.
Too many requests are being refused by Stanford
on (he sole basis that a precedent would be set. The
University, however, is not the only party utilizing
such a weak excuse. Students and student organi
zations also are guilty of overuse of a formerly re
spected term.

Opponents to the election campaign expenses
bill last year argued that it had once been tried and
had failed when the system got out of hand. Elec
tioneering got out of hand this quarter, but now
Excom is trying to find a solution to the problem
and still retain campaign expenditures if the student
body wants the system.
2. Secondly, this cxcuse of settiiifj a precedent is
illogical because the Stadium would be used by
the Shriners during a vacation period when no stu
dents were here and at a time when the University
would have no other use for the plant.
Use of the Stadium would be paid for by game
receipts. More important yet is the free, beneficial
publicity Stanford University would receive as radio
announcers and reporters described the Stadium and
the Farm to sports fans throughout the country.
Stanford does have the largest collegiate stadium in
the world, and we do go to one of the most beauti
fully designed schools in the country.
The above reasoning is weak, but it is a good point
to bring up in regard to the use of our Stadium
for the Shrine game.
Stronger reasoning attacks this business of ac
cepting one charity and discriminating against all of
the other charitable organizations if the school re
fused them campus facilities.
Accepting the request of one charity floes not
have to involve the University in every other char
ity that comes along. An individual or an organi
zation is not a discriminatory one in the sense of
ill will if one charity is accepted and another one is
refused. Many groups approach Stanford for space
just as they approach private citizens for monetary
support. Both Stanford and the citizens draw a line
for these groups because of the ability to contribute.
Refusing all charities on the basis that you cannot
contribute to all of their goals is stinginess, and that
is the point where discrimination against charities
begins.

A few weeks ago, one of the San Francisco Chron
icle sports columnists suggested that the Stanford
Stadium with its 90,000 seats be opened each Jan
uary 1 for the East-West Shrine game. Receipts from
the game, he said, would be appreciably larger than
Kezar Stadium's 50,000-seat sale each year. Costs for
use of the Stadium facilities would be financed by

game receipts, and the Shrine
charity still would receive a very
large donation increase from the
event.
