the psychology department and will
provide a statistically accurate
cross-section of student opinion on
questions suggested by Hawley
Smith, chairman of the Honor Code
Standing Committee.
SMITH STATED yesterday that
his committee is interested in learn
ing ju.st how students feel about the
working of the Honor Code and the
degree of severity to be imposed in
the punishment of Code violators.
"We want to tailor the workings
of the Honor Code to the student
body," Smith said. "We want to
strengthen the feeling of honor in
academic work, not to scare stu
dents out of cheating.
"WE WANT to publish as far as
possible the standards wanted by
most Stanfordites so that next fall
every old student here on campus
will be a salesman of the Honor
System."
Honor Code Committee is now re
writin gthe Honor Code information
booklets which serve to acquaint
Ireshmen with the Code's function
