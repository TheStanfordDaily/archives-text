# Barnes Cites Warnings of Wallace
## 
### 
The cold war is not the problem
today for it is already upon us.
Rather, actual war is the problem;
it is what we must stop. "Henry
Wallace has said, 'The choice in
the coming election is between war
and peace.' My only hope is that
*,ve will still be at peace by the time
of the coming election."
Such was the warning issued by
Forrest Barnes, screen and radio
writer, in his Friday night speech
before a meeting sponsored by
Stanford Students for Wallace at
the Palo Alto Community Center.
ERNEST SOROTSKIN, teahing
assistant in political science, began
his address with a 30-second pause
for bomb throwing. This was in
reference to the incident which oe
curred at the last Wallace meeting.
" 'Communist' has become the la
bel of the day," Sorotskin said. "The
label is intended to put an end to all

argument." If, he continued, you
become indiscriminate enough in
the use of such labels, they will soon
become meaningless and expend
their force as epithets.
"How we go over this particular
hump in civil liberties may very
well determine the shape of Amer
ica's things to come," Sorotskin con
cluded.
"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE," asserted
Barnes, "for us to go into a war
today until the voices of opposition
are hushed," This is the reason for
the current attack on our civil lib
erties, to make it impossible for the
opposition to be heard.
That is why Baines feels that the
danger of war by November is a
real one. The most effective way,
he claimed, to defeat Wallace is to
have war by election time since
"Wallace could never be a war can
didate."
