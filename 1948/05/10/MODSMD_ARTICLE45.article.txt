# Cubs Beat Farm Frosh
## 
### 
Mainly due to the 19-point scoring
â™¦
efforts of a Cal freshman, the Stan- |
ford frosh track team came out on
the short end of a 70 2/3 to 60 1/3 !
score. The Cal iron man was Walt j
Briant, who put three firsts, one sec
ond, and one third together for his
huge point total.
Cal started off with an early lead,,
taking first and third in the mile, j
and first and second in the javelin.
Cal held onto this lead until the 100-
yard dash, when Stanford surprised
by sweeping all places.
A similar sweep of the 220-yard ]
dash would have placed the decision
of the meet in the hands of the relay
runners, a reversal of form of the
sprinters gave Stanford only a third, s
This cost the Indians the meet, as ]
the relay team ran away from Cal
to win in 3:29.
