# California Captures Fifty-third Big Meet
## 
### 
Stanford's luckless track and field squad receipted for its sixth
straight Big Meet loss Saturday, 76 to 55.
The contract was drawn up earlier in the week when it became
evident that Cards Gay Bryan and Steve McKee would not be
at top efficienecy for the meet. But the Indians signed on the

dotted line Saturday as several Cal
performers literally "came out of
nowhere" to cop critical points that
had been conceded to Stanford by
the pre-meet dopesters.
OFF PREVIOUS performances,
the Indians were picked to take
first in the pole vault, broad jump,
low hurdles, 880, and to sweep the
shot. That wasn't the way things
turned out in the Stadium Saturday.
The first indication that it was
Cal's day came when Flank Frie
denbach tossed the 16-pound shot
two feet further than his previous
best mark to take second behind
Stanford's Otis Chandler.
Bear Bill Paddock surprised in the
pole vault. The sophomore's 13 foot
10 inch vault was the best he has
ever done. Bill Larson of the In
dians, who was the pre-meet favor
ite, cleared the bar at 13 ft. 6 in. with
a lot to spare, but could not repeat
at the higher mark.
TIIE RACE that really broke the
Indian's back was the half mile.
Bears Dick Cotton and Don Jackson
reeled off a surprisingly fast sec
ond lap, and Captain George Grimes'
stretch drive was too late to catch
the Cal speedsters. Grimes made up
for his defeat by running a tremen
dous relay lap that set the Cards up
with a commanding lead, which was
never overtaken.
A new meet record was set in
the high hurdles, as the Indians
swept the event. Dan-ell Kreitz ram
bled over the course in 14.4 seconds,
closely followed by Downing McKee
and Dell Russell. The old record
was 14.5 seconds by Sammy Klop
stock of Stanford in 1935.
Bud Held, ace Card javelin throw
er. equalled his best mark in this
event when he heaved the javelin 212
feet 5 inches, one of the bright spots
in the meet for the Indians, as was
Larry Hoff's 48.7 in the quarter mile.
Double winners in the meet were
Donnie Anderson, who captured the
sprints, and Kaare Vefling, who
grabbed both the mile and two mile.
In the mile, Card A 1 Lyons ran his
best race of the year, when he turned
on a burst of speed in the last few
yards to take a close second place.

the Indians were picked to take
first in the pole vault, broad jump,
low hurdles, 880, and to sweep the
shot. That wasn't the way things
turned out in the Stadium Saturday.
The first indication that it was
Cal's day came when Flank Frie
denbach tossed the 16-pound shot
two feet further than his previous
best mark to take second behind
Stanford's Otis Chandler.
Bear Bill Paddock surprised in the
pole vault. The sophomore's 13 foot
10 inch vault was the best he has
ever done. Bill Larson of the In
dians, who was the pre-meet favor
ite, cleared the bar at 13 ft. 6 in. with
a lot to spare, but could not repeat
at the higher mark.
TIIE RACE that really broke the
Indian's back was the half mile.
Bears Dick Cotton and Don Jackson
reeled off a surprisingly fast sec
ond lap, and Captain George Grimes'
stretch drive was too late to catch
the Cal speedsters. Grimes made up
for his defeat by running a tremen
dous relay lap that set the Cards up
with a commanding lead, which was
never overtaken.
A new meet record was set in
the high hurdles, as the Indians
swept the event. Dan-ell Kreitz ram
bled over the course in 14.4 seconds,
closely followed by Downing McKee
and Dell Russell. The old record
was 14.5 seconds by Sammy Klop
stock of Stanford in 1935.
Bud Held, ace Card javelin throw
er. equalled his best mark in this
event when he heaved the javelin 212
feet 5 inches, one of the bright spots
in the meet for the Indians, as was
Larry Hoff's 48.7 in the quarter mile.
Double winners in the meet were
Donnie Anderson, who captured the
sprints, and Kaare Vefling, who
grabbed both the mile and two mile.
In the mile, Card A 1 Lyons ran his
best race of the year, when he turned
on a burst of speed in the last few
yards to take a close second place.
Stanford's luckless track and field squad receipted for its sixth
straight Big Meet loss Saturday, 76 to 55.
The contract was drawn up earlier in the week when it became
evident that Cards Gay Bryan and Steve McKee would not be
at top efficienecy for the meet. But the Indians signed on the

dotted line Saturday as several Cal
performers literally "came out of
nowhere" to cop critical points that
had been conceded to Stanford by
the pre-meet dopesters.
