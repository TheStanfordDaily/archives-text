# Cards 10, Cal 7
## Big Eighth Inning Gives Labrum Win 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Pounding out five runs in a
wild and wooly eighth inning,
Stanford's climbing baseballers
finished fast to destroy Califor
nia, 10 to 7, Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond. The grandstand
was completely filled—and chilled
by the cold wind—as the Cards came
from behind to ruin California's
hopes of making a clean sweep of
the day's athletic program.
Stanford handed the Bears their
fourth straight loss and blasted Cali
fornia's hopes for winning the CIBA
championship in a game that was
packed with wierd fielding plays,
long hitting, and finally a slam-bang
finish. The Cards moved up a whole
notch in the loop standings, passing
UCLA and coming within a game of
third-place Santa Clara.
FRANK LABRUM, who relieved
starter Dave Dahle in the fifth in
ning, was credited with a well
earned victory, and Bootnose Nino
Barnise of the Bears was given the
loss. It was Nino's first loss to Stan
ford.
The gam.? lasted a long two hours
and 45 minutes as it developed into a
loose, free-scoring contest. Several
bitter disputes, most of them started
by Cal's coach, Clint Evans, also
helped to delay matters.
The Bears looked strong in the
early innings, and the Indians
trailed until the eighth when they
must have decided that California
had won enough for the day. Ted
Nell started things of! with a single,
George Sloat reached first when
Bear second-baseman Boots Erb
erred, and Charlie Cole singled to
drive in the first run of the inning.
CATCHER FRANK MacGRAW
came through with a double to score
Sloat for the second run and Bob
Nava was walked intentionally to
load the bases. John Claypool,
pinch hitting for Dave Melton struck
out, but when the ball got away
from the catcher, both Cole and
MacGraw came roaring home.
This was too much for the Bears,
as they stormed after the umpire
decided that the ball was dead on
the play and sent MacGraw and
Cole back to their bases.
Bill Arce rolled out to third scor
ing Cole, and Buck Brownson
slashed out a long single to bring
in two more. Frank Labrum put
the finishing touches to Barnise

when he singled for the fifth hit
of the inning. Relief hurler Don
Johnson finally ended the on
slaught by striking out Nell who
was batting for the second time that
inning.
WITH VICTORY IN his grasp,
Labrum started to get into trou
ble in the ninth by walking two
men. but third-baseman Bil Arte
pounced on a hard-hit grounder to
starta double-play (Arce to Mason
to Cole) that ended the game for
good and gave the Cards their first
win of the season over California.
Charlie Cole had a perfect day at
the plate, picking up three for three
and zooming his CIBA average to
a skyscraping ,4(K5. Ted Nell and
Buck Brownson both collected two
hits as Stanford outhit the Bears,
11 to 8.

California 300-120-100— 7

CAPTAIN TED NELL hit two for
four Saturday as Stanford defeated
the California Bears, 10 to 7, on
the Sunken Diamond.
Pounding out five runs in a
wild and wooly eighth inning,
Stanford's climbing baseballers
finished fast to destroy Califor
nia, 10 to 7, Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond. The grandstand
was completely filled—and chilled
by the cold wind—as the Cards came
from behind to ruin California's
hopes of making a clean sweep of
the day's athletic program.
Stanford handed the Bears their
fourth straight loss and blasted Cali
fornia's hopes for winning the CIBA
championship in a game that was
packed with wierd fielding plays,
long hitting, and finally a slam-bang
finish. The Cards moved up a whole
notch in the loop standings, passing
UCLA and coming within a game of
third-place Santa Clara.
FRANK LABRUM, who relieved
starter Dave Dahle in the fifth in
ning, was credited with a well
earned victory, and Bootnose Nino
Barnise of the Bears was given the
loss. It was Nino's first loss to Stan
ford.
The gam.? lasted a long two hours
and 45 minutes as it developed into a
loose, free-scoring contest. Several
bitter disputes, most of them started
by Cal's coach, Clint Evans, also
helped to delay matters.
The Bears looked strong in the
early innings, and the Indians
trailed until the eighth when they
must have decided that California
had won enough for the day. Ted
Nell started things of! with a single,
George Sloat reached first when
Bear second-baseman Boots Erb
erred, and Charlie Cole singled to
drive in the first run of the inning.
CATCHER FRANK MacGRAW
came through with a double to score
Sloat for the second run and Bob
Nava was walked intentionally to
load the bases. John Claypool,
pinch hitting for Dave Melton struck
out, but when the ball got away
from the catcher, both Cole and
MacGraw came roaring home.
This was too much for the Bears,
as they stormed after the umpire
decided that the ball was dead on
the play and sent MacGraw and
Cole back to their bases.
Bill Arce rolled out to third scor
ing Cole, and Buck Brownson
slashed out a long single to bring
in two more. Frank Labrum put
the finishing touches to Barnise

when he singled for the fifth hit
of the inning. Relief hurler Don
Johnson finally ended the on
slaught by striking out Nell who

inning.
