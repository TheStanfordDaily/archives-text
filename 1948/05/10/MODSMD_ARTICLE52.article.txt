Some 2,000 fans were on hand
Saturday for a spring intrasquad
football game that saw Tom Shaw's
White team down Don Campbell's
Reds by a 13 to 0 count.
Shaw had the use of two exper
ienced backs who made up the dif
ference of the two squads. Fast
starting A 1 Turriziani and Jim Naf
ziger were in the collective hairs of
the Reds all morning.
Nafziger scored in the first quarter
for the Whites. He rounded right
end after a 12-play sequence had
placed the ball on the six-yard line.
The second marker came in the
fourth period and was the work of
Turriziani. He romped 38 yards from
his own 41-yard line on a tackle
trap play, swept right end for a
first down, and then plunged over
from three yards out to score.
Freshman Bob Oswald added the ex
tra point to make the score 13 to 0.
The Reds let Campbell down in
giving him passing protection. He
was rushed and caught for a loss
several times, whereas Shaw had
plenty of time to spot his receivers
and throw.
Marchie Schwartz cited the play
of the Whites' starting ends, Don
En berg and Ken Rose. Both lads
did much to halt the outside attack
ol the Reds and forced Campbell to
take to the air.
