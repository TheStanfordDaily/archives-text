## 
### 
Stanford's fired-up crews rowed i
against the touted oarsmen ol' Cali- !
fornia last Saturday morning and ■
made the Bears work hard and fast
to beat them —so fast that all the j
crews rowing broke the course rec
ord.
The Farm eights came out on the j
short end all around, but they came I
home contented with the thought
that they had made the Bears row
a half minute faster to win than
was expected and were fired with
enthusiasm to work harder for an
other clash with Cal at the end of
the month.
TIIE FROSH shells met first in
what proved to be the closest race j
of the day. The Bear boat got off
to a quick start and pulled out to a ;
two-length lead at the halfway :
mark. Here the Card yearlings,
rowing at a steady 38 per minute
stroke, began to edge up.
Coming to within a length and a
half, they matched Cal stretch, drive
to fipish in 5:42, just five seconds
behind.
The jayvees, racing in an unfamil
iar shell which was hard to keep
on keel, got ofT to a slow start that
k|l>st them valuable distance but
fought back to come home three j
lengths to the rear in 5:42.8.
THE VARSITY also had keel
trouble, but they made up for their
disadvantage with a higher stroke

and gained toward the finish. Tl>
time was 5:43.
The machine-like Cal varsit
showed their great form and powi
as they rowed the 2,000 meters or
second faster than the Olympic rec
ord of 5:30.
