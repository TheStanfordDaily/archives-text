# RAIL SQUABBLE
## Passenger Runs Called Off Because of Threatened Strike 
### 
CHICAGO. May 9 (UP) — The<
threatened rail strike at dawn Tues
day already was crippling the nation
today.
While the government groped for '
a settlement of the dispute in Wash
ington, some railroads cancelled
crack passenger train runs for to
morow, forcing hundreds of persons
to seek other transportation.
MOST RAILROADS planned to i
- - . . -r-'- "-««*«■"1
stop handling shipments Of perish
able food and livestock after mid
night tonight to prevent spoilage.
Shipments declined over the week
end and food prices soared.
The pinch in passenger service;
was expected to be felt early even
though 150.000 engineers, firemen, j
and switchmen are not scheduled to
strike until G a.m. local time Tues
day.
I
BUT THE ROADS — which carry |
2.000.000 daily — began cancelling i
trains that could not reach their des
tinations by that time.
The New York Central System an
nounced that its 20th Century Lim
ited and other crack passenger;
trains would not leave Chicago to
morow.
Under strike instructions issued
by the unions involved, trains may j
leave on their scheduled times up to j
5:59 a.m. Tuesday — one minute |
before the walkout. Once the strike !
is in effect, however, the trains may .
run only to the nearest terminal j
where the crew ordinarily would be j
changed. \
MORE RAILROADS were expect
ed to act to cancels trans leaving
tomorrow that would be stranded
short of their destinations by the
strike deadline.
Embargoes on perishable freight i
discouraged shippers as early as Fri- j
day and fruit and vegetable prices
soared in New York and Chicago, j
Experts believed it would not take j
long for the increases to spread 1
throughout the country.
