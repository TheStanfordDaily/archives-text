# Rubinstein's Playing Lauded In Last Series Performance
## 
### BY JERRY DANIELS 
Artur Rubinstein presented the
last program of the 1947-1948 Stan
ford Concert Series last night in
the Memorial Auditorium. A greatly
impressed audience, completely fill
ing the auditorium, enthusiastically
applauded the artist.
The pianist opened the concert
with a presentation of a mediocre
composition—Toccata in C Major by
Bach-Busoni. Following this he
played three selections by Chopin
extremely well although with t
minimum of expression.
lii the last half of the program,
the pianist displayed the talent
which has made him world famous.
H'" a<?ile fingers seemed almost in
visible at times as he played four

very difficult compositions —
poli" by Poulenc, "Navarra" by Al
beniz, "The Maiden and the Nightin
gale" by Granados, and Stravinsky's
"Petrouehka." The last composi
tion for written for and dedicated
to Rubintein.
In the concluding number, the
pianist was at his peak. He played
the composition with what seemed
to be absolute ease. His compara
tive lack of expression in the be
ginning compositions disappeared
and this final number was full of
extremely expresisve passages.
The audience applauded the pro
gram enthusiastically in tribute to
the world-famous pianist. He played
itions by Debussy end De
falla as encores.
