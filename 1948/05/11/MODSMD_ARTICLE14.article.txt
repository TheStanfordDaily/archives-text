WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP) —
Government intervention into the
long-standing Colorado River water
war between Arizona and California
was opposed today by the Justice
Department.
Peyton Ford, assistant attorney
general, voiced disapproval of a bill
which would direct the government
to bring a Supreme Court suit to
settle the 25-year battle.
He asked instead that Congress
pass a bill which would merely give
government consent to any suit
started by one of the Colorado Riv
er Basin states. In that way the gov

ernment would not be an actual dis
putant.
I-'OIiI) SAID federal authorities
had no quarrel with any of the
states about the water and should
not attempt to settle interstate dif
ferences.
The Justice Department position
was put forward as a Senate In
terior Subcommittee opened hear
ings on the Supreme Court bill, of
fered by California and Nevada sen
ators.
Gov. Earl Warren of California
wrote the • subcommittee that he
thought there was "no alternative
but to favor a judicial determina
tion of the controversy." Nevada's
governor, Vail Pittman, and Sen
aors Pat McCarran, (D-Nev.) and
William Knowland (R-Calif.), also
endorsed the measure.
PITTMAN SAIl) thet *e was "no
other way" in which the barrier
now stopping the development of
the Southwest can be removed.
California charges that under in
terstate river agreements she is en
titled to Colorado River water that
Arizona now claims. The old con
troversy flared up anew when the
Central Arizona Project was pro
posed. It would require use of the
disputed water.
