### 
The Hague, Holland, May 10 (UP). —The unofficial Congress of
Europe voted unanimously today for the creation of a United
States of Europe which would include Germany.
The Congress, in plenary session, approved its political com
mittee's report calling for the integration of Germany into a fed-

era ted Europe and for the "con
vening as a matter of urgency" of
a European Assembly elected by the
Parliaments of participating nations.
The Congress also approved by
unanimous vote a report of its eco
nomic committee after Winston
Churchill made a stirring, unsched
uled plea for unity.
The economic committee's report
was rejected at first by trade union
ists who protested the wording of a
•clause urging that "workers to
gether with a 1! other groups inter
ested in production should be close
ly associated." Twenty French un
ions said employers could come un
der the clause.
THE ECONOMIC REPORT called
lor a European customs union and
•continent - wide currency regula
tions.
Spanish republican leader Inda
lecio Prieto, a former Spanish war
minister, made a dramatic plea for
passage of a resolution to create a
"caretaker government" for Spain,
but the resolution was referred to
the International Co-ordination
Commission of the Movement for
European Unity.
PRIETO DENOUNCED the re
gime of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco and said he was able to re
main in power only "because Eu
rope. so brilliantly represented in
this Congress, supplied him with es
sential materials."
The Spanish government is rep
resented at the Congress—the first
international body in which Spain
has participated since the war.
The Congress also referred a i*es
olution proposing further study of
the German problem to the Inter
national Co-ordination Commission.
