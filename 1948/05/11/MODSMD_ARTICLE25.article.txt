SEOUL. Korea, May 10 (UP) —
An estimated 6,000.000 Koreans
voted today in the first free election
in their nation's history, despite
communist terrorism which had cost
101 lives since Friday night.
A national election board spokes
man said 75 per cent of South Ko
rea's 8,000,000 eligible voters cast
ballots. In Seoul, the capital, 92 per
cent voted.
The votes were being counted to
night at nine heavily guarded cen
tral stations. No incidents were re
ported after the polls closed at 7
p.m., but tension remained high after
street fights, bombings, and sabotage
which marked the campaign. When
the polls closed, 101 persons were
dead, 62 seriously wounded and 233
were in jail.
Communists killed two Seoul elec
tion officials on a busy downtown
street, shot down two others in
Taegu, southeast of Seoul, and
forced half of the election staff to
quit on the island of Cheju, which
is in the U. S. occupation zone 50
miles south of Seoul.
Terorists dynamited a polling sta
tion at the port city of Pusan,
wrecking booths and shattering
windows.
