## An Orderly House 
### 
Applicable to organizations as well as states is the ancient
political maxim that "those who don't put their house in order
ran expect to have it done by others." When an organization or
state is willing to correct its own unruly house, society owes the
body encouragement, aid, and most of all a willingness to abstain
from intervention until it is demonstrated that the reformist moves
were not genuine.
Apropos of the latter precept is the case of Cardinals which
last week announced that "it shall henceforth cease to be a self
perpetuating society." That's a rather startling statement—even
to a Cardinal-baiter, It's an admission of present defects, sure,
but it's also a heartening sign when an organization will acknowl
edge its faults publicly and promise to reform.
The first and most apparent abuse—the tryout system —has
already been corrected. Previously, and to the aggravation of
many, Cardinal tryouts were performed in a slipshod manner
in which the interviewing body revolved from day to day during
the tryout period. Thus, any one Carrdinal seldom saw or talked
to each and every aspirant. Naturally those candidates who
backed a friend on the incumbent body who would give them a
plug were at a disadvantage.
During the three-day tryout period which ended yesterday.
Cardinals followed to the letter the system as set forth in the
ASSU Constitution. Three Cardinals, the ASSU vice-president,
and an Excom member sat on the interviewing board—the same
people for three days. Each applicant, whether a present Cardi
nal or a first-quarter transfer, was asked the same questions and
given an equal amount of time. Undeniably, personal considera
tions will enter into final selections, but Cardinals haven't boasted
of inventing a method to eliminate the personal equation.
As to the charge that Cardinals is a back-slapping society of
big wheels, the members will take exception. Being a Cardinal
member involves more than seeing your picture and name in
The Daily. Being chairman of Homecoming or Con Home week
involves many hours of thankless and painstaking organizing. If
'.he future shows that Cardinals are not fulfilling these obligations
well, or if what they do is apparently only for publicity's sake,
well, then is the time to ask "What goes?"
For the present, however, let's give them a chance to prove
Ihat their house is in order.—J. H. A.

edge its faults publicly and promise to reform.
The first and most apparent abuse—the tryout system —has
already been corrected. Previously, and to the aggravation of
many, Cardinal tryouts were performed in a slipshod manner
in which the interviewing body revolved from day to day during
the tryout period. Thus, any one Carrdinal seldom saw or talked
to each and every aspirant. Naturally those candidates who
backed a friend on the incumbent body who would give them a
plug were at a disadvantage.
During the three-day tryout period which ended yesterday.
Cardinals followed to the letter the system as set forth in the
ASSU Constitution. Three Cardinals, the ASSU vice-president,
and an Excom member sat on the interviewing board—the same
people for three days. Each applicant, whether a present Cardi
nal or a first-quarter transfer, was asked the same questions and
given an equal amount of time. Undeniably, personal considera
tions will enter into final selections, but Cardinals haven't boasted
of inventing a method to eliminate the personal equation.
As to the charge that Cardinals is a back-slapping society of
big wheels, the members will take exception. Being a Cardinal
member involves more than seeing your picture and name in
The Daily. Being chairman of Homecoming or Con Home week
involves many hours of thankless and painstaking organizing. If
'.he future shows that Cardinals are not fulfilling these obligations
well, or if what they do is apparently only for publicity's sake,
well, then is the time to ask "What goes?"
For the present, however, let's give them a chance to prove
Ihat their house is in order.—J. H. A.
