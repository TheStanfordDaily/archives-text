# CAMPUS OPINION
## Is This In Line?

To the Editor:
Last week Dean Kimpton, through the editorial columns of The Daily,
.listed in a very precise form the reasons that the Administration chose to
ban political parties and aspirants to political positions from the Stanford
campus. The adoption of such a positive policy by the Administration and
the announcement of such a policy to the students is very gratifying to
me, since the University does not usually deem it necessary to explain
the stand that it takes on most issues.
Congratulations to Dean Kimpton and the Administration on their firm
stand against the use of the University for a political football field.
However, it has been brought to my attention, through the local news
papers, that the University on its own account has acted completely in
reverse to its stated policy by inviting Dr. Buell Gallagher to deliver the
baccalaureate at the commencement exercises. For those who do not
know the why and wherefores of Mr. Gallagher, I will elucidate.
Mr. Gallagher is a minister from Berkeley, California, who is at present
indulged in a very vigorous campaign to get himself elected to Congress
from the seventh district. He has filed his candidacy on every political
ticket in the State of California, including Wallace's third party, and he
has secured the communist support in the area in which he is running.
In view of the University's position against politics on the campus,
I cannot for the life of me understand why, of all the ministers in the
United States that are well qualified to deliver the baccalaureate, Mr.
Gallagher was chosen. Is it that the Administration does not realize
that Mr. Gallagher is a candidate for a political office, or is it that
the Administraion does not believe that it must conform to iits stated
policy, and feels that they are the people to decide the political fate of
the University without interference from the student body?
I think that the students have a right to know why the Administration
has not conformed to its stated policy.

(Editor's note: The Committee on Public Exercises, charged with
speaker selection, stated that the commencement invitation was extended
to Dr. Gallagher in Februaryâ€”at which time liis political intentions were
unknown to the committee members. His selection, the committee said,
\\a>> based on his reputation as one of the area's leading clergymen.
His short commencement address will be of a religious nature and com
pletely ungermane to anything political.)
