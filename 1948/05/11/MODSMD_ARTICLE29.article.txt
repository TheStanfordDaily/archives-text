## Stands on One Finger 
### BY ROBERT MUSEL 
NEW YORK (UP).—Frank Furtner, who is billed
by the Ringling Brothers Circus as "Unus," stands
on one finger.
Any engineer, any anatomist, and any other acro
bat will tell you il is impossible.
After watching Unus mount a platform, place
his forefinger on a glass globe, and hoist his body
overhead—watching him through field glasses from
40 feet, mind you—l went backstage to find out
about it.
Unus is a pleasant, blond Viennese 39 years old,
five feet seven inches tall and 145 pounds in weight.
He has a striking wife, Valentina, who is in the act
with him. He has a blonde secretary, Frieda, who
serves as interpreter.
Unus knows English quite well, but pertinent
questions about his finger-raising trick are referred
to his secretary. She doesn't understand either.
I examined Unus' right forefinger. It looks like
any other, except a little stubbier than most. It
has three joints and a nail. It is flesh, blood, and
bone.
"Of course, you know," I said, "that it is im
possible to do what you do."
Unus grinned cheerfully. ,
"Ja," he said. "Impossible, ja."
"I have spoken to many acrobats," I said. '"And,
in fact, I was once understander in an act myself.
They all think you can't possibly do it. Many of them
have been coming here nightly to watch. They say
they would sooner believe an elephant could stand
on the tip of his trunk."
"Ja," Unus nodded happily. "Ja, impossible."
"So," I said, "what gimmick, what gadget do you
use? In other words, what is the trick?"
Unus looked at his secretary.
"Gimmick," he repeated. "What is that?"
His secretary shrugged.
'I practice eight years to do the trick," Unus
said. "First I make handstands on one hand. Then
I make handstands on one cane. Soon I do it on all
big buildings in Europe. Once I stand on cane on
top of ball on top of 25-story building. Ja."
"But the one-finger stand?" I persisted.
"Always I practice," Unus went right on. "I put
my finger in neck of champagne bottle and I fall
many times but at last I do not."
"I've heard of bottle stands before," I said.
"There's a fellow in Philadelphia who can stand on
two thumbs. But no one ever stood on one solitary,
unaided forefinger before. It's impossible."
Unus' face lit up.
"Ja," he beamed, "impossible."
