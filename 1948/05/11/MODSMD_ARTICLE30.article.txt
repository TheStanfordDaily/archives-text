# Haifa-Industrial Capital
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. D. C. â€” Haifa, thrust into sudden
focus in the Arab-Jewish conflict, holds clear title
as Palestine's modern maritime and industrial capital.
A drowsy Arab village until 1918, the city's growth
became spectacular after completion of its deep-water
harbor in 1933 and of the (500-mile pipeline from
the oilfields of Iraq in 1934.
Spurred by immigration from Central Europe,
Haifa's Jewish population quadrupled between
1931 and 1!)4(>. It was half of the citys' recent 130.000
total, notes the National Geographic Society.
Despite occasional cross-currents in this mixed
population, Haifa has now and then been cited by
qualified observers as lively proof that Jews and
Arabs can work together. Plans for a second big
pipeline from Eastern Arab oilfields and for adding
new industries supported their predictions that the
city would continue to grow mightily, unless political
calamity interfered.
Soon after World War I plans were made for a
landscaped Jewish quarter close to the Haifa port
area. As the city mushroomed in the 1930'5, how
ever, this garden-city project turned into a mod
ernistic mass of streamlined apartment buildings
holding the city's greatest population density.
The suburbs, where landscaped homes, villas, and
hotels blossomed, were pushed southward on the
slopes and clear to the top of Mount Carmcl.
From the 1.810-foot top of this mountain, famed
from Old Testament times, sunlight accents the con
trast of the white limestone city and the deep blue of
the Mediterranean.
From Haifa's new port with its vast man-made
breakwaters, orange ships and oil tankers move
out with heavy cargoes. Much of the Iraqi oil is
refined in Haifa before shipment to England. Citrus
groves, owned and cultivated about equally by Jews
and Arabs, produce six months of the year all
along the Palestine coast.
Pail and air lines have aided the growth of this
city on the Bay of Acre. Beside shipping and oil
refining, Haifa industries include cement and textile
mills, metal-working plants and cigarette factories.
Only the new all-Jewish city of Tel Aviv and ancient
Jerusalem are larger.
