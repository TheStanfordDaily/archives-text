ROME. May 10 (UP). —The American taxpayer
will be disappointed if he expect:-; his European Re
covery Program dollars to put Italy on her feet
quickly. Too much is wrong with this war-torn
country for an early cure.
Over the long haul, ERP will help:
If the political pot doesn't boil over.

If the government can hold the line against fur
ther inflation.
If the recovery money can he kept from leaking
into channels of political patronage.
At the moment the political scene is compara
tively quiet. The leaders of the 8.000.000 Italians
who voted Communist last month are not likely to
make serious trouble for the government while fresh
supplies and money are flowing in from America.
This should give Premier Alcide dc Gasperi a breath
ing spell in which to work out his economic reforms.
What are these reforms and how will the ERP
help put them into effect? Italian government and
American embassy people speak most frequently of
agrarian reform. This does not mean taking land
away from big absentee owners and giving it to
sharecroppers. It means making the soil produce
more, especially in the south, where the soil is worn
out and there is not enough rain.
The south needs reservoirs, irrigation systems,
and vast supplies of chemicals to bring the soil
hack to life. It needs roads from farms to markets.
Some richly productive valleys in the south are
so isolated they can't reach a profitable market
with their produce, and the growers have to sell
their fruit locally for a penny a pound.
So when the government talks of agrarian reform,
it means the government plans to build reservoirs,
aqueducts, and good roads in the south and fertilize
the land. It has no plan to reform sharecropping or
make local reforms, although De Gasperi tells visi
tors he is determined to expand the country's public
school system.
Obviously this is a long-term program. Even if it
begins at once, many years will pass before the
results can be seen in any index of Italian living
standards. For concrete results from this pro/ram
the Italians and American taxpayers will have to
wait.
The money for such projects in southern I tidy
will come only indirectly from funds appropriated
by the American Congress. The government expects
the main benefits of the ERP to be shiploads of coal,
wheat and steel. These products would be sold to
the northern industrialists and the government would
take payment in Italian currency—lire. The proceeds
would go into a big government lire fund.
It is from this lire fund that the government hopes
to pay for its program of land reform.
But where will the industrialists get the money
to pay for these raw materials?
That is where the threat of further inflation
comes in. If the industrialists insist on the govern
ment financing these deals and relaxing credit
restrictions again, the result is almost certain to
he inflationary. Inflation could ruin (he ERP.
As to recovery money leaking into the pockets of
politicians and their friends, that depends in the
main on the "competence and integrity of the men—
American and Italian—who administer it. The Ital
ians like to get rich the same as anybody else.
