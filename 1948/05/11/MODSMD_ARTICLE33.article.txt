## History 1948 
### 
The sorriest people in Germany today are those
living in the camps for displaced persons. It is true
that some of them may eat as well as the Germans,
and some of the DPs manage to keep themselves busy
after a fashion with handicraft industries or other
types of employment.

But the tragedy is that most of
them are well-trained, useful in
dividuals condemned to an ut
terly artificial, esentially useless
way of life.
Such people—natives of Latvia,
Lithuanian, Poland, the Ukraine,
and other Red-engulfed countries
—would make good citizens of
any land that opened its doors
to them; and some have. Belgium,
Canada, and a few Latin-Ameri
can countries to mention a few.

The United States Congress, however, has not passed
the Stratton Bill to admit 400,000 in four years.
It is heartening, however, that there is a growing
recognition—especially in the Middle West—that this
is a mistake. This region, whose agricultural popula
tion now is 21 per cent under what it was in 1920,
is waking up to the fact that it needs new blood, and
that these desirable potential citizens are knocking
at the door.
Both the governors of Minnesota and North Dakota
have appointed committees to work for the admission
of some of the DPs to their states. A similar com
mittee has been appointed in lowa, and others are
to be formed soon in South Dakota, Wisconsin, and
Nebraska. In Oklahoma a list of firm jobs open to
such immigrants already has been prepared to assure
Washington that they will not become public charges.
It is my hope, and it should be the hope of all
that truly possess the real "American way of life,"
that this practical approach to the problem will spread
wider and wider. From it can come the sort of evi
dence which Congress will be unable to ignore when
it is asked once again to admit at least carefully
screened DPs to the United States. Out of the reports
of such committees will come the sure knowledge that
thjs is not merely a matter of humanitarianism, but
also a way of strengthening the American nation.
