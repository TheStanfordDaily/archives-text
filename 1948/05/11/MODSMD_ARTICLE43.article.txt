# ODELL'S PLIGHT
## No Material — But What a Schedule! 
### BY BILL SWIGART 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series on Stanford's 1948 Pa
cific Coast grid opponents.)

If there was ever a coach "on the
spot," it's Washington's Howie Odell.
A shortage of material, the tough
est schedule in the country, and a
hostile alumni with a good record
for "getting" coaches that don't win
—all these problems and more went
with Odell's first contract as head
football coach at the University of
Washington.
Lynn Waldorf faced a similar
dilemma at Cal last year, only "Pap
py" inherited a line that could move
anything . . . almost, and his sched
ule was tame as a folk dance series
compared to the Huskies' nine-game
slate.
OPE NAGAINST GOPHERS
Washington will open against Min
nesota, the top team in the Big
Nine next fall, play seven confer
ence games with the best elevens
on the Coast, and close at South
Bend against Notre Dame. Need we
say more?
As for a great hoard of material
for playing such a schedule, it just
isn't there.
The all-lettermen squads that have
answered "Pest" Welch's whistle for
the past two seasons are gone, and
Odell finds himself with less than a
dozen holdovers from the Welch
regime. Of these, only three held
down starting jobs on the 1947 elev
en.
Added to his other troubles, Odell
Js up to his neck in the trials and
tribulations of installing the T i'or
nation at Washington. To effectively
replace the Notre Dame system,
which has been the vogue on the
Seattle campus for years, Howie
leeds a good quarterback, and the
Huskies are apparently fresh out of
such a commodity this year.
OTTELE TURNS PRO
They had a quarterback—one of
ihe best—until two weeks ago. Then
the news leaked out that Dick Ot

tele had signed a pro grid contract
with the New York Giants. Ottele
turned in his suit, and Odeil has
been on a wild talent search among
his ranks ever since.
Among the prominently men
tioned successors are lettermen Joe
Stone, Fred Wehde, "Whitey" King,
and freshman J. R. Savage. None
of these appears to have the
ability or general know-how
of the missing Ottele, however.
The line is Odell's other big prob
lem, as graduations have riddled
the Washington forward wall. Let
termen guards Alt' Hemstad, Wes
Carlson, and Bob Levenhagen will be
on call, but elsewhere the Huskies
are woefully short on experience.
End Ernie Stein, tackle Doug Vick
ery, and center Carl Fennema are
the only other returning linemen
who played much last year.
The ball carriers are as good as
any on the coast—one deep at least
—with Brooks Biddle, Marshall Dal
las, and Larry Hatch returning.
Newcomers Roland Kirkby and Jack
Seth have shown up well in spring
practice and should see plenty of
action come September.
A WINNING SEASON?
Coach Odell is a thorough man.
and you can bet your bottom dollar
that youthful mentor will leave no
stone unturned in an effort to make
his first year at Seattle a winning
one.
The 37-year-old coach created a
minor sensation when he erected a
35-foot steel observation tower on
the practice field, similar to the one
used by Frank Leahy at Notre Dame.
In addition, he has introduced such
novelties as an individual gi'ading
chart, a distribution chart as to the
effectiveness of his plays, and mo
tion pictures of every scrimmage.
Pity Washington against Bernie
Bierman's Gophers, but the Huskies
will have played a lot of football
by the time they invade Stanford
Stadium on October 30.
