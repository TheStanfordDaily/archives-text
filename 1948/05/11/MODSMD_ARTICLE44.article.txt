## Injuns Ready For Fresno Relay Meet 
### 
With the dust of the 1948 Big
Meet finally settled, all trackmen
are looking forward to the famous
West Coast Relays at Fresno this
Saturday.
Fresno is one of the fastest, if not
the fastest track in the country, so
new records are set almost every
year. This year, as ever, will find
the cream of the Pacific Coast ath
letes competing, but there will be
an even greater incentive for top
performance. The Olympic tryouts
are coming up soon.
IN ADDITION TO the four con
ference colleges, independent teams j
may send representatives to this!
meet. The Los Angeles Athletic I
Club, loaded with former Trojan |
stars, will be favored to take the
relays.
Stanford will send down a full i
team. Gay Bryan and Steve Mc-
Kee will not be able to compete. ;
but the team otherwise will be in '<
good shape.
Bud Held, who tossed the javelin
212 feet in the Big Meet, will receive
some mighty stiff competition. Held j
is defending champion in this event,
as he threw an identical toss of 212
feet to capture the title last year.
DR. JOHN SEYMOUR of the
LAAC will be tougw to beat. He
startled the world last season when
he heaved the stick 248 feet, just
a few feet short of the world's rec- j
ord. He hasn't hit top form as yet I
this year, but could easily hit in !
the 2205.
San Jose State's ace. Harry Likins,
is also a strong contender. One will |
recall that Likins beat Held earlier in j
the season with a toss of 210 feet.
Since then Likins has been steadily
above the 200 mark, and could let !
loose with a long one at any time.
BILL LARSON, Card pole vault
ace, will also have his hands full.
John Montgomery of the Trojans :
cleared 14 ft. 4 in. against UCLA j
last Saturday. This seems like im- j
possible task for Larson, but on a
good day he may do it.
Otis Chandler of the Indians will j
have to throw well into the 53s to
grab the shot put title. Last week- |
end Jerry Shipkey of the Bruins and j
Bill Bayless of the Trojans, both j
of whom Chandler has defeated, j
heaved the ball 53 ft. 5 in. and 53 !
ft. 4 in, respectively. Jim Delaney
of the Olympic Club and Wilbur
Thompson of the LAAC also cannot j
be counted out.

Stanford will send down a full i
team. Gay Bryan and Steve Mc-
Kee will not be able to compete. ;
but the team otherwise will be in '<
good shape.
Bud Held, who tossed the javelin
212 feet in the Big Meet, will receive
some mighty stiff competition. Held j
is defending champion in this event,
as he threw an identical toss of 212
feet to capture the title last year.
DR. JOHN SEYMOUR of the
LAAC will be tougw to beat. He
startled the world last season when
he heaved the stick 248 feet, just
a few feet short of the world's rec- j
ord. He hasn't hit top form as yet I
this year, but could easily hit in !
the 2205.
San Jose State's ace. Harry Likins,
is also a strong contender. One will |
recall that Likins beat Held earlier in j
the season with a toss of 210 feet.
Since then Likins has been steadily
above the 200 mark, and could let !
loose with a long one at any time.
BILL LARSON, Card pole vault
ace, will also have his hands full.
John Montgomery of the Trojans :
cleared 14 ft. 4 in. against UCLA j
last Saturday. This seems like im- j
possible task for Larson, but on a
good day he may do it.
Otis Chandler of the Indians will j
have to throw well into the 53s to
grab the shot put title. Last week- |
end Jerry Shipkey of the Bruins and j
Bill Bayless of the Trojans, both j
of whom Chandler has defeated, j
heaved the ball 53 ft. 5 in. and 53 !
ft. 4 in, respectively. Jim Delaney
of the Olympic Club and Wilbur
Thompson of the LAAC also cannot j
be counted out.
With the dust of the 1948 Big
Meet finally settled, all trackmen
are looking forward to the famous
West Coast Relays at Fresno this
Saturday.
Fresno is one of the fastest, if not
the fastest track in the country, so
new records are set almost every
year. This year, as ever, will find
the cream of the Pacific Coast ath
letes competing, but there will be
an even greater incentive for top
performance. The Olympic tryouts
are coming up soon.
IN ADDITION TO the four con
ference colleges, independent teams j
may send representatives to this!
meet. The Los Angeles Athletic I
Club, loaded with former Trojan |
stars, will be favored to take the
relays.
