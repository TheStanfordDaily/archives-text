# Cards Host Santa Clara
## 
### 
Three teams changed places in
the CIBA standings last weekend
as both Stanford and Santa Clara
beat California, and USC two-timed
the hapless St. Mary's Gaels.
Santa Clara firmly established its
hold on third place by bringing the
Bronco season total to seven wins
and five losses. Stanford crept past
UCLA to go into fourth place with
four wins and five losses. The
Bruins were idle in league play and
now are in fifth with four wins and
six losses.
STANFORD WILL take on Santa
Clara today at 3:15 p.m. in the
Sunken Diamond in a game that
will be all-important in determin
ing Stanford's chances for climbing
any higher in the CIBA race. By
beating the Broncos, Harry Wo'ters'
men would jump within a half
game of third place and would be
only one game behind the slipping
second-place Bears.
Right now, Stanford is as hot as
any team in the league. The Cards
have defeated UCLA and Califor
nia for two straight and have looked
good in doing so. Pitchers Dave
Dahle and Frank Laßrum have
shown that they will be going full
blast in the stretch drive, and team
hitting is improving steadily.
THE SANTA CLARA series is
even up with a game apiece, so the
winner will take dual honors. Stan
ford won the first game 4 to 3 on
four hits on the Sunken Diamond,
but the Broncos came back to whip
the Cards 7 to 4 in a night game a 1
San Jose.
Card hurler Dave Stott was the
winning pitcher in the first game,
and Bronco Del Smith beat the
Cards in the second game. Stott
will probably get the starting call
again, but for the Broncos it will
probably be their ace, Hal Toso,
who gets the call. ,
