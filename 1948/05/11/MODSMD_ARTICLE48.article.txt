# Oaks, Seals Gain in PC Loop Race
## 
### BY CRAYTON JONES 
The Oaks and Seals fattened their
averages last week at the expense
ol cellar-dwellers, Portland and Sac
ramento. San Francisco increased
their league lead to two full games
over the Angels by virtue of their
6 to 1 series win over Portland while
the Oaks were copping 5 out of 7
from the Sacs.
The broken-down Beavers have
now dropped 17 out of their last
19 games and are buried deep in the
cellar—l 3 games off the pace.
MEANWHILE, Los Angeles won
their series from Hollywood but only
by the odd game, and the Seattle
Rainiers improved their position in
the standings with a 4 to 3 series
win over San Diego.
The same Seal pitchers who had
faltered during the earlier weeks of
the season came through with flying
colons last week as they held the
Beavers to an average of two runs
per game. Manny Perez and Cliff
Melton pitched shutouts; Perez was
a double winner as he pitched a
six-hitter to give the Seals and 11
to 2 win on Sunday.
WILL lIAFEY was the big hero
for the Oaks last week. The news of
his sale to Cleveland apparently in
spired him as Big Will hurled two
winning games. His pinch single on
Saturday with the bases loaded gave
the Acorns a 6 to 3 victory.
A mass juggling of manpower took
place last week. The biggest deal of
the week was the sale of Will Hafey,
Oakland pitcher, to the Cleveland
Indians for two players and an un
disclosed amount of cash.
THE TWO PLAYERS are George
Metkovich, outfielder who went up
to the majors from the Seals several
years ago, and Les Webber, who for
merly hurled for Seattle.
Hafey will report to the Indians
next year while Metkovich and Web
ber will repoVt to the Oaks immed
iately. Metkovich has a lame arm
which has been bothering him since
last year, but Stengel hopes that the
California sunshine will eliminate
the lameness.
OTHER DEALS involving Coast
League clubs:
Neill Sheridan, who went up to
the Red Sox from the Seals last
year, was optioned to Seattle after
having failed to break into the Bos
ton lineup. The acquisition of Sheri
dan should make the Suds a first
division club.
Sacramento traded Glenn "Rip"
Russell to the Hollywood Stars for
centerfielder A 1 White. It was a
straight trade—no cash being in
volved.
The Solons also announced that
they had signed Cotton Pippen, for
mer Oakland pitcher.
Don Carlsen, right-handed pitcher,
was sent to Los Angeles from the
Cubs. The Angels will no doubt get
additional help from the parent club
before the season is over.

THE TWO PLAYERS are George
Metkovich, outfielder who went up
to the majors from the Seals several
years ago, and Les Webber, who for
merly hurled for Seattle.
Hafey will report to the Indians
next year while Metkovich and Web
ber will repoVt to the Oaks immed
iately. Metkovich has a lame arm
which has been bothering him since
last year, but Stengel hopes that the
California sunshine will eliminate
the lameness.
OTHER DEALS involving Coast
League clubs:
Neill Sheridan, who went up to
the Red Sox from the Seals last
year, was optioned to Seattle after
having failed to break into the Bos
ton lineup. The acquisition of Sheri
dan should make the Suds a first
division club.
Sacramento traded Glenn "Rip"
Russell to the Hollywood Stars for
centerfielder A 1 White. It was a
straight trade—no cash being in
volved.
The Solons also announced that
they had signed Cotton Pippen, for
mer Oakland pitcher.
Don Carlsen, right-handed pitcher,
was sent to Los Angeles from the
Cubs. The Angels will no doubt get
additional help from the parent club
before the season is over.
The Oaks and Seals fattened their
averages last week at the expense
ol cellar-dwellers, Portland and Sac
ramento. San Francisco increased
their league lead to two full games
over the Angels by virtue of their
6 to 1 series win over Portland while
the Oaks were copping 5 out of 7
from the Sacs.
The broken-down Beavers have
now dropped 17 out of their last
19 games and are buried deep in the
cellar—l 3 games off the pace.
MEANWHILE, Los Angeles won
their series from Hollywood but only
by the odd game, and the Seattle
Rainiers improved their position in
the standings with a 4 to 3 series
win over San Diego.
The same Seal pitchers who had
faltered during the earlier weeks of
the season came through with flying
colons last week as they held the
Beavers to an average of two runs
per game. Manny Perez and Cliff
Melton pitched shutouts; Perez was
a double winner as he pitched a
six-hitter to give the Seals and 11
to 2 win on Sunday.
WILL lIAFEY was the big hero
for the Oaks last week. The news of
his sale to Cleveland apparently in
spired him as Big Will hurled two
winning games. His pinch single on
Saturday with the bases loaded gave
the Acorns a 6 to 3 victory.
A mass juggling of manpower took
place last week. The biggest deal of
the week was the sale of Will Hafey,
Oakland pitcher, to the Cleveland
Indians for two players and an un
disclosed amount of cash.
