The Big Meet is over and it isn't the purpose of this column
to do a rehash on it, but theere are some points that we feel
should be brought out.
The action of Skip Kent in slowing up just before the finish
of the 120 high hurdles to let Del Russell place third has been
told by now but we believe that it can stand a little retelling.
Kent won bis letter by getting a third place in the USC meet two
weeks ago. Russell didn't run that day. In order to win a varsity
track letter, a man must get one point in either the USC or California
meet. This he can do by winning a third place in any event.
Kent had a sure third place coming off the last hurdle. He looked
over his shoulder, saw Cal's Ted Rademaker behind Russell, and slowed
up to allow Russell the third place. We take off our hat to both lads.

LOOK FOR A RULE BARRING all varsity lettermen from intramural
sports next fall. This will extend to all lettermen, even in off seasons.
There is sound basis for such a policy. Several times in past years
athletes have incapacitated themselves just before an important game
or meet.

THERE WAS A FINE TURNOUT for the varsity scrimmage Saturday
and most observers left with one or two definite ideas about next year's
football team. A 1 Turriziani impressed with his jet-propelled starts on
the quick openers.
Emery Mitchell looked good for the short time he was in the ball
game. Both leading fullbacks suffered injuries. Mitchell got a bruised
foot for his efforts and Bud Klein a broken nose. It is unlikely that
either will see any more action in the six days left of spring practice.

BLOCK S PREXY MORLEY THOMPSON and his group deserve a lot
of credit for their barbecue for Block S alumni and Buck of the Month
Club members Saturday. It was a well-handled affair that did a lot to
further the efforts of the society and club. Many old and not-so-old
timers were on hand to renew friendships of years past. This idea of
getting the alumni together is a good one; one that can help the Stanford
athletic program in years to come.

FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE before the war Stanford will host the
Pacific Coast Southern Division swimming championship meet. The four
southern division schools will meet in the Encina Pool on May 22. Pre
liminary races will be held in the morning and the finals in the afternoon.
Stanford has won the championships for the past two years. Last
year the Cards had one of the best swim teams in the country. Off
the NCAA meet results last March they rank fifth this season. Mentor
Haynie's crew has not been beaten in a dual meet since late in 1943, win
ning 32 straight meets.

THE RAINS OF TWO WEEKS AGO were the cause of moving the
UCLA track meet but they Helped the Stanford Golf Course- The course
had undergone extensive improvements for the NCAA golf championships
that are slated for June 28. Up to three or four weeks ago the powers
that be were ready to reschedule the site of play for fear that the Farm
course would not be ready. Everything is set now.
