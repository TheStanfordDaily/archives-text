narrow 8 to 5 win over the Won
ders. Denny Carlson and George
Liddle both blasted circuit clouts in
the tight contest. Village 312 blanked

serious trouble as they coasted to
the victory.
The Chi Psis squeaked by a de
termined Phi Sig squad, 4 to 3, for
a well earned win. Firehouse con

Delta Tau Delta, 4 to 0. "Green
