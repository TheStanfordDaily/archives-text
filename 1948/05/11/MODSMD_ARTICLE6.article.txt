# Code Poll To Be Taken Tomorrow
## 
### 
Do you think the Honor Code
'is working successfully? Have !
! you noticed any violations in
the last two quarters? Do you
; consider cheating in short
! quizzes as serious as cheating in
| midquarters and finals?
These are only a few of the ques- !
I tions which a groupr of students will j
be asked to answer tomorrow, when
they receive a questionnaire from j
the Honor Code Standing Commit- |
tee. Their opinions will form the |
basis for a statistically accurate |
1 survey representing the opinions of I
j the entire student body on the j
{ workings of the Code.
THE SURVEY WILL serve as a
guide by which the Honor Code [
| Committee will tailor the Code to !
the student body. Men's Council
I will also use the survey as a guide
in dealing with Code cases.
"The Honor Code has a job to do J
j —the job the students want it to j
i do!" said Hawley Smith, committee |
i chairman. "Vague mumblings about
! the workings of the Code are gen- ;
I erally made by minorities, but just ]
I the same we want to know how
everyone feels, and how everyone
| wants us to work.
"VIOLATORS ARE FEW, espe- ,
cially considering the University's
large enrollment. Those who cheat
either willfully or through neglect
| are not the type of people we want
to associate with at Stanford. They
, hurt the honest people by taking |
| short cuts around work, and obvi
' ously they hurt themselves, for few |
here in school think it sporty to I
! violate the Honor Code.
"We are still proud of the fact that
j a professor can leave the classroom !
during an exam. And like even bet
ter the fact that we can take exam's
outside of tire classroom.
"It took a long, hard fight and ;
thousands of student signatures to
get our Honor System through. It's
one of the biggest things Stanford j
has . . . one of the first things
I alumni brag about. . '
"Let's hang on to it and make it
work!"
