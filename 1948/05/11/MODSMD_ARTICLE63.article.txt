### 
SAN FRANCISCO. May 10 (UP) â€”
Scrappy Little Dado Marino o:
Honolulu, the world's No. 2 fly
weight, won his fourth straight vic
tory or a mainland invasion tonight
by knocking out Kenny Lindsay,
Vancouver, B. C., in 42 seconds of
the first round.
Marino raced out of his corner
with the opening bell, smashing
Lindsay with a lightning flurry of
left hooks 1 to the head. The Can
adian crumpled to the canvas after
Marino landed less than a dozen
punches.
