# Road to Rio Bids Are Going Fast
## 
### 
Tickets are going fast for the
"Road to Rio" beach picnic held for
juniors, seniors, and their dates. The
outing will be Saturday from 1 to
8 p.m. The time is set so that stu
dents can get back to the campus
for other evening activities.
The committee is stressing the
fact that not only fellows and their
dates are eligible for the picnic but
also that women should ask other
guests. All tickets can be secured
at the ASSU office for $1.80.
