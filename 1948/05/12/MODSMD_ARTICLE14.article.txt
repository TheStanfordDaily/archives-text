# French Urge Palestine Plan
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. May 11 (UP)—
The United States and France made
! a joint llth-hour move tonight to
put some United Nations authority
into Palestine after May 15 by in
troducing a new plan for a trus
| teeship over Jerusalem.
It was the first time since Ameri
! can abandonment of partition that
the United States has received such
| support for any of its long series of
proposals for dealing with the Pal
estine dilemma. Last month, the
United States alone introduced a
similar proposal, but it failed to whip
! up any enthusiasm.
THERE APPEARED little chance
that the United States and France
could push through the new proposal
in the less than three days left be
fore the British mandate ends and
the Jews proclaim their state.
Some UN observers interpreted the
new French-American move as a
desperate attempt to place some UN
authority in Palestine after Friday
I so the UN would not let whatever
authority it has go by default.
IT WAS GENERALLY agreed that
if the UN failed to put at least a
toe in the Holy Land by May 15, it
might let slip whatever chance it
might eventually have to work out
a UN solution for the whole Pales
tine problem.
