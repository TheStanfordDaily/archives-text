### 
SEOUL, Korea, Tuesday, May 11
(UP) —More than 7,500,000 Koreans |
defied communist terrorism to cast j
ballots in yesterday's elections, it
was estimated today.
A national election board spokes
man said late returns indicated that ;
95 per cent of South Korea's eligi- j
ble voters participated in Korea's
first democratic elections despite
the eruption of communist violence
which caused 101 deaths since Fri- ;
day night.

See History, 1948, on page 4 for
a discussion of the situation in
Korea.

Both American occupation author- j
ities and United Nations officials— j
under whose auspices the elections !
in Southern Korea were held—ex
pressed satisfaction at the remark -
able turnout. One UN delegate, |
Yusin Mughir of Syria, who opposed
the separate balloting, said the elec- j
tions were a "success." Mughir
toured polling places in Seoul and
described voting as "very smooth and |
well organized. - '
Refusal of the South Koreans to j
be intimidated by the Communist
wave of terrorism and sabotage
brought quick reaction from Soviet
occupied northern zones—a threat
to cut oft' the supply of electric !
power.
A spokesman for the communist- '
dominated North Korean People's |
Committee, in a broadcast over the
Pyongyang radio, said that unless
South Korean representatives au- !
thorized to settle the issue of pay- j
ment for electric power was sent j
to the red capital by May 14 the sup
ply would be cut.
