Tonight Excom will attempt to clarify the issue of campaign
expenditures through a proposed amendment to the by-laws of
the ASSU constitution. The amendment is not necessarily the
final word, for there are points in the amendment with which
Election Board disagrees.
It is, however, a prompt attempt to rectify the vagueness of
the constitution on the election issue — the vagueness which
hampered a definite decision by Excom on an election charge
two weeks ago.
The major additions and changes are, in substance, the fol
lowing:
1. A candidate's expense account must include all campaign
equipment and materials and all assistance in publicity at the
iair comercial cost, except personal services of Stanford stu
dents and members of the candidate's family and the use of
private automobiles.
2. Any candidate in doubt as to the meaning of the election
rules must apply to Election Board in writing for an interpretation.
If Election Board cannot provide a written interpretation, or if
the candidate is not satisfied with their interpretation, the candi
date must apply to the ASSU president or Excom for an inter
pretation. A candidate who fails to do this will be liable to
punishment if his activities are in violation thereof.
3. If it appears that an election violation was willful and delib
erate, the candidate, whether or not he has won the election,
and all persons knowingly and deliberately assisting him shall
be subject to prosecution before the Council for Student Control
for violation of the Fundamental Standard. Even if the violation
cannot be proved willful and deliberate and the candidate does
not win the election, he shall still be liable for punishment by
ihe same council and subject to disqualification as a candidate
in future elections.
4. If any student causes goods or services to be expended in
campaigning for a candidate without the candidate s knowledge
and consent, the student will be liable to prosecution.
This summary does not cover every point; most clauses of
the present by-laws concerning elections are included in the
proposed amendment. Now that a definite proposal has been
laid before it, Excom should take swift and intelligent action
on the election issue. —P. N.
