The May 10 editorial onour crew was very encouraging. The team
The May 10 editorial on our crew was very encouraging. The team
determination is half the "battle."
But in reference to the Stanford-Cal regatta last Saturday, there are
a few words to be said. That Stanford crew w«.s the same one that
won a clean sweep over the entire Southern Division of the Pacific
Coast Crew Conference almost tying the Ballona course record made
by Cal in 1943. When they entered the regatta last Saturday, they
knew that their competition was not only one of the greatest teams
in the United States, but of the entire world. So there isn't a feeling
among the crew that they have "lost," but rather that the yet unfinished
season has so far been successful, thanks to our inspiring coach, A. A.
Clark.
The gang at the boathouse isn't planning on making your analogy
with last fall's football team of eight straight losses hold true. In fact,
those interested in witnessing the Stanford-USC regatta next Saturday
at 2 a.m. at the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor, will also have the chance
of seeing a fighting crew possibly break the course record.
