To the Student Body:
This year's Convalescent Home Drive was one of the most successful
ever. The reason for this success was not the efforts of any individual
or any group of individuals, but was because of the sincere participation
of the entire student body. The primary function of the drive is to
"make friends" for the home, so that you as alumni will always remem
ber it.
The secondary function is to raise the $7,000 which the ASSU pledges
annually to the home. Both of these functions have been accomplished
this year. I wish to thank the student body of Stanford for their efforts
and time which went toward making this a truly successful Convalescent
Home Week.
