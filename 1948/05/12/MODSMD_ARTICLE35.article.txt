of kings without kingdoms.
Albania stands first in the World War II bracket
of royal casualties. King Zog was forced to flee
his little kingdom in April, 1939, after its invasion
by Fascist Italy. He never returned, for Albania
was proclaimed a Soviet-orientated' "people's re
public" not many months after V-E Day.
Youthful King Peter II of Yugoslavia left his
country at the time of the German invasion in 1941
and likewise was unable to resume his throne.

1945.
Bulgaria's boy king, Simeon 11, who had reigned
through a regency after the death of his father,
King Boris 111, lost his throne in 1!)46, with the

loanna, went into exile in Egypt with her father,
former King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.
Victor Emmanuel, little more than a royal symbol
under Mussolini, abdicated in 1946 and died in
Alexandria, Egypt, last December. His eldest son
became King Umberto II of Italy in 1946, but reigned
only 36 days. By referendum the voters chose a re
public and Umberto departed for Portugal as another
royal exile.
In 1946 Hungary proclaimed itself a republic.
Before the war it had been a kingdom with a
vacant throne, under the rule of a regent.
