## History 1948 Will the Shooting Start in Korea? 
### 
When May Day closed in North Korea there was
no Maypole. Instead, crossed hammers and sickles
were embroidered upon the new flag waving over
the new "Democratic People's Republic" of Korea.
North Korea, energized by constitution-making, was
perparing to scotch the coming elections in the south,
scheduled for May 9.
The new constitution claimed jurisdiction over all
Korea, including the American occupation zone. It
provided for election of an assembly, which in turn
would choose a 15-man Presidium to govern the
country. What a tongue-tied UN Little Assembly
thought about all this, North Koreans didn't care.
Two months ago a political refugee from the North
claimed that people's committees had already been
alerted to "stand-by." About all the Americans could
do in the south was to flee the provinces and get
out of gun-shot. Almost everyone thought the shoot
ing was coming—and soon.
Korea, both north and south, was reported sick
of occupation. But the Soviets had offered more,
had as usual been closer to the needs of a 75 per
cent agricultural people. Absentee landlords were
banned. The' new constitution promised national
ization of all mines, forests, utilities, and other large
enterprises.
Most important to Koreans is the ban on absentee
landlordship, long chronic in Korea. Feudal land
holdings was one reason for the growth of the Com
munist Party since 1924. Another was that the com
munists, working underground during 40 years of
Jap ocupation, were the one organized force oppos
ing the invaders. The Soviets claimed 725,000 landless
peasants were given 1,000.000 hectares of free land
formerly belonging to the Japs.
Under the monarchial aristocracy of the Yangban—
before 1905 —the peasants were left landless and im
poverished. The insatiable Yangbah took Korea's
economy by connivance. One author says, "history
takes the Yangban for granted just as the shipbuilder
takes barnacles for granted, but the difference is that
the barnacles get. scraped ofl periodically, but the
Yangban, never."
Then came the Japanese, in full control by 1910,
who unlike the Yangban were scraped off—in 1945.
The establishment of a "Democratic People's Re
public on Feb. 16; but the May Day constitution
goes a step further. Riots in Japan last week by
Koreans and active hostility against Americans in
South Korea, have teen stepped up. Lt. Gen. John
R. Hodge, U.S. commander in Korea, has ordered
armed guards to accompany all American vehicles.
At the same time he has notified the Russians that
there 11 be no negotiating with the new republic.
With a "democratically elected" assembly soon to
gather in the north, the Soviets can wash their hands
oi any responsibility for North Korean monkey
shines in the south—by official recognition of the
"people's government." This will be sanctioned by
indifference—and will encourage infiltration and riots
in the south. Meanwhile, a highly-trained and Sov
ietized North Korean People's Army, numbering at
least 100.000 and maybe 200.000 men, face a pitiful
American force across the 38th parallel.
General Hodge had better look to his guns.
