# SAE Lion Now Has Twin Cubs
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The long-expected offspring have
arrived. In announcements distrib
uted yesterday to all the campus
living groups, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
proudly announced the birth of
twins. Phi (he) and Alpha (she).
The babies, a pair of little lion cubs
made of painted white rock, are be
ing guarded closely by their mother
on the front lawn of the SAE house.
It was rumored that the delivery
was attended by three pre-meds of
the house sometime during the early
morning following Mothers' Day
and the cubs were allowed to lie
in the bright sunshine for the first
time yesterday morning.
AS MANY CAMPUS eyes exam
ined the cubs, the proud mother re
sponded with threatening roars
thanks to the ingenuity of SAE "en
gineers." This is the first birth for
the big lioness, whose name is un
known to all but fraternity actives.
She has had a rough year, though.
Baths of new white paint have been
applied no less than 14 times this
year by her 41 masters. Then last
week she was in heat when some
one struck a match to a gas-soaked
piece of muslin which was spread
across the lioness' back.
UNTIL 1 iKJ2 the famed animal
had few occasions to emit its re
sounding growl. But in that year a
visiting school teachers' convention
was held on the campus and the re
sults were appalling. During the
war the lion growled quite consis
tent!}', but during the post-war era
when veterans returned, the old
SAE sentinel has been hushed.
It must be an act of fate that has
brought the lion cubs to the Row
and with them the return of the
growl.
