# Bookstore 50 Years Old; Designed to Serve Needs
## 
### 
By JANE McKEE
The Stanford Bookstore is or
ganized as a co-operative venture
and is designed to serve the needs
of the Stanford faculty and stu
dents. It was first organized about
50 years ago by a group of students,
but when they ran into debt the
University took over.
It is now operated as a corpora
tion system. Profits are returned to
the student body through the schol
arship fund, the loan fund, and the
student aid fund, as well as directly
in the form of rebates. The five
man board of directors meets once
a year to make its report and elect
new members.
Members of the board include
Prof. D. E. Faville, Prof. Chilton E.
Bush, Prof. J. Hugh Jackson, Prof.
George S. Parks, and Prof. H. H.
Jackson.
The Bookstore is under the year
round management of Mrs. Helena
T. Bauchou. Mrs. Bauchou said
that she welcomes constructive crit
icism of anything concerning the
Bookstore, since it exists for the
benefit of those on the Stanford
campus.
COMPLAINTS HAVE been made
that the Bookstore charges as much,
or more, for its stationery and other
supplies as do the stores in Palo
Alto. This is explained by two rea
sons:
First, the Bookstore belongs to the
College Bookstore Association and,
along with the other colleges and
universities which are members, it
♦s entitled to buy special mill ship

i ments of better-grade paper that
! is made up to pass high quality :
i tests. Outside shoppers have com
: pared the Bookstore's paper and file
j cards, for example, and found the i
| quality and a'so the quantity to be
above that of supplies purchased
| downtown.
Second, certain articles such as
pens and typewriters sell for no
I lower prices at the Bookstore be
! cause they have to be priced in ac
j cordance with the California Fair
! Trades Act.
REBATE SLIPS THIS YEAR are
j due by May 15. The tickets are
; added, checked, and paid by check
! June 1. (The added rebate on June
purchases is made in early fall.) j
1 The monetary amount of tickets
i turned in and the profit made do- j
j termine the percentage of rebate, j
I Returns in past years have varied '
; from nothing during depressions to !
125 per cent, but the percentage is
impossible to compute until the 1
tickets are turned in.
There are no rebates on veter
ans' purchases since the government i
claims the discount at the time of \
purchase.

The Bookstore is under the year
round management of Mrs. Helena
T. Bauchou. Mrs. Bauchou said
that she welcomes constructive crit
icism of anything concerning the
Bookstore, since it exists for the
benefit of those on the Stanford
campus.
COMPLAINTS HAVE been made
that the Bookstore charges as much,
or more, for its stationery and other
supplies as do the stores in Palo
Alto. This is explained by two rea
sons:
First, the Bookstore belongs to the
College Bookstore Association and,
along with the other colleges and
universities which are members, it
♦s entitled to buy special mill ship

i ments of better-grade paper that
! is made up to pass high quality :
i tests. Outside shoppers have com
: pared the Bookstore's paper and file
j cards, for example, and found the i
| quality and a'so the quantity to be
above that of supplies purchased
| downtown.
Second, certain articles such as
pens and typewriters sell for no
I lower prices at the Bookstore be
! cause they have to be priced in ac
j cordance with the California Fair
! Trades Act.
REBATE SLIPS THIS YEAR are
j due by May 15. The tickets are
; added, checked, and paid by check
! June 1. (The added rebate on June
purchases is made in early fall.) j
1 The monetary amount of tickets
i turned in and the profit made do- j
j termine the percentage of rebate, j
I Returns in past years have varied '
; from nothing during depressions to !
125 per cent, but the percentage is
impossible to compute until the 1
tickets are turned in.
There are no rebates on veter
ans' purchases since the government i
claims the discount at the time of \
purchase.

The Stanford Bookstore is or
ganized as a co-operative venture
and is designed to serve the needs
of the Stanford faculty and stu
dents. It was first organized about
50 years ago by a group of students,
but when they ran into debt the
University took over.
It is now operated as a corpora
tion system. Profits are returned to
the student body through the schol
arship fund, the loan fund, and the
student aid fund, as well as directly
in the form of rebates. The five
man board of directors meets once
a year to make its report and elect
new members.
