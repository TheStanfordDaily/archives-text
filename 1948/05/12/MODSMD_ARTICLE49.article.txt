# Varsity Crewmen Race USC Saturday Morning
## 
### BY BILL BETHKE 
The eager oarsmen of USC will
race the Card crew Saturday morn
ing on the Bay in the third race
of the season for 'he Farm men.
With a 1-1 victor record behind them
the varsity eight will face the Tro
;an varsity, an outfit that the Stan
ford jayvees defeated in the UCLA
regatta.
AFTER LOSING to Cal in a rec
ord-breaking race last Saturday,
Coach A. A. Clark's men returned
to work yesterday morning with
their sights on better balance, more
glide, better starts, and more
smoothly applied power. These are
the factors which were the margin
of difference Saturday and which
must be improved upon to make
Stanford a major threat in the Port
land Rose Festival regatta on June
11.
In place of a frosh and jayvee pre-
Jiminary race Saturday, Coach Clark
shuffled his freshman and jayvee
oarsmen and came up with a pair
of "pickle" boats made up of half
frosh and half jayvees each. These
eights wil practice all week on work
ing together.
AN EFFORT has been made to ar
range the course of the 2.000-meter
/ace so that spectators may watch
the races Saturday. Boats from the

Palo Alto Yacht Club will be able
to carry some fans and a ferry-boat
j system may be employed to carry
! some fans to the finish line. Full
j details will be given by Coach Clark
| Friday. This race will the the crew's
i only appearance at home this spring.
IN USC, the Farm varsity will
' face a fledgling organization that
has improved a great deal in the
last two years. Given the use of
i UCLA's equipment several seasons
j ago, the Trojans have developed a
! small but spirited crew that beat
; their Bruin foster-fathers in a re
gatta on May 1.
Racing their varsity against the
jayvee crews of Stanford and UCLA
! and San Diego State's varsity, the
USC men came in third behind San
Diego, while Stanford won. The
Trojans were two lengths in the
{ rear.

The Japanese Davis Cup team de
feated the Stanford tennis team, 3
to 0, on the Farm court in May, 1937.
