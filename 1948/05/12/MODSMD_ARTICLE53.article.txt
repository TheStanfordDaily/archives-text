# Stanford Slips— Broncs Win 4 to 1
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Stanford kissed its last hopes for CIBA honors goodbye yes
terday afternoon as the Cards dropped a 4 to 1 decision to Santa
Clara on the Sunken Diamond. Stanford trailed all the way and
made only two feeble attempts at tying up the game.
Bronco Doug Smith handcuffed the Indians with seven scattered

► hits, and kept things completely un
der control while going the distance.
Stanford's Dave Stott also went the
entire nine innings, but a shaky
first inning was his downfall.
STOTT GAVE up three runs in
the first and one run in the sev
enth, as Santa Clara raked out 12
big blows. Santa Clara used the win
to hike itself into a second-place
tie with California in the loop stand
ings. Meanwhile, the Cards dropped
back to a fourth place tie with
UCLA.
Not looking like the ball club
I that had beaten UCLA and Cali
fornia in consecutive games, the
Cards couldn't get going long enough
to add any tallies. They scored their
single run in the fourth when Char
lie Cole led off with a double down
the right field line. Frank MacGraw
followed with a hard single that
scored Cole, but the side went out
in order after that.
THE ONLY OTIIEK TIME Stan
| ford threatened seriously was in the
j eighth when with one out, George
; Sloat pounded out a long double,
but he died on second.
Santa Clara bunched three hits in
the first to score their first three
runs, and then settled back to watch
what would happen. The Broncos
| didn't have to watch too closely.
Their pitcher, Doug Smith, was giv
ing them a nice ride right into sec
ond place in the standings.
LEADING HITTER for the Cards
was Dave Melton, who picked up a
! single and double in four trips to
; the plate. Charlie Cole hit safely
for the seventh CIBA game in a
row, but other than that the In
dians had little to shout about. Santa
Clara's Bill Prentice hit four fox
four.
Friday night Stanford will have to
invade Los Angeles for a two-game
series with the league-leading USC
Trojans, and although the locals still
have a chance to overtake at least
California in the loop race, they are
! a bit dejected about blowing the
Santa Clara series.

Stanford kissed its last hopes for CIBA honors goodbye yes
terday afternoon as the Cards dropped a 4 to 1 decision to Santa
Clara on the Sunken Diamond. Stanford trailed all the way and
made only two feeble attempts at tying up the game.
Bronco Doug Smith handcuffed the Indians with seven scattered

► hits, and kept things completely un
der control while going the distance.
Stanford's Dave Stott also went the
entire nine innings, but a shaky
first inning was his downfall.
STOTT GAVE up three runs in
the first and one run in the sev
enth, as Santa Clara raked out 12
big blows. Santa Clara used the win
to hike itself into a second-place
tie with California in the loop stand
ings. Meanwhile, the Cards dropped
back to a fourth place tie with
UCLA.
Not looking like the ball club
I that had beaten UCLA and Cali
fornia in consecutive games, the
Cards couldn't get going long enough
to add any tallies. They scored their
single run in the fourth when Char
lie Cole led off with a double down
the right field line. Frank MacGraw
followed with a hard single that
scored Cole, but the side went out
in order after that.
THE ONLY OTIIEK TIME Stan
| ford threatened seriously was in the
j eighth when with one out, George
; Sloat pounded out a long double,
but he died on second.
Santa Clara bunched three hits in
the first to score their first three
runs, and then settled back to watch
what would happen. The Broncos
| didn't have to watch too closely.
Their pitcher, Doug Smith, was giv
ing them a nice ride right into sec
ond place in the standings.
LEADING HITTER for the Cards
was Dave Melton, who picked up a
! single and double in four trips to
; the plate. Charlie Cole hit safely
for the seventh CIBA game in a
row, but other than that the In
dians had little to shout about. Santa
Clara's Bill Prentice hit four fox
four.
Friday night Stanford will have to
invade Los Angeles for a two-game
series with the league-leading USC
Trojans, and although the locals still
have a chance to overtake at least
California in the loop race, they are
! a bit dejected about blowing the
Santa Clara series.
