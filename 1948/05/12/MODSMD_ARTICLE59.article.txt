# Fresno Relays Wili Feature Top Talent
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
A new event has been added to
the Fresno Relays—the fro.sh mile
relay. Stanford's frush mile relay
team is undefeated this season, but
will receive a stiff test at Fresno.
Against the Cal trosh last Sat
urday, the yearlings rolled through
to a 3:22, and with a little more prac
tice could bring it down a few sec
onds. There aren't many compara
tive times available, but the South
ern Cal frosh are supposed to be
pretty fast. •
The frosh relay team that whip
ped Cal by about 30 yards was com
posed of Jess Scroggy, Hicks Wil
liams, Chuck Trask, and Cass Bly.
However, the frosh are still prac
ticing new winning combinations,
so the members of the team are not
definitely set.
The varsity mile relay tsam
should fare well too. The squad
looked great against the Bears last
weekend (Wilkins, Grimes, John
son, and Hoff), Of course, the boys
won't be running their regular
events before the grueling relay,
and therefore may have a little
more strength at the end of the

race. Some of the men may double
up and run in medley relays.
It is USC again that will give our
varsity mile relay plenty of trouble,
j They have been credited with 3:18,
j a second faster than the Indians'
! best time.
The two-mile relay is an espe
cially long and hard race. The Cards
' will enter George Grimes, A! Holu
bar, Ted Off, and the fourth man
could be either Larry Hoff or A 1
Lyons. Both Larry and A 1 have
recently run under two flat in the
half-mile, and are thus a good ad
dition to the team.
Cal seems strong in this event
with Dick Cotton, Don Jackson.
John Anderson, and Phil Arnot (if
he gets in shape). Bob Chambers,
Troy's star half-miler, will probably
! be saved for the medley.
There are three new events this
year—the 5,000-meter run, the 400-
meter hurdles, and the hop, step
■ and jump. Jose Rael, Cards' ace
distance man, will be unable to
compete in the long race (5.000 me
ters is a little more than three
miles).
