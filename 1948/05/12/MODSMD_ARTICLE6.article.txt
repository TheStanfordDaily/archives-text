# U.S. Is Trump In Far East
## 
### 
Whatever the future holds for na
tions of the Far East will depend
to a large degree on the wisdom
with which the United States ana
lyzes their problems and applies the
answers to these analyses, Dr.
Claude A. Buss, Stanford history
professor, told his Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night.
Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium, the former foreign service of
ficer presented a discussion on
"American Policies in the Far East,"'
which covered current problems
facing the United States in China,
Southeastern Asia, Korea, and Ja
pan.
ALIW O S T EVERYWHERE in
eastern Asia, he said, it is a ques
tion of power politics between the
United States and Russia.
America is reluctant to withdraw j
military forces from Korea espe- |
cially for fear that the vacuum thus I
created would be immediately filled j
by Russian troops. Others contend |
that Communist penetration there is I
already considerable and that a de- j
cision to keep troops in Korea would j
result in serious bad feeling toward I
this country.
CHINA POSES an even more se
rious problem. Dr. Buss declared,
asserting that it would be a mistake
to wholeheartedly rush military aid
to the Kuomintang before consider
ing the consequences of such an act.
"If something should happen to
the armies of Chiang Kai-shek, we
must face the wrath of the new gov
ernment and risk the loss of our
position in China.
''MILITARY AID has not proved 1
too effective in Kuomintang efforts j
to stop the advance of the Commu
nists. Before military supplies they
need to co-ordinate their ground j
and air forces, train more officers, j
change their offensive tactics, and
enlist the aid of U.S. officers—only j
then will military supplies be of j
much use."
Chief problems in Japan, Dr. Buss
said, are those involving economic
aid and the extent to which we
should a. ow her to re-develop her I
industries. Others disagree as to ;
how long we should maintain mili- 1
tarv government there.
