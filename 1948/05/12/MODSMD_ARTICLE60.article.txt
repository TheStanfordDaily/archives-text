## 51 Mermen To Meet Cubs 
### 
Stanford's undefeated Papoose
swimmers travel to Berkeley Sat
urday to lace the Cal frosh team
for the second time this season. The
meet starts at 10 a.m., and will be
the last one of the year for the
frosh.
The powerful paddlers from the
Farm have met eight opponents and
have rolled up impressive victories
over all. In their last dual meet
with Cal two weeks ago, Stanford
won easily, 58-17.
John Mowat will lead the Indian
swimmers in their bid for a perfect
season. Undefeated in the 220-yard
and 440-yard distances, Mowat often
doubles up to help the team out in
the sprints and in the relays. He
consistently swims the 220 in less
than 2:20, and is a big threat to
break a long-standing freshman rec
ord. During the past week he swam
the distance in 2:1t).4, only .7 sec
ond off the record of 2:15.7
Another threatened record is the
300-yard medley relay time of 3:11.
The Cardettes' rapid relay team is
composed of the terrific trio of Don
Weeden, backstroke; Marsh Pearl
man, breaststroke; and Hub Stokely.
