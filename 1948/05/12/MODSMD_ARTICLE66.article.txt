# Worm Turns; Coeds Shiver
## 
### BY ROWLAND REBELE 
It seems that the worm has turned ;
—as it most always does—and this
time left in its sweep a swarm of
shivering seniors. Here's the story:
Last Monday evening the sopho
more and junior members of Cub
berley House had no dinner.
THAT AFTERNOON thei senior i
i "sisters" had hot-footed it out to
Adobe Creek with the house hashers,
locking tight the house, instructed
their cooks to "show up late."
To the younger members who
later broke in and exhausted them
selves in a fruitless search for food,
it was a simple case of premedi
tated malice; they intended to do
something about it.
And they did. In less time than
it takes to unleash a snarling group
of hungry girls, the angry coeds ran
] upstairs, ripped apart the neatly
I made seniors' beds, and hustled the
j blankets over to the Sigma Chi
! House.
SOME TIME AGO the Sigma Chi '
pledges swiped some blankets from
I their brothers' beds and deposited
J them on the Cubberley front door
i step. Following this, the Cubfcer
i leyites sold them to the Dekes and
now, it would seem, were seized
with a passion to warm their bene- I
factors, seniors or no.
■ Knowing a good joke when they
saw one and not hesitating for a
moment to "avenge a former wrong,"
the Sigs did not hesitate over gra
j ciously acepting the proferred booty.
I For safe keeping, house brothers ran
j the blankets upstairs and strung
them out sleeping porch windows. ,
MONDAY EVENING, the seniors
[ of Cubberley House froze. When this
article was being written last night.
I there was a good chance that they
! would freeze again.
But the girls had not frozen with
out putting up a fight. Last evening
j at 7:30 they aranged a sit-down
| strike in front of the adversaries'
house, and even managed to get in
the house and to the first floor land
j ing before they were halted with
manly cries of "Halt, you are in-
J vading our boudoir," and "it's im
j moral."
THE GIRLS HAD planned to make
j a rush on the "boudoirs" and, re
; leasing the captive blankets, drop
j them to confederates waiting below,
j And though they failed, one of the
I female invaders was most compli-
I mentary. She said:
"We were most well treated: they
. gave us cokes, food, and reading ma
! terial—but not blankets."
j It remains to be seen whether the
: shivering girls will recapture their
[ bedclothes. Their younger sisters,
warm as toast, seem to feel that they ,
brought it on themselves, and the
j Sigma Chis have already begun sell
| ing captive blankets to the Dekes. !
