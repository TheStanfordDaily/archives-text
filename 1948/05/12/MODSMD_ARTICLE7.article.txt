# U.S. Still Willing To Talk to Soviet
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP) â€”The State Department today
confirmed that it has told Russia the door is still open to discus
sion of differences between the two great powers. But diplo
matic sources said the U. S. has not proposed any specific talki
as alleged by the Moscow radio.
Government sources said the Russians were misinterpertinc

"completely the meaning of a state
ment U. S. Ambassador W. Bedel
Smith made to Soviet Foreign Minis
ter V. M. Molotov on May 4.
MOLOTOV SEIZED on a single
sentence in the long statement as
an American proposal to negotiate a
settlement of the "cold war." He
announced via Radio Moscow tha
Russia accepted the American "ot
fer."
The sentence said: "As far as th
United States is concerned, the do.
is always wide open for full dis
cussion and the composing of ov
differences."
BUT THE BULK OF Smith's r.
marks added up to a vigorous cor
demnation of Russia's internation
conduct and a plain warning to th
Soviets not to misunderstand th
peaceful but firm foreign policy o
the United States.
Smith had made two main poinU
in his talk with Molotov:
1. That the United States has made
international policies "amply clear"
in recent months. These policies
are supported by the American peo
ple, and will be "vigorously anc
firmly prosecuted."
2. "On the other hand, this gov
ernment wishes to make it unrais
takeably clear that the Unite
States has no hostile or aggressiv
designs whatsoever with respect t
the Soviet Union."
MOLOTOV ANSWERED Smith
memorandum on May 9. He starter
by agreeing to what he called tin
American conference proposal anc
then launched into a sharp attack
! on U. S. policy, which he blamed
solely for the existing international
[ friction.
The Soviet foreign minister also
served notice that Russia intended
to continue her policy of "consoli
dating its relations with neighbor
ing and other countries of Europe."
