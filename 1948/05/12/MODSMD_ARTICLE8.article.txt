# Solons Pass Draft Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 11 (UP) â€”
The Senate Aimed Services Com
mittee today approved a draft bill
that would remain law for up to
five years and authorize induction
of about 351,000 men 18 through 25
during the first year.
It contained several surprises, in
cluding a provision allowing 18-
year-old youths to volunteer for one
year of training, and thus take out
insurance against being drafted for
a longer term when they are older.
YOUTHS OF 18 who did not vol
unteer would be liable to compul
sory calling up for one-year's serv
ice, within the United States, un
der a modified version of universal
military training. While the act sets
no ceiling on the number of these
"umtees" to be drafted or recruited
voluntarily, armed services spokes
men said budget limits will keep the
number down to about 161,000 dur
ing the first year.
Men 19 through 25 would be eli
gible for a straight draft which
would place them in the regular
services for two years. Again, no
ceilings are in the bill, but defense
officials said about 190,000 draftees
would be needed during the next 12
months to bring the army up to its
authorized strength.
THE SENATE MEASURE calls for
registration of "every male person"
18 through 25. But aliens, most vet
erans, high school students, minis
ters, and essential industry work
ers, farm labor and scientists would
be exempted.
Approval came after a sharp fight
over racial segregation. Four
Southern senators tried to write in a
last-minute clause giving every in
ductee the right to demand that he
serve only with members of his own
race.
It was voted down after the com
mittee held a hurried closed door
conference with Defense Secretary
James Forrestal and Army Secretary
Kenneth C. Royall.
