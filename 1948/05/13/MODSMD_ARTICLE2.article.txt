LONDON. May 12 (UP).—For
eign Secretary Ernest Bevin turned
thumbs down today on any further
peace talks with Russia until pres
ent issues are settled.
'"I want to be quite frank," Bevin
told Commons. '"I am not anxious
to enter into further conferences
until the ground has been cleared.
I have had too many failures."
Bevin said that only the Commu
nists stand in the way of peace. "The
evidence all goes to show that the
peoples of the world want peace,"
he said. "If the peoples are allowed
to meet they could have peace. It
is only the Communists who stand
in the way."
Bevin said he thought it was "ab
solutely essential that a good deal
of preparatory work has got to be
done and what I call putting cards
on the table face upwards has got
to take place. Then we have got a
chance of making a conference for
peace really successful."
