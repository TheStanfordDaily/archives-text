# Rothwell Hits U.S. Criticism Of Diplomats
## 
### 
Dr. Eastern Rothwell, vice-chair
man of the Hoover Institute and Li
brary. and former secretary-general
of the U. S. delegation to the United
Nations stated yesterday at a PTA
convention in Sacramento that the
people of the United States have a
"negative influence" on their leaders
in international diplomacy.
The power of the Soviet Union and
its actions on the international scene,
Rothwell said, have resulted in the
fact that we now live in "two worlds
separated by a deep gulf between
our views and the Soviet view."
Rothwell praised the 1048-49 plat
form for the PTA Congress which
the delegates will vote on Friday.
