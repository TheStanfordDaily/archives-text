WASHINGTON. May 12 (UP)
The Alabama plan to withhold elec- j
toral votes from President Truman j
could boomerang.
Democratic National Chairman J.
Howard McGrath said today the
states which adopt it might lose some
of their strength in future Demo
cratic National Conventions.
"Under the present system of al- j
lotting delegates to the national con
vention," McGrath added in an in- J
terview, "the Southern proposal '
could boomerang.
"It wouldn't aft'ect their delega- j
tions to the 1948 convention because
those already have been set."
