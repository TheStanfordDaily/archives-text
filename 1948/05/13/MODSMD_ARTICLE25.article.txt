# Arnold Describes Life In London University
## 
### BY DOLLY LISSE 
"It's good to be back." This was :
the feeling of Newt Arnold '47 who
recently returned from a year in
Europe on an inter-fraternity schol
arship.
Arnold, well known to Stanford
students for his work with the Stan
ford Players, spent the past year
studying at University College of
the University of London. During
the summer he was on a scholarship
to the Banff School of Art.
Arnold majored in speech and j
drama while at Stanford. He was a j
member of Ram's Head and had been
in every Gaieties and Spring Show ,
.since the summer of 1944.
UK WAS CO-DIRECTOR of the
"4(5 Gaieties and the '47 Spring Show
"It's A Deal." He also starred in
"Royal Family," "Devil's Disciple," j
and "Time of Your Life." His one- j
act play, "Papa Traverses," was pro- ;
duced by the department.
A member of Theta Chi fraternity
and Cardinals, Arnold was a yell
leader for one year and a member of
the swimming team.
While at University College, be
sides doing independent study in
Shakespeare, theatrical history, and
stage design, he directed two shows j
at the college. This task was made
more diflicult by the fact that the '
part of the university containing i
the auditorium was demolished by |
n bomb and the plays had to be
t>iven on a small stage in the gym.
DURING HIS STAY in Europe
Arnold also traveled extensively in |
France and Switzerland, visiting !
(heaters and getting in plenty of ski
ing. He was on the University Col- j
lege rugby team and said there is
a tremendous amount of enthusiasm
over sports.
"Kings College is to them as Cal
is to us," he said. "University Col- !
lege's mascot is a statue called Fin
ias. Kings College has a statue of
Regie, the lion. We often went over
and painted Regie assorted colors

and Finias ocasionally disappeared |
from our campus."
ARNOLD SAW A London team '
play against the Australian Walla- !
hies who later trounced Stanford's |
rugby team.
"I just wish I could have warned j
Stanford in time," he said.
English students have a fair
amount of respect for American col- j
leges, according to Arnold. He said
that quite a few of them knew of
Stanford. "Their lecture system is i
very much the same us here, but !
you're more on youi own after- |
wards. It's up to you whether you're
prepared for your exams or not."
FINAL EXAMS are given only
once a year. Since there is quite a |
bit of social life at the colleges the i
students put off much of their study- .
ing for vacations. "Day by day it's j
not so intensive, but in the long run
they work as hard as we do."
As to his impression of college
women, Arnold said, "We usually j
went away from the university to j
get our dates." He said that of all
the places he's been there's nothing j
to compare with Texas and Califor- ]
nia women.
Arnold's present plans are to go to 112
New York in the fall and try to get j
on Broadway. Norman Corwin, i
whom he met while studying in
Canada, was much impressed with
his ability and has arranged intro
ductions for him.
He'd like to go back to Europe
some day, but for the present he's
glad to be back at ihe Farm.
