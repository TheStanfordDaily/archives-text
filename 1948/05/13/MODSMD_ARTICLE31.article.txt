## A 						Will and a Way 
### 
Where there's a will there's a way, an old proverb tells us.
Last year the will to have personal contact between Europeans
E.nd Stanford students was expressed by sending two students to
Europe, their expenses paid by the ASSU. Many doubted that
two students could learn enough to make the cost worth while.
This year the will for personal contact still exists—and the
]IR has found a way. With travel restrictions modified, over 90
students are going to Europe on their>own hook. So that maxi
mum benefit may be obtained from their travels, Cliff Forster of
lIR has organized a Stanford student survey commission. It is
hoped that most of the Farm travelers will take part.
Briefly, the survey commission's purpose is two-fold: to pro
mote understanding by personal contact, and to gather informa
mation. Bill Farrer and Lawrence Grannis upon their return from
Europe last summer impressed their listeners with the impor
tance of closer contact with Europeans—to counterbalance sec
ondrhand information which has injured American reputation
abroad.
Real merit of the plan is its effective organization. Before stu
dents go abroad this summer, they will meet in seminars with
professors who have extensive background knowledge of the
countries being visited.
All of the information obtained by the students abroad-will be
evaluated by field coordinators in seven European capitals. Field
co-ordinators in turn will relay the information to a home base
committee at Stanford for compilation.
If the plan works as projected, Stanford should have consid
erable worthwhile and up-to-date information on Europe by fall
quarter. What Stanford learns will be shared with other schools
ihrough the National Students' Association. All in all, a com
mendable project.—T. M. S.
