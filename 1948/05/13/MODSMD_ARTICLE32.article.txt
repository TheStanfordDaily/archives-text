# CAMPUS OPINION
## Minority Opinion 
### 
To the Editor:
Although Monday's issue of The Daily gave the report of my talk on
civil liberties a flattering degree of prominence, I was more than a little
startled to read what your reporter felt were the highlights of the
discussion. May I use this opportunity to summarize my position on that
issue?
(1) With the growth of international tension since the end of the war,
there has been a marked increase—almost to the point of hysteria—of in
sistence upon conformity.
(2) The democratic principle that minority opinion be allowed free
expression (within commonsense limitations) is based on very practical
conclusions from historical experience: (a) Repression of dissenting
groups compels them to turn to violence as their only outlet; (b) The
majority of today is the minority of yesterday and probably of tomorrow;
jind finally (c) The discovery of scientific and social truths is a goal best
reached where you have, in the words of the late Justice Holmes, "a free
market place of ideas."
(3) Each state has the right, if not the duty, to maintain domestic
order and safeguard its national security. Any government is expected,
therefore, to protect itself from direct incitement to its overthrow and
to guard its security from those whose allegiance is proven dubious. The
logic of the communist credo based on the primacy of the welfare of
the Soviet Union as defined by its leaders would compel a consistent
communist to place his national loyalty on a secondary level. Thus, in
vital areas of national safety appropriate measures against possible dis
loyalty may be necessary.
(4) At the same {ime, utmost care must be taken that no individual
or group be deprived -of civil rights simply on the basis of political non
conformity. We have accused the Soviet Union of using the term "fascist"
far too indiscriminately as a pretext for suppresing opposition. More and
more, we have made ourselves susceptible to same charge in respect to
the word "communist." Today the "scare" technique may inspire fear
among even the mildest dissenters. This is bad in itself. But such a
technique is self-defeating, for in desperation many may choose to be
slain as goats rather than simply as lambs.
In conclusion, then, let me insist that no society can allow its social and
political arteries to harden and still escape the other consequences of
senility. The democratic process, including as it does the twin ingredients
cf majority rule and civil liberties, contains the secret of our society's
eternal youth. To change the formula, as we seem now in danger of
doing, is to destroy the elixir.
