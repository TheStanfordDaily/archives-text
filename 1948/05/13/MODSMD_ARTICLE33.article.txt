Starvation Threatens World
SAN FRANCISCO (UP)—The chief of the United
States Government Soil Conservation Service be
lieves the United States—and the world —will begin
literally to starve to death within 100 years unless
human beings take better care of their soil.
Dr. Hugh 11. Bennett, soil conservation director,
said that only about 4,000,000,000 acres of land in
the world are available for farming right now.
The world population is now a little more than
2.000.000.000, providing an overall average of about
two acres to feed every person.
But, Dr. Bennett pointed out, nutritionists have
discovered it takes almost three acres to provide
enough food for a "minimum nutritional diet." To
add to the already unbalanced situation, he said,
world population is increasing &t about one per cent
per year and available land is being constantly
worn away by erosion, wasteful plowing methods,
and inadequate care.
"It will do no harm at this critical period in our
history," he declared, "to ask ourselves if the
world could feed the 2,000,000,000 more people it
will have in another 10 years at the present rate
of increase."
Erosion, Bennett pointed out, already ranks
among the top world causes of malnutrition,
hunger, and famine.
Japan, among other nations, is already in the dire
straits the whole world might someday meet, he
said. In Japan there is only about one-fourth of an
acre per person to feed the population. China has
only one-half acre, and India, one-third.
In 100 years, with the world's population doubled
and granting that no more land is lost to erosion
and other causes, there will be an average of only
one acre per person in the world.
The United States is now in a comparatively envi
able position, Bennett added, with a little more than
three acres available for each of its 145,000,000 in
habitants.
Bui even here, he warned, the situation is grow
ing worse each year. "In the last 150 years—espe
cially in the last 100 years—half or more of our
American farmlands has been damaged, chiefly
by erosion," he said.
"Originally the topsoil in this coupntry was nine
inches deep. Now it is six inches deep," he added.
About 460,000,000 acres of cropland is left, almost
all of it subject to erosion, flood, and windstorm.
The population is expected to continue increasing,
creating a demand for 8,000,000 new acres of land
every year.
"If it is assumed the same rate of population in
crease continues even for the next few decades," he
warned, "we may be even closer to the danger line
than we think."
Bennett said the only possible way of»solving the
difficulty is immediate, comprehensive crop and
soil conservation measures: contour cultivation,
strip cropping, planting grass on steep land, drain
age of low lands, irrigation of dry lands, and all
the other modern means of preventive conservation.

history," he declared, "to ask ourselves if the
world could feed the 2,000,000,000 more people it
will have in another 10 years at the present rate
of increase."
Erosion, Bennett pointed out, already ranks
among the top world causes of malnutrition,
hunger, and famine.
Japan, among other nations, is already in the dire
straits the whole world might someday meet, he
said. In Japan there is only about one-fourth of an
acre per person to feed the population. China has
only one-half acre, and India, one-third.
In 100 years, with the world's population doubled
and granting that no more land is lost to erosion
and other causes, there will be an average of only
one acre per person in the world.
The United States is now in a comparatively envi
able position, Bennett added, with a little more than
three acres available for each of its 145,000,000 in
habitants.
Bui even here, he warned, the situation is grow
ing worse each year. "In the last 150 years—espe
cially in the last 100 years—half or more of our
American farmlands has been damaged, chiefly
by erosion," he said.
"Originally the topsoil in this coupntry was nine
inches deep. Now it is six inches deep," he added.
About 460,000,000 acres of cropland is left, almost
all of it subject to erosion, flood, and windstorm.
The population is expected to continue increasing,
creating a demand for 8,000,000 new acres of land
every year.
"If it is assumed the same rate of population in
crease continues even for the next few decades," he
warned, "we may be even closer to the danger line
than we think."
Bennett said the only possible way of»solving the
difficulty is immediate, comprehensive crop and
soil conservation measures: contour cultivation,
strip cropping, planting grass on steep land, drain
age of low lands, irrigation of dry lands, and all
the other modern means of preventive conservation.
Starvation Threatens World
SAN FRANCISCO (UP)—The chief of the United
States Government Soil Conservation Service be
lieves the United States—and the world —will begin
literally to starve to death within 100 years unless
human beings take better care of their soil.
Dr. Hugh 11. Bennett, soil conservation director,
said that only about 4,000,000,000 acres of land in
the world are available for farming right now.
The world population is now a little more than
2.000.000.000, providing an overall average of about
two acres to feed every person.
But, Dr. Bennett pointed out, nutritionists have
discovered it takes almost three acres to provide
enough food for a "minimum nutritional diet." To
add to the already unbalanced situation, he said,
world population is increasing &t about one per cent
per year and available land is being constantly
worn away by erosion, wasteful plowing methods,
and inadequate care.
"It will do no harm at this critical period in our
history," he declared, "to ask ourselves if the
world could feed the 2,000,000,000 more people it
will have in another 10 years at the present rate
of increase."
