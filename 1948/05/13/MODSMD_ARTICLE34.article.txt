# Control of Plant Life
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP) —Man today is trying as
never before to take control of plant life away from
Mother Nature.
At an Agriculture Department experiment sta
tion at Bcltsville, Md., man is making Ins hid with
the help of two of his most deadly war weapons—
atomic-powered radioactivity and chemical plant
killers.
Agriculture chemists are using the weapons to spy
on nature. They hope to learn the secret means by
which she regulates plant life. From that knowledge
they hope some day to develop chemicals which man
can use to regulate the life and growth of all plants.
Dr. John W. Mitchell, the department's top au
thority on the subject, cited a few of the practical
possibilities that might stem from such control:
1. Development of chcmicals that could be used to
eliminate all cropland weeds, especially grasses, be
fore they sprout—but at the same time would damage
no crops. That could revolutionize farming by elim

inating the need for the hoe and the cultivator. The
farmer of the future might be able to do all his
weeding with a spray gun and chemicals bought
at the drug store.
2. New chemicals (hal would give the fanner ex
tended control over the rate of growth of his crops.
One possibility is a regulator that would keep fruit
trees from budding until the danger of frost is past
and then would automatically speed up the pro
cess to make up for "lost time." Another possibility
is a regulator that would retain in big peas the
flavor that is obtainable now only in small peas
picked early. The same goes for corn.
3. Chemicals that could be used to increase the
nutritional value of food crops, especially their
mineral content.
Science already has found chemicals that will do
some of those things.
Some of the chemical regulators were found before
the war. Others, such as 2,4-d, were discovered
during the war when scientists turned their at
tention toward helping the military. As a result of
that help, the U. S. Army today is armed with
chemical powders and sprays that can be used in
time of war to kill all plants in an enemy country.
The army has clamped an airtight secrecy on the
subject and won't even talk about it.
