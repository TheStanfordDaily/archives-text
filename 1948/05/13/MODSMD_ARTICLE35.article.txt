## History 1948 University Text Books Examined for Un-Americanism 
### 
Sad is the word for describing the appointment
by the trustees oi the University of Wyoming of a
committee to read several hundred textbooks used
in the university to determine whether any of them
contain anything "subversive or un-American."

There is in this

s action a gratuitous insult to the
good sense and patriotism of the
1 acuity—especially the teachers
of the social sciences—which is
properly resented by the student
body.
And because the university's
trustees do not define "subver
sive and un-American," there is
also an affront to intelligence.
Under these circumstances —and
especially because of the threat

to make this inquisition an an
nual affair — this looks like a
witch hunt pure and simple, and a witch hunt that
stems out of ignorance and false fear.
As usual, the economists, the sociologists, and the
historians get special attention. If it is found that
their books mention Karl Marx or in any way sug
gest that any other people have taken a way other
than that of a narrowly conceived free enterprise
capitalism, there is likely to be a banning and burn
ing of books.
But are Americans of the future to be brought up
in ignorance of rival philosophies and economic sys
tems? If so. how are they to judge the "American
way" when experience suddenly confronts them with
alternatives? What standards of judgment will they
have, what knowledge will buttress their belief that
the American way is the better way?
And what happens to that freedom of inquiry,
that right to examine, to criticize, and to propose
reforms which in the past has kept our democracy
fresh, vigorous, resilient, always adapting itself to
new conditions and new times? Is our way—and the
defense of it—henceforth to be blindness?
That is the way of the totalitarian propagandist—
be he dead Nazi or live Soviet commissar. And look
at the end-fruits of German book-burning! A crazed
idead that "we are right and just now and forever"'
led to the complete destruction of every decent and
democratic principle and way of life in Germany.
Good sense was put to rout, and soon every book
that differed with the German ideology no matter
how slightly was destroyed; and with the burning
of these books went every spark and hope of any
freedom of thought and expression.
But there is more involved here than good sense.
There is also a high principle at stake—the consti
tutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought and ex
pression.
