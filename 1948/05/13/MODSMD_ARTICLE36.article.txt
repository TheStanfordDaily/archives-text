## Bull Session 
### 
You men between the ages of 18 and 25—Do you
want to feel that you have secure position in life?
Are you looking for travel, education, and security?
Well, you may not be looking for them, kiddies,
but unless Congress reshuffles the deck and starts
dealing some different cards, it's a cinch you're going
to find them.
And so, in the interest of all worried young draft
dodgers, we are this morning offering a three-unit
course in "The Service—how to meet it, beat it, or
cheat it." The required texts for our course will
be those two standard army books: "Tom Swift and
his Electric Rifle," and"The Rover Boys at Fort Orel."
As in all courses here at Stanford, we must progress
in accordance with an orderly plan. Thus, we shall
divide our subject, t.hp draft, into the three hiost
obvious alternatives facing us. The are: (1) To ac
tually go into the service, (2) Become a conscientious
objector, or (3) Get married.
We shall first dispose of the second and third
choices because of the distinct similarity between
them. It really doesn't make a lot of difference
whether you become a conscientious objector or a
husband with an objecting conscience. Either way,

you re still just a prisoner. The only difference is
that in one case you have a female guard.
This leaves us with our first proposition of actually
going into the service. If you enter the service, you
have a choice between the army or the navy. This
choice might be compared with that of being run over
by an automobile or by a bus. Personally, I don't
think I could stand navy life. I get seasick in the
footbath at the men's gym.
If you go into the navy, you'll probably be sta
tioned on a flat-top, battle-wagon, or a destroyer.
This, of course, brings us back to our alternate plan
of getting married.
Now. on the other hand, if you take the army . . .
(Wait a minute, that's the best thought I've had all
morning; YOU take the army I'LL stay right here.)
That concludes our little session on that new ad
venture which is awaiting every non-veteran, red
blooded American boy. But however it turns out,
it will be a touching picture when I leave for camp.
The boys at the house will hang a service flag over
my bed as I kiss each of them on the forehead and
murmur, "I shall return!"
