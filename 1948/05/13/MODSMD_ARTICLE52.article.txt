# Card Golfers Play This Weekend
## 
### MARSHALL NUNN 
Coach Eddie Twiggs' Stan
ford golfers take on California
in a dual match tomorrow and
San Jose State Saturday in what
promises to be a very busy
weekend. The Redskins will
travel to Berkeley tomorrow to
meet the Bears in a return match
and will come back to Indian
ville the following day to seek
revenge for an earlier season
defeat suffered at the hands of
the Spartans.
Stanford should not have too
much difficulty in making it two in
a row over Cal when the squads
play over the Mira Vista links to
morrow in an 18-hole match. On
April 24 the Farm men handily
whipped the Cal sextet, 20 to 7.
Since thaf date Stanford has split
a pair of matches in Los Angeles
with PCC opponents and has over
whelmed the Santa Clara Broncos.
While down south, the Indians took
a 35 to 19 decision from UCLA only
to succumb to USC the next day. 32
to 22. Last Saturday the Farm golf
ers completely outclassed Santa
Clara on the home course, 26 to 1.
THREE MEN who have played
well in the past few matches are
Tom Lambie, Bob Rosburg, and Bud
Moe. Rosburg, a veteran of last
year's team and the longest-driving
man in the starting lineup, carded
the lowest score of the day in both
the UCLA and USC matches. He
shot a 72 against the Bruins and a
74 against the Trojans.
Lambie also returned from last
season s team and has made con
sistently good performances in
matches played so far. He fired a
sizzling 69 when Stanford beat Cal
late in April.
Moe is playing his first season as.
a varsity regular. He saw action as'
a reserve last year. He has played
steady golf all season and shows
signs of improvement with every
match.
'iHE CAL MATCH will get under
way at 1:30 p.m. and here are tlie
probable starting lineups: Cal—
Don Schwab, Sandy Munroe, Bob
Hanna, Frank Minch, Bob McPher
•son. and Don Lane. Stanford—Bob
Rosburg, Tom Lambie, Bob Crazier,
Jack Shuler, Bud Moe, and Ernie
Kellberg.
The San Jose match Saturday will
be a real test of the Indians'
strength. The Spartans field one of
the classiest sextets on the Coast
and edged the home team to
14Vi when they met on April 17 in
San Jose.
Teeing-off time for the Stanford-
San Jose match, a 36-hole contest
scheduled for the Indians' course, is
9 a.m. for the singles and 1 p.m. for
the doubles.
Some ol the best-known and most
capable golfers in this part of the
country will be in the San Jose
lineup—Morgan Fottrell. Eli Berit
teau, Bobby Harris, Ross Smith,
Warren McCarty, and Howard Ve
rutti.
McCarty shot a 66 in the April 17
match and did a lot of damage to
Stanford's cause.


BOIJ ROSBERG, veteran Stan
ford golfer, will be favored to take
his matches against California and
San Jose State this weekend.
