With nothing to lose and almost
everything to gain, Stanford's dia
mond men will invade Los Angeles
(his weekend for a two-game series
with the league-leading USC Tro
jans. The varsity will board the
Daylight at noon on its way to Wrig
ley Field where the games will be
played on Friday and Saturday night.
Sam Barry's fancy Trojans will be
favored to grab both contests, espe
cially since they will be performed
under the lights. The wild one,
Wally Hood, is at his best with the
darker backgrounds. Dick Horst
and Dick Bishop, the other two Tro
jan flingers will share the mound
duties on the second night.
STANFORD HAD A CRACK at
all three USC pitchers in the first
game here in the Sunken Diamond
(SC won, 12 to 10, in 10 innings)
when the Cards shelled both Horst
and Bishop, but were flattened by
the stingy Hood.
HARRY WOLTERS will carry
four pitchers on the trip south, and
is likely to use all of them. Dave
Dahle and Dave Stott will probably
be the starters, and they will be
backed up by Frank Labium, who
beat Cal, and Charlie Bell.
