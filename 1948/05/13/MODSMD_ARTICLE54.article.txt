# Wealth of Material in Backfield For 1948 Edition of Card Grid Machine
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Last year about this time Farm
football fans were sitting back and
eyeing with joy the backfield that
would romp for the Big Red Ma
chine in 1947. Fellows by the names
of Merriman, Quist, Titus, Ander
son, and others were sure-fire All -
Coasters, and all-this and that.
Came fall and that backfield just
was not there. Injuries and pro
baseball took their toll, and Mar
chie Schwartz didn't know who was
going to be able to start from one
fcveek to the next.
THE ID4S EDITION of the Ma
chine doesn't stack up to the pre
-1947 vision, but there is some prom
ising material present, and backs
should hold up their end of the
team next fall.
At quarterback, Schwartz has
three men from whom to choose.
Don Campbell has far surpassed his
1947 form. He is one of the most
improved men on the squad. Don
has worked hard at the quarterback
job and seems to be a natural foot
ball player.
"The Rock" is capable of 60-niin
ute ball. His passing is good as his
play - sequence knowledge. He is
probab'y the best defensive back
on the team.
GOOD AS HE IS, Campbell is
going to have to give some room to
freshman Torn Shaw. Shaw throws
a fine bullet pass that has shown up
well in the spring practices.
In Saturday's scrum he got a lot
of good defense for his tossing. He
also has the know-how to run the
team. Either of these lads may grab
the starting call on Sept. 18, the
date of the San Jose State game.
Aubrey Devine is the third man
out for quarterback. Aub saw a
lot of action last year when the
quarterback roster was hit with
injuries. He knows football from
start to finish.
Left half spot is probably the
strongest position on the squad. A!
Turriziani looks to be the best man j
out right now. He runs well on the
traps and quick openers. As a
broken field runner he will do well.

Boyd Benson, freshman winner of
the most valuable player this year,
is one fine ball player. He is like
a bulldog ori offensive blocking. He
carries his blocks through long af
ter the play has stopped. If there
is a break - away runner on the
team, it is this 165-pounder. He
cuts, pivots, and in general acts
like a coach's dream.
DAVE FIELD looked good in the
Big Game. He'has missed of
spring practice because of teeth
trouble. He is a hard runner and
cannot be counted out for one mo
ment.
Bob Anderson, if he regains his
1946 form, cannot be left off the
first string. He is out for swimming
now.John Holloway is very fast.
He is a 100-yard dash man for the

frosh track team. With experience
he will do well.
Way-ne Erickson is listed here as
right halfback, but in all probability
Sabu will see action in three back
field positions next year. He can
perform equally well from the left
or right half, or even fullback slot.
ERICKSON MADE two touch
downs in the Big Game. He will be
valuable as a spot playerâ€”one to
be used as the situation dictates.
Look for him to be in and out of
the games a great deal.
Jim Nafziger was a disappoint
ment last year. This is as good a
time as any to clear up the slate.
Jim got hurt but badly in the
Michigan game. He was reinjured
in the Santa Clara tilt and never
operated at full speed from then on.
He is in good shape now and has
shown up very well in the lost four
weeks. He is the probable starter.
He has break-away speed and must
be hit low to be brought down.
MICKY TITUS is still a question
mark. His knee was operated on
during the winter, and he has not
given it a chance to go lame again.
He will don pads for the first time
Sept. 1.
Jim Hayes, though bothered by a
lame leg. looked good Saturday. He
is a frosh that wi'l shine in time to
oome, a g-lod open field runner, Two
more freshmen, John Banks and
Wayne Buck, add to the roster oi
good backs. It will be hard for ei
ther of them to grab starting berth.
The competition is just too much.
Watch them in the future.
ELK PUCKETT is a stocky lad

who has impressed the coaching
staff with his running and line
backing. When he carries the ball
it is forward motion only.
Marty Anderson joined in yester
day's scrimmage for the first time
because of track duties. He prompt
ly romped 30 yards to score from
tiie fullback spot. He is tast, very
much so. and can give Emery
Mitchell and Bud Klein a battle for
offensive honors.


DON CAMPBELL receives the Eller-DeSwarte Memorial Award for
outstanding sophomore football play from FOOTBALL COA C H
MARCHIE SCHWARTZ. The trophy will be given each year to the
sophomore football pla\er who. in the opinion of the coaching staff,
shows the most improvement. This is the first year that it has been
awarded.
