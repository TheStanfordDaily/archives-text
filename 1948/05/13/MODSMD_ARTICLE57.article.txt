# Frosh Nine, Menlo Vie
## 
### 
The '51 baseballers meet Menlo JC !
on the Freshman Diamond at 3 p.m. ;
The frosh suffered a letdown from j
their victory over Cal Saturday and
dropped a 3 to 1 game to the USF
freshmen Tuesday.
The Card fielding which looked so
good in the Cal game was missing
Tuesday. Five miscues marred Den
ny Tuffanelli's fine six-hit pitching j
job.
Today's pitching assignment will
probably go to lanky Jim Claypool. l
Jim tossed a five-hitter at the Cal '
Cubs Saturday after pitching hitless
ball for seven innings.
This game will mark the second
time the Menlo boys have invaded ]
the Farm this season. Three weeks j
ago they hooked up with the Jay- I
vees who all but blew the JCs out
of Sunken Diamond. 13 to 5.
Frosh lineup:
Ken La Cross, ss; Denny Tuffanel- i
li, cf; Jim Trabucco, If; Dick Clegg, j
rf; Bill Herron, c; Joe Pinotti. 2b; ,
Sal Coletto. 3b; Don McComber, lb;
