TEL AVIV, May 13 (UP)â€”Moshe
Shertok, foreign minister-designate
of the Jewish government, an
nounced today that the United States
had asked the Jewish Agency to de
lay the establishment of a Jewish
state until a later date.
Asked whether the agency would
delay the declaration of an inde
pendent, sovereign Jewish state,
scheduled for midnight tomorrow,
Shertok said:
"There is an iron certainty we
will not leave a vacuum here even
for one second."
This, he indicated, meant that un
les the United Nations provide some
authority to take over when the
British mandate ends tomorrow
night, the Jewish state would be
proclaimed.
