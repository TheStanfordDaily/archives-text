# Benny to Spark Sunday Flickers
## 
### 
Jack Benny and Patsy Kelly com
bine their talents in the next fea
ture of the Sunday Evening Series,
"Keep 'Em Laughing." This early
comedy incorporates most of the
typical Benny type of humor that
helped him become one of America's
top comedians.
Tom Kirby continues to light the
Morris gang for possession of the
Placer City gold mines in Chapter
Ten of the serial, "The Last Fron
tier." The serial will again feature
the acrobats, wrestlers, expert gun
men, ropers, champion riders, and
knife-throwers of this saga of the
Old West.
Admission is 20 cents. The show
starts at 7:30 p.m.
