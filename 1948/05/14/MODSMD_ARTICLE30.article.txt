## Religion's Place? 
### 
What place does religion have in the life of a college student
today?
Yes, it's a thought-provoking guestion. It's the guestion that
will keynote an examination of the Stanford Family by the Stan
lord Family all next week. In a series of bull sessions in almost
every living group students and faculty will meet to exchange
ideas about a topic of universal interest—religion.
That meeting of students and faculty on a more or less egual
ground—where ideas and not facts are the important things—
one of the best aspects of the Week on Religion. The oppor
tunities for meeting your professors anywhere but in a lecture
room are not common.
The other important factor in this re-examination of our be
liefs and ideas is that it brings out the best of what university
life can offer to anyone. This week's program should utilize those
peculiar aspects of university life not found anywhere else to
Ihe best advantage of all, i.e. students living and talking together
under the guidance and direction of experienced, intelligent pro
fessors.
When this Week of Religion is over there will be no reso
lutions to draw up —no world-shaking conclusions to summarize
and present anywhere. The gains, if any, will be in terms of
each individual and therefore intangible.
It sounds like a good experience and an interesting experi
ment.—M. H.
