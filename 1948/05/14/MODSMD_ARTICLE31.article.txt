# CAMPUS OPINION
## What's Your Opinion?

To the Editor:
Excom has just requested the Committee on Public Exercises
to invite the Presidential nominees from the major national po
litical parties to speak at Stanford. If such a proposal were carried
by majority vote of the committee, it would mean that right after
the conventions invitations would be sent by the University to
the nominees, inviting them to speak here in the autumn quarter
before the November general election.
Of course, the final validity of the invitations would be con
tingent upon the affirmaitve replies to the invitations by all or
most of the men invited. However, there is a fighting chance in
1948 for the faculty and student body to hear the Presidential
contenders speak at Stanford in the Memorial Auditorium, or if
:he weather will permit, in the Amphitheater.
When Stanford Students for Wallace initially presented this
request to Professor Stalnaker, chairman of the Public Exerises
Committee, it gave as one of its reasons for approval that since
democratic political activity and thought are a valid function of
our education, it wanted to hear all other candidates, in addition
to its own, present their views to Stanford.
A responsible body will meet very shortly to decide this mat
ter. It is composed of ten faculty members—and no students.
Since the decision of this exclusively faculty body will directly
affect the opportunities of a majority of Stanford students to make
wise choices in 1948, you are urged as individuals to make known
your own views on this issue, pro or con, to the several members
of this committee before it meets to make a definitive decision.
The members of this committee should be very happy to get an
opinion—nay, a mandate—from students and faculty colleagues
in order to shape their respective votes. A short note or personal
contacts with any of the committee members should be more than
adequate. The members of this committee, together with their re
spective office numbers, follow:
Chairman John Stalnaker, Adm. 161 A
Professor William Cowley, e45
Professor William Crosten, 200 Knoll
Professor Hubert Heffner, m 203
Professor Paul Kirkpatrick, 384
Professor George Sensabaugh, 51
Professor Hugh Skilling, 505
Professor Rixford Snyder, 229
Professor F. Cowles Strickland, PA 22751
Professor Samuel Thurman, 114
Respectfully submitted,
