## Soviet Develops Arctic 
### 
NEW YbRK (UP) —In the Greenwich Village sec
tion of New York, on a street where trucks haul
cargo down to the Hudson River docks, stands a
dreary red apartment building covered with grime.
Ash cans line the sidewalk and baby carriages clutter
its entrance.
Inside, one flight up, the eminent Arctic explorer
Vilhpalmum Stefansson sits among his 20.000 polar
books and documents. From his cramped quarters
he watches the Soviet Union and the North American
powers maneuver for position in the vast area above
the Arctic Circle where he spent a great many of
his 68 years.
He sees the Soviet Union far surpassing the
United States and Canada in developing its Arctic
resources.
Strategically, he feels the Arctic Sea is the most
important body of water on earth. The Russians,
he contends, are giving their far northern defenses
a broad base through intensive colonization. The
United States and Canada are failing to do so.
"We of North America are told that among our
present weaknesses is the tremendous size of our
cities,and the top-heavy grouping of our industries
around a few centers." Stefansson said. "There is
the same talk in the Moscow press and on their radio.
The difference is that they are doing more about it
than we are.
"Believing that eventually there would be an at
tack on the Soviet from the east and west, they
began building industrial centers in Siberia.
"Now that they are beginning to visualize an
attack from North America, they have an added
tendency to move their colonization north, this time
on the basis of being ready to counterattack in an
air war."
The explorer, born in Canada of Icelandic par
ents, is the most prominent American protagonist
of the view that the Far North is habitable. "The
friendly Arctic," he calls it. His explorations of
Arctic Canada, Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland
since the beginning of the century have stressed
scientific investigation of living conditions.
His weather-beaten face beneath abundant white
hair, and his blue Nordic eyes, accustomed to focusing
on distances, look oddly incongruous in his tiny office
at the end of a hallway stacked so deep with books
that visitors must file through it in single line.
If is his belief that Russia is making great strides
in the Arctic because the Soviet peoples possess
the same pioneering spirit that drove Americans
across the praries 100 years ago. The Soviet gov
ernment is fostering this expansionist spirit in the
Arctic because it sees the economic and military
rewards.
"There are as many Soviet cities of 30.000 and
40.000 in the Far North as we have villages of 300
and 400,'' Stefansson said.
As an example of what the Soviets are doing, he
cited Vorkuta, a city of 30,000 which stands 70 miles
north of the Arctic Circle and 800 miles cast of
Murmansk in the Pechora coal basin.
When it was decided to exploit the coal resources
there, the Soviet government moved in construcion
crews, built housing and other urban facilities and
then constructed a 700-mile railroad southward
to bring out the coal.
To help feed the miners, the government estab
lished the Vorkuta agricultural station. Twelve state
farms produce vegetables and dairy products for the
city. Experiments have been made to develop frost
l esisting types. The Arctic earth now is yielding rye,

barley, and potatoes during the brief but warm
summer.
At Uklita, an oil-producing center south of Vor
kuta, standing slightly below the Arctic Circle,
there is a similar story. This city has grown to
40.000 population and had an eleven-fold increase
in oil production between 1940 and 1!>4;».
"Vorkuta and Ukhta together equal the 70,000 total
population in all Alaska," the explorer pointed out.
In America we have lost the pioneering spirit,"
he said. Instead of seeking new places to colonize,
we have reversed the nineteenth century trend and
are migrating to places like Southern California
where the climate is easy. We don't have to worry
about creating the necessities of life for ourselves.
Modern transportation and our highly developed
economy bring them to us."

cargo down to the Hudson River docks, stands a
dreary red apartment building covered with grime.
Ash cans line the sidewalk and baby carriages clutter
its entrance.
Inside, one flight up, the eminent Arctic explorer
Vilhpalmum Stefansson sits among his 20.000 polar
books and documents. From his cramped quarters
he watches the Soviet Union and the North American
powers maneuver for position in the vast area above
the Arctic Circle where he spent a great many of
his 68 years.
He sees the Soviet Union far surpassing the
United States and Canada in developing its Arctic
resources.
Strategically, he feels the Arctic Sea is the most
important body of water on earth. The Russians,
he contends, are giving their far northern defenses
a broad base through intensive colonization. The
United States and Canada are failing to do so.
"We of North America are told that among our
present weaknesses is the tremendous size of our
cities,and the top-heavy grouping of our industries
around a few centers." Stefansson said. "There is
the same talk in the Moscow press and on their radio.
The difference is that they are doing more about it
than we are.
"Believing that eventually there would be an at
tack on the Soviet from the east and west, they
began building industrial centers in Siberia.
"Now that they are beginning to visualize an
attack from North America, they have an added
tendency to move their colonization north, this time
on the basis of being ready to counterattack in an
air war."
The explorer, born in Canada of Icelandic par
ents, is the most prominent American protagonist

Arctic Canada, Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland

scientific investigation of living conditions.

If is his belief that Russia is making great strides
in the Arctic because the Soviet peoples possess
the same pioneering spirit that drove Americans
across the praries 100 years ago. The Soviet gov

Arctic because it sees the economic and military
rewards.
"There are as many Soviet cities of 30.000 and
40.000 in the Far North as we have villages of 300
and 400,'' Stefansson said.
As an example of what the Soviets are doing, he
cited Vorkuta, a city of 30,000 which stands 70 miles
north of the Arctic Circle and 800 miles cast of
Murmansk in the Pechora coal basin.
When it was decided to exploit the coal resources
there, the Soviet government moved in construcion
crews, built housing and other urban facilities and
then constructed a 700-mile railroad southward
to bring out the coal.
To help feed the miners, the government estab
lished the Vorkuta agricultural station. Twelve state
farms produce vegetables and dairy products for the
city. Experiments have been made to develop frost
l esisting types. The Arctic earth now is yielding rye,

barley, and potatoes during the brief but warm
summer.
