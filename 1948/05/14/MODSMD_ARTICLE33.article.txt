## History 1948 Creeping Committeeitis Hits Congress 
### 
Creeping committeeitis is eating away one of the
major reforms which Congress made in its structure
anr procedures under the legislative reorganization
law of 1946.
There have been a cumbersomely large number
of committees—B2 in all. The reorganization act

reduced the total to 34. This re
form not only brought the size of
the committee structure within
practicable standards so that bills
would be referred to certain com
mittees because that was where
they belonged and not because of
the kind of hearing they would
receive there, favorable or unfa
vorable.
In a single year Congress has
nullified something like a third of
its reform in the number of com-

mittees. The reorganization act reduced the number
by 48. The net reduction now is about 30. Further
inroads on this reform are likely from two sources:
First, headline grabbing; second, unwillingness of
existing committees to make investigations that
might prove politically embarrassing.
Perhaps it should be the duty of every single
Congress to reassess its committee structure and cut
away the deadwood. A bill whacking away again
at the lush excess growth of committees ought to
be introduced. Objective standards describing the
jurisdiction of every committee ought to be further
developed, so that no committee can evade its own
responsibilities or grab any other's.
And while Congress is about it, it ought to do a
little more toward earning the increases in salaries
and perquisities which its members obtained under
the reorganization act. Members of Congress will
not have earned the increase until they correct the
worst remaining faults of the national legislature.
Too long has Congress been granting itself "fa
vors" not only in a monetary way but also in diverse
material ways. Because Congress formulates and
passes the laws for the rest of the citizens of the
United States, Congress does not have the right to
grant to themselves salaries and perquisities which
they do not deserve.
They owe it to their constituents to correct the
faults of the national legislature— correct it by lim
iting the excessive powers of the House Rules Com
mittee, putting restraint on the Senate filibuster,
and finding some better criterion for advancement
than the seniority system.
