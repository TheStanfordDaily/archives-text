# Trackmen Compete at Fresno
## 
### 
A traveling squad of 24 Stanford
traeksters, including live freshmen,
will leave tomorrow morning for the
Fresno Relays, where a large share
of the Pacific Coast Olympic hope
fuls will compete.
Sensational races and new marks
will be in order Saturday, as the
important athletic club trackmen
will compete along side of the Pa
cific Coast Conference and inde
pendent college teams.
Although weakened by certain
key injuries, the Indians are not to
be counted out. During the past
week, the team has been concen
trating on passing the baton. All of
the running events, ecept for the
high hurdles, are relays.
IN THE MILE RELAY, which is
a regular event in the dual meets,
Stanford seems very strong. The
same combination which beat Cal's
team by such a large margin will
run Saturday.
Naturally, A! Wilkins, George j
Grimes, Pitch Johnson, and Larry j
Hoff won't have to run their regular
events, but Wilkins and Johnson are j
also entered in the sprint relays I
which come before the mile relay, j
Hoff and Grimes are also entered j
in the medley, along with A 1 Holu- '
bar and A 1 Lyons.
The two-mile relay finds three 1
half - mile men, Ted Off, George
Grimes, and A 1 Holubar, and miler !
A 1 Lyons, who has run very credi
tably in the shorter distance. Cali- !

fornia seeems to offer good strength |
in this event.
THE HIGH HURDLES should be
the Cards' best event. Darrell j
Kreitz, Downing McKee, and Skip
Kent are all serious threates, and

probably will place high on the I
list. Craig Dixon of the Bruins will j
be the man to beat. Dell RusselJ
will probably enter the 400-meter j
hurdles.
Otis Chandler is Stanford's hope
in the weights, along with Norm
Nourse in the shot. Chandler will '
have a big job on his hands winning j
the shot with Jerry Shipkey, Bill
Bayless, Jim Delaney, and Wilbur
Thompson to contend with. Steve ,
McKee will not compete, but it is
hoped that he will be ready for the
Pacific Coast meet.
BUD IIELI) in the javelin and
Bill Larson in the pole vault are |
likely to place high in the meet, j
Both will have a great deal of com- j
petition. Fred Fank and Merritt
Van Sant will carry the Card colors
in the broad jump. Van Sant had a
successful season with the Indian
frosh, jumping over 23 feet, but now
j has to compete in the open class.
Stanford will send four frosh mile
relay men to compete against the
i other frosh teams. The frosh speed
sters are Erick Southwood, Hicks
Williams, Joss Scroggy, and Cass
Bly, who were undefeated in all of
the frosh meets.


DARRELL KREITZ, one of the
strong Indian hurdle trio, is
shown skimming the lows in the
Cal meet. He will enter the high
hurdles at the Fresno Relay* to
morrow.
