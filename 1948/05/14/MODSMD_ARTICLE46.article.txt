# Racketmen Play Twice
## 
### 
Today the varsity tennis squad
visits College of the Pacific for the
second match between the two
teams. Tomorrow the net men re
turn to Stanford to meet San Fran
cisco State's tennis men at 1:30 p.m.
The last time Stanford played
COP the Card team won 4 to 2 in
an incomplete match. A second win
is expected despite valiant efforts
of COP's Hank Pfister and Don
Hamilton.
The Golden Caters of SF State
should give little opposition to the
hard-luck Stanfordites who made
UCLA fight for its victory last Sat
urday.
The Gaters' prize player, Joe
Woolfson, will meet Kirk Mechem
in the number one singles. Mechem
has been unable to win his events
in recent matches, but has the .skill
and ability to run over Woolfson.
Bob Lewis, who could have won
the UCLA meet with a little more
effort in any two of 11 match points,
will be out to prove his mettle
against the lowly Gaters.
