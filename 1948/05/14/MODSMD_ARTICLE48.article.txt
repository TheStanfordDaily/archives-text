# Stanford Varsity Nine Meets Trojans Twice
## 
### 
Stanford's hot and mostly cold baseballers are already in Los
Angeles waiting patiently until tonight when they will play their
first of two games'against USC's league-leading Trojans. The
Cards will take on the Trojans tonight and tomorrow night on
Wrigley Field.
Southpaw David Dahle will pitch the first game against Troy's

Wallace Hood, son of an umpire.4
Frank Labrum (conqueror of Cal) I
will be on the firing line Saturday
night against USC's number two |
(linger, Dick Bishop.
TIIE TERRIBLE TROJANS are i
coasting along in front of the CIBA
pack with 8 wins and 2 losses, while
Stanford is struggling to survive in
fourth place with 4 wins and 15
losses.
USC's all-league nominees, Hal
Workman in left field and Jim
Brideweser at shortstop, will head
the Trojan reception committee, al
though rangy Wally Hood will
probably give Stanford the most
trouble.
Tonight Stanford will try to equal
its initial performance against Sam
Barry's vaunted squad. At that time,
the Indians almost topped USC, but
blew two runs and the ball game in
the 10th inning.
CHARLIE COLE, who is the hot
test hitter in the league right now
with .389 batting average, will lead
the Card clubbers into action.
George Sloat, a late entry to the
starting lineup, wi'l remain in right
field. Otherwise Stanford's lineup
will be the same tonight as it was !
in the first game.

Sloat will start in the outfield. Bill
Arce, Buck Brownson, Dave Melton,
and Charlie Cole will form the in
field. And Dave Dahle and Frank
MacGraw will make up the start- ,
ing battery. Other pitchers on hand i
