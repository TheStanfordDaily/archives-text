# Paddlers Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team
will climax its 1948 dual meet sea
son tomorrow with a return en
gagement against the University of
California Bears.
The meet will be held in the var
sity pool at Berkeley, and begins
at 10 a.m.
The contest will be by way of a
warm-up for the coming PCC meet,
as the two squads will square off
once again next Saturday in the
conference championship meet at
the Eneina Pools.
The Indians scored an easy 46
to 29 victory over the Cal squad
in their last meeting, and on the
basis of past performances should
have little trouble with the game
but outclassed Bears tomorrow.
Five record attempts and the re
newed sprint rivalry of Bob An
derson and Cal's Stan Morketter will
highlight the meet.
Stanford's medley relay team of
Jack Weeden, Don Hester, and Dick
Narver, will try to lower their own
PCC mark. Ralph Sala wil go after
the conference standards for the 220
and 440-yard distances, and either
Anderson or Morketter could break
the existing PCC sprint records.
The Stanford freshmen will face
the Cub mermen in the preliminary
meet.
