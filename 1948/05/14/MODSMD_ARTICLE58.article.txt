# Seismograph Finds Oil...But It Can't Record Earthquake
## 
### AL HARBER 
Seismograph? Sureâ€”that's a
thing that tells you all about
earthquakes, isn't it?
Not this one, Mac. The one you're
thinking of is located out near the
golf course. The $20,000 portable ex
ploratory seismograph, obtained last
summer by Dean A. . Levorsen of'
the School of Mineral Sciences from
the Shell Oil Company (which had j
retired it "with honors" after its
disclosures in the East Cromwell
area of the Oklahoma fields), would
n't quite know what to do with an '
earthquake.
But oil, now, and rock formations
. . . That's a different matter. Or, I
more exactly, the instrument's abil
ity to aid in mapping the depths of 1
geostrata or particular sedimentary !
beds iu which there might be pock
ets of oil makes the difference.
STANFORD'S PORTABLE seis
mograph, carefully reconditioned by i
John Manning, graduate student in
geology, under the direction of
George Thompson, instructor in geo- (
physics, needs only final adjust- |
ments before it will again be record- j
ing seismic waves on its photo
graphic tape.
The earth-probing instrument will ;
be able to locate and give the ap- |
proximate thickness of strata down |
to about 20,000 feet. Though its in
tended use by students will be more
of an academic nature, this is 8,000
feet below all but the deepest oil
wells now in production.
Data are recorded on the machine's
tape on the same principle that an
echo is received by the ear. A
sub-surface explosion of dynamite
causes seismic waves of varying du
ration, intensity, and strength to be
reflected from, and through, deeply
buried rock layers of varied densi- j
ties.
THE WAVES are picked up by
geophones (receivers which one
might easily mistake for large to- j
mato cans) extended across a select- j
ed area above the explosion. Con- 1
verted by the geophones into elec
tric impulses, the shock waves are
further amplified and filtered into a
corresponding number of galvanom
eters.
Each galvanometer controls a
beam of light whose jagged move
ments are collected on a sensitized
moving tape in the last of five, foot
square aluminum boxes comprising
the unit. It is necessary for an ex
pert with a knowledge of the re
gional geology to interpret the re
sults.
MANNING HOPES to have the
seismograph ready for use by geo

physics lab sections this coming fall.
Utilizing the knowledge of forma- |
lions encountered during the drilling I
j of two wells recently sunk on the j
i campus as a basis for their explora- I
tions, students will be able to map
tor the first time the strata under- :
lying the neighborhood of the Farm.
Not, of course, that there's oil in
j the vicinity. But is there a tuition
paver in the University who would
object?
