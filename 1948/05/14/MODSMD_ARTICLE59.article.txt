# 1908 'Bible' Advised Frosh
## 
### HERB SMITH 
According to history, Stanford of j
1908 was a rowdy place where a
great number of students seemed to
do nothing but raise cain. However,
one would certainly get the oppo
site impression from the "Frosh
Bible" of that year.
It is easy to see from where the
term "Bible" came. The little red
handbook was published by the
YMCA and YWCA. It strongly ad
vised all students to join Bible study
groups and live what may be called
a good, clean life.
Perhaps the most interesting part
ol the "Bible" is the "dos" and
"don'ts" on pages 10 and 11. The
first "do" is to "Join one of the
Christian Associations." The last one
is to "Patronize our advertisers. They [

| make this book possible." One can
| detect a slight bit of non-partisan
editorializing in this advice.
The gem among the "dontV is
"Don't go to Ruble more than three
evenings in the first week." One
wonders where the freshman girls,
so new to college life, were to
spend the other four nights.
Perhaps the Stanford "Rough" in
that day was interested in how he
dressed. Appealing to masculine
vanity, Angevine, "Leading Tailor,"
advertised, "Keen Klothes for Keen
Boys Kut by a Keen Cutter."
The Stanford Pharmacy on the
Circle in Palo Alto must have been
quite popular with the boys. They
advertised, *'If you don't find it at
the Stanford Pharmacy it is not in
Palo Alto."

| Chaparral doesn't seem to have
changed much in the passing years.
The "Bible" rescribes it as a "comij
periodical." The Stanford Book
store advertised, "This store is con
ducted for two purposes:
"First, to give the students and
faculty prompt and efficient service
second, to sell goods at lowest pos -
sible prices."
The "Bible" lists tuition as $10 1-
semester, to be waived if a studen*
is a California resident; board an
room was $25 maximum a month
These rates prove the great value o
tradition in Stanford life. Root
rent in Encina is three times a
much as it was thirty years ago
And what has been added to tha
illustrious hall? Tradition, of course
