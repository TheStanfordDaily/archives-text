PARIS (UP). —"Women are tired
of old knock-knees." •
That was Elsa Schiaparelli's com
-1 ment on attempts of some Paris de
-1 signers to chop a few inches on skirt
lengths.
"Women the world over are sick
to death of short skirts," she said
i tartly. "Any change now is silly."
Her new collection shows skirts for
daytime wear dropped as low as
. ankle-length.
Several times a week, men call up
) "Scap," as her friends call her, and
plead that she make skirts shorter.

"They (the legs) are so much nicer
when we can see them," is the talk
ing point.
To that she argues that if legs are
pretty, then the ankles are pretty 1
and you can get just as much of a
kick out of seeing pretty ankles as
calves—even more.
"Long skirts are more feminine. I
We needed the change," she said.
Mine. Schiaparelli wore a brown j
velvet hat, with green feathers and
a black day suit. Her lipstick was
bright cerise and her eyes were
heavily shadowed with blue.

Her collection also is crowded with j
orange color combinations such as'
salmon with shocking pink, navy and I
black, and red and yellow.
"Most women are making the mis
take these days of wearing too many
mud colors," the veteran Paris de
signer said.
"Bright clear colors are pretty for
the skin, and make you feel better."
Talking of the new back fullness
and ruffles which dot her presenta
tion this year, Schiaparelli said:
"There is nothing new about the
trend toward the back.

Scap does not approve of the new
corsets, either. "They are not grace -
ful," she said, "and what's more, it's
very hard to eat with one of thosi
iron girdles pinching you."
To prove to skeptical men that he"
fashions of long skirts, gently swing -
ing backs, and normal waists ar
more becoming, Schiaparel'.i has
special photograph of a row c
women sitting at one of her co
lections, all wearing short, tigr
skirts.
"Look at those hams," she sai.
"Awful!"
