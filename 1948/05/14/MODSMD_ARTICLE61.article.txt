The Stanford Research Insti
tute is the organization name
given to the 54 scientists and as
sistants who have their head
quarters in the two-story build
ing in front of the Middlefield
Road entrance to Stanford Vil
lage.
October. 194(5, saw the conception
of the Research Institute as one of j
the few independent, non-profit re- !
search organizations in the United
States. It is the first on the Pacific-
Coast and serves the entire West.
The Institute is independent of all

industrial concerns, of the govern- !
ment, and of Stanford University it
se'f. A good definition of the Insti
tute's relationship to the Univer- |
sity has been given by William E. j
Rand, assistant director of the Insti
tute, who said:
"THE STANFORD Research In
stitute is a separate corporation, de
riving its broad policy from the Uni
versity, but serving industry. The
board of directors of the Institute is
composed of both trustees of the
University ami of West Coast indus
trialists. Although incorporated sep
arately, the Institute occasionally
uses University personnel and fa
cilities."

The Research Institute is non
profit in that it hits no dividend-re-
I ceiving owners. Surplus money is
| plowed back into the Institute it
self.
"The Stanford Research Institute
is interested in, and will be equipped
to handle, any problems that will
yield to the research approach, and
! which any individual, enterprise, or
agency is willing to sponsor," says
the official Institute pamphlet. This
usually turns out in practice to be
scientific research, either pure or
applied, financed by industry or
government.
Hit. JESSE E. HOBSON, the new
ly appointed 37-year-old director of j
the Institute, arrived in March. A
native of Indiana, Dr. Hobson re
ceived the Ph.D. Magna Cum Laude j
from Cal Tech in 1935. In 1940 he '
[ received the Eta Kappa Nu award
as "The Outstanding Young Elec
trical Engineer of the United States." }
Dr. Hobson has been the director of
the Armour Research Foundation in
Chicago since 1944.
"'1 HE ARMOUR Research Foun
dation is what I hope the Stanford

Research Institute will be," said Dr.
Hobson. Joining him as associate di
rector will be Dr. Thomas C. Poul
ter, founder of the Armour Research
Foundation. In addition, Dr. Hobson
will recruit other specialists for the
Stanford Research Institute. He
plans to raise the Institute's budget
from its present $350,000 a year to
over $1,000,000 by 1950.
Interesting projects have already
been embarked upon by the Insti
tute. The guayule project, to de
velop a better rubber from the Mex
ican plant, has been completed. The
liquid surface chemistry project has
determined the depth of a liquid
surface to be approximately a mil
lionth of an inch, find has uncovered
basic principles of molecular rela
tions. The food acceptance labora
tory. sponsored by food manufactur
ers, tests food for appeal to consum
ers.
TIIE SMOG PROJECT, financed
by the West Coast oil industry, has
singled out elemental sulfur as the
chief irritant in Los Angeles smog.


SMOG PROJECT has been one of (he confidential undertakings behind
the Village doors of the Stanford Research Institute.
