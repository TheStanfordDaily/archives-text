# Students Probe Cliffs for Minerals
## Numerous Departments Combine In 'New' Stanford Science School

They have rocks in their heads- and they're proud of it.
You see them at Carmel and Santa Cruz stumbling amongsi
the jagged cliffs and venturing into caves and caverns no ordi
nary Byron or hermit would risk his neck in.
You see them upturning stones and filling their pockets with

sea shells like Midwestern tourists.
You see them in Yosemite, their
heads hanging out of the car win
dows carefully scrutinizing the sides
of the mountains, the depth of the
valley, the valley floor, the bottoms
of the clear rivers, the vegetation,
the way the valley winds, the num
ber of dents in the rock walls.
They are not just Stanford stu
dents; they are students in the
School of Mineral Sciences, popu
larly called "geology majors."' There
are 88 of these people, (JO of whom
are graduate students and three of
whom are women.
The School of Mineral Sciences is
more than just geology. It is com
posed of the departments of geo
j chemistry, geology, geophysics, met-
J allurgy, mining, and petroleum en
' gineering.
Until last year these departments
! were parts of two other schools—
| the School of Engineering and the
School of Physical Sciences. In Jan
uary, 1947, the six departments were
combined to form the School of Min
eral Sciences, and A. I. Levorsen, a
, successful Tulsa petroleum geolo
: gist, was appointed dean.
The definition of a mineral science
student, according to Dean Levor
sen, is "a person who attempts to
understand the earth and anything
that comes out of it."
SINCE LAST YEAR the school
has grown by leaps and bounds and
is now one of the nation's top-rank
ing mineral science schools. In the
number of geology graduates, Stan
ford's school is second only to Co
lumbia; and acording to one of its
! students:
'"It is tops in equipment and per
i sonncl and has a natural environ
ment that offers great possibilities
for observing what the textbooks try
to describe."
According to Dean Levorsen, about
half of the geology students go into
petroleum geology after graduation,
and I he rest go into teaching and
1 government service.
A SHOT IN THE ARM to the
school's growth were the gifts of
Farm alumni and friends amount
ing to over $125,000. Moreover, there
were collected under the school's
roof such leading men in the field
as Professor Siemon Muller, an ex
pert, in perma-frost and ice forma
tion on ricks, as well as Triassic
stratigraphy; Professor Arthur How
ard, who accompanied Admiral
Byrd to Antarctica; Professor Hugh
Schenck, who, under General Mac-
Arthur, headed the Japanese con
servation program; Professor Charles

Park, ior years a member of the
U.S. Geological Survey; Professor
Vertress VandcrHoof, who was on
the University of California-spon
sored geological expedition to Egypt
last year; Profcsfcor Emeritus Eliot
Blackwelder, authority on desert
conditions and research in sedimen
tation; and Professor Emeritus Bin
ley Willis, noted geologist, traveler,
; and author.
The latter two and Dean Levor
| sen are past presidents of the Geo
logical Society of America.
The entire $125,000 has already
been spent on modern equipment for
teaching and research purposes.
Now filling the school's four labora
tories—the mineral preparation, pe
; troleum production, naval research,
and physical metallurgy labs are all
sorts of new instruments, large and
small.
IMPRESSIVE is the physical met
allurgy lab's new $6,000 X-ray dif
. fraction machine, used for studying
i crystal structures in minerals, met
j als, and alloys. The machine sends
out X-ray beams which are affected
by the orderly arrangement of at
oms in the crystal, and the machine
thus registers the position of the
| atoms in the crystal.
Sulking in one corner of the me
chanical engineering shop (it was
too large to fit into the metallurgy
lab) is the new radiographic ma
chine, a gift of the Braun Corpora
tion. The machine, a 400.000 - volt
orange monster, sends X-ray beams
out through its mouth at castings
and welds to detect defects.
There is also the $2,000 Tukon
micro-hardness testing machine that
measures the hardness of minerals
and other hard substances. Its main
advantage is that it can measure the
hardness of a particular crystal too
small for the eye.
PART OF Tin: S:!2,000 naval re
search project is a complicated-look
ing rack - like machine, borrowed
from the Joshua Hendy Company of
Sunnyvale. It tests the effects of
different types of atmospheres at
elevated temperatures on metals.
The school is also trying to discover
the metals' properties in inert en
vironments and in vacuums. Even
tually the machine may be used to
test metals in combustion gases.
Looking like a hospital fever chart
is the instrument used for measur
ing and controlling temperatures of
metallurgical furnaces. It is a gray
box about two feet square with a
s.',lass window, behind which is spread
| a graph and pointer.
