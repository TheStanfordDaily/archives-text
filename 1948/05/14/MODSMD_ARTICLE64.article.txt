# First Woman to Direct Encina Hall Given OK
## 
### TONY LIEBIG 
One woman and 600 men live in
Encina Hall.
Encina alumni always are sur
prised when they hear of tine one
voman. "What woman could stand
'.? and "She'll soon crack under the

••train" are typical of their com
ments on hearing about Encina's su
pervisor, Mrs. Ellene Sumner.
Short, smiling, and friendly, Mrs.
Sumner is a remarkable person. The
\irst woman ever to live in Encina,
he has supervised there for five

quarters as director. And she shows
no sign of cracking either; she en
joys the job.
AS DIRECTOR it is Mrs. Sum
ner's job to make Encina a more
comfortable place for its COO fresh
man inhabitants.
In the last year and a half she has
gained the respect of everyone on
the campus as well as in Encina. She
works with student government, di
rects repair of frequent hall damage,
does book work, and advises the boys
on their personal problems.
Mrs. Sumner came to Stanford
during the autumn quarter of 1946.
Later in the same quarter she moved
into a suite of rooms on Encina's first
floor, brought in curtains and rugs,
had the walls painted pink. She
knows most of the building's fresh
men and wants to meet the rest.
ACCORDING TO HER, the first
few weeks in Encina were the hard
est. "I was very scared that I would
n't be accepted, but later when I
knew the boys liked me, it was all
right."
"I've only been hit by a waterbag
once," says Mrs. Sumner, "and I've
become almost impervious to the
rough language. I've had several
embarrassing moments but never
any trouble or insults. There is a
very friendly feeling in Encina and
I really like it."
Improvements that Mrs. Sumner
would like to see include hot water
in every room, several smaller
lounge rooms, a better recreation
room, more color in the halls and
bedrooms, and leakproof radiators.
