# What Next-Spring Look?
## Designer Creates Two Silhouettes 
### 
PARIS (UP). â€” Pierre Balmain,
one of Paris' top designers, has i
pulled two new silhouettes out of his
fashion bag for spring.
One, a gently wide silhouette, is
achieved by tiers, or "ripples" as he
likes to call them, short capes, and j
long, rather full peplums on suit !
jackets.
Nowhere is there a plethora of j
material. Pierre Balmain has just j
returned from America, and there |
he saw that women led too vigorous |
lives to put up with skirts 15 yards
wide.
The other, cut specially to hug I
the knees and hips, is called the ;
"half-bias" silhouette.
In coats, the slim shape took two j
trends, one a very thin redingote,
with tiny pleated godets in back.
The other, worn especially for eve- j
ning, was slim at the bottom, but |
had a wide collar which hung down
the back in a large fold.
Tailored suits were practical, with
fingertip jackets slightly flared,'
pinched-in waists, short revers, and
"too short" sleeves. The sleeves were
filled out to the wrist with pretty'
pleated organdy puffs, completed by j
a lace band around the waist.
Balmain added many feminine j
touches; for example, on a close- 1
fitting gabardine suit he added a I
pink satin bow at the waist. An
other very becoming idea was the
white blouse with the front covercd !
by a pastel chiffon gathered scarf.
Another suit skirt in gray gabar- j
dine had a skirt which buttoned up
with tiny black pearl buttons like a
sailor's pants.
Most interesting material used in i
the collection was dyed suede leath
er. Out of it Balmain fashioned two j
dresses, one with a pleated skirt, and !
a coat.
A suede dress in cinnamon had a '
large white pique collar and cuffs on !
the three-quarter length sleeves.
For colors, Balmain chose navy
and black, often combined, coral
white, beige, gray, and pale robin's
egg blue.
Most important trend in the col
lection, as far as future development
of styles is concerned, according to
experts, was his series of straight |
box jackets with straight skirts. !
They are directly opposed to the
pinched-in waist, hippy look of last
year.
The nicest gadget of the collection
was a special umbrella which i
matched some dress material, with '
a slit in the handle to carry gloves.
