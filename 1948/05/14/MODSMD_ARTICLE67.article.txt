# LIFE AMONG THE PRIMITIVES
## Early Author Recalls Exciting Farm Days 
### HERB SMITH 
Opposition to Daily editors is noth
\ig new at Stanford. During the
jiirly 1900's an editor expressed the
,ope that Mrs. Stanford's rather cor
pulent brother, Charlie Lathrop,
, . would fall down and teeter
o death. Even the faculty missed
,'iat promising youth when he had
0 pack up and say good-bye."
This and many other anecdotes
ire contained in Robert Duffus'
nemoir of his undergraduate days
1 Stanford, "Innocents at Cedro."
The Honor Code definitely was not
i part of Stanford life at that time.
\ was fair sport to beat a lockout,
•id even President David Starr Jor
:lan played the game. One evening
ie heard a young girl crying under
v Ruble window. After determining
Hat the girl was locked out and was
ifraid of the discipline of the house
mother. President Jordan boosted
lie girl through the window. Evi
'ontly he considered it a deed well
lone.
Weekend behavior was slightly
lilVercnt from present-day beha
vior. Duffus says, "Stanford un
dergraduates liked to lean an el
,'iiiw on the bar of the Palace Ho
tel and admire Maxfield Parrish's
big picture" (undoubtedly it was

a nude; "or would boast; with more
or less reason, of running along
j Pacific Street with two dollars in
j their lists and spending the two
dollars in manly sin."
DufTus mentions the dress of
Stanford men. He says that the en
gineering and a few other students
wore what was called a semester
shirt. Of blue flannel, these shirts
were worn four months without
washing. This undoubtedly resulted
in quite a saving on laundry; but
J one wonders if there was much so
cial intercourse between those who
i changed their shirts and those who
j wore semester shirts.
Evidently Encina Commons was
not functioning in Duifus' day or
the cuisine wasn't equal to its
present-day inimitable excellence,
DulTus v>ays, "I knew some young
men who lived in Encina Ilall,
subsisting for prolonged periods on
nuts, dales, figs, and other un
! cooked foods,
"At Stanford in those days some
j people would try almost anything
| once. I wonder if this is the case
! today."
In reply to this implied question
this reviewer wishes to state that the
spirit of adventure is practically dead
on the Farm—at least as far as the
women are concerned.
