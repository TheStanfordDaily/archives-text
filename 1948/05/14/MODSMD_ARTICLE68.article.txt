# Laboratory Develops Earthquakes for Study
## 
### TONY LIEBIG 
The Vibration Laboratory is just
another lab in that long sandstone
chain of laboratories between the
Quad and the Union. It was opened
20 years ago for the purpose of de
termining the effects of earthquakes
on buildings, bridges, and dams.
Research done by engineers in the
Vibration Lab has aided architects
in designing more earthquake-re
sistant buildings.
The most interesting and famous
earthquake-maker in the lab is the
shaking table. Designed and devel
oped by Stanford Professor Lydik
Jacobsen, the shaking table has been
used for testing models of San
Francisco skyscrapers, dams, and
other structures.
EFFECTS of shaking table tests
on structural models have been re
corded and worked into mathemati
cal relationships. In several cases,
unknown structural defects have
been detected by the tests and rec
ommendations made for improve
ments.
The shaking table is a large, bat

tleship gray machine which look
like something out of '"Supermar
comics. But it is only a simp,
piece of machinery. The table pa
of it consists of a four-ton, 10 x 1?
foot steel platform mounted on fou
streetcar wheels. It is anchored
a concrete pier by powerful sprint
The shaker is a 1.000-pound per
dulum which swings from the rue
of the lab, 20 feet above the tabl
To set the table into vibration, th
pendulum is pulled back, release-j
and allowed to strike a bumpe
spring on the table. The vibratio;
caused by the impact are similar i
general character to those of
earthquake.
THE SHAKING TABLE cann
reproduce specific quakes. Oth->
machines do that. Although
table's quake is only a general lir
ear tremor—the simplest type <,
earthquake—its vibrations are rei
istic enough for very accurate r*
search.
A good example of the type o
work done on the shaking tab
was the experiment done on a mod.
of a 16-story office building in ti
financial district of San Francisc.
By means of gauge readings i,
pictures taken during the teit. en
gineers weie able to calculate tx
actly what would happen to th
building during an earthquake.
The work of Professor Jacob/e
has been important in the field c
earthquake research for mar
years. He has written several ar
tides and booklets on his work wit.
the shaking table, and at present 1
is directing a vibration reseuiv
program for the Navy.
