# Farm Foot Styles Feature Sandals
## 
### 
Even the Stanford maiden hasn't
forgotten her footwear in the rush
of spring fashions. For the beach,
that picnic, or even Quad wear, wo
ven sandals copied after the South
Seas with matching shoulder hand
bags have become increasingly pop
ular.
Gold-thonged sandals are the style
footnote of the season, to be worn
with billowing formals or the sim
plest tailored cotton. For the City,
the maiden will wear the closed
toe black suede opera pumps cre
ated last year for the new look, or
sling-heeled patent leather pumps
with disguised platform heels for her
dressy print.
