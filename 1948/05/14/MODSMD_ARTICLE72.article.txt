# Friday Morning-Around Quad
## Campus Blooms In Crisp Cottons 
### BY JACQUI ATKIN 
After wearing heavy wool skirts, sweaters,
and suits for months, topped by raincoats,
Stanford women can finally blossom out in
their newest cotton creations. On Quad the
styles vary as always, but the New Look
predominates both in length and mode. The
corect 14 inches above the floor, prescribed
by our French connoisseurs, is very strictly
observed, even if it necessitates sewing on a
five-inch ruffle, piece of eyelet, or an old
horse blanket.
Ballerina styles seem to be the most evident
instead of the full dirndl type, so popular for
years. The only trouble with this innovation
is that very little in the way of curves in the
wrong places can be concealed, despite the
claims of the fashion editors that they hide
"anything and everything."
Then there are the different styles. On
campus, anything from a very elaborate dress,
complete with eyelet, ruffles, ribbon, Japanese
brocade, courtesy of an ex-navy brother, to a
simple skirt and blouse ensemble can be seen.
THE FORMER TYPE usually involves a
round, sguare, or scooped-out type of neckline.
It may be gathered, topped off with an elab
orate collar, or plainly bound. One fascinating
little job seemed to have bunches of straw
berries clustered cozily around it. Another
popular type of neckline is the off-the-shoulder
variety. Obviously highly popular with the
males, they are especially attractive when
viewed over a deep and even tan. Of course,
when they reveal heavily blistered, red and
peeling shoulders, they are not really excep
tionally pretty.
THE OTHER EXTREME in blouses is the Gib
son Girl kind. Covering the fair wearer from
close under her chin to her wrists, they are
supposedly very demure, feminine, and chic.
They look marvelous on the doll-like type of
girl, or even the tall sophisticate, but when
the angular mannish gals start bursting out in
frills and ruffles, it really looks guite incon
gruous.

The cotton dresses are being worn this
year in every situation, but on Quad they
range all the way from long, flowing ice
cream colored creations, to the tight, strained
looking ensembles, left over from last year.
One of the newer styles is having one's skirt
and shoes matching. California styles have
always been famous for their ingenuity and
versatility, but this innovation is nothing but
highly original.
One very flattering dress had the off-the
shoulder line, with a long tiered skirt, com
posed of a candy stripe material, originating
in Southern California. A few of the unusual
materials seem to date either from our great
Aunt Hattie's attic, or from a few old Guate
malan looms. Beach awnings also seem to be
guite the thing, especially in the sun-back
dresses with matching jackets.
SLEEVES SEEM to be receiving their share
of attention. They range anywhere from being
not there at all, through the cap, bracelet
length, and long, to the voluminous balloon
like sleeves of the old Spanish buccaneer.
The only trouble with this latter variety seems
to be their affinity for landing in one's mashed
potatoes when reaching for the salt.
