# Saturday Afternoon-City Shopping
## Tailored Suits Meet Varied Situations 
### BY CARYL HARMS 
Off to the city for an afternoon of shopping?
Then you'll probably choose a casual suit
as the best outfit to meet all situations —to
take you to lunch, to withstand all kinds of
weather, and to stay looking fresh clear
through to the end of a tiring expedition.
You can always count on that stand-by, the
classical tailored suit. As a concession to new
styles, many of them are appearing with a
full swing skirt this year, but the man-tailored
jacket, perhaps with a smartly saddle-stitched
collar and pockets, is still present.
WITH INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS, a favor
ite suit is that which features a circular skirt
and a waist-in, round-hipped jacket. Some
styles have the familiar V-neck with a pointed
collar, while others have a high rounded collar;
materials range from English tweed to light
gabardine.
If you're looking for something different,
one suit we saw combines a plain skirt of
medium fullness with a boxy check jacket.
The distinctive note —a plain, almost invisible
closing in front and a row of buttons down
the back of the jacket. For a little dressier
touch, we suggest a Basgue suit with a prim
peplum and a full skirt, all in gem-cOlored
frise wool.
ANOTHER SUIT that may easily become a
classical style itself, for it has attained im
mense popularity in the last year or so, has
a boxy little jacket with a long straight skirt.
An. interesting variation on this idea is the
combination of an all-wool gabardine brief
coat, in brilliant coach red, with a slim skirt
in navy.
A touch of spring is apparent in one new
suit, where white pigue makes the tiny Peter
Pan collar and trims the pockets. Wear it in
cobalt blue with white or dark accessories and
be ready for June days.
