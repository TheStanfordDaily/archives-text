# Saturday Night—Spring Formal
## Coeds Will Dance In Bouffant Gowns 
### BY DEBBY WELLES 
With spring in the air and summer breezes
just around the corner, it's time for a change
into something lighter and softer in the way
of danceable formals.
Spring is bringing in something more than
the usual run of fashions in the way of fluff
and lace this year. Feminism is becoming as
vital as it was in the days of Susan B. Anthony.
RECENT TRENDS show evening wear mov
ing up and down. On top the trend is definitely
downwards. Practically everything new is
either completely strapless, so far off the
shoulder that it might as well be, or bedecked
with such thin wisps of straps that they are
hardly visible to the naked eye and do little
more than bolster the morale of perennial wor
riers. Sleeves seem to be on the way out
from any angle except the veiy minutest of
them.
On the bottom, formals are coming up rap
idly, so that they will meet the ever-length
ening casual skirts. The new ballerina length
measures about seven inches from the floor.
It comes in skirts and low-cut blouses as well
as in sleek drapes and startling colors.
SPRING IS BRINGING with it the ensemble
to match the slippers that suddenly became
the tops in style over the winter. Gold is the
color of 1948. Taffeta, especially in ballerina
length, rustles and glitters, while near-gold
shades in other materials range even to soft
nylon net, this year's replacement to last
year's similar styles in marguisette.
Plaids are ever and ever more popular, com
ing in taffeta and cottons and in various un
usual colors, often with pink and chartreuse.
IN MATERIALS, this year is bringing again
the flimsy type of gown in all shades of the
pastel rainbow. Dresses are cut low and skirts
are in the seemingly perennial layers, with
crinoline under taffeta under the new nylon
net. Different and interesting in this line are

formals of plaid in bright colors covered with
a layer of nylon in a more subdued shade.
If rustles drown out the noise of the orches
tra at the coming dances, it will be because
taffeta is the material of the hour. When it
isn't visible, it will be vital in the less men
tionable portion of the feminine wardrobe. In
many cases, petticoats come attached; if not,
you should supply your own and rustle with
the rest. Even the more sophisticated gowns
this year are full skirted instead of tight, and
many of them are in this material.
ANOTHER POPULAR material is waffle
pigue, perky as ever, and coming in prints as
well as block colors.
And for the impatient girl who's tired of
being lacy, yet doesn't feel guite up to the
price tag attached to the glittering gold, there
is the year's innovation: the formal, light blue
with white eyelet, strapless with a brief bolero
jacket for those walks in the moonlight made
of casual denim.

many cases, petticoats come attached; if not,
you should supply your own and rustle with
the rest. Even the more sophisticated gowns
this year are full skirted instead of tight, and
many of them are in this material.

with white eyelet, strapless with a brief bolero
jacket for those walks in the moonlight made
of casual denim.

With spring in the air and summer breezes
just around the corner, it's time for a change
into something lighter and softer in the way
of danceable formals.
Spring is bringing in something more than
the usual run of fashions in the way of fluff
and lace this year. Feminism is becoming as
vital as it was in the days of Susan B. Anthony.
RECENT TRENDS show evening wear mov
ing up and down. On top the trend is definitely
downwards. Practically everything new is
either completely strapless, so far off the
shoulder that it might as well be, or bedecked
with such thin wisps of straps that they are
hardly visible to the naked eye and do little
more than bolster the morale of perennial wor
riers. Sleeves seem to be on the way out
from any angle except the veiy minutest of
them.
On the bottom, formals are coming up rap
idly, so that they will meet the ever-length
ening casual skirts. The new ballerina length
measures about seven inches from the floor.
It comes in skirts and low-cut blouses as well
as in sleek drapes and startling colors.
SPRING IS BRINGING with it the ensemble
to match the slippers that suddenly became
the tops in style over the winter. Gold is the
color of 1948. Taffeta, especially in ballerina
length, rustles and glitters, while near-gold
shades in other materials range even to soft
nylon net, this year's replacement to last
year's similar styles in marguisette.
Plaids are ever and ever more popular, com
ing in taffeta and cottons and in various un
usual colors, often with pink and chartreuse.
IN MATERIALS, this year is bringing again
the flimsy type of gown in all shades of the
pastel rainbow. Dresses are cut low and skirts
are in the seemingly perennial layers, with
crinoline under taffeta under the new nylon
net. Different and interesting in this line are

formals of plaid in bright colors covered with
a layer of nylon in a more subdued shade.
If rustles drown out the noise of the orches
tra at the coming dances, it will be because
taffeta is the material of the hour. When it
isn't visible, it will be vital in the less men
tionable portion of the feminine wardrobe. In
many cases, petticoats come attached; if not,
you should supply your own and rustle with
the rest. Even the more sophisticated gowns
