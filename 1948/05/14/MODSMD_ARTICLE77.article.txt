# Sunday Morningâ€”Off to Church
## Suits, Prints Highlight the Day 
### BY DEE KEATLEY 
Stanford girls like to dress up just like any
other girls and one place on campus to show
off new spring outfits is at church. The usual
attire for this Sunday morning pastime is a
dressy suit or a dressy coat worn over a light
dress.
This year, the majority of dressy suits on
the Farm consist of a short fitted jacket, flared
at the waist, and a circular or somewhat full
skirt. Dressy coats are either short with full
swinging backs or long and fitted. Popular
materials are gabardine, faille, and sharkskin.
NAVY SEEMS to be one of the most popular
spring colors as usual, since it can be dressed
up so nicely with a fresh white blouse or a
pastel scarf. Other colors are beige, black,
brown, grey, blue, and green, all of which car
be perked up with a new spring hat.
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT dressy suit is of
salmon rayon sharkskin with a circular skirt
and short fitted jacket with covered buttons.
It can be worn with black or white accessories.
The tie-silk print suit is an unusual ensemble.
One of a print of small yellow circles on a
brown background looks very "Chinesey"
with its full skirt, short fitted jacket with a
peplum, three-quarter length sleeves, slit
pockets on either side of the top, and a round
collar.
DEVIATING SOMEWHAT FROM the pat
tern is an attractive navy gabardine outfit con
sisting of a gored skirt, print blouse, and a
bolero lined with the print of the blouse. The
sleeves are three-quarter length. The suit also
has a matching long fitted coat with padded
hips, flap pockets, a gored back, slit sleeves,
and gold buttons.

Stanford woman doesn't think about the Sunday
she'll he walking down the aisle in a white satin
wedding gown such as the one on the right froip
D'ANGELO'S modeled by BARBARA ALLEN? The
gown is fashioned with a bertha collar trimmed with
seed pearls. The peplum sweeps into a train and the
tulle veil is trimmed with lace. Bridesmaid JO
TRAUTMAN wears an aqua marquisette dress with
a sheer yoke. The litte flower girl wears white satin.

Since going to church inevitably leads to
weddings, especially true in the spring and
summer, many thoughts are turning to the
latest fashions in wedding gowns. Pigue and
dotted nylons are two new fabrics, in addition
to the usual lace and satin. The new look is
found in back bustles, ful sleeves, and pinched
in waists; though most of the old charm of
the long, white wedding gown is retained.
