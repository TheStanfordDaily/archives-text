## Fashion History Presents Contrasts 
### BY JANE McKEE 
The fashions worn by the Stanford coed
since 1900 have presented some interesting
contrasts. There are, however, similarities be
tween certain periods as to necklines, skirt
lengths, and use of trimming details. Styles
are noted for being cyclical!
In 1900 the bell silhouette was popular;
skirts were all long and full, waists tiny.
Highnecked blouses and long sleeves were
usual for everyday wear and white was a popu
lar color.

THE EARLY TWENTIES brought a fad for
ties of all descriptions worn with informal
clothes; there were bow ties, long ribbon ties,
even men's ties. (This trend was noticed again
in the fall of '47 on the Stanford campus, and
kerchiefs used in this fashion added even
larger color splashes.)
By 1930 skirt lengths were up to just below
the knees, and waistlines were almost natural
again. Sweaters and skirts were usual Quad
wear, while more formal clothes were often
designed with skirt-tiers and flounces. Tiered
skirts made their reappearance in this year's
styles.
SKIRT LENGTHS in the middle '30s were
similar to those seen now, and longer than
those of 1930. Popular styles for the classroom
were one-piece sport dresses, or straight, nar
row skirts worn with blouses.


One of Stanford's favorite play spots—
Adobe Creek—with four of Stanford's pop
ular maidens. The double exposure rest
ing on the bridge is the WADSWORTH
twins. CHARLOTTE is wearing aqua
striped pedal pushers with a matching hat
of the same material, while sister CARO
LINE waits for the sun in cotton striped
shorts and bra. Both outfits may be seen
at ROOS BROTHERS. Perched on the
rocks in the upper left corner is SUE EL
WOOI). attired in a red polka-dot bra and
blue denim shorts from JOSEPH IVIAONIN.
CHAR PYLES, right, takes her tan in a
Mabs swim suit and a red and white Ha
waiian beach coat with matching shoes.

The fashions worn by the Stanford coed
since 1900 have presented some interesting
contrasts. There are, however, similarities be
tween certain periods as to necklines, skirt
lengths, and use of trimming details. Styles
are noted for being cyclical!
In 1900 the bell silhouette was popular;
skirts were all long and full, waists tiny.
Highnecked blouses and long sleeves were
usual for everyday wear and white was a popu
lar color.

THE EARLY TWENTIES brought a fad for
ties of all descriptions worn with informal
clothes; there were bow ties, long ribbon ties,
even men's ties. (This trend was noticed again
in the fall of '47 on the Stanford campus, and
kerchiefs used in this fashion added even
larger color splashes.)
By 1930 skirt lengths were up to just below
the knees, and waistlines were almost natural
again. Sweaters and skirts were usual Quad
wear, while more formal clothes were often
designed with skirt-tiers and flounces. Tiered
skirts made their reappearance in this year's
styles.
SKIRT LENGTHS in the middle '30s were
similar to those seen now, and longer than
those of 1930. Popular styles for the classroom
were one-piece sport dresses, or straight, nar
row skirts worn with blouses.
