# Stanford Troops to Beach in Simple Swim Suits, Play Togs
## 
### BY JACKIE MILNOR 
It's spring quarter, and come the warm, lazy
days, Stanfordites will inevitably troop to the
beach.
For those who go in for swimming in a
serious way, the traditional one or two-piece
Mabs bathing suits are tops. There's nothing
fancy about these suits, their beauty comes
from their cut, and their superb fit. They
come in all colors, including black and white.
BUT SOME GO to the beach and never go
near the water. For them the beach means
tanning and games on the sand. These select
bathing suits for looks and comfort. Paly
stores are showing a strapless dressmaker suit
in a black and white pique prine that is just
right.
Our vote for the best looking and most
practical outfit shown is the three-piece cor

duroy bathing suit and matching sun dress.
This outfit can be worn everywhere—the bra
and shorts in swimming, the shorts and a tee
shirt or blouse for hikes and bike rides in the
hills in back of Stanford- and the sun dress to
Adobe or the boardwalk at Santa Cruz. They
come only in pastel colors and white.
PRACTICALLY ESSENTIAL IN every spring
wardrobe is a pair of clam diggers or pedal
pushers. (If you're interested, pedal pushers
come just a little above the knee, clam diggers
just a little below.) You can just about take
your pick of materials and colors—-cotton
gabardine, wool, and the ever-present cor
duroy in all colors from navy blue to white,
including bright reds and greens. Clam dig
gers teamed with blouses or short jackets are
perfect for those cold, evening wienie bakes
and for long bike rides.

Not necessary, but a lot of fun to wear, are
bright beach coats that completely cover
your bathing suit. One of the best looking was
an over-all mandarin jacket in bright blue
denim, buttoned right up to the high collar,
with big patch pockets.
HOLLYWOOD FAN magazines tell us that
the latest fad of the stars is bathing suits in
that bright material that can be seen for miles.
Paly is showing these, too, and if you're the
daring type, buy one, and your fellow will
be able to keep an eye on your whereabouts.
Well, you've got your bathing suit now, the
sun is shining, and the beach awaits. See
you there!

Beach waistliners are now being made to
keep figures in line in bathing suits.


The smiling miss soaking up (lit' Adobe Creek sunshine is ANN MrILKEE in a
Catalina swim suit with a matching T-shirt. It's from KOOS BROTHERS.


The life of a horse has its better moments, especially if he can pick a rider like ALLY
AITKEN. For the occasion Ally wisely chose a red plaid shirt and blue jeans from
PENNEY'S.


KITH NYSWANDER picked this six-in-one cos
tume for her weekend jaunt to Carmel. This white
linen weekend wardrobe contains shirt, jacket, halter,
shorts, slacks, and sa*h. The outfit is featured at
HINK'S.


She swims at Adobe in satin—it's an ice blue satin suit from JOSEPH
MAGNIN. Our blonde swimmer is DIANE WASSON.


KAY LLOYD is silting pretty in JOSEPH MAG
NIN'S blue denim sun dress with red polka dots.
Match it with a bag and hat.

She swims at Adobe in satin—it's an ice blue satin suit from JOSEPH
MAGNIN. Our blonde swimmer is DIANE WASSON.


KAY LLOYD is silting pretty in JOSEPH MAG
NIN'S blue denim sun dress with red polka dots.
Match it with a bag and hat.
It's spring quarter, and come the warm, lazy
days, Stanfordites will inevitably troop to the
beach.
For those who go in for swimming in a
serious way, the traditional one or two-piece
Mabs bathing suits are tops. There's nothing
fancy about these suits, their beauty comes
from their cut, and their superb fit. They
come in all colors, including black and white.
BUT SOME GO to the beach and never go
near the water. For them the beach means
tanning and games on the sand. These select
bathing suits for looks and comfort. Paly
stores are showing a strapless dressmaker suit
in a black and white pique prine that is just
right.
Our vote for the best looking and most
practical outfit shown is the three-piece cor

duroy bathing suit and matching sun dress.
This outfit can be worn everywhere—the bra
and shorts in swimming, the shorts and a tee
shirt or blouse for hikes and bike rides in the
hills in back of Stanford- and the sun dress to
Adobe or the boardwalk at Santa Cruz. They
come only in pastel colors and white.
PRACTICALLY ESSENTIAL IN every spring
wardrobe is a pair of clam diggers or pedal
pushers. (If you're interested, pedal pushers
come just a little above the knee, clam diggers
just a little below.) You can just about take
your pick of materials and colors—-cotton
gabardine, wool, and the ever-present cor
duroy in all colors from navy blue to white,
including bright reds and greens. Clam dig
gers teamed with blouses or short jackets are
perfect for those cold, evening wienie bakes
and for long bike rides.

Not necessary, but a lot of fun to wear, are
bright beach coats that completely cover
your bathing suit. One of the best looking was
an over-all mandarin jacket in bright blue
denim, buttoned right up to the high collar,
with big patch pockets.
HOLLYWOOD FAN magazines tell us that
the latest fad of the stars is bathing suits in
that bright material that can be seen for miles.
Paly is showing these, too, and if you're the
daring type, buy one, and your fellow will
be able to keep an eye on your whereabouts.
Well, you've got your bathing suit now, the
sun is shining, and the beach awaits. See
you there!

Beach waistliners are now being made to
keep figures in line in bathing suits.


The smiling miss soaking up (lit' Adobe Creek sunshine is ANN MrILKEE in a
Catalina swim suit with a matching T-shirt. It's from KOOS BROTHERS.


The life of a horse has its better moments, especially if he can pick a rider like ALLY
AITKEN. For the occasion Ally wisely chose a red plaid shirt and blue jeans from
PENNEY'S.


KITH NYSWANDER picked this six-in-one cos
tume for her weekend jaunt to Carmel. This white
linen weekend wardrobe contains shirt, jacket, halter,
shorts, slacks, and sa*h. The outfit is featured at
HINK'S.
