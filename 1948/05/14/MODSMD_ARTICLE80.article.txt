# Sunday Night—Early to Bed
## Briefer Nightwear for Spring Weather 
### BY MARGIE SAMPSON 
Bedtime styles are changing to follow the
new look, along with everything else. Paja
mas are getting shorter, and so are night
gowns. The short tommy coat is popular on
a warm night—just short pj's designed for
coolness.
Light, cotton nightgowns, full, cut to the
knees, and trimmed with lace are growing
more popular as spring wears on. They are
the warm-weather version of the full-length,
long-sleeved, high-necked flannel nightgown
worn on cold winter nights.
Ballerina length nightgowns are also popu
lar. They are often of very light-weight ma
terial, with an extremely full skirt.
OF COURSE THE OLD stand-bys are the
deafening men's pajamas. Usually on the
large side, the pj's are designed to keep those
people awake who sleep too much. In other
words, they are loud. Bright splash prints and
startling Dalian designs are the favorites with
the women.
Following this style somewhat is the milder
butcher boy pajamas. These are designed for
those with insomnia, and are usually made in
pastel colors They have a loose, comfortable,
long box jacket.

OF ALL THE pajama styles followed by
Stanford women, the ones just mentioned seem
to be the most popular.
Some prefer midriff pajamas, but the weather
will have to get a little warmer before they
become consistently popular.
But the women on the campus still go back
to the ever-popular bright-colored pjs. They
are the old stand-bys—the easiest to wear
and always in style.

Silk scarves, so popular around Stanford,
are very versatile. They may be used as
blouses, belts, around the neck, and as hats,
as well as in many other forms.

Long strands of pearls, such as your grand
mother may have worn, are in style this year

The latest daring bathing suit style includes
a backless, strapless, two-piece bathing suit.

The keynote for make-up this year is shift
ing to the pale pink of a feminine blush.

Catching a bit of the skirt hem with a ribbon
is a popular means of showing the design on
the new organdy and taffeta petticoats.

OF ALL THE pajama styles followed by
Stanford women, the ones just mentioned seem
to be the most popular.
Some prefer midriff pajamas, but the weather
will have to get a little warmer before they
become consistently popular.
But the women on the campus still go back
to the ever-popular bright-colored pjs. They
are the old stand-bys—the easiest to wear
and always in style.

Silk scarves, so popular around Stanford,
are very versatile. They may be used as
blouses, belts, around the neck, and as hats,
as well as in many other forms.

Long strands of pearls, such as your grand
mother may have worn, are in style this year

The latest daring bathing suit style includes
a backless, strapless, two-piece bathing suit.

The keynote for make-up this year is shift
ing to the pale pink of a feminine blush.

Catching a bit of the skirt hem with a ribbon
is a popular means of showing the design on
the new organdy and taffeta petticoats.

Bedtime styles are changing to follow the
new look, along with everything else. Paja
mas are getting shorter, and so are night
gowns. The short tommy coat is popular on
a warm night—just short pj's designed for
coolness.
Light, cotton nightgowns, full, cut to the
knees, and trimmed with lace are growing
more popular as spring wears on. They are
the warm-weather version of the full-length,
long-sleeved, high-necked flannel nightgown
worn on cold winter nights.
Ballerina length nightgowns are also popu
lar. They are often of very light-weight ma
terial, with an extremely full skirt.
OF COURSE THE OLD stand-bys are the
deafening men's pajamas. Usually on the
large side, the pj's are designed to keep those
people awake who sleep too much. In other
words, they are loud. Bright splash prints and
startling Dalian designs are the favorites with
the women.
Following this style somewhat is the milder
butcher boy pajamas. These are designed for
those with insomnia, and are usually made in
pastel colors They have a loose, comfortable,
long box jacket.
