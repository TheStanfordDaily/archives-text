# The 						Male Picture
## Men Complain 
### BY MARY KRAFT 
Peasant blouses will be the most popular
fashion on the Quad this spring if women
really care what men think about their clothes
or so a survey of Stanford men reveals.
Spring clothes won a big vote of approval,
but the men said that coeds in general "don't
look neat enough."
However, most of the men polled stated
that they had by now become accustomed to
the "new look." "Women look much more
feminine in the new styles" was the consensus.
WHEN ASKED IF they liked girls to wear
stockings to classes, many said "Yes, they look
much smoother." But one Row man stated
that he had the 30 votes of his house sguarely
behind bobby socks.
Stanford men were a little vague when
questioned about the new lacy petticoats
which show below skirts. "I hear they're com
ing in," one said hesitatingly; while another
replied emphatically, "I think they're silly."
BALLERINA-LENGTH formals received a
vote of approval from most of the men inter
viewed, although one rough qualified his an
swer by stating, "It depends on what kind of
ankles the girl has." and another said bluntly,
"I think they stink!"
"Full skirts look like flour sacks" was a reply
received to the question, "Do you like straight
or full skirts better?" The majority of those
polled voted for tight skirts, although a few
said they thought the flared looked "dressier."
