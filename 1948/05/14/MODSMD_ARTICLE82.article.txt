# Only Minor Changes Seen in Rough's Wear This Spring
## 
### 
New Look or no, men's apparel for this
spring, and especially at Stanford this spring,
shows litle change from previous years. In
spite of various attempts on the parts of cloth
ing manufacturers to push new ideas and in
novations, the Stanford man wears what he
likes and not what he is told he should wear.
There are a few minor changes worthy of
mention that are being seen around Quad and
the local spots. The most noticeable change
in sport-coats and suits is the addition of the
vent —sometimes a single vent at the bottom
of the back seam or often two vents at the two
side seams. These vents permit more comfort
and less coat-wrinkling when sitting down.
The new sguare wool tie, which has recently

been introduced in some of the local stores,
should become a popular favorite. It is the
first time a tie of woven wool fabric has been
made in this shape, and the tie comes in a
variety of stripes, plaids, and small checks
very good looking and inexpensive, too.
LATEST CHANGE in men's shoes is the re
turn of pre-war crepe soles. These are ex
tremely practical and are featured on all popu
lar shoe styles.
The open-neck shirt, the V-neck sweater
(preferably cashmere) and the solid-color
slacks, plus loafers or saddles, continue to
make up the most popular uniform on Quad.
Fewer reminders of military life are seen these
days, as most of the left-over grays and khakis

have worn out by now. Levis still rate high
when cleaning bills for slacks become too
much for the government check to cover.
AS FOR SHIRTS, the wide-spread collared
ones, spaced to accommodate the Windsor
knot, are first in popularity. Short-tip collars
with stays to hold them in place continue to be
popular, too. And of course solid- colored or
striped shirts still play second fiddle to the
white ones, which go everywhere from Quad
to the formals.
So, taking into account a few minor changes,
by and large the Stanford man looks about
the same now as he did last Spring.

gabardine slacks and the popular regimental stripe
tie featured at PHELPS-TERKEL

Definitely right for those spring formats is this

much for the government check to cover.
AS FOR SHIRTS, the wide-spread collared
ones, spaced to accommodate the Windsor
knot, are first in popularity. Short-tip collars
with stays to hold them in place continue to be
popular, too. And of course solid- colored or
striped shirts still play second fiddle to the
white ones, which go everywhere from Quad
to the formals.
So, taking into account a few minor changes,
by and large the Stanford man looks about
the same now as he did last Spring.


For an informal date, TED SHERIDAN sports a
herringbone English tweed jacket with contrasting
gabardine slacks and the popular regimental stripe
tie featured at PHELPS-TERKEL


City-bound 808 COHEN chooses a custom-made double
breasted sharkskin suit, tailored by KKO(<lI & POHLMAN.


Definitely right for those spring formats is this
oyster-colored dinner jacket with the popular shawl
collar modeled hy PHIL DORM AN. The jacket is
from JOHN BROOKE'S.
New Look or no, men's apparel for this
spring, and especially at Stanford this spring,
shows litle change from previous years. In
spite of various attempts on the parts of cloth
ing manufacturers to push new ideas and in
novations, the Stanford man wears what he
likes and not what he is told he should wear.
There are a few minor changes worthy of
mention that are being seen around Quad and
the local spots. The most noticeable change
in sport-coats and suits is the addition of the
vent —sometimes a single vent at the bottom
of the back seam or often two vents at the two
side seams. These vents permit more comfort
and less coat-wrinkling when sitting down.
The new sguare wool tie, which has recently

been introduced in some of the local stores,
should become a popular favorite. It is the
first time a tie of woven wool fabric has been
made in this shape, and the tie comes in a
variety of stripes, plaids, and small checks
very good looking and inexpensive, too.
LATEST CHANGE in men's shoes is the re
turn of pre-war crepe soles. These are ex
tremely practical and are featured on all popu
lar shoe styles.
The open-neck shirt, the V-neck sweater
(preferably cashmere) and the solid-color
slacks, plus loafers or saddles, continue to
make up the most popular uniform on Quad.
Fewer reminders of military life are seen these
days, as most of the left-over grays and khakis

have worn out by now. Levis still rate high
when cleaning bills for slacks become too
much for the government check to cover.
