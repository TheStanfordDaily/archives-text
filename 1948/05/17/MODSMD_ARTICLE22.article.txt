# Lasuen Excavations Exhume Old Roadbed
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
With every spadeful of Farm dirt
upturned behind the Bookstore, a
memory of the "Toonervilie Trol
ley" is brought up in the minds of
many alumni. In the ditch running
across Lasuen Street lies the old
roadbed of the Peninsular Railway
Co.
Ever since the trolley cars disap
peared from their regular tours
around the campus circuit in 1930,
Farm roughs have missed the thrill
of swarming in front of the rickety
cars and pestering the helpless mo
tor men.
One of these trolleymen, William
Jorv. still recalls some of the pranks
which "acquainted" him with Stan
ford students. "They used to use
brushes and buckets of soap to
urease the rails near Encina. When
I d try and stop there, I sometimes
wouldn't stop the old wreck until I
had skidded all the \\>ay to the
power house."
STUDENTS OFTEN JUMPED on
the cow-catcher or on top of the
trolley to receive free rides. II they
wanted to stop a'ong the way. seme
me on the back would reach up
tnd pull the rusty trolley pole from

Jory said. "The kids would also
•ing the fares up by pulling a rope
in the rear. We finally had to put
:wo men on the trolley to keep the
recounts straight. Around Big
Game time, we used three men to
keep order."
Fred Frehc. a policeman during
'he trolley era. recalled the trouble
the trolleymen encountered. "On j
April Fool's Day the students put |
ltige sandstones on the tracks. Then ;
they would tie ropes between the !
,i*ees to knock the trolley off the
wires."
JAKE IUWIX. manager of the
.:ym store and a student himself in \
the '20's, tells about the old line. !
When he first came to college he >
was told to take the "Toonervilie

Trolley" to the end of the line. "It
went about three miles an hour and
passed through a sort of jungle of
eucalyptus trees, but I eventually
got there."
He remembered how some of the
fellows brought s,irls to the campus
for a dance. Someone would soap
the tracks, and the y'irls would have
to "hoof it" out to the Farm.
Torpedoes which fellows pocketed
from the Santa Fe trains also tried
the patience of the frustrated mo
tormen. It was a fortunate trolley
man who didn't experience a slip
pery track, a torpedo explosion, or
a derailed trolley pole while he cir
cled the campus route in his popular
little red car.


WILLIAM ROHNER awaits passengers on what used to he the Farm's
most popular means of transportation. The little red trolley ran the

One of these trolleymen, William
Jorv. still recalls some of the pranks
which "acquainted" him with Stan

brushes and buckets of soap to
urease the rails near Encina. When
I d try and stop there, I sometimes
wouldn't stop the old wreck until I
had skidded all the \\>ay to the

Fred Frehc. a policeman during

the trolleymen encountered. "On j
April Fool's Day the students put |

was told to take the "Toonervilie

Trolley" to the end of the line. "It
went about three miles an hour and
passed through a sort of jungle of
eucalyptus trees, but I eventually

He remembered how some of the
fellows brought s,irls to the campus
for a dance. Someone would soap
the tracks, and the y'irls would have
to "hoof it" out to the Farm.
Torpedoes which fellows pocketed
from the Santa Fe trains also tried
the patience of the frustrated mo
tormen. It was a fortunate trolley
man who didn't experience a slip
pery track, a torpedo explosion, or
a derailed trolley pole while he cir
cled the campus route in his popular
little red car.

most popular means of transportation. The little red trolley ran the

With every spadeful of Farm dirt

Ever since the trolley cars disap
