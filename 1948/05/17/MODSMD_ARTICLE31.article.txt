## Voting Machines 
### 
The answer for more accurate vote tabulation in future ASSU
euections appears simple—voting machines.
Such machines would automatically total all votes, eliminating
the margin for mistake and numerous recounts. Charges of
stuffing ballot boxes and such political misdeals would be les
sened.
Although the idea of installing voting machines has un
questionable value theoretically, Stanford's acceptance of the
machines must be tempered by two considerations—cost and
practicability.
Such machines would have to be borrowed from San Fran
cisco, San Mateo, or Santa Clara County for each of the two ASSU
elections. San Francisco quoted Election Board a price of S2O
lor each machine borrowed; approximately 10 machines would
be needed to avoid congestion at the polls. This $400 per year
would be a tidy sum; a sum Election Board could not afford on
their limited budget. Only if Excom voted a tremendous increase
in their funds, could Election Board manage this expenditure.
Whether the ASSU is financially able to allot S4OO from the
ASSU budget, poses another problem.
The most important aspect facing Election Board, however, is
the practicability. All three counties use a plurality not a prefer
ential system. Can voting machines constructed for a plurality
election be used for a preferential election? Or would special
machines have to be brought a longer distance?- Of course,
Stanford could throw out its preferential system, but Election
Board still considers it the most feasible for Stanford elections.
Then, too, all students do not vote for the same offices. If
voting machines listed every candidate for every office, would
Ihe process of voiding certain offices involve too much time?
Even if more machines were alloted to take care of every possible
combination of offices for which a student might vote, the cost
could be fantastic.
One partial solution would be to have just the all-campus of
fices listed on the voting machines, But would this be fair to
class officers in case of a close election? Would the time required
to vote by voting machine and then by ballot be practical?
Election Board does not deem it feasible at present, but they
admit that they have not collected enough information on which
to base a definite decision. It it is at all possible, Stanford will
have voting machines; but if the information gathered through
the NSA election pool and more thorough investigation is no
more encouraging than the present facts, reforms in election pro
cedure will have to be through other channels. Such channels
might be numbering the ballots, education to the preferential
system, official ballot counters, new locks on the ballot boxes,
and voiding ballots by a rubber stamp — all of which reforms
that have been suggested by Election Board. —P. N.

cedure will have to be through other channels. Such channels
might be numbering the ballots, education to the preferential
system, official ballot counters, new locks on the ballot boxes,
and voiding ballots by a rubber stamp — all of which reforms
that have been suggested by Election Board. —P. N.
The answer for more accurate vote tabulation in future ASSU
euections appears simple—voting machines.
Such machines would automatically total all votes, eliminating
the margin for mistake and numerous recounts. Charges of
stuffing ballot boxes and such political misdeals would be les
sened.
Although the idea of installing voting machines has un
questionable value theoretically, Stanford's acceptance of the
machines must be tempered by two considerations—cost and
practicability.
Such machines would have to be borrowed from San Fran
cisco, San Mateo, or Santa Clara County for each of the two ASSU
elections. San Francisco quoted Election Board a price of S2O
lor each machine borrowed; approximately 10 machines would
be needed to avoid congestion at the polls. This $400 per year
would be a tidy sum; a sum Election Board could not afford on
their limited budget. Only if Excom voted a tremendous increase
in their funds, could Election Board manage this expenditure.
Whether the ASSU is financially able to allot S4OO from the
ASSU budget, poses another problem.
The most important aspect facing Election Board, however, is
the practicability. All three counties use a plurality not a prefer
ential system. Can voting machines constructed for a plurality
election be used for a preferential election? Or would special
machines have to be brought a longer distance?- Of course,
Stanford could throw out its preferential system, but Election
Board still considers it the most feasible for Stanford elections.
Then, too, all students do not vote for the same offices. If
voting machines listed every candidate for every office, would
Ihe process of voiding certain offices involve too much time?
Even if more machines were alloted to take care of every possible
combination of offices for which a student might vote, the cost
could be fantastic.
One partial solution would be to have just the all-campus of
fices listed on the voting machines, But would this be fair to
class officers in case of a close election? Would the time required
to vote by voting machine and then by ballot be practical?
Election Board does not deem it feasible at present, but they
admit that they have not collected enough information on which
to base a definite decision. It it is at all possible, Stanford will
have voting machines; but if the information gathered through
the NSA election pool and more thorough investigation is no
more encouraging than the present facts, reforms in election pro
cedure will have to be through other channels. Such channels
might be numbering the ballots, education to the preferential
system, official ballot counters, new locks on the ballot boxes,
and voiding ballots by a rubber stamp — all of which reforms
