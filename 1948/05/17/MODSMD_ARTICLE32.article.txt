## Honor Code Penalties 
### 
To the Editor:
Congrats to Lorry Lokey and his "On Quad" column for his discussion
of Men's Council's handling of Honor Code violations.
There are a couple of aspects of the penalties dispensed that I would
like to take issue with:
First, the idea that (he "Character of the accused man plays an im
portant part in council decisions," does not appear sound to me. Char
acter is a nebulous concept. Psychologists have been unable ade
quately to define or measure it. I'm afraid that allowing it to influence
Honor Code decisions will only serve to introduce personal bias and
prejudice. If the evidence is present that the individual is psychologically
maladjusted, then his case should be turned over to the Chief Men's
Counselor of the Health Service for professional care.
Secondly, I disagree with the policy on expulsion. When a student
commits a flagrant, all-out, intentional violation of the Code, he knows
what he's doing and what the penalty should be. He's shown his dis
respect for our traditions and customs and indicated that attending Stan
ford doesn't mean much to him. Such a person will be better off else
where for all concerned.
Give him another chance? Definitely, but not here. Put nothing on his
record about expulsion or suspension. Send him away with a clear
record, with nothing to plague him throughout his life, but send him
to Cal or UCLA; we don't want or need him here.
