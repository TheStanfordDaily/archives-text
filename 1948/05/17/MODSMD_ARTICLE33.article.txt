## Strategic African Desert 
### 
PARIS (UP). — Seventeen French soldiers are'
holding on to a piece of land in the Sahara no bigger
than the state of Texas. It has great strategic value
in war-time and perhaps hidden oil reserves worth
millions below the shifting sands.
The area is known as the Fezzan. It doesn't
show on most maps as such, but it is a huge stom
ach-shaped territory in southern Libya extending
up in a narrow corridor to the sea between Tripoli
and the eastern border of Tunisia.
What makes Fezzan important is that it connects
Algeria and Tunisia with French Equatorial Africa.
It gives France a solid block of territory between the
Mediterranean and ports along the West African
coast such as Dakar, Accra, and Lagos.
It makes a continuous war-time supply line
possible. Any oil that might he found beneath the
sand would be an added prize.
In 1942, Gen. Jacques Philippe Lec'.erc's second
armored division marched to the Mediterranean from
Like Tchad. En route he occupied the Fezzan. The
French have never moved out.
Diplomatic sources close to the French foreign
ministry say France intends to stay there, even
should the rest of Libya be returned to Italy by
agreement mong the victorious Allies.
There are many signs pointing that way. The
French last month issued an Algerian airmail stamp
showing a plane flying over a map of the Fezzan.
The French also have sealed the Fezzan off from
the rest of Libya by erecting road blocks on the
roads south of Tripoli which force traffic through
Tunisia. French military government in Tunisia
currently is responsible for feeding its 17 men and
for controlling the tribes in the wind-swept Fez
zan.
Naturally, the Arab nationalist movements in
North Africa are excited. At Cairo, Arab League
headquarters has made a formal protest with the
Allied Treaty Commission dealing with disposal of
Italian colonies.
However, diplomatic sources said the United
States and (ireat Britain, presumably for strategic
reasons, are known to favor French possession of
the Fezzan.
That means, those sources said, that despite any
shouting and fuss, France probably would end up in
possession of the territory it grabbed during the
last war.
French eyes are less on the last war than on
the possibility of the next war, and such oases as
Chadames and Anat would provide excellent air
fields for transport planes and heavy bombers.

than the state of Texas. It has great strategic value
in war-time and perhaps hidden oil reserves worth
millions below the shifting sands.
The area is known as the Fezzan. It doesn't
show on most maps as such, but it is a huge stom
ach-shaped territory in southern Libya extending
up in a narrow corridor to the sea between Tripoli
and the eastern border of Tunisia.
What makes Fezzan important is that it connects
Algeria and Tunisia with French Equatorial Africa.
It gives France a solid block of territory between the
Mediterranean and ports along the West African
coast such as Dakar, Accra, and Lagos.
It makes a continuous war-time supply line
possible. Any oil that might he found beneath the
sand would be an added prize.
In 1942, Gen. Jacques Philippe Lec'.erc's second
armored division marched to the Mediterranean from
Like Tchad. En route he occupied the Fezzan. The
French have never moved out.
Diplomatic sources close to the French foreign
ministry say France intends to stay there, even
should the rest of Libya be returned to Italy by
agreement mong the victorious Allies.
There are many signs pointing that way. The
French last month issued an Algerian airmail stamp
showing a plane flying over a map of the Fezzan.
The French also have sealed the Fezzan off from
the rest of Libya by erecting road blocks on the
roads south of Tripoli which force traffic through
Tunisia. French military government in Tunisia
currently is responsible for feeding its 17 men and
for controlling the tribes in the wind-swept Fez
zan.
Naturally, the Arab nationalist movements in
North Africa are excited. At Cairo, Arab League
headquarters has made a formal protest with the
Allied Treaty Commission dealing with disposal of
Italian colonies.
However, diplomatic sources said the United
States and (ireat Britain, presumably for strategic
reasons, are known to favor French possession of
the Fezzan.
That means, those sources said, that despite any
shouting and fuss, France probably would end up in
possession of the territory it grabbed during the
last war.
French eyes are less on the last war than on
the possibility of the next war, and such oases as
Chadames and Anat would provide excellent air
fields for transport planes and heavy bombers.
