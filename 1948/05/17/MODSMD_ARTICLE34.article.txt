# Atlantic-Mediterranean Canal
## 
### 
PARIS (UP). â€”The Panama Canal would look
like an irrigation ditch compared to a canal connect
ing the Atlantic and Mediterranean currently being
considered by the French government.
The proposed canal would be deep enough to
(ake (he biggest battleship or aircraft carrier from
Bordeaux on (he Atlantic side 150 miles across the
south of France to the Mediterranean port of
Sete in .'5O hours.
Such a shortcut would cut three days' steaming
off the present round-Gibraltar route. It also would
provide an alternate war-time lifeline between the
Western Allies and their eastern bases.
The canal idea is three centuries old and has
been proposed many times before. Current "cold
war" talk caused the plans to be hauled out anil
dusted off once again.
The big switch is the time and money required
to dredge the ditch and to install its eight locks.
French engineers estimate it would take 30.000 la
borers eight years to finish the job.
