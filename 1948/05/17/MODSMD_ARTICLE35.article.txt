## History 1948 Reapportionment Is Basis For Democratic Government 
### 
State government is a dull subject. You learn a
little about it in high school civics and promptly put
it out ol your mind. There are so many pressing
world, national, and personal problems that you can't
be bothered with the activities of a few mediocre
politicians in Sacramento.
The great majority of us don't even know the

name of our assemblyman or
state senator. Yet what happens
in Sacramento directly affects
you in a thousand and one ways.
How much it costs you to drive
your car (and what kind of high
ways you get to drive it on), how
much you pay for food, elec
tricity, and transportation, how
you are treated when you're sick
or out of a job, how you must
conduct your business, and how
good our schools are all depend
to a considerable extent on the

Legislature.
Our indifference causes more than indifferent
government. For while stnte politics means little to
vis, it means a lot to the groups with special interests.
The power and oil companies, the medical associa
tions, and the real estate men are fully aware of the
importance of the Legislature and since we don't care
to run it they do.
The San Francisco News and the Chronicle—both
Republican papers—made a survey last year and
pointed out that there were three legislative branches
in Sacramento—Assembly, Senate, and lobbies. Of
these, the last is the most important.
In a way this indifference is understandable, be
cause your vote for the State Senate is practically
worthless. Four million Californians are represented
by 35 senators, while the other six million ate repre
sented by five.
Why should a San Diegan get excited when his
460,000 people get one senator while 417.000 others
get eleven? Why should a veteran in L.A. cast his
ballot when lie knows that in Los Angeles County
there are 40 per cent of the state's veterans who are
represented by exactly one senator?
The 12.000 people of Mono-Inyo can outvote the
255.000 people of Santa Clara County. The quarter
of a million San Bernardino County residents have
one senator. So do the 25,000 residents of the El
Dorado-Amador-Alpine district.
Statistics can be piled on endlessly. They all add
up to the fact that the people in the large counties
and especially in the cities are disfranchised in favor
of the small outlying counties. The votes of the
people in Los Angeles, Alameda, San Francisco, San
Diego, Sacramento, Fresno, Santa Clara, San Ber
nardino, and San Joaquin are practically worthless.
In November we will have a chance to vote for
Senate reapportionment. This initiative measure
provides that "counties shall be represented in the
State Senate in proportion to population but that no
county shall have more than ten senators."
Significantly, the strongest opponents of this
measure are the State Chamber of Commerce and
the Associated Farmers, both high ranking among the
lobbyists now so influential. Both have branded the
measure as "dangerous." Is it dangerous to let the
people govern themselves?
The traditional cry is raised that reapportionment
would turn over state government to the city bosses.
That is a bare-faced lie. The present inequalities
also hurt the farmers. There are 80.000 farmers in
the top eight counties, each with one senator. But
the 47.000 farmers in the 16 lowest districts elect 16
senators.
