# KENT FULLER
## Bull Session 
### 
I have made many mistakes. My biggest mistake
was moving out of a campus residence. I took up
residence in a professor's home where I thought the
atmosphere would be more conducive to academic
pursuits. I was to regret my move.
I shordy found out that the professor's wife was
a domesticant. A domesticant (for those who don't
know) is a landlady whose happiness in life is de
termined by the condition of her boarders' rooms.
I soon found that there was a direct correlation be
tween the amount of dust in my room and the num
ber of times she backed her car into my molorscooter.
She is not particularly subtle in suggesting I clean
my room more often. Take the other morning, for
instance. I awoke to find a can of wax at the foot
of the bed, a dust rag pinned to the coat on the
chair, a mop protruding from under the bed, the
vacuum cleaner and Bon Ami inconspicuously bar
ling the door to the bathroom, and a note informing
me that the rent was due in three weeks.
We l eached an impasse in our domestic relations
over the matter of my making my bed. Having taken
Health 101, I realized that airing a bed in the morn
ing is an important hygienic consideration. Not only
that but it's a lot of work making a bed. I leave the
house early every morning so it's obvious I can't
make the bed and air it too. I pointed this situation
out to her in an exchange of notes. Her reply was
as follows:
"Dear Kent:
"I was showing your room to friends today. I
was very embarrassed because your bed was not

made. If you must air it, please air it at night.
"Respectfully."
I struggled valiantly to overcome my resentment.
I saw no need of her using my room for public dis
play purposes. If she had to show her guests some
thing she should have shown them the 1911 bottle
of Pabst her husband kept in the wine cellar. I'm
sure the guests would have appreciated it more than
a panoramic view of a college student's room. For
$35 a month you'd think a guy would get a little pri
vacy instead of a series of lectures on good house
keeping.
To her note requesting nocturnal airing, I replied
that it didn't seem practical to come home late at
night, draw the covers down, and air the bed by a
stopwatch before climbing in.
I think there wex-e two primary causes for my
misfortunes. First, a particularly prolific brand of
Western spider that inhabits my room, and secondly,
my liberal approach to housekeeping. I believe in
letting the clothes lie where they may fall.
Unforunately, her husband (the professor) soon
became a greater problem by far. He turned out to
be an ardent poker fan. I shortly lost my "Principles
of Modern Biology," "Teaching: Its Past and Future,"
"Lady Chatterley's Lover," and my right to use the
bathroom.
The professor took pity on my bad luck and com
pensated for removing the bathroom privileges by
cutting me for an 18th century chamberpot used by
King Henry the VIII. The moral to this is that
unless you're damn aesthetic don't bet your bath
room privileges.
