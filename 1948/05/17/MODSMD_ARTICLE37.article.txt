"While my whole heart is in this
University, my soul is in that
church." * » • ,
To Mrs. Leland Stanford, the Me
morial Church was indeed a center
of University life, to which she de
voted much time, energy, and mon
ey. The dedication of the church in
".903 and the final fixing of the
•plaque which reads "Memorial
Church Erected by Jane Lathrop
Stanford to the Glory of God and in
Loving Memory of Her Husband,
Leland Stanford," were the culmi
nation of the project most vital to
her.
,- No amount of learning," said
Mrs. Stanford, "can take the place
of decency, and no amount of sci
ence can take the place of backbone.

Take away the moral and spiritual
from higher education, and I want
nothing to with this or any other
university.
MRS. STANFORD herself ap
proved the mosaic designs and the
architectural plans for the original
church. It was built by her pri
marily as a memorial to her hus
band. It is through her efforts that
policies of non-sectarianism have
been carefully adhered to through
the years. The non-sectarian na
ture of the church seemed to her to
be essential to its usefulness and
the well-being of the student body.
The church was completed and
dedicated in 1903. During the 190G
earth' ake the whole edifice was
wrecked, the mosaics injured be
yond repair, the tower and the
chimes completely falling. Com

1 plete reconstruction became neces- j
; sary.
MOSAICS HAD TO BE re-de
; signed and replaced by the same !
Italian firm which Mrs. Stanford had
selected to do the original work, >
j and it took the utmost time and pa- j
i tience to finally complete their mi
nutely worked detail for the second
| time.
Since 1000, the church has at
i tracted sight-seers from all over
the country as well as full congre- I
j gations from the Farm area.
With the present programs for i
I interfaith activity and the series of j
! current religious conferences which j
i are being sponsored, Mrs. Stanford's ,
, ideal, that "the church should be
the heart and center of this Uni
| versity," seems to be being ful
filled.
