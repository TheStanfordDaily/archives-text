"To combine the efforts of
Stanford's denominational religious
croups in certain activities related
to religious work and to encourage
student participation in activities
of religious groups" is the purpose
of the newly formed Intorfaith
Committee of the Memorial Church
Board.
Mrs. Stanford's request for non
sectarianism in connection with
church services on campus has sent
many of the existing religious or
ganizations into Palo Alto and Men
lo Park for their meetings, although
some of those which do not hold
actual services remain on-campus
groups.
It will be the task of the Inter
faith Committee to bring these
groups closer to the chaplain and
to the Memorial Church and to
make them a more accessible and
integral part of campus life.
Interfaith Committee is composed
of the presidents of the nine major
denominational groups at Stanford.
At present its project is freshman
pre-registration, acquainting fresh
men with the various organizations
as well as getting information to the
religious groups about the freshman
class.
The committee feels the existence
of groups of different faiths side by
side has been a far cry from co
ordinated activity.
