# Student Religious Services Marked by Informality
## 
### 
Quiet informality characterizes the two student-led religious
services on campus. They are the candlelight service held every
Wednesday night in the Memorial Church at 9, and vesper serv
ices at 1C:30 on Sunday evenings in various women's living
groups.
Both of these services are completely in the hands of students,

under the general sponsorship of the<
Memorial Church Committee. In
neither does chaplain or faculty
play a guiding part.
Vesper services which have been
recently expanded to include Bran
ner, Union, Roble. and Lagunita.
Miss Rice, secretary of the church
committee, has led and directed the
organization of vesper services in the
women's living units for two years.
Under her planning they have be
come short services in which the
interruption to the classical music
played is the reading by a girl in
the living unit of a short prayer or
talk.
The services are generally con
ducted in candlelight and 'their sole
purpose is to give students a "break"
in which they can sit quietly and
meditate on Sunday evenings.
Resembling vespers in tone, can
dlelight services are conducted in
the church itself, and consist in the
reading of several passages from the
scriptures, a short prayer, and a
background of organ music.
The purpose of these services is
again meditation and quiet for all
those who attend, and many students
find this 20-minute service to pro
vide the mid-week interlude of re
laxation that they need.
