j lio-hum! Stanford's varsity swim
j ming team won another meet and
set four more records Saturday
morning.
I lie Indian tanksters, who have
! knocked ofl all dual meet competi
j tion with monotonous regularity
since they went on the warpath late
I hi the 1943 season, made it 33 wins
i in a row as they swamped the Uni
versity of California Bears for the
second time this year, 51 to 24, at
' the Berkeley pool.
TIIE CARDS climaxed their third
! straight undefeated dual meet sea
j son by copping every first-place but
| one in a meet that proved to be
I almost a carbon copy of the year's
j previous encounter between the two
I squads.
The win gave the Farm paddlers a
j clean sweep over conference compe
tition and established them as odds
on favorites to take team honors in
the coming PCC championship meet.
Captain Bob Anderson and dis
tanceman Ralph Sala were again the J
big guns in the Stanford attack. An- i
: derson anchored the four-man relay j
j team into a new PCC record after 1
j winning both sprints in record time, j
SALA HIT lIIS season's peak in
j the middle distance events, taking
1 the 220 in 2:12.9 and the 440 in 4:53.4.
Both are Cal-Stanford meet records.
Anderson's winning time of :23.1 in
the 50-yard sprint equalled his own
meet record for the event. Over the j
100-yard course, lie edged Cal's Stan J
Morketter by two feet to hang up
a new pool record of :51.9.
Paced by the fast laps of Anderson
and Dick Narver, the Card freestyle
relay team of Woody Hoogs, Warren i
Cutting, Narver and Anderson j
spurted to a new PCC record of j
3:33.s—nearly a full second faster |
than the previous standard set by i
four University of Washington swim- I
mers earlier this year.
NARVER'S FAST time of 51.9 for i
the century indicates that he is not j
to be counted out as a threat for i
the sprint championship in the PCC
meet at the Encina Pools Saturday. !
Cal's lone moment of glory came
when conference champ Jack Lavery j
annexed the three-meter diving |
event with 302.2 points. Cal's Chuck j
Lucchesi and Card Jim Bradshaw ,
followed closely with 291.8 and 291.7 ,
points respectively.
Indians Don Hester and Jack '

Weeden won their breaststroke and
backstroke races easily. Harry Bor
chers was second in the backstroke.
