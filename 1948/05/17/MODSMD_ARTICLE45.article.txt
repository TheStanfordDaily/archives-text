# Netmen Win Two
## 
### BY FRED HANNUM 
Stanford's varsity tennis men
won two matches in a row over
the weekend by squeezing by
College of the Pacific on Fri
day, 5 to 4, and slamming San
Francisco State Saturday, 8 1u 1.
Led by Hank Pfister and Don
Hamilton, COP surprised the Card
netmen by winning the number one
and two singles and doubles matches.
The amazing improvement of the
COP squad, which lost to Stanford
earlier in the season by 4 to 2,
caught the home team off guard.
The match was undecided until the
number three doubles.
IT WAS STANFORD'S depth of
talent that stopped COP. It be
came evident that Fred Lewis, Lu
cien Barbour, Bob Forbes, and Errol
Lycette contributed a great deal to
the team's success.
Kirk Mechem, Stanford's number
one, redeemed himself on Saturday
by outlasting S. F. State's tennis
giant, Joe Woolfson, 12-10, 9-7. The
match was a true test of Mechem's
ability, since Woolfson has won
about 42 out of his last 45 college
matches. Mechem played a forcing
game and won on his steady control
and placement shots.
The only other close match with
the S. F. Gaters was in the second
singles between Stanford's Bob
Lewis and Gene Phillips. Lewis
played under pressure all the way
and eked out two close set wins,
7-5, 7-9.
LUCIEN HARBOUR again played
the excellent game that won him
the third position on the team. He
down Ralph Chippendale easily, 2-6,
6-0. 6-2.
The only loss came in the number
one doubles. Usually made up of
the Lewis brothers, Bob and Fred,
the doubles team Saturday featured
Mechem and Barbour. Woolfson and
Chippendale topped the Card men,
6-2. 2-6, 6-1.
The other scores were:
No. 4 singles Fred Lewis (S) <1.
Warern Logan (SF) 6-2, 6-2; No. 5
singles Bob Forbes (S) d. Don
Forbes (SF) 6-1, 6-!; No. 6 singles
Errol Lycette (S) d. Rill Jackson
(SF) 6-1, 6-2; No. 2 doubles F.

and Logan (SF) 6-1, 6-3; No. .'1
doubles !5. Forbes and Dave Bash
am (S) d. D. Forbes and Jack
son (SF) 6-2, 6-0.


COACII ELWYN BUGGE'S var
sity tennis squad scored a double
win over the weekend, defeating
COP, 5-4, on Friday and slamming
San Francisco State the next day,
8-1.
