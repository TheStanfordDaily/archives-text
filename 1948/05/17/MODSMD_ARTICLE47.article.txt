# Golfers Outshoot Bears, Spartans
## 
### 
Stanford's ever-improving
golf team indicated that it will
be a strong contender for top
honors in the PCC and National
Collegiate tournaments coming
up this month and next by whip
ping Cal, 19-8, Friday at Berkeley
and by shading San .Jose's strong
sextet, 14-13, the next day. The In
dian-Spartan match, a 36-hole one,
was played over the Stanford course
and was followed by a large group
of golf enthusiasts.
Tom Lambie, No. 1 Stanford sin
gles man, sparkled in both victories.
He a one-over-par 72 Friday
to defeat Cal's Don Schwab and
teamed with Rob Rosburg to win
2'u points in the afternoon doubles.
AGAINST SAN JOSE the next
day, Lambie shot 69s in both the
singles and doubles. His Spartan
opponent, Morgan Fottrell, however,
toured the course in 67 strokes to
win 2'ii points.
Fottrell thrilled the large gallery
by his sepctacular playing on the
18th hole in the morning singles.
After he had teed off from 17 and had
landed in the rough to the right of
the 18th hole, the Spartan ace took
out his putter and placed his ball
within two feet of the cup.
Lowest score of the day in the Cal
match that was played over the Mira
Vista links was Rosburg's par 71.
Cal's Don Lane and Don Schwab had
scores of 72 and 73 respectively.
WHEN TIIE FARM LINKSMEN
downed the Bears Friday, they |
chalked up their second straight win
of the season over the hated Cali- I
fornians. Previously Coach Twiggs'
men had won, 20-7, in a match |
played over their home course.
The win over the Spartans was
sweet revenge for Stanford who
had dropped a close match to this I
bitter rival earlier in April.
Stanford started off strong in the
Spartan match, building up an lIV -
6V2 margin in the morning singles.
Singles scores shot by Stanford men
were Tom Lambie's 69; Bob Ros
burg's 72; Jack Shuler's 69; Bud
Moo's 71; Bob Crozier's 76 and Ernie ;
Kellberg's 75.
FOUR EAGLES were scored by
Stanford men Crozier, Shuler, Lam
bie. and Rosburg. in the singles I
matches.
San Jose same back strong in the
afternoon doubles and made a ;
strong bid to tie up or win the con- 1
test. All the Indians needed was |
24 points but they had to go all
out to get those.
Hampered by the absence of Bob
Rosburg, the Indians had to substi
tute reserve Pete Brown into the 1
doubles lineup with Lambie. Lambie 1
and Brown were pitted against Fot
trell and Bobby Harris and the two
doubles teams played even golf all
the way to split three points.
THE STANFORD DOUBLES team
won one-half point on the first side.
On the back side, it won holes 11
and 13 to hold a two-up advantage
teeing off on the 15th hole.
Lambie and Brown lost this ad
vantage soon, however, as the Fot
trel-Haris combination took holes 16
and 17. When the two doubles teams j
had finished the last hole they had
split three points.
Lambie and Brown had won l
of the 2Vz points needed to assure
the Cords of victory. The other In
dian doubles combos of Moe-Kell
berg and Crozier-Shuler each picked |
up a half-point to cinch the match.
MOE AND KELLBERG opposed
Eli Bariteau and Ross Smith in the !
doubles while Crozier and Shuler
faced Warren McCarty and Howard
Verutti. Crozier played most of the
afternoon matches with a bother
some nosebleed, and was weakened
by loss of blood.

WHEN TIIE FARM LINKSMEN
downed the Bears Friday, they |
chalked up their second straight win

afternoon doubles and made a ;
strong bid to tie up or win the con- 1
test. All the Indians needed was |
24 points but they had to go all
out to get those.
Hampered by the absence of Bob
Rosburg, the Indians had to substi
tute reserve Pete Brown into the 1
doubles lineup with Lambie. Lambie 1
and Brown were pitted against Fot
trell and Bobby Harris and the two
doubles teams played even golf all
the way to split three points.
THE STANFORD DOUBLES team
won one-half point on the first side.
On the back side, it won holes 11
and 13 to hold a two-up advantage
teeing off on the 15th hole.

and 17. When the two doubles teams j
had finished the last hole they had
split three points.
Lambie and Brown had won l
of the 2Vz points needed to assure
the Cords of victory. The other In
dian doubles combos of Moe-Kell
berg and Crozier-Shuler each picked |
up a half-point to cinch the match.
MOE AND KELLBERG opposed
Eli Bariteau and Ross Smith in the !
doubles while Crozier and Shuler
faced Warren McCarty and Howard
Verutti. Crozier played most of the
afternoon matches with a bother
some nosebleed, and was weakened
by loss of blood.

24 points but they had to go all
out to get those.
Hampered by the absence of Bob
Rosburg, the Indians had to substi
tute reserve Pete Brown into the 1
doubles lineup with Lambie. Lambie 1
and Brown were pitted against Fot
trell and Bobby Harris and the two
doubles teams played even golf all
the way to split three points.
THE STANFORD DOUBLES team
won one-half point on the first side.
On the back side, it won holes 11
and 13 to hold a two-up advantage
teeing off on the 15th hole.
Lambie and Brown lost this ad
vantage soon, however, as the Fot
trel-Haris combination took holes 16
and 17. When the two doubles teams j
had finished the last hole they had
split three points.
Lambie and Brown had won l
of the 2Vz points needed to assure
the Cords of victory. The other In
dian doubles combos of Moe-Kell
berg and Crozier-Shuler each picked |
up a half-point to cinch the match.
MOE AND KELLBERG opposed
Eli Bariteau and Ross Smith in the !
doubles while Crozier and Shuler
faced Warren McCarty and Howard
Verutti. Crozier played most of the
afternoon matches with a bother
some nosebleed, and was weakened
by loss of blood.

Stanford's ever-improving
golf team indicated that it will
be a strong contender for top
honors in the PCC and National
Collegiate tournaments coming
up this month and next by whip
ping Cal, 19-8, Friday at Berkeley
and by shading San .Jose's strong
sextet, 14-13, the next day. The In
dian-Spartan match, a 36-hole one,
was played over the Stanford course
and was followed by a large group
of golf enthusiasts.
Tom Lambie, No. 1 Stanford sin
gles man, sparkled in both victories.
He a one-over-par 72 Friday
to defeat Cal's Don Schwab and
teamed with Rob Rosburg to win
2'u points in the afternoon doubles.
AGAINST SAN JOSE the next
day, Lambie shot 69s in both the
singles and doubles. His Spartan
opponent, Morgan Fottrell, however,
toured the course in 67 strokes to
win 2'ii points.
Fottrell thrilled the large gallery
by his sepctacular playing on the
18th hole in the morning singles.
After he had teed off from 17 and had
landed in the rough to the right of
the 18th hole, the Spartan ace took
out his putter and placed his ball
within two feet of the cup.
Lowest score of the day in the Cal
match that was played over the Mira
Vista links was Rosburg's par 71.
Cal's Don Lane and Don Schwab had
scores of 72 and 73 respectively.
WHEN TIIE FARM LINKSMEN
downed the Bears Friday, they |
chalked up their second straight win
of the season over the hated Cali- I
fornians. Previously Coach Twiggs'
men had won, 20-7, in a match |
played over their home course.
The win over the Spartans was
sweet revenge for Stanford who
had dropped a close match to this I
bitter rival earlier in April.
Stanford started off strong in the
Spartan match, building up an lIV -
6V2 margin in the morning singles.
Singles scores shot by Stanford men
were Tom Lambie's 69; Bob Ros
burg's 72; Jack Shuler's 69; Bud
Moo's 71; Bob Crozier's 76 and Ernie ;
Kellberg's 75.
FOUR EAGLES were scored by
Stanford men Crozier, Shuler, Lam
bie. and Rosburg. in the singles I
matches.
San Jose same back strong in the
afternoon doubles and made a ;
strong bid to tie up or win the con- 1
test. All the Indians needed was |
