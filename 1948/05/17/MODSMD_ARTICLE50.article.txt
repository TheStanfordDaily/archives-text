# Crew Tops USC Shell
## 
### 
More than a thousand Stanfcrel
ites cut sleeping time last Saturday
morning to watch the Farm crew
down a game USC boatload by five
lengths. The 2,000-meter affair was
run off in the Palo Alto Yacht chan
nel to be the only race of the season
for the Card bunch on their home
waters. An inter-squad race at 8:30
served as a preliminary to the var
sity clash at 9.
An outgoing tide pushed times out
of all proportion although the Bay
waters were among the calmest of
the year. The victory made it two
out of three for the varsity eight
with a previous win over NCLA and
a respectful loss to the Olympic
hopefuls of California.
BOTH BOATS got off to good
starts and the Farm shell gradually
lengthened their lead. Coach A. A.
Clark's men showed a marked im
provement over their form in the
Cal meet of last Saturday after a
week of intensive workouts. Rowing
the first half of the race at a 35 per
minute stroke, the oarsmen slowed
down to nearly 30 for the final
half as thsy lengthened I heir strokes
and applying their power smoothly.
At the last pylon they held a five
length advantage an d finished
strongly.
IN THE PRELIMINARY affair
Coach Clark gave some of the sub
stitutes racing experience when he
put two "pickle" boats on the water.
McKenzie's Marauders won by a
scant length over Wong's Wildcats
in a clash punctuated with mishaps.
The oarsmen are continuing their
early morning workouts in prepara
tion for races at the Stockton Re
gatta on May 30 and at the Portland
Rose Festival on June 11.
