# SIRO Relief Helps Naples University Rebuild Its Library
## 
### BY CARYL HARMS 
"Stanford Library" is now a part of the University of Naples.
This was revealed in the annual report of the Stanford Inter
national Relief Organization for the academic year 1947-1948.
The library, reconstructed after almost total destruction by the
Germans during the war, has been supplied with a collection of
texts that will be kept for the use of â™¦

students financially unable to pur
chase them. This was made possible
by money sent from SIRO', and the
grateful Italian student body voted
to rename the library in honor of
.their American benefactors.
At the beginning of fall quarter,
Excom granted SIRO $1,300 to carry
out its work of sending material aid
to the friends and relatives of Stan
ford students living in foreign coun-

Tryouts for petitions with SIKO
will be held this afternoon from
1 to 2 al the SIRO shack near En
cina Commons.
Workers are needed for both
summer and fall quarters. Posi
tions open include two co-chair
men for summer and one man to
act as a co-chairman for next fall.

tries and to maintain a consistent
program of assistance to the Univer
sity of Naples.
DURING WINTER quarter, the
organization was granted $250 more.
SIRO also administered Stanford's
Annual relief fund drive, which net
ted $12,000.
In addition to the library recon
struction. the $3,600 collected for Na
ples was spent on a new mimeo
graph machine and supplies for its
operation. The machine is being used
to make copies of urgently needed
text books.
Parcels of clothing and food con
tributed by Stanford students in a
continuous drive throughout the year
have been sent to the Italian school
in the amount of about 1.200 pounds.
APPRECIATION FOR the 8.000
pounds of material sent to the friends
and relatives of Stanford studertfs is
best expressed in this letter from
Holland:
"Dear Friend:
"We wonder whether you can un
derstand the sunny feeling we ex
perienced when we received your
parcel of clothing. . . . We are very
grateful indeed for everything you
sent us (both for ourselves and for
those to whom we could give things
they badly needed). But however
much we appreciate them, it was
not the contents of the parcel itself
that gave us that warm feeling
somewhere near our heart."
