# Religion Improves Marriage-Evans
## 
### 
The love of a man for his wife
can be likened to "Jesus' love for
the church." That statement was
made last night by Dr. Louis Evans,
pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Hollywood, speaking at
vesper services held in Stanford
Memorial Church.
Subject of his talk was "Love,
Marriage, and Religion."
Dr. Evans went on to account for
the ever-rising divorce rate by at
tributing it to four things — a lack
of social disapproval, selfishness, ir
responsibility, and disinterest in re
ligion.
A religious wedding makes the
marriage contract more binding, he
asserted; couples with religious con
victions usually have less trouble
disciplining their children.
He made an allusion to the story
of Job's hard-hearted wife as an
example of the need for religion if
the mariage is to be happy.
The organ prelude was Cesar
Franck's Fantasie in A. The Univer
sity Choir sang, "Lo, a Voice to
Heaven" by Bortniansky, The post
lude was Karl Elert's "Now Thank
We All Our God."
