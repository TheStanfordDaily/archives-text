HERE'S $5.00 THAT

SAYS WHAT? . . . HERE IS FIVE
DOLLARS THAT SAYS THE CAV
ALIER SUIT IS BEST LOOKING
ON THE CAMPUS
You'll like the ease and comfort in the wear
ing: You'll like the sharpness of the collegiate
style. The Cavalier double breasted suit is dis
tinguishing because it is made from uncommon
fabric patterns that heretofore was an exclu
sive feature of tailor made suits. Come in and
inspect the featured cloth of the week, THE
CLEN PLAD, in blue grey and the unusual
delta brown. Be sure to remember our offer
to Stanford men: $5.00 LESS THAN RETAIL
PRICE ON ANY CAVALIER.
