# UN Atomic Energy Group Gives Up Control Attempt
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., May 17 IUP). â€”The United Nations
Atomic Energy Commission today broke off indefinitely its two
year effort to establish international control of atomic energy.
The commission voted 9 to 2, over Soviet objections, to toss the
East-West atomic stalemate into the UN Security Council, and

from there to the fall meeting oM
the UN General Assembly in Paris, j
HIE AMERICAN-LED majority
reported that atomic control is im- |
possible until Russia alters its en- J
tire concept of international rela- '
tions and accepts the majority- j
backed atomic control plan.
The action ended, perhaps for- j
ever, the work of the 11-nation UN j
Atomic Commission which was set |
up in January of 1946 by unanimous 1
vote of the General Assembly. It
came on the same day that the i
White House announced successful
tests of three new atomic weapons, j
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister j
Andrei Gromyko, who soon will |
leave his UN post and return to j
Moscow, protested that atomic ,
agreement was possible through the
UN "but the United States does not j
want it." ,
IIE APPEALED to the commis- ;
sion to keep talking, but the major- '
ity replied by adopting a report j
which blamed the Kremlin alone for
failure to achieve agreement on a '
foolproof system for the control of j
atomic energy and the detection and
punishment of atomic violators.
The majority said the only alter
native to that kind of control was j
a world atomic armaments race.
GROMYKO COUNTERED in the
i'ull-dress meeting of the Atomic
Comission with a renewal of Rus- I
sia's attack on the American con
trol plan, asserting that the real j
motives of the United States were !
to block international control, pro
tect this country's atomic "monop
oly," and trample on the sovereignty
of weaker nations.
"We have always felt that deci- ;
sions concerning the atomic control
problem are possible," he said, "but 112
only in the United Nations. The :
United Nations offers the only pos- j
sibility for the control of atomic ;
energy."
