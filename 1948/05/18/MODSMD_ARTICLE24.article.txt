# CAMPUS OPINION
## Wire for Peace 
### 
To the Editor:
Supposedly voicing the opinion of the American people, President Tru
man has refused to meet Russian overtures for an amicable settlement of
disputes. He has declared his resolve to maintain America's "firm" policy
toward Russia, a policy which apparently excludes the democratic princi
ples of compromise.
Tnus, President Truman is acting on the assumption that a previously
declared foreign policy is right under all exigencies. Although vacillation
is to be condemned, intelligent flexibility is to be praised. The ability to
adjust to new circumstances while maintaining fixed principles is the
measurement of wise diplomacy; and in the present case it is the measur
ment of our distance to war.
We are forgetting the end in a sudden idolatry of the means. An op
portunity to maintain peace is to be sacrificed to a sacrosanct foreign policy.
Now is our opportunity to clear the atmosphere of tension caused by the
perpetual fear of an atomic war. Now is our opportunity to found a
real peace, a peace unburdened by militarism and constant threats of
new crises. Either we accept the present opportunity to settle our dis
putes peacefully with Russia, or we entrench for inevitable disaster.
As apathy has always been an ally of the forces of war, many Stanford
students are sending telegrams to the President urging him to take
definite action in meeting with Russia at the conference table. Such
action may insure peace. It is certainly worth trying.
