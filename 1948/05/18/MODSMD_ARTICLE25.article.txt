# 'My Position'

To the Editor:
I would like to clarify my position on the Honor Code issue in regard
to yesterday's article "Frosh Revive Honor Code."
I think it is wonderful that Frosh Excom has shown such an active
interest in discussing the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard, and
that they believe recommendations for clarification are in order. However,
I did not make the following statement:
"Confusion of these two doctrines even among recently oriented fresh
men was the impetus for these recommendations."
Also, I did not present the three recommendations made by Frosh
Excom as my plans for explanation of the Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard, as The Daily article implies.
1 discussed the Honor Code with Frosh Excom along several lines,
mainly:
1. Through a gradual evolution more and more student responsibility
in government, the Honor Code has come to encompass every phase
of Stanford life.
2. The confused interpretation and position of the Fundamental
Stanford in relationship to the Honor system.
3. The Honor Code as an undertaking of the students individually
and collectively places directly on each individual the responsibility
for observing all standards, regulations, and policies set up for the wel
fare of the students and the University.
Frosh Excom should be commended for the active interest they have
shown, but perhaps ASSU Excom, Pre-Reg Committee, and the Honor
Code Standing Committee can and will desire to think through the prob
lems of the system even a little farther, with the above three points
in mind.
Confusion about the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard has
resulted because the two very similar systems, with like purposes, are
separated by too great a division line.
