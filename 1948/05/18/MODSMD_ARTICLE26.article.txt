# The 						Bletz Hunt
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Allen Bletz has recently blessed us with the condemnation of certain
tactics of the University of Wyoming. As usual he has found a situa
tion in which he could use such words as "inquisition," "witch hunt,"
"ignorance," "blindness," "totalitarianism," "democracy," and"the Ameri
can way" without any facts to back them.
May I remind Mr. Bletz that the University of Wyoming is a state
school, and that the people of that state are capable of deciding what
"subversive and un-American" means without any help from one of our
local bunch of "liberals."
And as there is no election to be won now, why doesn't Mr. Bletz take
a rest and let his pen cool? After all. the "History, 15)48" column will
be available to "thinkers" again next year.
