## Sex for Teachers 
### 
SACRAMENTO (UP)—Delegates to the 49th an
nual State PTA Convention here had plain advice
from a college president that standards of home lile
could be improved through education by allowing
teachers to marry and training some of them to give
proper sex instruction.
Dr. Lynn White Jr., president of Mills College,
told the 2,200 delegates that "there is no such thing
as education: there are just teachers."
At Mills, he said, "only a thin trickle" of grad
uates are entering the teaching profession. The
trouble, he declared, is not low salaries but the
prejudice of most school boards against married
teachers and the fact that most college girls think
the public school teacher "is supposed to be a sort
of secular nun."
Said White: "A woman in any other profession
can smoke or take a cocktail with complete impunity
. . . but a school teacher may be subject to social
censorship in every detail of her private life, and
girls of independence are not going to involve them
selves voluntarily in a profession which is subject
to such humiliating restrictions."
White said education must be made "family
minded" if it is to improve home standards. No
one course can do the job, he said, but sex educa
tion at the high school level would help, lie added:
"There are still, of course, many people who main
tain sex education can be left to parents. Unfor
tunately, all the evidence indicates that parents do a
very bad job of it."
He said teachers for such courses should be .spe
cially trained for the job. Other courses, he added,
should be taught in practical family problems.
