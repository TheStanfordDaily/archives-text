# Baby Sex Predetermined

### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. — Researchers at the University
of Georgia medical school here have perfected a
laboratory test to determine the sex of a child
months before it is born. They are not so sure
it's such a good idea, however.
The test was invented by the Russians, whose
experimenters in hormone research claim that it is
!)() per cent accurate. It is being perfected and sim
plified here by the doctors who have found it to
work about seven times out of 10.
Only at the university hospital here can expectant
mothers so far be tested for the sex of their unborn,
according to Dr. Robert G. Greenblatt, professor of
endocrinology (the study of internal secretions), who
is supervising the project.
The actual testing procedure, he explained, is
complicated. One of the steps requires a group
of mice to be injected with solutions prepared from
about 10 teaspoonfuls of blood from each pregnant
woman undergoing the examination.
Dr. Greenblatt and his co-worker, D. E. H. Nei
burgs, research fellow in charge of the laboratory
work, base their calculations on the actions of two
hormones in the blood of pregnant women. For
simplicity's sake, the hormones are called FSH and
LH.
Women found to be high in LII and low in FSII

normally may expect a son. It's just the reverse in
the case of a girl—the LH is low and the FSH
predominates.
Right now, Greenblatt and Neiburgs are working
on a more simplified test which they hope will be
more sensitive. Neiburgs plans to publish a scien
tific paper on the project soon, reporting on a series
of 70 to 100 cases.
