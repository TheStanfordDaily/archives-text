## History 1948 Margarine Tax — A Blow to National Health 
### 
Representative Mitchell of Indiana and Senator
Fill bright of Arkansas are striking a blow for public
health and for a shrunken pocket-book at the same
time by offering measures to repeal the federal taxes
on margarine.
The American Public Health Association has testi-

IWOUVIUUWII Xlcia
fied that federal and state laws
handicapping margarine in favor
of butter are detrimental to pub
lic health. The many people who
cannot afford butter either use
margarine, or they do not get a
necessary element of diet.
Margarine taxes act to keep the
product off their grocer's shelves
—especially in the case of the
smaller grocers. They drain the
inadequate finances of hospitals,

which must pay a (ax of $600
and 10 cents a pound for adding color to margarine
—the theory being that this makes them subject to
the manufacturer's tax.

Federal taxes and license fees on margarine are
not meant to be revenue producers—their purpose
is to harass the manufacturer and the consumer,
make it difficult to buy margarine, and promote
the purchase of butter instead.
These taxes penalize not only the consumer but
also the farmers who raise soybeans, cotton-seed,
corn and peanuts, from which margarine is made—
standing in the way of the normal development of
the market for these farm products.
They came about in the first place because the
dairy industry thought so highly of margarine that
it was unwilling to compete with it on a basis of
merit. They continue in existence because the House
Agriculture Committee, dominated by the dairy in
terests, is unwilling to allow the question to be set
tled in the democratic way, by a majority vote in
the House of Representatives.
Too long has margarine been kept down because
of (he selfish money-grabbing aims and schemes of
a few big industries and men. When something of
this nature affects not only the welfare of the people,
but more important their health, immediate and de
cisive action should be taken.
These nuisance taxes on margarine are an unfair
obstruction to the maximum use of a needed food
and these taxes should be repealed immediately.
And while repealing these taxes, it might not be a
bad idea for Congress to look into a few of its own
Agriculture Committees and investigate itself, for a
great deal of the so-called "good legislation" upon
close scrutiny would show its real colors.

fied that federal and state laws
handicapping margarine in favor
of butter are detrimental to pub
lic health. The many people who
cannot afford butter either use
margarine, or they do not get a
necessary element of diet.
Margarine taxes act to keep the
product off their grocer's shelves
—especially in the case of the
smaller grocers. They drain the
inadequate finances of hospitals,

which must pay a (ax of $600
and 10 cents a pound for adding color to margarine
—the theory being that this makes them subject to
the manufacturer's tax.

Federal taxes and license fees on margarine are
not meant to be revenue producers—their purpose
is to harass the manufacturer and the consumer,
make it difficult to buy margarine, and promote
the purchase of butter instead.
These taxes penalize not only the consumer but
also the farmers who raise soybeans, cotton-seed,
corn and peanuts, from which margarine is made—
standing in the way of the normal development of
the market for these farm products.
They came about in the first place because the
dairy industry thought so highly of margarine that
it was unwilling to compete with it on a basis of
merit. They continue in existence because the House
Agriculture Committee, dominated by the dairy in
terests, is unwilling to allow the question to be set
tled in the democratic way, by a majority vote in
the House of Representatives.
Too long has margarine been kept down because
of (he selfish money-grabbing aims and schemes of
a few big industries and men. When something of
this nature affects not only the welfare of the people,
but more important their health, immediate and de
cisive action should be taken.
These nuisance taxes on margarine are an unfair
obstruction to the maximum use of a needed food
and these taxes should be repealed immediately.
And while repealing these taxes, it might not be a
bad idea for Congress to look into a few of its own
Agriculture Committees and investigate itself, for a
great deal of the so-called "good legislation" upon
close scrutiny would show its real colors.
