Interfraternity Council and the Interfraternity
Board of Control are two confusing terms to those
students not living on the Row. One, the Interfra
ternity Council, proposes the rushing rules and pro
grams and reviews general fraternity affairs. This
council of 24 house presidents has no disciplinary

action power.
The more important Interfra
ternity Board, however, may ini
tiate any corrective action re
garding conduct in the houses. It
is the final authority for all phases
of fraternity life whether it may
be finances or discipline. Except
for a review and approval of ac
tion by the Dean of Students, the
board is independent of all other
University and student agencies.
The board consists of Interfra-

ternity Council's president and secretary, four stu
dent members, two alumni members, two faculty
members, and the Dean of Students as an cx officio
member.
Of interest to non-fraternity members is the extent
of the board's disciplinary power. Two weeks ago
this column stated that the board's power encroached
on the authority of Men's Council and that student
government in the judicial branch was heading to
wards decentralization unless the two groups got
together. An alumni member of the Interfraternity
Board, Harold M. Bacon, said this was a misunder
standing common to many Farm students.
"Fundamental Standard violations involving men
as individuals are always handled by Men's Coun
cil,"he said. "But in all cases of infractions involv
ing a fraternity as an entire organization, Interfra
ternity Board of Control exercises its authority."
If a house, for example, is indicted by the board
for allowing several men to drink liquor on the prem
ises, the board will punish the house on the basis

that (he fraternity dicl not fulfill its duty of main
taining proper conduct. Meanwhile, ihe three or
four individuals that brought on all the trouble by
drinking on the campus may be hauled before Men's
Council and tried as individuals who broke Uni
versity liquor regulations as stated in the Funda
mental Standard.
"Fraternities as fraternities, then, are subject to
the board, while individuals acting as individuals
come under Men's Council jurisdiction." Confusing?
Read over that above example again. Mr. Bacon
said the confusing issues develop in borderline cases
between Interfraternity Board and Men's Council
authority. He added that the board and the council
try to reach a satisfactory solution in such cases. One
or two members on the council do not agree.
I might point out another example of this divided
authority. If a group of fraternity men go down
the highway for a short snort, return to the campus,
and raise a fuss, then their trial would appear before
Men's Council. Their action was one that the indi
vidual fraternity house could not control; therefore,
the board would have no jurisdiction in the case.
Men's Council, however, would hear the case because
the men's actions were those of individuals breaking
Fundamental Standard conduct rules.
One non-fraternity member of Men's Council has
argued that council powers were being assumed by
Interfraternity Council which is not a disciplinary
agency. Mr. Bacon, on the other hand, said there
have been recent cases tried by the council that
distinctly came under board jurisdiction.
Perhaps the differences in opinions between the
two sides lies in a misunderstanding by each group
of the other's duties. Maybe there is a bitterness
on the part of fraternity men to have non-fraternity
men tell them they have done wrong; likewise, Men's
Council may be pointing for authority they never
have possessed. Let's get together and settle this
issue before another case comes up and forces an
understanding at the expense of hurt feelings.
