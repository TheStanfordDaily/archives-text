# Lost Horizon Catches Audience's Imagination
## 
### 
The high cost of picture making and "claims suits" have forced
Hollywood to re-release some of its earlier movies. These pic
tures have a rather wholesome flavor that shows Hollywood at
least once had the touch for making good comedies, tragedies,
and even melodramas.
"Lost Horizon," the fantastic tale of a Utopia called Shangri-La,

is a "different" picture. From the
moment that Bob Conway and four
other passengers are kidnapped in
China to their arrival in the Valley
of the Blue Moon and their discov
ery of what the valley means, the
picture captivates the audience's
imagination.
Ronald Colman plays Conway
with the disarming boyishness that
enchanted the audiences of the
thirties. Thomas Mitchell as an
American swindler and Edward Ev
erett Horton as the comedy relief
are thoroughly satisfactory. The
vest of the cast tend to dive into
hysterics too often.
''The Doctor Takes a Wife"
blends restrained slapstick humor
to a rich mellowness. Loretta
Young, a man-hater who has just
written a best-seller on the subject,
and Ray Milland, a doctor of neuro
psychiatry, share laughs with Ches
ter, a model of a migrain headache.
Through an accident the press re
ceives word that they are married
and neither can deny it, since he I
was found, minus hi.s trousers, in ,
her bedroom. Reginald Gardner
and Edmund Gwen share honors in
the comedy, which has one hilarious j
scene in which Milland entertains j
his girl friend in one apartment and ,
the medical school faculty in an
other.â€”Levin
