# Modesto Relays Next For Stanford Trackmen
## 
### 
With the Fresno Relays of 1948
now track history, Stanford track- !
.Tien are looking forward to the Mo
desto Relays which will be held
next weekend.
New records were established
right and left in the 22nd annual
meeting of the Fresno Relays last [
Saturday, as track and weather con
ditions were perfect.
The Stanford varsity tracksters!
were leading the field for a large
part of the meet, mainly through
some early "come-throughs." Dar
nell Kreitz's and Downing McKee's
one-two in the high hurdles, which
is one of the few traditional non- ;
relay races on the program, was a |
definite shot in the arm for the j
Stanfordites.
The race was a tough one for Craig
Dixon, Bruin cinder star, to lose. He
was leading by a good three yards |
and was heading for a 14-flat race !
or better, when he smashed into;
the final hurdle. Kreitz and McKee
came in a close one-two, while Kent I
got an important fifth place.
TIIE INDIANS pulled a mild sur
prise in the medley relay, when the :
team finished a strong third behind
LAAS arid USC. Larry Hod ran a
sensational quarter mile to give the I
Cards a five-yard lead, and A 1 Holu- '
bar, running the half-mile in the'
number two position, was a close

third behind the LAAC and Trojan
i stars.
George Grimes then ran a cred
itable 1320 behind Carmen Bova's
3:05, and A 1 Lyons, running the
anchor mile, held onto the third
spot behind LAAC's Twomey and
Troy's Sink, who ran 4:16. This gave
! the Cards an important eight points
in the college race, since the Ath
letic Club scoring was independent.
It is interesting to note that Bud
Held, ace Indian javelin thrower,
could have won the Kansas, Penn,
or Drake Relays with his 213 ft. toss. I
However, he took third at Fresno
behind Dr. Seymour of the LAAC
and Harry Likens of San Jose State.
MEKRITT VAN SANT, who com
peted for the Stanford frosh, hit
23 feet 2"h inches in the broad jump, j
Van Sant has been consistently
jumping over 23 feet this season.
He looks like a good prospect for
next year's varsity. He missed third
place by only 1% inches, as he took}
fifth.
The frosh relay team also did well.
The team, composed of Joss Scroggy,
Eric Southwood, Hicks Williams, and
Cass Bly, took second place hon
ors. The Trojan yearlings took the
event in the fast time of 3:21, and if
it had not been for one bad pass, j
the frosh would have been right up
there. They beat five other frosh I
teams.

MEKRITT VAN SANT, who com
peted for the Stanford frosh, hit
23 feet 2"h inches in the broad jump, j
Van Sant has been consistently
jumping over 23 feet this season.
He looks like a good prospect for
next year's varsity. He missed third
place by only 1% inches, as he took}
fifth.
The frosh relay team also did well.
The team, composed of Joss Scroggy,
Eric Southwood, Hicks Williams, and
Cass Bly, took second place hon
ors. The Trojan yearlings took the
event in the fast time of 3:21, and if
it had not been for one bad pass, j
the frosh would have been right up
there. They beat five other frosh I
teams.
With the Fresno Relays of 1948
now track history, Stanford track- !
.Tien are looking forward to the Mo
desto Relays which will be held
next weekend.
New records were established
right and left in the 22nd annual
meeting of the Fresno Relays last [
Saturday, as track and weather con
ditions were perfect.
The Stanford varsity tracksters!
were leading the field for a large
part of the meet, mainly through
some early "come-throughs." Dar
nell Kreitz's and Downing McKee's
one-two in the high hurdles, which
is one of the few traditional non- ;
relay races on the program, was a |
definite shot in the arm for the j
Stanfordites.
The race was a tough one for Craig
Dixon, Bruin cinder star, to lose. He
was leading by a good three yards |
and was heading for a 14-flat race !
or better, when he smashed into;
the final hurdle. Kreitz and McKee
came in a close one-two, while Kent I
got an important fifth place.
TIIE INDIANS pulled a mild sur
prise in the medley relay, when the :
team finished a strong third behind
LAAS arid USC. Larry Hod ran a
sensational quarter mile to give the I
Cards a five-yard lead, and A 1 Holu- '
bar, running the half-mile in the'
number two position, was a close

third behind the LAAC and Trojan
i stars.
George Grimes then ran a cred
itable 1320 behind Carmen Bova's
3:05, and A 1 Lyons, running the
anchor mile, held onto the third
spot behind LAAC's Twomey and
Troy's Sink, who ran 4:16. This gave
! the Cards an important eight points
in the college race, since the Ath
letic Club scoring was independent.
It is interesting to note that Bud
Held, ace Indian javelin thrower,
could have won the Kansas, Penn,
or Drake Relays with his 213 ft. toss. I
However, he took third at Fresno
behind Dr. Seymour of the LAAC
and Harry Likens of San Jose State.
