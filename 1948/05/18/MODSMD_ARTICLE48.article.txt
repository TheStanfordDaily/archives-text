# Barrett's Perfect Game Highlights Coast Play
## Daily Sports 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Venerable Dick "Kewpie" Barrett of Seattle, the grand old man
of PCL baseball, added another feat to his 25 years of baseball
accomplishments as he pitched the first no-hitter of the '48 Coast
League season. Barrett pitched a perfect game, facing only 21
men, the minimum, in the seven-inning second game of Sunday's
twin bill between Seattle and Sac-â™¦

ramento.
It was Kewpie's 204 th victory in
the Coast League and his sixth win
of the season.
WITH BAKUETT and Neil Sheri
dan sparking the club, the Suds
foamed all over the Sacs last week,
winning the series 5 games to 1. The
Rainiers are now in fourth place,
and judging from their piay last
week are definite pennant contend
ers.
Meanwhile San Francisco length
ened its league lend to four full
games as Oakland and Los Angeles
were cutting each other's throats.
The Seals copped 6 out of 7 from
Hollywood and have now won 12
out ol' their last 14 games. The
O'Doulmen were slow getting start
ed, but right now they're really rob -
ing, and it will take a first-rate ball
club to overtake them.
Just how strong Oakland is will
be decided this week when the Oaks
and Seals tangle for the first time.
Attendance records should lall it
the weather co-operates.
NICK ETTEN blasted out four
homers and batted in eight runs
during Sunday's Oak - Ange! twin
bill to lead the Oakland hitters. In
fact the Oak batters were getting
plenty of hits all week, but the
Acorn pitchers were unable to hold
the Angels in check, and conse
quently Oakland dropped the series
4 games to 3.
San Diego took 4 out of 6 from
Portland in an abbreviated series
which was cut short by inclement
weather.
BRIEFS: Tom Hafey, brother of
Will, who was recently given his
release by the Oaks, was signed by
Los Angeles. In his first appearance
in an Angel uniform on Sunday
Hafey held his former teammates
scoreless in four innings of relief
pitching.
Johnny Ostrowski, who makes a
round trip to the majors and back
every year, was returned to Los
Angeles. The Boston R<?d Sox
drafted him last year. Ostrowski is
a long-ball hitter and should help
the Angels' cause.
Imperturbable Con Dempsey con
tinued to amaze his fans by saving
two more games for the Seals last
week. Big Con has now hur'ed 22
innings in the role of relief and has
yet to allow an earned run. This
should be some sort of record.
