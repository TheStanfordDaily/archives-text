# Lively Ball? Could Be

NEW YORK, May 17 (UP)—May
be the ball isn't any livelier but
the conversation about it certainly
is and. if statistics mean anything,
the boys are swinging at a "souped
up" pellet in the majors this season.
Thus far in the American League
this season, on the basis of latest
ofiicial averages there have been 113
homers on a total of 1,336 hits. That
breaks down to a percentage of
roughly eight per cent, meaning
that about eight out of every 100
hits is a homer. Last year during
the entire season there were 10,733
hits and 674 homers in the Amer
ican League for a percentage of .063,
or a little better than six per hun
dred hits.
For extra base hits the comparison
is just as striking. There have been
435 doubles, triples and homers in

the 1.336 total which figures out to
31.97 per cent. Last year the 2,562
extra base hits in the total of 10,733
safe blows was only 23.87 per cent.
In the National League, it looks
as if the pitchers either are a little
more effective or maybe that Spal
ding stamp on the ball takes a little
more zip out of it than the Reach
label on the American League apple.
Because the National League bats
men are operating on just about
the same basis as they did last vear.
