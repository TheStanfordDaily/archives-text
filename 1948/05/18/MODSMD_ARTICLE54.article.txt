## 
### 
Stanford's next to last place base- ,
ball club goes to Moraga this after- |
noon to meet the cellar-dwelling St.
Mary's Gaels in a game that will
decide just who is going to come up
with the conference booby prize.
The Indians are still recovering |
I from a disastrous weekend in Los
I Angeles where they let the USC
j Trojans run over them in two
[ straight games. Today's game with
j St. Mary's and next Saturday's dou- 1
J ble-header with the Gaels are all
that remain on Stanford's CIBA
schedule. They must beat the Gaels J
to stay out of the basement.
DAVE DAHLE tossed six-hit ball
against the Trojans, but the Cards j
only garnered five off Wally Hood,
j Dahle will probably take the mound
I today as Stanford goes after its fifth
j league win. The Indian season rec

ord stands at four wins and eight)
losses.
St. Mary's is struggling a few
jumps behind with two wins and
nine losses. The Gaels have a good
pitcher in Carroll Canfield, but after
that things get tough. They have
been kicked around and knocked,
goofy by every team in the league
COACH JOHNNY VERGEZ of the
Gaels is having one of his poorest
seasons in organized ball. Last year
he kept the Moraga men in the thick
of things, and aided by Herman
Wedemeyer, the Gaels blasted Stan
ford, 22 to 7. The same thing
shouldn't happen this year.
Stanford will be fighting to break
a three-game losing streak, and
ought to be able to do it against the
hapless Gaels.
