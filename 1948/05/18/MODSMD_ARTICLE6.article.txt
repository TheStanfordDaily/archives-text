# Gov. Dewey Faces Stassen In Debate on Communism
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., May 17 (UP).
I — Presidential candidates Gov.
i Thomas E. Dewey of New York
and Harold E. Stassen of Minnesota,
; meeting on the same platform in
the tradition of the Lincoln-Doug
| las debates, tonight argued the
question of outlawing Communism
before a nationwide radio audience.
The debate was held in the main
studio of radio station KEX, Port
j land, and broadcast nationally over
I three networks as the climax to
, a hotly contested campaign between
j Stassen and Dewey for Oregon's
I 12-man Republican delegation. The
: primary election will be held Fri-
STASSEN OPENED the debate
j with a 20-minute affirmative pre
j sentation, and was followed by a
| 20-minute answer by Dewey.
Stassen said that one part of his
proposed program for Amcrica "'has
been dircctly challenged."
"I have reached the conclusion
that the Communist organizations in
the world are absolutely directed by
the rulers of Russia in the Kremlin."

Stassen said Communist organiza
tions are not really political parties
—"They are actually fifth columns;
they are quisling cliques."
DEWEY USED the same argu
ments that he has employed in
speech after speech throughout Ore
gon. He said Stassen's original pro
posal to outlaw the Communist
party was "immoral, unconstitu
tional, and nothing but totalitarian
ism itself."
He said the proposal was nothing
"but the method of Hitler and Sta
lin. ... It is an attempt to beat
dawn ideas with a club. ... It is
surrender of everything we believe
in. . . . It is a philosophy which
I shall fight to the limit cf my
strength."
In the debate, Stassen and Dewey
—who are trying to start a band
wagon rolling from Oregon to the
White House—finally agreed on the
Communism issue as the one point
on which they would take their in
tra - party campaign differences to
the national electorate.
