# Finn Is First FSP Scholar
## 
### 
Penntti Lehpi from Finland is the
first foreign student selected to live
at Stanford for a year under the
Foreign Scholarship Fian. He will
arrive at Stanford this fall.
Lehpi. a social science major and
a graduate strident, will live two
quarters at the Phi Delta Theta
house and one quarter at the Theta
Xi house.
The plan, passed at the last stu
dent body election, provides for 10
foreign students to live at fraternity
houses and living groups that have
pledged their houses for one or more
quarters.
The Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee, approved by Excom last
Wednesday, includes Glen Fishbach,
chairman; Nancy Alden, Frank
Wolff, Leonard Hoar, Hardin Holmes,
and Ciiff Carlsen. The committee
will work under the lIR but will
be responsible to Excom for its ex
penditures.
Fifty per cent of the students will
be chosen from the files of the In
stitute of International Education
while the rest will be chosen among
students recommended by Stanford
faculty and students and through
personal contact with European uni
versities.
The other nine students will be
chosen by the end of this quarter.
Living groups will be given files on
possible candidates. They will make
their own selections during the next
few weeks.
