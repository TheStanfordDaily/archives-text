# 'No-Strike' Order Extended
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 18 (UP).— 112
Confident that a settlement of the
railroad labor dispute is near, the
government tonight asked and ob- |
tained a 10-day extension of the j
temporary court order that blocked I
a nationwide strike a week ago.
Federal Judge T. Alan Goldsbor- j
ough signed the order at his home
late this evening. He did so at the
request of H. Graham Morison, as
sistant attorney general, and Joseph ;
M. Friedman, special assistant to
Attorney General Tom C. Clark.
The original no - strike order |
would have expired at 7:45 p.m.,
EDT, tomorrow. By a stroke of his
pen, Goldsborough made certain
that the three rail brotherhoods
that threatened to strike could be
cited for contempt if they walk off
the job before the same hour on j
Saturday, May 29.
AT THE SAME TIME, Goldsbor
ough postponed unti! 10 a.m. Friday, j
May 28, scheduled hearings on the
government's plea for a temporary
injunction which would prohibit a
strike for 20 more days. If a set
tlement is reached before the ex- j
tended order expires, this request I
wil be dropped.
Goldsborough acted as railroad
and union officials reportedly made
some progress at new bargaining j
sessions arranged by Presidential <
Assistant John R. Steelman and held

under the watchful eye of govern
ment officials.
MANAGEMENT spokesmen de
clined to discuss the five-hour ses
sion, but Alvanley Johnston, presi
dent of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, indicated that some
progress was being made. He em
phasized, however, that "there is
nothing definite in the way of a
settlement."
The government's late-hour re
quest for an extended no - strike
order was designed to remove a big
stumbling block in negotiations.
The three rail unions—the Engi
neers, the AFL Switchmen's Union,
and the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen—had pro
tested in a formal letter to Steelman
that they were opposed to negotia
tions while they were involved in
court litigation.
