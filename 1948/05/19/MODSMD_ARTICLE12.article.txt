## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 18 (UP)
Joseph E. Moody, president of the
Southern Coal Producers Associa
tion, tonight defied John L. Lewis to
carry out his threat to walk out
on new soft coal wage conference's
if Moody's organization is permitted
to attend.
The United Mine Workers boss
flung the challenge at representa
tives of the entire bituminous in
dustry in opening negotiations for a
new wage agreement to replace the
one he is terminating on June 30.
He denounced the association as a
"holding company twice removed
from the mine owners" and told in
dustry officials he would rather
abandon the negotiations than deal
with Moody or any of his represen
tatives.
A few hours later Moody issued
this brief statement in rebuttal:
«»*
"We are in the conference to stay.
We don't know of anything that has
happened today to change that po
sition."
Lewis' fighting ultimatum came
just after the operators had settled
down at the first bargaining session.
They held a hurried caucus; then
obtained a recess until 10 a.m. to
morrow.
One spokesman said that many of
them were insisting on a conference
seat for the association, even at the
risk of breaking up the conference.
The flare-up came after Lewis suf
fered another legal setback at the
hands of Federal Judge Alan T.
Goldsborough, the jurist who broke
up the coal strike last month with
a restraining order.
Moody has charged the UMW
president with unfair labor prac
tices for refusing to deal with him
during the last coal dispute.
