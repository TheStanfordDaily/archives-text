plain how it stands on Russian ob-
J structionism.

WASHINGTON, May 18 (UP). —Soviet Premier Josef's Stalin's
offer to "talk peace" on the basis of a program laid down by third
party Presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace drew an emphatic
"no" from the State Department today.
The Stalin overture was rejected even more forcefully than

*that put out by Russian Foreigr.
j Minister V. M. Molotov last week
J after the United States had made r
plain how it stands on Russian ob-
J structionism.
As Secretary of State George C
i Marshall told Molotov then, the de
' partment let Stalin know that the
East-West dispute affects the vita'.
! interests of many nations and can
i not be settled by a private Soviet -
American deal.
BUT ITS FORMAL statemen
| went far beyond Marshall's stit:
language. It blamed Russia direct -
| ly for all the past failures of work'
! diplomacy to reach agreement o:
most of the issues recited by Stalin.
| including international atomic con
| trol.
1 The department said that Stalin';?
expressed hope that a peaceful set
i tlemertt can be worked out is "en
couraging" but that the course o.
action he proposes is not acceptable
The statement was applauded by
Democrats and Republicans in Con
-1 gress, the more so because it addec
■ up to an indirect rebuff of Wallace
whom President Truman fired ir.

I interfering in U.S. foreign policy.
