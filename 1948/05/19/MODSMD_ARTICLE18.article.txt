# CIO Union Set to Join Auto Strike
## 
### 
DETROIT. May 18 (UP)â€”The CIO
United Auto Workers Union warned j
today it is prepared to call out!
225,000 General Motors employees
in 10 days to join 75,000 Chrysler
strikers battling for new wage in
creases.
The UAW, bucking a management
front lined up solidly against a third
postwar round of pay hikes, filed a j
10-day strike notice against GM.'
largest producer of automobiles in
the world.
UNION LEADERS formally noti
fied the state labor mediation board :
that dispute exists between the UAW
and General Motors and that a walk
out of the firm's production impends j
on May 28 when the present con
tract expires.
The UAW warning to GM came
as a strike of Chrysler workers en
tered its seventh day without any
sign that either party is ready to
resume talks and break a deadlock
on the wage issue.
GM and Union negotiators, how
ever, went into another huddle to
day and indicated they would at
tempt to settle their dispute before
the strike deadline.
MICHIGAN STATE troopers pa
troled the gates of struck Chrysler
plants to prevent renewals of picket
line violence. Strikers barred gates
to white collar workers yesterday
at the suburban Highland Park plant
and clashed with police seeking to
disperse them.
Meanwhile, union officials said
they were ready to defy state labor
laws again in the threatened GM
strike as Michigan's Bonine-Tripp
Act headed for a supreme court
test. The law says the state labor
mediation board must conduct a
strike vote of the workers before a
union can shut down plants legally.
Harold Goodman, UAW attorney,
obtained a temporary restraining or
der blocking an investigation into
violations of the Bonine-Tripp law
in the Chrysler strike on grounds
that the law is unconstitutional.
