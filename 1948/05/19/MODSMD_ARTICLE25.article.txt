# High Reg Seen for Summer
## 
### 
A summer enrollment of between
3,000 and 5,000 students is predicted
for Stanford by H. Donald Winbig
ler, registrar.
Mr. Winbigler said that the largest !
summer attendance in the history
of the school is expected by the Uni
versity.
So far, 2,100 presently enrolled >
students have indicated they plan
to enter summer quarter. The bal- j
ance, who are undetermined, will j
comprise those who attend every
summer plus those not matriculated j
who attend classes.
This year, for the first time, the
non-matriculation program is being j
instituted for graduate students and

mature persons with professional
experience who wish to attend
classes but do not seek a degree or
credential.
Today is the last day for summer
quarter upper division students to
obtain seat cards. These and study
lists must be turned in to the reg
istration clerk in the lobby of the
Administration Building before 4:30
p.m.
Lower division summer students
should obtain seat card appointment
slips in the registrar's office before
Friday. Procedure for pre - regis
tration may be found on the back
of the summer time schedule.
