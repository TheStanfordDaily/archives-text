## 'Rich, Indifferent' We 
### 
Say, friend, do you know we're "leisure-loving, fun-pursuing,
and rich"? And that "in this atmosphere of rusticity and remote
ness, minor injustices, minor infringements on personal liberties
are easily forgotten"? And that "once on campus, one has the
feeling of being entrenched and embedded"?
Whether or not you were aware of it, the Stanford student
(he's also politically semi-conscious and has reactionary parents)
would, perhaps, go "across the street to hear a speech, but not
across campus and into town." It's too much bother for us lazy
rich kids who aren't aware of the great class struggle.
So says a young woman from the University of California
who inspected our campus for a few hours last week and then
wrote an article in the Daily Californian on academic freedom
entitled "Stanford Has Little—And Cares Less."
The writer (we presume she is a student rather than a paid
contributor) then goes on for 25 inches to repeat the history of
partisan political activity on the Stanford campus. The old so
phistic argument that "Herbert Hoover campaigned on campus in
2928; why can't political groups meet now?" is dusted off and
served up to the hungry Cal populace.
Several hundred words later our class-conscious writer from
across the Bay says, "Stanford may be financially poor but it is
rich in other things. For example —it is rich in apathy. The oppo
sition to restrictions on civil liberties is small and tinged with
an attitude of defeat. The vast majority of students may occa
sionally wonder over academic freedom —but they merely won
der."
We wonder if she knows that a request has been formulated
tc have the major Presidential candidates speak on campus some
lime this fall—rather than in the street in front of the University
amid a barrage of tomatoes and minor riots.
Not mentioning the fact that at Stanford hashing and other
means of self-support are no stigma and that fraternity or sorority
affiliations are not the basis for a snobbish class system, she con
tinues, "Stanford is also rich in wealthy students. The school is
private; the tuition is high; the political views of the parents, in
general, are channeled to the right." Isn't it appalling to realize
vou're a member of an economic aristocracy? No common men
here at Stanford.
The Berkeley woman is herself amazed as she writes that the
assistant editor (sic) of the Stanford Daily expressed amazement
when asked, "Do Stanford students stage many demonstrations
or man many tables on campus in opposition to such things as
UMT and the political ban?" Apparently we're either politically
indifferent or naive according to Cal standards.
She concludes by quoting the Daily editor as saying the po
litical ban was not unjust. We wish she had talked to us before
quoting us.

would, perhaps, go "across the street to hear a speech, but not
across campus and into town." It's too much bother for us lazy
rich kids who aren't aware of the great class struggle.
So says a young woman from the University of California
who inspected our campus for a few hours last week and then
wrote an article in the Daily Californian on academic freedom
entitled "Stanford Has Little—And Cares Less."
The writer (we presume she is a student rather than a paid
contributor) then goes on for 25 inches to repeat the history of
partisan political activity on the Stanford campus. The old so
phistic argument that "Herbert Hoover campaigned on campus in
2928; why can't political groups meet now?" is dusted off and
served up to the hungry Cal populace.
Several hundred words later our class-conscious writer from
across the Bay says, "Stanford may be financially poor but it is
rich in other things. For example —it is rich in apathy. The oppo
sition to restrictions on civil liberties is small and tinged with
an attitude of defeat. The vast majority of students may occa
sionally wonder over academic freedom —but they merely won
der."
We wonder if she knows that a request has been formulated
tc have the major Presidential candidates speak on campus some
lime this fall—rather than in the street in front of the University
amid a barrage of tomatoes and minor riots.
Not mentioning the fact that at Stanford hashing and other
means of self-support are no stigma and that fraternity or sorority
affiliations are not the basis for a snobbish class system, she con
tinues, "Stanford is also rich in wealthy students. The school is
private; the tuition is high; the political views of the parents, in
general, are channeled to the right." Isn't it appalling to realize
vou're a member of an economic aristocracy? No common men
here at Stanford.
The Berkeley woman is herself amazed as she writes that the
assistant editor (sic) of the Stanford Daily expressed amazement
when asked, "Do Stanford students stage many demonstrations
or man many tables on campus in opposition to such things as
UMT and the political ban?" Apparently we're either politically
indifferent or naive according to Cal standards.
She concludes by quoting the Daily editor as saying the po
litical ban was not unjust. We wish she had talked to us before
quoting us.
Say, friend, do you know we're "leisure-loving, fun-pursuing,
and rich"? And that "in this atmosphere of rusticity and remote
ness, minor injustices, minor infringements on personal liberties
are easily forgotten"? And that "once on campus, one has the
feeling of being entrenched and embedded"?
Whether or not you were aware of it, the Stanford student
(he's also politically semi-conscious and has reactionary parents)
would, perhaps, go "across the street to hear a speech, but not
across campus and into town." It's too much bother for us lazy
rich kids who aren't aware of the great class struggle.
