## Is AVC Communistic 
### 
To the Editor:
The local Stalinists must have been awfully pleased when the Univer
sity allowed them use of Cubberley Auditorium Monday night to "discuss"
the Mundt anti-Communist bill. At present, the Mundt bill is number
one on the Communist hate parade.
One of the speakers on the program represented the Communist-line
National Lawyers' Guild. The other was from the staff of the California
Labor School, described as a Communist "front" by the California Senate
Committee on Un-American Activities. Naturally, the two speakers were
in complete agreement that the Mundt bill is very, very bad.
The meeting itself was sponsored by the American Veterans Commit
tee, a motley collection of extreme leftists and phony liberals. Former
Congressman Will Rogers Jr., who is no reactionary, recently called the
California chapter of the AVC a "Communist-front organization" and a
"defender of Russian tyranny."
The Communists are doing their job well, and the University authori
ties are asleep at the switch. When, oh when, will they wake up?
