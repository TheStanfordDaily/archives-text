ST. PAUL, Minn. (UP)—Harold E. Stassen, 41,
is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in
1948 with the same strategy which elected him gov
ernor of Minnesota when he was 31—taking his stand
on issues and then going to the people at a grass
roots level lor approval.
Stassen said that given the issues, the public would
make the right decisions.
A major tool in his strategy is his own physique,
which he drives unsparingly while on exhaustive
stumping campaigns. Big from the date of his birth,
April 13, 1907, Stassen's six-foot, three-inch frame
was conditioned by a boyhood of farm work. His
parents, truck-gardeners at West St. Paul, Minn.,
relied on him to carry on when his father, William,
was ill for a year.
Opening his political career as Dakota County at
torney in 1930, the year after he was graduated from
law school at the University of Minnesota, Stassen
drew on his farm background in solving depression
born labor strife.
He won an increase in milk prices for farmers who
threatened violence, representing them in negotia
tions after warning he would prosecute them if vio
lence arose. He settled a seething packing house
workers' strike with the approval of labor and man
agement.
In 1929, Stassen married Esther Glewwe, a West
St. Paul neighbor. They now have two childen, Glen,
.12, and Kathleen, 6.
Stassen was only 30 when announced, a year before
state elections, that he would seek the Republican
nomination for governor. Astonished politicians
told him: "Too early; why didn't you wait?" Others
were to tell him the same thing in 194G when he
announced his candidacy for the presidential nom
ination.
People deserted in droves from the entrenched
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. They gave Stassen
a plurality of 291,000 votes and in 1938 Minnesota
found itself with a 31-year-old governor, the youngest
in its history.
Stassen served three terms as governor and made
good on his first political promises. He gave the
state a labor law that cut strikers' numbers by more
than half; reduced the state debt drastically; adopted
civil service for selecting state employes, and reor
ganized governmental administration.
At 33, he keynoted the party's national convention
in 1940, and acted as floor manager in Wendell L.
Willkie's nomination. While still governor, he joined
the navy and became a captain under Adm. William
F. Halsey, serving in the Pacific.
The war over, Stassen waited only to December,
1946, to announce his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for President. It was almost two years
before election time, but he ignored the cries of
politicians that he was "too early."

Starting today The Daily pre
sents a series of articles by the
United Press giving the back
ground of presidential candidates.
Today's candidates are Joseph W.
Martin Jr., Speaker of the House
of Representatives; and Harold E.

nesota.

BOSTON (UP)— Joseph William Martin Jr., House
speaker in the 80th Congress, explained the secret
of mucli of his political success when he said, "every
body calls be Joe because I'm plain as an old shoe."
Son of the village blacksmith, the chunky, raven
haired Martin was born Nov. 3, 1884, at North At
tlboro, one of seven children. He and his 85-year-old
mother and widowed sister still share the old white
clapboard family house there when the genial bach
elor isn't at Washington.
A newsboy in high school, Martin gave up a col
lege scholarship to become a reporter on a newspaper
that suspended six months after he joined the staff.
Later he worked on the Providence (R. 1.) Journal.
But he inherited frugality as well as a slight verbal
burr from his Scottish father. He saved $I.OUO from
his meager earnings and bought the North Attleboro
Chronicle, which he still runs with his brother,
Charles. He fnanced two brothers through Dart
mouth.
Though a staunch Republican, Martin first ran for
his home town school board as a Democrat and was
defeated by 56 votes. Eiyht years later, in 1912, he
was elected representative to the Massachusetts leg
islature and two years later was a state senator.
Martin's election in 1948 marked his 12th House
term and his first as speaker, though he had been
minority leader eight years. His greatest feat, from
a party standpoint, was in 1938 when he managed
GOP strategy and regained 81 congressional seats for
the Republicans.
Generally regarded a conservative, Martin repre
sents an industrial area and his voting has crossed
parly lines. He supported increased workmen's com
pensation legislation, the wage-hour bill, and social
security.
He opposed reciprocal trade agreements princi
pally because of the large North Attleboro jewelry
business. •
Jolly, jowled and personable, Martin has been a
close friend of many political opponents. The late
President Wilson welcomed him as a White House
visitor. He was a crony of the longtime Democratic
majority leader, Sam Rayburn.
When King George VI of England visited the
United States in 1939, Martin, who habitually dressed
in a casual manner, acquired a top hat for the oc
casion. But when he learned Sam Rayburn had no
topper he swapped his finer for the Democrat's
derby.
"He was more important than I am," Martin ex
plained. "I thought he ought to look right."
An avid baseball fan. Martin habitually retires at
10 p.m. and augments his rest with a regular after
noon nap. He does not drink, smoke, nor dance, but
is friendly with many who do.
"I just watch Joe's behavior," he once said. "I fig
ure my friends can look out for their own."

ernor of Minnesota when he was 31—taking his stand
on issues and then going to the people at a grass
roots level lor approval.
Stassen said that given the issues, the public would
make the right decisions.
A major tool in his strategy is his own physique,
which he drives unsparingly while on exhaustive
stumping campaigns. Big from the date of his birth,
April 13, 1907, Stassen's six-foot, three-inch frame
was conditioned by a boyhood of farm work. His
parents, truck-gardeners at West St. Paul, Minn.,
relied on him to carry on when his father, William,
was ill for a year.
Opening his political career as Dakota County at
torney in 1930, the year after he was graduated from
law school at the University of Minnesota, Stassen
drew on his farm background in solving depression
born labor strife.
He won an increase in milk prices for farmers who
threatened violence, representing them in negotia
tions after warning he would prosecute them if vio
lence arose. He settled a seething packing house
workers' strike with the approval of labor and man
agement.
In 1929, Stassen married Esther Glewwe, a West
St. Paul neighbor. They now have two childen, Glen,
.12, and Kathleen, 6.
Stassen was only 30 when announced, a year before
state elections, that he would seek the Republican
nomination for governor. Astonished politicians
told him: "Too early; why didn't you wait?" Others
were to tell him the same thing in 194G when he
announced his candidacy for the presidential nom
ination.
People deserted in droves from the entrenched
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. They gave Stassen
a plurality of 291,000 votes and in 1938 Minnesota
found itself with a 31-year-old governor, the youngest
in its history.
Stassen served three terms as governor and made
good on his first political promises. He gave the
state a labor law that cut strikers' numbers by more
than half; reduced the state debt drastically; adopted
civil service for selecting state employes, and reor
ganized governmental administration.
At 33, he keynoted the party's national convention
in 1940, and acted as floor manager in Wendell L.
Willkie's nomination. While still governor, he joined
the navy and became a captain under Adm. William
F. Halsey, serving in the Pacific.
The war over, Stassen waited only to December,
1946, to announce his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for President. It was almost two years
before election time, but he ignored the cries of
politicians that he was "too early."

BOSTON (UP)— Joseph William Martin Jr., House
speaker in the 80th Congress, explained the secret
of mucli of his political success when he said, "every
body calls be Joe because I'm plain as an old shoe."
Son of the village blacksmith, the chunky, raven
haired Martin was born Nov. 3, 1884, at North At
tlboro, one of seven children. He and his 85-year-old
mother and widowed sister still share the old white
clapboard family house there when the genial bach
elor isn't at Washington.
A newsboy in high school, Martin gave up a col
lege scholarship to become a reporter on a newspaper
that suspended six months after he joined the staff.
Later he worked on the Providence (R. 1.) Journal.
But he inherited frugality as well as a slight verbal
burr from his Scottish father. He saved $I.OUO from
his meager earnings and bought the North Attleboro
Chronicle, which he still runs with his brother,
Charles. He fnanced two brothers through Dart
mouth.
Though a staunch Republican, Martin first ran for
his home town school board as a Democrat and was
defeated by 56 votes. Eiyht years later, in 1912, he
was elected representative to the Massachusetts leg
islature and two years later was a state senator.
Martin's election in 1948 marked his 12th House
term and his first as speaker, though he had been
minority leader eight years. His greatest feat, from
a party standpoint, was in 1938 when he managed
GOP strategy and regained 81 congressional seats for
the Republicans.
Generally regarded a conservative, Martin repre
sents an industrial area and his voting has crossed
parly lines. He supported increased workmen's com
pensation legislation, the wage-hour bill, and social
security.
He opposed reciprocal trade agreements princi
pally because of the large North Attleboro jewelry
business. •
Jolly, jowled and personable, Martin has been a
close friend of many political opponents. The late
President Wilson welcomed him as a White House
visitor. He was a crony of the longtime Democratic
majority leader, Sam Rayburn.
When King George VI of England visited the
United States in 1939, Martin, who habitually dressed
in a casual manner, acquired a top hat for the oc
casion. But when he learned Sam Rayburn had no
topper he swapped his finer for the Democrat's
derby.
"He was more important than I am," Martin ex
plained. "I thought he ought to look right."
An avid baseball fan. Martin habitually retires at
10 p.m. and augments his rest with a regular after
noon nap. He does not drink, smoke, nor dance, but
is friendly with many who do.
"I just watch Joe's behavior," he once said. "I fig

Stassen said that given the issues, the public would
make the right decisions.
A major tool in his strategy is his own physique,
which he drives unsparingly while on exhaustive
stumping campaigns. Big from the date of his birth,
April 13, 1907, Stassen's six-foot, three-inch frame
was conditioned by a boyhood of farm work. His
parents, truck-gardeners at West St. Paul, Minn.,
relied on him to carry on when his father, William,
was ill for a year.
Opening his political career as Dakota County at
torney in 1930, the year after he was graduated from
law school at the University of Minnesota, Stassen
drew on his farm background in solving depression
born labor strife.
He won an increase in milk prices for farmers who
threatened violence, representing them in negotia
tions after warning he would prosecute them if vio
lence arose. He settled a seething packing house
workers' strike with the approval of labor and man
agement.
In 1929, Stassen married Esther Glewwe, a West
St. Paul neighbor. They now have two childen, Glen,
.12, and Kathleen, 6.
Stassen was only 30 when announced, a year before
state elections, that he would seek the Republican
nomination for governor. Astonished politicians
told him: "Too early; why didn't you wait?" Others
were to tell him the same thing in 194G when he
announced his candidacy for the presidential nom
ination.
People deserted in droves from the entrenched
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. They gave Stassen
a plurality of 291,000 votes and in 1938 Minnesota
found itself with a 31-year-old governor, the youngest
in its history.
Stassen served three terms as governor and made
good on his first political promises. He gave the
state a labor law that cut strikers' numbers by more
than half; reduced the state debt drastically; adopted
civil service for selecting state employes, and reor
ganized governmental administration.
At 33, he keynoted the party's national convention
in 1940, and acted as floor manager in Wendell L.
Willkie's nomination. While still governor, he joined
the navy and became a captain under Adm. William
F. Halsey, serving in the Pacific.
The war over, Stassen waited only to December,
1946, to announce his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for President. It was almost two years
before election time, but he ignored the cries of
politicians that he was "too early."

BOSTON (UP)— Joseph William Martin Jr., House
speaker in the 80th Congress, explained the secret
of mucli of his political success when he said, "every
body calls be Joe because I'm plain as an old shoe."
Son of the village blacksmith, the chunky, raven
haired Martin was born Nov. 3, 1884, at North At
tlboro, one of seven children. He and his 85-year-old
mother and widowed sister still share the old white
clapboard family house there when the genial bach
elor isn't at Washington.
A newsboy in high school, Martin gave up a col
lege scholarship to become a reporter on a newspaper
that suspended six months after he joined the staff.
Later he worked on the Providence (R. 1.) Journal.
But he inherited frugality as well as a slight verbal
burr from his Scottish father. He saved $I.OUO from
his meager earnings and bought the North Attleboro
Chronicle, which he still runs with his brother,
Charles. He fnanced two brothers through Dart
mouth.
Though a staunch Republican, Martin first ran for
his home town school board as a Democrat and was
defeated by 56 votes. Eiyht years later, in 1912, he
was elected representative to the Massachusetts leg
islature and two years later was a state senator.
Martin's election in 1948 marked his 12th House
term and his first as speaker, though he had been
minority leader eight years. His greatest feat, from
a party standpoint, was in 1938 when he managed
GOP strategy and regained 81 congressional seats for
the Republicans.
Generally regarded a conservative, Martin repre
sents an industrial area and his voting has crossed
parly lines. He supported increased workmen's com
pensation legislation, the wage-hour bill, and social
security.
He opposed reciprocal trade agreements princi
pally because of the large North Attleboro jewelry
business. •
Jolly, jowled and personable, Martin has been a
close friend of many political opponents. The late
President Wilson welcomed him as a White House
visitor. He was a crony of the longtime Democratic
majority leader, Sam Rayburn.
When King George VI of England visited the
United States in 1939, Martin, who habitually dressed
in a casual manner, acquired a top hat for the oc
casion. But when he learned Sam Rayburn had no
topper he swapped his finer for the Democrat's
derby.
"He was more important than I am," Martin ex
plained. "I thought he ought to look right."
An avid baseball fan. Martin habitually retires at
10 p.m. and augments his rest with a regular after
noon nap. He does not drink, smoke, nor dance, but
is friendly with many who do.
"I just watch Joe's behavior," he once said. "I fig
