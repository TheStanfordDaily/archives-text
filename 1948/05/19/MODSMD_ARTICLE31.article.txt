Rejecting rationing and wage-price ceilings, the
principal Republican leaders in Congress have of
fered their substitute. They propose continued con
trols over exports and domestic transportation and
higher gold requirements behind bank credit and
the currency. This agrees with administration policy

on exports and transport, and in
creased reserves are a time
honored weapon against the ex
pansion of credit.
All together, however, these
measures cannot arrest today's
inflation. Intelligent voters know
that they can hardly slow it.
Therefore, as their big measure,
the GOP planners want to set
aside the anti-trust laws and use
government funds lo obtain vol
untary, industry-wide agreements

to hold down prices.
This is the NIRA of 1933 in reverse, but this en
gine will not run in reverse. It will .stall. Manu
facturers who want to reduce prices will do it more
readily alone than by agreement with their com
petitors, because going it alone gains good will and
competitive advantage.
Adam Smith, the Mo; es of capitalism, showed 171
years ago that such groups do not encourage their
members to reduce prices, but deter them from re

ducing. Smith wrote that business men get together
to restrict trade and raise prices—not to liberate
trade and reduce prices. The Republican scheme
wil not bring prices down but. like the original NRA.
will hold them up after they pass the peak and would
otherwise fall of their own accord.
This proposal is as unconvincing as Senator Taft,
himself. It is a strange thing for Mr. Taft to spon
sor, who was preaching just a little while ago about
the beauties of "natural economic law." It is a
strange thing from the party which praises competi
tion and condemns "unsound economic experimen
tation" of the New Deal. On top of all that, the
Supreme Court may have knocked out the GOP
NRA" when it found the original NRA unconsti
tutional.
Leadership that offers nothing better than this is
intellectually bankrupt. This "program is as futile
as Senator Taft's repeated sermon to "save more and
spend less"—as though most families could' save
anything after swollen living costs, as though a year
and a half of the "Taft Medicine" had not left the
country sicker than it ever was under the OPA.
Iti spite of 14 years of defeat because it would
Hot cope with the boom-and-bust cycle, in spite of
the probationary status in which it was returned to
power in Congress, the GOP offers puny weapons
and a hollow pretext to combat a scourge that already
makes millions of Americans suffer cruelly.

NRA" when it found the original NRA unconsti
tutional.
Leadership that offers nothing better than this is
intellectually bankrupt. This "program is as futile
as Senator Taft's repeated sermon to "save more and
spend less"—as though most families could' save
anything after swollen living costs, as though a year
and a half of the "Taft Medicine" had not left the
country sicker than it ever was under the OPA.
Iti spite of 14 years of defeat because it would
Hot cope with the boom-and-bust cycle, in spite of
the probationary status in which it was returned to
power in Congress, the GOP offers puny weapons
and a hollow pretext to combat a scourge that already
makes millions of Americans suffer cruelly.

Rejecting rationing and wage-price ceilings, the
principal Republican leaders in Congress have of

trols over exports and domestic transportation and
higher gold requirements behind bank credit and
the currency. This agrees with administration policy

on exports and transport, and in
creased reserves are a time
honored weapon against the ex
pansion of credit.
All together, however, these
measures cannot arrest today's
inflation. Intelligent voters know
that they can hardly slow it.

the GOP planners want to set
aside the anti-trust laws and use
government funds lo obtain vol

This is the NIRA of 1933 in reverse, but this en

facturers who want to reduce prices will do it more
readily alone than by agreement with their com

competitive advantage.
Adam Smith, the Mo; es of capitalism, showed 171
years ago that such groups do not encourage their
members to reduce prices, but deter them from re

to restrict trade and raise prices—not to liberate
trade and reduce prices. The Republican scheme

otherwise fall of their own accord.
This proposal is as unconvincing as Senator Taft,
himself. It is a strange thing for Mr. Taft to spon

the beauties of "natural economic law." It is a
