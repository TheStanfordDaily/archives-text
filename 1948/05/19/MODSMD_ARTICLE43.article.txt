The Stanford Polo Association
maintained its string of victories last
Sunday when the team defeated
Sacramento 3 to 1 in Golden Gate
Park.
Playing the preliminary to a
match featuring the San Francisco
and Golden Gate polo teams, Stan
lord displayed its improved team
work and strong offensive to a host
of Peninsula fans. The team this
quarter has won three matches and
tied one.
In the six - ehukker match the
Card team consistently carried the
offense to their older opponents.
Sacramento's desperate efforts to
stave off the attacks were aided by
Stanford's lack of accuracy at the
goal.
However, Raul Grether, at num
ber one, made some beautiful shots
on setups from Bill Decker and
Todd Hclser and scored all three of
Stanford's points. His best shot
came in the fourth ehukker when he
scored on a difficult siice under his
mount. Grether demonstrated the
form that won him a two-goal han
dicap in Argentina.
