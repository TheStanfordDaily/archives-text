# Athletics, Cardinals Increase Loop Lead
## 
### BY JACK BLOOD 
Although rain hampered big league play last week, the Phila
delphia Athletics in the American League and the St. Louis
Cardinals in the National made hay anyhow as they increased
the slight leads in the two circuits.
Connie Mack's Athletics extended their winning streak to 10

games before being stopped by Vic
Paschi and the Yanks. Sparkplug
shortstop Eddie Joost was also
stopped by Raschi's 3 to 0 shutout
after running his hitting streak to
17 consecutive games.
The Boston Braves also picked up
in last week's play. Bill Voiselle
remained unbeaten with four vic
tories and Johnny Sain performed
in mid-season fashion to hoist the
slow-starting Braves into third place.
Tommy Holmes maintained his .400
plus batting average for the Bean
towners.
BEN CIIAI* M A N'S revitalized
Phillies surprised by moving up into
the fourth slot ahead of the sinking
Pirates. Blix Donnelly's twin wins
and rookie outfieledr Bobby Blat
nik's sharp hitting figured in the
lowly Phils' rise.
Sinking out of sight are Mahatma
Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers. With
Dixie Walker, Eddie Stanky, Vic
Lombardi, and others performing in
ohter fields this season, the Bums
have looked pretty sad lately.
Durocher's collection of veterans
and rookies has not been function
ing smoothly and Rickey's boys have
tailspinned into sixth. While it's
too early in the season to be second
guessing, it could be that the shrewd
one has sold the Flatbush flag
chances down the river.
