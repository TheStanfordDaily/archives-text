# Mural Tracksters Race On Angell Field Friday
## 
### JOHN HALL 
More than 100 of Stanford's top intramural track men will get
together Friday afternoon at 4 on Angell Field when Chuck
Taylor presents the 1940 edition of the All-University track and
field finals.
Friday's extravaganza promises to be the most entertaining

track festival that has been held on
Angel! Field this year, as 15 de
cicedly all-Stanford events will be
run off in rapid order.
The meet will get under way a
few minutes after 4 p.m. with the
first track event being the wide
open mile run. No qualifying times
were required for either the mile
or two-mile, so those events are
hard to figure with anything likely
to happen. Each team can enter two
men in the distance races.
LAST YEAR'S defending champs,
the Sigma Chi's, did not fare so
well this season in the prelims as
they placed only four men and a
relay team. Their 880 man, John
Davis, is a winner from last year,
and will be counted upon to keep
the Sigma Chi's in the thick of
things Friday.
Favored to battle it out for first
place honors are the hurdle-strong
Zetes and the Alpha Delts. Speeder
Bob Mclnerney is almost a one-man
team for the Alpha Delts, as he
qualified in the 220. 440, and pole
vault. He is capable of winning all
three events.
The Zeta Psi men are led by
sturdy Bob Iverson who will also
attempt to turn in an iron-man per
formance by running both the high
and low hurdles and broad-jump
ing. Fooballer Wayne Eriekson is
also qualified in both hurdle events,
and will run a leg of the strong Zete
relay team.
DELTA CHI hopes are resting on
the field events where they have
Jim Kurfess in the pole vault and
Winston Mumby in the weights.
They also figure to be close in the
splints with Dick Burnham, and in
the 440 with Tom Kirwan.
Delta Tau Delta qualified more
men than any other squad, placing
men in every event except the shot
put and discus. The Delts must be
considered a threat, although they
have no standouts such ?s Alpha
Delt Bob Mclnerney and Zete Bob
Iverson.
The Delts will be strongest in the
relay, tootbaU throw, and hurdles.
Jack Crahan will be tosisng the foot
ball, and Bob Newell will be duel
ing with Iverson and Eriekson for
the barrier points.
THE BETAS, Phi Delts, and Chi
Psi's all have well-balanced squads
and have qualified enough men to
win. Come - through performances
will probably tell the story.
The individual standouts figure to
be Leonard Collins who ran a 10.4
century in the prelims, Bob Mcln
erney who could be a triple win
ner, and Bob Iverson. Delta Chi
weight-man Winston Mumby should
also be scoring more than a normal I
supply of points.
The relay, which is always the
most thrilling event on the card, ;
will probably turn out to be a three- !
way battle between the Betas. Zetes, I
and Delts.


808 McINERNEY, Alpha Delt
iron man. could lead his team
single-handedly to victory next
Friday in the All-Univei .ity track
festival. Mclnerney will be a
strong contender in the 220. 411),
and pole vault.
