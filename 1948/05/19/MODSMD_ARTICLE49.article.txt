# Troy May Surprise
## 
### 
It will be Stanford against the
rest of the conference this Saturday
when the USC, UCLA, California,
and Farm swimming teams get to
gether at the Encina Pools for the
annual PCC championship meet.
There is little doubt that the
other three squads will be laying
for the defending champion Indians
who have captured the last two
meets, and who have run up an im
pressive string of 33 straight victo
ries, mostly at the expense of their
PCC opponents.
That the Indians have the best
dual meet squad is unquestioned.
Coach Tom Haynie's squad deci
sioned all three opponents during
the regular dual meet season.
But it is difficult to predict how
a team will fare in open competition
on the basis of dual meet perform
ances.
STANFORD has five or six star
performers — enough to carry the
squad through to most dual meet
victories with points to spare. But
in general, the Indians lack the
over-all depth that makes a strong
championship meet team.
USC has a better-balanced squad,
although it c'oes not have the po
tential first-place strength of the In
dians. With points awarded for five
places instead of the usual three,
and with California and UCLA
picking up certain critical points,
the Trojans could easily slip into
the conference championship via the
back door.
An off day by one of the Stanford
swimmers, a miscue in the relays,
or a ''best ever" performance by
one of the invading mermen, and
the Indians might be among the
also-rans.
FREESTYLE!! DON HUGHES.
backstroßer Rube Wolf, divers Har
ry Perry and Tom Hairbedian, and
breaststroke ace Harry Messen
heimer lead the powerful Troy at
tack. The Trojans two relay teams
rank among the best in the country.
Troy's crosstown rivals, the UC
LA Bruins, will bring north several
performers who should make things
easier for the Trojans. The Uclans
will not rank high in the team
standings, but Bob Nelson. Gil Tuf
fli. and Gordy Greeg could eat
heavily into Stanford's critical mar
gin of* points.
The University of California's
squad is built around sprinter Stan
Morketter and diver Jack Lavery.
Other potential Bear point-getters
who will appear at the Farm pools
Saturday are Lee Arth, Jim Rob

PCC opponents.
That the Indians have the best
dual meet squad is unquestioned.
Coach Tom Haynie's squad deci
sioned all three opponents during
the regular dual meet season.
But it is difficult to predict how
a team will fare in open competition
on the basis of dual meet perform
ances.
STANFORD has five or six star
performers — enough to carry the
squad through to most dual meet
victories with points to spare. But
in general, the Indians lack the
over-all depth that makes a strong
championship meet team.
USC has a better-balanced squad,
although it c'oes not have the po
tential first-place strength of the In
dians. With points awarded for five
places instead of the usual three,
and with California and UCLA
picking up certain critical points,
the Trojans could easily slip into
the conference championship via the
back door.
An off day by one of the Stanford
swimmers, a miscue in the relays,
or a ''best ever" performance by
one of the invading mermen, and
the Indians might be among the
also-rans.
FREESTYLE!! DON HUGHES.
backstroßer Rube Wolf, divers Har
ry Perry and Tom Hairbedian, and
breaststroke ace Harry Messen
heimer lead the powerful Troy at
tack. The Trojans two relay teams
rank among the best in the country.
Troy's crosstown rivals, the UC
LA Bruins, will bring north several
performers who should make things
easier for the Trojans. The Uclans
will not rank high in the team
standings, but Bob Nelson. Gil Tuf
fli. and Gordy Greeg could eat
heavily into Stanford's critical mar
gin of* points.
The University of California's
squad is built around sprinter Stan
Morketter and diver Jack Lavery.
Other potential Bear point-getters
who will appear at the Farm pools
Saturday are Lee Arth, Jim Rob
inson, Dale Webster, Don Fisher,
and Chuck Lucchessi.
It will be Stanford against the
rest of the conference this Saturday
when the USC, UCLA, California,
and Farm swimming teams get to
gether at the Encina Pools for the
annual PCC championship meet.
There is little doubt that the
other three squads will be laying
for the defending champion Indians
who have captured the last two
meets, and who have run up an im
pressive string of 33 straight victo
ries, mostly at the expense of their
PCC opponents.
