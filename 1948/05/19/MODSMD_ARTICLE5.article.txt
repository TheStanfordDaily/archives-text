### 
WASHINGTON. May 18 (UP)â€”
. President Truman today invoked the
emergency powers of the Taft-Hart- j
! ley law to head off a threatened na
tionwide strike of long lines tele- '
phone workers.
He appointed a fact-finding board
to investigate the contract dispute
: between the American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., and the American
; Union of Telephone Workers (CIO).
The union originally demanded a
, 30 cents an hour wage rise and about
! 50 changes in working conditions. 1
! The company offered to extend the i
' old contract, which expired May 8. I
| for one year without change or for
two years with one wage reopening.
: The union made a counter-offer to
, extend the contract for 60 days, or :
i for two years with two wage re- !
i openings.
Both have refused to change their <
position.
Under the new labor law, the I
President must make such a dec
laration, and appoint a fact-finding
board, before seeking a court order
forbidding the strike.
