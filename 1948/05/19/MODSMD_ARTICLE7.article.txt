# Air Attack Stuns Israel
## 
### 
TEL AVIV, Israel. May 18 (UP).
— Jewish troops captured ancient
Acre today, but the joy over Israel's
first major military victory was
tempered when 41 persons were
killed and 60 wounded in the war's
most disastrous Egyptian air attack
on Tel Aviv.
A disease-ridden, despairing gar
rison of 3.000 to 4,000 Arabs ran up
the white flag at Acre alter a siege
which began before Israel was pro
claimed. The port city is a strategic
communications link between Haifa
and the Lebanese border, a key to
control of northwest Palestine.
WOMEN AND children were among
the casualties in the Egyptian
bombing and strafing attack on a
bus station in central Tel Aviv.
The first bomb hit near a station
exit shortly after 5 p.m., at the
height of the rush hour. The second
struck a two-deck bus two hundred
yards up the street. The plane cir
cled, strafing the fleeing crowd.
Tel Aviv's first taste of mass de
struction since the Egyptians
raiding the area five days ago came
on the third assault of the day. In
each attack, the enemy bombed and
strafed at random without specific
objectives—except the bus station.
