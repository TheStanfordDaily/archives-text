## 
### 
Sharp criticism of United States;
foreign policy in Latin America was'
expressed last night by Carl B.
Spaeth, dean of the Stanford Law
School.
Dean Spaeth, who spoke at the
Tuesday Evening Series on "Our i
Foreign Policy: Its Latin American
Implications," concluded the last of |
four Tuesday Evening Series pro- j
grams on international affairs and j
American foreign relations.
THE UNITED STATES attitude '
toward South America was con- |
demned as indefinite. Dean Spaeth
pointed out that the United States j
State Department has no officials j
whose main concern is Latin Amer
ica. Instead, he noted, that the
United States concentrates on send
ing military aid and ignores eco
nomic conditions that need reme
dying.
Military equipment, intended for
defense against foreign invasion, but j
too out-dated to be helpful in a j
real war, is used by dictators and
South American countries to fight j
among themselves.
LATIN AMERICAN conditions
have been as bad for years as those !
in Europe since the war and have
made these countries a breeding
ground for communism, Dean Spaeth (
said.
He also criticized the United States '

. for condoning the anti-democrati:
actions of Peron in Argentina when
it has condemned Russia for sim
ilar moves in other parts of tha
world.
Tying in his treatment of Latin
i America with U.S. world policy,
Dean Spaeth urged a positive atti
-1 tude toward the USSR, instead of
I the present defensive stand.

Marjorie Nicholson will speak or.

conclude the Tuesday Evening Series
