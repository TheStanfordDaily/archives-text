# THE 						'HOT WAR'
## U.S. Palestine Plan Stymied by Britain 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. May 19 (UP)â€”Britain and China split with
the United States today and doomed the American plan lor
United Nations intervention in the Palestine war.
Britain, throwing doubt on the legality of the five-day-old state
of Israel, opposed crucial segments of an American proposal for

a cease-fire order that theoretically
could lead to UN senctions against
Arabs, Jews or both.
China, also questioning the legal
right of the Jews to proclaim their
state, supported a move by Britain
to substitute a milder cease-fire pro
posal. It would not open the way
to punitive measures in case either
or both parties refused to comply.
Belgium also came out in favor
of the British version".
AFTER A THREE-HOUR council
meeting, an American official con- |
ceded that the American formula |
did not have a chance, despite sup
port from Russia and the Soviet
Ukraine.
The council adjourned until to
morrow morning, when it was likely
more members would line up behind ;
the British.
British delegate Sir Alexander
Cadogan called on the council to J
study the conflicting legal claims of
the Arabs and Jews of Palestine. He
opposed this move by the United |
States which would brand the Pal
estine warfare a breach of world
peace.
AMERICAN DELEGATE Warren
R. Austin immediately rejected the
watered-down British version, say- !
ing the council had repeatedly failed !
in all its efforts to halt the Holy
Land fighting by means of mild ap- |
peals for peace.
Austin insisted that action must be
taken under the punitive sections of
the UN Charter, which deals with
breaches of the peace and opens the
way to use of economic blockade or
force against aggressors.
Even with Russian support, how
ever, the American maneuver
seemed doomed.
EVEN BEFORE TODAYS council
sessions opened, it was doubtful
whether the American proposal j
could muster the necessary seven
votes.
The British move was especially
important in the light of the foreign
office announcement yesterday that i
Britain would not cut off its large
scale support of Trans-Jordan's!
Arab Legion, and the flow of British
arms to other Arab states unless the j
UN decided the Arabs were acting '
illegally.
