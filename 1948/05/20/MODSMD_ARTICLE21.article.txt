# THAT MAN' AGAIN
## Lewis Walkout Augurs Another Coal Strike? 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 19 (UP).—
John L. Lewis broke up the soft
< oal contract negotiations today,
creating a situation that could re
sult in the second mine strike this
year.
The United Mine Workers chief
tain walked out when the mine
owners voted over his objections to
cive the Southern Coal Producers'
.Association a seat at the conference
table.
He ordered his union wage policy
committee to meet here at 10 a.m.,
EDT. tomorrow to decide the
UMW's next move. The committee
presumably will decide whether to
accuse the operators of violating the
existing mine wage contract which
expires June 30.
Such a charge could signal an
other walkout by the UMW's 400.000
soft coal miners. They left the pits
in March and stayed out for 29 days
when Lewis told them the opera
tors had "dishonored" their con
tract by refusing to negotiate on a
pension plan.
The Southern Association, whose
members produce one-fourth of the
nation's soft coal, immediately filed
charges against Lewis with the Na
tional Labor Relations Board and
asked the board to obtain a court
order forcing him to resume bar
gaining.
