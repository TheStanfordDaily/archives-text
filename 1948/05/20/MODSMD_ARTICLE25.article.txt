# Engineers Make Code
## 
### 
Stanford chapter of American So
ciety of Civil Engineers has drawn
up eight rules for safe driving which
have been submitted to al! their
members, R. C. Clark, president, an
nounced yesterday.
Rule 1 concerns right turns
against a red light. A change in the
1947 Vehicle Code makes a right
turn legal against a red light after
coming to a stop and giving pedes
trians right of way.
Other driving suggestions are:
Any vehicle which is driving at
less than the normal speed of traf
fiee must drive in the right-hand
lane.
It is illegal to pass on either side
when in or approaching within 100
feet of any railroad crossing or in
tersection.
Passing on the right-hand side is
legal within city limits and on high
ways which are marked for four
lanes.
In order to pass a stopped school
bus, drivers must first come to a stop
and then proceed at a speed no
greater than 10 miles per hour.
It is legal for a driver to enter an
intersection against a yellow light
after green, but not so for pedes
trians.
The Vehicle Code requires only
those drivers involved in an acci
dent to stop, render aid, and report
the accident.
Traffic laws apply to persons rid
ing bicycles as well as automobile
drivers.
It is illegal to pass a vehicle which
has stopped for a pedestrian at a
crosswalk.
