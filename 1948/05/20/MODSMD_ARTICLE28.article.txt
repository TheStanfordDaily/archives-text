# House OK's Mundt Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 19 (UP).â€”
The House today passed by a top
heavy vote the Mundt-Nixon Bill
giving American Communist lead
ers the choice of breaking ties with
Moscow or going to jail.
The final roll call vote was 319
to 58. It came after the House had
shouted down all attempts to weak
en the measure or to kill it by send
ing it back to the Un-American Ac
tivities Committee.
Voting for the bill were 215 Re
publicans and 204 Democrats. Op
posed were eight Republicans, 48
Democrats, and two American La
bor party members.
The bill, which now goes to the
Senate, would surround the U.S.
Communist party and its "front"
organizations with some of the
sternest restrictions ever imposed on
a political group in this nation's
history.
It was denounced, during four
days of torrid floor debate, by a
hopelessly outnumbered group of
critics who charged that it is un
constitutional, that it will lead to
"thought control," and that it will
undermine the individual liberties
of all Americans.
It was supported, with equal
vigor, by Republican and Demo
cratic Congressmen who asserted
the act is a carefully drawn and
badly needed supplement to the
government's legal arsenal against
Communist subversion.
Rep. Vito Marcantonio, ALP, N.Y..
who led the opposition, predicted in
the final flurry of debate that the
measure will only serve to drive
real Communists underground.
