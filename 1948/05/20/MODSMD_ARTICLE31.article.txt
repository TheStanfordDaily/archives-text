### 
WASHINGTON, May 1!) (UP) â€”
Secretary of Stale George C. Mar
shall today challenged Russian Pre
mier Josef Stalin to prove his sin
cerity in seeking peace talks by
taking constructive action on 11 spe
cific international problems.
The secretary told his press con
ference that if Stalin really wants to
end the "cold war," his sincerity
would be proven only by the Soviet
Union's future actions in existing
international bodies!
Just before Marshall met the press,
the State Department made public a
point-by-point indictment of Soviet
obstructionist actions on the 11 prob
lems. It accused the Soviet Union
of blocking settlements on each issue,
most of which have been under ne
gotiations in international bodies
since the end of the war.
Marshall said pointedly that, since
the Soviets opened their "peace of
fensive," there has been no sign of
a change in Russian policy on any of
these major issues on which the
United States has slammed the door
to any kind of exclusive Soviet-
American deal.
