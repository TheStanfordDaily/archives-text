## No Politics Here 
### 
What's the scoop on this political partisan business? Is the
ban on such groups meeting on the Stanford campus really such
a terrible case of suppression, a violation of the U.S. Constitution,
and a contradiction to the whole spirit of a university?
A "liberal" staff writer from the Daily Californian visited the
Farm last week and thought so. Certain politically minded stu
dents here have argued along that line since the beginning of
the year.
We agree with those persons in principle. A university is a
place to learn—not only of biochemistry, literature, and higher
mathematics, but of politics as well. Anyone of college level cer
tainly should have the discrimination to be able to digest intelli
gently any and all political speeches and campaign maneuvers.
If politics is to be learned any place, that place should be a uni
versity campus.
So why not allow all kinds of political groups to meet here
at Stanford? Well, look at the results of overt political action at
other campuses—riots, egg-throwing, heckling, violence, and
mob action in all degrees of stupidity. Somehow, no matter how
intelligent or orderly a collection of individuals may be in most
situations, the intense feeling generated in most political meet
ings turns that group into a mob—the same type of mob that
carries out a lynching.
You can't get away from the fact that such is the unfortunate
but true case. The most genteel persons—even college students
•—become violent and unthinking at a political "discussion"
("rally" would probably be a more accurate term).
We don't think such a situation should be allowed to develop
here. In principle, yes, we're against the political ban; but in
practice we think it's a good idea. If you don't think so, just keep
your eye on Cal, USC, and UCLA in the months between now
and November.
