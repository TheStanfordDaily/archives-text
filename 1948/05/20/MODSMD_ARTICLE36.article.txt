# CAMPUS OPINION
## Labor vs. Rural Vote 
### 
To the Editor:
Knowing that the editor both ignores and emasculates letters which
oppose editorial and staff opinion, I hesitate to expend the effort necessary
to again rebut the insidious, partisan, political views of George Brunn.
However, the twisted and warped view of Mr. Brunn concerning the
proposed measure for electing state senators on a population basis instead
of on an area basis needs straightening out.
On May 17, Mr. Brunn supported the move to elect state senators
on a population basis rather than on the present federal plan. If such a
measure were law we would have two houses elected on a population
basis. If that were the case, why have two houses? Would Mr. Brunn
elect the U. S. Senate on a population basis and rob the small states of
a fair voice in national affairs? If his logic is consistent, he would, and
that is what he now wants to do to the citizens of the rural counties.
Brunn seems to think the cities aren't fairly represented. To use his
words, "that is a bare-faced lie." The state assembly, elected on a popu
lation basis, is dominated by San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Alameda
counties, as it ought to be.
The State Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Farmers oppose
the proposed measure, says Brunn. These associations he sarcastically
brands "influential lobbies," I suppose, to prove that the present state
legislature is the tool of capitalists, or something equally inane. The best
thing that can be said for the present system of selecting state senators
is that two such highly respectable and stable groups, representing a
large portion of our citizenry oppose the Brunn-endorsed measure.
Who supports the proposed measure for electing state senators on a
population basis? Brunn didn't tell us that, but the answer is: city union
labor groups and their left wing leaders. (For Mr. Brunn's information,
these groups support the most powerful lobby in Sacramento.) Union
labor is for this measure because by giving the bulk of the senatorial seats
to the big cities, the unions, being a controlling factor in city politics,
could dominate the state legislature. This they could do despite the fact
lhat union labor constitutes a decided minority of the population.
The Brunn-endorsed measure has been on the ballot many times and
has been defeated by a combination of rural and non-union city vote.
Let us hope that the demagoguery of people like Mr. Brunn does not
blind the city voters to the real issue. That issue is: Shall every citizen
(labor, farmer, and business) be represented as they now are, or shall
'.he state legislature be dominated by minority labor groups, as it will
be if the state senators are elected on a population basis?
