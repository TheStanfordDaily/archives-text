Three years ago the four-man Toyon rooms housed
two students for a quarterly rent of $42.50 per man.
Since that time, however, the hall's room capacity
has been doubled from two to four men and rent
raised $10. That is quite an increase. It means
that 100 more men have crowded into the hall and

that they are paying $5,250 to
the University above what it re
ceived three years ago.
I will point out the reasoning
behind each of these steps and
you may draw your own conclu
sions.
First of all, there was no dis
crimination against Toyon men
when rents were raised; all cam
pus residences were pegged with
higher rents.
Secondly, Business Manager

Alf Brandin said added housing facilities had to be
installed in Toyon to meet increased enrollment in
the school after the end of the war.
The last point covers the additional income to (he
University. Part of this money must go towards in
creased water, heat, and janitorial costs. The larger
share, however, was necessitated by a University
wide budget revision that placed a series of expenses
on the dorm residents. Instead of charging hall land
scaping, repairs, and depreciation to the University
budget, the business office transferred those dorm
costs to the individual hall budgets.

Last autumn Encina frosh initiated the hall's an
nual waterbag war against all pedestrians and cars
in the area. The sponsors warned them to stop, but
when the friendly warning showed no results, the
sponsors tagged every man caught throwing water
bags to appear before the hall council. Convicted
waterbaggers were fined by the council.
This council metes out stiff penalties to the frosh
convicted of violating hall rules. Since the council
is subordinated to Men's Council, the convicted frosh
may appeal to Men's Council and even to the Dean
of Students. Fines, if damage was done, and work
hours at the Convalescent ?lome are stiff because
sponsors believe that such punishment will discourage
further violations as well as to emphasize what is
right and wrong.
The hall sponsors direct the council during autumn
quarter. During winter quarter, two freshmen and
three sponsors govern the council. All five council
positions are filled by frosh in spring quarter. The
sponsors have learned by practical experience that
all-frosh administration of the council in the winter
quarter was not satisfactory because freshmen did not
fully understand the council's responsibility to hall
order.
For two quarters, then, the freshmen observe the
council in action. During the winter quarter they
take over the council and guide it on the basis of
what they learned from the sponsors. By the time
the year is over, the freshmen combine observation
with administration of the council, and they are
ready to step into campus life with a fair knowledge
of what student government demands in discipline
from men and women at Stanford.
