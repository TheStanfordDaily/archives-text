Railroads Beat
Public 5:1

There was a time when our railroads symbolized
the growth of a vigorous young nation. They are
still symbolic today, but now they represent the
decline of competition in business.
Unnoticed by the public they have succeeded in
lobbying through Congress the Rced-Bulwinkle bill,

one of the worst pieces of legisla
tion to come out of Washington in
many years. This bill will exempt
the railroads from anti-trust laws,
leaving them free to fleece the
customers as they see fit.
The House of Representatives
gave il only two hours of debate,
and passed it by better than five
to one margin. Truman will prob
ably veto it, but it looks as if both
houses have more than enough
vote to override.

Why is this bill so important? Professor Theodore
Kreps of Stanford s Graduate School of Business says
it is as advantageous to them "as it would be for me
to be exempted from the laws against theft.'' In
theory rail rates are supposed to be set by the ICC
so as to maintain reasonable competition. In prac
tice, rates have been set by agreement among the
companies, with the ICC acting as a rubber stamp.
This has been especially true in the South and
in the West, where the railroads have eliminated all
competition among themselves and established rates
discriminating against western and southern indus
try in iavor of the East. The government has, as a
result, started two anti-trust suits. The direct conse
quence of the Bulwinkle bill would be to force their
dismissal.
The bill would, in effect, legalize such conduct as
the the infamous "Western agreement." Said As
sistant Attorney General Wendell Berge: "The West
ern agreement did more than merely maintain dis
criminatory trade rates. Operating under this agree
ment, the railroads delayed improvement, curtailed
new transportation services, and suppressed propos
als to speed up freight and passenger service."
For example (again quoting Berge), "the Western
Commissioner, appointed by the 35 railroads west
of the Mississippi, was active in getting the Bur
lington to slow down a new freight schedule which
it had put into effect between Denver and Fort Worth.
He was able to persuade the Missouri Pacific to
abandon a proposed freight schedule which would
have put California perishables in New York 24
hours earlier. He was able to secure a resolution by
the railroads designed to prevent the introduction
of a recreation car on a regular passenger train."
Congress approves, five to one. Since the news
papers have written so little that the public is un
concerned, and since it doesn't pay to arouse the
railroads' ire during an election year. Congress ap
proves.
It approves despite the fact that the bill runs
directly counter to all public interests, despite Thur
man Arnold's warning that "exemptions of railroads
from anti-trust laws would lead to similar exemp
tions for other industries and would open the door in
this country to the cartel system."
