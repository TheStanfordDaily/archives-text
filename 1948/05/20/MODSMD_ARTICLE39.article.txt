Well, there's that picture again. It's a nice sort
of face if you're the kind of person that likes that
kind of face.
Frankly, you can win better heads than that on the
Take It or Leave It program. If you're smart, you'll

leave it.
But several people have written
in asking just what the picture
was. Vets in the/ Village with
small children are afraid to take
The Daily home.
For the benefit of the lesser in
formed, that picture, slur it
though you may, is the prototype
of a college student.
A college student (we're still
being informative) is like other
humans only s m arte r. He's
smarter because he has studied

and found out how really little he knows. This is
particularly true of older college students. Some col
lege students never get older.
Nevertheless, the college student is generally be
lieved to be more intelligent than other humans.
College students devote this excess of intelligence to
science, business, world problems, etc., with an eye
toward making living easier. Then the other non
college people won't have to use the brains that they
have less of than the college people. Know what
I mean?
The smarter of the college students study such ob
scure subjects as forestry, plumbing, hotel manage
ment and become millionaires.
Others major in Journalism, enjoy living for a little
while, then starve to death.
College students come in two sexes, made and fe
male.
One of the few good tests for differentiation in
sex is to tell it a dirty story. If it laughs, it's a
female.
The females are usually gaudier, but not always.
Both sexes are noted for their ability to look slop

pier than most people when in their natural habitat.
The females of the species grow up and get mar
ried, provided their mate doesn't find out they're
former college students. Other females merely grow
up and join women's clubs, which are places where
they spill tea, Shakespeare, and politics.
The females (and often the males) are opposed to
socialism and communism although they seldom
know what they are.
They would like to be sophisticated but often mis
interpret the word.
Their favorite beverage is coffee. They also drink
Coke and beer. Only three out of four drink beer
because they like the taste. The others drink it
because it is sophisticated to drink beer. It is also
more sophisticated to drink coffee without cream
or sugar.
Most college students own mechanical devices
called automobiles, and walk as little as possible.
The newer the car. the more sophisticated.
Not all of the species can own new cars. These own
old cars, and the older the better.
Every now and then, college students gather to
select and segregate what they feel are the less ob
noxious of their group. These become known as class
presidents and student officers.
Others become frustrated, make Phi Bete, or write
columns. Seldom both.
Some of the species become so enchanted with their
surroundings, they devote their life to it. These,
known as Ph.D.'s, seldom manage to pry themselves
from the ivy-covered walls. They eventually be
come teachers, called professors, but are actually
students with more experience.
They receive high respect and low salaries.
As a group, college students have high ideals, low
ambitions, and fair-to-middling morals.
They are completely harmless, being the only group
of its size in America without a union.
It is doubtful that the species will ever become
extinct, although many die of ulcers and cirrhosis
of the liver.
