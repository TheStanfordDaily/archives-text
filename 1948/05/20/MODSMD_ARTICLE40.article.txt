# Passionate Plants Produce Madly (And In Broad Daylight, At That)
## Farm Biologists Studying Algae 
### JIM JOSEPH 
One thousand test tubes were
basking under bright fluorescents;
inside them a billion one-celled al
cae were desperately in love—just
why is something Professor Gilbert
Smith, one of the world's authori
ties on marine algae, would like to
know.
After a year and a half's research
he knows that algae just aren't ro
mantic when they're in the dark;
that it takes light to make them seek
a mate. Mixed up in all this is the
"x" factor light, and algae hor
mones. Dr. Smith hopes to extract
the hormones and discover why al
gae love the way they do—under the
influence of light, that is.
HE'S SEEKING a medium now in
which algae can grow to maturity in
total darkness; glucose, he's found,
isn't the answer. But when he dis
covers that medium—and Dr. Smith
is willing to work another two years
at it —he expects to open a whole
new field in biochemistry.
What he has discovered is that
it takes alage three to seven days to
get the mating urge—and that under
the influence of light. But why?
What about hormone development
determines when algae begin to feel
that way about each other?
It took a long time to discover
the two pages of facts which Dr.
Smith says is about all he could
write if he sat down right now to
compile his findings.
Man, says Dr. Smith, wouldn't do
at all for his experiments because
"man is a slow producer and doesn't
produce enough."
LAST SUMMER, as one of four
Stanford scientists probing Bikini's
radiation-struck lagoon, Dr. Smith
found that atom bombing left no
effects on plants or animals. This
conflicts start!ingly with a Cal Tech
researcher who found third- and
fourth-generation mutations in corn
exposed at Bikini.
Dr. Smith had expected to find
"certain monstrous embryos." But
he didn't. An Army-Navy research
board is now piecing together the
jig-saw of facts gathered by vari
ous scientists.
What those findings are must
come from the government. Things
were so secretive at Bikini that
each researcher kept his discov
eries to himself. "I didn't volun
teer any questions," Dr. Smith ex
plains, '"and they didn't ask nie
any."
Dr. Smith was one of three Stan
ford scientists among 30 elected to
the coveted National Academy of
Science in April.
