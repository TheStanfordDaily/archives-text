# Cal Newman, Cars Targets As Encina Waterbags Fly
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Last night the Encina liquid po
tential exceeded its holding capacity
for the first time this year, and"the
waters prevailed and increased
greatly upon the earth."
The entire east wing of the frosh
dorm battled among themselves and
with targets below for nearly an
hour with the customary weaponsâ€”
water bags, paper cups, and rubber
hosing. Cars were forced to deiour
through the Toyon parking lot, lest
they receive the deluge of water
from the upper regions.
The water battle gained impetus
when some Toyon fellow maneu
vered Encina sponsor Ca! Newman's
car into the flooded street. A hun
dred onlookers cheered lustily as
one missile after another washed
the gray Pontiac's dusty surface.
Then the height of * the action

came when four hefty frosh carried
the struggling Newman beneath the
windows. Two well-aimed cups hit
the Honor Code chairman dead cen
ter, after which he was freed.
Sopping frosh scattered into hid
ing as the sponsors "invited" nearly
a dozen fellows to an informal meet
ing in Mrs. Sumner's office. But
while the session was taking place,
another mob fo Encina roughs head
ed for Toyon.
Aiming their offensive at the main
basement fuse box, the '51 invaders
succeeded in darkening the entire
upperclassmen's dorm. After catch
ing a fleeing Toyonite. the excited
freshmen moved toward Roble. The
captive was half-stripped and wrap
ped in a revealing mattress which
was heaved into the main lobby of
the women's dorm.
Soon after, the "law" arrived to
break up the evening's escapade.
