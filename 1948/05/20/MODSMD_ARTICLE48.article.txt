## 
### 
The Firehouse parlayed Bonner
Cox's clutch pitching and Ernie
Webb's speed on the basepaths to
notch a 3 to 2 victory over the ATOs
:n an 11-inning intramural sol thai 1
game yesterday.
Jack Bradshaw, star ATO hurler,
only allowed the fireman two solid
basehits while striking out 23, hut
the winners bunched their hits to
win the tight contest.
AS A Result of their victory,
the firmen lead the double-elimina
tion round robin playoff which will
decide the campus softball champ
ionship. The ATOs remain in the
playoffs, but another defeat would
drop them from contention.
Today's game pits the ATOs
against the Phi Psis beginning at
4:30 on the mural softball fields.
The end came suddenly for Brad
shaw's beautifully pitched game
when he isued his first walk to Webb
as the first man up in the top of
the 11th inning. Webb proceeded
to steal second and third bases under
the frantic pages of Alph catcher
Bob Masters.
BIIADSIIAW steadied his game to
strike out the next man for the

first out, but Frank Pfyl popped
beyond second base for out No. 2 and
Webb scored after the catch.
The fraternity men threatened in
the last of the inning when an error
put Clem Dummett on first with no
outs. Cox brushed away the chal
lenge of the next two batters and
handled the final out himself for the
victory.
The Firehouse twirler struck out
nine ATOs and allowed eitfht bingles
but always had the game under con
trol except for a shaky seventh in
ning, when the Alphs scored all
their runs.
Bradshaw started the lucky sev
enth rally with a double to left cen
terfield. He completed the circuit a
moment later when Don Lemmon
line<t"?i single to right field.
The rightfielder shadowboxed the
ball, Lemmon continued to third
base. Dummett's chip-shot to right
countered Lemmon and the game
went into extra innings.
AFTER THE SUDDEN two-run
outburst, the ATOs' offensive sub
sided under the crafty pitching of
Cox. Firehouse strategy paid off
twice as Cox intentionally walked
Bradshaw and then disposed of the
next batter to end the eighth and
ninth innings.
