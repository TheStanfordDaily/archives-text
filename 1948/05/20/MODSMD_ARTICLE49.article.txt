# Cindermen to Compete in South
## Modesto Relays Run Saturday 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
The final lap of the 1948 Pacific
Coast track season will get under
way this weekend with the Los An
geles Coliseum Relays on Friday, the
Modesto Relays on Saturday, and
the PCC the following Saturday.
Six Stanford tracksters will fly
down to Los Angeles on Friday to
compete in the Coliseum Relays.
They are Otis Chandler in the shot,
Bill Larson in the pole vault, Bud
field in the javelin, Larry Hoff in
the quarter mile, and Downing Mc-
Kee and Darrell Kreitz in the hur
dles.
THESE SIX MEN will also com
pete in the Modesto Relays the next
day, along with the full Indian
squad, with the exception of the
injured Gay Bryan and Steve Mc-
Kee. The Cards came in fifth in
the West Coast Relays at Fresno last
weekend, but with a few come
through performances they could
grab the meet.
The Indians led in the collegiate
division at Fresno for over one-half
of the meet. From this point on
they did not score. If Larry Hoff
is in top shape, the mile relay team
will be fairly sure of taking a high
place. Our field men could easily
place high in the running from their
past performances this season.
It was announced recently that
Harry Likens, San Jose State's ace
javelin thrower, had quit track for
the remainder of the season. Likens
look a strong second place in the
Fresno Relays behind Dr. Steve Sey
mour of the LAAC.
SINCE LIKENS is finished for the
season, it moves Bud Held, who
threw 213 feet for the Cards in the
same meet, up to second man on
the Coast. Held is right up among
the top javelin men of the nation,
and will receive a further test at
Modesto.
Darrell Kreitz and Downing Mc-
Kee will get two chances this week
end to race UCLA's ace, Craig Dix
on. At Fresno last Saturday, Dixon
fell on the last hurdle, as Kreitz
and McKee breezed in one-two.
Whether the two Indian Hashes can
do it again remains to be seen.

look a strong second place in the
Fresno Relays behind Dr. Steve Sey
mour of the LAAC.
SINCE LIKENS is finished for the
season, it moves Bud Held, who
threw 213 feet for the Cards in the
same meet, up to second man on
the Coast. Held is right up among
the top javelin men of the nation,
and will receive a further test at
Modesto.
Darrell Kreitz and Downing Mc-
Kee will get two chances this week
end to race UCLA's ace, Craig Dix
on. At Fresno last Saturday, Dixon
fell on the last hurdle, as Kreitz
and McKee breezed in one-two.
Whether the two Indian Hashes can
do it again remains to be seen.

The final lap of the 1948 Pacific
Coast track season will get under
way this weekend with the Los An
geles Coliseum Relays on Friday, the
Modesto Relays on Saturday, and
the PCC the following Saturday.
Six Stanford tracksters will fly
down to Los Angeles on Friday to
compete in the Coliseum Relays.
They are Otis Chandler in the shot,
Bill Larson in the pole vault, Bud
field in the javelin, Larry Hoff in
the quarter mile, and Downing Mc-
Kee and Darrell Kreitz in the hur
dles.
THESE SIX MEN will also com
pete in the Modesto Relays the next
day, along with the full Indian
squad, with the exception of the
injured Gay Bryan and Steve Mc-
Kee. The Cards came in fifth in
the West Coast Relays at Fresno last
weekend, but with a few come
through performances they could
grab the meet.
The Indians led in the collegiate
division at Fresno for over one-half
of the meet. From this point on
they did not score. If Larry Hoff
is in top shape, the mile relay team
will be fairly sure of taking a high
place. Our field men could easily
place high in the running from their
past performances this season.
It was announced recently that
Harry Likens, San Jose State's ace
javelin thrower, had quit track for
the remainder of the season. Likens
look a strong second place in the
Fresno Relays behind Dr. Steve Sey
mour of the LAAC.
