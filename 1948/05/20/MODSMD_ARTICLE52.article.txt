# DAHLE HURLS TODAY
## Indian Baseball Team Fights to Avoid Cellar 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Twice rained out of contests with
St. Mary's, Stanford's tired base- j
bailers will travel to Moraga this |
afternoon to take on the Gaels in
the CIBA's battle of the basement.
It will be the first time this season
that the two teams have met.
Lefty Dave Dahle who lost a close
six-hitter to USC last week will be
on the mound for Stanford. Dahle
has won two games this season, both
against UCLA. He should be able
to handle the cellar-dwelling St.
Mary's men without too much trou
ble.
COACH JOHNNY VERGEZ and
his s 1 o we d-down-to-a-standstill i
Gaels have been kicked around by
every team on the Coast, but they j
have managed to eke out wins over ,
Santa Clara and UCLA. And if they
can beat those two teams, they can ;
beat Stanford.
Caroll Canfield will pitch for the
Gaels. He is the only St. Mary's j
hurler who has been able to win J
consistently this season. Minus Her- j
man Wedemeyer, the Moraga men's j
offensive punch has been almost
completely nil this year.
STAN F O R I)'S SEASON record
stands now at four wins and eight
losses, which is several paces ahead j
of the Gaels, who have two wins and j
nine losses. The Cards should add
up three straight wins against the
Gaels.
They will play a single game today j
at Moraga and then will finish up
the season with a double-header
against St. Mary's next Saturday on
the Sunken Diamond.
Stanford has a good hustling ball
club, although the loop standings
don't show it. When not making
errors and when getting the pitch
ing, the varsity is as good as any !
team in the league.
CHARLIE COLE'S consistent bat
work has continued for nine con
secutive games. Cole is leading the
Indians and most of the CIBA hit
ters with a .382 average. The three
game series with the Gaels ought
to serve as a good springboard for

him to bounce into the top batting
spot in the circuit.
Bob Nava, hitting .319 after driv
ing out four hits against USC last
week, and Dave Melton (.318) are
the only other .300 hitters on the
squad.
FOUL TIPS . . . USC has already
cinched the CIBA crown, so Tro
jan coach Sam Barry can start smil
ing again. He hasn't shown his
teeth except to growl since Clint
Evans beat him out for the title
last year. Evans took his Bears all
the way to the national title. If Bar
ry can do the same, it'll be mainly
because of Troy's work-horse pitch
er, Wally Hood.
With the league race all settled
cxcept for this final week of com
petition, the all-league selections will
start appearing any time. Stanford's
two serious nominees are first-base
man Charlie Cole and third-baseman
Bill Arce. Cole should be a sure
thing, as he has been a good fielder
as well as leading the team in hit
ting. His .382 average should give
him the nod over Santa Clara's Harv
Christenson.
Bill Arce has been hot and cold
this season. At times he has made
brilliant fielding plays, and other
times he has been just average. He
will probably be outpointed by Bill
Farrari, Santa Clara's third-base
specialist.

Twice rained out of contests with
St. Mary's, Stanford's tired base- j
bailers will travel to Moraga this |
afternoon to take on the Gaels in
the CIBA's battle of the basement.
It will be the first time this season
that the two teams have met.
Lefty Dave Dahle who lost a close
six-hitter to USC last week will be
on the mound for Stanford. Dahle
has won two games this season, both
against UCLA. He should be able
to handle the cellar-dwelling St.
Mary's men without too much trou
ble.
COACH JOHNNY VERGEZ and
his s 1 o we d-down-to-a-standstill i
Gaels have been kicked around by
every team on the Coast, but they j
have managed to eke out wins over ,
Santa Clara and UCLA. And if they
can beat those two teams, they can ;
beat Stanford.
Caroll Canfield will pitch for the
Gaels. He is the only St. Mary's j
hurler who has been able to win J
consistently this season. Minus Her- j
man Wedemeyer, the Moraga men's j
offensive punch has been almost
completely nil this year.
STAN F O R I)'S SEASON record
stands now at four wins and eight
losses, which is several paces ahead j
of the Gaels, who have two wins and j
nine losses. The Cards should add
up three straight wins against the
Gaels.
They will play a single game today j
at Moraga and then will finish up
the season with a double-header
against St. Mary's next Saturday on
the Sunken Diamond.
Stanford has a good hustling ball
club, although the loop standings
don't show it. When not making
errors and when getting the pitch
ing, the varsity is as good as any !
team in the league.
CHARLIE COLE'S consistent bat
work has continued for nine con
secutive games. Cole is leading the
Indians and most of the CIBA hit
ters with a .382 average. The three
game series with the Gaels ought
to serve as a good springboard for

him to bounce into the top batting
spot in the circuit.
Bob Nava, hitting .319 after driv
ing out four hits against USC last
week, and Dave Melton (.318) are
the only other .300 hitters on the
squad.
FOUL TIPS . . . USC has already
cinched the CIBA crown, so Tro
jan coach Sam Barry can start smil
ing again. He hasn't shown his
teeth except to growl since Clint
Evans beat him out for the title
last year. Evans took his Bears all
the way to the national title. If Bar
ry can do the same, it'll be mainly
because of Troy's work-horse pitch
er, Wally Hood.
With the league race all settled
cxcept for this final week of com
petition, the all-league selections will
start appearing any time. Stanford's
two serious nominees are first-base
man Charlie Cole and third-baseman
Bill Arce. Cole should be a sure
thing, as he has been a good fielder
as well as leading the team in hit
ting. His .382 average should give
him the nod over Santa Clara's Harv
Christenson.
Bill Arce has been hot and cold
this season. At times he has made
brilliant fielding plays, and other
times he has been just average. He
will probably be outpointed by Bill
Farrari, Santa Clara's third-base
specialist.
