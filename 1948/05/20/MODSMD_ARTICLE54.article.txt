## Thru Breier's Pipe 
### 
Spring football practice is over and Marchie Schwartz and staff have a
pretty good idea of just how far Stanford will go next year.
As per usual among coaches much gloom prevails. Marchie says that
this spring's drills were the best in all phases that he has conducted 011
the Farm, but alter that the optimism stops, but quick.
the Indians face a 10-game schedule that could see them losing over
half of the contests. The first tilt, that against San Jose State on Septem- j
ber 18. could well end up in a victory for the Spartans. We have tossed
the warning out once but deem it well to repeat—watch out for the
first game!
THE CARDS will be watching out for each and every game for that
matter. Oregon, the second team they meet, is loaded, as is Cal, the last
team to be played. In between they only meet such teams as USC,
UCLA, Army, and Washington. Other and lesser outfits are Santa
Clara, WSC, and Montana.
Perhaps WSC should be listed with the first group as the Cougars will
have a better-than-average team and the game will be played in Pullman.
That's the set up. Bossman Schwartz has every right to fear that his
boys won't bat over .500.
As it looks now, he can field a fair-to-middling first string. After that,
most of the replacements just clo not stand up to the opposition they
will meet.
A FEW INJURIES in key positions could put a set of well-greased i
skids under the whole setup. There are perhaps nine men on the squad
that will be better than or equal to the average man they will play
opposite.
At first glance that last statement sounds pretty good, but further
thought on the mattter brings the gloom bug back. Of those nine, five are
backfield candidates. Only four of them can play at once.
Marchie has not picked even a tentative starting team at this time.
He claims thaf decision will not be made until well into the 13 days
of practice allowed before the SJS game.
This business of a college sports reporter naming a line-up in May
when the coach won't hazard a guess until September, seems to be the
height of something or other, but here goes.
FOR STARTING QUARTERBACK, Don Campbell might rate the call.
But we honestly believe that even the headman himself isn't set on
that position. Tom Shaw looked very good this spring.
Concerning halfbacks it is a case of flip a coin and hope you are l
lucky. Our choices as of this moment are Boyd Benson and Jim Nafziger. '
Fullback? Just pin pictures of Bud Klein and Emery Mitchell on the
wall, shut your eyes, and stick a pin. That is how closely they are
matched. Both are very good.
At the ends, the starters would be Dan Mervin and Ken Rose. For
delense a second pair would be called upon; probably Bob Ghilotli and
Eob Childs, with Don Enberg seeing a lot of action.
PINKY PIILEGER must get the call at one tackle and maybe Gordon
White at the other. But what would you do with A 1 Rau if he is able
to olay? Those are the decisions that are tough to make.
Last year's starting guards must get the nod if through experience '
alone. Jack McKittrick and Don Fix will do. Ted Liljenwall cannot
be forgotten. Movies of two practice scrimmages of spring work show
the big boy doing a lot of work.
In all honesty it must te said that the center position did not get
the help that had been expected from transfers. John Rosekrans, who I
played some varsity ball last year, looks to be the number one hope. j
hut he is not a George Quist when it comes to backing the line. Jim 1
Castagnoli may work in here as may Dick Abraham, but the quality I
does not seem to be there.
There it is. But we would not bet a used Enema eating card that half
of the above men will get the positions as stated.

There has been a lot of talk pro and con about the baseballs being more j
lively this season than before. As far as we are concerned the matter is
settled. Since the '20s when the Sunken Diamond was built, only five
home runs had been hit over the fence.
This season a USF and a Cal ballplayer have added a sixth and
seventh homer, and Bill Prentice's two-baser in the Santa Clara game I
missed by about one foot. There's the answer. In some 20 years only j
five homers, and now two of them this spring'. 'Nuff said.
