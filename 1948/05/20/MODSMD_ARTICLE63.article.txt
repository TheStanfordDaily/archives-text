"Watch out for typhoid. The
State Department of Public
Health reports that four Los An
geles residents have contracted
typhoid fever on visits to the
Mexican vacation resort of Ense
nada since February, and one pa
t'.ent died. Consequently, persons
planning trips to Ensenada are
urged to have their physicians
immunize them before departure.
"The anti-typhoid shot.-, must be
given over a two-week period to
take effect. None of the Los An
geles victims had been immunized.
Travelers visiting any area where
typhoid fever is a known hazard
are advised to avoid eating un
cooked vegetables, including sal
ads, and to drink no water of
doubtful origin unless it is boiled."

prepared to immunize all students
who desire it. Since the series of
injunctions covers a two-week pe
riod, students are urged to start it
now in preparation for summer
travel, Dr. Houck. Health Service
director, has announced.
