# Stanford Proposes UNESCO Train
## 
### 
A UNESCO train of textbooks and
basic educational supplies, modeled
after the Friendship Train of relief
goods, was proposed by Stanford
delegates to the UNESCO Confer
ence at San Francisco last weekend.
At Stanford, for example, text
books could be collected at the end
of this quarter and placed on such
a train. These books would be aug
mented by texts from other schools
and from individuals, and could be
sent to Europe or to China, where
the books are badly needed.
FARM DELEGATES to the Con
ference found the other delegates
already impressed by the scope of
Stanford's international activities.

The Foreign Scholarship and Inter
national Survey plans were espe
cially commended.
The work of the conference was
done in five sections: (1) education,
(2) cultural interchange, (3) com
munications, (4) social and human
relations, and (5) natural sciences.
The 14 Stanford delegates were di
vided so that no more than three
attended any section.
A FOREIGN scholarship plan,
such as recently passed here, could
be extended to other schools and to
communities, delegates pointed out.
Since the exchange rate makes it
difficult for foreign students to pay
their own way. it was recommended

that cities sponsor foreign students
in different American universities.
The complaint was voiced in a
section meeting that foreign stu
dents do not meet many Americans
when they study here. Placing them
in private homes was recommended.
Anyone who can offer summer
housing to such a student is asked
to contact the UNESCO Council
here.
Howard Lockwood, Stanford del
egate, spoke at the college luncheon
at the Fairmont Hotel Friday noon.
Delegates Hardin Holmes and Ginny
Titus spent several hours Friday
night answering questions on Stan
ford's foreign scholarship plan.
