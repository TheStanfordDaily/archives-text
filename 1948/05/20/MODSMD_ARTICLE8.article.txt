# Ness Is Ineligible As Senior Prexy
## 
### 
Excom last night ruled that Gordon Ness is ineligible to take
office as senior class president next fall by reason of not havinc
sufficient units. Excom ruled that Judy Lippincott, senior class
vice-president, will act as president until a new president can bs
elected at the next regularly scheduled election in the fall.
In making the decision Excom pointed out that the constitution

clearly states the senior class presi- 4
aent must have 120 units when he j
takes office. The constitution further i
states that the senior class president
takes office at the beginning of sum
mer quarter.
Ness had 108 units at the start of |
spring quarter. After he was elected,
lie was forced to drop out of school
because of a physical disability, thus
losing the 13 units he would have
added in spring quarter.
After the decision was announced
by Excom, Ness said he intended to
reopen the case, feeling that he had
the majority of his constituents be
hind him.
Excom accepted the Toyon hous
ing report. Under the plan top pri
ority will go to veterans who at
tended Stanford prior to September,
1945. Hardship and physical dis
ability cases must be certified by
Dr. Houck of the Health Service.
Remaining vacancies will be dis
tributed 15 per cent to off-campus,
20 per cent to eating clubs, and the
remaining 65 per cent according to
the following priority:
Men who have resided in the Vil
lage 6 quarters; men who have re
sided in the Village 5 quarters; Vil
lage freshmen; third-quarter Vil
lage and Eneina men in a ratio of
two Encina men to one Village man.
Graduate students have not been
considered.

Students interested in serving on
summer quarter Excom should
sign a card in the ASSU office
this week.

Jack Davies, head yell leader, pre
sented his recommendations for im
proving the status of the yell lead
ers, and Excom distributed the rec
ommendations to various organiza
tions for action.
Davies pointed out the job of head
yell leader is not well defined, that
although the head yell leader is
elected by the entire student body,
he is placed under Rally Com. an
appointed body. He suggested that
the relation between Kallv Com and
the head yell leader be close and
clearly defined, that the head yell
leader be in no way subservient to
Rally Com.

Jack Davies, head yell leader, pre
sented his recommendations for im
proving the status of the yell lead
ers, and Excom distributed the rec
ommendations to various organiza
tions for action.
Davies pointed out the job of head
yell leader is not well defined, that
although the head yell leader is
elected by the entire student body,
he is placed under Rally Com. an
appointed body. He suggested that
the relation between Kallv Com and
the head yell leader be close and
clearly defined, that the head yell
leader be in no way subservient to
Rally Com.
Sharon Nuss was approved as

what was stated last week, Excom
announced following a joint meet
ing of the two groups.
Excom last night ruled that Gordon Ness is ineligible to take
office as senior class president next fall by reason of not havinc
sufficient units. Excom ruled that Judy Lippincott, senior class
vice-president, will act as president until a new president can bs
elected at the next regularly scheduled election in the fall.
In making the decision Excom pointed out that the constitution

clearly states the senior class presi- 4
aent must have 120 units when he j
takes office. The constitution further i
states that the senior class president
takes office at the beginning of sum
mer quarter.
Ness had 108 units at the start of |
spring quarter. After he was elected,
lie was forced to drop out of school
because of a physical disability, thus
losing the 13 units he would have
added in spring quarter.
