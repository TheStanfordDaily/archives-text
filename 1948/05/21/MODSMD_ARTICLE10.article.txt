# Toy on Spurns '51 Ultimatum
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Toyon and Encina's feud which
flared up on Wednesday evening has
apparently not been forgotten by
either party. The battle that started
as an intra-Encina watertight, con
tinued in the kidnapping of a Toyon
resident, and ended temporarily
with the depositing of the captive
in Roble's lobby, gained impetus
late Tuesday night.
Two Encina residents were im
prisoned by a Toyon faction, which
was receiving aid from Village re
cruits. But Encina freshmen rose to
the occasion. A public address sys
tem was posted on the fourth floor
of the east wing and was used to
summon aid from frosh roughs.
Nearly a hundred answered the
"call to arms" and mobbed the up
per-classmen's dorm grabbing some
booty consisting of the eating club
banners and El Toro's bull. How
ever, the prisoners had been rushed
into the hills for further treatment.
The frosh have announced that
the eating clubs' articles will be re
turned to their owners if and when
the Toyonites fly their skull and
crossbones flag for 72 consecutive
hours.
"This latest ultimatum will mean
only one thing—a battle those frosh
will never forget," said several Toy
on representatives yesterday.
