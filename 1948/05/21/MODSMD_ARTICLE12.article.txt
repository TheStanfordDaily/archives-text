# New Election By-Laws Approved by Excom
## 
### 
The Honor Code relates only to honesty in academic work,
Excom decided late Wednesday night. Excom gave its opinion
after an interpretation had been asked by Dot Hughes, member
of the Women's Council. The wording of the opinion is:
"Resolved, in the opinion of the Excom the fundamental

standard establishes a general stan
dard for student conduct. The Honor
Code relates only to honesty in aca
demic work. It is neither desirable
nor practicable that the Honor Code
encompass every phase of Stanford
life, nor does the Honor Code place
on each student individually the re
sponsibility for observance of all
University or ASSU regulations."
Excom approved the proposed
changes to the constitution by-laws
in regard to campaign expenditures.
LACKING A QUORUM, the
agenda lasting until after midnight,
Excom postponed until this afternoon
at 4 consideration of the constitu
tion revisions prepared the past year
by June Sword.
Highlights of the campaign expen
ditures by-laws were stated by Ted
Norton as follows:
Candidates must submit expense
accounts the days before both the
primary and final elections. These
accounts must include "al! campaign
equipment and materials and all as
sistance in publicity or any sort
whatsoever from any source what
soever, at the fair commercial cost
thereof." with the exception of per
sonal services of students, private
automobiles, and such personal prop
erty of the candidate and such equip
ment and materials available free of

charge to all candidates as Election
Board may approve.
THE MONEY VALUE of campaign
publicity remains fixed at $15 for
candidates for ASSU president and
vice-president, and $10 for all other
candidates. These amounts were ap
proved by a vote of the student body
in 1947.
Candidates in doubt as to the in
terpretation of the election rules
i may, under the new by-law, get
written interpretations from Election
Board in advance to protect them
selves.
Candidates or others violating the
! election rules can be disqualified
by Excom and punished by the
. Council for Student Control. Vio-
I lations proved to have been wilful
and deliberate can be punished by
council as violations of the Funda
mental Standard.
The full text of the now by-law
will be available in the ASSU office
next week, and it will be published
in the next edition of the Consti
tution and By-laws.

TED NORTON, Excom member,
stated highlights of the campaign
expenditures by-laws at Wednes
day night's Excom meeting.
The Honor Code relates only to honesty in academic work,
Excom decided late Wednesday night. Excom gave its opinion
after an interpretation had been asked by Dot Hughes, member
of the Women's Council. The wording of the opinion is:
"Resolved, in the opinion of the Excom the fundamental

standard establishes a general stan
dard for student conduct. The Honor
Code relates only to honesty in aca
demic work. It is neither desirable
nor practicable that the Honor Code
encompass every phase of Stanford
life, nor does the Honor Code place
on each student individually the re
sponsibility for observance of all
University or ASSU regulations."
Excom approved the proposed
changes to the constitution by-laws
in regard to campaign expenditures.
LACKING A QUORUM, the
agenda lasting until after midnight,
Excom postponed until this afternoon
at 4 consideration of the constitu
tion revisions prepared the past year
by June Sword.
Highlights of the campaign expen
ditures by-laws were stated by Ted
Norton as follows:
Candidates must submit expense
accounts the days before both the
primary and final elections. These
accounts must include "al! campaign
equipment and materials and all as
sistance in publicity or any sort
whatsoever from any source what
soever, at the fair commercial cost
thereof." with the exception of per
sonal services of students, private
automobiles, and such personal prop
erty of the candidate and such equip
ment and materials available free of

charge to all candidates as Election
Board may approve.
THE MONEY VALUE of campaign
publicity remains fixed at $15 for
candidates for ASSU president and
vice-president, and $10 for all other
candidates. These amounts were ap
proved by a vote of the student body
in 1947.
Candidates in doubt as to the in
terpretation of the election rules
i may, under the new by-law, get
written interpretations from Election
Board in advance to protect them
selves.
Candidates or others violating the
! election rules can be disqualified
by Excom and punished by the
. Council for Student Control. Vio-
I lations proved to have been wilful
and deliberate can be punished by
council as violations of the Funda
mental Standard.
