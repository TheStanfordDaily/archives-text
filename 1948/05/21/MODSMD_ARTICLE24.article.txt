# Conference Considers Liberalized Late Leaves
## 
### 
Two modified versions of the pro
posed more liberal social regula
tions plans were presented at Wom
en's Conference yesterday by Nell
Phillips, chairman of social regula
tions committee.
Revisions of the conference con
stitution were also passed. Discus- I
sion on area representation in Worn- I
en's Council was postponed until
fall quarter.
|
PLAN A, as presented, is as fol
lows:
1. First quarter freshmen would
get one 1:30 and one 2:30 each week
j to be taken any time; two 2:30s
j each week, one to be taken during
| the week; one 1:30 floater each week;
and five 2:30 floaters per quarter.
2. Second and third-quarter fresh
men would get one 2:30 each week,
and 15 1:30 floaters per quarter.
3. Sophomores would get 20 1:30
floaters, and 10 2:30 floaters, which
would be separate from the 1:30s.
4. Juniors would get unlimited
1:30 sand 20 2:30 floaters.
5. Seniors get either unlimited
1:30 sand 2:30 or unlimited 1:30s
and 20 2:305.
PLAN B contains the freshman
leaves in Plan A. Sophomores, jun
iors, and seniors would have the
equivalent of unlimited 2:305.
Houses would close at 10:30 p.m.
midweek and at 12 p.m. Friday and

Saturday as at present. However,
any night of the week women could
sign out on leaving house and come
in any time before 2:30 a.m., which
! would be the arbitrary deadline.
Both plans are just suggestions,
Miss Phillips said, and can be modi
i fied when they are brought up to
j conference again next fall. The more
| liberal late leaves would put (he
1 entire responsibility of remaining in
! Stanford up to the women them-
I selves.
A CONFERENCE member also
: proposed that penalties for late leave
violations be tightened up and per
haps put on a cumulative system.
Changing the name of Women's
j Conference to Associated Women
j Students' Cabinet was one of the
main changes in the constitution.
Other changes were making the
I president of Ventura a member of
| Advisory Board, appointing new
1 housing committee members fall
quarter instead of spring quarter;
j changing the name of the Nominat
| ing Committee to Election Commit
tee, and appointment of the chair
men of the Social Regulations Com
mittee by the president of confer
i ence.
| This conference meeting was the
j last business meeting of the year. A
| tea for old and new members will
| be held Thursday.
