## Keep Your Pen Hot 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to Neil McLean's letter of May 18 concerning AHen Bletz's
article on the University of Wyoming, it appears that if anyone has to
"cool down" it should be young Mr. McLean.
McLean states that "the people of Wyoming tire capable of deciding
what 'subversive and un-American' means without help from 'one of our
local bunch of liberals'." They certainly are not very capable of carrying
on their own affairs when they are permitting books that differ in ideology
to be banned from their university. When a college such as the Uni
versity of Wyoming starts these '"Hitler tactics" are we as Americans,
no matter if we hail from Wyoming or New York, going to stand for
that? Something of this nature affects our nation as a whole and anyone
who is willing to take up the torch against it should be welcomed by all.
The tragedy of this whole affair is that supposedly intelligent people,
such as McLean, are shutting their eyes to reality. The cry often comes
from certain people who are faced with the truth and reality, "we can
ti:ke care of ourselves," and "everything will work itself out." However,
these things "don't work themselves out," and if we listened to all the
McLeans nothing would ever be accomplished. But I suppose the truth
hurts some individuals, and the only way that they can combat it is to
start mud-slinging.
No. Mr. Bletz, don't stop your policies of exposing rotten groups and
activities in America. What we do need is more of this; we need more
people who arc not afraid to take the consequences for presenting the
truth and the activities going on behind the scenes. You will always
run into people like Neil McLean who will attempt to smear you and
the facts. It is up to you, Mr. Bletz, and those like you to keep your
"pen hot," for by continually striking out at these groups who foster
prejudices and inequalities can you accomplish your job—that of showing
the true and real facts.
And, Mr. McLean, I believe that it would be wiser for you in the future
to be careful who you accuse of "writing articles in order to win elections."
You certainly are scraping the bottom of your barrel of tricks for the
purpose of slander. If Mr. Bletz's pen ever does "cool" it will be on ac
count of people like you—who depend upon slander, trickery, and emo
tion to accomplish your purpose —who have blackened and dismembered
his name.
