# Corn Patties Instead of Steak

To the Editor:
The Law of Production states that with an increase in capital, there
will be either an increase in quantity or quality of products produced.
We at the Village have a natural tendency to study and observe the
validity of such postulations. This isn't a false assumption because there
isn't one person in the Village who does not feel the strain on his
pocketbook now that his board bill has been raised from an inflation
price to $140.00 a quarter. Now, going back to our law, we naturally
expect an increase in the quality of the food, since very few of us ever
go back for seconds and pay the five cents for the extra bottle of milk
at the coffee stand. All quarter we watched with open eyes and hungry
bellies the change the food was taking. With the exception of "Wednes
day's menus," the meals started out consisting of such foods as meat
pies and hamburgers—ended up today by having corn patties without
corn. Now, I'm not complaining. I was weaned on A rations; b\it I do
want to know the answer to the following question. Were those apple
cider-patties, or is our food being sent to the DPs?
