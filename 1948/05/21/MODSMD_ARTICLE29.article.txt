# The 						Presidential Arena

### 
This is the second of a series
of articles on the political his
tory of the Presidential aspirants.
Future articles will deal with
other Republican candidates as
well as those of the Democratic,
Progressive, and minor parties.
Today the backgrounds of two
Republican aspirants, Governor
Earl Warren of California and
Senator Robert E. Tail of Ohio,
are presented.

SACRAMENTO (UP) —Earl Warren, California's
big, white-haired governor, enters the Republican
national convention strictly as a "favorite son" can
didate. He controls but 53 delegates, the delegation
l'rom his home state.
Warren did not seek delegates in other states and
made no formal campaign.
Warren's vote-getting ability in his home state
was first demonstrated when he won the gover
norship in 1942 from a Democrat, Culbert L. Olson,
although three out of five of the state's voters
were registered Democrats.
His re-election in 1946 made state history. He won
the Republican nomination easily and also captured
the Democratic nomination.
Warren, in fact, has never lost an election. He
started winning them in 1926 when he was elected
district attorney of Alameda County, which contains
the City of Oakland on the east side of San Fran
cisco Bay.
In one case, he sent the county sheriff to prison
for participation in an illegal bail-bond operation,
lie won conviction of a city commissioner for a
paving contract deal.
He decided in 1938 to try for state attorney gen
eral, an important and powerful office in California.
He won, although Democrats were elected to nearly
every other state office that year.
The California governor was born March 19, 1891,
in Los Angeles, of Scandinavian immigrant par
entage. He went to public schools at Bakersfield,
where his father was a railroad shop foreman. He
later was graduated from the University of Cali
fornia and from its law school.
Warren is informal and hearty in his public and
private dealings with people, and doesn't stand on
dignity.
A special seat was reserved for him at the noted
Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena last New
Year's Day. Officials were disturbed when he failed
(o arrive and started looking for him. They found
to arrive and started looking for him. The found
him peacefully sitting on a curb watching the parade.

COLUMBUS. O. (UP)—Senator Robert A. Taft
has had a difficult time trying to persuade the great
bulk of Americans that he is not the cold, precise,
unfeeling man pictured by his opposition.
But both his friends and opponents give him credit
for forthrightness in his views. He does not often
hedge on a question.
Taft's popularity rating in public opinion polls
was never high and it took probably its lowest
slump during the controversial legislative measures
be has whipped through the Republican-dominated
80th Congress.
Labor leaders were aroused to fighting pitch, for
example, over the Taft-Hartley act to put (he brakes
on union organizations. The American Federation of
Labor voted $3,000,000 to campaign for the repeal of
the act, which the labor leaders call a "slave law."
Walter Rcuthcr, president of the United Auto
mobile Workers (CIO), said that before he would
ever reach the White House, "we'll see Taft in hell."
He joked about the rank-and-file members who
picketed his meetings; he posed with girl students at
Lindenwood College in Misouri and with politicians
in informal scenes at clambake-type meetings else
where throughout the country, and he wrote a pam
phlet entitled "My Political Credo."
Taft's seeming inability to develop the glad-hand
technique perfected by such politicians as James A.
Farley perhaps may be due to his background. The
58-year-old Ohio senator was born Sept. 8, 1889, in
Cincinnati, the son of the late William Howard Taft.
The younger Taft was graduated from Yale and
Harvard, and was admitted to the Ohio bar. His
father's name and his own profession, law, marked
him almost at once for politics. He served in the
Ohio house of representatives from 1920 to 192(»,
and in the state senate for one term. 1931-32.
Thereafter, lie fell into an eclipse due mainly to
his lack of political appeal.
But in 1938 he ran for senator from Ohio and the
sparkle he lacked was provided by his wife, Martha
J3owkers Taft, a witty, effective speaker in her own
right. They won hands down over a seasoned cam
paigner.
