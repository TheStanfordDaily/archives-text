## History 1948 A 						Public Swindle— Medical Kickbacks 
### 
For (he past few months I have been hitting cer
tain businesses ahd dealings and labeled them as
rackets in my "History 1948'' column. I have at
tempted to bring to the light and expose the under
handed dealings of car dealers, black-marketeers,
clothing and food lakes, and similar "public swin
dles."

But today I would like to take
off on a racket so dirty and un
derhanded that it makes all other
"shady deals" look rosy. This is
a racket that all of you should
know of and be on the watch for.
This is a racket involving the
medical profession.
From the Veterans' Aministra
tion has come a complaint against
doctors "chiseling" on veterans'
care, and the Veterans' Admin-

istration Medical Director, Dr. Paul Magnuson, has
gone so far as to place the phrase of "rotten skunks'
after the names of those doctors participating in
this great swindle. And the American Medical As
sociation has already called for a long-delayed house
cleaning of physicians who accept rebates, kick
backs, and commissions.
In Los Angeles, where there never seems to be an
end to flourishing rackets, the Better Business Bu
reau has finally been coerced into launching a cam
paign against kickbacks to physicians, and now the
state and even the federal authorities are putting
forth a little effort in the hopes of curbing this
outrage.
The kickback biases the judgment of the physician
by giving him a vested financial interest in referring
his patient to specialists, optical goods stores, drug
stores, laboratories, and surgeons. It is a price gouging
device which makes medical service even costlier.
Thus, it deprives many people of adequate treatment

and soaks the comparative few who can pay the
heavy tariff.
These doctors are not just located in one place. I
mentioned Los Angeles because they are very thick
down there. These "protectors of humanity" are
everywhere—among the rich and poor, in schools and
colleges, and on water and land—always ready and
on the alert to take advantage and rob the public.
These men have no scruples, for the dollar means
more to them than a human life.
Here is the way the pharmacy kickback sometimes
works: The doctor sends his patients to a specified
pharmacy. The pharmacy, in return, pays the physi
cian a fee, which is included in the price the patient
pays for the prescription.
Sometimes the physician writes a prescription in
stead of advising the patient to buy a common drug
by its trade name. The pharmacist transfers the
common drug from the trade bottle to a prescription
bottle, gives it a number instead of a name, and hikes
the price—with the physician's cut in. Pretty sweet
racket, isn't it?
This pharmacy set-up I didn't run into in Los
Angeles, either. There is plenty of opportunity in
San Francisco to see it in full swing. The discour
aging factor in this, though, is that these pharmacists
arc so well protected and covered up that they seem
to be able to refute almost positive evidence. How
ever, this can be traced to the corruptness of some
city officials in certain communities. But that is
another story in itself.
The kickback from optical goods stores is just as
bad, too. Two of the largest monopolistic optical
goods companies—American Optical and Bausch &
Lomb— kickback approximately 50 per cent of the
price of glasses to the prescribing physician. Get
that figure 50 per cent; and I have certified proof
of that figure.
One physician received as much at $21,000 a year
in this way and the Anti-trust Division of the De
partment. of Justice estimates the American public
is gouged of $35,000,000 a year in such invisible fees
to physicians whom they had already paid.
