# Gael, Card Nines Play Two
## Games Scheduled For Farm Diamond 
### JOHN HALL 
Rained out of the St. Mary's game
lor the third time yesterday, Stan
lord s patient diamond specialists
will get in their last licks of the
season tomorrow aiternoon when
they finally get together with the
water-logged Gaels on the Sunken
Diamond.
Stanford will take on St. Mary's
in a double-header, first game be
ginning at 1:30. The Cards have
yet to meet the Gaels this year.
BLASTING 808 NAVA will
probably miss the games. Nava in
jured his leg against Santa Clara
and then aggravated it against USC.
Starting hurlers lor the tribe will
undoubtedly be Dave Dahle and
Dave Stott. Both should find that
St. Mary's is easier to handle than
what they have been used to against
USC and California.
Tomorrow's double - header will
wind up the season if Stanford wins,
as the third game remaining with
St. Mary's would not affect the
standings and would be canceled.
The Cards expect to end the season
tomorrow.
This battle of the basement talk
will be junked if the Cards come
through, mainly because St. Mary's
and UCLA are the two cellar teams.
Stanford has a luke-warm season
record of four wins and eight losses.
SENIORS TED NELL, Frank
MacGraw, and Buck Brownson will
call it a season and a college career
tomorrow. All three have handled
regular jobs this season, and Nell
has captained the team from his
center-field position. Brownson has
he'd down first-string short-stop for
two seasons.
MacGraw played behind all
league Ward Walkup last season
but has backstopped every game
but one this year. His double in the

KSU's sports announcers will
continue their "on the spot" cov
erage of the Stanford baschali
season with a play-by-play ac
count of tomorrow afternoon's
donblohcader with St. Mary's. Don
Gabriclson will be at the mike
when the Indians go after the
Gaels on the Sunken Diamond at
1 :.'>() p.m.

; Cal game was the big factor behind
! Stanford's win.
St. Mary's has been hiding from
I Stanford using the Moraga wet
weather for an excuse. Tomorrow
j the Gaels might get a taste of
I Sunken Diamond wet weather.
George Sloat, veteran flychaser,
will probably be moved to !eft to
morrow to fill in for the ailing Nava
and Clyde Dingfelder or John Clay-
I pool will move into right field. Ted
I Nell will be in center.
THE SAME INFIELD that has
! started almost every game will be
intact again tomorrow. Bill Arce at
J third, Buck Brownson at short, Dave
Melton at second, and all - league
j candidate Charlie Cole will be at
; first, to round out Stanford's somo
' times smooth infield.
It'll be with a strictly ho-hum at

Neither club has anywhere to go.

claim to fame is an early-season
win over their hot rivals, Santa
Clara.
