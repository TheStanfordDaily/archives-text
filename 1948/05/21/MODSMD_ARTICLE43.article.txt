# Swimmers Defend Conference Crown
## 
### BY BILL SWIGART 
Unduly optimistic, some 60 aquatic artists from USC, UCLA,
and the University of California invade the Farm tomorrow with
the intent of knocking the conference swimming crown off ihe
head of the defending champion Stanford Indians.
The 16th annual PCC Swimming and Diving Championships

will be held in Stanford's Encina
Pools tomorrow afternoon at 3
o'clock. Preliminary heats will be
run in the morning beginning at 10.
Encouraged by lack of depth
weakness the Cards have shown
during their dual meet season, the
visiting mermen eagerly foresee the
posibility of splitting up the points
in such a way that either the Cali
fornia Bears or USC Trojans will
slip into the conference champion
ship.
However, the pre-meet dopesters
cio not see it that way. With the
Indians picked to cop seven of the
nine first places, and with "come
through" place wins expected of
Dick Narver, Harry Borchers, Jim
Bradshaw, ancl Ed Fenstad, The
Daily's peerless pickers predict a
Stanford win by a margin of some
22 points.
The Bears and Trojans are figured
to cut each others' throats, tying j
for second place honors with 43 '•

points each, and UCLA is tabbed
! to bring up the rear.
TROY HAS rated the season-long
j pick for second-place honors, but
i recent performances bring the Bears
I up to a tie for runner-up honors
j in the minds of The Daily dope
sters.
Best first-place battles of the day
will be waged in the sprints and
diving events, although competition
for places will be keen in every
event.
FREESTYLERS Bob Andei •son
and Dick Narver will make their
final aquatic appearances for Stan
ford tomorrow. Anderson will be
back for football, but this his last
season of collegiate swimming.
Hardest tryer tomorrow will be
j diver Jim Bradshaw. Bradshaw
needs only a fifth place to make his
! letter, but such gentlemen as Jack
I Lavery, Gordy Gregg, Harry Perry,
j Tom Hairbedian, and Chuck Luc-
I chesi constitute rather fast company.
