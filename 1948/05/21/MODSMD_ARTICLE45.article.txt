## FENCING Cards Host Cal, UCLA 
### 
The fencing squads of Cal and
UCLA will visit the Farm tomorrow
for an all-day meet with Stanford's
fencers. The meet will begin at 10
a.m. in the pavilion. The public is
invited.
Matches are scheduled for three
man teams in each of three weapons,
the foil, the epee, and the sabre.
The foil is a small sword with a
blunted end; the epee is a sword
with a sharp pointed blade, but with
no cutting edge; and the sabre is
akin to the sword, except the blade
is curved.
Stanford will be represented by
Dick Finch, David Evenson, and Jim
Crooker. This year this team has
lost two matches against Cal and
San Francisco State. Cal has a very
strong team with several years' ex
perience.
