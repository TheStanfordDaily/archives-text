# Mural Finals Played Today
## 
### 
All-campus intramural softball
winds up this afternoon with the
playoff game between the Firehouse
and Phi Kappa Psi on the mural
diamond at 4:30.
The ATOs were eliminated from
the playoffs yesterday when they
forfeited the scheduled second-round
game with the Phi Psis. Jim Brad
shaw's pitching arm went ''dead"
and as a result the ATOs dropped
out of the final round with their
second loss in as many days.
Meanwhile, the volleyball crown
will be decided this afternoon as
the Phi Delt Trojans meet the Phi
Kappa Sigma I team for the champ
ionship. The game starts at 4:30
p.m. on the Encina volleyball court.
Phi Kappa Sigma I entered the
finals yesterday by disposing of the
ATO No. 1 team by scores of 15 to
9 and 15 to 10. Dick Pruder and
j Stan Hodge led the Phi Kaps to the
I victory with their sparkling net play.
