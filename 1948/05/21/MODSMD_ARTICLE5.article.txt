### 
The 1948 Stanford Quad will be
off the press and available at the
Quad office at the end of next week.
The $32,000 publication will feature
an Axe theme and boast an original
cover.
Back to pre - war coverage and
size the Quad will contain 41(5
pages, "the largest Farm yearbook
ever published." said Editor Bill
McPherson yesterday afternoon as
he pushed a dusty paste-pot aside
and slipped the last file into the
index.
Included in the book will be the
largest senior section ever to ap
pear, as well as six undergraduate
and three graduate schools. Two
thousand candid pictures and sev
eral duo-tone colored pages add up
to make what McPherson calls "the
best ever."
