# Frosh Cop 'Jolly Roger' At 'Battle of Rossotti'
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The Encina - Toyon conflagration
blazed higher late Friday night
when five freshmen captured Toy
on's skull and crossbones flag. The
"battling five," Tom Wood, Don
Weeden, Chuck Kelly, Carl Steele,
and Jim Ruder, kidnapped the
Toyon vice-president, Chuck Moore,
who was bearing the banner at Ros
sotti's.
Some Toyonites had taken the
"Jolly Roger" to the Farm's most
popular night - spot to get "Pop"
Rossotti's signature on their flag.
The ink had barely dried when the
Entinamen entered. Fighting against
superior odds of 12 to 5, the frosh
snatched the flag and hustled the
bewildered Moore from the build
in". Big Jim Ruder, left to guard
the door, thumped several defend
ers to the beer-garden floor while
his companions were hiding the flag
in the brush.
Thinking the upper - classmen

would retaliate, the "battling five"
played possum for a short time. But.
the Toyon resistance collapsed af
ter the banner disappeared.
The "high - spirited" frosh re
turned Moore to his Toyon abode
and then stowed away the "Jolly
Roger" in the bowels of Encina.
The quintette have added their
names to Pop Rossotti's and have
announced their future plans. En
cina will fly the skull and cross
bones this week for 72 hoursâ€”the
same time as that demanded by the
class of '51 in its recent ultimatum
to Toyon.
