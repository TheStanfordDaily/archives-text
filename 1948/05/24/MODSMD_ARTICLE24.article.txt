# Stanford Elections Attract Relatively High Turnout
## 
### BY MARGIE McKEON 
This year's 57 per cent turnout J
for the ASSU elections had not been
equalled in past Farm elections since
1915 when 58 per cent of 1,200 stu
dents voted. From that time to the
present, turnouts fluctuated, hitting
an all-time low of 28 per cent in
1927. In 1920 elections were of so
little importance that only the first
partial returns were announced in
the Daily Palo Alto.
In almost every election before I
1933, re-votes had to be taken be
cause candidates seldom received ti I
majority vote; however, the elec- !
tions were not officially primaries.
In 1933 the preferential system used j
today was introduced.
IN AN ATTEMPT to unite the
strongly opposed Row-Hall factions, '
students initiated the practice of hav
ing an all-campus election rally in
1936. However, the factions con
tinued to draw up party tickets until
1942 when the caucuses could not
decide on candidates.
While the men were off to war,

j two women succeeded in filling the
J office of president. Until 1944 women
I were not allowed to run for the top
office, but that ruling was temporar
ily suspended. In 1945, one candi
date included a protest that there
wfie too many women in office in
his campaign.
IN ORDER TO DECREASE the
number of candidates, students re
i sorted to the use of primaries to
| eliminate all but four candidates for
; each office for ihe first time in 1947.
I This has added to the efficiency of
j elections and has been retained for
| permanent use.
I Interest in elections has always
. been relatively high at Stanford,
j Even the Farm's all-time low of 28
| per cent is high in comparison with
UCLA's 10 per cent vote in last fall's
student body elections. This interest
has been maintained in spite of the
fact that Farm elections are con
trolled by ASSU constitutional rul
ings which limit election expendi
tures and campaigns.
