# CAMPUS OPINION
## Unbalanced Discussion 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to Jack Middlekauf's letter of May 19 we wish to state that
the unbalanced nature of the discussion of the Mundt-Nixon Bill at the
AVC meeting Monday night was due entirely to the fact that, in spite of
the many invitations extended to persons known to favor outlawing the
Communist party, no one consented to speak in its behalf.
In other words, those of Mr. Middlekauf's persuasion were not so
eager to uphold their viewpoint in free and open discussion as he was
to draw a red herring across the columns of The Daily. We were careful
to explain to Monday night's audience the conditions under which the
meeting was being held, although Mr. Middlekauf chooses to ignore this
fact.
We hope that this statement will clarify the situation to the readers of
Mr. Middlekauf's letter.
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AVC
