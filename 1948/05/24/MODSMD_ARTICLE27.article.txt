# Identify Your Traveler

To the Editor:
Lately it has become very difficult to identify the "communists" from
the Communists. Thanks to Mr. Middlekauf, the task is made very easy.
A Stalinist is:
1. Anybody so labeled by Attorney General Clark . . . or just
anybody.
2. Anybody left of Middle . . . kauf.
At the risk of being called a "Communist dupe," I refuse to accept
Mr. Middlekauf's yardstick, and refuse to help stifle the competition of
ideas and opinions on the free marketplace, where they may be aofcepted
or rejected at will.

P.S. Save the stamp . . . I'm already on Jack Tenney's list.
