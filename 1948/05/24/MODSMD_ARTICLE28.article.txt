To the Editor:
What a magnificent editorial in Thursday's Daily! It stated that "Any
one of college level certainly should have the discrimination to be able
to digest intelligently any and all political speeches and campaign maneu
vers. If politics is to be learned any place, that place should be a uni
versity campus." Yet it further contends that in order to keep a "genteel"
university we shouldn't allow political rallies on campus. It would seem
that the editor is trying to offer further evidence in support of a Cal
writer's charge that we are leading a sheltered existence here. The
hystrical likening of the "mobs" at political meetings to the mobs at
lynchings does much to strengthen the editorial. The inordinate number
of lynchings at political rallies makes this a salient point.
My goodness, let's not let such a situation develop here. As the editor
suggests, let's watch from a safe distance the ugly demonstrations that
are bound to come to Cal, USC, and UCLA in the months between now
and November. And let's keep our own noses clean, yes indeed.

To the Editor:
IN PRINCIPLE justice is wonderful. But think what would happen
IN PRACTICE! The man against whom the judgment is made might shoot
the judge.
IN PRINCIPLE honesty is fine. But IN PRACTICE one might flunk
that test.
IN PRINCIPLE self-reliance should be applauded. But IN PRACTICE
junior might get in with the wrong crowd.
IN PRINCIPLE democracy is noble. But IN PRACTICE one might
have to have all soils of smelly Negro neighbors.
IN PRINCIPLE political freedom has such a fine sound. But IN
PRACTICE all sorts of rotten vegetables might mess one's neat coiffeure.
May I commend you sir for both of your recent editorials. They exhibit
a fine sense of journalism. You should go far. One must always exhibit
high principles, impossible as they are to consider practically. I agree
with you; man is an animal to be stepped upon and sucked on by the
bigger animal, but, of course, one should always preserve one's ideals.
You, sir, have found the best preservative yet. Keep one's ideals pure
and untarnished by vulgar practice. If anyone from another school dares
to call one a hypocrite, a rich idler, if they challenge that wondeful
blissful state of ideals removed from practice and call it APATHY, sneer
at them, and throw all the mud you can. When the girl from Cal spoke to
you, you of course had no idea what was in the original charter about
academic freedom, but that she dared to call you apathetic, sir! You. an
editor of such fine rhetoric regarding such noble ideals. I applaud you for
fighting back in self-defense. You neglected, however, to mention that she
might also be illegitimate.
With you I shall enjoy keeping my eye on Cal, USC, and UCLA. I
also enjoy seeing people make fools of themselves by attempting to prac
tice ideals. Where would the world be today if there were more of them?
There is no better world than what we have right now. I shudder to
think what would happen if more people acted the same way they spoke
of their PRINCIPLES.
I remain, sir, your devoted reader.

a fine sense of journalism. You should go far. One must always exhibit
high principles, impossible as they are to consider practically. I agree
with you; man is an animal to be stepped upon and sucked on by the
bigger animal, but, of course, one should always preserve one's ideals.
You, sir, have found the best preservative yet. Keep one's ideals pure
and untarnished by vulgar practice. If anyone from another school dares
to call one a hypocrite, a rich idler, if they challenge that wondeful
blissful state of ideals removed from practice and call it APATHY, sneer
at them, and throw all the mud you can. When the girl from Cal spoke to
you, you of course had no idea what was in the original charter about
academic freedom, but that she dared to call you apathetic, sir! You. an
editor of such fine rhetoric regarding such noble ideals. I applaud you for
fighting back in self-defense. You neglected, however, to mention that she
might also be illegitimate.
With you I shall enjoy keeping my eye on Cal, USC, and UCLA. I
also enjoy seeing people make fools of themselves by attempting to prac
tice ideals. Where would the world be today if there were more of them?
There is no better world than what we have right now. I shudder to
think what would happen if more people acted the same way they spoke
of their PRINCIPLES.
I remain, sir, your devoted reader.

To the Editor:
What a magnificent editorial in Thursday's Daily! It stated that "Any
one of college level certainly should have the discrimination to be able
to digest intelligently any and all political speeches and campaign maneu
vers. If politics is to be learned any place, that place should be a uni
versity campus." Yet it further contends that in order to keep a "genteel"
university we shouldn't allow political rallies on campus. It would seem
that the editor is trying to offer further evidence in support of a Cal
writer's charge that we are leading a sheltered existence here. The
hystrical likening of the "mobs" at political meetings to the mobs at
lynchings does much to strengthen the editorial. The inordinate number
of lynchings at political rallies makes this a salient point.
My goodness, let's not let such a situation develop here. As the editor
suggests, let's watch from a safe distance the ugly demonstrations that
are bound to come to Cal, USC, and UCLA in the months between now
and November. And let's keep our own noses clean, yes indeed.

IN PRINCIPLE justice is wonderful. But think what would happen
IN PRACTICE! The man against whom the judgment is made might shoot
the judge.
IN PRINCIPLE honesty is fine. But IN PRACTICE one might flunk
that test.
IN PRINCIPLE self-reliance should be applauded. But IN PRACTICE
junior might get in with the wrong crowd.
IN PRINCIPLE democracy is noble. But IN PRACTICE one might
have to have all soils of smelly Negro neighbors.
IN PRINCIPLE political freedom has such a fine sound. But IN
PRACTICE all sorts of rotten vegetables might mess one's neat coiffeure.
May I commend you sir for both of your recent editorials. They exhibit
a fine sense of journalism. You should go far. One must always exhibit
high principles, impossible as they are to consider practically. I agree
with you; man is an animal to be stepped upon and sucked on by the
bigger animal, but, of course, one should always preserve one's ideals.
