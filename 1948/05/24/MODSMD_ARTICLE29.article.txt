Tc the Editor:
Stanford has been generally criticized for living in an ivory tower and
being unaware of world problems. This is not true!
I have come to the campus as an observer and have seen a group of
people in action under the leadership of Erskine Childers that is doing
far more clear thinking in a constructive attempt to create world citizen
ship than the great majority of student organizations.
Congratulations and more power to you!
