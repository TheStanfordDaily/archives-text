To Europe We Will Go
Fifty Stanford students representing International
Survey Committee will go to Europe this summer—
quite an increase over the two men, Bill Fairer and
Lawrence Grannis, sent last year.
Last year's ISC program cost $2,000; this year's
expense will be under $70 for office expenses. But

the 1947 program made the 1948
effort possible in that Farrer and
Grannis secured a general out
line of economic, political, and
social conditions in most of the
countries. The 50 men and
women visiting Europe this sum
mer will travel at their own ex
pense, and they will mail reports
to field co-ordinators in six Eu
ropean areas.
There is another contrast be
tween the two ISC programs.
Last year's was publicized often

in The Daily; this year's ISC planning publicity has
been limited to organizational meetings headed by
ISC Chairman Tom Armstrong in which students
have been contacted to devote a few of their hours
while in Europe to analyzing phases of Continental
life.
In its working plan ISC breaks down into three
parts this year. The first division includes the 50
students "in the field" who will be in close contact
with Europeans in specific areas. These students
will meet the people in bull sessions. Reports of their
discussions will be forwarded to the second division
of the ISC program—the field co-ordinators.
Field co-ordinators will consist of the five or six
students who will receive information from fellow
students in their respective areas for forwarding to
the summer survey committee here at Stanford.
These co-ordinators will reside for the summer in
such areas as London, Paris, Switzerland, the Low
Countries, Italy, and Stockholm.
The third part of the 1948 ISC program will consist
of the five summer survey committee students based
here at Stanford. They will receive all information
from the field co-ordinators and keep the machine
rolling. Along with the field co-ordinators, the sur
vey committee will have to see that the information
keeps coming in. Both of these ISC levels will eval
uate the incoming material.
During the next two weeks ISC will sponsor two
one-hour orientation programs on European condi
tions for any student planning to spend this siimmy
in Europe. Thursday Farrer, Grannis, and Dean of
Students Lawrence Kimpton will advise students on
travel conditions. Farrer and Grannis will base their
discussion on their trip of last year. ISC will dis
tribute a mimeographed report of the European
countries as based on Farrer's and Grannis's findings.
One June 2 Harold Fisher and C. Easton Roth
well, both members of the Hoover Institute and
Library, will outline political economic, and social
conditions of the European countries.
ISC has several objectives behind its program this
year. The committee also has a few points it does not
want from student travelers. ISC is not an attempt
to sell a way of lile or to crusade for any national
cause. Secondly, ISC will not be a medium for
buttonholing Europeans on the street about their
countries. Point-blank approaches only create sus
picion and additional misunderstanding.
The 1948 ISC objectives are threefold:
1. To promote understanding through personal
contact in a period of time critical in world history.
This is not to be a spectacular attempt to put over
ideas. Rather, it is merely an attempt on a small
and limited scale to bring about some semblance of
mutual standing while we still have the opportunity.
2. To create understanding by clearing up mis
conceptions which exist. This can be done on a re
ciprocal basis. Attempting to understand the other
fellow's point of view and to explain our own when
the situation is favorable may lead to more purpose
ful and effective give-and-take.
3. To gather information on a wide scale in many
countries in a natural manner. This information
would contrast attitudes, outlooks on the future, and
feelings on social, political, and economic issues
whenever possible. European and American stu
dents could compare notes to arrive at some fairly
specific or general conclusions.
The Daily will print survey reports this summer.
At present, regional schools which are members of
the NSA are looking to Stanford for leadership on
the project. In the future. NSA with is strong college
affiliations can bring about considerable unity on
such an ISC projcct on a wider scale.

Students Lawrence Kimpton will advise students on
travel conditions. Farrer and Grannis will base their
discussion on their trip of last year. ISC will dis
tribute a mimeographed report of the European
countries as based on Farrer's and Grannis's findings.
One June 2 Harold Fisher and C. Easton Roth
well, both members of the Hoover Institute and

conditions of the European countries.
ISC has several objectives behind its program this
year. The committee also has a few points it does not
want from student travelers. ISC is not an attempt
to sell a way of lile or to crusade for any national
cause. Secondly, ISC will not be a medium for
buttonholing Europeans on the street about their
countries. Point-blank approaches only create sus
picion and additional misunderstanding.
The 1948 ISC objectives are threefold:
1. To promote understanding through personal
contact in a period of time critical in world history.
This is not to be a spectacular attempt to put over
ideas. Rather, it is merely an attempt on a small
and limited scale to bring about some semblance of
mutual standing while we still have the opportunity.
2. To create understanding by clearing up mis
conceptions which exist. This can be done on a re
ciprocal basis. Attempting to understand the other
fellow's point of view and to explain our own when
the situation is favorable may lead to more purpose
ful and effective give-and-take.
3. To gather information on a wide scale in many
countries in a natural manner. This information
would contrast attitudes, outlooks on the future, and
feelings on social, political, and economic issues
whenever possible. European and American stu
dents could compare notes to arrive at some fairly
specific or general conclusions.
The Daily will print survey reports this summer.
At present, regional schools which are members of
the NSA are looking to Stanford for leadership on
the project. In the future. NSA with is strong college
affiliations can bring about considerable unity on
such an ISC projcct on a wider scale.

To Europe We Will Go
Fifty Stanford students representing International
Survey Committee will go to Europe this summer—
quite an increase over the two men, Bill Fairer and
Lawrence Grannis, sent last year.
Last year's ISC program cost $2,000; this year's
expense will be under $70 for office expenses. But

the 1947 program made the 1948
effort possible in that Farrer and
Grannis secured a general out
line of economic, political, and
social conditions in most of the
countries. The 50 men and
women visiting Europe this sum
mer will travel at their own ex
pense, and they will mail reports
to field co-ordinators in six Eu
ropean areas.
There is another contrast be
tween the two ISC programs.
Last year's was publicized often

in The Daily; this year's ISC planning publicity has
been limited to organizational meetings headed by
ISC Chairman Tom Armstrong in which students
have been contacted to devote a few of their hours
while in Europe to analyzing phases of Continental
life.
In its working plan ISC breaks down into three
parts this year. The first division includes the 50
students "in the field" who will be in close contact
with Europeans in specific areas. These students
will meet the people in bull sessions. Reports of their
discussions will be forwarded to the second division
of the ISC program—the field co-ordinators.
Field co-ordinators will consist of the five or six
students who will receive information from fellow
students in their respective areas for forwarding to
the summer survey committee here at Stanford.
These co-ordinators will reside for the summer in
such areas as London, Paris, Switzerland, the Low
Countries, Italy, and Stockholm.
The third part of the 1948 ISC program will consist
of the five summer survey committee students based
here at Stanford. They will receive all information
from the field co-ordinators and keep the machine
rolling. Along with the field co-ordinators, the sur
vey committee will have to see that the information
keeps coming in. Both of these ISC levels will eval
uate the incoming material.
During the next two weeks ISC will sponsor two
one-hour orientation programs on European condi
tions for any student planning to spend this siimmy
in Europe. Thursday Farrer, Grannis, and Dean of
Students Lawrence Kimpton will advise students on
travel conditions. Farrer and Grannis will base their
