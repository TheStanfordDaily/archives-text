X-Ray Television
NEW YORK (UP). — The development of an
"X-ray telescope," which eventually will show an
image of human internal organs 500 times brighter
than the fluoroscope, was announced last week.
The machine, described by Westinghouse Elec
tric Company scientists as the greatest advance in
X-ray diagnosis since the days when X-rays first
were put to utse, now is in tin* laboratory model
stage. Even with the present model the brightness
of images can be increased by five times.
Dr. John W. Coltman, physicist of the company's
research laboratories in Pittsburgh, said the 500-fold

increase in brightness ''should put the image well
within the range of present-day television pickup
tubes."
That means. he said, that the fluoroscopic image
may he transmitted and duplicated at different
points for observation by more than one person
or group.
"It is even conceivable that some day medical
specialists hundreds of miles from the patient can
be consulted and aid in the instant diagnosis of an
internal ailment,'' he said.
