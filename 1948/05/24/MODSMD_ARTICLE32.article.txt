Mundt-Nixon—
A Witchhunt License?
What is this thing called Mundt?
The House of Representatives east itself 319 to 59
into the role of legislative grave-diggers—those who
would lilt the first spade to put American liberalism
underground. Their first attempt: the Mundt-Nixon
Bill.
Not only would the Mundt-Nixon Bill outlaw
Communism, but would hand the Attorney General
dictatorial powers to decide just who and what is a
"front organization,'' and subject to jail sentences up
to 10 years and fines not to exceed $10,000.
Four tests would be used to determine "front
organizations." The fourth test would consider "the
position taken or advanced by it (the front) from
time to time on matters of policy." If the "front
organization" fails to pass any of the four tests
including the last—it would be "reasonable to con
clude" that it is a front organization and subject to
penalties of the law.
By slight stretch of the imagination—or fear—the
Attorney General could prosecute any advocate of
change. Progress in America would be mummified.
The bill describes one Communist method as "the
inciting of economic, social, and racial strife and
conflict." Labor unions certainly incite social and
economic strife. Advocates of fair employment must
necessarily focus upon "racial strife and conflict."
Trust-busters and monopoly beaters stir to the roots
of "economic and social conflict." Mr. Wallace's
third party and the rest could be judged guilty and
sentenced under Representative Mundt's madness.
Mundt is no shining example of Americana him
self. I first met Representative Mundt in 1940 at
Lexington, Kentucky, where he abused the platform
of the non-partisan National Forensic League's con
vention by his isolationism. Mundt is co-founder and
president of the league. He also has a long anil
infamous record as an isolationist. Now he is cast
in a new role as savior of America—and reveals by
his new attitude a strange political phenomenon in
this, the third postwar year.
That phenomenon is the change in color of for
mer isolationists and America-firsters. As arch-iso
lationists, they fostered a kind of American native
fascism—the 100 per cent American variety. Now,
as arch anti-Communists, they are addicted myopics
who believe themselves faced with the choice:
fascism or Communism—and prefer the former.
The first step is the strangling of freedom ol
speech, new ideas, and change of mind.
The Communists have muddled by taking full
page ads to decry the bill, and thus focus it as a
purely anti-Communist move, which fools plenty of
the well-intentioned. It is no such thing. It has
every potential of striking deep at all American
freedom—at any change of any kind.
Last summer in Mexico I received first-hand
treatment by some of our Communist-hunters. I
hitch-hiked a ride on President Aleman's DC-3 after
spending several weeks in the field with our De
partment of Agriculture men fighting hoof-and
mouth disease.
Aboard were two Americans. One was an ex
editor of the Chicago Sun; the other, a one-time
Department of State trouble-shooter. They claimed
they were unofficial, merely friends of President
Aleman s. Actually, they were commie - hunters.
They were not nearly so interested in the new
tractors shown them as in the politics of the Mexican
small farmer.
For two hours of our trip to Mexico City they
inquisitioned me. "Hadn't I seen signs of Commu
nism in Mexico?"
I said I hadn't.
"You don't see very far," the trouble-shooter
said.
I explained that I had come to report the hoof
and-mouth war, not politics. They weren't satisfied.
They couldn t believe that anyone would volun
tarily leave "civilization" to live under sordid field
conditions just to get a story about the work of our
Agriculture men.
So the trouble-shooter had rationalized himself
into confusion and decided that I must be trying to
picture the campesinos as down-trodden farmers
divested of property and cruelly put upon.
But they left satisfied that I was just caper—and
nothing more. As we disembarked at the Mexico
airport, the trouble-shooter hastened over to me.
"We're from G-2," he confessed; "don't print thdse
pictures you have of us."
I told him I'd print the pictures if I liked—that
he'd known all along he was in them. Then he
took my name—said I'd hear from him.
But I didn t. And he wasn't from G-2.
On the other hand, he didn't have the Mundt Bill
behind him. I m wondering if I'd be in jail now if
he had. And just because the stench of rotting cattle
and the plight of the Mexican farmer appealed more
to me than Hollywood cocktails and two-piece bath
ing suits.
What is this thing called Mundt? The first wedge
that will cut deeply into the first ten amendments.

lationists, they fostered a kind of American native
fascism—the 100 per cent American variety. Now,
as arch anti-Communists, they are addicted myopics
who believe themselves faced with the choice:
fascism or Communism—and prefer the former.
The first step is the strangling of freedom ol
speech, new ideas, and change of mind.
The Communists have muddled by taking full
page ads to decry the bill, and thus focus it as a
purely anti-Communist move, which fools plenty of
the well-intentioned. It is no such thing. It has
every potential of striking deep at all American
freedom—at any change of any kind.
Last summer in Mexico I received first-hand
treatment by some of our Communist-hunters. I
hitch-hiked a ride on President Aleman's DC-3 after
spending several weeks in the field with our De
partment of Agriculture men fighting hoof-and
mouth disease.
Aboard were two Americans. One was an ex
editor of the Chicago Sun; the other, a one-time
Department of State trouble-shooter. They claimed
they were unofficial, merely friends of President
Aleman s. Actually, they were commie - hunters.
They were not nearly so interested in the new
tractors shown them as in the politics of the Mexican
small farmer.
For two hours of our trip to Mexico City they
inquisitioned me. "Hadn't I seen signs of Commu
nism in Mexico?"
I said I hadn't.
"You don't see very far," the trouble-shooter
said.
I explained that I had come to report the hoof
and-mouth war, not politics. They weren't satisfied.
They couldn t believe that anyone would volun
tarily leave "civilization" to live under sordid field
conditions just to get a story about the work of our
Agriculture men.
So the trouble-shooter had rationalized himself
into confusion and decided that I must be trying to
picture the campesinos as down-trodden farmers
divested of property and cruelly put upon.
But they left satisfied that I was just caper—and
nothing more. As we disembarked at the Mexico
airport, the trouble-shooter hastened over to me.
"We're from G-2," he confessed; "don't print thdse
pictures you have of us."
I told him I'd print the pictures if I liked—that
he'd known all along he was in them. Then he
took my name—said I'd hear from him.
But I didn t. And he wasn't from G-2.
On the other hand, he didn't have the Mundt Bill
behind him. I m wondering if I'd be in jail now if
he had. And just because the stench of rotting cattle
and the plight of the Mexican farmer appealed more
to me than Hollywood cocktails and two-piece bath
ing suits.
What is this thing called Mundt? The first wedge
that will cut deeply into the first ten amendments.
Mundt-Nixon—
A Witchhunt License?
What is this thing called Mundt?
The House of Representatives east itself 319 to 59
into the role of legislative grave-diggers—those who
would lilt the first spade to put American liberalism
underground. Their first attempt: the Mundt-Nixon
Bill.
Not only would the Mundt-Nixon Bill outlaw
Communism, but would hand the Attorney General
dictatorial powers to decide just who and what is a
"front organization,'' and subject to jail sentences up
to 10 years and fines not to exceed $10,000.
Four tests would be used to determine "front
organizations." The fourth test would consider "the
position taken or advanced by it (the front) from
time to time on matters of policy." If the "front
organization" fails to pass any of the four tests
including the last—it would be "reasonable to con
clude" that it is a front organization and subject to
penalties of the law.
By slight stretch of the imagination—or fear—the
Attorney General could prosecute any advocate of
change. Progress in America would be mummified.
The bill describes one Communist method as "the
inciting of economic, social, and racial strife and
conflict." Labor unions certainly incite social and
economic strife. Advocates of fair employment must
necessarily focus upon "racial strife and conflict."
Trust-busters and monopoly beaters stir to the roots
of "economic and social conflict." Mr. Wallace's
third party and the rest could be judged guilty and
sentenced under Representative Mundt's madness.
Mundt is no shining example of Americana him
self. I first met Representative Mundt in 1940 at
Lexington, Kentucky, where he abused the platform
of the non-partisan National Forensic League's con
vention by his isolationism. Mundt is co-founder and
president of the league. He also has a long anil
infamous record as an isolationist. Now he is cast
in a new role as savior of America—and reveals by
his new attitude a strange political phenomenon in
this, the third postwar year.

airport, the trouble-shooter hastened over to me.
"We're from G-2," he confessed; "don't print thdse
pictures you have of us."
I told him I'd print the pictures if I liked—that
he'd known all along he was in them. Then he
took my name—said I'd hear from him.
But I didn t. And he wasn't from G-2.
On the other hand, he didn't have the Mundt Bill
behind him. I m wondering if I'd be in jail now if
he had. And just because the stench of rotting cattle
and the plight of the Mexican farmer appealed more
to me than Hollywood cocktails and two-piece bath
ing suits.
What is this thing called Mundt? The first wedge
that will cut deeply into the first ten amendments.
Mundt-Nixon—
A Witchhunt License?
What is this thing called Mundt?
The House of Representatives east itself 319 to 59
into the role of legislative grave-diggers—those who
would lilt the first spade to put American liberalism
underground. Their first attempt: the Mundt-Nixon
Bill.
Not only would the Mundt-Nixon Bill outlaw
Communism, but would hand the Attorney General
dictatorial powers to decide just who and what is a
"front organization,'' and subject to jail sentences up
to 10 years and fines not to exceed $10,000.
Four tests would be used to determine "front
organizations." The fourth test would consider "the
position taken or advanced by it (the front) from
time to time on matters of policy." If the "front
organization" fails to pass any of the four tests
including the last—it would be "reasonable to con
clude" that it is a front organization and subject to
penalties of the law.
By slight stretch of the imagination—or fear—the
Attorney General could prosecute any advocate of
change. Progress in America would be mummified.
The bill describes one Communist method as "the
inciting of economic, social, and racial strife and
conflict." Labor unions certainly incite social and
economic strife. Advocates of fair employment must
necessarily focus upon "racial strife and conflict."
Trust-busters and monopoly beaters stir to the roots
of "economic and social conflict." Mr. Wallace's
third party and the rest could be judged guilty and
sentenced under Representative Mundt's madness.
Mundt is no shining example of Americana him
self. I first met Representative Mundt in 1940 at
Lexington, Kentucky, where he abused the platform
of the non-partisan National Forensic League's con
vention by his isolationism. Mundt is co-founder and
president of the league. He also has a long anil
infamous record as an isolationist. Now he is cast
in a new role as savior of America—and reveals by
his new attitude a strange political phenomenon in
this, the third postwar year.
That phenomenon is the change in color of for
mer isolationists and America-firsters. As arch-iso
lationists, they fostered a kind of American native
fascism—the 100 per cent American variety. Now,
as arch anti-Communists, they are addicted myopics
who believe themselves faced with the choice:
fascism or Communism—and prefer the former.
The first step is the strangling of freedom ol
speech, new ideas, and change of mind.
The Communists have muddled by taking full
page ads to decry the bill, and thus focus it as a
purely anti-Communist move, which fools plenty of
the well-intentioned. It is no such thing. It has
every potential of striking deep at all American
freedom—at any change of any kind.
Last summer in Mexico I received first-hand
treatment by some of our Communist-hunters. I
hitch-hiked a ride on President Aleman's DC-3 after
spending several weeks in the field with our De
partment of Agriculture men fighting hoof-and
mouth disease.
Aboard were two Americans. One was an ex
editor of the Chicago Sun; the other, a one-time
Department of State trouble-shooter. They claimed
they were unofficial, merely friends of President
Aleman s. Actually, they were commie - hunters.
They were not nearly so interested in the new
tractors shown them as in the politics of the Mexican
small farmer.
For two hours of our trip to Mexico City they
inquisitioned me. "Hadn't I seen signs of Commu
nism in Mexico?"
I said I hadn't.
"You don't see very far," the trouble-shooter
said.
I explained that I had come to report the hoof
and-mouth war, not politics. They weren't satisfied.
They couldn t believe that anyone would volun
tarily leave "civilization" to live under sordid field
conditions just to get a story about the work of our
Agriculture men.
So the trouble-shooter had rationalized himself
into confusion and decided that I must be trying to
picture the campesinos as down-trodden farmers
divested of property and cruelly put upon.
But they left satisfied that I was just caper—and
nothing more. As we disembarked at the Mexico
airport, the trouble-shooter hastened over to me.
"We're from G-2," he confessed; "don't print thdse
