# Geysers Flood Inner Quad As Auto Hits Fire Hydrant
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
"Don't never mix liquor and driv
ing."
So said John Fort of Alameda at"
f.ny rate, and as one of the two oc
cupants of the car which early Sun
day morning struck a jeep parked
on Lomita Drive near the Geology
corner, knocked it into the middle
of the street, and then leaped the
curb to knock down a fire hydrant
there, he should know.
THE ACCIDENT created a gush
of water six feet which Fire Chief
John M. Marston, sleepy-eyed and
still in his pajama top, was unable
to stop for over an hour.
In the meantime a torrent of wa
ter had swept to the opposite end
of the Quad and back again and
drawn a small crowd of student on
lookers returning to the campus.
It all began in Alameda Saturday
morning when T. Lewis, whose
iriendf call him "Roosevelt" "be
cause he talks too damn much,"
made the down payment on a 1935
Pontiac.
THAT AFTERNOON the Negro
shipyard worker drove to the home
of his friend John Fort and the pair
decided to visit relatives on the
Peninsula.
T. "Roosevelt," however, lost the
address of his local kin, so he and

Fort took to nearby taverns in order
to ponder their dilemma.
Early the nex> morning, just be
fore 2 to be exact, T„ who refused
to permit his friend Fort to steer
the automobile back to Alameda,
turned into Palm Drive and decided
to "open 'er up" on the wide road
that leads to Stanford.
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER T.
"Roosevelt" was given a cell in the
Palo Alto city jail while his com
panion was left at the :cene of the
accident to wonder how long it
would be before he saw Alameda
again.
"T" began to flee in the direction
of Memorial Church after the ac
cident occurred, according to Fort,
but returned to the car when he saw
that his friend had no intention of
doing so.
At 3:15. after an hour and a quar
ter of miniature waterfalls and gey
sers, the water was finally shut off.
FORT HAD ONE final observa
tion to make before leaving the re
sult of his friend's handiwork.
"Man," he said, scratching his
head thoughtfully and surveying
the Pontiac's crushed right fender,
broken headlights, and bent front
bumper and axle, "that T. couldn't
drive that car away from here if he
wanted to."

JOURNAL CLCB will meet today at
4 p.m. in room 320 of the Geology i
building. David A. Phoenix of the
U. S. Geological Survey, will speak.

morning when T. Lewis, whose
iriendf call him "Roosevelt" "be
cause he talks too damn much,"
made the down payment on a 1935
Pontiac.
THAT AFTERNOON the Negro
shipyard worker drove to the home
of his friend John Fort and the pair
decided to visit relatives on the
Peninsula.
T. "Roosevelt," however, lost the
address of his local kin, so he and

Fort took to nearby taverns in order
to ponder their dilemma.
Early the nex> morning, just be
fore 2 to be exact, T„ who refused
to permit his friend Fort to steer
the automobile back to Alameda,
turned into Palm Drive and decided
to "open 'er up" on the wide road
that leads to Stanford.
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER T.
"Roosevelt" was given a cell in the
Palo Alto city jail while his com
panion was left at the :cene of the
accident to wonder how long it
would be before he saw Alameda
again.
"T" began to flee in the direction
of Memorial Church after the ac
cident occurred, according to Fort,
but returned to the car when he saw
that his friend had no intention of
doing so.
At 3:15. after an hour and a quar
ter of miniature waterfalls and gey
sers, the water was finally shut off.
FORT HAD ONE final observa
tion to make before leaving the re
sult of his friend's handiwork.
"Man," he said, scratching his
head thoughtfully and surveying
the Pontiac's crushed right fender,
broken headlights, and bent front
bumper and axle, "that T. couldn't
drive that car away from here if he
wanted to."

JOURNAL CLCB will meet today at

building. David A. Phoenix of the
U. S. Geological Survey, will speak.

"Don't never mix liquor and driv
ing."
So said John Fort of Alameda at"
f.ny rate, and as one of the two oc
cupants of the car which early Sun
day morning struck a jeep parked
on Lomita Drive near the Geology
corner, knocked it into the middle
of the street, and then leaped the
curb to knock down a fire hydrant
there, he should know.
THE ACCIDENT created a gush
of water six feet which Fire Chief
John M. Marston, sleepy-eyed and
still in his pajama top, was unable
to stop for over an hour.
In the meantime a torrent of wa
ter had swept to the opposite end
of the Quad and back again and
drawn a small crowd of student on
lookers returning to the campus.
It all began in Alameda Saturday
