### 
According to an unconfirmed re
port from an unidentified source,
: the National Association of Shoe
Manufacturers has filed a formal
protest with Excom regarding to
day's Frosh Barefoot Day.
Maintaining that the affair will
certainly be injurious to the indus
try, and may even result in a na
tional economic breakdown, the
NASM promises to take the case to
the Supreme Court if necessary to
protect its interests.
Nevertheless, Chuck Getchell,
frosh publicity chairman, says that
things will proceed according to the
original plan.
" 'Wear a bow on your toe'â€”that's
the slogan of today's Frosh Bare
foot Day, and all loyal '51ers are
urged to turn out shoeless," Getchell
concluded.
