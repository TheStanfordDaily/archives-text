# Farm Baseballers Spilt Pair With St. Marys
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Stanford closed out its baseball season last Saturday by split
ting a pair of games with St. Mary's on the Sunken Diamond.
The Cards dropped the first contest, 4 to 1, but came back with
a two-run rally in the last inning to grab the finale, 5 to 4.
Dave Stott was credited with the win in the second game, as

he went the distance giving up only
live hits. Lefty Dave Dahle re
ceived the loss in the first game.
D.-ihle had pitched one-hit ball until
the eighth inning, but errors and
four hits gave the Gaels a big four
runs in the eighth and that was the
ball game.
Dave Melton's clutch hit gave
Stanford the victory in the nightcap.
The Cards were trailing, 4 to 3, when
they went into the bottom half of the
final inning. With prospects of a
double defeat staring them in the
face, Ted Nell started the amend
ment program with a sharp single
to left.
(iFORdli SI,OAT followed with n
double, and Charlie Cole was iriten
tionally walked to fill the bases.
Dick Alquist was safe at first 011 a
fielder's choice as the tying run
crossed the plate. Then Dave Melton
calmly swatted out his game-win
ning drive which carried over the
center fielder's head.
By taking the second game, Stan
ford gained a fourth place in the
final CIBA standings. The Cards
finished a half-game in front of
UCLA and a full game in front of
the cellar champion Gaels. The final
game of the Stanford-St. Mary's ser
ies will be cancelled.
The Indians didn't do much hitting
the first game Saturday as Gael
hurler Carrol Canfield kept things
well in hand. Charlie Cole collected
two safeties to stretch his consecu
tive game streak to 10 in the first
game, but went hitless in the finale.
Cole finished the season with a .367
batting average.
FOUL TIPS . . . USC swept three
straight games from California
and dumped them into third place
behind Santa Clara. For a team
that was figured to be fighting
it out for the pennant, the Bears
did a complete fold in the stretch.
.... The Chronicle's baseball
reporter should get a better way
to select names for the Stanford
players. He consistently calls Cole
by the name of Don, and his latest
blunder was in referring to George
Sloat as George Float. Every time
you pick up the paper you won
der if the lineups have been
changed. . . . Saturday's double
header was the first time this sea
son that Stanford hurlers have
gone the distance two full games
in succession.
