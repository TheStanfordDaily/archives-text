Looking like the champions they

crowd at the Encina Pools Saturday
afternoon.

progressed the Card swimmers con
tinued to roll up a large point mar
gin over the second-place Univer
sity of California.
The final score was Stanford G9.
California 4G. USC 36. UCLA 17.

440-yard freestyle grind, it became
evident that the Indians could not
lose the meet. At this point Ernie
Brandsten, retired Stanford coach,
came forth to present a beautiful
perpetual trophy to Stanford's cap
tain, Bob Anderson.
The trophy will go to the winning
team of each year's conference meet
in Mr. Brandsten's name.
Two new conference records were
set by the Stanford swimmers. Bob
Anderson lowered and then relow
ered his own 50-yard sprint mark,
while lanky Don Hester performed
the same feat in the breaststroke
race.
The great Anderson was never
better. In the morning trials he sot
a new PCC record of :22.9 while
swimming in the choppy outside
lane. Competing under more favor
able conditions in the finals. Bob

clipped a tenth of a second off his i
I four-hour-old mark.
