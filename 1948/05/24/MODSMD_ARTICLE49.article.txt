# Hurdlers Miss Record
## 
### 
Stanford's four-man hurdle relay,
team of Darrell Kreitz, Downing Mc- j
Kee, Skip Kent, and Dell Russell
turned in a sizzling :59.3, just seven- i
tenths of a second off the world j
record mark fit the Modesto Relays |
last Saturday.
The four Card aces might have!
broken the record if Kent had not hit
two hurdles on the first lap.
After placing third in the Coliseum
Relays the night before, Bud Held, !

ace Card javelin thrower, took 3
second place behind Dr. Steve Sey
mour with a toss of 212 feet 1 inch,
Ht'ld made himself No. 1 prospect U
capture the Coast and maybe tho-
National Collegiate meet by his con
sistent throwing over 200 feet.
Besides these two events, Stan
ford performances at the Coliseum,
and Modesto Relays were far below
expectations. The medley relay
team took four place at Modesto*
behind three t}ough teamsâ€”USC,
Olympic Club, and the Los Angeles
Athletic CI iD.
