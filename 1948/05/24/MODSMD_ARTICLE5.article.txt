# Farm Presents 'Grimes' Thursday

### NED SACK 
Con trovers}' still rages over the
modern opera, "Peter Grimes,"
which will receive its third U.S. |
production this week by the Stan
ford Players.
The opera opens Thursday night
at 8:13 in the Memorial Auditorium
and will be repeated Friday and
Saturday nights.
Dr. Jan Popper, associate profes
sor of music and musical director of j
the opera, has termed the interna- I
tionallv acclaimed opera "one of the !
outstanding music - dramas of this j
century."
MUSIC IS USED to enhance the i
dramatic effect in an almost un-i
equaled way. Howard Ross, Los An- ]
geles professional who will sing the J
title part, said that hearing the i
music alone means "absolutely
nothing." But combining the music |
with the dramatic action, it is "soul- ,
stirring" with a terrific dramatic,
punch.

The plot involves a plain fisher- |
man, Peter Grimes, who is falsely
accused of killing two apprentices.
Gossip arouses the fishing village to
mob violence. The hunted Peter ;
finally sails off to die at sea.
Dissonant music is used to reflect
violent passions and the natural
scenery with a strong realism. As
Ross put it, "Waves don't crash
against the rocks in harmony;
they're dissonant."
THE RESULTING RHYTHMS
and intonation make the opera ex
tremely difficult to produce. Dr.
Popper said that it compares in dif
ficulty with the music-dramas of
Richard Strauss.
Typical scenes have the chorus
sing in one key while the orchestra j
plays in another. In Peter Grimes' ,
mad scene, he must sing weird ]
rhythms and intervals, accompanied j
on'.y by the a cappella singing of I
an off-stage chorus and a fog horn.

A special orchestra has been
j formed of the best musicians among
the Stanford students and the finest
1 local musicians, reinforced by a few
! professionals. The 54-piece orches
tra has been termed by Dr. Popper
"the largest and best opera orches
tra in Stanford hisory."
Dr. Popper concluded. "There
may not be any large arias which
will bring thundering applause at
| the last high note, but still the au
dience will realize that everyone in
the large cast carries a great re
sponsibility and has to give every
thing in the way of voice, musician
ship, acting ability, and general in
telligence in these terrific ensembles
and solo passages.
"Passages like the storm scene
, from Act I.the church scene from
j Act 11, and Peter's mad scene in Act
| 111, will go into history as some of
: the outstanding examples of thrill
ing and exciting dramatic music."
