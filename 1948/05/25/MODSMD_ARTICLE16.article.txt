# Stop Those Monsters! Quad Islands to Expand
## 
### BY KEN MOORE 
June, moonlight on the Quad —ah, |
but wait; there's something sinister. I
Those Quad islands, there's some- \
thing! What is it?
When the islands were planted in
1S!)5, they resembled formal gardens
wilh their low shrubs and trees. This
innocent vegetation has grown and
grown; now it has become a de
vouring monster.
Its roots threaten the Inner Quad
itself. The area around the "jun
gles" is twisted and distorted.
THERE'S A CHANCE that the
doom of these Caesars is already in ;
.sight. The Stanford Planning Office
and San Francisco archi
tect, Thomas D. Church, have sub
mitted a proposal for Inner Quad
rehabilitation which would rock the
old jungle regime to its foundations.
Under the proposed plan, the
diameter of each of the eight Quad J
islands would be increased three i
fe«-'t; the trees would be pruned high j
and the smaller vegetation replaced I
by a solid ivy cover. Three paths!
leading to the center of each island
would divide the islands into pie-'
shaped formations.
EACH ISLAND would be sur
rounded by a brownstone wall 12.
inches high and two feet wide with ]
a cement top to be used as a bench. I
The proposed "New Look" can be j
seen in detail at the Planning De- 1
partment exhibition in the Stanford \
Art Gallery. The Planning Office!
states that it is hoped the proposal
will be submitted to the Trustees in |
the near future for approval.
