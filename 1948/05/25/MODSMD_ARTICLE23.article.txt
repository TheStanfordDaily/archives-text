## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, May 24 (UP) —
The United Nations Security Coun
cil today gave the Arab states an
extra 48 hours to decide whether to
join the Jews in a Palestine truce
or to risk the possibility of strong
UN action.
The council gave the Arabs until
1 p.m. tomorrow (EDT) to answer.
TIIE APPEAL for more time to
consider the security council truce
proposal was made by Faris El
Khouri, Syrian delegate and senior
Arab representative at the UN.
The original UN deadline passed
today without any letup in the
fighting.
EL KIIOURI told the council that
the political committee of the Arab
League, consisting of the seven Arab
foreign ministers, had scheduled a
meeting in Amman, Trans-Jordan,
tomorrow to reach a common de
cision on the truce question.
In response to Soviet questioning
as to whether the council could
definitely depend on an Arab answer
by the new deadline, El Khouri said
that this could be "supposed."
ISRAEL'S DELEGATE condemned
the Arab request for more time as
"fantastic"' and an effort to gain time
to improve their military position,
but no council member raised serious
objection to the Arab request.
El Khouri immediately won sup
port from the United Kingdom for
his time-extension request. Egypt's
Mahmoud Bey Fawzi also promised
to have a definite reply to the truce
request within 48 hours,

CAIRO. May 24 (UP) — Arab and
Jewish forces fought two of the most
bitter battles of the Palestine war
today and Arab Legionnaires were
reported girding for a new attack.
A United Press dispatch from in
side Jerusalem told how the Jews
twice lost and twice regained the
great French Notre Dame Hospice in
an hours-long, hand-to-hand, room
to-room battle. But hours after the
cease-fire deadline passed, the Arabs
were preparing for another on
slaught.
AN EGYPTIAN defense ministry
communique asserted that 500 Jewish
bodies had been counted "so far"
after an Egyptian attack on Jewish
fortifications in Southern Palestine.
At 11 p.m. Egypt issued its com
munique on the fight near Deir
Suneid, on the southern end of the
Palestine coast, starting at 8 p.m.
Sunday and ending at 5 a.m. today
with a claimed Egyptian victory.
THE EGYPTIANS had by-passed
Deir Suneid in their march north
ward. It was evident on the basis
of the communique that they left
powerful Jewish fortifications behind
their advanced lines.
The communique said a bombard
ment opened the battle and then
the Egyptians took the forts in a
nine-hour battle after engineers blew
breaches in the barbed wire and
minefields.
"THE COUNT OF enemy killed
so far totals 500 and big quantities
of equipment were captured," the
communique said. "At 5 a.m. today
the Egyptian flag was raised over
the highest fortification."
It was asserted that the Israelis
lost a large number of wounded and
captured, that "Egyptian losses were
slight. And that big quantities of
equipment were taken.
The communique also reported
air raids on the Tel Aviv area.
