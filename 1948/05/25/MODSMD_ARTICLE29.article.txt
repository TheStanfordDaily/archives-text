# CAMPUS OPINION
## Your Principle 
### 
To the Editor:
Your Thursday editorial agrees in principle (emphasis yours) that the
current ban on campus meetings of a political nature is undesirable.
Then you look at the disorder which has sometimes occurred in connec
tion with political meetings on other campuses, and decide that the ban
is a good thing after all.
Would you extend this same brand of reasoning to athletics? What
about the "heckling, violence and mob action in all degrees of stupidity"
which occasionally breaks out in connection with football games? Or at
pep rallies? Would you do away with athletics because of it? Of course
*101.
Then why rationalize regarding the political ban? If you believe, in
principle, that political activities should have a place in University life for
those who desire such, why not stick to that principle?
