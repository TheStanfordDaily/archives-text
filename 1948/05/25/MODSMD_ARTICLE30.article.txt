WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP).—
President Truman today promoted a
career civil servant to his cabinet
for the second time this year by
nominating 44-year-old Charles F.
Brannan to be Secretary of Agri
culture.
Brannan, who now is Assistant
Secretary, succeeds Clinton P. An
derson who left the cabinet early
this month to run as Democratic
candidate lor the Senate in New
Mexico. Brannan is from Denver,
Colo.
By choosing Brannan, Mr. Tru
man passed up a chance to pacify
the Southern Democrats who re
volted against his civil rights pro
gram.
Brannan has been Assistant Sec
retary since June. 1944, and has
been in government service since
1935.
In recent years, Brannan has been
closely connected with two of the
chief problems currently facing the
Agriculture Department. As a liai
son officer to the United Nations
Social and Economic Council, he has
worked on the world food problem;
and as Assistant Secretary, he had
direct responsibility for planning a
long-range post-war farm program.
WASHINGTON — President Tru
man today asked Congress to make
far-reaching improvements in the
nation's social security system, in
cluding an increase of at least 50
per cent in old age pensions. This
would raise the present $25-a
-month average pension payment to
about $37.50.
He said in a special message that
wider social insurance benefits are
needed to protect retired as well as

active workers, their children, and
their survivors from insecurity in
the face of creeping inflation.
He offered his proposals as one
way of answering "the false claim
constantly being made that demo
cratic societies cannot protect their
people" from the economic uncer
tainties of modern civilization.
WASHINGTON— A House Un-
American Activities subcommittee
has been holding secret hearings on
the loyalty of Dr. E. U. Condon for
more than a week, it was disclosed
today.
Condon is director of the National
Bureau of Standards, and one of the
scientists who helped fashion the
atomic bomb. The committee, near
ly three months ago, charged pub
licly that he is "one of the weakest
links in our atomic security."
Condon flatly denied that he ever
gave away any item of secret infor
mation, and demanded a public
hearing before the committee. His
government superiors supported
him.
SACRAMENTO — State director
of employment James G. Bryant said
today that California will face a ser
ious farm labor shortage this sum
mer, with peak demand expected to
reach 350.000 workers needed as
against 150.000 now on hand.
Bryant told a meeting of Gov
ernor Warren's "cabinet" of depart
ment heads that the impact of the
European Recovery Program and the
revival of defense industries will
probably make for a tight labor
market throughout the state in most
kinds of work.
