# The Presidential Arena
## ARTHUR H. VANDENBERG GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR 
### 
LANSING. Mich.—Arthur Hendrick Vandenberg
of Michigan has his sights trained on the nation's
hiphest office to crown a political career that took
him from an editor's chair to world statesmanship in
20 years.
He goes to the 194S Republican convention as
Michigan's "favorite son" choice and a definite dark
horse threat to win the nomination for president.
However, lie did not seek the honor pnhlicly.
The political rise of Michigan's senior senator to
presidency of the Senate and chairmanship of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee was not a sud*
den one.
He might have had the GOP nomination in 1936 if
he had fought for it, but he was certain he could
not defeat the late President Roosevelt. He did seek
it unsuccessfully in 1940.
At that time, he was strongly isolationist. But
by reversing his stand and whole-heartedly sup
porting the war effort, he gained stature and influ
ence. Since the war, he has championed a bi
partisan foreign policy. He has staunch friends high
in both major parties.
The tall, dignified, flawlessly dressed Vandenberg
was a political power before going to the Senate in
1928. As editor of the Grand Rapids Herald, he
wielded strong influence in domestic and foreign
affairs.
His career is in the American tradition. His bear
ing is reserved, even toward his closest friends, but
he attracts followers by his straightforwardness, fi
delity, keen wit and dry humor. His oratory is the
best in the Senate and he is a fast thinker.
Vandenberg was bom <>4 years ago in Grand
Kapids, the son of a harness maker. He began
making a reputation as an orator in high school.
Close associates say the need to leave the Uni
versity of Michigan after his first year probably was
responsible for making him what he is today. His
passion is learning, through books and travel.
In his formative years, he spent all his spare
time rending and Enlarging his vocabulary. He al
ways knew what lie wanted and worked for it.
Vandenberg's one big disappointment was his de
sire to be a lawyer. Instead, he became an editor
and publisher, starting as a city hall reporter of the
Herald after his one year in college.
His energy and zeal won the attention of the late
Senator William Alden Smith, then publisher of the
Herald.

MILWAUKEE — Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, whose
boom for the presidency started on a "Halt Commu
nism" platform, is a third generation Republican.
Both Arthur Mac Arthur Sr., the general's grand
father, and Arthur Mac Arthur 11, his father, were
active GOP workers in Milwaukee.
Mac Arthur's grandfather came here in 18{17. lie
became a Republican shortly after the party was
treated at Ripon, Wis., in IKs<>.
Mac Arthur's father, Arthur Mac Arthur 11, also
was an active Republican, although like his famed
son, his political activities were limited by his mili
tary career. He became a lieutenant general in later
years, but his chief fame was gained when as a young
soldier be won the Congressional Medal of Honor by
leading Wisconsin troops in the storming of Mis
sionary Ridge in Tennessee in the Civil War.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, although not politically
active until his entrance into the Republican presi
dential primary in 1944 in Wisconsin, always has
followed his family's political beliefs. He was
named chicf of staff at 451 by President Herbert
Hoover. lie was the youngest chief of staff on
record.
He served for six years under both Hoover and
the late President Roosevelt. He left that position
to assume command of the Philippine Army, and
while in Manila, he helped prepare the Filipinos for
their stand against the Japanese in 1941.
Mac Arthur was injected into the national spotlight
March 8, 1948, when he announced his availability
for the Republican presidential nomination. That set
off a series of national movements to spur his chances.
In Wisconsin, Lansing Hoyt, national chairman of
the MacArthur-for-President clubs, organized a
complete slate for the April 0 test which saw Mac-
Arthur take eight delegates to 19 for Harold Stas
scn, who defeated a "favorite son."
His foes termed Mac Arthur's second place show
ing in Wisconsin a blow, but his supporters said
it was a moral victory, inasmuch as the general
did not make a personal appearance and worked
only through clubs formed in his behalf.
Mac Arthur s favorite son label in the Wisconsin
primary was derived from his family's residence
here and his own residence in the city for several
months before his appointment to West Point.
