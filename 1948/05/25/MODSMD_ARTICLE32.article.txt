## History 1948 Conscientious Objectors And Civil Rights 
### 
The report of the President's Amnesty Board,
headed by former Justice Owen J. Roberts, is an
illuminating discussion of the rights and duties of
citizenship in a democracy. It should do much to
clarify public thinking about those 15,805 persons
who were convicted of violation of the wartime

Selective Service Act.
There undoubtedly has been a
tendency to lump them all in one
category as '"conscientious objec
tors." The report makes clear
what a misconception that is. It
admirably separates the sheep
from the goats.
There was no question in the
minds of the board members
about the justice of punishment
of those 10,000 willful violators
who made up two-thirds of the

15,805 cases. They included in their number rapists,
murderers, blackmailers, wife deserters, and those
who attempted to evade service for their country in
order to profit from the war. They do not deserve,
the board decided, a restoration of their civil rights,
since they "exhibited a deliberate evasion of the
law, indicating no respect for the law or the civil
rights to which they might have been restored."
There was little question either about the right of
members of certain religious groups to refuse to
serve in the armed forces. The right to hold such
beliefs and to have them respected has long been
recognized in this country. Many of them served
loyally after their fashion in services not connected
with the actual prosecution of the war.
The difficult problem for the board .to decide was
that of those who claimed to be conscientious ob
jectors on other than religious grounds—because of
intellectual, political, or sociological convictions. The
board turned down, as a class, those who fell in
that category and who, now that the war is over,
are petitioning for 'restoration of their civil rights;
that is, the right to vote, to hold public office, and
to serve on juries.
It stated a principle that is fundamental in a de
mocracy, where the majority rules with due regard
for the rights of a minority, when the board decided
that it would not recommend restoration of civil
rights to these persons who "thus have set them
selves up as wiser and more competent than society
to determine their duty to come to the defense of
the nation."
Nations could not exist, nor any orderly society,
if the views of this small minority were to prevail.
There comes a time when the collective wisdom
and the collective conscience of a people must govern
the action of all.
In our country one may disagree with the decision

of the majority and argue against it, but when the
decision is taken it is then binding on all citizens to
accept it and assume whatever duties are assigned.
Those who in time of crises refuse to accept this de
cision. and thus protect themselves from the hazards
to which others expose themselves, do not, in time
of peace, deserve to share the privileges that accrue
to those who did.

since they "exhibited a deliberate evasion of the
law, indicating no respect for the law or the civil
rights to which they might have been restored."
There was little question either about the right of
members of certain religious groups to refuse to
serve in the armed forces. The right to hold such
beliefs and to have them respected has long been
recognized in this country. Many of them served
loyally after their fashion in services not connected
with the actual prosecution of the war.
The difficult problem for the board .to decide was
that of those who claimed to be conscientious ob
jectors on other than religious grounds—because of
intellectual, political, or sociological convictions. The
board turned down, as a class, those who fell in
that category and who, now that the war is over,
are petitioning for 'restoration of their civil rights;
that is, the right to vote, to hold public office, and
to serve on juries.
It stated a principle that is fundamental in a de
mocracy, where the majority rules with due regard
for the rights of a minority, when the board decided
that it would not recommend restoration of civil
rights to these persons who "thus have set them
selves up as wiser and more competent than society
to determine their duty to come to the defense of
the nation."
Nations could not exist, nor any orderly society,
if the views of this small minority were to prevail.
There comes a time when the collective wisdom
and the collective conscience of a people must govern
the action of all.
In our country one may disagree with the decision

of the majority and argue against it, but when the
decision is taken it is then binding on all citizens to
accept it and assume whatever duties are assigned.
Those who in time of crises refuse to accept this de
cision. and thus protect themselves from the hazards
to which others expose themselves, do not, in time
of peace, deserve to share the privileges that accrue
to those who did.

The report of the President's Amnesty Board,
headed by former Justice Owen J. Roberts, is an
illuminating discussion of the rights and duties of
citizenship in a democracy. It should do much to
clarify public thinking about those 15,805 persons
who were convicted of violation of the wartime

Selective Service Act.
There undoubtedly has been a
tendency to lump them all in one
category as '"conscientious objec
tors." The report makes clear
what a misconception that is. It
admirably separates the sheep
from the goats.
There was no question in the
minds of the board members
about the justice of punishment
of those 10,000 willful violators
who made up two-thirds of the

15,805 cases. They included in their number rapists,
murderers, blackmailers, wife deserters, and those
who attempted to evade service for their country in
order to profit from the war. They do not deserve,
the board decided, a restoration of their civil rights,
since they "exhibited a deliberate evasion of the
law, indicating no respect for the law or the civil
rights to which they might have been restored."
