## Rationing in Italy 
### 
ROME (UP)â€”The visitor who tries to understand
(he rationing system here soon discovers that nobody
pays much attention to government restrictions on
such items as bread, sugar, and gasoline.
After seeing whipped cram served in restaurants
for a week you learn that whipped cream is illegal.
But you have to ask to find out.
If there are penalties in the law for trading on
the black market they are rarely imposed. Five
Italians who met casually in an office building had
no idea what the gasoline ration amounted to.
Later a telephone call to a government ministry
got the information. The ordinary automobile user
gets about 14 gallons a month.
The spaghetti ration is five pounds per month per
person. The bread allowance works out at two large
rolls (large enough for slicing) per person per day.
But only dark bread is rationed. White bread is il
legal, so you buy it on the black market.
The black market runs wide open around Plaza
Vittoria from sidewalk stalls and carts. You can
buy everything from firearms to cake flour in Plaza
Vittorio.
The limited supply of legal gasoline sells for (i:t
cents a gallon. Illegal gasoline is plentiful at 85
cents.
Butter is not rationed. The price fluctuates from
$1 to $1.30 per pound. Lunch in a first class res
taurant costs $2.50.
American cigarettes are 50 cents a pack. Old
women and boys hawk them in the streets in card
board trays. Some of the packs are open so the
smokes can be sold one at a time.
Taking American cigarettes is a lively trade.
The packages arc convincing forgeries and the to
bacco comes from butts pickcd up in the streets
and salvaged from ashtrays in restaurants.
The only money in circulation in Italy is paper
money. Coins disappeared in 1941 when the value of
the copper in a two-lire piece became worth more
than two lire.
Five and 10.000 lire bank notes are narrow and
twice as long as an ordinary American check. One
hundred and 1.000 lire notes come in odd sizes. Some
are no larger than dollar bills. Others are almost
square and bigger than the page of a book.
