# Freshmen Baseballers End Season With .631 Average

### JACK BLOOD 
The first Farm Irishman baseball
team since 1942 wound up its sea
son last Saturday with a commend
able record of 12 wins and a tie
in 20 games.
Charlie Bushong, in first full sea
son as freshman coach, turned in
a fine job in making a winning ball
club from the bunch of relatively
green players who answered his call
for candidates last quarter.
The team had its rough spots—
losing four in a row in mid-season
including two straight to the Cal
Cubs—but the men came back to
knock off the Cubs in the third
game and wind up the season with
a win over the strongest freshman
team in the area—St. Mary's.
HIGHLIGHTS of tl le season in
cluded Jim Claypool's sparkling
pitching performances as the lanky
right-hander compiled a 5-won 2-
lost record. Lefty Lloyd Westphal
turned in a 4-won 2-lost record,
mostly in relief.
The third leg of the freshmen's
three-man staff, Denny Tuffanelli,
found the going rough at times but
showed enough improvement to
come up with a one-hitter in his last
start against Santa Clara High last
week. Denny also wielded lots of
punch in the outfield on days he
wasn't pitching, hitting around the
.400 mark all season.

Leading the attack with a plus
! .400 average was Jim Trabucco,
who handled the left field position
all season. Jim will be a strong
candidate for a regular job on next
I year's varsity.
AT THIRD BASK Sal Colletto
played brilliant, if erratic, baseball
but his .333 hitting was always
steady. Sal broke up the 10-inning
thriller with San Mateo JC with
his clutch single in the tenth.
Shortstop Ken La Crosse was a
Marty Marion all season long and
could always be counted on for a
hit when it was needed. Ken was
' the top base runner of the team,
j stealing eight bases.
Catching was never a worry for
; the freshmen. Dick Clegg, John
i "Punch" Herbold, and Bill Herron
j were three dependable receivers
I with plenty of hustle. Clegg and
j Herron joined the team late be
i cause of basketball duties, and both
| were valuable reinforcements.
CAPTAIN HON M('COMBER at
' first was the finest fielding first
j baseman on the field at any given
■ date. Although Mac's hitting fell
off this season, many of his fielding
i plays verged on the miraculous.
All of these boys will be heard
I from next year either on the varsity
or the jayvees, and none of them
will hurt anv team they're on.
