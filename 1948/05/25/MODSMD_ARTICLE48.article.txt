# Dodgers Win After 8 Loses
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 24 (UP).—
There's good news tonight—good
news in Flatbush that is because
after a string of defeats that threat
ened to extend longer than the
Broadway run of "Life with Fa
ther." the Dodgers finally won a
ball game.
What's more alter eight straight
losses—longest home losing streak
in the regime of Manager Leo Du
rocher—the Brooklyns looked like
champs in a 9 to 4 triumph over the
Reds.
With Preacher Roe pitching bril
liantly and with the batters getting
timely hits, including homers by
Jackie Robinson and Billy Cox and
a three-run double by Eddie Miksis,
the Reds just didn't have a look-in.
For five innings Roe had a no
hitter, retiring 15 men in order
after the first Cincinnati batter,
Claude Corbitt, was safe on the first
of three amazing errors by the usu
ally sure-fingered Peewee Reese at
shortstop. Roe struck out seven and
gave up eight hits.
Big Robinson, returning to the
first base position where he won
rookie of the year honors in 1947,
also hit a double and single in his
three times at bat. He started off
Brooklyn's scoring against young
Kent Peterson with a ringing double
in the first after Miksis had led off
with a single and taken second on
a wild pitch.
The Dodgers sewed it up with six
runs on four hits in the fourth,
Miksis landing the big blow, his
double which emptied the sacks.
In the only other game of the day,
Hal Newhouser, now apparently

back in high gear after a very slow
start, won his second game in a
row and his third against four
losses, topping the Senators at De
troit, 5 to 2, on seven hits. He also
struck out six batters and gave up
only two walks.
Paul Campbell's three-run triple
in the first inning gave him all the
margin he needed. He pitched
scoreless ball himself after the open
ing inning when Washington made
two runs on Al Kozar's single, Gil
Coan's triple, and Mickey Vernon's
single.
St. Louis at Philadelphia in the
National League was a night game.
