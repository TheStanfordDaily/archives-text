# Marks May Fall in PCC Track Meet
## 
### 
The last big meet of the 1948 Pa
cific Coast track season is the PCC
meet this Saturday at the Los An
geles Coliseum. The meet was dis
continued during the war years, and
this is the first time the classic has
been held since 1942.
Southern California's great track
supremacy has held in this meet
since 193(5, with Stanford coming in
a close second place from 193G to
1940. The 1937 team lost to tho Tro
jans by one point, while the 1940
Card squad (Jeffrey & Co.) was
edged out by Troy 55 to 53. Stan
ford reigned supreme from 1925
through 1927.
HOWEVER, THE INDIANS hold
more individual PCC records than
any other team. Clyde Jeffrey
shares the two dash records, tin
century being with Hal Davis ol
California in 9.G seconds and tin
220 being with Borah of Southern
Cal in 21 flat. Jeffrey ran 21 flat in
both 1939 and 1940.
also hold both all-tinu
PCC weight records. Fox Lev>
tossed the platter 170 feet 10-
inches, and Anderson of the Indian,
threw the shot 52 feet Binches
The other Card record is in the hit 1
hurdles where Simmy Klopstocl*
shares his 14.4 in 193G with Ander
son of Washington.
SEVERAL RECORDS stand ;
very good chance of being brokei
this year, if the are up t<
their best performances. Darrel
Kreitz and Downing McKce art
both capable ol breaking Klop
stock's and Anderson's record in tin
high hurdles, but must beat UCLA'
Craig Dixon to do it. This will bt
quite a task.
Of course, Troy's ace sprinter, Me
Pat ton, could easily set two sprin
records. However, the Coliseun
track is not very fast and the Tro
jan flash may have to pour it on.
The middle distance and distance
records seem to be pretty safe, anc
probably will not be broken. Gro
ver Klemmer of the Bears holds th(
quarter-mile record in the excep
tionally fast time of 46.4 seconds
The 880 record is 1:51.7 held bj
Dale of Washington State, the milt
record is 4:09.3 held by Liebowit;
of Idaho, and the two-mile recorc
is 9:12.5 held by Garner of Wash
ington State.
The shot record could also bt
broken without too much surprise
Otis Chandler of the Indians, Bil
Bayless of the Trojans, and Jern
Shipkey of the Bruins have al
tossed over 53 feet during the reg
ular season. It could be possible
that all three men could beat tin
record, but only the winner's nanu
will stand.
The other field records are fairh
safe. Les Steers of Oregon, 6 fee
9 inches in the high jump; 80l
Peoples of Troy, 231 feet 1 inch ii
the javelin: Sefton and Meadows o
Troy, 14 feet 11 inches in the pole
vault; and Jack Robinson of UCLA
25 feet even in the broad jump. Tin
mile relay record is 3:12.3. madt
by Washington State in 1937.
