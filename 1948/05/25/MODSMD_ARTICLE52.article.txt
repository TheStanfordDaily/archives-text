Re: California Relays, May 22, 1948
Dear Sirs:
Lr»t Saturday two friends and myself journeyed to your city to view j
the Seventh Annual California Relays. We left Stanford in high hopes
for an enjoyable afternoon watching some of the world's top track and
field men compete.
Today we are very bitter. Indeed, we will never again travel to your
-•ity for a track meet—not even if the Olympics were to be held there.
The day was a flop from the moment we stepped on the miniature oval i
sou call a track. Why the word never reached us about the size, seating
•upacity, and arrangements of seats is something we just can't under
stand. Our high school football field is better than the Modesto Junior
College "stadium." Sardines have oil.
This miscariage of a track meet is in its seventh year. Then surely j
people in the past have suffered through the five-hour monotony without j
seeing the finish of a single sprint. Why have they not raised their
voices as I do now to warn others to remain at home?
Yep. We sat through almost five hours of track events (at a cost of
$2.25 per "reserved seat") and didn't get a clear view of the finish of a
single race. Your two-by-four "stadium" is 10 rows high and we sat
at the start of the 100-yard dash. As soon as the runners were off :
their blocks and 20 yards down the track, everybody stood up. Then we
waited for announcer Ernie Smith to tell us who won. All this from
reserved seats."
Things were so had that one of our number approached Mr. Smith
and asked him to ask the people to remain seated so that the 300-some
people of our section could get their money's worth. Would he? No.
Yet, this lack of cooperation wasn't the worst part of the relays. Five j
hours is a long time to sit through a track meet even if all the events are j
>112 interest to the spectator.
Over two-thirds of the races were run off between junior college and !
high school teams. Now your Chamber of Commerce wastes no words j
in describing the Cal Relays as "the Big Meet." If you want to live !
up to such a high-sounding phrase, you would do well to drop those
iwo classes and concentrate on providing well run college events.
But then, if you really wanted to make the meet worthwhile you
would transfer it out of your village to a larger stadium.
Let's be honest about it. You people have an active group behind the
Cal Relays. You saw that the Fresno Relays were going over well and
Jecided that you might as well jump in and grab off some of the gravj'.
You put up the money and give the watches that get the nation's top
ithletes to your show. If you can build up a reputation of having a
last track you can the record-happy athletes to compete.
But you just don't have the facilities for a track meet of such proportions. !
The Modesto Junior College stadium is much to small. The lighting setup
- inadequate and the layout of the field events too congested. Not over
I 000 of the 7,000 persons who were on hand Saturday could see what
vvas going on.
You reserve almost all the plant and sell tickets for even the poorest
seats at a cost too high for their value. This you must do to help defray
.he costs incurred in bringing out the top talent.
When the Fresno Relays were started, most people thought the idea of a !
•elay carnival a good one. Like most good things it was quickly copied.
\'ow the idea is getting out of hand.
The next thing we know, all the little towns in California will be i
sprouting relays. Each wants to get a better reputation as a "record- i
jreaking track." The timers get jumpy and give the runners a break.
I lie next morning the papers headline that such and such a record was j
roken at the Milpitas Relays.
The sport of track and field will suffer as a result. Already I feel that
he sport is being exploited for local gains in commerce and such.
Except for your clay track which, through no fault of your own was i
n terible condition Saturday, you have no call to put on such a meet, j
Even if you eliminated the high school and jaycee portions of your program
it would still fall short of the mark.
I compliment you on the spirit that you have shown in attempting
to put on an event that is way out of your class. Maybe it wasn't your
fault that the meet was over an hour behind time, but it doesn't argue
well for the ability of those concerned.
In short, I think it would be a good thing for track in general if the |
Pacific Coast Conference or a like organization would underwrite a relay
neet. Such a meet could be held in Stanford Stadium or Edwards Stadium 1
it Berkeley or, for that matter, at any large field. At least the spectators
.ould see what was going on.
The best part of your show involved the Stanford band. We couldn't
see the pole vault contestants very well from where we sat but we
viiew when our man Bill Larson cleared his mark by the cheers of that
..roup. They livened up the show with their organized chants and cheers.
Dther than that small consolation, we repeat, the show was a flop. "Zoo" i
\nn Olson made a good queen but we missed the bathing suit. She
arried on valiantly but the cards were stacked against her by the very
iature of the meet.
We repeat, we are very bitter.
Disappointedly* yours.
JOHN BREIER
P.S. What's more, the dog kingdom didn't even see fit to send a repre- '
tentative to your show. I didn't see a single dog during the five-hour
u ind. That is enough in itself to classify your show. J. 8.! j

Re: California Relays, May 22, 1948
Dear Sirs:
Lr»t Saturday two friends and myself journeyed to your city to view j
the Seventh Annual California Relays. We left Stanford in high hopes
for an enjoyable afternoon watching some of the world's top track and
field men compete.
Today we are very bitter. Indeed, we will never again travel to your
-•ity for a track meet—not even if the Olympics were to be held there.
The day was a flop from the moment we stepped on the miniature oval i
sou call a track. Why the word never reached us about the size, seating
•upacity, and arrangements of seats is something we just can't under
stand. Our high school football field is better than the Modesto Junior
College "stadium." Sardines have oil.
This miscariage of a track meet is in its seventh year. Then surely j
people in the past have suffered through the five-hour monotony without j
seeing the finish of a single sprint. Why have they not raised their
voices as I do now to warn others to remain at home?
Yep. We sat through almost five hours of track events (at a cost of
$2.25 per "reserved seat") and didn't get a clear view of the finish of a
single race. Your two-by-four "stadium" is 10 rows high and we sat
at the start of the 100-yard dash. As soon as the runners were off :
their blocks and 20 yards down the track, everybody stood up. Then we
waited for announcer Ernie Smith to tell us who won. All this from
reserved seats."
Things were so had that one of our number approached Mr. Smith
and asked him to ask the people to remain seated so that the 300-some
people of our section could get their money's worth. Would he? No.
Yet, this lack of cooperation wasn't the worst part of the relays. Five j
hours is a long time to sit through a track meet even if all the events are j
>112 interest to the spectator.
Over two-thirds of the races were run off between junior college and !
high school teams. Now your Chamber of Commerce wastes no words j
in describing the Cal Relays as "the Big Meet." If you want to live !
up to such a high-sounding phrase, you would do well to drop those
iwo classes and concentrate on providing well run college events.
But then, if you really wanted to make the meet worthwhile you
would transfer it out of your village to a larger stadium.
Let's be honest about it. You people have an active group behind the
Cal Relays. You saw that the Fresno Relays were going over well and
Jecided that you might as well jump in and grab off some of the gravj'.
You put up the money and give the watches that get the nation's top
ithletes to your show. If you can build up a reputation of having a
last track you can the record-happy athletes to compete.
But you just don't have the facilities for a track meet of such proportions. !
The Modesto Junior College stadium is much to small. The lighting setup
- inadequate and the layout of the field events too congested. Not over
I 000 of the 7,000 persons who were on hand Saturday could see what
vvas going on.
You reserve almost all the plant and sell tickets for even the poorest
seats at a cost too high for their value. This you must do to help defray
.he costs incurred in bringing out the top talent.

seeing the finish of a single sprint. Why have they not raised their
voices as I do now to warn others to remain at home?
Yep. We sat through almost five hours of track events (at a cost of
$2.25 per "reserved seat") and didn't get a clear view of the finish of a
single race. Your two-by-four "stadium" is 10 rows high and we sat
at the start of the 100-yard dash. As soon as the runners were off :
their blocks and 20 yards down the track, everybody stood up. Then we
waited for announcer Ernie Smith to tell us who won. All this from
reserved seats."
Things were so had that one of our number approached Mr. Smith
and asked him to ask the people to remain seated so that the 300-some
people of our section could get their money's worth. Would he? No.
Yet, this lack of cooperation wasn't the worst part of the relays. Five j
hours is a long time to sit through a track meet even if all the events are j
>112 interest to the spectator.
Over two-thirds of the races were run off between junior college and !
high school teams. Now your Chamber of Commerce wastes no words j
in describing the Cal Relays as "the Big Meet." If you want to live !
up to such a high-sounding phrase, you would do well to drop those
iwo classes and concentrate on providing well run college events.
But then, if you really wanted to make the meet worthwhile you
would transfer it out of your village to a larger stadium.
Let's be honest about it. You people have an active group behind the
Cal Relays. You saw that the Fresno Relays were going over well and
Jecided that you might as well jump in and grab off some of the gravj'.
You put up the money and give the watches that get the nation's top
ithletes to your show. If you can build up a reputation of having a
last track you can the record-happy athletes to compete.
But you just don't have the facilities for a track meet of such proportions. !
The Modesto Junior College stadium is much to small. The lighting setup
- inadequate and the layout of the field events too congested. Not over
I 000 of the 7,000 persons who were on hand Saturday could see what
vvas going on.
You reserve almost all the plant and sell tickets for even the poorest
seats at a cost too high for their value. This you must do to help defray
.he costs incurred in bringing out the top talent.
When the Fresno Relays were started, most people thought the idea of a !
•elay carnival a good one. Like most good things it was quickly copied.
\'ow the idea is getting out of hand.
The next thing we know, all the little towns in California will be i
sprouting relays. Each wants to get a better reputation as a "record- i
jreaking track." The timers get jumpy and give the runners a break.
I lie next morning the papers headline that such and such a record was j
roken at the Milpitas Relays.
The sport of track and field will suffer as a result. Already I feel that
he sport is being exploited for local gains in commerce and such.
Except for your clay track which, through no fault of your own was i
n terible condition Saturday, you have no call to put on such a meet, j
Even if you eliminated the high school and jaycee portions of your program
it would still fall short of the mark.
I compliment you on the spirit that you have shown in attempting
to put on an event that is way out of your class. Maybe it wasn't your
fault that the meet was over an hour behind time, but it doesn't argue
well for the ability of those concerned.
In short, I think it would be a good thing for track in general if the |
Pacific Coast Conference or a like organization would underwrite a relay
neet. Such a meet could be held in Stanford Stadium or Edwards Stadium 1
it Berkeley or, for that matter, at any large field. At least the spectators
.ould see what was going on.
The best part of your show involved the Stanford band. We couldn't
see the pole vault contestants very well from where we sat but we
viiew when our man Bill Larson cleared his mark by the cheers of that
..roup. They livened up the show with their organized chants and cheers.
Dther than that small consolation, we repeat, the show was a flop. "Zoo" i
\nn Olson made a good queen but we missed the bathing suit. She
arried on valiantly but the cards were stacked against her by the very
iature of the meet.
We repeat, we are very bitter.
Disappointedly* yours.

P.S. What's more, the dog kingdom didn't even see fit to send a repre- '

Re: California Relays, May 22, 1948
Dear Sirs:
Lr»t Saturday two friends and myself journeyed to your city to view j
the Seventh Annual California Relays. We left Stanford in high hopes
for an enjoyable afternoon watching some of the world's top track and
field men compete.
Today we are very bitter. Indeed, we will never again travel to your
-•ity for a track meet—not even if the Olympics were to be held there.
The day was a flop from the moment we stepped on the miniature oval i
sou call a track. Why the word never reached us about the size, seating
•upacity, and arrangements of seats is something we just can't under
stand. Our high school football field is better than the Modesto Junior
College "stadium." Sardines have oil.
