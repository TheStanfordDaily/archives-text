# PCL ROUND-UP
## Seals Lead by 6 Games; Suds Move Into Third 
### CRAYTON JONES 
San Francisco now enjoys a six- j
game lead over the rest of the PCL j
field thanks to the hustling Rainiers i
from Seattle. The amazing Suds,
who have risen from the depths of
the second division during the last
few weeks, copped five out of seven
from Los Angeles and moved up J
into a tie with Oakland for third j
place.
Two Seattle hurlers came mighty j
close to equaling "Kewpie" Bar- i
rett's performance of last Sunday.
Guy Fletcher blanked the Angels i
Thursday night, allowing only one I
hit, and Johnny Gorsica missed a I
perfect game by only one man in [
Sunday's seven-inning nightcap.
MEANWHILE the Oaks and Seals
were having it out over in Emery
ville. The Oaks won three out of j
the first four games of the series and j
then proceeded to drop the next ;
three.
In an attempt to boost attendance j
figures a pitching duel was arranged
between Con Dempsey, the Seals'
ace relief artist, and Will Hafey, the
$100,000 beauty from Oakland. As
expected, attendance figures were i
boosted, but it was no pitching j
duel. Mr. Dempsey calmly hurled a j
seven-hit shutout, while Mr. Hafey j
was blasted for seven runs and 10 !
hits including home runs by Hugh
Luby and Joe Brovia.
BIG CON has now pitched 31 in
nings during his short sojourn in I
the Coast League without allowing
an earned run, which is truly a re
markable record.
The big victory for the Oaks came
on Friday night when they coasted j
to a 13 to 2 win behind the four-hit !
pitching of Charlie Gassaway. Les j
Scarsella and Ernie "Schnoz" Lorn- \
bardi, recently acquired from Sac- !
ramento, slammed out home runs to '
lead the attack.
San Diego swept both games of

Sunday's twin bill from Hollywood
and thus copped the series by the
odd game.
IN THE BATTLE for the base
ment Sacramento won its series
from the Blundering Beavers. 4
games to 3. The Bevos and the Sacs
are now 17 games of! the pace set
by the league-leading Seals. Port
land has fa'lwn apart at the seams
as expected help from the Yankee.*
has failed to materialize.
This week the Angels and the
Seals vie in Seals Stadium while
Oakland journeys to Hollywood.
Other activity finds Portland at Se
attle and San Diego at Sacramento.
BRIEFS: The Oaks set a new
Home attendance record last week
as their series with San Francisc_>
lured 86.463 fans through the turn
stiles. The previous mark was 82.-
298, set in 1946.
Cliff Melton's victory over the
Oaks last Saturday marked the firs:
time the giant left-hander has beat
en Oakland in two vears.
