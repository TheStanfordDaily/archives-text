# Raiders Nab Sadie, Phillips
## 
### 
KSU studios were raided last
night for the third time this year
when a gang of about eight or ten
men from Encina broke into the
studio at 10:55 and disrupted the
"Stanford Sadie'' broadcast.
The gang gagged and tied Steve
Phillips, station manager, and car
ried him out of the studio. One of
the KSU staff overheard them say
ing they would "roil him in a mat
tress and dump him in Roble," but
he was finally deposited on a table
in the Daily Shack.
Two of the Encina gang carried
Sadie off, and when last seen they
were in a car headed for Lake La
gunita.
KSU staff members said they be
lieved the raid was planned as a
race with a gang from Toyon who
had also planned a similar raid.
