M///,
Wherever you sit in Western
Pacific's new Vista-Dome cars,
you're next to a window and
close to a sweeping view ...
Vista-Dome cars are like glasi
houses on wheels with transpar
ent thermapane walls and roof, i
The whole breath-taking pano
rama is yours... all the way
as you relax in comfort.. .see
the Colorado Rockies by day
light. W. P. is the only western
railroad to have Vista-Dome
coaches. No extra fare for this
extra look along "the most
scenic railroad in America." No
wonder Western Pacific's giant
diesel-powered transcontinental
trains sell out fast. Make your
reservations now! Coast to /
Coast...no change of Pullman
oi porter.
