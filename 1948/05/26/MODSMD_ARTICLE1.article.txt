# Tuition Will Increase $100 A Year
## 
### 
Stanford announced today that
the University will increase its tui
tion $100 a year with the beginning
of autumn quarter, 1948.
Acting President Alvin C. Eu
rich said that the action was taken
reluctantly by the Board of Trus
tees and only after the most care
ful study, but was made necessary
by rising costs in almost every phase
of operation of the University.
TIIE ADDITIONAL INCOME will
be used for faculty salary increases,
largely in the associate and full pro
fessor levels because substantial in
creases have been provided in the
lower ranks during the past two
years; for scholarships; and to pro
vide funds for an extension of the
annuity program for members of the
University staff not currently cov
ered.
The fall general tuition will be

$600; for the Graduate School of
Business, $6u9; and the Medical
School, $699.
1)K. EURICII SAID the Univer
sity is increasing all its scholar
ships by about 20 per cent, and is
making further funds available for
grants-in-aid and loans in order to
help students placed in financial dif
ficulties by higher tuition. Similarly
the stipends of teaching assistants
and other graduate assistants in the
University will be adjusted.
He pointed out that the tuition in
crease is in line with similar steps
being taken by major Eastern and
Mid - Western independent univer
sities in the face of inflated costs.
COLUMBIA lIAS ANNOUNCED
a tuition and general fee raise from
$470 to $600; the University of Chi
cago, from $450 to $525; Dartmouth,
from $550 to $600; Harvard, from

$155 to $555 ($7OO for the Law
School and $800 for Medicine and
the Graduate School of Business);
and Northwestern, $404 to $505.
Other major independent univer
sity tuitions and fees are: Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology,
$700; Princeton, $660; Rochester,
$500; and Yale, $624.
ALL OF THESE universities have
had at least one tuition fee increase
since 1945, and most of them two.
Stanford raised its tuition $15 a
quarter in 1940 and $17 a quarter
more in 1946.
Under the GI Bill of Rights, tui
tion payments are allowed up to
$500 a year. The more than 4,000
veterans attending Stanford will
have a number of choices as to how
to meet the increase, it was pointed
out by Dean of Students Lawrence
A. Kimpton.

IF THEY HAVE a longer period
of entitlement than is required to
complete their education, they can
have the full $600 paid by the gov
ernment, although this will shorten
their period of eligibility one day
for each $2.10 the veterans spend
over $500. A veteran getting the full
tuition paid by the government
would thus lose about 48 days' eli
gibility in a year.
UNDER THE GI BILL, the length
of a veteran's service determines the
period of eligibility—up to a maxi
mum of four years—for a monthly
subsistence allowance and a maxi
mum of $500 tuition every nine
months.
If the veterans so choose, they can
charge $500 of the new tuition to
the Veterans Administration under
the GI Bill and pay the additional
cost themselves, thereby extending

the length of time of their eligibil
ity under the federal program.
(iLOKCiE 1). BAKAHAL, veter
ans' co-ordinator, said that some of
the veterans at Stanford have a dis
ability of more than 10 per cent but
are not taking advantage of Public
Law 16, which covers the education
of disabled veterans and under
which there is no tuition limit. He
urged any veteran with a disability
who is not currently taking advan
tage of Public Law 1(5 benefits t..
contact Lewis Day, chief Veteran
Administration representative o
the campus.
There is also the possibility, Bara
hal said, that students who are ac
tually residents of California ma
i be eligible for additional education
i benefits under the California Divi
j sion of Educational Assistance one.
I their GI Bill benefits are exhauste
