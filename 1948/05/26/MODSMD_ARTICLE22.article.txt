Today is undoubtedly a black day for many persons on cam
pus. For S6OO a year is more tuition than they can afford. Come
fall quarter they won't be here.
However, there's no question that salary increases are in order
for members of the teaching staff. Compare your professors'
oay checks with those of university teachers at other campuses.
Stanford is lucky it can pay off in part in climate.
It is unfortunate that the additional cash had to come from the
pockets of the students. But that's life; the money had to come
from somewhere.
Don't condemn the Board of Trustees for their decision too
quickly. They have to keep the University on a paying basis;
raising tuition, in their estimation, apparently was the wisest
step.
There is a brighter side of the picture. Higher salaries attract
better professors. In effect, Stanford should be a better place
:o learn next fall.
Like all other universities, Stanford has education for sale.
You get what you pay for.
But the Board of Trustees will have an added $33-per-quarter
responsibility toward each and every student in September. We
are entitled to a better education. Members of the Board, make
sure you give us what we pay for.
