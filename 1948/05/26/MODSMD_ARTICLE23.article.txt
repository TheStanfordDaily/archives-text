To the Editor:
Just a few words of protest against Jiin Joseph's writing technique in
"History 1948'' of May 24. Mr. Joseph did not seem to realize that while
condemning Communist witch-hunters he employed verbal tactics similar
to those used by the witch-hunters themselves; to-wit: that arbitrary,
unobjective labelling of persons or points of view, often termed "name
calling."
His generous splattering with catch-phrases of a well-intentioned argu
ment against the Mundt Bill, including such epithets as "trouble-shooter,"
"addicted myopics," and "legislative grave-diggers," is a puerile attempt
at cleverness which resembles the kind of sensationalism approved by
Mr. Hearst.
His characterization, moreover, of Mundt himself may be accurate, but
its persuasive power is questionable, in that propably very few of his
readers have also had the privilege of "meeting" Mr. Mundt.
If you would convince, if you would persuade, Mr. Joseph, abandon
your petty name-calling and attempt a more objective, rational approach
to a problem.
