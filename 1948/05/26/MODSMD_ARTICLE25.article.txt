Freedom In China
Limited by Chiang

The present Chinese government—Chiang Kai-Shek
and the Kuomintang—is the government only by dint
of the centrally-controlled machine dominated by
Chiang and his warlords. Freedom in China is lim
ited to the kind of freedom the Kuomintang chooses
to extend to its subjects. It is generally acknowledged

and conceded that Chiang Kai-
Shek and the Kuomintang employ
devious methods to double-cross
and keep subdued the little peo
ple, who in reality are the peo
ple.
A sample of these devious
methods is clearly illustrated in
the futility of Marshall's trip to
China, when both Chiang and
the Communists played "cat and
mouse" to stalemate any and all
of Marshall's valiant efforts to

bring peace to that war-torn land.
There can be no placing of responsibility for the
civil war now being waged. The Kuomintang as
well as the Communists must assume the responsi
bility between them equally. Neither side is right;
both are using the extreme poverty and hunger of
the people as weapons on their side.
Not too long ago Chinese students in this coun
try addressed an appeal to our government to stop
supplying instruments of war to the Kuomintang
on the basis that these weapons of war were only
prolonging a futile struggle. Ami not too long ago
Chinese students in China had picketed with placards
urging the American soldiers to "go home." That
these students were arrested and jailed is in itself
unimportant, except that it does point out fairly con
clusively that lack of freedom extended to the people.
Nathaniel Peffer, v/ho is generally conceded to be
an authority on the Far East had an article in Har
per's Magazine in which he stresses the point that now
is the "Time to Get Out of China." Mr. Peffer states
that the Kuomintang is not a political party but a
group of individuals whose determination to remain
in power is such that they will see the country
ruined, il necessary, before they will relinquish one
iota of the power they now have or hope to attain.
China is a possession of the Kuomintang. The gov
ernment owns the people, instead of the government
being a servant of the people, as it should be.
China is corrupt. Public funds have been and still
are being utilized for the benefit of members of the
Kuomintang and their particular interests, and not
lor the general welfare of the millions of Chinese
who are without even the barest essentials of life.
It is not safe to raise one's voice in resentment
against Kuomintang methods—another life more or
less in China, where life is the cheapest available
commodity, is of no consequence. There can be no
expression of opinion, because too brazen an expres
sion may easily result in extermination.
Now, I am certainly not against, and I do hope
that this government will help the Chinese people
by being generous with food and medical supplies,
farm machinery, and such other commodities as are
instrumental in benefitting the people; but I am bit
terly opposed to this country's supplying instruments
of war to Chiang Kai-Shek or any military warlord.
In our hysterical state of seeing a Communist be
hind every tree, we are presently building up fascism
and nazism as a bulwark against communism. Behind
it we think that we shall be safe and secure and our
way of life may continue. But aren't we being short
sighted? Just as communism is a potential threat to
our security, how infinitely more threatening are
fascism and nazism!
If we are to combat foreign economic and political
ideologies, and its looks like the leaders of this
country want that, let us devote our energies equally
to the extermination of all phony ideologies, not
just one.

Freedom In China
Limited by Chiang

The present Chinese government—Chiang Kai-Shek
and the Kuomintang—is the government only by dint
of the centrally-controlled machine dominated by
Chiang and his warlords. Freedom in China is lim
ited to the kind of freedom the Kuomintang chooses
to extend to its subjects. It is generally acknowledged

and conceded that Chiang Kai-
Shek and the Kuomintang employ
devious methods to double-cross
and keep subdued the little peo
ple, who in reality are the peo
ple.
A sample of these devious
methods is clearly illustrated in
the futility of Marshall's trip to
China, when both Chiang and
the Communists played "cat and
mouse" to stalemate any and all
of Marshall's valiant efforts to

bring peace to that war-torn land.
There can be no placing of responsibility for the
civil war now being waged. The Kuomintang as
well as the Communists must assume the responsi
bility between them equally. Neither side is right;
both are using the extreme poverty and hunger of
the people as weapons on their side.
Not too long ago Chinese students in this coun
try addressed an appeal to our government to stop
supplying instruments of war to the Kuomintang
on the basis that these weapons of war were only
prolonging a futile struggle. Ami not too long ago
Chinese students in China had picketed with placards
urging the American soldiers to "go home." That
these students were arrested and jailed is in itself
unimportant, except that it does point out fairly con
clusively that lack of freedom extended to the people.
Nathaniel Peffer, v/ho is generally conceded to be
an authority on the Far East had an article in Har
per's Magazine in which he stresses the point that now
is the "Time to Get Out of China." Mr. Peffer states
that the Kuomintang is not a political party but a
group of individuals whose determination to remain
in power is such that they will see the country
ruined, il necessary, before they will relinquish one
iota of the power they now have or hope to attain.
China is a possession of the Kuomintang. The gov
ernment owns the people, instead of the government
being a servant of the people, as it should be.
China is corrupt. Public funds have been and still
are being utilized for the benefit of members of the
Kuomintang and their particular interests, and not
lor the general welfare of the millions of Chinese
who are without even the barest essentials of life.
It is not safe to raise one's voice in resentment
against Kuomintang methods—another life more or
less in China, where life is the cheapest available
commodity, is of no consequence. There can be no
expression of opinion, because too brazen an expres
sion may easily result in extermination.
Now, I am certainly not against, and I do hope
that this government will help the Chinese people
by being generous with food and medical supplies,
farm machinery, and such other commodities as are
instrumental in benefitting the people; but I am bit
terly opposed to this country's supplying instruments
of war to Chiang Kai-Shek or any military warlord.
In our hysterical state of seeing a Communist be
hind every tree, we are presently building up fascism
and nazism as a bulwark against communism. Behind
it we think that we shall be safe and secure and our
way of life may continue. But aren't we being short
sighted? Just as communism is a potential threat to
our security, how infinitely more threatening are
fascism and nazism!
