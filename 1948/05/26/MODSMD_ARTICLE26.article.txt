ALBANY (UP) — Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, who
seems to thrive on political setbacks, has his second
chance to become president of the United States.
New York's 46-year-old governor's whole polit
ical life has been sprinkled with as many defeats
as victories, but be always comes back stronger than
ever.
Dewey won his first major political victory in 1935,
when he was elected New York County District At
torney over powerful opposition from Tammany Hall.
His work in breaking-up rackets brought him Re
publican nomination for governor the following year.
The popular Democratic governor, Herbert H.
Lehman, who had served many years as governor
and lieutenant-governor, gave Dewey his first ser
ious licking. He trimmed the young prosecutor
by (iO.OOO votes.
In 1940, Dewey's political future-was staggered
again when the late Wendell L. Willkie stampeded
the Republican national convention and took the
party's nomination for president. Dewey had the
most delegates when the Willkie boom broke loose.
Most political leaders counted Dewey out after
that, but he bounced back by winning the gov
ernorship over Attorney General John J. Bennett
Jr., Jim Farley's hand-picked candidate. Again,
Dewey was considered for national honors.
The governor served two years of his four-year
term in the executive offices at Albany, when Re
publicans meeting in Chicago almost unanimously
selected him to stop the late Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Roosevelt was re-elected by 3.000,000 and again
Dewey apparently was headed for the poltical scrap
heap.
Two years later, Dewey pulled himself up asain
and was re-elected governor over former Sen.
James M. Mead, a New Dealer, by the largest ma
jority ever given a gubernatorial candidate in New
York State. Dewey was on the come-back trail.
A Mid-West vacation with his family in 1947
quickly became a Dewey-for-president boom. GOP
leaders from all sections called on him to pledge
support. But his political stock began slipping dur
ing the winter month of 1947-48, so Dewey decided
to come out openly for the nomination. He picked
three state primary elections to test his strength—
New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Nebraska.
Dewey took the New Hampshire primary from
Harold Stasscn and political experts again were
giving him top place. But along came Wisconsin,
and Dewey took a terrific drubbing by Stasscn and
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur. Again, the political re
porters whotc "finis" to Dewey's public career.
Stassen followed up the Wisconsin victory with an
other stinging blow to Dewey's candidacy by running
away with the Nebraska "popularity" primary. But
Dewey refused to stay down.
"I have had more political life in my 4(i years
than most people have in a lifetime," Dewey re
marked.
But that has been Dewey's whole concept of public
liie. One defeat is only temporary.

Dewey refused to stay down.

GOVERNOR THOMAS E. DEWEY
ALBANY (UP) — Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, who
seems to thrive on political setbacks, has his second
chance to become president of the United States.
New York's 46-year-old governor's whole polit
ical life has been sprinkled with as many defeats
as victories, but be always comes back stronger than
ever.
Dewey won his first major political victory in 1935,
when he was elected New York County District At
torney over powerful opposition from Tammany Hall.
His work in breaking-up rackets brought him Re
publican nomination for governor the following year.
The popular Democratic governor, Herbert H.
Lehman, who had served many years as governor
and lieutenant-governor, gave Dewey his first ser
ious licking. He trimmed the young prosecutor
by (iO.OOO votes.
In 1940, Dewey's political future-was staggered
again when the late Wendell L. Willkie stampeded
the Republican national convention and took the
party's nomination for president. Dewey had the
most delegates when the Willkie boom broke loose.
Most political leaders counted Dewey out after
that, but he bounced back by winning the gov
ernorship over Attorney General John J. Bennett
Jr., Jim Farley's hand-picked candidate. Again,
Dewey was considered for national honors.
The governor served two years of his four-year
term in the executive offices at Albany, when Re
publicans meeting in Chicago almost unanimously
selected him to stop the late Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Roosevelt was re-elected by 3.000,000 and again
Dewey apparently was headed for the poltical scrap
heap.
Two years later, Dewey pulled himself up asain
and was re-elected governor over former Sen.
James M. Mead, a New Dealer, by the largest ma
jority ever given a gubernatorial candidate in New
York State. Dewey was on the come-back trail.
A Mid-West vacation with his family in 1947
quickly became a Dewey-for-president boom. GOP
leaders from all sections called on him to pledge
support. But his political stock began slipping dur
ing the winter month of 1947-48, so Dewey decided
to come out openly for the nomination. He picked
three state primary elections to test his strength—
New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Nebraska.
Dewey took the New Hampshire primary from
