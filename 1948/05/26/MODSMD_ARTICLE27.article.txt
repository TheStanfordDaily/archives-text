# 200,000 College Graduates Jobs Plentiful—But Not Always Choice
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP)—More than 200,000 college
graduates, an all-time record, will "commence" their
adult careers in the next few weeks.
They will find plenty of jobs available, but not
necessarily the kind they are looking for.
That was the forecast issued today by two federal
agencies which keep tab on such things: the U. S.
Oflice of Education and the Bureau of Labor Statis
tics.
The education oflice said it is difficult to estimate
in advance just how many sheepskins the nation's
colleges and universities will give out because so
many veterans are included. The veterans returned
to school at various levels of advancement, and upset
the system of calculating the number of graduates
by the size of the previous fall's enrollment.
Total enrollment in colleges, when the opening
bells tolled last September, was 2,.Tj8,226, about half
of whom were veterans.
Oil the basis of that enrollment, the education
office expects "well over 200.000" to graduate by
June.
As for the job outlook, the overall situation is
highly promising, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Commissioner Ewan Clague predicted recently that
toaal U. S. employment will soar this summer above

the all-time record of 60.000.000 jobs reached last
year.
But this optimistic outlook doesn't necessarily mean
that college graduates will be able to find a "good
job in just the field they want to enter.
A spokesman said the bureau hopes to release an
up-to-date report soon on the job-opening situation
in a number ot specific fields. In the meantime, he
pointed to the employment outlook studies the
bureau compiled on more than 200 trades and pro
fessions during 1946 and 1947. Many of these studies
cover the long-range otulook and are more or less
applicable today.
They report "very good opportunities'' for doctors,
dentists, nurses, laboratory and X-ray technicians.
But budding lawyers are warned that the legal pro
fession is "somewhat overcrowded and likely to be
come more so in the next few years."

WASHINGTON (UP)—More than 200,000 college
graduates, an all-time record, will "commence" their
adult careers in the next few weeks.
They will find plenty of jobs available, but not
necessarily the kind they are looking for.
That was the forecast issued today by two federal
agencies which keep tab on such things: the U. S.
Oflice of Education and the Bureau of Labor Statis
tics.
The education oflice said it is difficult to estimate
in advance just how many sheepskins the nation's
colleges and universities will give out because so
many veterans are included. The veterans returned
to school at various levels of advancement, and upset
the system of calculating the number of graduates
by the size of the previous fall's enrollment.
Total enrollment in colleges, when the opening
bells tolled last September, was 2,.Tj8,226, about half
of whom were veterans.
Oil the basis of that enrollment, the education
office expects "well over 200.000" to graduate by
June.
As for the job outlook, the overall situation is
highly promising, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Commissioner Ewan Clague predicted recently that
toaal U. S. employment will soar this summer above

the all-time record of 60.000.000 jobs reached last
year.
But this optimistic outlook doesn't necessarily mean
that college graduates will be able to find a "good
job in just the field they want to enter.
A spokesman said the bureau hopes to release an
up-to-date report soon on the job-opening situation
in a number ot specific fields. In the meantime, he
pointed to the employment outlook studies the
bureau compiled on more than 200 trades and pro
fessions during 1946 and 1947. Many of these studies
cover the long-range otulook and are more or less
applicable today.
They report "very good opportunities'' for doctors,
dentists, nurses, laboratory and X-ray technicians.
But budding lawyers are warned that the legal pro
fession is "somewhat overcrowded and likely to be
come more so in the next few years."
