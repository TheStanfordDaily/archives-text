# If Toyon Is 'Squirrely' Here's The Reason Why
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
There is one Toyon resident who has shown that it isn't so
hard to get a room in the dorm if you know the right people.
The new resident is Gruk, the squirrel, and the man with the
"pull" is Bill Mead, the small animal's new master
Mead explained how the new relationship came about. "He

just adopted me. I was sitting by a
tree, and suddenly the little fellow
appeared. We eyed each other, and
he gave in first and ran up my
trouser leg."
Gruk got his name when the boys
asked the squirrel what his "bud
dies" called him. The animal re
sponded with a raspy "g-r-ruk,"
and thus was he christened.
THE OWNER explained how he
and his roommate, Bill Warren,
weaned the pet with an eye dropper
lor the first week. For the last three
weeks, however, the animal's diet
has included milk, nuts, sunflower
eed, marshmallow, and whatever
he can pilfer from near-by rooms,
lie drinks water by edging along
the side of the water basin and
catching water dripping from the
faucet.
"Gruk's a very messy eater," ex
plained Mead, "but what he doesn't
clean up the birds do.
Since the boys and the squirrel
adopted each other, the animal has
added three inches to his original
four-inch height. The first week, he
was small enough to take free rides
to the Quad in his owner's pants
pocket.
MEAD TOLD of one of Gruk's
favorite games. The master takes
him to the library, and his pet
climbs up the backs of people's legs
-apparently enjoying the scream
ing and jumping that accompany his
actions.
One of the other Toyon residents
has been awakened by the "minia
ture alarm-clock" when Gruk
crawled in the fellow's open window
and scampered across the sleeper
at 7 a.m.
WARREN, WHEN ASKED how
he likes his new roommate, an
swered, "He's just fine until he
jumps on my bed. lie likes to sleep
with me or in an overcoat pocket
rather than in his artificial box
nest."
He went on to say that the squir
rel dislikes band music—he tried to
escape once when taken to a re
hearsal — but sits contentedly on
Mead's knee when he plays the gui
tar.
This is the first pet the boys have
.wned, but they are jokingly con
idering a chimpanzee for next year!

One of the other Toyon residents
has been awakened by the "minia
ture alarm-clock" when Gruk
crawled in the fellow's open window
and scampered across the sleeper
at 7 a.m.
WARREN, WHEN ASKED how
he likes his new roommate, an
swered, "He's just fine until he
jumps on my bed. lie likes to sleep
with me or in an overcoat pocket
rather than in his artificial box
nest."
He went on to say that the squir
rel dislikes band music—he tried to
escape once when taken to a re
hearsal — but sits contentedly on
Mead's knee when he plays the gui
tar.
This is the first pet the boys have
.wned, but they are jokingly con
idering a chimpanzee for next year!
There is one Toyon resident who has shown that it isn't so
hard to get a room in the dorm if you know the right people.
The new resident is Gruk, the squirrel, and the man with the
"pull" is Bill Mead, the small animal's new master
Mead explained how the new relationship came about. "He

just adopted me. I was sitting by a
tree, and suddenly the little fellow
appeared. We eyed each other, and
he gave in first and ran up my
trouser leg."
Gruk got his name when the boys
asked the squirrel what his "bud
dies" called him. The animal re
sponded with a raspy "g-r-ruk,"
and thus was he christened.
THE OWNER explained how he
and his roommate, Bill Warren,
weaned the pet with an eye dropper
lor the first week. For the last three
weeks, however, the animal's diet
has included milk, nuts, sunflower
eed, marshmallow, and whatever
he can pilfer from near-by rooms,
lie drinks water by edging along
the side of the water basin and
catching water dripping from the
faucet.
"Gruk's a very messy eater," ex
plained Mead, "but what he doesn't
clean up the birds do.
Since the boys and the squirrel
adopted each other, the animal has
added three inches to his original
four-inch height. The first week, he
was small enough to take free rides
to the Quad in his owner's pants
pocket.
