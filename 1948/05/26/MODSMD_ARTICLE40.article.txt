# Varsity Nine Looks Ahead
## 
### BY JOHN HALL 
Baseball was hot stuff for
! somebody this year, but for
Stanford it was just a long tough
season. The Cards were up at
| times, but mostly they were
I down. Their five wins gave them a
1 fourth place in the final CIBA
| standings, but the nine losses they
I picked up along the way kept them
1 firmly rooted in the second division.
Stanford started the season with
one of its supposedly sharpest teams
in recent years. The Indians had
won seven straight practice games,
I but once into the regular season
they lost their winning ways. Their
top efforts were turned in against
UCLA, as they jumped on the Bruins
to take th ur lone series of the year,
two games to one.
AFTER THAT, the depression set
in. Stanford waited until the last
game of a three-game series to blast
California. The sad part of this
story is that the Cards were capable
of beating the Bears any time they
met. Stanford also did a fine fade
job against Santa Clara, as after
beating the Broncs in their first
meeting, they dropped two straight to
the struggling San Jose men.
After dropping three more to USC,
Stanford split a two-game series with
St. Mary's and that was the season.
Nothing too much to brag about, but
still a season. It must be said that
Stanford was much better than the
record indicates.
STANFORD LOSES only four
men, so next year the squad should
at least be more experienced. Cap
tain Ted Nell, one of the top de
fensive center-fielders in the league,
wil head the list of departers. Nell
was selected on Santa Clara's all
opponent team.
Frank MacGraw, veteran catcher
and cleanup man, Buck Brownson
a hot and cold stortstop, and out
fielder George Sloat are the others
who will leave. All four held down
first-string positions during the sea
son.
Consistent Charlie Cole will give
the returning men a lift. Cole's
stickwork was a shining light in last
season's swing-and-pray hitting at
tack. The way Santa Clara ignored
him on their all-opponent team was
an obvious admission of stupidity.
RILL ARCE will be back at third
for his third season. That ought to
be some kind of an omen. Outfielder
Bob Nava, second-baseman Dave
Melton, and pitchers Dave Dahle
and Dave Stott are the other regu
lars who will be returning.
