## Tennis Teams Prep for Cal 
### 
Stanford's varsity and frosh ten
nis squads are concentrating on in
dividual play all this week in hopes
of giving the California Bears a
thorough drubbing bef or e the
Berkeley fans Saturday.
For the varsity squad the match
wil break the 5 to 5 win-loss tie
record compiled this season. Stan
lost to the nationally-great USF
team at the beginning of the season.
Snice then USC and UCLA have
each beaten the Cards twice.
The only conference team beaten
by the Stanford net men has been
Cal, and the boys feel confident of
a second win.
They were confident in the sec
ond match against COP, whom they
beat easily in their first meeting.
Bnut COP's Hank Pfister and Don
Hamilton surprised by sweeping
the one and two singles and added
to the one and two doubles win.
Only Stanford's depth of ability, con
tributed by Lucien Barbour, Fred
Lewis, Errol Lycette, Dave Basham,
and Bob Forbes saved the day.
Since the last Cal match Bob
Lewis has taken over the No. 1 slot
on Stanford's varsity squad. Lu
cien Barbour, who has steadily
climbed the tennis ladder into the
No. 3 position, successfully defended
his standing in a match with Fred
Lewis yesterday.
The frosh tennis men, who have a
win-loss score of 7 to 2 this season,
will have a major change in the
lineup against Cal Saturday. Vincent
Schmeider, in a challenge match
yesterday, defeated No. 1 Dick Me
chemfi who has held that position
all season,
The Stanford freshmen slapped the
Cal frosh with an 8 to 0 whitewash
defeat in the last match. The meet
ing of both the Card tennis squads
with the Cal men is almost a certain
walkaway for Stanford.
