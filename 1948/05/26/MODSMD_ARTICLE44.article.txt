# PCC Meet Draws Northern Trackmen
## Daily Sports 
### BY DWIGHT WILBUR 
With the Southern Division
teams taking the spotlight dur
ing the regular track season, one
is apt to forget the Northern Di
vision stars when it comes to
the Pacific Coast Conference track
meet.
The six Northern Division teams
that compete in the PCC are Uni
versity of Washington, Washington
State. Oregon, Oregon State, Idaho,
and Montana. These teams have a
great disadvantage in that a great
deal of their track season has heavy
rain. The season is much shorter,
and the athletes don't round into
shape as early as they do in the
Southern Division.
TWO NEW MEET records were
last Saturday and, on the whole,
the athletes' marks were fairly good.
The star of the meet was Ras
mussen of Oregon, who set a pole
vault record of 14 feet 2 inches.
Rasmussen recently competed in the
Fresno Relays, and has been over
14 feet most of the season. He will
receive some rough competition
from Montgomery Hart of Southern
Cul, Paddock of the Bears, and Bill
Larson of Stanford.
The Washington State mile relay
team, composed of Eischen, Whelihar,
Keniston, and Nebolon, broke the old
record of 3:17.3 by one-tenth of a
second. The Cougar team probably
will give USC, Stanford and Cal
squads a close battle. All four teams
are far from the PCC record of
3:12.3 made by WSC in 1937.

bolon, ripped off a 47.5-second quar
ter mile in the regular event. This
is a full second better than any
Southern Division man has done this
season in the straight 440. How
ever, Larry Hoff of Stanford, Wells
DeLoach of Southern Cal, Bob
Cooper of Cal and others wil give
Nebolon a good race.
Parnell of WSC, who has run the
half mile in the low one-fifties, was
beatne in a surprise by Henesy of
the Washington Huskies in the fast
time of 1:54.3. Parnell, Henesy, and
Bob Chambers of USC will make it
quite a battle, not to mention George
Grimes of the Cards, Ralph Gold, and
Frank Fletcher of UCLA, and Dick
Cotton of Cal.
THE MILE WAS won in a tie by
Eischen and Paeth of WSC in the
good time of 4:23.1. Wold of Wash
ington snared the two-mile in 9:47.
Other marks in the Northern Di
vision meet were: 100-yard dash—
9.8; 220-yard dash—2l.B; Shot put—
47 feet 2 inches; Discus—lsl feet 10
7 1(5 inches; Broad Jump—24 feet 2
inches; High Jump—6 feet 15/8
inches; High Hurdles—l4.S seconds:
and Low Hurdles—24.4 seconds.


THIS TENSE ACTION was the thrilling end of the 100-yard dash in the
Big Meet. DONNIE ANDERSON of Cal had already crossed the finish
line in (irst place, hut try to pick second and third places! Left to right:
