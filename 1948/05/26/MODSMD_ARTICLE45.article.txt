# Cards Increase NL Lead; Yanks Move Up, A's Slip
## 
### 
The continued National League
leadership by the St. Louis Cardi
nals and the rise of the New York
i Yankees in the American League
| last week seems to point toward a
| repeat of the '42 and '43 seasons
i when the two teams battled it out
I in the World Series.
The Cards increased their lead in
the senior circuit by running up a
| six-game winning streak during the
| past week. Veterans like Stan
j Musial, Enos Slaughter, George
i "Whitey' Kurowski, Terry Moore,
1 and Marty Marion were still playing
j top notch ball and showing no signs
of slowing up.
THE NEW YORK GIANTS, get
j ting surprise pitching help from such
| pre-season question marks as Dave
j Koslo and Indian castoff Ray Poat,
! hung on to second place. Sophomore
i Larry Jansen and rookie Sheldon
■ Jones have kept up their early sea
! son performances and give Mel Ott's
! powerhouse the necessary mound
I strength.
i Ralph Kiner's punch and veteran
i Elmer Riddle's comeback as a de-
I pendable hurler have helped to keep
i the Pittsburghs in the first division
j longer than expected. However, the
Boston Braves, second choice in the
j pre-season betting, finally untangled
• themselves from the mires of the
; second division to move into conten-
I tion.
JOHNNY SAIN. Warren Spahn,
! and Bill Voiselle are three top
! pitchers that will give any team
| trouble. With Tommy Holmes hit -
i ting in the .400 class and Eddie
I Stanky sparkplugging the infield the
j Braves will always be a threat.
The Philadelphia Phillies are tield
j ing a young, hustling team for the
j most part and could easily push into
, the first division if somebody fal
| ters. Graybeards like "Schoolboy"
! Rowe and "Dutch" Leonard give the

pitching staff the stability it needs.
The rest of the league just doesn't
figure to raise any commotion. Even
Rickey's Duroeher-inspired team
can't be expected to do much after
an eight-game losing streak at home
dropped them into the dank regions.
CONNIE MACKS Athletics fi
nally showed signs of folding as they
dropped three in a row. including
two to Cleveland. Injuries to key
pitchers and stiffcr opposition slowed
down the A's.
Gene Bearden, ex-Oakland Acorn,
whipped the Mackmen in one game
and added another win later in the
week to bring jov to Indian manager
Lou Boudreau. Another pitcher
would help take the strain off the
two Bobs—Feller and Lemon.
JOE DIMAGGIO almost single
handedly awakened the drowsing
Yankees last week. Joe boosted his
average some 30-odd points as his
mid-week spree pulled the Yankees
to within only two games off the
pace.
Joe McCarthy ran into pitching
trouble up to his ears last week as
Joe couldn't even find a thrower to
stop the weak Chicago White Sox.
Teddy Lyons' hapless Pale Hose rose
up from the depths to smite down
the highly touted Beantowners in a
Sunday double header. Unless Joe
finds a stopper, it looks like the
Red Sox duel with the Yankees will
be a dud.
From here it looks a lot like '42
and '43 again in Big League base
ball. —Blood.
