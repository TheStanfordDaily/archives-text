With their regular season drawing
to a close this Saturday, Stanford's
vastly-improved golfers are eyeing
the nationals late next month, which
j will be played over their home
j course. The Indians take on the
alumni in a return match on Satur
j day and that will be their last out
i ing before June 28 when the national
intercollegiates get under way.
Previously in the season, on April
10, Coach Twiggs' men took the
alumni into camp by a 16-11 count
and don't count on too much trou
ble in this return meeting. The
men who will probably start this
match are Tom Lambie. Jack Shu
j ler, Bill Lowe. Bob Crozier, Bud
j Moe, and Ernie Kellberg.
LAMBIE AND SHULER are sen
iors and will not be back for compe
tition next season.
The Cards can look back on a
very successful 19-18 season, having
lost only two dual matches out of
eight, having copped second-place
honors in the .Northern California
I Intercollegiates, and having taken
the team title in the recent PCC
I tourney.
The only losses of the season were
| to San Jose State and USC and the
first one later was avenged. Vic
j lories were scored over California.
| which was downed twice. UCLA,
Santa Clara, the alumni, and San
Jose.
THE SPARTANS provided the
stifl'est competition for the Indians
during the season. In their first
meeting, April 17 in San Jose, the
Spartans eked out a 14' a to 12Va win.
Stanford gained sweet revenge in a
i return match on May 15. coming
through with a 14-13 victory. San
Jose finished two strokes ahead of
the Farm men at the Northern In
tercollegiates to take first place in
! that tourney.
The loss to the Trojans in Los
: Angeles by the count of o2 to 22
may be partly explained by the fact
that the Stanford team was not able
j to get in even a few practice swings
belore teeing oft' time. They played
] over the L.A. Country Club course

for the first time when they started
the USC match.
Stanford will be out to uphold its
enviable record in the nationals next
month. Coach Eddie Twiggs' teams
finished first in '38, '39, '41, '42. and
'46. In 1935 they came in third and
the next year took a second. They
finished fourth in 1939.
STRONGEST COMPETITION in
this year's nationals wial probably
come from LSU and Michigan,
The Bayou Bengals from Louisiana,
finished first in last year's tourney
which was he'd at Ann Arbor, Mich.
Speaking of enviable records,
Stanford can point with pride to the
one it has compiled since Coach
Twiggs took over in 1932. Since that
date, the Cards have won eight titles
in the southern division of the PCC
If any individual men on this year's
squad can be singled out for praise
they are Tom Lambie and Bud Aloe.
Lambie, a veteran of last season,
has turned in sparkling perform
ances all year. Against San Jose on
the 15th of this month, he fired
couple of 695. This was perhaps the
highlight of the season for Tom.
Moe is playing his first season u?
a regular and has shown so much im
provement that he will be counteJ
on for heavy duty next year.

Moe is playing his first season u?
a regular and has shown so much im
provement that he will be counteJ
on for heavy duty next year.
With their regular season drawing
to a close this Saturday, Stanford's
vastly-improved golfers are eyeing
the nationals late next month, which
j will be played over their home
j course. The Indians take on the
alumni in a return match on Satur
j day and that will be their last out
i ing before June 28 when the national
intercollegiates get under way.
Previously in the season, on April
10, Coach Twiggs' men took the
alumni into camp by a 16-11 count
and don't count on too much trou
ble in this return meeting. The
men who will probably start this
match are Tom Lambie. Jack Shu
j ler, Bill Lowe. Bob Crozier, Bud
j Moe, and Ernie Kellberg.
LAMBIE AND SHULER are sen
iors and will not be back for compe
tition next season.
The Cards can look back on a
very successful 19-18 season, having
lost only two dual matches out of
eight, having copped second-place
honors in the .Northern California
I Intercollegiates, and having taken
the team title in the recent PCC
I tourney.
The only losses of the season were
| to San Jose State and USC and the
first one later was avenged. Vic
j lories were scored over California.
| which was downed twice. UCLA,
Santa Clara, the alumni, and San
Jose.
THE SPARTANS provided the
stifl'est competition for the Indians
during the season. In their first
meeting, April 17 in San Jose, the
Spartans eked out a 14' a to 12Va win.
Stanford gained sweet revenge in a
i return match on May 15. coming
through with a 14-13 victory. San
Jose finished two strokes ahead of
the Farm men at the Northern In
tercollegiates to take first place in
! that tourney.
The loss to the Trojans in Los
: Angeles by the count of o2 to 22
may be partly explained by the fact
that the Stanford team was not able
j to get in even a few practice swings
belore teeing oft' time. They played
] over the L.A. Country Club course

for the first time when they started
the USC match.
Stanford will be out to uphold its
enviable record in the nationals next
month. Coach Eddie Twiggs' teams
finished first in '38, '39, '41, '42. and
'46. In 1935 they came in third and
the next year took a second. They
finished fourth in 1939.
STRONGEST COMPETITION in
this year's nationals wial probably
come from LSU and Michigan,
The Bayou Bengals from Louisiana,
finished first in last year's tourney
which was he'd at Ann Arbor, Mich.
Speaking of enviable records,
Stanford can point with pride to the
one it has compiled since Coach
Twiggs took over in 1932. Since that
date, the Cards have won eight titles
in the southern division of the PCC
If any individual men on this year's
squad can be singled out for praise
they are Tom Lambie and Bud Aloe.
Lambie, a veteran of last season,
has turned in sparkling perform
ances all year. Against San Jose on
the 15th of this month, he fired
couple of 695. This was perhaps the
highlight of the season for Tom.
