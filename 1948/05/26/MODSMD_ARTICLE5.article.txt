# Trip to Moon Tuesday Topic

### 
Man's conquest of the air would
probably not surprise our ancestors
of the 16th and 17th centuries, said
Dr. Marjorie Nicolson of Columbia
University last night on the Tues
day Evening Series. Instead they
would very likely wonder why we
had not done more.

SPEAKING ON "Voyages to the
Moon" at the annual open meeting
of Stanford's Phi Beta Kappas in
Memorial Auditorium, Dr. Nicolson
told the results of her extensive

studies of man's schemes to conquer
the space between earth and the
planets.
Two centuries ago, she said, peo
ple thought it would only be a mat
ter of a few years before everybody
owned his own pair of wings with
which he could make regular trips
to the moon. Plans were laid by
various European powers for colo
nization; England especially was
certain that this satellite could be
added to her growing empire.
IT WAS GALILEO who first made
the world "moon conscious," Dr.
Nicolson declared, by his discovery
that "it is not a smooth, shining
planet, but a world very similar to
our own."
Since then. Jonathan Swift, Lewis
Carroll, H. G. Wells, and even the
great scientist Kepler have toyed
with the idea of traveling to other
worlds.
Modern conceptions of voyages to
the moon have become increasingly
technological, and have been made
more plausible, she said, but un
fortunately the enchantment and
the humor contained in older ver
sions has been lost.
