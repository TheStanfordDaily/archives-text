### 
WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP) —The presidents of 21 railwa
labor unions demanded tonight that the government nationali:
the railroads on either a temporary or permanent basis.
They said the government had seized the railroads and de
prived the unions of their right to strike but had given "nothin

► in return."
"We demand that the government
having designated itself as the lega'
operator of the railroads, assume the
full responsibilities of their opera
tion; and that the government take
control of the revenues of the rail
roads as it already has taken con
! trol of the employees of the raii-
I roads," the union leaders said in i
j formal resolution.
THE RESOLUTION was adopte
at a secret meeting, and the unio
| chiefs explained their position at
press conference later.
They said the government ha
, thrown itself on the side of the ran
! roads and had "assumed the role o
| a strike-breaking agency" durin
j the recent walkout threat, which re
sulted in President Truman seizing
| the line and turning operation over
| to the army.
TIIEY CALLED upon the govern
| ment to take "full and complete"
! control of the roads and then enter
into direct negotiations with the en
gineers. firemen, and switchmen om
new contract terms.
