# Israel to Halt Hostilities If Arabs Meet Deadline
## 
### 
TEL AVIV, Israel, May 26 (UP) —The Israel government sa:i
tonight that it had decided to order its troops to cease fire on a:
fronts at 9 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) provided that the Arabs ceased firi
at the same time.
This is the deadline for the extended United Nations cease fix--

* demand, which the Arabs had al
i ready said they would reject.
I Hence it was assumed that the
; Jewish troops, after stopping then
I fire, would resume.
When the original cease fire dead
line came at 9 p.m. Monday, ths
i Jews stopped firing for hours,
i waiting to see if the Arabs would
j follow their example in compliance
with the UN demand.
EARLIER, IT HAD APPEARET
likely that no cease fire order woul •
given unless the Arabs previous •
ly made known an acceptance of th
UN demand.
Delayed reports from Jerusale
; said fighting reached a peak the.
| last night.
The Arab states formally reject 112
the United Nations appeal for an u
conditional truce in Palestine tod.;
; and gave the UN Security Coun;
48 hours to lay down specific cond
tions for a Holy Land cease fi.
agreement.
THE SEVEN-NATION leagu
served notice that its terms for
halt in the war would be virtua
I dissolution of the 11-day-old Jewisi
State of Israel.
The league promised to stand by
for two days in Amman, capital
Trans-Jordan, to "study" any specifi .
| proposals the security council migh r
sugegst for a solution of the Ps"-
I estine problem.
The 48-hour time limit did no
appear to rule out Arab consideratio
i of later UN appeals or orders, bu
stemmed chiefly from the fact th?
the Arab League's political commit
tee had planned to adjourn indefin -
itely today or tomorrow.
Leaving no doubt the rift wa
I widening between the U. S. an;
British governments on Palestine. _■
British Foreign Office spokesman
said bluntly that Washington report.-;
of Mr. Truman's conversation with
Dr. Chaim Weizmann, provisional
president of Israel, might lead Arab
! states to reject the United Nations'
"cease fire" appeal, definitely.
