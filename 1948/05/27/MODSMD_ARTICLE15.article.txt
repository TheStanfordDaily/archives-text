WASHINGTON, May 2G (UP)
President Truman appealed person
ally to House speaker Joseph W.
Martin Jr. today for Congress tu
provide federal aid for education.
The Senate has passed a federal
aid education bill but House leaders
have been holding up such spending
programs until they see how much
the defense budget and foreign aid
will cost.
Martin said he referred the Presi
dent's letter to the House Education
and Labor Committee, which has the
Senate bill, without comment.
