# GOP Passes Controversial Trade Issue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 26 (UP) â€”
House Republicans today beat down
administration objections and passed
a bill extending the reciprocal trade
act for only one year in a modified
form.
The measure now goes to the Sen
ate where early supporting action is
expected.
The GOP-sponsored move opened
the way to possible future changes
in United States tariff policy, and
put the issue squarely in the middle
of the coming presidential campaign.
The bill not only cuts down the
future life of the present program
but restricts the President's arbi
trary right to fix discputed tariffs
by giving Congress the right to veto
them. For that reason Mr. Tru
man may veto it.
The roll call vote was 234 to 149
It came after the House turned back.
211 to 169. a Democratic attempt to
send the bill back to committee for
revision. On this latter vote. 17 Re
publicans crossed party lines to voU
with the Democrats while six Demo
crats voted with the majority.
