PROFESSOR GILBERT SMITH exhibits a number of test tubes contain
ing one-celled algae. I)r. Smith has spent IS months in research work
in an attempt to determine why the algae mate under the influence of
light. He is still in the dark, but he is prepared to spend two more
years 011 the project. If he can discover a method to encourage algae
to mate in darkness, Dr. Smith may be able to open a new field in
