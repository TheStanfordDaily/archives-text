## Why Not 3.2? 
### 
Since the end of the war, administration and student body
officials have many times said they believed more social func
tions should be held on campus. They have felt helpless in the
face of an increasing number of requests for off-campus dances,
picnics, and various other recreational activities. The principal
reason for such requests was, and is, the prohibition of liquor on
the Stanford campus.
If students cannot have liquor at dances here on campus, they
will hold their dances off campus. Both ASSU and University
officers have repeatedly said "the situation is regrettable, but
what can we do about it?"
Three solutions are possible:
1. Enforce present liquor regulations. This would require an
enormous University Gestapo and spy system. Salaries required
for an increased police force could better be used to pay pro
fessors.
2. Keep the regulations on the books but look the other way
at violations. From time to time this has been the policy. It not
only does not work, it fosters an unhealthy attitude in this place
where the Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard are the
soul of the University.
3. The third and, in our opinion, the only feasible solution is
tc change University and ASSU regulations which prohibit liquor
on campus. Such a move would allow 3.2 beer to be sold and
consumed on campus instead of in some joint three or four miles
distant. It's a good bet that each year several Stanford students
would still be alive rather than splattered down the side of Por
tola Road.
There are many objections to this plan. In the first place, most
persons in the area believe state laws prohibit liquor here. But
Section 172 a of the State Penal Code reads in part . . provided
that the provisions of this section shall not apply to nor prohibit
the sale, gift, or exposing or offering for sale of beer, lager beer,
ele, porter, wine, similar fermented malt or vinous liquor, or fruit
juice containing .5 per cent or more of alcohol by volume and
not more than 3.2 per cent of alcohol by weight." Therefore
nothing but precedent and tradition prohibit beer here.
Some will object to 3.2 beer on the basis of tradition. But
didn't Mrs. Stanford request there be no smoking on the Quad?
Is the liquor tradition any more sacred? And are not the lives
cf several students per year worth more than a tradition? In
IS9I students pretty much had to stay on campus and the ban
was effective. Now it takes five minutes to get to one of a dozen
bars.
Alumni will dislike the plan merely because "that's the way
the old Farm was when I was there. We don't want any change."
Those alumni ought to see the campus on a Friday afternoon or
Saturday night. The gasoline used to get away from campus
would send several fleets of B-29's around the globe.
"Allowing beer on campus would open the door to hard
liquor. The campus would be full of drunks." We don't think
so. State laws prohibit hard liquor here; allowing beer would
not change that. We don't think there is a drunkenness or hard
liquor problem at other colleges where beer only is allowed.
We think permitting the sale of 3.2 beer on campus is the
best solution to the recurring liquor problem.
If you ASSU and Administration leaders are sincere in your
wishes to do something about it, seriously and aggressively con
sider this solution. We think it will put an end to one of the
knottier predicaments now facing Stanford.

was effective. Now it takes five minutes to get to one of a dozen
bars.
Alumni will dislike the plan merely because "that's the way
the old Farm was when I was there. We don't want any change."
Those alumni ought to see the campus on a Friday afternoon or
Saturday night. The gasoline used to get away from campus
would send several fleets of B-29's around the globe.
"Allowing beer on campus would open the door to hard
liquor. The campus would be full of drunks." We don't think
so. State laws prohibit hard liquor here; allowing beer would
not change that. We don't think there is a drunkenness or hard
liquor problem at other colleges where beer only is allowed.
We think permitting the sale of 3.2 beer on campus is the
best solution to the recurring liquor problem.
If you ASSU and Administration leaders are sincere in your
wishes to do something about it, seriously and aggressively con
sider this solution. We think it will put an end to one of the
knottier predicaments now facing Stanford.
Since the end of the war, administration and student body
officials have many times said they believed more social func
tions should be held on campus. They have felt helpless in the
face of an increasing number of requests for off-campus dances,
picnics, and various other recreational activities. The principal
reason for such requests was, and is, the prohibition of liquor on
the Stanford campus.
If students cannot have liquor at dances here on campus, they
will hold their dances off campus. Both ASSU and University
officers have repeatedly said "the situation is regrettable, but
what can we do about it?"
Three solutions are possible:
1. Enforce present liquor regulations. This would require an
enormous University Gestapo and spy system. Salaries required
for an increased police force could better be used to pay pro
fessors.
2. Keep the regulations on the books but look the other way
at violations. From time to time this has been the policy. It not
only does not work, it fosters an unhealthy attitude in this place
where the Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard are the
soul of the University.
3. The third and, in our opinion, the only feasible solution is
tc change University and ASSU regulations which prohibit liquor
on campus. Such a move would allow 3.2 beer to be sold and
consumed on campus instead of in some joint three or four miles
distant. It's a good bet that each year several Stanford students
would still be alive rather than splattered down the side of Por
tola Road.
There are many objections to this plan. In the first place, most
persons in the area believe state laws prohibit liquor here. But
Section 172 a of the State Penal Code reads in part . . provided
that the provisions of this section shall not apply to nor prohibit
the sale, gift, or exposing or offering for sale of beer, lager beer,
ele, porter, wine, similar fermented malt or vinous liquor, or fruit
juice containing .5 per cent or more of alcohol by volume and
not more than 3.2 per cent of alcohol by weight." Therefore
nothing but precedent and tradition prohibit beer here.
Some will object to 3.2 beer on the basis of tradition. But
didn't Mrs. Stanford request there be no smoking on the Quad?
Is the liquor tradition any more sacred? And are not the lives
cf several students per year worth more than a tradition? In
IS9I students pretty much had to stay on campus and the ban
was effective. Now it takes five minutes to get to one of a dozen
bars.
