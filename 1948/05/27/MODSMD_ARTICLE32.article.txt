# CAMPUS OPINION
## Tuition Raise 
### 
To the Editor:
We wish to commend the recent decision of the University to raise
tuition fees. This we believe will keep most of the riff-raff out of Stanford
after this summer.
It will be a pleasure to see the old decrepit 1941 ancf* 1942 Cadillacs
go and be supplanted by the newer models which will give the campus
a much better appearance.
We will feel a tug at our heartstrings, however, when Belt's. Rossot's,
and Carlun's will fold from lack of beer-drinking students. For, of course,
the new Stanford student will drink nothing but imported Scotch.
These and*many other changes will all be attractive components of the
"New Rook" at Stanford.
