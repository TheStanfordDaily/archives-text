## Battle for Holy Land Is Four-Way Conflict 
### BY DOUG ANDERSON United Press Staff Correspondent 
The battle for the Holy Land is a four-way conflict
•—a fighting war between Jews and Arabs and an
almost equally bitter political dispute between the
leaders of Trans-Jordan, Egypt, and Syria-Lebanon.
Israel's aims are reasonably clear—to hold the
ground they have gained in the 30-year development
of the Jewish homeland and to consolidate their
newly-won independence.
Arab strategy is obscured by uncertainty as to
exactly what they want in the Holy Land and what
they will do with it if they get it.
King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan and King Farouk of
Egypt, the major contenders for leadership of the
Arab world, have declared flatly that they oppose any
Jewish state in the Middle East.
Lesser Arab leaders have implied that they would
be satisfied with clear title to the land conceded to
the Moslems by the United Nations partition plan.
In the first week of lighting, Arab forces have
stuck closely to the areas granted they by the parti
tion plan, coming into open ground conflict with the
Jews only in "neutral" Jerusalem and in Northern
Arab areas invaded by Israeli forces.
Many observers believe that the Arabs, despite
their superior numbers and equipment, will stop
short of total war with Israel's hardy defenders
strengthened by good leadership and the despera
tion of men fighting for their homes.
The UN cease-fire demand, accepted Sunday by
Israeli leaders, may be seized on by the Arabs as an
oportunity to avoid a pitched battle with the main
Jewish force.
The present disposition of the Arabs places them
in position for a three-pronged attack on Tel Aviv
which could be the crucial battle of the Palestine
war. Disagreement among Arab leadex-s makes it
seem likely that the order for an all-out assault will
never be given.
A successful attack on Tel Aviv would require
coordination of the forces of Egypt, already encamped
on the coastal plain within 30 miles of the Israeli
capital; Trans-Jordan, controlling the western and
northern approaches, and Iraq and Syria, which
would presumably be expected to back up the Trans-
Jordan thrust.
Abdullah would probably be happy to throw his
tought, well-equipped Arab Legion into a battle
which might take him a step nearer accomplishment
of his dream of a "Greater Syria" a single Arab state
including Trans-Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and all or
part of Palestine.
Farouk, however, might hold back from a final
battle which could strengthen Abdullah's campaign
for Arab leadership. The young Republics of Syria
and Lebanon are obviously unenthusiastic about the
Greater Syria scheme, and Iraq is not eager to have
a strong, expanding nation on its borders.
Arab differences were reportedly patched-up, at
least temporarily, at a meeting in Amman of the
leaders of Trans-Jordan, Syria. Lebanon, and Iraq to
discuss the UN questionnaires on invasion of the
Holy Land.
Egypt's absence from the meeting may have been
significant.
Decisions reached at the four-nation meeting have
not been announced. Arab reaction to the UN cease
fire demand will probably give the first clear indi
cation of the Arab world's final plan for Palestine.
