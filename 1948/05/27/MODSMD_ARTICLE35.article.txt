When is a professor good and when is one bad?
Is the ideal instructor one who cracks the best jokes,
or is lie a man who speaks over the heady of awe
inspired students? Definitions of good and poor
teachers are as numerous as the potential Republican
party candidates.
One man told me he gauged his instructors by their
ability to instill an initiative in his students to study

and learn the course. A poor
professor, on the other hand, is
the man lacking in color, per
suasion, interest in his course.

A letter in The Daily's March 3
Campus Opinion column dis
cussed American college profes
sors' teaching ability. The writer
said that one of his courses was
so poorly presented that he
gained very little out of it in
proportion to the amount of re
quired work he put on the

course. He wrote that most of his poor professors
stood high in their departments, were friendly, and
seemed to be sincerely interested in teaching; yet,
none of them realized the confusion they produced
in their students' minds.
I spoke to several men about this ability to teach
issue. They described the qualities they expect to
find in the "ideal" instructor:
1. In order to carry proper emphasis and sequence,
a good professor has a good speaking voice that is
free from monotony. He puts the point of the sub
ject over clearly and concisely. Lectures follow in
a logical sequence.
2. Our bcrst professors put difficult courses on a
level that students can easily understand. It is to
be taken for granted that the instructor understands
his own course, but he must prove it to his students
during his lectures.
3. If a man can make his argument interesting his
audience can follow him easier. Anecdotes flavored
with humor are ideal in this respect. Stanford has
instructors in the economics, history, and humani
ties departments who conduct enjoyable, easily un
derstood courses because each man uses humor for
emphasis.
4. If a subject i> to be of value to us students, the
professor must be able to inspire his audience to
take an active part in thinking and doing creative
work on the course. In evaluating his students, the
professor should (especially in the smaller classes)
grade on an unorthodox basis. Exams never have
been a satisfactory means to score an individual's
ability.
5. Although their non-class time is limited, good
college professors are anxious to devote their free
time to meeting students and discussing subjects rel
ative to their academic work.
(>. Open-minded instructors will be liberal m their
teaching. They permit class discussion, and they
alter their ideas to conform with their students' if
adequate discussion proves the professor wrong.
This scale for grading instructors, then, centers on
informality and conciseness. Many of Stanford's poor
professors are relatively new to the University and
to the teaching field. Some of them have been show
ing consistent improvement.
It is not fair to our faculty to evaluate their teach
ing ability by a small number of dull instructors.
Next year's tuition raise is designed to give a salary
incentive for good men to come and teach at Stan
ford. Our school can go a long way toward improv
ing an academic slump, begun here during the war,
with better salaries for faculty members.
