## Senator Baldwin Says Stuffed-Shirt Republican Party Is Cone

RAYMOND E. BALDWIN
HARTFORD. Conn. (UP). —Sen. Raymond Earl
Baldwin achieved national prominence in 1944 when
he was re-elected Governor of Connecticut, one ot'
the few Republicans to survive (he Roosevelt victory
in the state.
Two years later lie was elected to the Senate,
confounding the Democrats, who had ascribed his
1941 triumph to "a fluke."
It was not the first time that Baldwin had dealt the
Democrats a setback. Six years before, when he
first ran for Governor, he broke up an eight-year
opposition monopoly.
The Republican party prestige was at a new low.
The old party boss. J. Henry Rorahack, who ruled
for a quarter of a century, was dead. Leadership
was lacking, and Baldwin was persuaded to become
the standard-bearer. He agreed, with no strings
attached, and the lirst thing he told the voters was:
"The day of the stuffed-shirt Republican party is
iione. If we cannot make a new party out of it, I
say to hell with it. Let's throw it out of the window."
There was a striking parallel between that in
troduction to state politics and Baldwin's debut as
freshman U.S. Senator from Connecticut in 1946.
Sent to Washington with the greatest plurality

given a candidate for any office, he immediately
resented the exclusion of the junior Senators from
the "inner circles" of elder statesmen.
He rallied 1(5 freshman Senators and demanded
they be given a louder voice in party affairs. De
nouncing what he called the "rock-ribbed villra-
of the Senate leadership. Baldwin
warned that "if we act in the interest only of a
minority, we shall again quickly become the minority
party."
Continuance of "stufTed-shirtism" in the high
command, he said, would jeopardize (lie party's
chances in the I!)4S election. The Old (uiard re
lented.
Back home, state leaders approved. In an unprece
dented move the state centra! committee unanimous
ly endorsed him as a "favorite son' candidate for
President. That pledged him the state's 1(5 delegates
on the national convention's first ballot. They were
prepared to hold out if his chances looked better
after that gesture of confidence.
By profession. Baldwin is a lawyer. He is a
graduate of Wesleyan University and Yale.
A hearty man with a ready handshake, Baldwin is
adept at maintaining£ood public relations. He makes
an impressive platform appearance.
The Baldwins have three children, all bay**-
