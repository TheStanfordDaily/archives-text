# Grad Smuggles Pet Ocelot to States
## Ferocious Feline Bites Dog's Feet 
### BY DIXIE BOOTH 
Father suddenly said we'd take
her—just like that, explained educa
tion grad Phyllis Riley concerning
the baby ocelot she acquired in Car
tagena, Colombia, last quarter.
"Indians bring them out of the
jungle four or five at a time, and
Dad thought it would be fun to
have one on the ship," she continued.
They managed to have the little cat
smuggled aboard the "Stella Polaris,"
a Norwegian ship, by one of the
two American waiters in the crew.
Caribe, affectionately named after
the Colombian hotel, was hidden in
the laundry until the ship's officers
finally got wind of the affair.
"Then we brought her up on deck
and had a wonderful time," remi
nisced the auburn-haired Miss Riley.
CARIBE', ALIAS STELLAN, Nor
wegion for "Stella," or just plain
"Ocy," is at present a resident on
campus, for, as Phyl says, "My
mother refused to take care of her."
Back at Miss Riley's home in Reno
last March, the cat made headlines
in the Nevada State Journal when
she scampered out of her abode in
the Riley garage and was missing
for two days. An article stressing
the family's anxiety for their pet
brought word that the creature had
strayed a few doors away.
VIVID BLACK and orange nickel
sized spots and stripes adorn the
young feline: she has a white vest
and paws. Her nose is soft pink
instead of the typical dark color
found in most cats. She springs
rather than walks, moving her extra
large paws with amazing agility.
The ocelot enjoys biting dogs' feet
when ever she gets the chance.
Caribe is disarmingly friendly and
wiil even go so far as to lick those
she especially likes with her rough,
red tongue. She generally prefers
men, but she has on occasion di

rected her quick temper toward the
stronger sex.
Slie was a startling discovery to j
two students who were offered a |
• ;de by Miss Riley the other day.i
'She leaped up and spit, growled. !
and Hexed her claws,"' described |
her mistress. "The poor boys turned
purple."
NEITHER THE change of climate
nor numerous vaccinations have af
fected Caribe's good health. Miss Ri
ley said that the customs officials !
in New Orleans were rather shaky
at the prospect of inoculating a real j
live tiger, and tried to hide their |
chagrin behind half-hearted grins j
when the cunning little ocelot ap- j
peared.
I want to keep her as long as I
can," sighed Mis Riley. "When she J
grows up I'll try to give her to a
biological house or a veterinarian."
A zoo hasn't even been considered
as Miss Riley feels that her pet
likes to be with people too much.


HOLD THAT TIGER—The cus
toms officials almost did hold "fe

which Phyllis Riley, graduate edu
cation student, smuggled here

Farm.

brought word that the creature had

VIVID BLACK and orange nickel
sized spots and stripes adorn the
young feline: she has a white vest
and paws. Her nose is soft pink
instead of the typical dark color
found in most cats. She springs
rather than walks, moving her extra
large paws with amazing agility.
The ocelot enjoys biting dogs' feet
when ever she gets the chance.
Caribe is disarmingly friendly and

she especially likes with her rough,

men, but she has on occasion di

NEITHER THE change of climate

HOLD THAT TIGER—The cus
toms officials almost did hold "fe
rocious" Caribe, the baby ocelot
which Phyllis Riley, graduate edu
cation student, smuggled here
from Colombia. Caribe is now liv
ing a kingly kitty's life near the
Farm.
Father suddenly said we'd take
her—just like that, explained educa
tion grad Phyllis Riley concerning
the baby ocelot she acquired in Car
tagena, Colombia, last quarter.
"Indians bring them out of the
jungle four or five at a time, and
Dad thought it would be fun to
have one on the ship," she continued.
They managed to have the little cat
smuggled aboard the "Stella Polaris,"
a Norwegian ship, by one of the
two American waiters in the crew.
Caribe, affectionately named after
the Colombian hotel, was hidden in
the laundry until the ship's officers
finally got wind of the affair.
"Then we brought her up on deck
and had a wonderful time," remi
nisced the auburn-haired Miss Riley.
CARIBE', ALIAS STELLAN, Nor
wegion for "Stella," or just plain
"Ocy," is at present a resident on
campus, for, as Phyl says, "My
mother refused to take care of her."

last March, the cat made headlines
in the Nevada State Journal when
she scampered out of her abode in
the Riley garage and was missing
