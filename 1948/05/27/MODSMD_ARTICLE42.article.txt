Stanford's crew will malce their
last showing of the year when a
mixed frosh - jayvee - varsity shell

marked by wins over UCLA and
L'SC and a good showing against
Cal's highly-touted organization.
The Card eight has been working
out all week after a temporary
siesta, and they have been putting
the emphasis upon teamwork and
precision. Difficulties arising from
owing in a strange shell, and with
a combination of oarsmen that has
".ever been together before, has com

At the crew banquet last week
nearly 40 oarsmen, including men
j from Farm crews of years back, met
at Rickey's to pay tribute to their
| coaches and to lay out a list of aims
for next season. Plans call for in
creased emphasis upon frosh coach
ing for a more definite and compre
hensive schedule next spring.

THE ORPHAN CREW started out
last iall with little else but ambi
tion and some cast-off equipment.
Alumni and well-wishers, however,
helped to ease their condition as a
new pair of shells was donated
anonymously and San Francisco
alums gave $700 for new oars. Mr.
A. A. Clark, a former Navy oarsman,
was coaxed to come down and help
on the coaching end, and the ball
started to roll.
A walloping turnout of 60 frosh
turned out fall quarter from which
a score was garnered for winter ses
sion workouts. Five boats worked
out winter quarter, and when the
spring canto came up, workouts were
held at E;3O a.m.
