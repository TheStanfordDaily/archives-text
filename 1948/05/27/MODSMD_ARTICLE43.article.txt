# Jayvee Nine Enjoyed Successful '48 Season
## 
### BY JACK BLOOD 
Bob Peters' Jayvee nine enjoyed a successful, if abbreviated,
season this year. The team won four of the five games it played,
including a split with the California Cinnamon Bears.
The team didn't get organized until mid-way through spring
quarter when ex-varsity second baseman Bob Peters took over

*as coach after his graduation win
ter quarter. Bob ran into problems
in scheduling games but did arrange
| five games for the team.
| MENLOJC was the first game for
! the Jayvees in April, and the Cards
ran away with the ball game, 13 to 5.
Victories over the frosh. Cal Jayvees,
1 and Menlo again ran their streak to
four in a row before the Cinnamon
Bears stopped them in a return game
at Berkeley last week.
The first game with California was
a thriller with the Indians scoring
j in the 10th inning to win, 8 to 7.
j Jack Heinen was the winning pitcher
in this game and he started all
1 the others.
Jack, a right hander, had a very
effective fast ball and was tough in
I the clutch. He is a good varsity
prospect for next season. Supporting
: Jack whenever he tired was Don
Gabrielson, relief pitcher.
Another top varsity propect for
next year is Ray Winterhalter,
i scrappy shortstop. Ray's steady play
| at short was an important factor in
j holding the infield together.
BEHIND THE PLATE, Forrest
I Shumway pulled a Walker Cooper
j by transferring to the mask after
| pitching last year. "Shurn" was a
dependable receiver, and a danger
j ous man with the bat.
Around the infield Bill Freeland at
; first, Harry Reichling at second, and
Pete McCloskey at third played good
ball all year and played a large
1 part in the team's successful year.
, Bill Hurley led the outfielders with
his fine fielding and good hitting.
There was little to choose between
I such dependable fly chasers as Bill
; Dailey, Ken Horth, Miles Shute. and
; George York for the other two spots.
The best way to sum up the Jayvee
| season just over was that it was
! short and sweet.
