# Cole, Arce Make Daily Scribe's All-CIBA Team
## 
### 
No season in any sport can be
called complete until those grand
stand guessers, the sportswriters, get
around to picking a mythical all-star
team. The Daily writers being no
exception, and wishing to get the
jump on the rest of the world, come
up with this aggregation of CIBA
baseball stars.
BILL PRENTICE. OF. This fast
stepping outer-gardener from Santa
Clara was a unanimous choice for
starting berth, mainly because of
his great hustle and .328 batting
average.
CLIFF McCLAIN. OF. California's
batting champion also was a unani
mous choice. Cliff hit .391 and also
lopped the league in hits, with 27.
HANK WORKMAN. OF. Prob
ably the most valuable clutch-hitter
in the league, Troy's Workman is
a cinch on any team. The big fellow
swung his war club for a .321 aver
age and drove in 21 runs, enough
to grab top honors in that depart
ment.
BILL ARCE. 38. Stanford's own
Bill Arce got the nod over such stal
warts as Cal's Ed Sanclemente and
Santa Clara's Bob Ferari, but with
his .302 average, you couldn't keep
him out of there. A hustler all the
way, Bill turned in some of the
best stops of the season. He had 11
RBIs.
JACK BRIDEWESER. SS. From
USC comes this highly-touted short
patcher. This boy specializes in
triples but gets hits of all kinds, as
his .328 average will show. Makes
errors sometimes but can out-do
Marion occasionally.
JACK BUICK, 28. St. Mary's last
place nine sends this second-sacker
as a surprise choice, beating out Art
Mazmanian of Southern Cal. Buick
was good for a .298 average to lead
his team in hitting after Bill Van
ileuit joined the pros. Always a
•teady ball player, Buick was the
:nainstay of the Gael infield.
CHARLIE COLE. 18. Second
highest hitter in the league with an
average of .375 was the Card's initial
sacker. This boy should walk off
with Rookie-of-the-Year honors. A
good fielder, he scored 16 runs on 18
hits. Hit consistently though not for
distance, and pushed the veteran
Bob O'Dell of California to a sec
ond team position.
808 ZUBER. C. The league
champs put this hustling receiver
from USC on the first team. Unoffi
cially Bob led the circuit in hitting
with .409, but the sophomore was
out with a bad leg and didn't get
enough "at bats" to qualify.
WALLY HOOD. P. Here's the boy
who pitched the Trojans to the pen
ant. Won seven games while drop
ping only two, good enough for a
778 hurling percentage. Wally was
no slouch at the plate either, hitting

.270 and ranking second as a hit
ting chueker. Also second in strike
outs with 61. Watch the scouts go
after Wally.
NINO BARNISE, P. Right behind
Wally Ilood came the Golden Bears'
ace, who did lead the loop in strike
outs with 78. Nino's hook is almost
as sharp as his nose, and it keeps
them guessing. Won eight and lost
three, while taking part in every
game played. Helped pitch Cal to
the world championship last year.
HARV TOSO. P. Every team
needs a lefty, and here he is. From
Santa Clara, Toso is going to be one
of the best hurlers to come along
in these parts in a long time. Won
only four while losing three, but is
twice that good. Beat the Trojans,
and that's proof enough.
Naturally, in such a selection a
loa of good players get left out: so
here are a number of others worthy
of honorable mention.
OUTFIELDERS: Bob Nava (S),
Lyle Palmer (C), John Fiscalini (C),
Gail Henley (USC). Tom Kelly (SC).

PITCHERS: Doug Smith (SC),
Tom Kipp (USC), Dave Dahle (S).
Caroll Canfield (SM), George Stan

Jack Rial (SM). and Dave Stott (S).

No season in any sport can be
called complete until those grand
stand guessers, the sportswriters, get
around to picking a mythical all-star
team. The Daily writers being no
exception, and wishing to get the
jump on the rest of the world, come
up with this aggregation of CIBA
baseball stars.
BILL PRENTICE. OF. This fast
stepping outer-gardener from Santa
Clara was a unanimous choice for
starting berth, mainly because of
his great hustle and .328 batting
average.
CLIFF McCLAIN. OF. California's
batting champion also was a unani
mous choice. Cliff hit .391 and also
lopped the league in hits, with 27.
HANK WORKMAN. OF. Prob
ably the most valuable clutch-hitter
in the league, Troy's Workman is
a cinch on any team. The big fellow
swung his war club for a .321 aver
age and drove in 21 runs, enough
to grab top honors in that depart
ment.
BILL ARCE. 38. Stanford's own
Bill Arce got the nod over such stal
warts as Cal's Ed Sanclemente and
Santa Clara's Bob Ferari, but with
his .302 average, you couldn't keep
him out of there. A hustler all the
way, Bill turned in some of the
best stops of the season. He had 11
RBIs.
JACK BRIDEWESER. SS. From
USC comes this highly-touted short
patcher. This boy specializes in
triples but gets hits of all kinds, as
his .328 average will show. Makes
errors sometimes but can out-do
Marion occasionally.
JACK BUICK, 28. St. Mary's last
place nine sends this second-sacker
as a surprise choice, beating out Art
Mazmanian of Southern Cal. Buick
was good for a .298 average to lead
his team in hitting after Bill Van
ileuit joined the pros. Always a
•teady ball player, Buick was the
:nainstay of the Gael infield.
CHARLIE COLE. 18. Second
highest hitter in the league with an
average of .375 was the Card's initial
sacker. This boy should walk off
with Rookie-of-the-Year honors. A
good fielder, he scored 16 runs on 18
hits. Hit consistently though not for
distance, and pushed the veteran
Bob O'Dell of California to a sec
ond team position.
808 ZUBER. C. The league
champs put this hustling receiver
from USC on the first team. Unoffi
cially Bob led the circuit in hitting
with .409, but the sophomore was
out with a bad leg and didn't get
enough "at bats" to qualify.
WALLY HOOD. P. Here's the boy
who pitched the Trojans to the pen
ant. Won seven games while drop
ping only two, good enough for a
778 hurling percentage. Wally was
no slouch at the plate either, hitting

.270 and ranking second as a hit
ting chueker. Also second in strike
outs with 61. Watch the scouts go
after Wally.
NINO BARNISE, P. Right behind
Wally Ilood came the Golden Bears'
ace, who did lead the loop in strike
outs with 78. Nino's hook is almost
as sharp as his nose, and it keeps
them guessing. Won eight and lost
three, while taking part in every
game played. Helped pitch Cal to
the world championship last year.
HARV TOSO. P. Every team
needs a lefty, and here he is. From
Santa Clara, Toso is going to be one
of the best hurlers to come along
in these parts in a long time. Won
only four while losing three, but is
twice that good. Beat the Trojans,
and that's proof enough.
Naturally, in such a selection a
loa of good players get left out: so
here are a number of others worthy
of honorable mention.
OUTFIELDERS: Bob Nava (S),
Lyle Palmer (C), John Fiscalini (C),
Gail Henley (USC). Tom Kelly (SC).

"CHUCK* COLE,
Stanford's hard
hitting lirst base
man, was chosen
on The Daily's
All -CI HA team,
along with third
I) asem a 11 Bill
A ice. lie placed
second in league
standings with a
:»75 hatting av
erage, and hit in
te 11 consecutive
CIBA games thi*
season. Chn ck
will be counted
on heavily by
Cita eh II air y
Welters on next
y ear's India n
baseball club.
No season in any sport can be
called complete until those grand
stand guessers, the sportswriters, get
around to picking a mythical all-star
team. The Daily writers being no
exception, and wishing to get the
jump on the rest of the world, come
up with this aggregation of CIBA
baseball stars.
BILL PRENTICE. OF. This fast
stepping outer-gardener from Santa
Clara was a unanimous choice for
starting berth, mainly because of
his great hustle and .328 batting
average.
CLIFF McCLAIN. OF. California's
batting champion also was a unani
mous choice. Cliff hit .391 and also
lopped the league in hits, with 27.
HANK WORKMAN. OF. Prob
ably the most valuable clutch-hitter
in the league, Troy's Workman is
a cinch on any team. The big fellow
swung his war club for a .321 aver
age and drove in 21 runs, enough
to grab top honors in that depart
ment.
BILL ARCE. 38. Stanford's own
Bill Arce got the nod over such stal
warts as Cal's Ed Sanclemente and
Santa Clara's Bob Ferari, but with
his .302 average, you couldn't keep
him out of there. A hustler all the
way, Bill turned in some of the
best stops of the season. He had 11
RBIs.
JACK BRIDEWESER. SS. From
USC comes this highly-touted short
patcher. This boy specializes in
triples but gets hits of all kinds, as
his .328 average will show. Makes
errors sometimes but can out-do
Marion occasionally.
JACK BUICK, 28. St. Mary's last
place nine sends this second-sacker
as a surprise choice, beating out Art
Mazmanian of Southern Cal. Buick
was good for a .298 average to lead
his team in hitting after Bill Van
ileuit joined the pros. Always a
•teady ball player, Buick was the
:nainstay of the Gael infield.
CHARLIE COLE. 18. Second
highest hitter in the league with an
average of .375 was the Card's initial
sacker. This boy should walk off
with Rookie-of-the-Year honors. A
good fielder, he scored 16 runs on 18
hits. Hit consistently though not for
distance, and pushed the veteran
Bob O'Dell of California to a sec
ond team position.
808 ZUBER. C. The league
champs put this hustling receiver
from USC on the first team. Unoffi
cially Bob led the circuit in hitting
with .409, but the sophomore was
out with a bad leg and didn't get
enough "at bats" to qualify.
WALLY HOOD. P. Here's the boy
who pitched the Trojans to the pen
ant. Won seven games while drop
ping only two, good enough for a
778 hurling percentage. Wally was
no slouch at the plate either, hitting

.270 and ranking second as a hit
ting chueker. Also second in strike
outs with 61. Watch the scouts go
after Wally.
NINO BARNISE, P. Right behind
Wally Ilood came the Golden Bears'
ace, who did lead the loop in strike
outs with 78. Nino's hook is almost
as sharp as his nose, and it keeps
them guessing. Won eight and lost
three, while taking part in every
game played. Helped pitch Cal to
the world championship last year.
HARV TOSO. P. Every team
needs a lefty, and here he is. From
Santa Clara, Toso is going to be one
of the best hurlers to come along
in these parts in a long time. Won
only four while losing three, but is
twice that good. Beat the Trojans,
and that's proof enough.
Naturally, in such a selection a
loa of good players get left out: so
here are a number of others worthy
of honorable mention.
OUTFIELDERS: Bob Nava (S),
Lyle Palmer (C), John Fiscalini (C),
Gail Henley (USC). Tom Kelly (SC).
John Stanich (UCLA), and "Speed"
Renna (SC).
INFIELDERS: Ar I Mazmanian
(USC). Bob Ferari (SC), Bob Nard
(SC), Ed Sanclemente (C), Harv
Christensen (SC), Buck Brownson
(S), and Bob O'Dell (C).
CATCHERS: Jim Mangan (SC),
Jim Fiscalini (C). and Bruce Mc-
Kelvey (USC).
PITCHERS: Doug Smith (SC),
Tom Kipp (USC), Dave Dahle (S).
Caroll Canfield (SM), George Stan
ich (UCLA). Bob Andrews (UCLA).
Jack Rial (SM). and Dave Stott (S).
