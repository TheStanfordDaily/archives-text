# Excom Grants $5,000 For Student Aid Fund
## 
### 
Excom late yesterday afternoon voted that $5,000 be added to
the University's fund to enable presently enrolled students to
complete their education plans jeopardized by the recent tuition
increase.
The maximum will be $100 for each eligible student per school
year.

ASSU president Tom Martzloff
said the object of the plan is to help
students who would be forced to
leave Stanford before completing
their planned programs because of
the tuition rise.
Either loans and or grants-in-aid
are now available. Students who
feel that their regular education
plans are endangered by the tuition
rise should file a regular Scholar
ship Grant-in-Aid form with Mrs.
Byler, scholarship secretary, in the
Administration Building.
Veterans whose GI eligibility is
not sufficient to cover their present
education plans should attach a sep
arate sheet to the scholarship form
explaining fully their planned pro
gram and the amount of GI eligi
bility remaining.
Deadline for filing of forms is
June 15.
