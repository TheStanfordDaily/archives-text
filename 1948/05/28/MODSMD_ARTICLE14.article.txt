LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., May 27
(LP). â€”Great Britain tonight sug-
A'Sted a world-wide embargo on
rms shipments to the Middle East
; nd asked the United Nations Se
nility Council to appeal once again
lor a truce in the Palestine war.
British UN Delegate Sir Alexan
der Cadogan formally proposed a
tour-week cessation of hostilities in
the Holy Land. During that time,
the UN s mediator in Palestine.
> ount P olke Bernadotte of Sweden,
would try to work out a permanent
settlement between Arabs and
Jews.
IF THE NEW CEASE-FIRE ap
peal fails, said the British delegate,
Britain will be willing to go along
with the Russian - American view
that the Palestine warfare should be
.eclared a "breach of the peace"
under punitive sections of the UN
charter.
This theoretically would open the
way to use of economic blockades
or UN military force against Arabs
or Jews in case either or both failed
to comply with a cease-fire "order"
-a tougher measure than a mere
"appeal."
REPRESENTATIVES of the new
state of Israel vehemently rejected
the new British proposals.
'The British government's aim,"
said a formal Israeli statement, "is
to tie Israel's hand behind its back
so that the Arabs may be free to
strike Israel down."
The Jewish spokesman said, "The

alliance between the British gov- ,
ernment and the Arab aggressors is !
now complete both in the political i
and the military sphere. It is no
where better expressed than in the
suggestion for a world-wide arms j
embargo."
CADOGAN HEATEDLY DENIED
statements from pro-Jewish quar- {
ters that Britain had the nower to j
halt the operations of King Ab
dullah's Trans-Jordan Legion if it
wanted to. The Legion is me major
Arab force in Palestine.
Cadogan bitterly attacked the
Jews at several points in his speech, j
The British delegate charged that
the Stern Gang was responsible for j
the breakdown of the cease - fire
agreement that was in force for a
short time last month in the Holy j
City of Jerusalem.
GROMYKO SAID. "The time has

come for the Security Council to
take steps to put an end to the
military activity, steps designed to
restore peace and order in Pales
tine."
British informed quarters be
lieved today that Foreign Secretary
Ei nest Bevin has been authorized
by the cabinet to recall all 21 Brit
ish officers from the Trans-Jordan
Arab Legion if and when he thinks
such a move desirable.
Samuel Silverman, a Laborite
member of Parliament, called today
for a lull-dress debate of the Pal
estine question, and William Gal
lacher, Communist, suggested that
Palestine should be made the sub
ject of a vote of confidence in
Bevin's foreign policy. Morrison,
however, reserved his decision on
both requests.


1 UK BAND OF 'I HE AKAB LEGION, national army of Trans-Jordan, plays in Amman, the nation's capi
tal. This army has been trained and equipped by the British. Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin was au
thor.zed yesterday to recall 21 British officers l'rom the Legion if such action was deemed practical.
