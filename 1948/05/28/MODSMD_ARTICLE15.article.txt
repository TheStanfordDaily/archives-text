# MacArthur Will Return?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 27 (UP).—
A Senate committee today invited
General Douglas Mac Arthur, a con
tender for the Republican Presiden
tial nomination, to come to Wash
ington before the GOP national
convention, and President Truman
gave the idea his blessing.
The Supreme Commander of the
Allied Forces in Tokyo is the only
major hero ot' World War II who
lias not returned to the United
States since the shooting stopped.
Mar AIM HI'R FOR PRESIDENT
oosters hope a triumphant return
t this time would improve his posi
-lion as a dark horse contender for
the Republican Presidential nomi
nation. They believe a wave of pub
ic acclaim would stampede the
convention in his favor.
With full knowledge of the po
litical implications involved, the
Senate Appropriations Committee
voted, 17 to 2, to extend a formal
"request" that Mac Arthur return
home and testify on money needs
in the Far East.
PRESIDENT TRUMAN told a
•icws conference a few hours later
that he welcomed the idea. He said
lie had invited Mac Arthur to come
to the United States on several oc
casions but each time the Allied
commander had said his business in
the Orient was too pressing.
