# Campus Likes Small Daily
## 
### 
Most campus and Village students
prefer the tabloid-sized Daily rath
er than the full-sized form, accord
ing to a survey of 185 men and
women made last Thursday by Sig
ma Delta Chi, professional journal
ism fraternity. Over 81 per cent
of the sampling preferred the tab
loid Duily, while only 12.7 per cent
tavored the eight-column publica
tion. Six per cent of the readers had
no opinion.
Reasons for their choice in Daily
size were varied among the stu
dents—easier to read in class, eas
ier to handle, better looking, easier
to find the stories, and more com
pact. Opponents of the tabloid Daily
said a larger paper was more pro
fessional looking and it contained
fewer pages.
One question in the survey asked
readers if they thought the small
Daily had more or less news as com
pared to the larger paper. Over 35
per cent of the students said there
was more news, while 44 per cent
believed there was just as much
news in the tabloid Daily. Only six
per cent of the readers estimated
that there was less news in the small
Daily. Actually there is the same
amount of news in both sizes of The
Daily.

Sixty-three per cent of the men
polled said they finish reading The
Daily by 9 a.m. By comparison, only
47 per cent of the women have read

the paper by that hour. Slightly
more than 75 per cent of both men
and wome nfinish reading The Daily
I by 10 a.m.
Seventy per cent of the 185 men
and wome nfinish reading The Daily
enough campus news in The Daily;
61 per cent felt that the paper car
i ried enough world and national
I news.
Twenty-one per cent of the read
ers, however, said The Daily had
| too little campus news; 18 per cent
said there was too much world and
national news, while another 18 per
cent said there was not enough of
that type of news in The Daily.
Every fourth Daily reader did not
I believe the paper carried enough
j pictures; 71 per cent, however, felt
! the picture display is satisfactory.
I For editorial page features in The
Daily, 84 per cent of the men and
| women like Campus Opinion and
Bull Session, G3 per cent like the
editorials, 44 per cent like Behind
the Headlines, 41 per cent like On
Quad, and 27 per cent like History
; 1948.
Only two per cent of the students
polled do not read Bull Session,
nine per cent skip the editorials,
• five per cent pass over Campus
I Opinion, 33 per cent do not read
I Behind the Headlines, 36 per cent
skip On Quad, and 42 per cent skip
