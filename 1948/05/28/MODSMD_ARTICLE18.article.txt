What's the primary purpose of our athletic department—to
bring glory to the name of Stanford and enhance its own repu
tation or to provide athletic instruction for as many regularly
enrolled students as possible? In other words, should the coaches
push a student—the .ordinary guy who just wants to play a little
basketball or swim three times a week—into a dark corner of
the gym while they all concentrate on a star football player, or
should there be at least a determined attempt to provide equal
opportunity and instruction for everyone who wants it?
In our minds there is no question at all. We don't think ath
letic glory earned at the price of buying experts and forgetting
the ordinary student is worth it. And so far our athletic depart
ment has not thought so either.
But apparently the Music Department does.
The Opera Workshop is a case in point. It is limited to 15
students per quarter selected through auditions by a committee
which "will not only consider the individual vocal ability of
candidates, but will also be guided by the desirability of insur
ing a balanced representation of voices for the Workshop," ac
cording to the Announcement of Courses.
In other words, the Music Department wants to get the best
singers it possibly can in order to put on good operas. That's
a fine idea—but it should not be done if it's necessary to import
outside singers. Of the 13 singers chosen for the Workshop last
November, 12 were not registered students. Why doesn't Marchie
Schwartz bring in 11 men from the Chicago Bears to put on a
good show in the stadium each Saturday?
Sure, it's great for Stanford to be able to treat the Palo Alto
townspeople to a fine musical production now and then, and
our Music Department betters its reputation by doing so. But
still, we think Stanford's primary purpose is to train its students,
not to provide professional productions.
The Daily, the University Choir, the Band, and our athletic
teams could all turn out far superior products if outsiders were
brought in on consideration of their "ability" and the "desira
bility of insuring a balanced representation."
But these are student activities. They should be manned by
regularly enrolled students.
If planned campus productions are beyond the ability of our
students, choose less difficult dramatic or musical mediums rather
than import semi-professionals to fill the necessary roles.

Tom—
lust a couple of things before Volume 113 is through.
Remember The Daily is a community enterprise and has a
two-fold duty to the Stanford family. First you've got to provide
:! with news—complete and thorough reports -of what goes on
here.
Second, you've got to be a leader. The Daily has a conscience.
Be faithful to that conscience. Do what you think is right. Don't
be silent when you see something that is not right.
Idealistic? Sure, but don't lose that idealism. It's the soul
of The Daily.

candidates, but will also be guided by the desirability of insur
ing a balanced representation of voices for the Workshop," ac
cording to the Announcement of Courses.
In other words, the Music Department wants to get the best
singers it possibly can in order to put on good operas. That's
a fine idea—but it should not be done if it's necessary to import
outside singers. Of the 13 singers chosen for the Workshop last
November, 12 were not registered students. Why doesn't Marchie
Schwartz bring in 11 men from the Chicago Bears to put on a
good show in the stadium each Saturday?
Sure, it's great for Stanford to be able to treat the Palo Alto
townspeople to a fine musical production now and then, and
our Music Department betters its reputation by doing so. But
still, we think Stanford's primary purpose is to train its students,
not to provide professional productions.
The Daily, the University Choir, the Band, and our athletic
teams could all turn out far superior products if outsiders were
brought in on consideration of their "ability" and the "desira
bility of insuring a balanced representation."
But these are student activities. They should be manned by
regularly enrolled students.
If planned campus productions are beyond the ability of our
students, choose less difficult dramatic or musical mediums rather
than import semi-professionals to fill the necessary roles.

Tom—
lust a couple of things before Volume 113 is through.
Remember The Daily is a community enterprise and has a
two-fold duty to the Stanford family. First you've got to provide
:! with news—complete and thorough reports -of what goes on
here.
Second, you've got to be a leader. The Daily has a conscience.
Be faithful to that conscience. Do what you think is right. Don't
be silent when you see something that is not right.
Idealistic? Sure, but don't lose that idealism. It's the soul
of The Daily.

What's the primary purpose of our athletic department—to
bring glory to the name of Stanford and enhance its own repu
tation or to provide athletic instruction for as many regularly
enrolled students as possible? In other words, should the coaches
push a student—the .ordinary guy who just wants to play a little
basketball or swim three times a week—into a dark corner of
the gym while they all concentrate on a star football player, or
should there be at least a determined attempt to provide equal
opportunity and instruction for everyone who wants it?
In our minds there is no question at all. We don't think ath
letic glory earned at the price of buying experts and forgetting
the ordinary student is worth it. And so far our athletic depart
ment has not thought so either.
But apparently the Music Department does.
The Opera Workshop is a case in point. It is limited to 15
students per quarter selected through auditions by a committee
which "will not only consider the individual vocal ability of
candidates, but will also be guided by the desirability of insur
ing a balanced representation of voices for the Workshop," ac
cording to the Announcement of Courses.
