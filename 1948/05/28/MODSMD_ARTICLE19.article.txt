Atom Defenses lested
DUGWAY PROVING GROUNDS. Utah (UP).—
Clouds of dust will rise over the western Utah desert
shortly as a token of things to come.
They presage larger clouds of dust that will shoot
into the sky as the Army tries to see how much
powder—or atomic bombings—it takes to destroy
an underground factory.
The Army's corps ol engineers and civilian con
tractors are the men now on "Operation Under
ground." Later this summer and fall, explosives and
demolition experts will take over with varying
charges of TNT ranging up to 320,000 pounds.
The idea of the operation, which has a high
rating on the nation's defense parade, is to build
simulated factories, foundations, and other struc
tures well underground, then try to blow them up.
The structures —mostly oi' heavily reinforced
concrete with walls of differing thickness, are being
put in place on the salt flats, deserts, and limestone
cliffs around this remote proving grounds 85 miles
southwest of Salt Lake City.
Others are being built in sandstone bluffs near
Castle Dale in central Utah and in the Granite Moun
tains south of Grand Junction, Colo.
Those at the "dry clay" site south of Dugway
"are nearing completion. The clay is so dry that it
billows 50 feet in the air as construction equipment
bites into it. Workers and observers must, or should,
wear safety glasses and respirators.
The actual test firings, with small charges of TNT,
will begin soon after June 1. The charges will be
come increasingly stronger against new targets until
at least three, perhaps five, "full-scale" loads of 160
tons of TNT in the form of mines is placed deep
in special holes near the targets.
The first of the "big boys" will go off about
Sept. I; the last about the time snow flies over the
western slope of the Rocky Mountains.
When all the shooting is done, a corps of experts
—military and civilian-—will look over the data and
issue secret instructions to designet* on how thick
walls and foundations will have to be built to
withstand the impact of high explosives.
The fact that both targets and explosives are
being placed underground is not a coincidence.
Army authorities admit that the idea in the back
of their minds in ordering the operation is to see
what would happen should a guided missile or a
bomb, probably containing an atomic warhead, land
near a factory and burrow far into the soil or rock
before exploding.
They know the difference between the explosive
force of TNT arid atomic bombs. So from the TNT
exploded targets, they can calculate the rest.
The project is being directed now by H. O. Plath,
in charge of the Salt Lake City field office of the
Corps of Engineers. He reports to Col. Joseph F.
Gorlinski, district Army engineer at Sacramento.
Actual placement of the targets is being done by
Morrison-Knudsen Co., Boise, Ida., civilian super
contractors. Instrumentation is being laid out by
Engineering Research Associates, a pool of some of
the nation's best military and civilian engineering
brains.

walls and foundations will have to be built to
withstand the impact of high explosives.
The fact that both targets and explosives are
being placed underground is not a coincidence.
Army authorities admit that the idea in the back
of their minds in ordering the operation is to see
what would happen should a guided missile or a
bomb, probably containing an atomic warhead, land
near a factory and burrow far into the soil or rock
before exploding.
They know the difference between the explosive
force of TNT arid atomic bombs. So from the TNT
exploded targets, they can calculate the rest.
The project is being directed now by H. O. Plath,
in charge of the Salt Lake City field office of the
Corps of Engineers. He reports to Col. Joseph F.
Gorlinski, district Army engineer at Sacramento.
Actual placement of the targets is being done by
Morrison-Knudsen Co., Boise, Ida., civilian super
contractors. Instrumentation is being laid out by
Engineering Research Associates, a pool of some of
the nation's best military and civilian engineering
brains.

DUGWAY PROVING GROUNDS. Utah (UP).—
Clouds of dust will rise over the western Utah desert
shortly as a token of things to come.
They presage larger clouds of dust that will shoot
into the sky as the Army tries to see how much
powder—or atomic bombings—it takes to destroy
an underground factory.
The Army's corps ol engineers and civilian con
tractors are the men now on "Operation Under
ground." Later this summer and fall, explosives and
demolition experts will take over with varying
charges of TNT ranging up to 320,000 pounds.
The idea of the operation, which has a high
rating on the nation's defense parade, is to build
simulated factories, foundations, and other struc
tures well underground, then try to blow them up.
The structures —mostly oi' heavily reinforced
concrete with walls of differing thickness, are being
put in place on the salt flats, deserts, and limestone
cliffs around this remote proving grounds 85 miles
southwest of Salt Lake City.
Others are being built in sandstone bluffs near
Castle Dale in central Utah and in the Granite Moun
tains south of Grand Junction, Colo.
Those at the "dry clay" site south of Dugway
"are nearing completion. The clay is so dry that it
billows 50 feet in the air as construction equipment
bites into it. Workers and observers must, or should,
wear safety glasses and respirators.
The actual test firings, with small charges of TNT,
will begin soon after June 1. The charges will be
come increasingly stronger against new targets until
at least three, perhaps five, "full-scale" loads of 160
tons of TNT in the form of mines is placed deep
in special holes near the targets.
The first of the "big boys" will go off about
Sept. I; the last about the time snow flies over the
western slope of the Rocky Mountains.
When all the shooting is done, a corps of experts
—military and civilian-—will look over the data and
issue secret instructions to designet* on how thick
walls and foundations will have to be built to
withstand the impact of high explosives.
