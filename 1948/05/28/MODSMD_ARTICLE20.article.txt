LONDON (UP). â€”Experts of the Western Union
powers are studying the air defenses of western
Europe, it was revealed here coincident with the
disclosure that Britain cannot at present provide
enough planes of the transport type.
British experts estimated that Britain had less
than 1100 transport aircraft available for military
emergencies and could not raise beyond 500 even
by taking over the obsolescent fleets of the charter
companies.
'I he Western Union powers naturally are lean
ing heavily in their plans on Britain's crack RAF.
and British experts are urging the government to
take up decision- on new types of planes "with all
possible speed."
It was pointed out that against Britain's 300 planes
the United States keeps a total of 1,000 available and
would seek to expand it to 5,000 in event of war.
That expansion, it was stressed, might make the
United States unable to supply Britain as in the
last war.
Government appropriations for the British air
force in the current year have been reduced to a
little under $600,000,000, against $850,000,000 last year.
The number of personnel in the air services will be
reduced this year to 22(5.000 against 274,000 hitherto.
According to oilicial statements, all lighter com

mand interceptor squadrons have been re-equip
ped with the latest jet types, but the re-equipping
of the bomber force with jet bombers has been
deferred until the new jet engines have been fully
proved. The re-equipping of the bomber squadron.,
with Lincolns is to be completed this year.
The Times aeronautical correspondent blamed ex
isting shortcomings and difficulties on the indecision
of government authorities.
In the field of civil aviation, he predicted that
until they get completely satisfactory new types of
aircraft, none of the three state-owned air line oper
ating corporations will make any profit or even pay
its way. The three companies are expected to have
a deficit for the year which ended in March amount
ing to some $40,000,000.
