Seething with Holy Land strife is the District
of Ga!ilee-and-Acre.
Three Arab states —Lebanon on the north. Syria
and Trans-Jordan on fhe east —border this northern
most of the six administrative units into which Pales
tine was divided through the years of the now-ended
British mandate.
The Arabs watched this region, rich in Bible
history, gain rapidly in Jewish population from 1935
on. Immigrants from Europe set up scores of collec
tive farm villages along the upper Jordan Valley and
around the Plain of Esdraclon, notes the National
Geographic Society.
Galilce-and-Acre corresponds to Rhode Island in
size. It constitutes one-eighth of Palestine, which
matches Maryland in area. The distdict includes
Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilee) and Lake Hule
(Semechonitis) on the east. It thrusts a seven-mile
wide panhandle a dozen miles northward between
Lebanon and Syria to include the headwaters of the
Jordan and Dan, northern limit of the Promised
Land.
