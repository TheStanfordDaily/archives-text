Greatest Depression of History?

Every time prices increase, wages decrease, be
cause the wages will not buy as much as they die'
before. Thus the workers are being paid in mone\
which shrinks in value every pay day. They are
getting less each week as prices continue to rise.
The solution that appears most obvious is to in
crease wages and thereby close

the gap between wages an
prices. But it does not work that
way. Every wage increase brings
a further price increase which is
proportionately greater than the
wage increase. Thus each wage
increase is actually a decrease
because prices have gone so
much higher that the increased
wages, instead of buying more,
actually buy less.
That is the grim situation ir
which the average American

finds himself in this period of unrestricted free en
terprise. Thus is the paradise pictured by the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers when they^de
manded the repeal of OPA.
It may be a paradise for the NAM, for the Na
tional Association of Real Estate Boards, and foi
other business combinations, but it is a purgatorj
for the desperate workers trying to stretch a dwin
dling income to provide food, clothing, and housing
The only possible relief for the ordinary family
lies in stabilization or reduction of prices. The gap
between wages and prices must be closed. If prices
are stabilized where they are now, wages can bt
increased to the point where the purchasing power
of the dollar is restored. If prices are reduced suffi
ciently, the pui'chasing power of the dollar will be
restored without drastic wage increases.
This can be accomplished in two ways—by busi
ness or by Congress. If business wants to remain fret
of federal controls, it can do so by being satisfied with
a generous profit and x-educing its prices accordingly
If business insists on its right to exploit the public
then Congress must act by restoring price controls.
We cannot continue to drift along as we are with
out inviting disaster. Prices and profits have reached
a point undreamed of even in the wild days preceding
the Hoover depression.
The Republican party controls Congress now. as
it did then. Will it profit by its past mistakes? Or
will it be known as the party that killed free enter
prise and plunged America into the greatest de
pression of history?
