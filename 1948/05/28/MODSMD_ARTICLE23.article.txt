## Bull Session 
### 
In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts ol 'ove. and the Board of Trustees thoughts
turn to money. We are referring, of course, to the
recent decision of the University lathers to raise the
tuition a hundred stones. This increase now sets the
yearly figure at $GOO and a pound ot flesh.
Of course we realize that the increase was caused
by "the continued upward spiral of the cost of liv
ing." The part of that iast sentence in quotations is
au old economic axiom meaning that it the regis
trar's luck at Bay Meadows hadn't changed, we could
all come back next quarter for nothing.
This tuition raise is almost discouraging enough
to nuike me consider going to Cal. (I said "almost. )
As a matter of fact, it would be very convenient for
me to attend the old ivy-eovored Berkeley Grand
Central Station. My home is in Oakland, but it I
transferred to Cal. I could attend class practically
in my living room. The classes are so big out there

that if you're late to lecture and get put in a hack
seat you're sitting in Oakland.
But I could never bring myself to leave the ol<
Farm; especially as long as they continue to oflVt
lhat outstanding course in Asiatic behavior com
monly known as the Fiji Island Dance. As one oi
the Fijis so aptly put it: "How could anyone pass u;
this chance to pass out!"
Man, what a party that Was! I've been trying al
week to get a column written about it, but this i
thq first day I've gained back enough strength to lift
a pencil.
But I do wish these fraternities would stop ad
vertising their dances with signs that say: "BYOL
My girl didn't know what the "L" meant, but slv.
brought along a large bottle anyway.
Did you ever have a Manhattan mixed with
tefine after-shave lotion? I was the only guy at the
dance whose liver had lhat smooth, presentable look.
