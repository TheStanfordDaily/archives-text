Mr. Tom Martzloff, President
Associated Students of Stanford University
Dear Mr. Martzloff:
As president of the Stanford Convalescent Home and for its Board of
Directors as well, I should like you to convey to the students of Stanford
University our appreciation and real gratitude for their unselfish devotion
in working as they have for the benefit of the Home. Through the Sopho
more Carnival, the Strawberry Brunch at the Union, the Tag Day drive,
and the personal solicitation for additional funds in Palo Alto, the endow
ment of the Home has been added to most substantially.
These activities have done more for the Home than just to add to the
financial support that it needs to carry on its work lor the undernourished
and underprivileged children who are under its care. It has acquainted
hundreds of people, who otherwise might not have known of it, with the
type and character of the service furnished by this deserving charity
which we are informed is a model of its kind in its efficiency and the
position which it occupies in the community.
Yours gratefully,
IRA S. LILLICK,
