# Call-Cards Get The New Look
## 
### RICHARD WEBB 
The circulation division of the
Main Library has the New Look.
The man responsible for the face
lifting is F. J. Priddle, congenial and
capable chief of the department.
By far the most important change
that has been made is the revision
of the call-card system. This inno
vation has proved helpful to every
student who checks books from the
Main Libe. The tew
system is to provide i v Sii
plete report to the student*r n
ing the location of a certain book if
the book is not in the library when
called for.
THE BACK of new call card
is now checked with the date due,
where the book is (Western Civ
libe, Music libe, etc., who has the
book, and other pertinent data.) The
student may then keep the card and
call for the "book when it is due
or get it in the proper library.
Mr. Priddle has also initiated a
pick-up and delivery service which
operates six days a week and ofieis
service to every professor, depart
ment, and administration office in
the University.
The service operates downtown
and recently had occasion to pick
up a book at the Atherton Fire De
partment. The new pick-up and de
livery system may be contacted by
calling Mr. Priddle's office on ex
tension 548.
INTER-LIBRARY LOANS figure
important'y in the new set-up. The
loan system will contact any other
library in the world to obtain a book
for a faculty member or a graduate
student. The grad or faculty mem
ber must pay only the postage for
the shipping of the book.
Under Mr. Priddle's guidance the
division has taken over the admin
istration of the Chemistry library,
the West Memorial library in the
political science department, and the
Music library at the Knoll.
Thse libraries were previously
administered by each particular
department, but, because of their
growing collections, they have been
incorporated into the Main Libe
system. The circulation division
maintains a special reserve book
room in the Village.
How effective have these changes
proved? Ask anyone who has had
occasion to use the new call-card
system, the messenger service, or
the inter-library exchange. He can
tell you that the streamlining that
has taken place has proved its merit
by its efficiency and ease of opera
tion.

important'y in the new set-up. The
loan system will contact any other
library in the world to obtain a book
for a faculty member or a graduate
student. The grad or faculty mem
ber must pay only the postage for
the shipping of the book.
Under Mr. Priddle's guidance the
division has taken over the admin
istration of the Chemistry library,
the West Memorial library in the
political science department, and the
Music library at the Knoll.
Thse libraries were previously
administered by each particular
department, but, because of their
growing collections, they have been
incorporated into the Main Libe
system. The circulation division
maintains a special reserve book
room in the Village.
How effective have these changes
proved? Ask anyone who has had
occasion to use the new call-card
system, the messenger service, or
the inter-library exchange. He can
tell you that the streamlining that
has taken place has proved its merit
by its efficiency and ease of opera
tion.
The circulation division of the
Main Library has the New Look.
The man responsible for the face
lifting is F. J. Priddle, congenial and
capable chief of the department.
By far the most important change
that has been made is the revision
of the call-card system. This inno
vation has proved helpful to every
student who checks books from the
Main Libe. The tew
system is to provide i v Sii
plete report to the student*r n
ing the location of a certain book if
the book is not in the library when
called for.
THE BACK of new call card
is now checked with the date due,
where the book is (Western Civ
libe, Music libe, etc., who has the
book, and other pertinent data.) The
student may then keep the card and
call for the "book when it is due
or get it in the proper library.
Mr. Priddle has also initiated a
pick-up and delivery service which
operates six days a week and ofieis
service to every professor, depart
ment, and administration office in
the University.
The service operates downtown
and recently had occasion to pick
up a book at the Atherton Fire De
partment. The new pick-up and de
livery system may be contacted by
calling Mr. Priddle's office on ex
tension 548.
