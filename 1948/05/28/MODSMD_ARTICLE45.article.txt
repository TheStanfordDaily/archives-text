# 96% Believe the Honor Code Works
## 
### 
Ninety-six per cent of the student
body believes the Honor Code is
working successfully, yet 31 per cent
have noticed violations during the
last two quarters. These figures
represent part of the results of a
survey prepared by the Honor Code
Standing Committee.
The survey revealed that only
18 per cent of the students would
turn in a violation and 72.5 per
cent would do "nothing unless ser
ious."
Cheating short quizzes is as ser
ious as cheating in midquarters or
finals, according to 87 per cent of
the students, yet 84 per cent feel
that the seriousness of punishment
should vary according to the offense.

Sixty-lour per cent of the student
body feels that violators' names
should not be published. Punitive
measures surveyed were: flunking;
33 per cent; suspension, -10 per cent;
and expulsion, 27 per cent.
"The results of our survey and
the comments which we have re
ceived will aid the Honor Code
Standing Committee in helping keep
honest students honest," stated Haw
ley Smith, committee chairman.
Smith said that his committee
will provide greater and more uni
form publicity about the Honor Code
this fall, so that incoming students
will be better oriented to the spirit
of the Code. The committee will
seek clearer outlining by professors

of what does and does not constitute
cheating in each course.
Piolcssors will be asked to remind
students of the Honor Code before
each examination, and stay nearby so
they will be available for questions.
The committee wil also suggest sep
arate grading curves for graduates
and undergraduates enrolled in the
same course.
The committee will ask that dif
ferent quizzes be given to sections
meeting at various times to elim
inate the temptation to find out what
questions are being, asked before
taking the quiz.
