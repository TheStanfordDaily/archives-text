# Golfers Meet Alums On Stanford Course
## 
### BY MARSHALL NUNN 
I his is "old-home week" for the Stanford golf team and mem
bers of past years' teams. Tomorrow, for the second time this
season, the varsity and alumni squads will tee off in a 36-hole
match on the Farm links.
And for the second time the varsity men expect to take the

match without exerting too much
energy. The singles matches will get
off at 9 a.m., the doubles at 1:30 in
the afternoon.
Stars ot other years who will com
pete for the alumni are Charley
Seaver, Dr. Bob Thompson, Bill
Boyd, Bob Cardinal, Don Edwards,
Robert Roos, Don Haslett, Pete
Haas, Tom Dryer, Pete Jones, John
Kohler, Dick Wright, and Horace
Guittard.
COACH EDDIE TWIGGS will
start these men:
Tom Lambie, Bob Crozier, Bud
Moe, Ernie Kellberg, Jack Shuler,
Bill Lowe, Bili Savage, and Pete
Brown.
An effort was made to get the in
comparable Lawson Little to take
part in tomorrow's contest, but he
had to be in the East.
Alumni Bob Thompson, Dick
Wright, Pete Jones, Don Edwards,
and John Kohler were on the squad
which lost to the varsity in their
previous meeting on April 10, by
the score of 16-11.

ROB CARDINAL played on last
years varsity which took third-place
honors in the NCAA tourney in Ann
Arbor, Michigan. Cardinal recently
successfully defended his title at
the California Country Club in San
Francisco.
Both olds grads and this year's
varsity will gather at Ramor Oaks
after the match for a dinner.
This year's dinner will be given
in honor of Stanford's Grand Old
Man ol Golf. Eddie Twiggs, who is
retiring as head coach.
Since he came here in 1932. Twiggs
has compiled one of the most en
viable coaching records in the na

tion. His teams won the NCAA team
title in '38, '39, '41, '42, and '46;
placed second in '36, third the year
before, and third last year.
TWIGGS-COACIIED teams have
taken the coveted PCC team title
championship nine times. The Stan
lord team of this season indicated
that it will be a strong contender
in this year's nationals when it
copped the PCC title in Berkeley
last week.
Perhaps the most famous team
that Twiggs has turned out was
the '41 one. This team won the
NCAA team title and in doing so cut
21 strokes off the record for 36
holes, four men turning in the re
markable total of 580.
It is indeed a fitting tribute to
Coach Eddie Twiggs that the 1948
national are to be played on the
Farm links. This marks the first
time that the tourney has been
played in the Far West.

time that the tourney has been
played in the Far West.
I his is "old-home week" for the Stanford golf team and mem
bers of past years' teams. Tomorrow, for the second time this
season, the varsity and alumni squads will tee off in a 36-hole
match on the Farm links.
And for the second time the varsity men expect to take the

match without exerting too much
energy. The singles matches will get
off at 9 a.m., the doubles at 1:30 in
the afternoon.
Stars ot other years who will com
pete for the alumni are Charley
Seaver, Dr. Bob Thompson, Bill
Boyd, Bob Cardinal, Don Edwards,
Robert Roos, Don Haslett, Pete
Haas, Tom Dryer, Pete Jones, John
Kohler, Dick Wright, and Horace
Guittard.
COACH EDDIE TWIGGS will
start these men:
Tom Lambie, Bob Crozier, Bud
Moe, Ernie Kellberg, Jack Shuler,
Bill Lowe, Bili Savage, and Pete
Brown.
An effort was made to get the in
comparable Lawson Little to take
part in tomorrow's contest, but he
had to be in the East.
Alumni Bob Thompson, Dick
Wright, Pete Jones, Don Edwards,
and John Kohler were on the squad
which lost to the varsity in their
previous meeting on April 10, by
the score of 16-11.

ROB CARDINAL played on last
years varsity which took third-place
honors in the NCAA tourney in Ann
Arbor, Michigan. Cardinal recently
successfully defended his title at
the California Country Club in San
Francisco.
Both olds grads and this year's
varsity will gather at Ramor Oaks
after the match for a dinner.
This year's dinner will be given
in honor of Stanford's Grand Old
Man ol Golf. Eddie Twiggs, who is
retiring as head coach.
Since he came here in 1932. Twiggs
has compiled one of the most en
viable coaching records in the na

tion. His teams won the NCAA team
title in '38, '39, '41, '42, and '46;
placed second in '36, third the year
before, and third last year.
TWIGGS-COACIIED teams have
taken the coveted PCC team title
championship nine times. The Stan
lord team of this season indicated
that it will be a strong contender
in this year's nationals when it
copped the PCC title in Berkeley
last week.
Perhaps the most famous team
that Twiggs has turned out was
the '41 one. This team won the
NCAA team title and in doing so cut
21 strokes off the record for 36
holes, four men turning in the re
markable total of 580.
It is indeed a fitting tribute to
Coach Eddie Twiggs that the 1948
national are to be played on the
Farm links. This marks the first
time that the tourney has been
played in the Far West.
