# Netters Face Bears
## 
### BY FRED HANNUM 
The final match of the season for
Stanford's varsity tennis squad will
be battled out with Cal at Berkeley
tomorrow at 2 p.m. The frosh will
play the Cal freshmen at 10 a.m.
Stanford defeated the Bears in the
last match, 8 to 1. The Bear team
is now in last place in the Pacific
Coast Conference standings, having
lost every conference meet. Stanford
is one rung higher on the league
ladder, by grace of the single vic
tory over Cal.
Kirke Mechem again will lead the
tennis men at the No. 1 slot. Kirke
defeated Bob Lewis in a challenge
match Thursday. Mechem is a soph
omore and will have plenty of op
portunity in the next few years to
improve his play.
OTHER sophomores on the squad
are Errol Lycette and Lucien Bar
bour. Barbour has made an amaz
ing improvement in his tennis and
needs only the polish to become a
top-notch contender. If he maintains
his commendable form Saturday he
will have no difficulty winning his
match.
The brothers, Bob and Fred Lewis,
along with Bob Forbes, are the jun
iors on the squad and will have
only one more year of college compe
tition. The Lewis boys form the No.
1 doubles team. Handicapped at the
start of the tennis season because
Bob's time was spent on the varsity
basketball team instead of at tennis

practice, this team has developed
into a smooth combination in late
weeks.
808 FORBES has been up and
down the tennis ladder this season.
His play has at times been solid, but
his intermittent slips have kept him
in the No. 5 spot.
Dave Basham, Stanford's doubles
specialist, is the only graduating sen
ior. Last week he and Forbes saved
Stanford from being blanked by
USC. and the week before the No.
3 doubles team settled the 4 to 4 tie
against COP and gave Stanford the
5 to 4 win.


KIRKE MECHEM will again play
the No. 1 position for Stanford in
the final match Saturday against
California. Mechem defeated Bob
Lewis in a challenge match yes
terday.
