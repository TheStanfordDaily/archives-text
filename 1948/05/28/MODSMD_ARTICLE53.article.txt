## Weaving of nylon yarn required the development of special sizing material 
### 
Problem solved by Du Pont men
with many types of training
Each new product that is created in the
laboratory seems to bring witli it a
new set of problems to challenge the
ingenuity of the scientist. An outstand
ing instance of this i?s nylon. To make
practicable the weaving of nylon into
textiles, it was necessary to develop
an entirely new slasher sizing material
—a coating to make the filaments ad
here to one another, protect the yarn
from abrasion and keep it. clean. Si/.es
used on other fibers proved unsatisfac
tory on nylon, because of iis unique
chemical composition.
I* ive candidates were exhaustively
tested by Du Pont men. 1 lest by far
proved to be polymet hacrylic acid
(PMA), [CH.= C(CII.,)COOH] x , possi
bly because its acidic nature is favorable
to hydrogen bonding with the polyu
niide structure of nylon.
Many technical problems involved
(1) After weaving, sizing has to be re
moved by water. PMA dissolves in
water readily up to 10', at room tem
peratures. but precipitates between 70-
80 O. A way had to be found to prevent
precipitation at the normal scouring
temperature of 100 s C.

I'M A sots to a brittle, glassy
material nn fibers, giving a harsh wrap.
Suitable plasricizers such as sulfonated
vegetable and mineral oils, glycols and
other polyhydric alcohols had to be
found to correct thiscondit ion and permit
stretching and flexing ol the yarn with
out film impairment.
(•"> Good dispersing agents were nec
essary so I hat the powdered PMA would
not agglomerate as it dissolved in the
sizing bath.

(4) Optimum concentrations of PMA
and tlie various plasticizers had to be
determined, and application tempera
tures worked out for the different tvpes
of fabrics (satins, twills, taffetas, etc.)
to be sized.
The basic reactions involved in mak
ing methacrylic acid monomer are
straight forward:
(CH I CO + HCN > (CH3)jC(OH)CN
(acetone) (acetone cyanohydrin)
(CH.i.CiOIUCN +
11:0, Il:SO« >. H'C= C(CH»)COOII
(methacrylic acid monomer)
Rut several technical difficulties in the
manufacture of the polymer had to be
overcome:
(1) The distillation of the monomer
hns 1o be controlled carefully to keep
it from polymerizing in the still head.
(12) The monomer must be obtained
112 reeof any color-forming impurities that
might cause permanent discoloration of
the fabric by t he final polymer solution.
(3) Polymerization of the monomer
must be carefully regulated to get re
producible results and constant molec
ular weight. This is important because
the molecular weight of the PMA de
termines the viscosity of the size.
(1) Drying the polymer presented
unusual difficult ies. A special study was
made to find an economical drying proc
ess that would give a uniform, finely
divided product adapted to rapid solu
t ion.
Credit for the development of PMA
textile sizing, is shared by Du I'ont
men with many types of training—
chemists, physicists, chemical engineers
and textile experts, as well as the tech
nical service men who worked in close
cooperation with leading textile manu
facturers during commercial trials.
