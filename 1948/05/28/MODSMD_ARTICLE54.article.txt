We received a very pleasant surprise yesterday when a letter from
Dare Stark McMullin, Research Secretary for the Hoover Library, was
dropped on the sports desk.
The surprise was that a person of such importance as Mrs. McMullin
i-j a track fan and, secondly, that she has read this column at least once.
That occasion was Tuesday's open letter to the California Relays Com
mittee concerning last Saturday's track meet at Modesto.
MRS. McMULLIN took exception to our views and wrote a very scath
ing letter telling us just what she thought about the whole thing. We
contend that the relay situation is getting out of hand. Too many small
towns are hopping on the "make money from track" bandwagon. In the
long run track will suffer.
Our feminine critic also journeyed to Modesto. She enjoyed the meet
and wants to defend the relays committee. Every person to his own
opinion.
She points out that meet marks in this year's relays equaled or topped
Penn and Drake relay marks. True.
She points out that track fans at Stanford meets also rise and stay up
for races. True.
SHl'] GOES ON to praise the spirit of the meet. High school and college
athletes meet on equal footing, with the prepmen receiving equal courtesy
and acclaim with the big boys. True again.
Mrs. McMullin makes several good observations that we must go
with. But we are afraid that she missed the point in several instances.
She makes reference to Angell Field—"frequent site of our own meets"
—and its capacity, visibility, and shallow rows. But we remind her that no
meet was held on Angell Field this year. And it people do stand up in
the Stadium, at least the height of most of the seats is great enough to
allow most of the people to see the race. This you cannot do in Modesto
Junior College stadium.
AS TO THE SPIRIT of the meet, we just cannot second the praise
given by our critic. The whole meet reeked with the small-town theme—
"Modesto has done it again! Another meet record has been broken! We
got just about the best little ol' track in all America!"
Maybe we have become somewhat of a cynic in regard to athletic
events, but we hate to travel as far as Modesto to see high school boys
and college men meet on equal footing. Five hours is too long for any
track meet, and when it is cluttered up with high school runners it begins
to ask a little too much from the fans.
We only wish we had room to print Mrs. McMullin's letter in whole.
She makes a good case for the Modesto people and even gives us a faint
suspicion that at one time or another she has lived in the village.
In one respect we are in hearty accord. Stanford's band was a fine
bunch oi ambassadors. The gang put on a good show in Modesto. They
gave organized cheers and hailed the good competitors. We have reason
to he proud of our band. As Mrs. McMullin puts it,"It was witty in chorus, :
it sang to the cops. And it played its head off, and stayed to play the last
customer out." Well put and every word a truth. We thank the band for
livening up a very tiresome evening.
CLEAN UP TIIE DESK DEPARTMENT . . .
Stanford's Skip Kent, Dell Russell, Downing McKee, and Darrell Kreitz
look to be a sure thing to break the 480-yard shuttle hurdle relay record
next year. The boys were off only seven-tenths of i< second in the Cali
fcrnia Relays (ugh). There was a veiy good reason for missing the record,
too. Three ol the hurdlers ran at 6:30. again at 7:15, and then had a four
hour wait before they attempted to break the world's mark now held by
Texas University.
Latest word has it that Morlcy Thompson will definitely not play I
basketball next year. Instead he will graduate. Bill Stephenson will be
married this summer. Bill Drehoble takes the fatal step tomorrow. Bob
Lewis will be back. With the expected help of JC transfers, a little luck,
and few injuries, Stanford could win the Southern Division basketball
crown next year. Cross your fingers.
We missed mentioning the football managers when we were covering
the spring football drills. Four men—senior manager Marshall O'Neill
and his assistants Joe DeJesus, Jack Otterson. and A 1 Berry— handled the
job of ministering to the wants of the footballers. All four will 'be on
hand when Marehie Schwartz opens the fall practices on Sept. 1.
AS IT NOW STANDS, only four trackmen will be missing next year.
One event, the pole vault, will be swept clean by graduation. Bill Larson
and Marty Anderson will be lost via the sheepskin route. Javelin thrower
C huck Coker and captain George Grimes are the other two trackmen who
will not be around come spring '49.
Stanford's new freshman basketball coach Bob Burnett is no new
comer to the Farm. Bob played two years with the "Laughing Boys" ol
the Hank Luisctti era. He played under Everett Dean in 1938 in Dean's
first year as Stanford coach. In 1940 he returned to Stanford as assistant
basketball coach. He became head coach at Utah State the next year.

We only wish we had room to print Mrs. McMullin's letter in whole.
She makes a good case for the Modesto people and even gives us a faint
suspicion that at one time or another she has lived in the village.
In one respect we are in hearty accord. Stanford's band was a fine
bunch oi ambassadors. The gang put on a good show in Modesto. They
gave organized cheers and hailed the good competitors. We have reason
to he proud of our band. As Mrs. McMullin puts it,"It was witty in chorus, :
it sang to the cops. And it played its head off, and stayed to play the last
customer out." Well put and every word a truth. We thank the band for
livening up a very tiresome evening.
CLEAN UP TIIE DESK DEPARTMENT . . .
Stanford's Skip Kent, Dell Russell, Downing McKee, and Darrell Kreitz
look to be a sure thing to break the 480-yard shuttle hurdle relay record
next year. The boys were off only seven-tenths of i< second in the Cali
fcrnia Relays (ugh). There was a veiy good reason for missing the record,
too. Three ol the hurdlers ran at 6:30. again at 7:15, and then had a four
hour wait before they attempted to break the world's mark now held by
Texas University.
Latest word has it that Morlcy Thompson will definitely not play I
basketball next year. Instead he will graduate. Bill Stephenson will be
married this summer. Bill Drehoble takes the fatal step tomorrow. Bob
Lewis will be back. With the expected help of JC transfers, a little luck,
and few injuries, Stanford could win the Southern Division basketball
crown next year. Cross your fingers.
We missed mentioning the football managers when we were covering
the spring football drills. Four men—senior manager Marshall O'Neill
and his assistants Joe DeJesus, Jack Otterson. and A 1 Berry— handled the
job of ministering to the wants of the footballers. All four will 'be on
hand when Marehie Schwartz opens the fall practices on Sept. 1.
AS IT NOW STANDS, only four trackmen will be missing next year.
One event, the pole vault, will be swept clean by graduation. Bill Larson
and Marty Anderson will be lost via the sheepskin route. Javelin thrower
C huck Coker and captain George Grimes are the other two trackmen who
will not be around come spring '49.
Stanford's new freshman basketball coach Bob Burnett is no new
comer to the Farm. Bob played two years with the "Laughing Boys" ol
the Hank Luisctti era. He played under Everett Dean in 1938 in Dean's
first year as Stanford coach. In 1940 he returned to Stanford as assistant
basketball coach. He became head coach at Utah State the next year.
We received a very pleasant surprise yesterday when a letter from
Dare Stark McMullin, Research Secretary for the Hoover Library, was
dropped on the sports desk.
The surprise was that a person of such importance as Mrs. McMullin
i-j a track fan and, secondly, that she has read this column at least once.
That occasion was Tuesday's open letter to the California Relays Com
mittee concerning last Saturday's track meet at Modesto.
MRS. McMULLIN took exception to our views and wrote a very scath
ing letter telling us just what she thought about the whole thing. We
contend that the relay situation is getting out of hand. Too many small
towns are hopping on the "make money from track" bandwagon. In the
long run track will suffer.
Our feminine critic also journeyed to Modesto. She enjoyed the meet
and wants to defend the relays committee. Every person to his own
opinion.
She points out that meet marks in this year's relays equaled or topped
Penn and Drake relay marks. True.
She points out that track fans at Stanford meets also rise and stay up
for races. True.
SHl'] GOES ON to praise the spirit of the meet. High school and college
athletes meet on equal footing, with the prepmen receiving equal courtesy
and acclaim with the big boys. True again.
Mrs. McMullin makes several good observations that we must go
with. But we are afraid that she missed the point in several instances.
She makes reference to Angell Field—"frequent site of our own meets"
—and its capacity, visibility, and shallow rows. But we remind her that no
meet was held on Angell Field this year. And it people do stand up in
the Stadium, at least the height of most of the seats is great enough to
allow most of the people to see the race. This you cannot do in Modesto
Junior College stadium.
AS TO THE SPIRIT of the meet, we just cannot second the praise
given by our critic. The whole meet reeked with the small-town theme—
"Modesto has done it again! Another meet record has been broken! We
got just about the best little ol' track in all America!"
Maybe we have become somewhat of a cynic in regard to athletic
events, but we hate to travel as far as Modesto to see high school boys
and college men meet on equal footing. Five hours is too long for any
track meet, and when it is cluttered up with high school runners it begins
to ask a little too much from the fans.

Stanford's new freshman basketball coach Bob Burnett is no new
comer to the Farm. Bob played two years with the "Laughing Boys" ol
the Hank Luisctti era. He played under Everett Dean in 1938 in Dean's
first year as Stanford coach. In 1940 he returned to Stanford as assistant
basketball coach. He became head coach at Utah State the next year.
We received a very pleasant surprise yesterday when a letter from
Dare Stark McMullin, Research Secretary for the Hoover Library, was
dropped on the sports desk.
The surprise was that a person of such importance as Mrs. McMullin
i-j a track fan and, secondly, that she has read this column at least once.
That occasion was Tuesday's open letter to the California Relays Com
mittee concerning last Saturday's track meet at Modesto.
MRS. McMULLIN took exception to our views and wrote a very scath
ing letter telling us just what she thought about the whole thing. We
contend that the relay situation is getting out of hand. Too many small
towns are hopping on the "make money from track" bandwagon. In the
long run track will suffer.
Our feminine critic also journeyed to Modesto. She enjoyed the meet
and wants to defend the relays committee. Every person to his own
opinion.
She points out that meet marks in this year's relays equaled or topped
Penn and Drake relay marks. True.
She points out that track fans at Stanford meets also rise and stay up
for races. True.
SHl'] GOES ON to praise the spirit of the meet. High school and college
athletes meet on equal footing, with the prepmen receiving equal courtesy
and acclaim with the big boys. True again.
Mrs. McMullin makes several good observations that we must go
with. But we are afraid that she missed the point in several instances.
She makes reference to Angell Field—"frequent site of our own meets"
—and its capacity, visibility, and shallow rows. But we remind her that no
meet was held on Angell Field this year. And it people do stand up in
the Stadium, at least the height of most of the seats is great enough to
allow most of the people to see the race. This you cannot do in Modesto
Junior College stadium.
AS TO THE SPIRIT of the meet, we just cannot second the praise
given by our critic. The whole meet reeked with the small-town theme—
"Modesto has done it again! Another meet record has been broken! We
got just about the best little ol' track in all America!"
Maybe we have become somewhat of a cynic in regard to athletic
events, but we hate to travel as far as Modesto to see high school boys
and college men meet on equal footing. Five hours is too long for any
track meet, and when it is cluttered up with high school runners it begins
to ask a little too much from the fans.
We only wish we had room to print Mrs. McMullin's letter in whole.
She makes a good case for the Modesto people and even gives us a faint
suspicion that at one time or another she has lived in the village.
In one respect we are in hearty accord. Stanford's band was a fine
bunch oi ambassadors. The gang put on a good show in Modesto. They
gave organized cheers and hailed the good competitors. We have reason
to he proud of our band. As Mrs. McMullin puts it,"It was witty in chorus, :
it sang to the cops. And it played its head off, and stayed to play the last
customer out." Well put and every word a truth. We thank the band for
livening up a very tiresome evening.
CLEAN UP TIIE DESK DEPARTMENT . . .
Stanford's Skip Kent, Dell Russell, Downing McKee, and Darrell Kreitz
look to be a sure thing to break the 480-yard shuttle hurdle relay record
next year. The boys were off only seven-tenths of i< second in the Cali
fcrnia Relays (ugh). There was a veiy good reason for missing the record,
too. Three ol the hurdlers ran at 6:30. again at 7:15, and then had a four
hour wait before they attempted to break the world's mark now held by
Texas University.
Latest word has it that Morlcy Thompson will definitely not play I
basketball next year. Instead he will graduate. Bill Stephenson will be
married this summer. Bill Drehoble takes the fatal step tomorrow. Bob
Lewis will be back. With the expected help of JC transfers, a little luck,
and few injuries, Stanford could win the Southern Division basketball
crown next year. Cross your fingers.
We missed mentioning the football managers when we were covering
the spring football drills. Four men—senior manager Marshall O'Neill
and his assistants Joe DeJesus, Jack Otterson. and A 1 Berry— handled the
job of ministering to the wants of the footballers. All four will 'be on
hand when Marehie Schwartz opens the fall practices on Sept. 1.
AS IT NOW STANDS, only four trackmen will be missing next year.
One event, the pole vault, will be swept clean by graduation. Bill Larson
and Marty Anderson will be lost via the sheepskin route. Javelin thrower
C huck Coker and captain George Grimes are the other two trackmen who
will not be around come spring '49.
