## 
### BY JACK BLOOD 
United States swimming hopes in
this summer's Olympic Games are
very good, according to Stanford's
I youthful swim coach, Tom Haynie.
j Haynie is a man who should know,
since he has been appointed one of
| the associate coaches of the U. S.
! team.
The American team will pin its
hopes on the performances of such
j stars as Wally Ris of lowa, in the
, freestyle sprints. Bill Smith of Ohio
| State, middle distance man, Jimmy
j McLane, Andover, in the 400-meters,
J Alan Stack, Yale, in the backstroke,
j and Joe Verdeur, La Salle, in the
! breaststroke.
A number of Stanford men are
hoping for a berth on the squad.
Captain Bob Anderson in the 100-
yard freestyle has been timed in 52
seconds, to rank among the best in
l this event. Ralph Sala is a strong
contender in the 400-meter and 1500-
! meter freestyle events. In the 1500-
! meter grind, Ralph has covered the
I distance in 20:44.
JACK WEEDEN, with a time of
1:09.9, set in the AAU 110-meter
backstroke, may earn a place on the
team. Don Hester in the 200-meter
breaststroke is another possibility.
, Two former Stanford men who are
I now competing for the Olympic Club
| in San Francisco are trying out for
I positions.
They are Fred Taioli who swims
the 200-meter freestyle in 2:18.8,

and A 1 Weeclen, backstroke star.
Both were members of last year's
Cardinal varsity.

that year.
Bud Held in the javelin appears t}
be the only Stanford candidate ft
this year's team. Bud has consist
ently thrown the spear over 200 feet
