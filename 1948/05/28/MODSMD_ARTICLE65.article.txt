# This Year—Tresidder's Death Major Stanford News
## 
### BY LORRY LOKEY 
This school year has been a news
worthy one for the Stanford Family.
The men returned to the campus
fighting the New Look; now the non
veterans are reading between the
Washington news lines how pending
draft legislation win affect their col
lege careers.
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder's death
on January 28 stunned Bay Area
and campus residents and left Stan
ford without a University president.
The Board of Trustees appointed
Alvin C. Eurich as acting president
until a special board committee
appoints Dr. Tresidder's successor.
In the year's second-ranking news
event, the student body and Ad
ministration debated the issue on
whether partisan political group
could meet on campus. January 25,
in a letter student body president
Tom Martzloff, Dean of Students
Lawrence Kimpton summed up the
University's reasons why such groups
could not meet or organize on the
Farm. Mrs. Stanford's land grant
provided that no partisan political
groups would be allowed to use Uni
versity facilities, the letter stated.
WHEN GUS CHAVALAS edged
Frank Wolff in the spring quarter
elections for next year's student body
presidency, he notched third place
for top news events of the 1947-48
year. Chavalas won the election by

a scant five votes in t;*e preferen
tial balloting.
The slow college life of the war
years became a memory during this
year. Scores of beach parties, two
ferry boat dances, Encina-Toyon ri
valry, 325 fraternity initiates, and
the Sunday movie hero, Flash Gor
don, swept into campus life. Only
two events brought back old mem
ories—the draft legislation and
poultryless, meatless, and eggless
menus last autumn quarter.
SOMETIMES students became a
little to eager to capitalize on social
life at Stanford. Pajamarino dam
ages on Nov. 5 ran up an $800 bill
against ASSU and several living
groups when repair bills from the
How, Roble, and the Pavilion were
tallied.
University registration reached
new heights last Autumn when over
8,100 students turned in their reg
books to the cashier. On January
6 the University started off the win
ter quarter with a revised registra
tion program that virtually elim
inated the two- and three-hour
waiting in lines for reg books. Dur
ing this quarter, the University an
nounced that a record enrollment of
approximately 4,000 students was
expected for the summer quarter.
Stanford is growing in other fields,
too. Ground was broken for Crothers
Hall early this year. Construction
will start soon on Stern Hall, just
across the street from the Crothers
dorm for law school students.
OTHER BUILDING plans were re
vealed this year. Several weeks ago
the University announced that plans
were being drawn up for a new stu
dent union to be named in honor of
the late Donald B. Tresidder.

College life is still expensive.
Men's room deposits rose from $10 to
$25. This week Stanford announced
a $100 hike in tuition expenses for
undergraduate students in order to
increase faculty salaries and schol
arship awards. Board and room bills
remained stable this year as the na
tional cost of living showed the first
signs of decreasing in the first five
months of 1948.
KSU celebrated its first anniver
sary on January 27; the Freedom
Train visited Palo Alto on March
17; Excom approved office and mail
ing funds for SIRO on Feb. 20, fol
lowing a stormy week of student
opinion; 4,000 students were jabbed
with flu shots in January to prevent
a flu epidemic from spreading from
Los Angeles; and veterans began
collecting $10 more in subsistence
allowance in April.
WATER MADE NEWS at the
beach and at home. Students set
their clocks and hour ahead to com
ply with the rest of the state. Cam
pus residents limited their garden
watering, and car owners watched
their vehicles gather dust. Only
heavy, late spring rains eased the
situation, but they were not abun
dant enough to fill Lake Lagunita for
swimmers and the annual junior wa
ter carnival.
A $250,000 gift from the May T.
Morrison estate established a new
profesorship in United States history.
On the lighter side of campus life,
KSU visited the University of Cali
fornia this quarter and sold the stu
dents on the wireless wire trans
mission of KSU, "The Tale of the
Golden Bear."
IF YOU WERE an average under
graduate student in 194(5 and 1947,
you had a grade point average of

2:58, the University announced on
Dec. 3.
International groups were active
during the past year. lIR sponsored
and International Conference in
Cubberley Hall on Feb. 20. The key
note speaker was John C. Ross, gen
eral deputy of the United States
delegation to the UN.
During an all-campus assembly in
the Memorial Auditorium, University
of Chicago Chancellor Robert M.
Hutchins called for "one good world"
based on justice and acceptance of
common ideals and principles.
Excom passed the National Stu
dents Association measure provision
ally on Oct. 22 pending a report on
NSA after the Western NSA con
ference held at Stanford during the
Oct. 25 weekend. NSA was formally
okayed by Excom on Oct. 29.
STANFORD SUFFERED this year

i in the sports side of college activity.
| The football eleven made a good
showing against Cal but lost every
game in their schedule. The basket
ball and baseball teams also tried,
but they, too, finished below the
leaders. We had a better track team
j this year, but it could not crack
j through other league opponents. On.
| the brighter side of the scoresheet,
I our swimming team passed through
j another undefeated year. A minor
! surprise came from the unrecog
nized, orphan crew association as
their shells paddled to victories over
UCLA, USC, and San Diego State.
! During the Feb. 6 weekend, the
; frohs released some of their pent-up
i energy in the Frosh-Soph Jamboree.
The freshmen won enough events to
snag a year's possession of the inter
' class trophy.
