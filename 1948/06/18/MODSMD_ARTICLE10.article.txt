Like (o write? Hobnob with campus big; wheels? Or merely find some
congenial people to spend tons; summer afternoons with?
If so, The Stanford Daily, the Peninsula's only daily morning news
paper (which comes out three times a week summer quarter) is the
place for you. Experience is not necessary. Not too much ambition is
required. Just a few spare hours each week is the only prerequisite.
"Don't be afraid to come in if you've had no experience." Edit Board
stated last night. "Summer Daily policy is: "Get 'cm when they're green
and train them in true Daily style'."
All old Daily members and tr you tees for positions on The Daily will
meet in the Daily shack Sunday at 1 p.m., Associate Editor Bruce Mitch
ell announced last night.
