# House Postpones Draft Law Vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 17 (UP). â€”The House voted today to post
pone drafting of men for the armed forces until Jan. 31, 1949.
Rebelling against both Republican and Democratic leaders, the
House rank and file voted 135 to 90 in favor of an amendment
by Rep. Paul W. Shafer, R., Mich., to keep the selective service

machinery on a standby basis for
the next seven months.
During that period, the armed
forces would have to seek volun
tary recruits by lowering their ad
mission standards.
Draft bill supporters said the ac
tion, if sustained on a final roll call
vote, would kill the manpower
measure entirely. The action was
tentative because the House was
sitting as a committee of the whole.
All such votes are subject to re
versal when the House comes out
of committee.
Rep. Frank B. Keefe, R., Wis.,
told members:
"We all know how we are goin
to vote on this bill. Let's quit fool
ing with these amendments an
vote."
The sharp setback to draft pro
ponents came at a time when die
hard foes of the draft already ha
launched a stalling strategy de
signed to hold up final passage ur
til the scheduled adjournment tinu
Saturday night.
Delaying tactics were sparked b
left-wing supporters of Henry A
Wallace's third party, including
Rep. Vito A. Marcantonio, ALP.
N.Y., and Sen. Glen H. Taylor of
Idaho, who planned to work to
gether to keep the House and Sen
ate from approving a compromise
bill.
But Chairman Robert A. Taft of
j the Senate Republican policy com
; mittee said the effort would fail.
"We'll come back (for furthe'
sessions after the political conven
tions) if we have to," Taft said
"We're not going to let them bloc)
it'' with filibuster tactics, he added
