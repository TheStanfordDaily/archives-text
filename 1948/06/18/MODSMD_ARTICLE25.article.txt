# DAILY EDITORIALS
## This Is Number One 
### 
Summer quarter alv/ays brings a lot of people to Stanford
for the first time. They don't always know that The Daily is their
newspaper—that it is owned and operated by the students.
For this reason we would like to tell you a little bit about
The Daily.
Like every newspaper, and perhaps more than most, The
Daily has frequently been the subject of controversy. Opinions
expiessed editorially have not always been those of the major
portion of the student body. But The Daily has seldom been
lifeless and sterile. In its editorial columns we have attempted
to stimulate thinking.
To what degree we have succeeded is not for us to say, but
that is what we will continue to try for. We would rather have
you disagree with us than not know we exist.
Summer session means a smaller Daily, published three times
a week instead of the usual five. But we will continue to give our
readers coverage of campus news, together with such other
items as we deem important.
There are generally fewer campus activities in the summer
quarter. The Daily can usually broaden its coverage to include
more national, state, and world news.
We welcome your ideas and criticisms. We will be glad to
print all the letters for which we have space in our Campus
Opinion column.
