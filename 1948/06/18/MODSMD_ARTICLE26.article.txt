# CAMPUS OPINION
## Readership Poll 
### 
(The Daily will be happy to use any non-libelous Campus Opinions
received. Letters should not he longer than 150 words and should be
addressed to the editor. Names will be withheld on request, but the
name and address of the writer must accompany the letter.—Ed.)
The Editor, Sir:
I was very pleased to find that The Daily was carrying on a readership
poll; not only to find what articles enjoy the greatest readership, but also
to find out in what way The Daily might be improved. It is certainly
gratifying to find a public servant attempting to better itself.
My only hope is that the material collected will not be disregarded, but
that it will be put into effective use as soon as possible.
Yours for bigger and better Dailies.
TOM WOOD
