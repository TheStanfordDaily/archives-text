# Scientist Finds New TB Villain
## 
### 
Three years of research by a
Stanford scientist have brought to
light a new villain in the rogues'
gallery of science.
Dr. Sidney RafTel of the Stanford
Medical School department of bac
teriology, in studying tuberculosis,
has identified a chemical substance
which is responsible for cell de
struction in diseased victims.
SOLVES MYSTERY
The substance is a wax-like ma
terial, composed of starches and
fatty acid. The discovery erased a
big question mark in the study of
tuberculosis.
For years, scientists have known
that the presence of proteins in
cells made them allergic to the de
structive effect of the tuberculosis
germ. Yet when pure proteins
were injected into experimental
animals, such allergy could not be
induced.
SPEEDS DESTRUCTION
Dr. Raffel's discovery showed
that this wax-like fat was the un
suspected catalyst in the tubercu
losis germ which speeded tip tissue
destruction. Now, doctors know
they have this newly identified cul
prit to reckon with.
