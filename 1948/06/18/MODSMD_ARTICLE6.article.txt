# Vandenberg May Clarify Running Plans
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, June 17 (UP).
â€”Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg may
issue a statement in a few days
clarifying his position as the No. 1
darkhorse prospect for the Repub
lican Presidential nomination, it
was learned today.
Vandenberg's son, Arthur Jr.,
said it is "possible" that the Michi
gan Senator will have a statement
to make when he arrives here Sun
day for next week's Republican na
tional convention.
The Senator's son gave no indica
tion of what the statement might
contain.
Meanwhile, the best guesses on
Vandenberg's pre-convention posi
tion were that:
1. He will make no move to en
courage or discourage any dele
gates to vote for 'him. But if the
nomination should come on that
basis he would accept it.
2. He believes that the foreign
policy plank in the party platform
will be more "acceptable" than he
previously had expected. There
was no explanation of whether that
meant "acceptable" as a platform
on which to run or one on which to
entrust the standard-bearing to an
other person.
