# Draft Bill May Affect 2,000 Young Farm Men
## 
### 
Peacetime selective service legislation, which needs only-
President Truman's signature to become law, will affect in some
measure the lives of an estimatd 2,000 Stanford students who
have never served in the nation's armed forces.
The compromise bill, as passed by both houses of Congress

Saturday, may be lenient to
students in some respects but still
requires registration of all men 19
through 25. Veterans who served 90
days between Pearl Harbor and V-J
Day or 12 months before or after
those dates are exempt from induc
tion, but not registration.
College students will get a defer
ment, according to the bill, if they
are satisfactorily pursuing a full
time course of instruction. The de
ferment, in all likelihood, will be
until the end of the academic year
in which they are ordered to report
for induction.
In addition to serving 21 months
on active duty, inductees will be
required to enter the reserves for
five years. They may shorten the
five-year obligation by serving for
an additional 12 months on active
duty or by enlisting in an organized
reserve (which holds weekly drills)
for three years.
MAY VOLUNTEER
Also, the bill provides for IGI.OOO
youths, not more than 18' years of
age, to be acepted as volunteers for
12 months' service within the United J
States.
The bill, which expires in two
years unless specifically extended,
also provides for other exemptions:
ordained ministers and students
studying for the ministry, sole sur
viving sons of families which lost
one or more sons during World War
11, and persons who served in forces
of an ally to the United States prior
to V-J Day.
For veterans who served more than j
90 days but not 12 months, defer- i
r.ierÂ» <c will be made if they enlist in
the organized reserves or the inactive j
reserves if no organized unit is reas
onably accessible.
DEFERMENT FOR ROTC
ROTC juniors and seniors will be
deferred until they finish college,
provided they are in the ROTC when
the bill becomes law, but they are
liable to two years of active duty
when they graduate.
The draft also may cut deep into
intercollegiate sports circles, espe
cially at Stanford, where many of
the teams are composed mainly of
youths who never have been in the
service. Stanford's track team, al
most an entirely sophomore non
veteran aggregation, may be hit the j
worst.
