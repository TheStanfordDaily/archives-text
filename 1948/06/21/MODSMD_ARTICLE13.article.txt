The competitive spirit of Head
Football Coach Marchie Schwartz
was absorbed by his fighting team
last fall. They neither asked nor
gave quarter to the highly-favored
Cal grid squad. Another instance
that demands the respect of coaches
all over the country was the recent
move by Schwartz to support Bruin
backficld star A 1 Hoisch in his effort
to be reinstated for further college
competition.
Hoisch, a former Stanfordite, has
plagued coast teams with his speed.
Last week, because of war-time
changes, the PCC ruled Hoisch had
completed his eligibility, and to every
Pacific Coast college coach this was
like flowers from home. But
Schwartz, always looking out for the
other fellow and asking for no ad
vantage, has backed Hoisch in his
fight for reinstatement.

USC's baseball team won the right
to meet Yale's Eastern champions in
college baseball's annual "World
Series" by soundly trouncing the
Baylor Bears, 16 to 3, in the Western
NCAA championship. The team
meets Yale this weekend at Kala
mazoo. After failing the western
schools in the Rose Bowl, maybe
USC can redeem itself in baseball.

It has turned out that the Pacific j
Coast colleges have just about put J
all their eggs in one basket in na
tional competition. It's been USC in
football, now in baseball and track.
The national collegiae track and j
field championship was a tough one j
for USC to lose. Highly favored, the j
Trojans ended up just 4 17 2 behind j
Minnesota. Though USC had the 1
speed, the Gophers took the meet in
the hop, step, and jump event I
coupled with the discus. These
lightly regarded events show how
important it is in team play to have
a well-rounded squad.
Stanford's Frank Held made an
excellent showing by winning the
javelin throw in a field of six top
college men. Otis Chandler took
fourth in the shot put, Gaylord
Bryan took fifth in the broad jump
and Darrell Kreitz ran the high hur

dies but failed to place. Congratula
tions to these Stanford athletes who
carried the Cardinal and White so
well.

The Pacific Coast still can assert
itself in sports circles in the big col
lege crew races in Poughkecpsie, in
the NCAA tennis tournament in Los
Angeles, and in the NCAA golf
tournament here at Stanford.
At Poughkeepsie, Washington is
favored over the Cal squad, but
Navy is considered the favorite to
win the races tomorrow. Coaches
hesitate to say waht the outcome
will be. Navy is still the cream of
the East despite a loss to Harvard.
Harvard will not enter the race, be
cause of a meet with Yale the same
day.
Washington beat Cal by three
lengths in Oakland. Cal is still con
sidered to be a stronger team, but
Washington runs more smoothly.
Smoothness and team work makes
the difference in a crew race. De
spite the fact that Navy is favored,
the two western schools have won
prestige in the East. Washington
amazes the coaches because its crew
is the lightest in the meet and is
undefeated thus far.

The University of Washington was
selected Saturday by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association as
the location for next year's East-
West championship basketball play
offs. The location has been moved
from Madison Square Garden be
cause the playoffs had never been
held on the Pacific Coast.
It might be added that the NCAA
golf tournament is being held at
Stanford this year. This meet also
has never before been held on the
coast. Western sports is making a
strong bid to equal the recognition
now afforded the East.
Incidentally, the golf tournament
here is the chance of a lifetime for
some of us to see golf at its best.
Right here at Stanford will gather
the nation's best college golfers. All
it takes to see the events is a little
time and $1.50 for a single day.
Tickets for all week can be bought
in the athletic offices for $5.50. Take
a walk out there for an afternoon.
