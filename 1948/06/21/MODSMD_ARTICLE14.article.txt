If you are wary of stomach ulcers,
you may do well to include raw
foods and fresh milk in your diet.
Tests conducted by a scientist in
the Stanford University School of
Medicine indicate that a diet rich

in "Vitamin U,. found in raw foods
and milk but deficient in heated
foods, reduces peptic ulcer occur
rence in guinea pigs.
The importance of the findings re
ported in the current issue of the
Stanford Medical Bulletin will de
pend on whether the human stomach
behaves exactly like that of guinea
pigs. But the scientist. Dr. Garnett
Cheney, believes the results of his
experiments on guinea pigs warrant
carefully controlled diet studies of
human ulcer patients.
In the first experiment, one group
of guinea pigs was fed a diet made
deficient in "Vitamin U' 1 by heating
it. Another group was given the
same diet, unheated, and supple
mented by liberal amounts of fresh
cabbage and milk, both containing
the anti-ulcer factor.
When occurrence of ulcers in the
two groups was compared, it was
found that 87.5 per cent of the group
getting the deficient diet had ulcer
lesions, all but two of them fatally.
None of the guinea pigs on the pro
tective diet had ulcers.
