# Cardinals Will Help PCC Against Big 9 Tomorrow
## 
### 
Eight Stanford Indian tracksters
nre expected to arrive at Evanston
tomorrow to join the Pacific Coat;t
Conference team which will meet
the stars of the Big Nine in their
annual track and field meet there
Tuesday at twilight.
Four of those Indians — Otis
Chandler, Bill Larson, Bud Held
and Gay Bryan—will be eyeing the
Olympic tryouts, also in Evanston,
on July 9th and 10th by virtue of
their placing in the NCAA champ
ionships in Minneapolis Saturday.
Held is the favorite in the javelin
throw after his winning perform
ance of 209 feet. 8 inches, against
the nation's top spear tossers in
Minneapolis. The Stanford sopho
more's only opposition is expected
from California's Fred Friedenbach
who took a second with 204 feet.
Stanford entrants for the Big 9-
PCC Meet, besides Held, are Lar
son, pole vault; Chandler, shotput;
Bryan, broad jump; Darrel Kreitz,
and Skip Kent and Downing Mc-
Kee, high hurdles; Kreitz, low
hurdles, and Larry HofT, 440.
Held and the other three Stan
ford qualifiers in the NCAA meet
all are capable of better perform
ances than they turned in Satur
day. Chandler, who took fourth in
the shot with a heave of 52 feet,
inch, has done close to 54 feel.
Larson, who tied for fourth at 13
feet. 8 inches, in the pole vault,
scaled 14 feet once this year and
13 feet 10 inches on still another
occasion.
And the triple threated Bryan, the
lad who took three firsts against
USC's mighty Trojans in April, on
ly entered the broad jump, and
struggled for a fifth at 23 feet, 10
inches. He has done over 24 feet at
least six times this year.
Other Cards, who did not qualify
for the Olympic tests Saturday will
get another chance at the National
AAU in Milwaukee. A good bet in
that meet is hurdler Darrel Kreitz,
a 14.3 man.
Minnesota won the national title
with 46 points, followed by South
ern California, Texas, Illinois, Cal
ifornia and Stanford in that order.
Only double winner in Minne
apolis was Trojan Mel Patton who
Hew to 10.4 and 20.7 victories in
the 100 and 200 meter sprints. The
lean Patton recently lowered the 100
yard dash record to 9.3 seconds in
F resno.
Coach Jack Weiershauser of Stan
lord, whose American record of 20.9
in the 200 meters around a turn
was shattered by Patton Saturday,
is with the Cardinals. He will keep
them in shape until their Olympic
tryouts and if they are successful,
will see them off to London a week
later.
All the Stanford team members
won the right to represent the
Coast Conference by playing in the
annual PCC meet in Los Angeles
last month.
