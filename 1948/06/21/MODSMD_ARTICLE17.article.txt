POUGHKEEPSIE, N. Y., June 20
(UP) â€”Wisconsin, last of the 11
crews to arrive on the scene, occu
pied the Hudson alone today for a
final stiff workout before Tuesday's
running of the Poughkeepsie regatta.
For the most part, the other eights
took it easy and even mixed a little
pleasure with business as they wound
up training for the three-mile classic.
