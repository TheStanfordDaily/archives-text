## GOLF TOURNEY Card Team To Compete 
### 
Beginning next Monday and car
rying throughout tin? week the 51st
NCAA Guli' Championship Tourna
ment will catch the nation's college
sports spotlight. This year for the
first time the tournament will move
to the far westâ€”to Stanford.
Stanford's golf course has been
termed one of the most difficult on
the Pacific coast.
Stanford has entered Tom Lam
bie, Roy Moe, Jack Shuler, Ernest
Kellberg, Bob Crozier, Bill Savage,
and Bill Lowe. These men are ex
pected to put up a still fight for the
team crown. They lost only one
dual match, to USC, while tying two
and winning the rest on the way to
the Southern Division, PCC Champ
ionship. They came out second be
hind San Jose State College in the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Tournament.
Thirty-six universities and col
leges will be represented by 140
leading collegiate golfers of the na
tion. Medal play on Monday and
Tuesday will settle the team champ
ionship. Match play opens Wednes
day.
Twenty full teams have entered
the competition. Stanford will be
up against defending team champ
ions Louisiana State University,
again the leading contenders. Strong
coast teams to watch in the tourney
are the University of Washington,
PCC Northern Division winner, and
San Jose State College, Northern
California Intercollegiate and Calif
ornia Collegiate winner.
Dave Barclay, defending individ
ual champion from the University
of Michigan, will be hard pressed
by such men as Stanford's Lambie
and Kellberg. Lambie was a quar
ter finalist in the 1947 NCAA meet,
and Kellberg in 1947 was the run
ner-up in the Northern California
Intercollegiates. All the Card golf
ers have impressive individual rec
ords.
San Jose State's Bob Harris will
be a strong contender for the indi
vidual award. Harris was a co
medalist in the 1947 NCAA meet
and led his team to this year's
championship.
