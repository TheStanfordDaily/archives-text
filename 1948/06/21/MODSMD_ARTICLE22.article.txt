## It's 'Our' Honor Code 
### 
Rather than monitoring examinations to see that there is no
cheating of "unpermitted aid given or received," students at
Stanford are governed by the Honor Code.
Briefly the Honor Code means that:
1. No unpermitted aid is to be given or received for any exam
ination, paper, project, or other assigned work.
2. Identical material shall not be turned in for two courses
without the instructors' knowledge.
3. Library rules shall be observed.
The Honor Code cannot work at Stanford unless both the stu
dents and professors believe in it and make it work. To them
the Honor Code is entrusted for success.
On their part the students must obey the Code fully and not
violate it by giving someone a small hint during an examination i
or any unpermitted aid in projects or papers, no matter how
slight. It is also the duty of the students to report any violations
of the Honor Code to Men's or Women's Councils. This is as
much a part of the Code as refraining from giving unpermitted
aid.
The faculty must also do its part to insure the success of the
honor system. Giving lip service to the Honor Code is not :
enough; they must believe in it and give it the opportunity to
work. This applies to the instructors and readers as well as the
full professors. At the beginning of the guarter, it would be a
good idea for the professors to indicate just what they consider
unpermitted aid, especially in regard to papers, projects, and
other such assignments.
With the great number of new students here this summer,
the task of having an effective Honor Code will be that much
harder. However, there is no reason why this quarter should be
any exception to other quarters. You, students and faculty mem- j
bers, have the responsibility of continuing this tradition.—B. M. i
