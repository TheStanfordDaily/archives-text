Now thai the Summer Quarter is two days old, and you have already
given up those fancy and foolish thoughts about going Phi Bete, we'd
like to suggest a few places where you will enjoy yourself more than in
those stuffy classrooms.
For students who like the chilling waves of the Pacific Ocean, Half j
Moon Bay is .">() miles away. Swimming, diving, and drowning are the :
more popular acquatic diversions.
Some students like to extend their weekending from Thursday morn- !
t() Tuesday evening and for these people, we advise a trip to Del Mar, ,
a delightful spa 513 miles directly south. Slow horses, fast women, and
well stocked bars are some of the features that make life so interesting !
at Del Mar.
Other students prefer movies at advanced prices. Several Peninsula
theaters are designed to fulfill these wishes. Many Academy Award
flickers have been recently presented at these theaters. They include
"Boston Blackie Returns," "Lassie Come Home," and"The Sweetheart
of Sigma Chi."
To those people who enjoy good food, we'd like to mention "Candy '
Claude" Strauss' Cellar. This subterranean spot is offering full service
this summer, and gourmet specialialties include cold soup, coffee with a
"b.0.," and roast beef prepared by the Apox Leather Co. of San Jose.
For the more socially-minded Stanford men, we're offering the phone
number of Palo Alto 9043. A well-bred stock of lovely feminines are in
residence, and they are eager to go out on dates, especially if you own
a Cadillac, and can afford wining and dining them at the Mark Hopkins.
Some serious-minded students are interested in getting ahead in this
world. To these individuals, we suggest working on The Stanford Daily.
There you will become associated with such noted newsmen as Jiggs
McNulty .Cirunion Schmeckenklipp, Sabu Hatband, and Zazu L. Borscht.
After two quarters on The Daily, you will be ready for The New York
Times. Or at least you'll be ready.
To the students who need some quick cash, we'd suggest you contact
Eight-to-Five McGinty of the Horse and Handbook Set. He has many
"goodies." and as proof of his own financial success, Eight-to-Five is now
residing in the Rest Room at Bay Meadows.
And for those people who enjoy athletic events, a complete program
of midget auto racing is on tap at various Bay Area stadia. Of particular
note is the trophy dash at one track, where the winner gets two turkey
pies, one t 'ih of bourbon, and a five dollar bill. Yes, these midget drivers
are the finest outdoor athletes in existence.
