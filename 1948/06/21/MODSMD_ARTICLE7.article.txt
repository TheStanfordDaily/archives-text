# Politicians Sweep the Floor, Clean Up Loose Ends, Pack Their Bags, Go To Convention

WASHINGTON. June 20 (UP) —
Congress adjourned tit 7:14 a.m.
(EDT) today and Republican law
makers straggled sleepily off to Phil
adelphia to help choose a presidential
candidate who may send them back
into session.
In a gruelling stretch drive that
kept senators at work for 43 V4 hours
straight, the House and Senate
cleaned up most of the "must" items
on their calendars but failed to agree
on a comprehensive housing program.
The adjournment resolution was so
worded as to give GOP congressional
leaders, as well as President Truman,
the power to call Congress back later
this summer.
The Republican standard-bearer
selected this week undoubtedly will
have a big voice in deciding whether
the congressional leaders use their
recall power to take another stab at
the housing problem.
Democratic National Chairman
Senator J. Howard McGrath charged
that GOP leaders threw Congress
into ''the most confused last-minttte
legislative muddle in history"' in
their haste to get on to the party's
convention.
His statement denounced the rec

ord of the Republican-controlled
Congress on housing, high prices,
public power and a dozen other is
sues in much the same vein taken
by President Truman on his recent
cross-country tour.
LAST-MINUTE LOAN BILL
Congress did pass one housing bill
in the final hours. It would estab
lish a secondary market for GI home
loan mortgages, to make it easier for
veterans to get bank credit under the
GI Bill of Rights.
But the long range Taft-Ellender-
Wagner Housing Bill which the Sen
ate passed earlier in the session, and
which President Truman strongly
supports, was lost in a Senate-House
deadlock over its public housing fea
tures.
Other major bills passed and sent
to the White House in the closing
marathon included:
A peacetime draft act under which
inductions of men 19 through 25 for
21 months' service will bgin in about
90 days if President Truman pro
claims (as he is almost sure to do)
that voluntary recruiting has failed.
FOREIGN" AID
A $1>.030,710,228 foreign aid soend

ing bill which represented a major
victory for Senate President Arthur
H. Vandenberg, and a sharp defeat
for Chairman John Taber of the
House Appropriations Committee.
Other appropriation bills totalling
about $14,000,000,000 to operate gov
ernment agencies during the fiscal
year 1949 beginning next month.
A compromise farm bill extending
present price supports for one year
beyond their scheduled expiration
date of December 31. After that, on
January 1, 1950, major provisions of
the Senate's long-range farm pro
gram would go into effect.
ADMIT EUROPE DPs
A bill to admit 205,000 European
displaced persons to the United
Slates.
Extending the present terms of
Chairman David E. Lilienthal and
the four members of the Atomic
Energy Commission to June 30. 1950.
A pay raise for 1.330.000 federal
workers. Postal employees would
get $450 a year, and classified civil
service employees $330.
A $450,000,000 two-year program of
federal aid to states for highway
improvement.

in the final hours. It would estab
lish a secondary market for GI home
loan mortgages, to make it easier for
veterans to get bank credit under the
GI Bill of Rights.
But the long range Taft-Ellender-
Wagner Housing Bill which the Sen
ate passed earlier in the session, and
which President Truman strongly
supports, was lost in a Senate-House
deadlock over its public housing fea
tures.
Other major bills passed and sent
to the White House in the closing
marathon included:
A peacetime draft act under which
inductions of men 19 through 25 for
21 months' service will bgin in about
90 days if President Truman pro
claims (as he is almost sure to do)
that voluntary recruiting has failed.
FOREIGN" AID
A $1>.030,710,228 foreign aid soend

ing bill which represented a major
victory for Senate President Arthur
H. Vandenberg, and a sharp defeat
for Chairman John Taber of the
House Appropriations Committee.
Other appropriation bills totalling
about $14,000,000,000 to operate gov
ernment agencies during the fiscal
year 1949 beginning next month.
A compromise farm bill extending
present price supports for one year
beyond their scheduled expiration
date of December 31. After that, on
January 1, 1950, major provisions of
the Senate's long-range farm pro
gram would go into effect.
ADMIT EUROPE DPs
A bill to admit 205,000 European
displaced persons to the United
Slates.
Extending the present terms of
Chairman David E. Lilienthal and
the four members of the Atomic
Energy Commission to June 30. 1950.
A pay raise for 1.330.000 federal
workers. Postal employees would
get $450 a year, and classified civil
service employees $330.
A $450,000,000 two-year program of
federal aid to states for highway
improvement.
WASHINGTON. June 20 (UP) —
Congress adjourned tit 7:14 a.m.
(EDT) today and Republican law
makers straggled sleepily off to Phil
adelphia to help choose a presidential
candidate who may send them back
into session.
In a gruelling stretch drive that
kept senators at work for 43 V4 hours
straight, the House and Senate
cleaned up most of the "must" items
on their calendars but failed to agree
on a comprehensive housing program.
The adjournment resolution was so
worded as to give GOP congressional
leaders, as well as President Truman,
the power to call Congress back later
this summer.
The Republican standard-bearer
selected this week undoubtedly will
have a big voice in deciding whether
the congressional leaders use their
recall power to take another stab at
the housing problem.
Democratic National Chairman
Senator J. Howard McGrath charged
that GOP leaders threw Congress
into ''the most confused last-minttte
legislative muddle in history"' in
their haste to get on to the party's
convention.
His statement denounced the rec

ord of the Republican-controlled
Congress on housing, high prices,
public power and a dozen other is
sues in much the same vein taken
by President Truman on his recent
cross-country tour.
LAST-MINUTE LOAN BILL
Congress did pass one housing bill
in the final hours. It would estab
lish a secondary market for GI home
loan mortgages, to make it easier for
veterans to get bank credit under the
GI Bill of Rights.
