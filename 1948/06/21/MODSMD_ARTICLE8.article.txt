# GOP Launches Parley Today
## Dewey Is Strongest Candidate On Eve of Republican Conclave 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, June 20 <UP) —Governor Thomas E. Dewey
of New York was the front-running contender for the Republicar
presidential nomination tonight on the eve of the GOP nationa'
convention, but it was far from in the bag.
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and former Governor Harold

►E. Stassen of Minnesota were also
strongly in the picture.
And there was yet the prospect
that none of them could muster the
548 convention votes needed to clinch
the nomination.
Should they fail and the conven
tion turn to a compromise, the mo>
likely prospect is Senate Presiden
Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigai
even though he is considered th
most reluctant member of the lar
dark horse field.
Dewey's position as ranking co
tender depended principally on t
fact that he almost certainly \v
have more votes than any oth
candidate when the first ballot
taken, probably Thursday.
Taft is slated to run second an
Stassen third on the first roll call.
HOLD VOTES IN RESERVE
Just how many votes each r
them will draw on the first roll cai
is still the closely guarded secret ot
their various campaign managers.
None of them apparently intends
to throw everything they have intr

something in reserve for the psycho

—Governor Earl Warren of Cali
fornia took personal command of
his convention fight tonight, pre
dicting that he stands "a fair
chance" of winning the GOP presi
dential nomination if the decision
is kept out of "smoke-filled rooms."
He called a press conference
soon after his arrival from the
West Coast to announce that he
is going to make an all-out fight
for the nomination.

ments on the succeeding roll calls.
It is important in national political
conventions to show growing
strength on each ballot. Any sign of
slipping is almost certainly fatal.
That is the way political observers
sized up the situation now that
Dewey. Taft, and Stassen. and prac
tically all of the convention's 1,049
delegates have arrived on the scene.
Dewey swiftly guaranteed there
won't be any "smoke-filled room"
compromise choice in the event he
hasn't won the nomination after one
or two ballots.
The New York governor told a
press conference that once the bal
loting starts he wants the convention
to stay in continuous session until a
candidate is chosen. That would pre
clude "trades" in hotel rooms should
early ballots develop a deadlock.
WILL NOT PREDICT
He said he was confident of win
ning the nomination on an earl/
ballot but wouldn't predict which
one.
Taft, delayed by the long closing
session of Congress, also held a press
conference. He said he considered
the presidential contest as "largely" a
race between himself and Dewey and
added, "I think I have a better
chance of winning."

—Governor Earl Warren of Cali

his convention fight tonight, pre

chance" of winning the GOP presi

is kept out of "smoke-filled rooms."
He called a press conference

It is important in national political
conventions to show growing
strength on each ballot. Any sign of
slipping is almost certainly fatal.
That is the way political observers
sized up the situation now that
Dewey. Taft, and Stassen. and prac
tically all of the convention's 1,049
delegates have arrived on the scene.
Dewey swiftly guaranteed there
won't be any "smoke-filled room"
compromise choice in the event he
hasn't won the nomination after one
or two ballots.
The New York governor told a
press conference that once the bal
loting starts he wants the convention
to stay in continuous session until a
candidate is chosen. That would pre
clude "trades" in hotel rooms should
early ballots develop a deadlock.
WILL NOT PREDICT
He said he was confident of win
ning the nomination on an earl/
ballot but wouldn't predict which
one.
Taft, delayed by the long closing
session of Congress, also held a press
conference. He said he considered
the presidential contest as "largely" a
race between himself and Dewey and
added, "I think I have a better
chance of winning."

PHILADELPHIA, June 20 <UP) —Governor Thomas E. Dewey
of New York was the front-running contender for the Republicar
presidential nomination tonight on the eve of the GOP nationa'
convention, but it was far from in the bag.
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and former Governor Harold

►E. Stassen of Minnesota were also
strongly in the picture.
And there was yet the prospect
that none of them could muster the
548 convention votes needed to clinch
the nomination.
Should they fail and the conven

likely prospect is Senate Presiden
Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigai
even though he is considered th
most reluctant member of the lar
dark horse field.
Dewey's position as ranking co

fact that he almost certainly \v
have more votes than any oth

taken, probably Thursday.
