# Construction to Start On New Men's Residence
## Stern Hall, Ready in 1949, Will House 240 Undergrads 
### 
Construction will start immediately on a new residence hall
for 240 undergraduate men, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, acting president
of the University, announced yesterday.
The hall, made possible by a gift from the estate of Mrs. Louis
Stern of Palo Alto, is expected to be ready for occupancy by

the summer of 1949.
It will be constructed southwest
of another new student residence,
Crothers Hall, which will be ready
for use by 63 law students autumn
quarter.
Stern Hall will be made up of
two units. Each unit will include
two pavilions forming a right angle
and connected by covered path
ways. The pavilions will each house
60 students in double rooms. There
will be a guest sitting room and a
two-room student sponsor's apart
ment in each pavilion.
THE TOTAL COST of the two
units, including furnishings, land
scaping, and utilities, is expected
to be more than $700,000.
Two of the pavilions will face on
Escondido Road, one on Galvez
Street, and the other on Arguello
Street.
The two-story residence hall, de
signed by Spencer and Ambrose of
San Francisco, will be of contem
porary architecture, with buff-col
ored walls set off by contrasting
areas of slate gray. The walls,
floors, and at roof will all be of
reinforced concrete.
THE GIFT was made through
the trustee of the estate of Mrs.
Stern, Palo Alto philanthropist, who
died in 1946. She was known as
' Aunt Lucie" to three decades of
Stanford men to whom her home
was always open as a gathering
place for students and faculty alike.
A provision of the gift is that the
University will never permit any
discrimination of race, color, or
creed in the assignment of students
to the hall.
Mrs. Stern also donated the Stan
ford Hospital Ruth Stern Research
Laboratory, named after her
daughter; a children's Free Bed
Fund at the Stanford Convalescent
Home; the Lucie Stern Fellowship
for Special Study; and a fluorosco
pic unit used by the Stanford Stu
dent Health Service to aid in the
detection of tuberculosis. She also
provided funds for a nurses' cot
tage at the Palo Alto Hospital on
the University campus.
