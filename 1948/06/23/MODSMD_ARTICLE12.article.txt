A program of French Grand Opera
wil be tonight by the Stanford
Workshop. The performance will be
gin at 8:15 in the Woodpecker Lodge.
The entertainment will include
Act Two of MANON, Act Three of
FAUST and five scenes from CAR
MEN. According to Jan Popper,
musical director of Stanford's Opera
Workshop, all of these offerings had
been rehearsed Spring quarter. Ac
tual performance of these operas
had to be postponed, however, due
to the Workshop's staging of PETER
GRIMES.
The music is emphasized in this
production. No costumes will be
used and the scenes will be sketches
of those arranged by Joel Carter of
the music department faculty.
This is the grand opening for the
newly-constructed stage of Wood
pecker Lodge, an old wooden build
ing near the Women's Gym. Admis
sion is free.
