# Talk Emphasizes Poet's Difficulty
## 
### 
The importance of environment
in the interpretation of modern po
etry was stressed last night by Ste
phen Spender, prominent English
poet.
"Because of the many specialized
fields in the modern world, it is
hard for a poet to express himself
in a language universal to every
one," Spender said.
Spender's talk, before an audi
ence of 500, opened the Tuesday
Evening Lecture Series, which is
to be held at the Memorial Audi
torium every Tuesday at 8 p.m.
Subject for next week's talk will
be "Brazil in the Future World."
