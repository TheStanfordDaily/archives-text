# Russ Veto A-Plan
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y.â€”Russia
used its 26th veto today to block
formal approval of the American
formula for international control of
atomic energy.
Actually, the American plan has
been a dead letter for two years
because of Russia's refusal to go
along with the majority in backing
it. Therefore, the Soviet veto did
not provide the "death blow."
However, the veto did bring to a
climax the two-year effort of the
UN to devise an acceptable plan to
control atomic energy. It set the

stage for a full-scale debate of the
atomic deadlock in the general as
sembly when it meets in Paris next
fall. The vote on the American plan
was 9 to 2 with Russia joining the
Ukraine in the negative.
