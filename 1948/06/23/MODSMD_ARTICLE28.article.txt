## It's Your Choice

About this time every summer quarter we hear the same line
cf grumbling and gripes about the apparent lack of social activity
on campus. Perennial gripers either affix the responsibility with
the Social Committee or just complain to hear the sound of their
own voices.
Granted, the number of social activities during summer quar
ter leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a far cry from what we
have during the regular social year.
Granted, the school on the whole is run on a high academic
p.'ane; we recognize the fact that we aren't attending a dancing
academy. Nevertheless, a fair proportion of our time should be
devoted to participation in social activity.
A glance at registration figures shows that we have less than
half a normal quarter's enrollment. That fact in itself will be one
strong factor in the lack of activity. Another factor affecting the
number of activities might be the large proportion of non
matriculating students.
These might well be called "contributing factors." They are
by no means the only ones.
The greatest single factor in the failure of social programs in
the past has been the lack of interest on the part of students.
On the basis of what has gone on so far this quarter, it appears
that the people who choose to do the griping are the ones that
never show up at campus functions.
The fault in campus activity can be explained in either of two
ways:
1. A poorly planned program by Social Committee could easily
djscourage participation on the part of students.
2. A marked lack of interest on the part of students could
convince Social Committee that their efforts are being wasted
in planning social events.
We feel that the fault in the past has rested with the latter.
Where we can assign it this quarter is a matter not yet decided.
The acid test will come this weekend. Social Committee has
put forth a great deal of time and effort to make the all-campus
dance Saturday night a success. We feel that they've done their
part.
Nov/ it's up to you. The choice is yours whether summer
social activity is increased, maintained at its present level, or
allowed to die out as it has in the past. â€”D.K.
