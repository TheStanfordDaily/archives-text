Seme traditions serve no earthly use—they continue in ex
istence through the efforts of a small group of sentimentalists.
With this type of tradition we haven't much to say one way or
another.
Other traditions, such as Stanford's "Ride to Paly," is not only
old and respected, but it serves a useful purpose. It is of some
benefit to someone.
Briefly, the "Ride to Paly" tradition is that students driving to
or from Paly pick up their walking fellow-students. Pick-up spots
are at the "Y" on Palm Drive going down, and at Wilson's
corner corning back to campus.
It's a simple tradition. It has continued to exist as long as
most of our less useful traditions. It is noteworthy that it has
been so long-lived.
