# Russians Seek Uranium
## 
### 
BEKLIN (UP). —The Soviet Union employs up to 40,000 workers in a
gigantic treasure hunt for uranium in Germany and Czechoslovakia, ac
cording to Allied observers here.
The hunt is said to be almost fruitless. Although they are Europe's
richest, the Czech uranium mines produce a maximum of only 15 tons
of uranium metal each year, according to State Department sources.
The German mines are said to produce about half that.
The Russian search for the stuff of which atom bombs are made is
centered in the Erz Mountains, in a circular area roughly 20 miles in
diameter, which bulges out on either side of the German-Czech border.
Russian youths and trusted Germans go into abandoned silver and
salt mine shafts with uranium detecting apparatus.
When the detectors show the presence of uranium, German and Czech
miners go to work on the veins.
