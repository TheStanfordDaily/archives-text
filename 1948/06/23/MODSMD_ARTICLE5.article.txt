## Platform Drafters Ask Strong Foreign Policy 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, June 22—(UP) —Republican
policy drafters laid down a party platform with
a strong internationalist plank and a domestic
program of lower taxes and living costs, gov
ernment economy, anti-Communism, and fed
eral guarantees of civil rights. ♦ —7 —

The platform on which the Re- !
publicans will fight out the presi- j
dential campaign, was a clear-cut J
endorsement of Senate President
Arthur H. Vandenberg's foreign pol
icy views. It apparently was in- j
tended to knock isolationism out of
the picture as a campaign issue.
Drafter by the 104-member reso- !
lutions committee, it will be sub
| mitted to the convention tomorrow
j and all signs are that it will be rati
j fied without a major fight.
Vandenberg and Senator Robert
j A. Taft of Ohio were the first can
j didates to comment. Both endorsed '
( it without qualification.
VANDENBERG PRAISED it as "a
j superlative job" and indicated he j
' regarded it as a boost for his Senate j
| foreign leadership.
Taft said he approved of the plat- j
! form "thoroughly" and was "quite !
! willing to endorse it."
Committee members indicated that !
' the only real dissension in their j
! drafting session came over the for
j eign policy and civil rights questions. |
Foes of the Vandenberg interna
| tionalism fought bitterly to tone !
j down the foreign policy statement,
| but they were overridden after an :
| hours-long debate.
SOUTHERN COMMITTEE mem- |
I bers also tried vainly to block the j
i civil rights plank, which "favored" |
prompt enactment of a federal anti- j
lynch law, elimination of racial seg
regation in the armed forces, and !
"equal opportunity to work," regard
| less of race, creed or color.
Edgar G. Brown, director of the
I National Negro Council, denounced
; the civil liberties plank as "weasel
-1 worded" and "innocuous," because,
| he said, it contains no firm pledge
j of action.
THE FOREIGN POLICY section
was the longest in the 2,700-word
statement of party principles. It ad
vocates continued American aid to
"peace-loving nations" which try to
J help themselves; elimination of the
| big-power veto in the United Nations
j on all peaeeble settlements of inter
national dispute; creation of a UN
j armed force, and a foreign policy of j
| "friendly firmness" withuot appease
ment.
