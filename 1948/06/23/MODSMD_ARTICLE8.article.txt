## Taft-Stassen Deal Fails As Dewey Drive Gains 
### 
CONVENTION HALL, Philadelphia, June 22
(UP) â€”An attempted Taft-Stassen lineup agains:
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey collapsed tonight, giv
ing a new impetus to the New Yorker's blazincj
drive for the GOP presidential nomination.

Failure of his two chief rivals to
combine against him rocketed Dewey
into a commanding position as the
GOP National Convention finished
its preliminaries and prepared to
start picking the man it hopes to
land in the White House next Janu
ary.
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio
and Minnesota's Harold E. Stassen
held a secret parley in a downtown
Philadelphia hotel room after learn
ing that Dewey had bi'oken into th
key Pennsylvania delegation an
corralled a big chunk of that state'
73 votes.
With Pennsylvania's Dewey-hatir
Gov. James H. Duff, they spent mo
than two hours vainly trying 1>
agree on a workable combinatiu ;
against the red-hot New Yorker.
TAFT RETURNED to his hear
quarters at 11:30 p.m. (EDT). Here
: fused to discuss the meeting an
said Stassen and Duff had agree
| not to talk about it either.
But within a matter of minutes.
: Stassen was talking.
"A Taft-Stassen ticket is impos
j sible," he told reporters at his hotel
| headquarters.
"There is no deal and no arrange
i ment. The situation is unchanged
that I am in the race for the presi
dential nomination."
The Minnesotan said he had n
: plans for further meetings with Tal
And he said he wasn't going to me
with any other presidential candi
; dates.
ONE OF STASSEN'S supporter
said backers of Senate President Ai
I thur H. Vandenberg of Michigan als-i
i had been sounding out the Minnesota
| camp about a possible anti-Dewey
coalition.
Taft, who was understood to have
made the first overtures to Stassen,
also was reported to have been try
ing to make a deal with Vandenberg
and Gov. Earl Warren of California.
Neither of those two candidates
showed up at the Taft-Stassen*
Duff huddle.
Stassen made it clear without, say
ing it in so many words that he
had been offered the vice-presiden
tial spot on a Taft-for-President
ticket.
The Stassen headquarters planned
to stay open most of the night, but
if another major development was
brewing none of the Minnesotan's
i followers were talking about it.


GOV. THOMAS E. DEWEY gained
strength last night in his hid for
the Republican presidential nom
ination.
