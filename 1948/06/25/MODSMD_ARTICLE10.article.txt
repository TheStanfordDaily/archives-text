# Zeta Psi House Robbed Sunday
## 
### 
An unidentified burglar broke
into the Zeta Psi house late Sunday
night and made off with a fountain
pen and $50. The residents were
all asleep on the sleeping porch
and did not discover the theft until
the next morning.
This is the fourth theft of this
kind that has occurred this year,
according to Police Chief Gordon
Davis. Since the sleeping porches
are usually at a distance from the
rooms in which the clothes are left,
it is usually very easy for the thief
to get away without being caught,
Davis said.
He warned all fraternity houses
to secure their property at night.
