CONVENTION HALL. PHILA
DELPHIA, June 24 (UP). —Go-.
Thomas E. Dewey of New Yor!-
won the unanimous GOP nomina
tion for President of the United
States at the Republican national
convention tonight when his rivals
quit after two ballots and threw
him their votes on the third.
The 46 - year - old candidate im -
mediately accepted. He told th
wildly cheering delegates he wou!
"unite our party and our count:
in meeting the grave challenge <
our time."
AND HE PROMISED his elect!
| workers "the biggest house c!ea
I ing you have ever seen in Was!
ington last January."
That wound up one of the bitte
est Republican party battles in r
cent years and left the weary del
gates nothing more to do but nor
inate a Vice-Presidential runnir
mate for Dewey tomorrow.
The rivals slowed Dewey's banc'
wagon on the first ballot. But i
started to roll during the seconc
and they threw in the sponge be
fore the roaring convention began
its third vote.
GOVERNOR EARL WARRE?
was the first to quit. At 8:09 p.m.
EDT, he released his 53 delegate
and gave them to Dewey, who the
needed only 33 for a winning nr.
jority—s4B of the 1,094 delegates.
Ten minutes later, Sen. Robert /
Taft of Ohio conceded defeat ar
withdrew from the race. Taft Wf
the 4G-year-old New Yorker's clo>
jest early challenger, and his su
render turned the Dewey victor.
] into a landslide.
FORMER GOVERNOR STASSE>
! mounted the rostrum next and an
| nounced his withdrawal. Gov. Kim
| Sigler of Michigan followed to take
the "drafted" Senate Presiidetn Ar
j thur H. Vandenberg out of the fight.
A move to make the nomination
by acclamation was ruled out of
order, and the convention moved
swiftly through the roll call of its
i third ballot which made Dewey a
unanimous choice.
Dewey, his eyes brimming with
tears, heard the news at his down
town hotel headquarters.
"I AM GRATEFUL for the
confidence of the elected represen
tatives of my party and hope God
gives me strength to merit it,"he
said.
He and Mrs. Dewey drove at once
to Convention Hall to deliver hi>
formal acceptance speech.
The next convention business was
the nomination of a Vice-President,
to be taken up tomorrow. Dewey's
headquarters said the choice of a
second man on the Dewey ticket
was still "wide open."
BUT THE MAIN contender for
that post at the moment appeared
to be Rep. Charles A. Halleck of
Indiana, floor leader of the House
of Representatives.
Halleck helped give the Dewey
bandwagon its winning shove yes
terday by withdrawing his own "fa
vored son", candidacy and throwing
Indiana's 29 votes to the New York
er.
Col. Robert R. McCormick. pub
lisher of the Chicago Tribune, who
backed Taft against Dewey, has
charged that* Halleck was promised
the Vice-Presidential nomination in
return for "giving" his state's votes
to Dewey.
Taft trailed badly from the start
of the balloting. He drew 224 votes
on the first roll call and 274 on the
second, against the Dewey drivs
that picked up 434 the first tima
round and 515 on the second tally.
STASSEN, VANDENBERG, War
en, Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, and
, ; i few other hopefuls were far out
of the running from the opening
call.
Dewey was smiling proudly when
he stepped up to the convention
licrophones to deliver his victory
-Idress in the sweltering glare of
ie television and newsree] lights.
by one, he paid tribute to
.ie rivals he fought and defeated
or the nomination. He drew a tre
nendous ovation when he pledged
himself "to unite our party and our
'ountry in meeting the grave chal
nge of our time."
lIIE CANDIDATE endorsed the
ongly internationalist platform
opted by the convention, and
romised a determined effort to es
ablish "a just and lasting peace in
ie world."
"As long as the world is half free
ad half slave," he said, "we must
peacefully labor to help men ev
rv where to achieve liberty."
Dewey took the Republican con
tention equally by storm in Chi
cago four years ago, only to be flat
ened in November by the Roose
velt fourth-time steamroller.
CUT THIS TIME, victory-starved
Republicans were dead sure they
had a presidential winner for the
first time in 20 years.
They were convinced Dewey
would clean up in the coming elec
;ion, whether the Democrats nomi
nate President Truman or someone
else at their party convention here
next month.
Matured by four years in the na
tion's biggest state executive job,
Dewey is expected to be a much
more seasoned campaigner than he
was when he took on the formi
dable FDR in 1944. He was then 42
years of age, the youngest Presi
dential candidate ever put forward
by a major political party.
HE WAS A HEAVY favorite to
win the nomination when the con
vention started balloting shortly
after 2:36 p.m., EDT. today and he
crashed through despite every at
tempt by the loosely combined Taft,
Stassen, and Vandenberg forces to
stop him.
His rivals, hopeful of working out
a deal that could wreck the Dewey
bandwagon, forced a recess at 4:56
p.m., EDT, after the second ballot
was counted.
By the time the convention re
convened at 7:30 p.m., EDT. they
knew their gamble had failed. The
swing to Dewey was in full move
ment and the nomination was in
the bag.
The recess actually gave Dewey
time for the final winning drive.
