Less than a week remains before
I California's new Financial Respon
' sibi.ity Law goes into effect, A. H.
Henderson, director of motor ve
i hides, announced yesterday.
Under the new law, a driver
; must stop, help care for the in
; jured, identify himself fully to oc
| cupants of the other vehicle, and
show his driver's license upon re
quest at the time of an accident,
Henderson explained.
"After July 1." Henderson said.
I "there are two important responsi
j bilities that California motorists
| will have under the new law.
"First, they must make a report
jof any accident involving injury,
death, or damage to the property
of any one person in excess of $100.
The report must be made in writing
within 10 days to the Department
' of Motor Vehicles at Sacramento.
"Second, within (!0 days of filing
| the report, the driver must deposit
security in a sum sufficient in the
j judgment of the department to sat
l isfy judgment for damages arising
| from the accident. A valid auto
i mobile liability insurance policy is
I considered to fulfill all require
i ments."
