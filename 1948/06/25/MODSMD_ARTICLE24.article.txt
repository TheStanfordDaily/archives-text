# Draft Law Now Signed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 24 (UP)—
President Truman today signed the
new peacetime draft law 'aimed at
strengthening the nation's armed
forces as a warning to would-be ag
gressors.
The measure, which Congress
passed after a bitter struggle, pro
vides for the induction of men aged
19 through 25 for 21-month hitches
in the army, navy, airforce, or mar
ines.
INDUCTIONS, however, cannot
begin for at least 90 days unless
the President declares a national
emergency.
About 225.000 men are expected
to be drafted during the first 12
months of the law's operation.
President Truman is expected to
defer married men, fathers, and men
with essential jobs in industry, agri
culture or government in the first
call-ups. The new law gives him
this authority.
THE LAW IS designed to build
the armed forces to a peacetime high
of 2,005,882 men in all branches.
The number of men in service as of
June 1 was approximately 1,399,000
men.
The new quotas are 837.000 for the
army, 662,882 for the navy, and ma
rines, and 502,000 for. the air force.
Most of the 225,000 draftees in the
first year are expected to go into the
army, since the navy, marines, and
air force expect to get all they
need through voluntary enlistments.
Youths 18 years of age still can
escape the draft. They can do so by
(1) signing up for 12 months' serv
ice before they are 19 and (2) join
ing the organized reserves after that
year is over. Youths of 18 will not
be allowed to serve overseas.
ALL MALES aged 18 through 25
i must register with the exception of
members of the armed services and
diplomats and their families.
The principal exemptions are of
most veterans, ministers, members
of organized, drilling reserves, con
scientious objectors, and most public
officials.
VETERANS WHO SERVED 18
months between Sept. 16, 1940, and
today are exempt. All those who
served 90 days or more during the
"shooting wax - " —Dec. 7, 1941, to
Sept. 2, 1945—a150 are exempt.
High school students may be de
ferred until they graduate, drop out
of school, or reach the age of 20,
whichever is first. A college student
can finish the school year in which
he receives his induction call.
MEN 19 THROUGH 25 may vol-
I unteer for 21 months, and so may
members of the enlisted reserves.
| For volunteers, the "entrance exam"
score is cut to 70.
Administration officials said the
President will use his power under
the law to put off inductions of men
aged 19 through 25 who are sup
porting a wife, children, or other
relatives. They said he also will
grant deferments to "necessary"
workers in agriculture, industry or
} the government.
