# Waterfront Strikers End Work Stoppage
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. June 24 (UP)
â€” San Francisco waterfront em
ployees returned to their jobs at
noon today after a stop-work meet
ing this morning that forced a com
plete shutdown of all waterfront
activities since midnight.
At the meeting Harry Bridges told
the members that the union must
respect Federal Judge George B.
Harris' court order barring a sched
uled strike for another 10 days.
The major issue in the dispute is
the watarfront hiring hall's dis
patcher. The job is now held by a
union man, but employers insist,
under the Taft-Hartley Act, it
should be a neutral person.
