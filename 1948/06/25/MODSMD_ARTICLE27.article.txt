## 
### 
BERLIN, June 24 (UP). —Gen.
| Lucius D. Clay announced today
j that the Russians would not drive
j the United States Army out of
Berlin by any means short of war.
A crisis in which the Russians
sought to starve the Western Allies
out of the capital reached the ex
plosion point.
British troops with full war
i equipment reinforced German po
! lice at the Lehrter railroad station
j in the British sector tonight when
; Russian army authorities tried to
I force the loading of scrap metal on
j German freight trains.
Berlin was in a virtual state of j
siege by the Russians in what Maj.
1 Gen. George P. Hays, Clay's deputy
as commander in chief, called the
biggest battle being fought against
Communism anywhere in the j
j world.
Electric power and water, con- 1
trolled by the Russians, were cut
off for hours from the western sec- 1
j tors. Railroad and automobile |
j traffic to the western zones stopped j
j completely.
In retaliation the British stopped i
! movement of all freight trains car
' rying coal, iron, steel, and other
vital supplies from their zone to the
j Russian zone outside of Berlin.
All American troops were put on j
|an emergency alert. Tanks and
j heavily armed jeeps roared through
| the streets of the American sector
j with sirens screaming, watching for
! any Russian - inspired Communist
I outbreak.
