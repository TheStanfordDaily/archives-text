# Davies Welcomes NCAA Golfers
## 
### 
Don Davies, ASSU president, ex
tends a hearty welcome to the NC
AA golfers on behalf of Stanford
University students, and cordially
invites them to attend an informal
dance to be held at Alpha Sigma
Phi house tonight from 9 to 1. Rec
ords and refreshments will be on
hand. Dates will be arranged, if
wished.
ASSU also hopes that the golf
ers will turn out in full force at
the informal "no-date" dance to be
held in their honor in the Women's
Gym tomorrow night from 9 to 1.
Davies, speaking in behalf of all
Stanford students, "while subver
sively rooting for Stanford," wishes
all participants the best of luck on
the links.
