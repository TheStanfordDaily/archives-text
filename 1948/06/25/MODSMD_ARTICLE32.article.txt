# 70 Years of Ups and Downs
## 
### 
Did San Francisco's June 1 elcc
! tion mark the end of the line for
j the California Street Cable Rail
! way? While its fate hangs in the
balance, San Franciscans who grew
up with the familiar brown cars are
glancing back at the noteworthy
past of their city's last privately
owned cable line.
Its 70-year record of ups and
downs and its exciting story
prompted one San Franciscan, Ed
gar M. Kahn, to write a book called
"Cable Car Days in San Francisco,"
| perennial best-seller and one of the
| volumes in the Stanford University
Press's "Transportation Series."
Will an agreement between car
men and employers be effected in
time to avert the threatened July 1
shutdown? Will the once-defeated
bond-issue proposal be resubmitted
to the voters on the November bal
lot? Will a group of public-spirited
citizens raise enough funds for pur
chase of the line? Or will Centen
nial visitors to San Francisco find

California Street without its far
famed cable cars?
Mr. Kahn states that ever since
Leland Stanford started planning
i the California Street line in 1874 it
j has had troubles. Around the turn
| of the century the company weath
| ered a paralyzing series of labor
! grievances. Later it withstood sev-
I eral threats of municipal owner
ship. ironically its present salva
| tion.
Perhaps the most trying period
: of all followed the 1906 fire, when
reconstruction problems and strik
| ing carmen combined to give the
directors headaches. Still, with in
: domitable California spirit, resto
ration on a moderate scale was ac
j complished within the short span of
| two months.
