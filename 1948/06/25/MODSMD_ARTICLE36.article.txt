With the men's athletic program
at a minimum for the summer

posed intramural tournament. Be
cause of poor turnouts in the past,
there has been a definite reluctance
by the PE staff to sponsor any tour
nament plan.
Chuck Taylor, last year's intra
mural director, has offered to do
nate athletic equipment and the
services of the staff in the supply
of officials if a well-organized plan
is presented. Any possibilities of
future success will be determined
by the amount of co-operation
among the students, said Taylor.
