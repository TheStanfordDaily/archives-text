# SIRO Fame Increases; Spreads Stanford Name
## 
### JIM THURBER 
An organization which was al
most unknown at this time last
year but which has now achieved
ful! recognition on the Stanford
campus is the Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization. A branch
of the Institute of International Re
lations, it has played an active part
in spreading the name of the Uni
versity over the world.
Originally created for the pur
pose of sending clothes to the war
ravaged areas of Europe, SIRO has
expanded its facilities to include
many other activities. Its biggest
job last year was the Relief Drive
conducted in the fall in which it
raised over $12,000 for food and
clothing to be sent overseas.
OF INTEREST to all foreign lan
guage students is the correspond
ence branch of SIRO. Names of
Europeans who are interested in
writing to Americans are available,
and the organization maintains a
complete staff of translators for
those who do not understand the
language.

Anyone interested in working
with the Students'' International
Relief Organization is urged to
see Ronald Klein. Klein will have
office hours today and every Fri
day, from 2 to 4 p.m. The SIRO
shack is located on the west side
of Eneina Commons.

But in spite of the newly cre
ated departments, SIRO continues
to send bundles of clothes overseas,
and volunteers are needed to help
wrap and pack these clothes. Ex
excerpts from a letter by one of the
recipients of these bundles prove
that this work is not in vain.
"I was highly surprised and ex
tremely pleased when your won
derful parcel arrived last week. I

j want to thank you with all my
heart for the lovely things you
have sent.
"You can well imagine how wel
come your parcel was ajid how
useful too! Life is still pretty lough
these days and we still can't - get
any clothing or shoes.
"I don't know the names of the
persons who gave those things for
shipment. Will you please pass on
l my many thanks on my behalf?
