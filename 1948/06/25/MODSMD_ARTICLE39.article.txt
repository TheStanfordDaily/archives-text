PALO ALTO. June 24 (UP).—
Names in big type and not-so-can
did photographs on posters often
are all voters know of political can
didates. So the Palo Alto Mail-Dis
patch decided to change the situa
tion.
It is putting office-seekers on the
spot and their careers on the table
by asking them to fill out scientific
questionnaires about their activi
ties and capabilities and then pub
lishing the results. The Mail-Dis
patch c'aims such "career profiles"
are a "first"' in the nation.
So far eight candidates hgve
agreed to bare their lives. The
newspaper says "busy electioneer
ing by candidates is a weak excuse
for the 30 to (>0 minutes it takes to
fill out the career inventory ... so
that voters can have the democratic
prerogative to examine pertinent
and unbiased factual information
. . . without benefit of editorial
coloring."
STANDARD SURVEY USED
The surveys are the Van Allyn
qualification inventories widely
used by business and industry for
selection and placement of person
nel and by educational institutions
in vocational guidance work. They
make much lighter reading than
the usual political statements.
They reveal a person's vocational
abilities, limitations, and potentiali
ties. Measurements of character
(honesty, public loyalty, etc.) and
measurements of ideolgies (progres
siveness, conservativeness, social
ism, etc.) are not included.
For instance, two board of trus
tees candidates, Charles P. Burgess
and Donald R. Lilly, were quizzed
on 35 identical subjects. Their an
swers were analyzed and summed
up in terse paragraphs under each
subject heading. Some of the de
ductions wer enot at all compli
mentary.
Scores ranging from "o'' to "6"
were given all responses, and zig
zag charts carried under the pho
tographs. Bui - ge.ss and Lilly both
averaged "2" on their charts, ex
celling with the highest score of "6"

m a lew subjects, getting average
scores in many others, but drawing
blanks in some.
SUMMED l'P
On the subject of administration,
for example, Lilly "does not care to
assume full responsibility for deci
sions of critical importance but
prefers collaboration with others.
Has had courses in economics and
political science in college. Has had
no experience in operating his own
business or as a corporation officer.
Will stick to his decision regard
less of the opinions of others,"
On the subject of people, Bur
gess' answers show he "finds people
stimulating to him, but has had no
dealing with the human equation."
The candidates also give their
views and are rated accordingly on
the subjects of tools, machines,
counting, mathematics, records,
guages, religion, minerals, electric
ity, mechanics, meteorology, con
struction, chemistry, physics, ath-

patch c'aims such "career profiles"
are a "first"' in the nation.
So far eight candidates hgve
agreed to bare their lives. The
newspaper says "busy electioneer
ing by candidates is a weak excuse
for the 30 to (>0 minutes it takes to
fill out the career inventory ... so
that voters can have the democratic
prerogative to examine pertinent
and unbiased factual information
. . . without benefit of editorial
coloring."
STANDARD SURVEY USED
The surveys are the Van Allyn
qualification inventories widely
used by business and industry for
selection and placement of person
nel and by educational institutions
in vocational guidance work. They
make much lighter reading than
the usual political statements.
They reveal a person's vocational
abilities, limitations, and potentiali
ties. Measurements of character
(honesty, public loyalty, etc.) and
measurements of ideolgies (progres
siveness, conservativeness, social
ism, etc.) are not included.
For instance, two board of trus
tees candidates, Charles P. Burgess
and Donald R. Lilly, were quizzed
on 35 identical subjects. Their an
swers were analyzed and summed
up in terse paragraphs under each
subject heading. Some of the de
ductions wer enot at all compli
mentary.
Scores ranging from "o'' to "6"
were given all responses, and zig
zag charts carried under the pho
tographs. Bui - ge.ss and Lilly both
averaged "2" on their charts, ex
celling with the highest score of "6"

m a lew subjects, getting average
scores in many others, but drawing
blanks in some.
SUMMED l'P
On the subject of administration,
for example, Lilly "does not care to
assume full responsibility for deci
sions of critical importance but
prefers collaboration with others.
Has had courses in economics and
political science in college. Has had
no experience in operating his own
business or as a corporation officer.
Will stick to his decision regard
less of the opinions of others,"
On the subject of people, Bur
gess' answers show he "finds people
stimulating to him, but has had no
dealing with the human equation."
The candidates also give their
views and are rated accordingly on
the subjects of tools, machines,
counting, mathematics, records,
guages, religion, minerals, electric
ity, mechanics, meteorology, con
struction, chemistry, physics, ath-

Names in big type and not-so-can

It is putting office-seekers on the
spot and their careers on the table
by asking them to fill out scientific
questionnaires about their activi
