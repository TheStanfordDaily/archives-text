WITH THE STANFORD TRACK
TEAM. EVANSTON. 111., June 24.—
Coach Jack Weiershauser started
playing the role of juggler here to
day as he attempted to figure out
how he can qualify the most men
for the Olympic tryouts, slated
here July 9 and 10.
Four of his eight-man squad al
ready are eligible to compete—pole
' vaulter Bill Larson, shot putter Otis
| Chandler, broad jumper Gay Bry
an, and javelin thrower Bud Held.
WEIERSIIAUSER'S EYE is cast
toward the AAU championships in
[ Milwaukee next week, where the
other four Card cinder men may
possibly compete. It' they place in
; the top six in their events, they
; automatically qualify for the Olym-
J pic tests.
In al! likelihood, the Card men
; tor will send his three top flight
i hurdlers out against Harrison Dil—
! lard in the 110-meter high sticks.
! That means Downing McKee. Dar
j rcll Kreitz, and Skip Kent will be
pointing for a spot.
FOR LARRY HOI F, the Indian
quartermiler who did not qualify
tor the NCAA championships last
week, and thus did not place in the
final 440, there is a good chance of
an entry in the quartermile. Soph
! omore Larry, with a best time of
| 47.7 seconds this year, may find his
; opening at last.
Only Chandler and Bryan placed
J for Stanford in the Big Nine-PCC
] meet here Tuesday. Both took third
places. Chandler with a put of 52
feet 4 r, k inches, and Bryan with a
broad jump of 23 feet. % inch. Both
boys were far otT their previous
! bests.
