# Rain Causes Second Boxing Bout Delay
## 
### 
NEW YORK, June 24 (UP). â€”The heavyweight championship
bout between Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott was postponed
tonight for the second time until tomorrow night because of
thunderstorms.
Actual postponement was delayed until the last moment, but

when it was realized that Yankee-J
Stadium was more suited for a crew
race than for a fisticuffs event, Pro- ;
moter Mike Jacobs announced a I
24-hour reprieve.
THE 20TII CENTURY Boxing
Association, which is promoting the
fight, has a lease on the baseball
park until Sunday, which means
that if there is no letup in the rain
in (he next 48 hours, a long-range
postponement will have to be ar
ranged.
Meanwhile, odds on the cham
pionship bout remained stable, with
Louis still on the long end by ap
proximately 12 to 5 figures.
There has been some concern re
garding Louis' weight. He weighed
in at 214 but with the postpone
ments it is reported that he has
gained some weight and has lost his
fighting edge.
WALCOTT IS A ''NATURAL" at
195. so there was little worrying
regarding his weight. He stays at
that poundage continually, and is
not expected to weigh in at any
heavier figure when the fight is
finally held.
The advance gate has reached
$750,000. and might reach the magic |
figure of one million dollars if the j
fight isn't delayed beyond Friday |
evening.
