an exhibition of the finer points of
the game for the benefit of the
Coaching Clinic Wednesday after
noon at the Pavilion.
Luisetti. looking like the Hank of
old, hit with one-handers from all
angles. Howie Dallmar, Jim Pol
lard, Don Williams, and ex-Santa
Clara ace Bob Feerick completed
the unit which exhibited uncanny
passing, long - range one - banders
from inside and out, smashing lay
ups, and smooth pivot work.
Preceding the actual contest, each
player exhibited and explained to
the coaches his own particular
shots and those of several famous
team mates.
Dallmar explained Joe Fulks' re
markable shot, and Pollard demon
strated George Mikan's pivot plays.

the basketball phase of the Coach
ing Clinic.

the program today and tomorrow.
