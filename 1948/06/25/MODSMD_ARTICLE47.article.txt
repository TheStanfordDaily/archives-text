It is the accustomed thing among |
the coaching fraternity to stick to j
the athletic wars, and let the more j
sophisticated gents mount the pro- |
lessor's podium and don the horn- ;
rimmed specs for lecturing pur- j
poses.
Not so, Hawkshaw, with Stan- [
ford's men of the turf and hard
woods, who have turned professor
for a week to handle the chores oi
the Third Annual Stanford Coach
ing Clinic, now in progress at vari
ous nooks and crannies of the Farm
athletic plant.
More than 200 high school
coaches from throughout California
have been attending sessions since
Monday, presided over by Profes
sors Marchmont Schwartz and Ev
erett Dean, connoisseurs of football
and basketball, respectively, and
they evidently like the idea.
Today. Baseball Mentor Harry
Wolter, with the aid of the New
York Yankee coaching staff, takes
over the lectern for seme diamond ,
lips.
Professor Schwartz, who prefers !
to limit his lec- |

luring to dia
grams of the T
formation, the
style of attack
he knows best,
showed the prep
coaches a few
details of the
game of foot
ball. Everything

Prof. Schwartz f rom the A block
on an off-tackle smash to number
ing pass plays with a man in motion
rippled from the good Marchie's
lips.
I)IJAN IS PHILOSOPHER
Likewise Philosopher Dean, who
prefers to lead off his lectures with
his tried and true rudiments of
coaching, sent the basketball classes
away to a flying start Monday night
with movies of outstanding games
of the recent season. Tuseday and
Wednesday he took (he mentors to
the Pavilion floor where he demon
strated his techniques with live
dummies.
It is on odd thing for such go
ings-on as these. It is even odder
when coaches handle themselves so
admirably before the classroom. And
even more of an oddity to find, in
the garden variety of classroom, a
professor who does not ask for the

ideas to be thrown back in an ex
amination book.
CREATES GOOD WILL
Such is the merit of the Stan
ford Coaching Clinic, a week-long
course designed to give high school
coaches top-flight aid in devising
their athletic systems. The clinic,
so called for lack of a better name,
also creates good will toward Stan
ford among the prep set.
The 200 men attending the classes
evidently figure that the Stanford
coaches have something to offer,
nine football defeats in 1947 not
withstanding.
Only one qualification has per
vaded throughout the coaching in
struction. That is the fact that be
sides the know-how, a coach must
have good material with which to
work. Professor Marchmont stressed
that fact more than once in ex
plaining the intricacies of the split
second T formation.
The Clinic will feature baseball
movies tonight in Cubberley Audi
torium, and will wind up with field
instruction on the Sunken Diamond
all day tomorrow.
