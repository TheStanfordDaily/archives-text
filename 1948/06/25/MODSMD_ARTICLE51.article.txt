## Booby Trap 
### 
In a university where an honor code is a treasured tradition,
the so-called unannounced quiz strikes a strangely discordant
note.
It takes all the individual incentive out of study. It relegates
higher education to the level of adolescent regimentation.
Such a method does not permit the individual to budget his
study time according to the requirements of his own particular
program. University life offers many stimulating possibilities in
the form of evening forums and lectures. The situation is such
that the student cannot always prepare for the eventuality of an
unannounced quiz the next morning.
The unannounced quiz doesn't test the student's ability, and
it doesn't test his understanding of the course. It merely ascer
tains whether or not the student read the textbook the previous
night.
Textbooks are usually just as clear whether they are read the
night before an unannounced quiz or at some time more con
venient to the student.
Granted that the lectures might be more valuable if supple
mented by outside reading beforehand. We agree completely
that the student gets more out of a course when he keeps up with
the reading. But isn't it the student's own responsibility? Isn't
he the one who loses or gains through outside reading?
Then, why must he always have this "booby trap" hanging over
his head .... even in favorite courses?
Perhaps the unannounced quiz is all part of the desire to get
a more symmetrical curve. There seems to be a little too much
emphasis, in Farm exams, on "separating the men from the boys."
And there is not enough emphasis on teaching the materials of
the course in the clearest possible fashion.
In a school like Stanford, where admission is as highly selective
as it is, it seems that one might even assume that all students
could, with proper instruction, bring down high marks.
Then why cover the trail with irrelevant data merely to accom
plish a division within this highly selected group?
