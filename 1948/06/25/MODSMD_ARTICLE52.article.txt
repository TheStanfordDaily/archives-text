Some of this student griping at the increased tuition rates that go into
tfTect autumn quarter is entirely unwarranted.
When the Board of Trustees announced the tuition hike, they stated
that Stanford wasn't out of line with the outstanding Eastern universities,
and that the rates compared favorably with these other high-class schools.
And that's the way 1 feel about it.
Do you want everybody to think that we're a bunch of Western dudes
operating a bargain basement counter?
It might not even be a bad idea to push the tuition rates higher yet.
Then we're sure to be recognized as the outstanding school in the country,
and the East Coast laddies would have to take a back seat to us, instead of
the reverse.

Shame on the Administration!
First-quarter frosh are usually a bunch of ridiculously gay sprouts,
water-bagging and party-timing their way to a rollicking good time.
But with the present requirement that frosh have to go plus five in
order to stay at Stanford, the present crop of pea-greens are more solemn
and conservative than some of the ancient grad students roaming about
Stanford.
Hey. Administration, are you tryirg to ruin the youth of America
Let's keep our kids free from the insidious shackles of academic pres
sure.
Of the tremendous number of school teachers attending Stanford's
summer education program, I haven't been able to spot one of my prep
school instructors. And I'm sure glad.
When I was in high school, I was told that my teachers represented
the epitome of intelligence." and that to challenge any of their statements
would be heretical.
And if any of my teachers were at school now learning sometliing. :t
would mean that maybe they weren't quite as smart as i was led to be
lieve.
But, alas, my confidence in the supreme brilliance of my prep tutors
hasn't been destroy
