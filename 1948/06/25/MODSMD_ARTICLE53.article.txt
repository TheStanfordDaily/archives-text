# Peacetime Draft
## 
### 
The long period of waiting and wondering
about the peacetime draft is over. President
Truman saw fit to sign the measure yesterday.
While inductions are not scheduled to begin
for 90 days yet, the decision has been made.
And a lot of Farm men now know that they
face an interruption in their education of some
21 months.
Perhaps the momentary disappointment at
the forced interruption in education will be
replaced by a long-time satisfaction in a
strongly defended and powerful nation —a
nation much more able to assume its position
as the leading force behind democratic world
reconstruction.
We have seen in the past that apathy can
be disastrous. We know now that merely
not preparing for war will not insure peace.
Even when we were reducing our armed
forces and scrapping war materials, Russia
was not convinced of our peaceful motives.
Therefore, we must prepare for war in order
to avoid getting the short end of a rather dis
agreeable stick.
