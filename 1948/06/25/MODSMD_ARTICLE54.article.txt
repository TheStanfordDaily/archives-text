Prehistoric Man
PEIPING (UP) — On less money than is required
for a one-way plane ride to New York, a five-month
geological expedition has been organized here to
trace the 50-million-year link between the pre
historic Peking Man and present-day Chinese.
Dr. W. C. Pei, research fellow of the Chinese na
tional geological survey, who first unearthed the
Peking Man's remains near here in 1929, told the
United Press that local civil war conditions preclude
another search for contemporaries of his ancient find,
so he is looking elsewhere for new discoveries.
Communist troops, he said, are encamped only
three miles from the old excavation site at Chou
koutien. 40 miles west of Peiping, whose hilly
flanks are believed to secrete more skeletal bonan
zas.
Although the Peking Man's remains were mys
teriously lost while being spirited out of Japanese
reach in 1941, exact copies are owned by mtiseums
throughout the world, so the loss. Dr. Pci says.
4 is not very serious."
Further excavations, it is true should yield valu
able skeletal pieces. Up to now. knowledge of the
Peking Man's appearance is fragmentary from the
neck down. But at the moment Dr. Pei is more fired
with plans to hold a geological mirror to the Peking
Man's descendants.
Half a palm's span southwest of Peiping on an
average wall map lies the cradle of China. There,
in what is now known as Shensi, Honan, and south
ern Shansi, the Han race began tilling land and
building houses at a time when Rome stretched her
sword into the forests of barbaric Europe. Some 2.500
years of cultural and ethnological intermixing make
the region into a geologist's stew—hard to sift out
under any circumstances, impossible now that it
simmers with civil war.
But further on toward the sunset, in the area
known as China's Northwest, Dr. Pei marks the
"X where the different ingredients met before
they mingled.
"This," he said, tracing his finger over Kansu
and Kokonor, "is the crossroads of Chinese civil
ization." Mongol culture from the north, Tibetan
and Indian influences from the south, seeped into
a propitious funnel of river valleys which also—
Chinese records claim—gave China trade con
tact with the Romans in .><H) B.C.
"We know there was a dawning of human life in
China 50 million years a^e —the Peking Man proves

that. But what happened since that time and the
Christian Era? Our knowledge is scanty, We hope
our excavations will throw light both on aboriginal
life in what we now call China, and on what cultures
and peoples migrated from where to form the be
ginnings of the Chinese race."
The search for the birth of a nation will be car
ried out on an inflated Chinese shoestring. In
terms of soaring exchange quotations 011 the U.S.
dollar, the expedition's cost is less than I'.S. —
and hall" the amount. Dr. Pei says, will go for plane
pasage to Laiuhow for himself and his six asso
ciates.
