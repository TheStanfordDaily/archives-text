## History 1948 
### 
A number of recent developments point to the
urgent necessity for re-examining the haphazard
lack of system by which we staff our government on
all levels â€”federal, state, and municipal.
During the past few months, municipal and state
budget commissions have been revealing some of

the fantastic inefficiency and waste
in many of the leading cities and
states of the United States. Every
where, in cities, states, and in the
federal government, costs have
been rising, and anxious officials
are seeking ways that will make
administration more businesslike.
For government, our largest busi
ness, is far from being run like a
business.
It is a curious fact that, as per-

sonnel numbers and government
costs have risen, as services expand and new con
cepts of responsibility take hold, we have paid little
more attention than we did years ago to the training
of young men and women specifically for careers
in civil service and the higher posts in the gov
ernment.
A young man may set his goal to be a physician,
and work specifically toward that end from his high
school days. He may do the same with law, with
engineering, with teaching, and an infinite number
of other specialties. But how rare it is to hear a
young person say that he is studying for government?
As taxpayers, citizens, and otherwise we are greatly
the losers by the failure to see this problem as a
whole and act upon it. It would be a fine thing if
a close partnership could be worked out between our
colleges and our various governments whereby stu
dents training for government could actually serve
on a part-time or vacation basis in municipal, state,
and federal offices; a form of internship not only
educational for the students, but helpful to govern
ment itself.
There have been some experiments along this line,
but no wide use of the plan. This might be arranged
on a scholarship basis. It would bring fresh ideas
into musty government departments. It would also
tend to make the schooling for government less theo
retical and more practical. With a trained body of
graduates to draw upon, the civil service would be
constantly refreshed and strengthened.
Our governments have been extremely slow to
recognize their needs and opportunities for college
trained staffs. Their tardiness is matched only by
the lack of emphasis that our educational leaders
have given to this field of possible service. Only
when the necessary steps are taken both by govern
ment leaders and school officials to remedy the situa
tion of '"stale government" will we, as citizens, see
a porgressive, wholesome government in our United
States. Unfortunately, though, there is little evidence
even now of any emerging program to remedy the
situation.
