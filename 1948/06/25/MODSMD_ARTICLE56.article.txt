Nobody to \ ote For
To the Editor:
In view of the outcome of the Republican presi
dential nomination, the undersigned would like to
make the following observations:
1. A successful international policy in this period
of uncertainty will require the backing of all citi
zens. Our president, therefore, must not represent
the extremes of one party exclusively, but must have
rapport with all.
2. Current social and economic unrest demands a
president who will maintain a prudent domestic
economy; but who, liberal in outlook, will also
recognize and act upon any need for social legisla
tion.
3. A great number of people in this nation are
now without a presidential candidate whom they can
sincerely support. These people include many of
the younger and of the more foward-looking Repub
licans; and those members of the Democratic party
who can support neither Truman nor Wallace.
Improbable as it may seem, should there develop
a nation-wide move toward a coalition ticket, per
haps drafting Vandenberg-Stassen, we wish to state
our support of such a movement and, if.it should ma
terialize, enjoin other Stanford students of similar
opinion to do likewise.
