# U.S. Fights Russ Siege
## 
### 
BERLIN, June 27 (UP). —Al-
lied authorities clamped down
emergency rationing controls
in western Berlin today to fight
Russia's "cold" siege of the
capital.
Fleets of American, British, and
French air force planes prepared to
start a mass aerial supply service
tomorrow to bring the most essen
tial supplies to the 2,500.000 Ger
mans in their sectors whom the
Russians threaten to starve.
Three squadrons from the Alas
kan, Caribbean, and tactical air
commands had been ordered to the
Frankfurt area at the "request" of
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, American
commander in Germany.
The planes will begin leaving
their bases "within 24 hours" and
are being sent for the express pur
pose of "increased air facilities to
supply Berlin."
All American personnel in the
city were put on a voluntary ra
tioning basis.
There are increasing signs that
the United States and British gov
ernments will soon protest vigor
ously to Russia.
The belief is strong that the Rus
sians would back down if the West
ern Allies spoke strongly enough
against what is called the Soviet
employment of human hunger and
misery as a weapon of political co
ercion.
