## 
### JACK BATY 
Louisiana State's Junie Hebert
displayed spectacular form during
yesterday's East - West Best Ball
Tourney to place himself firmly
among the top contenders for the
individual title in the NCAA cham
pionships which are being played
this week on the Farm course.
Hebert's 67 was the only sub-par
round fired during the exhibition
matches, and was four strokes bet
ter than a brace of par-shooters.
FOUR OF TIIE PLAYERS
evened par. although Art Wall of
Duke shot a sub-par 34 on the
first nine. In addition to Wall, Har
vie Ward of North Carolina, Bob
Abrahams of Northwestern. Fred
Wampler of Purdue, and Morgan
Fottrell of San Jose shot 71's.
The Bay Area's representatives
were few in number, but at least
three of them served notice that
Hebert isn't the only golfer to be
watched during the individual play.
STANFORD'S TOM LAM B I E
was one over par on the first nine,
but was even par for the seven
holes of the second nine that he had
to play. San Jose's Mo Fottrell
scored 36-35 for an even par round,
and Cal's Don Schwab was one
under par for the 14 holes he
played.
Last year's individual champion,
Michigan's Dave Barclay, had a
poor round yesterday.
The qualifying rounds today and
tomorrow will also be the deciding
rounds for the team championship,
won last year at Ann Arbor by
Louisiana State.
Louisiana State, with Hebert and
Joe Moore among their numbers, is
a good bet to win the title again.
