### FRED HANNUM 
Went out to i'ne golf course Sat
urday afternoon to see the material
entered in the NCAA golf meet.
Believe me, the brand of golf was
impressive. Every drive smashed
by these crack college golfers was
straight and far. In many places
on the Stanford course a short
drive can cause no end of trouble
in a ravine or gully.
The players showed control over
the balls by slicing or hooking as
the course demanded. The trees on
the fairways make natural ob
stacles that must he avoided. Tom
Lambie, Stanford's golfer who
knows the course well, made one
beautiful hook — clearing the
branches of a tree with room to
spare and gliding around to the
green.
(iIIKENS ARE TRICKY
The greens are difficult to gauge
for slope on the course here. The
visiting golfers are not yet accus
tomed to them, and many putts
were narrowly missed Saturday.
The greens are large, and give only
a slight indication of their roll.
Players have grown very cautious
of their putting.
Lambie was in good company
during the practice rounds. He was
joined by Harvie Ward of North
Carolina and Harold Spears of
Georgia. Both are top-flight golf
ers; Ward is favored to take the in
dividual crown. They casually
played the 18 holes while Lambie
pointed out a few valuable tricks
of the course. We're pulling for
Lambie to use his experience on

the home links to good advantage
in the team and individual compe
tition.

ROSBURG NOT ENTERED
Rumors have been floating
around campus about Bob Ros
burg's being unable to play in the
NCAA Golf Tournament. Bob was
dismissed from the golf team by a
vote of Stanford's coaches because
he did not support the team. A few
weeks ago Bob played in the morn
ing matches against San Jose State
College, but failed to show up for
the afternoon completion. He went
out of town for another tournament.
The San Jose match has always
been important to the Stanford
suad. Stanford won, but Rosburg
was noticeable by his absence. The
coaches felt that he did not give
the co-operative spirit necessary in
collegiate sports.

Carolina and Harold Spears of
Georgia. Both are top-flight golf
ers; Ward is favored to take the in
dividual crown. They casually
played the 18 holes while Lambie
pointed out a few valuable tricks
of the course. We're pulling for
Lambie to use his experience on

the home links to good advantage
in the team and individual compe

ROSBURG NOT ENTERED
Rumors have been floating
around campus about Bob Ros
burg's being unable to play in the
NCAA Golf Tournament. Bob was
dismissed from the golf team by a
vote of Stanford's coaches because
he did not support the team. A few
weeks ago Bob played in the morn
ing matches against San Jose State
College, but failed to show up for
the afternoon completion. He went
out of town for another tournament.
The San Jose match has always
been important to the Stanford
suad. Stanford won, but Rosburg
was noticeable by his absence. The
coaches felt that he did not give
the co-operative spirit necessary in
collegiate sports.
