## Housing Dilemma 
### 
To the Editor:
Perhaps you can clear up a few questions for me. I'm just an ordinary
student who's been taking his 15 units per quarter here at Stanford for
the last couple of years. I've run into a lot of funny deals—such as why
the Union Cellar charges the prices it does when it made $40,000 net
profit last year and why some of the empty spaces around the Quad aren't
turned into parking lots—but this summer housing is even stranger than
most Stanford procedures.
For instance, why is the first fioor of Toyon closed and the second
slory (which heats up well above 90 on hot days) left open for men
students? It seems to me that if one or the other floor had to be closed
during the summer the hothouse second floor would be the logical one.
Another case of strange reasoning. Why are a large number of the
women students exiled to Ventura when all the Row houses and some of
the Union Units are closed? They have to walk to Union three times a
day for their meals which probably works up somewhat of an appetite
foi the food but nevertheless does not seem very sensible. I don't think
the girls would really mind the distance though if:
J. The Administration furnished them with helicopters to dash back
and forth between room, meals, and classes, or
2. Each room were provided with ten-ln-one rations every week for
those who couldn't make it to Union, or
3. The Red Cross set up an emergency food kitchen on Ventura's front
lawn.
Incidentally, some of the Ventura women (the more rugged hikers)
say they don't mind the walk so much but they are getting a little tired
of radiators banging at 5 each morning when the heat is turned on. One
girl last week didn't hear the clanking, so didn't wake up to pull the
blankets oil her bed, and nearly died of a heat stroke.
1 love Stanford, but sometimes Inn left confused. Can't somebody
answer my questions? Or is it that
Ours is not to wonder why.
Curs is but to "Make all checks payable . . ."
