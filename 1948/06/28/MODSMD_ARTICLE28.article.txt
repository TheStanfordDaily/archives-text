## The
						President's Job 
### 
WASHINGTON. June 27 (UP).—What does the President of the United
States have to do?
Everyone knows he has a hard job. Just how hard it is, few voters
appreciate.
His working hours generally are 7 a.m. to midnight—except on nights
when he toils "late.' He lives in a goldfish bowl as far as his private as
well as public life is concerned. Secret service agents never let him out
of sight and his personal physician gives him twice daily—or oftener—
checkups.
The pressure never ceases. Visiters, mail, and problems pour in
without respite.
Merriman Smith. United Press White House correspondent, has un
dertaken "to show in human factors and in words of as few syllables as
possible how the intricate 2(Hb century presidency operates" in his new
book. "A President Is Many Men."
Avoiding the legalistic side of the story. Smith endeavors to highlight
and describe the office now sought so eagerly by a host of
"It is the story of the night President Jackson's guests ate nearly a ton
of iheese at the White House; how some of the most distinguished world
figures are not above stealing White House silver for souvenirs; the story
of what Thomas Jefferson called life in 'splendid misery'," Smith said in
a foreword to his book.
Back of the President moves an army of advisers, secretaries, ex
perts. "idea men," "insiders." anil workmen of all kinds.
Mainly by anecdote and allusion to the striking or bizarre historical
facts, Smith gives a lively picture of this army in action. Dozens of
anonymous but powerful figures are brought to the surface and the
author gently exposes their methods.
It's extremely hard for the President to amuse himself. A dance or
dinner party turns into a rigorously programmed affair at which he, his
wife, and family are apt to be prize exhibits, and in which they must
follow strictly formalized procedure. A trip finds his every mile recorded
in a special White House book, endless arrangements involved, and urgent
communications dogging him at every step.
The President is bound by tradition and rule in many, many ways.
He was not even allowed to help himself to a 'snack" out of the White
House ice-box under a rule that he must not touch anything but abso
lutely fresh food. Franklin D. Roosevelt finally shattered that obviously
antiquated rule.
The President has many things no millionaire could buy, to be sure.
His private plane and private railway car are far beyond any private indi
vidual's dreams. His prestige and power defy exact limitation. And his
wife can indulge herself in various ways, if she wishes: Mrs. Coolidge
drank two quarts of orange juice daily while she was in the White House.
In the round, however, the White House makes a poor sort of home.
Smith recounts as indicative of life there the story of "Sistie and "Buz
zie," the Roosevelt grandchildren, who once took some aluminum serving
trays to use as sleds because no one had remembered to them real ones.
