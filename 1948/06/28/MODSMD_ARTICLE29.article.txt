STANFORD INTERNATIONAL RELIEF ORGANIZATION needs help to pack and wrap packages for
overseas shipment to devastated areas of the world, such as Berlin (above).
Chairman Robert Klein asked that all those interested come to the SIRO shack on the west side of En
cina Commons on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 4 to 5. Klein may also be reached at l'O
liox 2488. Campus.
During last quarter, SIRO sent several thousand pounds of food and clothing overseas. Klein said he
hoped to match this summer quarter.
