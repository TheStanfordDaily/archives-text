C. Eurich announced Friday.
The collection includes more than
500 examples of Simonson's own
work and is supplemented by li

He is considered a pioneer in the
use of contrasting planes of light
j for stage design. Simonson's meth

|of an architect rather than a
painter.
Simonson was one of the original
directors of the Theater Guild in
New York, and since his retirement

mission, such as "Joan of Lorraine"
and"The Ring of the Niebelungen."
"The future of the student thea
