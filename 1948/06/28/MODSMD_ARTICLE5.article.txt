# Flames Smothered By Union Women
## 
### 
Quick action by Union women
saved the fire department what
might have been a real fire last
Thursday evening, Fire Chief Mar
ston said.
A fire, started by an over-heated
lamp, spread rapidly to lace cur
tains and a desk in the third-floor
room of Leda Rajgorodsky and
threatened to become a major con
flagration.
It was extinguished by a blanket
brought by Jeanne Lang, and was
merely smoldering when the fire
department arrived.
Damage, amounting to about
$100, was confined to the desk and
personal belongings in the room.
