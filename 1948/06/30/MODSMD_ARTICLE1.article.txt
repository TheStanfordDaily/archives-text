### JOHN TURNBLAD 
The Axe is back! Or, at least, it was Monday
and yesterday. The famed trophy of Cal-Stan
ford rivalry spent a few hours on the campus
under circumstances which were described as
"mysterious" by both UC and Stanford officials
and student body leaders.
THE HEAVY, BRIGHTLY-PAINTED Axe was
discovered late Monday afternoon near the Stan
ford golf course by Leonard A. Sagan, who was
registered here spring quarter. Sagan was rid
ing a horse down Searsville Road with his sister,
Terrye, and nine-year-old Larry Bacon when the
trio spotted the Axe, still mounted on its large
backboard, propped up against a tree.
The Axe was in plain sight about 15 feet off
the road, according to Sagan. It was still bright
and shiny and apparently had been placed there
only a short time before.
SAGAN HAILED A PASSING MOTORIST
who took the Axe to the Old Red Barn and from
there Sagan delivered the trophy to Chief of
Police Gordon Davis.
No one, either at UC or here, seemed to know
how the Axe got from its case in the Men's Club
room of the ASUC Union to the isolated section
of the Stanford campus. According to the Daily
Californian, the Axe was reported missing Mon
day afternoon by Richard J. Ditwells, a UC stu
dent.
Monday, Ditwells reported to University offi
cials that the Axe was gone. The top section of
its glass case had been broken and the trophy
removed, apparently by someone who had a
passkey to the Clubroom" according to the

Californian. AUC janitor declared he found the
broken glass Saturday, but no report of the theft
was made by him.
ASSU SUMMER PRESIDENT DON DAVIES
and Chief Davis returned the Axe to Cal yester
day after negotiations for a peaceful exchange
were made by Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton. Director of Activities Ed Welch.,
former ASUC student body president, received
the trophy for the Eastbay peasants.
The Stanford Axe has had a long and colorfu 1
history which has included riots, raids, smur
glings, and numerous thefts. According to tra
dition, the Axe was first brought down from the
i hills in 1896 to add visual emphasis to Stanford'..
famous Axe yell. During the 1899 Big Game i:
i San Francisco, it was stolen by Cal rooters anc
; smuggled onto the trans-bay ferry under a stu
dent's overcoat.
FROM THEN UNTIL 1930 the Axe was kept in
safe deposit vaults in a Berkeley bank. That
year, the famous "Immortal 21," posing as news
j paper reporters and photographers, recovered
the Axe in a surprise raid.
In 1933 the two schools decided to make the
Stanford Axe a permanent trophy of the Bi-
Game. Winners of the Game are inscribed c
the Axe plaque and the winning school kee-;
the trophy until it loses a Big Game.
The Axe was last stolen in April, 1946, whe
| a squad of alleged Cal students walked in
the Union one night, picked up the Axe, caz
â€¢ and all, and took off in a truck. It was not unt
I October of that year that the Axe was found c
a Palo Alto street.


FAMED STANFORD AXE, long-time symbol of Cal-Stanford rivalry,
which was stolen Sunday night and left on the Stanford golf course.
It has been returned to Cal.
