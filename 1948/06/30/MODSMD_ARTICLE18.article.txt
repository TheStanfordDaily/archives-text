# GENERAL STRIKE IN ITALY
## 
### 
ROME. June 27 (UP). â€” Italy's.
Communist-dominated Labor Fed
eration (CGIL) today called a half
day general strike for workers in
all sections of industry on July 2.
The strike call is the opening gun
in a new Communist offensive
whose twin goals are to increase
the wages of skilled industrial
workers and to harass Premier Al
cide de Gasperi's non-Communist
government.
