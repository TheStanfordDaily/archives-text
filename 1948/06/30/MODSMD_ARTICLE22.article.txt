SHOOTING THE FAIRWAYS
WITH THE NC2A GOLFERS: Com-
I petition is hot and heavy, as is al
j ways true, as the collegiate links
i men enter match play today for
j the long grind which will lead to
the naming of an individual match
champion sometime late Saturday
I afternoon.
It is a cinch that Dave Barclay,
! Michigan's defending titlist, will
have to do some strong shooting in
order to regain his 1947 crown. He
has not been up to snuff in the
early rounds, but his teammates
say it is because the good-looking
| Dave has been carrying a top
j heavy scholastic load this past
i year.
They are hoping he can hit his
peak toward the week's end,, and
i improve upon his first-round 73,
! two over par, which he carded on
| Monday. Even Barclay's peak may
not be good enough, however.
RIGHT NOW. the best prospects
| shape up in the personages of Jay
J Hebert, the Louisiana State lad,
1 who started off the actual play with
a smart 67, four under par, in Sun
day's East-West best ball exhibi
tion. and Fred Wampler, Big Nine
champ from Purdue, who also shot
a (58 in Monday's opening round of
fire.
Long and strong Art Wall from
[ Duke, who won the Sunday driving
exhibition with an average of 285
yards in three tries, try as he may.
cannot make those soaring drives
pay off. Monday, on the par four
twelfth hole, Wall teed off on a
; well-driven ball, at least 40 yards
better than anyone else had accom
plished that day on the same hole.
But Wall, who has difficulty on
the approach shots, had to be satis
fied with a five for the cup. Which
shows that the longest driver isn't
necessarily in the driver's seat, for
sure.
ANOTHER CHOIICE, dark-horse
at the moment, is husky Bo Win
ninger, of Oklahoma A&M, who

has turned in some steady golf in
the low seventies all week long.
Even though Bo has been sitting
behind just about every tree on the
course, he has amazing accuracy in
the "out of the rough" shots.
They were telling the story on
Monday, on the lucrative and re
freshing eighteenth hole, of one of
the collegiates who teed off onto
the sloping fairway in plain sight of
all. But when he went searching
for the little white pebble, it was
nowhere to be found.
TED PAYSEUR. chairman of the
NCAA golf committee, ruled a pen
alty shot, since the rules say if a
ball cannot be found, it is counted
as lost, regardless of where the
witnesses say it landed.

better than anyone else had accom

But Wall, who has difficulty on
the approach shots, had to be satis

shows that the longest driver isn't

ANOTHER CHOIICE, dark-horse

has turned in some steady golf in
the low seventies all week long.
Even though Bo has been sitting
behind just about every tree on the
course, he has amazing accuracy in
the "out of the rough" shots.
They were telling the story on
Monday, on the lucrative and re

the collegiates who teed off onto
the sloping fairway in plain sight of

for the little white pebble, it was
nowhere to be found.

ball cannot be found, it is counted
as lost, regardless of where the
witnesses say it landed.
SHOOTING THE FAIRWAYS
WITH THE NC2A GOLFERS: Com-
I petition is hot and heavy, as is al
j ways true, as the collegiate links
i men enter match play today for
j the long grind which will lead to
the naming of an individual match
champion sometime late Saturday
I afternoon.
It is a cinch that Dave Barclay,
! Michigan's defending titlist, will
have to do some strong shooting in
order to regain his 1947 crown. He
has not been up to snuff in the
early rounds, but his teammates
say it is because the good-looking
| Dave has been carrying a top
j heavy scholastic load this past
i year.
They are hoping he can hit his
peak toward the week's end,, and
i improve upon his first-round 73,
! two over par, which he carded on
| Monday. Even Barclay's peak may
not be good enough, however.
