## Sandy Head? 
### 
Up Berkeley way they are still chiding us about our attitude
toward what they call "academic freedom."
Their summer editor, who doubles in brass, is really hep to
the latest, whether it be music or politics. His first editorial was
made up almost entirely of quotes from one of The Daily's edi
torials of last quarter.
Up at Cal they just can't quite see why we have chosen to
understand and accept University policy regarding partisan po
litical groups on campus.
It seems they do not realize that a private university cannot
and need not lend its name to such partisan political activity.
They further refuse to acknowledge the fact that any and all
political groups have their representation in Palo Alto, barely
one mile from campus.
So they wind up by tagging the editorial, "Head in the Sand
Department." It could be that a "sandy head" is better for seeing
all the facts than one enveloped in Berkeley fog.
