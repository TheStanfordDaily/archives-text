# CAMPUS OPINION
## Sunday Movies 
### 
To the Editor: .
Perhaps you were present at the Sunday Movie last time. If not, at
least several hundred other students and their friends were. I think all of
them were, to say the least, sickened by the so-called "feature" attraction.
As I heard someone remark, "I don't know who is responsible, but
hanging is 100 good for him."
The same thing happened once before during the last year, and at the
time the manager of the Sunday Movies solemnly promised that it wouldn't
happen again.
Aren't the managers allowed to preview the films they present? If not.
they might find a better system of selection. Or is, maybe, their taste
such that they think we would applaud such galling trash?
It's true that twenty cents isn't much, but how many think last Sun
day's show was worth twenty cents?
