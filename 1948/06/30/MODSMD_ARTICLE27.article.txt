# Swimming Tool Fee
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Sometimes I think somebody around here is a little chintzy. Last
week I read in The Daily that next time I go to the Women's Pool for
a swim I must pay somebody 15 cents.
How come? Who gets that 15 cents? Where does it go? Is it being
put into a fund to buy a new diving board or to buy new water?
The least that could be done for the dehydrated students who sat
through a spring quarter with the muddy bottom of Lake Lagunita staring
at them would be to let them into the pool for maybe 10 cents.
808 CLAPP.
