Deal - Ma:
I'm not writing you because I'm short on money. I just want to tell
you all about Stanford in the summer, and also to thank you for that
swell Christmas present. Sorry I haven't written sooner.
There was a peachy keen all-campus dance Saturday night. All the
boys and a few girls were there.
I danced with one cute trick. First name was Aphrodite. Someone cut
in before she had a chance to get to her last name.
Sabu Hatband told me he danced with the girl who inspired Abe Bur
rows to write "The Girl with the Three Green Eyes."
Two fellows worked out a clever plot, the idea being that the two
would alternate cutting in on the same gal. The only trouble was that one
partner failed to cut in at the signaled time, and the other lad was left
holding the bag, so to speak.
Mother, I think that you expressed undue concern in your last letter
about my getting a job when I graduate in August. It's true that I haven't
made much of an effort to find any work, but I'm confident that some
corporation will be writing soon, offering me a junior executive's posi
tion at $6,500 per.
I've been sort of juggling around my program to get the maximum
units for the minimum amount of work. It's not that I don't like to study,
but the weather is too warm and Ihe beach is too close for good working
habits.
By the way. Mom. I'm short a few dollars, and if you can spare a few,
say fifty, I'd sure appreciate it.
Your loving son,
ART
