# Lambie Downs Bariteau, Enters 4th Round
## 
### JACK BATY 
Tom Lambie, Stanford's ace golf
er, survived 3G grueling holes yes
terday to emerge as one of the eight
shotmakers remaining from the G4
who started match play Wednes
day on the Farm course.
Lambie downed Ed Schalon of
Michigan, 3 and 2, in Wednesday's
match, and encountered little diffi
culty in disposing of Ohio State's
Alex Polli yesterday morning, 4
and 3.
The afternoon match was a dif
ferent story. Eli Bariteau of San
Jose's champion Spartans was
Lambie's third-round opponent.
Lambie won the first hole with
a birdie four, but bogied the third,
fourth, and fifth holes to go two
down. Bariteau blew in turn with
a double-bogie on the sixth hole,
but Lambie did the same on the
ninth, and the San Jose boy was

two up as they started the second
nine.
Lambie halved the tenth, birdied
the eleventh and fourteenth, and
parred the fifteenth to lead one up
i with three holes to go. On the par
five sixteenth, Bariteau showed
j why he is one of the West's most
promising amateurs. He was in the
gully short of the green on his sec
ond, but placed his third within
seven feet of the cup. Lambie had
the match in the bag until then, but
lost the hole in spite of a par. The
Farm golfer then won the 17th with
j a par, and halved the 18th to take
J the match.
Michigan's Dave Bareley, defend
ing champion, really had to work'
to get past his two matches yes
| terday. He took the full 18 holes
to down Palmer Lawrence of North
Texas State College, one up, in the
! morning round, and then took 22

holes to defeat Lawrence's team
mate, Gene Towry. The champion
finally pulled the second match
from the fire by downing a birdie
on the 370-yard, par four fourth
hole.
Smilin' Ed Hopkins, the lanky
Texan who won the driving con
test Sunday, advanced to the quar
ter - finals by edging the famed
Charlie Coe of Oklahoma Univer
sity, 3 and 2. Hopkins had earlier
defeated Ross Smith of San Jose
State, 4 and 3. By his win over Coe,
a pre-tournament favorite, Hopkins
becomes my favorite to win this
tourney.
Lou Stafford of Oregon, Publinx
finalist in 1947, won his morning
match from Bobby Garner of UC
LA. and then trounced Ed Draper
of Washington in the afternoon. 3
and 2. Stafford had a four-under
par 32 on the front nine.

Washington's Jim Mallory upset
Pete Elliott of Michigan, 2 and 1,
in the afternoon match after Elliott.
' ace quarterback and basketball
; player, set down Harvie Ward of
North Carolina in the morning, 3
and 2.
Spartan Bobby Harris defeated
Fletcher Wall, Duke tackle and
golf start, 3 and 2, in the morning
j and then met Stanford's Ernie Kell
berg in the afternoon. Kellberg had
j won his morning round from Wen
da! 1 Barnes of Louisiana State, one
up on the 19th hole. Kellbcrg's
i finish in the morning was the most
sensational of the tournament, for
the Stanford boy was four down
with four holes to go. But he ral
| lied to win the last four holes, and
then birdied the 19th for his well
earned victory.
Ted Richards from UCLA played
j beautiful, three-under-par golf to

trounce Joe Moore of Louisiana
State, 5-4.
One of the best stories in this
tournament will be Loddie Kem
pa's liking for birdies on the extra
holes. The Oklahoma A&M south
paw was the G3rd man to qualify
by virtue of a birdie on the 37th
hole, and yesterday morning he
defeated Bobby Crozier with an
other birdie on the 19th. But the
Oklahoma boy wasn't through, for
he had to face Denver's fearer!
Charlie "Babe"' Lind in the after
noon's third-round match.
Kempa won the 18th hole to
square the match, but he almo
blew it when he chose to hit Lind
ball, which had him stymied, insic.

ball. With the 19th hole coming uj".

Tom Lambie, Stanford's ace golf

Lambie downed Ed Schalon of
Michigan, 3 and 2, in Wednesday's

The afternoon match was a dif
ferent story. Eli Bariteau of San
Jose's champion Spartans was
Lambie's third-round opponent.
Lambie won the first hole with
a birdie four, but bogied the third,
fourth, and fifth holes to go two
down. Bariteau blew in turn with
a double-bogie on the sixth hole,
but Lambie did the same on the
ninth, and the San Jose boy was

two up as they started the second
nine.
Lambie halved the tenth, birdied
the eleventh and fourteenth, and
parred the fifteenth to lead one up
i with three holes to go. On the par
five sixteenth, Bariteau showed
j why he is one of the West's most
promising amateurs. He was in the
gully short of the green on his sec

seven feet of the cup. Lambie had
the match in the bag until then, but

J the match.

berg in the afternoon. Kellberg had
j won his morning round from Wen
da! 1 Barnes of Louisiana State, one
up on the 19th hole. Kellbcrg's
i finish in the morning was the most
sensational of the tournament, for
the Stanford boy was four down

| lied to win the last four holes, and
then birdied the 19th for his well
earned victory.
Ted Richards from UCLA played
j beautiful, three-under-par golf to

trounce Joe Moore of Louisiana
State, 5-4.
One of the best stories in this
tournament will be Loddie Kem
pa's liking for birdies on the extra
holes. The Oklahoma A&M south
paw was the G3rd man to qualify
by virtue of a birdie on the 37th
hole, and yesterday morning he
defeated Bobby Crozier with an
other birdie on the 19th. But the
Oklahoma boy wasn't through, for
he had to face Denver's fearer!
Charlie "Babe"' Lind in the after
noon's third-round match.
Kempa won the 18th hole to
square the match, but he almo
blew it when he chose to hit Lind
ball, which had him stymied, insic.
the six-inch stymie limit. He sue -
ceeded, but very nearly sank Lind'
ball. With the 19th hole coming uj".
the left-hander was again equal t
the situation, once again getting :
birdie four on the par five hole.
Tom Lambie, Stanford's ace golf
er, survived 3G grueling holes yes
terday to emerge as one of the eight
shotmakers remaining from the G4
who started match play Wednes
day on the Farm course.
Lambie downed Ed Schalon of
Michigan, 3 and 2, in Wednesday's
match, and encountered little diffi
culty in disposing of Ohio State's
Alex Polli yesterday morning, 4
and 3.
The afternoon match was a dif
ferent story. Eli Bariteau of San
Jose's champion Spartans was
Lambie's third-round opponent.
Lambie won the first hole with
a birdie four, but bogied the third,
fourth, and fifth holes to go two
down. Bariteau blew in turn with
a double-bogie on the sixth hole,
but Lambie did the same on the
ninth, and the San Jose boy was

two up as they started the second
nine.
Lambie halved the tenth, birdied
the eleventh and fourteenth, and
parred the fifteenth to lead one up
i with three holes to go. On the par
five sixteenth, Bariteau showed
j why he is one of the West's most
promising amateurs. He was in the
gully short of the green on his sec
ond, but placed his third within
seven feet of the cup. Lambie had
the match in the bag until then, but
lost the hole in spite of a par. The
Farm golfer then won the 17th with
j a par, and halved the 18th to take
J the match.
Michigan's Dave Bareley, defend
ing champion, really had to work'
to get past his two matches yes
| terday. He took the full 18 holes
to down Palmer Lawrence of North
Texas State College, one up, in the
! morning round, and then took 22

holes to defeat Lawrence's team
mate, Gene Towry. The champion
finally pulled the second match
from the fire by downing a birdie
on the 370-yard, par four fourth
hole.
Smilin' Ed Hopkins, the lanky
Texan who won the driving con
test Sunday, advanced to the quar
ter - finals by edging the famed
Charlie Coe of Oklahoma Univer
sity, 3 and 2. Hopkins had earlier
defeated Ross Smith of San Jose
State, 4 and 3. By his win over Coe,
a pre-tournament favorite, Hopkins
becomes my favorite to win this
tourney.
