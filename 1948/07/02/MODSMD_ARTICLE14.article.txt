# Vets Who Quit To Refund Tuition
## 
### 
Any veteran who drops out of
school or college before the end of
the period for which tuition has
been paid must refund the tuition
that the VA must pay for the time
he did not attend or lost the train
ing time covered by these pay
ments.
Affected are all veterans enrolled
under the GI Bill in institutions
that:
1. Collect their tuition and other
charges in advance, and
2. Limit refunds of tuition
charges that can be made to any
student discontinuing his work be
fore the end of the term or semes
ter.
The VA ruling, announced this
week, holds the veteran legally re
sponsible for tuition payments the
Veterans Administration must make
to these school for the instruction
periods the veteran does not at
tend.
