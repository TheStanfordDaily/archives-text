"Just to get away from the drudgery of books for a while," two
Stanford students have decided to make parachute jumps from an alti
tude of 4,000 feet tomorrow.
The two Farm daredevils are Bill "Bugsie" Sigal and Ben Brundred.
Neither has made a 'chute jump before.
Sigal and Brundred have rented two parachutes and will go aloft
in a Stinson plane from Palo Alto Airport tomorrow afternoon. The
plane will he piloted by Sigal's younger brother, Hank. The two hope
to land in a clearing near Searsville Lake.
In explaining why they are making the jump, these two self-made
paratroopers said they "have wanted to do it for a long time and this
seemed like a good time to do it."
Flying in space is nothing novel to Sigal. lie is one of the best
jumpers 011 the Stanford ski team. Brundred is an outstanding athlete
in the intramural loop.
For their earthward descent, the hoys will carry a camera and their
life insurance policies. Sigal will also he toting a Chesterfield sign, as
he is the local Mr. A.B.C. this summer.
