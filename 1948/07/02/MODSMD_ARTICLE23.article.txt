## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 1 (UP).—
President Truman said today that
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was accept
able to him for the Democratic
Vice - Presidential nomination, but
she quickly threw cold water on
the idea.
Radiating confidence in his po
litical future at his first news con
ference since his Western campaign
tour, the President also told re
porters:
He will not quit his candidacy for
the Presidential nomination but will
win it on the first ballot of the
Democratic national convention and
beat the Dewey-Warren Republi
can ticket in November.
He still doesn't take seriously the
opposition of Southern Democrats,
some of whom have served notice

they will support Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower for the Presidential
nomination.
OTII E R TRUMAN supporters
said -privately, however, that they
were quite concerned over the
draft - Eisenhower movement. One
of them said it would be a "serious"
threat to Mr. Truman's nomination
unless the retired general says "no"
again before the convention meets
in Philadelphia July 12.
Mr. Truman was led into the dis
cussion of Mrs. Roosevelt for Vice-
President through questioning of a
reporter. The idea was suggested
in a recent newspaper column by
Clare Booth Luce, former Republi
can Congresswoman from Connec
ticut. It never was taken up seri
ously by Democratic leaders.
When the President said he had
n't seen the column, the reporter
asked: "Would Mrs. Roßsevelt be
acceptable on the ticket with you?'


MRS. FRANKLIN I). ROOSE
VELT yesterday said she had
no intention of running on the
Democratic ticket for Vice-
President. President Truman
earlier had declared "she would
he acceptable to me."
