SCARCELY NOTICED BY JHK
NCAA OOLFERS: Lou Stafford's
140 qualifying round, only a stroke
behind the 139 posted by co-medal
ists Morgan Fottrell and Gardner
Dickinson. Stafford, Oregon hot
shot. actually broke the old NCAA
medalist record. . . .
Ted Payseur's prediction on Mon
day that a score of 155 would be
the qualifying mark late Tuesday
night. As it turned out. 155 on the
nose was the mark at or below
which the 64 qualifiers entered
match play rounds. . . .
Indian Bob Crozier's first-round
match victory over Warren Mc-
Carty, San Jose, on the 19th hole
with a birdie four after McCarty
paired the 18th hole to even up
the match. . . .
Caddie Dave Davidson, Stanford
basketballer, who toted woods and
irons for Wendall Barnes of Loui
siana State during the qualifying
rounds early in the week. . . .
Course record of 63 made by Bud
Brownell, Card golfer, in 1941,
shattering par by eight strokes.
Brownell, who was killed in World
War 11, did it with eight birdies
and 10 pars. . . .
Pete Elliott's early one-up vic
tory over Ross Collins, North Texas
State, after his ball had been stop
ped by a tree behind the 18th
green. The Michigan footballer's
little white pebble, hitting a limb,
bounced backward onto the green,
giving him the match with a one
putt. . . .
THERE IS GREAT concern this
morning over who will become the
individual match champion to fol
low in the footsteps of Dave Bar
clay. Michigan; George Hamer,
Georgia; and Howard Baker, Ohio
State, the last three winners.
As the collegiates enter the semi
final rounds today, it is a cinch it

will not be one of the following
spectators:
Ernie Nevers, former Stanford
All - American fullback, who has
dabbled in golf,
Dink Templcton, ex - Card boy
coach, who turned out a host ot
Olympic and American track and
field champions.
Jack Shoup, editor of the Stan
ford Alumni Review.
Kevin O'Shea, Notre Dame bas
ketball star, formerly of San Fran
cisco's St. Ignatius High School.
Vic Kelly, UCLA golf coach and
Bruin athletic director.
