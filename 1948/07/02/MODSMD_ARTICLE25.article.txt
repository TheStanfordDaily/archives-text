### 
PRINCETON. N.J.. July 1 (UP). i
—Yale, Harvard, and the West Side ,
Rowing Club of Buffalo, N.Y..
earned berths in the semi-finals of
the Olympic rowing trials today by
victories in "second-chance" heats !
over the placid waters of Lake Car- i
negie. j
The victory by the West Side ;
club was the most surprising in the
trials so far, as Ihe New Yorkers
led all the way to whip the Univer
sity of Wisconsin by a half-length.
Harvard's varsity cidit covered I
the distance in 6:35 to beat Navy s
middies by one and three-quarters
lengths. The more powerful Crim
son crew took fewer strokes per j
minute but won handily.
Yale turned in the best time of
the day, (5:18, in heating MIT by ;
two lengths. MIT stroked at a ,
steady 32 all the way but was never j
in front as Yale held ;i one-length j
margin at the midway point.
All times today were far below
the winning times yesterday and
the new course record of 5:50.4 set
by Cornell yesterday.
The lineups for the semi-final I
heats tomorrow: first heat—Prince- j
ton. Yale, and West Side Club: sec- j
ond heat — Cornell and Harvard: j
third heat — Washington and Cali- j
fornia. The three winners will i
meet in the finals on Saturday.
