# See You Tuesday?
## 
### 
This afternoon and tomorrow a great number of us will be
leaving for an assortment of vacation spots all over the state.
Most of us will be a part of the record-breaking amount of
traffic expected over the three-day holiday.
Statistics show that an overwhelming percentage of accidents
occurs when the driver is:
1. A student under 25 years of age.
2. Traveling at an excessive rate of speed.
3. Under the influence of alcohol.
All of us stand a good chance of gualifying on at least two
cf the three counts. We are students, and our time is limited—
classes start again Tuesday morning. This is our one holiday
this summier; we're all inclined to celebrate it.
Last year's Fourth of July holiday resulted in over 800 cas
ualties —more than 20 of which were deaths. Two Stanford stu
dents were killed last summer in driving accidents. Let's not
repeat this year.
Jam-packed highways necessitate more than the usual amount
of caution on the part of the driver. Time saved by taking chances
and driving too fast is not worth the risk of loss of life.
We're all supposedly intelligent—let's drive as if we were,
and we'll all be back on campus Tuesday.—D. K.
