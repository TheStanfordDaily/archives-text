## Bull Session 
### 
Down in whiskey flats section of Bayshore Highway, business is
rotten the.'r . You could walk into a bar almost any week night, fire
a cannon, ill no one.
One bar sold for $125,000 two years ago is now going begging at
$22,500.
Where.' 1 time whiskey shots were gulped down in quick order,
beer is no\ d slowly.
Anoth that once kept three barkeeps hopping, now is managed
by one p bartender.
The ot a a saloon owner was telling me his troubles. He's low
ered the [rinks; he advertises in every Peninsula paper; and he
passes ou ldwiches.
"Aboi ily thing left," he told me, "is for activity to perk up
at Model -<~ for the shipyards to start hiring more workers."
After at him with sudden amazement, he was quick to add,
"Shouldr '.ntry be prepared? How do we know what the Russians
are goitv Preparedness hurts no one. If a little more business
cc-mes m veil . .
So- i. e to make a quick dollar driving this country into an
armament o?
If this / whisky peddler is so anxious to get a "little activity.
I can in. >w the airplane manufacturers and munitions makers
feel.
And tl ocs for the Russian commissar who sees perpet tion
of his pc ranglehold by screaming about an imperialist United
States th y be put down by armed warfare.
Before cs of the world buy a slick package of goods that looks
.foolproof, nd workable, they ought to take a look around, and
see if tht other path that might lead to world peace.
We cer n't want this apparently sure-tire b; .o: jods to back
fire into ai rumbling that would blow our Bay shore v: tender and
JRussian. po to smashing bits.
