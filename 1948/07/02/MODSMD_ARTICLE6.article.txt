# Vets Will Get Additional Pay
## 
### 
Veterans receiving subsistence
checks through Public Law 346 will
receive a $15 supplement for the
month of June.
Originally, subsistence was slat
ed to end June 9. Veterans were
given 15 days' "leave pay" unless
they requested that payments be
stopped on June 9. Payments were
made through June 24 to the
amount of $60.
A new award has been author
ized to students attending summer
quarter. Its terms provide that
payments include the entire month
of June.
Supplementary checks will prob
ably be mailed late in July.
Summer subsistence will end
Aug. 25 unless veterans ask that
leave pay be withheld.
All veterans must re - register
with the Veterans Administration
at the beginning of fall quarter.
