BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 1 (UP). —Yugo-
slav Communists called their Bulgarian com
rades liars today. The army, the Communist
party, and the public rallied to the support of
Marshal Tito in his battle with the Communist
Information Bureau, ♦

Borba, newspaper organ of the
Communist party, published a blis
tering attack on the Bulgarian
party for supporting the Cominform
against Tito.
It warned that the Tito regime
was not going to be changed in the
way Marxists of other Cominform
countries desired and added:
"Instead of immersing themselves
in unprincipled lies, Bulgarian
leaders should consider whether
theri present attitude toward the
Yugoslav Communist party will
have positive or negative effects on
friendship between the Bulgarian
and Yugoslav peoples."
The crack First Proletarian Divi
sion of the army, which Tito formed
in 1942 to fight the Germans, elect
ed him its chief delegate to the July
21 Yugoslav Communist party con
ference as ' a manifestation of his
great popularity in the army."
Most of Yugoslavia's key leaders
were trained in the First Division.
IN BELGRADE the townspeople
showed their faith in their coun
try's future by jamming banks to
buy bonds of the new 3.500.000,000-
dinar ($70,000,000) state loan for
Tito's five - year plan of develop
ment.
Subscription lists for the loan
opened at midnight. Crowds lined
up then at the banks and the spe
cial bond counters in headquarters
of Tito's coalition national front,
and buying continued throughout
the night. Announcement that the
lists had been closed because the
loan already had been over-sub
scribed was expected at any hour.
Reports of manifestations of loy
alty to Tito came from all parts of
the country.
When Tito made his first public
appearance yesterday after his re
turn to the capital, crowds gathered
everywhere he stopped to cheer
him and to chant over and over,
"Tito! Party"
AS AN INDICATION of the ap
parently complete unity of the
Communist party in Tito's support,

convention:
"All party conferences and all
their messages show that strong
unity and unlimited confidence are
manifested for the leadership of the
army and party, together with the

party for supporting the Cominform
against Tito.
It warned that the Tito regime
was not going to be changed in the
way Marxists of other Cominform
countries desired and added:
"Instead of immersing themselves
in unprincipled lies, Bulgarian
leaders should consider whether
theri present attitude toward the
Yugoslav Communist party will
have positive or negative effects on
friendship between the Bulgarian
and Yugoslav peoples."
The crack First Proletarian Divi
sion of the army, which Tito formed
in 1942 to fight the Germans, elect
ed him its chief delegate to the July
21 Yugoslav Communist party con
ference as ' a manifestation of his
great popularity in the army."
Most of Yugoslavia's key leaders
were trained in the First Division.

buy bonds of the new 3.500.000,000-
dinar ($70,000,000) state loan for
Tito's five - year plan of develop

Subscription lists for the loan
opened at midnight. Crowds lined
up then at the banks and the spe
cial bond counters in headquarters
of Tito's coalition national front,
and buying continued throughout
the night. Announcement that the
lists had been closed because the
loan already had been over-sub
scribed was expected at any hour.
Reports of manifestations of loy
alty to Tito came from all parts of
the country.
When Tito made his first public
appearance yesterday after his re

everywhere he stopped to cheer
him and to chant over and over,
"Tito! Party"

parently complete unity of the
Communist party in Tito's support,

election of delegates to the party
convention:
"All party conferences and all
their messages show that strong
unity and unlimited confidence are
manifested for the leadership of the
army and party, together with the
greatest gratitude and love for
Marshal Tito."
