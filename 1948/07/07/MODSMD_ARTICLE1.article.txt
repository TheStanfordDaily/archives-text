# Ike's 'No' Slows Dem. Rebellion
## Truman Confident; Prepares for Fight 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 6 (UP). —Democratic National Chairman
J. Howard McGrath appealed to all Democrats today to close
ranks behind President Truman after Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
all but wrecked the stop-Truman drive by again saying "no" to
draft-Ike campaigners.
But die-hard dump-Truman leaders in New Jersey, California,

Georgia. Alabama, Virginia. Illinois,
Florida. South Carolina, and Texas
refused to take Eisenhower's word
as final.
THEY INSISTED they would
push their plans to draft him, and
that when the chips were down he
would consent to run.
President Truman, however, is
"confident" that he himself will get
the nomination and is prepared to
give the Republicans "one hell of
a fight."
JAMES ROOSEVELT. California
state Democratic chairman and a
leader of the draft-Ike movement,
re-issued a call for a 19-state stop-
Truman caucus to take place in
Philadelphia Saturday.
"Gen. Eisenhower's statement
clearly indicated that he will not
serve as a partisan President but
will answer a call from the caucus,"
Roosevelt wired co-sponsors of the
caucus.
SEN. CLAUDE PEPPER, D„ Fla.,
proposed that the Democrats draft
Eisenhower to head a "national
coalition cabinet" to meet the dan
ger of war which might break out
"at any moment."
He also said that Florida would
nominate Eisenhower if the Colum
bia University president had not
already been nominated when
Florida was reached in the roll call
of 48 states.
Other anti-Trumanites were try
ing to switch the Eisenhower boom
to Supreme Court Justice William
O. Douglas. But some Southerners
who were most fervently for the
general said former New Dealer
Douglas wouldn't fill the biiT
