First Longbarn Dinner this quar
ter, for free, of course, goes to a
rather mysterious gent—C.S.R. of
the Biology department.
I think we should reciprocate.
We're both rather empty of late.
Your jingles are spare.
My cupboard is bare —
Our meeting was scheduled by fate.
To decrease the space in The Space
I submit something worse in its
place.
From a literate phoney—
Some poetic baloney—
To take the blank look off your
face.
Though Willie has left you de
serted,
Starvation can still be averted.
Don't look so forlorn—
Fill up on this corn —
So that I may be dined and des
serted. —C.S.R.

And don't forget, at
