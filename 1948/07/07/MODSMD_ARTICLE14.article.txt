# Medical Research Fellowship Presented by Delta Gammas
## 
### 
Stanford Delta Gammas have
presented the University with $41,-
000 for a fellowship in ophthalmol
ogy. Acting President Alvin C. Eu
rich announced yesterday.
The gift, representing proceeds of
the sale of the sorority house in
1944, was voted by alumnae of the
Upsilon chapter in a poll taken late
last year.
The fellowship will make pos
sible important eye research, a field
in which the Stanford Medical
School has long made important
contributions, Dr. Eurich stated.
Further praise of the gift, which
fits into a national Delta Gamma
alumnae project for the care and
prevention of blindness, came from
Paul C. Edwards, president of the
Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity.
"In addition to what the gift will
accomplish in terms of medical re
search, the fund represents a fine

: and understanding spirit on the
part of a significant group of the
University's alumni," Mr. Edwards
said. "This excellent spirit makes
the generous gift doubly welcome."
The presentation of the check by
Mrs. David Packard, president of
the Stanford Delta Gamma Asso
ciation, followed approval by the
Superior Court of Santa Clara
County of the dissolution of the as
sociation as a corporation.
Other provisions of the dissolu
tion included the presentation of
$5,000 to the new chapter of Delta
I Gamma at San Jose State College
and a contribution to the building
fund of the Palo Alto Society for
! the Blind.
