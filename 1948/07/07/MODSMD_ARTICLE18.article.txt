# Papa Blocks Para-Capers

### JOE LIPPER 
Papa exercised the veto power
and the Farm's would-be para
troopers failed to make their
Fourth of July jumps.
Last week, Bill "Bugsie" Sigal
and Ben Brundred, both Stanford
students, made arrangements to
rent a plane and parachutes so they
could fulfill their lifelong ambition
to make parachute jumps. Neither
had jumped before.
On Friday of last week, the Stan
ford Daily printed a story of their
intended feat. The story was re
printed by the Palo Alto Times and
several other newspapers.
Sigal's father, who is a resident
of Palo Alto, first learned of his
son's plans from the Paly paper.
He immediately sought out Bug
sie and Bugsie's brother Hank, who
was to pilot the plane, and vetoed
the whole thing.
As a result, the Sigal brothers
and Brundred all spent the na
tional holiday with their respective
brdgans on terra firma.
