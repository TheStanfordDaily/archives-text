# IIR to Conduct Student Tours.
## 
### 
The lIR is making plans to con
duct tours for foreign students this
summer. These trips are intended
to introduce foreign students to
parts of California with which they
are not acquainted and it is hoped
that the trips will broaden the stu
dents' knowledge of the United
States.
A successful tour of a chemical
plant in San Jose was organized
during spring quarter. Plans have
been made to organize a trip to
Big Basin this month.
At present the lIR is faced with
a transportation problem and would
welcome offers from interested stu
dent with cars. More frequent
trips could be organized if a car
pool could be established. Those
interested in accompanying the for
eign students are asked to call at
the lIR office between 1 and 5 in
the afternoon or to drop a note in
PO Box 1485.
