LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 6 (UP). —The United Nations Secu
rity Council today scheduled an emergency meeting for tomor
row morning to draft an urgent appeal to the Israeli and Arab
governments to extend the four-week Palestine truce which ends
Friday.
The Council called the session in response to a plea from UN

112 mediator Count Folke Bernadotte.
In a cable to the UN, Bernadotte
asked the Council "to urgently ap
peal to the interested parties to ac
cept the prolongation of the truce
for such period as may be decided
upon in consultation with the me
! diator."
Bernadotte's appeal to the Coun
cil to apply pressure upon the
Jews and Arabs to refrain from
renewing their bloody war came
after both sides had rejected his
| first outline for a permanent peace
j in the Holy Land.
The United States, United King

for immediate discussion of the
| mediator's appeal at today's Coun-
I cil meeting but ran into Soviet and
j Syrian objections.
Russia's Andrei Gromyko, in an
attack upon Bernadotte for "going
| beyond his powers" in his peace
' plan, said that the question of a
; truce extension could not be sepa
j rated from the mediator's other
, proposals and he demanded more
| time to study the problem.
