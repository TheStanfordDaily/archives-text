## Hounds of Summer 
### 
Every summer the number of dogs and hounds on campus
seems to increase. They come barreling down the sidewalks,
across the lawns, and into the Cellar Snack Bar area.
At about 10 every morning that area looks more like inter
mission at a dog show than a coffee stand. These well-meaning
hounds have such voracious appetites that you are indeed for
tunate if you can manage to push down a doughnut and pour
down a cup of black before these eager animals beat you to it.
Another annoying aspect of the situation is that these crea- 1
tares usually manage to either start a fight or make love about
the time you are sitting down for a peaceful cigarette.
Amittedly the situation isn't of earth-shaking seriousness,
but it is the petty annoyances that bother the most.
Why can't those faculty members and students who own
dogs keep a little closer watch on them? Why must the non
dogloving members of the University be bothered by these
friendly beasts?
First it was the bees, now it's dogs. The Snack Bar can do
without both.
