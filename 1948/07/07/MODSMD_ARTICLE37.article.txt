## Croup I Grammar 
### 
To the Editor:
May we publicly suggest that the Administration correct the grammar
on at least part of the card which it sends out to tell students whether or
not they have passed the College Aptitude Test and are fit to enroll in
Stanford?
Certainly, occasional members of Group I will be able to spot the
disagreement in number between subject and predicate in the portion
which applies to them: j
"Group I —About 9 in every 10 students do satisfactory college work
and approximately I out of 3 achieve superior scholarship."
