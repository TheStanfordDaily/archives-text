## History 1948 
### 
More even than the President's message on the State of the Union last
January, the hearings that were held before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee began reveal the forces which will determine the Presi
dential election this November.
The Republican party, whose latest President went out of office in !
1933, has a real opportunity this year to win the White House and enlarge
its majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. After fifteen
years it might seem a wholesome thing that such a change should take
place.
But why have the Republicans been out of power so long? Obviously,
because they did not appear to the voters to offer a constructive alterna
tive to Democratic policies. Their Congressional victory in 1946 suggested
a swingback not entirely due to the loss of F.D.R.'s magnetic personality.
In 1946 there was a real restlessness among the voters. But much has hap
pened in the past two years, and the question to be determined is whether |
the Republican record will be good enough to command or justify over
whelming popular support.
The test, I believe, will come—indeed, has already come—in the field
of foreign policy. In this field F.D.R. spoke and acted vigorously. He
made mistakes, plenty of then, a fact which even the most ardent and
zealous Democratic party supporters cannot deny: but I believe he repre
sented the highest aspirations of his countrymen.
Mr. Truman, thrown unprepared into the world's most exacting office,
has grown in stature. His own words and those of Secretary Marshall
commit us to build democracy into a lasting structure of world peace.
There is nothing partisan in this attempt. There is nothing in it that
is inconsistent with the Republicanism of Theodore Roosevelt—or of Abe
Lincoln.
There are, indeed, Republican spokesmen —Senator Vandenberg out
standing among them—who support its essentials as staunchly as any
Democrat. No reason exists, in history or tradition, why vigorous, far
seeing, and liberal Republicanism should not justify and earn a transfer
of power next November.
We do not have a liberal party and a conservative party. We have two '
parties in which those two elements are mixed, in either of which the j
progressive spirit can show itself and historically has shown itself. Gov- I
ernors Dewey and Warren, the Republican standard-bearers for 1948, es
pecially Warren, can add the progressiveness to the G.O.P. which has so
sadly been lacking in the past.
The Repub icans now have their chance to produce a leadership that
will embody (his spirit—the deepest ar.d most Listing tiling Ln the political
Jife of this democracy.

ernors Dewey and Warren, the Republican standard-bearers for 1948, es
pecially Warren, can add the progressiveness to the G.O.P. which has so
sadly been lacking in the past.
The Repub icans now have their chance to produce a leadership that
will embody (his spirit—the deepest ar.d most Listing tiling Ln the political
Jife of this democracy.
More even than the President's message on the State of the Union last
January, the hearings that were held before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee began reveal the forces which will determine the Presi
dential election this November.
The Republican party, whose latest President went out of office in !
1933, has a real opportunity this year to win the White House and enlarge
its majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. After fifteen
years it might seem a wholesome thing that such a change should take
place.
But why have the Republicans been out of power so long? Obviously,
because they did not appear to the voters to offer a constructive alterna
tive to Democratic policies. Their Congressional victory in 1946 suggested
a swingback not entirely due to the loss of F.D.R.'s magnetic personality.
In 1946 there was a real restlessness among the voters. But much has hap
pened in the past two years, and the question to be determined is whether |
the Republican record will be good enough to command or justify over
whelming popular support.
The test, I believe, will come—indeed, has already come—in the field
of foreign policy. In this field F.D.R. spoke and acted vigorously. He
made mistakes, plenty of then, a fact which even the most ardent and
zealous Democratic party supporters cannot deny: but I believe he repre
sented the highest aspirations of his countrymen.
Mr. Truman, thrown unprepared into the world's most exacting office,
has grown in stature. His own words and those of Secretary Marshall
commit us to build democracy into a lasting structure of world peace.
There is nothing partisan in this attempt. There is nothing in it that
is inconsistent with the Republicanism of Theodore Roosevelt—or of Abe
Lincoln.
There are, indeed, Republican spokesmen —Senator Vandenberg out
standing among them—who support its essentials as staunchly as any
Democrat. No reason exists, in history or tradition, why vigorous, far
seeing, and liberal Republicanism should not justify and earn a transfer
of power next November.
We do not have a liberal party and a conservative party. We have two '
parties in which those two elements are mixed, in either of which the j
progressive spirit can show itself and historically has shown itself. Gov- I
