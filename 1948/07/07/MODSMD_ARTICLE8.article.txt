## 
### 
Courses of avocational and recre
i aitonal nature have been eliminated
i under the G1 Bill, Ihe Veterans
i Administration stated last week.
Under the Supplemental Inde
! pendent Offices Appropriation Act.
1949, no part of the appropriation
may be used to pay for any such
courses started after June 30, 1948. |
Flight training and relative avia
tion courses that a veteran is tak
ing in connection with his present
or contemplated business or oceu
| pation shall not be considered avo
| cational or recreational. Veterans
i presently enrolled in all courses af- !
fected by the new law will be per- j
mitted to complete their training. |
Training determined by the VA :
to be avocational or recreational i
includes certain courses in dancing. I
photography, glider, bar tending
and mixology, personality develop- I
ment, entertainment, instrumental 1
and vocal music, public speaking,
sports, and athletics. Also any sin
gle courses which are not a part j
of a general educational or train
ing program leading to an educa
tional or re-employment objective
are affected by this law.
If a veteran wants training in any
of the courses considered avoca
tional or recreational in character,
he must submit to the VA Regional
Office complete justification that
the course he wants is in connec
tion with his present or contem
plated business or occupation.
