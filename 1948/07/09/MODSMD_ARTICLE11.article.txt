## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UP) â€”
All threat of a national railroad
strike was removed today when a
settlement was reached in the 18-
month-old railway wage dispute.
The agreement calls for a 15V2~
cent-an-hour wage increase for the
three unions affected, retroactive to
Nov. 1, and some rule changes that
will mean additional pay. The rule
changes will date from last Jan. 1.
Announcement of the settlement
was made by White House Press
Secretary Charles G. Ross after a
three-hour conference between rep
resentatives of the unions, the car
riers and Presidential Assistant John
R. Steelman.
