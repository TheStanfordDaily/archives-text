# Toyon Open Dance Featured Tonight
## 
### 
Toyon Hall will give an all
campus open house tonight from 9
to 1, announced Baird Smith, Toyon
social chairman.
"Since Toyon is only half full we
will not be able to present such
name bands as Tex Beneke and
David Rose, but we do promise
these favorites on records," Smith
stated.
The music and food are free and
the whole campus is invited to come
and join the fun, he continued.
"We cannot reproduce the deco
rations and show of winter quarter's
Doubloon Ball, but the affair still
promises to be one of the main so
cial events of the quarter," Smith
said.
Come over to Toyon, dance to fine
music, and see the results of the
renovation of the hall.
