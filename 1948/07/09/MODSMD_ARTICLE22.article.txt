# Students Golf Swim While Gridders Plan
## 
### 
While tlie summer-season spoils
of baseball, swimming, golf and
track are grabbing all the headlines
these days, the football coaches of
the Pacific Coast are burying their
noggins in deep plans for the ensu
ing grid season.
At that, football isn't as far ofT as
most people realize. Practice starts
on Sopt. 1. for all conference
schools, and most of the teams have
games scheduled lor Sept. 18.
STANFORD OPENS I IKK TEN
game marathon on the above date
with a neighborly scrum against San
Jose State. Cal opens on the same
day with a contest against Santa
Clara.
According to the pigskin experts,
California and Oregon are the two
teams to watch, with Lynn Wal
dorf's Berkeley organization given
the top choice of participating in
Ncnv Year's Day festivities at Pasa
dena's Piose Bowl.
THERE'S NO QUESTION about
the Golden Bear forward wall.

Strong, sturdy and stout, the up
in-front gents have no peer in
league competition.
bp in the wild Northwest, Oregon
surprised the boys and girls with
a snappy football squad that got off
to a sputtering start, but roared
into home plate with six straight
wins.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, the two
Los Angeles grid machines, U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A., aren't rated in lop
contention, yet it's difficult to pass
over both schools. One or the other
is bound to do something.
Last season, UCLA looked like
the choice club, but internal dis
turbances frittered away the team's
chances. As for USC, perennials
like McCardle, Ferraro, Clark, et
al, have finally graduated, and Jeff
Cravath's hopes for two Rose Bowl
trips in a row don't seem well
founded.
STANFORD? Give Marehie
Schwartz another year for rebuild -
ing, and he'll be up there fighting
for top laurels.
The other schools--Washington,
WSC. Oregon State, Idaho and
Montana â€”appear slated for second
division duty.
