# Injured Gil Dodds Cannot Run Trials
## 
### 
BOSTON. July 8 (UP)â€”Gil Dodds,
the world's indoor mile king and
America's chief hope in the Olympic
1,500 meter event, automatically
eliminated himself as- a contender
today by withdrawing from the trials
at Evanston, 111., Saturday.
After a trial run at the Boston
College track, Dodds reported that
his strained leg tendon "hurt like a
toothache" and he didn't think he
could win a berth on the team in
his present condition.
