The announcements by Bob Ma
thias and Bill McColl that they plan
to enroll at Stanford means that this
school has grabbed what might be
the two outstanding prep athletes in
the nation.
Mathias—who recently won the
national decathlon championship—is
also an excellent football and basket
ball player. Playing for Tulare High,
he was the outstanding halfback in
his league, and in basketball, he
scored over 15 points per game.
McCOLL'S VERSATILITY, TOO,
will come in handy. A product of
Hoover High in San Diego, Bill was
picked by Arch Ward of the Chicago
Tribune as first string end on his
prep All-American team.
A rangy lad (6 feet 4 inches and
weighing 210), he played end, and
was equally brilliant both defensive
ly and offensively. In basketball, his
height was put to advantage at cen
ter. and he was a unanimous all
league choice for two years.
IN THE SPRING a young man's
fancy usually turns to romantic flit
terings, but the McColl lad turned
his attentions to baseball and track.
On the diamond, he pitched, played
the outfield, and hit over .400. And
in track, his efforts were devoted to
the hurdles.
McColl will enroll in September,
but Mathias will put in a year of
propping at Kiski School, Pennsyl
vania.
