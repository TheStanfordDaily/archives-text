To the Editor:
My Alma Mater is a little, two-bit college in Southern California
without the modern conveniences of a great university such as Stanford.
It has no Cellar or cafeteria where one can buy elegant food at rock
bottom prices. It has only a fountain where the best balanced meal
available is a 'burger and malt. There is no shoe repair shop, gas station,
or Hoover Tower. There have never been sororities and the frats are
strictly local. What, then, have I to complain about here? I'll tell you.
What student is there, be he a dull grad like myself or eager frosh, who
does not have an occasional free hour during the day when he wovdd
.seek relaxation. Now I know that some are quite satisfied to spend this
hour peering into a dead beer, or coke, depending on personal preference.
That, though, is not always "the pause that refreshes," high pressure
advertising to the contrary. Sometimes Leow's local satisfies, but that, too,
can be entertainment of a far too passive sort for a warm sunny afternoon.
The Associated Students at that backward little school, which I love so
dearly, but whose wordly goods, I have tried to show, are less grand
than those here at S.U.. had fine insight. They were able to see that
â€¢on, say, a Tuesday morning between the hour of dissecting a cadaver,
a vacuum tube, or an early American author, and the hour of eating
lunch, natural, youthful exuberance could be healthfully released if
there were provided, free of charge to all. a number of ping-pong tables
and a pool table in the Student Union. This they did. I dare not venture
liow many dollars were thus saved the college in broken street lights
and scribbled rest room walls, for as the bard would say, "Natural
exuberance will out."
You may put me on record as one who would like to see some small,
inexpensive changes made.
Very truly yours,
M. W. ST. CLAIR
