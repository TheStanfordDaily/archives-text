PARIS. July 8 (UP) â€”One of the few organizations in the United Na
tions which doesn't suffer from "iron curtain trouble" rs the group which
distributes food to the hungry children of Europe from headquarters here
in Paris.
Officials of the UN International Children's Emergency Fund travel
with ease across supposedly tightly closed frontiers. One day they may be
in Hungary, the next in Bulgaria, the day after that in the Soviet zone
of Austria.
ICEF's program of food distribution in Europe was started last No
vember. Since then it has distributed more than $20,000,000 worth of
milk, fats, and meat products to 12 European countries.
With the exception of France, Italy, and Greece, those countries are
in the so-called "iron curtain" zone. They include Albania. Ilulgaria.
Czechoslovakia. Finland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia.
"We have no political troubles because we cut across all political
barriers," an ICEF official told the United Press.
The ICEF sends inspectors to see that its food is distributed without
regard to race, creed, or political party. The recipient governments must
also publicize the United Nation's efforts.
"In the six months we have been operating in Europe, we have not
received a single complaint of maldistribution of food or attempts to credit
our efforts to a government or a political party," the official said.
Teams of ICEF workers, ranging from two to six people, work in
every one of the countries concerned. The governments themselves
pay an additional staff made up of its citizens.
. In return for milk, fats, and meat products from the ICEF, the re
ceiving countries contribute products of which they have enough, such
as grains.
The fund is able to distribute a supplementary 500 calories to some
4.000.000 European children. It estimates that as many as :>4).000.)HH) are
undernourished, but its budget cannot be spread further.
