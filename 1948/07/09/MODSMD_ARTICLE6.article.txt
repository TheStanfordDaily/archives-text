### 
LONDON, July 8 (UP â€” The
United States, Great Britain, and
France have offered to reopen talks
with the Russians on all questions
regarding Berlin if they lift the
blockade of that city at once, well
informed sources said tonight.
At the same time, a foreign office
spokesman disclosed that all repara
tions shipments to Russia from the
western zones of Germany had been
stopped.
The offer to talk over the entire
Berlin situation was contained in
the parallel notes which the three
j Western Allied powers sent Russia
J Tuesday, demanding that the block
! ade be ended.
It was a positive pi'oposal in notes
! which otherwise repeated the legal
| right of the Western Powers to share
in the occupation of Berlin, their
determination not to be forced out
by Soviet threats and the fact that
Berlin is an international zone, not
a part of the Russian zone of Ger
many.
