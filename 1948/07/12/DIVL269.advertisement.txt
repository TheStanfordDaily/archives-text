THE SPACE
A frequent contributor to our
files is the following lad. Wc quote
from his most recent communique,
"By the way, if you need Space
filler, print this (no dinner needed
for it!)
So, we're printing a Want Ad,
and, moreover, in addition, further
more, ademas, we're sending |. B.
II an invitation to dine at Long
barn.
WANT AD
Ration—4 to 1
Needed desperately—nice frosh
gal to keep old Injun . . . happy.
Dining, dancing, hiking, biking,
and so forth.
Inquiries invited— Box 1209,
Campus.
Hope it works. J. B.; if it doesn't,
keep trying, and if you think of
anything we might use in The
Space, sent it along to Willie at
LONGBARN
for another free dinner. Remem
ber: when the bell rings, it's on
the house. Remember also: 20 per
cent is 20 per cent, except Saturday
and Sunday, when it's zero per
cent.
