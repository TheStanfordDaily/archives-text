YOU'VE HEARD of Dink Tenrpleton, ex-Stanford track mentor, part
time Olympic Club coach, and present dissenter of Mel Patton's 9.3 100
yard dash. He also pooh-poohs ancient track and field theories when
ever he gets the chance.
The old idea that athletes reach their physical peak in their early
twenties suffered a killing blow in the Olympic tryouts Friday and Sat
ui day. Dink was always one who doubted it.
Blow number one came when Barney Ewell. 31. defeated USC's lithe
Mel Patton in the 100 meters in world record equalling time of 10.2
seconds. Ewell, who has run more races than Carter has pills, was con
sidered washed up early this year. Friday, in the twilight in Evanston's
Dyche Stadium, dusky Barney readied his physical peak.
ALTHOUGH PATTON, a truly great sprinter when lie wants to run,
gr.ined revenge in a 20.7 200 meters, Barney's victory was his best ever.
Then blow number two came along in the person of Jim Delaney,
Dink's own Olympic Clubber, who won the shot put at 55 feet. U4 inches,
a foot better than his previous best flip. Delaney, an ex Notre Dame
weighiman, is in his late twenties, and Dink says he is just now reaching
top form.
These two instances seem to put a clincher on Dink's case that athletes
are not washed up when they collect college sheepskins.
THERE HAS BEEN (and there is more to come) quite a kegful of
discussion over the failure of three "cinches" to become members of
America's Olympic track team.
Harrison Dillard. who qualified in the 100 meters, did not place in his
112« vorite 110 meter high hurdles. Neither did Charley Fonville in the
shot, nor Gil Dodds in the 1500 meters.
Dodds injured his heel and was forced out of the competition.
There is little doubt that the U. S. Olympic committee's ruling stands:
the U.S. team is picked exclusively from the tryouts held last weekend,
no ifs or buts.
For better or worse, the United States will not be represented by three
of the greatest athletes of this decade. Dodds. the nation's leading miler;
Dillard, 13.6 in the high sticks, and Fonville, 58 feet, 1 inch in the shot,
will watch from the sidelines.
There should be a law against it.

twenties suffered a killing blow in the Olympic tryouts Friday and Sat
ui day. Dink was always one who doubted it.
Blow number one came when Barney Ewell. 31. defeated USC's lithe
Mel Patton in the 100 meters in world record equalling time of 10.2
seconds. Ewell, who has run more races than Carter has pills, was con
sidered washed up early this year. Friday, in the twilight in Evanston's
Dyche Stadium, dusky Barney readied his physical peak.
ALTHOUGH PATTON, a truly great sprinter when lie wants to run,
gr.ined revenge in a 20.7 200 meters, Barney's victory was his best ever.
Then blow number two came along in the person of Jim Delaney,
Dink's own Olympic Clubber, who won the shot put at 55 feet. U4 inches,
a foot better than his previous best flip. Delaney, an ex Notre Dame
weighiman, is in his late twenties, and Dink says he is just now reaching
top form.
These two instances seem to put a clincher on Dink's case that athletes
are not washed up when they collect college sheepskins.
THERE HAS BEEN (and there is more to come) quite a kegful of
discussion over the failure of three "cinches" to become members of
America's Olympic track team.
Harrison Dillard. who qualified in the 100 meters, did not place in his
112« vorite 110 meter high hurdles. Neither did Charley Fonville in the
shot, nor Gil Dodds in the 1500 meters.
Dodds injured his heel and was forced out of the competition.
There is little doubt that the U. S. Olympic committee's ruling stands:
the U.S. team is picked exclusively from the tryouts held last weekend,
no ifs or buts.
For better or worse, the United States will not be represented by three
of the greatest athletes of this decade. Dodds. the nation's leading miler;
Dillard, 13.6 in the high sticks, and Fonville, 58 feet, 1 inch in the shot,
will watch from the sidelines.
There should be a law against it.
YOU'VE HEARD of Dink Tenrpleton, ex-Stanford track mentor, part
time Olympic Club coach, and present dissenter of Mel Patton's 9.3 100
yard dash. He also pooh-poohs ancient track and field theories when
ever he gets the chance.
The old idea that athletes reach their physical peak in their early
twenties suffered a killing blow in the Olympic tryouts Friday and Sat
ui day. Dink was always one who doubted it.
