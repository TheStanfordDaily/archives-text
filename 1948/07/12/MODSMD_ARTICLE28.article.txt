## Cooperation? 
### 
This week 400 California educators will meet here on
campus to discuss the topic "What Makes a Good Teacher." It
should not be a problem of concern for educators alone, but
students as well.
It might be a good idea to point out that neither group can
exist without the other. Educators cannot educate without stu
dents, and conversely students cannot learn without a basic
amount of guidance.
In that light it seems apparent to us that there should be a
great deal more cooperation between these mutually dependent
groups. That needed cooperation, however, is hardly discernable.
Most educators will tell us that their mission is to teach us
to think clearly and objectively, but those very same people will
attempt to justify university language reguirements by saying,
"Well, it has always been that way and it most probably always
will."
It is this same group that will often tell a group of students
that grades per se shouldn't be the student's first consideration,
yet it is this same group that places the high emphasis on grades
in all our classes—it surely does not originate with the students.
Quite possibly the contrary is also true. Perhaps the student
makes no sincere attempt to understand the educator and what
it is he seeks to accomplish.
What is apparent above all else is the fact that there is a
definite lack of cooperation between the two groups. Both realize
its necessity, but neither makes much of an attempt to secure it.
Just by way of suggestion, we wonder if a gathering of over
400 of the state's teachers shouldn't listen to what a few students
might have to say on "What Makes a Good Teacher."
It might easily give the educator a well rounded view of the
tooic —rather than a heavily one-sided one.—D.K.
