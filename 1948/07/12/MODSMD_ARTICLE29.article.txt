## History 1948 
### 
The President's Commission on Higher Education has prepared a
significant study that may bring about sweeping changes in the academic
world. Many of the suggestions proposed by the 28 prominent civic and
school leaders who comprised the commission are designed to modernize
the country's 1.700 colleges, universities, and professional schools.
The report proposes a general overhauling of college curriculums. It
also calls for federal aid for higher education. Here the commission urges
grtater support from the government in the form of scholarships, fellow-

ships. or outright grants. Not all college authorities
agree on this point. In fact, at recent academic confer
ences, the educators found themselves sharply divided
as to the wisdom of permitting the national government
to subsidize private institutions of learning.
Paralleling this proposal is the one seeking a
doubled college enrollment. It is the belief of the com
mission that we are not utilizing our best talent; too
many bright students never go beyond high school.
The commission believes that the 1(5 per cent of the
college-age population now on the campuses should
be doubled by 19G0.
Elsewhere in the report, colleges and universities

are warned against adopting a "do-nothing" policy in
the matter of training youth for world citizenship. They are asked to
provide greater opportunities for their students to practice democracy.
It is urged that economic, racial, and religious barriers be abolished and
that equal educational advantages be provided for all, regardless of race,
color, or creed.
These are worthy objectives, deserving of our considerate attention.
The distinguished commission members working on the problem of better
education have given us a document that cannot lightly be ignored. This
document was based on statistical surveys of colleges and universities
throughout the United States, on direct interviews with education leaders,
and on the end-results of known, proven facts.
I think we can and should echo the words of President Truman, who
observed, in accepting the study, that a strong program of education in
this country "will inevitably strengthen our nation and enrich the lives
of our citizens."
