## Where Is the 3.2? 
### 
To the Editor:
What ever happened to the proposal, first suggested by The Daily last
quarter, that 3.2 beer be served on campus. I was under the impression
that no state laws prohibited such sales; that only ASSU and University
rulings prevented heat-thirsty students from legally downing a brew
or two on campus these hot summer afternoons.
Have not said ASSU and University verbotens existed only because
"both organizations were under the misapprehension that state laws made
3.2 illegal? Has the Administration or the Board of Trustees ever seriously
looked into the matter? Or have they merely covered themselves more
completely with the moss of tradition? If it's a useful tradition, let's
keep it. But first let the Administration examine its utility and validity
in the light of present-day conditions. How about a word on this question
from the Administration—sometime before the present freshmai* class
graduates? EDWARD FARMINGTON
