# Sala Fails In Tank Finals
## 
### 
Ralph Sala. representing the Lodi
Athletic Club, lost out in the finals
of the Olympic 200-meter freestyle
trials held at Detroit over the
weekend. The Farm natator, how
ever, came the closest of all Indian
athletic representatives to making
the Olympic team.
Sala was considered a strong
possibility to make the London trek
as a member of the relay team,
since six men were chosen for the
journey. .
But, as so often happens, a dis
pute arose between the finish
judges and the timers. In such ar
guments, the decisions of the finish
judges are final, and Sala was
nudged to seventh place.
According to the timers, Sala's
time was clearly better than that of
the sixth-place man, Eugene Rog
ers of New York. All three judges
of seventh place chose Sala, al
though the timers had the local
boy in sixth place, a half-second
ahead of Rogers.
Thus Sala joined several other
Farm athletes in failing to make
the journey to London. Otis Chan
dler. Bill Larsen, Gay Bryan, Bud
Held, and Darrell Kretiz all failed
to make the track and field squad,
while the Weeden brothers and Don
Hester missed making the trip with
the swimmers.
