## The 						Forgotten Man 
### 
The program whereby Stanford's speech and drama depart
ment is permitted to hire artists in residence has enabled the
University to put on some first-rate dramatic productions.
In addition it has given students in the department an oppor
tunity to work with some fine professional performers. It has
made faculty members happy in that they are able to direct
some unusually capable artists.
One significant factor is left out of this otherwise pleasing
picture, however. How about the ordinary guy —the man who
came to Stanford not as an artist, but as a sincere and aspiring
student of the drama?
Does he have any opportunity at all to take part in Stanford's
major productions. We have an idea that with the artists in
residence in lead roles, and the junior artists in residence in
the supporting ones, the little guy is pretty much out of it.
Then there's still another danger. A university is run by
businessmen. With financial receipts from productions mount
ing, the temptation to put the department of speech and drama
on a business basis is pretty great.
That puts the little guy still further from his goal—taking
part in major productions at Stanford.
