## History 1948 
### 
Now that tlie orators on both sides of the United States-USSR contro
versy have exhausted their choicest epithets, the time has come for an
end to forensic oratory and the beginning of action to bring about a state
of dependable peace.
The speeches on both sides have been a rehash of the harangues of
antiquity. The same accusing and counter-accusing orations can Vie found,
substantially, in the Annals of Tacitus, written in A.D. 55. Preliminary to
every war. the leaders 011 both sides exhorted the populace in exactly the

same strain, using the same charges, claims of right
eousness, fears, and promises, always with the same
purpose— to urge their cohorts to kill and be killed for
the cause.
Out of the deluge of bitter words these faults stand
out. America accuses Russia of aggression and Russia
accuses America of aggression. Each claims to be on
the defensive against the other. The details of the in
dictments are not dwelt on. The public in America is
informed only of a blanket charge against the Russians
of territorial imperialism and ideological aggression in
favor of Communism. The Russian public is told that
we aspire to world control through our capitalist sys
tem. which they assert enslaves the users of other

people's money.
To avoid responsibility for the possibly tragic outcome of this exchange
of antagonisms each orator interpolates in every speech a reference to the
ability of both systems to co-operate. After which they proceed to accuse
each other of refusal to co-operate. Each also advances proposals which
do not envision protection for the other" and then accuses the other of
devilish stubbornness and refusal to co-operate.
A solution, peaceful or warlike, is imperative, and I appeal to the
world of sensible men to find it outside the field of battle—also outside the
field of forensic oratory. The world cannot function in this atmosphere
of uncertainty. If the Russians or the Americans want to be world masters
let them get down to fighting it out and be done with it.
If their purpose is to co-operate for world peace and prosperity let them
gel down to proposals clearly and unmistakably co-operative, friendly,
and protective of the interests of all concerned.
The United States was formed on the ideal of promoting general wel
fare. That ideal and practice have hold the states together in good will
and harmony. Let every proposal before two leaders, before nations, be
fore the UN henceforth be weighed not by whether it is aggressive or
defensive, not by what it will do for Communism or for Capitalism, but
by what it will do for the general world welfare. A binding program, not
a separating one, is needed.

by what it will do for the general world welfare. A binding program, not
a separating one, is needed.

Now that tlie orators on both sides of the United States-USSR contro
versy have exhausted their choicest epithets, the time has come for an
end to forensic oratory and the beginning of action to bring about a state
of dependable peace.
The speeches on both sides have been a rehash of the harangues of
antiquity. The same accusing and counter-accusing orations can Vie found,
substantially, in the Annals of Tacitus, written in A.D. 55. Preliminary to
every war. the leaders 011 both sides exhorted the populace in exactly the

same strain, using the same charges, claims of right
eousness, fears, and promises, always with the same
purpose— to urge their cohorts to kill and be killed for
the cause.
Out of the deluge of bitter words these faults stand
out. America accuses Russia of aggression and Russia
accuses America of aggression. Each claims to be on
the defensive against the other. The details of the in
dictments are not dwelt on. The public in America is
informed only of a blanket charge against the Russians
of territorial imperialism and ideological aggression in
favor of Communism. The Russian public is told that
we aspire to world control through our capitalist sys
tem. which they assert enslaves the users of other

people's money.
To avoid responsibility for the possibly tragic outcome of this exchange
of antagonisms each orator interpolates in every speech a reference to the
ability of both systems to co-operate. After which they proceed to accuse
each other of refusal to co-operate. Each also advances proposals which
do not envision protection for the other" and then accuses the other of
devilish stubbornness and refusal to co-operate.
A solution, peaceful or warlike, is imperative, and I appeal to the
world of sensible men to find it outside the field of battle—also outside the
field of forensic oratory. The world cannot function in this atmosphere
of uncertainty. If the Russians or the Americans want to be world masters
let them get down to fighting it out and be done with it.
If their purpose is to co-operate for world peace and prosperity let them
gel down to proposals clearly and unmistakably co-operative, friendly,
and protective of the interests of all concerned.
The United States was formed on the ideal of promoting general wel
fare. That ideal and practice have hold the states together in good will
and harmony. Let every proposal before two leaders, before nations, be
fore the UN henceforth be weighed not by whether it is aggressive or
defensive, not by what it will do for Communism or for Capitalism, but
by what it will do for the general world welfare. A binding program, not
a separating one, is needed.
