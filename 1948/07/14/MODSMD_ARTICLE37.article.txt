# Madrono Again Offers Farm 'Cup of Coffee'
## 
### 
Madrono will serve after-dinner
coffee to the campus tonight from
7 to 8. Everyone is invited.
''It's just an informal 'drop-in-on
your-way-to-the-libe 1 open house,"
Phyl Harvey, vice - president, ex
plains. "We're giving you a chance
to chat with your old friends, meet
some new ones, and enjoy a cup of
coffee in the meantime."
