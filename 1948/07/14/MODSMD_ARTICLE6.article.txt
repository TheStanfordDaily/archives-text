# Dem. Rebels On Truman Bandwagon
## 
### 
CONVENTION HALL. PHILA
DELPHIA. July 13 (UP). â€” The
anti - Truman rebellion inside the
Democratic party came apart at the
seams tonight, stirring party hopes
that a Truman - Barkley ticket
would be nominated, the civil rights
fight settled, and the convention
ended by tomorrow nighf.
PRESIDENT TRUMAN finally
agreed to take Sen. Alben W. Bark
ley of Kentucky as his Vice-Presi
dential running mate.
Barkley didn't jump at the offer,
but his acceptance was regarded as
almost certain.
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney of
Wyoming, Bark ley's closest con
tender for the number two job,
promptly dropped out of the race
and asked his backers to vote for
the Kentuckian.
SEN. CLAUDE PEPPER of Flor
ida was the next anti-Truman run
ner to drop out. He said he still
didn't like the Truman administra
tion but would support the con
vention choice.
His followers said Pepper didn't
want to be identified with the
threatened Southern bolt.
GOV. HEN LANEY of Arkansas,
the "token" Presidential candidate
put up by the Southerners in pro
test against President Truman's
stand on Negro rights, hinted he
may back down on his threat to
head a "Dixiecrat" fourth party in
November.
