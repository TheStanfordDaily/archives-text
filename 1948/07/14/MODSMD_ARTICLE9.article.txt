# Democrats Pledge Repeal Of Taft-Hartley Measure
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA July 13 (UP). — The Democratic convention
platform committee tonight approved a plank calling for repeal
cf the Taft-Hartley Labor Act.
An informed Democrat said an expected fight over the Taft-
Hartley issue failed to materialize.
But the same source said the group had still to tackle the issue

of racial rights which threatens to
split the convention. He predicted
the committee would be closeted
for several hours on the question.
Sen. Scott W. Lucas of Illinois
reported meantime the policy-draft
ers had approved unanimously a
plank calling on the United States
to lift its Palestine arms embargo
and asking the United Nations to
modify its arms control program.
The members of the committee
reportedly approved a plank calling
for a national minimum wage of
"at least" 75 cents an hour.
TIIEY ALSO AGREED to planks
pledging action to control the high
cost of living and to back up with
dollars the nation's promise to help
European recovery.
Former Gov. Chauncey Sparks of
Alabama served notice that the
Southerners would carry their fight
to the convention floor if they could
not get satisfaction from the com
mittee on a strong states rights
plank.
THE CONVENTION howled down
a Southern demand for a return to
the two-thirds voting rule for Pres
idential and Vice-Presidential nom
inations.
It approved continuation of the
rule requiring only a simple ma
jority of the total convention votes
to nominate the ticket. This con
formed with a majority report
of the convention's committee on
rules.
