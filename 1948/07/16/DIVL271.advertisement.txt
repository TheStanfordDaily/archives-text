Summer-time studying is as
stupid and frustrating as trying
to feed a raw oyster into a slot
machine. —C.O.P.
Comment: Well, who in hell
would want to anyway.
Raw oyster in a slot machine . . .
Fried—yes.
Maybe even a la Rockefeller.
But, not raw.
Speaking of oysters brings to
mind that in parts of China, sun
dried, salted grasshoppers are the
thing this year (as every year).
But, you won't find 'em at
LONCBARN
No grasshoppers allowed without
a student body card, and you know
what a student body card means—
20 per cent (except Saturdays and
Sundays>.
