Construction has started on Stern Hall, a new
residence hall for undergraduate men.
The hall, made possible by a gift from the estate
of Mrs. Louis Stern of Palo Alto, is expected to be
ready for occupancy by the summer of 1949.
Stern Hall will be made up <>112 two units. Each
unit will include two pavilions forming a right
angle and connected by covered pathways. There

will be a guest sitting room and a two-room student
sponsor's apartment in each pavilion. Two of the
pavilions will face on Escondido Road, one on Gal
vez Street, and the other on Arguello Street.
The two-story residence hall will be of con
temporary architecture, with buff-colored walls set
off by contrasting areas of slate grey.
