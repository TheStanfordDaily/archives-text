# Steinbeck Play Begins Run
## 
### DAILY DRAMA CRITIC THE STANFORD PLAYERS 
production of John Steinbeck's "Of
Mice and Men" opened at the Stu
dio Theater Wednesday night. It
was a memorable production from
the point of view of direction, act
ing, and staging.
The earthy ranch hands of Stein
beck's novel have been handled
with all the affectionate care the
.iuthor originally gave them. They
are rough, obscene, and eternally
lonely, but above all, they are real
istic. For this reason alone, the
play is certainly worth seeing.
THE FOUR SETS, devised by O.
G. Brockett, are a wonder of econ
omy and seem to embrace much of
the Salinas Valley. Director Jules
Irving, in this limited acting area,
was able to achieve a remarkably I
natural stage movement.
DICK EGAN and Ken Jones per
formed the roles of Lennie and j
George and almost seemed to live |
their parts, so realistic were their ;
performances. Egan's performance.;
particularly, seemed almost profes- j
■iional in its stature. Jones, too,

gave the character of George just
the right combination of poetry and
cynicism.
Of course, Lennie and George
aren't the whole show, by any
means, ohn Steinbeck has written
a theme and variation which de
mands a well-balanced, integrated
team of actors. The entire cast dis
played excellent teamwork all
through last night's performance.
PAUL lIOSTETLFR and Asher
Wilson were outstanding as the
likeable Slim and the unconsciously
crude Carlson. Harold Todd did a
fine job of portraying the hopelessly
senile Candy. Jules Irving as Cur
ley. Ralph McCormic as The Boss,
Robert WyckofT as Crooks, and
Harry Muheim as Whit rounded
out the cast.
The ro!e of Curly's wife, played
by Priscilla Pointer, is probably the
most controversial in the play. It
is made difficult by some obvious
writing on the part of the author
and some misconceptions on the
and some misconceptions on the
part of the author as to how a tart
should act. Mis-S pointer succeeded

in bringing out much of the bash
colorfulness and poignancy of the
character. Her final scene, particu
larly, is brilliantly executed.
THE HOUSE is completely sold
out for remaining performances of

played excellent teamwork all
through last night's performance.
PAUL lIOSTETLFR and Asher
Wilson were outstanding as the
likeable Slim and the unconsciously
crude Carlson. Harold Todd did a
fine job of portraying the hopelessly
senile Candy. Jules Irving as Cur
ley. Ralph McCormic as The Boss,
Robert WyckofT as Crooks, and
Harry Muheim as Whit rounded
out the cast.
The ro!e of Curly's wife, played
by Priscilla Pointer, is probably the
most controversial in the play. It
is made difficult by some obvious
writing on the part of the author
and some misconceptions on the
and some misconceptions on the
part of the author as to how a tart
should act. Mis-S pointer succeeded

in bringing out much of the bash
colorfulness and poignancy of the
character. Her final scene, particu
larly, is brilliantly executed.

tonight and tomorrow.—A. G.
production of John Steinbeck's "Of
Mice and Men" opened at the Stu
dio Theater Wednesday night. It
was a memorable production from
the point of view of direction, act
ing, and staging.
The earthy ranch hands of Stein
beck's novel have been handled
with all the affectionate care the
.iuthor originally gave them. They
are rough, obscene, and eternally
lonely, but above all, they are real
istic. For this reason alone, the
play is certainly worth seeing.
THE FOUR SETS, devised by O.
G. Brockett, are a wonder of econ
omy and seem to embrace much of
the Salinas Valley. Director Jules
Irving, in this limited acting area,
was able to achieve a remarkably I
natural stage movement.
DICK EGAN and Ken Jones per
formed the roles of Lennie and j
George and almost seemed to live |
their parts, so realistic were their ;
performances. Egan's performance.;
particularly, seemed almost profes- j
■iional in its stature. Jones, too,

gave the character of George just
the right combination of poetry and
cynicism.
Of course, Lennie and George
aren't the whole show, by any
means, ohn Steinbeck has written
a theme and variation which de
mands a well-balanced, integrated
team of actors. The entire cast dis
played excellent teamwork all
through last night's performance.
