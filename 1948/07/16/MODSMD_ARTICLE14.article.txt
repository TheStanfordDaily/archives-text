# Truman Calls Congress Into Session on July 26
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 15—i UP).—President Truman today
formally summoned the 80th Congress into special session be
i ginning July 26 amid Republican charges that the move was
"cheap politics," unnecessary, and no good could come of it.
The President promised the lawmakers a special message

when they reconvene, just five
weeks and one day after that weary
Sunday morning of June 20 when
they thought they had quit for the
election campaign.
He did not say what would be in
the message. But it will unques
tionably back up his renewed de
mand for legislation to curb high
prices, ease the housing shortage,
and further other phases of his so
cial welfare and civil rights pro
gram.
THE BITTERNESS of the Re
publican reaction indicated the 80th
Congress may reconvene in the
worst partisan strife the nation has
known since it was plunged into
World War 11.
There were grave doubts that
much could be accomplished under
such conditions.
The Democrats generally hailed
the President's move. Many of
them considered it a bold political
strategy designed to put the Re
publicans on the spot.
And even some Republicans ad
mitted privately that the President
"seems to have us over a barrel."
PRESIDENT TRUMAN mean
time put in motion the machinery
for getting Congress back to work.
He issued a formal call for the
special session, saying the '"public
interest" and an "extraordinary oc
casion" require it. He set the hour
for noon, July 26.
Senate President Arthur H. Van
denberg of Michigan, Republican
foreign policy leader, denounced
the President's move as "the last
hysterical gasp of an expiring ad
ministration.''
