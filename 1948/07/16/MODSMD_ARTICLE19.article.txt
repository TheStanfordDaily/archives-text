# TRACK AND FIELD
## Indians Come Home With Two National Champions 
### 
Although lacking in Olympic competitors, a group of Stan
ford Indian tracksters returned home this week with two na
tional champions among them.
After spending a month long tour of duty in the Midwest in
quest of berths on the United States Olympic team, Coach Jack

Weiershauser and his band of Car
dinals brought home some measure
of the bacon.
They returned with Bud Held,
national collegiate javelin cham
pion, and Gay Bryan, national AAU
hop, step and jump titlist, two of
the brightest luminaries in recent
Stanford athletic history.
ALTHOUGH NEITHER qualified
lor a place on the Olympic team in
Evanston, 111,, last week, they have
definitely established themselves as
leading contenders in future na
tional competition.
Weiershauser said Bryan, a jun
ior, came the closest of the four
eligible Stanford men to making

he Olympic team. He said Bryan
fouled two tries in the hop. step
and jump event which were close
lo 48 feet, a mark which would
have been good enough to make the
squad.
THE YOUTHFUL Card mentor
said he thought Held's javelin vic
tory in the National Collegiate
meet was one of the most thrilling
he has ever seen in any event. The
sophomore sensation qualified at
fourth place in the Friday trial
rounds amid driving rain.
During the three final throws.
Weiershauser said Held jumped
rom last to first place and back
again to third.
"On his last throw, he hit 210
i'cct and won the event, the coach
exclaimed, "which showed he real-
Is could throw when the chips were
down."
HE SAID he was surprised at
shotputter Otis Chandler's failure
to place on the team. Three days
before the Olympic tryouts. Chan
dler hit his all-time best of 54 feet
2 inches, and Weiershauser said he
thought the sophomore weightman
was ready for a startling perform
ance.
