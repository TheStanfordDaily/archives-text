CHUCK TAYLOR, intramural di
rector, announced Monday that
there were not enough entrants to
warrant holding a golf tournament
this summer. He's right, for the list
of those wanting to play was very
small.
But here's a suggestion: I've
spent a lot of time at the golf
course this quarter, first during the
NCAA tournament and lately in a
rather futile attempt to polish up
my own game, and I've noticed that
there are a considerable number of
Farm co-eds on the course every
day.
GOLFING WOMEN are, unlike
most women sports enthusiasts,
pretty good looking, and, aware of
the constant screaming that goes on
in shower rooms and beer halls
about "the lousy ratio," the thought
has occurred to me that maybe
some of the gin's would like to join
tournament.
If any of The Daily's devout
readers like this idea. 1 wouid sug
gest that they drop me a line c/o
the sports desk or to the Alpha Sig
house. Just let me know what your
average is, and what days you can
play go!f, and 1 11 take care of the
rest.
FOR THOSE of you that like
watching good golf, I highly recom
mend the Stanford Invitational
tournament which starts today. In
the past leading amateurs from all
over the coast region have partici
pated, and this year will be no ex
ception.
Would-be golfers who are finding
that their game lacks several es
sentials will profit from a careful
perusal of Ben Hogan's new book.
