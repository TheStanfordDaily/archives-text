## Question Period 
### 
There seems to be a reluctance on the part of Farm instruc
tors to answer questions of fact with a "Yes," "No," or "I don't
know."
Simple questions become complex and confusing in this
way. Sometimes the instructor quotes from the published work
of an eminent authority. About the time the students have it
neatly recorded in their notes, he informs them that the work has
been discredited by more recent scholarship.
This not only causes unnecessary cramp, but leaves
the student disillusioned in general.
When a student asks a question, it generally means that he
is in a quandary. It indicates that the text is not clear on the
specific point that is bothering the student.
Then why make the situation worse by an involved answer—
an answer in which Fhe instructor gives not only the background,
but an evolution of the answer?
We are sure that this practice is not done with any but the
most conscientious motives, but we do know that it is a source
of confusion.
Question periods are for clarification of confused points, and
perhaps greater attention to short, clear answers will result in
better instruction.
