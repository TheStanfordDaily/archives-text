## Bull Session 
### 
My feet are hurting me, three term papers are due, I'm behind a mil
lion pages in reading assignments, and the Editor says to write a column.
Write a colum about what? Maybe I could steal something from an
old edition. But there aren't any old editions to be found. After rum
maging through The Daily Shack, all I've been able to find are two
empty beer bottles and the corpse of an old editor.
And now Sabu Hatband is giving me a few tips. ' Pretend you're a
high-priced columnist," Sabu says, "put yourself in Herb Caen's boots,
or Drew Pearson's, or even Walter Winchell's. Write a column like
these men would if they were at Stanford.
"If Herb Caen were writing Bull Session, he'd probably get real gossipy
and tell about the two frosh students in 1947 who met at a jolly-up, and
three days later had to inform housing authorities that one more married
couple needed living facilities at the Village.
"Or do like Drew Pearson, and make a long-range prediction based
on 'inside information.' Drew would undoubtedly print the item that a
former governor of Minnesota whose initials are H.E.S., has an excellent
chance of being offered the presidency of Stanford.
"You could even give your column the Walter Winchell touch, and
rattle off some copy about Stanford sassiety, or about that lousy movie
yo i saw last night. What a sinema!
"Don't forget about Bill Leiser of the Chronicle Sporting Green. If Bill
had to do a column, he'd surely say that Stanford athletics are on the
up-grade, and that in a few years this school will be right at the top
once more.
"When such outstandings prepsters as George Gentry, nationally-ranking
junior tennis star; Dave Horn, quarterback standout at Santa Monica
High; Harold Bugbee and Bill Bradley, a pair of :09.7 sprinters; Bill
McColl. all-round threat from San Diego; and Bob Mathias, national
decathlon champ, have all decided to enter Stanford, how can this
school miss?
"You see. Levinson, writing a column is as easy as getting sick on
Cellar coffee. It's just your approach and attitude."
But I repeat: My feet are hurting worse than ever, and I could no
more write a column today than understand what Professor Fagan was
talking about in class the other day.

Value of a Stanford diploma department: George Smith, a Redondo
Beach ruffian, writes northward that a haggard-looking young gent called
at his home the other day, and pleaded with the Smiths to buy a water
softener unit. It seems that the salesman graduated from Stanford in
December, 1947, and six months later was still trying for his second sale,

Chance to make a fortune department: Open a drive-in church in
Los Angeles. Tremendi possibilities.

Travel note: Dick Bower, former Daily Bull Sessioner —one ox the best
cve r—and a Helms Foundation winner as Best Horsepicker for the month
of May, reports that he will be traveling south soon for the Del Mar meet.
Dick can't afford to stay away, so he said as he borrowed a nickel from me
yesterday.
