# Construction Begins On New Law School
## Remodeled Ad Building New Home for Lawyers 
### 
Stanford will start work immediately on the reconstruction of
the present Administration Building into a new home for the
Law School.
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, acting president, announced today that
the contract for the $780,000 job, which will take about 18 months

to complete, has been awarded to
Wagner & Martinez, San Francisco
construction firm. The new school's
built-in furnishings will cost an ad
ditional $110,000.
The 46 - year - old Administration
Building will be turned into what
Law School Dean Carl B. Spaeth
describes as "one of the finest
physical plants for law instruction
in the country."
The new Law School building will
have three floors, with mezzanine
levels above the first and second
floors. Facilities will include large
lecture halls and classrooms, a moot
court room, an enlarged law library,
faculty offices, rooms for consulta
tion and graduate research. Law Re
view quarters, and reading rooms.
A student lounge and student
locker rooms will occupy the base
ment level, where there will also be
storage space, a receiving, shipping
and mimeograph room, and a vault.
THE MOOT COURT will duplicate
a real court, with judge's bench, wit
ness chair, jury box, counsel tables,
and spectators' seats.
Stanford alumni and friends, under
the Law School plan, have contrib
uted approximately $200,000 during
*he past two years to help finance the
school's new building.
The school at present is located in
three adjoining buildings on the In
ner Quad.
The remodeling work will force a
widespread reshuffling of the Uni
versity's administration offices, which
will be located at various places on
the campus until new and permanent

quarters can be established.
TEMPORARILY the business and
accounting offices will be placed in
the basement and first floor of a wing
of Encina Hall. The Dean of Stu
dents' offices will be largely centered
in temporary building adjoining the
University library.
The remodeling of the Administra
tion Building is the major step in a
large - scale building program at
Stanford. This program includes con
struction of new residence halls and
modernization of buildings on the
Quadrangle, which forms the aca
demic heart of the University.
Stanford's need for additional stu
dent residences has been aggravated
by the heavy increase in enrollment
in recent years. Under this phase of
the program, Crothers Hall, law stu
dent dormitory, is nearing comple
tion, and Stern Hall, which will
house 240 undergraduate students,
is under construction.
TWO SCHOOL OF Mineral Sci
ences buildings are being remodeled
and modernized under the Univer
sity's long - range plans calling for
rehabilitation of the original Quad
buildings to make better and more
efficient use of available space.
Other phases of the University's
program to bring its physical plant
into efficient operating condition in
clude a 5150.000 three-year construc
tion project to modernize its over
loaded electrical system, and instal
lation—at a cost of $93,000—0f the
first link of a new steam distribution
system.

THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING (center) which is being re
modeled into the new Law School starting immediately.
Stanford will start work immediately on the reconstruction of
the present Administration Building into a new home for the
Law School.
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, acting president, announced today that
the contract for the $780,000 job, which will take about 18 months

to complete, has been awarded to
Wagner & Martinez, San Francisco
construction firm. The new school's
built-in furnishings will cost an ad
ditional $110,000.
The 46 - year - old Administration
Building will be turned into what
Law School Dean Carl B. Spaeth
describes as "one of the finest
physical plants for law instruction
in the country."
The new Law School building will
have three floors, with mezzanine
levels above the first and second
floors. Facilities will include large
lecture halls and classrooms, a moot
court room, an enlarged law library,
faculty offices, rooms for consulta
tion and graduate research. Law Re
view quarters, and reading rooms.
A student lounge and student
locker rooms will occupy the base
ment level, where there will also be
storage space, a receiving, shipping
and mimeograph room, and a vault.
THE MOOT COURT will duplicate
a real court, with judge's bench, wit
ness chair, jury box, counsel tables,
and spectators' seats.
Stanford alumni and friends, under
the Law School plan, have contrib
uted approximately $200,000 during
*he past two years to help finance the
school's new building.
The school at present is located in
three adjoining buildings on the In
ner Quad.
The remodeling work will force a
widespread reshuffling of the Uni
versity's administration offices, which
will be located at various places on
the campus until new and permanent

quarters can be established.
TEMPORARILY the business and
accounting offices will be placed in
the basement and first floor of a wing
of Encina Hall. The Dean of Stu
dents' offices will be largely centered
in temporary building adjoining the
University library.
The remodeling of the Administra
tion Building is the major step in a
large - scale building program at
Stanford. This program includes con
struction of new residence halls and
modernization of buildings on the
Quadrangle, which forms the aca
demic heart of the University.
Stanford's need for additional stu
dent residences has been aggravated
by the heavy increase in enrollment
in recent years. Under this phase of
the program, Crothers Hall, law stu
dent dormitory, is nearing comple
tion, and Stern Hall, which will
house 240 undergraduate students,
is under construction.
