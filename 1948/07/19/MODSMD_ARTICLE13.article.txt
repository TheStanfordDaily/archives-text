# Army Honors Terman For War Research
## 
### 
Dr. Frederick E. Terman. Dean of
the School of Engineering, will be
one of two scientists to receive the
Medal for Merit at the Presidio at
11 Wednesday morning.
The Medal for Merit is the nation's
highest award for civilians and was
first issued by Congress as a "reward
for services in a position of respon
sibility. honorably and well per
formed."
The presentation will be made by
General Mark W. Clark to Dr. Ter
man and Dr. Raymond H. Ewell, of
the California Institute of Research
at Oakland.
DR. TERMAN, son of the late Prof.
Lewis W. Terman of IQ fame, is one
of the world's most distinguished
radio engineers. He graduated as
top man of his class at Stanford in
1920 and two years later received his
Electrical Engineer degree.
He also holds a D.Sc. degree from
MIT, and in 1945 Harvard conferred
upon him the honorary degree of
Doctor of Science "in recognition of
his leadership in war research."
Dr. Terman served during the
war as the director of the Radio Re
search Laboratory at Cambridge,
Mass. He was instrumental in de
veloping the idea for aluminum foil
strips and the jammers which con
fused enemy radar and resulted in
the saving of an untold number of
lives.
DR. RAYMOND H. EWELL, now
senior technologist with Shell Oil
Company, Inc., worked during the
war to develop incendiary weapons
such as jellied gasoline and the flame
thrower.
The award the two scientists will
receive stems from the "Badge for
Military Merit," which was estab
lished by George Washington in 1782.
In 1942, Congress authorized the
award for merit "to civilians only."
