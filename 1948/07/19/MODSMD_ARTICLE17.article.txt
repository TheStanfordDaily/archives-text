# Vets: Insurance Deadline July 31
## 
### 
In order to afford veterans with
lapsed National Service Life Insur
ance every opportunity for reinstat
ing prior to the July 31 deadline,
the Veterans Administration yester
day announced that all its offices will
remain open July 31 to render extra
service to these veterans.
Prior to Aug. 1, veterans with
lapsed term insurance have the priv
ilege of reinstating any amount, from
$1,000 to $10,000. by certifying that
their health is as good as when the
policy lapsed. They need pay only
two monthly premiums.
After July 31, those veterans
whose insurance has been lapsed
three months or more will have to
pass a physical examination to qual
ify for reinstatement, according to
Robert P. Shields, San Francisco re
gional VA manager.
