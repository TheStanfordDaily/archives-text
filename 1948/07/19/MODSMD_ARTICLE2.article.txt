# U.S. Asks Force to Break Berlin Blockade; Jews, Arabs Order Armies to Cease Fire
## British, French Support Sought For Armored Convoys to Capital 
### 
FRANKFURT, Germany, July 19—(UP)—The
United States has asked Great Britain and France
to join in a plan to smash through the Russian
blockade of Berlin by force if necessary, high
allied sources said today.
Great Britain already as agreed tentatively to

the plan, informants said, and>
French support will be asked at a
meeting in Berlin tomorrow of the
commanders in chief of the three
Western occupation zones.
Provided France agrees, it is un
derstood that the plan will be:
1. The three Western powers |
would send a new joint note to j
Russia asserting that they are de- j
termined to fulfill their obligation
to supply their sectors of Berlin.
2. Then Russian occupation au
thorities in Berlin would be noti
fied in advance of the route and
schedules of armored convoys de
tailed to "drive through the 105 1
miles from the British zonal border I
to Berlin by railroad or highway.
Informants said that United Na- !
tions observers might be asked to j
accompany the convoys.
This would bring the Berlin cri- [
sis to a showdown. It would put j
it up to the Russians to decide |
whether to impose their blockade j
of Berlin "by force of arms and run j
the risk of war that would entail. |
British Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin is expected to outline the !
U.S. plan secretly at a meeting of \
the foreign ministers of Britain, j
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, I
and Luxembourg at The Hague,
Holland, tomoiTow.
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, Gen. Sir
Brian Robertson, and Gen. Pierre j
Koenig, the American, British, and
French commanders in chief, are j
to discuss the plan at a meeting in
Berlin tomorrow.
The Russians, in their first at
tempt to force the Western Allies
out of Berlin, closed all surface
traffic routes to the city from the
west on the ground that "technical j
difficulties" made it necessary.
For that reason, it is presumed J
that if the Allies do send armed j
convoys through, technical crews |
to repair roads, bridges, and rail i
lines may be included.
