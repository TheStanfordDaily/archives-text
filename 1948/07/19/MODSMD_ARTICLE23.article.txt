The story of Bob Mathias, 17-year-old national decathlon champion,
unfolds as quite an amazing piece of sports copy, or better yet, like a
fable from Grimm's fairy tales.
HOBBY. A YEAR AGO, was first recognized as a high school athlete
of some repute, when he consistently ran 14.5 and 14.6 in the 120-yard
high hurdles. As his performances in other events became known (he was
a .discus thrower, shotputter, sprinter besides), his name caught bigger
type in headlines.
When he won both the high and low barrier events in the state high
school meet in May, some insiders began to think even more highly of
him.
lIE SAYS lIIS DECISION to take a whack at the decathlon trials in
Los Angeles last month was merely because he "wanted to do some more
running after school was out." It is a good thing, this athlete's urge to
keep in shape.
A decathlon, we intend to explain, is a toughy. It consists of ten events
in two days, something which any sane track specialist would pass up.
even if he could get by with one throw, one jump, and one start in each
event.
Here is approximately what Bobby is capable of in the ten events:
high hurdles, 14.6; 100 meeters, 11.1; 400 meters, 51; 1,500 meters, 4:40;
discus, 148 feet; shot (1(5 lb.), 44 feet; pole vault, 12 feet; broad jump,
21 feet 6 inches; javelin, 175 feet; high jump, 6 feet 1 inch.
Thus, after but one try at the ordeal, Mathias became the U.S. champion
and chief Olympic representative, over a bright field of opposition, in
cluding Moon Mondschein of NYU. two months ago described as "without
a peer" in the event.
He is truly one of America's greatest athletes of this or any other
dccade, and of all schools, Stanford is the one for him.
All because he wanted "to do some more running." It's yours, Mr.
Ripley.
