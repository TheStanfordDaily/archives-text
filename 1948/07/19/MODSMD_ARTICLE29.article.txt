SIRO clothing packages for Europe are one of our most direct
and practical contributions toward world peace and understand
ing. Through SIRO collections, you and I have a real oppor
tunity to help the homeless and destitute of Europe.
The Stanford International Relief Organization has made it
easy for us to co-operate in this work. They have placed boxes
for used clothing in most living groups. These collection boxes
should be maintained not only during the special drives, but at
all times.
If there isn't a box in your living group now, why don't you
provide one?
With the outcome of the Berlin controversy still undecided,
and with the constant threats to peace that seem t?> occur every
day, we must take the rehabilitation of European peoples with
increased seriousness.
Now would be a good time to contribute those pieces of win
ter clothing that you won't be wearing next winter. It will give
SIRO workers plenty of time to have them cleaned, packed, and
shipped.
By giving a sweater, shirt, or some other piece of clothing,
you will be helping a really worthwhile organization do its job.
