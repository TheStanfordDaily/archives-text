I go for Cellar food in a big way. The only trouble is that "Candy
Claude" Strauss' little helpers insist on serving plates that require field
glasses to find the food.
'Tis even said that Strauss uses an eye dropper in measuring chocolate
syrup for milk shakes.
But you really can't blame the Cellar for charging high prices. Any
hash house that's in an expensive rent district, does a lot of advertising,
hires chefs from the Continent, and Hies in chilled cantaloupe from the
Imperial Valley has to charge stiff fees for its grub.
At least we can be thankful that the Cellar varies the menu. Last week
they switched American cheese sandwiches from white to crackled wheat
bread, and the kitchen staff has been completely tied up ever since.
Plans also call for changing peanut butter and strawberry jelly sand
wiches to peanut butter and boysenberry jam the first of the year if the
head chef can see his way clear.
Getting away from this kidding. Cellar desserts are out of this world.
Where else on this old planet of ours could we find tasty fig ncvvton bars
dipped in delicious marshmallow sauce?
Another yum-yum number is two kadota figs dipped in three teaspoon
fuls of kadota fig syrup. Not to mention a deluxe strawberry sundae, which
consists of one strawberry, a heaping tablespoontul of vanilla ice cieam,
and one seedless maraschino cherry.
And on special occasions, i.e., Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Gonfalon
Day, Strauss whips up his favorite number: a stale doughnut dunked in
chocolate sauce.
But say what we may about Cellar food and service, at least we know
that Strauss and the other straw bosses have the interest of the students
at heart.
At a recent Board of Directors' powwow, the managers definitely
shelved the idea of charging a 20 per cent amusement tax when the juke
box is in operation.
