## Second-Story Man 
### 
To the Editor:
Many days ago I wrote The Daily asking certain pertinent questions
about University housing during summer quarter. You did me the couitesy
of publishing my letter along with an Editor's note saying that University
housing officials would be contacted and answers to my queiies piinted
in The Daily.
I've faithfully read each issue since and am still waiting for those
rtplies. Haven't you sought out the answers, or have the answer not been
supplied, or are there no answers to my questions? I m interested in know
ing which is correct.
Incidentally, I did hear along the grapevine that the answer to one of
my questions—why men are on the second floor of Toyon while the first
remains empty—is that the first Hoor was going to be redecorated and
that painters, paint smell, etc.. would disturb the men. The interesting
thing is that all week painters have been busily at work on the second |
floor. The first floor is devoid of not only residents but painters as well. ;
How come?
DAVE MARTIN.
(The second floor of Toyon was ust>d instead of the first because the
first Hoor room* are not as as the second floor rooms; because they i
onlv hold !>0 men, wherea* the second floor could accommodate all 150
applicants; and because the University requested that the first floor be
left vacant for visitors, and for those students who will return early
autumn quarter for football practice. TxiO
