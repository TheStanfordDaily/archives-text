# Change in Wind Saves Farms From Destruction by Fire
## 
### 
A change in the wind saved a
large number of farms and homes
from destruction yesterday evening
when two forest fires raged out of
control in the area west of Page
Mill Road, the fire department re
ported.
The alarm was phoned in to the
Stanford Fire Department at G:2O
and the fire trucks arrived at the
scene simultaneously with equip
ment from Woodside, the Santa
Clara County fire department, and
Los Altos.
Traffic jams prevented the trucks
from reaching the (ire immediately
and the fire spread quickly toward
several farms in the area. When
the trucks did get close to the
flames they were hampered by soft
ground and rough terrain.
A sudden change in the wind at
7:30 stopped the blaze from spread
ing any further. After that it be
came a mopping-up operation.
"Due to the coincidence in tim
ing of the two fires, they were
probably the work of arsonists," a
fire ranger said.
This is the second fire of this
kind that has occurred within the
past five days. On Thursday after
noon, careless campers started a
fire in the vicinity of Whiskey Hill,
northwest of the campus.
"The blaze started in a hollow

near the outlet creek from Sears
ville Lake and, aided by an upward
draft, quickly spread up the walls ]
of the ravine," Fire Chief Volpiano [
of Woodside reported.
"Quick work by the fire depart- !
ments on the scene limited the j
damage to about 20 acres of field. j
If the fire had spread into nearby
forests, it would have been a long ;
job to get it under control," Fire
Chief Marston of Stanford said. j
