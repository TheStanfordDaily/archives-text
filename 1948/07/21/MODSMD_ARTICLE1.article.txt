# Both Party Platforms Dodge Real Inflation Issue—Wallace
## 
### 
The 1948 Republican and Democratic platforms pay only lip
service to the necessity of heading off an inflation, it was de
clared here last night by Dr. Schuyler C. Wallace, director of
the Columbia University School of International Affairs.
A study of the platforms makes one increasingly dubious

about their internal consistency, he'
told the Seventh Stanford Business
Conference at a dinner which
closed the second day of the week
long sessions.
Wallace stated:
"I cannot help wondering wheth
er in the attempt to placate this
special interest or that, the man- j
agers of either party have given j
sufficient attention to what—apart (
from war —is for many Americans
the most pressing problem which
confronts us.
"That is the problem of a serious
inflation and its inevitable after- ;
math, a depression.
"If they have, it is certainly not i
clearly spelled out in the platforms. !
"INDEED. ALTHOUGH both par
ties pay lip service to the necessity
of heading off an inflation, one
would almost be justified in saying j
that the policies proposed by each j
have in them the seeds of their own
destruction."
The Eastern political scientist,
who is a visiting professor at Stan
ford this summer, pointed out that
il is well to remember at the open
ing of a Presidential campaign that
the victor —whoever he may be—
will not have unlimited choice as
to the policies which can be en
acted.
"HE WILL BE at all times
hedged about by political forces
and influences which will to a sur
prising degree restrict his liberty of
action.
"No matter which party is elect
ed. that party must govern the
United States within the broad
framework of the American consti
tutional system.
"And this must be done in a
manner consistent with the Ameri
can conlept of democracy and with
due regard for the rights of pri
vate property.
' WHICHEVER PARTY is elect
ed, the party managers will have
to deal with the fact that an in
creasingly large body of public
opinion now seemingly believes in
the desirability of a social service
state."
Wallace was the key speaker at
the evening session at Lagunita.
Other important addresses were
given during the day by U.S. Sen
ator Ralph E. Flanders of Vermont
and by John A. McCone, president
of the Joshua Hendy Corporation,
Los Angeles.
Senator Flanders' talk was the
second in the series of five which
he is making before the assembled
businessmen. lie appraised "Man
agement's Part in the Free F.ntcr

prise System." This morning, Sen
ator Flanders will speak on "Expe
rience with the Committee for Eco
nomic Development."
In his address, Mr. McCone stated
that the manpower and materials
which the nation needs for emer
gency programs can only be pro
vided by voluntary curtailment of
civilian purchasing and consump
tion. He said he personally believed
that a system of voluntarily cur
tailing less essential civilian activi
ties in times of emergency could
satisfy the nation's need. There is
no need for government controls,
he said.
Tonight's dinner meeting speech
will be given by Dr. C. Easton
Rothwell, vice - chairman of the
Hoover Library. He will discuss
"The Prospects for the United Na
tions."
