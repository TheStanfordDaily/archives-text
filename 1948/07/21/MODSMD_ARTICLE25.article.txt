CLEAR THE DECK, Eminalino, it's getting time to talk about football.
On September th« one, Coach Marehmont Schwartz' gridiron huskies
gather for autumn performances, which start on the 18th, with San Jose-
State playing the role of opponent.
Only anyone as cuckoo as Cockeyed Jenny would predict the Stan
fords for conference laurels, but a little sophomoric enthusiasm does insist
on predicting definite improvement in football quality, Indian style.
For one thing, Schwartz's green hands of '-17 won't be so green-palmed
anymore. That all-important "know-how" has permeated the Cardinal
ranks, and no foe will eb able to slyly push the Cards around like a
bunch of Mortimer Snerdish farm hands.
FACTOR NUMBER TWO: A promising bunch of froshters are ready
fen varsity play. Not quite ready for first-string work, but adequate
reserve work.
This is how the bacldield setup looks now. Don Campbell will prob
ably get first call at quarterback. He showed well in spring practice, and
lias the edge over Tommy Shaw, a promising soph who passes excellently
but needs experience.
Bobby Anderson appears to be set at left halfback. A standout in '4(5,
lie was slowed by injuries last season. But that doesn't mean A 1 Turriziani
will be- completely left out. lie's too fast and tricky to be completely
omitted by the good Marchie.
KOI! RIGHT HALF, Jim Nafziger is a good starting bet. Plagued by
charley horses throughout the last season, the Nafziger lad came through
with a fine spring practice workout. If Mickey Titus, however, has re
covered from a knee operation, he could steal the job away from Nafziger.
At fullback, it's strictly a tossup between Emory Mitchell and Buddy
Klein, two newcomers. The man most likely to upset this setup is Bruce
Van Alstyne, an incoming junior from Menlo College.
At end, Marehmont S. has divided up his workers for offensive and
defensive specialization. Gone Martin, Dan En berg, Bob Ghilotti, and
Dan Mervin are the top craftsmen in the flanker division.
THE TWO TOl* tackle berths are expected to be occupied by AVhit
Budge and Pinky Phleger, two holdovers. Strongest competition will come
from "Tex" White, a budding soph,
Guard duty will be handled by Don Fix and Jack McKittrick, and the
top center now is Johnny Rosekrans, though the man with most poten
tial is Dick Abraham, but the latter is shy on experience.
As we said before, the Cardinals are bound to improve; ready to leave
the cellar, and possibly pull an upset or two against the top teams.

but needs experience.
Bobby Anderson appears to be set at left halfback. A standout in '4(5,
lie was slowed by injuries last season. But that doesn't mean A 1 Turriziani
will be- completely left out. lie's too fast and tricky to be completely
omitted by the good Marchie.
KOI! RIGHT HALF, Jim Nafziger is a good starting bet. Plagued by
charley horses throughout the last season, the Nafziger lad came through
with a fine spring practice workout. If Mickey Titus, however, has re
covered from a knee operation, he could steal the job away from Nafziger.
At fullback, it's strictly a tossup between Emory Mitchell and Buddy
Klein, two newcomers. The man most likely to upset this setup is Bruce
Van Alstyne, an incoming junior from Menlo College.
At end, Marehmont S. has divided up his workers for offensive and
defensive specialization. Gone Martin, Dan En berg, Bob Ghilotti, and
Dan Mervin are the top craftsmen in the flanker division.
THE TWO TOl* tackle berths are expected to be occupied by AVhit
Budge and Pinky Phleger, two holdovers. Strongest competition will come
from "Tex" White, a budding soph,
Guard duty will be handled by Don Fix and Jack McKittrick, and the
top center now is Johnny Rosekrans, though the man with most poten
tial is Dick Abraham, but the latter is shy on experience.
As we said before, the Cardinals are bound to improve; ready to leave
the cellar, and possibly pull an upset or two against the top teams.
CLEAR THE DECK, Eminalino, it's getting time to talk about football.
On September th« one, Coach Marehmont Schwartz' gridiron huskies
gather for autumn performances, which start on the 18th, with San Jose-
State playing the role of opponent.
Only anyone as cuckoo as Cockeyed Jenny would predict the Stan
fords for conference laurels, but a little sophomoric enthusiasm does insist
on predicting definite improvement in football quality, Indian style.
For one thing, Schwartz's green hands of '-17 won't be so green-palmed
anymore. That all-important "know-how" has permeated the Cardinal
ranks, and no foe will eb able to slyly push the Cards around like a
bunch of Mortimer Snerdish farm hands.
FACTOR NUMBER TWO: A promising bunch of froshters are ready
fen varsity play. Not quite ready for first-string work, but adequate
reserve work.
This is how the bacldield setup looks now. Don Campbell will prob
ably get first call at quarterback. He showed well in spring practice, and
lias the edge over Tommy Shaw, a promising soph who passes excellently
but needs experience.
