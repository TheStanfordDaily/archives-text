## Why New Caps? 
### 
Some members of Rally Com have been very persistent in
their refusal to accept Excom's decision about rooters' caps. The
Executive Committee has consistently refused to authorize a
change over to ski-style caps.
A change over would mean that every member of the stu
dent body would have to buy a new cap. Some members of
the student body probably cannot afford the purchase of a
new cap every time the style changes.
The only real beneficiaries of such a deal would be the
wholesale manufacturer and the retail distributor.
Rally Com has argued that the new hats are needed if Farm
rooters sit on the sunny side of the stadium. They feel that it is
only polite for the home school to occupy those seats. Yet,
how many students come from the northern schools to the
games?
Would the purchase of new caps solely for the Big Game
every other year or even the annual games with the southern
schools be worth the added cost to the students? We think not.
Furthermore, the old-style rooters' caps still have some ad
vantages over the "ski cap" ones. In past games a block "S" has
been formed in the rooting sections by wearing the red or white
side up. This would not be possible with the proposed caps.
It may be holding back so-called "progress," but changing
rooters' caps at this time does not appear to be either necessary
or sensible. —B. M.
