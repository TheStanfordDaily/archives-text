## History 1948

I was asked, yesterday, by a few of my friends to give my frank opinion
on a certain Republican leader—a person who, undoubtedly, if the Repub
licans take over the White House in November, will have a lot to say
concerning our foreign policy. It appears to me that many people have
been misinformed as to the stand taken on important national issues by
this man. 1 would like to devote today's column for the purpose of ex
posing this "great American leader"—exposing his true position on past
and present issues and what he really stands for. Mr. G. Halleck, the
Republican leader of the House of Representatives, is the man I am re
ferring to.
Din ing the final debates, just before the recession of the last Congress,
on the bill for emergency aid to Europe* Republican leader Halleck as-

serted that the Democratic Administration has terribly
mismanaged the foreign policy of the United States and
that additional funds for aid to Europe are necessary
at this time only because of such mismanagement.
That President Roosevelt made some mistakes, as
at Yalta, and that President Truman made some mis
takes, as at Potsdam, one may readily admit; but that
both Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman were far more
nearly right than Mr. Halleck himself ever was, on
the really big decisions of foreign policy over the whole
span of these critical years, may be demonstrated by a
quick glance at the record.
Mr. Halleck voted against repeal of the Arms Em
bargo when the war broke out; if his will had pre-

vailed, the British would have had no American planes and no American
aims with which to resist Hitler.
Mr. Halleck voted against Selective Service in the summer of 1940;
he voted against the extension of Selective Service a year later. If Mr.
Hal leek's will had prevailed, we would have had no army to speak of
when the Japanese hit us at Pearl Harbor.
Mr. Halleck voted against Lend-Lease. If he had had his way, there
would have been no Grand Alliance of the United Nations—and a con
siderably larger job for American boys in the double task of defeating
Jopan and Germany.
More recently, Mr. Halleck has voted against the British loan, which,
however disappointing its results, has at least, kept Britain's head above
water. He voted against extension of the Hull Trade Agreements Act,
under power of which the highly constructive Geneva treaties have been
negotiated.
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman made their mistakes. But I shudder to
think where we would be today if Mr. Halleck had been running the
foreign policy of this country.

foreign policy of this country.

I was asked, yesterday, by a few of my friends to give my frank opinion
on a certain Republican leader—a person who, undoubtedly, if the Repub
licans take over the White House in November, will have a lot to say
concerning our foreign policy. It appears to me that many people have
been misinformed as to the stand taken on important national issues by
this man. 1 would like to devote today's column for the purpose of ex
posing this "great American leader"—exposing his true position on past
and present issues and what he really stands for. Mr. G. Halleck, the
Republican leader of the House of Representatives, is the man I am re
ferring to.
Din ing the final debates, just before the recession of the last Congress,
on the bill for emergency aid to Europe* Republican leader Halleck as-

serted that the Democratic Administration has terribly
mismanaged the foreign policy of the United States and
that additional funds for aid to Europe are necessary
at this time only because of such mismanagement.
That President Roosevelt made some mistakes, as
at Yalta, and that President Truman made some mis
takes, as at Potsdam, one may readily admit; but that
both Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman were far more
nearly right than Mr. Halleck himself ever was, on
the really big decisions of foreign policy over the whole
span of these critical years, may be demonstrated by a
quick glance at the record.
Mr. Halleck voted against repeal of the Arms Em
bargo when the war broke out; if his will had pre-

vailed, the British would have had no American planes and no American
aims with which to resist Hitler.
Mr. Halleck voted against Selective Service in the summer of 1940;
he voted against the extension of Selective Service a year later. If Mr.
Hal leek's will had prevailed, we would have had no army to speak of
when the Japanese hit us at Pearl Harbor.
Mr. Halleck voted against Lend-Lease. If he had had his way, there
would have been no Grand Alliance of the United Nations—and a con
siderably larger job for American boys in the double task of defeating
Jopan and Germany.
More recently, Mr. Halleck has voted against the British loan, which,
however disappointing its results, has at least, kept Britain's head above
water. He voted against extension of the Hull Trade Agreements Act,
under power of which the highly constructive Geneva treaties have been
negotiated.
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Truman made their mistakes. But I shudder to
think where we would be today if Mr. Halleck had been running the
foreign policy of this country.
