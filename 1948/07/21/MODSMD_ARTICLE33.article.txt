## Cellar Food 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems that Art Levinson overstepped the bounds of humor in his
Monday Bull Session. While it is generally agreed that Cellar prices are
high, there is sharp disagreement as to the quality of the food offered.
Passing over this minor point, the reader is given the impression that
Strauss, the Cellar manager, is personally responsible for quantity, qual
ity, and price of Union food. This implication is incorrect. His duties entail
the administering and maintenance of service facilities, nothing more.
One final criticism: the use of ridicule in past Bull Sessions has been
s.o profuse that such a style of writing is no longer amusing, much less
original.
Perhaps Levinson would profit by a glance at the placard on the wall
of room 8 of the Journalism Building. In reference to the reporting of
news it says. "Get it firstâ€”but first get it right."
