# Vucinich Talks On Yugoslavia
## 
### 
Dr. Wayne Vucinich, associate
professor of history, suggested an
American policy of watchful wait
ing toward Marshal Tito of Yugo
slavia in his apparent break with
Russia, in a speech before the Com
monwealth Club in San Francisco
last week.
He said he disagrees with the
view that Tito is a Communist and
head of a police state and therefore
the United States should simply ig
nore the happenings in that coun
try. "It is impossible for us to ex
pect that he and his cohorts could
make a complete somersault in po
litical ideology and orientation," he
continued.
It Tito abandons his revolution
ary Marxism and chooses to co
operate with the democratic pow
ers, he should have our support,
Dr. Vucinich added. "With our sup
port the reconversion of Yugoslavia
from extreme Marxism to a mod
erate socialism and agrarian de
mocracy may be effected."
He concluded that unfavorable
press reports and indifference by
the democracies may force Tito to
mend his differences with Moscow.
