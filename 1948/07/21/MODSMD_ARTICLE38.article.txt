# DINAH'S SMORGASBORD
## 
### 
With this issue of the Stan
ford Daily we of Dinah's Shack
wish to initiate a new advertising
featureâ€”a Daily Smorgasbord of
food for the soul just as tempting
and satisfying as the food for the
body which you will find at Din
ah's Smorgasbord Table.
Herein will be found morstles
of bcmusement created especially
for the delectation of superior wit,
satisfying equally to cultured ur
banity, Lagunita women, hall and
fraternity men.
Example: EBW once wrote about
artificial insemination that he was
"sorry for cows who had to boast
of affairs they'd had by parcel
post." And. that "there's a kind
of wild and glad elation in the
natural way of insemination." To
which we would agree.
We'll try to keep you chuckling;
let us know how we're succeeding.
Come and see us at THE SHACK
