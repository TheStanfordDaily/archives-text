# Clay Is Summoned to U.S. To Discuss Berlin Problem
## 
### 
BERLIN, July 20 (UP).â€”Gen. Lucius D. Clay, commander in
chief of American forces in Germany, disclosed tonight that he
is flying to Washington for an urgent conference with high gov
ernment officials on the Berlin blockade crisis.
Clay said that he had been summoned to Washington by Army

'Secretary Kenneth C. Royall and
Chief of Staff Gen. Omar Bradley.
He will take Robert Murphy, his
chief political adviser, with him in
a special C-54 transport plane. He
plans to be back in Germany Sun
day.
Clay disclosed his plan a few
hours after the Russians announced
here that they intended to send
100,000 tons of "bread grain and
other foodstuffs" to feed all Berlin.
But the Russian "offer," hemmed
in by conditions, was regarded by
American and British authorities
as propaganda. They expressed
doubt that the Russians could carry
it out even if it was intended to
be anything more than a move to
offset German accusations that they
are starving helpless people in theiv
attempt to force the Western Allies
out of Berlin.
TO GET THE FOOOD. the Ger
mans would have to buy it in shops
in the Soviet sector and with Rus
sian - zone money. Sales will be
subject to Russian ration limita
tions so presumably any Western
sector Germans who apply for the
food would have to get special Rus
sian ration cards.
Allied authorities say that after
stripping Eastern Germany the
Russians are not even able to feed
their own Germans properly and
have welshed on inter - Allied
agreements to send their share of
food to Berlin.
RUSSIA'S "OFFER" was made
j only after the Allies had proved
they could supply their sectors of
j Berlin by air alone.
In the 24 hours up to 4 p.m. to
day, American and British planes
made 484 flights to Berlin, bringing
2,410 tons of food, coal, and miscel
laneous supplies. American pilots
made 285 flights with 1,614 tons.
SINCE JUNE 2fi , American
planes have made 4.830 flights with
I 22,055 tons, British planes 3,637
flights with about 14.550 tons.
Gen. Clay, asked in Frankfurt
whether he would see President
Truman in Washington, said he
would see anybody Royall and
! Bradley told him to. Asked if wives
and children of Americans would
remain in Berlin in view of the
increasingly dangerous situation
there, he said: "Sure."
