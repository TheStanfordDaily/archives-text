K. T. Keller, president of Chrys
ler Corp., discussed "Some Economic
Aspects of (he Automobile Indus
try in the Postwar World" before
the Stanford Business Conference
yesterday.
MORE TIME and attention and
more engineering and research
money are spent on developing
features of owner convenience in
new automobiles than upon creat
ing revolutionary changes, Keller
said.
It costs almost five times as much
to bring out ;i new automobile
model today as similar programs
cost before the war, Keller said.
Tax policy today seems to be
aimed at bringing about a process
of exhaustion of resources through
out industry, especially in depre
ciation allowances adequate in
terms of current inflated costs.
CONCERNING AUTOMOBILE
design, Mr. Keller said, "The fun
damental thing is the perfection of
the product, perfection from the
standpoint of performance, com
fort. convenience, and safety of op
eration. The satisfaction of an
owner depend on whether or not
the car is comfortable to sit in."
He then went on to discuss some
of the basic public policies which
afiect industry and especially on
tax policy:
"A DEPRECIATION tax policy
that docs not allow a company to
treat provision for replacement of
plant as a business expense, is
working to exhaust the resources
of business.
"It must be perfectly apparent to
the people who formulate this pol
icy that they are not helping to
create the conditions that will yield
the maximum well - being to the
country as a whole.
"IT SHOULD BE just as plain
also to them that this way will not
produce the most revenue for the
government either.
"A common phenomenon of post
war operations is that our energies
have been progressively diverted
from our central purpose of mak
ing things people want to buy. We
have been used to produce the
financing for 'free' services ren
dered by governmental agencies."
In conclusion, Mr. Keller stated,
"The greatest contribution business
firms can make is to keep the bus
iness flexible and healthy to be
ready for whatever weather the
economic skies may produce and
to make useful things for people."
