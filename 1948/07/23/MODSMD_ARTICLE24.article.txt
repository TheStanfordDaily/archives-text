THERE'S A MAN at the helm of
the United States Olympic track
team whose tightly knotted bow tie
has picked up a lot of wise coach
ing techniques since it first appeared
in the business 39 summers ago.
There's a garbage can of envy
aimed at that bow tie, owned by
Dean B. Cromwell, the venerable
Southern California coach, whose
teams have won more national titles
than those of any other coach.
A flock of 1G Olympic starters (not
including the three Trojans on this
year's team) got their start by the
man with the Frank Sinatra tie.
And yet. with the Olympics a bare
week oft', many still think our home
bred Olympians arc in poor hands.
MANY CRITICS do not like Dean
Cromwell because his athletes are
ready-made when he gets his mitts

UXBRIDE, England., July 22
(l T P) —Dean Cromwell, coacli of
the American Olympic track and
held team, took his first good look
at his charges today after the sea
voyage from the United States and
sard his preparations were going
according to plan.

on them at USC's Bovard Field.
Those people can point to his
three Olympic team members of the
present—Mel Patton, Bob Chambers
and Rollie Sink—and say with ac
curateness that all were startling
high school athletes before they en
rolled at USC.
Cromwell's coaching techniques
of babying his athletes and giving
them all the title of "champ" are
liked by some, disliked by others.
He often has been accused of help
ing along the stars of his team, re
fusing to give coaching aid to a
mere "truekhorse 10.2 sprinter"
who is trying to make good inside
the Trojan horse.
WE I)() NOT KNOW the answer.
We can only point out a few ob
servations we have made through
the years.
Cromwell seldom has "lost" a
promising athlete. By that we
mean, good men have stayed good
and have improved while in his
hands. Few have gone down the
cinderpath drainpipe.
He has turned out capable teams,
losing only three dual meets in 17
years to college rivals, although this
year's Trojan edition came close to
losing a few more.
Among his top stars, just to men

| tion a few, have been Lou Zamp
; erini, the great miler; Earl Meadows
[ and Bill Sefton, former holders of
the pole vault world record; Bob
Peoples of javelin lame; Ken Carp
; enter, discus; and his long line of
J "world's fastest humans"—Charley
Paddock, Frank Wykoft and Patton,
the man they call Pell-Mell.
I!IS BABYING techniques with
i Mel Patton, for instance, have been
frowned upon by some authorities.
He sent Me! for long walks during
J the wintertime, held him off his
running schedule in order to "bring
i him around slowly" for this year's
London games. Patton, incidentally,
is not only the world's fastest hu
man, but also the "world's most
i finicky sprinter."
He gets sick after every race,
' drops out of half of them. In May,
: when he was "a month away from
perfect condition," he became the
first man ever to run the 100-yard
dash in 9.3 seconds, staving off
Panama's Lloyd Laßeach at the
wire to do it.
Cromwell—the Good Dean—has
his bad points in technique. He does
not run his men hard enough, pulls
crafty and unsportsmanlike moves
(such as trip'ing A 1 Lawrence
j against weak Stanford in 194G
I when the Trojan frosh could have
j won the meet) and does not instill
the "will to win" so important to
| track and field.
CROMWELL, like other USC
| coaches, has always "poured it on"
when the pouring was good. Of
this we do not approve.
But Cromwell always has gotten
the ultimate from his champions,
save for a few exceptions. On his
| record, no one can doubt his capa
bilities of an Olympic coach.
On the technique side, it's half a
j dozen of one and six of another.
