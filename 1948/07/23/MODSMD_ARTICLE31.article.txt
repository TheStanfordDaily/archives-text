## Social Rebels 
### 
It's an old saying that you can't please everybody, but there's
one group on campus that is more difficult to please than most.
It seems that a large number of graduate students in the edu
cation department don't like to associate with "youngsters" at
farm social functions.
They expressed this objection early enough in the quarter to
receive the consideration of the ASSU vice-president and social
chairman. She invited them to submit a suggested program for
special activities of their own.
This program was never submitted.
Education Council planned special activities for education
students which were competing with the all-campus activities of
the ASSU.
A representative of Education Council was invited to attend
a meeting of Social Committee of the ASSU. The purpose of this
invitation was to coordinate activities of the two planning groups.
Social Com felt that there were few enough social activities
this summer, without having competing activities on the same
dates.
A representative of Education Council did not attend the meet
ing of Social Com.
Now Education Council has requested that funds allocated to
the ASSU from tuition payments of their members be turned
over to them for use in their own special activities.
We feel that this special group has not cooperated with the
ASSU in its efforts to provide an adequate social program for
everyone.
We further feel that it is rather late in the quarter to make
such a demand for funds.
