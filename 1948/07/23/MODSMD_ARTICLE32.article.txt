## Cellar Food 
### 
To the Editor:
I thought Art Levinson's Bull Session about the Cellar was excellent.
There can be no denying that the prices are too high and the quality of
food is poor.
Cellar prices are equal to those charged in commercial eating estab
lishments, and the latter are certainly showing big profits these days. If
the Cellar isn't piling up a huge profit, then there is something wrong
with the management. The key to successfully operating a restaurant is
marketing, and that's where the Cellar falls down, because the manage
ment claims that profits haven't been high the past year.
They are always crossing off certain dishes from the menu, which
means that the manager doesn't know how to purchase food in correct
amounts.
What the Cellar needs is a manager who has had experience in operat
ing a low-cost eating unit, and not a dietician without any practical ex
perience in the tough business of buying at the right prices and correct
quantities.
It's high time that something be done about the Cellar. People only
eat there because of necessity, and that's not good.

To the Editor:
I wish to lodge a protest against that mean old Bull Session writer who
complained about Cellar food. I've never eaten there but a buddy of
mine thinks Union food is excellent. He might be slightly biased, though,
having just gotten off a bread and water diet at Alcatraz.
But really now, how can anyone complain about food over at the
Union? Another friend tells me it's not the chow—it's the way they pre
pare it. But I'm sure it's just matter of getting used to Union food. I got
a friend who has been eating at the Cellar for over a year now and he
likes it better than eating out of garbage cans. Oh, for the life of a dog!
And how can anyone complain about prices at the Union? My buddy
Joe says you can get a fish cake, a half-cooked potato, three or four beans,
soup, bread, and pudding—all for only a dollar. I'd like to see Walgreen's
try THAT! They wouldn't last long for the Union is a non-profit organi
zation—so they tell me—and making money is only secondary.

To the Editor:
I see from this Wednesday's Daily that Representative Halleck has
joined Senator Taft in the Bletz dog house. No doubt, other distinguished
Congressmen will be vilified in like manner in the months to come. For
it becomes increasingly evident that Mr. Bletz hates conservatives more
than he does Communists and Republicans (perish the thought) much more
than radicals.
Halleck's voting record on international issues Is the specific target of
his diatribe. In view of the fact that the U.S. is in just as great danger
today from Russia as it ever was from Germany, it could well be that the
Indiana Congressman was correct in advocating non-involvement. Our
war participation resulted in the loss of 200,000 lives and expenditure of
300 billion dollars.
The net result was the substitution of one menace for another. Who
can say with assurance that Halleck's policy could have been any worse
than the one followed by the Administration?
Mr. Bletz casts aspersion on Halleck's international votes merely be
cause he does not dare to challenge Halleck's stand on donu.-tic issues.
The House Majority Leader supported tax reduction, the Taft-Hartley
law, and reduction of government spending, and he voted against price
controls. These votes were all in opposition to the CIO line which Mr.
Bletz follows so assiduously.
Yet he does not Jure record those votes in his column because the
American people are wholeheartedly behind Representative Halleck on
those all-important Issues

than the one followed by the Administration?
Mr. Bletz casts aspersion on Halleck's international votes merely be
cause he does not dare to challenge Halleck's stand on donu.-tic issues.
The House Majority Leader supported tax reduction, the Taft-Hartley
law, and reduction of government spending, and he voted against price
controls. These votes were all in opposition to the CIO line which Mr.
Bletz follows so assiduously.
Yet he does not Jure record those votes in his column because the
American people are wholeheartedly behind Representative Halleck on
those all-important Issues

To the Editor:
I thought Art Levinson's Bull Session about the Cellar was excellent.
There can be no denying that the prices are too high and the quality of
food is poor.
Cellar prices are equal to those charged in commercial eating estab
lishments, and the latter are certainly showing big profits these days. If
the Cellar isn't piling up a huge profit, then there is something wrong
with the management. The key to successfully operating a restaurant is
marketing, and that's where the Cellar falls down, because the manage
ment claims that profits haven't been high the past year.
They are always crossing off certain dishes from the menu, which
means that the manager doesn't know how to purchase food in correct
amounts.
What the Cellar needs is a manager who has had experience in operat
ing a low-cost eating unit, and not a dietician without any practical ex
perience in the tough business of buying at the right prices and correct
quantities.
It's high time that something be done about the Cellar. People only
eat there because of necessity, and that's not good.

To the Editor:
I wish to lodge a protest against that mean old Bull Session writer who
complained about Cellar food. I've never eaten there but a buddy of
mine thinks Union food is excellent. He might be slightly biased, though,
having just gotten off a bread and water diet at Alcatraz.
But really now, how can anyone complain about food over at the
Union? Another friend tells me it's not the chow—it's the way they pre
pare it. But I'm sure it's just matter of getting used to Union food. I got
a friend who has been eating at the Cellar for over a year now and he
likes it better than eating out of garbage cans. Oh, for the life of a dog!
And how can anyone complain about prices at the Union? My buddy
Joe says you can get a fish cake, a half-cooked potato, three or four beans,
soup, bread, and pudding—all for only a dollar. I'd like to see Walgreen's
try THAT! They wouldn't last long for the Union is a non-profit organi
zation—so they tell me—and making money is only secondary.

To the Editor:
I see from this Wednesday's Daily that Representative Halleck has
joined Senator Taft in the Bletz dog house. No doubt, other distinguished
Congressmen will be vilified in like manner in the months to come. For
it becomes increasingly evident that Mr. Bletz hates conservatives more
than he does Communists and Republicans (perish the thought) much more
than radicals.
Halleck's voting record on international issues Is the specific target of
his diatribe. In view of the fact that the U.S. is in just as great danger
today from Russia as it ever was from Germany, it could well be that the
Indiana Congressman was correct in advocating non-involvement. Our
war participation resulted in the loss of 200,000 lives and expenditure of
300 billion dollars.
The net result was the substitution of one menace for another. Who
can say with assurance that Halleck's policy could have been any worse
than the one followed by the Administration?
