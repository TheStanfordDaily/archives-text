# Council Wants More Funds
## 
### 
The Education Council feels that
it has not been properly repre
sented in student government and
that it is entitled to a portion of
ASSU funds, Charles Burch told
Excom Wednesday night.
The group, as a member of the
student organization fund, is entitled
to bank with the ASSU, but it con
tends that it should have a share of
the funds collected from all students
for its own functions.
THE CONSTITUTION states that
only organizations that are a part
of and under the control of the
ASSU may use these funds. The
Education Council as an independent
organization is not under ASSU con
trol and therefore is not entitled to
any ASSU funds.
