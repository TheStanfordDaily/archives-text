# Fear o! War Declines; Piper Cub 'Bombs' UN
## Disgusted Vet Attempts To "Jolt UN into Action' Truman Calms Nation, Clay Reports on Berlin Situation 
### 
NEW YORK, July 22.—(UP)—The pilot of a
tiny Piper Cub dropped a small explosive to
day over the headquarters building of the United
Nations at Lake Success and threw the world
peace organization into turmoil.
Police tonight sought the pilot, a World War

II B-17 gunner, who was disgusted
at the ineffectiveness of the UN in
the present world crisis and feared
the United States was headed for
another war.
THE FLIER, Stephen Supina,
flew the little plane 115 miles from
Willimantic, Conn., to Long Island,
zoomed over the sprawling plant
which houses the UN and chopped
the explosive, police believed.
The "bomb" went ofT in the air,
about 100 yards from the building,
but caused no damage and no cas
ualties.
TIIE EXPLOSION caused hun- I
dreds of the 3,000 UN workers to
stream out, of the building, many of
them believing an air raid was un
derway. Nassau County Police
rushed an emergency squad to the
scene, the Civil Aeronautics Admin
istration began an investigation and
the big Air Force base at nearby |
Mitchell Field was notified.
Supina's brother, Thomas, said in
Willimantic that Stephen had been j
very depressed in recent weeks
about the Berlin crisis, the lethargy
of the UN and the need for some- j
thing to jolt them into action.

WASHINGTON, July 22.— i UP)—President
Truman sought to calm war fears today as the
National Security Council heard Gen. Lucius
D. Clay report on the tense situation in Russian
blockaded Berlin.
Shortly before going into conference at the

White House wilh the nation's top
military and diplomatic officials, Mr.
Truman told a news conference he
believes the overall chances for
peace are good; in fact, excellent.
Meanwhile, high Ameican officials
were reported miffed at the British
Foreign Office for "leaking" a story
that the next Western Power move
will be a note to Moscow offering
talks on the entire problem of Ger
many's future, provided the Kremlin
recognizes the right of the Western
Allies to stay in Berlin.
BRITAIN PROPOSED that course
early this week, it was disclosed, but
the United States has not accepted
the proposal. High quarters here re
garded the premature publicity
given the plan in London as a Brit
ish effort to bring pressure on the
U. S. government to go along.
White House Press Secretary
Charles G. Ross said the gathering of
the National Security Council, which
includes Secretary of State George
C. Marshall. Defense Secretary
James Forrestal, and other top mili
tary officials, was "not in the nature
of a crisis meeting."
HE SAID THAT so far as he
knew the council did not draw up
plans for the next U.S. move in the
Berlin situation, but simply listened
to a first-hand report from Clay, the
U.S. military commander in Ger
many who arrived here by plane
late yesterday.

Truman sought to calm war fears today as the
National Security Council heard Gen. Lucius
D. Clay report on the tense situation in Russian
blockaded Berlin.

White House wilh the nation's top
military and diplomatic officials, Mr.

were reported miffed at the British
Foreign Office for "leaking" a story
that the next Western Power move
will be a note to Moscow offering
talks on the entire problem of Ger
many's future, provided the Kremlin
recognizes the right of the Western
Allies to stay in Berlin.
BRITAIN PROPOSED that course
early this week, it was disclosed, but
the United States has not accepted
the proposal. High quarters here re

given the plan in London as a Brit

tiny Piper Cub dropped a small explosive to
day over the headquarters building of the United
Nations at Lake Success and threw the world
peace organization into turmoil.
Police tonight sought the pilot, a World War

at the ineffectiveness of the UN in
the present world crisis and feared
the United States was headed for
another war.
