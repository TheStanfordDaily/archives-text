## 
### 
Nine representatives from Stan
ford will be in attendance at the
First National Student Congress of
the National Student Association,
convening on the campus of hte
University of Wisconsin, Aug. 23 to
28, Marianna Olmstead, NSA rep
resentative at Stanford, announced
yesterday.
The National Student Associa
tion, provisionally established at a
constitutional convention in Madi
son last September, became a le
gally constituted organization in
June. This followed ratification of
the NSA constitution by 194 schools
of the 360 reporting at the conven?
tion and represented 13 more than
the majority necessary to provide
ratification.
"The fact that over half of those
colleges represented at the consti
tutional convention have ratified
definitely indicates that there is an
increasing need for the work of a
national association of student bod
ies in the United States," President
Bill Welsh stated.
