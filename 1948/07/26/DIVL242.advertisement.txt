Duck Billed Platypus?
(Orinthorhynchus paradoxus?)
Strange beastie, part duck, part
mole, wierd, Australian.
But, this summer at Stanford,
we're celebrating One World which
would make our friends from down
under citizens of the world.
Eddie remembers having read
somewhere a recipc for roasted
platypus AUX MERBES, but he's
forgotten it. When he told us about
it, it sounded wonderfully savory,
but we don't regret the omission of
Orinthorhynchus paradoxus from
the menu at Dinah's.
Noâ€”wc don't regret it, for, al
though the tendency these days is
for the small to be served up
I AUX HERBSS) to the large, we
prefer to keep our hands off of
small, unassuming (he can't help
his conformation, he was born that
way), law-abiding citizens of the
worid.
Dance at THE SHACK every
night, ten 'til two, no tax, free
eats.
