# New Scholarship Grant Described by Dr. Eurich
## 
### 
Outstanding students selected for leadership qualities will
receive four-year undergraduate scholarships to Stanford under
a $50,000 grant from the George F. Baker Trust of New York.
This was announced yesterday by Acting President Alvin C.
Eurich, who said that the purpose of the scholarships is "the

education of well-rounded, well
developed, balanced individuals
who are potential leaders."
While the exact number of stu
dents who will be admitted each
year on these scholarships has not
as yet been determined, Dr. Eurich
said that the scholarships will be
awarded during three consecutive
years and will continue through the
four - year undergraduate training
of the recipients.
The first students selected under
the plan will enter Stanford in the
fall of 1949. and others will be ad
mitted in 1950 and 1951.
Each will be given a substantial
scholarship which will vary with
the student's need, but which may
extend from $1,000 to $1,200 a year
for the four-year period.
Dr. Eurich said that Stanford will
set up a special faculty committee
to select students of outstanding
quality and promise — with com
plete disregard of the financial re
sources of their families —from sen
ior high schools and preparatory
schools. This faculty group will
function under the University's
Committee on Scholarships.
Students selected will not neces
sarily be the highest ranking stu
dents scholastically in their school.
What they have done with their
time outside of school, and their
participation in activities with their
fellows which may indicate quali
ties of natural leadership, will also
be taken into account, Dr. Eurich
pointed out.
Innate leadership will be what
the scholarship committee will be
seeking, Dr. Eurich explained, and
the promise of future contribution
to the nation will be the most im
portant factor in the selection of
the scholarship recipients. The
question of need will be entirely
secondary to that of promise.
The scholarships will be called
"The George F. Baker Scholarships
in Friendship for Jackson E. Rey
nolds, '9G." Mr. Reynolds is a for
mer president and chairman of the
board of the First National Bank of
New York.

to select students of outstanding
quality and promise — with com
plete disregard of the financial re
sources of their families —from sen
ior high schools and preparatory
schools. This faculty group will
function under the University's
Committee on Scholarships.
Students selected will not neces
sarily be the highest ranking stu
dents scholastically in their school.
What they have done with their
time outside of school, and their
participation in activities with their
fellows which may indicate quali
ties of natural leadership, will also
be taken into account, Dr. Eurich
pointed out.
Innate leadership will be what
the scholarship committee will be
seeking, Dr. Eurich explained, and
the promise of future contribution
to the nation will be the most im
portant factor in the selection of
the scholarship recipients. The
question of need will be entirely
secondary to that of promise.
The scholarships will be called
"The George F. Baker Scholarships
in Friendship for Jackson E. Rey
nolds, '9G." Mr. Reynolds is a for
mer president and chairman of the
board of the First National Bank of
New York.
