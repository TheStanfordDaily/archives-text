# Truman Meets Mad Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 25 (UP).â€”
The Republican - controlled 80th
Congress reconvenes on President
Truman's orders tomorrow for what
promises to be the bitterest politi
cal fight in almost three decades.
Outcome of the November elec
tions could be at stake, even as Mr.
Truman planned it.
He will set off the fireworks
Tuesday in a personal appearance
before a joint House-Senate session
to ask for authority to control
prices and ration meat, and to ap
peal for action on a host of bills
shelved at the pre-convention ad
journment in June.
The President is expected to ask
for authority to combat high prices
through price controls on basic
commodities, rationing of meat,
curbs on consumer credit, and
compulsory allocation of scarce in
dustrial materials.
He also may ask for a housing
program along the lines of the
Taft-Ellender-Wagner Bill that was
pigeonholed by the last Congress
because of House objections to
slum clearance and low-cost pub
lic housing provisions.
Oilier recommendations will in
clude expansion of the recently en
acted displaced persons law, federal
aid to education, expansion of so
cial security, a national health pro
gram, and an increase in the na
tional minimum wage.
