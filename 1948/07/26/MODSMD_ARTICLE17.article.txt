body voted to support the plan with
$9,050 in student funds.
The student funds will be used
for four tuition scholarships, which
will be matched by four from the

University. Campus living groups
have volunteered to house and feed
i the students —and in some cases to
I supply spending money. The rest
| of the fund voted by the student
j body wiil go for books, expenses,
i and, where necessary, transporta
j tion.
The eight foreign students are
i scheduled to leave Rotterdam Sept.
7 on the Dutch ship "Kota Inten"
