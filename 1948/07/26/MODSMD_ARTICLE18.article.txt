# Olympic Beauty at Farm
## 
### GIL JONAS 
Contrary to popular misconcep
ion, all athletes are not big,
rawny behemoths suffering from
.111 acute case of muscle-bounditis.
\n outstanding example on the
Farm is slender, shapely Brynhilde
Urosirioen, the Wagnerian-like he
>ill e in pigtails and skis.
Bea cuts quite a striking figure
vhen*she transports her 5-ft. 9-in.
■ ame from the Quad to the Union,
/invoking innumerable remarks of
admiration from the male majority,
/'ew people hereabouts, however,
.'onlize her amazing prowess on the
-.now-covered slopes with the U.S.
Olympic aggregation.
I'AIiLY START
Now 19, our Merced brunette re
members her awkward beginning
'n the winter spoi-t at the tender
aye of nine in Yosemite Valley
when she preferred to roll in the
now and eat the stuff if she wasn't
throwing snowballs at the hand
>me Rangers. But skiing grew on
er and hy the time she was 12,
ea had copped the California Jun
i r Championships.
Returning to the slopes in the
inter of '46. Bea began a long line I
conquests with two Butler cups,
Aldas, Silver Belt, and Auburn
vilational trophies among others
Med to her shell". Then came the
, competition and an age rule j
as waived to permit the youthful
■ocligy to enter the Class Band
events in California. Bea
omptly won.
I PS. CUPS AND MORE C UPS
In quick succession, she earned a
th in the Women's Nationals, a I
\th in the Olympic tryouts, and a
•sounding third in the Harriman |
'up among American women. This |
as sufficient to earn an Olympic
mth and the goal of all skiers was !
a <wing nearer.
Last winter, as a member of the j
S. Olympic team, Bea continued i
•r amazing rise by placing 12th ;
i the Downhi'l Special and first '
n >ng the American femmes, only
ven seconds behind the winning
■!ie. As a sideline, Bea placed
nth in the Special Slalom which
a tchen Fraser, another American
:iT, won.
The trip to St. Moritz was about
■ most memorable occasion in her
roer.
"Contrary to public opinion," Bea j
iT. "the Americans are held in

extremely high estimation in Eu
rope, and we were treated very
well." Bea's pigtails provoked great
interest in the European photogra
phers, who were constantly re
questing the beauteous laso to pose
for them.
"Stanford is treating me fine," she
added in a final note, "and has cer
tainly lived up to all my expecta
tions." (We have a hunch that an
unusual number of Farm men will
be taking up downhill slaloming as
part of their winter's extra-curric
ular recreation.)

Now 19, our Merced brunette re
members her awkward beginning
'n the winter spoi-t at the tender
aye of nine in Yosemite Valley
when she preferred to roll in the
now and eat the stuff if she wasn't
throwing snowballs at the hand

ea had copped the California Jun
i r Championships.
Returning to the slopes in the

conquests with two Butler cups,
Aldas, Silver Belt, and Auburn
vilational trophies among others
Med to her shell". Then came the
, competition and an age rule j
as waived to permit the youthful
■ocligy to enter the Class Band
events in California. Bea
omptly won.
I PS. CUPS AND MORE C UPS
In quick succession, she earned a
th in the Women's Nationals, a I
\th in the Olympic tryouts, and a
•sounding third in the Harriman |
'up among American women. This |
as sufficient to earn an Olympic
mth and the goal of all skiers was !
a <wing nearer.
Last winter, as a member of the j
S. Olympic team, Bea continued i
•r amazing rise by placing 12th ;
i the Downhi'l Special and first '
n >ng the American femmes, only
ven seconds behind the winning
■!ie. As a sideline, Bea placed
nth in the Special Slalom which
a tchen Fraser, another American
:iT, won.
The trip to St. Moritz was about
■ most memorable occasion in her
roer.
"Contrary to public opinion," Bea j
iT. "the Americans are held in

extremely high estimation in Eu
rope, and we were treated very
well." Bea's pigtails provoked great
interest in the European photogra
phers, who were constantly re
questing the beauteous laso to pose
for them.
"Stanford is treating me fine," she
added in a final note, "and has cer
tainly lived up to all my expecta
tions." (We have a hunch that an
unusual number of Farm men will
be taking up downhill slaloming as
part of their winter's extra-curric
ular recreation.)
