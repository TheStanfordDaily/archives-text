SINCE JULY 15 intramural head
Chuck Taylor has scheduled 17
volleyball and Softball games. And
yet to date only five games have
been played — four volleyball and
one Softball. The other 12 have
cither been forfeited by one team,
or weren't played because neither
team showed up.
Summer is the ideal time for
these outdoor sports. The intra
mural schedule was almost elimi
nated from the quarter's activities,
until students "put on the pressure"
to maintain a sports program.
SO TAYLOR, backed by Excom,
made out a schedule with the help
of athletic managers of interested
groups from fraternity houses and
Toyon and Encina. The rest would
just be fun. The rest would be
easy.
But the teams aren't getting to
gether. If the trend of letting the
game go continues, the whole sum
mer intramural program will fail.
Try getting the whole team to
gether and playing the scheduled
games instead of holding continu
ous bull sessions or lapping up the
beer. Wait until after the games
for that. You'll have more to talk
about, and the beer will taste bet
ter.
JACK BATY, Daily golf enthu
siast and writer, suggested last
week that any amateur golfers in
terested in organizing some friendly
competition for the practice and
just for enjoyment should contact
him. It doesn't take an excellent
score to get in on the fun. And
the green fees will be gratis for
those entering the competition. It's
a good deal—why not take advan
tage of it? Call jack Baty at Alpha
Sigma Phi. or drop a card. Let's get
the summer sports started.
