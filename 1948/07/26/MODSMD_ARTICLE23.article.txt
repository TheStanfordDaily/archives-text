Tu the Editor:
By an apt coincidence there appeared in today's Daily this editorial
criticizing Education Council's lack of co-operation with ASSU and its
social chairman, and (on another page) this notice of ASSU's all-campus
barbecue next Friday from 3 to 12 p.m.!
Therefore. ASSU officers and members should be in no way irked at
the actions of Education Council when they themselves schedule an all -
campus social affair in direct conflict with and opposition to the Stanford
Players' major production of "L'Arlesienne"!
This is, of course, only one of many such major conflicts arranged each
quarter by ASSU, and we have grown accustomed to it, particularly when
our dates are set almost a year in advance and ASSU has ample time (if
it wants to) to avoid such conflicts. No, we think the lack of co-operation
is mostly on the part of ASSU.
Very sincerely yours,
