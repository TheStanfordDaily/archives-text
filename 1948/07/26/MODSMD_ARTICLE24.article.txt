# Student Federalists
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Your editorial page has been dominated for some time by the burning
arguments, pro and con, regarding 'Candy Claude" St'-auss and Cellar food.
Worthy as such an issue is, I'm taking the liberty of submitting this letter
on a different subject.
On campus there is an organization which has been more or less
active for some time. I never paid much attention to it, until recently, I
had nothing else to do. and dropped into one of the meetings of the Stan
ford Student Federalists. Quite an eye-opener. There are a lot of mis
conceptions, held by perhaps the majority of the student body, concerning
this group, and I think it's about time these misconceptions be corrected.
For one things, a lot of my friends are inclined to laugh at the Student
Federalists for being "starry-eyed dreamers" or "crack-pots" or something
of the sort. These labels are certainly unjustified. The organization is
working for goals which upon inspection are really quite reasonable.
Idealistic? Yes. But there's a great qualitative difference between prac
tical idealism and Utopian idealism. The Student Federalists are work
ing toward strengthening the U.N. into a competent agency for keeping
the peace. If this hope is Utopian, then it would seem Utopian to hope at
all.
Also, certain people seem to believe that the Student Federalists are,
iii effect, camp-followers of Wallace's "Gideon's Army." I've heard it said
they should be called "Student Rederalists." This, again, is an erroneous
and absurd idea. The world government movement is regarded less
sympathetically by the left-wingers than by an# other group. It should
be noted that the public figure most strongly supporting the Student Fed
eralist program is one Harold E. Stassen, generally believed to be a non-
Wallaceite.
Nobody would claim that the goals of the Student Federalists are easy
of attainment, or that realization can be had within a week or a month
or a year. But before rational people treat any group or idea with derision
or indifference, 1 think they should know whatinell they're deriding or
ignoring. If the scoffers would take the trouble to attend one of the meet
ings of these Stanford Student Federalists, a lot more eyes would be
opened.

all.
Also, certain people seem to believe that the Student Federalists are,
iii effect, camp-followers of Wallace's "Gideon's Army." I've heard it said
they should be called "Student Rederalists." This, again, is an erroneous
and absurd idea. The world government movement is regarded less
sympathetically by the left-wingers than by an# other group. It should
be noted that the public figure most strongly supporting the Student Fed
eralist program is one Harold E. Stassen, generally believed to be a non-
Wallaceite.
Nobody would claim that the goals of the Student Federalists are easy
of attainment, or that realization can be had within a week or a month
or a year. But before rational people treat any group or idea with derision
or indifference, 1 think they should know whatinell they're deriding or
ignoring. If the scoffers would take the trouble to attend one of the meet
ings of these Stanford Student Federalists, a lot more eyes would be
opened.
