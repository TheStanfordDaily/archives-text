# Seek Peaceful Solution: Clay
## 
### 
BERLIN. July 25 (UP).-The
United States intends to exhaust
every possible diplomatic approach
to solve the Berlin blockade with
Russia but will not negotiate "un
der duress," Gen. Lucius D. Clay
said tonight after a high-level con
ference of American experts.
The American commander in
chief said bluntly that so long as
the Rusian blockade continues the
United States "will continue to fly
planes into Berlin regardless of
what happens in the air corridors."
Discussing the possibility of four
power negotiations with Russia on
Berlin and Germany as a whole,
Clay said:
"I do not know if we can find
a solution through four-power ne
gotiations. But the United States
has never been opposed to an ap
proach except under duress. Such
a solution is not possible so long
as the Berlin blockade persists.
Clay said that the United States
in its desire for a peaceful solution
was willing to make concessions to
Russia in the dispute over rival
currency in Berlin.
The statement by the American
commander in chief, just back from
Washington, was made after a
high-level policy conference of ace
diplomatic and. military experts on
Russia and Germany.
The results of this conference,
consolidating decisions on policy
reached in Washington, will be
conveyed to Great Britain and
France in a series of talks starting
in London tomorrow.
