# India Traveler Shows Movies Here Tuesday
## 
### 
The documentary technicolor
film, "There Is No India," will be
shown tomorrow ' night on the
Tuesday Evening Series by Deane
Dickason, photographer, lecturer,
and world traveler.
The illustrated lecture, which is
open to the public without charge,
will begin at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Hall.
Mr. Dickason spent all of 1946
and early 1947 in India to produce
the film, acclaimed as one of the
finest to come out of that country
of 389 million people, speaking
some 200 different languages and
clinging to a dozen different socio
religious creeds.
Animated maps showing the lo
cation of Hindu . India, Moslem .Pa
kistan, and the fabled lands of the
Indian princes are included in
Mr. Dickason's film. There are
close-ups of some of India's many
races, her industries, the magnifi
cence of her great temples and pal
aces, in contrast to the poverty and
squalor of the mases, and pictures
of the new Prime Minister, Hindu
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and Mo
hammed Ali Jinnah, Moslem Pa
kistan's Governor General.
Mr. Dickason's camera and his
accompanying lecture take the au
dience on a Cook's tour of that
country of great contrasts which
contains one-fifth of the world's
population â€” snow - clad Himalayas
and tropic coasts, floods and
droughts, palaces and hovels, ma
harajas and beggars.
When Mr. Dickason returned
from India last year, he completed
his 21st trip around the world in
24 years. He has shown his color
film before the National Geogiaph
ic Society in Washington, D.C., the
American Museum of Natural His
tory, the Institute of Arts and Sci
ences at Columbia, and over 30 or
ganizations on the Pacific Coast.
