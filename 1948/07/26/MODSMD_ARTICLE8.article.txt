# Physical Required Of Disabled Vets
## 
### 
Disabled veterans may continue
their training under the Vocational
Rehabilitation Act, Public Law 16,
after the Veterans Administration
suspends their disability compen
sation for failure to report for a
physical re-examination.
During the suspension period
they will forfeit the special subsist
ence and dependency allowances
provided for disabled trainees.
They will receive only the subsist
ence allowance payable to non-dis
abled veterans training under the
GI Bill.
The Veterans Administration also
announced that trailers and house
boats do not qualify as homes under
the loan guaranty provisions of the
GI Bill. However, GI loans may be
negotiated for trailers and house
boats if used for legitimate busi
ness purposes.
