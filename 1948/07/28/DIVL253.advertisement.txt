A certain bearded gentleman
whose initials are CBS is said once
to have remarked that youth was
much too precious n possession to
waste on mere children, much too
young to appreciate it.
Ho-hum. Youth. Fishing, swim
ming, dancing (ten 'til two at
Dinah's), sunburning, and so forth.
Wonderful.
It does get burdensome, though,
at times.
For example, we observed the
following scene in one of the pen
insula's most fashionable restau
rants (after all, there arc only two
of them —the Shack and the Barn).
A Very junior Citizen, age ap
proximately 4 years, was being
towed to the women's lavatory by
a strong-willed woman (presum
ably his mother). As they passed,
the VJC was overheard to exclaim,
"All I want to know is, when are
you going to let me start making
my own decisions!"
By the time he is in Encir.a, we
presume he will be making his own
decisions, and when it comes to
restaurants, there'll realy be no
problem—there's only one Dinah's
Shack.
