# Truman Asks Legislators Enact Anti-Inflation Bills
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 27—(UP)—President Truman today ap
pealed to congress for price controls and other anti-inflation
measures "now" but Republican leaders gave his program a
cold reception and began debating plans to adjourn in two weeks
or less.
Strategy sessions of House and Senate GOP leaders got

under way behind closed doors
shortly after Mr. Truman faced the
openly hostile lawmakers with a
warning that "our people demand
legislative action" to curb the high
cost of living and ease the housing
shortage.
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, GOP
Presidential nominee,, reportedly
conferred with Congressional lead
ers by telephone, and advised them
not to adjourn immediately — that
is, tomorrow or the next day. He
was not, however, against adjourn
ment within two weeks.
Authoritative sources said the
House Republican steering com
mittee agreed tentatively that Con
gress should adjourn in about two
weeks.
ACTING SENATE GOP Leadei
Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska
announced that the anti-poll tax
bill would be the first measure
called up for debate in the Senate.
That can touch ofT a filibuster by
Southern Democrats that could
well tie up the special session until
it adjourns.
The Republican conferences be
gan after Mr. Truman appeared
personally before the Congress he
recently dubbed the "second woist
in history" to demand action on a
list of 18 major national problems,
headed by high prices and housing.
He demanded quick passage of an
excess profits tax, wage-price ceil
ings, standby rationing powers, and
other measures which he said were
necessary at once to prevent a dis
astrous depression.
HE ALSO CALLED for action
now—not next year —on a low-rent
housing program and went on to
list nine of the major national
problems which he said it was up
to the special session to solve at
once.
Top Republican leaders immedi
ately turned their backs on his pro
gram but indicated the law-makers
would stay around at least long
enough to go through the formality
of considering it.
Chairman Robert A. Taft, R.. 0.,
of the Senate GOP policy commit
tee, set the tone of Republican re
action. He said, "It would take
six months to consider the Presi
dent's whole program," and "This
only emphasizes the fact that the
session was obviously called for
political purposes."

necessary at once to prevent a dis
astrous depression.

now—not next year —on a low-rent

list nine of the major national
problems which he said it was up
to the special session to solve at
once.
Top Republican leaders immedi

would stay around at least long
enough to go through the formality
of considering it.

political purposes."
WASHINGTON, July 27—(UP)—President Truman today ap
pealed to congress for price controls and other anti-inflation
measures "now" but Republican leaders gave his program a
cold reception and began debating plans to adjourn in two weeks
or less.
Strategy sessions of House and Senate GOP leaders got

under way behind closed doors
shortly after Mr. Truman faced the
openly hostile lawmakers with a
warning that "our people demand
legislative action" to curb the high
cost of living and ease the housing
shortage.
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, GOP
Presidential nominee,, reportedly
conferred with Congressional lead
ers by telephone, and advised them
not to adjourn immediately — that
is, tomorrow or the next day. He
was not, however, against adjourn
ment within two weeks.
Authoritative sources said the
House Republican steering com
mittee agreed tentatively that Con
gress should adjourn in about two
weeks.
ACTING SENATE GOP Leadei
Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska
announced that the anti-poll tax
bill would be the first measure
called up for debate in the Senate.
That can touch ofT a filibuster by
Southern Democrats that could
well tie up the special session until
it adjourns.
The Republican conferences be
gan after Mr. Truman appeared
personally before the Congress he
recently dubbed the "second woist
in history" to demand action on a
list of 18 major national problems,
headed by high prices and housing.
He demanded quick passage of an
excess profits tax, wage-price ceil
ings, standby rationing powers, and
other measures which he said were
necessary at once to prevent a dis
astrous depression.
