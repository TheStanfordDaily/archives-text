# THE SPACE
## 
### 
In this balmy temperate clime
Summertime is partytime!
O'er beach and sand 'neath sum
mer sky
Booxing college students lie.
Hand me down my bottle of beer.
Don't crowd me off the blanket,
dear.
Discerning students in the know
Rolling down the highway go;
Dine and wine and watch the birds.
Mingle laughter, song, and words.
Hand me down my xombie, Eddie,
Can't you make this room stay
steady?
Days so warm, nights sublime,
Summertime is partytime!
Dancing out beneath the stars,
Driving home in open cars.
Hand me down my bottle of gin.
What time ya say ya gotta be in?
