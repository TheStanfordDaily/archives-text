### 
BERLIN, July 27 (UP).—Russia's
Red Army is holding gigantic ma
neuvers in eastern Germany while
its leaders intensify their attempt
to throw the Western Allies out of
Berlin, intelligence agents reported
j today.
Up to 350,000 men with the latest
i type of German-produced jet fight—
I er planes, monster new tanks, and
at least eight crack armored divi
sions are conducting the maneuvers
over the entire Russia'n occupation
zone from the Baltic Sea to the
forests of Thuringia, it was as
serted.
This news confronted Western
Allied commanders as American
J Air Force officers said in Wiesba
den that United States air combat
j strength had reached a new post
' war low in Germany.
IT WAS ESTIMATED that Rus
sia's air strength, constantly in
creasing, totaled now about 700
first-class fighter planes and 200 to
j 300 heavy bombers. The United
Slates has about 75 fighters and
about 30 Superfortresses. Thus it
is outnumbered nearly 10 to 1 at
the most critical period in Germany
since the war.
The Russians made their latest
move in the Berlin cold war by de
manding through their official army
j newspaper, Taegliche Rundschau,
[ that the United States stop the
"completely superfluous flights of
insufficiently trained and deficient
ly instructed American pilots over
Berlin."
THE NEWSPAPER cited the
' crash of an American C-47 trans
port plane last Saturday in the
American sector. This, it said, is
proof that the American aerial sup
ply of Berlin "threatens the lives of
the 4,000.000 people of the city."
! American pilots persistently fly
{ dangerously low over Berlin, it was
| added.
Russian-licensed German news
: papers also started saying that the
I Western Allies, not Russia, were
