Well, the first round of the Stan
ford Invitational golf tourney is
over, and the Divot Digger has
slunk into his cave a saddened, if
wiser, man. After hours of reading
up 011 golf, and after hitting hun
dreds of golf shots at the Peninsula
Fairways, he still couldn't hit a
decent long iron. Thus The Daily's
threat to the golfing world has
failed to materialize.
Speaking of the Invitational,
there is one match next Saturday
in the second round which should
be ol interest to al! golfing enthu
siasts. This is the Tal Smith—Dick
Bailey match which tees off
promptly at noon. Smith is the de
fending champion and Bailey is the
San Francsico city title holder.
There is no admission charge, and
the golf should be excellent. Why
not go out?
ANOTHER ITEM of interest to
a'l golfers is the annual PALO
Club's hole -in - one tournament,
being held at the Peninsula Fair
ways down oil El Camino south of
Brennan's. Prizes galore are being
offered, and you don't even have to
put the ball in the hole. All you
gotta do is get close. The tourna
ment starts Saturday and runs for
the next two weeks.
Those of you who need practice
can join me nearly any night down
at the Fairways. The Dodges, fa
ther and son, run a very nice range,
and they know enough about the'
game to give anybody valuable
help. The best part about it is that
you can hit the balls as far as you
want to, and still not have to pick
them up.
