## Better Instruction 
### 
At the time the tuition raise was announced last Spring, it was
the consensus among students that the quality of instruction
should also be raised.
It seemed only right that an education which cost more
should be a better education. Whether or not it actually is a bet
ter education will depend a great deal on the man whom the
Board of Trustees names as our next president.
The academic value of a Stanford education can be increased
only if the man chosen is a man who can maintain a high level
of competence in our professorial staff. Not only should he be
able to maintain the present level, but he should be a man capable
of bringing more men and v/omen of high calibre to our faculty.
We are fortunate at this University in that we have been able
to receive instruction from some outstanding specialists. The
presence of these men and women has lent much to the Uni
versity's academic prestige.
It is important now that the Board's decision be a wise one,
for a poor decision could well mean the loss of some of our
best faculty members.
The fact that the Board is taking a long time to consider this
matter is evidence enough of the importance they place on it.
The importance the student body places on it will be evi
denced by how much they voice their pleasure or displeasure
v/ith instruction in future years.
