## Europe 1948

(Dick Kelton, Stanford student, is traveling in Europe this summer.
The Daily will print suth excerpts from his letters as we consider of
interest to our readers. —Ed.)
Rolling hills of Eastern France, like clothes of the French people, are a
patchwork of color. Dark green of the lusih meadows, the light green of
cornfields and vineyards, the brown stacks of cut hay, the golden carpet
of wheatfields, together form a rich blanket which hides the scars of war.
In this area one can almost forget about the last decade of destruction.
One can almost forget, until he comes to the ruins of some small country
town. People are out in the heaps of rubble, placing stone upon stone, to
rebuild a home. But when their home is finished, they will discover as
most of France is discovering, that it takes more than physical reconstruc
tion to reestablish the pre-war France.
A house is not a home merely because it has four walls and a roof that
doesn't leak. Nor is a rebuilt country a great nation just because it no
longer externally shows the effect of war.
Physical reconstruction is progressing well. In Chambery, a railroad
center damaged by repeated bombing, vacant lots are used for market
places. Temporary stands are set up where everything from gaily colored
ties to fresh fruit is sold.
As one slowly crosses a temporary wooden bridge over the Yonne
River, he sees the reflection of the spires of beautiful Auxere, unbroken
by the old stone bridge which used to span the river. Only the blind roads
which are blocked with detour signs remain. Plans have been drawn for a
new bridge, and the underwater work has already begun.
In Paris there are now few pedestals without statutes on them. The
Sainte Chappele's priceless stained glass windows, which had been re
moved during the war, are being replaced, but several frames will remain
empty. The gardens at Versailles, untended in the war years are now in
full splendor./
Rehabilitation of the people, however, is progressing less satisfactorily
Drawn faces and thin bodies are external symptoms of their mental con
dition. Their concept of order has been destroyed. Waiting lines are not
respected as people struggle to get to the front. The youth of France pre
sents an educational problem almost as great as that of the German youth.
Michelene Martin, a pretty young Paris teacher, told me "during their
formative years the children were taught to lie and cheat against sources
of authority. Now what can we do with them?" The gay spirit that once
typified Paris has gone.
The plight of France is underlined by the contrasting situation in
Switzerland. When one crosses the border, he enters an island of plenty
set in the European sea of misery and poverty. In Geneva I heard birds
sing for the first time since I had arrived on the Continent. Coincidence?
Perhaps, but that indication of light-heartedness was fulfilled by the entire
atmosphere. People wore smiles and good clothing. Window shopping
was enjoyable because shops were stocked with commodities I had not
seen since I left the U.S. "his prosperous nation, with few natural re
sources, has found that the way to preserve the buildings, the bridges and
the bodies and minds of its people, is not by some better means of re
construction, but rather by avoiding war.
France, struggling with its problems of reconstruction, is also learning
that, measured in terms of human happiness, continued peace Is beyor.d
any evaluation of worth.

cornfields and vineyards, the brown stacks of cut hay, the golden carpet
of wheatfields, together form a rich blanket which hides the scars of war.
In this area one can almost forget about the last decade of destruction.
One can almost forget, until he comes to the ruins of some small country
town. People are out in the heaps of rubble, placing stone upon stone, to
rebuild a home. But when their home is finished, they will discover as
most of France is discovering, that it takes more than physical reconstruc
tion to reestablish the pre-war France.
A house is not a home merely because it has four walls and a roof that
doesn't leak. Nor is a rebuilt country a great nation just because it no
longer externally shows the effect of war.
Physical reconstruction is progressing well. In Chambery, a railroad
center damaged by repeated bombing, vacant lots are used for market
places. Temporary stands are set up where everything from gaily colored
ties to fresh fruit is sold.
As one slowly crosses a temporary wooden bridge over the Yonne
River, he sees the reflection of the spires of beautiful Auxere, unbroken
by the old stone bridge which used to span the river. Only the blind roads
which are blocked with detour signs remain. Plans have been drawn for a
new bridge, and the underwater work has already begun.
In Paris there are now few pedestals without statutes on them. The
Sainte Chappele's priceless stained glass windows, which had been re
moved during the war, are being replaced, but several frames will remain
empty. The gardens at Versailles, untended in the war years are now in
full splendor./
Rehabilitation of the people, however, is progressing less satisfactorily
Drawn faces and thin bodies are external symptoms of their mental con
dition. Their concept of order has been destroyed. Waiting lines are not
respected as people struggle to get to the front. The youth of France pre
sents an educational problem almost as great as that of the German youth.
Michelene Martin, a pretty young Paris teacher, told me "during their
formative years the children were taught to lie and cheat against sources
of authority. Now what can we do with them?" The gay spirit that once
typified Paris has gone.
The plight of France is underlined by the contrasting situation in
Switzerland. When one crosses the border, he enters an island of plenty
set in the European sea of misery and poverty. In Geneva I heard birds
sing for the first time since I had arrived on the Continent. Coincidence?
Perhaps, but that indication of light-heartedness was fulfilled by the entire
atmosphere. People wore smiles and good clothing. Window shopping
was enjoyable because shops were stocked with commodities I had not
