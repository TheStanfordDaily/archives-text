# Berlin Rebuilds; Streets Still Filled With Rubble
## 
### 
Divided Berlin, focal point for world interest as the testing
ground of the Western Allies and Russia, is still a long way from
digging out of its war-inherited ruins and rubble.
A jumble of twisted steel and shattered masonry at the end
of World War 11, the streets of Germany's once-proud capital

have been largely cleared by pil
ing up the wreckage. Damaged
houses have been repaired and
some new ones built of salvaged !
bricks. Yet recent estimates of the
minimum time required for resto
ration, even under favorable cir
cumstances, range up to 50 years. |
The tremendous problems of re
turning Berlin eventually to its old I
position of administrative and in- 1
dustrial leadership recall the nu
merous all-out construction booms j
this city has known in a long and
eventful life, notes the National
Geographic Society.
A CENTRAL AND accessible po
sition on the flat plains of northern
Germany first gave the medieval
settlement its chance of develop
ment. In time, the city which now
is split into four international 1
zones was noted as a hub of na- ;
tional and continental traffic.
Long before it was established in
1871 as the national capital of the i
united German Empiire, Berlin '
served as a governmental seat, first J
of Brandenburg, then of Prussia. !
As headquarters of the powerful (
Prussian kings, it expanded spec
tacularly.
Under the Great Elector of Bran
denburg, its population in 1688 had :
been about 20,000. By 1850, nearly
half a million people lived in this
crowded, lively metropolis of pal- ,
aces and parks.
AFTER 1871. extensive moderni- j
zation and development of Berlin j
began. Streets were broadened and j
paved. New public buildings and I
apartments grew up in the heavy, |
four - story blocks that were to j
characterize the city.
With its architectural pattern set
in the ornate styles of the late
1880's, Berlin was a bustling civic
giant when World War I broke.
ALTHOUGH THE CAPITAL met
no physical war damage, it suf
fered considerably in 1918 and after
from political turmoil and economic
distress. Its population dropped to
half the prewar figure of nearly
four million.
Then once more came a building
boom. Near the end of the 1920'5.
it was reported that 40,000 houses a
year were going up, as civic facili
ties expanded for a population
reaching toward the 4,500.000 mark.
The Nazi rise to power brought
still another surge of construction
in architectural forms which have

been called "theatricals in mason- |
ry."
The remains of the once imposing :
government buildings of downtown 1
Berlin—hardest hit in the war—are
mostly within the Russian occupa- ;
tion zone of the east. The Amen- ,
can section, including Tempelhof
airfield, extends south and south
westward. The British and French
zones are in the west and northwest
respectively.

Long before it was established in
1871 as the national capital of the i
united German Empiire, Berlin '
served as a governmental seat, first J
of Brandenburg, then of Prussia. !
As headquarters of the powerful (
Prussian kings, it expanded spec
tacularly.
Under the Great Elector of Bran
denburg, its population in 1688 had :
been about 20,000. By 1850, nearly
half a million people lived in this
crowded, lively metropolis of pal- ,
aces and parks.
AFTER 1871. extensive moderni- j
zation and development of Berlin j
began. Streets were broadened and j
paved. New public buildings and I
apartments grew up in the heavy, |
four - story blocks that were to j
characterize the city.
With its architectural pattern set
in the ornate styles of the late
1880's, Berlin was a bustling civic
giant when World War I broke.
ALTHOUGH THE CAPITAL met
no physical war damage, it suf
fered considerably in 1918 and after
from political turmoil and economic
distress. Its population dropped to
half the prewar figure of nearly
four million.
Then once more came a building
boom. Near the end of the 1920'5.
it was reported that 40,000 houses a
year were going up, as civic facili
ties expanded for a population
reaching toward the 4,500.000 mark.
The Nazi rise to power brought
still another surge of construction
in architectural forms which have

been called "theatricals in mason- |
ry."
The remains of the once imposing :
government buildings of downtown 1
Berlin—hardest hit in the war—are
mostly within the Russian occupa- ;
tion zone of the east. The Amen- ,
can section, including Tempelhof
airfield, extends south and south
westward. The British and French
zones are in the west and northwest
respectively.
Divided Berlin, focal point for world interest as the testing
ground of the Western Allies and Russia, is still a long way from
digging out of its war-inherited ruins and rubble.
A jumble of twisted steel and shattered masonry at the end
of World War 11, the streets of Germany's once-proud capital

have been largely cleared by pil
ing up the wreckage. Damaged
houses have been repaired and
some new ones built of salvaged !
bricks. Yet recent estimates of the
minimum time required for resto
ration, even under favorable cir
cumstances, range up to 50 years. |
The tremendous problems of re
turning Berlin eventually to its old I
position of administrative and in- 1
dustrial leadership recall the nu
merous all-out construction booms j
this city has known in a long and
eventful life, notes the National
Geographic Society.
A CENTRAL AND accessible po
sition on the flat plains of northern
Germany first gave the medieval
settlement its chance of develop
ment. In time, the city which now
is split into four international 1
