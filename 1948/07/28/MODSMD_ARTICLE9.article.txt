hero at Star ford during the sum- j
mer quarter? How does the sum- j
mer quarter here compare with I
those at other colleges? Why did j
you decide to come to summer j
school?
These and many other questions
will appear on a two-page ques
tionnaire to be distributed next
week, Dr. Robert Bush of the Ap
pointment Service announced yes
terday.
"THE PURPOSE of the survey is i
to find out how the students feel
about the school and teachers; to
let them air their gripes; and to en
courage them to make suggestions
for improvement," Bush said.
The survey is the recommenda- j
tion of a committee formed by the i
late President Tresidder to study
the reasons for the lowering of en
rollment in the summer of 1947.
Actually, enrollment this summer
has reached a new record, but the
Administration feels that improve
ments can still be made.
THE QUESTIONNAIRE will be
distributed partly by mail and
partly on Quad. A return envelope
will be enclosed with each blank.
Dr. Bush requests that the com
pleted forms be returned as soon as
possible to speed up the publication
of the results.
"If we are going to improve our
educational efforts, it will take the
combined efforts of both the faculty
and the students. We welcome any
suggestions that any of you might
have to faciliitate this task," Dr.
Bush said.
