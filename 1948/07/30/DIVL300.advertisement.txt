Another day, another week, and
what's new? Not much. Oatmeal
Day came and went as silently as
a ghost only faintly intimating its
presence in the form of mid-term
exams.
Oatmeal Day, a forgotten aca
demic tradition, now almost as il
lusory as Zuleika Dobson day.
They say that Oatmeal Day had
its origin in Scottish Unversities
where the students were, so the
legend goes, exhorbitantly fond of
oatmeal. Whenever the young
Scot left the family place for col
lege, he took with him a sack of
oatmeal to keep him alive.
Then, about half-way through
the term the oatmeal would have
been used up, so the colleges would
have a holiday, Oatmeal Day, in
which the students would trudge
home for more.
You see. they didn't have The
Shack nearby, no 20% discount
system. Cod forbid.
