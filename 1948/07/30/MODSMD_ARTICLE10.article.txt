LUDWIGSHAFEN. C, erma ny ,
July 29 (UP). â€”Whispers of sabo
tage and Communist - sponsored
shouts of "War production!" echoed
today around the ruins of the big
I.G. Farben plant here, wrecked
yesterday by explosions which
killed an estimated 300 persons.
Some 2,500 persons were injured
by the unexplained blasts, which
set widespread fires and showered
rubble over this Rhine river port.
AMERICAN OFFICERS reported
that French authorities had ordered
an investigation of alleged sabotage
in connection with the disaster, but
French officials denied the reports.
Ludwigshafen is in the French
zone, across the Rhine from U.S.-
occupied territory.
In Berlin, Communist newspaper
and radio reporters blamed the
blast on "V-2 rocket fuel" which
they claimed was being illegally
manufactured in the big chemical
plant.
THE SOVIET - CONTROLLED
Berlin radio reported that Commu
nist-dominated political parties in
the German capital and the British
occupation zone had wired 're
grets" to the Ludwigshafen vic
tims, along with a demand that
"war production" be halted imme
diately.
Reinhardt Goldberg, a German
director of the Farben plant, re
jected the Communist claim that
rocket fuel or any other "danger
ous war product" was being man
ufactured here. Goldberg said that
the extent of the damage could not
yet be determined, but that it
would certainly amount to millions
of deutschemarks.
