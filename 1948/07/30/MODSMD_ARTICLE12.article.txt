LONDON, July 29 (UP). —Foreign Secretsry Ernest Bevin said
today that the government, believing the Berlin crisis might lead
to war, may decide to stop its whole demobilization program.

and some men due for discharge had been kept with the colors.

BUT IN HIS GRAVE statement
to the House of Commons he of
fered Russia, if she would lift the
Berlin blockade, a formal four
power conference on the highest
level to discuss not only Berlin and
other German problems but Euro
pean problems as a whole.
Discussing Britain's eagerness for
demobilization, Bevin said:
"... I must confess to the House
that in our calculations we did not
assume that the policy of our war
time allies might lead to a situation
which would involve the use of
force."
Bevin's statement regarding Rus
sia was probably the strongest in
its implications of any delivered b;.
a first-rank Allied statesman since
the war.
IT IS BELIEVED that it wa
made by agreement with the Unitec
States and France as a prelude tc
the delivery to Russian Foreigr
Minister Viacheslav Molotov of a
new communication on the Berlin
situation.
At the end of his formal state
ment, Bevin reached the more

Allied currency for the "present
difficulties" in Berlin.
