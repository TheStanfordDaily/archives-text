BERLIN, July 29 (UP).—Berlin's
city assembly, defying the wrath of
the Soviet army, condemned the
Russian blockade as "a crime
| against humanity" today in a tu-
I multuous session marked by a mass
Communist walkout.
A bitter resolution appealing "to
j the occupation powers and to the
world" demanded that the blockade
be lifted at once. It was approved
without a dissenting voice by some
100 deputies after Communist
j speaker Karl Littke and 30 fol
lowers stalked angrily from the
chamber.
The walkout, following yester
day's split of the Berlin police force
into Western and Eastern factions,
indicated the capital soon might be
ruled by two German administra
tions —one for the Soviet sector and
the other for the American. British,
and French, informed observers
believed.
