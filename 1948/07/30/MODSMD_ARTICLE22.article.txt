SO MANY nostalgic memories of
he "Old Stanford" are brought to
lie by this year's San Francisco
liters, that a visitor to the Menlo
raining camp would think the
M'er pro football team is owned,
Derated, and supported by Stan
ord itself.
Such is not the case, however.
: kit there are a lot of ex-Cards
loating around in grid togs plus a
i'W other guys whose names bring
lack memories of things Indian.
Back again, this year as team
•aptain. is Norm Standlee, 230-

and Bit; Chief of Stanford's 1941
se Bowl champions, still as rough
tid tough as ever.
Injured, but still on the 49er ros
. is Bruno Banducci, another of
• Wow Boys, supposedly out for

| a month with a shoulder injury he
i incurred early this week. Also an
: swering to the roll call is Hank
j Norberg, still another Wow Boy, an
old-timer at the flank position.
Add Jim Cox, guard in 1946 here
! at the Farm, and you have quite a
list.
AND, OF COURSE, the cutest
: little trick in all T formation his
| tory, Frank Albert, is back for an
| other session of masterminding and
pass flipping. Still, to our mind,
there is no one better in the busi
ness of T frolicking than the one
time Stanford All-American quar
! terback.
He is not as sure with the aerials,
| not much of a defensive player any
i more, but nevertheless the fanciest
ball handler who ever stooped un
der a center. And why not? He
j was only the qb who made the T
formation and Clark Shaughnessy
j popular back in the days when the
j T was considered "old-fashioned."
Take a look at Jim Lawfon, San
] Francisco line coach, who interned
J under Shaughnessy, later became
head coach here and left before he
ever had his own team.
DON'T FORGET the Scooter,
Forrest Hall, now halfbacking it for
j the 49ers, who scampered nearly a
hundred yards for a TD when USF
was here playing the Indians in
! 1946.
Nor Ernie Case, UCLA quarter
back; Dick SuseofT, Washington
! State end; or Joe Perry, Alameda
! Navy halfback (who stole the show
j against the Stanford junior varsity
I in a scrimmage last year), all of
' whom stuck hatchets in the In
j dians' backs at one time or another.
Slippriest of al! was Buck Shaw,
the Silver Fox of Santa Clara and
j present 49er head coach, who
i planned many a dastardly trick
against the Cards in years gone by.


OH. FRANKIE," they yelled
alumi the onetime All-American
quarterback took Stanford to the
I!I41 Hose Bowl. Now, Frankie
Albert is a mainstay with the

j was only the qb who made the T
formation and Clark Shaughnessy
j popular back in the days when the
j T was considered "old-fashioned."
Take a look at Jim Lawfon, San

J under Shaughnessy, later became
head coach here and left before he
ever had his own team.
DON'T FORGET the Scooter,
Forrest Hall, now halfbacking it for
j the 49ers, who scampered nearly a
hundred yards for a TD when USF
was here playing the Indians in

Nor Ernie Case, UCLA quarter

! Navy halfback (who stole the show
j against the Stanford junior varsity
I in a scrimmage last year), all of

Slippriest of al! was Buck Shaw,

against the Cards in years gone by.


OH. FRANKIE," they yelled

SO MANY nostalgic memories of

Such is not the case, however.

Back again, this year as team

list.
