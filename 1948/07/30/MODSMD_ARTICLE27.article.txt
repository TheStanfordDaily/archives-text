# Zetes Take Mural Win; Greeks Don't Show Up
## 
### 
Spearheaded by a tall forward
line and the spiking of Andy Post,
the Zetes smashed to the most ex
citing intramural volleyball win of
the quarter as they conquered the
Encina Basement 15-12, 13-15. and
15-7 Wednesday.
The Basement, led by Doug Mac
kay. was always within striking
distance because of the erratic
services of the Zete men. Midway
through the final contest Post and
his teammates broke the Basement
spirit with several well - placed
shots.
The softball game scheduled for
yesterday between Encina 2W and
the Greeks was forfeited by the
Greeks.
