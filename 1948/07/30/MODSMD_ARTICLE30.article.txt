Beginning next fall the foreign students on this campus will
have a special faculty advisor. This is something that has been
badly needed at Stanford.
There are two main reasons why students from other coun
tries come to American universities. One reason is to learn
American skills and American methods in the various fields. The
other reason, and an egually important one, is to establish greater
understanding between their countries and the United States.
Having an advisor of their own will enable them to find
answers to problems peculiar to their situation. Through his
advice they should become more aware of American customs,
and should be able to establish a smoother relationship with
American students in general.
It is to be regretted that international understanding on the
Stanford campus has fallen short of what it might have been.
One reason for this lack of good will has probably been that the
visitors do not fully understand the psychology of the American
mind.
A foreign student advisor is a big step tov/ard improving that
situation. And it is also a step toward a much bigger goal—
understanding between nations.
