## Cellar Critics 
### 
To the Editor:
Congratulations to the recent critics of the Union Cellar for their good
taste ("I got a friend who has been eating at the Cellar for over a year
now and he likes it better than eating out of garbage cans") and sound
criticism ("They are always crossing off certain dishes from the menu
which means that the manager doesn't know how to purchase food in cor
rect quantities.")
May I suggest to the first man that he take up creative writing—such
delicate phrasing, such beauty of line. To the second, I would suggest that
he inform the Cellar management where inexpensive crystal balls can be
obtained, balls which are capable of predicting with accuracy the eating
whims of Stanford students. Or should a surplus be ordered, and the
left-overs thrown away?
I've hashed in various places around school ever since I've been at
Stanford, and haven't yet met a Stanfordite who is capable of being
satisfied by service and/or food. Criticism is in many cases justified,
but why can't we be constructive, or at least pick a different beating boy
once in a while?
