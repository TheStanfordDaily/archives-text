Be that it is only July the twenty-eighth and several months from
Stanford's football trip to Los Angeles for the UCLA game, I consider this
day a proper time to forewarn innocent Indians what they shall probably
run into while visiting in the City of the Angels.
Most Stanford rooters like to return to school alive, and with at least
two bits in their purse, so this essay shall be devoted to a list of "Don'ts"
while in L.A.
Don't consider driving in anything less armored than a General Sherman
tank. While it is reported that a few human beings have lived after
motoring in a normal vehicle, I consider these stories ill-founded rumors.
Don't take a left turn on Wilshire Boulevard. Forest Lawn Memorial
Association didn't declare a dividend last year for nothing.
Don't eat at any of the fancy restaurants on Cahuenga Boulevard. You
can get much worse food at higher prices in a certain campus basement
hash house.
Ali draft-eligible young men. don't join any of those L.A. fairy com
mands. Better that you enlist in the Afgahanistian national guard.
Don't visit any of those Los Angeles psychiatrists. If you arc normal
and healthy compared to L.A. residents, you'll probably be diagnosed as
a complete maniac and shipped off to Agnew's.
If you run into a shapely blonde at a bar, don't. Just don't.
Don't do any shopping in those big department stores. Mose carries a
more complete line of garments at much lower rates.
Don't visit Pershing Square. The plaza was built only for pigeons and
communist soap box orators.
Don't dress in anything less conservative than a maroon lapeless
corduroy sport coat, diamond-studded horned rim glasses, and rainbow
striped suspenders. Any style of garb more conservative, and you will
be stoned to de i'h .\s m old fuddy-duddy reactionary.
If vou run int. another uttrjjtiv-j dimse' don't sot caught.
