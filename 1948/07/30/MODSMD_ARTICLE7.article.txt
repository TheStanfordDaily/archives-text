# Truman Price Bill Presented To Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 29 (UP).— i
President Truman today handed
Congress a bill to roll back prices '
to last November's level and clamp j
wartime controls on wages, distri- |
bution, and credit. But Republi
cans pronounced most of it unwise
and part of it unnecessary.
Chairman Jesse Wolcott, R., !
Mich., of the House Banking Com
mittee said the GOP Congress fa
vors tighter credit restrictions but
little else in Mr, Truman's pro
gram. Wolcott contended the Pres
ident already has authority to re
vive wartime curbs on installment
buying and other brakes on credit
expansion.
THE SINGLE - PACKAGE ad
ministration bill, wrapping up all
but one of the anti-inflation pro
posals which Mr. Truman made in
his speech to the special session
Tuesday, was formally introduced
in the Senate by Democratic Lead
er Alben W. Barkley.
It has no chance of passage. Re
publican leaders already have de
nounced its proposal as "police
state methods" which would "only
make matters worse."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics
said a rollback to last November's
level would mean a cut of about
5.1 per cent. It said living cost
items have come up an average of
28.8 per cent since June. 1946.
THE PRICES picked for a roll
back would remain under ceilings
until June 30, 1950.
Wage controls would be applied
only to industries under price con
trols. Even in those industries, em
ployers would be free to raise
wages voluntarily. But if they in
tended to use the wage rise as a
basis for requesting price increases,
i they would have to go before a
| federal wage board to get permis-
I sion for the pay hike.
