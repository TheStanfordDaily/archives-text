# Dixiecrats Begin Senate Filibuster
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 29 (UP).-
With an assist from Republican
leaders, the Senate's Southern
Democrats today opened a civil
rights filibuster that may tie up the
special session of Congress until it
adjourns.
Shortly after the chamber con
vened at noon, acting GOP Floor
Leader Kenneth S. Wherry, Neb.,
announced that since President
Truman called the anti-poll tax bil!
"one of the prime reasons" for call
ing the special session he was ask
ing the Senate to approve it.
Wherry had scarcely finished be
fore Sen. John C. Stennis, D., Miss.,
was on his feet demanding recog
nition. He got it, and the talka
thon was on.
The Southerners then got some
help from an unexpected quarter.
Sen. William E. Jenner. Râ€ž Ind.,
won recognition and launched into
a long speech accusing the adminis
tration of discouraging meat pro
duction.
When Jenner reached his last pe
riod, at 3:32 p.m. EDT., Alabama's
Lister Hill apparently feared there
might be a move under foot to
quash the filibuster.
He roared that he wanted to be
recognized. When the chair com
plied, he spoke softly.
"I thought the place was on fire,"
quipped Senate President Arthur
H. Vandenberg, R., Mich.
Senator Stewart, D., Tenn., was
talking when the Senate adjourned
until noon tomorrow. He didn't stop
until assured he could make a "few
more" remarks tomorrow.
