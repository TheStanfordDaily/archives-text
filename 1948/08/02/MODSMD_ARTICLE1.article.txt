# GOP Leaders Eye Windup By Saturday

### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (UP)
Republican leaders of the so
called do nothing congress still
were shooting for adjournment
Saturday, with flat repudiation
of President Truman's anti-in
flation program almost certain.
If the law-makers don't guit
by Saturday, they say adjournment
will come for sure a week later, on
Aug. 14.
The House headed into the new
week still with no business pend
ing. It spent most of last week in
recess, while a few committees held
hearings, one of them on Mr. Tru
man's requests.
THE SENATE PICKS IJP tomor
row where it left ofT Fridayâ€”in (he
midst of a Southern filibuster
against the anti-poll tax bill which
GOP leaders allowed to come up
for the frank purpose of blocking
other legislative action.
GOP chieftains now are promis
ing they will make every effort to
break the talkathon but are skep
tical of their chances.
The first move may be made by
Acting Senate Republican Leader
Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska.
He said today he is "inclined" to
file by tomorrow night a cloture,
or gag, petition, which would limit
debate on the bill, but he was
doubtful it would get enough sig
natures. Two-thirds of the Sena
tors present must favor cloture be
fore it can be invoked.
"IF THE SOUTHERN Democrats
won't support it and help speed
things up," said Wherry, "we'll let
the people decide who killed Cock
Robin." By that lie meant the
Democrats must take the blame if
the Senate passes no bills.
Chairman Robert A. Taft, R., 0.,
of the Senate Republican policy
committee, said the Senate leader
ship will seek an agreement tomor
row to bring the poll tax bill to the
lloor.
Taft, who is "hopeful" that Con
gress can adjourn Saturday, said all
other parliamentary efforts to get a
vote on the bill will be exhausted
by Wednesday. He declined to say
whether he would press for a clo
ture petition tomorrow, but did not
rule out such a nossibility.
WHERRY EMPHASIZED that lie
is "willing to stay here as long as
necessary" to consider any anti
infiation measures the Senate
Banking Committee deems neces
sary. But thus far the committee
hasn't hinted at any recommenda
tions, although there may be some
action on bank credit controls.
