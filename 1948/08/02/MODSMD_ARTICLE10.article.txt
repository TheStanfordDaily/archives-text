When you're in love
—I've heard it's true—
Everything's wonderful—
Skies are blue.
Now, I've got no doubt
This truth you'll find
About the lady—
Who's wined and dined.
But I've got a man
Who likes to sit home.
He might take me out,
If you print this poem.
—P.B.
He'd better or yo'll want to
know the reason why.
need more literate scribblings
Now. to change the subject, we
to fill up The Space. So, send them
to Uncic Willie, care of
You Know Where
at least you ought to by this time.
