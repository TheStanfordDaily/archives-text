Bobby Rosburg, Stanford's bad
boy golfer, took second prize in
Saturday's hole-in-one tournament
sponsored by the PALO club at the
Peninsula Fairways. Rosburg led
all men entrants with a shot that
stopped 13 inches from the cup. 125
yards away from the tee.
However, the Stanford linksman
was second to a- mere slip of a girl,
a Miss Craig of Los Gatos, who
knocked the ball three inches from
the cup. Rosburg. however, won a
sport coat donated by Roos Broth
ers for his efforts.
