# U.S. for Many Years Is Track Monopolist
## 
### 
Monopolization of the Olympic
Games by the United States is no
new trick, and it the present games
in London go according to Hoyle
from here on out, U.S. strength will
be scratched all over the record
books when the Olympic torch i*
extinguished two weeks hence.
Until this year, Olympic men's
swimming records were held solely
by American and Japanese athletes.
But with the absence of Japan at
this year's Olympics, it is possible
several new marks may be added
to the books by United States na
tators.
Jack Medica, with a 400-meter
freestyle mark of 4:44.5 in the 1936
Games, holds one of the world
marks for the United States." The
only other one is possessed by
Adolph Kiefer, whose 100 - meter
backstroke time of 1:05.9 stiil
stands. Other than that, Japan
dominates the water events.
FX TRACK AND FIELD, Ameri
can record holders are as abundant
as flies on flypaper. They include
the great Jesse Owens in both
sprints — 10.2 and 20.7 — and Bi! 1
Cair, the quarter-miler who beat
out Stanford's Ben Eastman in the
1932 Games, with a 46.2 record.
Others are. Forrest Towns, high
hurdles; Glenn Hardin, 400-meter
lows; Corny Johnson, high jump;
Owens, broad jump; Earl Meadows,
pole vault; and Ken Carpenter,
discus.
It is expected that this year's final
tally sheet will erase most of the
old records.
Glenn Morris' record of 7.900
points under the modern scoring
system in the decathlon will be
under fire this week as Tulare's
Bob Mathias gives the 10 - event
grind all he has. James Bausch,
also of the U.S., won it in 1932. A
United States victory in the event
this vear would make it three
straight.
THE OTHER COUNTRIES which

broke into the American monopoly
in 1936, when we won 12 events,
oddly enough were tiny Finland,
Japan, Great Britain, New Zealand
(Jack Lovelock), and Germany.
Finland, back for more in this
year's Olympics, harbored three
championships: 5,000 and 10,000
meters and 3,000 - meter steeple
chase,
Germany, then in the throes of
the Nazi tyranny, throttled three
events in which the United States
supposedly was favored. They took
the hammer throw, shot put, and
javelin. Britain captured two titles
—the 50,000-meter walk (from here
to Timbuktu) and 1,600-meter re
lay—while New Zealand's Lovelock
won the popular 1,500-meter race,
Olympics' answer to the mile run.

American girl who should break an
Olympic record would be the only
one of her country to break into j
the ranks. Records are shared by
Holand, with lour, and Japan, with
one.
Diving, solely a United States
specia'ty, has been in our hands
almost every time out. In 1936,
Americans Dick Degener and Mar
shall Wayne won the men's division
and Marjorie Gestring and Poyn
ton Hill won for the women.
Any further records and victories
in the 1948 Olympic Games will
tighten the stranglehold the United
States holds on the world - wide
competition.

American girl who should break an
Olympic record would be the only
one of her country to break into j
the ranks. Records are shared by
Holand, with lour, and Japan, with
one.
Diving, solely a United States
specia'ty, has been in our hands
almost every time out. In 1936,
Americans Dick Degener and Mar
shall Wayne won the men's division
and Marjorie Gestring and Poyn
ton Hill won for the women.
Any further records and victories
in the 1948 Olympic Games will
tighten the stranglehold the United
States holds on the world - wide
competition.
Monopolization of the Olympic
Games by the United States is no
new trick, and it the present games
in London go according to Hoyle
from here on out, U.S. strength will
be scratched all over the record
books when the Olympic torch i*
extinguished two weeks hence.
Until this year, Olympic men's
swimming records were held solely
by American and Japanese athletes.
But with the absence of Japan at
this year's Olympics, it is possible
several new marks may be added
to the books by United States na
tators.
Jack Medica, with a 400-meter
freestyle mark of 4:44.5 in the 1936
Games, holds one of the world
marks for the United States." The
only other one is possessed by
Adolph Kiefer, whose 100 - meter
backstroke time of 1:05.9 stiil
stands. Other than that, Japan
dominates the water events.
FX TRACK AND FIELD, Ameri
can record holders are as abundant
as flies on flypaper. They include
the great Jesse Owens in both
sprints — 10.2 and 20.7 — and Bi! 1
Cair, the quarter-miler who beat
out Stanford's Ben Eastman in the
1932 Games, with a 46.2 record.
Others are. Forrest Towns, high
hurdles; Glenn Hardin, 400-meter
lows; Corny Johnson, high jump;
Owens, broad jump; Earl Meadows,
pole vault; and Ken Carpenter,
discus.
It is expected that this year's final
tally sheet will erase most of the
old records.
Glenn Morris' record of 7.900
points under the modern scoring
system in the decathlon will be
under fire this week as Tulare's
Bob Mathias gives the 10 - event
grind all he has. James Bausch,
also of the U.S., won it in 1932. A
United States victory in the event
this vear would make it three
straight.
THE OTHER COUNTRIES which

broke into the American monopoly
in 1936, when we won 12 events,
oddly enough were tiny Finland,
Japan, Great Britain, New Zealand
(Jack Lovelock), and Germany.
Finland, back for more in this
year's Olympics, harbored three
championships: 5,000 and 10,000
meters and 3,000 - meter steeple
chase,
Germany, then in the throes of
the Nazi tyranny, throttled three
events in which the United States
supposedly was favored. They took
the hammer throw, shot put, and
javelin. Britain captured two titles
—the 50,000-meter walk (from here
to Timbuktu) and 1,600-meter re
lay—while New Zealand's Lovelock
won the popular 1,500-meter race,
