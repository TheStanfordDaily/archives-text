# Encima 2W Pipes Blast Out Win Over Encima 3W Softballers, 17-3
## 
### 
Behind the superlative four - hit
hurling of Gil Jonas, the Encina 2W
Pipes blasted their counterparts
from 3W to tiny atoms by the as
tounding margin of 17-15 in an ab
breviated five-inning tilt, Saturday
morning.
The JW nine hopped on Jonas for
two quick runs in the first frame
on a walk and a fly-ball double but
the Pipes came back in the last half
of the canto with three big markers
as they batted around. The 3W's
added one more tally in the next
inning only to have all fury break

loose upon losing Hurler Harry
Shelton as the Pipes caine back
with eight runs in their half to
forge far ahead. Shelton, however,
was the victim of some extremely
shabby support in the field.
Jonas settled down and permitted
only one hit in the last three
frames. The Pipes' 18 - hit attack
was led by Bob Thornton, Noorl
Ibrahin, Bob Greene, and Jonas,
who garnered three hits apiece.
