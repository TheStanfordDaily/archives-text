## Foreign Scholarships 
### 
The student body foreign scholarships program has been a
source of controversy at Stanford ever since it was first proposed.
Even after the student body voted to put the plan into effect, it
did not cease to pose problems.
The way in which Excom set about to make the necessary
arrangements was "casual" at best. The student appointed to
supervise the program did not do so adequately. It was only
after summer quarter had started that it became evident just how
little had been done.
That this was a source of embarrassment to Summer Excom !
was demonstrated by the efficiency with which they began anew
to set up the program.
And now that the names of scholarship recipients have been
announced, some students find that they are dissatisfied with
the people chosen.
We refer to the choice of a German Naval officer and a Fin
nish artillery officer.
The agency through which the names were cleared certifies
to the fact that the former German Naval officer was not a Nazi
and did not believe in Nazi doctrines.
The fact that he has recently been working with the United
States claims team would seem to be another point in his favor. |
The Finnish artillery officer likewise has points in his favor.
With only eight scholarships to award, and with all of Europe
to choose from, the selection might have excluded members of i
the armed forces of World War II enemy nations.
The other point of view, and the one which we feel compelled
to support, is that the war is over. Regardless of how dark the
world situation looks, that war, the one that engendered all the
hate and prejudice, is over.
We can only defeat our own purposes by being narrow now.
We may learn something from association on a college level
with these people.
It's certain that we will gain nothing in isolating ourselves
from either them or their ideologies.
