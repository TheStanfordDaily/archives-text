## A 						Few Words 
### 
To the Editor:
I have a few words to say on the subject of our invitation to a German
naval officer and a Finnish artillery officer to be our guests next year. :
My remarks are admittedly non-Christian, charitable or any other soft- !
headed pap used to describe people who pet mad dogs.
They are motivated by the fact that both these men are nationals of
countries with which we are still at war; by the fact that they and fanatics |
like them took three and a half years of my life, and I'm lucky because I
I got back in relatively the same condition as I left; by the fact that many
of my friends and many of yours and many of nearly everyone's around j
here will never come back; by the fact that I can't forget how they J
massacred our troops whenever they thought they could get away with 1
it; by these facts and an infinity like them.
I say that if these people come over here they should be taken care
of the way we used to take care of their comrades when the war was a
little hotter than it is now. They were raised on hate and evil. The only
way to rid the world of that attitude is to start on its apologists.
I say that they should be distributed up and down Palm Drive in small
pieces if they ever set foot on the Stanford campus. Who agrees with me?
