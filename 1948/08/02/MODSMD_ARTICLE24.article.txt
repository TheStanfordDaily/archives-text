# Mr. Halleck's Record
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I thought reader Rufus Hayden might know something encouraging
about Representative Hal leek's record when he accused Bletz of criticizing
his international votes because "he does not dare challenge Halleck's
stand on domestic issues." Perhaps, I thought, I have had a mistaken
opinion of Halleck, but it serves me right for falling for a smooth argument
of that Mr. Bletz who follows the pink CIO line so assiduously.
Then I read 011 and discovered that Mr. Hayden's researches, admittedly
more probing that my own, uncovered a stand by Halleck on domestic
issues which really did not surprise me at all, in view of his stand on for
eign affairs: that, in fact, he voted for the Taft-Hartley law and against
prtce controls, votes which contrary to Mr. Hayden I do not believe the
American people wholeheartedly supported, if the American people can
be classed as one homogeneous group with n single mind. Perhaps if J
the Mundt-Nixon bill had ever come to a vote, Representative Halleck, !
reflecting "public" opinion, would have voted for it. too.
I think Blot? has a point. I shudder to think not only where we would j
bo today if Mr. Halleck determined the foreign policy of this country,
which was Mr. Bletz's apprehension, but also where we will be it men
like Halleck have the last word on domestic issuer
