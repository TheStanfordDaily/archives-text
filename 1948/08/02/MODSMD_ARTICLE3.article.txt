Patrons of the Stanford Players
J witnessed an unusual and signifi-
I cant experiment in the theater last
: weekend. In "L'Arlesienne," the
Players presented what was essen
tially a 19th-century French melo
drama as a pathos - filled drama
without all the conventional melo
dramatic stage devices.
They showed quite a bit of in
tegrity in choosing to produce the
play in the form they did. It was
a form very like the original, and
as such, not completely within the
realm of appreciation of a great
many members of the audience.
The play suffered from what was
obviously a poor translation at
times, but acting of the principals
and a fine supporting cast helped
| pass over the rough spots.
Aline MacMahon was outstand
j ing in her part as the strong-willed
peasant woman, Rose Mamai; as
was Whitford Kane as the wise and
j kindly shepherd whose words of
j prophecy keynote the play.
Theodore Marcuse, playing Fre
deri Mamai, seemed to have a
sympathetic understanding of the
part but was hampered by espe
cially poor lines.
Frances Waller seemed to have
over - simplified her part as the

peasant girl, Vivette Renaud. Roy
Poole was excellent as Marc, and
Walt Witcov 'er was very amusing
as the long-suffering crew.
Richard Hawkins did a good job,
and Jack Sheehy played (he In
nocent with veteran skill and un
derstanding.
Bizet's music, conducted by Dr.
Jan Popper, added greatly to the
performance. All four sets by Wen
dell Cole were splendid, but the
last scene, the corridor outside
Frederi's room, was extremely ef
fective.
T'he lighting was the best we
have seen around here for a long
time.


A LINE MacMAIION, artist in residence at Stanford this summer,
whose performance in "L'Arlesienne" was an outstanding part of (hat
production. She will be seen with Clarence Derwenl and WhUford
Kane in "The Rivals" August 12, E5, and 14.
