# Coeds Glitter At AWS Party
## 
### JIM THURBER 
Formats and white coats filled the
main lounge of the Women's Club
house as the AWS put on their
summer formal last Saturday night.
In floor-length taffeta and organ
die creations for the first time this
summer, the girls on campus
showed the boys what could really
be done to a dance if enough time
were put into it.
The decorations committee, with
the theme of "Summer Starlight,"
transformed the lounge into a
beautiful star - studded terrace.
Close to a thousand ornate stars
decorated the walls and ceiling,
while sott blue lights played around
the room and on the fountain out
side.
The smooth notes of the saxo
phone of Harry Diner filled the
ballroom from 10 until I and helped
to make the dance one of the most
successful this summer.
In the lower lounge of the club
house, Sue Inskeep and her helpers
kept a liberal supply of punch and
cookies on the table, great quan
tities of which were consumed
throughout the evening.
