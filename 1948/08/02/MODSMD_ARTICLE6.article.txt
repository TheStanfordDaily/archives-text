TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 1 (UP).
â€” Sporadic fighting on all three
Palestine fronts was reported today
amid fears in this Jewish capital
that the truce may break down at
any time.
United Nations mediator Count
Folke Bernadotte is expected in Je
rusalem tomorrow from his Rhodes
headquarters to investigate the in
creased number of complaints of
truce violations by Arabs and
Jews.
(In Rhodes, Bernadotte said he
had asked the UN to speed up
sending observers and equipment
to supervise the truce. More men
and equipment are needed to cope
with complaints from both sides, he
said.
