MOSCOW, Aug. 1. (UP) â€”Western allied diplomats have
; asked for a conference with Premier Josef Stalin so they can ask
him personally to lift the Berlin blockade and agree to a full
' scale four-power conference on the entire German situation, high
: sources said today.
A French embassy source confirmed the report that repre-

of France, Britain, and
the U.S. have asked to go direct to
Stalin. This source said Foreign
Minister Molotov is considering the
request.
There had been no word by to
night whether Stalin would receive
the Western representatives. It was
expected that such word probably
would come tomorrow, but the pos
sibility was not overlooked that
several days may elapse before
anything definite is known.
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD the
Western powers will suggest a news
; blackout when, and if, discussions
with Stalin or Molotov begin. No
further news is expected from here
I until a simultaneous announcement
can be made from Moscow, Paris,
London, and Washington upon the
progress of negotiations.
Frank Roberts, British Foreign
Secretary Ernest Bevin's private
secretary, dined tonight with U.S.
Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith
at Spaso House, the U.S. embassy
in Moscow. Experts from the three
Western embassies met to co-ordi
nate briefs to be sent to their capi
tals.

I agency in Frankfurt, reported to

Western representatives Sunday or
I Monday. In Washington, the State

j representatives said a simple, two
point plan was agreed on at a Lon
don conference. He said the first
point seeks elimination of transpor
tation difficulties in Germany. The

eign ministers and probably on the
basis of the Eastern European na
tions' Warsaw declaration giving
their formula for German unifica
