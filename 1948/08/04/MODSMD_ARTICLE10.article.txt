### 
A revised appraisal system, under
which veterans will be advised in

homes they wish to buy with GI
loans, has none into effect. tlie Vet
erans Administration at San Fran
cisco announced.
The plan calls for direct assign
ment of appraisers by VA in the
case of all houses appraised as
completed dwellings.
Appraisal of a property to de
termine reasonable value for pur
poses of GI loan financing can be
requested by a potential veteran
buyer, the owner of the property, a
real estate broker, or a lending
agency.
Upon completion of his assign
ment the appraiser will submit his
report direct to the VA, together
with a letter to the potential vet
eran buyer. The letter will outline
in simple language, any major de
ficiencies in the building which
may have been observed by the
appraiser.
