This is the story of the Palo Alto
Live Oaks, or the PALO club as it
is commonly called. The Live Oaks
wert started by three young vet
erans of Palo Alto. Sam Troedfon,
James Rafferty, and Ralph Feicht
meir, who intended to pattern their
organization after the Spokane
Round Table, famous for its good
works in that Washington city.
Organized nearly two years ago,
the club has grown to a member
ship of more than 200. Its purpose
is to promote recreational activity
for the youth of the entire Palo
Alto region. That it has succeeded
is evident from the tremendous
turnout at the club's first annual
Boys' Day, held last year. Two
thousand boys and some 600 dads
turned out, and everything was
free including hot dogs, popcorn,
and soft drinks. In addition the club
has sponsored such affairs as a box
ing tourney for the youngsters.
FUNDS FOR THIS worthwhile
organization are gathered partially
from membership lees and contri
butions, but mainly by their annual
hole-in-one tournament. Last year
the tournament drew several thou
sand contestants during its running,
and a total of 8,438 shots were
taken at the green a hundred yards
away. This year the tournament is
being held at the same place, the
Peninsula Fairways on El Camino
Real just north of Mountian View.
During the three days that the
tournament has run, more than
4,000 shots have been made, indi
cating that the old record will be
shattered early in the tourney.

| Last year's winner was Mike j
I Rossi, proprietor of a local bever
! age - dispensing parlor, who has
i
| never broken 100 on a golf course, j
Despite that fact, Mike won $750
worth of prizes, including the first,
second, and fourth grand prizes.
| His winning shot was a mere half- (
I inch from the cup.
PHIZES THIS YEAR include
several radio - phonographs, sport
i coats, building materials, etc., and. 1
i as usual, a $1,000 bond for each
I hole in one. Special prizes are given |
to women contestants, and I would
advise any girl golfers on the Farm
to go down this week. The number |
of women entrants is small. Mon
j day night only two women took
j tries at the first prize, and the win
ner was more than nine feet away
from the cup. The prize for girls
tonight is a multiple award con
[ sisting of three pairs of nylons and
I a merchandise order for cosmetics.
Tuesday, Aug. 10, will be Ladies'
Day, and a steeling silver sugar and
cream set valued at $45 will be
awarded for the closest shot. Go
on down, girls, and win yourselves
some prizes. If I can do it (what
I'm going to do with a pop-up
toaster, I don't know) anybody can. |
Before closing, I v/ould like to
extend a hearty invitation for any
one who wants a quick trip to Salt
Lake City, Cheyenne, or Omaha in
a 1042 Chevy with new tires and
a radio to join me Saturday morn
i ing, Aug. 28. Just drop a line to
1 Box 1533, campus.

This is the story of the Palo Alto
Live Oaks, or the PALO club as it
is commonly called. The Live Oaks
wert started by three young vet
erans of Palo Alto. Sam Troedfon,
James Rafferty, and Ralph Feicht
meir, who intended to pattern their
organization after the Spokane
Round Table, famous for its good
works in that Washington city.
Organized nearly two years ago,
the club has grown to a member
ship of more than 200. Its purpose
is to promote recreational activity
for the youth of the entire Palo
Alto region. That it has succeeded
is evident from the tremendous
turnout at the club's first annual
Boys' Day, held last year. Two
thousand boys and some 600 dads
turned out, and everything was
free including hot dogs, popcorn,
and soft drinks. In addition the club
has sponsored such affairs as a box
ing tourney for the youngsters.
FUNDS FOR THIS worthwhile
organization are gathered partially
from membership lees and contri
butions, but mainly by their annual
hole-in-one tournament. Last year
the tournament drew several thou
sand contestants during its running,
and a total of 8,438 shots were
taken at the green a hundred yards
away. This year the tournament is
being held at the same place, the
Peninsula Fairways on El Camino
Real just north of Mountian View.
During the three days that the
tournament has run, more than
4,000 shots have been made, indi
cating that the old record will be
shattered early in the tourney.

| Last year's winner was Mike j
I Rossi, proprietor of a local bever
! age - dispensing parlor, who has
i
| never broken 100 on a golf course, j
Despite that fact, Mike won $750
worth of prizes, including the first,
second, and fourth grand prizes.
| His winning shot was a mere half- (
I inch from the cup.
PHIZES THIS YEAR include
several radio - phonographs, sport
i coats, building materials, etc., and. 1
i as usual, a $1,000 bond for each
I hole in one. Special prizes are given |
