# Russ Plug Berlin Supply Line Gaps; Friction Develops Among Germans

BERLIN, Aug. 3. (UP)—The Communist wing of Berlin's split police
force strengthened the Soviet blockade today with new regulations that
made western German travel virtually impossible for Berliners.
Simultaneously, the non-Communist police were demanding the im
mediate release of four of its officers, who were allegedly seized by au
thorities in the Soviet sector.
THE NEW PASS regulations plugged up one of the few remaining holes
in the Soviet land and water blockade of Berlin—the lesser roads by which
Germans had been able to travel to the west despite the "emergency"
closedown of allied road and rail links.
The new rules were proclaimed in paid advertisements inserted in
Communist newspapers by the "Rump headquarters" of Moscow-trained
Police President Paul Markgraf.
THE SOVIET-LICENSED ADN news agency said tonight that Gen.
Lucius D. Clay soon would be replaced as U. S. Military Governor of
Germany by either Gen. Mark Clark, former Military Governor of Austria,
or Lt. Gen. Alfred C. Wedemeyer.
American authorities scoffed at the report, terming it "pure and straight
Russian propaganda efforts to discredit Gen. Clay."'
Developments in the Berlin crisis were limited to friction among Ger
mans. The focus of the inter-allied controversy had moved further east
—to Moscow.
