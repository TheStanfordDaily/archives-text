## Policy on Letters 
### 
In the first issue of summer quarter, we explained what the
general policy of The Daily would be. We concluded by saying,
"We welcome your ideas and criticisms. We will be glad to
print all the letters for which we have space in our Campus
Opinion column."
At this time it might not be inappropriate to again reiterate
our policy on letters to the editor.
We will be glad to print as many letters as we have space for,
provided they are in reasonably good taste, signed, and are not
libelous.
We have withheld the names of writers only in those cases
where the letters were signed, and where the writers requested
that their names not be used. We do not print letters which
come to us unsigned.
If those people who have written letters which they did not
sign, or on which the signature was typewritten, will come in
and sign them, we will be glad to print them.
