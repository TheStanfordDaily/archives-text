# CAMPUS OPINION
## Foreign Scholarships 
### 
To the Editor:
Orchids to The Daily for its broad-minded outlook on our foreign
scholarship program. Stinkweeds to the bigoted and unthinking writei
who calls himself, anonymously, "Wounded Student Veteran."
Who is he to call would-be foreign students fanatics? His words are
the sort of tanatical drivel that poured from the dictators who forced many
subjects to war on peace-loving nations.
It is very disheartening to find that some so-called "educated" people
still believe that force is the logical way to solve differences. It might
be well for these people to read the preamble to the Constitution of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. It says
in part: "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men
that the defenses of peace must be constructed."
The underlying causes of controversies between nations are covetous
ness, mistrust, and misunderstanding. The only solution to world amity,
then, is a dispelling of these social maladies through a free univeisal
exchange of ideas.
The Stanford foreign scholarship program is a step in the right direc
tion. Let's not step backward and allow personal prejudice and misguided
thinking to hinder our progress. After all, the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself. When we begin to fear foreign ideologies, then we have
lost confidence in our own way of life.

To the Editor:
I agree with the wounded student veteran. Only those who have not
seen the victims of Nazi horror canp rate about the Golden Rule or
Christianity in dealing with Germany today.
Perhaps I should not be vindictive for our guest will be a "good'"
German; i.e., one who will not tell the stories that he told his buddies
a few years back of how he gleefully shelled an unarmed lifeboat, 01 how
his civilian brother beat to death wounded American flyers.

To the Editor:
Through you, I would like to try to give a fair reply to the Wounded
Student Veteran whose letter appeared in The Daily of August 2, 1948.
Dear Fellow Veteran:
I did not have the misfortune to be wounded as badly as you were in
this last war. And I'm afraid you don't realize how badly wounded you
wore. Supposedly, we fought to preserve the qualities ol liberty which
seem even now to be uniquely owned by only a few countries of the
world. We seem to be faced already with the threat of another and
greater war. Is it possible to avoid this threat? If so, how.' By contin
uing an active hate for people whom God let be born German, Japanese,
Russian? I don't tihink so, because it is much too easy to pick up a gun
and shoot a man you hate.
How about the other side of the question? If you should meet this guy
from"the other side of the tracks," isn't it just possible that he may be
as human as any of us? That he may have feelings of hate, anger, love,
hunger? If you should meet this guy with an open mind, isn t there a
possibility you might like him? And then, do you think it would be easy
to shoot a man you like? If you do, then I can only hope that someday
God will help you on the right path.
Personally, I would like to meet this German, and the Finn, also. I
would like to find out if they are right guys, or heels, as you think. I
should like to find out how they think and why they think that way. It
isn't necessary for me to share their views any more than it's necessary
for me to share yours. And if I disagree with them, it is one of America's
great cusfoms that I should try to help them on what I think is the right
path, just as I'm trying to heip you. This is not a policy of being soft, it
is one of common sense. If we try to like and understand each other, we
will have peace. I fwe do not. then we are taking the one greatest step
toward conflict.
The rare opportunity for meeting and understanding men whose ideol
ogies and circumstances forced them to fight against us has been offered
to the students of Stanford Isn't it plain fairness to give it an honest
trial?

and shoot a man you hate.
How about the other side of the question? If you should meet this guy
from"the other side of the tracks," isn't it just possible that he may be
as human as any of us? That he may have feelings of hate, anger, love,
hunger? If you should meet this guy with an open mind, isn t there a
possibility you might like him? And then, do you think it would be easy
to shoot a man you like? If you do, then I can only hope that someday
God will help you on the right path.
Personally, I would like to meet this German, and the Finn, also. I
would like to find out if they are right guys, or heels, as you think. I
should like to find out how they think and why they think that way. It
isn't necessary for me to share their views any more than it's necessary
for me to share yours. And if I disagree with them, it is one of America's
great cusfoms that I should try to help them on what I think is the right
path, just as I'm trying to heip you. This is not a policy of being soft, it
is one of common sense. If we try to like and understand each other, we
will have peace. I fwe do not. then we are taking the one greatest step
toward conflict.
The rare opportunity for meeting and understanding men whose ideol
ogies and circumstances forced them to fight against us has been offered
to the students of Stanford Isn't it plain fairness to give it an honest
trial?

scholarship program. Stinkweeds to the bigoted and unthinking writei
who calls himself, anonymously, "Wounded Student Veteran."
Who is he to call would-be foreign students fanatics? His words are
the sort of tanatical drivel that poured from the dictators who forced many
subjects to war on peace-loving nations.
It is very disheartening to find that some so-called "educated" people
still believe that force is the logical way to solve differences. It might
be well for these people to read the preamble to the Constitution of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. It says
in part: "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men
that the defenses of peace must be constructed."
The underlying causes of controversies between nations are covetous
ness, mistrust, and misunderstanding. The only solution to world amity,
then, is a dispelling of these social maladies through a free univeisal
exchange of ideas.
The Stanford foreign scholarship program is a step in the right direc
tion. Let's not step backward and allow personal prejudice and misguided
thinking to hinder our progress. After all, the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself. When we begin to fear foreign ideologies, then we have

Student Veteran whose letter appeared in The Daily of August 2, 1948.
Dear Fellow Veteran:
I did not have the misfortune to be wounded as badly as you were in
this last war. And I'm afraid you don't realize how badly wounded you
wore. Supposedly, we fought to preserve the qualities ol liberty which
seem even now to be uniquely owned by only a few countries of the
world. We seem to be faced already with the threat of another and
greater war. Is it possible to avoid this threat? If so, how.' By contin
uing an active hate for people whom God let be born German, Japanese,
Russian? I don't tihink so, because it is much too easy to pick up a gun
and shoot a man you hate.
How about the other side of the question? If you should meet this guy
from"the other side of the tracks," isn't it just possible that he may be
as human as any of us? That he may have feelings of hate, anger, love,
hunger? If you should meet this guy with an open mind, isn t there a
