The film entitled "There Is No India," presented by Mr. Deane
Dickason at the Memorial Theater last Tuesday, luly 27, was in
deed very interesting. Undoubtedly Mr. Dickason has undergone
a lot of trouble to produce such a documentary film and for this
every Indian should feel very grateful.
Since he stated that the film was the result of an objective study

of the conditions there, for the sake
of objective study alone I feel cer
tain facts should be pointed out.
First of all, let us examine the
title "There Is No India." He stated
that there was and is no India. He
also expressed doubt whether there
ever shall be any India. He said,
however, it is the British who made
"India," if at all it can be called
India. Before anything of the coun
try's history is said, it should be
pointed out that we would be con
sidering the history of a country
which spread over thousands of
years. Any student of history will
admit that there was a highly inte
grated India in the Hindu Period
from the Great Asoka's time, in the
Moghul Period, and in the British
Period despite the differences in
forms of government. It is yet to
be seen where a nation can be uni
form throughout its history.
ON HEARING Mr. Dickason, one
should be quite convinced about
the glory of the British Period. If
the credit for integrating geograph
ical India is to go to the British, a
student of history has no other al
ternative but to lay the blame at
the door of the British for practi
cally disintegrating India economi
cally, socially, and politically.
History evidences the fact that
India was a very prosperous coun
try even during the first phase of
British rule. As a matter of fact,
even British historians admit that
the Industrial Revolution in Britain
was practically financed out of the
lootings in India. If the British are
to be credited for the recent de
velopments, one wonders who is to
be blamed for the poverty and mis
ery in India today. Railroads in
India were not constructed with the
objective of developing the country
but to facilitate exploitation and
transportation of troops to keep the
people under subjugation.
THE BRITISH cannot claim the
credit for industrialization. The de
velopments have been against their
most directed opposition and ob
struction. The largest steel works
in the British Commonwealth is not

a pyramid of the glory of the Brit
ish but the monument of their ob
struction. As a matter of fact I pity
the British for their foolishness and
lack of vision in not knowing how
to exploit most effectively. They
did not want to develop the country
but keep it under subjugation as a
supplying source of agricultural
products and a good market for
British products.
TIIE POVERTY, misery, and low
standard of living of the masses is
a fact. But the film failed utterly
to show the growth of a vast num
ber of middle-class people who are
comparable to the American mid
dle class in most respects.
The superstitions and prejudices
are not an inherent thing but an
outgrowth of economic poverty
consequent to ruthless exploitation.
However, the National Government
of India has put into operation an
effective program for educating the
people. An objective study of India
should surely indicate the lack of
such educational programs during
the British regime.
The film lias shown very little of
the many big and expanding edu
cational institutions in various
parts of the country.
In conclusion I would, however,
like to express my deep apprecia
tion to Mr. Dickason for a beauti
fully produced film which, regard
less of its faults, must surely have
inspired interest in many people
and as a whole added materially to
their knowledge of the very real
and beautiful country which is my
motherland.
