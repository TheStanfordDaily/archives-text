DINAH'S
SMORGASBORD
A sharpie of our asquaintancc
who considers himself quite .1 hand j
when it comcs to soci.il relation
hips with young Indies is in the
liabit of expressing himself on this I
■ übject from time to time.
One time, for instance, he ob
served th.it .1 gentleman should
never take . . . candy away from
babies unless he has had the skill
to make the babies want to give it
lwny. What this has to do with
voung Indies is quite beyond us, but
t seemed of .1 great deal of im
portance to him.
Another of his observations was
that young ladies should go with
elder men—he was an older man,
\ou sec—and that younger men
' hould go with older women. This,
he assured us, would assure the
•table evolution of the social insti
tutions concerned with people go
ing with people.
Ho hum. It doesn't make any
difference who you go with, just
o long as you go to THE SHACK
—dancing ten 'til two.
