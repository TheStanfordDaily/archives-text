YOU DON'T LEAVE Mel Patton on the blocks twice, as some of his
bitterest rivals found out this week in the 200-meter final at London.
After Patton had been plastered over several national magazine covers
recently and then finished a dismal fifth in the 100 meters Saturday, there
were many who said he was all washed up, and should be counted out of
the running in the longer furlong event.
Pell-Mel, Tuesday, was out to prove they were wrong.
HE ALSO HAD another argument to settle. Ever since the famous 9.3
hundred in Fresno on May 15 when he edged out Lloyd Laßeach, experts
had claimed Laßeach closed so fast at the tape that he could beat Patton
at any time over the longer 220 route.
The two sprinters had met only one time since then—at 99 yards—in
the Coliseum Relays the following week, and Laßeach trailed Patton by
three yards.
In London Tuesday they met for the first time this year over 200
meters (one and a half yards short of a 220). Also entered in the final
were Barney Ewell, dangerous Herb McKenley (who had beaten Patton
in the semi-final heat), and Cliff Bourland, the ex-Trojan.
All five were American trained—Ewell at Penn State, McKenley at
Illinois, Laßeach at Wisconsin and UCLA, and Patton and Bourland at
use.
PATTON PROVED the experts wrong, leading the pack to the wire
in 21.1, four-tenths of a second off Jesse Owens' Olympic record for the
event around one turn.
Second was Ewell; third, the galloping Laßeach; fourth, McKenley:
and fifth, Bourland.
Perhaps Time Magazine's cover was not such a jinx after all.
WHEN CHARLEY FONVILLE failed to make the Olympic shot put
trio, the Americans fans moaned and groaned that our best representative
would not be present in London. Fonville had recently muscled the 16-
pound ball over 58 feet for a new world's record.
In London, with the blue chips down, LAAC's Wilbur (Moose) Thomp
son defeated his American teammate, Jim Delaney of the San Francisco
•Olympic Club, with a mighty heave of 56 feet 2Vii inches.
A few years back, before the late A 1 Blozis of Georgetown appeared on
the scene, that would have been almost good enough for a new world's
record.
AN OLYMPIC RULE in field events that a qualifying mark does not
stand in the finals kept Martin Biles of the Olympic Club from getting
second in the javelin throw Wednesday.
Biles tossed the spear 222 feet in the trials, but in the finals his worn
out arm could do but 213 feet.
But the rule really isn't so unfair after all. Sprinters who run a
100-meter heat are not given final places according to that time if they
should by accident finish last in a 10.8 race.
Nevertheless Biles probably winced as he took sixth place. Second went
to Steve Seymour of Los Angeles at 221 feet.
OLYMPIC ODDITY: The only events in which the United States placed
1-2-3 were the shot put and high hurdles—the two events in which!the
U.S.' best men (Fonville and Dillard) did not compete.
