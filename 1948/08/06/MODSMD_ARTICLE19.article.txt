# Pipes Beaten By Basement In Volleyball
## 
### 
With a methodical display of pow
er, the Encina Basement blasted
Encina 2W Pipes from the ranks of
the unbeaten in the volleyball
murals, 15-3, 15-10. Wednesday.
The Basement aggregation took
advantage of every opportunity to
set up power plays based around
Doug Mackey and Link Sheuer
man as they captured the first tilt
before the Pipes could develop team
work.
In the second foray the Pipes sub
stituted a complete team, and the
new unit, led by Jack Street, Russ
Pomery, and Jesse Cone, held a 7
to 5 advantage before bowing to
the superior power of the well
organized Basement club.
