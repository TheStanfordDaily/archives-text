## Emotion vs. Reason 
### 
When we received the letter from "A Wounded Student
Veteran" we knew that it would provoke replies. But we never
expected the avalanche that has descended upon us.
The most interesting thing about it is the overwhelming
prevalence of humanitarian sentiment. Out of all the letters we
have received, only two support the wounded student veteran's
point of view. One of these cannot be used, inasmuch as it is
unsigned.
It is easy enough to let emotions control your tongue; it's a
little harder to let emotions actually control your principles. We
suspect that even the wounded veteran isn't really a man of
such grisly principles as his letter would indicate.
It is the lack of rational thinking, and the substitution of
emotion for reason, that is responsible for many of our faulty
attitudes today.
In all seriousness, we feel that purely emotional thinking,
that hate and prejudice, should be chopped up in little pieces
and distributed up and down Palm Drive.
