## 'Wounded Veteran'

To the Editor:
I admire Mr. '"Wounded Student's" courage in associating himself with
his remarks by signing his name to the honest and sincere opinion that he
submitted to The Daily. It is the same high level type of boldness that is
exemplified by the Ku Klux Klan when they mask (through sheer mod
esty) for some brave and honorable nocturnal adventure.
My first reaction aftei' reading this coolly written note was to seek this
friendly and peace-loving internationalist and congratulate him for
showing such perspicacity, but then 1 was reminded about what happens
to people who pet mad dogs.

To the Editor:
I agree with "A Wounded Student Veteran" that the only way to rid the
world of the attitude of hate and evil is to start on its apologists, and there
fore I want to start on him.
Not only are his "admittedly non-Christian" remarks full of hate and
evil, but it is his type of narrow-minded nationalism that lias caused most
ot our wars. He deserves pity though, for apparently he went through the
war with no idea what many of the rest of us were fighting for. It was
not to kill Germans, Finns, Japs, Koreans, Czechs, Italians, etc., etc. â€”there
wi uld have been no point in ending the war if that were our only goal,
lot there were still quite a few of them alive.
I. for one, am foolish enough to think that I fought to preserve some of
the few institutions in our civilization which are worth fighting for; not to
m;<ke a better world, but just to slow down the disintegration of the old
and to give modern humanity ONE MORE chance. I, too, cannot forget
many of my closest friends and the untold millions that I didn't know, and
with the burning memory of the terrible price that has just been paid for
that one more chance, I can't stop fighting either. But, what I was fight
ing was hate and evil, whether in a German or in an American, so I say,
let's give these fellows a chance to prove their individual worth and not
pre-judge them solely on where they were born.
The wounded veteran is correct, the war is not over; the fight for peace
and freedom is NEVER over.
