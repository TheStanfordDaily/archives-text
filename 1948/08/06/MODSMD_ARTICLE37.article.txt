# Student Federalists

To the Editor:
In the Daily issue of July 26, there was a letter written, and I hope
you'll pardon the forthright language, by one of the dupes of the group
called the Student Federalists.
Apparently on this campus of supposedly well-informed men and
women there is a handful of supporters of the idea of world federal gov
ernment. These supporters would be betti?r off by utilizing their spare
time studying international relations. It would undoubtedly lead to the
discovery that any type of world government is impossible.
The Student Federalists are only living in a "pink cloud" which is the
surest way of bringing an atomic bomb down on their addled heads. These
isolated individuals may estimate their impracticable policies above their
own lives, but when they try to pass off their starry-eyed goals as a grow
ing socio-political idea, that is going too far.
