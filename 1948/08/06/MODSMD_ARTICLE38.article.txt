The street was a rainbow of light. Store windows and motion picture
marquees lined the sidewalks, while colored neon signs flashed from above.
1 might have been on Market Street instead of the main street of Brussels,
for the other nations of Europe, very short of power, have nothing com
parable to this scene.
The Belgian nation has found that pot of gold reputed to he at the end
of the rainbow. Here nothing is rationed. The stores are filled with com
modities which are still scarce in the rest of Europe. Prices, even though
they are three times as high as in pre-war times, still allow the average
worker to enjoy a better standard of living than his counterpart in most
of the continent. The unskilled lahorei earns about ninety dollars a
month, while the skilled workers average one hundred and fifty. These
wages when compared with the fifty-three and seventy dollars received
by similar workers in Italy show how high Belgium's level of living is
compared to her fellow European countries.
The nations prosperity is partially due to its industrial composition.
With the war over, Belgium, a surplus producer of steel and textiles,
found a great demand which kept its factories busy at full production.
The past year this small nation has exported more than half of the four
million tons of steel it manufactured. The rich Congo colony, exporting
raw materials, including uranium ore, to the United States, has also been
a significant factor in the rapid recovery of Belgium.
But the most spectacular cause for recovery was the economic policy
followed by the government immediately after liberation. All the cur
rency over and including the two hundred-franc note (approximately
equal to two dollars) was recalled. A maximum of two thousand francs
was issued to the citizens for temporary living expenses. Those who
could prove that their income had not come from collaboration or black
market operations were given back forty per cent of the amount taken
by the government. A year later, following more detailed investigation,
the other sixty per cent was returned to the people in government bonds.
This program not only confiscated the illegally made fortunes, but it
also controlled inflation which has hindered the recovery of other nations.
Now there is no need for price control or rationing, and the economy is
healthy. Thus its far-sighted government planning has permitted Belgium
to remain free from the government controls which are so prevalent in
Europe.
Belgium's future is inextricably interwoven with the rest of the
world. As an exporting nation she requires foreign markets, and only a
prosperous world will be a good consumer. Although the Marshall Plan
will hurt her export of textiles, because the other European nations will
have dollars to buy these goods from America, Belgium has been a firm
supporter ol any program that will better conditions of other nations.
The Belgian people understand the wisdom of the words of their Prime
Minister Paul Henri Spaak, "International co-operation is like marriage;
one cannot expect both the benefits ol a bachelor and the advantages of
union. They are willing to make the sacrifices now required in order to
insure continued prosperity.

market operations were given back forty per cent of the amount taken
by the government. A year later, following more detailed investigation,
the other sixty per cent was returned to the people in government bonds.
This program not only confiscated the illegally made fortunes, but it
also controlled inflation which has hindered the recovery of other nations.
Now there is no need for price control or rationing, and the economy is
healthy. Thus its far-sighted government planning has permitted Belgium
to remain free from the government controls which are so prevalent in
Europe.
Belgium's future is inextricably interwoven with the rest of the
world. As an exporting nation she requires foreign markets, and only a
prosperous world will be a good consumer. Although the Marshall Plan
will hurt her export of textiles, because the other European nations will
have dollars to buy these goods from America, Belgium has been a firm
supporter ol any program that will better conditions of other nations.
The Belgian people understand the wisdom of the words of their Prime
Minister Paul Henri Spaak, "International co-operation is like marriage;
one cannot expect both the benefits ol a bachelor and the advantages of
union. They are willing to make the sacrifices now required in order to
insure continued prosperity.
The street was a rainbow of light. Store windows and motion picture
marquees lined the sidewalks, while colored neon signs flashed from above.
1 might have been on Market Street instead of the main street of Brussels,
for the other nations of Europe, very short of power, have nothing com
parable to this scene.
The Belgian nation has found that pot of gold reputed to he at the end
of the rainbow. Here nothing is rationed. The stores are filled with com
modities which are still scarce in the rest of Europe. Prices, even though
they are three times as high as in pre-war times, still allow the average
worker to enjoy a better standard of living than his counterpart in most
of the continent. The unskilled lahorei earns about ninety dollars a
month, while the skilled workers average one hundred and fifty. These
wages when compared with the fifty-three and seventy dollars received
by similar workers in Italy show how high Belgium's level of living is
compared to her fellow European countries.
The nations prosperity is partially due to its industrial composition.
With the war over, Belgium, a surplus producer of steel and textiles,
found a great demand which kept its factories busy at full production.
The past year this small nation has exported more than half of the four
million tons of steel it manufactured. The rich Congo colony, exporting
raw materials, including uranium ore, to the United States, has also been
a significant factor in the rapid recovery of Belgium.
But the most spectacular cause for recovery was the economic policy
followed by the government immediately after liberation. All the cur
rency over and including the two hundred-franc note (approximately
equal to two dollars) was recalled. A maximum of two thousand francs
was issued to the citizens for temporary living expenses. Those who
could prove that their income had not come from collaboration or black
market operations were given back forty per cent of the amount taken
by the government. A year later, following more detailed investigation,
the other sixty per cent was returned to the people in government bonds.
