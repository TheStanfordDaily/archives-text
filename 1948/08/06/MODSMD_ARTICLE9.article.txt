# 'Red Herring' Not Hearing-Truman
## GOP's Price Remedy Passed Over President's Objections 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (UP)
—Defiant House Republicans
swept their own anti-inflation
bill to passage today soon after
President Truman opened a new
slugfest with congress.
The bank and consumer credit
control measure, far short of the
President's demands, won a thump
ing 264 to 97 vote victory, 23 more
than the two-thirds required under
the House's "gag rule" procedure.
Fifty Democrats, mostly Southern
ers, deserted their party leadership
and joined the Republicans in send
ing the measure to the Senate where
it is scheduled for floor consideration
tomorrow.
The House acted only two hours
after Mr. Truman, in a
mood, blistered the GOP majority
in Congress for failing to take "ef
fective" action against high prices.
The President accused the Re
publican leaders of failing even to
give his proopsals a full and fair
hearing, and charged that GOP
anti-inflation decisions were made
"without obtaining the full infor
mation the administration was pre
pared to offer."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (UP).
—President Harry Truman to
day called
"spy" investigations a "red her
ring" to divert attention from
lack of action on inflation.
In a written statement, the Pres
ident asked the Republican Con
gressional leadership to reconsider
present plans for "quick adjourn
ment" of the special session. He
again asked action on price con
trols and other phases of his anti
inflation program which the Re
publicans are planning to ignore.
MIS REMARKS on the Commu
nist investigations were delivered
off-hand at a news conference. He
said neither Senate nor House in
quiries have developed anything
not already known to the FBI
What has been brought out in tes
timony to the committees proved
insufficient to indict those accused,
he remarked.
When a reporter asked whether
Truman did not think the Ameri
can public is entitled to the infor
mation being produced by the
hearings, he said there was nothing
new and that a lot of people have
been slandered.
AT THE CAPITOL, the House
Un-American Activities Committee
announced that it has uncovered a
mystery witness whose testimony
wlil "break open" the whole Com
munist spy investigation.
Acting Chairman Karl Mundt. R..
S.D., said he has appointed a spe
cial subcommittee whose members
will leave Washington to question
the unidentified witness, but said it
is a man whose name has not fig
ured in the investigation until now.
THE WHOLE STORY, he prom
ised, will be revealed publicly next
week at open hearings.
Mundt said that it is believed
testimony from this witness will
lead to another witness who will
break open the whole case.
In reply to the President's accu
sation, Mundt stated that the com
mittee had reason to believe a Rus
sian spy ring is still operating with
in the federal government.
He accused the President of try
ing to block the investigation by
refusing to give the committee a
look at the government's loyalty
files.
