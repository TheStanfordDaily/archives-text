THE SPACE
High Cost of Living Department
When my girl has that hungry look
—She lives to cat but cannot cook
Sorry am I that she's far from home
—'Cause I can't feed her on
the CI loan.
To Uncle Sam I tip my hat.
He gives me money for this and
that.
For books and chow and launder-ee
But none for my girl to cat with me.
Now, I can't face a woman with
a hungry look,
It's much too hard on my pockct
book.
If this poem gets printed we'll bot+i
eat out,
With Uncle and Willie —hosts, no
doubt. —Zink
High cost of living isn't Willie's
fault; he's doing all he can. Ho
rings bells, gives 20 per ccnt dis
counts (except Saturdays and Sun
days), feeds starving writers;
couldn't do very much more with
out going on the dole himself.
Where?
