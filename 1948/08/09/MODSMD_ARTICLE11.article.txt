### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 8 (UP).â€”|
The House Un-American Activities j
Committee moved today to break j
through a wall of # diplomatic im
munity to question a 52-year-old :
Russian woman who is being kept
in seclusion by Soviet officials in j
New York.
At the same time the committee j
disclosed that Lauchlin Currie,
| White House aide to the late Presi- i
dent Roosevelt, will testify Wed
nesday in answer to charges that j
he once provided information to a |
Communist spy ring.
i ACTING CHAIRMAN Karl E.
j Mundt. R.. S.D., announced the
committee's plans after a two-hour
closed meeting.
He said the committee has asked !
the State Depatrment to rule on
whether Congressional investiga
tors can enter the Soviet consulate
in New York to question Mrs. Ok- ;
sana Stepanovna Kosenkina. chem
l istry teacher at the consulate's j
i school for children of Russian offi- j
; eials.
Mrs. Kosenkina, who figured yes
terday in a bizarre "kidnaping and
rescue" case, probably could give
the committee illuminating stories
I of Communist "intrigue," if she

could talk freely, Mundt said.
Pie revealed that the committee's
spy ring hearings will resume to
morrow with former government
official Victor Perlo and "mystery
witness" Alexander Koral testify
ing.
PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES have
been brought into the hearing and
who want a chance to defend them
selves will be heard on Wednesday,
with Currie leading the list, Mundt
added.
Mrs. Kosenkina appeared at the
Soviet consulate in New York yes
terday and conflicting stories were
immediately released on what has
happened to her in the last few
days.
THE SOVIET CONSUL said she
was forcibly rescued from "White
Russian kidnapers" who were hold
ing her on the New York country
estate of Countess Alexandria Tol
stoy, daughter of the famed Rus
sian novelist. Loo Tolstoy.
Mundt, in Washington, said he
understood she was taken to the
consulate as she was getting ready
to turn herself over to American
authorities and bare the inner
workings of "Soviet world con
trols."
