# Truman Prepares Attack On Congress' Adjournment

### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 (UP) —Members of the bitterly divided
80th Congress trooped back to their homes today as President
Truman reportedly worked on a scathing statement denouncing
them for their failure to act on his legislative program.
The 13-day-old special session adjourned Saturday night at

+ the height of the angriest politiical
wrangle in years after approving
mild anti-inflation and housing leg
islation. It ignored the President's
request for wage - price controls
and rationing authority.
An authoritative administration
source said Mr. Truman would sign
"reluctantly" the Republican price
and housing bills and issue a state
ment early this week, possibly to
morrow, blasting them as inade
quate.
THE PRESIDENT returned to
the White House this afternoon
after a week-end cruise aboard his
yacht Williamsburg.
It remained to be seen whether
th President would answer person
ally, or let other Democratic lead
ers reply to the impeachment
threat raised against him by Sen
Homer Ferguson, R., Mich. Best
| guess was that Mr. Truman woul<
, keep silent.
Ferguson charged on the Senate
floor that the President's refusal to
give Congress loyalty files on fed
eral employees suspected of Com
munism left the lawmakers in the
"intolerable position" of either leg
islating in the dark or compelling
Mr. Truman to answer for his con
duct.
SPEAKING AS CHAIRMAN of
I the Senate's super - investigating
committee, he said that could be
done through impeachment pro
ceedings.
Sen. Carl A. Hatch, D.. N.M., a
close personal friend of Mr. Tru
man, described Ferguson's state
ment as "preposterous, absurd."
But. he said, if impeachment pro
ceedings were started "they would
assure the President's election."
The Ferguson statement was the
final GOP blow at the President,
coming after the Republicans al
ready had rejected most of his leg
islative program.
• The Congressional fires scarcely
had burned out when both Demo
crats and Republicans began giving
the record of the special session a
thorough airing that will continue
until the voters go to the polls in
the fall election.
SEN. ROBERT A. TAFT is ex
pected to issue a statement this
week in a reply to the one now
being pepared by Mr. Truman.
Ponding its release, he declined to
comment on the record of Congress
and its effect on the Republicans'
chances this fall.
