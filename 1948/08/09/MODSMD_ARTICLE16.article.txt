### 
CHICAGO, Aug. 8 (UP) —Budget-battered housewives over
the nation were set today to fire their most potent weapon at
high meat prices—refusal to buy for one week beginning to
morrow.
Groups of irate women in dozens of cities spent all last week

* telephoning other women and urg
ing them to stay away from their
butcher shops this coming week.
Now they were ready to test their
theory that if they refused to buy.
| prices would have to come down.
THE ORIGINATOR of the "pet
, tieoat rebellion," 71-year-old Mis.
R. H. Vaughn of Dallas, flatly pre
dicted that the campaign would
get results.
Meat industry leaders in Dallas
and elsewhere, however, were
skeptical. They believed the re
bellion would fail to brinig sub
stantial price reductions, because
I many women would fail to join the
boycott or weaken and buy meat,
j anyway.
AS THE DEADLINE approached,
I Mrs. Vaughn said she was "knec
! deep" in letters and telegrams of
J support from other campaign cen
ters over the country. The rebel
lion extended from California to
New York and Wisconsin to Flor
ida.
Mrs. Vaughn said that even a
butcher, J. M. Chandler of Tampa,
Fla., had telephoned for details of
I the drive, saying he was going to
j launch a boycott in this town.
THE WOMEN were lighting
prices which have reached sky
high levels on the livestock market,
at wholesale outlets, and in butch
er shops, where most steaks cost $1
a pound or more.
