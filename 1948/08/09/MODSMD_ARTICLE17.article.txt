With a total of 430,000 motorists
ruled off the nation's streets and
highways by suspension or revo
cation of their licenses, Stanford
drivers were warned last week by
Police Chief Gordy Davis not to
relax in their efforts to maintain
the low accident rate on campus.
"So far this summer, we have
been fortunate not to have a single
serious accident involving Stanford
students, either on or off campus.
But the high accident rate in the
country should only indicate to us
how lucky we have been,"the chief
stated.
FOR THE NATION. 40 per cent
of the drivers banned from the
road lost their permits as a result
of convictions for driving while
under the influence of liquor, ac
cording to figures of the American
Association of Motor Vehiicle Ad
ministrators.
In California last year, 24.478
suspensions and revocations out of
a total of 32,448 were for drunken
driving, or approximately 75 per
j cent of the total, the California

j pensions ran as high as GO or 70 per
I cent.
