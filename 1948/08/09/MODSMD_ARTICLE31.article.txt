## Out of the Bindery 
### 
To the Editor:
Several weeks ago I assembled a bibliography of about three articles
which I hoped to use as a nucleus for an English term paper. They were
just ordinary articles in technical magazines. There was nothing strange
or bizarre about them, they were hung with no aura of mystery or romance.
Just articles. Articles about steel.
In conformance to the rules and traditions of this University, I wrote
down the name and volume number of each of the magazines in which I
optimistically expected to find my articles. I presented these data on
regulation slips of brown cardboard to the librarian. I remember her as
a serene, intelligent, not unattractive young woman.
''I'll get these periodicals for you," she assured me as she took my
regulation slips of brown cardboard.
That was the last time I, or any one I know of, ever saw that young
woman. Where she is today, whether she thinks of me occasionally and
my three articles on steel, none can say. To get on with the story, how
ever, after waiting approximately twenty minutes a man came up to me.
Hi:- face was wrinkled, his eyes had a shattered, distraught look to them,
his hands trembled and twitched.
'"These magazines you wanted," he faltered, "they . .
"Yes, yes," I encouraged. "The magazines, they what?"
He broke down completely. "They are in the bindery."
I smiled reassuringly. "Well, get them OUT of the bindery."
"OUT of the bindery?"
"Yes, OUT of the bindery."
"Nothing, NOTHING, ever comes OUT of the bindry."
"But I don't care if they're bound or not; all I want is . .
The man had disappeared behind the stacks. As he left I could barely
perceive his enchanted voice whispering "OUT of the bindery. OUT of
the bindery, OUT of the bindery," like some strange and exotic phrase
which he had not quite understood.
I do not purport to know what goes on in the University bindery. Some
believe that magazine articles are sung there in mystic rites involving
human sacrifice and virginal dances. Other authorities suggest that the
pages of periodicals are carefully and slowly eaten, then to be regurgitated
and fitted together as part of an extraordinary process known only to
master binders. Whatever the true explanation, however, I should like to
propose that the august and venerable body which governs our library
obtain TWO subscriptions to each periodical. One for the bindery, and
one for the less terrifying and more accessible departments.
Yours sincerely,
ROBERT S. KROOTH
