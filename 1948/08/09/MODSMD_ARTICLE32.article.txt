# DICK KELTON
## Europe 1948 
### 
'"Dollars!" was the answer Piet Abbing, a Dutch student, gave when
I asked him what he thought of first on hearing the word America. '"You
have a rich country," he added.
Since the war the Dutch have been under one of the most austere
rationing systems in all of Europe. Practically everything except fresh
fruit and vegetables is rationed. In this land, which exports large quanti
ties of dairy products, even cheese and butter are controlled, and milk
was taken oil the list of rationed commodities only in the last month. The
Dutch economy was seriously injured by the establishment of a Dominion
from their former Indonesian colony. Now, the nation is trying to increase
its exports to other countries.
Americans are strange creatures in this land. Their good clothes,
especially their shoes, contrast as vividly with the apparel of the local
citizens as the American spirit of gay extroversion contrasts with the
phlegmatic attitude of the Dutchmen. So it was not surprising when
Americans invaded the small town of Sloken, the populace appeared at
their windows and doors and stared at us.
I felt rather uncomfortable as I wandered through the narrow old
cobbled streets, for everywhere I walked I could feel the eyes of the
people following me. I finally arrived at a small square in the center
ot the city. Other Americans and a few Dutch children were already there.
One of our group started playing a harmonica and the tune happened to
bo one for which the children had Dutch words. We all sang together,
lightening the strained atmosphere.
Soon the older populace added themselves to our gathering until we
were the center of a large mass of humanity. Many Dutch speak English,
since the language is taught in the schools. An excited interchange of
conversation began.
One middle-aged man pointed to the cigarette he had just rolled and
said. "If it weren't for Marshall, we wouldn't have any tobacco." An older
bearded man added, with a smile, "We call America"the Marshall Land'."
The first man said earnestly. "When you get back to America, thank
Marshall for us."
All of the people expressed the same sentiments. They looked to Amer
ica for aid and in return regarded our country with almost childlike
adoration.
As wc began to leave, a young girl with the blond hair and blue eyes
so typical of the people in the north of the Netherlands rushed forward.
She clung to the arm of one of the Americans and implored. "I u/k'd
like to go back with you to America." The girl's mother spoke a few
Dutch words to her which brought laughter from the crowd. The girl
blushed and withdrew to her mother's side.
In Holland today. America is heid in esteem principally because of
our aid. Someday in the future that aid wiircease. Before that time ar
rives, we must promote a more fundamental basis for international respect
and understanding

since the language is taught in the schools. An excited interchange of
conversation began.
One middle-aged man pointed to the cigarette he had just rolled and
said. "If it weren't for Marshall, we wouldn't have any tobacco." An older
bearded man added, with a smile, "We call America"the Marshall Land'."
The first man said earnestly. "When you get back to America, thank
Marshall for us."
All of the people expressed the same sentiments. They looked to Amer
ica for aid and in return regarded our country with almost childlike
adoration.
As wc began to leave, a young girl with the blond hair and blue eyes
so typical of the people in the north of the Netherlands rushed forward.
She clung to the arm of one of the Americans and implored. "I u/k'd
like to go back with you to America." The girl's mother spoke a few
Dutch words to her which brought laughter from the crowd. The girl
blushed and withdrew to her mother's side.
In Holland today. America is heid in esteem principally because of
our aid. Someday in the future that aid wiircease. Before that time ar
rives, we must promote a more fundamental basis for international respect
and understanding

'"Dollars!" was the answer Piet Abbing, a Dutch student, gave when
I asked him what he thought of first on hearing the word America. '"You
have a rich country," he added.
Since the war the Dutch have been under one of the most austere
rationing systems in all of Europe. Practically everything except fresh
fruit and vegetables is rationed. In this land, which exports large quanti
ties of dairy products, even cheese and butter are controlled, and milk
was taken oil the list of rationed commodities only in the last month. The
Dutch economy was seriously injured by the establishment of a Dominion
from their former Indonesian colony. Now, the nation is trying to increase
its exports to other countries.
Americans are strange creatures in this land. Their good clothes,
especially their shoes, contrast as vividly with the apparel of the local
citizens as the American spirit of gay extroversion contrasts with the
phlegmatic attitude of the Dutchmen. So it was not surprising when
Americans invaded the small town of Sloken, the populace appeared at
their windows and doors and stared at us.
I felt rather uncomfortable as I wandered through the narrow old
cobbled streets, for everywhere I walked I could feel the eyes of the
people following me. I finally arrived at a small square in the center
ot the city. Other Americans and a few Dutch children were already there.
One of our group started playing a harmonica and the tune happened to
bo one for which the children had Dutch words. We all sang together,
lightening the strained atmosphere.
Soon the older populace added themselves to our gathering until we
were the center of a large mass of humanity. Many Dutch speak English,
since the language is taught in the schools. An excited interchange of
conversation began.
