## Bull Session 
### 
Summer at Stanford:
When the sun sneaks lazily over the rooftops of the Row while the
bookworms are in bed, sleeping on the knowledge they pillowed a few
hours before . . .
The street diggers, like gophers, keep burrowing away with seemingly
no better place to go . . .
"When the Main Libe, usually packed like Grand Central Station, yawns
lor lack of activity to keep awake . . .
The Quad at noon, silent and asleep, as though it need not eat lunch to
stay alive . . .
An Encina Hall full of grads, unlike its autumnal clamor Encina Brawl,
drones on without even the thud of an occasional waterbag . . .
When the privileged few trudge dejectedly Quadward for a cup of joe
and those dreaded eight o'clocks . . .
A Cellar date at 9:30 amidst the chattery chit-chat of giggly girls and
brawny boys . . .
The muffled fear of impending war, pushed into the background by
the daily question of "How did my Seals do?" . . .
The dry weeds and sloping pastures, giving one the impression that the
sandstone build'ngs were dumped from the air upon a medieval farm . . .
The smiling salesman at the Postoffice who sells a pre-war three-cent
stamp for the same price, as if to say inflation is a fairy-book invention . . .
A gloomy fraternity house at midnight, with a lonely glare piercing
the evening's darkness from a corner room, like a beacon to help stagger
ing brothers find their way home . . .
Patchwork roads, in this highly mechanical age, as though trying to
rtcall the marvels of the cobblestone Appian Way . . .
A laughing moon spilling its rays of happiness upon the empty and
dejected shell of Lake«Lagunita . . .
That's summer at Stanford.
