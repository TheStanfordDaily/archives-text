A Stanford Man
Bemoaned his fate.
All summer long
He'd had no date.
He'd phoned and phoned
His gal named Lixsie.
She'd always reply,
"Sorry, I'm busy."
Then came a thought
To this lad from the Farm.
She can't resist
If I mention Longbarn.
So now he's happy.
And popular too.
If he can do it—
So can you.

Seven cent nickles and free chow
to J. E. M. Seven cent nickles—
that's America.

That's the place where Duncan
Hines had one of his adventures—
1948 too. ' Wonder if he ever
goes hunjry.)
