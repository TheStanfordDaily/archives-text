»UT AT THE Enrico Rossotti
edish Mineral Springs, a couple
old faces were giving forth with
•gant repartee on sports items.
Said Eight-to-five MeGinty in a
•atonal tone, "As an old athlete—
been making book for the past
cade—l'd like to state at this time
><. all the football experts who
picking California or USC to
n the Coast Conference are going
jio phooey kerplunk in their
u'-shot prognosticating.
As we say in the clubhouse, the
t money will be on Oregon,
at's the team to watch.
SINCE JIM AIKEN started
■ hing at Oregon, he's gathered
>>ther a bunch of effervescent
mis who have been scouring the
rii for grid talent, and shipping
o to Eugene, Oregon."
'".ight-to-five flicked his Corona
ma paused for a moment, and
: 11 ued.
And the prize plum in this foot
collection is a chap named
ly Lewis fom Los Angeles City
liege.
on the order of Jackie
'.nson. this dusky chap is going
■ig. scoot, and scamper till all
opposing tacklers are weary
chasing him.
AND IF THAT isn't enough,
a Van Bocklin will still be
nil to pitch passes. He was un
tied in competitive play last
on, and I doubt if he's lost his
Ary in aerial fundamentals.
Ip in the front ranks such stal
es as Brack Ecklund, Dan Gar-
Darrell Robinson, and Steve
' will provide the nucleus for
leavy and experienced line,
lit. experience, and class; what
can a coach ask for?
*cs, me boy, those snappy Web
•rs look like the boys for the
Bowl to me.
v the by, another goodie that
n't help telling you about is
>r X in the eighth tomorrow
el Mar . .

Italy in turn will relinquish its sec
ond-place medals to Britain, and
Hungary will pass its bronze third
place awards to Italy.
It was the first time in history
that a decision involving an Olym
pic champion had been reversed,
and Britons were stunned at losing
the only gold medal the host nation
had been awarded at Wembley Sta
dium.
The disqualifying incident in
volved Ewell, 30 - year - old hard
luck runner from Lancaster, Pa.,
and Wright, a Wayne University
Negro.
RUNNING THE FIRST leg of the
relay, Ewell passed the baton to
Wright and continued abreast of
Wright through the 20-yard zone
in which the pass must be com
pleted.
Presumably confused by stag
gered lanes and the fact that per
sistent showers had dimmed the
lines marking off the zones, lane
judges ruled that Ewell had not
completed the pass before he sped
out of the legal zone.
Official pictures, filmed by the J.
Arthur Rank organization, showed
to the satisfaction of the jury of
appeals, however, that the pass was
legal and, in fact, had been made
ony two strides beyond the warn
ing marking midway through the
20-yard zone.
