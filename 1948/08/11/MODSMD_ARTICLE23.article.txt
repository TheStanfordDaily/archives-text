## Hold That Note...

Stanford's music department has a good rec
ord. Not only has it provided instruction of
high quality, but it has given entertainment
and enjoyment for the whole student body on
numerous occasions.
The new Ann Clare Brokaw Memorial List
ening Unit will be a welcome addition to the
department. It symbolizes the sort of thing that
is a vital part of Stanford life.
We hope that someday the music depart
ment may progress to the point where advanced
study toward the doctor's degree will be pos
sible.
Perhaps in five or ten years the University
will have grown to such a point that it will be
possible to award the doctor's degree in music.
But to do so now would be an attempt to
place the department in competition with first
rate eastern schools. It is doubtful if sufficient
funds or facilities would be forthcoming to do
that adequately.
Rather than take a chance on lowering the
general standard of excellence of that depart
ment, why not wait awhile?
