## History 1948 World Bill of Rights 
### 
There has been no clearer statement in modern
times of what most Americans mean by democracy
than the "World Bill of Rights" which Mrs. Franklin
D. Roosevelt took to the Geneva meeting of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights.
The draft was kept short, so that school children
could memorize it; but brevity is the least of its merits
â€”it is in words that everyone knows, it covers situ
ations all can understand, and it is complete. Let no
one think that this document was scribbled on the

back of an envelope or pulled out
of a hat. The Commission on Hu
man Rights has been working on
this subject for more than a year.
The British put their own pro
posals in the form of a Foreign
Office White Paper last June. Mrs.
Roosevelt had the assistance of
our own State, Justice, Labor, and
Interior Departments.
The ten articles in the new doc
ument assert such political free
doms as equal protection under
the law, freedom of information,

speech, and expression; the right of assembly and peti
tion, the right to fair trial and the right to vote and to
the secret ballot. It asserts such social freedoms as
immunity from "unreasonable interference" with pri
vacy. family, home, correspondence, and reputation;
liberty to move freely within a country and to migrate
outside, guarantees against involuntary servitude, and
protection against discriminations on account of race,
sex, language, or religion. It asserts the economic
freedoms of a decent living, health, education, and
social security.
The United States is not today fully living up to
all these principles. There are unwarranted discrimi
nations; there are unlawful barriers against voting;
fair trial is not always given. Mrs. Roosevelt's Article
VII says that "Everyone, in the determination of his
lights and obligations, is entitled to a fair hearing be
fore an independent and impartial tribunal, and to
the aid of counsel."
There was certainly some doubt recently that fed
eral employees were assured of such procedure under
the loyally order. But most of us have a conscience
about such lapses and try to prevent or end them.
When these principles, in an earlier formulation,
came before the Human Rights Commission in Feb
ruary of 1947, the Soviet delegate objected that the
rights and freedoms designated were either super
fluous, beyond the present power of the UN, or im
pinged on the local laws and customs of national states.
You readers can easily decide for yourselves which
rights and freedoms impinge on the laws and customs
now prevailing in Russia. But this, definitely, is what
we in this countrv menu by democracy.
