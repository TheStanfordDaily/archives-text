## World Federation 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. Vandevar reflects the unfortunate view that
the idea of a World Federation is both hopeless and !
likely to bring about a war. He fails to indicate any
reason beyond emotion for his belief.
Regional federations have worked and are working
to bring about peace between their member states, the
U.S. and Switzerland for example. The present move
ment toward a Western European Union demonstrates
the possibility in a highly nationalistic area.
There seem to be three general methods of estab
lishing peace between groups of people or nations:
balance of power, appeasement, and federation. His
torically, the first two have always led to war, And
historically, the federation method has reduced or !
eliminated armed conflicts between member states. |
The secret of federation success seems to lie in the i
fact that it provides an enforceable but peaceful means
of settling disputes.
I prefer to try the method that has shown ability to !
maintain peace and order rather than a method that
has repeatedly failed.
