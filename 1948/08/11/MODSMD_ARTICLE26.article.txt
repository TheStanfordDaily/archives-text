# In Defense of the Library

; To the Editor:
"Out of the Bindery" manifested the layman's dis
' oriented impressions of the mysterious functioning of
! that "heart of the University," the library.
Popsicles come in two's, stilts come in two's, a pair
of trousers comes on a male student, a pair of slacks
on a female student, clover comes in three's, except in
the popular song; but a bibliography never comes in
two's or three's, nor does a book list. The student had
J three references, and nothing but.
j However, we sincerely forgive his annoyed humor
at the expense of our austere dignity. In fact we wel
| come his coming to the library to see our "best cellars."
There we can initiate him into the simple rites of li
brarianship.
VVe are rightly happy at the progress we have made
j in overcoming the tremendous backlog of binding the
j war began, a shortage of materials and trained binders
continued, and inflation has beset. At present no item
is at the bindery for more than three or four weeks;
and any item of importance can be secured "back from
| the bindery," therefore we stand self-righteously.
highly moral, and point with pride at our record.
