J To the Editor:
Monday's issue of The Daily stated that I had been
selected by the Independent Progressive Party of San
Mateo County to be a delegate to the new party state
convention in Sacramento Saturday. That statement
is correct.
I am now taking steps to sever my connection with
the Independent Progressive Party. If any of my
friends are interested in my reasons for this action,
I shall be glad to supply them with details.
