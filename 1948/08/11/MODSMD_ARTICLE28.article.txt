I To the Editor:
Just a few words concerning the 'Wounded Stu
[ dent Veteran' who spouted his line of hate in The
Daily.
What army is he a veteran of? His bigoted
views more resemble those disseminated in a dictator
ship than anything in this country with the exception
of the KKK and the Glendale Post of the American
Legion. In other words, he stupidly advocates the
use of those same tactics which his buddies tried to
wipe off the face of the earth by getting themselves
killed. DAVE MARTIN.
