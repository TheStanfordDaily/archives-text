College, oh dear college, thou bowl of many anach
| ronisms . . .
Where stout-hearted young men complain bitterly
about the inroads of socialism into our free enterprise
system, and then gladly hop aboard the 52 20 gravy
j train every summer vacation.
Where students pen impassioned English essays
{ about the blessings of our American heritage of liberty
and tolerance, and then blackball potential members
in their fraternities and sororities because of race or
j religion.
Where young college misses know that such super
fluous items as heavy bank rolls and deluxe conver
tibles are no criteria in judging men, yet can always
squeeze in a date with "that awfully cute fellow with
a two-tone Cadillac convertible."
Where young men are perfectly aware that beauty
is only skin deep, yet can never forget that adage, "The
hell with the personality, how's the body?"
Where the virtues of academic greatness are piously
stressed, and yet football coaches get more pay than
school presidents.
Where students are cheerfully told to operate their
own student government, and are then snarled in more
administration red tape than at the Bauer and Black
adhesive tape factory.
Where men and women look with scorn upon the
violence of a picket line, yet break windows, destroy
property, and throw rocks at each other in pre-football
! game rallies.
Where certain students feel that if we dropped an
j atomic egg on Russia the world would run right, yet
not thinking if the world could even crawl, let alone
. run. after an atomic explosion.
