# Duo Will Offer African Songs
## 
### 
Josef Marals and Miranda, world
famous South African folk singers,
will present a program of folk
music next Wednesday at 8:15 p.m.
in Memorial Hall.
The inimitable husband and wife
team, well known to folk music
lovers though their Decca record
albums and radio appearances, are
currently touring the West Coast
after playing to sold-out houses in
the East.
Although specializing primarily
in songs of the African Veld, Ma
rais and Miranda include in their
repertoire many ballads from
America, England, Ireland, and
France. Each is sung first in the
native tongue, then in English
translation.
The Maraises have been descirbed
as "a polished and sophisticated duo
with an immensely subtle and ef
fective presentation.
Typical of the songs that have
made them a sensation in folk
music circles are such African Veld
ballads as "Pretty Kitty," "Old
Johnnie Goggabie," "Jan Pierie
wiet," "There's the Cape Cart," and
"Henrietta's Wedding."
All seats for the program are
$1.20, including tax. Tickets may
be purchased at the office of the
Committee on Public Exercises,
room 161-A, Administration Build
ing, or at the Peninsula Box Office
in Palo Alto.
