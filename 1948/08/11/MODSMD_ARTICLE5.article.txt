MOSCOW, Aug. 10 (UP)—
The western allied ambassadors
plan to seek another audience
with Russian Foreign Minister
Viacheslav Molotov, possibly to
morrow, after receiving fresh in
structions from their govern
ments, it was understood to
night.
It was predicted that exchanges
between the Ambassadors and Molo
tov, pointed toward four-power ne
i gotiations on Germany and perhaps
other European problems, would
continue for another week.
By then, it is hoped, a basis of
agreement will have been found for
a formal conference ot the Big Four
foreign ministers to be held prob
j ably in Paris next month, when the
United Nations assembly meets
, there.
Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, Ameri
can ambassador; Yves Chataigneau.
, French ambassador and Frank Rob
; crts, special British ambassador, sent
J reports to their governments last
night on yesterday's three-hour talk
with Molotov.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 (UP)
— Mikhail Samarin, Russian
schoolmaster who is in hiding
to avoid going back to Russia
was subpenaed as a witness in
the congressional spy hearing
today despite the protest of the
Soviet ambassador.
The house committee on unameri
can activities, with State Department
approval, brushed aside the object
ion of Soviet Ambassador Alexander
S. Panyushkin and served Samarin
with a subpena calling for his ap
pearance late this week or early
next week.
THE SUMMONS was served, com
mitee members said, at a heavily
guarded hideout in the New York
area where Samarin holed up after
appealing to the FBI for aid on Sun
day. Samarin's wife, who is hiding
out in New Jersey with her three
children, also was subenaed.
The committee admitted defeat,
however, in the second part of its
tussle with Panyushkin. The con
gressmen said they wouldn't try to
subpena Mrs. Oksana Stepanovna
Kosenkina, the other Russian teach
er who got mixed up in a lurid
"kidnaping" plot in New York last
week.
MRS. KOSENKINA was "res
cued" from White Russians Satur
day by members of the Soviet con
sulate in New York. Panyushkin
protested formally to the State De
partment last night that she had
been abducted by the anti-Com
munist Russians with the complicity
of the FBI.
Pending Samarin's appearance,
the committee went ahead with the
questioning of former government
employes accused by Elizabeth T.
Bentley, a converted Communist
spy courier, of being Soviet agents
or informants.
Three of them went to the wit
ness chair to defend themselves, and
all three denounced her heartily as
a liar.
SO CATEGORICAL were their
denials, committee members urged
the Justice Department to find out
whether there are grounds for
perjury prosecution against Miss
Bentley or the three she accused.
Today's first witness was Duncan
Lee, 32, a veteran of four years with
the wartime office of strategic serv
ices who, Miss Bentley has sworn,
betrayed American war secrets.
