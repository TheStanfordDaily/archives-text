When going to Longbarn, my darl
ing, with you,
What could be cosier than Daven
port Two.'
But awkward, uneasy, and crowded
we'll be
If we stay on the campus at Daven
port Three.
—J. B. Lawrence
We &ent free chow in an en
velope to Lawrence at the Village,
and while we haven't dropped in
at the Village for quite some time,
informants tell us that it's just
about the same place it's always
been, so we guess we know what
he's talking about in lines two and
three.
From the amount of fan mail
we've been getting the last couple
of weeks, you'd think that every
one has forgotten that the Boss,
Willie to you. passes out free food
for whatever gets printed in this
(the) Space.
So. send 'em to Willie at
LONCBARN
