Because we have had the te
merity to reprint one professor
student joke (we use the word
provisionally), some kind soul has
sent us a clipping of another such
anecdote which we here pass on
to you.
A certain professor (who must
remain nameless) of a certain uni
versity (which must remain equal
ly nameless) was a sworn enemy
of coeducation. "It's impossible
to teach a boy anything if there's
a girl in the class."
"Oh, come, professor," someone
protested. "Surely there must be
some exception to that."
I Stop us it you've heard it be
fore. )
"There might be," snapped the
professor testily. "But he wouldn't
be worth teaching:"
Nuf said. But how, in the name
of It bon dieu, are we going to drag
in the plug, the courtesy we ex
tend to Eddie who's paying for all
this? We love you, Eddie, and
we'll be there when you ring the
bell at THE SHACK. We'll even
buy your candy!!!
