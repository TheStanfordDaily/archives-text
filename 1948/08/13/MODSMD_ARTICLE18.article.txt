# This Is the Way to Wash Our Clothes-Pretty Soon

After months of negotiations, final plans have been made for the in
stallation of automatic washing machines in campus dormitories, Business
Manager Alf Brandin announced yesterday.
The plan for coin operated machines was originally proposed last year
by Excom and submitted to Mr. Brandin. At first it was turned down be
cause campus laws forbid concessionaries on campus and resident direc
tors were worried about the problem of wet laundry.
Excom took up the problem again and agreed to handle the policing
of the washing room and to see that drying facilities were provided.
Several different companies were then contacted and arrangements were
made for installing the machines by September 25.
Two types of automatic washers will be used—the Bendix Automatic
and the Westinghouse Launderette. Bendix spin dryers have been pro
vided to solve the drying problem.
"The price will start at ten cents per washer load," Mr. Brandin said.
"I! we do not meet expenses, it will have to be raised to fifteen cents. The
spin dryers will operate for ten cents."
Directions will be provided on all the machines. The manager urges
that special care be taken in the operation, because the machines are
owned and eared for by off-campus companies. Also, if a machine breaks
down, it will take time to repair it and no laundry will be done.
Washers and dryers will be installed in the following dorms:
Toyon—Two washers, one dryer; Encina—four washers, two dryers:
Union Residence—one washer, one dryer; Madrono—one'washer, one
dryer; Women's Row—two washers, two dryers.
Washers only will be installed in the following houses because they
already have drying facilities:
Roble—two washers; Branner—one washer; Lagunita—two washers.
