### 
Dr. A. M. Zarem, top-flight Pasa
dena research engineer, has been
appointed chairman of physics re
search and manager of the new Los
Angeles division of the Stanford
Research Institute, Dr. J. E. Hob
son, institute director, announced
yesterday.
Dr. Zarem was chief of the elec- j
trical section of the physical re- :
search division of the U.S. Naval j
Ordnance Test Station in Pasadena !
before joining the Stanford staff.
An authority on ultra-high speed
photography and measurement
techniques, he is the inventor of
the Zarem camera which heads the
list of major precision instruments
used in the photographic "Micro
time Technique" developed at the
Navy Test Station in Pasadena.
DURING THE WAR the 31-year
old scientist was a research engi
neer and group leader on several
secret government contracts in
electronics and physics adminis
tered by the California Institute of
Technology. He had previously
been research and development en
gineer for Allis-Chalmers Manu
facturing Co. in Milwaukee, Wis.
A native of Illinois, Dr. Zarem
graduated from Armour Institute
of Technology in 1939 as valedic
torian of his class. He did gradu
ate work in electrical engineering
at California Institute of Technol
ogy, where he receivel the M.S. de
gree in 1940 and the Ph.D. magna
cum laude in 1943.
As manager of the Los Angeles
division of the Stanford Research
Institute, which will open Sunday
with headquarters in the Trans
america Building, Dr. Zarem will
co-ordinate the technical and ad
ministrative activities at Los An
geles with those of the main offices
at Stanford. The newly formed di

vision will be staffed initially by
15 people.
THE GROWING DEMAND for
additional research facilities in the
Los Angeles area, coupled with ef
forts of the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce to provide the best
facilities possible, were given by
Dr. Hobson as the principal rea
sons for opening the Los Angeles
division.
At present Stanford Research In
stitute is carrying on numerous
projects in the Los Angeles area,
including an extensive study of the
smog problem, its cause, sources,
and possible control methods. Oth
er projects include an economic
study to determine the expansibil
ity of the aircraft industry in a na
tional emergency and an evalua
tion of detergents for a Los Ange
les firm in connection with patent
developments.
The Los Angeles division staff
will also conduct research in such
fields of interest to Southern Cali
fornia industry as the design and
development of radar and televi
sion equipment, problems of elec
tronics and television communica
tion, soil conditions, high - speed
photography, and petroleum chem
istry.
Studies will be made on clays for
the ceramics idustry, and research
on technical developments will be
undertaken for the aircraft indus
try.
