# New Ad Quarters In Encina Hall Nearly Completed
## 
### 
Remodeling of a wing of Encina
Hall and three prefabricated build
ings into temporary administration
offices is nearing completion.
The transfer from the present
Administration Building, to make
room for new quarters for the Law
School, will begin in about 10 days.
As fast as the new office space is
made available, it will be occupied.
Reconstruction of the present
Administration Building will begin
when the move is completed, and
will take about 18 months.
The business, purchasing, and
accounting offices will be placed in
the basement and the first floor of
the west wing of Encina. Offices of
the Registrar, Dean of Students,
and Appointment Service will oc
cupy temporary buildings A, B, and
C. now the Veterans' Center.
Telephones — needed in almost
every administrative office—consti
tute the major obstacle to a quick
occupation, since a new conduit is
required for the installations.
The new offices will have famil
iar floor coverings. Linoleum car
pets in the old Administration
Building have been taken up and
are now being laid in Encina.
Few extensive alterations are

called for in the remodeling. The
major change has been to cut con
necting office doors through En
cina's 17-inch brick walls. In addi
tion, the west end of Encina's first
floor has been partitioned to make
an additional office.
