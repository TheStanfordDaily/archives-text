# Babe Rallies; Doc Warns Against Over-Optimism
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Aug. 12 (UP).â€”
Babe Ruth rallied today, but an
announcement from Memorial Hos
pital for Cancer and Allied Dis
eases said his condition still was
critical. A mid - morning hospital
bulletin on the 54-year-old former
home-run king said:
"Babe Ruth rallied this morning.
His pulse is stronger. Condition im
proved although still critical."
J. Paul Carey, treasurer of the
Babe Ruth Foundation, said last
night:
"The Babe is holding his own
definitely. But let's not kid our
selves. The Babe is a very sick
man. He is thoroughly conscious
and Ihey are giving him a little
nourishment."
Ruth's family, including his wife,
Claire, his sister, Mrs. Wilbur Mo
berley, and his adopted daughters,
Mrs. Richard Flanders, North Con
way, N.H., and Mrs. Daniel Sulli
van, New York City, were at his
bedside.
A flood of telephone calls jammed
the hospital switchboard. Kids to
whom the Babe was only a legend,
and adults who remembered seeing
him park one in the bleachers two
decades ago, called to ask how lie
was.
Kids broke off a ball game in a
nearby vacant lot and trooped sad
ly to the hospital to inquire about
him. A bus driver stopped in front

of the hospital and motioned ques
tion ingly.
"He's still alive," someone called
and the bus moved on.
Visitors today included James P.
Chapman of Detroit, and Carey.
Mr. Chapman reported that Ruth
was conscious and smiled when he
recognized him.
Memorial Hospital was flooded
with letters and telegrams from
well - wishers. Mrs. May Singhi
Breen, who has been answering
Ruth's fan mail for four years, said
more than 8.000 letters have been
received since June 24. There has
been a heavy increase since Ruth
was placed on the critical list yes
terday.
