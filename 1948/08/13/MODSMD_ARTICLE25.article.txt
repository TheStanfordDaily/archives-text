## Sing and Crunch 
### 
If you don't care to sing and crunch at the Melody Munch
tonight in Union Court, then don't complain about the quarter's
social program.
This summer the ASSU has spent more to provide a better
social program than was spent in any other summer quarter. It
has presented three all-campus affairs in addition to opening the
women's pool to co-recreational swimming.
The improvement in the social program this summer has been
gratifying, but even more should be done so that students will
not shun summer as a "dead" quarter.
To remedy this Excom has recommended that a summer
activities manager be appointed to plan more social and cultural
events. This way summer quarter will be on a par with other
quarters.
This manager could plan additional activities well in advance
and not leave the job to the social chairman when she takes
office at the beginning of the quarter.
The manager could also plan a program that would include
the interests of both the undergrads and the many graduate
students here summer quarter. The proportion of graduate stu
dents to undergraduates is much greater in summer quarter.
This quarter's activities show a definite advance toward an
adequate social program for the summer quarter. However, there
is still room for improvement, and we hope that the manager
may accomplish this for the future.â€”BTM.
