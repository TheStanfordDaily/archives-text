## 'Back to Your Books!'

To the Editor:
Poor old Wounded Veteran —he got all hot and bothered over the
German Looey coming to Stanford. It's quite obvious that W. V. doesn't
read his Daily carefully enough. He didn't catch the fact that our Ger
man friend was busily sinking RUSSIAN ships. The Daily carefully
pointed this out —but W. V. missed it.
The RUSSIANS! A Slavic people! Not quite our sort, at all. And
another thing—our friend was a submariner—an officer. The Reich
didn't allow peasant types to officer submarines. Heavens NO! A
Prussian! Obviously. A Nordic fellow high above the norm.
Don't you realize, guy, that the scholarship people might have sent
us a JEW? Or a thin-faced, runny-nosed Czech?
Go back to your books, Wounded Veteran. Don't insist on our wait
ing for the Remarque sort of German. Let's receive the blond Aryan
kind—they look better in uniforms, anyway. Back to your books, you
thin-brained plodder .... "spouting your line of hate." Away from
the company of wiser fellows, Bigot!
CARL W. DAIILSTROM.
