# Can Reason Supplant Emotion?

### 
To the Editor:
Friday's editorial, "Emotion vs. Reason," strikes me as being singularly
devoid of either reason or substance. The Daily hails with its highest
approval the great prevalence of humanitarian sentiment in the replies
to "Wounded Veteran's" letter, and decries the substitution of emotion for
reason as being responsible for many "faulty attitudes."
The suggestion that some attitudes are faulty, the implication that hu
manitarianism is desirable, both imply a standard of judgment or morality.
However, any such standard must of necessity L? based on emotion rather
than reason; it is recognized by most moralists that moral standards are
incapable of being rationally demonstrated. If we accept huumanitarianism
as a desirable end, we must realize that the basis of this acceptance is non
rational. Likewise, if "Wounded Veteran" finds that his hatred for the
recently vanquished enemy outweighs his humanitarian instincts, this also
is an emotional, non-rational attitude.
It is logically impossible to weigh the merits of one of these emotions
against the other. Thus The Daily errs (1) in assuming that reason can
supplant emotion, and (2) in implying that humanitarianism is rationally
superior to hatred of the Germans; neither can be proved to be right, and
one personal conviction is no better than another.
Too often contributors to The Daily, whether staff or readers, cloak
their own emotions in the thin, worth' ss fabric of a fallacious logic.
Further, the idea that humanitarianism is the road to world under
standing is, IN MY OPINION, fallacious. As Clemenceau once said, if men
were all brothers the Sermon on the Mount would have been realized some
time ago. Perhaps hard-headed calculation of the human realities in
volved would be better insurance against future strife than "petting mad
dogs."
