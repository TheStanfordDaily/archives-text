World Federalists
To the Editor:
In the Friday issue of The Daily
a letter was printed which slammed
an organization on campus known
as the Student World Federalists.
It is obvious from the tone of the
letter that the person who wrote
it knows very little of the beliefs,
proposals, or actions of this group,
which is the student branch of the
United World Federalists.
He does not know that its ideas
are part of a world-wide move
ment supported by such men as
Albert Einstein, Arnold Toynbee.
the late Mahatma Gandhi, Win
ston Churchill, and a few other
persons who have "no" knowl
| edge of international affairs.
There is varied opinion as to
WHEN the desired government can
be set up, and there are several al
ternative methods advocated for
doing so. But I would venture to
say that Mr. Vandevar has not
carefully examined any of the pos
sibilities, that he is one of those
people who believe war is neces
sary and even desirable, in spite of
the fact that a war waged today
with atomic and bacterial weapons
would end civilization as we know
it. He is not willing to see that
there is a chance that international
relations may yet be organized
under a system of law which could
bring some order out of chaos, and
make peace possible.
The Federalists believe that
new problems of the atomic age
demand different methods for
solving than have been used pre
viously. They have devised a
plan which seems backed up by
the precedent of federal govern
ment in the United States, Can
ada, Australia, and elsewhere,
but which is new in its applica
tion to world affairs. The Feder
alists believe that a supra-na
tional government is needed,
with an elected legislative body
having power to make laws in
certain limited fields which
would be binding upon individ
uals everywhere.
They believe that such a govern
ment must have an executive to
enforce the laws, and a police
force. It must be able to tax in
certain designated ways to support
itself, independent of national do
nations, and it must have a mo
nopoly of atomic power. In other
words, it must be a government
with power enough to pi'event war,
and yet limited enough to guaran
tee the nations conti'ol of their in
ternal affairs. It must have a judi
ciary, and those other departments
which characterize a government.
It is a tragedy that the United
Nations, which has done so much
constructive work in non-politi
cal fields, is actually only a treaty
among nation-states, and is pow
erless to enforce its decisions
even when there is agreement
between the two great rivals (as
in the case of Palestine). One
of the methods proposed for
achieving world government is to
strengthen that body, by amend
ment processes in Article 109 of
its Charter, into a government
with real power to keep the
peace.
Perhaps the world is doomed to
destruction — but to assume that
such is the case without even en
tering the real fight for human life
and peace, which is only the be
ginning of advance toward a better
world, seems the path of a coward.
I, for one, do not wish to see the
entire struggles of mankind to im
prove himself and his world, if ever
so little, end in nothingness. I be
lieve that a solution outside of war
is possible, and that it is up to each
individual to contribute what he
can to finding it.

There is varied opinion as to
WHEN the desired government can

say that Mr. Vandevar has not
carefully examined any of the pos
sibilities, that he is one of those
people who believe war is neces
sary and even desirable, in spite of
the fact that a war waged today
with atomic and bacterial weapons
would end civilization as we know
it. He is not willing to see that
there is a chance that international
relations may yet be organized
under a system of law which could
bring some order out of chaos, and
make peace possible.
The Federalists believe that
new problems of the atomic age
demand different methods for
solving than have been used pre
viously. They have devised a
plan which seems backed up by
the precedent of federal govern
ment in the United States, Can
ada, Australia, and elsewhere,
but which is new in its applica
tion to world affairs. The Feder
alists believe that a supra-na
tional government is needed,
with an elected legislative body
having power to make laws in
certain limited fields which
would be binding upon individ
uals everywhere.
They believe that such a govern
ment must have an executive to
enforce the laws, and a police
force. It must be able to tax in
certain designated ways to support
itself, independent of national do
nations, and it must have a mo
nopoly of atomic power. In other
words, it must be a government
with power enough to pi'event war,
and yet limited enough to guaran
tee the nations conti'ol of their in
ternal affairs. It must have a judi
ciary, and those other departments
which characterize a government.
It is a tragedy that the United
Nations, which has done so much
constructive work in non-politi
cal fields, is actually only a treaty
among nation-states, and is pow
erless to enforce its decisions
even when there is agreement
between the two great rivals (as
in the case of Palestine). One
of the methods proposed for
achieving world government is to
strengthen that body, by amend
ment processes in Article 109 of
its Charter, into a government
with real power to keep the
peace.
Perhaps the world is doomed to
destruction — but to assume that
such is the case without even en
tering the real fight for human life
and peace, which is only the be
ginning of advance toward a better
world, seems the path of a coward.
I, for one, do not wish to see the
entire struggles of mankind to im
prove himself and his world, if ever
so little, end in nothingness. I be
lieve that a solution outside of war
is possible, and that it is up to each
individual to contribute what he
can to finding it.
