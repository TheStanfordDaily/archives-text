To the Editor:
Superman at last! Who is this
Superman with the Superbrain
calling himself Henry Vandevar?
What manner of Superintellect is
this, which has produced the pro
found thought: "Any type of world
government is impossible"? Let us
hear more Superstatements from
this Superstudent of international
relations. We crouch at his feet,
awaiting more Superpearls of Su
oer wisdom!
