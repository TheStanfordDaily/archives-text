# Atom Expert Says Hiroshima Was Mistake
## 
### 
Dr. Leo Szilard, eminent atom
scientist and professor of radio
biology and bio-physics at the Uni
versity of Chicago, was a visitor on
the campus Wednesday.
At the present time Dr. Szilard is
studying the mutations of bacteria
in bacteria viruses. He stopped at
Stanford on his way to visit Pacific-
Grove.
Born in Hungary, Dr. Szilard
came to this country for the first
time in 1931. In early March of
1939 a group of foreign-born scien
tists, centered around Dr. Szilard,
became interested in the possibili
ties of atomic fission.
In a preliminary experiment they
had found that neutrons are emit
ted from uranium when it is bom
barded with neutrons.
They went to the late President
Roosevelt suggesting that a com
mittee be appointed to study the
possibilities of this. The committee
was appointed and an original grant
made for further study.
With this beginning the scientists
at the University of Chicago started
the research that eventually pro
duced the atom bomb. Dr. Szilard
remained in this work until Hiro
shima.
The scientists who worked on
the bomb feel that Hiroshima was
a mistake, Dr. Szilard said. Sixty
three members of the Chicago proj
ect signed a petition to the Presi
dent to that effect.
It seemed doubtful to them that
the use of the atom bomb was a
military necessity at that time, he
said. They felt that the United
States should not have set a prece
dent for using the atom bomb for
destruction.
Atom bomb projects are in oper
ation in Canada and in France. The
Russians undoubtedly have a simi
lar project. "The greatest step is
the recognition of the problem," Dr.
Szilard said. "Once you recognize
it you are half-way toward its so
lution."
