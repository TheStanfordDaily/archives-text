ALBANY. N.Y., Aug. 12 (UP).â€”
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, Republican
Presidential candidate, will conduct
a "vigorous, constructive" campaign
from coast to coast in an effort to
elect the GOP ticket "from top to
bottom," it was announced today.
Herbert Brownell, Jr., Dewey's
campaign manager, said one of the
most extensive drives in the history
of the Republican party was in the
making "even though we are away
out in front." He said definite dates
and places for major campaign
speeches were being worked out
with party leaders.
"Governor Dewey and Gover
nor Warren will conduct a vigor
ous, constructive campaign and
they will travel extensively
throughout the country," Brownell
told a press conference. He added
that many requests for personal ap
pearances have ben received from
Southern and so - called border
states.
Terming the Dewey - Warren
ticket a "great team." Brownell said,
"Many thousands of Democrats and
independents" are coming over to
the GOP cause. He said the re
sponse to the Republican national
ticket was "the most favorable" in
his memory.
He said voters are impressed by
the "integrity, courage, and good
administrative records of Governor
Dewey and Governor Warren."
And the Democrats, he said, have
shown their utter ineffectiveness as
an instrument for good govern
ment.
