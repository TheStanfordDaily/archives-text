## Says Spy Scare Just Red Herring 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 (UP)
President Truman today brand
ed the GOP - controlled 80th
Congress a do - nothing Con
gress and answered Republican
claims that prices are leveling
off, saying: Yes, they are level
tng off—at higher levels.
Earlier, Democratic National
Chairman J. Howard McGrath had
challenged GOP Presidential nomi
nee Thomas E. Dewey to ''take a
positive stand on the record of the
recent special session. He said
Dewey refused to talk while Con
gress was in session "when there
was any danger he might have to
produce some Congressional action
to back up his statements."
Mr. Truman refused at his news
conference to be drawn into any
pip aq }ng •Xa/waQ ajndsip
say the GOP anti-inflation bill will
not stop rising prices and he can't
agree with Sen. Robert A. Taft's
prediction of a leveling off in
prices.
The President probably will act
on the bill tomorrow. He is ex
pected to sign it, but denounce the
Republicans again for their failure
to enact wage - price controls and
rationing as he requested.
The President again charged that
the current Congressional spy in
vestigation is a red herring to di
vert attention from Congress' fail
ure to act on prices and housing.
But this time he added that it
was a red herring of the strongest
type you can smell.
He pointed out that it took Con
gress only 40 minutes to act on the
$65,000,000 United Nations building
loan, and went on to say that if
GOP Congressional leaders really
wanted to, they could have acted
just as fast on the Taft-Ellender-
Wagner Housing Bill and on fed
eral aid to education.
Taft and other Senate and House
leaders had declared on adjourning
the special session that it would
take six months to enact—after ju
dicious consideration—the 11-poir.t
program the White House had de
manded.


PRESIDENT lIARRY S. TRU
MAN yesterday denounced the
NOtli Congress as a "Do-Nothing"
Congress and said the GOP anti
inflation hill would not halt ris
ing prices.
