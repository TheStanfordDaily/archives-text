THE SPACE
OWN BACK YARD
A poem in three stanzas
by
6. |. Carter
I've cycled through the Orient,
Cone through Europe as a hiker.
And my gastronomic travels
Make poor Duncan seem a piker.
But the food was poor in London,
I dined badly on the Quai,
|ust couldn't eat in Shanghai,
Almost starved in Mandalay.
Now I can't remember Shepheard's
Or those luncheons on the Marne,
But of what am I reminded?
Right? Those dinners at
LONCBARN!
Well, start starving yourself so you
can do justice to all that good food
you're going to get when you visit
us on the house at
LONCBARN
No doubt about it! 20 percent!
Bells! Birds! New Kitchen! It's
LB all right.
