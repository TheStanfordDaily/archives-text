# Farm Play, 'The Rivals', Receives Critic's Praise
## 
### DICK BIESER 
The Stanford Players' produc
tion of "The Rivals" last weekend
was well done. By and large the
cast turned in creditable perform
ances in roles that were well un
derstood and carefully interpreted.
Roy Poole came very close to
taking top honors for his perform
ance as Faulkland. and Richard
Egan was very good as Captain
Absolute.
Mr. Egan has two excellent per
formances to his credit this sum
mer—first as Lennie in the Studio
Theater production of "Of Mice and
Men," and last weekend in the
widely different role of the captain.
Aline MacMahon was a pleasing
Mrs. Malaprop. But her perform
ance did not equal her role as Rose
Mamai in '"L'Arlesienne."
Clarence Derwent was excellent
as Sir Anthony Absolute. And
Whitford Kane turned in a good
performance aa Sir Lucius OTrig
ger, although the part was a lim

ited one and did not give him a
great deal of opportunity.
David Hawes as Acres, Nancy
DeGroot as Lucy, and PrLscilla
Pointer as Julia were all very good.
Frances Waller was not too con
vincing as Lydia Languish. Her
accent was such that the audience
expected her to say, "Heigh ho, you
all," at any moment.
Walt Witcover over-acted in his
part as David.
The scenery, the costumes, and
the lighting were unusually good.
The most legitimate complaint
one might register would be in re
gard to the choice of the play. While
much of it was entertaining, there
were also parts that were long and
tiresome to the audience.
The introduction by Fag and
Thomas in the first scene was a
discouraging beginning. Not only
was the language round-about, but
it was very difficult to understand
William Vorenberg, who played
Thomas.
