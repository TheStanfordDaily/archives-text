# Russ Raise Charges Against U.S. Officer
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Aug. 15 (UP). â€” The Soviet newspaper Pravda
charged today that a U.S. naval officer was caught stealing secret
military information and was expelled from Russia after confess
ing he was a spy.
The newspaper said that Lt. Robert H. Dreher of Oil City, Pa.,

admitted acting as a spy when he
was arrested four months ago after
a struggle by Soviet security offi
cers. A Russian customs official
identified only as "E" reportedly
was captured with the American
officer.
Dreher was assistant naval atta
che for air at the U.S. embassy at
the time of his alleged arrest in
April.
TIIE EVIDENCE against him was
"so indisputable that the American
embassy did not attempt to chal
lenge it" or to block his expulsion,
Pravda said. There was no indica
tion that any attempt had been
made to imprison Dreher, presum
ably because of his diplomatic pass
port.
The U.S. embassy confirmed thai
Dreher left Moscow at Soviet re
quest, but did not comment on the
"spy" charge.
Pravda's accusation against Dre
her came as the Soviet press anc
radio suddenly ceased reporting
developments in the cases of Mi
khail L Samarin and Mrs. Oksana
S. Kosenkina, Soviet schoolteachers
who refused to return to Russia
from posts in the United States.
THE PRAVDA STORY, under
the headline "American Spy
Caught Redhanded!" said that Dre
her was arrested April 23 in a va
cant customs office in Moscow,
where he allegedly was receiving
secret information from "E."
When high customs officials and
security officers rounded up the
pair, Pravda said. Dreher con
fessed :
"112 confirm that 1 received secret
data from 'E', which 112 entered in
my notebook, fn January of this
year, I actually met him in the
custom house, and also received se
cret information."
