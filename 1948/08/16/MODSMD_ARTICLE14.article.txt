# PREPARE YOUR CAR NOW

"Gad! How'U I be able to afford
the reg dance now?"
It costs lots of money to have
mechanics dawdle with the innards
of your car once the damage is
done. Therefore, let us make one
little suggestion. Now that dead
week is coming up and books in
stead of the popular 500 will get
the handling, drive around to any
one of these places for that ounce
of prevention.

Things have been moving pretty
fast around here and you've prob
ably put on quite a bit of mileage
since the last check-up. Just for
the heck of it, you ought to make a
test run over corrugated Palm Drive
alone and with the radio off and
hear all the strange noises. That's
surprising enough, but what about
all the things you can't hear?
A thorough check-up and minor
adjustments now will prevent ex
pensive neglect and give your bill
fold that satisfying bulge come gay
fall quarter.

It isn't necessary to spend vaca
tion sitting around while the car is
in the garage. After all, there are
only thirty days of that precious
period and you don't want to waste
it waiting for the old wagon to get
ready to roll. Have it taken care
of before vacation so you'll be free
to take off without a care in the
world. Just sit and steer that purr
ing machine and congratulate your
self for the money you'll have
saved.

The school term is drawing to a
close, but the motorist's responsi
bility for careful driving never
ends. To protect others, drive care
fully and to protect yourself re
member that a car in good condi
tion is the best safeguard, next to
personal vigilance, of the lives and
property of yourself and others.
You can protect your car by re

membering these simple tacts::
Sufficient heat is developed by
the average automobile engine to
warm a six - room house in zero
weather. Even a slightly clogged
radiator retards circulation of wa
ter and causes overheating.
In order to dissipate excess heat,
water must circulate freely through
the engine block and radiator.
