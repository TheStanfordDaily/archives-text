# Veterans Advised To Check Policies
## 
### 
All veterans should give their
National Life Insurance policies
periodic "three - way checks" to
make certain that their NSLI pro
grams are consistent with their
plans, obligations, and income, Vet
erans Administration advised yes
terday.
The "three - way check" should
cover (1) beneficiaries, both prin
cipal and contingent; (2) manner in
which proceeds are to be paid to
beneficiaries; and (3) amount and
type of NSLI in force.
"Many veterans fail to name new
beneficiaries when they marry or
when a designated beneficiary
dies," VA said.
If a veteran dies without naming
a beneficiary, or if no designated
beneficiary is alive at the time of
his death, proceeds of the insurance
go into his estate and are subject to
inheritance taxes.
Changes in family status or fam
ily income often require a veteran
to change the method of NSLI set
tlement. He may elect to have his
NSLI proceeds paid to his benefi
ciary in a lump sum or in equal
monthly installments ranging from
36 to lifetime income.
