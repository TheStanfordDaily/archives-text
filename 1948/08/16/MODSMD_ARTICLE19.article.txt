WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 (UP).â€”
Communists will be drafted into the
U.S. Army along with other men 19
through 25, but elaborate machin
ery has been set up to keep them
out of secret military jobs, it was
disclosed today.
Army intelligence officials are
close-mouthed on the subject.
It is known, however, that the
Army had a '"loyalty check" of men
in uniform operating years before
President Truman ordered a simi
lar investigation of civilian em
ployees of the government.
The civilian loyalty check is
aimed at weeding Communists out
of the government entirely. The
Army's is designed primarily to
channel posible "subversives" into
jobs whore they can do no harm.
