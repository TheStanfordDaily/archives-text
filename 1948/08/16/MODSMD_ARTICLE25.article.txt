## Better Exams 
### 
Written examinations are the only basis for the grade in many
courses at Stanford. Students have a right to expect that these
examinations will give them an adequate opportunity to show
what they have learned.
Too often, however, the exam only reveals how well the stu
dent can write, or how much extraneous material he has picked
up. The emphasis in the course is often ignored, and the ques
tions are frequently irrelevant.
Most instructors prepare their lectures and texts carefully.
But too many of them do not take the time to see that exams are
cf the same high quality.
We feel that each instructor should be asked, "Is the mate
rial in your exams a good representation of what you emphasize
in the course?" The answer would be embarrassing in many
Cc.ses.
A definition of a good examination is one that shows the
following:
1. That the student is familiar with the general aspects of the
course.
2. That he can illustrate the general aspects with important
specific points.
3. That he has recognized the emphasis in the course.
4. That he has fulfilled the outside requirements of the course.
When students are given intelligent and carefully prepared
tests, there is much more incentive to study and much less dis
illusionment in general.
