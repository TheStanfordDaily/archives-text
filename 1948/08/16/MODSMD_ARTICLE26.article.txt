# CAMPUS OPINION
## Prejudice Admitted 
### 
To the Editor:
My Gawd! I thought I was going to be hanged as a Communist —but
now it seems I'll walk the last mile accused a Fascist.
With my well-intentioned (if not well-phrased) "Back to Your Books!"
letter I was attempting to BACK UP "Wounded Veteran," NOT cut his
throat. I think a careful and calm re-reading of my masterpiece will
make this plain to any and all.
I'll now express my own humble opinions in terms I hope are under
stood by all interested parties. To wit: I think that Stanford scholarships
should not go to German naval officers, until at least a few more of the
kicked peoples of Europe are taken care of. I doubt that the fact that
the German fought the Russians —rather than the other Allies—makes him
a better candidate for Stanford honors. I am chock-full of prejudices (as
are most people), but racialism sure isn't one of them!
Now I'll have a different mob on my neck . . . maybe flaming crosses
on the hill . . . maybe I could get pushed out of a consul's window . . .
Golly Gee!

P.S. Moral for today: Don't write letters, unless about love . . . even
those don't sign.
