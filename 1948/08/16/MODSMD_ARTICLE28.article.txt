## Student Federalists 
### 
To the Editor:
I wou'd like to answer Henry
Vandevar's letter on the Student
Federalists.
Although Mr. Vandevar and I are
on opposite sides of the fence re
garding world federation in that he
doesn't believe it possible and I do,
I am sure that he—and everyone
else who hates war—will agree with
me that the problem of preventing
future wars should seriously be
considered by all of us.
No person can deny that a fu
ture war may see the end of
civilization a* we know it. The
atomic bombs of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki released only about 1
per cent of the energy possible in
bombs of that size. Those first A
bombs were duds compared to
those that will be used in a fu
ture world war. Atomic by-prod
ucts may be used to contaminate
food and water supplies, bacteri
ological warfare will be employed
in addition to already highly de
veloped conventional methods of
destruction. No point will be
immune from attack on a globe
where no two points are more
than 40 hours apart by conven
tional aircraft.
In view of these facts it is the
duty of every person—who wants
to live and see his children live in
a world free from the certainty of
another war—to seriously consider
every possible plan or method of
eliminating war. No man can afford
not to do these things; no man can
take the responsibility of support
ing a negative attitude, the "can't"
attitude, the attitude that war can't
be prevented—for if he does, he is
not doing his duty by this genera
tion or generations to come, for he
is condemning them to terror and
destruction.
Since I am sure that Mr. Vande
var is a thoughtful person, and
since he does not believe in world
federation, it must be assumed that
he supports what he believes to be
a better method of insuring world
peace. However, since he does not
mention any specic method, it must
be assumed that Mr. Vandevar
fee's that traditional diplomacy and
power politics can secure world
peace.
This historical method has
never been satisfactory in the
past, and I see no reason to be
lieve that it will be in the future.
I'm afraid that all I can see from
the study of international rela
tions suggested by Mr. Vandevar,
is that they are woefully inade
quate to insure freedom from
fear; I also sec that there has
been no world government in the
past, but this does not mean that
world government is not possible
in the future.
For these reasons I believe I'll
cast my lot with those dupes—like
Albert Einstein — who believe in
world federation.
I supoort the World Federalists,
for I believe their ideals, objectives,
and methods are those that are
most compatible with democratic
principles.

me that the problem of preventing
future wars should seriously be
considered by all of us.
No person can deny that a fu
ture war may see the end of
civilization a* we know it. The
atomic bombs of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki released only about 1
per cent of the energy possible in
bombs of that size. Those first A
bombs were duds compared to
those that will be used in a fu
ture world war. Atomic by-prod
ucts may be used to contaminate
food and water supplies, bacteri
ological warfare will be employed
in addition to already highly de
veloped conventional methods of
destruction. No point will be
immune from attack on a globe
where no two points are more
than 40 hours apart by conven
tional aircraft.
In view of these facts it is the
duty of every person—who wants
to live and see his children live in
a world free from the certainty of
another war—to seriously consider
every possible plan or method of
eliminating war. No man can afford
not to do these things; no man can
take the responsibility of support
ing a negative attitude, the "can't"
attitude, the attitude that war can't
be prevented—for if he does, he is
not doing his duty by this genera
tion or generations to come, for he
is condemning them to terror and
destruction.
Since I am sure that Mr. Vande
var is a thoughtful person, and
since he does not believe in world
federation, it must be assumed that
he supports what he believes to be
a better method of insuring world
peace. However, since he does not
mention any specic method, it must
be assumed that Mr. Vandevar
fee's that traditional diplomacy and
power politics can secure world
peace.
This historical method has
never been satisfactory in the
past, and I see no reason to be
lieve that it will be in the future.
I'm afraid that all I can see from
the study of international rela
tions suggested by Mr. Vandevar,
is that they are woefully inade
quate to insure freedom from
fear; I also sec that there has
been no world government in the
past, but this does not mean that
world government is not possible
in the future.
For these reasons I believe I'll
cast my lot with those dupes—like
Albert Einstein — who believe in
world federation.
I supoort the World Federalists,
for I believe their ideals, objectives,
and methods are those that are
most compatible with democratic
principles.

I wou'd like to answer Henry
Vandevar's letter on the Student
Federalists.
Although Mr. Vandevar and I are
on opposite sides of the fence re
garding world federation in that he
doesn't believe it possible and I do,
I am sure that he—and everyone
else who hates war—will agree with
me that the problem of preventing
future wars should seriously be
considered by all of us.
