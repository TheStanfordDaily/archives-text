# Hiss Admits Having Known Time Editor
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UP)
Alger Hiss, former top State Depart
ment official, has finally agreed that
he knows the reformed Communist >
who accused him of membership in j
a pre-war "elite" Red underground, j
the House Un-American Activities j
Committee announced tonight.
Committee members told the press j
that Hiss confronted Time Magazine
editor Whittaker Chambers in the
Hotel Commodore in New York City
today. They said he identified
Chambers as a "George Crosley" j
whom he knew in 1934 and 1935.
THE IDENTIFICATION cracked a
major knot that has blocked the I
committee's investigation of Soviet j
espionage activities. Hiss, up to this j
day, has claimed persistently that he
had never met Chambers.
Rep. John McDowell, Râ€ž Pa., a |
subcommittee member, said that Hiss !
"has finally agreed that Mr. Cham
bers was known to him as George
Crosley."
He also said that Hiss said he sub
let his apartment to "Crosley" and I
"gave" him his automobile.
Committee members said Hiss and
Chambers have been subpoenaed to
appear before the committee in open
session here next Wednesday.
SUBCOMMITTEE ME M IJ ER S,
said only that Hiss had admitted
knowing Chambers under an alias,
and did not say that the former State
Department official had made any
comment on Chamber's charges that
he was a member of a prewar Com- j
munist spy ring.
