# 'Russia Lacks Contact With American Life'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 17 (UP).—
The Soviet Union is making it in
creasingly difficult for the Russian
people to have contact with Ameri
cans or American views, govern
ment officials reported today.
THESE OFFICIALS ASSERTED
that:
1. Russia within the last several
months has clamped down even
tighter on the free movement of
American diplomats and govern
ment personnel within the Soviet
Union.
2. There has been a steady in
crease in the "jamming" of State
Department "Voice of America"
broadcasts beamed to Russia.
3. Soviet government personnel in
the United States has been reduced
by more than 30 per cent during the
last year. However, there still are
more than twice as many official
Russian personnel in the United
States as there are American per
sonnel in Russia.
4. Russia has closed down its
special schools in the United States
for dependents of its government
personnel here and is sending the
children home.
It has always been extremely dif
ficult, but this summer it has be
come almost impossible for Ameri
cans in Russia to carry out plans
for vacations outside Moscow. (Rus
sia never refuses to permit travel
by Americans. The government
merely says it can't find train space
and hotel accommodations for
them.)
OFFICIALS SAID it would be
wrong to draw a direct connection
between these developments, which
started months ago, and the recent
defection of three Russian school
teachers in the United States.
After exposure to the American
way of life, the teachers refused to
go back to Russia. e
