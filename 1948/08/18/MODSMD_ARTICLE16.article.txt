### 
OGDINSBURG, N.Y., Aug. 17 (UP) —The United States and
Canada today repledged their mutual defense co-operation amid
top level talks on joint action in the event of any future emer
gency.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Forrestal travelled here from

♦ Ottawa with Canadian Defense Min
j ister Brooke Claxton to participate
]in a ceremony rededicating U.S.-
Canadian joint defense co-operation.
But shortly before the ceremony
Forrestal left suddenly for Washing
i ton. His aides gave no explanation
j for his early departure.
In Washington the White House
1 denied a report that Forrestal had
| been summoned home for an urgent
conference with President Truman.
Pit ESS SECRETARY Charles G.
| Ross said Mr. Truman has not called
Forrestal back.
There has been no urgent meeting.
Ross said, and no such meeting is
planned.
Forrestal also issued a denial when
he arrived by plane at G:10 p.m. He
j said he had to returned to the capi-
I tal strictly on schedule, that there
| were not emergency conferences
j scheduled, and that he was going
home to dinner.
However, guests at the ceremony
here were told Forrestal's return to
Washington was "unexpected and
I urgent."
F. R. LITTLE, publisher of the
Ogdensburg Journal and chairman
of the ceremony, declared Forrestal
received an "unexpected and urgent
call to return to Washington for an
important conference at the White
! House."
Today's ceremonies climaxed two
days of cabinet-level discussions on
Canadian-American defense. It was
learned that the conferences dealt
mainly with joint action in any fu
j ture emergency, with top priority
given to three projects:
1. The role of Canadian manufac
turing plants and raw materials in
[ any military emergency.
2. Interchange of weapons and
ammunition among the armed forces
of Canada, the United Kingdom, and
1 the United States.
I 3. Standardization of U. S. and
I Canadian arms and ammunition.
