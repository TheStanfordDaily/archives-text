## 
### 
NEW YORK. Aug. 17 (UP).â€”
Mrs. Oksana Stepanova Kosenkina,
Russian school teacher who escaped
i from the Soviet consulate here by
leaping from a third-floor window,
, was given a blood transfusion today
! and still remains in "critical con
! dition."
ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL issued
a special bulletin which revealed
the transfusion. The patient's con
dition still was critical, "no better,
no worse.'' Her temperature today
' was 103. her pulse 120, hospital au
thorities said.
Mrs. Kosenkina, who is under
subpoena by the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee, has been
; in Roosevelt Hospital under a heavy
i police guard since her leap five
[ days ago.
YESTERDAY SOVIET Consul
! General Jacob M. Lomakin said she
; had tried to kill herself to escape
American persecution. He said her
mind had been deranged by what
had happened to her while in the
i hands of the "white guard'" (anti-
Communist Russians) "kidnapers,"
by the "malicious fabrications'' of
the U.S. press and radio, and the
"threats" of the U.S. police and
courts.
But Lomakin's version of the j
middle-aged school teacher's jump
from the consulate contradicted her :
own statements. She told police she
had been held prisoner in the con- !
sulate and that she jumped to avoid !
being returned to her native Russia. j
