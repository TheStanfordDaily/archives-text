# Famed Bookplate Exhibited at Libe
## 
### 
The famous "jewel" bookplate of
Mrs. Stanford is currently being
exhibited along with other plates
from the Stanford Library in the
corridors of the main library.
Mrs. Stanford's jewels were being
held as a last resort to meet Uni
versity expenses. When they were
not needed, she used them in 1905
to establish a permanent library
fund. The books purchased with the
fund are marked with this plate.
The plate was reproduced from a
charcoal drawing and designed by
Edwin Howland Bashfield, a well
known artist of the time. It rep
resents Clio, the muse of history,
offering jewels to Athene, goddess
of learning.
