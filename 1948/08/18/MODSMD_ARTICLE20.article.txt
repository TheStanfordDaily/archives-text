On Communism, the encyclical
said, "Mankind hus only recently j
escaped conquest by totalitarian
states which deified their own power.
It now finds itself threatened by a
new menace of Marxian Communism
which exalts atheism, puts supreme
confidence in material progress and
proclaims its gospel with militant
enthusiasm which expects to conquer
the world.
CHRISTIANS MUST repudiate
this form of Communism and must
condemn its cruelties, injustice and
lying propaganda, which is inherent
in it."
The conference called upon all i
Christians to study and understand
the theory and practice of Com
munism" so that they may be well
instructed as to which elements in
it are in conflict with the Christian
view of man and must therefore be j
resisted and which elements are true
judgement on existing social and
economic order."
