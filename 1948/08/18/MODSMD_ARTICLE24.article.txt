# AUTOMOTIVE FACTS

The 100 millionth motor vehicle
| will soon be produced by the
American automotive industry. Al
though historians concur that the
first United States automobile pow
ered by a gasoline engine was built
at the Duryea plant at Springfield,
Massachusetts, in 1893, none can
know who will build America's 100
millionth vehicle or in what city it
will be built. It will come off the
assembly line of one of 113 auto
mobile assembly plants located in
77 cities in 24 states.
When the 100 millionth vehicle
does come off the line, probably
this month, the automobile indus
try, which is keeping close tab on
individual production, will make an
announcement as to the exact time
of its birth.
It is possible that California may
be the state in which this car is
built, signaling 55 years of motor
vehicle production, for California is
the second state in number of au
tomotive assembly plants, following
Michigan, generally conceded to be
the "automobile center of the
world." There are, declares the Na
tional Automobile Club, now 17 au
tomotive assembly plants in Cali
fornia. Heading the list is Los An
geles with eight, then San Francisco
with two, and one plant in each of
the following cities: El Segundo.
Long Beach, San Leandro, Rich
mond, Oakland, Emeryville, and
Hay ward.
Fifteen per cent of America's au
tomotive assembly plants are lo
cated in California, while the bal
ance are scattered throughout 23
other states of the nation.
