"Heed the 'Signs of Life' and help
reduce highway accidents," was the
appeal of Clifford E. Peterson, com
missioner of the California High
way Patrol, explaining that "Sinns
of Life" arc the traffic signals,
and pavement markings installed on
streets and highways to safeguard
traffic.
"Strict observance of the high
way signs, traffic signals, and street
markings would be an important
step in cutting down our accident
toll," Peterson added. "These de
vices cover almost every situation
the driver will meet."
