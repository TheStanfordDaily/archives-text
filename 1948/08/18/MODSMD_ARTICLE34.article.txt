TIIE PASSING of Babe Ruth took from us a somewhat legendary hero.
| But, by being here, Babe Ruth gave this country a tale of exploits which
j will symbolize our way of life for years to come.
Especially to this generation of young Americans, the name of Babe
Ruth was of prime importance. Youngsters in the 'thirties knew of him
! far earlier in life than they knew of Adolf Hitler, which is as it should
j be, in molding the lives of future citizens.
"The Bambino," as he was called, was a moniker familiar to people
the world over. Not only was he the greatest baseball player of his
time, but he was a way of life to millions of non-Americans who asso
ciated Babe Ruth and America as one and the same.
IIE IS A IRADEMARK in our present day lives. He is the man after
whom candy bars were named, whose signature graces baseball bats
in the hands oi millions of dirty-faced youngsters.
j lo the Japanese, so famous was his name, that it is reported soldiers of
I Nippon, upon invading Southwest Pacific islands, yelled -To hell with
Babe Ruth ' at defending Americans.
Like legendary Paul Bunyan is to leats of strength, Babe Ruth forever
will be a mystic god wherever baseball is played, whenever someone
smacks a home run.
WE VENTURE TO SAY there is no American living who does not
know of his exploits in the national pastime. Future baseball greats, as
those past, will be likened to him, never compared with him.
Without such men as Babe Ruth this country could not exist. He and
his story of rags to riches is the story of America—like the five-cent cigar,
like Abraham Lincoln, like the hot dog, like John D. Rockefeller.
Babe Ruth, swinging to the end, has poled his last four-bagger.

Daily, Stanfoid facts the lull before the athletic storm, which commences
when the Indians tackle San Jose State here September 18th in football.
This year, more than ever before, Stanford athletic fortunes need a
rebirth. In football especially, a strong team would give the spark to
ensuing sports throughout the year—basketball, track, baseball, tennis,
creV, golf, boxing, swimming.
We do not cherish the memory of nine ignominious defeats. However,

"They did not lose the will to win."
There is no need to ever lose that will to win. Nor is there a need
to bow nine times to any foes, big or small.
WE HOPE THIS YEAR that Stanford will set the pace on the Pacific
Coast. We have much top-grade talent in all sports. To take a back seat
j again this year would be wasting it.
When the Farm reopened athletics in 1946, many experts said the
Cardinal would have to make a long uphill climb. We have continually

This year, more than ever before, Stanford athletic fortunes need a
rebirth. In football especially, a strong team would give the spark to
ensuing sports throughout the year—basketball, track, baseball, tennis,
creV, golf, boxing, swimming.
We do not cherish the memory of nine ignominious defeats. However,

"They did not lose the will to win."
There is no need to ever lose that will to win. Nor is there a need
to bow nine times to any foes, big or small.
WE HOPE THIS YEAR that Stanford will set the pace on the Pacific
Coast. We have much top-grade talent in all sports. To take a back seat
j again this year would be wasting it.

TIIE PASSING of Babe Ruth took from us a somewhat legendary hero.
| But, by being here, Babe Ruth gave this country a tale of exploits which
j will symbolize our way of life for years to come.
Especially to this generation of young Americans, the name of Babe
Ruth was of prime importance. Youngsters in the 'thirties knew of him
! far earlier in life than they knew of Adolf Hitler, which is as it should
j be, in molding the lives of future citizens.
"The Bambino," as he was called, was a moniker familiar to people
the world over. Not only was he the greatest baseball player of his
time, but he was a way of life to millions of non-Americans who asso
ciated Babe Ruth and America as one and the same.
IIE IS A IRADEMARK in our present day lives. He is the man after
whom candy bars were named, whose signature graces baseball bats
in the hands oi millions of dirty-faced youngsters.
j lo the Japanese, so famous was his name, that it is reported soldiers of
I Nippon, upon invading Southwest Pacific islands, yelled -To hell with
Babe Ruth ' at defending Americans.
Like legendary Paul Bunyan is to leats of strength, Babe Ruth forever
will be a mystic god wherever baseball is played, whenever someone
smacks a home run.
WE VENTURE TO SAY there is no American living who does not
know of his exploits in the national pastime. Future baseball greats, as
those past, will be likened to him, never compared with him.
Without such men as Babe Ruth this country could not exist. He and
his story of rags to riches is the story of America—like the five-cent cigar,
like Abraham Lincoln, like the hot dog, like John D. Rockefeller.
Babe Ruth, swinging to the end, has poled his last four-bagger.
