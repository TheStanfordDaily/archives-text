## It's Grid Season Again; Don's Prospectus Is Out 
### ART LEVINSON 
Don Liebendorfer, Stanford's sports publicity chieftain, has
issued his annual football dossier, and this voluminous publica
tion includes everything down to what the fourth-string tackle
bad for breakfast on Dec. 2, 1936.
The work of issuing sports manuscripts is old business to

Don L., who is dean of Pacific Coast •*
Conference publicity directors.
He has been toiling faithfully for
Stanford since 1923, when he was
graduated here in the journalism de
partment. At the time of his appoint- j
incnt, he was the lone man in his
field, but soon other colleges began
hiring tub-thumpers, and now. every ;
school from the size of California \
down to little Podunk U. in Ashcan,
Arkansas, has a paid publicity man
on its stalT.
His tasks include preparing ad
vance publicity copy on Stanford's
athletic forces, snapping photos of
Indian athletes, and in general, i
keeping newspapermen in a good
frame of mind.
The fruits of his labors were par
ticularly noticeable last autumn, j
when the football team was engaged 1
in long football game after football
game. Instead of receiving a nasty
press reception, Stanford's football
team got real sympathy from the i
fourth estate.
M a rchi e Schwartz's particular 1
problems were realized by the news
paper reporters, but Liebendorfer s :
Ion:-standing friendship with the
scribes played an important part, too. !
in this press reception.
Don's busy season is in the fall,
during the pigskin season. When
Stanford plays out-of-town engage
ments, Liebendorfer scoots off to the !
visiting metropolis one week in ad- !
vance, where he contacts the men of
radio and newspaper.
Mr. Don also handles all of the
announcing at athletic contests,
which has earned him the moniker
of "The Voice of Stanford Stadium.'" ;
