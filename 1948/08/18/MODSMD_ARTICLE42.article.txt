# Throngs View Ruth's Body In New York
## 
### 
YANKEE STADIUM. New York.
Aug. 17 (UP). — "The Babe" was
home again in "the house that Ruth
built" tonight and, as in the days
of yore, the multitude was there,
paying him tribute.
But it was a sorrowing multitude
pouring through the gates of this
largest and most magnificent of all
ball parks—in contrast tu the happy
and tensely expectant multitudes
which used to pour through the
same gates to see "The Babe" when
lie was alive and in his prime and
reigning supreme, "the Sultan of
Swat."
When the gates were opened at
5 p.m., his mourning admirers —
men, women, and children — were
formed up for a block and by 5:30
p.m. the line extended all around
the vast stadium which covers ap
proximately six city blocks.
