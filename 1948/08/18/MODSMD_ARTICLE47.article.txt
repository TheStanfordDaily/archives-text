# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Looking Ahead 
### 
This summer on the Farm has pretty much like any other
quarter. We have seen controversy, apathy, and more than a
little hate and prejudice.
Campus Opinion called our attention to a variety of subjects.
An irate second-story Toyon man claimed our attention. A dis
gruntled cellar customer or two registered their complaints about
the food there. People complained about the Sunday movies,
the swimming pool fee, History 1948, campus recreation, and
the absence of 3.2 beer on campus.
Editorially we wondered about such things as unannounced
quizzes, the peacetime draft, artists in residence, rooters caps,
question periods, and Farm examinations.
We expressed our ideas on how question periods should be
conducted, what makes good exams, and what happens in a
world of hate and prejudice.
Now that it's all over, and the last issue of The Summer Daily
is going to press, we find ourselves wondering what it takes
to make a good student.
We wonder if before the war there was the same terrific em
phasis on gradesâ€”on the part of both profs and students. If
there is any one criticism that can be made of the student body
as a group, it is that there is entirely too much emphasis on
getting the grades, getting the diploma, and getting out.
The blame for such a condition probably lies on a society
that places too much emphasis on a diploma as such, and too
little emphasis on what the individual has learned, or what
he is capable of doing on the job.
Perhaps some day in the future, people will come to Stanford
not because they like palm trees, the climate, and Memorial
Church; not because they want to knock out 180 units for a
degree, but because it is a fine place to learn something.
When such a change takes place, perhaps the professorial
staff will respond accordingly. Maybe then even the gruitest
Daily editor will settle back approvingly, liking what he sees.
