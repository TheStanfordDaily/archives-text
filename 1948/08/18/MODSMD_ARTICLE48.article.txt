WASHINGTON, D.C.. Aug 17 — Canada's curiously named
Flin Flon—in whose vicinity two uranium strikes have been reported
within recent months—was an important mining center long before
atomic-energy demands brought uranium new and dramatic value. It
also is the source of a legend not unworthy of the fabulous properties
ol the new mineral.
The tall, smoke-pouring chimneys of Flin ITon rise in the heart of
•he Dominion, in the rocky, lake-spattered region that geologists call
the Canadian Shield, notes the National Geographic Society. How the
town got its name is uncertain, but specialists in tall tales ha\e
evolved some colorful legends to explain it.
One of the best tells how early prospectors in the neighborhood found a
lurid dime novel whose hero was named Joseph Flintabbaty F'.onatin.
After a series of fabulous travels, this Flintabbaty Flonatin had come
to a hidden land ruled by Amazons, where gold was so plentifu. that
tin was used lor money. The end of the novel was unfortunately torn
off, preventing furthter knowledge of the secret land. Then one of the
prospectors came on a great hole in the earth full of gold-bearing ois.
"I've found Flin Finn's mine." he exclaimed. And so the town thut sprung
up was named.
Flin Flon is considered part of Manitoba, hut actually lies just on thi»
border between that province and itN western neighbor. Saskatchewan
Though the mine head is on the Manitoba side, its fields of copper,
/inc. and gold-containing ores extend into Saskatchewan.
The uranium, too, has been discovered nearby in both province l ;
■with still another radioactive find turned up lately at Lake La Ronge,
in north-central Saskatchewan.
Flin Flon now has a population of eight to nine thousand people— which
makes it something of a metropolis in this sparsely-settled northland of
furs, fish, and forests, far beyond Manitoba's fertile grainfiolds and major
cities. Climate is severe, with art annual range from such extremes 33 90
degrees Fahrenheit in summer to 40 below in winter.
