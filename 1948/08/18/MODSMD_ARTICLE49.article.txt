# CAMPUS OPINION
## ‘Tolerance’ 
### 
To the Editor:
This is perhaps overdue comment on the speech
of Bohus Benes at the Tuesday Evening Series, and
his comments on his great relative, Eduard.
One must understand that when Dr. Benes spoke,
other factors besides what he actually felt influenced
anything he said. As he pointed out, Dr. Eduard
Benes is now virtually a hostage of Communism.
Further, Communism does rule his country, and if
he had plunged himself into a long tirade against
Stalin, Gottwald. and company, nothing could be
accomplished save more evil for his unfortunate and
ground-under nation.
Also, as a Benes, Dr. Bohus was virtually forced
to make a complete defense of the policies of his
distinguished relative. All this can be understood,
and all this can be sympathized with. Yet the
final gist of his niesage, the appeal to "tolerance"
of intolerant Communism, which he said motivated
Eduard in the last days of the third Czechoslovak
crisis, must be examined carefully, and commented
on accordingly.
Dr. Bohus Benes gave a very excellent justification
of the unattackable attitude which Eduard took after
Munich; when he backed down to Hitler without a
fight, seeking to save lives after the betrayal of
his country by the Western Powers. Yet. the complete
backdown to Gottwald is a different question en
tirely.
Dr. Bohus Benes indicated that Eduard was sur
prised at the purges and repressions of liberty which
followed the establishment of the "Peoples' Repub
lic." In the days before Stalin indulged in the myth
of "respectable Communism," Gottwald had told
the nation, "I am here to break heads." When he
came into power, and did break heads, it thus
shouldn't have surprised anybody, especially with
the terroristic pattern established for him all over
Eastern Europe, that he did just what he iiaid he
was going to.
Secondly, it is very interesting to look at just
what historical significance Benes' surrender with
out a light will have. If the more-than-distinct
probability of war between East and West becomes
actuality, Czechoslovakia will be dragooned into
the conflict on the Eastern side.
If that side wins, Czechoslovak soldiers will have
fought to preserve the slavery of their nation. If
the East loses, which all civilized humanity must
certainly hope will happen, then Germany, the arch
enemy of Czechoslovakia, will come out of the con
flict an ally of the winners, while Czechoslovakia
herself will be a defeated enemy.
Of course other enemies of that state—Hungary
and Poland, for instance—will also be on the de
feated side. Yet they can say to the winners, al
though they aren't humanitarian or particularly
democratic, that they hate Communism as much
as the Czechs, and that they at least proved to the
world they know how to fight.
To many young idealists in this university, such
an argument would be meaningless. To hard-headed
statesmen, thinking in terms of a Central Europe re
drawn to aid in the repression both of German na
tionalism and any Russian renaissance, it will be
more than significant.
The result would almost be that such states would
be allowed to write their own territorial tickets,
while Czechoslovakia would not. Also, any encroach
ment into the natural European arsenal of Czecho
slovakia might well be winked at.
I did not write this letter earlier because I thought
that most studi nts realized Boluis Benes said what
he did. and accepted what he said about "tolerance"
accordingly. However, an unsophisticated minority
have not thought "tolerance" in international af
fairs is just what the world needs, that Benes said
something really deep-seated and profound, and
that the only way for both internal and external
peace is the "middle road." "tolerance" of our
Communistic enemies, etc., etc., ad nauseum.
How many of them are the imbecile annex to the
Wallaceite scum, I do not know. But in case of addi
tions the history of Czechoslovakia in the past few
years, and ol Eduard Benes' relations with the Com
munists, proves what had already been proved to
our diplomats and negotiators in Europe. Namely,
we are not only dealing with an ideology, but a col
lection of animal-like, ruthless, doublecrossinc rep
robates.
Any concession given them tiiey have used as a
tactical weapon in their fight. Any nation that tol
eiates them to such an extent, their intrigues and
activities go completely uncurbed, finds they use
this to undermine such state, and eventually to over
throw it if they can. Any idea of "tolerance" of Sov
iet Russia, oi' its foreign agents when they get into
key positions, is completely stupid.
One could see from the facts which Benes pre
sented. that the Communists fight in an ideological
gutter with the weapons of a moral gutter. "Tol
erance" through "humanitarian democracy" sent
Czechoslovakia along a road that could have been
honorably alleviated by the slightest resistance to
Gottwald's coup, which would have forced the
Red Army to invade and make C. xhoslovakia a
conquered nation rather than, seemingly, semi
willing tool.
America does not intend to go along this road Mav
one corespondent to this paper suggest a wav to
stay oft ot it is. in international and domestic affairs
to go down into this gutter and fight it out with
Communism on its own terms, instead of talking high
t.own ideals while our asassins gather in the shadows.

other factors besides what he actually felt influenced
anything he said. As he pointed out, Dr. Eduard
Benes is now virtually a hostage of Communism.
Further, Communism does rule his country, and if
he had plunged himself into a long tirade against
Stalin, Gottwald. and company, nothing could be
accomplished save more evil for his unfortunate and
ground-under nation.
Also, as a Benes, Dr. Bohus was virtually forced
to make a complete defense of the policies of his
distinguished relative. All this can be understood,
and all this can be sympathized with. Yet the
final gist of his niesage, the appeal to "tolerance"
of intolerant Communism, which he said motivated
Eduard in the last days of the third Czechoslovak
crisis, must be examined carefully, and commented
on accordingly.
Dr. Bohus Benes gave a very excellent justification
of the unattackable attitude which Eduard took after
Munich; when he backed down to Hitler without a
fight, seeking to save lives after the betrayal of
his country by the Western Powers. Yet. the complete
backdown to Gottwald is a different question en
tirely.
Dr. Bohus Benes indicated that Eduard was sur
prised at the purges and repressions of liberty which
followed the establishment of the "Peoples' Repub
lic." In the days before Stalin indulged in the myth
of "respectable Communism," Gottwald had told
the nation, "I am here to break heads." When he
came into power, and did break heads, it thus
shouldn't have surprised anybody, especially with
the terroristic pattern established for him all over
Eastern Europe, that he did just what he iiaid he
was going to.
Secondly, it is very interesting to look at just
what historical significance Benes' surrender with
out a light will have. If the more-than-distinct
probability of war between East and West becomes
actuality, Czechoslovakia will be dragooned into
the conflict on the Eastern side.
If that side wins, Czechoslovak soldiers will have
fought to preserve the slavery of their nation. If
the East loses, which all civilized humanity must
certainly hope will happen, then Germany, the arch
enemy of Czechoslovakia, will come out of the con
flict an ally of the winners, while Czechoslovakia
herself will be a defeated enemy.
Of course other enemies of that state—Hungary
and Poland, for instance—will also be on the de
feated side. Yet they can say to the winners, al
though they aren't humanitarian or particularly
democratic, that they hate Communism as much
as the Czechs, and that they at least proved to the
world they know how to fight.
To many young idealists in this university, such
an argument would be meaningless. To hard-headed
statesmen, thinking in terms of a Central Europe re
drawn to aid in the repression both of German na
tionalism and any Russian renaissance, it will be
more than significant.
The result would almost be that such states would
be allowed to write their own territorial tickets,
while Czechoslovakia would not. Also, any encroach
ment into the natural European arsenal of Czecho
slovakia might well be winked at.
I did not write this letter earlier because I thought
that most studi nts realized Boluis Benes said what
he did. and accepted what he said about "tolerance"
accordingly. However, an unsophisticated minority
have not thought "tolerance" in international af
fairs is just what the world needs, that Benes said
something really deep-seated and profound, and
that the only way for both internal and external
peace is the "middle road." "tolerance" of our
Communistic enemies, etc., etc., ad nauseum.
How many of them are the imbecile annex to the
Wallaceite scum, I do not know. But in case of addi
tions the history of Czechoslovakia in the past few
years, and ol Eduard Benes' relations with the Com
munists, proves what had already been proved to
our diplomats and negotiators in Europe. Namely,
we are not only dealing with an ideology, but a col
lection of animal-like, ruthless, doublecrossinc rep
robates.
Any concession given them tiiey have used as a
tactical weapon in their fight. Any nation that tol
eiates them to such an extent, their intrigues and
activities go completely uncurbed, finds they use
this to undermine such state, and eventually to over
throw it if they can. Any idea of "tolerance" of Sov
iet Russia, oi' its foreign agents when they get into
key positions, is completely stupid.
One could see from the facts which Benes pre
sented. that the Communists fight in an ideological
gutter with the weapons of a moral gutter. "Tol
erance" through "humanitarian democracy" sent
Czechoslovakia along a road that could have been
honorably alleviated by the slightest resistance to
Gottwald's coup, which would have forced the
Red Army to invade and make C. xhoslovakia a
conquered nation rather than, seemingly, semi
willing tool.
America does not intend to go along this road Mav
one corespondent to this paper suggest a wav to
stay oft ot it is. in international and domestic affairs
to go down into this gutter and fight it out with
Communism on its own terms, instead of talking high
t.own ideals while our asassins gather in the shadows.

he had plunged himself into a long tirade against
Stalin, Gottwald. and company, nothing could be
accomplished save more evil for his unfortunate and
ground-under nation.
Also, as a Benes, Dr. Bohus was virtually forced
to make a complete defense of the policies of his
distinguished relative. All this can be understood,
and all this can be sympathized with. Yet the
final gist of his niesage, the appeal to "tolerance"
of intolerant Communism, which he said motivated
Eduard in the last days of the third Czechoslovak
crisis, must be examined carefully, and commented
on accordingly.
Dr. Bohus Benes gave a very excellent justification
of the unattackable attitude which Eduard took after
Munich; when he backed down to Hitler without a
fight, seeking to save lives after the betrayal of
his country by the Western Powers. Yet. the complete
backdown to Gottwald is a different question en
tirely.
Dr. Bohus Benes indicated that Eduard was sur
prised at the purges and repressions of liberty which
followed the establishment of the "Peoples' Repub
lic." In the days before Stalin indulged in the myth
of "respectable Communism," Gottwald had told
the nation, "I am here to break heads." When he
came into power, and did break heads, it thus
shouldn't have surprised anybody, especially with
the terroristic pattern established for him all over
Eastern Europe, that he did just what he iiaid he
was going to.
Secondly, it is very interesting to look at just
what historical significance Benes' surrender with
out a light will have. If the more-than-distinct
probability of war between East and West becomes
actuality, Czechoslovakia will be dragooned into
the conflict on the Eastern side.
If that side wins, Czechoslovak soldiers will have
fought to preserve the slavery of their nation. If
the East loses, which all civilized humanity must
certainly hope will happen, then Germany, the arch
enemy of Czechoslovakia, will come out of the con
flict an ally of the winners, while Czechoslovakia
herself will be a defeated enemy.
Of course other enemies of that state—Hungary
and Poland, for instance—will also be on the de
feated side. Yet they can say to the winners, al
though they aren't humanitarian or particularly
democratic, that they hate Communism as much
as the Czechs, and that they at least proved to the
world they know how to fight.
To many young idealists in this university, such
an argument would be meaningless. To hard-headed
statesmen, thinking in terms of a Central Europe re
drawn to aid in the repression both of German na
tionalism and any Russian renaissance, it will be
more than significant.
The result would almost be that such states would
be allowed to write their own territorial tickets,
while Czechoslovakia would not. Also, any encroach
ment into the natural European arsenal of Czecho
slovakia might well be winked at.
I did not write this letter earlier because I thought
that most studi nts realized Boluis Benes said what
he did. and accepted what he said about "tolerance"
accordingly. However, an unsophisticated minority
have not thought "tolerance" in international af
fairs is just what the world needs, that Benes said
something really deep-seated and profound, and
that the only way for both internal and external
peace is the "middle road." "tolerance" of our
Communistic enemies, etc., etc., ad nauseum.
How many of them are the imbecile annex to the
Wallaceite scum, I do not know. But in case of addi
tions the history of Czechoslovakia in the past few
years, and ol Eduard Benes' relations with the Com
munists, proves what had already been proved to
our diplomats and negotiators in Europe. Namely,
we are not only dealing with an ideology, but a col
lection of animal-like, ruthless, doublecrossinc rep
robates.
Any concession given them tiiey have used as a
tactical weapon in their fight. Any nation that tol
eiates them to such an extent, their intrigues and
activities go completely uncurbed, finds they use
this to undermine such state, and eventually to over
throw it if they can. Any idea of "tolerance" of Sov
iet Russia, oi' its foreign agents when they get into
key positions, is completely stupid.
One could see from the facts which Benes pre
sented. that the Communists fight in an ideological
gutter with the weapons of a moral gutter. "Tol
erance" through "humanitarian democracy" sent
Czechoslovakia along a road that could have been
honorably alleviated by the slightest resistance to
Gottwald's coup, which would have forced the
Red Army to invade and make C. xhoslovakia a
conquered nation rather than, seemingly, semi
willing tool.
America does not intend to go along this road Mav
one corespondent to this paper suggest a wav to
stay oft ot it is. in international and domestic affairs
to go down into this gutter and fight it out with
Communism on its own terms, instead of talking high
t.own ideals while our asassins gather in the shadows.

To the Editor:
This is perhaps overdue comment on the speech
of Bohus Benes at the Tuesday Evening Series, and
his comments on his great relative, Eduard.
One must understand that when Dr. Benes spoke,
other factors besides what he actually felt influenced
anything he said. As he pointed out, Dr. Eduard
Benes is now virtually a hostage of Communism.
Further, Communism does rule his country, and if
he had plunged himself into a long tirade against
Stalin, Gottwald. and company, nothing could be
