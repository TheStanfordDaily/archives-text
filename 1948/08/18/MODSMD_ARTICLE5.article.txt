# Refugee Relief Appeal Made By Bernadotte
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 17 (UP).—
Count Folke Bernadotte, United
Nations peacemaker in Palestine,
today made an "urgent" appeal for
American aid to fight starvation
and disease among 330,000 Arabs
and 7.000 Jews who have fled their
homes because of the Holy Land
war.
He laid the story of a "great hu
man disaster" before Secretary of
State George C. Marshall, who
promised to give it immediate at
tention.
BERNADOTTE SAID in a mes
sage from his headquarters at
Rhodes that "successful mediation"
of the Palestine strife hinges di
rectly on solution of the refugee
problem.
The problem was created largely
by the mass flight of Arab families
from areas brought under Jewish
control in the partition of the Holy
Land and the now-suspended war
fare that followed.
Most of the fleeing Arabs have
sought refuge- in neighboring Arab
states which reportedly are ill-pre
pared to care for them.
JEWISH REFUGEES, in much
smaller numbers, have made the
flight in the opposite diriection and
are also in dire straits, Bernadotte
said.
"Their condition is desperate."
the UN mediator said of both
groups.
He asked the United States for
immediate shipments of food and
DDT disinfectant.
"The essentia! factor is time," he
said. "The refugees are being swept
by epidemic diseases, winter is ap
proaching, and many must die."
