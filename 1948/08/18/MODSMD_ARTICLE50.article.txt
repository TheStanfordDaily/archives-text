Coal Black! Many limes in the past I have used
this phrase without much thought of its real sig
nificance. But I will never use it again indiscrimi
nately. I have seen what these words really describe.
I" ortunately there are comparatively lew occasions
when they carry their full connotations.
One ol the sudden rains that have been preva
lent in Southern Holland this summer had soaked
me before I had arrived at the Oranje-Nassau
mine. When I arrived and was given miner's
clothes. I was glad to change out of my wet
clothes. I dressed in the thick grey cloth trousers
and shirt, pulled on the heavy hob-nailed shoes,
and put on the fiber safety helmet. At the top
of the shaft my last piece of equipment, an eight
pound battery and light, was strapped 011.
My guide, a company engineer, and I descended
in the cage 740 feet. We stepped out of the elevator
into a well-lit underground tunnel. Tracks criss
crossed everywhere. In front of the shaft was a long
line of coal cars patiently waiting their trip to the
surface.
We hoarded the electric train going to the vicin
ity of the coal face. For two and one-half miles we
rode in the springless carriages, my teeth rattling
in rhythm with the clicking of the wheels over
the track. The workers sarcastically call it the
"pullman train."
As we rode through the long passage, I wondered
vaguely, disinterestedly, whether it was still raining
on the surface. Down here the climate and time of
day are of no consequence. The conditions are always
constant. The same yellow light on the metal piop:>
which hold back the stone mountain. The same
hot temperature and humid atmosphere.
Then we went up another shaft, wandered
through smaller and smaller tunnels beside the
coal-laden conveyor belts, and finally arrived at
the face. The vein being mined was a very thick
one for Europe's coal fields; yet it was only three
and a half feet high. Some oi (he veins mined are
as little as two feet high. The walls were the black
coal; the roof and floor were a dark grey rock
propped apart every three feet by metal girders.
The electric lights attempted to brighten the dark
ness, hut the coal dust that filled the narrow en
closure like a black fog smothered most of the light.
I lifted a heavy pneumatic drill into place and
started it.
As it vibrated I drove it down into the black rock.
The vibrations shook my body, and it seemed as if I
were a part of the vibrating instrument, forcing my
self down into the ancient deposit. With a sudden
wrench I tore the coal from its rest. It tumbled down,
and the dust swirled up into my nostrils and throat
and open pores.
Up and down the vein were similar bent bodies
working in the gloom. 1 wondered what they
thought of as they mined. Each worker had to
mine about 370 cubic feet of coal a shift, or they
were "requested" to stay and finish their work. 1
wondered if they were thinking of their pleasant
homes the mine rented to them for seven dollars
a month, if they were thinking of how Ihey were
going to spend their wages of 24 dollars, or if
they were thinking of the small plot of land the
company encourages them to own and farm.
When we reached (he open air the sun was out.
The surface of the coal, sparkling in the beams ol
light, looked a little like its chemical relative, the
diamond. But only the upper surface of the dark
rock resembled a precious stone. The under side
was coal black.

pound battery and light, was strapped 011.
My guide, a company engineer, and I descended
in the cage 740 feet. We stepped out of the elevator
into a well-lit underground tunnel. Tracks criss
crossed everywhere. In front of the shaft was a long
line of coal cars patiently waiting their trip to the
surface.
We hoarded the electric train going to the vicin
ity of the coal face. For two and one-half miles we
rode in the springless carriages, my teeth rattling
in rhythm with the clicking of the wheels over
the track. The workers sarcastically call it the
"pullman train."
As we rode through the long passage, I wondered
vaguely, disinterestedly, whether it was still raining
on the surface. Down here the climate and time of
day are of no consequence. The conditions are always
constant. The same yellow light on the metal piop:>
which hold back the stone mountain. The same
hot temperature and humid atmosphere.
Then we went up another shaft, wandered
through smaller and smaller tunnels beside the
coal-laden conveyor belts, and finally arrived at
the face. The vein being mined was a very thick
one for Europe's coal fields; yet it was only three
and a half feet high. Some oi (he veins mined are
as little as two feet high. The walls were the black
coal; the roof and floor were a dark grey rock
propped apart every three feet by metal girders.
The electric lights attempted to brighten the dark
ness, hut the coal dust that filled the narrow en
closure like a black fog smothered most of the light.
I lifted a heavy pneumatic drill into place and
started it.
As it vibrated I drove it down into the black rock.
The vibrations shook my body, and it seemed as if I
were a part of the vibrating instrument, forcing my
self down into the ancient deposit. With a sudden
wrench I tore the coal from its rest. It tumbled down,
and the dust swirled up into my nostrils and throat
and open pores.
Up and down the vein were similar bent bodies
working in the gloom. 1 wondered what they
thought of as they mined. Each worker had to
mine about 370 cubic feet of coal a shift, or they
were "requested" to stay and finish their work. 1
wondered if they were thinking of their pleasant
homes the mine rented to them for seven dollars
a month, if they were thinking of how Ihey were
going to spend their wages of 24 dollars, or if
they were thinking of the small plot of land the
company encourages them to own and farm.
When we reached (he open air the sun was out.
The surface of the coal, sparkling in the beams ol
light, looked a little like its chemical relative, the
diamond. But only the upper surface of the dark
rock resembled a precious stone. The under side
was coal black.
Coal Black! Many limes in the past I have used
this phrase without much thought of its real sig
nificance. But I will never use it again indiscrimi
nately. I have seen what these words really describe.
I" ortunately there are comparatively lew occasions
when they carry their full connotations.
One ol the sudden rains that have been preva
lent in Southern Holland this summer had soaked
me before I had arrived at the Oranje-Nassau
mine. When I arrived and was given miner's
clothes. I was glad to change out of my wet
clothes. I dressed in the thick grey cloth trousers
and shirt, pulled on the heavy hob-nailed shoes,
and put on the fiber safety helmet. At the top
of the shaft my last piece of equipment, an eight
pound battery and light, was strapped 011.
