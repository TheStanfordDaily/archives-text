# ART LEVINSON
## Bull Session 
### 
As they say at the racetrack, this is Getaway Day.
The last race with the linotype machine has been
run, and the clubhouse officials from editor to proof
reader have forsaken The Daily Shack.
Summer Quarter, which began so flippantly with
trips to San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Searsville,
rushes to a finish with the sickening crescendo of
final examinations.
All of a sudden we realize that more time should
have been spent with literature instead of with
Lucky Lager . . . that poly sci was more important
than party time . . . that we should have learned
more carefully tUe difference between Groutiho
Marx and Karl Marx.
Dead Week becomes a living testimony of our
early quarter sins: forgotten term papers receive all
night attention; and textbook assignments take prece
dence over Dick Tracy and Herb Caen.
Its really too bad that summer quarter has to
end in such a sad way, for this session has been a
happy association of guys and gals ... of school
teachers brushing up their memories so they can
keep two steps ahead of their pupils ... of lazv
undergrade wishing to avoid the p;iins of working
... of eager students wishing to speed up their
graduation . . . and of frosh trying to prove that they
should be readmitted winter quarter.
Although summer has lacked big-name dance
bands, football games, and Gaieties, it has possessed
the informalities of a closely-knit group working and
playing together.
This is what Stanford should always he, and for
those ot u.s who suddenly find that nothing is left
of college besides memories and a diploma, summer
quarter is a fitting climax to twelve quarters on
the Farm.
We re taught in the classrooms to be cruel, cold, and
sentimental, and because your Bull Sessioner is get
ting lopsidedly sentimental, it's time to say, "Hasu-.
Juego."
