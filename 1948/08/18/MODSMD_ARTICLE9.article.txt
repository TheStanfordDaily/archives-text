### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 < UP)â€”Rep. J. Parnell Thomas ac
cused President Truman today of hiding evidence of Soviet
espionage, and said a hitherto unexposed conspiracy has been
discovered which betrayed "some of our most vital information"
to Russia. The New Jersey Republican promised that the full

'story of the new Red network will
be told when his House Committee
on Un-American Activities resumes
public hearings Sept. 7.
THE NEW RING, he said, is an en
tirely different affair from the two
spy groups which ex-Communists
Elizabeth T. Bentley and Whittaker
Chambers previously had sworn
were operating inside the U. S. gov
ernment before and during the war.
He refused to give any further de
tails, except to say that the work oi
the third organization will be
brought into "full locus" when tin
hearings reopen.
THOMAS ACCUSED Mr. Truman
of trying to suppress information oi
this alleged ring as well as on th*.
entire picture of Soviet espionage.
"It is unfortunate that it remains
for congressional committees to ur
earth this kind of thing," he saici
"The facts should have been befort
the public many months ago, and tin
conspirators behind the bars."
Thomas told reporters that the
"complete story" is "locked in the
files" of the administration and
President Truman can explain why
he "has seen fit to conceal this in
formation from the public."
A SIMILAR CHARGE was fired
at the administration by Chairman
Homer Ferguson, R., Mich., of the
Senate Super-investitgating Com
mittee which also has been inquiring
into espionage.
Ferguson wrote Attorney General
Tom C. Clark, asking his to recon
sider his refusal to surrender loyalty
files on a number of government em
ployees accused of aiding Soviet
spies. Clark, on instructions from
the President, had refused the files
on the grounds that their disclosure
"would not be in the national in
terest."
