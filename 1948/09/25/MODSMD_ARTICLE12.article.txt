# Ad Staff Gets New Quarters
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
In case you've been frightened by
a falling two-by-four during a re
cent inadvertent adventure into
what used to be the Administration
Building, you'd better pay heed to
what follows below, or even better
clip this little item and carry it
about with you.
It seems that things have moved,
or should it read ' been moved"?
The Ad Bldg. is kaput, and what
used to reside therein is now scat
tered hither and yon about the
campus. If you're still interested,
here's how the scattei'ing went:
The Dean of Students office has
been shifted to the temporary (?)
buildings behind the library, and
is concentrated in igloo number B.
The Registrar's office has been
moved into huts numbered A and
B with the bulk of the staff hud
dling in A while Dr. H. Donald
Winbigler (he's the Registrar) can
be reached at the B address.
