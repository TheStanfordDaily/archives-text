# Men's, Women's Deans Say Hello
## 
### 
To all new entering students:
The stall of the Office of the
Dean of Students joins me in wel
coming you to Stanford. I should
like to take this opportunity also
to congratulate you. The competi
tion for admission has been unusu
ally keen this year, and you have
successfully met very high stand
ards.
The Dean of Students Office has
been moved from the old Adminis
tration Buildinig to the pre-fabs
behind the Education Building.
The change will doubtless be as
confusing initially to you as it was
and still is to us. You may expe
rience some delays in getting the
information, papers, or advice that
you need. If you do, bear with us.
We'll be straightened around some
day.
The best of luck to you at Stan
ford.
L. A. KIMPTON,
Dean of Students

To all new entering students:
It is with the greatest of pleasure
that I welcome each of you to the
Stanford Family. You have many
fine experiences awaiting you both
in the academic field and in student
activities. May they bring great
satisfaction to you. Again may I
say "Welcome to Stanford."
