To all new entering students:
Welcome to the Farm! You are
now one of us, an integral part of
the Stanford Family — a family
which ranks second to none in
spirit and prestige. In order to
help you get established, the Pre-
Registration Committee has out
lined an outstanding "get-acquaint
ed program." Take full advantage
of it: it's for you. It will be a great
opportunity to meet new friends
and get into full swing for a year

that will be a memorable one for
you—your frosh year.
Feel free to drop in on your
sponsors and student officials at any
time to have your questions an
swered. Don't be afraid to make
yourself at home, for now Stanford
is your home.
One again in behalf of the Asso
ciated Students, welcome and good
luck.
GUS CHAVALAS,
President, Associated Students
