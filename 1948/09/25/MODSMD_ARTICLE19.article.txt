# Chappie to Clutter P.O. with More Pulp
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Jerry Pructt, j
business manager of Chaparral,
campus humor magazine, brought
in the following publicity blurb
on the sale of subscriptions. Or
dinarily such material is rewrit
ten as a "straight" news story. In
this case, however, we decided to
run it as is rather than kill the
personality of the item.)
"If Grandpa can laugh without j
spitting his fause teeth across the j
parlor, send him a subscription to
the Chappie, Stanford's own super- j
duper humor magazine. Grandma !
and the kiddies might like one, too.
The price is only two lousy bucks.
We can only take off-campus sub
scriptions; otherwise, the Stanford
P.O. would blow its top. Subscrip- i
tions will be sold in front of the
Basketball Pavilion during regis
tration. We'll have two sexy women
over there to amuse you while they
extract the green stuff."
