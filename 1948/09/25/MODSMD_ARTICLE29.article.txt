# Physicists to Build Billion-Volt Cyclotron
## 
### 
Stanford physicists will build
what is expected to be the world's
.most powerful atom - smasher, an
electron linear accelerator capable
of hurling particles with a billion
electron volts of energy. This de
velopment work, financed by the
Office of Naval Research, will ex-
Vend over a three-year period.
Construction has begun on a
building to house the projected IGO
- accelerator, which Dr. William
W. Hansen, director of the Stanford
Microwave Laboratory, predicts will
deve'op at least three times as much
energy as the massive cyclotron at
the University of California, which
has a 400,000,000 electron volt out
put.
