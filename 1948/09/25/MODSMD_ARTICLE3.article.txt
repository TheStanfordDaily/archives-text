# 'Best Team in 25 Years' Hits Stanford Red Today
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Just how good the 1948 Stanford
football team is will be known, in
part at least, this afternoon after
the Indians meet a strong Univer
sity of Oregon team. Kickoff time
is 2:30 in Stanford Stadium.
Victors over San Jose State by a
23 to 20 margin in a wild contest
last week, the Farm squad finds it

self a five - touchdown underdog
going into a game with an outfit
that has been described as "the
best team from the Northwest in 25
years."
Marchie Schwartz, the popular
head coach of the Stanfords, has
said that he might have the mak
ings of a great team, ''but we will
have to play a couple of games
before 1 11 know."
Perhaps the reason for the
"might" is that the starting lineup
announced by Schwartz contains
but five Icttermen — six if Dave
Field is a starter—from last year's
team. Thus a majority of the men
of the starting team will be stran
gers of one sort or another to most
Card fans.
Captains Named
Game co-captains Jack McKit
trick and Don Fix were regulars
last year. Gordon White, a frosh
last year, and A 1 Rau, injured in
the first gae last year, have been
named as starting tackles. Jack
Barnes will start in the place of the
injured John Rosekranz at center.
Two ends, A 1 Laakso and Ken
Rose, have been promoted to first
string jobs off their showings in
the San Jose State merry - go
round. Neither played varsity ball
last year. Laakso was with the jay
vees and Rose is a transfer from
Modesto JC.
In the backfield Schwartz has
chosen Don Campbell at quarter
back, either sophomore Boyd Ben
son or Dave Field at left half, Em
ery Mitchell at fullback, and Bob
White, a transfer from Glendale
JC, at right half.
Sonic Depth This Week
Back of these men Schwartz will
have a team made up mostly of
veterans. Bob Ghilotli and Dan
Mervin will see action from end
spots. Atherton Phleger and Whit
Budge at tackles and Bob Rohrer
at guard are lettermen.
Perhaps the toughest choices
made by the head man are those
concerning the backfield men. Rupe
Andrews, flashy scatback from
Menlo JC, will see a lot of play
as will Bud Klein, a product of
COP. Tom Shaw will relieve at
quarterback. Added to this roster
ar veterans Marty Anderson, Mick
ey Titus, A 1 Turriziani, and others.
Bob Anderson, 1947 regular, has
a knee injury and will not piay.

been with the football team sinre
beginning of fall practice in order
to furnish The Dailv with accu
rate information about the Big
Red Machine. An article on the
Oregon team appears on page 9.)
