## Welcome '52 
### 
Welcome, Class of '52. You are starting life in a great Uni
versity, an institution rich in tradition, a University which will be
rich in experience for you.
Most of you know that already. Some of you have been hear
ing about Stanford from your parents or other old grads for a
long time. We older students know about it from three years
spent here.
And in your years here you'll learn as we did that Stanford
is more than a University. It is a way of life.
Part of the Stanford way of life is the friendly, family-like
living in this separate community, this 8,800-acre campus known
as the "Faim." Part of it is the fulfillment of the founders' dream
that the University should be dedicated to non-denominational,
scrupulously free and democratic learning. It is this tradition
that makes the Honor Code work and the Associated Students
successful self-governors. It is this tradition that makes Stanford's
genuinely friendly relations among students, faculty and admin
istration an example of democracy in action.
The writer, like nearly everyone else, finds it impossible to
tell you in so many words just what Stanford means. But you'll
find out through the years. You'll have fun here. You'll get a
good education, too. But, above all, you'll gain an experience in
living that can only be described as "Stanford."
