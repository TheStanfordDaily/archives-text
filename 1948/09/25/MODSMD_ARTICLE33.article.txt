# JACK LITTLE
## Bull Session 
### 
Well, kiddies . . . here you are at the big University. Real honest-to
goodness college boys and girls at iast. And it gives us quite a thrill ot
pride to see your smiling, chcrubic little faces . . . all wreathed in smiles
. . . as the wonders of the Farm are unveiled before your very eyes
(somewhat bloodshot and swollen after taking leave of Mom and Pop).
Yes. you're members of the Stanford Family now and probably a bit
overwhelmed by the extent of our "welcoming program." But just go
ahead and enjoy it . . . don't say, "You shouldn't have gone to all that
trouble." We know.
And we understand when you kinda get a lump in your throat and
choke up with gratitude after reading the introduction to your Frosh
Eible . . .
"Hello, Frosh. So you've decided to come to Stanford."
Yeah, it gets you . . . just one big happy family, and you're a part of
it. You're picked students, too, so says the FB. I dunno about the
picking, but there's a lot of shoveling goin' on.
Just clutch that FB in your hot little fist and don't stop till you've read
it from cover to cover. Nearly as fascinating as the Kinsey Report, isn't it?
It tells you what every Stanford student should know. Of course, so does
Kinsey.
You'll learn all about Stanford traditions, like the "hello" on Quad
and the "hell no" in the Cactus Gardens. You see. according to the FB.
traditions arc things that are felt, inwardly; just reading about 'em isn't
enough. The FB is also helpful on how you Stanford girls can become
Stanford women. Helpful, that is . . . like the first rung in a ladder.
Those of you who aspire to become grade-A roughs will learn all about
Stanford women, who just learn, and you'll try to make the same mistakes
the rest of us tried to make.
Don't forget, by the way, that Stanford property is a state game refuge.
Why. I don't know . . . not a helluva lot of wild life around any more.
But don't believe everything you hear about Stanford women . . . you
•won't hear everything about Stanford women. They say that 99 out of
100 women are beautiful, and the other one comes to Stanford. That's
ridiculous. Not more than (JO out of 100 women are beautiful.
You'll get used to it after 'while, and find other interests to occupy your
busy little minds. Like basketweaving, bookbinding, writing for the Chap
pie, or some equally exciting pastime. Of course, some of you will become
frustrated and end up going plus or writing a column . . . seldom both.
Some of you will study obscure subjects like chimney sweeping, tennis
court surfacing, back patting, or flea-circus management, and become
millionaires. Others will major in journalism, live a happy life for a few
months, and then starve to death.
Well, the Frosh Bible has tried to introduce you to everything about
Stanford except (sit down, kid . . . it'll be over in a minute) sex. It's a
little late in the page to go into that today, but stick around. We'll get
to IT one of these days.

(somewhat bloodshot and swollen after taking leave of Mom and Pop).
Yes. you're members of the Stanford Family now and probably a bit
overwhelmed by the extent of our "welcoming program." But just go
ahead and enjoy it . . . don't say, "You shouldn't have gone to all that
trouble." We know.
And we understand when you kinda get a lump in your throat and
choke up with gratitude after reading the introduction to your Frosh
Eible . . .
"Hello, Frosh. So you've decided to come to Stanford."
Yeah, it gets you . . . just one big happy family, and you're a part of
it. You're picked students, too, so says the FB. I dunno about the
picking, but there's a lot of shoveling goin' on.
Just clutch that FB in your hot little fist and don't stop till you've read
it from cover to cover. Nearly as fascinating as the Kinsey Report, isn't it?
It tells you what every Stanford student should know. Of course, so does
Kinsey.
You'll learn all about Stanford traditions, like the "hello" on Quad
and the "hell no" in the Cactus Gardens. You see. according to the FB.
traditions arc things that are felt, inwardly; just reading about 'em isn't
enough. The FB is also helpful on how you Stanford girls can become
Stanford women. Helpful, that is . . . like the first rung in a ladder.
Those of you who aspire to become grade-A roughs will learn all about
Stanford women, who just learn, and you'll try to make the same mistakes
the rest of us tried to make.
Don't forget, by the way, that Stanford property is a state game refuge.
Why. I don't know . . . not a helluva lot of wild life around any more.
But don't believe everything you hear about Stanford women . . . you
•won't hear everything about Stanford women. They say that 99 out of
100 women are beautiful, and the other one comes to Stanford. That's
ridiculous. Not more than (JO out of 100 women are beautiful.
You'll get used to it after 'while, and find other interests to occupy your
busy little minds. Like basketweaving, bookbinding, writing for the Chap
pie, or some equally exciting pastime. Of course, some of you will become
frustrated and end up going plus or writing a column . . . seldom both.
Some of you will study obscure subjects like chimney sweeping, tennis
court surfacing, back patting, or flea-circus management, and become
millionaires. Others will major in journalism, live a happy life for a few
months, and then starve to death.
Well, the Frosh Bible has tried to introduce you to everything about
Stanford except (sit down, kid . . . it'll be over in a minute) sex. It's a
little late in the page to go into that today, but stick around. We'll get
to IT one of these days.
Well, kiddies . . . here you are at the big University. Real honest-to
goodness college boys and girls at iast. And it gives us quite a thrill ot
pride to see your smiling, chcrubic little faces . . . all wreathed in smiles
. . . as the wonders of the Farm are unveiled before your very eyes
(somewhat bloodshot and swollen after taking leave of Mom and Pop).
