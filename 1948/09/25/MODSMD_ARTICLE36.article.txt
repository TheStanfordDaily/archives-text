# A 						DEAD GI'S GIFT TO AN ENEMY VETERAN
## Japanese Pilot, Stanford Girl's Husband, Learns American Ideals at U.S. University 
### 
In Japan a Stanford graduate
waits for her husband who has
journeyed to the United States to
learn the American way of lifeâ€”
a chance given him by a dead Gl's
bequest of his $10,000 insurance.
She is Helen Matsuoka Nishi
yama (Stanford '40). Her husband
is Robert Nishiyama, who had been
trained as a Kamikaze (suicide)
pilot for Japan in World War 11.
and who is now studying at Penn
sylvania's Lafayette College.
Nishiyama fitted the stipulation
made in the will of Robert John
stone, Dowlington, Pa., soldier who
died in the Philippine campaign,
that one of the Japanese enemy
should receive an education in
American ways.
"I wish I had known him," Nishi
yama said of his benefactor. "If his
body has been returned to America
I must haten to his grave. He had
so much greater vision than we
Japanese in the hysterical days of
the war."
The Japanese pilot who had
pledged his life to his country in a

suicide dive on an American war
hip said when he completes his ed
ucation he plans to return to Japan
as a teacher, even though the pay
is small.
"I want to share my opportunity
with others," he said. ''I belieive
that is what Johnstone would have
wanted."
Robert had been assistant man
ager of an American Air Force bil
let in Tokyo. He said the 250 Japa
nese working there realize the op
portunity he is getting, and that
Johnstone has made them grateful
and aware of his American ideals.
His wife, Helen, was born in this
country, and her parents lived in
Berkeley. Both her father and
mother, however, were born in
Japan. Helen lived at Lagunita
Court at Stanford, and later at the
Oaks. She was popular with her
schoolmates, it was recalled by
Stanford people who knew her.
She obtained her degree in basic
medical sciences. There is no rec
ord of the date of her marriage in
University records, but her home is
listed as Kobe, Japan.
