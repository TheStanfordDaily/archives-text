## Van Brocklin Leads Ducks 
### 
Oregon player after Santa Bar
bara game: "I wish we could get
a couple of tough games under our
belt before we meet Michigan."
(Oregon plays Michigan next
week.)
Stanford coaching staff: "Wish
we could have a couple of easier
games before we meet Oregon."
That about sums the feelings of
the two teams. Oregon, with the
scent of roses already strong, con
siders Stanford but a step toward
greater heights.
A student of the game might say
that Jim Aiken's Oregon Ducks
have every right to feel that way
about the Stanford squad they
downed 21 to 6 in 1947.
What Price Koses?
Mr. Aiken has the same tools to
work with this year as he did last
season. Add to this the fact that
the Mr. Quarterback of the PCC,
Norm Van Brocklin, is the key man
in a very strong backfield.
But that backfield does not stop
with the smooth - passing Van
Brocklin. No indeed. Backs the
like of George Bell and Bob San
ders, two men who ran so well in
last year's Stanford-Oregon fray,
will also be on hand. Transfers ga
lore came running to fill the shoes
of graduating Jake Leicht. Johnny
McKay from Purdue seems to have
.irst call, but Woodley Lewis, a
•olored flash from Los Angeles JC,
j reported to be very good.
Best Line in PCC?
It is in the line that Oregon sur
asses most Pacific Coast teams. To
man the 1947 regular frontwall is
jck. Anchored on the ends by
-uch as Dan Garza, second-stringer
n most All-Coast teams last year,
nd Bob Anderson, the line has
ood depth. Dick Wilkins, a four
■ear letterman in basketball, is re
futed to be the best pass-catching
nd of the lot.
At tackles there are Steve Dotur
nd Don Stanton. Ironman Stanton
olayed 523 minutes out of a possible
300 last year. The guard chores fall
o Ed Chrobot, Ted Meland and
im Berwick, veterans all. At cen
er is the All-Coast veteran' Brad
Icklund who is back for his last
j ason of play for the Ducks.

siders Stanford but a step toward
greater heights.
A student of the game might say
that Jim Aiken's Oregon Ducks
have every right to feel that way
about the Stanford squad they
downed 21 to 6 in 1947.
What Price Koses?
Mr. Aiken has the same tools to
work with this year as he did last
season. Add to this the fact that
the Mr. Quarterback of the PCC,
Norm Van Brocklin, is the key man
in a very strong backfield.
But that backfield does not stop
with the smooth - passing Van
Brocklin. No indeed. Backs the
like of George Bell and Bob San
ders, two men who ran so well in
last year's Stanford-Oregon fray,
will also be on hand. Transfers ga
lore came running to fill the shoes
of graduating Jake Leicht. Johnny
McKay from Purdue seems to have
.irst call, but Woodley Lewis, a
•olored flash from Los Angeles JC,
j reported to be very good.
Best Line in PCC?
It is in the line that Oregon sur
asses most Pacific Coast teams. To
man the 1947 regular frontwall is
jck. Anchored on the ends by
-uch as Dan Garza, second-stringer
n most All-Coast teams last year,
nd Bob Anderson, the line has
ood depth. Dick Wilkins, a four
■ear letterman in basketball, is re
futed to be the best pass-catching
nd of the lot.
At tackles there are Steve Dotur
nd Don Stanton. Ironman Stanton
olayed 523 minutes out of a possible
300 last year. The guard chores fall
o Ed Chrobot, Ted Meland and
im Berwick, veterans all. At cen
er is the All-Coast veteran' Brad
Icklund who is back for his last
j ason of play for the Ducks.
