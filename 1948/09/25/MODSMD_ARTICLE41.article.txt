## 
### 
The 1948 football rules involve
few changes, none of which are
very radical.
The principal change makes a tee
legal for all place kicks. This tee
can be a block not higher than one
inch; its other dimensions are not
specifie.
After a team has used its four
legal time-out periods and an addi
tional time-out is required, as for
the removal of an injured player,
time shall resume as soon as the
ball is ready for play. In other
words, a full time-out will not -be
granted; as soon as the injured
player has been replaced, play must
be resumed immediately.
When an additional time-out is
granted, the requesting team will
be allowed to replace no one other
than the injured player.
If the ball is kicked off out of
bounds for a second time, the re
ceiving team shall put the ball in
play by a scrimmage at the inter
section of its restraining line and
the nearer inbounds line. However,
if the ball is touched by a player
of the receiving team before it goes
out of bounds, then the ball is put
in play at the intersection of the
nearer inbounds line and the point
where the ball went out of bounds.
