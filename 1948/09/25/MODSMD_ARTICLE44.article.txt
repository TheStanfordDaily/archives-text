# Ways to Defer Tuition Told
## 
### 
Four different ways in which i
students who are unable to pay
cash can handle their tuition pay
ments were pointed out yesterday
by Controller Duncan I. McFadden.
The four procedures, which al
low for deferments ranging from It)
da.vs to the entire quarter, pre as |
follows:
1. Upon payment of a portion of
the tuition, the balance may be de- |
ferred for 10 days. The minimum t
amounts required to be paid upon
registration day are as follows: tui
tion under $100, $35; tuition of $100
or over, $5. The controller's cash- !
iers will handle this type of defer
ment application.
2. Tuition may be deferred more ;
than 10 days—but not beyond the |
end of the quarter—upon the pay- j
ment of approximately one-third of
the total amount. Application in
this case must be made to the chief
counselor for men or the chief
counselor for women.
3. Similar application to the
chief counselors is to be made by
students who find it impossible to
make any payment at al! at the
time of registration.
4. Students who are eligible for |
student loans may apply for such |
loans — again to cither the chief j
counselor for men or for women —
to cover that portion of the tuition ■
which the student cannot pay dur- I
ing the current quarter.
