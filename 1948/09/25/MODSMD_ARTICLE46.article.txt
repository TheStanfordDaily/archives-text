# Pete Will Be Lateâ€” And He'll Be Missed
## 
### 
Peter Keesmaat, known to gen
erations of Stanford students as
"Pete," will be a little late this
year in assuming his customary
post behind the counter of the
Cellar Store.
The genial, ever-smiling Pete
contracted pneumonia on his va
cation trip to Idaho and is not
exected back until (he middle of
October, Bill Gunther, store man
ager, said. Johnny Koontz, who
h.is been working with Pete for
several years, will be on deck.
And to Pete, who is recuperat
ing in Marin County, the Daily
staff and several thousand men
and women of the Farm send a
big bouquet and best wishes for
a quick recovery.
