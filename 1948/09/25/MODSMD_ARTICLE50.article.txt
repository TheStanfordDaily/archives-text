# Spanish War Vets To Hold Reunion
## 
### 
Stanford alumni veterans of the
Spanish - American War and the
Philippine Insurrection will hold
their 50th anniversary reunion —
the first they ever held—on the
campus today and tomorrow, Jack
W. Shoup, alumni director, said.
Out of a student body of approxi
mately 800 in 1898, 83 responded to
the call to arms. Twenty-eight are
known to be alive now.
Herbert W. Kerrigan, '00, Menlo
Park, reunion chairman, expects 10
to 15 to attend. Kerrigan, a high
jumper, was the first Pacific Coast
athlete to compete in the Olympic-
Game in 1906.
The program for the two - day
celebration will open today at 10:30
a.m. with a roll call of the veterans
at the Memorial Tablet in Memo
rial Court on the campus. From
there the veterans will visit Hoover
Tower, and then attend the foot
ball game.
Dinner will be at Branner Hall,
and Sunday will be devoted to an
auto tour of the old and new at
tractions on and near the camous.
