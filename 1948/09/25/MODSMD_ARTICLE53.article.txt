Stanford will go to the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1949!
There it is. I've been threatening to make that statement since I ar
| l ived on campus the first day of fall football practice. Alter spending some
; three weeks with the football team, this reporter will go on record as say
ing that the Big Red Machine will play in the Rose Bowl—this season.
Football predicting has become a must with every sports writer. No
one ever checks up to see how correct the scribes are, so this seems the
golden opportunity to write one's name in the Hall of Predictors' Fame.
Three months from now. if by chance Stanford does not go to the Rose
J Bowl, this prediction will be forgotten. If Stanford does go, believe me,
ibis column will find space to remind its readers.
Reds Not Given Look-in on Title
Get the picture now. Stanford lost nine games and won none last year.
Oregon and California are co-favorites to cop the crown. Stanford isn't
even given an outside chance to finish in the top five by most forecasters.
Enter: One Opportunist.
But the prediction wasn't born solely from the chance to steal the gffiry
j from my brother predictors. Stanford can win the bid to the Tournament
! of Roses.
In my opinion Marchmont Schwartz has as fine a crew of backs as any
; on the coast. His line will give away weight to almost every team it plays.
! Most of those teams will be made up, to a greater degree, of veterans.
Yet Stanford, on any given afternoon, can beat any team in the Confer
ence.
Worm lias to Turn, We Hope
Why all this confidence? Mr. Schwartz and staff will throw up their
collective arms upon reading such an article as this. And indeed, before
the ink is dry on this page, Oregon may be victor over the Farm crew
by a large margin.
But, and this is the clue to the whole affair, after a year of every kind
of bad luck, from losing players to professional ball, to suffering crippling
injuries to key players—ol' Lady Fate will have to deal some of those
breaks our way.
1 hat's the story. All those little things that go to make up a winning
ball club—a healthy team, opponents' fumbles on the three-yard line,
injuries to key men on the other teams—all that and much more must
come back to the Farm after a year's absence.
It is too bad that Stanford's one-game winning streak has to be put on
the line this afternoon against "bowl-bound" Oregon. The Cards can and
will beat some of the teams they are slated to lose to at this writing, but
it is doubtful that this Oregon team is one of them.
If ever a team from the Northwest was loaded, Jim Aiken's Ducks are
that team. From end to end a line that gave up only two touchdowns on
the ground last season returns for the 1948 Conference wars. O'nly Jake
Leieht is missing from the starting backfield. Stanford coach and scout
Mai Elward reports that in John McKay the Ducks have a back equal
to or better than the departed All-Coaster Leicht.
Oregon Strong Finisher in '47
Last year, after losing three games, this same Oregon team went on to
win its last six games and a tic with California for second place in the
Pacific Coast Conference.
These Oregon lads know that they have an excellent chance to grab
a Rose Bowl bid this season. They are in no mood to let a Stanford team
show them up in any way. Last week, against a weak Santa Barbara squad,
Coach Aiken, with the score 55 to 7, sent in his first string when the
: Gauchos threatened late in the contest.
Ducks in Mid-Season Condition
This Oregon team that we will see this afternoon is nearly in mid-sea
son condition. Thank ol' P.E. 190 for that! It seems that Oregon saw lit
to hold a class on football methods (taught by Mr. Aiken himself) during
the two summer sessions. These classes were attended in large numbers
by the men who will play here today.
Stanlord s Athletic Director A 1 Masters has protested to the Commis
sioner's office that this class violated, in spirit at least, the rule that for
bids football practice until September. 'Tis fuel to fan the Bowl flames.
