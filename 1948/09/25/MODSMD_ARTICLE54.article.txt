# Social Calendar Begins With Twin Reg Dances
## 
### 
New students will get a chance to
attend the first "real" social event
of the quarter Tuesday night at 9
when not one but TWO Reg dances
will host Farm roughs and their
dates in the Basketball Pavilion and
the Women's Gym.
Under the joint sponsorship of
the soccer team and Theta Sigma
Phi, the honorary women's jour
nalism organization, the dances will
be co-chairmanned by Bob Curie
and Paula Nusser.
The Women's Gym dance will
feature music by Al Ferguson and
his "smooooth" dance band. Miss
Nusser promises good music from
9 to midnight.
Kay Hackett and his orchestra
will play for the Pavilion dance.
Hackett, who has been heard by
many Peninsula-ites during his re
cent engagement at the Mark, is
also CBS music director. Bob Cal
lahan, an Irish tenor, is vocalist
with the band.
Tickets for both dances are priced
at an "oh-so-low" $1.80, according
to Curie, and will be on sale Mon
day and Tuesday on Quad. A lew
salesmen will be around today, too.
