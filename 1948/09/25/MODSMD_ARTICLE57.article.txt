### 
Controversy raged yesterday over
the Firehouse program titled "Phys
ical Education 190."
Future volleyball opponents as
serted that the course was pre-sea
son practice in the race for the in
tramural volleyball championship.
They charged that Firehouse ath
letes have jumped the gun. and

pointed out that all the outstand
ing volleyball players on the Fire
house squad are enrolled in the
course.
The Firehouse men denied that
the course was pre-season practice
and said that "PE 190 is a regular
course given all future fire fight
' ers."
