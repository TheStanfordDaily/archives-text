# Indian-Duck Clash Gets Top Billing
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Pacific Coast football teams got
off to their second weekend of col
legiate action today with the Stan
ford - Oregon clash receiving top
billing. All the attention is being
focused on the Farm fray largely
because Oregon is expected to show
up with a Rose-bowl, cream-of
the-conference eleven.
That's the way the experts have
tabbed it. Of course, California
and USC have been rated a chance,
but from Puget Sound to the Los
Angeles River the consensus of
sports opinion has made the Web
feet the team to beat.
Terrific Start
Oregon opened its season last
Saturday by spanking poor little
Santa Barbara, 55 to 7. And that
was without much aid from their
ace, Norm Van Brocklin, who
walked off with all the conference
passing and kicking records last
season. Van only used his arm
twice in the entire game. Few are
counting on him being that con
siderate this afternoon.
Oregon also has a highly rated
line, two good ends in Garza and
Anderson, a blood-thirsty coach in
Jim Aiken, and a fancy cheer
leader. But, the Ducks are not in
the same class with California and
USC. and maybe not with UCLA.
California got oft' to a Mel Pat
ton start against Santa Clara last
Saturday by blasting the Broncos,
41 to 19. USC wasn't quite as bois
terous, but looked good in lazily
skipping over Utah, 27 to 0.
Our hero. Pappy Waldorf, has
put together another sizzling of
fense for his favorite Golden Bear.
Jensen Stars
Berkeley fans are yelling loud
and long that they really have the
goods this season. Jackie Jensen
will be made mayor of Berkeley
any day now. Cal has plenty to
crow about. The Bears have so

much depth in line replacements
that Waldorf has been usinÂ« a diver j
to get over tips to his subs.
Per usual, USC's Trojans will be ,
tough to handle. The Troys have i
found a crushing fullback in 225-
pound Don Burke. And theiir |
tongue-twisting duo of Dean Dill j
and Don Doll will add to a power
ful backfield combo. Their first ac
tual test comes up today, however,
as they play host to Oregon State. {
UCLA looked much more potent J
than it was supposed to last Satur- j
day night by out-blasting an of- I
fensive - minded Washington State
squad, 49 to 26. The Bruins could
develop into a leading power.
The main story about the 1948 j

season will begin to unfold a little j
more clearly by tonight. California I
faces an alert Navy team. UCLA
runs into Big Nine ' difficulties
against Northwestern. USC might
have trouble with Oregon State, j
and Oregon could also have a lot of !
dreams dashed if Stanford started j
to click.
Washington State and Washing- 1
ton might prove to be stubborn j
teams, especially the Huskies who '
have a new coach, a new team, and j
a new spirit.
