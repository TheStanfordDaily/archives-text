BERLIN, Sept. 27 (UP). â€”The Russians have drafted a set of
air rules that would ban all but an occasional flight by a Western
plane into Berlin and insist these rules now govern all flights,
reliable sources said today.
These sources added that the American, British, and French

military governments flatly reject
ed the regulations.
The rules have been filed with
the tour - power air safety center
here and would ban all instrument
flights, day or night. They would
give the Russians the right to turn
back any plane seeking to land at
Templehof Airport, which is in the
U.S. zone and is operated by the
United States Army.
At Wiesbaden, U.S. Air Force
headquarters, Lt. Gen. Curtis Le-
May sidestepped all questions on
preparations to meet a possible use
of force in the air lanes into Berlin.
'"Russian harassing tactics have
n'l bothered us at all," he added.


SOVIET DEPUTY Foreign Min
ister Andrei Vishinsky, who Sat
urday accused the Western pow
ers of trying to isolate Russia by
military alliances, today listened
calmly while Britain's Foreign
Secretary Ernest Rcvin inferred
that Russia, through 11011-co-op
eration, will be responsible for
any world disaster.
