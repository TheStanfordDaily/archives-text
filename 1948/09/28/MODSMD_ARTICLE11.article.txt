### 
WASHINGTON. Sept. 27 (UP) â€”
The House Unamerican Activities
Committee tonight called for treason
indictments against three men and a
woman it accused of trying to steal
wartime atomic secrets for Russia,
including a "Scientist X" at the
University of California.
In a report that blamed the Roose
velt and Truman administrators for
failing to prosecute the alleged spies
and withholding news of their activi
ties from the public, the committee
identified the accused traitors as:
Clarence Francis Hiskev. a chem
istry professor at Polytechnic Insti
tute. Brooklyn. N. Y., who worked
on atomic research at Columbia and
Chicago universities during the war.
Marcia Sand. Hiskev's ex-wife,
who allegedly helped him arrange
contacts with the mysterious Soviet
super-spv known as Arthur Alex
androvich Adams.
John Hitchcock Chapin. a Ver
mont-born chemist who worked with
Hiskev on the Columbia and Chi
cago University atomic projects and
is now employed at a Newark. N. J.,
brewery.
Steve Nelson. Yugoslavian-born
chairman of the Western .Pennsyl
vania Communist Party.
The committee said it also intends
to cite Nelson for contempt of Con
gress because he refused to answer
its Questions about his wartime ac
tivities.
It also demanded that the Justice
Department investigate and either
clear or prosecute for treason an
other atomic scientist who worked
on the A-bomb project at the Uni
versity of California in 1943. The
report identified him only as "Scien
tist X.''
