### Associated Press 
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey carried his
presidential campaign to the Pacific
Northwest vesterdav with a pledge
of government bv "capable men and
women." President Truman, in the
Southwest, accused Republicans of
trvine to "tear up the Bill of
Rights."
Thus the Republican and Demo
cratic candidates carried along the
skirmishes leading up to the decisive
political battle five weeks from to
day—Election Dav. Nov. 2.
President Truman said last night
that the people must turn to the
Democratic Partv for a government
that works in the interests of "all
the people."
Scorns "Unity" Program
With an obvious backhand refer
ence to Dewev's calls for unity for
Americans. Mr. Truman said he
doesn't want any part of "unity «»f
-■*£u.red by a Republican Party that
would'-r<-.L. prices go .sky high."
In anothef Vv to the Ro
putlicans, the said he
could talk about their"" *-«us take s
"irom now to Christmas." He addfrck
"Nothing I can sav about the Re
publicans is as bad as their record."
Dewev. in a major address at
Seattle, replied in effect to Mr. Tru
man's oft-raised c*v that the Re
publicans- especially the 80th Con
gress tried to "sabotage" the West
on power and irrigation needs.
"Just as we needed vast amounts
of hydroelectric power to develop
the atomic bomb." Dewev said, "we
now need more power to develop the
peace."
Estimates Increase
He estimated that America's
power-producing capacity will have
to be increased bv almost 20 per cent
during the next five years. And he
pledged a government made up of
"carable men and women."
"Your next adm i nis t r a t i on."
Dewev's program continued, "will
see to it that Povernment respon
sibility is placed in charge of capable
men and women who will act with
out bureaucratic red tape in the
interest of the greatest good for the
greatest number."
President Truman, in Texas en
route to a major speech on commu
nism at Oklahoma City today, talked
as confidently.
