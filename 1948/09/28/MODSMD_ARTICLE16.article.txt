# Tuition Installment Plan Boosts Student Bankroll
## 
### 
If that bank account registers no
more than four digits and that wal
let feels kind of thin as you look
at the tuition figures this fall, you
may want to follow one of four

ways to defer payment recom
mended by Controller Duncan I.
McFadden.
Payment of a portion of the tui- |
tion enables the student to defer I
paying the balance for 10 days. !
Minimum amounts to be paid upon
registration are $35 for tuition un- :
der $100, and $55 for tuition over |
$100. Controller's cashiers will han
dle this type of deferment applica
tion.
By paying approximately one
third of the tuition upon registra
tion day, the student may defer
paying the balance more than 10 j
days, but not beyond the end of
the quarter. Application for this
type of deferment must be made to
the chief counselor for men or the j
chief counselor for women.
If students find it impossible to j
make any payment at the time of
registration, they must make simi
lar application to the chief coun- |
selors.
Students who are eligible for stu
dent loans may apply for such loans
from the chief counselors. Loans
cover that portion of the tuition
which the student cannot pay dur
ing the current quarter.
