# West Plans Complaint
## 
### 
PARIS. Sept. 27 (UP). â€” The
United States, Great Britain, and
France announced tonight that they
will submit an urgent complaint to
the United Nations at 3:30 p.m. to
morrow (7:30 a.m. CDST) against
Russia's blockade of Berlin.
This means that they can ask im
mediate consideration in the UN
Security Council of a Russian
' threat to peace" instead of waiting
the normal three days.
The complaint is being made
under Chapter VII of the UN Char
ter. This provides for penalties
against an aggressor, even includ
ing the use of armed force. But
tinder the charter each of the five
great world powers has the right
of veto. Thus Russia can prevent
any real action.
Accusing Russia of trickery in
saying that the Western Allies plot
ted war against her, British For
eign Secretary Ernest Bevin point
ed directly to Russian Chief Dele
gate Andrei Y. Vishinsky and said:
"If the black fury, the incalcu
lable disaster, of an atomic war
shall fall upon us. all I can say is
that one power by refusing its co
operation . . . will alone be re
sponsible for the evils which may
be visited upon mankind."
