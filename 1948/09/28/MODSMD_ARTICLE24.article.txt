# Stanford Physicist Developes Improved X-ray Microscope
## 
### 
Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick, Stan
ford physicist, has developed an X
ray microscope which is expected
to provide scientists eventually
with a new tool for the examina
tion of minute objects not readily
penetrated by light or electrons.
Its resolving power, or range,
based on the performance of early
models and theoretical studies, is
expected to be somewhere between
that of the best type of optical mi
croscope and the electron micro
scope.
Developers believe that the new
device, while it does not have the
magnifying power of the electron
microscope, will be much simpler
in construction and will offer the
advantage that living specimens
may be examined. Since objects
examined under a beam of elec
trons have to be in a vacuum, this
dries up and kills living tissue.
The largest magnification which
scientists have achieved with early
models of the X-ray microscope is
about 60 diameters, although they
have made no attempt to get high

magnification in the present stage
of their research.
Year's Research Expended
Dr. Kirkpatrick hopes that fully
developed models of the device will
permit scientists to X-ray objects
less than a millionth of an inch in [
size. This is about 20 times smaller I
than can be seen with an optical
microscope using short wave light.
Development of the first X-ray
microscope model climaxed a year's
research.
An X-ray microscope had long
been considered an impossibility
because X-rays show almost no re
fraction, and because of a peculiar
quality of the rays which makes it
impossible to reflect them off any
thing except at a very low angle.
This can be compared to the way
a stone skips in water. As any boy
knows, a stone dropped into water i
will sink to the bottom. But if it i
is thrown at a low angle, it will
bounce repeatedly off the surface
of the water.
Dr. Kirkpatrick bounces the X
ray off one mirror, set up vertically,

lo another reflector, which is hori
zontal. One mirror brings the X
rays together on a horizontal plane:
the second brings them together on
a vertical plane.
Mirrors Look Flat
The mirrors, about the size of a
10-cent piece, look flat, but are ac
tually concave. They are really a
tiny segment of a theoretical curve
which has a radius of about 30 feet
in the current phase of the re
search, and which may be reduced
even smaller.
It was quite a trick to make these
tiny mirrors, which are comparable
in precision to those of a fine tele
scope lens. Some of them were
ground by Burton Stuart, Stanford
physics department technician; oth
ers were made by Dr. G. D. Hanna,

ol the California Academy of Sci
ences in San Francisco.

Sti: 1 belter optical surfaces will
have to be developed to secure an
ticipated maximum results, lor X
ray reflections are a supreme test
of the quality of optical surfaces.
To date Dr. Kirkpatrick and his
associates have concentrated their
X-i-ay microscope beam on a fine
gauze screen, which has about 200-

300 meshes to the inch. The tiny
squares of this screen come up
clear and sharp in these first ef
forts. They have also taken suc
cessful microscope X-rays of a wire
so fine that it cannot be seen with
the naked eye in ordinary light.


DR. PAUL H. KIRKPATRICK explains the opera
tions of his X-ray microscope, a new scientific tool
the Stanford physicist has developed in the Uni-

versity's X-ray laboratories. The X-ray source, an
ordinary X-ray tube, is behind the lead shield. The
object being X-rayed is just outside the shield.


HERE IS lIOW a fine piece of
j'Jiuzo, with Mime 250 meshes lo
the inch, looks when X-rayed
through the new Stanford X-ray
microscope. The magniification is
about 50 power in this test shot,
taken at a stage in the research
when the physicists are concen
trating on techniques rather than
large magnification.
