# Beer, teach Liven Summer Quarter
## 
### ALVIN B. BERRY 
To most of the Indian tribe the
: period between spring and fall
| quarters is a period of "beach
j down," summer jobs, and "home
| again." But to three thousand some
j odd, that period was Stanford in
[ the summer-time. And a nice time
! at that.
Summer-time is like no other
quarter at Stanford. It is a queer
I conglomeration of bored post-grads
and awkward first-quarter frosh, of
I cocky, acceleration wise-guys and
scared probation-harried engineers.
There are fiery visiting profs, and
freshmen on their first ''beer train."
There are laughs and loves and
, tears, good grades and bad grades,
l ladies and women. It's a "work"
I quarter and yet a gay quarter. It
| is Stanford, summer quarter.
The summer season reached its
| peak early when somebody stole
! an axe. Not just any old axe, but
j the one that the near - by state
sponsored school "won" from Stan-
J ford at the end of a football game
j last November. Since, by a legal
| quiik, the axe was supposed to be
j in the not too tender or reliable
j care of the Associated Students of
1 the University of California, there
I was some little furor when the
r grand old trophy was discovered

snugly resting on 3YIr. Stanford's
Farm.
ASSU Summer President Don
Davies, in true presidential style,
returned the axe to the people at
Berkeley, but just how the trophy
got where it was remains a mys
tery. One sage observer shed same
light on the subject when lie re
marked, "Maybe the old axe could
n't stand the smell up there, and
came back home for a breath of
fresh air."
As usual romance raised its
weary head on the old Farm last
summer—if two and a half thou
sand lonesome males chasing seven
hundred man-hungry women can
be called romance. To aid the do
ings, the naked nymph Encina —
which housed more human beings
than freshmen—threw a handful of
shindigs, including an all-campus
dance and a beach party, which
turned out as de'ightful as a Gre
cian orgy.
The highlight of the social sea
son, according to many observers,
was the wonderful watermelon -
rind fight known as the Melody
Munch. Gorgeous Stanford girls,
with peeling sun-tans and water
melon-soaked hair, took care of
the entertainment, each one divid-
Student E. Farkas was heard to

remark, "This is real!" And, in
deed, it was.
Would-be wooers gazed in stu
pefied admiration as five feet nine
inches of beautiful female with a
loot and a half of wondrous pig
tails made her appearance on the
dusty loads of S-T-A-N-ford. She
was Olympic skier Brynhilde Gros
moen who turned out to be what
good people call "good peop'e."
Brynhilde was not disappointed
with Stanford, and, as that same
sage observer was heard to remark.
Stanford was very much pleased
with Brynhilde.
Another highlight of the sum
mer-time (when the livin' is easy)
was the weird and mysterious case
of O. N. Hamilton. It seems that
Mr. Hamilton suspected that he w;?s
the proud possessor of an ulcer. He
went to the ole Stanford Hospital
to have X-rnys taken of himself
and his alleged companion.
Somewhere along the line, ac
cording to Mr. Hamilton, there was
a faux-pas Mr. Hamilton fell, or
was pushed, or was dropped off of
the X-ray table. He is suing the
University for $10,000. Rumors have
been squelched that the tuition is
being raised another $100 to pay
for Mr. Hamilton's ulcers.
Stolen axes and bathing - suited

! women c*id not completely fill the
| activities roster of the past sum
i mer, however. Intellectual things
also reared their ugly heads on this
| great campus. There were people
j talking — always talking — on the
! Farm. The "We're for Wallace,
right er wrong" faction held regu
lar idealistic meetings, and progress
was made toward the cause.
But there were many good and
worthwhile talks, panels and
speeches, from which those wise
enough to attend received a great
deal of knowledge. The president
of an Alabama Negro college dis
eussd the problems of his race. Dr.
C. Easton Roth well, vice-chairman
of the Hoover Institute, moderated
a panel on U.S.-Soviet relations. A
New York artist gave a lecture on
mural painting, and K. T. Keller.
| president of the Chrysler Corpora
tion, gave hints to the Stanford
Business Conference on how to
make more gold.
This was just the warm - up.
Many more great and iittie people
came and talked and were ap
plauded. And many a Stanford
student realized that there is a
great deal more to be learned on
the Farm than the facts about
stolen axes and bathing - suited
women.


THE MAN ON TOP i> Doodles
Weaver, all-time champion Stan
ford character. His exploits are
legendary and known to nearly

new wrinkle. It savs Doodles'

Could be. Anyway he plays the
mad Professor Feitelbaum on
