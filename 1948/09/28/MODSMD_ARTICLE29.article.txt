# "DAILY EDITORIALS"
## Policy 
### 
When a newspaper changes hands, and at the start of every
Volume of The Daily, it is customary to say a few words about
policy. So here goes.
Foremost, The Daily's policy will be to publish a good news
paper.
You can help us—
By intelligent suggestions.
By participation.
By appreciating the fact that unwarranted plugging 'of a
dance, drive, or activity helps little. People pay no attention to
outlandish blurbs. Readership surveys and attendance figures
have proved that five lines of news can be as effective. So,
please stay off the staff's neck if we don't always print yards and
about your club.
BUT, by all means, send us all real news! Share it with the
rest of the campus.
Now about these editorials, known in the trade as "think
pieces."
They 11 be largely that. The editor believes that editorials
-aould be written with the view to starting people thinking
problems, not necessarily to nag certain practices or ha
angue certain groups.
Daily editorials will not necessarily be "local." The attempt
o confine editorials to the campus in the past has resulted in
nany trumped-up, flat and dishwatery utterances that haven't
always come off.
Moreover, there are not enough real problems on the campus
o pick out one a day to worry about. Furthermore, and more
.mportant, there are a number of national and international
•roubles that Stanford students should be thinking about, talking
about, and perhaps solving. The Daily will try to point some of
them out—for in a very short time we Stanford undergraduates
will inherit this world. And the situation, as it was expressed
by Professor Lutz, is this: "When I graduated from Stanford I
didn't think it was possible for my generation to turn over to the
following one a world in such bad shape. Then we turned around !
and made a worse cfle."
