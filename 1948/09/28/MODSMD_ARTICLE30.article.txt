# 'Dear Mom'
## 
### 
One of the many new features we hope to develop in The
Daily this year appears in the columns to the right. It is called,
Dear Mom, and it is written by Oordon Addison. Gordon is a
sophomore but he writes from the freshman or newcomer's point
ci view. While the column's biggest appeal will be to the fresh
men, we hope that hardened old upper classmen—and grads,
too—will find it a pleasant bit of nostalgia.
We candidly suggest that freshmen might clip the column
and mail it if they're too busy to write home.
