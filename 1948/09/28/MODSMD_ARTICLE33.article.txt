Dear Mom:
I've finally reached the Farm!
It is the same school that I'd heard
Sis talk about all right. When we
hit the Palo Alto depot, there was
the welcoming committee. She was
sure cute; lives in Branner; is a
sophomore majoring in English.
Aside from that I don't know much
about her. There was a fellow
there, too—for the girls I guess.
They loaded us in a cab and the
driver seemed to know our kind,
for he headed straight for Encina.
Thei»e amidst the maze of hustling
i luggage - bearers I spotted what
looked like the registration line. I
I questioned one of the least puzzled -
j looking fellows and was able to
j gain a weak nod from him.
Soon I held .the key for the room
j which is to I'.ouse me for as long as
| I can survi e the competition. The
j room is on the fourth floor and is
in the ea-t wing (an idea! spot for
j waterbagei ig—my roommate says).
We've been spending most of our
j time thus far unpacking and room
| arranging. Up till now instead of
| having conferences with the nu
; merous advisers, I've been holding
meetings with the SP baggage man.
It's been only three nights now that
; I've had to sleep without blankets.
I The sheets are just fine, and the
j mattress hangs in the middle so
I that it almost envelopes me in a
| semi-capacity of a blanket, but I've
I still been freezing in this northern
climate. My roommate let me use
j a bed spread last night, so don't
j worry, Mom.
II) check off another item on
| your question list. Food—well, it's
j Encina food. We gel bu'k but very
I questionable quality. That reminds
me —don't forget to buy Blackie
some of those new doc biscuits the
vet recommended. Oh yes —En-
cina — things are improving. I'm
! sure they'll start using the stoves in
| a few days.
But it isn t the food, the room, or
the train ride which really interests
me. It's (his medicine they call the
"Stanford spirit." I got my first big
taste of it in the Pavilion Friday
night when the band played and
everyone at the rally sang the
Stanford Hymn. There was a cer
tain feeling that kind of hit me
when the yell leader announced the
Hymn. The program had been pre
j dominated by yells, songs, and fun,
but when the fellow said, "And now
; we'll stand for the Hymn," there
i seemed to be a kind of crack in his
voice and I felt a lump in my

throat as we sang "Where the
rolling foothills rise—"

Dear Mom:
I've finally reached the Farm!
It is the same school that I'd heard
Sis talk about all right. When we
hit the Palo Alto depot, there was
the welcoming committee. She was
sure cute; lives in Branner; is a
sophomore majoring in English.
Aside from that I don't know much
about her. There was a fellow
there, too—for the girls I guess.
They loaded us in a cab and the
driver seemed to know our kind,
for he headed straight for Encina.
