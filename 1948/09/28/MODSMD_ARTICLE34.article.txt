## Bull Session 
### 
As they used to say in my high school typing class; now is the time for
all good men to ... . come back and mingle with those ivy-covered
professors and those clean-cut Stanford students. Clean-cut. That's a
society word meaning: "Why not admit it, we all just got clipped for two
hundred bucks!"
11 you can iorget about that tuition, however, it is really a relief to get
back to school, away from the suspicious minds of one's parents. The
only exercise my father got all summer was jumping to conclusions.
He objected to the girl I was dating this summer. I'll admit she was
rather a unique-looking girl. In fact, there are only two girls in California
like her, and she s both of them. But there was one thing about her I
especially liked. Her money.
She had a very good job, working in a wig factory. Her particular task
was to sort the wigs lor size. In the artificial top-piece business there are
four different sizes. (1) small, (2) medium, (3) large, and (4) Who turned
out the lignts! We spent our weekends by taking nice, long drives through
the country in my new car. 1 had to buy a new car; I couldn't afford
a used one.
Instead of using a roadmap, we planned our trips by following the
varicose veins on her legs. This method worked out very well until one
weekend our trip was rained out by the water on her knee.
I was going to get a job in one of the local canneries until I found out
that joker at the employment agency meant when he said the job was
"peachy."
The only experience I've had working with fruits (excluding a one
week engagement at Finocchio's) was in a winery in Fresno. I was a
grape-stomper. So when the boss at the employment agency asked me
if I had any cannery experience, I took off my shoes to show him my
stained leet. Before I knew it, he had assigned me to the company's
semi-pro football team. He thought I used to play for the Washington
Redskins.
Well, enough of this reminiscing. It's time to admit that, like most of
the rest of you. I'm glad to be back. One word of advice, though. Don't
make a blind date for the rcg dance. I had one last year, and she turned
cut to be gorgeous. Gorgeous George!

semi-pro football team. He thought I used to play for the Washington
Redskins.
Well, enough of this reminiscing. It's time to admit that, like most of
the rest of you. I'm glad to be back. One word of advice, though. Don't
make a blind date for the rcg dance. I had one last year, and she turned
cut to be gorgeous. Gorgeous George!
As they used to say in my high school typing class; now is the time for
all good men to ... . come back and mingle with those ivy-covered
professors and those clean-cut Stanford students. Clean-cut. That's a
society word meaning: "Why not admit it, we all just got clipped for two
hundred bucks!"
11 you can iorget about that tuition, however, it is really a relief to get
back to school, away from the suspicious minds of one's parents. The
only exercise my father got all summer was jumping to conclusions.
He objected to the girl I was dating this summer. I'll admit she was
rather a unique-looking girl. In fact, there are only two girls in California
like her, and she s both of them. But there was one thing about her I
especially liked. Her money.
She had a very good job, working in a wig factory. Her particular task
was to sort the wigs lor size. In the artificial top-piece business there are
four different sizes. (1) small, (2) medium, (3) large, and (4) Who turned
out the lignts! We spent our weekends by taking nice, long drives through
the country in my new car. 1 had to buy a new car; I couldn't afford
a used one.
Instead of using a roadmap, we planned our trips by following the
varicose veins on her legs. This method worked out very well until one
weekend our trip was rained out by the water on her knee.
I was going to get a job in one of the local canneries until I found out
that joker at the employment agency meant when he said the job was
"peachy."
The only experience I've had working with fruits (excluding a one
week engagement at Finocchio's) was in a winery in Fresno. I was a
grape-stomper. So when the boss at the employment agency asked me
if I had any cannery experience, I took off my shoes to show him my
stained leet. Before I knew it, he had assigned me to the company's
semi-pro football team. He thought I used to play for the Washington
Redskins.
