To the Editor:
A.D. 1948! With all due respect
to a fine Stanford football team —
Stanford to the Rose Bowl this
coming Jan. 1! A particularly ro
seate prediction, and a courageous
one even if in jest. Mitchum was
caught with a sagging lower lip;
Breier—to make a very safe pre
diction—is going to be caught with
his pipes down one of these days.
Any more such prognonsensations
as were smoke-ringed forth in Sat
urday's pipeful, and there'll be two
varieties of T men knocking at The
Daily's den door. Along with your
next chili co'n carne recipe, would
you mind printing that tobacco
formula? I, too, have periods of
mental depression.
Opiately yours,
A. WINTON BIGWOOD
