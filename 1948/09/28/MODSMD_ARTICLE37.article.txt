## Cleft Rock Tells Dramatic Struggle Over Water Rights in Central Valley 
### 
THE CLEFT ROCK by Alice Tis
dale Hobart (Bobbs-Merrill).
This is a story of the great Cen
tral Valley of California and the
struggle for control of it. Because
water rights mean survival or ruin
in the valley, the story has its fac
tual background in the long dispute
over the Central Valley Project
that continued between the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation and the
large power companies.
It is also the story of a great and
powerful pioneer family which is
disrupted, but fights to avoid being
divided, in the long legislative en
tanglements concerning the Central
Valley Project. The family is first
shaken when Edward Dodd unwit
ting y sets the family off on a long
string of compromises when, to
break away from the domination
of his father, he marries Katya Su
vorov, a refugee from the Bolshe
vik revolution. Within three months
the family forces Edward to desert
his confused bride and begin the
political career his father has de
signed for him. The family relies
upon the solid foundation of wealth
and power to obliterate the mistake
from the memory of Edward and
the public. Only the aued grand
mother chooses to remember Ka
tya.
The family is forcefully reminded
of the existence of Katya and her

son when the grandmother wills
her land in the San Joaquin Valley.
Over the protests of the Dodd fam
ily, Katva attempts to farm the
land. After several years of strug
gling, however, she is forced to give
lip when she loses the vital water
rishts. Because the power company
which the Dodds control and whose
interests Edward, now a state sena
tor. is supporting, and the U.S. De
partment of the Interior were still
carrying on the prolonged fight
over llie distribution of power, the
small farmers in the valley who
had hung onto their land stil! in
the hope that they would soon get
water were, unfortunately, the los
ers in the power disputes. With the
promise of water still unrealized,
Katya is obliged to sell the land.
Meanwhile Edward, married to a
socially prominent but invalid wife,
is about to be e'ected to Congress
when his political enemies uncover
the story of the unfortunate Katya
and her neglected son. The proud
Dodd family, to save Edward's ca
reer. is forced to recognize their
half-Russian relative, who by now
is thoroughly embittered over the
attitude of the family toward him.
The book ends with the meeting
of Edward and his neglected son at
a Congressional committee meet
ing. Here the son and his now po
litically corrupt father are on op

posite sides of the still continuing
fight over the Central Valley Proj
ect.
This novel is at its best when it is
dealing with the factual elements
of the story. The account of the
legal disputes and the effects of the
controversy is very interesting. The
fictional parts are less adeptly han
dled. Edward Dodd, unlike the
forceful hero of the author's book,
"Oil for (he Lamps of China," is
structurally a chameleon. Because
he enters the story only at intervals
between 1920 and the early 19405,
his character is never very suc
cessfu'ly established. Between the
first part of the book and the final
chapter there has obvious 1 y been a
complete metamorphosis in his na
ture; however, the gradual disinte
i ration of his instinctive honesty is
never clearly illuminated. Of all
the characters he is the least effec
tive because he never quite fulfills
the promise of the first chapters.
Nevetheloss, while ihe character
izations of the Dodds family can
hold little claim to originality or
distinction, the historical opinion
and the sympathetic treatment of
it are sufficient reasons for recom
mending the book. For Califor
nians. particularly, "The Cleft
Rock" should prove to be both
fascinating and edifving. — Priscilla

vorov, a refugee from the Bolshe
vik revolution. Within three months
the family forces Edward to desert
his confused bride and begin the
political career his father has de
signed for him. The family relies
upon the solid foundation of wealth
and power to obliterate the mistake
from the memory of Edward and
the public. Only the aued grand
mother chooses to remember Ka
tya.
The family is forcefully reminded
of the existence of Katya and her

son when the grandmother wills
her land in the San Joaquin Valley.
Over the protests of the Dodd fam
ily, Katva attempts to farm the
land. After several years of strug
gling, however, she is forced to give
lip when she loses the vital water
rishts. Because the power company
which the Dodds control and whose
interests Edward, now a state sena
tor. is supporting, and the U.S. De
partment of the Interior were still
carrying on the prolonged fight
over llie distribution of power, the
small farmers in the valley who
had hung onto their land stil! in
the hope that they would soon get
water were, unfortunately, the los
ers in the power disputes. With the
promise of water still unrealized,
Katya is obliged to sell the land.
Meanwhile Edward, married to a
socially prominent but invalid wife,
is about to be e'ected to Congress
when his political enemies uncover
the story of the unfortunate Katya
and her neglected son. The proud
Dodd family, to save Edward's ca
reer. is forced to recognize their
half-Russian relative, who by now
is thoroughly embittered over the
attitude of the family toward him.
The book ends with the meeting
of Edward and his neglected son at
a Congressional committee meet
ing. Here the son and his now po
litically corrupt father are on op

posite sides of the still continuing
fight over the Central Valley Proj
ect.
This novel is at its best when it is
dealing with the factual elements
of the story. The account of the
legal disputes and the effects of the
controversy is very interesting. The
fictional parts are less adeptly han
dled. Edward Dodd, unlike the
forceful hero of the author's book,
"Oil for (he Lamps of China," is
structurally a chameleon. Because
he enters the story only at intervals
between 1920 and the early 19405,
his character is never very suc
cessfu'ly established. Between the
first part of the book and the final
chapter there has obvious 1 y been a
complete metamorphosis in his na
ture; however, the gradual disinte
i ration of his instinctive honesty is
never clearly illuminated. Of all
the characters he is the least effec
tive because he never quite fulfills
the promise of the first chapters.
Nevetheloss, while ihe character
izations of the Dodds family can
hold little claim to originality or
distinction, the historical opinion
and the sympathetic treatment of
it are sufficient reasons for recom
mending the book. For Califor
nians. particularly, "The Cleft
Rock" should prove to be both
fascinating and edifving. — Priscilla

THE CLEFT ROCK by Alice Tis

This is a story of the great Cen
tral Valley of California and the
struggle for control of it. Because
water rights mean survival or ruin
in the valley, the story has its fac
tual background in the long dispute
over the Central Valley Project
that continued between the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation and the
large power companies.
It is also the story of a great and
powerful pioneer family which is
disrupted, but fights to avoid being
divided, in the long legislative en
tanglements concerning the Central
Valley Project. The family is first
shaken when Edward Dodd unwit
ting y sets the family off on a long
string of compromises when, to
break away from the domination
of his father, he marries Katya Su
vorov, a refugee from the Bolshe
vik revolution. Within three months
the family forces Edward to desert
