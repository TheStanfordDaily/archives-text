## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 27 (UP).— ,
Western football coaches today i
partly blamed their poor showing |
against Midwest teams on a Big
Nine ruling permitting "January to
June" spring practice.
Coach Jeff Cravath of Southern
California, whose team meets Ohio
State at Columbus next Saturday, .
said Pacific Coast Conference al
lowed only 30 days of spring prac
tice while the Big Nine permitted
unlimited drill.
Former Indian Mentor Speaks
Coach Clark Shaughnessy of the ;
Los Angeles Rams, a former coach j
in both leagues, agreed with Cra
vath at a meeting of the Southern
California Football Writers' Asso- |
ciation.
"A team with unlimited spring |

practice is bound to have more pol
ish and finesse," Shaughnessy said.
Coach Bert Laßrucherie, whose
UCLA Bruins were defeated 19 to 0
Saturday by Northwestern, com
mented only that the Wildcats were
the hardest-hitting team his squad
hyd ever met.
"I don't know how they do it
this early in the season," he said,
"but they were a smooth-operating,
hard-charging squad."
Cravath Disappointed
Although his team won Friday
night, Cravath expressed disap
pointment over their 21 to G victory
over Oregon State. He said his men
were not blocking and tackling like
they should and were' lucky that
Oregon State had an off night.
