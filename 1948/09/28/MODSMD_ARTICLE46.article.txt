# Another Unbeaten Frosh Team? Could Be!
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
What makes for a winning ball
club? Individual stars? If so.
Chuck Taylor's due for another
championship season as frosh foot
ball coach.
Judging from yesterday's scrim
mage with the varsity reserves,
however, the prediction doesn't
quite seem to fit. Operating on de
fense entirely, preparation for their
meeting with a tough Mt. San An
tonio JC eleven Saturday at the

Stadium, the yearlings were incon- .
sistent, to say the most. Spectscu- |
larly good at times, more cften just j
as spectacular'y bad, the Care babes
flashed "POTENTIAL" like a neon
sign. But the sign kept going on
and off.
Injuries Hurl Squad
In Gary Kerkorian and Dick
Horn, Taylor has a pair of fine T
formation quarterbacks, both with
the necessary accurate passing
arms. So far. however, injuries

have kept both out of action, so the
skipper spot remains in doubt.
As a matter of fact, the injury
jinx got Taylor and his two assist
ants, Crunch Crane and Dick Madi
gan, going around in circles al
ready, the latest addition to the
sick list being Chuck Mulavey, Se
attle flash. Mulavey was being
counted on for a lot of action at
one of the halfback posts before a
leg injury sidelined him for an in
definite period.
Mellavvay Shines
Howard Bugbee, state sprint
champ, saw action in the scrim
mage at safety, while Marv Me'.la
way at full, Eric Southwood and
Dean Shepherd at the halves com
pleted the back field unit. Of the
four, Mellaway as linebacker
showed best in the tackling de
portment, coming in time and time
again to put the stop on the var
sity ball packers.
Not in yesterday's tussle but re
putedly one of the mot effective
halfbacks on the squad, Harry
Houganian ran signals with the
frosh reserves at the quarterback
spot. If both Horn and Kerkorian
are stil! out Saturday, it will be
up to Houganian to run the team
against Mt. San Antonio.
Hardest part of the frosh line for
the varsity to pierce was the cen
ter. Guards Jess Cone and Joe
Jacob and center Dave Morley piled
up more than their share of plays
at the line of scrimmage. Doug
McColl and "Mike" Mikesell filled
the tackle spots with Bill McColl
and Wilbur Taylor at the ends.
Defense Needs Work
How effective their offensive
punch will be reains to be seen,
of course, but it had better be good
for more than a few touchdowns a
game if the yearlings plan to allow
their opponents as many as they
did yesterday. Once sprung into the
secondary, the varsity ballpackers
managed to go all the way more
often than they were stopped.

arms. So far. however, injuries

have kept both out of action, so the
skipper spot remains in doubt.
As a matter of fact, the injury
jinx got Taylor and his two assist
ants, Crunch Crane and Dick Madi
gan, going around in circles al
ready, the latest addition to the
sick list being Chuck Mulavey, Se
attle flash. Mulavey was being
counted on for a lot of action at
one of the halfback posts before a
leg injury sidelined him for an in
definite period.
Mellavvay Shines
Howard Bugbee, state sprint
champ, saw action in the scrim
mage at safety, while Marv Me'.la
way at full, Eric Southwood and
Dean Shepherd at the halves com
pleted the back field unit. Of the
four, Mellaway as linebacker
showed best in the tackling de
portment, coming in time and time
again to put the stop on the var
sity ball packers.
Not in yesterday's tussle but re
putedly one of the mot effective
halfbacks on the squad, Harry
Houganian ran signals with the
frosh reserves at the quarterback
spot. If both Horn and Kerkorian
are stil! out Saturday, it will be
up to Houganian to run the team
against Mt. San Antonio.
Hardest part of the frosh line for
the varsity to pierce was the cen
ter. Guards Jess Cone and Joe
Jacob and center Dave Morley piled
up more than their share of plays
at the line of scrimmage. Doug
McColl and "Mike" Mikesell filled
the tackle spots with Bill McColl
and Wilbur Taylor at the ends.
Defense Needs Work
How effective their offensive
punch will be reains to be seen,
of course, but it had better be good
for more than a few touchdowns a
game if the yearlings plan to allow
their opponents as many as they
did yesterday. Once sprung into the
secondary, the varsity ballpackers
managed to go all the way more
often than they were stopped.
What makes for a winning ball
club? Individual stars? If so.
Chuck Taylor's due for another
championship season as frosh foot
ball coach.
Judging from yesterday's scrim
mage with the varsity reserves,
however, the prediction doesn't
quite seem to fit. Operating on de
fense entirely, preparation for their
meeting with a tough Mt. San An
tonio JC eleven Saturday at the

Stadium, the yearlings were incon- .
sistent, to say the most. Spectscu- |
larly good at times, more cften just j
as spectacular'y bad, the Care babes
flashed "POTENTIAL" like a neon
sign. But the sign kept going on
and off.
Injuries Hurl Squad
In Gary Kerkorian and Dick
Horn, Taylor has a pair of fine T
formation quarterbacks, both with
the necessary accurate passing
arms. So far. however, injuries

have kept both out of action, so the
skipper spot remains in doubt.
