# THE
						FRONT ROW

### JOHN HALL 
The class that Stanford displayed
against Oregon last Saturday was
no fluke. Some of the disbelievers
think that the Indians looked good
simply because Jim Aiken's men
were having a bad day. That's
sheepdip. The varsity footballers
can beat any team in the confer
ence. Any time.
And here's why. Stanford's for
ward wall is on a par with that of
most lines in the league. The line
men have the speed, power, and
diive that are needed for a win
ning team. Beyond that, the for
wards finally have come up with
the reserve strength and fighting
spirit that will help the squad to
get over bad moments.
Pasadena Bound?
The odds last weekend heavily
favored Oregon, but that won't be
the case in another Stanford game
this season. Anyone who saw the
contest realized that the Cards have
the stuff to keep climbing, even to
the point of spending New Year's
Eve in Pasadena.
The reason behind these stagger
ing 35 - point odds was simple
enough. The gridders looked slow
and almost ridiculous against San
Jose State, but first games are al
ways disagreeing with the form
chart. Throw it out.
The main thing that the eggsperts
were afraid of was the Stanford
backfield. Could the Cards handle
the "T" without a veteran quarter
back? Could Stanford's fumbling
halfbacks learn to move without
having to look back for the ball?
Could Marchie Schwartz find a
fullback that he could start two
weeks in a row?
Hock I:, Defensive Genius
The answers were a joy to be
hold. And simple to understand.
Take Don Campbell and mix in a
little Tom Shaw, and you have as
effective a quarterback as can be
found anywhere. Neither will match
Van Brocklin in passing brilliance,
but sophomore Shaw could mellow
into a top-flight fiinger.
And when Stanford doesn't have
the ball, "Rock" Campbell stands
head and shoulders above any qb
on the Coast. He is an alert pass
defender, a slashing tackier, and a
deadly blocker. He also does a
fancy job of hot-footing it up the
field on punt returns. His spirit and
aggressive play make him a very

valuable man to have 011 the field
at all times.
In short, Don Campbell is get
ting close to being the best all
around quarterback in these parts.
He has already out-sparked Trojan
Dean Dill, Bruin Ray Nage!, and
Cal's Dick Erickson. All Don needs
is the time and chance to prove
himself.
Halfbacks Galore
Most pleasing fact about Stan
ford's handiwork Saturday was the
show of talent given by the half
backs. The squad is swarming with
them. And they're all good. Pick
ing two starters out of the mob is
going to be a weekly problem.
At the moment, Davey Field and
Bob White are getting the opening
call. But Bob Anderson, tricky
Boyd Benson, Rupe Andrews, and
Jim Nafziger are battling to take
over any time. Besides them,
Schwartz gleefully adds Fourth-
Down Durket, Mickey Titus, and
Wayne Erickson.
All of which puts Coach Marchie
in a position where he has nine
starting halfbacks from which to
must choose two. From any angle,
he can't go wrong.

So, from.the Front Row it looks !
as if Stanford's combo will measure
up to that of defending champ USC. :
outstanding contender California. !
and any other eleven that happens |
to be in the way. The Indians have \
already out-shone Oregon, the boys
who were supposed to have a one
way ticket to the Rose Bowl.
