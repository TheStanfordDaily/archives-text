# Schwartz Greases 'New' Red Machine For Washington State Battle Saturday
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
With the knowledge that but for
three breaks they would have
staged the most surprising upset of
the new grid season, Stanford's
football team turns its attention to
the meeting with the strong Wash
ingon State outfit Saturday in
Pullman.
With the almost-plucked Oregon
Duck limping home after an in
glorious 20 to 12 win, the Redshirts
are determined to show their fol
lowing that they are the class of
the coast and that neither last Sat
urday's showing nor the ragged 26
to 20 win over San Jose State are
true indications of the new Red
Machine's power.

But in the same breath, coach
and scout Ray Hammett cautions
against overlooking this week's
game with the WSC Cougars. The

Pullman lads have had two weeks
to ready themselves for the Red in
vasion after their 48 to 26 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. Hammett j
points out that the Uolans gained j
but two more first downs than the
Cougars in that contest and that :
WSC had a total net gain of over
350 yards.
"They have a strong club, one '
that must be expected to score,"
stated the assistant football coach.
"They have a good passing attack." j
he added. Coach Phil Sarboe's men
completed 17 out of 28 passes in
the UCLA contest.
Jerry Williams, brother to Idaho's
1947 back Billy, is one of the bet
ter backs of the coast. He, coupled
with end Fran Polsfoot, presents a
passing combo that is expected to
give the Indians a lot of trouble.
No Serious Injuries
The Schwartzmen came through
Saturday's fray with no serious in
iuries. Cut lips that needed stitch
ing were evident, but no man was
injured enough so that he will be
out oi action. Guard Ted Liljenwall
has recovered from a knee injury
and will be ready Saturday.

Schwartz would single out no in
dividual for special mention after
the Oregon game. "I liked the
whole bunch. I'm proud of them
all," he said. Jim Aiken, Duck
mentor, seconded this sentiment
when corralled after the game. "I
thought the whole team played a
good game. They were the better
team on the field today," he said.

out lor over a week with an in
jured ankle and saw limited play
against what proved to be a tough
frosh eleven.
Schwartz tried fullback Bud
Klein and left half A 1 Turriziani at
the right half spot yesterlay in an
effort to give help to the fleet Bob
White.
With the knowledge that but for
three breaks they would have
staged the most surprising upset of
the new grid season, Stanford's
football team turns its attention to
the meeting with the strong Wash
ingon State outfit Saturday in
Pullman.
With the almost-plucked Oregon
Duck limping home after an in
glorious 20 to 12 win, the Redshirts
are determined to show their fol
lowing that they are the class of
the coast and that neither last Sat
urday's showing nor the ragged 26
to 20 win over San Jose State are
true indications of the new Red
Machine's power.
llammett Cautions Squad
But in the same breath, coach
and scout Ray Hammett cautions
against overlooking this week's
game with the WSC Cougars. The

Pullman lads have had two weeks
to ready themselves for the Red in
vasion after their 48 to 26 defeat at
the hands of UCLA. Hammett j
points out that the Uolans gained j
but two more first downs than the
Cougars in that contest and that :
WSC had a total net gain of over
350 yards.
"They have a strong club, one '
that must be expected to score,"
stated the assistant football coach.
"They have a good passing attack." j
he added. Coach Phil Sarboe's men
completed 17 out of 28 passes in
the UCLA contest.
Jerry Williams, brother to Idaho's
1947 back Billy, is one of the bet
ter backs of the coast. He, coupled
with end Fran Polsfoot, presents a
passing combo that is expected to
give the Indians a lot of trouble.
No Serious Injuries
The Schwartzmen came through
Saturday's fray with no serious in
iuries. Cut lips that needed stitch
ing were evident, but no man was
injured enough so that he will be
out oi action. Guard Ted Liljenwall
has recovered from a knee injury
and will be ready Saturday.

Schwartz would single out no in
dividual for special mention after
the Oregon game. "I liked the
whole bunch. I'm proud of them
all," he said. Jim Aiken, Duck
mentor, seconded this sentiment
when corralled after the game. "I
thought the whole team played a
good game. They were the better
team on the field today," he said.
