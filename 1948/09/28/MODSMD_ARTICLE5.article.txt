BERLIN. Sept. 27 G4 3 ).—The Ber
lin city government told the quar
re'ing Allied occupation powers to
day they should get together on a
Berlin settlement or all get out of
the city and let the Germans run it.
Berliners looked to the United
Nations as a last desperate chance
ior a peaceful settlement of the
East-West dispute over the block
aded city, but most people felt there
was little hope.
The German press was almost
unanimously pessimistic that the
UN could succeed where direct ne
gotiations had failed. The Commu
nist press claimed Berlin was none
of the United Nations' business and
warned that its intervention might
wreck the world peace organiza
tion.
Amid the speculation following
the breakdown in East-West nego
tiations. two things seemed imme
diately certain:
1. The air lift supplying Berlin's
Western sectors over the Soviet
ground blockade will bo expanded
as much as necessary to meet the
needs of approaching winter.
2. The building of a Western
German government in the British,
French, and American occupation
zones will be speeded as a counter
thrust against the growing Soviet
pressure on Germany.
A resolution drafted by the exec
utive branch of the Socialist-domi
nated city government contained
the suggestion that the Germans be
given full responsibility for the city
government.
But the resolution also asked that
"so long as the occupation of Ger
many continues" and Berlin re
mains under four - power control,
"no one power have any more in
fluence in Berlin than any other."
This was a direct slap at the
Russians, who have been seeking
to overthrow the legal ly elected
government and achieve full Com
munist control of the city.
