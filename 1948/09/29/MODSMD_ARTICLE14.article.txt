# European Students Observe American Football, Food, Clothing, Slang, Cars

### SHIRLEY ROGERS LORRY LOKEY 
"War is hell," General Sherman
once said, hut to hear the comments
about American football by seven
visiting foreign scholarship stu
dents, one would believe that mas
sacres were just a part of American
life.
The European equivalent of
football, they said, is soccer, a fast
moving footrace in which a bail is
booted, not carried, all over the
field of battle.
These seven students were cho
sen by the Foreign Scholarship
Committee this summer. Last
spring the student body endorsed
by a large majority a budget which
would cover expenses for eight stu
dents to come to Stanford for one
year's instruction. An eighth stu
dent was unable to make the trip
this year because he could not se
cure proper credentials to travel
abroad.
It is felt that by bringing Euro
pean students to this country, we
will be able to show them more of
the United States and its people
than if several thousand Americans
journeyed to Europe. While here,
these students will have nine
months to observe the qualities
which make up our country but
which are so often misrepresented
by well-meaning Americans trav
eling abroad.
During the year, all seven stu
dents will live as guests at a differ-

I ent Stanford living group every
; two months. All of the participat
! ing living groups have volunteered
| to house and feed them arid in some
cases to supply them with spend
| ing money.
Yesterday two San Francisco
j photographers snapped "action"
1 shots of the seven students. Be
tween pictures we talked to the
j scholarship winners.
Ice cream bars, watermelon, and
: the Chicago stockyards are a few
I of the surprises the students en
countered on their way to the Farm
from New York. They found Amer
ican beer to be much stronger than
the German and Austrian brands.
Cne of the two women already
has adopted an American clothing
fad. Dark-haired Margarita "Mag
gie" Goldstein, 23, Bulgarian politi
cal refugee living in Paris, said her
new saddle shoes were one of her
rst purchases in this country. She
has not yet shopped for the "new
look" as one of the photographers
suggested.
Pentti Lehti. 22 - year - old eco
■ nomics graduate from Finland, to'd
; of his anxiety to see the 1952 edi
, lion of the Olympics when they
■ : come to Helsinki. By that time, he
- j said, European athletes will have
I improved since the war, when ath
i letics virtually disappeared. Pentti
arrived in New York via sn Amer
ican Airlines plane from the Neth
erlands.
After Pentti had landed in this

country, he made one observation I
few native Americans notice. In
the lower housing areas of Chicago
he saw that many of the tenement
residents owned very nice cars.
A potential bull-sessionist is Jo
sef Wiesinger, 25, who hails from ;
(he Tyrol Mountains area of Aus
tria. Joe tasted his first water
melon during his visit to Chicago.
Naboth "Bob" Van Dijl, 25-year
| old Rotterdam student of social ge
ography. worked with the Dutch
underground during the war. To
day Bob reports that the Nether
lands is busy patching up the dikes
Ito reclaim farm lands. Rotterdam j
i reconstruction is far from com- i
pleted, but the famed tulip indus- J
| try of the lowland country is in 50
per cent of its pre-war operation.
Both Sigrid Leube, 21, a German
girl who studied last year at the
University of Heidelberg, and Joe
1 Wiesinger, who attended a small
j Austrian university, said that nei- I
ther of their schools had been al- |
j lowed to have even a controlled |
newspaper, much less run a stu
' dent-operated publication.
C'aude Gizard, 23-year-old Paris j
i student, looked fprward to his les- j
| sons in American slang promised
■ him by one of the Stanfordites preL'- j
ent. Claude has found like others
that book languages are not too c?e
pendable substitutes for the collo
quialisms used in conversation.
