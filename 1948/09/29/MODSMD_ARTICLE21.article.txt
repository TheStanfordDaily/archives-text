# FOR ADEQUATE LIGHT
## 
### 
A headlight bulb does not have to
burn out entirely before its effec- I
tiveness is destroyed, although j
many motorists are under the im
pression that so long as a bulb will
burn, it will do it well. Usage dims
them and replacement from time to
time is one way of assuring an ade
quate amount of light.
Motorists should also check the
stoplight now and then. If the am
meter hand flickers when the brake
pedal is jabbed, the light is work
ing.
