# Stanford Band Seeks Members
## 
### 
Stanford's band is issuing its first
call to arms. They especially need
arms to carry basses, trombones,
and piccolos.
"Thus far nearly 75 musicians
have turned out," according to Di
rector Julius Shuchat, "but we need
about 25 more to complete the
band."
Anyone wishing to join the band
should report for practice Thurs
day at 4 p.m. Rehearsals are held
at the band shack, located east of
the men's gym.
Plans are being made for sending
the band to the UCLA game in Los
Angeles on Oct. 16. "We're going
to show the Coliseum crowd why
the Indian band is the best on the
West CoaSt," said Band Manager
Ed Cramer.
