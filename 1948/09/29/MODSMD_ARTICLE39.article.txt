SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 28 (JP).
â€”Attorney General Fred N. How
ser indicated today he won't attend
the meeting next Friday in Los
Angeles of Governor Warren's
Crime Commission.
The meeting has been widely
heralded as a "showdown" between
Howser and Adm. William H.
Stanctley, chairman of the commis
sion.
Howser, currently in Washington,
D.C., said he had been informed by
counsel for the crime study com
mission that his demand for an
"open and fair hearing" had been
refused.
"I do not propose to attend any
star chamber session such as that
contemplated." Howser said in a
statenifnt. "Upon my return to
California, in furtherance of Acting
Gov. Goodwin Knight's recommen
dation to me, I shall renew my de
mand for a showdown on this en
tire matter."
The lift between Standley and
Howser emanated from the current
investigations of reported attempts
to organize slot machine and
nunchboard "protection" rackets in
the state.
Meanwhile the Governor's com
mision disclosed quiet investiga
tions in at least eight counties of
reported attempts to organize gam
bling protection.
