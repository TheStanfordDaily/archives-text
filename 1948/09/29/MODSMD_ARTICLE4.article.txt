# Stanford-British Debate Scheduled On Socialism
## 
### 
The Stanford Debating Society
announced yesterday that they will
engage a combined British univer
sity debate team composed of rep
resentatives from the University of
Bristol and the University of Bir
mingham.
Topic of the debate, tentatively
scheduled for Oct. 22, is: "Resolved,
that modern society enjoys the
greatest benefits under a planned
economy."
"The debate ranks in prestige
with the Joffre Debate," said John
Hines, debate manager, "since this
is the first time since the war we
have debated a British team."
Hines said that the Institute of
International Education is helping
to sponsor the debate. Stanford is
one of 22 schools in this country
chosen to engage the British de
baters.
Tryouts for the British debate
and subsequent debates will be
held Monday and Tuesday at 7:30
p.m. in room 200 R. All prospective
debaters hould prepare five-minute
speeches either for or against the
question and sign up for the con
test with Dr. James Emerson in
room 203 C.
Hines emphasized that all stu
dents interested should not hesitate
to try out for the debate team. Six
to eight men will be chosen to de
bate in the finals next Thursday.
