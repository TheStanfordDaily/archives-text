will be no compromise of principles
in the dispute with Russia.

abroad in the world.
' While there is hope, we will not
relax our efforts to find common
grounds of agreement, or cease to
pray for just and peaceful solutions."
Dewey, whose aides say he stands

"I have seen all kinds of Ameri
cans. They make their living in
many different ways. They have
different backgrounds. They are dif
