# Chaplain Minto Welcomes New Students to Stanford
## 
### DEBBY WELLES 
Back for his second year as chaplain of the Memorial Church,
Robert M. Minto paused today to put himself in the position of
newcomers to the campus as he welcomed the freshmen to the
Farm and its religious activities.
"I was a freshman last year myself," Chaplain Minto said,

"and I know the many new expe
riences that confront Stanford ar
rivals. Many fields and activities
present themselves, and offer op
portunities which the student can
not afford to overlook."
"Among them, of course," he
added, "are the opportunities for
"deeper' thinking offered by Stanford
religious life."
Chaplain Minto, tall and distin
guished-looking, was a familiar fig
ure last year to Stanford students.
In the weeks to come, he hopes to
be of as much use to the freshman
class as he has been to the whole
student body in the past.
As chaplain, he can be found in
his office in the vestry of the Me
morial Church, and is always avail
able to students who have specific
questions or problems as well as to
those primarily interested in cam
pus religious life.
He delivers the Sunday sermons
in the Church, and it is through his
office that the many l'eligious or
ganizations on and off campus co
ordinate their activity.
His special suggestion to freshmen
was to "sit down and relax a bit
. . . . and have fun."
"Starting school is a busy busi
ness," he said, "but if you will learn
to take it calmly .... and, of course,
remember to come to church on
Sundays .... I am sure you can
all find time to enjoy religious ac
tivities and serious thinking as a
part of your life at Stanford."
