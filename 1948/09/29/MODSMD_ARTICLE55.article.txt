# 'International' Lag Auction On Saturday
## 
### 
Wrangle some bargains, furnish
your room, buy some Christmas
presents, and at the same time help
the needy in Europe—all at the 10-
cent-to-highest-bidder auction at
Lagunita's International A - Fair
Saturday night from 8 to 1 o'clock.
H. Donald Winbigler, one regis
trar who will do some of the yell
ing himself for a change, will bark
out the auction tallies at 9:15 and
10:15 p.m.
Among the "priceless" articles
which will adorn the auction stand
will be two footballs with the sig
natures of Stanford players and a
carvcd totem pole by Sharon Nuss.
Topping the oh-so-hard-to-get
list arc oriental "treasures" and new
tires. And the Stanford rough who
can t get his Indian maiden to knit
him argyles will be able to get some
—if he can outbid the other rough
that is.
Two hundred baby orchids and
hand-made woven ski belts will be
offered lor sale along with ash trays
and fountain pens.
Everything from bulletin boards
to plants will deck the home fur
nishings department, which is com
plete even to apron and towel sets.
All articles go to the last and
loudest bidder on a cash and carry
basis, although checks will be ac
cepted from those with student,
body cards.
The auction is but one feature in
the all-campus, all-variety evening
ol shows, puppet shows, carnival
booths, fortune telling, and ball
room and folk dancing.
There is no admission charge, and
all proceeds go to European relief
organizations on campus.
