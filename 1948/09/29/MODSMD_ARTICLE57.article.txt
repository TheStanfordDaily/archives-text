WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 (/P) —A self-described former Communist
told congressmen today that the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine
Workers (CIO) is "the largest Communist-dominated organization in
the United States."
A House Labor subcommittee received the testimony from James J.
Conroy, who said he used to belong to the union and for about six
years was a member of the Communist Party. The House group is
conducting an inquiry into Communist influence in labor unions.
James J. Matles, director of organization for the UEW union, was
callcd to the stand immediately. He refused to tell whether he is or
ever was a Communist, basing his refusal on Constitutional grounds.
Matles declared, however, that Conroy "is lying."
"Conroy comes from the gutter," Matles told Chairman Kersten (R-
Wis). "He is a management man who tried to wreck our union. He
stands for everything evil, just like you do, Mr. Chairman."
