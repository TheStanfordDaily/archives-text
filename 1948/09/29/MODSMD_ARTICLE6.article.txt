# Red Press Says Bevin Speech May Split UN Into Two Camps
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Sept. 28 (AP) â€”The Soviet press said today British Foreign Secretary Bevin's
speech to the United Nations raised the possibility of two camps in the UN going separate ways.
A Tass dispatch from Paris informed the Russian people for the first time that the East-West
dispute over Berlin is to be appealed to the Security Council.
The dispatch, printed in all Russian papers, made no comment on the development over

over Berlin, but carried prominently
comment on Bevin's speech.
A Tass dispatch quoted Bevin as
telling the assembly on Monday
that Britain may have to depend on
regional pacts "if we cannot con
tinue on a world basis, as we hope.
We must agree with those with
whom we can agree, work with
them with whom we can work, un
derstand and trust those who wish
to enter our confidence and under
stand us."
"This thesis of Bevin's is not diffi
cult to decipher,'' said the dispatch.
"It is a preparation for completion
of the schism (split) of the United
Nations."
Tass accused the Western Powers
of putting into effect "unconcealed
military preparations," and declared
Bevin's speech was an effort to
"cover up their refusal to accept"
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister An
dre Vishinsky's proposals for a one
third cut this year in big power
armaments.
