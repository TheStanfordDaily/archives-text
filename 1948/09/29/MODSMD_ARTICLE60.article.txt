## Activities vs. Grades 
### 
Two operations govern the events of college life; one is the
student's more specific attention to his studies, and the other is
his participation in extra-curricular activities.
Little emphasis need be placed on the academic side of the
ledger. But, because of their very frequency in our everyday
lives, social activities at Stanford have received noteworthy at
tention this quarter by the lower division and transfer student
pre-registration committees. The Activities Information Program
Saturday morning in the Union Court was but one part of a
commendable beginning to orient incoming freshmen and trans
fer students to the brighter side of college life.
Additional smokers, teas, and bull sessions in the dorms and
at the Village Clubhouse supplemented Saturday's program to
acquaint new men and women with the fer-reaching student
operated clubs and organizations.
Several months must pass before the full results of the ac
tivities orientation program can be measured. During that per
iod Stanford's new students must be assimilated into the student
body. It is the completeness of this assimilation—and the actual
interest that freshmen and transfer students devote to their clubs
and organizations—that will determine the value of the activities
orientation side of the pre-registration program. The Daily con
gratulates the Lower Division Pre-Registration and the Transfer
Students Pre-Registration committees and the Activities Agency
for their efforts in presenting these informative orientations.
Such a program is valuable to each individual. We realize
the importance of winning the grades, but we must emphasize,
also, the extra-curricular work to which Farm men and women
devote their free hours. And since there is little room in the
world for hermits, such work is important.
Though our respective clubs and organizations differ in na
ture, they do have one common denominator:
We meet other people; we learn to work with them; and we
gain those qualities which promote friendliness in the Stanford
Family.
You can budget your time for study and still have time for
activities. So, let's have some new faces among the old. —L. L.
