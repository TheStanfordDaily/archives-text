## Bull Session 
### 
Rather than go into honest work this past summer, your Bull Sessioner
managed to fall into a job with one of the local radio stations and suc
ceeded in cutting their listening audience by at least 50 percent, over a
period of three months.
Besides lisping my way through two newscasts, one of my main con
cerns was the selection of music for a daily two-hour disc-jockey show.
Sc. while the subject is fresh in mind, this morning's spiel shall be made
on the subject of popular (?) music.
After going over the music from the Universal-International Hick,
"Casbah," I'm convinced that the composers, Harold Arlen and Leo Robin,
have never heard of a place called Stanford University. If they had, they
would never have had the nerve to write a sons called "For Every Man
There's a Woman." Another ballad from that picture whose title caughl
our attention was a clever little play-on-words entitled "What's Good
About Goodbye." Obviously the sequel to this one will be named "What's
Hell About Hello."
One of our regular commercial shows was sponsored by a local haber
dashery. I thought it might be rather clever to play a Peggy Lee record
on their show to introduce it as "I'm All Dressed up With a Broken
Hart, Schaffner, and Marx," but the boss couldn't see it my way. Seems
there's a government regulation against anything that mentions Marx.
The platter that gave the jockeys and the public probably more laughs
than any other one was the Spike Jones-Doodles Weaver (that's our boy)
arrangement of •"The William Tell Overture." This, of course, was Doodles
doing his now-famous "Fcetlebaum" routine, while Jones supported him
by committing mayhem on the original overture by Rossini.
The Victor recording company had quite a struggle before they finally
managed to get "William Tell" on the market. When they first released it
back in May. the other side of the record was the standard favorite, "By
the Sea," arranged, of. course, in the madcap Jones style. After the record
had been in the hands of retail distributors for about ten days, a Victor
executive discovered an unheard bit of profanity in "By the Sea." The
disc was recalled from all dealers immediately, but not before several
thousand copies of it had been sold.
"William Tell" was then coupled with "The Man on the Flying Trapeze,"
and re-released in late June. Doodles also carries the ball on the "Trapeze"
number with a hilarious bit of stuttering, plus three quickie jokes, the
best of which yoes: "Say did you hear about the owl who married the goat?
They just had a hoot-nannie!"

on their show to introduce it as "I'm All Dressed up With a Broken
Hart, Schaffner, and Marx," but the boss couldn't see it my way. Seems
there's a government regulation against anything that mentions Marx.
The platter that gave the jockeys and the public probably more laughs
than any other one was the Spike Jones-Doodles Weaver (that's our boy)
arrangement of •"The William Tell Overture." This, of course, was Doodles
doing his now-famous "Fcetlebaum" routine, while Jones supported him
by committing mayhem on the original overture by Rossini.
The Victor recording company had quite a struggle before they finally
managed to get "William Tell" on the market. When they first released it
back in May. the other side of the record was the standard favorite, "By
the Sea," arranged, of. course, in the madcap Jones style. After the record
had been in the hands of retail distributors for about ten days, a Victor
executive discovered an unheard bit of profanity in "By the Sea." The
disc was recalled from all dealers immediately, but not before several
thousand copies of it had been sold.
"William Tell" was then coupled with "The Man on the Flying Trapeze,"
and re-released in late June. Doodles also carries the ball on the "Trapeze"
number with a hilarious bit of stuttering, plus three quickie jokes, the
best of which yoes: "Say did you hear about the owl who married the goat?
They just had a hoot-nannie!"
Rather than go into honest work this past summer, your Bull Sessioner
managed to fall into a job with one of the local radio stations and suc
ceeded in cutting their listening audience by at least 50 percent, over a
period of three months.
Besides lisping my way through two newscasts, one of my main con
cerns was the selection of music for a daily two-hour disc-jockey show.
Sc. while the subject is fresh in mind, this morning's spiel shall be made
on the subject of popular (?) music.
After going over the music from the Universal-International Hick,
"Casbah," I'm convinced that the composers, Harold Arlen and Leo Robin,
have never heard of a place called Stanford University. If they had, they
would never have had the nerve to write a sons called "For Every Man
There's a Woman." Another ballad from that picture whose title caughl
our attention was a clever little play-on-words entitled "What's Good
About Goodbye." Obviously the sequel to this one will be named "What's
Hell About Hello."
One of our regular commercial shows was sponsored by a local haber
dashery. I thought it might be rather clever to play a Peggy Lee record
on their show to introduce it as "I'm All Dressed up With a Broken
Hart, Schaffner, and Marx," but the boss couldn't see it my way. Seems
there's a government regulation against anything that mentions Marx.
