## Truth About California Revealed in New Book 
### 
DREADFUL CALIFORNIA, by
Hintnn Helper, edited by Lucius
Becbe and Charles M. Clegg
(Bobbs-Mcrrill).
The history of the gold rush days
of California has always been col
orful and interesting. Even more
fascinating, however, have been the
different impressions which the
state has made on different indi
viduals, including such writers as
Mark Twain and Bret Harte. Upon
liinton Helper, California made a
distinctively dreadful impression.
His book, recently resurrected, is
an amusing account of how the
California of 1852 appeared to a
Christian gentleman from North
Carolina.
Because he was sincerely shocked
by what he saw, he wasted few
kind words on the Golden State.
And for this reason, the book pre
sents a good moralist's view of the
social conditions of the time. The
author found himself in a veritable
cesspool of vice and corruption.
Two chapters, alone, were devoted
to a description of the shameful
ways in which the barbaric Cali
fornians broke the Sabbath. This
list of outrages was, of course,
coupled with a detailed account of
the more interesting sins being
committed in the city of San Fran
cisco.
Condition Never Hopeful
But it is the sweeping and dole
ful predictions he made for the
state which are particularly amus
ing. His estimate of the potentiali
tieis of California amounted to this.
"It must be acknowledged that
California's condition was never
hopeful. . . . Her resources are
rapidly being exhausted, and there
is but a lank possibility for the
future."
The agricultural possibilities were
dismissed without further consider
ation: ". . . the average or gen
era! surface of the country is in
capable of sustaining a dense popu
lation." Of the San JoaquinValley,
he wrote: "This valley affords an
other evidence of the unfavorable

condition of the country. It shows
conclusively that even the most
valuable parts of the state are en
cumbere with insurmountable im
pediments."
But the most perfectly ironic
statement, in light of the affairs of
California in the last ten years, was
this declaration, . . but when
California is thus peopled and con
verted into a place of permanent
habitation, it will not be by any
attraction it can offer immigrants."
A Chance tor San Francisco
To San Francisco, however, he
allowed a better chance of im
provement. "The profits she will
gain from the whale fishing fleet of
the North Pacific, and from trade
with the islands of the South Pa
cific, with China, Oregon and Rus
sia, will place her in a more promi
nent and enviable position than it
is possible for the State ever to
attain." And so on through the
book.
The author has, in fact, scrupu
'ously included a description of ev
erything he could find wrong with
California. It is not surprising, in
light of what must be admitted
about the mores of the bonanza
days, that the author found a
wealth of evil at which to point
his disapproving finger. The re
markable fact is that he managed
to exhaust all r.f the possibilities for
slander in such a small number of
pages.
Editors No Help
Of the work of the editors. Lu
cius Beebe and Char'es Clegu,
there is lit 4 le to he said. The wit
ticisms with which they sprinkled
the footnotes, although undoubted
ly representing a valiant attempt at
humor, at best only achieve the
distinction of beint facetious. The
preface, while being romewhnt
helpfuJ to the reader, can hardly
be considered invaluable, and is
difficult to read.
Thus, if posterity is to be at all
impressed with the efforts of Clcgr
and Beebe. in this instance, it
sb.ou'd be solelv throurh their hav

inji broueht Helper's account of
early California (o the public at
lention. For "Dreadful California'
is an interesting end enjoyable ad
dition to the literature of the his
tory of early California, a mnster
nirce of invective.â€”Priscilla Clau
dius.
