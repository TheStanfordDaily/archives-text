# Chronic Crises
## 
### BY JIM JOSEPH 
Somehow we're becoming inured
to crises. We've come to expect
crises—and are almost disappointed
by their absence. These days, though,
we're not often disappointed.
Every day's headlines are just so
many injections of a drug—a lethal
stimulant. They carry us on—from
one day to the next.
We've got so we require our daily
injection of crisis. It keeps us goin
—and assured that all is as it should
be in the cold war that has followed
the warm peace.
Last spring we were saying,
"there's goin' to be war, maybe.
Don't like to go back to the army
but guess we will if it comes right
down to it."
"Yeah," a buddy said, "it dor
look like war's comin'—the Russian
will push us just so far —and then
But we're not as scared now as we
were then. Those first stories out of
Berlin affected us like novices taking
to dope, it upset our nervous sys
tems—until we got used to it.
Mow the daily injections of conflict
are necessary—a habit.
It used to be we awaited hourly
reports—tuned on the radio to hear
if war was creepring up on us.
Now we're content to wait until
after dinner—when we can relax an t
sit down to read a paper. 1 hey're the
same crises—just as big and brutal
and important as before. But now
they can wait until after dinner—
until we feel ready to take our daily
dose.
Before,- we considered ourselves
participants—what happened in Ber
lin hit us hard. Somehow it seems
that now we've delegated our emo
tions to others— to let them worry
about things for us. And we've be
come spectators—and fool ourselves
into believing that the Eerlin game
of hide-and-seek is something we
can take part in or not, depending
whether we're interested—or have
the inclination.
Let the diplomats worry. It's easier
that way.
We've come to believe that crises
are everyday things—like weather
reports. If we don't like the weather,
we can stay inside, protected. Let it
rain—who cares. We've a safe roof
over our heads. Didn't we patch the
leak back in 1945—g00d and solid?
No water in the attic for us!
Before it was: "Something's got to
be done now—fast. Or we'll plunge
into this thing."
Now it's: "Let's wait; let's see what
happens tomorrow.''
And so the editors must dig deeper
into bigger type-fonts to scare us.
We don't scare easily— not any more.
Our temperaments have geared
themselves to crises—have taken to
the drug like adicts.
Once we've had our daily injection
we icel better—until tomorrow's.

happens tomorrow.''
And so the editors must dig deeper
into bigger type-fonts to scare us.
We don't scare easily— not any more.
Our temperaments have geared
themselves to crises—have taken to
the drug like adicts.
Once we've had our daily injection
we icel better—until tomorrow's.
Somehow we're becoming inured
to crises. We've come to expect
crises—and are almost disappointed
by their absence. These days, though,
we're not often disappointed.
Every day's headlines are just so
many injections of a drug—a lethal
stimulant. They carry us on—from
one day to the next.
We've got so we require our daily
injection of crisis. It keeps us goin
—and assured that all is as it should
be in the cold war that has followed
the warm peace.
Last spring we were saying,
"there's goin' to be war, maybe.
Don't like to go back to the army
but guess we will if it comes right
down to it."
"Yeah," a buddy said, "it dor
look like war's comin'—the Russian
will push us just so far —and then
But we're not as scared now as we
were then. Those first stories out of
Berlin affected us like novices taking
to dope, it upset our nervous sys
tems—until we got used to it.
Mow the daily injections of conflict
are necessary—a habit.
It used to be we awaited hourly
reports—tuned on the radio to hear
if war was creepring up on us.
Now we're content to wait until
after dinner—when we can relax an t
sit down to read a paper. 1 hey're the
same crises—just as big and brutal
and important as before. But now
they can wait until after dinner—
until we feel ready to take our daily
dose.
Before,- we considered ourselves
participants—what happened in Ber
lin hit us hard. Somehow it seems
that now we've delegated our emo
tions to others— to let them worry
about things for us. And we've be
come spectators—and fool ourselves
into believing that the Eerlin game
of hide-and-seek is something we
can take part in or not, depending
whether we're interested—or have
the inclination.
Let the diplomats worry. It's easier
that way.
We've come to believe that crises
are everyday things—like weather
reports. If we don't like the weather,
we can stay inside, protected. Let it
rain—who cares. We've a safe roof
over our heads. Didn't we patch the
leak back in 1945—g00d and solid?
No water in the attic for us!
Before it was: "Something's got to
be done now—fast. Or we'll plunge
into this thing."
Now it's: "Let's wait; let's see what
happens tomorrow.''
