# Farm Expansion Includes Dorms, Law School and Atom Smasher

### AL McCOMBS 
With an eye on the condition of existing facilities, which are
bursting at the seams from post-war education, the University
undertook a balance of heavy construction this summer that
places Stanford building investment over the 53,000,000 mark.
Deciding that some growing pains now would save perpetual

headaches in the future, the Ad
ministration gave the green light for
the construction of the $1,200,000
Stern Hall for men, the completion
of the University's $150,000 wiring
system, the reconversion of the Ad
ministration building for the benefit
of future lawyers, and a $93,000 lay
out for improvements on the steam
distribution system.
On top ot that, second floors are
being constructed in the Mineralogy
and Petrography buildings at a cost
of $102,000, and the construction of a
new microwave laboratory, for which
the Board of Trustees has budgeted
$281,300 lor building and equipment.
The appearance of excavators on
Escondido Road early this summer,
marking the beginning of construc
tion on Stern Hall, was good news
lor junior and lower division stu
dents living out of the campus area. '
According to plans, 240 students
wili be able to move in sometime
in 1949, possibly by summer quarter, j
Stern Hall will consist of two units :
of two pavilions each. A central 1
kitchen will serve separate dining
rooms in each pavilion, and each
building will have its own lounge.
Construction on the new dorm was |
given its impetus from a $400,000
grant from the estate of the late
Mrs. Louis Stern.
Completed during the summer was !
Crothers Hall for law students. '

Sixty-three men moved into modern
rooms this week. A gift from Judge
George E. Crothers of San Fran
cisco made the two-story structure
plus a house and law library possi
ble.
The hall, yet to receive landscap
ing. will be dedicated Oct. 23.
Construction work on Panama
Street is not an air raid shelter, but
a new power substation that will
feed watts and volts into the cam
pus's new underground electrical
system. At present, wire is being
fed into the piping laid last spring.
Twenty-two vaults scattered
throughout the campus will tie in
the huge network of wiring.
In the sub-station, a switchboard
containing nine switching gear units
will step down to 4.000 volts the
10,000-volt power delivered to the
campus by the power company.
Administration has given way to
education in the two-story struc
ture on the north side of the Quad
which once housed the Thomas Wcl
ton Stanford Library,
The building, originally named for
Senator Leland Stanford's younger
brother, will be a three-floor struc
ture with mezzanine levels above
the first and second floors.
Facilities will include lecture halls,
class rooms, a moot court, enlarged

law library, faculty offices, consulta
tion research and reading rooms.
Work on the building is being done
by Wagner and Martinez, San Fran
cisco construction firm, and should
be completed within 18 months.
Meanwhile, the administration of
fices have sought refuge in Encina
and the temporary buildings behind
the library. In Encina, which has
weathered the Stanford storm for 57
years, a new look has come to the
east wing oi the iirst floor, a sight
worth seeing.
In one of the first steps of the Uni
versity to modernize the Quad, the
remodeling of the two Mineral Sci
ence school buildings will provide
better and more efficient use of
space.
Stanford students have a new
atomic era word to learn—electron
linear accelerator. When completed,
the atom-smasher will be one of the
most powerful in the world.
Construction of the 160-fo'ot accel
erator is being directed by Dr. Wil
liam W. Hansen, head of the Stan
ford Microwave Laboratory. The
contraption will have a 400.000.000
electron-volt output. The atom
mangier is financed from the
University's Klystron profits and a
fund of the Sperry Gyroscope Com
pany. _


FINISHED, STERN lIALL will look like this wlfrn
il is ready for occupancy sometime in the middle of
next year. The $1,200,000 structure was started on
a grant «>t' $600,000 from the estate of Mrs. Louis
Stern. Two units each containing two pavilions

will house 240 students. There will he a central
kitchen and dining rooms and lounges in each pa
vilion. At the present, workmen are laying the
foundations for the building.

Stanford students have a new
atomic era word to learn—electron
linear accelerator. When completed,
the atom-smasher will be one of the
most powerful in the world.
Construction of the 160-fo'ot accel
erator is being directed by Dr. Wil

ford Microwave Laboratory. The
contraption will have a 400.000.000
electron-volt output. The atom

FINISHED, STERN lIALL will look like this wlfrn
il is ready for occupancy sometime in the middle of
next year. The $1,200,000 structure was started on
a grant «>t' $600,000 from the estate of Mrs. Louis
Stern. Two units each containing two pavilions

will house 240 students. There will he a central
kitchen and dining rooms and lounges in each pa
vilion. At the present, workmen are laying the
foundations for the building.
With an eye on the condition of existing facilities, which are
bursting at the seams from post-war education, the University
undertook a balance of heavy construction this summer that
places Stanford building investment over the 53,000,000 mark.
Deciding that some growing pains now would save perpetual

headaches in the future, the Ad
ministration gave the green light for
the construction of the $1,200,000
Stern Hall for men, the completion
of the University's $150,000 wiring
system, the reconversion of the Ad
ministration building for the benefit
of future lawyers, and a $93,000 lay
out for improvements on the steam
distribution system.
On top ot that, second floors are
being constructed in the Mineralogy
and Petrography buildings at a cost
of $102,000, and the construction of a
new microwave laboratory, for which
the Board of Trustees has budgeted
$281,300 lor building and equipment.
The appearance of excavators on
Escondido Road early this summer,
marking the beginning of construc

According to plans, 240 students

in 1949, possibly by summer quarter, j
Stern Hall will consist of two units :
of two pavilions each. A central 1
kitchen will serve separate dining
rooms in each pavilion, and each
building will have its own lounge.

Crothers Hall for law students. '

Sixty-three men moved into modern
rooms this week. A gift from Judge
George E. Crothers of San Fran
cisco made the two-story structure
plus a house and law library possi

Construction work on Panama
Street is not an air raid shelter, but
a new power substation that will
feed watts and volts into the cam
pus's new underground electrical
system. At present, wire is being
fed into the piping laid last spring.
Twenty-two vaults scattered
throughout the campus will tie in
the huge network of wiring.
In the sub-station, a switchboard
containing nine switching gear units
will step down to 4.000 volts the
10,000-volt power delivered to the
campus by the power company.
Administration has given way to
education in the two-story struc

which once housed the Thomas Wcl

The building, originally named for
Senator Leland Stanford's younger
brother, will be a three-floor struc
ture with mezzanine levels above
the first and second floors.
Facilities will include lecture halls,
class rooms, a moot court, enlarged

law library, faculty offices, consulta

cisco made the two-story structure
plus a house and law library possi
ble.
The hall, yet to receive landscap
ing. will be dedicated Oct. 23.
Construction work on Panama
Street is not an air raid shelter, but
a new power substation that will
feed watts and volts into the cam
pus's new underground electrical
system. At present, wire is being
fed into the piping laid last spring.
Twenty-two vaults scattered
throughout the campus will tie in
the huge network of wiring.
In the sub-station, a switchboard
containing nine switching gear units
will step down to 4.000 volts the
10,000-volt power delivered to the
campus by the power company.
Administration has given way to
education in the two-story struc
ture on the north side of the Quad
which once housed the Thomas Wcl
ton Stanford Library,
The building, originally named for
Senator Leland Stanford's younger
brother, will be a three-floor struc
ture with mezzanine levels above
the first and second floors.
Facilities will include lecture halls,
class rooms, a moot court, enlarged

law library, faculty offices, consulta
tion research and reading rooms.
Work on the building is being done
by Wagner and Martinez, San Fran
cisco construction firm, and should
be completed within 18 months.
Meanwhile, the administration of
fices have sought refuge in Encina
and the temporary buildings behind
the library. In Encina, which has
weathered the Stanford storm for 57
years, a new look has come to the
east wing oi the iirst floor, a sight
worth seeing.
In one of the first steps of the Uni
versity to modernize the Quad, the
remodeling of the two Mineral Sci
ence school buildings will provide
better and more efficient use of
space.
Stanford students have a new
atomic era word to learn—electron
linear accelerator. When completed,
the atom-smasher will be one of the
most powerful in the world.
Construction of the 160-fo'ot accel
erator is being directed by Dr. Wil
liam W. Hansen, head of the Stan
ford Microwave Laboratory. The
contraption will have a 400.000.000
electron-volt output. The atom
mangier is financed from the
University's Klystron profits and a
fund of the Sperry Gyroscope Com
pany. _


FINISHED, STERN lIALL will look like this wlfrn
il is ready for occupancy sometime in the middle of
next year. The $1,200,000 structure was started on
a grant «>t' $600,000 from the estate of Mrs. Louis
Stern. Two units each containing two pavilions

will house 240 students. There will he a central
kitchen and dining rooms and lounges in each pa
vilion. At the present, workmen are laying the
foundations for the building.
With an eye on the condition of existing facilities, which are
bursting at the seams from post-war education, the University
undertook a balance of heavy construction this summer that
places Stanford building investment over the 53,000,000 mark.
Deciding that some growing pains now would save perpetual

headaches in the future, the Ad
ministration gave the green light for
the construction of the $1,200,000
Stern Hall for men, the completion
of the University's $150,000 wiring
system, the reconversion of the Ad
ministration building for the benefit
of future lawyers, and a $93,000 lay
out for improvements on the steam
distribution system.
On top ot that, second floors are
being constructed in the Mineralogy
and Petrography buildings at a cost
of $102,000, and the construction of a
new microwave laboratory, for which
the Board of Trustees has budgeted
$281,300 lor building and equipment.
The appearance of excavators on
Escondido Road early this summer,
marking the beginning of construc
tion on Stern Hall, was good news
lor junior and lower division stu
dents living out of the campus area. '
According to plans, 240 students
wili be able to move in sometime
in 1949, possibly by summer quarter, j
Stern Hall will consist of two units :
of two pavilions each. A central 1
kitchen will serve separate dining
rooms in each pavilion, and each
building will have its own lounge.
Construction on the new dorm was |
given its impetus from a $400,000
grant from the estate of the late
Mrs. Louis Stern.
Completed during the summer was !
Crothers Hall for law students. '
