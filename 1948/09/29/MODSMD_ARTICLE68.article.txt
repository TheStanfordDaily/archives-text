# Farm Dorms Remodeled, Painted; Roads Repaired
## 
### 
Not to be outdone by the com
pletion of Crothers Hall and the
ground - breaking for Stern Hall,
the Corporation Yard has been
busy this summer painting, build
ing, and paving roads around the
campus.
The biggest change took place on
the first floor and basement of En
cina. The entire west wing of both
floors and part of the east wing of
the first floor were transformed
into oflices for the business staff of
the University.
While carpenters broke through
the brick firewalls to install con
necting doors, painters covered the
walls with eye-ease green and the
ceilings with a coat of white. Lino
leum was transferred from the old
Administration Building to the
new oflices.
Toyon Hall also got its share of
the face lilting. The room doors
were painted, according to Resi
dent Director Mrs. Gillette, the
color of a deep red wine. Walls and
floors were painted on the first and
third flooors and plans were made
for the renovation of the lounge
and game room.
Painters also went to work on the

interiors of many of the women's
residences, while Hawthorne House
got a complete external paint job.
The entire Petrography Building on
the Inner Quad was redone and
several new floors were added.
In response to numerous com
plaints from car owners on campus,
the road crew went to work and
completely repaved Galvez in front
of the stadium from El Camino to
Pine Street. A seal coat of tar was
applied to Palm Drive and to sev
eral parking lots near Tovon Hall
and the Chemistry Building.
