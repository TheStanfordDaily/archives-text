# Injuries Plague Indians in Scrimmage
## Rose, Taylor Hurt; Campbell Sidelined 
### 
The shadow of the injury jinx
of 1947 appeared on the Stan
ford football field yesterday
when first string end Ken Rose
was carried from the practice
field with an injured ankle that may
keep him out of the WSC game.
It was learned earlier that Don
Campbell, first string quarterback,
had been taken to the hospital for
examination and rest due to a head
injury suffered in last week's Ore
gon game.
Kose Injured in Scrimmage
Rose was injured in a scrimmage
with the freshmen, the second such
scrum in as many days. A newcomer
to the ranks of the Reds, tackle Ted
Taylor, suffered a slight shoulder in
jury also.
Schwartz supplied Chuck Taylor's
frosh with Washington State plays
and pass patterns and the yearlings
scored several times via the aerial
route.
Using reserve guards Hart Cook,
Ted Liljenwall, and Tom August, the
varsity members stymied the frosh
attack through the center. Ends Dan
Mervin, Bob Ghilotti worked well
from the end spots, as did Micky
Titus, Jim Nafziger, and Jim Cas
tignoli as linebackers.
It was only through the air that
the frosh scored. Passes to end Bill
McColl from quarterback Harry
Houganian counted for two markers
in the informal scrimmage.
DeYoung May Replace Campbell
Bill DeYoung, transfer from Chaf
fey JC worked at the safety spot
for the varsity and may see action
there in place of Campbell.
Halfbacks Boyd Benson, Jim
Hayes, and Bob White were secon
dary defenders for the varsity who
performed creditably.
