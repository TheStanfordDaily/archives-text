NEW YORK, Sept. 28 (AP)
The pennant hopes of the Bos
ton Red Sox and New York
Yankees were rudely jolted to
day by the Washington Sena

The lowly Senators stiffened the
Sox, 4-2, and the A's stunned th?
Yanks, 5-2, to dump the two con
tenders a game and half behind the
front-running Cleveland Indians.
The Indians, elated over the mis
fortunes of the Sox and Yanks, take
on the Chicago White Sox in Cleve
land tonight.
The Yanks and Red Sox each have
four games to play and so do the
Indians after tonight's game.
