Every football season the sports writers get together and start plugging !
some man from their area for All-Coast or All-American honors. In 1946
it was Burr Baldwin in the Los Angeles area. Last year Paul Cleary re
c l ived the backing from that faction.
Jackie Jensen and Rod Franz seem to have the indorsement of Bay !
Area writers this year. This was all decided long before the season
started. California looked to be the top coast team. Any team rated
that high must have at least one man of All-Coast caliber and perhaps 1
one of All-American class. Jensen has drawn the nod for both honors.
All this leads up to a nomination of a Stanford man by yours truly. Off
Ills showing in the two games thus far this season, I would like to place
before you the name of A 1 Rau for your consideration as an All-Coast
tackle. After watching both games, and the movies of same, I consider
Ai one of the best linemen to appear in Stanford Stadium since football [
leturned to Stanford after the war years. Big, likeable, "Gub-Gub" was i
overlooked in the pre-season hunt for likely all-something or other
material because (1) Stanford didn't look to be much of a football team, '
and (2) Rau, because he was injured early in the Idaho game last year,
did not see action.
While I am mentioning Stanford linemen, and tackles in particular,
let's cast a look toward the left side of the line and Gordon "Tex" White.
White is just a shade, if that, behind Rau in all around ability as a tackle,
ll was White who blocked a San Jose punt from the end zone and it was
White who helped cause a lot of the trouble put up against the Oregon
line, trouble that caused Duck mentor Jim Aiken to say after the game,
' My boys came to me at half-time and said they just couldn't handle
those Stanford linemen." Sophomore White may see the day when he
duplicates the feat of his father, who was an All-American tackle for
California under Andy Smith in 1923 and '24. Says Gordy, "Dad didn't
consider himself as All-American because he didn't make Walter Camp's'
te am." How times have changed.
I WOUND IT by sitting next to Phil Sarboe, Washington State football
coach, at the game last Saturday. He was busy charting plays and pass
patterns used by both teams but found time to express his surprise at
Stanford's football team. One occasion was after the Farm lads rolled
down field to score after Oregon had gone ahead. With the score at six-all
he said, "If you lose this game you Stanford people have nothing to be
ashamed of. You have a good scrappy team, they don't seem to give up."
Maybe I had better mention that it is Mr. Sarboe's team that Stanford
meets Saturday—in Pullman.
Add to surprising developments dept.—the two best defensive halfbacks,
at least the two that play on defense most, are two of the lightest men
on the squad. Dave Field and Bob White have drawn the nod from March
niont for their defensive abilities. Both are hard, low tacklers.
Figures released from the PCC Commissioner's office show tht Stan
ford is the top defensive eleven in the Conference with a 177 yards-per
game average. The Indians also rate the number one passing defense team,
allowing but 59 yards per game. And that average is after facing Mr.
Van Brocklin. Mike Durkett rates fourth in the Conference with a 37
yards-per-kick average. The Reds don't appear in the list of the top
five in total offense. Cal leads this department with a neat 807 yards i
total.
Which all goes to show that Mr. Schwartz is going to have a tough
time choosing the 37-man squad allowed for Conference games away
from home. Some good men will have to be left behind.
AWHILE HACK IN this article I spoke about the top linemen of the
week. It is always a hard job to pick one forward over another and sa\
that he is the best of the lot. This week it is even harder to pick a single
backfield star. But if I were to choose one I would have to pass over
the ball-carrying efforts of Bob White (who had a tidy seven yards plus
per carry average), Rupe Andrews, Boyd Benson, Marty Anderson, and
settle on Emery Mitchell as the best backfield performer of the day.
If and when you take in the movies of the Oregon game note the block
ing and linebacking of Mitchell. On one end run in particular, he looked
very good in taking out two Ducks with one block. J. R. Payne, tb;
fellow who handles the box that indicates the downs, said he could
hear and almost feel Mitch's blocks from his position on the sidelines.
