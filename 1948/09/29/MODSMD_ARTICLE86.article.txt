This could have been a little j
barb tossed at West Coast coaching j
brethren who complain that the Big
Nine is whaling the daylights out j
of Pacific entries because of an al
leged spring practice marathon.
Or it could have been to misguide
formidable Purdue, which tangles

Saturday. The Boilermakers gave
Notre Dame a terrific battle before

losing, 28-27, at South Bend, Ind.,
last Saturday.
At any rate. Voigts said at a foot
ball writers' meeting that "We did
n't beat too much ot' anything" in
