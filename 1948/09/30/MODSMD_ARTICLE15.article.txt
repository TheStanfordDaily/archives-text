# Fraternities Ransacked; $300 Missing House Jokester Plants Fake Note
## 
### 
Robberies early yesterday
morning, apparently by thieves
with a sense of humor, were re
ported by the Sigma Chi and
Delta Chi houses. Police Chief
Gordon Davis said yesterday.
Chief Davis said "we have no clues
as to the identity of the prowlers,
but we do know they entered thy
houses sometime after 1:30 in the
morning."
Members of Delta Chi estimate
that the thief had taken at leaj
s2oo, as well as two watches an
other small personal items. They als
found a note, written on fraternit
stationery, which read somethin
like this:
Dear Delta Chi Brother:
I'm sorry I wasn't able to steal
your watch, but understand that
you are somewhat of a robber
yourself. Although there actu
ally is no code of honor among
thieves, I would like to think there
is, so I have left your watch un
touched.
Fraternally yours,
JIMMY VALENTINE.
P. S. Next time please leave
your wallet where I can find it!
Some Delta Chis suspect trickery
concerning the note, saying that it
might well be the prank of an irate
pledge. However, they are convinced
that the robbery was bona fide.
The Sigma Chi house estimate
its loss at more than $100. In addi
tion, several small items such as
fountain pens have been reported
missing. One member said that this
was the second robbery in about
two weeks. On the last occasion,
about $90 was taken, he said.
