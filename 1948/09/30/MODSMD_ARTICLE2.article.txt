# Klahoya Sets Frosh Program
## 
### 
With the dual purpose of acquaint
ing new off-campus women with
campus girls, and of their becoming
a unified group, a new session of
Klahoya has set up a program un
der the sponsorship of Ruth Dimiek.
Each freshman girl has been as
signed to a Roble corridor, and every
transfer to a Branner corridor.
This gives the girls the privilege of
attending all the corridor's func
tions, and to spend the night there
on weekends.
The group will meet for lunch at
noon today in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse to discuss
social regidations. They are asked
to bring their lunches. Last week,
44) new off-campus students heard
Honor Code chairman Hawley
Smith speak.
The girls attended pre-reg activ
ities such as fhe jolly-up. barbecue,
and football game as a group, for
the first time this vear.
