# Big Game Gaieties Offers Parts For Actors, Singers, and Dancers
## 
### 
Al! students, whether experi
enced or not, who are interested in
any phase of the Big Game Gaie
ties are urged to try out for parts
and positions as actors, singers, and
dancers. It you possess any special
talent, Stanford's Bud Irving, di
rector of the Gaieties this year,
wants you.
Scripts, songs, and material for

! the Gaieties are now being accepted
in the dramatic manager's office in
the Student Union, room 13.
In the past, stated Irving, some
students have felt that the positions
| in the Big Game play were award -
1 ed on the basis of friendship to the
director and that there was a mo
nopoly on all major parts. All stu
dents this year, as has been the
policy in previous years, will be
given an equal opportunity in try
ing out for any and all positions
to which they aspire.
Tryouts for the Gaieties will be
held next Monday. Tuesday, and
Wednesday in the Memorial Audi
torium. The exact time and place
I will be announced later in The
| Daily.
Any student desiring to work on
the publicity end of the Gaieties
should contact Allen Bletz at the
112 Kappa Alpha house or Robb Crist
at the ASSU office.
