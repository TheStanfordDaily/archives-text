# Farm Research Institute Makes Airframe Report
## 
### 
The completed report on how
fast the country's airframe industry
can expand in case of a national
emergency was handed in this
month to the Air Force, to the
Navy, and to Secretary Forrestal
by Weldon B. Gibson, assistant di
rector of the Stanford Research In
stitute, who was in charge of the
airframe project.
The Research Institute was cho
sen for the project because of ex
perience gained in a previous offi
cial project on the more general
problem of the ability of the whole
aircraft industry to expand in an
emergency.
Gibson, war-time director of ma
teriel requirements for the Army
Air Force, says that a new scientific
method of estimating the expansion
of production was developed in the
first research project and success
fully used in this one. Once basic
data are in, computation of only an
hour or two by the scientific meth
od will furnish the researcher with
an answer. This method replaces
long uncertain guesswork employed
during the war. %
