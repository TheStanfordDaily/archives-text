# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Editor's Cuff Notes 
### 
Those wasps have to go! Otherwise there'll be more cases of
nervous breakdown than the Health Service can handle. Not
to mention a number of stings.
Once the area around the Cellar and the Union patio was a
pleasant place to have a cup of coffee and a sandwich or a
couple of doughnuts. Put now everyone eats furtively, keeping
en eye on the buzzing wasps.
Maybe the vicious critters don't like The Daily staff. Any
way most of the top brass has been bitten. And today they
picked on our little 100-pound book reviewer.
But, seriously, won't DDT, traps, or what have you, get rid
of the wasps?
Last year a blue-eyed lady, who had been the first Stanford
class with Chancellor Wilbur, gave us the low down on the
biology of the wasps, how they mate, multiply, etc. But she
didn't tell us what makes them angry.
El Campo Eating Club set up a trap that eliminated a few
of them.
But the pests are back this year, bigger and nastier than ever
-—and it's about time some action was taken.
Classes started yesterday. All of ours were a full hour. Right
down to business. None of this, "Hello, no work today; just
sign the blue card" business.
The entire editorial staff is pleased with what seems to be a
new enthusiasm about campus. As one office visitor phrased it,
"It's the new blood."
If you're unhappy about the lines at the Bookstore, read the
column "On Quad" by Lorry Lokey, right below.
Eight o'clocks! They wouldn't be so bad if the psychologists
would stop yapping about the morning hours being most
productive.
Someone wanted to know why the Sunday Movies manager
didn't try something "experimental," like the Film Revival Series.
In case anybody else is wondering the same thing, we toss in
this bit of information. The Sunday Movies are designed for
pure entertainment. Students go to enjoy themselves, to blow
their tops after a hard week of study—not to ponder anything
heavy.
