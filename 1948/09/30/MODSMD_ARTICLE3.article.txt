tration books. The 79 late entries
brought the registration total to

counted for the increased enroll
ment this year, which was origi
nally expected to run 7,900 for au
tumn quarter.
A breakdown of figures shows
G.196 men registered, while women
number 1,846. The ratio is 3.3:1.
'"We were very much pleased
with the whole registration proce
dure this year," H. Donald Win
bigler, registrar, said today.
' The most difficult reg of the
year went a'ong exceptionally
smoothly, in spite of the fact that
all veterans had to completely
change their records (usually han
dled in advance)."
The new registration system,
made necessary by conversion of
the administration offices into the
law school, resulted in a stream
lined system which cut distances to
the minimum.
