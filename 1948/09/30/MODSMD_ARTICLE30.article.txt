## Stop the Bookstore Rush 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Several years ago registration day brought moans and groans from
several thousand students who did not appreciate standing in long reg
lines for two or three hours. Since Registrar H. Donald Winbigler's re
vision of the entire set-up, Stanfordites have had to reach pretty far for
registration procedure criticism.
With all of this simplification in the registration ritual, however, we
still have one tremendous headache to cope with—the Bookstore crowds
that pile up for textbooks. While Mr. Winbigler is not responsible for
book sales techniques, maybe he can put in a good plug to the higher
echelon at the Farm's only cooperative market.
As the situation stands we reach the Bookstore counter through sheer
strength. A Caspar Milquetoast type of person waits for hours, while an
aggressive individual is waited on immediately. I propose that sheer
patience be made the determining factor for textbook customers.
Instead of pouring through the firm's front door into a center-aisle
traffic jam, Stanfordites should enter the Bookstore through the side door
of the establishment. On entering the door, they could pick up printed
"title slips" calling for the name and author of the text, the instructor and
name of the course, and how the book is to be financed—cash or vet
eran's credit card.
After jotting this short history down—one title slip for each text—the
students would hand their slips to the salesgirls. The salesgirls would
round up all the books, note the price of the volume on the respective
title slips, and pass on to the next customer.
There's the picture. On paper it looks good. There may be a long
line to wait in, but it will be an orderly one. Salesgirls will wait on
customers in the order of their arrival. After they have secured their
books, the students will move on to the cash register to pay the bill.
Veterans will go to a special table to charge their texts on their veterans'
credit cards. After winding up book payments, the customers would file
out the front door. Under such a plan, the front entrance to the Book
store could be reserved for customers not buying books.
