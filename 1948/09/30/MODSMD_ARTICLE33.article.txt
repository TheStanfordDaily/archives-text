## Why Not Eliminate The Electoral College? 
### 
Good so far as it goes—that is a
fair appraisal of the resolution in
Congress to reform the electoral
college by which the Presidential
vote is reckoned.
If the amendment proposed by
Senator Lodge and Representative
Gossett is submitted and ratified by
36 states, it will prevent the repeti
tion of such a situation as resulted
from the Presidential election of
1888. In that year, Grover Cleve
land. running for re-election, won a
popular vote majority but lost the
electoral college. This was possible
because Cleveland's opponent. Ben
jamin Harrison, carried populous
states by narrow margins and so
won their entire electoral votes.
The pending resolution would
make this impossible. It would do
so by pro-rating the electoral vote
by states according to the popular
vote within the states. For exam
ple, assume that a state has four
electoral votes. Assume also that
Nominee A receives 300.000 popular
votes to 100.000 for Nominee B.
Then Nominee A would receive
three electoral votes and Nominee
B would receive one electoral vote.
This obviously is a great im
provement in that it removes one
of the major dangers of the elec
toral college. Under this present
proposed plan, voters can be as
sured that the candidate a major
ity of them cast their ballots for
will be the one-elected to office.
But still this plan would leave
another danger. This is the danger
that a third-party candidate would
prevent a majority for any one of
the three nominees and thus throw
the election into the House of Rep
resentatives. This is the monkey
wrench which some of the South
erners would like to exploit this
year.
Weighing all the facts and taking
into consideration what would be
best for our democracy and the
people who make it so, I put forth
the plan that it would be better to
get rid of the electoral college lock
stock, and barrel. While Congress
is at it, the wisest course is to go all
the way.
Many Americans would like to
see the amendment revised to do
the job thoroughly. Since the reso

lution has favorable reports both in
the House and Senate, if the Con
gress does any amending at all they
should do the job thoroughly and
completely and put the Presidential
elections truly into the hands of
I the people.

sured that the candidate a major
ity of them cast their ballots for
will be the one-elected to office.
But still this plan would leave
another danger. This is the danger
that a third-party candidate would
prevent a majority for any one of
the three nominees and thus throw
the election into the House of Rep
resentatives. This is the monkey
wrench which some of the South
erners would like to exploit this
year.
Weighing all the facts and taking
into consideration what would be
best for our democracy and the
people who make it so, I put forth
the plan that it would be better to
get rid of the electoral college lock
stock, and barrel. While Congress
is at it, the wisest course is to go all
the way.
Many Americans would like to
see the amendment revised to do
the job thoroughly. Since the reso

lution has favorable reports both in
the House and Senate, if the Con
gress does any amending at all they
should do the job thoroughly and
completely and put the Presidential
elections truly into the hands of
I the people.
Good so far as it goes—that is a
fair appraisal of the resolution in
Congress to reform the electoral
college by which the Presidential
vote is reckoned.
If the amendment proposed by
Senator Lodge and Representative
Gossett is submitted and ratified by
36 states, it will prevent the repeti
tion of such a situation as resulted
from the Presidential election of
1888. In that year, Grover Cleve
land. running for re-election, won a
popular vote majority but lost the
electoral college. This was possible
because Cleveland's opponent. Ben
jamin Harrison, carried populous
states by narrow margins and so
won their entire electoral votes.
The pending resolution would
make this impossible. It would do
so by pro-rating the electoral vote
by states according to the popular
vote within the states. For exam
ple, assume that a state has four
electoral votes. Assume also that
Nominee A receives 300.000 popular
votes to 100.000 for Nominee B.
Then Nominee A would receive
three electoral votes and Nominee
B would receive one electoral vote.
This obviously is a great im
provement in that it removes one
of the major dangers of the elec
toral college. Under this present
proposed plan, voters can be as
sured that the candidate a major
ity of them cast their ballots for
will be the one-elected to office.
But still this plan would leave
another danger. This is the danger
that a third-party candidate would
prevent a majority for any one of
the three nominees and thus throw
the election into the House of Rep
resentatives. This is the monkey
wrench which some of the South
