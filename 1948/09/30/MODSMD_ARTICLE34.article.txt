i Dear Mom:
The news for the last few days can
j be told in one word—lines. No mat
| ter whether I have wanted to cat,
j register, buy books, or receive mail,
I've been forced to stand no less
than 20 people away from the de
sired position.
Monday morning was registration
(time for us Freshmen. The fact that
I weighed more than most of them
enabled me to complete my registra
tion by mid-afternoon. Most of the
! guys made it by supper. But they
tell me some of the girls were still
in line the next day.
Registration is a complicated proc
ess in which you see your advisor,
write checks, get seat cards, write
checks, make a date with a nurse
jat the health service, enroll for
j physique education, and write
checks. There's one thing I might
mention. It would be a good idea,
I think, if Dad would go down to
the bank'and check my balance.
After I had completed my regis
tration Monday, I thought I'd relax
a while and then go to dinner. That's
what everyone else thought—at the
same time. I got my meal ticket
punched about five minutes before
the dining hall closed.
There is a place known as the
Bookstore where I've spent quite a
little time also. It never had oc
curred to me that there were 7.000
other studerfts buying books this
week at Stanford. It has now oc
curred to me that I might have re
ceived my texts faster if I had writ
ten directly to Mr. McMillan in New
\ York.
Probably the most discouraging
lines which I have encountered have
been in front of the A to M general
delivery window at the post office.
A look at that line is frightening.
The chance that mail may not be
j my reward at the end of this long
wait is ominous before my slightly
homesick mind. Yet, as I approach
! the window, I always am encouraged
when some girl hits the jackpot for
five or six letters. But invariably
my thoughts are silenced by the
J words "Sorry, next please."
Love,
PETE

curred to me that I might have re
ceived my texts faster if I had writ
ten directly to Mr. McMillan in New
\ York.
Probably the most discouraging
lines which I have encountered have
been in front of the A to M general
delivery window at the post office.
A look at that line is frightening.
The chance that mail may not be
j my reward at the end of this long
wait is ominous before my slightly
homesick mind. Yet, as I approach
! the window, I always am encouraged
when some girl hits the jackpot for
five or six letters. But invariably
my thoughts are silenced by the
J words "Sorry, next please."
Love,
PETE
