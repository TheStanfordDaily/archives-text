# FBI Movie Thriller Fails To Meet Predecessors
## 
### 
Keyhole - peeking G - men and
bright red spies are currently chas
ing each other upon and down the
each other up and down the worn
aisle-carpets of the Varsity Thea
ter in Palo Alto. The flick. "Walk
a Crooked Mile," tries hard to be
a documentary film on the FBI.
Compared with its predecessors,
"The House on s)2nd Street" and
"The Street with No Name,"
"Crooked Mile" is a dismal failure.
It claims to be documentary, but
the only way the audience can tell
that it is anything so grand is by
the March of Time-like voice that
bursts out of the sound track at
appropriate times and calmly and
unashamedly informs the audience
just what the devil is going on.
The events and characters are not
only fictitious, but sometimes they
become downright ludicrous.
While "Crooked Mile" is far from
being one of the season's "musts,"
as far as entertainment value is con
cerned it is a better-than-average
motion-picture, the current aver
age being rather low. The acting is
sufficient and. on the whole, makes
up for the somewhat unbelievable
plot.
"Bullet-proof Dan" O'Hara (well
portrayed by Dennis O'Keefe) and
"Sherlock Scotty" Grayson (hap
pily played by Louis Hayward) are
a couple of good guys—Fßl and
Scotland Yard, respectively — who
are in charge of protecting the se
crets of a mythical government
project on the outskirts of Los An
geles. Just what they are keeping
so darn secret is never quite under
stood, but the words "atomic,"
"guided missiles," and "physics" are
bandied around enough to make
the audience realize that the project

is building something bigger than
Hollywood spongies.
Hollywood has traded in the old
villains' names—Franz, Hans. Lud
wig, for such up-to-date menaces
as Boris, Igor, and Joseph. The bad
I men are the same type who played
i Nazis a few years ago. In some
: cases they are the same actors.
Only now they call each other
"comrade," and the ever-patient
audience hates them just as much.
The picture gives some interest
ing FBI-lights as it switches locale
between LA and San Francisco.
Everywhere the "good guys" do
their best to try the patience of
every Red in the West, and in the
end they put the miscellaneous
traitors and spies completely out of
i their misery with some splendidly
J accurate machine-gun fire.
Wallace-ites and those just right
| of the Kremlin are somewhat paci
| fied—even after this unkind treat
[ ment of the Progressive movement
| —when at the flick's finale the
| number-one Soviet spy turns out to
be a Maine Republican who acts
! and looks as though he is a staunch
I Dewey man.
The companion feature, a Charlie
; Chan dillio from Monogram, de
serves this papers nomination for
j the worst picture in fourteen years.
I The plot is stale, the dialogue is
corny and stock, and the acting is
! unbelievably bad. The wiser patron
will bring a flashlight and a book
I along for this gem.
The newsreel now showing at the
Varsity is excellent. Pictures of the
] Chicago Bears vs. NY Giants foot
j ball game are the best in years,
although they are too short. Don't
I miss this newsreel.—Alvin Berry
