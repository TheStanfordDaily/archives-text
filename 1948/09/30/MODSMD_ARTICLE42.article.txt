## OSC Most Underrated Team on Coast 
### 
Today's piect" concerns what, at this writing, appears
to be the Conference's most underrated and over
rated teams. A cheer for Lon Stiner's Oregon State
Beavers, and a bit of the old raspberry for Bert La-
Brucherie's Bruins.
Right now the Beavers are one of the most under
estimated squads in the country. It's a funny thing,
but last year Oregon State was picked by many pre
season experts as the team to beat on the West
Coast, and it was rated among the first three on
nearly everyone's list of Rose Bowl possibilities. But
the Beavers got off to a bad start against Utah, were
plagued with injuries and bad luck all the way, and
finished the season with a 5-5-0 record.
Well, Coach Lon Stiner comes back this year with
substantially the same team—3o lettermen, a great
backfield centering around Don Samuel and Ken
Carpenter, considerable transfer and sophomore help
—and what happens? No one will touch the Beavers
in making early season selections. OSC was rated no
better than fifth in the Conference by any of the pro
fessional prognosticators, and as far down as eighth
by seven 1.
Thus far Stiner's men in orange have taken apart
Idaho in rather convincing fashion, and they scared
the daylights out of USC before finally succumbing
to a 44-yard Troy touchdown pass in the closing
seconds of play.
Before the season is too far along Marchie Schwartz
and his crew may thank their lucky stars that Lon
Stiner and his optional pass play isn't on the agenda
, for this year.
And the Flop ....
On the other side of the ledger are Bert Laßru
cherie's UCLA Bruins. No one of consequence has
j tabbed the Uclans as the conference champ, but many

of our journalistic brethren, particularly in the South,
have hinted that the Uclans will be right up there al
the finish.
The Bruins looked none too good in their openei
with Washington State, and should have stayed horn*
from their date with Northwestern in the Coliseun
Saturday.
That crack about UCLA being "definitely a weal
football team" made Tuesday by Northwestern's youth
ful coach Bob Voights, comes as somewhat of a sur
prise to most grid observers. It's not the kind of a re
mark that college coaches generally make about op
posing teams, past or future. The usual practice is t<
haul out the crying towel before and the "we wen
lucky" stuff after.
Young Mr. Voights, in only his second season a
Evanston, didn't follow the pattern. He must have na<
his reasons. The Associated Press dispatch points ou
that it might have been a little barb tossed at Southeri
California coaches because of their complaint about al
leged "January to June" practice sessions in the Bi
Nine. Or possibly the Wildcat mentor assumes the "a\
shucks, 'twarn't nothin'" attitude to misguide th
powerful Purdue squad which his team meets Satur
day.
A Whole 6l> Yards
Whatever the motive, Voights made the statemen
The some 55,000 spectators who watched UCLA roll u
the pitiful total of 66 yards from scrimmage last Sat
urday should bear him out. Meanwhile, an array t
Northwestern backs, running well down into the thii
string, poured through the Bruin line for 218 yard
and passed for 130 more. The score was only 19 to 1
true, but only the excellent punting of veteran rigl
half Ernie Johnson, and 110 yards in penalties again
the Wildcats kept it that low.

Beavers, and a bit of the old raspberry for Bert La-
Brucherie's Bruins.
Right now the Beavers are one of the most under
estimated squads in the country. It's a funny thing,
but last year Oregon State was picked by many pre
season experts as the team to beat on the West
Coast, and it was rated among the first three on
nearly everyone's list of Rose Bowl possibilities. But
the Beavers got off to a bad start against Utah, were
plagued with injuries and bad luck all the way, and
finished the season with a 5-5-0 record.
Well, Coach Lon Stiner comes back this year with
substantially the same team—3o lettermen, a great
backfield centering around Don Samuel and Ken
Carpenter, considerable transfer and sophomore help
—and what happens? No one will touch the Beavers
in making early season selections. OSC was rated no
better than fifth in the Conference by any of the pro
fessional prognosticators, and as far down as eighth
by seven 1.
Thus far Stiner's men in orange have taken apart
Idaho in rather convincing fashion, and they scared
the daylights out of USC before finally succumbing
to a 44-yard Troy touchdown pass in the closing
seconds of play.
Before the season is too far along Marchie Schwartz
and his crew may thank their lucky stars that Lon
Stiner and his optional pass play isn't on the agenda
, for this year.
And the Flop ....
On the other side of the ledger are Bert Laßru
cherie's UCLA Bruins. No one of consequence has
j tabbed the Uclans as the conference champ, but many

of our journalistic brethren, particularly in the South,
have hinted that the Uclans will be right up there al
the finish.
The Bruins looked none too good in their openei
with Washington State, and should have stayed horn*
from their date with Northwestern in the Coliseun
Saturday.
That crack about UCLA being "definitely a weal
football team" made Tuesday by Northwestern's youth
ful coach Bob Voights, comes as somewhat of a sur
prise to most grid observers. It's not the kind of a re
mark that college coaches generally make about op
posing teams, past or future. The usual practice is t<
haul out the crying towel before and the "we wen
lucky" stuff after.
Young Mr. Voights, in only his second season a
Evanston, didn't follow the pattern. He must have na<
his reasons. The Associated Press dispatch points ou
that it might have been a little barb tossed at Southeri
California coaches because of their complaint about al
leged "January to June" practice sessions in the Bi
Nine. Or possibly the Wildcat mentor assumes the "a\
shucks, 'twarn't nothin'" attitude to misguide th
powerful Purdue squad which his team meets Satur
day.
A Whole 6l> Yards
Whatever the motive, Voights made the statemen
The some 55,000 spectators who watched UCLA roll u
the pitiful total of 66 yards from scrimmage last Sat
urday should bear him out. Meanwhile, an array t
Northwestern backs, running well down into the thii
string, poured through the Bruin line for 218 yard
and passed for 130 more. The score was only 19 to 1
true, but only the excellent punting of veteran rigl
half Ernie Johnson, and 110 yards in penalties again
the Wildcats kept it that low.
Today's piect" concerns what, at this writing, appears
to be the Conference's most underrated and over
rated teams. A cheer for Lon Stiner's Oregon State
