RENO. Nev.. Sept. 29 (/P). â€”Coach
| Joe Sheeketski today continued to
; work on what is already one of the
nation's most potent grid offenses
as he readied his University of
1 Nevada Wolfpack eleven for Sun
day's game with the University of
San Francisco.
i He said all first-stringers are fit
j for action, but steered clear of
j scrimmages to avoid damaging in
! juries. The Nevada squad concen
trated on passing and signal drills,
with quarterback Stan Heath, who
completed 16 of 30 passes in Ne
vada's 39-0 rout of San Jose State
last week, doing most of the throw
ing.
