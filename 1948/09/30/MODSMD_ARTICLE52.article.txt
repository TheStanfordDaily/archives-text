# Frosh Prep For Opener
## 
### 
With two top quarterbacks, a
I starting guard, and a pair of half
| backs due to watch Saturday's Mt.
San Antonio fracas from the side
lines, because of injuries, frosh
! football mentor Chuck Taylor
j looked a wee bit low at the start
|of yesterday's practice. It wasn't
j too long, however, after the year
j lings had commenced offensive
! drills against the varsity that Tay
lor began looking a little happier.
Harry Hugasian, a hard-running
half switched to quarter when mis
eries forced Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn out of action, showed
himself well adapted to his new
job in running the Cardbabes' of
fense. Only frosh scores of the af
ternoon came as a result of passes
from Hugasian to left end Bill Mc-
Coll.
On the ground, especially over
the tackle spots, Taylor's charges
looked a little less promising. The
varsity line managed to pile up the
majority of the line plays aimed at
them without great difficulty.
Again the guard spots looked like
the strong points in the frosh for
ward wall. Jess Cone and Joe Ja
cobs handled their blocking assign
ments like veterans, outcharging
their opponents time and time
j again.
