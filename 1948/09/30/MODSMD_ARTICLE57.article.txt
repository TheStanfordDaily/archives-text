Big, juicy watermelon will be
featured at the junior-senior trans
fer watermelon feed tomorrow
night at 7:15 in the barbecue pit
at Lake Lagunita, according to Bob
Leefeldt, chairman of the event.
The Stanford Band will play and
student entertainment is promised
by Dean Borba.

Keep your own headlights prop
erly adjusted and the bulbs peri- j
odicially renewed to make the glare

of the other man's lights less dan
gerous and annoying, advises the
National Automobile Club.
