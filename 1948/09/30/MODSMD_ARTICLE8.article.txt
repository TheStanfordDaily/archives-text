The Bookstore was so packed
I with eager students yesterday that
they had to lock the doors for half
i an hour to get things under control.
Outside, even more students were
waiting in a large semi-circle in
front of the door.
Most students crowded toward
j the long textbook desk, sometimes
j shoving as if it were the exit from
| a burning movie theater.
At the uncrowded stationery de
| partment, a freshman in a Daniel
Boone leather jacket and a rooter's
cap nearly bought out the place,
buying four pennants, three boxes
of Stanford stationery (different
designs), two belt buckles, a beer
| mug, a Stanford wastebasket, and
stickers to the tune of $20 They
had to help him carry his load out
of the store.
A textbook salesgirl complained
that students come up and ask. "Do
j you have my book?" and expect
i them to produce the mapie book.
! Students, however, complain that
the girls can't find the text their
professor says he ordered.
People generally seemed pretty
good-natured about waiting. Oc
casionally, someone would moan in
desoair when he found out he was
i in the wrong line at the text coun
ter after a long wait, because his
text was at the general book coun-
I ter.
A blonde freshman girl was
asked by a stationery clerk if she
! was standing in the supplies line.
"Oh, I'm just shopping," she re
olied, as she looked down the long
line of veterans.
