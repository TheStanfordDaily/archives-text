LONDON, Sept. 30 (AP)—Field Marshal Lord Montgomery
will retire as chief of the British Imperial Staff in order to head
the military command of the Western European Alliance, gov
ernment sources said today.
An authoritative informant said the cabinet approved the Al-

liunce's choice of Montgomery as
chief planner for the defense of
Britain. France, Belgium, the Neth
erlands, and Luxembourg.
The official announcement of
Montgomery's selection is expected
to be made tomorrow by the Al
ance secretariat in Paris.
The choice did not meet with un
qualified approval. The Manchester
Guardian commented that Mont
gomery was "an inspiration to
fighting troops" but was not a plan
ner and was "an uneasy co-opera
tor."
"It might have been much better
to appoint a not unduly famous
Frenchman to act as a 'stand in'
and chief of staff to the real—and
presumably American — supreme
commander to be appointed when
and if war shou'd come." said the
newspaper.
Lt. Gen. Gerard Templer, 50, was
believed the likely successor as
chief of the imperial staff, a post
Montgomery has held sin£e 1946.
