Students from the Midwest, usually impressed with the ex
travagance of things Californian, have often shown their disap
pointment in the Stanford version of campus social life.
Look at the layout here, they point out. A wilderness of cam
pus —9,000 acres of it —the largest university-owned stadium in
the country, ivy-covered traditions that rival even those of the
big name eastern schools; and yet when an all-campus dance is
called for, it usually turns out to be a very dull affair in the
uninspired setting of a basketball pavilion.
Now for contrast, they say, look at schools like Illinois, Okla
homa, Colorado. There you have real dances. Not just a diver
sion for Saturday evenings, but big, live parties a la Elsa Max
well. Elaborate decorations, carefully-devised themes worked
out in minute detail—everything to make a dance a lively social
gathering instead of a social duty attended by most with a
feeling of complete indifference.
What they say is true. With the exception of the Sigma Chi
Embassy Ball (and a few others like it) and the class dances
staged off campus, there is little here, socially speaking, to com
pare with what is offered in big state schools. Even our Big
Game house decorations and parade floats, though cleverly
conceived, seem dwarfed beside state school circuses.
Why is this?
First of all, Stanford has never been known as one of the so
called "social" schools. High academic standards make compe
tition here just a little rough sometimes.
Another reason for this apparent lack of on-campus society life
is obvious. The necessary facilities just don't exist. Fraternity
and erstwhile sorority houses are small in comparison to the
palaces built on the campuses of some other schools. Seldom
do we have more than 60 active members in Farm fraternities
while other campuses boast memberships of more than a hun
dred.
No ballroom that can be known as such is at our disposal here.
Student union facilities are a sore spot on a campus which
prides itself in having such an abundance of first-rate equip
ment elsewhere.
A solution for this problem may be reached in a few years
with the completion of the Tresidder Memorial Union which
already is in preliminary stages. Present plans include a good
sized ballroom capable of holding the crowds that could be at
tracted to an all-school dance.
Fraternity dances open to the campus last year were a popu
lar innovation which helped to remove the social vacuum at
Stanford. A revival of that worthy plan would also serve to
lessen the complaints that plague Excom members, besides
aiding in keeping student billfolds fat.
What probably is the strongest reason for the dearth of social
extravagances at Stanford is the existence of so many other di
versions not even connected with the campus. Instead of being
isolated in the backwoods country of the Missouri Ozarks,
Senator Stanford saw to it that his farm was laid out in terri
tory that today has entertainment easily accessible to anyone
with an automobile. (One look at the perpetual congestion on
Palm Drive, on the Row, and everywhere else is all that is
necessary to determine what percentage of the student body
owns automobiles.)
Within a few miles of the campus are a host of highway night
spots —plush restaurants like Dinah's and Rickey's, smoke-filled
jazz houses like the Bandbox, beer gardens like Belt's and Ros
sotti's where the beer is cheap and the company congenial.
A few miles beyond are the Peninsula hills and the Half
Moon Bay country; and only 30 miles to the north, the fabulous
San Francisco, a city with a name synonymous with the finest
entertainment to be found anywhere.
A few miles beyond—the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite, ski trails,
end mountain lodges.
To the south—Santa Cruz, Carmel, and Monterey.
With this perennial carnival all within driving distance of the
campus the case becomes clear. The glitter outside the Farm is
too stong to hold the Stanford rough and coed at school func
tions that play only a poor second fiddle to commercial enter
tainment elsewhere—unless, of course, that school affair promises
to be something better than ordinary.
Stanford social life will undoubtedly continue to remain on its
present level unless concerted efforts are made to offset our lack
of suitable drawing cards. Perhaps the new young blood in En
cina and Roble Halls or the new student union will provide the
necessary incentives.

Moon Bay country; and only 30 miles to the north, the fabulous
San Francisco, a city with a name synonymous with the finest
entertainment to be found anywhere.
A few miles beyond—the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite, ski trails,
end mountain lodges.
To the south—Santa Cruz, Carmel, and Monterey.
With this perennial carnival all within driving distance of the
campus the case becomes clear. The glitter outside the Farm is
too stong to hold the Stanford rough and coed at school func
tions that play only a poor second fiddle to commercial enter
tainment elsewhere—unless, of course, that school affair promises
to be something better than ordinary.
Stanford social life will undoubtedly continue to remain on its
present level unless concerted efforts are made to offset our lack
of suitable drawing cards. Perhaps the new young blood in En
cina and Roble Halls or the new student union will provide the
necessary incentives.
Students from the Midwest, usually impressed with the ex
travagance of things Californian, have often shown their disap
pointment in the Stanford version of campus social life.
Look at the layout here, they point out. A wilderness of cam
pus —9,000 acres of it —the largest university-owned stadium in
the country, ivy-covered traditions that rival even those of the
big name eastern schools; and yet when an all-campus dance is
called for, it usually turns out to be a very dull affair in the
uninspired setting of a basketball pavilion.
Now for contrast, they say, look at schools like Illinois, Okla
homa, Colorado. There you have real dances. Not just a diver
sion for Saturday evenings, but big, live parties a la Elsa Max
well. Elaborate decorations, carefully-devised themes worked
out in minute detail—everything to make a dance a lively social
gathering instead of a social duty attended by most with a
feeling of complete indifference.
What they say is true. With the exception of the Sigma Chi
Embassy Ball (and a few others like it) and the class dances
staged off campus, there is little here, socially speaking, to com
pare with what is offered in big state schools. Even our Big
Game house decorations and parade floats, though cleverly
conceived, seem dwarfed beside state school circuses.
Why is this?
First of all, Stanford has never been known as one of the so
called "social" schools. High academic standards make compe
tition here just a little rough sometimes.
Another reason for this apparent lack of on-campus society life
is obvious. The necessary facilities just don't exist. Fraternity
and erstwhile sorority houses are small in comparison to the
palaces built on the campuses of some other schools. Seldom
do we have more than 60 active members in Farm fraternities
while other campuses boast memberships of more than a hun
dred.
No ballroom that can be known as such is at our disposal here.
Student union facilities are a sore spot on a campus which
prides itself in having such an abundance of first-rate equip
ment elsewhere.
A solution for this problem may be reached in a few years
with the completion of the Tresidder Memorial Union which
already is in preliminary stages. Present plans include a good
sized ballroom capable of holding the crowds that could be at
tracted to an all-school dance.
Fraternity dances open to the campus last year were a popu
lar innovation which helped to remove the social vacuum at
Stanford. A revival of that worthy plan would also serve to
lessen the complaints that plague Excom members, besides
aiding in keeping student billfolds fat.
What probably is the strongest reason for the dearth of social
extravagances at Stanford is the existence of so many other di
versions not even connected with the campus. Instead of being
isolated in the backwoods country of the Missouri Ozarks,
Senator Stanford saw to it that his farm was laid out in terri
tory that today has entertainment easily accessible to anyone
with an automobile. (One look at the perpetual congestion on
Palm Drive, on the Row, and everywhere else is all that is
necessary to determine what percentage of the student body
owns automobiles.)
Within a few miles of the campus are a host of highway night
spots —plush restaurants like Dinah's and Rickey's, smoke-filled
jazz houses like the Bandbox, beer gardens like Belt's and Ros
sotti's where the beer is cheap and the company congenial.

aiding in keeping student billfolds fat.
What probably is the strongest reason for the dearth of social
extravagances at Stanford is the existence of so many other di
versions not even connected with the campus. Instead of being
isolated in the backwoods country of the Missouri Ozarks,
Senator Stanford saw to it that his farm was laid out in terri
tory that today has entertainment easily accessible to anyone
with an automobile. (One look at the perpetual congestion on
Palm Drive, on the Row, and everywhere else is all that is
necessary to determine what percentage of the student body
owns automobiles.)
Within a few miles of the campus are a host of highway night
spots —plush restaurants like Dinah's and Rickey's, smoke-filled
jazz houses like the Bandbox, beer gardens like Belt's and Ros
sotti's where the beer is cheap and the company congenial.
A few miles beyond are the Peninsula hills and the Half
Moon Bay country; and only 30 miles to the north, the fabulous
San Francisco, a city with a name synonymous with the finest
entertainment to be found anywhere.
A few miles beyond—the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite, ski trails,
end mountain lodges.
To the south—Santa Cruz, Carmel, and Monterey.
With this perennial carnival all within driving distance of the
campus the case becomes clear. The glitter outside the Farm is
too stong to hold the Stanford rough and coed at school func
tions that play only a poor second fiddle to commercial enter
tainment elsewhere—unless, of course, that school affair promises
to be something better than ordinary.
Stanford social life will undoubtedly continue to remain on its
present level unless concerted efforts are made to offset our lack
of suitable drawing cards. Perhaps the new young blood in En
cina and Roble Halls or the new student union will provide the
necessary incentives.
