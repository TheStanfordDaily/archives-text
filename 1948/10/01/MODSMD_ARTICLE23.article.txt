# BILL DAILEY
## Bull Session 
### 
One of the tong brothers walked into his room yesterday just in time
to see me going through the pockets of his sport coat.
"Where'd you hide your smokes?" I said.
"I've given up smoking cigarets," was his reply.
"The hell you have," I retorted. "I saw you yesterday, puffing on a
Camel."
'"IJiat's what I said. I've given up smoking cigarets!"

Now that the Pacific Coast League pennant race is over and the cham
pionship flag has been grabbed oft by Oakland's Casey Stengal and his
nine veterans of the Battle of Gettysburg, we'd like to pass on a snicker
told to us by the father of Billy Martin, the Oaks' second baseman.
(Martin, at 19, was the only regular on the Oaks' squad who didn't know
Abner Doubleday by his first name.)
It seems that when Coast League Prexy Pants Rowland suspended the
Oaks' star relief pitcher, Ralph Buxton, for "doctoring" the baseball, he
was barking up the wrong uniform.
According to Senor Martin, the man the officials should have been
watching was not Buxton, but rather catcher Ernie "The Schnoz" Lom
bards Slow-footed Ernie, who incidentally is the only base-runner who
has ever been thrown out trying to stretch a double into a single, was
apparently a little faster with his mind than with his feet. Throughout
every ball game he caught, he chewed a large quid of tobacco and spit
the juice into his mitt, with the net result that every new ball thrown
into the game was dripping wet after about three or four pitches.
Talk about a spitball! Those Oakland hurlers were the only chuckers
in the league whose slow balls floated more after they hit the catcher's
mitt than they did in mid-air.

Speaking of the Oaks, I m reminded of the time they were playing in
Sacramento, with the game being re-created on the radio for the Bay
Area fans by an erstwhile sportscaster named Dean Maddox.
At the particular moment I have in mind, Maddox was re-creating the
first half of the fifth inning, with the Oaks at bat., When he finished
with the third out, he reached across the table and picked up what he
thought was the telegraph tape from Sacramento which had the results
of the las! half of the fifth. Instead he grabbed up the tape which had
on it the outcome of the first of the sixth.
Without thinking, he breezed through the first two outs of "the last of
the fifth." Then he suddenly realized what he had done. But instead of
explaining to his audience why Sacramento hadn't come to bat in the
last of the fifth inning, he uttered a statement that still stands as one of
the greatest displays of gall in the annals of sportscasting.
"Ladies and Gentlemen," he shouted excitedly, "for the first time in
the history of the Coast League, the Oakland Oaks have just come to bat
TWICE in the same inning!"

If you're the kind who shudders every time you think of the terrific
cost of food and housing here on the campus, you can sympathize with
a friend of mine. He spent last night at a hotel in San Francisco and
had to pay fifteen dollars for room and broad! (If you don't understand
this one, don't fight it ... . it's bigger than both of us!)
