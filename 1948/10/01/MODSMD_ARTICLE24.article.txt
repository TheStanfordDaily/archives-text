To the Editor:
It's not usual for me to write a
letter to The Daily, but last night
after talking with some of the
transfers I received some good sug
gestions on how to alleviate some
of the congestion that seems inevi
table with reging.
One student suggested that The
Daily print as complete a list as
possible of the required books, so
that the students wouldn't have to
crowd around one or two or three i
copies in the Bookstore. Do you
think that such a thing would be j
at all possible?
Another student asked if the ;
names such as'A-D might not be
changcd around so (hat those peo
ple whose names are at the last of
the alphabet wouldn't always have
to wait until the last to pick up
their books. Sort of rotate the
names with each quarter.
