# MORE ON BOOKSTORE
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Being a freshman, I thought per
haps the Bookstore madhouse was
just one of the rougher adjustments
I'd have to make to college life. I
was greatly heartened, therefore, by
Lorry Lokey's editorial on that sit
uation. Certainly such a plan as he
suggests, or one similar, can be put
into operation, and really must be
if the whole student body isn't to
enter the Rest Home following reg
istration.
There is one more idea: couldn't
a couple of hundred book lists be
mimeographed and, along with the
printed "title slips," be posted at
strategic points in the living quar
ters, thereby preventing that ter
rifying scramble outside the store?
Though no doubt (his would in
volve extra expense, pesonally I
think most students would much
prefer less rebate coupled with bet
ter service.
