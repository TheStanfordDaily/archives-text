# GOOEY SENTIMENTALITY
## 
### 
To the Editor:
After reading Gordon Addison's

column, "Dear Mom," in Tuesday's
Daily, I was embarrassed. First of
all, I was embarrassed for Gordon
Addison, who either was told to
write that stuff or chose to do so.
Secondly, I was embarrassed for
The Daily, which not only printed
the column but promoted it in the
editorial section. And finally, I
thought of the poor freshman,
whose intelligence you have grossly
insulted with this cheap sentimen
tality.
"Dear Mom" is (he sort of thing
we were continually subjected to
during the warâ€”in the movies, on
the radio, and in the newspapers. It
is known as ihe "I'm-Fighting-the-
War - to - Preserve - the Ameri
can - Mother - tjnd - the Corner -
Drug - Store type of journalism.
Philip Wylie, inventor of the term
"Momism," would bo delighted to
find his theories about American
apron-strings bolstered by The
Stanford Daily. I can already hear
him shouting, "I told you so," to
his skeptical readers.
It is difficult to believe that you
are serious about continuing the
column, but your editorial calls it
"one of the many new features we
hope to develop . . . this year."
Please, I beg of you, reconsider.
Call your staff together. Have
someone read "Dear Mom" out loud
and find out how bad it really is.
By acting at once you can still
save face.

(Policy this year is not to print
just the features that please the
editor. We are trying to put in
something fur everyone. We hope
Mr. Earle is being objective rath
er than looking at "Dear Mom"
from a one-man point of view.
Accordingly, we solicit replies
from the freshmen. Do you like
"Dear Mom"? Or is it too "senti
mental"?)
