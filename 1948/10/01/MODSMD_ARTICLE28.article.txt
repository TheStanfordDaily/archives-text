Gus Chavalas had a tricky prob
lem at his first Excom meeting,
but he handled it well. It was one
of those sleepers that seem harm
less, but one which could have had
troublesome repercussions.
Sigma Nu wanted Excom to
grant a closed date for the White
Rose Ball. The house thought the
closed date would improve their
chances of financial success.
Actually there won't be much
doing on campus Oct. 9 so the Sig
ma Nu's won't have to worry about
competition. But even if there
were, the closed date is something
Excom simply cannot hand out in
discriminately.
A closed date (meaning that no
other social affairs will be approved
on that date) is something reserved
for particularly worthy affairs or
campus-wide doings.
The way the Sigma Nu boys look
at it is this: they'd like to see a
good formal on campus. So would
we. And we wonder why the men's
Row doesn't get together for a big
formal, like the women's Row.

Speaking of Excom, the repre
sentation of the student body this
year looks good. Therefore, we
hope anyone with a beef will take
it to his Excom member instead of
wailing about "that awful Excom."

Not so many wasps today. At
first we thought maybe our edi
torial scared them away. But a
biology student says it's the cool
early morning weather.
Suggestions to date on ending
the wasp annoyance:
1. Close the snack bar for two
days and drench the area with
DDT.
2. Import insects that are natural
enemies of wasps.
3. Hold a mass meeting. Have
everyone catch one wasp.

Tom Elke has an idea to improve
color at games. It has merit. Idea
is to have someone dressed as In
dian Joe or in some costume clear
ly indicative of Stanford.
The appeal of such a "trademark"
is immeasurable. Over at Cal,
Oskie the Bear sets the crowds
wild just by his appearance.
Such a symbol lends support to
stunts, too. For example, at a Cal
game last year Oskie was driven
onto the field in an open car. On
each side of the field he planted two
blue and gold decorated poles.
Then, as the Cal band played the
final bar of the Cal Hymn, the
poles exploded, throwing blue and
gold dust into the air. The stunt,
spectacular though it was, would
have lost a lot of force if just any
student or .cheer leader had planted
the poles.
The sensation created by the Ore
gon Duck last year is another ex
ample.

Another rally suggestion was that
Stanford provide a cement "S"' for
Cal to attack, thus saving wear and
tear on Stanford buildings. (Be
lieve it or not, the suggestion comes
originally from Cal.) Schools at
tacking Cal usually vent their de
struction on the Cal "C," it is ar
gued.
But we wonder why good rela
tions can't be developed between
the two schools. Cal people aren't
so had. We met some double-dyed
Reds from Cal this summer, but
also some fine fellows.
What we have in mind is an ex
change rally between schools be
fore Big Game. The Cal Rally Com
could send a team to a Stanford
rally and vice versa.

Comment on the above ideas will
be appreciated by Excom and The
Daily.
