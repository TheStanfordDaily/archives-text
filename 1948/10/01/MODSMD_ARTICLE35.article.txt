# Frosh Open Season
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman eleven hits
the Stadium sod for the first time
Saturday when they smack into a
tough Mt. San Antonio JC ball
club in the opening go of the sea
son. Kick-off time is set for 2:30,
with admission free.
Coach Chuck Taylor's plans to
blast the Mountaineers with an
aerial barrage went awry early last
week when both his ace bombar
diers, Dick Horn and Gray Ker
korian, came up with injuries. The
outlook brightened considerably in
(he past few days however, when

Harry Hugasian, previously one of
the best halfbacks on was
switched to the signal post.
'47 Squad Excellent
Last year the boys from San An
tonio came up with one of the best
JC squads in the nation, going
through the season undefeated be
fore losing to Chaffey JC in the
playoff to decide the Western rep
resentative in the Little Rose Bowl
Game. Their record included a win
over the Cal Jayvees. Just what
remains from that powerful aggre
gation is a matter of doubt, but,
according to Taylor, there's no
doubt that the Cardbabes have a
trying afternoon in store.
The locals will open with How
ard Bugbee, prep speedster from

Redondo, at the left half spot. Marv
Mellaway, a hard runner and a de
fensive standout, draws the call at
full, while Eric Southwood, a good
all-around back, starts at right half.
Backing up Mellaway is Chuck
Brazle. Another reserve back who
will see plenty of action is~ half
Dean Shepherd.
Whatever Taylor's worries may
be, his ends aren't responsible for
them. Big Bill McColl, a slight lad
of 225 pounds from San Diego, has
given hints of tilings to come in
the smashing way he plays the
wing spot. But right up wifch him
are Wilbur Taylor and Bill Storum,
who alternately cover the right side
for the Small Red Machine. Either
Lee Daley or Owen Rhul will han
dle the left tackle assignments with
Chuck Hohanson at the other spot.
With Joe Jacobs and Jess Cone
at the guards and Dougold Thamer
at center, the San Antonio attack
should have little success. The mid
dle of the frosh line has consistent
ly shown itself the strong spot
during scrimmage the past week,
and either Dave Worley at center,
A 1 Raisch at guard, or Doug Mc-
Coll and Mike Mikesell at tackle
can fill in adequately.
Running off a modified wing, in a
so-called "A" formation, the Moun
taineers may well give Taylor's
charges an unpleasant time Satur
day." The JC boys are two years
ahead of the frosh, which means
they have played a couple of years
more of football, which means
nothing but trouble for the Cardi
nal yearlings.

'47 Squad Excellent
Last year the boys from San An
tonio came up with one of the best
JC squads in the nation, going
through the season undefeated be
fore losing to Chaffey JC in the
playoff to decide the Western rep
resentative in the Little Rose Bowl
Game. Their record included a win
over the Cal Jayvees. Just what
remains from that powerful aggre
gation is a matter of doubt, but,
according to Taylor, there's no
doubt that the Cardbabes have a
trying afternoon in store.
The locals will open with How
ard Bugbee, prep speedster from

Redondo, at the left half spot. Marv
Mellaway, a hard runner and a de
fensive standout, draws the call at
full, while Eric Southwood, a good
all-around back, starts at right half.
Backing up Mellaway is Chuck
Brazle. Another reserve back who
will see plenty of action is~ half
Dean Shepherd.
Whatever Taylor's worries may
be, his ends aren't responsible for
them. Big Bill McColl, a slight lad
of 225 pounds from San Diego, has
given hints of tilings to come in
the smashing way he plays the
wing spot. But right up wifch him
are Wilbur Taylor and Bill Storum,
who alternately cover the right side
for the Small Red Machine. Either
Lee Daley or Owen Rhul will han
dle the left tackle assignments with
Chuck Hohanson at the other spot.
With Joe Jacobs and Jess Cone
at the guards and Dougold Thamer
at center, the San Antonio attack
should have little success. The mid
dle of the frosh line has consistent
ly shown itself the strong spot
during scrimmage the past week,
and either Dave Worley at center,
A 1 Raisch at guard, or Doug Mc-
Coll and Mike Mikesell at tackle
can fill in adequately.
Running off a modified wing, in a
so-called "A" formation, the Moun
taineers may well give Taylor's
charges an unpleasant time Satur
day." The JC boys are two years
ahead of the frosh, which means
they have played a couple of years
more of football, which means
nothing but trouble for the Cardi
nal yearlings.
Stanford's freshman eleven hits
the Stadium sod for the first time
Saturday when they smack into a
tough Mt. San Antonio JC ball
club in the opening go of the sea
son. Kick-off time is set for 2:30,
with admission free.
Coach Chuck Taylor's plans to
blast the Mountaineers with an
aerial barrage went awry early last
week when both his ace bombar
diers, Dick Horn and Gray Ker
korian, came up with injuries. The
outlook brightened considerably in
(he past few days however, when

Harry Hugasian, previously one of
the best halfbacks on was
switched to the signal post.
