# Fearless Scribes Pick Stanford, Michigan, USC
## 
### 
With the reluctance of a chicken
being led to the chopping block.
The Daily's students of pigskin
prophecy once again march off to
resume their annual battle with the
scorebooks.
Treating the easy and tough ones
alike, here's the way they look this
weekend:
STANFORD-WSC
The adage, "You can't teach an
old dog new tricks," apparently
holds true here. The scribes, vet
erans of last year's debacle in which
they tabbed the Cards three Sat
urdays out of eight, apparently did
n't profit by the experience. Toss
ing caution to the wind, they unan
imously stand behind the Red Ma
chine in calling Stanford by 8
points.
CALIFORNIA-ST. MARY'S
Pappy says the Bears are in for
a rough time, but the peerless pick
ers say Cal by 33 points. Whom do
you believe?
OREGON-MICHIGAN
After last week, nine pick the
Wolverines while one lone optimist
tags along with the Ducks. The
consensus: Michigan by 10 points.
USC-OHIO STATF
This is a toughy. The Buckeyes
aren't supposed to have it, but look
what they did to Missouri. A six
four split gives the consensus vote
to USC by 3 points.
WASHINGTON-OREGON STATE
Another tough one. A nod to the
Huskies off their strong defensive
showing against Minnesota. Wash
ington by 2.
Playing the rest where they lie,
it looks like: *
UCLA over Idaho by 25
Santa Clara over Fresno by 20
Purdue over Northwestern by 7
Indiana over lowa by 9
Notre Dame over Pittsburgh by
30
Columbia over Harvard by 3
North Carolina over Georgia by
14
Army over Lafavette by 27
Nevada over USF (Sunday) by
26
Will'am and Mary over Wake
Forest by 13
