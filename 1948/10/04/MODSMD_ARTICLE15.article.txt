# Spiritless Indians Bow to Determined WSC. 14 to 7
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
A passing attack that failed until the final minutes of the
game, a woeful lack of blocking and tackling, and a general
appearance of listlessness are some of the reasons that the
Stanford football team returned to the Farm yesterday on the
short end of a 14 to 7 score against WSC.
Although the Cards outgained the Cougars 307 yards to 263,

and out first-down them 15 to 12,
WSC was the better team Saturday
Missed tackles led directly to one
touchdown and set up the other.
Once the Cards marched 68 yards
to the Cougar two-yard line where a
hard charging line held them for
four downs.
Cougars Were Inspired
In all faix-ness to the Stanfords it
must be said that WSC played in
spired 60-minute football, while the
Cards could not get off the pro
verbial dime until the last four min
utes of play.
The Schwartzmen piled up more
yardage chiefly through the run
around the WSC ends by Dave Fieh
and Bud Klein. Other than thes.
efforts the boys seemed to be jus
putting in their time when it carm
to blocking and tackling.
Washington State backs, who b\
the way will give everybody the\
meet a rough time if they play a;
they did Saturday, found the going
easy. High tackles that were easy to
slip away from, and just plain missed
tackles, were the reasons.
Cards Were "Flat"
In general it seemed as if the In
dians were resting on the laurels
gained in the Oregon tilt. The plane
ride up to Spokane was pleasant,
and the rooms at Moscow were good;
there can be no complaint about a
tiring trip. The Cards were "flat."
If they had played the way they
played in the Oregon game, the
score vvould have been much differ
ent.
If there had been a shred of a
passing attack in the first half,
things would have been different.
But three fumbles in the first quar
ter, one when the Cards seemed to
be on the way, cancelled the ad
vantage gained by out-rushing the
Staters. At half time the Indians
led by a 133 to 45 yards margin in
the yards pained by rushing depart
ment. The Cougars, however, more
than bah::iced the ledger with a
total of :00 yards to none in the
aerial di' ision.
Mataya "Sneaks"
A clever quarterback named
Frank Mataya was in the Cards' hair
all afternoon. His quarterback
'"sneaks" ceased to be sneaks when
he started to pile up yardage in the
two figures brackets per carry. The
tall lad would receive the ball from
center, wait a moment, and then pick
a hole and thread his way through
it until stopped by a halfback or
the safety man.
The Cards were not out of the
game entirely, however. They put
together several fine drives only to
bog down around the 30-yard
marker. The difference between
the two teams seemed to be in spirit
rather than ability.
Where the Cougar backs ran hard i
and the line worked all the time,
the Card men seemed to be getting
ready to do something throughou j
the game. It was not until the final
period that the Reds showed the
fans in Rogers Field that the near ;
win over Oregon was no mistake.
Benson Scores
With but three minutes remaining,
Boyd Benson went over from his j
own one for six points. Emery j
Mitchell, using his new "pusher"
type kick, added the extra point.
Jack Barnes next tried an onside I
kick and recovered the ball him- |
self on the Cougar 45. Shaw, who '
incidently received the praise of
many fans for his field leadership,
hit Rupe Andrews with a pass on
the WSC 17 only to have the whole
thing called back because of holding
by a Stanford forward, thus putting j
the ball on the Stanford 40. It is 1
very conceivable that, if there had i
not been a penalty, the Cards would !
have tied up the ball game.
Indians Come to Life
The spirit to win had been found
after 57 minutes of careless play. I
Tliis loss was not of the type that
Indian followers of last year have i
become accustomed to. Many has j
been the time that the Cards hav j
left the field with a moral victory J
earned through spirit and determin- j
ation. Saturday was not such a case. |
Perhaps if the game had been j
played at Stanford, far removed '
from the jinx of the Pa louse coun- :
try, the outcome would have been
different.
It was a good WSC team that
won; a team that outplayed the
Reds, but a team that Stanford
should have beaten.
Campbell Toothless
Quarterback Don Campbell suf
fered the loss of the top four front
teeth as the result of a tackle. Two
were all but knocked out and two
more were badly chipped and will
probably have to come out. Tackle ;
AI Rau was sidelined twice during
the game, once by an ankle injury :
and once by being hit on the head, j
All players who made the trip, with '
the exception of Ted Liljenwall and j
Bob Anderson, who were injured,
saw action.

short end of a 14 to 7 score against WSC.
Although the Cards outgained the Cougars 307 yards to 263,

and out first-down them 15 to 12,
WSC was the better team Saturday
Missed tackles led directly to one
touchdown and set up the other.
Once the Cards marched 68 yards
to the Cougar two-yard line where a
hard charging line held them for
four downs.
Cougars Were Inspired
In all faix-ness to the Stanfords it
must be said that WSC played in
spired 60-minute football, while the
Cards could not get off the pro
verbial dime until the last four min
utes of play.
The Schwartzmen piled up more
yardage chiefly through the run
around the WSC ends by Dave Fieh
and Bud Klein. Other than thes.
efforts the boys seemed to be jus
putting in their time when it carm
to blocking and tackling.
Washington State backs, who b\
the way will give everybody the\
meet a rough time if they play a;
they did Saturday, found the going
easy. High tackles that were easy to
slip away from, and just plain missed
tackles, were the reasons.
Cards Were "Flat"
In general it seemed as if the In
dians were resting on the laurels
gained in the Oregon tilt. The plane
ride up to Spokane was pleasant,
and the rooms at Moscow were good;
there can be no complaint about a
tiring trip. The Cards were "flat."
If they had played the way they
played in the Oregon game, the
score vvould have been much differ
ent.
If there had been a shred of a
passing attack in the first half,
things would have been different.
But three fumbles in the first quar
ter, one when the Cards seemed to
be on the way, cancelled the ad
vantage gained by out-rushing the
Staters. At half time the Indians
led by a 133 to 45 yards margin in
the yards pained by rushing depart
ment. The Cougars, however, more
than bah::iced the ledger with a
total of :00 yards to none in the
aerial di' ision.
Mataya "Sneaks"
A clever quarterback named
Frank Mataya was in the Cards' hair
all afternoon. His quarterback
'"sneaks" ceased to be sneaks when
he started to pile up yardage in the
two figures brackets per carry. The
tall lad would receive the ball from
center, wait a moment, and then pick
a hole and thread his way through
it until stopped by a halfback or
the safety man.
The Cards were not out of the
game entirely, however. They put
together several fine drives only to
bog down around the 30-yard
marker. The difference between
the two teams seemed to be in spirit
rather than ability.
Where the Cougar backs ran hard i
and the line worked all the time,
the Card men seemed to be getting
ready to do something throughou j
the game. It was not until the final
period that the Reds showed the
fans in Rogers Field that the near ;
win over Oregon was no mistake.
Benson Scores
With but three minutes remaining,
Boyd Benson went over from his j
own one for six points. Emery j
Mitchell, using his new "pusher"
type kick, added the extra point.
Jack Barnes next tried an onside I
kick and recovered the ball him- |
self on the Cougar 45. Shaw, who '
incidently received the praise of
many fans for his field leadership,
hit Rupe Andrews with a pass on
the WSC 17 only to have the whole
thing called back because of holding
by a Stanford forward, thus putting j
the ball on the Stanford 40. It is 1
very conceivable that, if there had i
not been a penalty, the Cards would !
have tied up the ball game.
Indians Come to Life
The spirit to win had been found
after 57 minutes of careless play. I
Tliis loss was not of the type that
Indian followers of last year have i
become accustomed to. Many has j
been the time that the Cards hav j
left the field with a moral victory J
earned through spirit and determin- j
ation. Saturday was not such a case. |
Perhaps if the game had been j
played at Stanford, far removed '
from the jinx of the Pa louse coun- :
try, the outcome would have been
different.
It was a good WSC team that
won; a team that outplayed the
Reds, but a team that Stanford
should have beaten.
Campbell Toothless
Quarterback Don Campbell suf
fered the loss of the top four front
teeth as the result of a tackle. Two
were all but knocked out and two
more were badly chipped and will
probably have to come out. Tackle ;
AI Rau was sidelined twice during
the game, once by an ankle injury :
and once by being hit on the head, j
All players who made the trip, with '
the exception of Ted Liljenwall and j
Bob Anderson, who were injured,
saw action.

WSC was the better team Saturday
Missed tackles led directly to one
touchdown and set up the other.
Once the Cards marched 68 yards
to the Cougar two-yard line where a
hard charging line held them for
four downs.
Cougars Were Inspired
In all faix-ness to the Stanfords it
must be said that WSC played in
spired 60-minute football, while the
Cards could not get off the pro
verbial dime until the last four min
utes of play.
The Schwartzmen piled up more
yardage chiefly through the run
around the WSC ends by Dave Fieh
and Bud Klein. Other than thes.
efforts the boys seemed to be jus
putting in their time when it carm
to blocking and tackling.
Washington State backs, who b\
the way will give everybody the\
meet a rough time if they play a;
they did Saturday, found the going
easy. High tackles that were easy to
slip away from, and just plain missed
tackles, were the reasons.
Cards Were "Flat"
In general it seemed as if the In
dians were resting on the laurels
gained in the Oregon tilt. The plane
ride up to Spokane was pleasant,
and the rooms at Moscow were good;
there can be no complaint about a
tiring trip. The Cards were "flat."
If they had played the way they
played in the Oregon game, the
score vvould have been much differ
ent.
If there had been a shred of a
passing attack in the first half,
things would have been different.
But three fumbles in the first quar
ter, one when the Cards seemed to
be on the way, cancelled the ad
vantage gained by out-rushing the
Staters. At half time the Indians
led by a 133 to 45 yards margin in
the yards pained by rushing depart
ment. The Cougars, however, more
than bah::iced the ledger with a
total of :00 yards to none in the
aerial di' ision.
Mataya "Sneaks"
A clever quarterback named
Frank Mataya was in the Cards' hair
all afternoon. His quarterback
'"sneaks" ceased to be sneaks when
he started to pile up yardage in the
two figures brackets per carry. The
tall lad would receive the ball from
center, wait a moment, and then pick
a hole and thread his way through
it until stopped by a halfback or
the safety man.
The Cards were not out of the
game entirely, however. They put
together several fine drives only to
bog down around the 30-yard
marker. The difference between
the two teams seemed to be in spirit
rather than ability.
Where the Cougar backs ran hard i
and the line worked all the time,
the Card men seemed to be getting
ready to do something throughou j
the game. It was not until the final
period that the Reds showed the
fans in Rogers Field that the near ;
win over Oregon was no mistake.
Benson Scores
With but three minutes remaining,
Boyd Benson went over from his j
own one for six points. Emery j
Mitchell, using his new "pusher"
type kick, added the extra point.
Jack Barnes next tried an onside I
kick and recovered the ball him- |
self on the Cougar 45. Shaw, who '
incidently received the praise of
many fans for his field leadership,
hit Rupe Andrews with a pass on
the WSC 17 only to have the whole
thing called back because of holding
by a Stanford forward, thus putting j
the ball on the Stanford 40. It is 1
very conceivable that, if there had i
not been a penalty, the Cards would !
have tied up the ball game.
Indians Come to Life
The spirit to win had been found
after 57 minutes of careless play. I
Tliis loss was not of the type that
Indian followers of last year have i
become accustomed to. Many has j
been the time that the Cards hav j
left the field with a moral victory J
earned through spirit and determin- j
ation. Saturday was not such a case. |
Perhaps if the game had been j
played at Stanford, far removed '
from the jinx of the Pa louse coun- :
try, the outcome would have been
different.
It was a good WSC team that
won; a team that outplayed the
Reds, but a team that Stanford
should have beaten.
Campbell Toothless
Quarterback Don Campbell suf
fered the loss of the top four front
teeth as the result of a tackle. Two
were all but knocked out and two
more were badly chipped and will
probably have to come out. Tackle ;
AI Rau was sidelined twice during
the game, once by an ankle injury :
and once by being hit on the head, j
All players who made the trip, with '
the exception of Ted Liljenwall and j
Bob Anderson, who were injured,
saw action.
A passing attack that failed until the final minutes of the
game, a woeful lack of blocking and tackling, and a general
appearance of listlessness are some of the reasons that the
Stanford football team returned to the Farm yesterday on the
short end of a 14 to 7 score against WSC.
