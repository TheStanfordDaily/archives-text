# Daily Tryoutees Assigned Stories

### 
A feature story assignment has
been added to the required tryoutee
schedule for freshman and trans
fer students who are interested in
working on the Stanford Daily edi
torial staff.
Coverage of this week's Tuesday
Evening Series promises to be the
most complete of the year, when
the 70 tryoutees write up the lec
ture as a news story assignment.
Stories will be judged and appoint
ments to the regular staff made at
the end of the two-week period.
Six hours' desk work is required
of each tryoutee during the two
weeks. Members of the Daily edi
torial board will speak at the meet
ing today on organization of the
staff and the duties of each office.
Embryo journalists aspiring to
work on The Stanford Daily will
meet at 4:15 p.m. today in room 8
of the Journalism Building, next to
the Daily shack. A two-week triaj
period to determine which of the
tryoutees will be appointed to the
Daily staff will be outlined by the
Editorial Board.
