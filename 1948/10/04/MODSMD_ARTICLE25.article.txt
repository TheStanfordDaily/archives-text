# 'DU's Are Stinkers—just Like Their Skunk': Mariposa Girls
## 
### JIM THURBER 
A peace offering was presented to the girls of Mariposa House
by their neighbors, the DU's, Tuesday night, but the gals turned it
down. The token of friendship and goodwill was one skunk—
dead.
As the story goes, the poor animal was scraped off Mayfield

Road by a sympathetic group from '
the fraternity last Tuesday and
brought back to the house for a
proper burial. One of the house
members had a better idea.
"Why let such a good article go ,
to waste?" he commented, survey
ing the wood-pussy draped over
the living room clock. "Here's our
chance to make up with Mariposa
House for stealing their Chronicle
this morning."
His brothers expressed complete
approval and a plan was worked
out. One brave soul rang the door
hell and, when the door was
opened, another DU hiding behind
him tossed the token of peace
through the door.
Retaliation Planned
But for some reason the peace
offering was not received in ex
actly the proper light and the girls
planned retaliation, first of all re
moving the walking perfume bottle
from their front hall.
Under cover of darkness, the
girls crept across the lawn to return
the skunk to its rightful owners.
They were discovered and were
forced to drop the animal and run
for cover in their own house, lock
ing the doors after the last member
was safely inside.
With a spirit of peace-at-all
eosts, the fraternity men decided to
give the token another try.
Once more they delivered the
pussy to their neighbors, but this
time they were forced to leave it
banning comfortably in front of the
door, the house being tightly locked
and the doorbell turned off.
Unpopular Perfume
For n while, the girls left the ani
mal on the front porch. However,
the aroma soon became more than
they could stand and they were
forced to do something about it.
Once again they started to take
the skunk back to their neighbors
and this lime they deposited it safe
ly in the DU garbage pail without
being discovered. Back to their
house they crept and the affair was
ended—for the time being.
The fraternity members never
lid find out what happened to their
dear pet. and are still wondering
why their peace token didn't work.
Meanwhile, war continues!
