"In order to form a more perfect union .... provide for the
common defense . . . ." reads in part the preamble of the Con
stitution of the United States. In the Constitution Congress is
charged specifically with providing for the defense of the United
States and Congress has done a notoriously poor job of it
throughout the years. Here is the record:
In the post-Revolutionary War period the standing army was
set at 80 men. Eighty men to guard 3,000,000 citizens—with
the frontiers pushing forward into the wilderness!
After World War I, Congress established a regular army of
175,000 men, yet failed to appropriate money enough to pay for
such an army.
In the Roosevelt era, although no funds were raised for the
Army, a Civilian Conservation Corps was organized under the
supervision of the Army. This amazing turn of events saw a
517.50-a-month Army private supervising a $30-a-month CCC
boy.
After World War II Congress failed to pass the UMT.
Supposedly Congress was expressing the will of all the people.
The pattern of thought is all too evident—American policy
has been against a large standing army as a danger to democ
racy. Yet the truth is that a lack of a sizeable army is the danger.
There are "incidents" and "powder kegs" and "situations"
that lead to wars according to history books. But in the end,
there is only one thing that prompts a nation to make war upon
another: weakness of the enemy.
Weakness of the United States has been in the philosophy of
hoping to avoid war by isolation, and time and time again the
country has been brought to the brink of war with pitifully
weak defenses.
Our failure in the past to take our proper place in foreign
affairs, our ostrich-like attitudes, which were thought preventives
of war, have actually helped bring the wars. It is true today.
After displaying an initial weakness in Berlin (while the Army
was being demobilized), we have lately stiffened our diplomacy.
But our diplomatic strength would have been 10 times greater
if Congress had passed the UMT, for everyone in the world
friend and foe alike, would have realized that the United States
was still ready to fight for peace.
The "wait until the time comes" attitude is reflected at Stan
ford. Many freshman boys recently backed out of military sci
ence courses, thinking they would not be drafted, so why worry.
iHowever, a recent report from the Secretary of Defense says
that available manpower will be soaked up by the draft next
June and college students will be drafted.) But rather than
preparing themselves as future officers, these students are
willing to wait to see what happens.
The objection to adeguate national defense and universal
-compulsory) training is hard to understand, especially the
objections of university students. Persons of college age spend
13-18 years in school, 12 years of which is compulsory. Yet
they object to spending a year in training to defend then
country—and all they have worked for the 13 to 18 years.
In these days when the world still recognizes power above
treaties and international organizations, we believe the Boy
Scout motto is best, "BE PREPARED."

There are "incidents" and "powder kegs" and "situations"
that lead to wars according to history books. But in the end,
there is only one thing that prompts a nation to make war upon
another: weakness of the enemy.
Weakness of the United States has been in the philosophy of
hoping to avoid war by isolation, and time and time again the
country has been brought to the brink of war with pitifully
weak defenses.
Our failure in the past to take our proper place in foreign
affairs, our ostrich-like attitudes, which were thought preventives
of war, have actually helped bring the wars. It is true today.
After displaying an initial weakness in Berlin (while the Army
was being demobilized), we have lately stiffened our diplomacy.
But our diplomatic strength would have been 10 times greater
if Congress had passed the UMT, for everyone in the world
friend and foe alike, would have realized that the United States
was still ready to fight for peace.
The "wait until the time comes" attitude is reflected at Stan
ford. Many freshman boys recently backed out of military sci
ence courses, thinking they would not be drafted, so why worry.
iHowever, a recent report from the Secretary of Defense says
that available manpower will be soaked up by the draft next
June and college students will be drafted.) But rather than
preparing themselves as future officers, these students are
willing to wait to see what happens.
The objection to adeguate national defense and universal
-compulsory) training is hard to understand, especially the
objections of university students. Persons of college age spend
13-18 years in school, 12 years of which is compulsory. Yet
they object to spending a year in training to defend then
country—and all they have worked for the 13 to 18 years.
In these days when the world still recognizes power above
treaties and international organizations, we believe the Boy
Scout motto is best, "BE PREPARED."
"In order to form a more perfect union .... provide for the
common defense . . . ." reads in part the preamble of the Con
stitution of the United States. In the Constitution Congress is
charged specifically with providing for the defense of the United
States and Congress has done a notoriously poor job of it
throughout the years. Here is the record:
In the post-Revolutionary War period the standing army was
set at 80 men. Eighty men to guard 3,000,000 citizens—with
the frontiers pushing forward into the wilderness!
After World War I, Congress established a regular army of
175,000 men, yet failed to appropriate money enough to pay for
such an army.
In the Roosevelt era, although no funds were raised for the
Army, a Civilian Conservation Corps was organized under the
supervision of the Army. This amazing turn of events saw a
517.50-a-month Army private supervising a $30-a-month CCC
boy.
After World War II Congress failed to pass the UMT.
Supposedly Congress was expressing the will of all the people.
The pattern of thought is all too evident—American policy
has been against a large standing army as a danger to democ
racy. Yet the truth is that a lack of a sizeable army is the danger.
