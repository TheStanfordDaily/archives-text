Every once in a while, some radio poll or syndicated columnist will use
an item about the low mentality of the average radio listener. Their
various estimates of the mental age of the typical listener usually runs
anywhere from 10 to 13 years.
Because the majority of my acquaintances arc of a mental age which
I'm sure is considerably more than 13 years, I have been always quite
dubious of the correctness of the low national average. I was, that is,
until I spent this last summer working on the radio. Now I have nothing
but complete agreement for the experts who have placed the estimated
mental age of radio listeners at about a dozen years.
What changed my mind? Well, here are a few pertinent examples.
Each afternoon on one of our record shows, we would give away free
theater passes to the first person to mail to us the correct answer to
our question about the mystery orchestra leader. On the particular day
in mind, the song we played was "Who," and the mystery orchestra leader
was Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. (Sometimes referred to
as Guy Lumbago and his Boiled Arabians.)
In the mail the next morning we received an answer on a card which
was originally intended as a direct-mail advertisement for Royal Canadian
Whiskey. Here, we thought, was someone who had a little originality.
Instead of sending the name of Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians
on an ordinary postcard, this listener had scouted around the house until
she found a card with the name "Royal Canadian" on it. At least that's
what we thought.
When we turned the card over, we found the following message:
"Dear Sir: The name of yesterday's mystery orchestra leader was
.... Sammy Kaye."
Had enough? Just in case you haven't, we'll throw in the clincher.
In our mail every morning of the three vacation months I worked at
the station, we received a postcard from a woman who always had a
dedication she wanted played for someone. This in itself is not too
unusual, because we got many requests. But we didn't get many letters
like the ones she wrote.
They were always the same, except for the song she would request.
And no matter what song she wanted, it had to be sung by A 1 Jolson,
whose name she didn't quite know. She also didn't quite know the
name of our head disc jockey, a fellow named Gordon Greb. Anyway,
here's her stock letter, and don't blame the linotyper for the mistakes
in spelling:
"Dear Mr. Webs: I am writing to let yow know at I am fine and hope
yow the same. May I have a song for me, "The Wood Peck Song," by
A 1 Jones?"
I wonder where Mitchum gets those cigarettes?

In the mail the next morning we received an answer on a card which
was originally intended as a direct-mail advertisement for Royal Canadian
Whiskey. Here, we thought, was someone who had a little originality.
Instead of sending the name of Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians
on an ordinary postcard, this listener had scouted around the house until
she found a card with the name "Royal Canadian" on it. At least that's
what we thought.
When we turned the card over, we found the following message:
"Dear Sir: The name of yesterday's mystery orchestra leader was
.... Sammy Kaye."
Had enough? Just in case you haven't, we'll throw in the clincher.
In our mail every morning of the three vacation months I worked at
the station, we received a postcard from a woman who always had a
dedication she wanted played for someone. This in itself is not too
unusual, because we got many requests. But we didn't get many letters
like the ones she wrote.
They were always the same, except for the song she would request.
And no matter what song she wanted, it had to be sung by A 1 Jolson,
whose name she didn't quite know. She also didn't quite know the
name of our head disc jockey, a fellow named Gordon Greb. Anyway,
here's her stock letter, and don't blame the linotyper for the mistakes
in spelling:
"Dear Mr. Webs: I am writing to let yow know at I am fine and hope
yow the same. May I have a song for me, "The Wood Peck Song," by
A 1 Jones?"
I wonder where Mitchum gets those cigarettes?
Every once in a while, some radio poll or syndicated columnist will use
an item about the low mentality of the average radio listener. Their
various estimates of the mental age of the typical listener usually runs
anywhere from 10 to 13 years.
Because the majority of my acquaintances arc of a mental age which
I'm sure is considerably more than 13 years, I have been always quite
dubious of the correctness of the low national average. I was, that is,
until I spent this last summer working on the radio. Now I have nothing
but complete agreement for the experts who have placed the estimated
mental age of radio listeners at about a dozen years.
What changed my mind? Well, here are a few pertinent examples.
Each afternoon on one of our record shows, we would give away free
theater passes to the first person to mail to us the correct answer to
our question about the mystery orchestra leader. On the particular day
in mind, the song we played was "Who," and the mystery orchestra leader
was Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. (Sometimes referred to
as Guy Lumbago and his Boiled Arabians.)
