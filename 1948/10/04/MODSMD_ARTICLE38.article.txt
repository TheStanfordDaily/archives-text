### 
"Carousel," the Rodgers and
| Hammerstein musical adaptation of
Ferenc Molnar's "Lilliom," is a
production which hr.s a rare com
bination of drama and music. The
light entertainment of music and
ballet has been adapted to a moving
drama, and the result has brought
praise from audiences throughout
the country.
The message of hope and courage
which Molnar wrote into his play.
"Lilliom," has been transposed into
musical expression. All of the ar
tistic and moral import of the
drama is expressed in the final
scene in which the cast sings the
beautiful song, "You'll Never Walk
Alone."
Still the lightness and humor, ex
pected in a musical show, are also
present. Agnes DeMille's ballet se
quences arc colorful. There is
lightness and comedy in the se
quences centered around such pop
ular songs as "June Is Bustin' Out
All Over."
Above all, thG cast is equal to tin
play. The character of Billy Bil
low, the hero, requires a singer wl
can act. Happily the Theater Guild
has found the right person for tin
part, and his performance is ex
cellent.
One member of the cast, Chris
tine Johnson, has sung with the
Metropolitan Opera. The comedi
enne played in the London per-
I formance of "Oklahoma."
The opening scene, done entirely
{ in pantomime, shows the carnival
I and the carousel and the cast
dressed in the period costumes. The
music for the scene. "The Carousel
Overture," is a full orchestral imi
tation of merry-go-round music.
"Carousel," still playing in San
Francisco, is a show which theater
goers may not sec equaled for
