# Lagunita A-Fair Success Augments European Relief
## 
### 
With a $308.75 tally from the auctions, unofficial estimates of
the total receipts from the Lagunita A-Fair Saturday night run
about $800. This money will be donated to European relief.
B. J. Denning, publicity manager, said today that exact figures
will not be available until tomorrow.
The "A-Fair" brought not only money for CARE packages, but

laughs and remarks. Even Joe
Wiesinger, one of the foreign schol
arship students, was heard to say,
"I'm having a hot time tonight."
Later, semi-serious auctioneer H.
Donald Winbigler had trouble dis
covering the relationship between a
pigskin and a sheepskin as he sold
Iwo coveted footballs signed by
members of the team. Incidentally,
Aubrey Devine signed his name as
"Too Too Devine."
High Bids
Spirited auction bidding provided
thrills for the crowd as two giant
bourbon bottles jumped from open
ing bids of $3 and $1 to $1(5.75 and
$14 in 30 seconds. Sharon Nuss'
decorative totem pole, with the low
man a Cal bear, became an heir
loom for Diane Porter for $21.
Around the outer edge of the
court, decorated booths attracted
many buyers. In one of the end
concessions among the glassware,
ASSU President and Vice - Presi
dent Gus Chavalas and Erline An
derson were busy signing their
names without Excom authoriza
tion.
Loaded Down
Movies, folk dancing, puppets,
and dancing were the "outside" at
tractions. One overburdened girl
was trying, rather unsuccessfully,
to dance with a pot of philoden
dron, a balloon, a Chinese back
scratcher, and her partner.
Ending the hilarious evening, the
funnier record man announced the
last dance, then pulled the main
switch so that the whole dance floor
was ablaze with lights.
Plans for the "A-Fair" were be
gun last spring by Marjo Langrell,
Nancy Williams, Jody Johnson, and
Lisa Painter.

was trying, rather unsuccessfully,
to dance with a pot of philoden
dron, a balloon, a Chinese back
scratcher, and her partner.

was ablaze with lights.
Plans for the "A-Fair" were be

Nancy Williams, Jody Johnson, and
Lisa Painter.
