# Night Assistant Fees Canceled for Women
## 
### 
It won't cost Stanford women
50 cents per quarter to stay out
until 2:110 a.m. on weekend leaves,
Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton announced yesterday.
When Hie University first
granted 2:3ft's to Farm coeds, a
stipulation was made that the
women had to help pay a part of
the cost of keeping night assist
ants in the halls until the later
hour.
During recent years the policy
has been limited to those women
residing in living units housing
more than 50 women.
