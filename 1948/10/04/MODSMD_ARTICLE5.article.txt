# Plane Crash Kills Stanford Grad
## 
### 
An August plane crash took the
life of Albert S. Price, June, 1948,
graduate from the School of Bio
logical Sciences.
Price enlisted for active duty
with the Air Corps this summer
and was checking out training
planes before they were turned
over to new pilots. One of these
planes he piloted went into a spin
near Randolph Field, Texas, and
Price was unable to bail out.
During the war Price flew in
active combat for the Air Corps.
He was assistant head hasher at
Lagunita last year at Stanford.
