# Frosh Run Wild in Debut; Blast Mountaineers 38 to 7
## 
### JIM PALMIERI 
Coach Chuck Taylor had to keep his first string in the ball
game almost six minutes Saturday afternoon at the Stadium to
blast a pitifully weak Mt. San Antonio JC eleven, 38-7.
From the first moment the Cardbabes got their hands on the
ball it was apparent that the game was to be "no contest." Ac-

tually, it was the second moment.
The Mountainers received the kick
off, ran a series of plays, were pe
nalized, and kicked to Eric South
wood who ran it back to the mid
field stripe on the first of his cross
country jaunts of the afternoon.
Then, on the locals' first play from
scrimmage, Marv Mellaway, start
ing fullback, broke over left guard,
and the only man who touched him
in his sprint to the goal was an
other Indian babe whom he bumped
into and shook hands with in the
secondary. From that moment on
the spectators clustered around
their portable radios and looked up
periodically.
Radford Tries Hard
Except for a couple of halfbacks
named Bob, the San Antonio play
ers were just a bunch of guys
named .Joe. Bob Radford was the
only back in a white jersey who
semed convinced of the fact that
it's necessary to advance the ball
toward the opponents' goal in order
to score, and Bob Phillips made the
crowd sit up, at least, with a couple
of beautiful leaping passes which
his receivers had to make a real
effort to drop. It's difficult to com
ment on the San Antonio line—ev
eryone saw them line up for the
kickoff, but where they went or
what they did afterward, nobody
knows.
55-Yard Run
A review of the Cardbabes' scor
ing efforts following Mellaway's in
itial TD goes like this:
Again the Mountaineers received
the kickoff, ran a series of plays,
got nowhere, and kicked. Squth
woocl ran it back 12 to the Stanford
34, waited long enough for a pint
sized battering ram by the name of
Chuck Brazel to crack for a first
down on the 45, then took the ball
inside end and, with the aid of a
nice downfield block by Captain
Jess Cone, went 55 yards to the
score. End Bill McColl's kick for
point was good. Score, 10-0.
Rye Intercepts Pass
The start of the second quarter
saw San Antonio fox fhe yearlings
by attempting to pass off a punt
formation from deep in their own
end zone. End John Rye promptly
intercepted and stepped over for
(he score. McColl's kick was again
good. Score, 20-0.
Dick Leonard and Rod Lippold. a
couple of Taylor's reserve backs,
looked good in moving the ball
from midfie'd to the goal. Quarter
back Harry Hugasian, who filled in
more than adequately for injured
Gary Kcrkorian and Dick Horn,
had his kick for point blocked.
Score, 2fi-0 at the end of the half.
Ilugasion to McColl
A Southwood interception set up
Stanford's fifth score. Two 15-yard
penalties failed to faze the boys and
Hugasian passed 35 yards to McColl
who took it on the goal line. Guard
Owen Powell's kick was not good.
Score, 32-0.
This time it was reserve half
Dean Shepard who swivelhipped
over from the 20 after Stanford had
recovered a San Antonio fumble.
Score. 38-0.
In the fourth quarter, the Moun
taineers finally moved against Tay
lor's third- and fourth-stringers.
Two long passes gave them the ball
on the Card 10, from where Rad
ford took it over for their only
score. The kick was good, and the
game ended 38-7.
Captain Jess Cone and his fellow
guard Joe Jacobs, tackle Chuck
Hokanson who did some beautiful
downfield blocking, and ends Mc-
Coll and Wilbur Taylor led the
hard-charging frosh forwards. There
wasn't a back on the frosh bench
who didn't look like an Ail-Ameri
can sometime during the game.
According to Taylor and line
coach Dick Madigan, the game
proved nothing except that the
frosh want to play football how
well they can play remains to be
seen.

55-Yard Run
A review of the Cardbabes' scor
ing efforts following Mellaway's in
itial TD goes like this:
Again the Mountaineers received
the kickoff, ran a series of plays,
got nowhere, and kicked. Squth
woocl ran it back 12 to the Stanford
34, waited long enough for a pint
sized battering ram by the name of
Chuck Brazel to crack for a first
down on the 45, then took the ball
inside end and, with the aid of a
nice downfield block by Captain
Jess Cone, went 55 yards to the
score. End Bill McColl's kick for
point was good. Score, 10-0.
Rye Intercepts Pass
The start of the second quarter
saw San Antonio fox fhe yearlings
by attempting to pass off a punt
formation from deep in their own
end zone. End John Rye promptly
intercepted and stepped over for
(he score. McColl's kick was again
good. Score, 20-0.
Dick Leonard and Rod Lippold. a
couple of Taylor's reserve backs,
looked good in moving the ball
from midfie'd to the goal. Quarter
back Harry Hugasian, who filled in
more than adequately for injured
Gary Kcrkorian and Dick Horn,
had his kick for point blocked.
Score, 2fi-0 at the end of the half.
Ilugasion to McColl
A Southwood interception set up
Stanford's fifth score. Two 15-yard
penalties failed to faze the boys and
Hugasian passed 35 yards to McColl
who took it on the goal line. Guard
Owen Powell's kick was not good.
Score, 32-0.
This time it was reserve half
Dean Shepard who swivelhipped
over from the 20 after Stanford had
recovered a San Antonio fumble.
Score. 38-0.
In the fourth quarter, the Moun
taineers finally moved against Tay
lor's third- and fourth-stringers.
Two long passes gave them the ball
on the Card 10, from where Rad
ford took it over for their only
score. The kick was good, and the
game ended 38-7.
Captain Jess Cone and his fellow
guard Joe Jacobs, tackle Chuck
Hokanson who did some beautiful
downfield blocking, and ends Mc-
Coll and Wilbur Taylor led the
hard-charging frosh forwards. There
wasn't a back on the frosh bench
who didn't look like an Ail-Ameri
can sometime during the game.
According to Taylor and line
coach Dick Madigan, the game
proved nothing except that the
frosh want to play football how
well they can play remains to be
seen.
Coach Chuck Taylor had to keep his first string in the ball
game almost six minutes Saturday afternoon at the Stadium to
blast a pitifully weak Mt. San Antonio JC eleven, 38-7.
From the first moment the Cardbabes got their hands on the
ball it was apparent that the game was to be "no contest." Ac-

tually, it was the second moment.
The Mountainers received the kick
off, ran a series of plays, were pe
nalized, and kicked to Eric South
wood who ran it back to the mid
field stripe on the first of his cross
country jaunts of the afternoon.
Then, on the locals' first play from
scrimmage, Marv Mellaway, start
ing fullback, broke over left guard,
and the only man who touched him
in his sprint to the goal was an
other Indian babe whom he bumped
into and shook hands with in the
secondary. From that moment on
the spectators clustered around
their portable radios and looked up
periodically.
Radford Tries Hard
Except for a couple of halfbacks
named Bob, the San Antonio play
ers were just a bunch of guys
named .Joe. Bob Radford was the
only back in a white jersey who
semed convinced of the fact that
it's necessary to advance the ball
toward the opponents' goal in order
to score, and Bob Phillips made the
crowd sit up, at least, with a couple
of beautiful leaping passes which
his receivers had to make a real
effort to drop. It's difficult to com
ment on the San Antonio line—ev
eryone saw them line up for the
kickoff, but where they went or
what they did afterward, nobody
knows.

Owen Powell's kick was not good.
Score, 32-0.
This time it was reserve half
Dean Shepard who swivelhipped
over from the 20 after Stanford had
recovered a San Antonio fumble.
Score. 38-0.
In the fourth quarter, the Moun
taineers finally moved against Tay
lor's third- and fourth-stringers.
Two long passes gave them the ball
on the Card 10, from where Rad
ford took it over for their only
score. The kick was good, and the
game ended 38-7.
Captain Jess Cone and his fellow
guard Joe Jacobs, tackle Chuck
Hokanson who did some beautiful
downfield blocking, and ends Mc-
Coll and Wilbur Taylor led the
hard-charging frosh forwards. There
wasn't a back on the frosh bench
who didn't look like an Ail-Ameri
can sometime during the game.
According to Taylor and line
coach Dick Madigan, the game
proved nothing except that the
frosh want to play football how
well they can play remains to be
seen.
Coach Chuck Taylor had to keep his first string in the ball
game almost six minutes Saturday afternoon at the Stadium to
blast a pitifully weak Mt. San Antonio JC eleven, 38-7.
From the first moment the Cardbabes got their hands on the
ball it was apparent that the game was to be "no contest." Ac-

tually, it was the second moment.
The Mountainers received the kick
off, ran a series of plays, were pe
nalized, and kicked to Eric South
wood who ran it back to the mid
field stripe on the first of his cross
country jaunts of the afternoon.
Then, on the locals' first play from
scrimmage, Marv Mellaway, start
ing fullback, broke over left guard,
and the only man who touched him
in his sprint to the goal was an
other Indian babe whom he bumped
into and shook hands with in the
secondary. From that moment on
the spectators clustered around
their portable radios and looked up
periodically.
Radford Tries Hard
Except for a couple of halfbacks
named Bob, the San Antonio play
ers were just a bunch of guys
named .Joe. Bob Radford was the
only back in a white jersey who
semed convinced of the fact that
it's necessary to advance the ball
toward the opponents' goal in order
to score, and Bob Phillips made the
crowd sit up, at least, with a couple
of beautiful leaping passes which
his receivers had to make a real
effort to drop. It's difficult to com
ment on the San Antonio line—ev
eryone saw them line up for the
kickoff, but where they went or
what they did afterward, nobody
knows.
55-Yard Run
A review of the Cardbabes' scor
ing efforts following Mellaway's in
itial TD goes like this:
Again the Mountaineers received
the kickoff, ran a series of plays,
got nowhere, and kicked. Squth
woocl ran it back 12 to the Stanford
34, waited long enough for a pint
sized battering ram by the name of
Chuck Brazel to crack for a first
down on the 45, then took the ball
inside end and, with the aid of a
nice downfield block by Captain
Jess Cone, went 55 yards to the
score. End Bill McColl's kick for
point was good. Score, 10-0.
Rye Intercepts Pass
The start of the second quarter
saw San Antonio fox fhe yearlings
by attempting to pass off a punt
formation from deep in their own
end zone. End John Rye promptly
intercepted and stepped over for
(he score. McColl's kick was again
good. Score, 20-0.
Dick Leonard and Rod Lippold. a
couple of Taylor's reserve backs,
looked good in moving the ball
from midfie'd to the goal. Quarter
back Harry Hugasian, who filled in
more than adequately for injured
Gary Kcrkorian and Dick Horn,
had his kick for point blocked.
Score, 2fi-0 at the end of the half.
Ilugasion to McColl
A Southwood interception set up
Stanford's fifth score. Two 15-yard
penalties failed to faze the boys and
Hugasian passed 35 yards to McColl
who took it on the goal line. Guard
Owen Powell's kick was not good.
Score, 32-0.
This time it was reserve half
Dean Shepard who swivelhipped
over from the 20 after Stanford had
recovered a San Antonio fumble.
Score. 38-0.
In the fourth quarter, the Moun

lor's third- and fourth-stringers.
