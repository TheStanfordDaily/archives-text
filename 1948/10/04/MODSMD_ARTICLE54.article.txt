inning of yesterday's Boston-New
York game. Never will a single one
of the 31,354 Boston fans forget the
tingling excitement of the word-of
niouth report from portable radio
fans that a Tiger rally was in prog
ress at Cleveland.
When New York got after Joe
Dobson in the fifth to pull up close,
5 to 4 on a second double by Joe
DiMaggio that was good for two
runs, McCarthy lifted the usually
reliable Dobson and brought in
lefty Earl Johnson, the eventual
winner.
DiMaggio Gets Four Hits
It would have been no "contest all
the way if it hadn't been for Joe
DiMaggio. Limping along with a
bad charley horse, he rapped out
four hits, two of them doubles.
When he left the game for a pinch
runner in the ninth, the crowd gave
him a tremendous ovation.
The Cleveland Indians, needing
a victory for themselves or a defeat
for Boston, missed out on both
ends.
Bob Feller, Cleveland's ace pitch
er. started yesterday's game, but
didn't linger long as the Tigers

belted hirh oui. with a four-run
splurge with one out in the third
inning.
Meanwhile, Newhouser rolled on
to his 21st win of the season and
his second win in nine starts
against Feller. He was never in
trouble and had a shutout until two
were out in the ninth when Joe
Gordon singled to send home Allie
Clark from second. Until the ninth
when Clark and Gordon singled,
Newhouser had a brilliant three
hitter.
Crowd Leaves Early
The Indians were so futile against
the lefthanded slants of Newhouser
that a larg part of the huge crowd
of 74,181 fans began to file out in
the seventh inning.
Boudreau said: "You got to give
all the credit in the world to New
houser. This was one of the few
times this year we were never in
the ball game. Newhouser is the
greatest lefthander in baseball to
day. We can look at a lefthander in
Boston today, but he won't be a
Newhouser."
Either righthander Ellis Kinder
(10-7) or rookie lefthander Mel
Parnell (15-8) is scheduled to pitch
for Boston today. Cleveland man
ager Lou Boudreau said he would
n't announce his startinig pitcher
until game time. Bob Feller or Bob
Lemon is expected to get the call.
