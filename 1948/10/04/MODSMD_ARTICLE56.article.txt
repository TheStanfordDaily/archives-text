## THE
						FRONT ROW 
### 
Aw hell, men, I dunno what's the matter. Just when you get to thinking
that the old machine is going to get rolling again, it does a complete
fizzle. A Palouse-country el foldo.
All of which is a discouraging note. I hate to think of having to spend
another Autumn filled with dejected Saturday nights. But the future
doesn't offer very much promise what with Santa Clara, UCLA, USC,
Washington, and Army coming up on consecutive weekends.
Still, Schwartz might get the buggy running yet. The Oregon game
showed us that the spark was there. Whether the spark is going to flare
up or die out is another question.
At any rate, you hafta give the gridders more credit than that Cougar
conscious radio announcer gave them for Saturday's work. Any team
that grinds out 231 yards of rushing, and doesn't quit fitting until the
final gun, deserves some type of praise.
Frosh Even the Score
One" brightening aspect of the otherwise dismal football picture was
the dazzling power displayed by the Freshmen last Saturday in the
Stadium where they blasted their way to a 38 to 6 win over a logy, but
supposedly more experienced squad from Mt. San Antonio Junior College.
Man, those frosh can really rock-'em-and-sock-'em. Fullback Charlie
Brazel hits like a sack of cement. And Bill McColl, rugged end from
San Diego, proved himself to be as good as his press notices. Broken
field flashes Marv Melloway and Eric Southwood looked plenty potent
in crashing through the secondary.
Smiling Chuck Taylor has stated that his 1948 Frosh squad (class of '52)
is one ol the best in Stanford history. And as yet, there's no reason to
doubt him. His boys have drive, ability, and the desire to go places.
It Slioulda Rained
Baseball managed to steal back a little limelight from Fall's favorite
child football yesterday, as the American League Cleveland Indians
choked on the left-handed slants of Hal Newhouser, to drop back into
a season-closing tie with Boston.
If it had rained—as the weatherman had predicted for Detroit—
Cleveland could have won the pennant without playing another game.
But now Bob Hope's boys must invade Boston's Fenway Park to do it
the hard way. And I don't think Feller or Lemon or Gromek has the
stuff to do it.
One more blast before you get out of the Front Row today. West Coast
football took another Big Nine whip lashing last Saturday. If much more
of this thing keeps happening, the Rose Bowl is going to pack about
as much punch as the Chicago -Cubs.
Maybe California can do something about it next Saturday. The Bears
tackle Wisconsin, one of the 1948 big guns in the Big Nine.
WSC Sod Is Soli
John Breier, just off the plane from covering the football game Satur
day, says the ride was nice, the hotels easy to take, and that"the playing
field was the best in-the West (besides Stanford). Heretofore, the North
ern football fields have been held in ill repute, but since Oregon State
recently put in a complete new sod in their stadium, and the city of Port
land did the same to Multnomah Field, things are improved.
No doubt the reason behind this is the fact that the people in the North
would like to lure the Southern teams into their territory a little more
often.
