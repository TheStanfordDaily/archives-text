# Agency Set For Signups
## 
### 
Ya say you're not important on (
de ole Farm? Ya want to be a
woo-woo goil, or a BMOC? Does
your roommate think you're an
ickey? The Stanford Activities
Agency is aIL set to fix you upâ€”
both old and new students. They
can place you in clubs and organi
zations.
Office houi's, as announced by
Hardin Holmes, Agency co-chair
man, have been set daily from 3 to
5 p.m. in the Interfraternity Coun
cil office in the Union.
'During these hours," Holmes
stated, "anyone interested can come
in and let us help him make the
necessary arrangements with the
desired activity group."
Holmes said that activities cards,
recording the extra-curricular in
terests of the students, have been
issued to the freshmen and will
soon be distributed among the re
maining living groups, including
the Village.
These cards are catalogued in
the Agency office and can be re
ferred to when an organization
calls up and expresses a desire for
some new members. Getting a list
of those who seem to prefer the
kind of work it does, the organiza
tion then sends post cards to these |
pconle inviting them to join.
"However," Holmes said, "one '
does not have to fill out a card to
join an activity. An active desire
to enter a group on campus is
enough to qualify you for member
ship."
Because activities cards will not
be distributed to off-campus stu
dents, Holmes mired them to come
to the Agency office in person that
they may fill out cards or make
arrangements to enroll directly in
an activity.
The Activities Agency exists as a j
separate unit under Cardinals, j
whose job it is to promote and co
ordinate all campus activities. Co- j
chairmen of the Agency are Holmes I
and Miss Nan Shepherd, and office
manager is Joanne Briggs.
