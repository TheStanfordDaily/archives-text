# Lawson Appeals to High Court in Contempt Case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 4 (/P), —
Jol in Howard Lawson, Hollywood
movie writer, carried an appeal to
the Supreme Court today against
his conviction for contempt of Con
gress.
Lawson's petition, filed as the
Justices met for the start of their
iall term, challenged both the au
thority and the methods of the
House Committee on Un-American
Activities.
"No organ of our government,
unless perhaps a military tribunal
within sound of battle, has ever laid
claim to such powers," the petition
said.
Lawson was convicted following
his refusal to tell the House com
mittee whether he is or ever has
been a Communist. He is a former
president of the Screen Waiters'
Guild and author of such screen
plays as "Algiers," "Smashup" and
"Blockade."
Lawson argued that the commit
tee's operations threaten all forms
of public expression, including
church and school, and menace the
"very existence as free men" of
citizens who will not willingly sub
mit to invasion of their constitu
tional rights.
There was no assurance that
Lawson would get a high court

hearing at this time. He was trying
to by-pass the Court of Appeals,
where the case is now pending, and
get an immediate ruling from the
highest bench. The Supreme Court
will first decide whether it wants
to take over before the internie
diaite court has had its say.
