# Political Band Wagon Rolls On
## 
### Associated Press 
Senator Vandenberg (R., Mich.),
in a major speech for the Republi
cans, said last night that America's
bi - partisan foreign policy leaves
the voters "free to change our na
tional administration."
If the voters want to throw out
the Democrats and put in Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey as President, lit
said, they can do so "without af
fecting the continuity of our for
eign policy."
Vandenberg callgd his speech a
report on the Republican position
"in beh-tli' of national unity at the
water's edge." It came as Dewey
and President Truman both weiv
described as happy and optimistic
over the cross-country campaign
tours they ended last week.
Vandenberg. chairman of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee,
did not actually come out and ask
the voters to change administra
tions. But he made plain his beliel
that it would be entirely safe. He
cited "the Republican record or
clear, vigorous, competent and con
structive achievement in this vital
cause of world peace."
Proudly Vandenberg recited what
he termed the unanimity of his own
Senate committee and the bi-parti
san efforts of both Republicans and
Democrats in the interests of
America as a whole. And. with a
diplomatic slap at Mr. Truman, he
said:
"When history is written, the
80th Congress will be remembered
for this record in foreign relations
!ong after other relatively transient
issues have been forgotten."
The report that President Tru
man was "very optimistic" came
from White House Press Secretary
Charles G. Ross. Mr. Truman
passed along word from Democratic
Chairman McGrath that the Presi
dent's tour has "done the cause a
tremendous amount of good."
"We don't need a new President
in this country," said Whitney. "We
need a new Congress."
The report of a calmly confident
Dewey came from aides at Albany.
They described as GOP nominee as
so sure of winning the Presidency
hat he plans to campaign just as
he has been doing. Republican-,
call this method "conducting a
campaign on a high level"; Demo
crats call it "dodging specific issues
to deal with generalities only."
Dewey is to give further empha
sis to foreign affairs today. His
chief foreign adviser, John Foster
Dulles, flew home from Paris at
Dewey's request to give him a fill
in on the United Nations meeting.
Henry A. Wallace, campaigning
in California for President on th
Progressive party picket, had one
speech date scratched. Officials ot
Fresno State College canceled a
campus meeting at which Wallas
was to have appeared, because it
was feared that demonstration
might take place.
