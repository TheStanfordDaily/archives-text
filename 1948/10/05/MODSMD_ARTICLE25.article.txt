## 
### 
Today is the day for all Encina
; men whose last names start from
|E to K to have their pictures taken
at the Quad office. Wednesday is
set aside for L to R, and Thursday
for S through Z. All those who
couldn't make it on their assigned
days may get their picture taken
on Friday.
These pictures are being used in
the Frosh Book, which will be dis
tributed by the middle of Novem
ber. Freshmen who have their pic
tures taken must pay $L and then
must hand out $1 more if they
want the book.
"Men should be dressed with tie,
coat, and anything else which they
might need to walk over to the
Quad officc," so saith Quad Editor
Ted Off.
