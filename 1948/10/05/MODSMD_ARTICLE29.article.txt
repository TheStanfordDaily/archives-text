## Right Is NOT Might 
### 
The editorial "National Defense" admittedly was written par
tially to draw fire. We wanted to examine sentiment about UMT
for one thing, principally because Congress may act on the
issue at the next session.
After re-reading the editorial, along with the letters to the
editor in reply, our position on national defense remains unalter
ableâ€”force is still the most respected factor in world affairs, and
will continue so for some time.
"Right is Might" is a pretty sentiment. But who's going to
tell Joe? Moral force carries little weight without the physical
force to back it. And it can hardly be argued that the U.S. is
preparing to fight a war of aggression.
Universal Service need not mean the calling up of huge num
bers of troops. Rather, the greatest good it would provoke would
be a better respect for democracy. That is, it would signalize
our willingness (intention) to keep peace by force if necessary.
But why the cry against universal service? It was an early
axiom that each citizen should be responsible for the defense of
his country. Universal service would certainly stimulate a little
thought about national defense and national problems. Espe
cially among those who have the idea that the country owes
them a living, and forget that the reverse is true also.
Far from creating a nation of war-mongers and militarists,
Universal Service would make the youth of the country con
scious of the need to keep peace. Few veterans want to fight
again. At the same time, few of them want to see the nation
in a state of unpreparedness.
When it is practicable, we advocate the disarming of all na
tions. By all means. Power to enforce international agreements
should be lodged in the United Nations. But until it is feasible,
the U.S., as one of the two strongest members of the UN, should
remain strong. Otherwise our moral force will not be very
persuasive with Stalin and the Communists.
In a way we sympathize with the writers of the letters at
tacking our strong stand on national defense. Even we were
pacifists in 1941. And we thought it was cute when people
said they'd learn to speak German when Hitler's gang took over.
But we spent most of the first two years of war in the Pacific
playing hide and seek with the enemy because of lack of strength.
And it stung our American pride.
