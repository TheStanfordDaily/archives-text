YOU ARE STANFORD:
If .... on Monday you swear that you'll never take out another
blind date, and then spend the next Thursday night trying to talk your
roommate into fixing you up with that freshman girl from his home town—
If ... . you cut one of your courses for most of the quarter, study hard
the night before the final, and moan because you only got a "C" for a
fir.al grade—
If .... as you go to the post office with your regular weekly letter
to the folks, you wonder why you don't hear from your mother more
regularly than every other day—
If ... . you go out on a date and invariably get your girl to the door
of her house approximately 30 seconds before the lockout deadline—
If ... . you gripe because you are required to take Western Civ, and
:hen spend half of the night arguing a point of religion or philosophy
with your roommate—
If ... . the name and description on your I.D. bears absolutely no
resemblance to you .... (Why? Well, because it doesn't belong to you,
silly!)—
If ... . at 8:50 a.m. you repeat that old wheeze about "nine out of 10
girls being beautiful . . . ~" and then at 8:55, you walk down the Quad
looking at the "Tenth Ones,'' and wonder where all the cute girls have
come from—
If .... at least once during your college career, you try (usually in
vain) to enroll in a snap class that is explicitly described in the Announce
ment of Courses as being offered only to a certain group of students,
which does not include you—
If ... . you curse the school in general and the football team in par
ticular from 2:30 to 5.15 on a tough Saturday afternoon, and then at 5:16
have trouble singing the Stanford Hymn because the words are having
trouble getting around that lump in your throat—
If ... . you make a practice of deploring the lack of social activities
on campus and then at the end of 'the quarter excuse yourself for your
poor grades by saying: "I guess I went to a few too many parties—
If ... . you need at least three changes of program before you finally
get settled down for a quarter of study—
If ... . you invariably forget about the sharp turn at the bridge on
the way to Rossitti's—
If all the frailties sound familiar, it's only natural because they're you
and they're Stanford. And, as we said at the beginning. YOU ARE
STANFORD.

If ... . at 8:50 a.m. you repeat that old wheeze about "nine out of 10
girls being beautiful . . . ~" and then at 8:55, you walk down the Quad

have trouble singing the Stanford Hymn because the words are having
trouble getting around that lump in your throat—

roommate into fixing you up with that freshman girl from his home town—
If ... . you cut one of your courses for most of the quarter, study hard
the night before the final, and moan because you only got a "C" for a
fir.al grade—
If .... as you go to the post office with your regular weekly letter
to the folks, you wonder why you don't hear from your mother more
regularly than every other day—
