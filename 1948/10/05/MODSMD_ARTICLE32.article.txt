## Dear Mom- 
### 
! Dear Mom:
Having survied the first week of
! University classes, I have begun to
realize that the jump from high
school to college is pretty big.
Perhaps the biggest jump has
been in regard to study habits. The
preparations here on the Farm are
more than just a glance or two at
a book. That story about spending
three hours of study for one hour
of class wasn't so far wrong. A look
at my preparations for tomorrow
illustrates what I mean—so pages
of Western Civ, two chapters of Be
ginning Spanish, 35 pages of Biol
ogy, and a 500-word composition
for English.
Probably the most different
i course from any that I'd had be-
I fore is Western Civ. It's a combi
] nation of religion, politics, gcogra
j phy, philosophy, art, music, litera
| ture, medicine, and economics—all
i thrown into a period extending
I from the early Greeks to the stock
j market crash. The department isn't
[ satisfied with requiring one easily
| understood text. They also must
j furnish about 30 original source
readings from which the student is
j supposed to concoct his own histor
| ical theories.
I must say that Stanford's classes
J are, on the whole, better systema
| tized than those of most other large
j colleges. Instead of furnishing one
| professor who lectures to some 500
! at a time for five days in the week,
the Farm uses a section system in
which individual instructors teach
small classes of 30 or 40. More in
dividual help is the result.
One of the interesting classroom
j trends thus far has been the man-
I ner in which the profs address us.
J I have acquired four different titles.
| The women profs rathev politely
! coll me Mr. Brown; in the other
J classes, I'm Senor Brown, Brown,
! and "you in the dirty lab coat."
Some of the football players are
known as Jim, Phil, and Ted. They
also are the ones who pull down
the B's.
I've noticed several differences
between a college prof and a high
j school teacher. The latter takes
the text strictly for its word. The
; former takes the words of the text,
j all of which he disproves. Then he
j creatcs the equivalent of a new text
i in his own words. That's the result
of a week of classes, Mom. So long
for now.

PETE
! Dear Mom:
Having survied the first week of
! University classes, I have begun to
realize that the jump from high
school to college is pretty big.
Perhaps the biggest jump has
been in regard to study habits. The
preparations here on the Farm are
more than just a glance or two at
a book. That story about spending
three hours of study for one hour
of class wasn't so far wrong. A look
at my preparations for tomorrow
illustrates what I mean—so pages
of Western Civ, two chapters of Be
ginning Spanish, 35 pages of Biol
ogy, and a 500-word composition
for English.
Probably the most different
i course from any that I'd had be-
I fore is Western Civ. It's a combi
] nation of religion, politics, gcogra
j phy, philosophy, art, music, litera
| ture, medicine, and economics—all
i thrown into a period extending
I from the early Greeks to the stock
j market crash. The department isn't
[ satisfied with requiring one easily
| understood text. They also must
j furnish about 30 original source
readings from which the student is
j supposed to concoct his own histor
| ical theories.
I must say that Stanford's classes
J are, on the whole, better systema
| tized than those of most other large
j colleges. Instead of furnishing one
| professor who lectures to some 500
! at a time for five days in the week,
the Farm uses a section system in
which individual instructors teach
small classes of 30 or 40. More in
