### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 4 (/P).—Alpha
Chi Sigma pledges relaxed to
day. The fraternity president,
whom they had stripped, tied up in
a blanket and smuggled onto an
outbound train, is quite safe. lie
even enjoyed the trip.
The underclassmen staged their
prank Saturday night, and began
to worry yesterday when the vic
tim, Gibson M. Gray, 23, hadn't
been heard from. Today, though,
he returned to classes and explained
all:
Police in Bakersfield, tipped in
advance by the pledges, unwrap
ped and clothed Gray. And he, hap
py to learn of his nearness to Los
Angeles, proceeded to go there.
After all, he said, he knew a very
nice girl there. But he did make
sure nobody told the pledges any
thing; they just sat and feared the
worst.
Upperclassmen said today the
worst is yet to come — for the
pledges.
