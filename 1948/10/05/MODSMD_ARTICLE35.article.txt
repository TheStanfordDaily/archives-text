To the Editor;
Everybody thought that the prac
tice of peacetime conscription in
Germany and Japan was wrong,
and for years Americans de
nounced these nations as militaris
tic. When the Allies finally defeat
ed these nations in battle, one of
their first actions was the outlaw
ing of all forms of military service
as being "incompatible with the
teaching of democracy." Now, nu
merous Americans, including, un
fortunately, our own Daily editors,
have succeeded in securing the
adoption of a similar program in
the United States — the Selective
Service Act of 1948. And they de
mand more!
This, on the grounds that we
must be prepared to fight for peace.
If there is any lesson that history
teaches us, it is that the nation that
is prepared for war shall surely find
war. The statement that "armed
power is pcace power" is so much
poppycock. If the nation were sin
cere in its statements that the war
materials would not he used for
war, then certainly no nation would
fear them anyway. If they are not
sincere, then they involve them
selves in the paradox of preparing
to wage war in order to prevent
war.
Conscription is unilateral action,
anil thus threatens the UN and all
efforts toward world co-operation.
Yet these are the areas where ef
fective work must be done if we
are to have peace.
Conscription arouses the suspi
cions of all nations, provoking them
into competitive armaments and
hostile camps. Out of such a situ
ation war and war alone can de
velop.
In this age of atomic and bacte
riological warfare, civilization can
not afford to embroil itself in an
other world-wide conflagration.
