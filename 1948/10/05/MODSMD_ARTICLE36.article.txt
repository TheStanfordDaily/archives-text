# NO MILITARY DEFENSE
## 
### 
After having come to this Uni
versity to escape the incredible
thoughtlessness of the average life
in America, it is a great personal
blow to me to encounter the colos
sal ignorance and unbelievable stu
pidity displayed by the Daily edi
torial of Oct. 4 at this center of
supposed intelligence and learning.
If there is anything which the
tragic political history of the post-
Renaissance period shows us, it is
that "fighting power" is NOT
"peace power,'' but rather that such
power often makes peace impos
sible by promoting an unending ar
mament race among nations. We
need not look far in history for evi
dence. The fact that every country
in Europe, except tiny Luxem
bourg, had peacetime conscription
did not prevent Hitler from attack
ing the conscript armies of Poland,
conscript France, the conscript ar
mies of the Low Countries, or the
conscript army of Russia. In a pe
riod of atomic bombs, guided mis
siles, and bacteriological warfare,
Universal Military Training and
Selective Service make the ridicu
lous Maginot Line of pre - war
France seem modern.
There is no military defense from
the modern weapons of warfare.
The destruction of our civilization
can be avoided only by the estab
lishment of a constructive pcace
which will eliminate the incentive
to use these weapons. Leadership
in establishing such a peace cannot
be taken by a nation whose youth
are continually being subjected to
military indoctrination and whose
energies are continually being
spent on preparation for war.
