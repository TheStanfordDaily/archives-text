# LET US HOPE

To the Editor:
I believe that I must take par
tial issue with your editorial on
national defense. I agree that we
have been inadequately prepared
for war in the past and that we
must take immediate steps to cope
, with a possible war in the near fu
i ture. I disagree, however, with
your belief that WMT and the draft
offer adequate or even good prepa
ration for a future war.
Arguments for UMT usually fol
low the pattern: We are in grave
dangerof war; therefore, we should
adopt UMT. To be valid, they
should follow the pattern: We are
I in danger of war. UMT offers the

best or a very good means of pro
paring for (hat emergency. There
lore, we should have UMT. It is
my belief that UMT does NOT oiler
the best or a very good means of
preparing for the type of war we
might be fighting.
In the first place, the next war
will have to be a swift atomic war.
No nation would dare to attack us
with less than modern atomic
weapons, because it could antici
pate no less than immediate atomic
reprisal. For the same reason, the
aggressor's plan of attack would be
to demolish our government, indus
tries, concentrated military instal
lations, and large metropolitan
areas before effective retaliation
could be brought to bear on its own
facilities fof waging war. We would
have no time to mobilize and equip
civilian reserves, regardless of
whether or not they had received
primary training in UMT. Our only
hope for survival would rest in im
mediate defensive retaliation and
enemy interception by highly
trained military regulars wielding
the latest in atomic and other types
of weapons.
Some-defenders of UMT maintain
that trainees would be used to
combat the aggressor's occupying
ground forces after the initial atom
ic blitz. But how could they offer
immediate resistance if the facto
ries and railroads that supply them
and the government that mobilizes
them are disabled by that blitz?
Others hold that the trainees
would organize first aid and disas
ter relief groups in their own com
munities. Couldn't they be trained
for this in their communities and
schools, without the necessity of an
expnsive UMT program? Many
UMT proponents suggest that ap
preciation of democracy, respect for
authority, and vigilance will be
taught the trainees. Isn't this,
again, a job for home and school?
UMT offers us little security in
the event of war. Wouldn't it be
better to channel the large appro
priations for such a program into
atomic and defensive weapon re
search. equipping and training of a
well-paid, technically skilled pro
fessional military force, and schol
arships for promising students in
technical and medical fields? Mean
while, let's hope that our efforts to
maintain peace meet with better
success than they have in Ihe near
past. No one "wins" an atomic war.
CAROL M. NEWTON
(Reader Newton has a point.
Universal Training could be oth
er than military. But the General
Staflf will probably be aina/ed at
her understanding of currently
acceptable military tactics. It is
generally believed that no one
"wins" any war!â€” Ed.)
