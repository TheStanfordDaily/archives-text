# SEX FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We strongly protest "Carmen.''
the forthcoming attraction at one
of the Menlo Park theaters. This
picture is described as "vibrantly
sexual," "burning with savage, ani
mal passions," and '"filled with
fiery, untamed lusts," unleashed in
all the manifestations of the life li
bidinous. This strikes us as bcinu'
naughty.
The management, convinced that
the tastes of Menlo theater-goei
favor the basest levels of lecherous
display, gloatingly promises noth
ing "Pollyanna-ish" about the sex
ual charms of Miss Vivian Ro
mance, the star of this vehicle. We
do not doubt that Miss Romance s
throbbing, undulating torso will not
be confused with that of Little Or
phan Annie. In fact, Bizet may
even have his day.
But is Miss Romance, writhing in
all her orgiastic frenzy, the spec
tacle to force before the impres
sionable eyes of our children and
housewives? No, no! we cry!
We urge that The Stanford Daily
launch a vigorous campaign to pre
vent the exhibition of this morally
corrupting motion picture in Menlo
Park. Instead, bring it to the Me
morial Theater as one of the regu
lar Sunday evening featuresâ€”we of
Stanford can face unblushingly this
coarse display. Besides, we can
throb at the Mem And for 70 cents
less than at the Guild Theater.
