# Mother's Club Furnishes Home Touch at Stanford
## 
### CARYL HARMS 
"My son hasn't written for over a month. Would you see if
he's all right?"
"My daughter's birthday is next week. Could you arrange
to send her a real birthday cake?"
Messages such as these from parents of Stanford students,

anxious about the welfare of their"
children, are x'eceived nearly every
day by the Stanford Mothers' Club.
And every time this group does its
best to see that these requests are
fulfilled in a way to bring happi
ness to the family involved.
"Our work is a real joy to all of
us," says Mrs. William Hawley
Davis, past president of the organ
ization, "and it has many, many
phases."
Work done at Stanford Village is
outstanding example of the help
ful and far-reaching effects of these
varied club activities. For young
families, a children's furniture pool
has been established, and cribs and
bassinettes are doing double and
triple duty as they pass from one
household to the next.
Babies' and children's clothing is
provided for needy families, and
wardrobes for adults are always i
available.
Mothers' Club is partially respon
sible, too, for the outfitting of the
game room at the Village, as well
as for the furnishing of two living
rooms there.
The Welfax - e and Scholarship
Committees are always on the watch
for students who need financial as
sistance. Requests for aid come
from counselors, from friends, and
sometimes from the students them
selves, but frequently members of
the club must do some real detec
tive work in tracing deserving
cases.
At all times such help is given
quietly, so that there need be no
embarrassment to the student.
Money is always presented as a
gift, never as a loan, but it is often j
paid back by the grateful recipi
ents.
Among the other activities of the
Mothers' Club should be mentioned
what are perhaps their best-known
projects, the two Rest Homes on
campus. The group .was also in- J
i- rumental in obtaining the stop of
the Freedom Train at Palo Alto, a
job somewhat out of its usual line,
but one that was considered im
portant enough for special attention.
Mothers' Club of Stanford Uni
versity. now about 24 years old, has
an approximate membership of;
3.400, scattered throughout the
United States and nearly every
country in the world — including
twenty-two members in China.
In the U.S. the organization is
divided into five sections: East Bay,
Southern California, Sacramento,
Portland, and the "baby" of the j
•_ioup, Seattle. Funds to carry on
its work are obtained from dues,
cifts. and the two yearly benefits,
like the Calico Circus last fall and
the sixth Annual Phantom Party
last spring.
Regular business meetings are
held on the third Tuesday of each
month here on campus. Officers,
elected in the spring, serve for one |
year beginning on Sept. 1, and are j
subject to re-election.
Present officers of the Mothers'
Club are Mrs. H. B. Kessler, presi
dent: Mrs. Donald Smith, first vice
president; Mrs. L. G. Hornfcy. sec- |
ond vice-president; Mrs. J. W. Wear, j
third vice-president; Mrs. Verner |
Allen, recording secretary; Mrs. j
Grover A. Miller, corresponding
-ecretary; Mrs. W. H. Davis, finan
i'ial secretary; Mrs. Walter Rodgers, !
treasurer; and Mrs. E. P. Lowe, his- I
torian.

"My son hasn't written for over a month. Would you see if
he's all right?"
"My daughter's birthday is next week. Could you arrange
to send her a real birthday cake?"
Messages such as these from parents of Stanford students,

anxious about the welfare of their"
children, are x'eceived nearly every
day by the Stanford Mothers' Club.
And every time this group does its
best to see that these requests are
fulfilled in a way to bring happi
ness to the family involved.
"Our work is a real joy to all of
us," says Mrs. William Hawley
Davis, past president of the organ
ization, "and it has many, many
phases."
Work done at Stanford Village is
outstanding example of the help
ful and far-reaching effects of these
varied club activities. For young
families, a children's furniture pool
has been established, and cribs and
bassinettes are doing double and
triple duty as they pass from one
household to the next.
Babies' and children's clothing is
provided for needy families, and
wardrobes for adults are always i
available.
Mothers' Club is partially respon
sible, too, for the outfitting of the
game room at the Village, as well
as for the furnishing of two living
rooms there.
The Welfax - e and Scholarship
Committees are always on the watch
for students who need financial as
sistance. Requests for aid come
from counselors, from friends, and
sometimes from the students them
selves, but frequently members of
the club must do some real detec
tive work in tracing deserving
cases.
At all times such help is given
quietly, so that there need be no
embarrassment to the student.
Money is always presented as a
gift, never as a loan, but it is often j
paid back by the grateful recipi
ents.
Among the other activities of the
Mothers' Club should be mentioned
what are perhaps their best-known
projects, the two Rest Homes on
campus. The group .was also in- J
i- rumental in obtaining the stop of
the Freedom Train at Palo Alto, a
job somewhat out of its usual line,
but one that was considered im
portant enough for special attention.
Mothers' Club of Stanford Uni
versity. now about 24 years old, has
an approximate membership of;
3.400, scattered throughout the
United States and nearly every
country in the world — including
twenty-two members in China.
In the U.S. the organization is
divided into five sections: East Bay,
Southern California, Sacramento,
Portland, and the "baby" of the j
•_ioup, Seattle. Funds to carry on
its work are obtained from dues,
cifts. and the two yearly benefits,
like the Calico Circus last fall and
the sixth Annual Phantom Party
last spring.
Regular business meetings are
held on the third Tuesday of each
month here on campus. Officers,
elected in the spring, serve for one |
year beginning on Sept. 1, and are j
subject to re-election.
