## THURSDAY Waterpolo Team Prepares for OC 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie put his var
sity water poloists through a small
pool scrimmage yesterday in prepa
ration for the tough battle Thurs
day with the Olympic Club. The
Indians will travel to San Francisco
to face the Winged "O" squad,
which as usual is loaded with tal
ent.
In addition to stars like Peter
son, Plate, and Richards, who have
played a number of years, the
Clubmen have added an American
Olympic Games star to their roster.
Even though the Olympic Club
probably has the best team on the
coast, the Cards hope to use their
great speed to beat their skilled
opponents, as practically every man
on the Indian squad is a varsity
swimmer.
Coach Haynie has been trying
several combinations of players for
the starting positions. Right now it
looks like Harry Borchers, Fritz
Mauer, Hub Stokely, Ralph Sala,
Ken Fox, Don Weeden, and Kim
Fletcher will get the starting call.
High on the list of Card substi
tutes are Ed Major, Don Patch,
John Mowat, Bill Maillard, Marsh
Pear!man, Dick Harlan, Pierre
Hathaway, Don Baruch, and Frank
Mac Donald.
