# Varsity Gridmen Practice Passes For Bronc Game
## 
### 
Footballs flew long, short, and
often on the Stanford practice field
yesterday as Coach Marchie
Schwartz put his men through
drills intended to strengthen t he
passing attack that failed in Satur
day's WSC game.
But hopes for a successful aerial
display took a dip when it was
learned that Tom Shaw, sophomore
quarterback, had been admitted to
the Stanford Hospital for observa-

tion. Shaw complained of intesti
nal cramps and it was feared that
the young passer might have to
undergo an appendicitis operation.
After a preliminary examination,
however, the doctors thought the
ailment to be but an attack of flu.
Passing Surprises?
If Shaw is held out of Saturday's
Santa Clara game, the passing at
tack will be materially weakened,
but several surprises in the over
head department are in store for
Card fans.
Bill DeYoung, transfer fullback
from Chaffey Junior College's Lit
tle Rose Bowl championship team,
was switched to end yesterday. The
move was made so that Schwartz
could make greater use of De-
Young's speed and pass - catching
ability. DeYoung has seen limited
action in the fullback spot, playing
behind Emery Mitchell and Marty
Anderson. The change was also
made to give added strength to the
end position vacated by injured
Ken Rose. Rose will not play in
the Santa Clara tilt, but may be
ready for the UCLA game.
Castignoli Sidelined
Jim Castignoli, sidelined with an
injured foot, missed yesterday's
practice but is expected to be out
again today. Castignoli played de
fensive center against WSC but was
replaced when the Cards went on
offnse. He injured a bone in his
foot before the WSC tilt but did not
become aware of it until just be
fore the game.
