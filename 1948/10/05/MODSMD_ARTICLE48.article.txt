# Taylor's Frosh Show Great Grid Promise
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Despite Saturday's 38-7 snow job of Mt. San Antonio JC, all
wasn't happy out on the frosh practice field yesterday. Coach
Chuck Taylor sent his charges through an afternoon of practice
only to have Quarterbacks Gary Kirkorian and Dick Horn, just
recently declared fit after being sidelined for two weeks, climb

right back on the injury list during
scrimmage.
The fact that Harry Hugasian, who
has handled the signal chores since
Horn and Kirkorian went out of ac
tion, looks better every day at the
skipper spot is little consolation to
Taylor, inasmuch as he had counted
on Hugasian for a lot of work at
left half. Jack Crawford's play at
half Saturday, however, showed he
has the .stuff to handle the position
very effectively, both offensively and
defensively.
Shcpard Looks Good
Dean Shepard looks like the hot
test prospect among Taylor's re
serve backs at this moment. The boy
did some running Saturday that
showed indications of big things to
come, even in view of the fact that
the Mountaineer defense offered less
resistance to his efforts than would
have a number of strategically
placed tackling dummies.
Chuck Brazel and Marv Mellaway,
both operating at fullback, seem to
leave little to be desired at that
position. Brazel, the hardest run
ning back on the field, looks like he
would rather run over tacklers than
around them. He showed his prefer
ence several times during the game,
each time leaving numerous prone
figures in his wake. Mellaway stacks
up as the best defensive back on the
squad—just the type of linebacker a
team needs to bottle up the oppo
sition's running attack. '
Eric Soutlnvood, starting half,
showed a beautiful change of pace
to go with his speed while rambling
all over the Stadium against San
Antonio. He hits the holes like a
bullet from a gun, but at the same
time is an unusually polished run
ner for a freshman, feinting in full
stride like few backs can do even
as veterans.'
Ends Strong
The Cardbabes' endplay was gen
erally on a high level with Bill Mc-
Coll, Wilbur Taylor, Jack Rye, and
Bill Storum sharing the honors
McColl who had ample opportunity
to demonstrate his place-kickini.
talent also, looks like one of the best
bets on the squad for next year''
varsity. At 215 pounds, (i feet
inches, he has the size to go will
his natural ability and should de
velop into a top wingman. An.s
combination of these boys give?
Taylor good flank protection on de
fense, and fine passing targets oi
offense.
So far the guard spots have givei
the frosli coaches their biggest prob
lem — the problem consisting o
whom to start. Jess Cone, a mur
derous tackier and a hard charginj
blocker, seetns to have a firm grij
on tlie right guard position, but Jo<
Jacobs, Bcrnie Tokarz, and Owei
Powell arc fighting it out for tin
other spot, and the fight is some
thing to see. When these boys an
pitted against each other the lu
flies all over the field.
With Lee Daley still out of actioi
with injuries, OWen Rhul, Douj
McColl, Chuck Hokanson. and A
Raisch make up the talent at tackU
Rhul and Hokanson started Satur
day, but all of the four turned ii
creditable performances, with Ho
kanson s downfield blocking espe
cially noticeable.
Spirit High
Perhaps the most encouraginj
thing about the yearling squad a
this point is the obvious fact tha
they all seem to want to play hare
football. Even on a Monday after
noon after a game, when a team i
usually inclined to take it a littl
easy, the boys went at it in scrim
mage like it was the Cal game
blocking hard, tackling hard, an<
talking it up all the time. Even afte
the bulk ol the team hit for th
showers there were still a few play
crs out on the field taking swipe
at the blocking dummies, practicin
passing and kicking.
