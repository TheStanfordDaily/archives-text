To the Keeper of the Front Row:
"Isn't it bad enough that a person has to plow through the numerous
dull and dreary pages of the Stanford Shopping News every morning
without having to be bored further by the sheepdip that you continue
to toss out in your column?
First, you said Stanford was going to take Washington State. Then,
you said Cleveland couldn't beat Boston. Just exactly where do you
get your stuff? It sounds more like the Back Row instead of the Front
Row.
I hope to heck you pick Santa Clara next Saturday. And maybe you
could do me the favor of picking the Boston Braves in the Series. With
those selections confronting me, I could rest assured that my two Indian
teams could win.
Humbly,
JOHN HALL."
Frosli Shine and Shine
Down to bizness, men. A lot of tongues have been wagging over the
sharp play of Coach Chuck Taylor's Frosh gridders in their season debut
last Saturday. 11 you think they're good, wait 'til you spot the Class of
52's basketball edition.
The Papoose cagers will be just as loaded with talent as the gridders.
Football stalwart Bill McColl can do a fancy step on the hardwood. And
two tall Slim-Jims, Ramstead and Walsh, are expected to do more great
things with the casaba.
Ramstead hails from Lincoln High in San Francisco where he was named
all-city center two years in succession. He whipped in enough points
during his senior year to grab off the City scoring titte, and he also
earned himself huzzahs for making the All-Northern California five.
Those who have seen him play have no worries as to his ability to
make the grade at Stanford. His friend, Jim Walsh, is another San Fran
ciscan and Walsh is another boy with a bright future. WJlh a little
more Simonize, his aggressive and alert play will take him right to the top.
Cleveland Over Koston
Manager Lou Boudreau's clutch hitting, Ken Keltier's power, and Joe
Gordon s versatility will add up this week to lower the boom on the too
i elaxed Boston Braves. Besides that, Bobby Feller and Bob Lemon will
be around just in case. The only question is whether Feller's fireball
has really cooled down to an ember-ball.
With the old teller in there, Cleveland would win in a breeze. I can't
think of any other pitcher in baseball who could pitch three games Ini
one week as effectively as Feller could when he had it.
Shaw's Appendix Bad?
Sophomore quarterback Tommy Shaw might have appendicitis. That
was the report last night, as Tommy came up with a pain in his side
and was carted off to the hospital for a two-day observation.
If Shaw is out, Stanford's chances for a snappy comeback against Santa
Clara are reduced to a shell of their former selves. Don Campbell—the
Rock, not Rocky—will have to take over most of the load. He would be
backed up by Aubrey Devine, a lefthanded signal caller.
