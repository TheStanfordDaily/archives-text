# McDonnell Injures Leg in Practice
## 
### 
Prospects for a successful Stan
ford soccer season were blackened
last week when Pat McDonnell, a
two-year letterman, broke his leg
during scrimmage Wednesday.
The injury, sustained when Mc-
Donnell accidentally stepped on the
ball during an intra-squad game,
\*ill keep the big fullback out of the
Card lineup for the balance of the
season.
McDonnell was named to the All-
Conference squad last year.
