# Paralysis Grips Accident Victim
## 
### 
Virginia Moore, Stanford seniov
critically injured in an auto acci
dent near Elko, Nov., over a week
ago, has shown considerable im
provement at University of Califor
nia Hospital in San Francisco.
Friends said that Miss Moore i?.
almost out of danger, and, is able
to talk and recognize people. She
is still paralyzed, however, and an
operation will probably be neces
sary to remove a blood clot from
her brain.
Miss Moore is not allowed visi
tors. However, friends who are
registered nurses have been work
ing extra shifts to attend to her, and
several students have volunteered
transportation for the nurses.
