LONDAN, Tuesday, Oct. 5(>P) —
Viscount Montgomery, Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, has been ap
pointed military chieftain of the
five-nation Western European Mili

French General of the Army Jean
de Lattre de Tassigny was named

Montgomery's official title will be

commanders-in-chief forming the
defense council of the Western Pow
ers—Britain, France, Belgium, The
Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
The appointments were announced
in a foreign office communique
which had been expected for sev
eral days. Presumably the delay
was due to the time needed to fill
all the appointments.
Basis for the appointments was

Brussels early this year, providing
for military collaboration for de
fense.
The communique said the new
officers of the alliance will study
(he "tactical and technical problems
of Western European defense."
These include provision of supplies
and arms for a defense force, how
the impoverished European nations
can arm themselves, and probably
the standardization of arms and am
munition.
It was understood that no head
quarters for the military committee
have beei decided upon. Differences
have been decided upon. Differences
be in London or the Continent.
