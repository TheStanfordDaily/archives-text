# Law Building Excavation Underway
## 
### 
Reconversion of the old adminis
tration building was well underway
today as workmen proceeded to rip
up the cement floor of the basement
and excavate for new foundations.
The workmen, in preparation for
tlie 18-month, $780,000 reconversion
job, have built a rampway for
trucks and sheds for tools and sup
plies in front of the building.
Boards have been placed along the
outside corridor so that the stone
work will not be destroyed.
In the rear, a dumping platform
has been built, to which a conveyor
belt will carry used materials from
the basement to be disposed of in
trucks.
When the foundations arc in place,
steel girders will be shot up through
the first floor to the roof. These will
act as supports for the second and
third floors and the mezzanine levels.
The marble stairways are on their
way out, at least at the first floor
level. Partitions have been tumbling
down for the past few days on the
main floor, but the second floor will
remain unaltered for the time being.
The three stained glass Biblical
figures hk'h over the lobby will be
preserved, but the remainder of the
colored glass downstairs, which is of
little importance, will be junked.


NF,W STANFORD LAW SCHOOL headquarters will l>e located in this
section of the Quad in the building formerly occunied by administration
offices. Work has already begun on the project which will cost an esti
mated $780,<H)0 when completed and will give the school one of the best
physical plants for law instruction in the country. Meanwhile, adminis
tration offices have been moved to the first floor of Eneina Hall and the
temporary buildings behind Cubberlcy Hall.
