# 'Othello' Opens Drama Season
## 
### 
The problem of interracial mar
riage, last week the subject of dis
pute in the California courts, is
the basis of Shakespeare's tragic
"Othello," which will be presented
at Stanford Nov. 4, 5, and G.
Although Shakespeare posed this
question 350 years ago, the modern
theater-goer upon seeing the pro
duction may well ask if recognition
of the lawful right of marriage be
tween the races has changed the
attitude of the society which
Shakespeare depicts.
"Othello" is the story of an Afri
can general in the Venetian army
who dares to marry the white
daughter of a senator.
Behind the story of their love is
woven an impenetrable barrier of
darkness and suspicion, resulting in
a jealousy made more intense by
society's general condemnation. This
tragedy of pent -up passion is
ranked by many as Shakespeare's
most outstanding drama.
Setting for the play is Venice and
Cyprus during the Renaissance pe
riod.
"Othello" is the first perform
ance of the current Stanford Play
ers' subscription series season.
Tickets for the series of three plays
and one opera may be purchased
for $3 in room 202 in the Memorial
Auditorium.
