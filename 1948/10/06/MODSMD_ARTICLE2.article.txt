What does Santa Clara have that
Stanford doesn't? Only the Cal
janner.
Touching off traditional pre
;ame rivalry, a cordon of Santa
Zlara cars paraded the California
janner around Quad and up the
Row late yesterday afternoon amid
i blaring of horns.
Several Santa Clara students
•aptured the trophy, which on most
Saturdays is a fixture behind the
Tal rooting section, by engineering
i clever coup after the Bear-Bron
•o football tilt.
In the post-game confusion the
Santa Clarans informed the Cali
ornia roters that their banner was
11 danger of being snatched by
some guys from Santa Clara." Cal
ooters readily assisted the plot
ers in hauling down the flag—for
;afe keeping, they thought.
The Santa Clara stalwarts then
lyly made off with the blue and
gold's trademark. It was brought
>ut of hiding at last Saturday's
. r resno State-Santa Clara game and
vill undoubtedly put in an appear
mce at the Stanford Stadium come
Saturday next.
