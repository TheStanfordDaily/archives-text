## 7-Dollar Quad 
### 
Frankly, this is a selling job. But we've known Quad Editor
Ted Off since Western Civ days, and we share the same prob
lems—rising printing costs, so we aren't at all ashamed to help
him plug a good thing, the 1949 Quad.
Ted and his staff got stuck with the Quad price raise this year.
The price should have been raised two years ago in the face of
rising costs. Although closely budgeted, the yearbook lost
53,000 last year—largely because of higher printing and en
graving costs.
Anyway, the cost to you this year has risen from $5.75 to
57.00. That is not much of a raise. Actually it is hoped that the
price will enable the Quad to break even. Last year's $5.75
Selling price didn't even cover the printing and engraving. Al
though part of the difference between income and cost was made
up by advertising and charges to organizations, the Quad went
in the hole some $3,000.
Neither the advertising nor the charges to organizations could
be raised. The only out v/as to raise the price.
Even so, the price isn't high compared to other increases in
the cost of living. And there is one advantage. Printing of your
name on the Quad will cost only 25 cents more instead of 50.
If you're interested, over 5,000 pictures were published in
last year's Quad. Another thousand were taken and not used.
Photography and engraving are expensive.
In addition to such usual items as office expenses, telephone,
photography, etc., the Quad had to pay over $1,000 taxes and
auditing expense last year.
What are you getting for your money? Well, the Quad won't
be any bigger. But there will be better coverage of the Village,
Encina, and campus clubs. Introductory pages will be in two
color. Style and type will be new. And, of course, pictures
and copy will be entirely new. You'll be getting a product that
is equal to many yearbooks that are higher priced.
