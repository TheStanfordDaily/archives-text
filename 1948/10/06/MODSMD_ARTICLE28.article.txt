## Bull Session 
### 
In which Bull Session goes to a wedding.
If one happens to be a member of a fraternity, one spends ;tl least
half a dozen evenings during the summer vacation months attending
weddings of fraternity brothers who have decided that getting married
is by far the easiest way of escaping the draft. One often shirts out for
this type of festivity in the best of health, but after several hours of
alternately raising toasts and champagne glasses, one invariably arrives
home seeing not one, but six.

I particularly enjoyed one ceremony to which I was
invited up in San Francisco. If was just a small
wedding. The bride's father had only a small gun.
The bridal procession was really something to see.
Leading the way to the altar was a little flower girl,
who was carrying four roses. She was carrying hers
much better than the best man. But the bride's dress
was (he highlight of the procession. Everything about
it wi>s perfect, except for the train. Her caboose was
sticking out a little too far.
The bride was given away by her father. With the
money he had tied up in that wedding, I was surprised

he didn't auction her ofT.
The mother of the bride seemed very happy about the whole thing. She
was smiling through the entire ceremony. Her husband was laughing out
loud.
It was easy to see that the new groom was going to have a very domi
neering wife. As ho slipped his ring on her finger, she clipped his
.hrough his nose. 1 think the minister had heard too many rumors that
he groom was marrying the girl just for her money. Alter pronouncing
them man and wife, the preacher told the groom that he could now kiss
iiis community property.
Flie newlyweds leit the church with the best man driving the car and
the bride's father riding shotgun.
The reception for the young people was a very nice affair, but 1 didn't
meet many people. There wasn't much room under that table. One of
e bridesmaids was telling about the pictures of the bride that appeared
in an advertisement in the magazines. Under her picture was the caption:
"Shes lovely! She's engaged! She uses Ponds! (Editor's Note: "What's
the matter, no bathtub?")
Ihe entire evening made me wonder about when I was going to get
married. At heart, I'm just a one-woman man. I just haven't found the
woman yet. But, as you may have gathered by now, the ceremony didn't
make a particularly strong impression on me. In fact, it went in one
ear and out the other. A few beers has the same effect on me, more or less.

Ihe entire evening made me wonder about when I was going to get
married. At heart, I'm just a one-woman man. I just haven't found the
woman yet. But, as you may have gathered by now, the ceremony didn't
make a particularly strong impression on me. In fact, it went in one
ear and out the other. A few beers has the same effect on me, more or less.

In which Bull Session goes to a wedding.
If one happens to be a member of a fraternity, one spends ;tl least
half a dozen evenings during the summer vacation months attending
weddings of fraternity brothers who have decided that getting married
is by far the easiest way of escaping the draft. One often shirts out for
this type of festivity in the best of health, but after several hours of
alternately raising toasts and champagne glasses, one invariably arrives
home seeing not one, but six.

I particularly enjoyed one ceremony to which I was
invited up in San Francisco. If was just a small
wedding. The bride's father had only a small gun.
The bridal procession was really something to see.
Leading the way to the altar was a little flower girl,
who was carrying four roses. She was carrying hers
much better than the best man. But the bride's dress
was (he highlight of the procession. Everything about
it wi>s perfect, except for the train. Her caboose was
sticking out a little too far.
The bride was given away by her father. With the
money he had tied up in that wedding, I was surprised

he didn't auction her ofT.
The mother of the bride seemed very happy about the whole thing. She
was smiling through the entire ceremony. Her husband was laughing out
loud.
It was easy to see that the new groom was going to have a very domi
neering wife. As ho slipped his ring on her finger, she clipped his
.hrough his nose. 1 think the minister had heard too many rumors that
he groom was marrying the girl just for her money. Alter pronouncing
them man and wife, the preacher told the groom that he could now kiss
iiis community property.
Flie newlyweds leit the church with the best man driving the car and
the bride's father riding shotgun.
The reception for the young people was a very nice affair, but 1 didn't
meet many people. There wasn't much room under that table. One of
e bridesmaids was telling about the pictures of the bride that appeared
in an advertisement in the magazines. Under her picture was the caption:
"Shes lovely! She's engaged! She uses Ponds! (Editor's Note: "What's
the matter, no bathtub?")
