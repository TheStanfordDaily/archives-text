# CAMPUS OPINION
## New Friend Discovered By Foreign Student 
### 
To the Editor:
Saturday evening the usual line
of hungry faces dotted the entrance
to the Cellar. But it was an un
usual group of singles, so drasti
cally single that when the white
clad "officer of the chain" an
nounced, "Four, three, or two!"
there was no reaction.
The hungry faces stared, gasped,
and settled back into the same
waiting routine.
"Four, three, or two!" rang the
determined voice again, and again
no reaction.
By that time, two exceptionally
hungry fellows, each from one cor
ner of the earth, were independent
ly entertaining the same idea.
Why .not walk down, any four,
three, or two of us, share the same
table, and enjoy each other's com
pany instead of waiting to be cru
cified on a lonely rotating stool?
Before long, a sociable young •man
from Vancouver, Canada, and yours
truly from Lebanon were on our
way to the same table.
What a thrill to know people and
discover their similar, yet different
personalities, which makes this
world of ours an interesting place
to live in. We hear that people are
fun; we witness fortunes spent over
the radio. We enioy people day af
ter day. But on the way to the Cel
lar, all the fun of meeting people is
offered to us on a tray, and we re
fuse to take it.
This is hardly a Cellar affair,
however. It is a universal law that
cuts across all factions of society,
all colors and creeds, from Canada
to Lebanon.

The bulk of information that my
Canadian friend and I exchanged
over that dinner was richer than
any book could afford. For, how
could a book surpass the person
who lives it and communicates it.
How on earth, unless I was ma
joring in international relations,
could I have ever learned of Al
berta, Ontario, Prince Edward Is
land, Saskatchewan (with the right
spelling), and the like had I not
broken the ice of shyness by shar
ing the table with a "stranger"?
Lebanon had its share of the dis
cussion too. My Canadian friend
knows now, I hope, that the one
million people within four thousand
square miles of country in the Near
East enjoy a republican system of
government, that they border on
the French way. He knows that
Beirut is a cosmopolitan city that,
among other things, includes an ac
credited American university.
Thus Lebanon and Canada shook
hands across a dinner table and
built, a lasting friendship.
Other people from other coun
tries, including Texas, could enjoy
experiencing the same sensation. If
it is not going to happen among .sin
cere students from the same alma
mater, then where on earth will it
ever happen?
The approach is very simple.
Next time the"officer of the chain"
(Why did I ever pick that title for
him?) requests, "Four, three, or
two!" for Pete's sake, disband into
fours, threes, or twos, and enjoy
the thrilling experience of meeting
people.

ter day. But on the way to the Cel
lar, all the fun of meeting people is
offered to us on a tray, and we re
fuse to take it.
This is hardly a Cellar affair,
however. It is a universal law that
cuts across all factions of society,
all colors and creeds, from Canada
to Lebanon.

The bulk of information that my
Canadian friend and I exchanged
over that dinner was richer than
any book could afford. For, how
could a book surpass the person
who lives it and communicates it.
How on earth, unless I was ma
joring in international relations,
could I have ever learned of Al
berta, Ontario, Prince Edward Is
land, Saskatchewan (with the right
spelling), and the like had I not
broken the ice of shyness by shar
ing the table with a "stranger"?
Lebanon had its share of the dis
cussion too. My Canadian friend
knows now, I hope, that the one
million people within four thousand
square miles of country in the Near
East enjoy a republican system of
government, that they border on
the French way. He knows that
Beirut is a cosmopolitan city that,
among other things, includes an ac
credited American university.
Thus Lebanon and Canada shook
hands across a dinner table and
built, a lasting friendship.
Other people from other coun
tries, including Texas, could enjoy
experiencing the same sensation. If
it is not going to happen among .sin
cere students from the same alma
mater, then where on earth will it
ever happen?
The approach is very simple.
Next time the"officer of the chain"
(Why did I ever pick that title for
him?) requests, "Four, three, or
two!" for Pete's sake, disband into
fours, threes, or twos, and enjoy
the thrilling experience of meeting
people.

To the Editor:
Saturday evening the usual line
of hungry faces dotted the entrance
to the Cellar. But it was an un
usual group of singles, so drasti
cally single that when the white
clad "officer of the chain" an
nounced, "Four, three, or two!"
there was no reaction.
The hungry faces stared, gasped,
and settled back into the same
waiting routine.
"Four, three, or two!" rang the
determined voice again, and again
no reaction.
By that time, two exceptionally
hungry fellows, each from one cor
ner of the earth, were independent
ly entertaining the same idea.
Why .not walk down, any four,
three, or two of us, share the same
table, and enjoy each other's com
pany instead of waiting to be cru
cified on a lonely rotating stool?
Before long, a sociable young •man
from Vancouver, Canada, and yours
truly from Lebanon were on our
way to the same table.
What a thrill to know people and
discover their similar, yet different
personalities, which makes this
world of ours an interesting place
to live in. We hear that people are
fun; we witness fortunes spent over
the radio. We enioy people day af
ter day. But on the way to the Cel
