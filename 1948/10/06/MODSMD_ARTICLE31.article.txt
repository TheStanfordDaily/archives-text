## Ex-Marine Supports National Defense 
### 
To the Editor:
It is a personal' satisfaction to mo
as a graduate student and t ly
sliot -up-around-the-edges cx-Ma
rine to find intelligence and com
mon horse sense in the editorials of
the past few days (i.e.. concerning
National Defense). Starry - eyed
idealism (usually pacifistic) was
the rule in such editorials before
the war. If there was anything
proved by the last war it was that
weakness invites contempt and at
tack. Strength, while it may not
prevent attack, certainly discour
ages it, and allows the attacked a
chance for survival.
A decision to start, an aggressive
war is made by politicians after
careful study by a military gon
ial staff. In effect the politicians
ask, "Can wo do it?" If the staff
replies, "We can!" then the decision
to force the issue is easy. If the
reply is, "Issue doubt I ul," or "No,
then the decision is, "Let's stall, or
arbitrate some more." Churchill's
recent "Memoirs" should be studied
by every peace-loving citizen in the
world. It is tragically clear how
Churchill foresaw the dangerous
days ahead, how he warned, threat
ened, pleaded for England to armâ€”
and how Hitler, arming and watch
ing with contempt, finally felt him
self strong enough to make his
moves. Force must stand at the
right band of Justice. A criminal
can be dealt with in no other way.
While we follow diligently the ways
of peace and use our best brains
and efforts in amicable solutions to
world problems, our armed services
must stand ready to inspire respect
for these brains and efforts and to
protect America from international
criminals.
It has always amused me how
any citizen considers himself a mil
itary expert on strategy and tactics
(Stovar, and especially Engvall,
please note). It takes years of
study, training, and planning to pro
duce an Eisenhower or a Marshall,
and once produced it is common
sense to heed their opinions on
strategy and their recommendations
as to the best military policy for
America. To impute crackpot, mili
tarism and professional inability to
patriotic, intelligent, professional

soldiers is as senseless as accusing
ihe federal judiciary of lack of pro
fessional ability and improper mo
tives.
As for the question of service to
our country: For every right dearly
bought there is a duty, for every
freedom for which men have died
there is a responsibility. Those
willing to take these rights and
freedoms without willingness, when
the call comes, to assume the du
ties and responsibilities, arc beneath
contempt.
