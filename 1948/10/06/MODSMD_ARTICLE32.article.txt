# Public Prejudiced Roble Girl Says
## 
### 
To the Editor:
My objection to the editorials
published Oct. 4 and 5 was not so
much on the topic, but rather of
the policy and manner in which
they imposed personal views. By
taking a one - sided stand as in
those articles, you created the im
pression that all of Stanford be
lieves in that manner.
Not only are you prejudicing the
public, but you are also doing harm
to the students. Many of the new
students at this University have
never attended a large institution
with varied ideas. Previous to their
registration at Stanford, they were
under the jurisdiction of their fam
ily. In other words, how about let
ting them for once in their life read
both sides of the question? Many
students on this campus read only
The Daily for a newpaper. They
do not always have time from their
studies to attend lectures on na
tional and international problems.
College life should offer to them the
complete facts behind current is
sues. In our later life, we are prej
udiced enough with our economic
welfare at stake. This is the time
when we should be open minded
and realize that there are new
ideas. We don't have to accept
them. I feel the American form of
government and economic system
are the best in the world, but 1
don't like my intelligence con
stantly questioned, which is what
is being done when only biased
facts are given.
