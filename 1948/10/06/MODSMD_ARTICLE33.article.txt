# Ideological Breadlines
## 
### JIM JOSEPH 
They ladle out soup, one kind t ;
another, to those in the ideological
breadlines—to everyone, exeept Oh
liberal.
The liberal is turned out to
starve, to fend for himself on what
scraps of doctrines and disciplines
are thrown his way. He is unwant
ed, uninvited, unsought.
And so the liberals are slowly
dying from want of political suste
nance. They are going under
ground— losing themselves in the
soup-lines of the doctrinated. For
a scrap of food they are turnin
parrot—forsaking the straight road
which took them neither left nor
right.
Those who are strong arc resist
ing. They say simply, the mostly
unheeded. "Need I turn either di
rection—need I align myself need
I pledge and take an oath to sup
port one or the other? Cun I not
follow where I will when I want:
where my thoughts instruct me?"
But the fanatic, as narrowly prej
udiced as his opposite, says, "No."
He collars the liberal. He holds
him at arm's length and shouts.
'"Declare yourself!"
"What must I declare?"
"Choose up sides—decide now!"
''What if I don't care to choose
—what if I simply want to retain
my right to vacillate—to tarry a
while first with one, then with an
other?"
"Then you are a weakling!"
"Then I declare myself an Amer
ican!"
"That is stupid! You arc a fool!
American is not enough—we are all
Americans, aren't we?"
The liberal hesitates; he wants to
think things straight, in his slow,
painstaking way. Like before.
"What do you think of the
strike?'' his accuser demands.
"Which strike? Tell me the ar
guments first— tell me the reasons,
the wherefores. Both sides. Then
I'll tell you what I think of the
strikes!"
"Fool—there are no questions to
be asked. You're either for the
strikes, or against them!"
"Tell me first, what are they
striking about?"
"It does not matter — they are
striking to live—that is enough!"
"I won't decide, without know
ing."
"Well, then, what stand do you
take about big business?"
"Which big business run 1 y
whom doing what?"
"Just big business — that's all.
State your side!"
The liberal tries to squirm aw, \
to escape and have some time i>
think tilings out. By himself away
from the beckoning of the bread
lines and the collaring by fonm
friends.
But the man's hands grip him
firmly.
"I declare myself a liberal, then.
Nothing more. It is not a point of
taking sides. You don't have ;o
take sides; not permanent ones. A
liberal just doesn't. He tries to 1 <
rational at "
The man releases him, disgust
edly.
"I've no more time for you
you're no liberal at all; you're
reactionary!"
"But "
"That's the trouble with you lib
erals. You're out of fashion. Yhi
don't count any more. There's i
neutrals in this thing. If you're nt
with us, you're with them. You'u
a reactionary."
The man turns and stalks off
Leaving the liberal alone. To f< ■
for himself on what scraps of dot
(lines and disciplines they throw
him. He is unwanted, uninvited
unsought.
