# Soph Ratraee To Run Friday
## 
### 
Immediately following the Santa
Clara rally Friday night the sopho
more social season will get under
way with the first class function of
the year, the Soph Ratraee.
Although the dance is a no-date
affair, those few fortunates who
have already made an engagement
for Friday night are cordially in
vited to report to Mangini's at 8:30
with their ladies in tow, according
to Marilyn Myerson, secretary of
Soph Excom, which is arranging
the festivities.
Solid Combo
Entertainment will be handled by
Sal Carson's solid combo, the
"Scintillating Seven," who have
promised to provide plenty of the
right kind of dance music. Dean
Borba, already familiar to many
Farm students, will also be on hand
with his varied repertoire of enter
tainment.
The dance will be held from 8:30
to 12 p.m.. and the dress is to be
strictly casual. Soph Excom guar
antees that the admission price at
50 cents per person is the biggest
bargain of the quarter.
Duke Merriam, chairman of the
transportation committee, has prom
ised that plenty of cars will be on
hand in front of Memorial Audi
torium immediately following the
rally for those who need a ride to
Mangini's.

promised special surprise enter

pressure, no further information
could be secured from the tight
lipped ones.
