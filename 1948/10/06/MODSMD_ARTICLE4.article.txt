# Aid Europe Gros Urges
## 
### 
"The United States must meet
head-on the 'Cold War' from Ber
lin to Delhi," was the solemn ad
vice of Robert R. Gros to a near
capacity audience which assembled
last night in Memorial Auditorium
to hear the first of the Tuesday
Evening Series lectures of autumn
quarter.
Speaking of the Communist men
ace throughout Europe, the Near
East, and India, the Palo Alto ad
vertising executive said that we
must not compromise ideals, but
should "prepare for the worst, and
hope for the best." Lauding "Oper
ation Vittles," the airlift to Berlin,
he pointed out that not only does it
sustain life in the city but it has
"stiffened the backbone of Europe."
Bringing the question closer to
his listeners, the Stanford graduate
appealed to all Americans to "make
democracy work." "By our exam
ple at home we can strengthen our
position abroad."
"Does Russia want war?" was a
question asked by Gros to every
diplomat he met throughout his 30,-
000-mile tour. Invariably the an
swer was "no." "War will only
come," they pointed out, "when the
Soviet miscalculates how far she
can push the Western powers."
Examples of recovery among na
tions benefitting from the Marshall
Plan were cited by the lecturer,
with the assurance that the Euro
pean Recovery Act is "getting Eu
rope on its feet." "The degrees of
recovery vary, but the plan is
yielding tangible results."
