NEW YORK. Oct. 5 (/P).-Frank
ic Albert of the San Francisco 49-
ers and Spec Sanders of the New
York Yankees continue to sparkle
as the individual offensive stars of
the All-America Football Confer
ence.
Despite great performances by
Glenn Dobbs of Los Angeles and
George Ratterman of Buffalo last
weekend, Albert clung to his lead
in total offense and forward pass
ing, League statistics showed to
day.
The veteran southpaw quarter
back has accounted for 1,302 yards
by both rushing and passing in 166
plays. Of this total. 1,125 yards have
been covered by 81 completed
passes in 132 attempts.
Sanders, the individual offensive
leader of 1947, found himself with
a losing club this season but still
has carried the ball 78 times for a
total of 375 yards to lead the con
ference in that department.
