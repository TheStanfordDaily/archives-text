Those of you who would like to see lor yourself the reason that Stanford
lost the WSC football game last Saturday should take in the technicolor
movies of the game tonight at 7:30 in the Ed Aud.
I returned from that game to the campus and promptly wrote a bit
on the sad show of blocking and tackling that our boys put on last week.
The movies show this far better than a sportswriter can describe it.
Now the Stanford football team is far better than the showing they put
on last week, but every student should see those movies and take it upon
himself to mention that he saw them to some member of the team.
The team saw the movies Monday night and from the groans that
arose as they saw themselves neck-tackling and missing blocks, I think
they know just how bad they looked. But before the losing habit hits the
'48 squad, they should be reminded that they can't take any team they
meet as a team not worthy of their best efforts.
Some Men Have Never Won a Conference Game
There are men on the squad who have never played on a Stanford team
that has won a game. (Those who were injured before the San Jose
State game.) There are far more men on the squad who have never
played on a team that has won a Conference game.
Stanford is too fine a school on continue on the losing path. This year's
team, I repeat, is as good as any on the Coast, but they have to play
every game as though it were the Big one.
Veteran Stanford football fans point out that Stanford is never "up"
for the Santa Clara game. The Broncs come to the Farm with everything
to gain. A win over Stanford means a good season, even if they lose
over half iheir games. Thus, the Farm men have to play this one with
all they have, for Santa Clara is always tough, even more so this year.
Let me point out that the Broncs scored three touchdowns on the ground
against California. Can you name another team that has done that in
the past two years?

Back to the movies again. When the football team sees the movies,
the film is stopped and run over and over again to show every move
made by each player. When the student body sees the movies, every
thing happens at once and, unless you know the numbers of the players,
you really can't tell who is who.
If. you are really interested in knowing what goes on, read a play by
play description of the game from one of the City papers and watch for
the plays as they come up. If you want to learn how to lose four teelh
in a hurry, watch Don Campbell as he tackles a WSC beak with nine
minutes to go in the third quarter. The play is an off tackle slant,
(Stanford's right tackle). Don is shown making the stop and then spit
ting out two of the teeth.
And if you think that Stanford has no passing attack at all. watch the
play when Tom Shaw lofts one to Gene Martin. It came up with about
fi\e minutes to go in the game. For a prettier pass you will have to
search long and hard.
I made one prediction, in jest, in the first issue of the paper. It is my
policy to steer clear of crystal-gazing as a rule, but with Mr. Bigwood's
pardon, I'll go way out on the limb and call a Stanford win by six points
on Saturday.
If ever a football team should want to apologize to a student body for
a poor showing, this team is it. One of these days this team is going
to run up a lot of points just to show the world that they have it. It
might be Saturday.
No More Coulda, Woultla, Shoulda Stuff
I lie time for moral victories is gone. The coulda, woulda, shoulda
phase is past. From now it has to be a win. It has been said that the
type of person who goes to Stanford, and plays on a Stanford football
team, is not the type who can play rock and sock ball. I hope the men
on this years team prove that to be false. We showed it was wrong with
the Vow boys, and again with the Wow boys, but it is time to show it again.

Maybe it would be well to clear up the discussion about the absence of
games for the jayvees. Mr. Masters and Mr. Schwartz hate to see some
boy who can play a lot of ball for the varsity when he gets a little expe
rience use up his eligibility in a junior varsity game. The instance
concerning Bob Ghilotti cured them of that.
I would like to see a return of the ruling which allows the jayvees
two games a year but does not take a year of varsity play away. That
will take a Pacific Coast Conference ruling and it is too late for that
to come about this year.

The movies show this far better than a sportswriter can describe it.
Now the Stanford football team is far better than the showing they put
on last week, but every student should see those movies and take it upon
himself to mention that he saw them to some member of the team.
The team saw the movies Monday night and from the groans that
arose as they saw themselves neck-tackling and missing blocks, I think
they know just how bad they looked. But before the losing habit hits the
'48 squad, they should be reminded that they can't take any team they
meet as a team not worthy of their best efforts.
Some Men Have Never Won a Conference Game
There are men on the squad who have never played on a Stanford team
that has won a game. (Those who were injured before the San Jose
State game.) There are far more men on the squad who have never
played on a team that has won a Conference game.
Stanford is too fine a school on continue on the losing path. This year's
team, I repeat, is as good as any on the Coast, but they have to play
every game as though it were the Big one.
Veteran Stanford football fans point out that Stanford is never "up"
for the Santa Clara game. The Broncs come to the Farm with everything
to gain. A win over Stanford means a good season, even if they lose
over half iheir games. Thus, the Farm men have to play this one with
all they have, for Santa Clara is always tough, even more so this year.
Let me point out that the Broncs scored three touchdowns on the ground
against California. Can you name another team that has done that in
the past two years?
Cardinals Should Furnish Programs
Back to the movies again. When the football team sees the movies,
the film is stopped and run over and over again to show every move
made by each player. When the student body sees the movies, every
thing happens at once and, unless you know the numbers of the players,
you really can't tell who is who.
If. you are really interested in knowing what goes on, read a play by
play description of the game from one of the City papers and watch for
the plays as they come up. If you want to learn how to lose four teelh
in a hurry, watch Don Campbell as he tackles a WSC beak with nine
minutes to go in the third quarter. The play is an off tackle slant,
(Stanford's right tackle). Don is shown making the stop and then spit
ting out two of the teeth.
And if you think that Stanford has no passing attack at all. watch the
play when Tom Shaw lofts one to Gene Martin. It came up with about
fi\e minutes to go in the game. For a prettier pass you will have to
search long and hard.
I made one prediction, in jest, in the first issue of the paper. It is my
policy to steer clear of crystal-gazing as a rule, but with Mr. Bigwood's
pardon, I'll go way out on the limb and call a Stanford win by six points
on Saturday.
If ever a football team should want to apologize to a student body for
a poor showing, this team is it. One of these days this team is going
to run up a lot of points just to show the world that they have it. It
might be Saturday.
No More Coulda, Woultla, Shoulda Stuff
I lie time for moral victories is gone. The coulda, woulda, shoulda
phase is past. From now it has to be a win. It has been said that the
type of person who goes to Stanford, and plays on a Stanford football
team, is not the type who can play rock and sock ball. I hope the men
on this years team prove that to be false. We showed it was wrong with
the Vow boys, and again with the Wow boys, but it is time to show it again.

Maybe it would be well to clear up the discussion about the absence of
games for the jayvees. Mr. Masters and Mr. Schwartz hate to see some
boy who can play a lot of ball for the varsity when he gets a little expe
rience use up his eligibility in a junior varsity game. The instance
concerning Bob Ghilotti cured them of that.
I would like to see a return of the ruling which allows the jayvees
two games a year but does not take a year of varsity play away. That
will take a Pacific Coast Conference ruling and it is too late for that
to come about this year.
Those of you who would like to see lor yourself the reason that Stanford
lost the WSC football game last Saturday should take in the technicolor
movies of the game tonight at 7:30 in the Ed Aud.

arose as they saw themselves neck-tackling and missing blocks, I think
they know just how bad they looked. But before the losing habit hits the
'48 squad, they should be reminded that they can't take any team they
meet as a team not worthy of their best efforts.
Some Men Have Never Won a Conference Game
There are men on the squad who have never played on a Stanford team
that has won a game. (Those who were injured before the San Jose
State game.) There are far more men on the squad who have never
played on a team that has won a Conference game.
Stanford is too fine a school on continue on the losing path. This year's
team, I repeat, is as good as any on the Coast, but they have to play
every game as though it were the Big one.
Veteran Stanford football fans point out that Stanford is never "up"
for the Santa Clara game. The Broncs come to the Farm with everything
to gain. A win over Stanford means a good season, even if they lose
over half iheir games. Thus, the Farm men have to play this one with
all they have, for Santa Clara is always tough, even more so this year.
Let me point out that the Broncs scored three touchdowns on the ground
against California. Can you name another team that has done that in
the past two years?
Cardinals Should Furnish Programs
Back to the movies again. When the football team sees the movies,
the film is stopped and run over and over again to show every move
made by each player. When the student body sees the movies, every
thing happens at once and, unless you know the numbers of the players,
you really can't tell who is who.
If. you are really interested in knowing what goes on, read a play by
play description of the game from one of the City papers and watch for
the plays as they come up. If you want to learn how to lose four teelh
in a hurry, watch Don Campbell as he tackles a WSC beak with nine
minutes to go in the third quarter. The play is an off tackle slant,
(Stanford's right tackle). Don is shown making the stop and then spit
ting out two of the teeth.
And if you think that Stanford has no passing attack at all. watch the
play when Tom Shaw lofts one to Gene Martin. It came up with about
fi\e minutes to go in the game. For a prettier pass you will have to
search long and hard.
I made one prediction, in jest, in the first issue of the paper. It is my
policy to steer clear of crystal-gazing as a rule, but with Mr. Bigwood's
pardon, I'll go way out on the limb and call a Stanford win by six points
on Saturday.
If ever a football team should want to apologize to a student body for
a poor showing, this team is it. One of these days this team is going
to run up a lot of points just to show the world that they have it. It
might be Saturday.
No More Coulda, Woultla, Shoulda Stuff
I lie time for moral victories is gone. The coulda, woulda, shoulda
phase is past. From now it has to be a win. It has been said that the
type of person who goes to Stanford, and plays on a Stanford football
team, is not the type who can play rock and sock ball. I hope the men
on this years team prove that to be false. We showed it was wrong with
the Vow boys, and again with the Wow boys, but it is time to show it again.

Maybe it would be well to clear up the discussion about the absence of
games for the jayvees. Mr. Masters and Mr. Schwartz hate to see some
boy who can play a lot of ball for the varsity when he gets a little expe
rience use up his eligibility in a junior varsity game. The instance
concerning Bob Ghilotti cured them of that.
I would like to see a return of the ruling which allows the jayvees
two games a year but does not take a year of varsity play away. That
will take a Pacific Coast Conference ruling and it is too late for that
to come about this year.
Those of you who would like to see lor yourself the reason that Stanford
lost the WSC football game last Saturday should take in the technicolor
movies of the game tonight at 7:30 in the Ed Aud.
I returned from that game to the campus and promptly wrote a bit
on the sad show of blocking and tackling that our boys put on last week.
The movies show this far better than a sportswriter can describe it.
Now the Stanford football team is far better than the showing they put
on last week, but every student should see those movies and take it upon
himself to mention that he saw them to some member of the team.
