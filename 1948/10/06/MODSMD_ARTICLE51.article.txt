# Anderson, Rosekrans Return to Card Line up
## 
### 
Varsity versus frosli was once
again the order of the day as Mar
chic Schwartz scrimmaged the two
teams in an effort to improve the
blocking and tackling oi the elder
breathren of the football clan. Time
was also given over to hitting the
dummies, signal drills, and calis
thenics.
Halfback position was .strength
ened with the return of Bob An
derson to active duty. Anderson, a
regular in 1946 and '47, will add
power to the Card attack with his
blocking. He has been out of ac
tion since the week before the San
Jose game.
Schwartz has backs who run as
well as Anderson, but most of the
speedsters lack the blocking ability
and know-how possessed by the big
left half.
Another ray of light was shed
upon the Farm grid scene when
Tom Shaw was released from the
hospital with what the doctors de
scribed as "a touch of intestinal
flu." It is not known whether Shaw
will see action against Santa Clara
on Saturday.
Center John Rosekrans, who did
not make the Pullman trip because
of an injured leg, will also play
Saturday. A 1 Rau's ankle has re
sponded to treatment, and the big
tackle will be ready for full-time
duty after sitting out part of the
WSC game.
