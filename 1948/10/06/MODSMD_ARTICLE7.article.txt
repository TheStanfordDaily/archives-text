## 
### 
First word was received this week
from a contingent of former stu
dents of archeology at Stanford
who are exploring the ruins of
Troy. These students banded to
gether for the purpose of investi
gating their theory that the history
of the destruction of Troy is not
complete.
Their initial report was worded
in a guarded manner, but it listed
discoveries which included par
tially destroyed relics which are
"amazingly similar" to those of the
North American Indians.
"Our theory is still unproven,"
wrote the spokesman, "but we have
in our collection the head of a
weapon which can be described
only as a tomahawk. It won't be
long until the full significance of
our discoveries is known," he con
cluded.
The spokesman as well as the
other members of the Farm group
refused publication of their names
at this stage of their expedition.
