SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6 (£>)—
Pasenger ship travel across the Pa
cific stopped completely today.
The SS President Cleveland ar
rived and was promptly tied up by
the maritime strike—the last of the
big liners to become strikebound.
Seven others previously were tied
up.
The four American President Line
vessels — the Cleveland, Wilson,
Meigs, and Gordon, are in San Fran
cisco. The Matson liner Lurline is
at Long Beach, Calif., and the four
big ships in the Alaska trade—the
Aleutian, Baranof, Denali, and
Alaska, are at Seattle.
The airplane remained the only
way of getting to Hawaii, the Philip
pines and the Orient.

quiet on the 35th day of the strike,
with no apparent moves to settle
the dispute.
Four longshore gangs and 17 por
ters unloaded the Cleveland's mail
and baggage, following settlement of
a dispute that delayed embarkation
from the General Gordon which ar
rived yesterday.
