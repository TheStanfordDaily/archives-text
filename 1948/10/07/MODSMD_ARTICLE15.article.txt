# Changchun Lost To Chinese Reds
## 
### 
NANKING, Oct. 6 (/P) —The gov
ernment today announced it had
abandoned Changchun. The Man
churian capital had been turned into
a military liability by months of
Communist siege.
It was believed President Chiang
Kai-Shek made the decision in order
to concentrate government strength
against the growing Red peril in
North China and South Manchuria.
Some experts believe Chiang also
may be ready to tell his troops to
quit Mukden and fight south into
China proper. This would come only
if there is no other way to save
North China.
(The abandonment of all Manchu
ria has been urged often by U.S.
military advisers in Nanking. They
want the government to bring all its
force to bear in North China, clear
out the Communists, and then fight
back into Manchuria, a great indus
trial prize.)
There wj.s no indication, however,
that the government means to leave
Mukden. Lt. Gen. Teng Wen-Yi,
military spokesman who announced
the abandonment of Changchun, said
fresh troops were pouring ashore at
the South Manchurian port of llulu
tao.
