## 
### 
As myriads of movie-goers edge
disappointedly out of theaters play
ing '"super-colossal" Hollywood ep
ics, it is somewhat of a miracle to
see a good, solid entertainment hit,
even one that's 15 years old.
In 1933 Charles Laughton won an
Academy Award for his portrayal
of "Henry VIII." The intervening
years have not dimmed the pic
ture's Academy luster. For those
afraid to see a movie with such a
forbidding title, it is necessary to
say that Laughton in "Henry VIII,"
now at the Park Theater, is as
coarse and comic as good King
Harry himself.
Excellent Cast
Laughton is ably assisted by an
excellent cast that includes Merle
Oberon, Robert Donat, Binnie
Barnes, and John Loder, but the
chief ; cene - stealer is Eisa Man
chester as Anne of Bourbon-Parma.
No. 4 in King Harry's harem.
Although slow-moving in parts,
the picture contains one of the fin
est comic scenes ever screened—coy

Henry's wedding night with his
fourth wife.
'Catherine the Great'
"Catherine the Great," second
feature, is not rave material, but
it is stiil above average. Too many
dramatic events come slowly so
that interest lags. Co-stars Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. and Elizabeth Berg
ner give solid performances, al
though history is slightly twisted
Iq the players' advantage.
