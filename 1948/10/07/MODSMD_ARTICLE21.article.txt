# 'Spectator' Uses Mark Twain Tale
## 
### 
The autumn issue of the Pacific
Spectator, to appear Oct. 15, con
tains a hitherto unpublished story
by Mark Twain about a Mississippi
riverboat skipper and his nerve
racking voyage with a ghost.
The story was probably left at
the home of Mark Twain's sister
before the author came West, and
it was found in Twain's own hand
writing.
Other articles in the Pacific Spec
tator include pieces by five well
known authors: Dixon Wecter,
Wallace Stegner, Richard Lillard,
Miriam Allen deFord, and Howard
M urn ford Jones.
Dr. Stegner, novelist and Stan
ford faculty member, writes on the
demagogic pattern of Father
Coughlin. Wecter tells of death and
burial in southern Califiornia.
Western non-fiction of the past
year is the topic of Lillard's article.
Miss deFord's essay is a biographi
cal postscript on an earlier San
Francisco. "Are Translators Peo
ple?" is the title of the article writ
ten by Jones.
