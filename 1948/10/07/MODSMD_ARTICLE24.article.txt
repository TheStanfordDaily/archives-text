# Lockwood Spends Summer As United Nations Intern
## 
### AL BERRY 
In the pleasant surroundings of
the temporary United Nations head
quarters, Lake Success, New York.
55 students from 33 nations took an
eight-week summer "internship" in
a course that might well have been
titled "United Nations 103.''
To thin, bespectacled Howard
Lockwod, of Toyon, this "intern
ship" was, in part, the realization
of a dream; it was also a lab in
human values and political hopes
As the only Far Western repre
sentative in the training course,
Stanfordite Lockwood became con
vinced that nations and people can
understand each other without re
course to such unhappy things as
atomic bombs and machine guns.
Peace Plans
He also became even more con
vinced that he could be instrumen
tal in helping to achieve an under
standing between nations that
might someday lead to a peaceful
conference between nations. This,
to Howard Lockwood at least, is a
dream v/orth dreaming.
The most important thing about
the "internship" to Lockwood. not
ed in Farm circles for his tireless
work with the lIR, UNESCO, and
SIRO, was not what the 55 trainees
learned about the UN setup, but
what they learned about each other.
All Nations
"We were of all nations and all
creeds. But we lived, played, and
worked together for eight weeks.
It boosted my hopes that maybe the
world can live, nlay, and work to
gether someday."
The only representative from be
hind the iron curtain who was at
Lake Success was a short, stolid
Czech lad who, although he could
speak the official language — Eng
lish—with fair success, would offer
no comment on world affairs. His
thoughts, he explained, were clear
ly outlined in each copy of Pravda,
and all were welcome to learn them
from there. With the exception ol
this fellow, the 55 were very con
genial, Lockwood said.
