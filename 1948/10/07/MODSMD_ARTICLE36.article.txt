## Professors, Student Discuss Berlin Crisis 
### 
(The Daily is trying something new In world events commentary.
Instead of printing the usual personal opinions of former "History 1948"
writers, we are sending a reporter to interview Stanford professors
who have spent dozens of years in the study of the particular topic
under consideration. This week it is "The Berlin Fuse." George Vel
liotes has interviewed Professors Graham Stuart, David Harris, and
foreign student Joe Wiseinger.)
Graham Stuart
Professor Graham Stuart of the Political science department, instructing
international law and international administration courses, has worked
for the State Department in the past years during leaves of absence.
We asked, "What do you think the Russians are up to in Berlin?"
"To get everything they can without going to war," Professor Stuart
answered. "The Russians have a false impression of American inter
national affairs. They see the American election situation and hear all
the election talk. They think we're in a bad way, so they're using the
situation to grab everything in sight. They don't want to go to war,
but if things get too close, war might come."
Speaking of the practices followed by the Russians in the air corridor,
Stuart said, "If a plane of ours is forced down, do you think the Ameri
can people will stand for it?"
The international law professor compared such a possible mishap with
the Panay affair in 1937. "However, the Japs paid the American govern
ment full indemnities and made profuse apologies. But the Russians
probably aren't that way. There wouldn't be indemnities. They're not
that type."
Stuart was asked how he thought the situation might resolve itself.
Security Council
"It's up to the Security Council. If the Russians veto, as probably
they will, then it will go to the General Assembly. The only thing the
assembly can do is to air it.
"However, there's still enough power in the small countries—the Bene
lux group, France and England— to make things difficult for Russia."
"And the next step, sir?"
"Where do we go from there? That's the problem. We'll stay in Ber
lin regardless, unless we're pushed out. And that means war. We've
made too many promises to back down."
Professor Stuart is in favor of America's preparedness measures. He
appends this with the statement that time is on our side. At the same
time, he says, the Germans are getting more hostile to the Russians."
Salvage the UN
"But we've got to salvage the United Nations by making the powers
in it work together." The professor stressed in international law the
observance of treaties is fundamental to social order. Russia's faith in
these matters seems to be quite negative; so Professor Stuart believes
the thing to do is to expel Russia. "If we can prove in the assembly that
Russia broke the rules, we should kick her out."
He continued this thesis by explaining that the group should be rid
of this destructive influence. "It seems Russia went into the United Na
tions to destroy it. The proof oi this is the atomic bomb development
and Russ efforts to stalemate progress in controls."
In summation, Professor Stuart voiced the thoughts of most Americans
"It's about as messy a situation as I've ever seen."
David Harris
Professor David Harris has been on the Stanford faculty for eighteen
years. His field is modern European history. From 1942 to 1947 he
served in the State Department, concerned with political questions relative
to Germany. This summer he served as political adviser to the Secretary
of State in Germany.
Remarking on the long range intentions of the Russians, Harris believes
that the Reus "want us out of Europe'." That is their eventual aim. First,
however, they must get us out of Berlin, then out of Germany.
"I'm not sure when the Russians started out in precipitating the issue,"
Harris said musingly, "but they started pushing ac. soft spots, testing.
They themselves probably had no clear idea of what they were after
exactly."
Hard to Back Down
"Now the Russians may find it difficult to back down from their
assertions that Berlin is an integral part of their zone. They have been
maintaining that we should lose our rights in the area because of our
"conduct'."
Harris said the situation is changed somewhat by putting the whole
matter before the United Nations.
"The main issue behind the whole Berlin blockade question now is what
the United Nations' future is. If it fails on this question, it will be a
lamentable failure."
The phrase "lamentable failure," as employed by the soft-spoken pro
fessoi Haiiis intimates that he means the end of the United Nations as
now constituted.
Joe Wiseinger
Since this is the Stanford slant, the reader might be interested in viewing
some of the comments of a European attending the University.
Joe Wiesinger is from the American zone of Austria. He attended
Innsbruck University studying for law. Here at Stanford, under one
of the foi eign scholarships voted into existence by Stanford living groups,
he is studying political science. He is living at Toyon.
"The Austrians are following the Berlin situation closely. Mainly be
cause they fear what is happening there might happen in Vienna.
When asked whether all Austrians disliked the Russians with the same
intensity, the foreign student smiled and said, "No." The ones in the
eastern part—in the Russian zone—dislike them more. They have seen.
Those Austrians who were Communists, most of them quickly changed
when they saw."
The Austrians view the Berlin gambit with fear. And so does the
rest of Europe. And so do Americans of knowledge. Not because of
physical cowardice, but because they know the uselessness of war, yet
the consequent necessity of spilling blood if pressed to prove the willing
ness to fight for those things called ideals and principles.

The Austrians view the Berlin gambit with fear. And so does the

Instead of printing the usual personal opinions of former "History 1948"

who have spent dozens of years in the study of the particular topic
under consideration. This week it is "The Berlin Fuse." George Vel
liotes has interviewed Professors Graham Stuart, David Harris, and
foreign student Joe Wiseinger.)
Graham Stuart
Professor Graham Stuart of the Political science department, instructing
international law and international administration courses, has worked
for the State Department in the past years during leaves of absence.
We asked, "What do you think the Russians are up to in Berlin?"
"To get everything they can without going to war," Professor Stuart
answered. "The Russians have a false impression of American inter
national affairs. They see the American election situation and hear all
the election talk. They think we're in a bad way, so they're using the
situation to grab everything in sight. They don't want to go to war,
but if things get too close, war might come."
Speaking of the practices followed by the Russians in the air corridor,
Stuart said, "If a plane of ours is forced down, do you think the Ameri
can people will stand for it?"
The international law professor compared such a possible mishap with
the Panay affair in 1937. "However, the Japs paid the American govern
ment full indemnities and made profuse apologies. But the Russians
probably aren't that way. There wouldn't be indemnities. They're not
that type."
Stuart was asked how he thought the situation might resolve itself.
Security Council
"It's up to the Security Council. If the Russians veto, as probably
they will, then it will go to the General Assembly. The only thing the
assembly can do is to air it.
"However, there's still enough power in the small countries—the Bene
lux group, France and England— to make things difficult for Russia."
"And the next step, sir?"
"Where do we go from there? That's the problem. We'll stay in Ber
lin regardless, unless we're pushed out. And that means war. We've
made too many promises to back down."
Professor Stuart is in favor of America's preparedness measures. He
appends this with the statement that time is on our side. At the same
time, he says, the Germans are getting more hostile to the Russians."
Salvage the UN
"But we've got to salvage the United Nations by making the powers
in it work together." The professor stressed in international law the
observance of treaties is fundamental to social order. Russia's faith in
these matters seems to be quite negative; so Professor Stuart believes
the thing to do is to expel Russia. "If we can prove in the assembly that
Russia broke the rules, we should kick her out."
He continued this thesis by explaining that the group should be rid
of this destructive influence. "It seems Russia went into the United Na
tions to destroy it. The proof oi this is the atomic bomb development
and Russ efforts to stalemate progress in controls."
In summation, Professor Stuart voiced the thoughts of most Americans
"It's about as messy a situation as I've ever seen."
David Harris
Professor David Harris has been on the Stanford faculty for eighteen
years. His field is modern European history. From 1942 to 1947 he
served in the State Department, concerned with political questions relative
to Germany. This summer he served as political adviser to the Secretary
of State in Germany.
Remarking on the long range intentions of the Russians, Harris believes
that the Reus "want us out of Europe'." That is their eventual aim. First,
however, they must get us out of Berlin, then out of Germany.
"I'm not sure when the Russians started out in precipitating the issue,"
Harris said musingly, "but they started pushing ac. soft spots, testing.
They themselves probably had no clear idea of what they were after
exactly."
Hard to Back Down
"Now the Russians may find it difficult to back down from their
assertions that Berlin is an integral part of their zone. They have been
maintaining that we should lose our rights in the area because of our
"conduct'."
Harris said the situation is changed somewhat by putting the whole
matter before the United Nations.
"The main issue behind the whole Berlin blockade question now is what
the United Nations' future is. If it fails on this question, it will be a
lamentable failure."
The phrase "lamentable failure," as employed by the soft-spoken pro
fessoi Haiiis intimates that he means the end of the United Nations as
now constituted.

the United Nations' future is. If it fails on this question, it will be a
lamentable failure."
The phrase "lamentable failure," as employed by the soft-spoken pro

Joe Wiseinger
Since this is the Stanford slant, the reader might be interested in viewing
some of the comments of a European attending the University.
Joe Wiesinger is from the American zone of Austria. He attended
Innsbruck University studying for law. Here at Stanford, under one
of the foi eign scholarships voted into existence by Stanford living groups,
he is studying political science. He is living at Toyon.
"The Austrians are following the Berlin situation closely. Mainly be
cause they fear what is happening there might happen in Vienna.
When asked whether all Austrians disliked the Russians with the same
intensity, the foreign student smiled and said, "No." The ones in the
eastern part—in the Russian zone—dislike them more. They have seen.
Those Austrians who were Communists, most of them quickly changed
when they saw."
The Austrians view the Berlin gambit with fear. And so does the
rest of Europe. And so do Americans of knowledge. Not because of
physical cowardice, but because they know the uselessness of war, yet
the consequent necessity of spilling blood if pressed to prove the willing
ness to fight for those things called ideals and principles.

Instead of printing the usual personal opinions of former "History 1948"
writers, we are sending a reporter to interview Stanford professors
who have spent dozens of years in the study of the particular topic
under consideration. This week it is "The Berlin Fuse." George Vel
liotes has interviewed Professors Graham Stuart, David Harris, and
foreign student Joe Wiseinger.)
Graham Stuart
Professor Graham Stuart of the Political science department, instructing
international law and international administration courses, has worked
for the State Department in the past years during leaves of absence.
We asked, "What do you think the Russians are up to in Berlin?"
"To get everything they can without going to war," Professor Stuart
answered. "The Russians have a false impression of American inter
national affairs. They see the American election situation and hear all
the election talk. They think we're in a bad way, so they're using the
situation to grab everything in sight. They don't want to go to war,
but if things get too close, war might come."
Speaking of the practices followed by the Russians in the air corridor,
Stuart said, "If a plane of ours is forced down, do you think the Ameri
can people will stand for it?"
The international law professor compared such a possible mishap with
the Panay affair in 1937. "However, the Japs paid the American govern
ment full indemnities and made profuse apologies. But the Russians
probably aren't that way. There wouldn't be indemnities. They're not
that type."
Stuart was asked how he thought the situation might resolve itself.
Security Council
"It's up to the Security Council. If the Russians veto, as probably
they will, then it will go to the General Assembly. The only thing the
assembly can do is to air it.
"However, there's still enough power in the small countries—the Bene
lux group, France and England— to make things difficult for Russia."
"And the next step, sir?"
"Where do we go from there? That's the problem. We'll stay in Ber
lin regardless, unless we're pushed out. And that means war. We've
made too many promises to back down."
Professor Stuart is in favor of America's preparedness measures. He
appends this with the statement that time is on our side. At the same
time, he says, the Germans are getting more hostile to the Russians."
Salvage the UN
"But we've got to salvage the United Nations by making the powers
in it work together." The professor stressed in international law the
observance of treaties is fundamental to social order. Russia's faith in
these matters seems to be quite negative; so Professor Stuart believes
the thing to do is to expel Russia. "If we can prove in the assembly that
Russia broke the rules, we should kick her out."
He continued this thesis by explaining that the group should be rid
of this destructive influence. "It seems Russia went into the United Na
tions to destroy it. The proof oi this is the atomic bomb development
and Russ efforts to stalemate progress in controls."
In summation, Professor Stuart voiced the thoughts of most Americans
"It's about as messy a situation as I've ever seen."
David Harris
Professor David Harris has been on the Stanford faculty for eighteen
years. His field is modern European history. From 1942 to 1947 he
served in the State Department, concerned with political questions relative
to Germany. This summer he served as political adviser to the Secretary
of State in Germany.
Remarking on the long range intentions of the Russians, Harris believes
that the Reus "want us out of Europe'." That is their eventual aim. First,
however, they must get us out of Berlin, then out of Germany.
"I'm not sure when the Russians started out in precipitating the issue,"
Harris said musingly, "but they started pushing ac. soft spots, testing.
They themselves probably had no clear idea of what they were after
exactly."
Hard to Back Down
"Now the Russians may find it difficult to back down from their
assertions that Berlin is an integral part of their zone. They have been
maintaining that we should lose our rights in the area because of our
"conduct'."
Harris said the situation is changed somewhat by putting the whole
matter before the United Nations.
"The main issue behind the whole Berlin blockade question now is what
the United Nations' future is. If it fails on this question, it will be a
lamentable failure."
The phrase "lamentable failure," as employed by the soft-spoken pro
