campus, with an occasional word
from the "outside.")
New freshmen aren't the only
ones getting lost on campus this
fall. More than one Quad veteran
has been stumped by the prefix
"pe" before the room numbers of
some classes. These wandering
souls might do well to check the
SAC Building.

Cal pledges seem to go in for
mischief in a big way. For the
past two terms various groups of
neophytes have passed up the tra
ditional dishes, silverware, and food
to abduct a president or pledge
master.

Union unit Hawthorne has been
rechristened Casa Espanola, with a
tilde over the "n" and the accent
on the Spanish. The girls make a
valiant attempt to master the lan
guage of the lands to the south,
but find the tongue rather confining
when talking about "that date."

Wondering why critically injured
Virginia Moore was taken to UC
Hospital in SF after a Nevada auto
accident? She wasn't registered
summer quarter and had not pen
ned her signature to a reg book this
fall, leaving her ineligible to bene
fit from the Farm hospitalization
plan.

The story has been going around
about the Toyon resident who
packed up and went to the Village
to take quarters. Before calling the
men in white, his roommates gave
him the third degree. Under pres
sure he said he didn't mind being
cramped with three other guys, but
had enough when he found some
outsider came in and borrowed his
toothbrush. P.S.—What makes him
think the Village is any better?
Your own bed isn't safe there.

Little things little noticed: The
stone plaque to the memory of Le
land Stanford Jr. which adorns one
of the two remaining supports of
the second largest arch in the world
—right at the front of the Quad.
The 100-foot-high monument tum
bled in the 1906 earthquake, and
no one ever bothered to reconstruct
it.

The noon o'clock sight of cars
lining up like taxicabs at Grand
Central Station to pick up pedes
tx-ians bound for the Village heart
ens us. But just try and get a ride
to campus from the Village at 12:45
p.m. on Sunday. No one going our
way?

campus, with an occasional word
from the "outside.")
New freshmen aren't the only
ones getting lost on campus this
fall. More than one Quad veteran
has been stumped by the prefix
"pe" before the room numbers of
some classes. These wandering
souls might do well to check the
SAC Building.

Cal pledges seem to go in for
mischief in a big way. For the
past two terms various groups of
neophytes have passed up the tra
ditional dishes, silverware, and food
to abduct a president or pledge
master.

Union unit Hawthorne has been
rechristened Casa Espanola, with a
tilde over the "n" and the accent
on the Spanish. The girls make a
valiant attempt to master the lan

Wondering why critically injured
Virginia Moore was taken to UC
Hospital in SF after a Nevada auto
accident? She wasn't registered

about the Toyon resident who
packed up and went to the Village
to take quarters. Before calling the
men in white, his roommates gave
him the third degree. Under pres

cramped with three other guys, but

of the two remaining supports of
the second largest arch in the world

The 100-foot-high monument tum
bled in the 1906 earthquake, and
no one ever bothered to reconstruct
it.

The noon o'clock sight of cars
lining up like taxicabs at Grand
Central Station to pick up pedes
tx-ians bound for the Village heart

to campus from the Village at 12:45
p.m. on Sunday. No one going our
way?
