## The 						United States As An Aggressor 
### 
To the Editor:
The chief fallacy in The Daily's
arguments for national "defense"
is the patent assumption that the
United States could never be the
aggressor in a war, or force an un
democratic regime on its people.
The most superficial study of
American histoiy, from the roll of
this country across the Indian and
Mexican land to the fracas in Pan
ama, and the Spanish - American
war, the United States has not been
entirely altruistic in its intentions
and gains.
At present we are bristling with
a 20-billion-dollar armament pro
gram. sole possession of the atomic
bomb, Truman doctrine arms in
China, Greece, Turkey, etc., and
ERP dangling over Europe's non-
Communist governments. How
much "defense" does the world's
richest and strongest country need?
"It can't happen here" is the most
dangerous attitude possible in a de
mocracy. It happened—in Germany.
The governments the United States
is now forcing on foreign peoples
are not democratic. How could our
people prevent a large standing
army from forcing a similar gov
ernment on us?
Before it is too late, we must fight
the draft and every other inroad on

our freedom. I urge peace-loving
students of all political beliefs to
join Students for Wallace in its post
card campaign of protest against
The Daily's policy.
MELANIE lIYMAN
(Although Miss Ilyman is
"pinned" to Wallace, she has
nevertheless made a point missed
by most of the starry-eyed "Oh.
let's not be strong" persons. We
give her credit for that, any
way.—Ed.)
