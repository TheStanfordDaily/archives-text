# Military Training Preserves Ideals

### 
To the Editor:
I should like to ask those who
object to peacetime military train
ing one question: What would hap
pen to our cherished ideals of free

j dom and our material comforts it'
j the United States abandoned all Int
; military machines and men for ;i
policy of intelligent, enlightened
conciliation of world problems?
If we adopted that policy, there
soon would be no world problem,
but merely the personal problems
every American would face living
under Soviet dictatorship.
World conditions shall certainly
change; and if the international sit
uation improves, peacetime trainin
may become unncessary. We are
i not. however, living in the Utopian
future but in the unpleasant pres
| ent.

there could be no compromise
