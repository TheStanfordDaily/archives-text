## Bull Session

With all the western sportswriters practically conceding the Pacific
Coast football championship to the University of California, I'd like to
suggest an appropriate location for the Bears' New Year's Day game.
Modesty (what's that?) prevents me from actually naming the Bowl in

which the Berkeley boys will be playing, but the
location is at Flushing, New York!

Pro and Con? I'm reminded of an old football gag
about the guy who had a long-term contract with a
Bay Area team. He wasn't exactly a '49er with
the San Francisco pros; he was a "99er with the
San Quentin Cons.

One of the funniest bits of radio comedy to hit the
networks yet this fall was Fred Allen's leadoft show
of last Sunday over the NBC web.

People who make a practice of following such things as radio
Hooperatings may recall that in the course of the last few months Allen
has slipped from the top five in popularity to 18th position. The drop
is due to the fact that his show is aired at the same time as the mammoth
giveaway program, "Stop the Music" over the rival ABC network.
Speculation has been rife all summer as to how the veteran comedian
was going to regain his popularity upon returning to the air this month.
His answer came last Sunday when he joined forces temporarily with
Henry (I've lost another sponsor) Morgan to produce a hilarious satire
on "Stop the Music" called "Cease the Melody."
Typical prizes in the giveaway satire were such things as: (1) a choice
of any two floors in the Empire State Building, (2) the gangplank to
the Queen Mary, or (3) the privilege of being left alone with a shovel
for 20 minutes in Fort Knox.
The song to be identified by the listeners was "America," with various
guesses by Allen's "telephone audience" including "A Tree in the Meadow"
and"The Hut Sut Song."
In addition to the satire, Allen has actually guaranteed that anyone
who misses the answer on the real "Stop the Music" show because he is
listening to Allen's program on NBC will be paid by the comedian's
backers the amount which he has lost.
The whole business boils down to nothing but an alley fight (Allen's
Alley?) between NBC and ABC over which of them is going to hold the
listeners for that Sunday hour of 6 to 7 p.m. I have a hunch that, for
the simple reason it has to be good this year, Allen's program is going
to be just that. (Ed. Note: Allen was offered another time —so he wouldn't
have to compete with "Stop the Music"—but he refused.)

And while we're on the subject of radio and gag writing, I noticed the
other day a wire release announcing that a course in writing radio gags
is being offered this fall at Baylor University in Texas.
A NEW joke is expected momentarily.
