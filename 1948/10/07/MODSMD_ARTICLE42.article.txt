## California Novel Gives Character Portrayals 
### 
ANGELO'S WIFE by Virginia My
ers (Bobbs-Merrill)
This book is a first novel by a
California writer. As a first novel,
it is remarkable. In fact, Miss My
ers shows excellent promise.
The story is almost impossible to
outline or condense for the simple
reason that the plot of "Angelo's
Wife" is, in itself, extremely com
plex. Miss Myers has, fact, put
enough material in this 372-page
book to fill a trilogy. Because of
this the action moves very rapidly
over a period of more than 20 years.
Despite an unusually iarge num
ber of characters, the author has
managed to give each one a re
markable description. The reader
has an excellent picture of even
the most minor characters.
The setting is the California of
the 1830's and the old Spanish fam
ilies who owned such large ranches.
There is the historical event of the
decline of the Mission system. Also
there is a remarkable study of the
character and way of life of the
early Spanish families who brought
much of the atmosphere of Old
Spain into California.
For action the author has. be
sides the psychological struggle of
the characters, brought in insanity,
arson, murder, vengeance as well as
such natural phenomena as earth
quakes and fire and disease.
There is no place where the ac-

I (ion lags. However, because of
this, one is often unable to see the
underlying plot but only the ex
citement of the present chapter.
Still, throughout the whole action
there is always the real or implied
presence of the influence of Don
Francisco, the man whose will and
wish affects the life of anyone con
nected with the Estrada family and
their huge estate. For, in Spanish
California, a man was the sole mas
ter of all who lived on his land.
Only one character, the enigmatic
Dona Ysidra, is neglected, as far
I as personality development is con
cerned. This, however, is under
standable considering the amazing
scope of the plot. The author has
1 attempted such an imposing work
j that there is seldom an opportunity
jto cover any single aspect mi
i nutcly.
There book is a marvelous story
of love, hate, murder, and lust,
handled in* a most discreet man
ner. The literary style presents an
encouraging turn toward a more
formal and intelligent expression of
thought.
Therefore, the book can be rec
ommended strongly not only for its
merit as an intelligent piece <>112
writing, but also as a story which
is exciting and interesting. It is a
fascinating narrative which is al
ways capable of holding the read
er's interest.â€”Priscilla Claudius
