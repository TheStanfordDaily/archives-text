# Power Lies in West In Pro Football Race
## NATIONAL 
### JACK BLOOD 
Co - favorites for the National
Football League championship are
the defending title holders, Chicago
Cardinals, and their crosstown ri
vals, the always dangerous Bears.
The Bears moved into first place
Monday night with a hair-raising
28-17 win over the Cards, but the
championship will probably hinge
on their Dec. 12 meeting in Chi
cago.
The champion Cards still have
their "dream backfield" intact for
this year's gridiron wars. Calling
signals and masterminding the team
is peerless Paul Christman. Char
lie Trippi, who can shake oppos
ing tacklevs off like a duck sheds
water, is back at his favorite role
as break - away back and safety
man. Complementing him at the
other half is slippery Elmer Angs
man, Pat Harder, who can go for
those extra yards when they are
needed the most, rounds out the
Cardinal offensive combination.
And if this isn't enough, Marshall
Goldberg and Babe Dimaneheff are
still around to lend a helping hand
to spell the starting four. The Cards
can also field one of the best for
ward walls in the league.
Bears Arc Loaded
Luckman, Lujack, and Layne arc
three good reasons why George Ha
las' big bad Bears should roar again
this year. While Johnny Lujack
and Bobby Layne are slow in
catching afire, Sid Luckman is still
at his peak and headed for another
great year.
"Bulldog"' Turner heads a strong
line also featuring Ken Kavanaugh,
Joe Kolman, Ray Milner, and Bill
Drulis. How can the Bears fail
with such a potent assembly?
Indian Jack Jacobs, veteran Tony
Canadeo, and Earl "Jug" Girard
will be filling the air with passes
while teammates Ed Cody and Ted
Fritiseh roll up yardage on the
ground to make the Green Bay
Packers a constant threat. If either
of the Chicago clubs falters, the
Green Bay boys could take all.
The Los Angeles Rams with Bob
Waterfield and the Detroit Lions
with a new coach. Bo McMillin, are
definitely outclassed but may spring
a few surprises before the season
runs its course.
Eatcrn Division Looks Weak
The Eastern Division will be
weaker this season than it has been
for several years. Neither of the
two perennial favorites, Washing
ton or New York, seems to have
what it takes, and the Philadelphia
Eagles should retain their title,
won last year. Pittsburgh, with a
new coach, John Michelosen. re
placing the late Jock Sutherland,
can't expect to fare as well as last
year's runner -up eleven, while

Boston seems destined for the cold,
dark cellar.
The Eagles hope to shake off their
two rivals with bruising halfback
Steve Van Buren carrying most of
the load. A rookie, Charley Coner
ly, has put new life into the Giants,
last year's cellar occupants,

ly, has put new life into the Giants,
last year's cellar occupants,
Co - favorites for the National
Football League championship are
the defending title holders, Chicago
Cardinals, and their crosstown ri
vals, the always dangerous Bears.
The Bears moved into first place
Monday night with a hair-raising
28-17 win over the Cards, but the
championship will probably hinge
on their Dec. 12 meeting in Chi
cago.
The champion Cards still have
their "dream backfield" intact for
this year's gridiron wars. Calling
signals and masterminding the team
is peerless Paul Christman. Char
lie Trippi, who can shake oppos
ing tacklevs off like a duck sheds
water, is back at his favorite role
as break - away back and safety
man. Complementing him at the
other half is slippery Elmer Angs
man, Pat Harder, who can go for
those extra yards when they are
needed the most, rounds out the
Cardinal offensive combination.
And if this isn't enough, Marshall
Goldberg and Babe Dimaneheff are
still around to lend a helping hand
to spell the starting four. The Cards
can also field one of the best for
ward walls in the league.
Bears Arc Loaded
Luckman, Lujack, and Layne arc
three good reasons why George Ha
las' big bad Bears should roar again
this year. While Johnny Lujack
and Bobby Layne are slow in
catching afire, Sid Luckman is still
at his peak and headed for another
great year.
"Bulldog"' Turner heads a strong
line also featuring Ken Kavanaugh,
Joe Kolman, Ray Milner, and Bill
Drulis. How can the Bears fail
with such a potent assembly?
Indian Jack Jacobs, veteran Tony
Canadeo, and Earl "Jug" Girard
will be filling the air with passes
while teammates Ed Cody and Ted
Fritiseh roll up yardage on the
ground to make the Green Bay
Packers a constant threat. If either
of the Chicago clubs falters, the
Green Bay boys could take all.
The Los Angeles Rams with Bob
Waterfield and the Detroit Lions
with a new coach. Bo McMillin, are
definitely outclassed but may spring
a few surprises before the season
runs its course.
Eatcrn Division Looks Weak
The Eastern Division will be
weaker this season than it has been
for several years. Neither of the
two perennial favorites, Washing
ton or New York, seems to have
what it takes, and the Philadelphia
Eagles should retain their title,
won last year. Pittsburgh, with a
new coach, John Michelosen. re
placing the late Jock Sutherland,
can't expect to fare as well as last
year's runner -up eleven, while

Boston seems destined for the cold,
dark cellar.
The Eagles hope to shake off their
two rivals with bruising halfback
Steve Van Buren carrying most of
the load. A rookie, Charley Coner

last year's cellar occupants,
