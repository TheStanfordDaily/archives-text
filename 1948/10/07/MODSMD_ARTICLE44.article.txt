I After finishing second to the
i Cleveland Browns in the Western
Division last season, the Fankie Al
bert-led San Francisco 49-ers have
won their first six games to become
definite title contenders this year.
In addition to Albert at quarter,
the San Francisco attack is
strengthened by the return of "Big
Chief" Norm Standlee, another ex-
Stanford star, to the fullback post,
and hard - running John "Strike"
Strzykalski at halfback. Bruno Ban
dueci, former Wow Boy, heads a
powerful and alert line. End Alyn
Beals is back to snag Albert's TD
losses.
Browns Are Tough
The Cleveland Browns can't be
counted out of the picture in the
All-America Conference, however.
As long as Otto Graham keeps toss
ing bull's-eyes to two of the best
ends in the league and as long as
Marion Motley bonecrushes his
way through opposing lines, the
Clevelanders will be tough. Paul
Brown's men are unbeaten in five
starts.
The LA Dons and the hapless
Chicago Rockets aren't expected to
trouble the front - running duo in
the Western Circuit despite the ad
dition to their rosters of several
top-drawer college stars. The Dons,
who last year set an all-time pro
crowd record of 82,500 for one
game, have acquired such crowd
pleasers as squirmin' Herman Wc
demyer.
Rockets Are Rebuilding
The near-bankrupt Rockets are
rebuilding on the shambles of last
year's disastrous season with con
tributions from other conference
teams and a new bunch of rookies.
Tex "Kiss and Tell" McKeever be
gins his first season as Rocket boss
and on hand to help him raise Chi
cago out of the cellar are Elroy
Hirsch. tricky running halfback,
All-American tackles Alex Agase
and Ziggy Czarobski, and a host of
other capable performers.
The revitalized Baltimore Colts
arc heirs-apparent to the Eastern
Division crown following the col
lapse of the New York Yankees.
The center of Cecil Isbell's tricky
offense is Y. A. Tittle, former LSU
great. A supporting cast of Charlie
O'Rourke, Jake Leieht. and Hub
Bechtol, pass - snagging end from
Texas, add up to make the Colts the
class of the East this year.
