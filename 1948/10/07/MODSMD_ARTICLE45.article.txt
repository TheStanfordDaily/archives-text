# Sain Pitches Braves to Win Over Indians
## 
### 
BRAVES FIELD, BOSTON, Oct.
(j (/P). â€”Johnny Sain hurled the first
1 to 0 World Series shut-out since
1923 today when he blanked Cleve
land's Bobby Feller to give the Bos
ton Braves the opening game of the
best-of-seven scries before some
39,000 fans.
Sain, the rubber - armed right
hander with the fancy curve ball,
outpitched the great Feller, who
allowed only two hits in a heart
breaking loss. The Indians got four
singles ofl Sain, a 24-game winner
in the regular season.
Holmes Comes Through
Tommy Holmes, the Braves'
chunky little right fielder, drove
home the only run on this chilly af
ternon with a single past third base
scoring pinch runner Phil Masi in
| the last of the eighth.
Cleveland had runners on base in
j five ol the first six frames and it
l appeared only a matter of time
I until they would bust loose, but the
big hit never came when it was
needed.
Masi, running for catcher Bill
Salkeld, was almost caught on a
disputed pick-off play. Photographs
ol the play uphold Boudroau's claim
that he tagged Masi out but the
Indians will not protest.
Spahn Starts Today
Jubilant at Sains magnificent
performance, Manager Billy South
worth announced he would fire
, his second ace. southpaw Warren
Spahn, at the Tribe in tomorrow's
second tussle. Spahn won 15 games
this season, but has been below his
best for several weeks.
Bob Lemon, the former outfielder
who won 20 games in Cleveland's
pennant drive, was Boudreau's
choice to try to tic it up and send
the two clubs into the third battle
at Cleveland on Thursday al! even.
