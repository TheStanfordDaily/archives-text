# Marchie: 'Big Red Machine Will Roll'
## Stanford Will Win Saturday Predicts Coach Schwartz 
### JOHN HALL 
Marchie Schwartz says that
Stanford will beat Santa Clara on
Saturday. The Stanford headman
released that information last night,
after watching his men go through
an impressive practice session for
the second night in a row.
"The boys have looked good all
week. Their spirit is up, and they
really want to win this one. And
I am sure they will do it," said
Marchie.
In view of the fact that Santa
Clara is riding high right now, af
ter having knocked off tough Okla
homa and Fresno State in consecu
tive games, Schwartz' prediction of
victory comes as a slight urprise.
But he has been so well pleased
with the improvement of the squad
this week that he feels sure a win
is in the offing. Every man is sharp.
The new backfield combo of Bobby
Anderson, Jim Nafziger, Emery
Mitchell, and either Rock Campbell
or Tommy Shaw seems to be the
hardest hitting outfit to see action
so far.
Anderson licady to Go
Bob Anderson's return to the
squad could be a big boom in it
self. The long - striding halfback
was a leading ground - gainer in
1 946, but was hampered by injuries
during the 1947 season.
John Rosecrans, rugged center
who has been injured for the last
two games, might also be ready for
Len Casanova's Broncos. Only man
definitely out of the contest will be
the injured end. Ken Rose.
Word from Santa Clara yester
day was that Vern Hare, defensive
ace of the Bronco backfield, is pos
sibly out with a broken jaw. Hare's

i loss could really be noticed ii'
Campbell and Shaw .start hitting
their receivers Saturday.
Best Defense for Cards
Stanford still leads all conference
teams in total defense and in pass
defense. Now, all the Indians need
is an offense. And Marchie has
been working on that. Several pa
; pers have come up with the idea
that a new secret attack has been
planned for Santa Clara, and may
be they're not so far from wrong.
Look for plenty of fireworks this
Saturday.
