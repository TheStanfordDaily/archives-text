# Soccermen Beat SF Slate 5 to 1
## 
### 
Amos Salvador led the Farm soc
cer squad to a 5-1 victory over the
Sl r State Gaters yesterday on the
losers' field. With three goals Sal
vador sparked a driving Card of
fensive. Jerry Taylor and Ara Gal
staun scored the other goals.
State held down the score only
through the great play of goalie
A?evedo who made impossible
saves. The Gators had only two
shots at the Stanford goal all af
ternoon, their tally coming on a
freak play when the ball was hid
den from goalie Walt Dunbar.
Coach Seqfe! praised the defen
sive work of fullback Larry Peter
son and halves Horni Irani and Jar
vis Slade. Also praised was the
passing of the team but he declared
that teamwork was spotty and that
further work is needed to prepare
the Indians for their Saturday clash
with USF here.
