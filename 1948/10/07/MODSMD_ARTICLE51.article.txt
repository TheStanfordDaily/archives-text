# Indians and Broncs Tangle for 30th Time
## 
### 
Stanford meets Santa Clara J
next Saturday for the 30th time
in their vine-clad, boola-boola
! football rivalry. As always the
game will be played in the Sta
dium.
The Indians boast an impressive j
bulge in series victories, having won
1!) to Santa Clara's 9. But that rec
ord is dimmed, almost blackened, by
the fact that the Broncos have i
rolled up 7 wins in the last 10 con
tests. A 7 to 7 tie in 1934 . remains j
as the only deadlock on the records, j
The Stanford-Santa Clara back- 1
| yard rivalry has featured every type j
of football game imaginable. One- j
; point thrillers, lop-sided landslides,

and hardfought free-for-alls h
all had their day.
Last Year, L'gh!
Last year's game was one of
poorest of the entire series. E
clubs had reached a point of stag
tion and decay that was very obvi
on the football field, and the Broi
staggered and slipped to a 13 t
win.
This year's clash promises to 1-
much more fire. It will be more
the old days when such men

and Merriman of Stanford v

for comparison, Santa Clara can !
back to its great Sugar Bowl te
of the late 30's, and to Tony Frc
and Allyn Beals, who led S;
Hlara to an upset win in 1942.
This great football series is 1
rich in tradition, and although
Broncos have had all the best (
in recent years, Stanford too
earned its share of*glory.
New StulT Confusing
It was against Santa Clan

only team to beat Santa Clara di
the entire season.
Largest score of the series bel
to Stanford. It all happened in
when the Cards whooped their
to a 55 to G win. Longest si
j run on the record books is a

associates blasted the Broncos, 1
! 7, in 1941.
Since then, Stanford has man
