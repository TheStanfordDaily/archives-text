# Varsity Scrimmages Frosh, Jayvees
## 
### 
If scrimmages make a ball club.
Stanford's football team ought to
rate high on the list. Yesterday
Coach Marchie Schwartz scrim
maged his varsity twice, first
against the freshmen and then
againt a combination of jayvees and
varsity members.
In the first instance the frosh
were on the offense and aerials
were in fad. The yearlings mixed
a so-so ground game with a fancy
air attack and gained much yard
age. Big Bill McColl, end for the
frush, looked good on the receiving
end of Harry Hn-asian's tosses.
For the varsity it was a combina-

tion of Dave Field, Bob White, Bud
K'ein, and Aubrey Devine in the
backfield.
First- and second-string varsity
men took a hand at advancing the
ball in the second scrimmage and,
with the passing efforts of Don
Campbell and Tom Shaw, managed
to gain ground rather easily. Shaw
worked out for the first time this
week and will be able to go against
Santa Clara on Saturday.
With Gene Martin, Bob Ghilotti,
and Don Enberg as receivers, the
two quarterbacks hit with a regu
larity that belied last Saturday's
aerial showing.
