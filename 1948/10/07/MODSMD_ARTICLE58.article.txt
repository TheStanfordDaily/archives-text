# Bronco-Bustin' Ceremonies Feature 'the Frisco Fiend'
## 
### 
Razzle-dazzle-pumpernickel, sis
boom-bah, Stanford Injuns, Rah,
Rah, Rah!
The sunken diamond, Friday, will
see more than a rally. It will see
more than a personage who has
been called "the most important
man to hit San Francisco since the
UN Conference." It will see a foot
ball team that is going to kick the
stuffings out of the fellers for Santa
Clara, announced Rally co-chairman
Doris Cooper.
The Stanford Band, nicely split in
half, will leave the top of the Row
and Lagunita Court at 7 p.m. and
march toward the Sunken Diamond.
The horn-blowers will be playing
"Come Join the Band."'
At the rally there will be a soul
stirring address by the honored
guest, sometimes known as "the
'Frisco Fiend," (known in the City
as the San Francisco Fiend), and a
lot of ripping rally-life from Tom
Elke, head cheer leader, who is also
known.
Breaking the Bronco is not an easy
process. It will be done on Saturday,
but it must be started on Friday
night. It's Bronco-bustin', so come
join the fun, said Craig Stolle, also
rally co-chairman.
