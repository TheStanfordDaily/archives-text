# Quad to Finish Encina Pictures
## 
### 
All Encina men with initials from
S to Z should report to the Quad
office today to have their frosh
photos taken. Only 150 Encina fresh
men have shown up. Those who
have missd their assigned day may
report tomorrow, but after that
date no more Encina pictures will
be taken.
''Remember." warns Quad Editor
Ted Off, "the same freshman pic
tures will be used in the Quad. If
you fail to have your picture taken
now you will not appear in the
yearbook."
"Coats and ties must be worn,"
concluded Off.
