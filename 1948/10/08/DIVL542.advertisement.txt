At Saturday's White Rose
Ball none other than Xavicr
Cugat will manipulate the
haton.
Why don't you sparkle a 1
gala event in a "Party Line" stiff
taffeta formal stripped in sub
dued tones of chartreuse, burnt
orange, emerald, and sage pur
ple, all of which change to gold
en hues in the light?
Its snug bodice and volumi
nous skirt accent your minute
waist. In back a slight bustle
is topped with two chartreuse
rnses, and stay-up assurance
comes from the halter - like
strap which circles the neck
from the front, adding grace
to your bare shoulders and
back. ($29.95.)
Find it at the Clothes Closet.
Palo Alto's store of smart fash
ions.
