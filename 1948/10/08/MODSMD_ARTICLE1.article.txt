In order to encourage women student? to assume greater re
sponsibility in upholding social regulations, Women's Council
has devised a new demerit system to handle violations and pen
alties.
This plan was discussed by the AWS Cabinet yesterday after-

noon.
Miss Anastasia Brown, counselor
for women, spoke on the history be
hind this proposed change in the
penalty system. She pointed out that
approximately 95 per cent of the
conscientious women students were
unnecessarily penalized for infre
quent violations, while the 5 per
cent of women students who fre
quently violated social rules couldn't
be effectively touched by council.
Demerits Replace Lock-ins
The Demerit System, on the other
hand, would replace the present
system of lock-ins, fines and other
penalties.
Marilyn Janeck, Women's Council
head, presented the plan to thj Cab
inet. She carefully pointed out that
the present plan would be used on
a trial basis.
"It won't go into effect until
everyone understands the plan and
feels that it is an improvement over
the present one," she stated.
Accumulative Record
The Demerit System is based on
an accumulative record which car
ries through the woman student's
entire undergraduate years.
