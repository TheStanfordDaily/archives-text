# White Rose, Rally, Socials Top Weekend
## 
### 
The rally tonight and the big
Sigma Nu formal tomorrow night
provide campus socialites with the
biggest weekend thus far on the
Stanford social calendar.
Top week-end attraction is the
Sigma Nu White Rose Ball from 9
to 1 Saturday night. The Pavilion
will be turned into a magic dance
floor, with music by '"Coogie" Cugat
who has some new arrangements
featuring his magic violin as well
as some new South American spe
cialties.
The ball is formal but dark suits
are permissible for men. Tickets
can still be obtained for $5.50 from
any Sigma Nu member or from
salesmen in front of the Cellar.
Bids will also be sold at the door.
Branner Hosts
For non-sophomores, Branner is
opening its doors to an evening of
dancing and refreshments with
music via recordings.
"It will be a good chance for
some of the Encina fellows to get
acquainted with their classmates
across the way," Martha Miller,
chairman of the open house com
mittee, announced.
Jordan Party
With the game highlighting the
Saturday afternoon entertainment,
many Stanford rooters should build
up quite an appetite before dinner.
Jorc T an House has provided for this
condition in the form of an open
house from 4:30 to 6 p.m. Accord
ing to Fran Wakeman, social chair
man, there will be thirst-quenching
and stomach - filling refreshments
and lots of fun at the house at 620
Mayfield.
