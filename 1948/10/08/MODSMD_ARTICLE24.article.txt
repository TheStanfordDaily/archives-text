# Women Talk Back; Want Football with 'New Look'
## 
### MARY KRAFT JOAN HARZFELD 
Tea time is T-formations time for the Stanford football squad
very afternoon. That's all part of "the great American game
112 football," so they say.
And so are the sore throats we get from rooting every Satur
ay, and the innumerable rallies we attend and the pom-pons

e wave at Tom Elko and company. |
Newspaper sport sections are
lied with the words of wise col
mnists who give learned comments !
n single wings, fade backs, and cof
n corners. Stanford men read and i
elieve what they say.
Nobody, though, ever thinks oi
the women for their views
n the game. A good part of the
rowd which attends each contest is ]
lade up of the fairer sex and it's j
ist possible that they may. have !
nnething to offer in a constructive j
Drt of way.
Padded Players
Those costumes the players wear, I
>r instance.
They talk about women's fashions
eing silly but just look at the
tighty football team. Anyone knows
lat padded shoulders went out last 1
ear. and here are our football play
rs still in last year's styles. Take ;
ff those padded shoulders and hips
nd just what do you have? A
louse of a man you wouldn't look
nice at on Quad!
Football's a wonderful sport to

'.vatch, but who wants to go out
with a man whose front teeth are
blii] in Pullman and whose nose was
put on backwards by the BAC?
You expect tliem to dance, and what
do they do—sit there nursing a
football hangover.
Just Pig Chasers
And there's this training business
—we just love those late milkshake
dates!
Then there's the game itself . . . .
we can think of better ways to "hold
that line" than Marchie Schwartz.
Who wants to spend a whole after
noon. anyway, running after the re
mains of a pig—when they could
have a real live Stanford woman?
Another thing—we just don't un
derstand why they let those little
men in striped suits come down here
every Saturday—there must be pro-
Stanford prisons where we could get
referees.
Bigger Programs
And why don't they make those
programs bigger?—you just can t sit
on them comfortably. We absolutely
demand a full page picture of Rupe

Andrews —if we can't go out with j
him, we can at least sit on him!
Football players are about as
graceful as rhinos walking on eggs—
' those horrible shoes they wear just
I ruin that nice preen lawn. And at
j least they could have "signal cloth"
i numerals so we'll know who to
[ cheer for.
Useful Game
Cheering, of course, is the real
event of the afternoon. Far too much
1 time is devoted to the game. Why
i not more entertainment—say the
i Rockettes as yell leader and Bob I
Mitchum as Little Injun? Lots more I
people would come then, and the '
University could spend some of the
extra money taken in by giving the
players, dancing lessons.
But peculiar as the game of foot-
I ball is, it does serve one useful
function—our phone numbers are
DA - Scott - Titus - Titus - Erickson
! Campbell and DA-Scott-Titus Phle-
I ger-Shaw-Shaw.

Tea time is T-formations time for the Stanford football squad
very afternoon. That's all part of "the great American game
112 football," so they say.
And so are the sore throats we get from rooting every Satur
ay, and the innumerable rallies we attend and the pom-pons

e wave at Tom Elko and company. |
Newspaper sport sections are
lied with the words of wise col
mnists who give learned comments !
n single wings, fade backs, and cof
n corners. Stanford men read and i
elieve what they say.
Nobody, though, ever thinks oi
the women for their views
n the game. A good part of the
rowd which attends each contest is ]
lade up of the fairer sex and it's j
ist possible that they may. have !
nnething to offer in a constructive j
Drt of way.
Padded Players
Those costumes the players wear, I
>r instance.
They talk about women's fashions
eing silly but just look at the
tighty football team. Anyone knows
lat padded shoulders went out last 1
ear. and here are our football play
rs still in last year's styles. Take ;
ff those padded shoulders and hips
nd just what do you have? A
louse of a man you wouldn't look
nice at on Quad!
Football's a wonderful sport to

'.vatch, but who wants to go out
with a man whose front teeth are
blii] in Pullman and whose nose was
put on backwards by the BAC?
You expect tliem to dance, and what
do they do—sit there nursing a
football hangover.
Just Pig Chasers
And there's this training business
—we just love those late milkshake
dates!
Then there's the game itself . . . .
we can think of better ways to "hold
that line" than Marchie Schwartz.
Who wants to spend a whole after
noon. anyway, running after the re
mains of a pig—when they could
have a real live Stanford woman?
Another thing—we just don't un
derstand why they let those little
men in striped suits come down here
every Saturday—there must be pro-
Stanford prisons where we could get
referees.
Bigger Programs
And why don't they make those
programs bigger?—you just can t sit
on them comfortably. We absolutely
demand a full page picture of Rupe

Andrews —if we can't go out with j
him, we can at least sit on him!
Football players are about as
graceful as rhinos walking on eggs—
' those horrible shoes they wear just
I ruin that nice preen lawn. And at
j least they could have "signal cloth"
i numerals so we'll know who to
[ cheer for.
Useful Game
Cheering, of course, is the real
event of the afternoon. Far too much
1 time is devoted to the game. Why
i not more entertainment—say the
i Rockettes as yell leader and Bob I
Mitchum as Little Injun? Lots more I
