# IFC Cracks Down On Illegal Rushing
## 
### 
A set of revised rushing rules,
with emphasis on strict enforcement
and stringent penalties, was passed
last night at a special meeting of
Interfraternity Council, Ted LeVino,
IFC president, disclosed.
The special meeting was held at
the request of the Interfraternity
Board of Control (student-faculty
administration judiciary board) when
it was learned earlier this week that
there had been several flagrant vio
lations of the rules already this
quarter.
Violators will face the following
punishments:
1. Freshmen violating the rushing
rules (as they appear on page 4 of
today's Daily) will not be allowed
to live in a fraternity for six quar
ters (including their freshman year).
2. If a fraternity is found guilty
of violating any of the rules, only
members living in the house at the
time of the violation shall be al
lowed to move into the house the
following fall. (In other words, no
new members may move into the
house during the academic year in
which the violation takes place, nor
during the following academic year.)
Pledging privileges shall be sus
pended also, for the academic year
in which the violation takes place.
