## A 						New Ticket Plan For Married Students 
### 
Stanford boasts the possession of the largest collegiate sta
dium in the world. Ninety thousand seats are but half-filled for
most of our home games; yet, Stanford cannot seat married cou
ples together, all because one of them is not a registered stu
dent at this University.
One of today's Campus Opinion letters comes to us from a
married student who writes that he must buy a full-priced
"ootball ticket in order to sit with his wife at the games. The
Daily sent a copy of the letter to Athletics Director A 1 Masters
.'n order to present both sideo of the issue. From the evidence
provided by the married student and by Mr. MastersT The Daily
offers the following plan to ameliorate a very tough situation.
Since our stadium rarely draws more than half a house (Big
Barnes excepted), the SAC should develop a schedule for next
year whereby married students may occupy a special section
as near the rooters' section as possible. The married student
vould be admitted to the section on his rooters' ticket and stu
dent body card; his wife (or husband) would pay the full general
admission or season pass price. In addition, the student would
Day the approximately $2.75 for the season above the cost of
lis rooter's ticket to cover the cost of federal taxes as described
oy Mr. Masters in point one of his answer.
Present seating arrangements for married couples in our sta
dium are unreasonable. Couples are split, or the student member
must purchase a full-priced ticket to stay with his wife. Such
a plan as outlined above should meet the happy medium with
:he government, the PCC, and the married students. If the mar
lied student is a veteran, his wife may buy a season's pass at
a 25 per cent reduction. The Daily hopes that Mr. Masters can
place a motion on the PCC agenda that would enable wives to
purchase the lower-priced rooters' tickets.
Rooters' sections at school contests do not exist just for the
sake of rooting. Such special sections exist for registered stu
dents in order to give them the best opportunity to see their
leam in action at the lowest reasonable cost. Such a section
should be created for the married students.â€”L. L.
