# Indians Prepare to Tame Buckin' Bronc Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
The Stanford Indians and the Santa Clara Broncos, each wanting a win in the worst way, will
meet tomorrow in the Stanford Stadium at 2:30.
For the Broncos it is a case of winning one from a Pacific Coast Conference team and continu
ing a two-game winning streak. A win over Stanford would more than suffice in both cases.
For the Indians, this is the one that they must win before they can even begin a winning
streak. This is the game that they must have to show the home fans that last week's WSC loss

was just a mistake. A win for the
Broncs will even up their season's
record with two wins and two losses.
Marchie Predicts Win
After putting his gridders through
a week of scrimmages and work on
an aerial attack, Card coach Marchie
Schwartz has flatly predicted a win
for his men. Betting markets take a

Pom-poms for tomorrow's game
will be on sale for the last time
tonight at the women's residences
and at the Stanford-Santa Clara
rally. Meanwhile, Klahoya wom
en will maintain their booths in
front of the Post Office, Cellar,
History corner, and on Quad,
where students can buy the
pom-poms for 25 cents.

calmer view and rate the tilt a
toss-up or a win by one point for
the Broncos, depending on where
you take your business.
In the two games since the war,
the teams have split, the Cards win
ning 33 to 26 in 1946 and the Bron
cos coming out on top 13 to 7 in a
ragged contest last year. So this is
the rubber match of the postwar era
and a convincing win for either
team will go a long way in bolster
ing morale for coming games.
Don Campbell Captain
Schwartz has chosen quarterback
Don Campbell to captain a Card
squad that will be missing only one
regular but with several vital men
on the "limited action list." Ken
Rose, end, is out of the game with
an injured ankle. Centers Jim Cas
tignoli and John Rosekrans, with
fullback Marty Anderson, are slated
to play but will be favoring in
juries.
Schwartz will go along with the
starting lineup that began the WSC
game. A 1 Laakso and Dan Mervin
will be the ends with Gordon White
and A 1 Rau at tackles. Don Fix and
Jack McKittrick will start at the
guard spots and Jack Barnes will
handle the center chores.
Starting Backfield
The starting backfield will be made
up of Bob White at right half, Dave
Field at left half, Emery Mitchell at

ullback, and captain Campbell at
luarterback.
Sometime in the game Schwartz
ntends to field a backfield made up
>112 Bob Anderson, Jim Nafziger,
Vlitchell, and either Campbell or
Tom Shaw. Anderson, able to play
or the first time this season, should
<ive added blocking strength to a
tackfield made up of power runners.
Jud Klein, who averaged 10 yards
jer carry last week, will see a lot of
iction. as will Boyd Benson.
Many eyes will be focused on
•lusive Bob White, newest star on
he Card gridiron scene. White has
veraged over seven yards per carry
n (he last two games from his right
lalf spot.

the Broncos, depending on where

In the two games since the war,
the teams have split, the Cards win
ning 33 to 26 in 1946 and the Bron
cos coming out on top 13 to 7 in a
ragged contest last year. So this is
the rubber match of the postwar era
and a convincing win for either
team will go a long way in bolster

Don Campbell Captain
Schwartz has chosen quarterback
Don Campbell to captain a Card
squad that will be missing only one
regular but with several vital men
on the "limited action list." Ken
Rose, end, is out of the game with
an injured ankle. Centers Jim Cas
tignoli and John Rosekrans, with
fullback Marty Anderson, are slated
to play but will be favoring in
juries.
Schwartz will go along with the
starting lineup that began the WSC
game. A 1 Laakso and Dan Mervin
will be the ends with Gordon White
and A 1 Rau at tackles. Don Fix and
Jack McKittrick will start at the
guard spots and Jack Barnes will
handle the center chores.
Starting Backfield
The starting backfield will be made
up of Bob White at right half, Dave
Field at left half, Emery Mitchell at

ullback, and captain Campbell at
luarterback.

plays that can break a runner away
from any spot on the field.
The Stanford Indians and the Santa Clara Broncos, each wanting a win in the worst way, will
meet tomorrow in the Stanford Stadium at 2:30.
For the Broncos it is a case of winning one from a Pacific Coast Conference team and continu
ing a two-game winning streak. A win over Stanford would more than suffice in both cases.
For the Indians, this is the one that they must win before they can even begin a winning
streak. This is the game that they must have to show the home fans that last week's WSC loss

was just a mistake. A win for the
Broncs will even up their season's
record with two wins and two losses.
