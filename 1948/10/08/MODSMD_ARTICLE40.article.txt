## Ticket Sales Irks Student 
### 
To the Editor:
A great deal of hard feeling is again in store at Stanford as the student
game ticket sales wind up.
I am speaking of the problem every married student, and there are
Quite a number, has faced during the past several years as football
season commences.
Now I like football games, but I also enjoy the company of my wife.
J can, and have, purchased student tickets. I can also purchase regular
price tickets for my wife. But can we view the game tobether? Heck no!
Not without doing one of the following:
1) Purchase two regular tickets.
2) Go off the deep end and buy the poor girl a season ticket, which is
still the same price as at the beginning of the season although two games
have been played.
3) Try the illicit practice of negotiating tickets with a fellow student,
which is often undertaken.
It would seeni to me that a regular price ticket should admit a student
escorted girl to the rooters' section, or that a student ticket admit to
the less desirable sections of the stadium.

(Editor's Note: Director of Athletics A 1 Masters explained the diffi
culty of seating married couples as follows:
1. Federal tax laws rule that non-students must pay the full federal
tax on their tickets if they sit within a rooters' section. Conversely, a
.student sitting in the general admission seat with only a rooter's ticket
must also pay the full federal tax. Thus, married couples must be sep
arated if one holds a rooter s ticket while the other party possesses a
general admission of season pass.
2. Pacific Coast Conference contracts among member universities
prohibit price reductions for spectators other than bona lide students.
One exception exists. Wives of student veterans may purchase a sea
son pass at a 25 per cent discount. Mr. Masters said this ruling could
be placed to the PCC agenda when the representatives meet during the
first week in January.

Athletic Council on the football ticket problem confronting married
students.)
