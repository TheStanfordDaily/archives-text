# More Troy Reports Requested
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Any student of archaeology, such as I. must be waiting anxiously for
further reports from the Stanford group re-exploring the ruins of ancient
Troy. The discoveries hinted at in the first report from the group, which
was printed in Wednesday's Daily, provides a whole new perspective on
the classical accounts of the destruction of the antique city.
Is it possible that the weapon "which can be described only as a toma
hawk." according to the report, is of North American origin? And if so,
what role did it play in the downfall of the Greek citadel? At what
remote time did the cultural exchange of implements take place, or is it
possible that the doomed city was actually overshadowed by a branch
of the American Indian family tree?
By all means, keep us informed of the reports received from this pio
neer group. Here is a truly great news story!
