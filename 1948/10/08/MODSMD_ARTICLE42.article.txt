# What Price Glamor!

### BOB SEDERHOLM 
I here is rather an interesting
medical specimen in the bunk just
above me. He has been lying there
about three days—ran up against
the Stanford dating problem. This
poor wretch has been babbling
more or less incoherently most of
the time, but in his more lucid mo
ments has related the terrifying
story fo his incapacitation. But let
him tell the story in his own words.
I had been admiring one of the
campus glamour queens (he nar
rated) the whole school year. Even
by outside standaids she is not so
bad. In addition, she is one of those
young people who are referred to
by high schol principals and uni
versity presidents (usually with a
deepening of the voice) as a "school
leader." I lonped passionately to
make a date with my dream girl,
but she was a queen, and I was but
an insignificant frosh. And no one
offered me r glass slipper.
I finally found the courage to
phone the 'ovely one and ask for a
date. Much to my surprise, I got
•he date—- nd only three weeks in
advance! I immediately laid plans
for a bio evening at one of the city's
finer night spots. However—as the
lovely one was never in her room
except between 10:30 p.m. and 8
a.m., which coincides with the off
duty hours of the switchboard op
erator—l was unable to contact her
again until 10:25 one evening two
days before the fateful date. At that
time, she informd me that she
wanted to go to the Sophomore
Carnival that same night and that
she would only stay out until mid
night. Needless to say. we compro
mised on the carnival and the mid
night parting.
Now I'm not such a bad fel'ow. I
get decent grades, HAD a lot of
confidence, drive a fair-looking car,
and use Burma - Shave faithfully.
The night of the big date I put on
my best suit, a generous applica
tion of Old Spice, pnd set out to
pick up the lovely one at the ap
| pointed place — a fraternity house
where she had been invited to din
ner.
As I was a little I entered
the place rather timidly but spot
ted my dream-girl and strolled
over to pick her up. Before I had
gotten half-way across the room,
she leaped to her feet and started
across the room toward me; but to
my surprise she sailed right past
and came to a halt at the front
window, frowned, and said, "Where
IS that damned fool?" I approached
her like a neurotic spaniel who had
been bad on the rug. "Uh. looking
for me?" She took a good look and,
unabashed, said, "Yes." The eve
ning was off to a flying start.
A few minutes later, I ushered
her into a local bistro. Things got
no better. Physically, she was with
me; mentally, she was at every ta
ble and chair. She waved to more
people than a national hero riding
down Fifth Avenue. I wasted some
of the best lines from "0 Mistress
Mine" during this period. She gave
me two nods and an "ugh." I felt
as sophisticated as a rag doll. After
I had kicked her in the shins twice
(and myself in another place many
times), she settled down—told me
all about the proven qualifications
of a sophomore ex-com member
and other pertinent information as
to what turns the larger wheels of
the campus. I finally managed to
get the party on a tete-a-tete basis.
I had begun to operate. The time
passed pleasant'y, excitingly. My
confidence began to come back. It
was spring, and God looks after
Stanford students who pay their
tuition and are plus 20. I had a
pleasant three-drink mental image
of myself WHEELING in MY gal
to the carnival and basking in the
envious glances of the less-fortu
nate roughs.
As we entered the carnival, the i
lovely one with her arm linked in
mine, I was at the height of my
glory. Then the "less - fortunate '
roughs" spotted us. and suddenly I
realized that this wasn't a gir! I
was with, it was a magnet. By the
time I had pulled myself together, j
I was on the outskirts of a large
crowd.

The next time I caught sight of
my pill, she whs working in one
of the kissing concessions. Every
body on the campus was kissing her

but me. I bought 10 tickets in an
effort to draw the lucky number;
I never won. I finally went to the
blackjack booth and lost heavily.
At a quarter to 12, I went to pick
up the lovely one. She was gone,
lost forever. "The curfew shall not
ring tonight, damn the torpedoes,
death where is thy sting?"—where
is the nearest bar?
