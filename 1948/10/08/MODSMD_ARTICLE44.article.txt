In contrast to the headline in last
Friday's Daily —"Davis Says No
Progress on Fraternity Robberies"—
the Daily Californian of a few
weeks back had this one—"Woman
Confesses Wheeler Thefts."
Miss Marian Stader, who was not
a student at Cal. had been stealing
purses for two semesters that for
getful and careless students were
leaving around the lounge of
Wheeler Hall.
Working with the police, two
students, Charlotte Gutmann and
Pat Working, both victims of the
then unknown thief, left a ''dum
my' purse in the lounge. Waiting
until Miss Stader was seen picking
it up and leaving the building, they
followed her to a nearby cafe. The
two women then called the police,
who lodged Miss Stader in the
Berkeley jail. Bail was set at $4,000.

| A suitable one, that applies here,
j can be taken from a news story
that appeared a while back in the
Daily Kansan warning students at
the University of Kansas to watch
| out for thefts in fraternity and so
i rority houses.
The moral goes like this:
Its much easier to prevent a
: thel't than to find a thief."
In a lighter vein, Walt Mitchell
of the Fresno Collegian comes up
with a few stock rules to raise
: your standing with the professors
; and, subsequently, the grade aver
, age.
Some may be old to you, some
' new.
1. Get a seat in the front row.
2. Cackle loudly at all of your
| professor's jokes.
3. Visit with the professor at least
two minutes after each class.
4. Date the departmental assist
ant.
5. Let the professor know that
you were both in the same branch
of the service.
fi. Ask for additional source rcad
| ing.
7. If you can find them, give the
professor clippings pertaining to the
| course and his lectures.
8. Date the departmental assist
; ant.
