starred on the 1922-23 Bronc elev- j
ens. He established a punting rec- '
ord in the 1923 St. Mary's game by
kicking the ball to the St. Mary's I
one-yard line, while standing on
his own one. In 1928 he became '
head coach at Sequoia High School !
in Redwood City, and turned out ;
two championship teams before :
moving to Santa Clara as assistant :
to "Buck" Shaw in 1936.
BILL RENNA Santa Clara's 220-
pound center, was starting center
last year after being converted from
lull. He played two years of foot
ball at Menlo JC before transfer
ring to the Mission university. A
senior, Renna rates with the top
pivot men on the coast.
MICKEY ADZA, Renna's under
study, is another big man, weigh
ing in at 210 pounds. Mickey has
won two letters at Santa Clara. He
was an All-League center in his |

j high school days at Loyola High in
LA.
VERN STERLING, the Broncos'
j starting left guard, throws his 192
' pounds around with authority. The
rugged junior hails from Menlo
Park, and was one of Santa Clara's
i outstanding guards last season.
! Alert, aggressive. Sterling set up
I two Bronco scores by recovering
j Fresno State fumbles inside the
: Fresno 20-yard line.
JOHN JUSTICE moved into the
Bronco starting lineup at right
guard last week against Fresno
State. John was a bulwark of de
i fense last year on the freshman
squad as a tackle. The Los An
geles boy is another heavyweight,
tipping the scales at 210.
DON NEIHAUS, two - year letter
man, was an All - City center at
Gonzaga High School, Spokane,
Washington. The 205-pound jun
ior was converted to a guard two
years ago, and the switch didn't
I slow him down a bit.

JOHN HOCK, 215 - pound lineman
from Los Angeles, starts at left
tackle for the Broncos. John is a
junior this year, holds two varsity
letters. Hock is also a member of
the wrestling team.
TOM PAYNE, starting right tackle,
is tabbed by many observers as
Santa Clara's best lineman. He was
a starter last year even though only
a sophomore. He carries 195 pounds.
Payne is from Tacoma, Washing
ton.
ELLERY WILLIAMS, 180 - pound
end. holds down the left flank of
the Bronco line. He transferred
from Muir JC last year. Williams
is fast and adept at snagging the
pigskin at full speed.
JIM BUCKLEY, San Mateo junior,
has been in the starting lineup off
and on during the past two seasons.
Jim is another two-year letterman.
The 195-pound end also has quite
a reputation as a boxer. Stanford
Coach Ray Lunny says that Jim is
on of the best collegiate* heavy

weights that he has seen in a long
time.
DON KECK, another strong end on
the Bronco squad, will start on the
right flank tomorrow. The 190-
pound junior from San Francisco
holds one varsity letter.
BILL SHERIDAN, tranfer from
Menlo JC. is the Broncos' number
one signal caller. The 150 - pound
senior was starting quarterback on
last year's squad. He played a tre
mendous game in Santa Clara's
victory over Oklahoma, passing for
two touchdowns and scoring a
third on a botleg play.
AL MARTIN. Sheridan's relief, is
an experienced quarterback, hav
ing already won two letters, but
lacks Sheridan's flash. The 175-
pound senior from San Mateo is
also a letterman in basketball and
tennis.
MOSES CHAVEZ, qb. 175-pound
senior from Los Angeles, is Santa
Clara's place-kicking specialist. He
can also handle the T-formation ca

j pably. A two-year letterman.
HALL HAYNES is the sparkplug
' of the team, operating out ot his
left halfback spot. Haynes wa
rated by most newpaper writers as
, the best man on the field in the
| Santa Clara-California game, run
ning for all three of Santa Clara's
; touchdowns. The 180-pound jun
ior is a very good left-footed kick
er, but is better known for dariim
1 open field running.
VERN HARE, Haynes' runninu
mate at right half, is a 173-pounu
scatback who is as good on defense
las any back on the squad. Hare
broke his cheekbone in practice,
and may not play tomorrow.
1 RAUL CONN, Haynes' teammate at
j Pasadena, is another sharp running
j halfback, who is counted on for a
j lot of action. Raul is a 182-pound
j junior with one letter to his credit.

I backfield at the fullback post. Jiir.
| played behind Bill Prentice for two
| years. A junior and 195 pounds.
