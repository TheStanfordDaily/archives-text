# Sports Scribes Try Again; Pick Red Machine to Win
## 
### 
Whew! This business of pick
ing (or should I say trying to
pick) Saturday winners is get
ting tough. They say that foot
ball is returning to normal.
Could be. The dope sheet and the
performance book don't seem to
mean a thing.
Last week we could have almost
done better Hipping a coin. Nine
wins, five misses, and one tie add
up to give the Daily experts a pal
try .643 batting average.
This week's guest expert is Ray
Hammett, backfield coach for Mar
chie Schwartz' Stanford varsity.
Mr. Harmmett tags along with the
consensus except that he picks
Rice, Yale, Duke, and Purdue.
