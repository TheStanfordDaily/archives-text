# Improved Broncs Prepared for Indians
## Rated Even Match Rated Evei Match 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Broncos of Santa Clara
are riding high now with two
ronsecutive victories under
their belts. After bowing to Cal
in their opening game, the
Santa Clarans came from behind to
whip Oklahoma the following week
and last Saturday humbled a weak
Fresno State outfit 45 to 7.
The team has improved steadily
from week to week and should be
well primed for its traditional en
counter with the Indians.
Santa Clara wasn't hit too hard
by graduation, the biggest losses
being Bill Prentice, Bill Crowley,
and Guy Giacopuzzi.
Casanova Sicks with T
The Broncs have the necessary
well - balanced backfield for the
operation of the T formation which
Coach Len Casanova still uses.
The broken-field running of hall
back Hall Haynes furnishes the
Broncos with a real breakaway
threat. In the California game
Haynes scored all three of Santa
Clara's touchdowns, and two of
them were on long runs. Haynes'
running, coupled with Billy Sheri
dan's passing from the quarterback
spot, gives the Broncs a diversified
attack.
Sheridan also uses the "bootleg
play" (a la Frankie Albert) to good
advantage. In the Oklahoma game
it was Sheridan's 19 - yard run
around left end for a touchdown
that turned the tide in favor of |
the Broncos.
Renna Sparks Linemen
The standouts in the line are big
Bill Renna and Tom Payne. Renna
is a 220-pounder who was shifted
from fullback to center, and this
year looms as one of the top pivot
men on the Coast while Payne is '
playing his third year as number
one light tackle.
The two lines are just about even ;
as far a weight is concerned. Both
the Indians and the Broncs have a
line average of 200 pounds; the
Broncs have an eight-pound ad- j
vantage in ths backfield.
Current odds rate the two teams I
about even, which is as it should ]
be. Neither the Cards nor the ;
Santa Clarans have reason to be !
overconfident from past perform- !
ances, and a victory Saturday j
would be quite a morale booster I
for either team.
