BRAVES FIELD, BOSTON, Oct.
7 (/P).—The favored Cleveland In
dians came back behind Bob Lem
on today to clip the Boston Braves
i 4 to 1, and square the World Series
at a victory apiece as the play-ofTs
moved west for the next three
games.
Partly recovered from the batting
palsy which afflicted them against
shut - out Johnny Sain in yester
day's opener, the American League
kings rocked southpaw Warren
Spahn from the hilt in a fourth
and fifth-inning uprising and went
on to win easily behind Lemon's
gilt-edged curving.
The Indian chucker, who deliv
ered a total of 10 shut-outs for the
Tribe in the regular season, would
have blanked the National League
champs but for an error by second
baseman Joe Gordon which led to
an unearned run in the first in
ning.
Lemon's performance was not
quite as spectacular as Bobby Fel
;er's losing two-hitter of the pre
vious day. The Braves roughed him
up for eight hits, the same number
Cleveland got off Spahn, Charlie
(Red) Barrett, and Nelson Potter. •

But (he Cleveland star was superb
in the clutches and was aided by
two fancy double plays.
Tomorrow in Cleveland's huge
Municipal Stadium, it will be Gene
Bearden for the Indians against
Vernon Bickford, crack
rookie righthander of the Braves.
