he goal amidst the protesting efforts
'112 three so-called pass defenders
.nd stepped across for the score.
Campbell Fumbles
The Cards threatened to score
arly in the first period. Following
he opening kickoff when Santa
?lara failed to gain, Hall Haynes
kicked to Dave Field who returned
to the Stanford 38.
From here the Indians drove to
the Santa Clara 18-yard line as a
result of a 12-yard run by Bob
White and a 27-yard prayer pass
from Campbell to Gene Martin. But
at this point CampboJl fumbled and
Santa Clara took over. This was
the closest the Indians came to
scoring until they hit pay dirt early
in the fourth quarter.
The Santa Clarans manufactured
their first touchdown in the opening
minutes of the second period as Paul
Conn sped across from 19 yards out
to climax a 54-yard march. On the
scoring play Conn was seemingly
stopped on the 5-yard line, but he
shook ofT three tacklers and crossed
the goal standing up. Chavez's con
version attempt was wide.
After the next kickoff, the Cards
put together a drive with Mitchell
and Jim Nafziger doing the heavy
duty which carried to the Bronco
39 where Nafziger fumbled, and
Santa Clara recovered.
Martin to Williams
Following an exchange of punts
the Broncs went all the way to pay
dirt on three plays from the Stan
ford 47, the touchdown coming on a
pass from Martin to Williams who
caught.the ball on the 20 and scam
pered the remaining distance un
molested. Chavez converted to make
the count 13 to 0. and the 35.000 sat
back, anticipating the slaughter.
The initial Indian score climaxed
a 49-yaiinl- march. With Aubrey De
vine effectively operating the T,
and Emery Mitchell and Nafziger
doing the power running, the Cards
scored on the first play of the fourth
quarter as Nafziger boomed over
from five yards out. Mitchcll's con
version made it 27 to 7.
In the closing minutes of play
Gus Hakeem fumbled on his own
36 and Don Enberg recovered for

Mitchell's pass to Laakso gave the
Cards a first down on the 15, and fol
lowing a series of short gains, Rupe
Andrews circled left end for the tally.
Mitchcll's conversion with Devine
holding made the final count 27 to 14.
Mitchell Best Back
Standouts for the Indians were
Mitchell, Devine and Mervin. Mitch
ell, without a doubt, was the best
back on the field. McKittrick and
Fix played their usual workmanlike
game at guards.
For the Broncos, Vern Sterling
and Tom Payne were the big guns
in the line. Fast-charging Sterling
was the man who caused the In
dian quarterbacks to bobble the ball
all afternoon.
Prc-game activities included the
grand entrance of a certain yell
leader who had himself rolled down
the rooting section, and an Indian
who came running on the field chas
ing a Bronco.
