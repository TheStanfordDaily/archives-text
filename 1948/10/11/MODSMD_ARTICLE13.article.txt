# YWCA Drive Starts Today

"Why should I join the YWCA?"
During the fall membership drive
this week, that question will be
answered, promises YWCA President
Sally Brown. Girls will be available
in each women's residence to answer
all questions and to collect the non
compulsory dollar membei - ship fee.
"All girls are invited to join the
YWCA, whether they feel they
should pay the dollar or not," ex
plained Miss Brown.
Last year the membership totaled
825 but this fall the goal is 1,000.
The YWCA officers feel that once
the girls enter into "Y" programs
they will see the importance of the
organization's work. Many girls
have gotten their start in student
activities through work in the
YWCA, Miss Brown pointed out.
"The Y program is so broad that
any girl can find some work that
particularly interests her," she con
tinued. Each class has a special
project. For example, the fresh
men's function is the annual straw
berry brunch during the Con Home
drive.
The Stanford "Y," according to
Miss Brown, has received national
recognition as one of the largest and
most active student organizations on
the Coast. This year the National
Convention of the YWCA will meet
in San Francisco in March. Both
Cal and Stanford will be the student
leaders and each will be represented
with large delegations, she added.
To remain a large organization, it
is imperative that the membership
drive be a success. And it can't be
a success, "Y" members feel, unless
there is real student interest. The
membership fee is not as important
as the work of the members, stresses
the council.
