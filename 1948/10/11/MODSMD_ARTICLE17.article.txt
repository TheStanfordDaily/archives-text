# Student Services Alleviate Difficulties of job Hunters
## 
### 
Three Stanford services stand
ready to assist studenta who are
seeking part-time work, permanent
employment, or vocational guidance.
The three offices, the Appointment
Service, the Student Employment
Service, and the Veterans' Admin
istration vocational guidance serv
ice are housed under one roof in
temporary building C behind the
Education Building.
The appointment Service, directed
by Dr. Robert N. Bush, finds perma
nent employment for Stanford stu
dents when they graduate and as
sists alumni in seeking advance
ments in the business and profes
sional world.
The service's first step in finding
a job for a student is making his
acquaintance. The student then fills
out an enrollment form giving his
background and experience. After
an interview with the Service, a job
is sought for the student.
Contacts Employers
Here the Appointment Service
takes the initiative in notifying the
applicant when an employer in his
field visits the campus. It also sup
plies him with the name of an em
ployer whom the student may con
tact himself.
Last spring, 130 employers and ap
proximately 300 school representa
tives visited the Appointment Serv
ice here in search of employees.
Fields in which there is the
greatest demand for employment are
sales, retail store merchandising, ac
counting and almost all engineering
and technical fields. Elementary

school teachers and physical science
and industrial arts instructors for the
secondary schools are also needed.
Besides finding jobs for students,
the Service also supplies employers
with confidential information about
prospective employees. The service
is also equipped to give vocational
guidance to persons in doubt as to
their employment desires and capa
bilities.
Vocational Guidance
For veterans, the VA handles com
plete vocational guidance." This serv
ice is located in room 10 of tem
porary building C, and is directed
by Lewis Day.
Interviews are held with veterans,
after which they are given a series
of ability, apitiude and interest tests,
usually about six out of a group of
40 available. Another interview is
then held with the counselor to dis
cuss the results of the tests.
The third service, the one which
is of the most concern to students
seeking part-time work during
school or holidays, is the Employ
ment Service. This office is directed
by Mrs. Clotilde Edwards, and is lo
cated in room 10 also.
Aside from students, the Employ
ment Service is also available to
students' wives and outsiders who
are being sought for University
employment.
Four types of employment are
handled by the Service â€”permanent
pait-time jobs; temporary pick-up
jobs such as gardening and moving;
jobs in return for room and board;
and jobs for non-students.
