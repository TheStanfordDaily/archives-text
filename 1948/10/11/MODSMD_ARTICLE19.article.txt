### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Soft dance music from the radio |
at the D.U. party Friday night was i
broken by a cryptic announcement: I
"News has come of a disaster in the
San Francisco area."
A few seconds later a hysterical 1
newscaster broke in with, "An earth
quake has struck San Francisco,
the damage extending south to Red
wood City. Large buildings have
toppled in the downtown area and
scores of deaths are being reported."
After a few seconds' pause, the news
caster continued in his gravest voice.
"'There is a possibility that the dis
aster is the result of an atomic bomb |
exploded in the Bay."
The Stanford women at the party
huddled close to the radio. Those

living near the campus tried to call
home. One began to scream, as the
radio gave forth with interviews
with men whose homes had been
destroyed.
Upstairs the brothers chuckled as
they emoted into their wire recorder.
Other brothers held their dates close
to comfort them. For a few moments
all was bliss—until the intelligent
women wondered why the earth
quake (now nearing Stanford)
hadn't caused the ground to vibrate.
They looked sheepishly around as
the radio went back to soft dance
music.
