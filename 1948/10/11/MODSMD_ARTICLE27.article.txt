# Mail Deluge Swamps Stanford Post Office; Difficulty in Keeping Service Up to Standard
## 
### 
The usual beginning - of - school
deluge of mail is swamping his post
office, says Superintendent John
Callahan. Between the piles of
laundry cases and the bundles of
letters from worried mammas, his
men are having a hard time keep
ing service up to par. Within 30
days, however, he expects a 150 per
cent reduction in volume of in
coming mail.
The post office's biggest problem
is parcel post. Congestion would be
relieved if packages were called for
promptly. Many parcels are badly
wrapped. When such bundles split
open, post office personnel are
treated to the sight of pillows, note- ,
books, pin-ups, flat irons, cushions !
from an overstuffed chair, cookies j
(which the post office people are ;
not allowed to sample), silk panties, '

and, once, even a pair of pink
sponge-rubber falsies.
Badly addressed mail is another
bottleneck. "Joe Bio, Stanford,
California" is what Superintendent
Callahan considers an unsatisfac
tory address. Have your corre
spondents include your PO box
number, your house, or general de
livery in your address, he pleads.
In addition to handling campus
mail, the post office handles pri
mary distribution for the Village
post office and furnishes special de
livery service for both Village and
campus.
Shortage of campus PO boxes
j makes general delivery a large
! department. Approximately 13,000
j letters are handled daily for the
j 1,350 callers. The general delivery
I men have become students of hu-

I man natureâ€”practically from force
: of necessity. They say that when
I a girl makes a haul of about three
j letters she jumps up and down
i gleefully as she utters happy little
shrieks of joy. A boy, on the other
hand, upon receiving his mail,
slowly passes each fragrant note
under his nose, finally stopping on
that certain letter with an, "Ahh,
Francie!"
