## Bull Session

In Friday's edition of The Daily, two of this paper's fairest of the fair,
Mary Kraft and Joan Harzfeld, took it upon themselves to present a
girl's view of football. Included in their pearls of wisdom was a sen
tence which went like this: . Who wants to spend a whole after
noon, anyway, running after the remains of a pig, when they could

have a real, live Stanford woman?
No comment!

Mike Durkett, the man with the fourth-down toe,
has discovered that it pays to voice one's complaints.
(Or does it?)
It seems that Mike has been moaning that even
though he is a hasher at Storey House, he has never
had a chance to kiss any of the girls when they have
birthdays. Well, he had a birthday himself last Friday,
and the Storey girls put a little reverse English on
the kissing tradition. One by one, they filed out into

the kitchen and planted a kiss on "The Toe," while he changed colors
like a chameleon, and his fellow hashers went into hysterics.

Even though the Administration apparently doesn't agree with me on
the humor of the following situation, I still think it should go down as
one of the better gags of the quarter.
With an eye towards turning an honest buck, two of the local boys
last summer sent letters to all the incoming freshman girls instructing
;he femmes to send in complete information about themselves, including
.several pictures (preferably in bathing suits).
The idea was to compile the information in a booklet to be sold to
all eager men on the campus. But the school officials intercepted the
oall at midfield, and handed our two heroes a one-quarter suspension
from school.
I assume the penalty was for unnecessary roughness.

Ever since the Straw-Hatters, a summer playhouse group in Lafayette,
California, two years satirized the soap opera, "John's Other Wife," that
program has been the butt of jokes by innumerable local quipsters.
The Straw-Hatters' original take-off was the story of an outhouse and
was called "John's Other Wife's Other John."
Not to be outdone by any of the other punsters, I feel compelled to
add a contribution to this campaign. In my program, we will case John
i.s a cow and call the show "John's Udder!"
