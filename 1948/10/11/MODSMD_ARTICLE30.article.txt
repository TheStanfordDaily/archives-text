## U.S. Promoting World Recovery 
### 
To the Editor:
It is, and indeed always has been for some time, a puzzle to me why
persons such as Miss Hyman, who are undoubtedly earnest, thoughtful,
and sincere in their convictions on world affairs, could remain so per
sistently unmoved and unconvinced by the lessons learned from the great
and significant events which have taken place in the world in the last
three years.
Of those persons, and there were many, who were in doubt a year,
or even six months ago, as to the course of action which our country should
pursue in its search for world peace, only a few (mostly communsist)
remain who still support the impractical and illogical policies of Mr.
Wallace, and other quixotic preachers of peace by appeasement.
Today most Americans overwhelmingly agree in the soundness and
validity of our present national foreign policy, which embraces a program
designed to promote world-wide recovery and stability, and establish
peace and prosperity in a devastated and chaotic world. America is most
emphatically not attempting to "force undemocratic governments on
foreign peoples" as Miss Hyman would have us believe.
One of these days Miss Hyman will realize that Mr. Wallace's principles
and policies are nothing but empty promises based on false beliefs and
improper reasoning, which, if adopted, would only serve the interests
of those men who fully intend to destroy all the freedoms and privileges
which we so highly cherish, and any hope of peace which mankind
now has.
