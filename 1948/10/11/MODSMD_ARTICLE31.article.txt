# Another Ticket Plan for Traffic

To the Editor:
Friday's editorial and "Letter to the Editor" from R. E. Beekman
•dealt with the problem of married students and football games where
one of the spouses is not a student.
May I suggest another idea than that offered in the editorial?
Let the student get a complimentary ticket for his wife (her husband).
Or, let the student get two complimentary tickets; then they can sit in
the rooting section or elsewhere, as they please (Rally Com permitting).
The tax on complimentary tickets, being less than 20 per cent, shouldn't
hurt any budgets (33 cents for the past games is less than the price of
a show in town).
And while I'm in a "Letter to the Editor" mood, I'd like to suggest
fmother device for making money, for the school, that is.
Install parking meters in selected areas of the campus and earmark
the proceeds for road improvements. The present two-dollar fine could
then be reduced to a more cosmopolitan dollar.
