# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Which Way Peace 
### 
Several days ago a Daily reporter found a
year-old editorial cartoon in our art files. As
far as the newspaper business is concerned,
most cartoons die when the reader's eye
passes over them.
But this dusty engraving has even more sig
nificance today than it had a year ago; perhaps
it is wishful thinking for us to hope that a year
from now the cartoon on this page will have
a new interpretation—a meaning that would
imply that all nations turned left on the con
structive road to peace.
Winston Churchill declared last week that
"at the present time our only foundation of
peace and the prevention of actual war rests
upon strength."
Rule by strength, however, follows the paral
lel of the children's game, King of the Moun
tain. To be king, the strongest boy must push
all his playmates from the top of a commanding
height. Soon his task becomes too difficult for

him, and the king falls before the onslaught c
the attackers. If the king could arrange fc
joint rule of the territory by all his playmates
there would be no point to playing the game
War, in this sense, would not occur.
How true that game is in real life! Playmate;
on the Western side of the street hold the edgt
because the Eastern group does not know th<
secret of the atom. Westerners may be willinc
to share joint rule of the mountain, but wil
such a step end all desire for war by a fev
malcontents? Yet, a rule of strength polio
cannot be considered for the long run perioc
of time.
The question is before us again—will th<
world have to travel the road to war once mor<
before journeying on the road to a true peace
Take another look at today's cartoon, and thei
compare day-to-day diplomatic developments i:
the light of "which road to peace" will thi;
eventuallv lead us.—L. L.
