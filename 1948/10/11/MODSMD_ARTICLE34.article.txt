# Notes From a Padded Cell

### BOB SEDERHOLM 
Of the varied lower division
courses, no doubt History of West
ern Civilization and General Biol
ogy I, 11, and 111 trap the most stu
dents. I took both of these courses
and had a lively time of it in both
cases.
One of the instructors handsome
ly summed up the Western Civ
course by saying that it covers ev
erything from Adam and Eve to
Adolph and Eva. I studied enthu
siastically, if unsuccessfully. All I
can seem to recall today, however,
is the lone fact that there were
50,000 prostitutes in Rome at the
time of Augustus.
For certain students, there is a
special deal called the Independent
Study Plan which is supposed to
give bright students a chance to
spread their historical wings. Mr.
B. asked me to join his independent
group, and I acceded to his wishes.
It wasn' tthat I was one of his bet
ter students; he just couldn't stand
me in his class three times a week.
The independent group met once
a week and each time Mr. B.
changed the meeting place without
notifying me, in the hope I would
get discouraged and drop the whole
thing. A good share of the time he
was successful, but I ferreted out
the meeting place enough times to
give scholarly reports on "Collar
Buttons of the 19th Century," "The
Personal History of Louis XlV's
Gardener's Idiot Son," and "Evolu
tion of the Game of Craps."
Biology is a fascinating little
course although I got oft to rather
a poor start. The day I reported for
the first lab. my instructor glanced
at me casually and suddenly leaped

to his feet and ran down the hall
crying, "Specimen 231 got out of
the bottle!"
There isn't much I can tell you
about biology except that 8 a.m. is
a ghastly hour. You learn all about
plants, insects, trees, and finally
mammals. There's even a little about
sex in the coursc; but personally
I'd rather my kids learn it in the
gutter.
