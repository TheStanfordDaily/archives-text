# TWO YEARS OF SERVICE
## IIR Looks at its Record 
### JIM THURBER 
A foreign student is met at the
boat by two college men represent
ing Stanford; a bombed-out family
in Germany receives food and
clothing from the students of Stan
ford; a lecture 011 international af
fairs is scheduled by Stanford; the
University of Naples receives a
mimeograph machine from the stu
dents of Stanford.
Working in close connection with
the United Nations, a small group
of Stanford students have been ac
tive during the past two years in
spreading the name of Stanford
over the globe.
The Institute of International Re
lations was created by the ASSU in
1946 to co-ordinate the several in
ternational groups that already ex
isted on campus. Its founders be
lieved that one group could con
tribute much more to the peace and
security of the world than several
unorganized groups.
Today the Institute is one of the
largest student organizations in the
world with a program fc the fu
ture which will involve almost ev
ery student at Stanford.
But before examining the future
program of the lIR. let vis take a

look at its past history and the i
of achievements it has performed 1
the past two years.
Once under way, the Inst it ut
met rough going on campus. Mai-,
students, afraid that the efforts i
the organization would go unno
ticed in the hustle of modern lift
deserted the organization for ae
tivitics with more immediate re
sults.
In the international field, the In
stitute started by sending clothe:
food, books, and other material
overseas. In the spring of 1947, th
ASSU, acting on the advice of th
lIR, adopted the University
Naples and greatly aided in its re
construction.
During the fall of 1947, the for
eign relief branch of the Institut
sponsored a relief drive and co:
lected over $12,000. of which 40 ]
cent went to the University
Naples.
Working with the idea of p<
sonal aid, the students collected '
names of needy families in Euro}
and sent them clothes and food o
a regular basis. Books and techni
cal journals were sent to collect
all over the world.
For the students who planned t
go to Europe during the summci
the Institute obtained boat and air
plane tickets, hotel reservation
and interpreters.
Thus, two years after its creatioi
the Institute of International Rela
tions has finally established a fin
foothold on the campus.
(In a subsequent issue of Tin'
Daily the plans of the lIR fin
the coming year will be dis
cussed.)

security of the world than several
unorganized groups.
Today the Institute is one of the
largest student organizations in the
world with a program fc the fu
ture which will involve almost ev
ery student at Stanford.
But before examining the future
program of the lIR. let vis take a

look at its past history and the i
of achievements it has performed 1
the past two years.
Once under way, the Inst it ut
met rough going on campus. Mai-,
students, afraid that the efforts i
the organization would go unno
ticed in the hustle of modern lift
deserted the organization for ae
tivitics with more immediate re
sults.
In the international field, the In
stitute started by sending clothe:
food, books, and other material
overseas. In the spring of 1947, th
ASSU, acting on the advice of th
lIR, adopted the University
Naples and greatly aided in its re
construction.
During the fall of 1947, the for
eign relief branch of the Institut
sponsored a relief drive and co:
lected over $12,000. of which 40 ]
cent went to the University
Naples.
Working with the idea of p<
sonal aid, the students collected '
names of needy families in Euro}
and sent them clothes and food o
a regular basis. Books and techni
cal journals were sent to collect
all over the world.
For the students who planned t
go to Europe during the summci
the Institute obtained boat and air
plane tickets, hotel reservation
and interpreters.
Thus, two years after its creatioi
the Institute of International Rela
tions has finally established a fin
foothold on the campus.
(In a subsequent issue of Tin'
Daily the plans of the lIR fin
the coming year will be dis
cussed.)
A foreign student is met at the
boat by two college men represent
ing Stanford; a bombed-out family
in Germany receives food and
clothing from the students of Stan
ford; a lecture 011 international af
fairs is scheduled by Stanford; the
University of Naples receives a
mimeograph machine from the stu
dents of Stanford.
Working in close connection with
the United Nations, a small group
of Stanford students have been ac
tive during the past two years in
spreading the name of Stanford
over the globe.
The Institute of International Re
lations was created by the ASSU in
1946 to co-ordinate the several in
ternational groups that already ex
isted on campus. Its founders be
lieved that one group could con
tribute much more to the peace and
security of the world than several
unorganized groups.
