# Root of Evil...
## But What an Amazing Number of Uses! 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
Money is the root of all evil ....
ii says here. Well, money may not
buy happiness, but with it you can
be unhappy in comfort!
And sometimes it doesn't take
much to make some people happy.
An American aviator named Thomas
Graves was made happy with a
one-cent piece. It was in his wal
let and deflected the bullet that
would have pierced his heart ....
back in France in 1918.
A Portuguese girl named Manuela
Paredcs thinks money is the root
of all evil, though. The young miss
is allergic to gold. The sight or
touch of the metal shocks her se
verely, causing fever and asthma.
What Is Money?
But, after all, what is money, any
how? Monetarians and numisma
tists have spent years trying to tell
us that. Then along comes a small
boy in London with the answer.
"Money is an article which may be
used as a universal passport every
where but Heaven, and as a uni
versal provider of everything except
happiness."
Actually money is just a form
of imagination dreamed up as a
polite way to promote an inferiority
complex. Money is anything a peo
ple may want it to represent. Why
on the island of Hao in the Pacific
rats are used for money, and the
fTicial money used by the French
government in Canada between
1685 and 1749 was playing cards,
and even living money — slaves—
was used in the British Isles dur
ing the Middle Ages. Imagine a
slave - owner coming in with a
couple of his charges to a grocery
and saying, "I'll have him worth of
ham hocks and him worth of jelly
beans."
Assumes Different Forms
But that should be no worse than
being a debtor in Ethiopia. There
the creditors can lead their debtors
about on chains until the debt is
somehow paid. What a spot for a
_ood pickpocket . . . and with an
airtight alibi, too!
Even in Western America money
used to be circulated in the form
if .45-. 40 Winchester cartridges
. . . very practical indeed. Looks
like there might be some difficulty
in payments, however, with an irate
mortgagee coming to p<ly off the
villain and pumping a half-dozen
slugs into him and labeling the
corpse "Paid in full."
The ancient Aztecs, who were
possessors of huge quantities of
cold, used as money cocoa beans.
What a spot for a far - minded
ereat-great twenty times removed
grandson of the present day. But
with my luck he'd leave a store of
cocoa beans instead . . . and I hear
the market isn't too stable on that
commodity these days. Gold and
silver were even forbidden in early
Greece. They used iron currcncy
instead.
Chinese Used Razors
Speaking of iron, razors were
once common coin of the realm in
China. It seems the prehistoric ra
zors made by Chinese smiths were
so good they were circulated as a
medium of exchange. Later some
wisey cut the blades off and palmed
off the perforated disc handles alone
killing two debts with one razor.
Thus we have holes in the Chinese
. oins. That facilitates the carrying
i! large numbers of them on
strings.
Yes, money is the root of all evil
. but still I would give a thou
i d dollars cash to be one of those
millionaires!
