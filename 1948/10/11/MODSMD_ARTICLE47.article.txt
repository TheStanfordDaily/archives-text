# IN LOCKER ROOM
## Sad Cards Moan Over Loose Play 
### 
As was (o be expected, the Stan-
I lord dressing room was a very
gloomy place Saturday after the 27
: to 14 defeat handed the Indians by
I Santa Clara.
The big question was, "Why, why
did we fumble like that?" As one
; lad pointed out, the Cards went
; through the Oregon game with
nary a miscue. But today the law
of averages had more than caught
up with them, resulting in eight
fumbles, two of them leading di
rectly to Bronco touchdowns.
Sterling Caused Fumbles
The "you tell us" attitude was re
: fleeted by quarterbacks i'om Shaw
and Don Campbell, each of whom
fumbled several tmes at the pass
I back from center. Some visitors
: asked if Vein Sterling, Bronc
guard, might not have been the
j cause of some of the fumbles by
J his jamming the center tactics.
Coach Marehie Schwartz agreed
i that this had a lot to do with the
: fumbles but noted that the Santa
i Claran was called offside but once.
Said Schwartz, "That boy Sterling
has never looked bad against us.
For my money he is the best guard
i on the Coast. He must have been
I starting right on the snap of the
! ball."
But this Stanford team is not
I downhearted by any means. More
| than one player expressed the sen
; timent, "I wish we would not have
to give excuses every week. One
of these days we will run some
I team out of the park. We can do
I it."
Blocking and Tackling Improved
In general the team members felt
: that their blocking and tackling had
improved. But what can you do
when you lose the ball on the first
play after getting it?
Schwartz was pleased with the
efforts of the backfield that ended
' the game. He hinted that this com
bination might be the starting
i group when the Cards meet UCLA
in Los Angeles on Saturday.
The Indian coach singled out
Emery Mitchell as the best Stan
ford performer and added the
I names of tackles A 1 F!au and Gor
don White and end Gene Martin
for special mention.

when you lose the ball on the first
play after getting it?
Schwartz was pleased with the
efforts of the backfield that ended
' the game. He hinted that this com
bination might be the starting
i group when the Cards meet UCLA
in Los Angeles on Saturday.
The Indian coach singled out
Emery Mitchell as the best Stan
ford performer and added the
I names of tackles A 1 F!au and Gor
don White and end Gene Martin
for special mention.
As was (o be expected, the Stan-
I lord dressing room was a very
gloomy place Saturday after the 27
: to 14 defeat handed the Indians by
I Santa Clara.
The big question was, "Why, why
did we fumble like that?" As one
; lad pointed out, the Cards went
; through the Oregon game with
nary a miscue. But today the law
of averages had more than caught
up with them, resulting in eight
fumbles, two of them leading di
rectly to Bronco touchdowns.
Sterling Caused Fumbles
The "you tell us" attitude was re
: fleeted by quarterbacks i'om Shaw
and Don Campbell, each of whom
fumbled several tmes at the pass
I back from center. Some visitors
: asked if Vein Sterling, Bronc
guard, might not have been the
j cause of some of the fumbles by
J his jamming the center tactics.
Coach Marehie Schwartz agreed
i that this had a lot to do with the
: fumbles but noted that the Santa
i Claran was called offside but once.
Said Schwartz, "That boy Sterling
has never looked bad against us.
For my money he is the best guard
i on the Coast. He must have been
I starting right on the snap of the
! ball."
But this Stanford team is not
I downhearted by any means. More
| than one player expressed the sen
; timent, "I wish we would not have
to give excuses every week. One
of these days we will run some
I team out of the park. We can do
I it."
Blocking and Tackling Improved
In general the team members felt
: that their blocking and tackling had
improved. But what can you do
when you lose the ball on the first
play after getting it?
