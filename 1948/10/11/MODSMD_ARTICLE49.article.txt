CLEVELAND. Oct. 10
ing sudden death if they lost, the
Boston Braves exploded with a 12-
hit assault on five Cleveland throw
ers today to win the fifth game of
the World Series, 11 to 5, and carry
the golden play-off back to their
own windswept park for a decision.
The greatest crowd ever to at
tend a major league baseball game,
8(j,2K8 stunned individuals, saw the
finally aroused National Leaguers
land on Rapid Bob Feller and three
other Indian (lingers for six runs in
a wild seventh inning to settle the

Braves Rally for Six
Going into the big frame, in
which the Braves batter around, it
had been a close battle of home
runs. The Indians were,ahead, 5-4,
and it looked as though Feller
might close out the visitors without
more ado. Then Cleveland's hurl
ers dished up five hits and two
walks and the Tribe's center fielder,
Larry Doby, made a grievous error.
That sent the series into i\ sixtli
game tomorrow.
Lefty Warren Spahn, slim left
hander whom the Indians knocked
from the box in the second tussle
at Boston, came back to pitch bril
liant relief ball today. He stopped
the Cleveland batting order cold as
a mackerel after Nelson Potter had
been shelled from the hill in the
fourth.
Spahn Blanks Indians
Taking over after a three - run
homer into thd left field stands had
put the Indians in front 5-4, Spahn
pitched to 10 batters the rest of the
way and allowed one hit, a lead-off
double by Manager Lou Boudreau
in the eighth.
Needing a victory tomorrow to
tie it up at three games apiece.
Manager Bill South worth of the
Braves nominated Bill Voiselle to
face the chastened Indian clubbers
in Braves Field, which a prevailing
east wind off the Charles River
converts into a pitchers' paradise.
Boudreau named righthander Bob
Lemon, who beat the Braves 4-1 in
the second game of the series. The
run off Lemon was unearned.

CLEVELAND. Oct. 10
ing sudden death if they lost, the
Boston Braves exploded with a 12-
hit assault on five Cleveland throw
ers today to win the fifth game of
the World Series, 11 to 5, and carry
the golden play-off back to their
own windswept park for a decision.
The greatest crowd ever to at
tend a major league baseball game,
8(j,2K8 stunned individuals, saw the
finally aroused National Leaguers
land on Rapid Bob Feller and three
other Indian (lingers for six runs in
a wild seventh inning to settle the
issue.
Braves Rally for Six
Going into the big frame, in
which the Braves batter around, it
had been a close battle of home
runs. The Indians were,ahead, 5-4,
and it looked as though Feller
might close out the visitors without
more ado. Then Cleveland's hurl
ers dished up five hits and two
walks and the Tribe's center fielder,
Larry Doby, made a grievous error.
That sent the series into i\ sixtli
game tomorrow.
Lefty Warren Spahn, slim left
hander whom the Indians knocked
from the box in the second tussle
at Boston, came back to pitch bril
liant relief ball today. He stopped
the Cleveland batting order cold as
a mackerel after Nelson Potter had
been shelled from the hill in the
fourth.
Spahn Blanks Indians
Taking over after a three - run
homer into thd left field stands had
put the Indians in front 5-4, Spahn
pitched to 10 batters the rest of the
way and allowed one hit, a lead-off
double by Manager Lou Boudreau
in the eighth.
Needing a victory tomorrow to
tie it up at three games apiece.
