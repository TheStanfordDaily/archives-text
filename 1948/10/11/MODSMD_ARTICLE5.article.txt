# Talk About Rushing Planned for Frosh
## 
### 
Legal and illegal rushing prac
tices will be discussed tonight at
7 in the Encina lounge, Ted
LeVino, Interfratemity Council
president, announced. Rushing
rules will be read by Dean
Kimpton and LeVino, and copies
of the rules will be distributed.
The meeting will then be thrown
open to questions.
"It is highly important that all
freshmen interested in joining a
fraternity attend this meeting,"
LeVino warned, "since they may
be suspended from fraternity
pledging for six quarters if they
violate any of the rules."
