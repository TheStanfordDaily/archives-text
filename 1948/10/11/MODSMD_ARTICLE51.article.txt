# Pappy Happy; Bears Snappy
## 
### LORRY LOKEY JACK BLOOD 
The Cal locker room was unusu
ally quiet after the Bears' convinc
ing 40 to 14 trouncing of Wisconsin.
Jackie Jensen, Paul Keckley, Rod
Franz, and other stars of the game
undressed and showered without
much horseplay. They had expect
ed to win and they did so that was
that.
Pappy Waldorf was probably the
happiest man in the room and
beamed continually. He praised tin
entire Cal line and said Â«hat the
baekfield performed better than
expected.
Pappy Pleased
Then Pappy broke away from the
reporters to make his weekly ad
dress to the student body from the
balcony of the dressing room. To
the assembled mob below he said, )
"I'm very pleased and happy about I
the team's showing. The line was |
particularly good, with Cunningham
(end) and Captain Turner (tackle)
outstanding. . . . I'm really proud
of the boys and the way you backed
them."
Pappy walked off the balcony as
the mob below roared. Captain Jim
Turner then walked out to praise
the team play and the crowd roared
again.
Finally cornering Pappy in the
"press room," the reporters began
bombarding him with questions
which Pappy dodged like Jensen
avoids tackles on end runs. When
asked if he thought the California
team was at its best he hopped on
the fence:
Bears Have Spirit
"We enter conference play next j
week with Oregon Stale." he said, I
"and all that I can say is that this
is the best ball the team has played I
this year. A fine team spiriti has '
crytallized now that we stand as
I he only Coast team to beat a Bitr
Nine squad."
In regard to the Stanford-Santa 1
Clara game, Waldorf said he wasn't j
too surprised since he rated the j
Broncos a better team than Navy.
(Cal beat Navy 21 to 7 while the ,
same Golden Bears humbled Santa I
Clara 41 to 19.) He wouldn't com- j
ment on the Big Game next month
as he dodged the question by say- 1

ing, "Our hardest game is always
the one next week."
Waldorf said he was happy to see
that no one was seriously hurt,
even Billy Montague who crashed
headlong into the goal posts to snag
Celeri's touchdown pass in the last
quarter. He pointed out that he
used 40 players in the game and
was not trying to keep Wisconsin
scoreless.
Reserves Good
However, even the third- and
fourth-stringers played the Badg
ers even by solving the Midwest
erners' trick offensive set-ups from
the "T" and Notre Dame box. Cal's
depth in all positions makes the
Bears as tough as they are.


CALIFORNIA COACH Lynn
"Pappy" Waldorf was a happy
man Saturday as his Bears clawed
the Big Nine Badgers 40-14.
