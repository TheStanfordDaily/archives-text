# Stanford Soccermen Edged Out By Heavier San Francisco Squad, 2 to 0
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team tasted
its first defeat of the season Satur
day morning when the Indians
bowed to a sharp-passing, straight
shooting University of San Fran
cisco squad 2-0 on the local field.
The Indians fought the physically
bigger Dons to a standstill in the
first half, which wound up score
less. Most of the half was played in
the Stanford defensive zone, but
the Dons could not break through
goalie Walt Dunbar for a score.
Stanford had several chances, but
their kicks went astray.
The Dons finally broke the scor
ing ice near the end of the third
quarter, when center forward Steve
Nogoescue kicked a grass - burner
into the Stanford net. Nogoescue
also scored the other goal late in
the fourth quarter, when Stanford
played ten men in their offensive
territory in a dire attempt to score.
Coach John Segal said it was one
of the most well p'ayed collegiate
games he had ever seen. The "Skip
per" thought his boys played an ex
cellent game, but had special praise
lor Larry Peterson, freshman full
back, who was the defensive stand
out of the game.
USF Coach Gus Donoghue was
well Satisfied with his club's show
ing, and thought Stanford's passing
was very good. He singled out Ara

Galstaun as the Indians' outstand
ing offensive player, rnd also spoke
highly of Jarvis Slade, John Ah
rens, and, of course, Peterson.
Homi Irani became the second
casualty of the season when he was
hit in the temp'e witli the ball. The
Stanford halfback is in the hospital
now, but should be ready for the
game with California a week lrom
Saturday.
Next Saturday the Indians travel
to Davis, they will meet the
California Aggies in the first of two
games.
