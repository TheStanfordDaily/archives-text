# Antigone, French Underground Play, to Run October 20 to 23
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
"Antigone," written so cleverly as
to pass German censors, was de
signed to be an inspiration for
French undergi-ound activities at
the time it was staged in Paris in
1943.
The play, which will be presented
by the Stanford Players in the Lit
tle Theater Oct. 20 through 23, had
a two-year run in Paris.
While entertaining United States
troops overseas, Katherine Cornell
saw the French production and ar
ranged for the play's opening in
America. In March, 1946, "Antig
one" played in New York with Miss
Cornell and Sir Cedric Hardwicke
in the lead parts.
"Antigone" is based upon Sopho
cles' classic by the same name, but
has been modernized for contempo
rary audiences by Jean Anouilh.
Modern dress and staging employ
Grecian overtones to create unu
sual effectiveness.
It is the story of the young, emo
tional daughter of the Thebes who
rebels against her cold, logical
uncle, who has usurped the throne
after her two brothers died fighting
each other. When he decrees that
one of the brothers was a traitor
and shall remain unburied, she
makes this petty matter a symbol
of her rebellion.
The uncle orders her killed, but
before he can act she kills herself.
Later her lover, the uncle's son,
tries unsuccessfully to kill his fa
ther and then takes his own life.
