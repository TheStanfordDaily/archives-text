Do you know about
nylon's other lives?

Here's a surprise for those who think
of nylon mainly in terms of stockings
and lingerie.
Nowadays, nylon fibers — twice as
strong and half as heavy as the same
size aluminum wire—are doing a vari
ety of jobs, better than any previously
known fiber. Off Labrador, men are
harpooning whales with nylon lines.
In a New England textile mill, abra
sion-resistant nylon ropes now drive
big "mule spinners" for periods ten
times as long as other commercial
materials, without a breakdown. Ny
lon fabrics are being used in every
thing from rugged automobile seat
covers to delicately woven filter
cloths.
In its plastic form, nylon is used to
make everything from unbreakable
dishes to hypodermic needles. As a
monofilament, it goes into a variety

of products from brush bristles to
surgical sutures.
Nylon owes its origin to a Du Pont
fundamental research project begun
in 1928. A group of scientists set out
to find out how and why the mole
cules of certain substances polymer
ized to form giant chainlike mole
cules. Hope of obtaining a new com
mercial fiber was first aroused when,
two years later, a pclymer was de
veloped which could be drawn out
into a thin strand, like taffy candy.
The complex problems which fol
lowed called for the services of over
200 Du Font men and women, among
whom were some of America's most
competent scientists and engineers.
Research—a Major Du Pont Activity
Nylon is an excellent example of
modern research at work at Du Pont.
Young scientists joining the organi
zation now may share in other dis
coveries of outstanding importance.
They may find opportunities in such
challenging fields as finishes, coated
fabrics and various fibers; synthetic
organic chemicals, including fine
chemicals; synthetic rubber; electro
and agricultural chemicals; plastics;
pigments and photograpliic film; and
high pressure synthesis.
Each of ten manufacturing depart
ments of Du Pont has its own staff
and is operated much like a separate
company. Within each, research
men work in groups small enough
to bring quick recognition of indi
vidual talent and capabilities.
Year after year, young, inquiring
minds come from leading U.S. schools
of science and engineering to Du Pont
— where individual ambition is
matched with opportunity, coopera
tion and the type of friendly support
that brings out the best in each
person.
