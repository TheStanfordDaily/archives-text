THE SPACE
High in the Tower of our school
A sage observed the mortal fool.
He watched for hours, his main
intent
To prove that students have no
sense.
Students are born to read and learn.
With pad and pen through life
they churn.
Professors insult their hard done
themes,
And late rules thwart their social
schemes.
They do their work and pay their
dough.
And out into the cruel world go
To work and slave for wages sour.
While plumbers make five bucks
an hour!
High in that Tower of War and
Strife
Our sage deplored his fruitless life.
College work he did renounce.
He jumped, he lit.and he didn't
bounce.
