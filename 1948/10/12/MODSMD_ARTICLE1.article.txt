# Secretary Marshall Returns To General Assembly Meeting

### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 11 (AP)
—Secretary of State Marshall
was flying back to the United
Nations meeting in Paris tonight,
after saying the world now has
evidence that United States for
eign policy is ''completely united."
Those were the words he used
upon his departure from Washing
ton National Airport to describe the
end result of a round of statements
issued by both Democratic and Re
publican leadei's on President Tru
man's now discarded proposal to
send Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson
on a plane mission to Moscow.
But as he went aboard the Presi
dent's own plane, The Independence,
to begin his trip, he was by no
means certain whether the "harmful
influences which he said disclosure of
the Vinson affair had on the meeting
at Paris had been eliminated.
He told newsmen that there was
no doubt that "confusion" had arisen
in Paris over the fact that the news
of the incident broke on Friday
night whereas, Marshall said, Mr.
Truman had abandoned the project
on last Tuesday afternoon. This con
fusion, he said, had exercised "harm
ful influence" on the Paris meeting.
Diplomatic officials had expressed
the view that, if the United States
had single-handedly taken such a
step as sending Vinson to Moscow,
it would have injured American rela
tions with the countries with which
the United States is cooperating in
presenting the Berlin problem to
the United Nations.
