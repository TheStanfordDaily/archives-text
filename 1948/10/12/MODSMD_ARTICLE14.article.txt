SEVILLA, Spain, Oct. 11 (/P). â€” j
Generalissimo Francisco Franco
said tonight Spain will fight against 1
an enemy that would attack neigh
boring countries in spite of "ideo- !
logical differences" between those ;
countries and Spain.
The Spanish leader, addressing
high military officers of the Sevilla
garrison, obviously was referring to J
Russia as the attacker.
He repealed a statement he made j
during the war that "if the advance 1
of the Communist hordes should 1

pass through Berlin, 1,000,000 Span
iards must fight." He added that
on that occasion, the Allies had not
heard his words of advice but that
now they recognize the danger.
