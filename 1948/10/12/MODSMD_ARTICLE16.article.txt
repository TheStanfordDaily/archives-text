### 
Work on two buildings of the
School of Mineral Sciences is 98
per cent completed, and the final
touches will be added to the
57 - year - old buildings within two
weeks.
Eldridge T. Spencer, director of
planning, said yesterday that the
delivery ol some plumbing parts
and other small items were all that
;ire holding up the completion of
the renovation on the west end of
ihe Inner Quad.
Space in the Mineralogy and Pe
trography buildings has been
doubled by the reconstruction of
the interior. A second floor has
been added to both buildings, af
tording more classrooms, labs, and
office space for the departments.
Modern lighting fixtures have
been installed, and the rooms have
been painted a blend of white and
hght green, a color claimed pleas
ing to the eyes.
Cost of the rebuilding, which
started in June, is in the neighbor
hood ol $103,000. The work is the
beginning of reconstruction which
will eventually take place all over
the Inner Quad. Later, all one
story buildings will be changed to
two stories, increasing the working
space by 100 per cent.
Spenser said that no immediate
plans for the rest of the buildings
have been made yet. He added that
when the law school moves into its
new building, the buildings it va
cates will be worked on immedi
ately.
