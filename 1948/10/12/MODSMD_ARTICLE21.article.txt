NANKING, Oct. 11 (/P). â€” The
Chinese government announced to
day recapture of the important
Manchurian seaport of Yingkow, its
greatest victory in many weeks, but
the Communists pressed fierce new
offensives on two other fronts.
A government military spokesman
said Yingkow had been taken by a
combined land and sea operation.
The 115-mile route northward to
Mukden now is open, he declared.
