# Poll Shows Stanford Women Are 'Slow'; 'Smooching' Has Declined Since 1937
## 
### PATRISH VAN RONKEL 
One of the interesting side
lights of life on the Farm is the
supplementary education fur
nished at night long after class
rooms are emptied and library
lights extinguished.
What goes on in parked automo
biles on and about the campus will
forever be the favorite topic of dis
cussion of college men and women
everywhere. Daily staff members in
1937 were interested enough in the
subject to find out and a poll was
taken forthwith on the smooching
habits of Stanford undergrads.
This year another poll was taken
among the same comparative group
in order to determine what changes
have taken place in the past 11 years.
Some of them are significant and
reveal a marked change in the
morals of the "average" Stanford
student.
Indians arc "Slow''
Stanford men still think that Stan
ford women are "slow," and vice
versa. In an almost unanimous
pr»rremcnt, students in both polls
said that members of the opposite
sex are not as fast as students on
other campuses.
One dissatisfied woman answered,
"No, damn it!" Another added, "not
faster, only rougher." "Generaliza
tions are dangerous, but then—so
are men!"
An eager rough replied, "How can
1 find out?"
But when queried with the ques
tion, "Do you neck?" the 1948 woman
became more demure and only 66
per cent admitted "yes." Back in
1937 results showed that 90 per cent
indulged. Most answers were modi

fied with the reservation, "IT ALL
DEPENDS ON THE MAN."
The most significant difference of
opinion in the 11 years came with
the question, "Do you think less of
a woman who permits first-date
kissing?"
The more conservative 1937
roughs' answers were divided fairly
even; but this year only 30 per
cent replied in the affirmative.
Men Differ in Opinion
Men of 1948 agreed more with the
women of both polls when 50 per
cent said that women kissed on the
first date. In 1937 only 37 per cent
of the men said the women sub
mitted.
In answer to "do you pet?" the
modern trend of the women seemed
to be more affirmative. Yet the men
said the ratio was still about the
same.
One shy rough replied, "How
should I know?" A subtle girl
answered, "I'm engaged!"; and
another candidly admitted, "only on
Sundays."
On the whole Encinamen and Ro
ble women seemed the most eon

servative in their answers. This
fact might be indicative of proper
living conditions.

lies in the fact that several per
