### 
Brenda Helser, former Stanford
student and Olympic swimming
star, returned from Europe last
week faced with the difficulty of
making a choice between marriage
and a film contract.
Miss Helser received a Hollywood
film offer the same day she ac
cepted a Frenchman's marriage
proposal.
A decision to snap up the movie
contract will result in a forced
postponement of the marriage, said
Miss Helser.
