First of all, let's correct an unfortunate error by our Bull Ses
sioner. He indicated in his Monday column that the adminis-
Iration was responsible for the suspension of two students over
Ihe unauthorized solicitation of photographs from freshman girls,
5n the guise of "official" ASSU publicity directors. Actually,
Men's Council made the suspension. The council acts indepen
dently and wears no man's collar. That is true of most Stanford
activities. The winds of freedom truly blow in the conduct of
student affairs.

Overheard after the Sunday Movie: "I'm not only in favor of
the draft, I'm in favor of making it 36 months instead of 21.
These freshmen are too juvenile for college work."
He was referring to the disgraceful conduct during the showing
of "Wuthering Heights."
And before you frosh get hot under the collar about the crack,
consider this: In past years it has been the custom to raise hell
during the serial. (They are shown for that purpose—so every
one can blow his top once a week.) But conduct was fairly well
behaved during the main feature. This was especially true during
a superior film, such as "Wuthering Heights." •
How about a little more discretion in the future? And if it's
Paly High making the disturbance during the main bill, throw
em out.

Man dropped into the office today with this suggestion: Why
not oil the parking lot in back of the Education Libe and adja
cent areas?
He said the oiled lot by Encina is much better. He's got some
thing there. After the rain last night, a heavy load of adobe was
tracked into the administration offices in the temporary buildings.

No one can blame the rooting section for being disappointed
iin the Santa Clara game, especially when the score was doubled
in the first three minutes of the second half. But the conduct
of some rooters in regards to Emery Mitchell was disgraceful.
After the hard-running back (best on the field) fumbled, the
rooters cried "bum" and "take him out." There is no excuse
for such manners.
The situation should have been obvious to everyone who has
watched more than one game of football. After a long run,
Mitchell was hit once, kept running and was hit again—by three
Santa Clara players. It was the old set-up. One hit him high,
one hit him low, and the third elbowed the ball. The play was
obvious in the press box—and should have been even clearer
1o those close to the turf. Repeating, there is no excuse for
such conduct—unless of course we want to take on the unsavory
reputation once appended to the University of California rooting
section.
