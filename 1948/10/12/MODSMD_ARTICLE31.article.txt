To the Editor:
Congratulations to AWS for the devilish ingenuity of their latest witch
hunt, as announced in Friday's Daily. However, if Stanford women are
to be tyrannized, let s not be half-hearted about it. May we suggest
the following scale of punishments:
1 demerit—Student to be imprisoned in the belfry of the Hoover Library
for three weeks. 2 demerits—Accused to be forced to go barefoot for
two winters. 3 demerits—Offender to have her head shaven. 4 demerits—
Culprit to have her eyes gouged out with a rusty stylus. 5 demerits—
Victim to be publicly flogged in front of the Cellar, stoned, and her body
thrown to the wolves.
To save unpleasantnes, why not limit admission to graduate women?
They're much cuter.
