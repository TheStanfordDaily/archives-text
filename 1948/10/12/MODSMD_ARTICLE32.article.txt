# Rally Com Thanks Tryoutees

### 
To All Students Who Tried Out for Rally Committee:
One of the most invigorating experiences we have had has been inter
viewing around 150 students, primarily freshmen, for Rally Com, every
one of whom showed us ability, eagerness, and a willingness to work.
Our one great regret is that we had to make a choice.
All these students wanted to do something for Stanford, and to them
the Rally Com may have offered the most obvious place to do so. We
would like to urge all these people to look around campus at the many
other interesting and varied activities and find one in which to give
their time, ability, and interest.
Such enthusiasm should not be wasted!
