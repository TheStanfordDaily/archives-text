# Barclay Says Conventions Will Continue
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
The spectacle of the American
political convention is to political
science enthusiasts what the Bis
Game is to Stanford's rooting sec
tions. Someone might add, "on a
higher plane," but that is open to
contention.
On the Stanford faculty is a man
who attended both the Republican
national convention and the Demo
cratic national convention. He is
Thomas S. Barclay of the political
science department. Professor Bar
clay was alternate from the Eighth
District in California to the Demo
cratic conclave this year. The Stan
ford professor was assistant to the
chairman of the Democratic nation
al convention in 1940. He has been
an alternate delegate to Democratic
national conventions of 1930, 1944,
and 1948, and a member of the
county and state democratic com
mittees since 1932. Professor Bar
clay is a present elector for Cali
fornia.
We asked whether the present
system of conventions is outmoded.
"That depends on what you think
the convention ought to be," Pro
fessor Barclay answered.
"Is it the quickest and most effi
cient way?" we asked.
"There are possible reforms," was
the answer. "The conventions could
be made more representative of
the opinions and ideas of voters
who are enrolled in that particular
party. The principle of the Presi
dential preference primary could be
extended and made of much wider
application than now. Also, im
provement should be made in the
deliberative procedure, in the
mechanisms of operating it.
"At present I don't see any ade
quate substitute for the national
convention. The convention as a
spectacle is a traditional American
political institution."
Remembering that at the time of
the Democratic train's departure
for Philadelphia there was a con
troversy among the California del
egates, we asked Professor Barclay
about it.
"In the California delegation
there was a great deal of resent
ment at Mr. James Roosevelt's ac
tivities and attitudes in regard to
opposition to President Truman's
rcnomination.
"Under the California Presiden
tial primary, the delegates were
pledged to support the rcnomina
tion of President Truman.
"The total collapse of any move
ment looking toward the nomina
tion of either General Eisenhower
or Justice Douglas made ridiculous
the position of those who opposed
the nomination of President Tru
man on the eve of the convention.
"Any President seeking rcnomi
nation is in an unassailable posi
tion because of his place of politi
cal leadership and a'so because of
his control of the party machinery.
The Democratic convention of 1948
was no exception to the rule."
When queried as to what he
thinks of the Dixiecrat plan of sop
ping up enough electoral college
votes to throw the election decision
into the House of Representatives,
Barclay dismissed the idea. "I
should be very greatly surprised if
the election is thrown into the
House. If it were, of course it
would be very important.
"The Dixiecrat is apparently a
movement of too limited a scope to
result in throwing the election into
the House of Representatives. If it
were to happen, the new House
would vote for the President in
January. At that time there would
be a probable Republican majority
in the House, with a small outside
chance of a Democratic majority."
Interviewing this professor of po
litical science was an easy task rel
ative to his helpfulness. However,
Professor Barclay could have ex
pressed for publication more views
with heavier tones of human inter
est and more greatly personalized.
He did not for certain reasons that
will appear in The Daily in the fu
ture.
As a parting shot we asked Pro
fessor Barclay. "Who will win?"
He answered, "The Wall Street
betting odds have seldom been
wrong."

"At present I don't see any ade

convention. The convention as a
spectacle is a traditional American
political institution."
Remembering that at the time of
the Democratic train's departure
for Philadelphia there was a con
troversy among the California del
egates, we asked Professor Barclay
about it.
"In the California delegation
there was a great deal of resent
ment at Mr. James Roosevelt's ac
tivities and attitudes in regard to
opposition to President Truman's
rcnomination.
"Under the California Presiden
tial primary, the delegates were
pledged to support the rcnomina
tion of President Truman.
"The total collapse of any move
ment looking toward the nomina
tion of either General Eisenhower
or Justice Douglas made ridiculous
the position of those who opposed
the nomination of President Tru
man on the eve of the convention.
"Any President seeking rcnomi
nation is in an unassailable posi
tion because of his place of politi
cal leadership and a'so because of
his control of the party machinery.
The Democratic convention of 1948
was no exception to the rule."
When queried as to what he
thinks of the Dixiecrat plan of sop
ping up enough electoral college
votes to throw the election decision
into the House of Representatives,
Barclay dismissed the idea. "I
should be very greatly surprised if
the election is thrown into the
House. If it were, of course it
would be very important.
"The Dixiecrat is apparently a
movement of too limited a scope to
result in throwing the election into
the House of Representatives. If it
were to happen, the new House
would vote for the President in
January. At that time there would
be a probable Republican majority
in the House, with a small outside
chance of a Democratic majority."
Interviewing this professor of po
litical science was an easy task rel
ative to his helpfulness. However,
Professor Barclay could have ex
pressed for publication more views
with heavier tones of human inter
est and more greatly personalized.
He did not for certain reasons that
will appear in The Daily in the fu
ture.
As a parting shot we asked Pro
fessor Barclay. "Who will win?"
He answered, "The Wall Street
betting odds have seldom been
wrong."
The spectacle of the American
political convention is to political
science enthusiasts what the Bis
Game is to Stanford's rooting sec
tions. Someone might add, "on a
higher plane," but that is open to
contention.
On the Stanford faculty is a man
who attended both the Republican
national convention and the Demo
cratic national convention. He is
Thomas S. Barclay of the political
science department. Professor Bar
clay was alternate from the Eighth
District in California to the Demo
cratic conclave this year. The Stan
ford professor was assistant to the
chairman of the Democratic nation
al convention in 1940. He has been
an alternate delegate to Democratic
national conventions of 1930, 1944,
and 1948, and a member of the
county and state democratic com
mittees since 1932. Professor Bar
clay is a present elector for Cali
fornia.
We asked whether the present
system of conventions is outmoded.
"That depends on what you think
the convention ought to be," Pro
fessor Barclay answered.
"Is it the quickest and most effi
cient way?" we asked.
"There are possible reforms," was
the answer. "The conventions could
be made more representative of
the opinions and ideas of voters
