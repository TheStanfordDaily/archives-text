The boys who throw together "moon" and "June" and make it pay off
in the world of popular music have a new system now. The latest idea
is to write a song about yourself. Eden Ahkez did it and called it "Nature
Boy, and now the other puppets are following suit. I'm waiting for
the day when a well-known cowboy singer writes a number called "The

Sterile Chinaman." The author? .... Spade Cooley!

Gordon McCrae, the new crooner who is making
nothing but money these days with his Capitol rec
ords, has been a favorite of mine for nearly two years.
The reason for my liking McCrae is not because
he is an exceptionally talented singer, because he is
not. My admiration stems from the fact that I like
a guy who can kid himself about a mistake with
a radio audience of several million people listening.
In 1940 McCrae was doing a Saturday morning show
over the ABC network for a manufacturer of'girls'

school clothes. On this particular morning, he was finishing the show
by singing the ballad "Mamselle.' (Remember "Mamselle"?) He had
about four bars left to sing when he forgot the words. But instead of
blanking out completely, he faked in some other words and staggered
through to the end of the song.
The studio audience apparently thought the different words were part
ol a special arrangement because they applauded the number vigorously
But McCrae was more than a little disgusted with himself. As the audi
ence noise died down, he muttered to himself: "This program would
be a heck of a lot better if I'd learn the words to these songs!"

Just to prove that I have more than a passing interest in the field of
popular music, I've whipped up a few numbers that the publishers will
undoubtedly be clamoring for the minute they read this.

Frank WolfT, the poor man's Burl Ives, was asked the other day if
he could play in the key of A-flat. Sez Frank: "I can play in any flat
if I ve got the right key!"
