# Another Oct. 12 Recalls Columbus Controversies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (/P).â€”
Probably nobody will argue with
you if you say, "Today is Columbus
Day, the anniversary of Columbus'
first landing in the Western Hemi
sphere."
Without fear of contradiction,
you probably can even go so far
as to repeat the old rhyme:
"In fourteen hundred ninety-two
Columbus sailed the ocean blue."
But if you say another word
about Columbus somebody might
pick a fight. Hardly an item in the
Columbus story has not aroused
controversy among scholars.
According to most well-informed
college professors, Christopher Co
lumbus was born in Genoa, Italy,
in 1451.
Other scholars used to argue
about it, placing the date anywhere
from 1430 to 1450 and the place,
Pontevedra, in the province of Ga
licia, Spain.
Another big argument is over
Columbus' purpose in starting his
great voyage: to find a western
route to the Indies, according to
many high academic sources.
The record shows, however, said
Henry Vignaud. a French scholar,
that his proposal was merely to
search for undiscovered islands.
How about the money for the
voyage? Many textbooks gay the

king and queen of Spain provided
the money.
But Prof. Charles H. v McCarthy
of Catholic University here says (he
truth is that much of the money
was put up by the Santa Herman
dad (Holy Brotherhood), a Spanish
society formed to suppress brigan
dage.
As for Queen Isabella's pawning
her jewels, she actually did offer to
do so, but it was never necessary.
Many a scholar has wondered
whether perhaps most of the credit
for the expedition ought not to
have gone to Martin Alonzo Pin
zon, commander of the Pinta, one
of Columbus' three vessels.
Pinzon was a member of "a rich
and prominent family of mariners.
When Columbus was having diffi
culty in recruiting a crew, Pinzon
influenced sailors to sign up.
He helped to suppress mutiny and
gave ColumbUi advice on naviga
tion. Some say Columbus himself
was ready to turn back until Pin
zon persuaded him to sail on.
Pinzon died almost immediately
after his return to Spain, so lit'
never had a chance to argue his
case. The scholars only speculate
as to whether he was the real hero.
None seems to be dogmatic about it.
So you're pretty safe if you say,
"Columbus discovered America."
