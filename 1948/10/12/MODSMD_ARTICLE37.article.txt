# Notes From a Padded Cell
## 
### BOB SEDERHOLM 
The other day I was approached
by an adolescent-looking freshman
whose IQ is the same number as
my weight (I am a 165-lb. weak
ling).
"How about a column on Stan
ford women, stupid?" he asked rev
erently.
"OK," was my glib comeback.
Later, as I stuck my quill into
a vein (always write my stuff in
blood), I realized that 1 knew noth
ing of women. I had lived such a
sheltered life.
My friend, B , knows all about
women; he has a date EVERY
night. So I went to him to find out
about Stanford women. He was
dressing, and from the talcum
under his armpits, I could tell he
planned an evening with the oppo
site sex.
"Tell me about women," I said
with a faint blush.
"Great Scott! Don't you know?"
he cried.
"I mean STANFORD women."
"Oh! Yes. Well, generally speak
ing they are divided into three
classes: pigs, beasts, and nice per

sonnlities. The difficulty in dealing
with them, however, is their tend
ency to take this family thing too
seriously. After two years here, 1
now find that I have 19G sisters.
"That makes it difficult," I said
thoughtfully.
"Indeed it does," he replied with
a fraternal shudder.
"But I must have something foi
the incoming freshmen. You arc
one of the most popular young men
I know. Come, how do you do it?
"Basically, it is an individual
problem and must be solved to the
needs of the individual. Also, well
you know, some of us have it and
some . . ."
"That's true, of course," I said as
I classified myself sadly, "hut there
must be a solution. Where arc you
going tonight?"
"To a dance, my boy, and I might
add with a very number (he
used a French word and I take
Latin. The implication, however,
was obvious.)
"Really?"
"Really, and if any calls come for
me, Mac, just tell 'em I can be
reached at Paly High."
