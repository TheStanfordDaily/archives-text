# Homecoming Prizes to Go To Best House Decorations
## 
### 
Take-offs on the Greek myths,
destruction of Troy by the In
dians, and other ideas pertain
ing to the overall Homecoming
theme "Indians Destroy Troy"
are suggested as possibilities for
house decorations for the USC
Homecoming festivities next week,
said Jean Burnett, co-chairman of
the house decoration committee.
Living groups should sign up their
decoration ideas in the ASSU office
from 1 to 5 p.m. this week. All liv
ing groups are urged to participate,
but since festivities are to be cen
tered on the Row, off-the-Row
houses are encouraged to combine
with Row houses in decorations.
"We want every living unit to par
ticipate," Miss Burnett said. "Dorms
may decorate where they are or
combine with Row houses."
Judging will take place the night
of Oct. 22 after the Rally. A large
trophy will be presented to the win
ner in both the men's and the wom
en's divisions. Runners-up in each
division will be awarded cups.
Animation, lighting effect, use of
yards, balconies, and other physical
aspects of the houses, skits, and
tableaux were suggested by the
chairman for use in house decora
tions.
'"We hope that Stanford will

graduate to the big time this year, ;
with extravagant decorations, and '
that everyone will enter into the i
celebration with spirit and enthusi
asm. It's a big weekend and we
want to get it of! to a bang-up
start with these house decorations,"
she said.
Dick Reinhart, the other co-chair
man of the decoration committee,
said that the tremendous trophies i
and prizes make it worth the extra ;
effort and display of originality.
After the Rally on Oct. 22, the
Row will be turned into a midway,
Reinhardt said. Students are to go
directly to the Row. The women's
houses will hold open house.
