## VARSITY GRID Cards Return To the Grind 
### 
Monday was not a day of rest for
i the Stanford football team as Coach
Marchie Schwartz put his gridders

through an hour - long scrimmage
against the junior varsity.

Except for the first-stringers and
I injured varsity members, every
man aw action in the rugged
scrimmage. Quarterbacks Tom Shaw
and Don Campbell threw the book
at the j; yvees and broke runners
away "for several touchdowns.
Over on the fenced field, quarter
back Aubrey Devine ran the first
string men through signal practice.
Tackle Gordon White was nursing
j an injured ankle and did not see
j action on either field.
Schwartz commented on the
practice by saying that be thought
his players were in a good frame of
mind for Saturday's game with UC
LA at Los Angeles. He was im
pressed by the showing of some of
the men who have not seen much
j action as yet this year.
