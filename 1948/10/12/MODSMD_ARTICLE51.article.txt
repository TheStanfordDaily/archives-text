BOSTON, Oct. 11 (AP)—Thanks to stout-hearted relief b}
pitching by Gene Bearden in the tense closing minutes of play
the Cleveland Indians staggered through to a 4-3 victory ove
the Boston Braves in the sixth and deciding game of the Work
Series today.
In winning its first championship in 28 years, the tribe als(

►was the beneficiary of a lucky clou
j ble play in the ninth inning wind
probably saved Bearden from serious
|ious trouble.
One moment the crowd of 40.10
: was sitting on the edge of the seat:
| expectant of a rally that woul
square the series at three game
apiece, and carry the play-ofl' 1 it>!
down to a seventh contest tomor
row.
Stanky Draws Walk
The next moment it was all ovc
I for the Boston fans but for the sa
: filing through the exits, and the In
| dians were boisterously poundin
Bearden across the back and hall
carrying him in triumph off the fiel<
Eddie Stanky, a steady little chai
: acter right through the serie
opened the ninth by drawing a wal
|as the crowd raved. Connie Rya
ran for him. Then came the heart
] breaker. Sibby Sisti went in t
I pinch-hit for Warren Spahn, wh
! had done a brilliant piece of relit
! chucking for two innings, and al
| tempted to safrifice Ryan to secon
j with the tying run.
Instead, he bunted under Beai
den's pitch and lofted the ba
straight up, directly in front of th
plate. Catcher Jim Hegan snare
the ball for the final out to end tl
contest and make all Clevelar
happy.
Lemon Gets Shelled
Only the previous inning, tl
; eighth, the Braves brought the cu:
i tomers to their feet by slugging Be
Lemon, Cleveland's starting chunke
from the hill and scored twice
drawn within a run of the Indian
i who apparently had been coastii
ito an easy win behind the b
righthander.
When Bearden inherited the ug
situation, the bases were loadc
I with Braves and only one was 01
| Two Bostons scored on a long 112
to center by Clint Conaster ar
Phil Masi's ringing double off tl
left field wall. Both Conaster ai
J Masi were pinehhitters. But that w
all as the great southpaw bore dow
I to get Mike McCormick on an ii
field roller.
Boudreau, modest as ever abo
his own accomplishments at bat ai
: afield, gave all the credit for tl
victory to Bearden. If the Brav
had won today's game, he declare

paw right back at them tomorrow.

BOSTON, Oct. 11 (AP)—Thanks to stout-hearted relief b}
pitching by Gene Bearden in the tense closing minutes of play
the Cleveland Indians staggered through to a 4-3 victory ove
the Boston Braves in the sixth and deciding game of the Work
Series today.

contest and make all Clevelar
happy.
