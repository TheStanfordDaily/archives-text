## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
"Like a child in wild anticipa
te. the frosh grid squad tore into
ie soggy sod yesterday in ihe first
1 their four drills prior to their
reeting with UCLA's Brubabes
aturday in the Los Angeles Coli
3um. At this point the wee bears
>om as the major obstacle to
'huck Taylor's yearlings in their
uest of a second consecutive con
;rence victory.
Friday saw the fighting frosh fiz
e as a surprisingly rugged jayvee
leven had its own way through
le first frosh-JV game scrimmage,
/ith a line that consistently out
larged the vaunted frosh for
ards, the JV's went for scores the
tst two times they had their hands
i the ball. Halfback Ken LaCrosse
-oked like a sophomore Pete
metovic as he took a lateral from
ill Elb Puckett on the opening
ckoff and went 50 yards to pay
rt, then as an encore some min
es later sped 45 after taking a
-'antiful throw from quarterback
ayne Buck.
Frosh Score on Pass
Actually the frosh, playing only
even men while the JV's substi
ted freely, were at a disadvantage
roughout the game that had much
do with the outcome. Their only
ore came on a pass from quarter -
•ck Harry Hugasian to end Bill
cColl in the end zone, with Mc
jll making the kick good.
The fracas did give indications
two things, however. First, that
iul Ganatal's JV's are in no way
meat squad—they played better
otball Friday than Card specta
rs have witnessed from local tal
t in some time. Second, that the
>ht side of the frosh line, includ
g the defensive backs, is vulner
>le to the kind of straight-on hard
nning attack that they had
rown at them Friday.
Frosh Ran Wild
In their initial ball game the
>sh ran wild and looked great
ainst a group of boys in football
iforms from Mt. San Antonio JC.
TLA's frosh could field a team
mposed of managers and water
ys that could wipe up the field
th the Mountaineers. Whether or
t the Cardbabes realize that fact
\v will mean a lot at kickoff time
the Coliseum.
