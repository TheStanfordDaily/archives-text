# JOHN HALL
## The 						Front Row 
### 
Men, it's time to talk about next basketball season. Or water polo,
or soccer, or even the cheer-leader. But not football. Eight fumbles,
three intercepted passes, and 27 points convinced me of that.
Of course, you could say that a fighting Stanford team went down to
defeat, and that the Cards outgained and outfirst-downed their enemy,
and if only this had happened, and maybe if this had happened, Stan
ford COULD have won. But it all adds up to the same answer. Stanford
didn't win, it hasn't won, and it probably won't win.
Heap Bi«> Elke
Torn Elke is heap big cheer-leader. He gotta lotta hustle. He gotta
white finger-tip sweater. And a microphone. And a voice.
He knows all the yells, and can sing the Alma Mater word-for-word.
Heap Big puts much ugh into his work. He kicks oft his shoes, rips out
his shirt, and generally goes completely wild in his efforts to lead his
beloved rooting section. (Okay, gang, let's hit it! Boola-boola!)
Elke is what you would call a Stanford version of Orson Welles. He
is a self-styled genius in his field. He spares nothing in putting over
a stunt.
An' ye gotta give Old Shoeless credit where credit is due. His first
great success as a builder of enthusiasm occurred during last football
season when he led an all-campus rally for the bridge team which was
to meet California the next afternoon. His "re-double the Bears," and
"Give 'em the Ace" will never be forgotten.
So now Heap Big is the main cog in making Stanford's white-shirts the
spirited section that they are. If anyone can handle the job. Tom Elke
can do it just that much better.
He is the first fearless cheer-leader to take over the Stanford rooting
section since the war. Ask anybody. *
Let's Talk Basketball
With everybody down in the athletic dumps these days, basketball
coaches Everett Dean and Bobby Burnett are having a difficult time
keeping back pie-season smiles. What would you do if you had five
two-year lettermen, three one-year lettermen, and a bunch of high
spirited sophomores fighting to grab off the five regular jobs? Sure,
you'd smile.
This year's captain, Bill Stephenson, will lead the team from the cen
ter spot. He has been Stanford's' high-point man and top threat for the
past two years, and he should compile even greater feats for this season.
The forwards, George Yardley, Bill Rose, Milt Iverson, and possibly
Paul Watson, will be as tough as any in the league. The tall, blond
Yardley could develop into the hottest thing to hit the Southern Division
since Jim Pollard.
Dave Davidson, a rough and tumble bruiser from way back, will be
around for his third year at guard. Dave will be backed up by whip
like Bob Lewis, Gus Chavalas, and the aging sophomore. Marv Gelber.
Ralph Carver, Jack Scharfen. Dick Shutte, Bill Lewis, and Bob
Swingley, all better-than-average performers, will also be on hand to
make mentor Dean's dreams easier.
First basketball game comes up on Nov. 23, when the varsity tangles
with Stanford Alumni. From that night on. the season rolls into high
gear with 29 contests slated for the Stanford schedule. Out of that list,
Yale, New York City College. Michigan, and Washington will be highly
featured.
DiMaggio Tops "Em All
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, the man who owns a restaurant on Fisherman's
Wharf, is reported to have signed his 1949 Yankee contract for the record
breaking sum of $85,000. If it's true. Joe will become top dog among
the salary kings.
DiMaggio may also wind up as the next Yankee manager. Either
way, he'll be earning his money. It's a tossup between DiMag and Cleve
land's Lou Boudreau for the American League's Most Valuable Player
Award for 1948.
If you want to take a good shot at guessing whom it will be, try Bou
dreau. Even though the outfielder is better than the infielder in every
department, manager-player Lou will no doubt get the call.
For a couple more flippant guesses, try USC's sluggish Trojans over
Oregon next Saturday in Eugene. Oregon barely got by Idaho last week,
and seems to be slipping lower every Saturday. It's just the right spot
for Cravath's disappointing eleven to come back to life.
Also, watch while Buck Shaw's San Francisco '49ers beat the champ in
his own corner next weekend. Frank Albert and his assistants should
drop the Cleveland Browns just as easily as they have polished ofl every
opponent to date. For Albert, they're all getting easy.

for Cravath's disappointing eleven to come back to life.
Also, watch while Buck Shaw's San Francisco '49ers beat the champ in
his own corner next weekend. Frank Albert and his assistants should
drop the Cleveland Browns just as easily as they have polished ofl every
opponent to date. For Albert, they're all getting easy.
Men, it's time to talk about next basketball season. Or water polo,
or soccer, or even the cheer-leader. But not football. Eight fumbles,
three intercepted passes, and 27 points convinced me of that.
Of course, you could say that a fighting Stanford team went down to
defeat, and that the Cards outgained and outfirst-downed their enemy,
and if only this had happened, and maybe if this had happened, Stan
ford COULD have won. But it all adds up to the same answer. Stanford
didn't win, it hasn't won, and it probably won't win.
Heap Bi«> Elke
Torn Elke is heap big cheer-leader. He gotta lotta hustle. He gotta
white finger-tip sweater. And a microphone. And a voice.
He knows all the yells, and can sing the Alma Mater word-for-word.
Heap Big puts much ugh into his work. He kicks oft his shoes, rips out
his shirt, and generally goes completely wild in his efforts to lead his
beloved rooting section. (Okay, gang, let's hit it! Boola-boola!)
Elke is what you would call a Stanford version of Orson Welles. He
is a self-styled genius in his field. He spares nothing in putting over
a stunt.
An' ye gotta give Old Shoeless credit where credit is due. His first
great success as a builder of enthusiasm occurred during last football
season when he led an all-campus rally for the bridge team which was
to meet California the next afternoon. His "re-double the Bears," and
"Give 'em the Ace" will never be forgotten.
So now Heap Big is the main cog in making Stanford's white-shirts the
spirited section that they are. If anyone can handle the job. Tom Elke
can do it just that much better.
He is the first fearless cheer-leader to take over the Stanford rooting
section since the war. Ask anybody. *
Let's Talk Basketball
With everybody down in the athletic dumps these days, basketball
coaches Everett Dean and Bobby Burnett are having a difficult time
keeping back pie-season smiles. What would you do if you had five
two-year lettermen, three one-year lettermen, and a bunch of high
spirited sophomores fighting to grab off the five regular jobs? Sure,
you'd smile.
This year's captain, Bill Stephenson, will lead the team from the cen
ter spot. He has been Stanford's' high-point man and top threat for the
past two years, and he should compile even greater feats for this season.
The forwards, George Yardley, Bill Rose, Milt Iverson, and possibly
Paul Watson, will be as tough as any in the league. The tall, blond
Yardley could develop into the hottest thing to hit the Southern Division
since Jim Pollard.
Dave Davidson, a rough and tumble bruiser from way back, will be
around for his third year at guard. Dave will be backed up by whip
like Bob Lewis, Gus Chavalas, and the aging sophomore. Marv Gelber.
Ralph Carver, Jack Scharfen. Dick Shutte, Bill Lewis, and Bob
Swingley, all better-than-average performers, will also be on hand to
make mentor Dean's dreams easier.
First basketball game comes up on Nov. 23, when the varsity tangles
with Stanford Alumni. From that night on. the season rolls into high
gear with 29 contests slated for the Stanford schedule. Out of that list,
Yale, New York City College. Michigan, and Washington will be highly
featured.
DiMaggio Tops "Em All
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, the man who owns a restaurant on Fisherman's
Wharf, is reported to have signed his 1949 Yankee contract for the record
breaking sum of $85,000. If it's true. Joe will become top dog among
the salary kings.
DiMaggio may also wind up as the next Yankee manager. Either
way, he'll be earning his money. It's a tossup between DiMag and Cleve
land's Lou Boudreau for the American League's Most Valuable Player
Award for 1948.
If you want to take a good shot at guessing whom it will be, try Bou
dreau. Even though the outfielder is better than the infielder in every
department, manager-player Lou will no doubt get the call.
For a couple more flippant guesses, try USC's sluggish Trojans over
Oregon next Saturday in Eugene. Oregon barely got by Idaho last week,
and seems to be slipping lower every Saturday. It's just the right spot
for Cravath's disappointing eleven to come back to life.

dreau. Even though the outfielder is better than the infielder in every
department, manager-player Lou will no doubt get the call.
For a couple more flippant guesses, try USC's sluggish Trojans over
Oregon next Saturday in Eugene. Oregon barely got by Idaho last week,
and seems to be slipping lower every Saturday. It's just the right spot
for Cravath's disappointing eleven to come back to life.
Also, watch while Buck Shaw's San Francisco '49ers beat the champ in
his own corner next weekend. Frank Albert and his assistants should
drop the Cleveland Browns just as easily as they have polished ofl every
opponent to date. For Albert, they're all getting easy.
Men, it's time to talk about next basketball season. Or water polo,
or soccer, or even the cheer-leader. But not football. Eight fumbles,
three intercepted passes, and 27 points convinced me of that.
Of course, you could say that a fighting Stanford team went down to
defeat, and that the Cards outgained and outfirst-downed their enemy,
and if only this had happened, and maybe if this had happened, Stan
ford COULD have won. But it all adds up to the same answer. Stanford
didn't win, it hasn't won, and it probably won't win.
Heap Bi«> Elke
Torn Elke is heap big cheer-leader. He gotta lotta hustle. He gotta
white finger-tip sweater. And a microphone. And a voice.
He knows all the yells, and can sing the Alma Mater word-for-word.
Heap Big puts much ugh into his work. He kicks oft his shoes, rips out
his shirt, and generally goes completely wild in his efforts to lead his
beloved rooting section. (Okay, gang, let's hit it! Boola-boola!)
Elke is what you would call a Stanford version of Orson Welles. He
is a self-styled genius in his field. He spares nothing in putting over
a stunt.
An' ye gotta give Old Shoeless credit where credit is due. His first
great success as a builder of enthusiasm occurred during last football
season when he led an all-campus rally for the bridge team which was
to meet California the next afternoon. His "re-double the Bears," and
"Give 'em the Ace" will never be forgotten.
So now Heap Big is the main cog in making Stanford's white-shirts the
spirited section that they are. If anyone can handle the job. Tom Elke
can do it just that much better.
He is the first fearless cheer-leader to take over the Stanford rooting
section since the war. Ask anybody. *
Let's Talk Basketball
With everybody down in the athletic dumps these days, basketball
coaches Everett Dean and Bobby Burnett are having a difficult time
keeping back pie-season smiles. What would you do if you had five
two-year lettermen, three one-year lettermen, and a bunch of high
spirited sophomores fighting to grab off the five regular jobs? Sure,
you'd smile.
This year's captain, Bill Stephenson, will lead the team from the cen
ter spot. He has been Stanford's' high-point man and top threat for the
past two years, and he should compile even greater feats for this season.
The forwards, George Yardley, Bill Rose, Milt Iverson, and possibly
Paul Watson, will be as tough as any in the league. The tall, blond
Yardley could develop into the hottest thing to hit the Southern Division
since Jim Pollard.
Dave Davidson, a rough and tumble bruiser from way back, will be
around for his third year at guard. Dave will be backed up by whip
like Bob Lewis, Gus Chavalas, and the aging sophomore. Marv Gelber.
Ralph Carver, Jack Scharfen. Dick Shutte, Bill Lewis, and Bob
Swingley, all better-than-average performers, will also be on hand to
make mentor Dean's dreams easier.
First basketball game comes up on Nov. 23, when the varsity tangles
with Stanford Alumni. From that night on. the season rolls into high
gear with 29 contests slated for the Stanford schedule. Out of that list,
Yale, New York City College. Michigan, and Washington will be highly
featured.
DiMaggio Tops "Em All
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, the man who owns a restaurant on Fisherman's
Wharf, is reported to have signed his 1949 Yankee contract for the record
breaking sum of $85,000. If it's true. Joe will become top dog among
the salary kings.
DiMaggio may also wind up as the next Yankee manager. Either
way, he'll be earning his money. It's a tossup between DiMag and Cleve
land's Lou Boudreau for the American League's Most Valuable Player
Award for 1948.
