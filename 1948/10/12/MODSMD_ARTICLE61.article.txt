Virginia Moore, Stanford senior
who was an auto injury victim be
fore the beginning of fall quarter,
is reported to be steadily improv
ing at University of California Hos
pital in San Francisco.
Miss Moore has regained slight
motion of her right leg, which was
paralyzed three and a half weeks
ago when a car she was riding in
went off the road near Elko, Nev.,
and overturned. One arm is also
in traction, the result of a broken
collar bone.
Friends said yesterday that she is
able to carry on a good conversa

tors. It is hoped that she will be
released from the hopital within a
month, but it is doubtful whether
she will return to school this year.
