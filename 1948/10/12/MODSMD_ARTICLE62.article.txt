# Health Service Urges Care For Colds; Suggests Rest
## 
### 
Do you have a cold? The Health
Service hasn't discovered any mir
acle cure. It still recommends the
same treatment you have been get-
I ting all your life.
"Get plenty of rest, keep warm,
and avoid chilling," cautioned Dr.
John F. Eckert, assistant director of
the Stanford Health Service. "Drink
at least two to three quarts of
liquid dail>\ and take one or two
tablets of aspirin as often as every
j four hours it needed to relieve the
aching and headache."
"Avoid needless exposure of fel-
I low students," Dr. Eckert said.
"The danger of the common cold
lies in the complicating infections
that may follow," he continued.
! Olten a cold will pave the way
[ tor other respiratory diseases. Ear
infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia

frequently follow. If your cold is
accompanied by high fever, ear
ache, a persitent cough, or pain in
the chest or face, come to the
Health Service. The early institu
tion of treatment almost always
saves time for the student patient."
