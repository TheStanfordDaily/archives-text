# Berlin Crisis Mediations Vainly Attempted by 'Neutral' Nations
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 11 (AP) —Desperate attempts by "neutral" nations in the United Nations Security
Council to mediate the Berlin crisis apparently w ere stalled tonight.
Argentine Foreign Minister Juan A. Bramuglia talked privately again with Russia's Andrei Y.
Vishinsky. Informed sources said the Soviet deputy foreign minister told him that no answer
had been received from the Kremlin on the mediation efforts.
Western Power spokesmen said in the absence of new Soviet proposals they assumed Mos-

cow still insists that the Berlin case
must go to the four-power Council
of Foreign Ministers packaged with
the whole German problem. The
spokesman repeated that "the block
ade must be lifted before we go to
the Council of Foreign Ministers."
Bramuglia has been attempting to
mediate the East-West differences
since last Wednesday as temporary
president of the Security Council
and as spokesman for the "neutrals"
—Argentina, Canada, China, Bel
gium, Colombia, and Syria.
In the face of the apparent dead
lock, the Security Council is ex
pected to meet Wednesday or
Thursday to go over the Berlin
situation and perhaps open full
scale debate. Only the Western
Powers have spoken so far, accusing
the Soviet Union of threatening
world peace. Russia is boycotting
the discussions.
Dr. Philip C. Jessup of the United
States, Sir Alexander Cadogan of
Britain, and Alexandre Parodi of
France conferred privately tonight
in the wake of reports, some of
them from official sources, which in
dicated that the three powers might
be willing to accept a possible
"combination" settlement of the is
sue.
But the Western Power spokesman
reiterated there had been no retreat
and the West would not negotiate
under pressure of the blockade.
Berlin occupied the major share of
attention in UN halls but arms re
duction and Palestine came up.
Britain put a resolution before the
assembly's political committee which
would blame Russia for lack of
agreement on slashing armaments.

Western Powers of blocking dis
