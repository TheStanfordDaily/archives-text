THE SPACE
ODE TO A FUTURE WIFE
In France they eat snails;
The Esquimaux whales;
The English love mutton stew.
But give me a steak
Arid some wine to partake
And I'll not wander far from you.
S. E. CHIAPELLA JR.

See how easy it is to get free
food at Longbarn. All you have to
do is write a poem or a (very)
short essay, or an epigrarnme or a
crytogramme or an epitome or an
enthemime or a crossword puzzle
and if we print it in this, THE
SPACE, you get one meal at Long
barn on Uncle Willie's generosity.

That's where Duncan Hines had
ore of his adventures in good
eating—ho hum.
