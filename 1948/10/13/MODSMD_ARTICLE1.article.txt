# Russia Offers to 'Put Cards On Table' in Arms Dispute
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 12 (AP)â€”Soviet Russia agreed today to "put
our cards on the table in the East-West dispute over arms
reduction proposals.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Y. Vishinsky made the cards-on-the
table offer when the U.S. Delegate Warren R. Austin accused

Russia of balking efforts to solve the
Berlin crisis. He said that the Soviet
battle cry in the world today is
"wreck and destroy."
Vishinsky's reply was largely con
ciliatory in tone. He said Russia
would provide complete information
on her arms and armed forces if the
United Nations would adopt the Sov
iet proposal for an immediate one
third cut in Big Five armaments.
The firmer American position was
concerned mainly with the Berlin
blockade, but it included many other
fundamental differences between
Rusisa and the West. This new posi
tion developed with the return of
Secretary of State Marshall by plane
from Washington, where he had
conferred with President Truman.
Resolution Will Be Drafted
Britain and France joined the
United States in a move to speed
up Security Council action on the
Berlin crisis. The three big Western
Powers, because of the apparent
failure of the mediation efforts of
the "Little Six" on the Security
Council, are drafting a resolution
for firm action to lift the Berlin
blockade, Western sources said.
Vishinsky's conditional offer was
the climax to a speech of more than
two hours in which he complained
that in the eyes of the West, "what
ever we do is wrong."
He said that if the United Nations
adopts the Soviet proposal for a one
third reduction of arms, then the
Soviet Union "simultaneously will
submit information on its arms and
armed forces."
Vishinsky denied the statement

made by Austin that the Soviet
policy was founded on the belief
that war was inevitable between
the Communist and capitalist worlds.
The Russian went on to say that
differing ideologies could exist if
"both sides try to understand the
other side," and added that Russia
wished to cooperate.
Austin's voice shook with anger
at times during his speech. He said
that the Russian delegates had dwelt
continually on the horrors of
atomic warfare. "Is it not strange,"
he asked, "that, except for a word
here and a sentence there, he has
not placed the accent on war, just
plain war?"
Austin Defends UN
"Aggressive warfare, in the Soviet
Socialist officialdom, has not yet fall
en into disrepute. For the time
being, only atomic warfare is to be
dreaded and avoided at all costs. In
deed, war itself is still a recognized
means of achieving a Communist
world society."
Austin defended the work of the
United Nations by asserting that it
is "a misconception to suppose that
differing systems cannot live side by
side in peace under the basic rule
of international conduct prescribed
by the charter of the United Na
tions."


U.S. DELEGATE WARREN R. AUSTIN accused
Russia today in the United Nations Political Com
mittee of balking attempts to reach a solution of the

Berlin crisis and of following a policy in the world
of "wreck and destroy."
