# Indians Doom Trojans: Past Contest Queried
## 
### 
A former University of Southern California faculty member
today made a strong denunciation of reported discoveries con
cerning the fall of Troy. Dr. Jorge Tyre-Byter, USC mentor, said:
"No evidence will ever convince me that American Indians
were remotely connected with the destruction of Troy. In my

opinion, the Trojans were a maraud
ing, migratory band and may have
gathered the newly-discovered relics
in raids upon American Indian
camps. I think there is something
fishy about these discoveries," he
concluded.
While controversy raged over sig
nificance of discoveries by Stanford
explorers, Bob Leefeldt, Homecom
ing chairman, drew a modern paral
lel to the Trojan-Indian situation.
"The Trojans are attacking the
Indians Oct. 23 right here in Palo
Alto, and we're hoping to re-destroy
Troy when they do. A Greek-Indian
theme is going to keynote our dec
orations and activities for Home
coming Week. The Trojans are
hoping to spell our doom, but the
Indians will be aiming at destruc
tion of Troy," he added.

Meanwhile Row houses swung into
action with plans to depict destruc
tion of Troy in terms of the local
Indian tribes. Dick Reinhardt and
Jean Burnet, co-chairmen of house
decorations, declared:
"It's going to be a fight to the
finish for those tremendous tro
phies."
Sign-ups of decoration themes
continue this week at the ASSU
office. Row houses, and off-the-
Row halls and houses are pooling
their ideas and energy, according to
the committee.
