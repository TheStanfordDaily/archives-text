# Phi Delt Crooners Crash Big Time?
## 
### JOAN HARZFELD 
The Phi Delts are "on the road"
this quarter with a rolling piano and
a house full of wandering minstrels.
If you have been wondering how
they can get a good-sized piano
through a door, and down the
street, here's the scoop. When the
singing urge hits the Phi Delts,
they open the French doors leading
to their terrace, and shove the piano
through. From there a few of their
musical muscle-men haul it down
to the sidewalk.
Their entertainment isn't restricted

to mere singing. When the Phi Delta
feel generous, they swipe potted
plants from various roadhouses and
present them ceremoniously to a
girls' house. This ritual is usually
observed when the boys want to
patch up a quarrel. Other attractions
include strip tease specialist Jim
Zwerneman (who also doubles as
an A 1 Jolson imitator) and boogie
woogie man Denny Carlson.
The Phi Delt chorus isn't always
welcomed in the usual quiet man
ner. Sometimes, the singing invaders
find themselves a little the wetter

after a water-bag shower from the
third floor. Storey House (the Phi
Delt neighbor) has worked up a
good routine to answer the midnight
serenade. The gals reply with five
part harmony, complete with ukelele
accompaniment.
Fan Mail Requested
PDT's itinerary this quarter in
cludes most of the women's living
groups on campus. However, they
will welcome special engraved in
vitations from the girls begging them
to serenade. Fan mail is scarce, and
their feelings are hurt.
These fraternity vaude-villains arc
really good (they say). In fact, the
fellows even appeared on KSU last
quarter. Bigger offers are expected
momentarily.
