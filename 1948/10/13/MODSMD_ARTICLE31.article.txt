# Unusual Lighting To Be Featured In Stanford Play
## 
### 
Unusual lighting effects will play
a major part in conveying moods
and settings in "Antigone" and
"Othello," both Stanford Players'
productions.
"Antigone," which will begin a
four-night run a week from today
in the Studio Theater, will depend
entirely upon lighting for the vis
ual illusion oi a change of scene.
Through spotlighting, the perma
nent courtyard set will serve for
several changes of scene.
At the same time the background
footlights will give the effect of the
span of a single day, starting with
the deep blue of night and shading
into dawn, midday, dusk, and night
again.
Color Variations
In "Othello," which will be pre
sented Nov. 4, 5, and (5 in Memo
rial Auditorium, rich color varia
tions will enhance the barbaric
quality of the play.
Creating much the same effect as
in "Richard III" last year, gradual
and imperceptible blending will
highlight the production.
The stage itself, fashioned with
interpresidium and cyclorama, is
designed so as to lend itself read
ily to light casting.
By employing both the Elizabe
than and picture-frame techniques

of stage production, a continuous
flow is achieved in the play.
Platform Stage
A platform stage of Elizabethan
time, which extends into the audi
ence, is being built on either side of :
the center stage. A setting of col
umns, pylons, and levels on the
stage will combine classic sim
plicity with unique lighting oppor
tunity.
Tickets for "Antigone" are now
on sale for 60 cents apiece. "'Othel
lo" is included in the $3 subscrip
tion series tickets, which may be
purchased through Tuesday, when
individual ticket sales for the play
will be made at 90 cents admission.
All tickets are available in room j
202 in the rear of Memorial Audi
torium.
