# Truman Says Republicans Anti-Lincoln
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, HI., Oct. 12 (/F»).
—President Truman said tonight
that the Republican Presidential
nominee has lined up with "some
queer characters" in a party that
has ' departed from the fundamen
tal principles" of Abraham Lincoln.
Here in the city where the Civil
War President, the first Republican
President, lies buried, Mr. Truman
told a political rally:
"The masters of the Republican
party today would have been the
bitter enemies of Lincoln in his
time, just as they are the enemies
of his principles today."
At the end of a day of campaign
ing for support through Indiana
and Illinois, Mr. Truman said Lin
coln came from the plain people
and believed in them. He put labor
ahead of capital, people ahead of
property, and "principle above all
else."
"I wonder," he said, "what Lin
coln would say if he could see how
his party has become the tool of
big business."
Earlier, he had paid a visit to the
Lincoln tomb and placed a wreath
there.
Then, in an address prepared for
delivery in the Armory here, the
Chief Executive talked about Lin
coln, and about farmers and farm
prosperity.
"The Republicans fought these
programs for years but lately they
have come around, saying: "Me,
too, but I can do it better'."
But on the farm program, he said,
the 80th Congress cut soil conser

vation and crippled the program
for grain storage bins.
This latter action, he said, "will
cost both farmers and consumers"
and "will benefit the speculative
grain trade and shipping interests."
