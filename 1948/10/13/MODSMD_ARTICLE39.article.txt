# 'Old Boy' Eyes Initial Chappie
## 
### BY CARYL HARMS 
It was the strings of paper dolls
wasted on the windows that gave
t away.
I had been walking around the
'uilding looking for the right en
rance, and when 1 saw the cut-out
Iceorations I went inside and there
yas the sign—"Office of the Stan
ord Chaparral."
When you see the office, you know
v'hy Chappie sounds the way it
ocs. When you sec the walls, you
now where the Chappie gets ils
okes.
I shuffled through the ankle-deep
craps of paper on the floor and
xplained I was from The Daily and
hat we'd like to know when the
rst issue would be out.
Editor Gil Wheat and Managing
iditor John Motheral were willing
o help, but explained that the
happie wouldn't be on sale for
bout three weeks.
Never let it be said that the Old
oy passed up a chance for some
üblicity, however.
"Would you like to do a feature
n the Chappie?" the editors asked
olitely. Orders from our publica
on are never to overlook any possi
ilities for a story, so I sat down
nd listened to a suspiciously fluent
ream of historical data from
lotheral.
"The Chaparral," he began, "first
ppeared in 1899, with Bristow
dams as chairman. Hammer and
offin was founded in 1906, at which
me the Old Boy was also created.
"That was in April, and he pro
dded to destroy the campus with
is silver hammer that very month,
112 course, there are some people
•osaic enough to claim that an
utliquake was responsible for the
image, but we know better than
lat.
"The silver hammer has another
;e. too. The Old Boy employs it
knock the stuffing out of the
uifed shirts on campus and puts
ie remains in the coffin over there."
e indicated an unmistakably fu

nereal box protruding from the
corner.
The Chappie has been coming out
ever since its founding either as a
quarterly or as a monthly. Cur
rently it is on the latter basis and
appears nine times a year. Present
business manager is John Lilienthal.
I asked about the design of the
Old Boy and found out that his ap
pearance changes from year to year.
He was once an extremely plump
gentleman, but the current model
with the long face and glasses is
more generally accepted now. He
has even been interpreted surrealis

tically during his career, but his !
familiar leer has survived any altera
tion.
On such short notice, that was all
the information that the Chaparral
editors had available. But they
eagerly promised more news before
the first issue.
The only advance word on it is i
that the theme is "Back to School," [
and that it will sell for the usual ,
price of 25 cents at the usual promi- j
nent locations around campus on |
Wednesday, Oct. 27.


The Daily is interesting, but I'll be gla<l when Chappie's out.
