## Former IIR President Backs Strength Policy 
### 
To the Editor:
It was very gratifying to come across ex-Marine Edwin Hamilton's let
ter 10 the editor (Oct. 8) expressing his satisfaction over recent Daily
editorials which have supported National Defense. Hamilton's letter is
the most succinct analysis I have yet seen of some of the basic factual
realities which require that the U.S. take a firm stand at this critical
time in the world's history. His statements bear re-reading in light of
much of the murky thinking currently circulating 011 the whys and where
fores of our National Defense policy.
It was all too evident in my own case as a prisoner of the Japanese
for a two-year stretch in the Philippines that a firm stand on the eleventh
hour with out-maneuvered P-40's and green, badly equipped troops
would be no answer to a desperate enemy trained in the art of war and
in the meticulous long-range planning of his time-table. Equally evi
dent was the fact that the inability of the League of Nations to apply
force as a sanction as a result of Japan's occupation of Manchuria in
only succecded in paving the way for what was to follow. All
the howling of the so-called peace organizations, all the fine words and
the recriminations of the pacifists over a resort to force gave a potential
enemy a breathing spell and a chance to pick the time and place to strike:
December 7, Pearl Harbor. Force was the one language which unscru
pulous leaders plotting expansion would understand. Yet, to our well
intentioned pacifist "war" had become a pure abstraction. He failed to
discriminate between "war of aggression" and '"war of self-defense" until
the former hit us with all its force.
Today we face a parallel situation. The United Nations has no effective
police force to back up a decision 011 aggression. Like the League before
it, the UN merely can air the facts constituting aggression. Beyond this
it is powerless to take positive action. Meanwhile, a small core of men
with a different code of values which they believe superior enough to
impose on others, even if it requires the use of force, once again can
choose the time and the place. These are the ugly facts. If we choose
to ignore them, we ignore our obligations to those who gave their lives
to end the last war.
Until the UN has an effective police force to bring an aggressor to heel
we cannot afford to minimize the effect of our own "police arm." Should
we minimize its cffect as we did in the years prior to 1941 we sl\all be
laying down the carpet for another Hitler or another Tojo and our ideals
may go into the junk heap with everything else. We must wake up to
the fact that the millenium is still a long way off and that conditions as
they exist still demand realistic and not wishful thinking. Certainly
Samuel Johnson's admonition to "clear one's mind of chance and look at
these matters un their merits" is more applicable today than ever before.
CLIFF FORSTER
