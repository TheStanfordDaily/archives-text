the activities and plans of the Institute of international Relations.)

"To contribute to the peace and security through those means most
available to university students."
Under this moito, the Institute of International Relations has set to
work planning their program lor the coming year. Not only have they
expanded some ol' their previous projects, but they have also added new
ideas to their schedule.
One of the most interesting items on the agenda for the coming year
is the information service. The United Nations Information Service, seeing
".he good work that the lIR had done in the past, appointed the Institute
information center for this region.
A program of foreign student tours will provide an opportunity for
â– cur visitors to see a broader view of America. Factories, government
ouildings, and other colleges will be visited on various weekends through
out the year.
By a vote of the students, a counselor was appointed to help the foreign
student become orientated on campus. Every Friday afternoon, an open
house will be held at the lIR Shack for the students to get acquainted
with one another and with the student body.
All queries received at the United Nations Headquarters from California
will be sent to the Institute. It will be their job to answer the letters,
supplying information booklets when necessary.
Another "first" for the Institute will be the Northern California High
School Conference on UNESCO in December. Over 300 high school
students will gather at Pacific Grove to discuss and learn about this
international organization. Realizing the importance of the affair, the
State Department and the UN have offered to send speakers to the con
ference.
A survey committee, recently formed by the Institute, will coordinate
the foreign travel of all Stanford students. The students who went abroad
summer submitted reports to this committee which will be printed
and districted to any one interested. This group is also studying the
possibility of a seminar in Europe on American civilization for the
summer of 1949.
But the individual aspects of the program are not so important com
pared to the program as a whole. The lIR is not just another organ
ization on campus; it is a branch of the ASSU and it functions to con
duct the foreign affairs of the students of Stanford.
The Institute has operated to spread the name of Stanford through
.he State Department and the United Nations. lIR representatives to
the UNESCO conference this summer were welcomed when they men
tioned that they were from Stanford. As already mentioned, the UN ap
pointed the lIR as information center for the California district, another
recognition of ability.
Two years ago, the lIR was but a name before Excom; today they
. re a fullfledged organization of Stanford, operating to support the Uni
versity; tomorrow, the opportunities arc unlimited for the lIR to achieve
a real position of prominence among the world international organiza
tion working for peace and security.
