# Protest Vote For Wallace Is Dangerous
## 
### JIM JOSEPH 
November second may mean war
for America.
It may mean war if thousands of
the naive voluntarily place them
selves in the files of the Kremlin
as potential fifth columnists—by a
protest vote for Henry Agard Wal
lace.
To those who believe sincerely in
Mr. Wallace, this piece is not di
rected. They've a right to vote the
way they feel. Right or wrong.
But to thousands who say. "I
don't like Wallace—but I don't like
Dewey or Truman either—so I'm
going to show my protest and vote
Wallace—"
To those, we say "don't."
We say "don't" because the whole
Western Bloc is looking our way,
hoping fiat the American voter
will ref"i:e that this election—our
first posi-war counting of hands—
has international implications.
If the world were not watching—
and only half-understanding why
Americans vote the way they do—
it would not be important whether
Mr. Wallace got 3 per cent or 10
per cent of the votes. He wouldn't
win anyway.
But the election is not as simple
as that.
The world knows that both Re
publicans and Democrats see eye
to-eye on foreign policy: a solid
front against further Russian ag
gression. They know that what
ever the pre - election promises,
both Republicans find Democrats
will toe the same internal policy
line.
Nor can either cut taxes.
So the watching world knows
that there will be few changes—
either internationally or internally
—in American policy with either a
Democratic or Republican victory.
What they are watching is Henry
Agard Wallace.
Foreigners can't believe that
many Americans would vote
against their own feelings—just as
a protest. They cannot believe that
many would vote Wallace and still
oppose almost everything he says,
but vote for him merely to show
protest—their political prerogative.
A vote for Mr. Wallace—if on a
protest basis — will assure Russia
that she has friends in America.
Friends who would split the coun
try in case of a show-down. Friends
who do not approve the U.S.'s Ber
lin stand; or her Marshall Plan; or
her stand in Greece.
The danger of a protest vote is
the danger of misinterpretation.
You may proclaim as loudly as
you wish that you dislike Mr. Wal
lace. That you think him naive.
That he is a mouthpiece of the
stronger, more po'itically astute.
You may even admit that Mr. Wal
lace is in deeper now than he
wishes—anil can't back out until
after election.
But you speak through your vote.
And your vote, tallied in the Krem
lin, counts you as a friend of Rus
sia—as a potential enemy of the
United States.
It does not matter that you de
clare your protest vote is only your
right to declare yourself neutral.
Vote for Wallace and you violate
your own neutrality, and are
counted—in the Kremlin.
A large Wallace vote will give the
Russians all the evidence they need
to stand fast in Berlin; to throw
their weight around; to point out
that American diplomats and mili
tary leaders are not voicing the
opinions of millions of Americans.
But we are committed—both Re
publicans and Democrats—to stop
the Russians. To halt them now or
face a post-war Munich.
If the Wallace vote is high, Rus
sian resistance will stiffen. Since
we have taken our stand opposing
the USSR's world-wide ambitions,
we will not budge either.
And war, the outcome of this in
creased friction, may result. The
outcome of a politically childish
protest vote.

The danger of a protest vote is
the danger of misinterpretation.
You may proclaim as loudly as
you wish that you dislike Mr. Wal
lace. That you think him naive.
That he is a mouthpiece of the
stronger, more po'itically astute.
You may even admit that Mr. Wal
lace is in deeper now than he
wishes—anil can't back out until
after election.
But you speak through your vote.
And your vote, tallied in the Krem
lin, counts you as a friend of Rus
sia—as a potential enemy of the
United States.
It does not matter that you de
clare your protest vote is only your
right to declare yourself neutral.
Vote for Wallace and you violate
your own neutrality, and are
counted—in the Kremlin.
A large Wallace vote will give the
Russians all the evidence they need
to stand fast in Berlin; to throw
their weight around; to point out
that American diplomats and mili
tary leaders are not voicing the
opinions of millions of Americans.
But we are committed—both Re
publicans and Democrats—to stop
the Russians. To halt them now or
face a post-war Munich.
If the Wallace vote is high, Rus
sian resistance will stiffen. Since
we have taken our stand opposing
the USSR's world-wide ambitions,
we will not budge either.
And war, the outcome of this in
creased friction, may result. The
outcome of a politically childish
protest vote.
November second may mean war
for America.
It may mean war if thousands of
the naive voluntarily place them
selves in the files of the Kremlin
as potential fifth columnists—by a
protest vote for Henry Agard Wal
lace.
To those who believe sincerely in
Mr. Wallace, this piece is not di
rected. They've a right to vote the
way they feel. Right or wrong.
But to thousands who say. "I
don't like Wallace—but I don't like
Dewey or Truman either—so I'm
going to show my protest and vote
Wallace—"
To those, we say "don't."
We say "don't" because the whole
Western Bloc is looking our way,
hoping fiat the American voter
will ref"i:e that this election—our
first posi-war counting of hands—
has international implications.
If the world were not watching—
and only half-understanding why
Americans vote the way they do—
it would not be important whether
Mr. Wallace got 3 per cent or 10
per cent of the votes. He wouldn't
win anyway.
But the election is not as simple
as that.
The world knows that both Re
publicans and Democrats see eye
to-eye on foreign policy: a solid
front against further Russian ag
gression. They know that what
ever the pre - election promises,
both Republicans find Democrats
will toe the same internal policy
line.
Nor can either cut taxes.
So the watching world knows
that there will be few changes—
either internationally or internally
—in American policy with either a
Democratic or Republican victory.
What they are watching is Henry
Agard Wallace.
Foreigners can't believe that
many Americans would vote
against their own feelings—just as
a protest. They cannot believe that
many would vote Wallace and still
oppose almost everything he says,
but vote for him merely to show
protest—their political prerogative.
A vote for Mr. Wallace—if on a
protest basis — will assure Russia
that she has friends in America.
Friends who would split the coun
try in case of a show-down. Friends
who do not approve the U.S.'s Ber
lin stand; or her Marshall Plan; or
her stand in Greece.
