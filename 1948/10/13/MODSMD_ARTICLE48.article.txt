# Notes From a Padded Cell

Wclcome to the Stanford Fam
ily, kiddies! We think you'll like
it here, but there are a lew things
you should know.
To begin with, Stanford might be
defined as an institution where
your father pays time-and-a-half
for tuition and you work overtime.
One of the many nice things about
this place is the easy informality;
in what other major university is
formal attire considered to be white
tie and levi's?
As all of us know, Stanford is
definitely not a rich man's school.
Any poor boy or girl with $6,000
can spend four years here if he
works hard in the summer. You
have all no doubt been told that
there is no stigma to working your
way at Stanford. This (with a smug
glance toward the Ad Building) is
not exactly true. One of my very
good friends got in a lot of trouble
over just that. Granted she was
practicing the oldest profession, but
it was what she did best.
There are a number of fine tra
ditions here at Stanford, but of late
there has been some difficulty
keeping them in effect. The future
of our traditions is definitely in the
sweaty little palms of you frosh.
Take what happened last year, for
instance â€” the Mrs. - Stanford - old
tradition of not smoking on the
Quad smoldered out. There were
so many smokers on the Quad that
every Friday the clean -up men
brought in "Speed" Riggs and held
a tobacco auction right on the
Quad.
Although no one said much about
it, this saying "hello" business on
the Quad just about lapsed, too. I
hopefully carried my prayer rug
across the Quad twice daily (at 4
p.m. a group of us suspend our
activities and kneel with heads bent
toward the Hoover tower) all last
year, and the closest thing to a
"heery "hello" I ever received was
the spring day a neurotic-looking
spaniel snapped at one of my trim
ankles. Frankly, I was more than
a little flattered at the attention and
am still carrying a couple of the
little rascal's teeth on my person.
