# Vucinich Sees Communist Break in Tito-Stalin Feud
## 
### 
The breach between Joseph Stalin and Marshall Tito has re
sulted in "a crack in the Iron Curtain which is growing wider
and wider," stated Dr. Wayne S. Vucinich, Stanford associate
professor of history last night at the Tuesday Evening Series.
Pointing out that the activities of the Yugoslav dictator will

gradually "come back to the Com
munist fold," the scholar of Balkan
affairs predicted that the Cominform
attack will not lead to Tito's down
fall in the near future.
The cautious and gradual means
used by the Yugoslav Communists
to achieve Marxian Socialism has
met with disapproval from the Sov
iet capital, who insist that this
method is a sharp deviation from
party tactics.
Because the peasantry is the back
bone of Tito's regime, the dictator
has been slow about pressing col
lectivism. "He does not want to
bite the hands that feeds him," ob
served Vucinich.
Students of recent history were
reminded by Dr. Vucinich of "a
strange parallel between the Tito-
Stalin conflict and the Stalin-Trot
sky feud," with the difference that
Stalin is criticizing Tito for exactly
the same things for which he criti
cized Trotsky.
Hazarding a formula for action by
the United States in this Balkan
split, the speaker suggested "official
and unofficial indifference" in pro
moting further cleavage from the
Soviet satellites.
