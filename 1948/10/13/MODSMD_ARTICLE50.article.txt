# Stanford Gospel Should Be Spread in the East
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Stanford publicity directors have
so far failed to capitalize on what
is undoubtedly the school's strong
est selling point. Last year, accord
ing to the faculty-student directory
(the Bawlout), there were no less
lhan 45 students registered here
from the sovereign state of Massa
chusetts. Only 18 other states have
a bigger representation at Stanford.
Hardly a fact to be passed over
lightly. But instead of spreading
this astounding news throughout
the civilized world as any other
publicity office would have done,
our advertisers preferred to print it
! in modest six-point type on page
| 240 of the Bawlout.
Very interesting, but so what?
Nothing much, except that until
(he moment our eves took in those
figures it had hardly occurred to us
that the Stanford gospel had been
preached that thoroughly on East
ern Seabord frontiers. It was hard
to believe that the late George
Apley and the proper Bostonians
i had permitted their youth to ven
] true beyond the banks of the
Charles to seek an education.
Not only Massachusetts but all of
the East. What is more annoying
than a native New Yorker who
stares at you with a blank ex
oression on his face and says.
"Stanford, where's that?" Incidents
like this occur all too frequently
j to be classified as isolated cases.
Granted that there is a liberal
| sprinkling of first-rate universities
j in the East. But to these educa-
I tional isolationists we are referring
| to the only truly educated men in
' the country attended an Ivy League
school. All the rest arc ignorant
barbarians.
Those who do manage to break
| through the Ivy barrier of the
; Northeastern states usually seem to
' be the offspring of Stanford alumni

who migrated East to make the
fortunes. Others have the miserk
and the climate does them good.
Gross injustice is done to Star
ford and many Western schoo
when Eastern loyalists insist th;
an ac'equate education is not to 1
found west of Chicago. The nun
ber and quality of the successfi
men and women everywhere wl
have been graduated from oi
schools attest to that. The librarit
-it Stanford, our faculty, our facil
ties, our high standards, and oi
honor system all add eloquent tc>
timony.
And how is it that these peop
who have "never heard of Stanforc
have apparently never heard >
men like Herbert Hoover, Presidci
of the United Slates, and Charles
McNary, candidate for the vici
presidency in 1940.
—Never rend the writings of mc
like John Steinbeck, Maxwe'l At
derson, Charles NordofT, Howai
Pease, or Bruce Bliven.
- Never known anything abo
famous educators like Davirl St a
Jordan, Ray Lyman Wilbur, At
thony Suzzallo. Lewis M. Term
or Thomas A. Bailev.
— Never heard of football coach
like Walter Camp, Fop Wartu
Clark Shaughnessy, or Fieldii
Yost.
—Or athletes like Ernie Nevei
1 Ted Schroeder, Lswson Littl
i Clyde Jeffries, Frankie Albert,
i Hank LuLsetti.
—All this from a school only
years old, founded by a railro;
magnate and his wife at a tin
when most big Eastern schools b.
already celebrated their ccntei
nials.
With all these facts and figur
laid out in their impressive cc
umns; with all of Stanford spre.
before us, it us difficult to concei
that this University rates be'nii
! anything the East has to offer.
