A. women's residence where
anish rather than English would

jhly translated, the senoritas all
tk Spanish, sometimes broken
nish, sometimes hesitant Span
and sometimes English with a
nish accent—when they are to

gether, at dinner, meetings, spreads,
and such. Alone in their rooms,
however, the girls often break the
bonds of culture and lapse into the
Anglo-Saxon tongue.
That is to say, in the privacy of
their room, one senorita is likely to
say to her roomie, "Hey, Mabel,
lend me a bobbie-pin," rather than
the more scholarly acceptable "Oye,
Mabel, prestame un gancho de
pelo."
Learn Spanish
But the girls do not feel that this
constitutes a rupture of contract.
As one of them put it, "We are all
here to learn to speak Spanish and
speak it well. It is not just a lower
division requirement to us. With
Senoras Schevill and Seymour liv
ing in the house to help, we«will be
able to conquer the many collo
quialisms of the language. But
many of us, after a few years of
class-room Spanish, are still at the
'My aunt has a red pencil' stage.
That is not terribly useful in a con
vention."
The girls at Casa Espanola are
students, not experts. But they are
sincere students. They like their
house, and are going to make it
successful come "infierno y aguas
altas." This attitude gives weight to
the campus belief that Casa Espa
nola is here to stay.
