# Waterpoloists Open Season in South
## 
### 
In preparation for Stanford's first
conference games of the season this
weekend, Coach Tom Haynie sent
his varsity water poloists through
a rough scrimmage yesterday.
The Indians will travel south this
weekend to tackle both USC and
UCLA to start conference play this
year. The Cards, who are defend
ing champions, will battle the Tro
jans at 3:30 on Friday afternoon
and then challenge the Bruins Sat
urday morning at 10.
Little is known about either
team since it is early in the season,
but USC has sesentially the same

outfit that played last year. Also a
few poloists from Fullerton Junior
College, last year's JC winner, are
reported to be on the Troy team.
Stanford looked sharp in their
first tilt of the season last Thurs
day against the Olympic Club. Cap
tain Harry Borchers, in scoring six
goals, definitely looked like all
conference material. Guard Ralph
Sala, who was all-coast last year,
played his usual consistent defen
sive game. The chief weak spot
seemed to be the goal, as 19 points
poured into the cage.
The probable starters for the

games down south will be: For
wards — Harry Borchers, Fritz
Mauer, and Hub Stokely; guards—
Don Weeden, Ralph Sala, and Ken
Fox; goalie—Kim Fletcher.
Stanford rooters who are going
south for the UCLA football game
are invited to drop in and see the
water polo games.
