# Junior Excom Reorganizes
## 
### 
Junior excom has reorganized its
membership cn a new and some
what complicated basis.
In accordance with this plan each
living group this quarter has ap
pointed one member to act as rep
resentative to the junior class for
that group. If, for example, there
are 1,500 juniors in the University,
and excom wants 15 students as
excom members, the ratio is one
representative for every 100 people.
If there are 100 juniors in seven
Row houses, the representatives
from each of the seven houses will
meet and choose one student to
represent the whole group on ex
com.
First meeting of the permanent
members will be tonight at 7:30 to
discuss plans for two dances. The
first will be an open fireside, and
will probably be held in a couple
of weeks; the second will be an off
campus dance scheduled for Nov. 5
