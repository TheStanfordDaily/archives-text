## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 12 (#). â€” The
California Bears worked on defense
against Oregon State plays today
as they aimed for their first Coast
Conference football game of the
season against the OSC Beavers
Saturday.
Coach Lynn Waldorf said he was
not pleased with his team's defense
against Beaver plays as run ofT by
the third team. "We have lots of
work cut out for us this week as
far as defensive play goes," he said.
He expects his team to be in fair
physical shape for the game. Full
back Jack Jensen, who has been
bothered by a charley horse, was
in uniform today but engaged in
no contact work.
