## Thru Breier's Pipe 
### 
Thank Gawd for the Monday morning quarterbacks! While we're at it,
let's thank someone for those fellows who sit behind you at the football
game and holler to the coach to play so-and-so and to do this or that.
We've a mad on now and this is as good a time as any to unload
something that has been building up for a long time. It took Saturday's
game to bring it out, but here goes.
Some of the actions of the Stanford rooting section at the Santa Clara
game approached the ultimate low for courtesy, common sense, and
plain school spirit.
For instance, a loud-mouthed red-headed guy in the row back of me
started moaning and groaning when Coach Marchie Schwartz withheld
quarterback Tom Shaw from the game for the better part of the first half.
He wasn't the only one, though. Before long a large part of the rooting
section took up the cry, "We want Shaw."
For the most part, those who were doing the chanting learned their
football between 2:30 and about 5 on Saturday afternoons. Sure, they
read the papers during the week. But, that little dabbing football lore
enables them to second guess the coach, a man who has been working
with the players for several years and knows the potentialities of each
and every man on his squad.
Team, Coaches Realize Rooters" Feelings
Take this instance, for example. Shaw, a fine quarterback by the way,
had been in the hospital for two of the five days the team had been prac
ticing for the Santa Clara game. As the season goes on, the coaches install
new plays to make up for the ones that have been scouted by the op
ponents and to give added strength to their offense.
Perhaps our vociferous fan had not attended any of the practices during
the week before the game. It so happened that Schwartz had installed a
new series of plays that involved a direct pass to the fullback. The full
back drops back to his right and throws a pass. For once, the T-formation
quarterback is called upon to drop back with his fullback and block.
Campbell had been practicing the play for a week. Shaw had seen the
play only in practice. Besides, Campbell, with his weight and experience,
is much the better blocker of the two.
Another case in point involves the rooting section and the selection of
the combination of men to be put into the game at one time. Let's take
the Stanford backfield, for an example.
Every back has his specialty. Some run a quick opener better than
others, some shine on the end sweeps, while others excell at pass catching.
But, and this is very important, all too few backs can do the afore
mentioned things and carry out their blocking asignments with equal
facility. Some of our present backs just can not block as well as others.
And some just can't block. It is the coach's business to know which boy
can perform the job the best, and which combination of backs is best for
a given situation.
Must Have lBocking Baeks Too
Two of our better running backs, boys who play a lot of ball each
Saturday, are definitely poor blockers. Marchie can not afford to play
both of them at once.
Enter the rooting section. We in the student body can not know all
these little things that cause the coach to play a certain back at a certain
time. One of the assistant coaches is watching the play from the press
box. He notes the weaknesses of the opponents and phones same to the
players' bench. Marchie, using this information, chooses a player he
knows can perform best in this certain situation. Some guy in the thirty
eighth row starts to holler that all is lost, Joe Smoo has gone into the
game, and Pete Doe (probably a fraternity brother) is still sitting on
the bench.
We always come back to the fact that Stanford has lost three out of
four games this year. But wait now, are things as bad as they seem? Just
about all of us left the Oregon game satisfied with our team's performance.
We met a good team, had two very bad breaks in a flpss interference
ruling and a pass interception by an end, and lost 20 to 12. We did not
hear very much complaining that Saturday.
The next week, the lack of a working passing attack caused the In
dians to go down before a good Washington State team. Saturday we
fumbled eight times, and lost the ball six times, and were behind 27 to 0
at one point. And, remember, two of the Broncos' four touchdowns were
a result of two of those fumbles. Cancel out those instances and the score
might well have been reversed.
Sliaw Had Not Practiced New Plays
The team, the coaches, and this writer can appreciate the feelings of
the student body. Nobody likes a loser, not even when there are extenu
ating circumstances. A loser is a bum, a winner is a hero. That is not
the way it should be, that is not the way that it was last year.
One of the reasons that a lot of us come to Stanford, aside from the
high scholastic rating, is the great family spirit that we have heard about.
This reporter has seldom been as proud as he was the night that the
student body presented a plaque to a team '"nine times defeated, they
never lost their spirit."
That spirit isn't something generated on the football field. It is part and
parcel of that which is Stanford. Remember the Big Game last year.
Think now. How did you feel when we sang the tttymn? We had lost
but could still show the world the Spirit of Stanford.
That is why it hurt to observe the rooting section Saturday. There was
a time we could point to the rowdy, boisterous California rooting section
and cry "Shame, shame." Can we do that .today?
This losing business is bad, but this Stanford team is not going to keep
losing. They have the stuff, the coach, and from you, the student body,
the spirit to win. It is easy to show spirit when you are winning; but
it means a lot more to do so when the breaks go the other way.
Someday we will all be on the outside of the rooting section looking in,
either in the Stadium or over the radio. Will you be proud to hear the
rooting section of your school imitate Cal?
This weekend many of us will travel to the UCI.A game. We will be
outnumbered by the vast UCLA rooting section. But win or lose, let's
show the Stanford Spirit.
Thank Gawd for the Monday morning quarterbacks! While we're at it,
let's thank someone for those fellows who sit behind you at the football

new series of plays that involved a direct pass to the fullback. The full
back drops back to his right and throws a pass. For once, the T-formation
quarterback is called upon to drop back with his fullback and block.
Campbell had been practicing the play for a week. Shaw had seen the
play only in practice. Besides, Campbell, with his weight and experience,
is much the better blocker of the two.
Another case in point involves the rooting section and the selection of
the combination of men to be put into the game at one time. Let's take
the Stanford backfield, for an example.
Every back has his specialty. Some run a quick opener better than
others, some shine on the end sweeps, while others excell at pass catching.
But, and this is very important, all too few backs can do the afore
mentioned things and carry out their blocking asignments with equal
facility. Some of our present backs just can not block as well as others.
And some just can't block. It is the coach's business to know which boy
can perform the job the best, and which combination of backs is best for
a given situation.
Must Have lBocking Baeks Too
Two of our better running backs, boys who play a lot of ball each
Saturday, are definitely poor blockers. Marchie can not afford to play
both of them at once.
Enter the rooting section. We in the student body can not know all
these little things that cause the coach to play a certain back at a certain
time. One of the assistant coaches is watching the play from the press
box. He notes the weaknesses of the opponents and phones same to the
players' bench. Marchie, using this information, chooses a player he
knows can perform best in this certain situation. Some guy in the thirty
eighth row starts to holler that all is lost, Joe Smoo has gone into the
game, and Pete Doe (probably a fraternity brother) is still sitting on
the bench.
We always come back to the fact that Stanford has lost three out of
four games this year. But wait now, are things as bad as they seem? Just
about all of us left the Oregon game satisfied with our team's performance.
We met a good team, had two very bad breaks in a flpss interference
ruling and a pass interception by an end, and lost 20 to 12. We did not
hear very much complaining that Saturday.
The next week, the lack of a working passing attack caused the In
dians to go down before a good Washington State team. Saturday we
fumbled eight times, and lost the ball six times, and were behind 27 to 0
at one point. And, remember, two of the Broncos' four touchdowns were
a result of two of those fumbles. Cancel out those instances and the score
might well have been reversed.
Sliaw Had Not Practiced New Plays
The team, the coaches, and this writer can appreciate the feelings of
the student body. Nobody likes a loser, not even when there are extenu
ating circumstances. A loser is a bum, a winner is a hero. That is not
the way it should be, that is not the way that it was last year.
One of the reasons that a lot of us come to Stanford, aside from the
high scholastic rating, is the great family spirit that we have heard about.
This reporter has seldom been as proud as he was the night that the
student body presented a plaque to a team '"nine times defeated, they
never lost their spirit."
That spirit isn't something generated on the football field. It is part and
parcel of that which is Stanford. Remember the Big Game last year.
Think now. How did you feel when we sang the tttymn? We had lost
but could still show the world the Spirit of Stanford.
That is why it hurt to observe the rooting section Saturday. There was
a time we could point to the rowdy, boisterous California rooting section
and cry "Shame, shame." Can we do that .today?
This losing business is bad, but this Stanford team is not going to keep
losing. They have the stuff, the coach, and from you, the student body,
the spirit to win. It is easy to show spirit when you are winning; but
it means a lot more to do so when the breaks go the other way.
Someday we will all be on the outside of the rooting section looking in,
either in the Stadium or over the radio. Will you be proud to hear the
rooting section of your school imitate Cal?
This weekend many of us will travel to the UCI.A game. We will be
outnumbered by the vast UCLA rooting section. But win or lose, let's
show the Stanford Spirit.
Thank Gawd for the Monday morning quarterbacks! While we're at it,
let's thank someone for those fellows who sit behind you at the football
game and holler to the coach to play so-and-so and to do this or that.
We've a mad on now and this is as good a time as any to unload
something that has been building up for a long time. It took Saturday's
game to bring it out, but here goes.
Some of the actions of the Stanford rooting section at the Santa Clara
game approached the ultimate low for courtesy, common sense, and
plain school spirit.
For instance, a loud-mouthed red-headed guy in the row back of me
started moaning and groaning when Coach Marchie Schwartz withheld
quarterback Tom Shaw from the game for the better part of the first half.
He wasn't the only one, though. Before long a large part of the rooting
section took up the cry, "We want Shaw."
For the most part, those who were doing the chanting learned their
football between 2:30 and about 5 on Saturday afternoons. Sure, they
read the papers during the week. But, that little dabbing football lore
enables them to second guess the coach, a man who has been working
with the players for several years and knows the potentialities of each
and every man on his squad.
Team, Coaches Realize Rooters" Feelings
Take this instance, for example. Shaw, a fine quarterback by the way,
had been in the hospital for two of the five days the team had been prac
ticing for the Santa Clara game. As the season goes on, the coaches install
new plays to make up for the ones that have been scouted by the op
ponents and to give added strength to their offense.
Perhaps our vociferous fan had not attended any of the practices during
the week before the game. It so happened that Schwartz had installed a
new series of plays that involved a direct pass to the fullback. The full

game, and Pete Doe (probably a fraternity brother) is still sitting on
the bench.
We always come back to the fact that Stanford has lost three out of
four games this year. But wait now, are things as bad as they seem? Just
about all of us left the Oregon game satisfied with our team's performance.
We met a good team, had two very bad breaks in a flpss interference
ruling and a pass interception by an end, and lost 20 to 12. We did not
hear very much complaining that Saturday.
The next week, the lack of a working passing attack caused the In
dians to go down before a good Washington State team. Saturday we
fumbled eight times, and lost the ball six times, and were behind 27 to 0
at one point. And, remember, two of the Broncos' four touchdowns were
a result of two of those fumbles. Cancel out those instances and the score
might well have been reversed.
Sliaw Had Not Practiced New Plays
The team, the coaches, and this writer can appreciate the feelings of
the student body. Nobody likes a loser, not even when there are extenu
ating circumstances. A loser is a bum, a winner is a hero. That is not
the way it should be, that is not the way that it was last year.
One of the reasons that a lot of us come to Stanford, aside from the
high scholastic rating, is the great family spirit that we have heard about.
This reporter has seldom been as proud as he was the night that the
student body presented a plaque to a team '"nine times defeated, they
never lost their spirit."
That spirit isn't something generated on the football field. It is part and
parcel of that which is Stanford. Remember the Big Game last year.
Think now. How did you feel when we sang the tttymn? We had lost
but could still show the world the Spirit of Stanford.
That is why it hurt to observe the rooting section Saturday. There was
a time we could point to the rowdy, boisterous California rooting section
and cry "Shame, shame." Can we do that .today?
This losing business is bad, but this Stanford team is not going to keep
losing. They have the stuff, the coach, and from you, the student body,
the spirit to win. It is easy to show spirit when you are winning; but
it means a lot more to do so when the breaks go the other way.
Someday we will all be on the outside of the rooting section looking in,
either in the Stadium or over the radio. Will you be proud to hear the
rooting section of your school imitate Cal?
This weekend many of us will travel to the UCI.A game. We will be
outnumbered by the vast UCLA rooting section. But win or lose, let's
show the Stanford Spirit.
Thank Gawd for the Monday morning quarterbacks! While we're at it,
let's thank someone for those fellows who sit behind you at the football
game and holler to the coach to play so-and-so and to do this or that.
We've a mad on now and this is as good a time as any to unload
something that has been building up for a long time. It took Saturday's
game to bring it out, but here goes.
Some of the actions of the Stanford rooting section at the Santa Clara
game approached the ultimate low for courtesy, common sense, and
plain school spirit.
For instance, a loud-mouthed red-headed guy in the row back of me
started moaning and groaning when Coach Marchie Schwartz withheld
quarterback Tom Shaw from the game for the better part of the first half.
He wasn't the only one, though. Before long a large part of the rooting
section took up the cry, "We want Shaw."
For the most part, those who were doing the chanting learned their
football between 2:30 and about 5 on Saturday afternoons. Sure, they
read the papers during the week. But, that little dabbing football lore
enables them to second guess the coach, a man who has been working
with the players for several years and knows the potentialities of each
and every man on his squad.
Team, Coaches Realize Rooters" Feelings
Take this instance, for example. Shaw, a fine quarterback by the way,
had been in the hospital for two of the five days the team had been prac
ticing for the Santa Clara game. As the season goes on, the coaches install
new plays to make up for the ones that have been scouted by the op
ponents and to give added strength to their offense.
Perhaps our vociferous fan had not attended any of the practices during
the week before the game. It so happened that Schwartz had installed a
new series of plays that involved a direct pass to the fullback. The full
back drops back to his right and throws a pass. For once, the T-formation
quarterback is called upon to drop back with his fullback and block.
Campbell had been practicing the play for a week. Shaw had seen the
play only in practice. Besides, Campbell, with his weight and experience,
is much the better blocker of the two.
Another case in point involves the rooting section and the selection of
the combination of men to be put into the game at one time. Let's take
the Stanford backfield, for an example.
Every back has his specialty. Some run a quick opener better than
others, some shine on the end sweeps, while others excell at pass catching.
But, and this is very important, all too few backs can do the afore
mentioned things and carry out their blocking asignments with equal
facility. Some of our present backs just can not block as well as others.
And some just can't block. It is the coach's business to know which boy
can perform the job the best, and which combination of backs is best for
a given situation.
Must Have lBocking Baeks Too
Two of our better running backs, boys who play a lot of ball each
Saturday, are definitely poor blockers. Marchie can not afford to play
both of them at once.
Enter the rooting section. We in the student body can not know all
these little things that cause the coach to play a certain back at a certain
time. One of the assistant coaches is watching the play from the press
box. He notes the weaknesses of the opponents and phones same to the
players' bench. Marchie, using this information, chooses a player he
knows can perform best in this certain situation. Some guy in the thirty
eighth row starts to holler that all is lost, Joe Smoo has gone into the
game, and Pete Doe (probably a fraternity brother) is still sitting on
the bench.

Think now. How did you feel when we sang the tttymn? We had lost
but could still show the world the Spirit of Stanford.
That is why it hurt to observe the rooting section Saturday. There was
a time we could point to the rowdy, boisterous California rooting section
and cry "Shame, shame." Can we do that .today?
This losing business is bad, but this Stanford team is not going to keep
losing. They have the stuff, the coach, and from you, the student body,
the spirit to win. It is easy to show spirit when you are winning; but
it means a lot more to do so when the breaks go the other way.
Someday we will all be on the outside of the rooting section looking in,
either in the Stadium or over the radio. Will you be proud to hear the
rooting section of your school imitate Cal?
This weekend many of us will travel to the UCI.A game. We will be
outnumbered by the vast UCLA rooting section. But win or lose, let's
show the Stanford Spirit.
