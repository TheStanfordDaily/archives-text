strength—is a stark, grim necessity
if we are to live and go forward.
Free nations must be strong or they
will lose their freedoms. Peace-
Loving nations must be strong—or
there can be no peace."

From Spokane, Governor Earl
Warren uncorked a bristling attack
Dn the Truman Administration, ac
cusing the President of "ugly" crim

in "turmoil." The twelve states of
:he traditionally Democratic South
.ire in "open revolt." At a time of
•risis, the American people are
'without adequate leadership."
Pressing the necessity of unity,

urged the American people in every
contact I have been able to make
ivith them to assume the responsi
bility of solving our problems, not
is partisans, but as Americans."

Hartley Labor Law.
The President slapped at the en
tire Republican Party on grounds

expels them."
Dewey Speaks
Governor Thomas E. Dewey as
serted in Oklahoma City, "The time
has come for national leadership
which will measure up to our devo

and defeatism and despair" which
he attributed to the Truman ad
ministration.
Promising mobilization of the
country's strength, the governor de
clared: "The plain fact is that
strength—economic, military, moral
strength—is a stark, grim necessity
if we are to live and go forward.
Free nations must be strong or they
will lose their freedoms. Peace-
Loving nations must be strong—or
there can be no peace."
