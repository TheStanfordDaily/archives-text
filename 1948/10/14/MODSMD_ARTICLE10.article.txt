# Parade, Band To Greet Team
## 
### 
A jalopy parade accompanied by
a surprise novelty band will escort
the football team and the band to
the SP depot tomorrow night, UC
LA rally chairmen Lynn Powell and
Gordon Luce said.
All women are asked to bring
their jalopies to Lagunita, and all
men to bring theirs to the top of
the Row, from where the two
groups will start promptly at 8:30
toward the depot. Any residence
not owning an old car should enter
their newest one in the parade,
Luce said.
Alan Day, master of ceremonies,
will introduce Marchie Schwartz
and the team captain, who will both
give short talks. Injun Jo and Injun
Josephine, as well as the Glee Club,
will entertain at the rally, Miss
Powell added.
