LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13 (/P).â€”'The
political feud between Gov. Earl
Warren and State Attorney General
Fred N. Howser over slot machine
protection charges centered today on
the legal status of an attorney serv
ing the Governor's Crime Commis
sion.
Howser, the state's chief law en
forcement officer, ruled yesterday
that the salary of Warren Olney 111,
counsel for the Governor's Commis
sion on Organized Crime, cannot be
paid by the state. However, today
Howser stated that there is a legal
way in which Olney may be re-hired
by the Commission.
Olney served as a deputy attorney
general when Warren was attorney
general.
Earlier today Gov. Warren de
clared that Olney will be kept on the
job even if he has to pay his salary
himself. Warren, en route to Spo
kane on his Vice-Presidential cam
paign tour, said of Olney:
"He has performed his duties fear
lessly and in accordance with the
public interest. The people must

know what the facts are concerning
organized crime in our state."
The political battle between War
ren and Howser started when
the Governor's Crime Commission
charged that men representing them
selves as speaking for the attorney
general's office had attempted to set
up slot machine protection pay-off
rackets in several California coun
ties. Howser has denied the charges.
In a letter sent to Admiral William
H. Standley, chairman of the Gover
nor's commission, Howser said today:
"The acts of the Legislature seem
to be clear that no commission or
state agency may employ private
counsel without special permission of
the State Legislature or consent of
the attorney general. I was required
therefore to rule that the employ
ment for your honorable commission
of Mr. Warren Olney 111 was without
authority in law.
