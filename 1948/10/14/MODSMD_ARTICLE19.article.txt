# Draft Will Hit Estimated 1700 Stanford Students
## 
### 
The new draft law will have far
reaching effects on Farm life, says
Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton. With only part of the
story on the deferment setup
known at the present time, things
are extremely confused in both the
academic and administrative ar
rangements for the future. An es
timated 1,700 students will be eli
gible for induction.
As the situation now stands, de
ferments can be assured only to
World War II veterans, engineering
students, and medical students. As
for the status of men majoring in
physical, mineral, and biological
sciences, legislation is contemplat
ed but nothing very definite can be
said as yet. It is expected that at
least phvsics and chemistry stu
dents will be deferred. Premedical
students will not be exempt. To
qualify for a medical school defer
ment, one must either be actually
enrolled in or be able to present a
letter of admission to med school.
(At Stanford, letters of admission
are sent out on March 1.
Men enrolled in advanced ROTC,
AROTC. and NROTC courses and
in good standing wlil be exempt,
but deferment of those in the basic
courses will depend upon the num
ber of deferments assigned to the
local units by the Secretary of De
fense.
Vets Deferred
Veterans who served 90 days on
active duty during the actual
course of the war. or 12 months not
in the war period, will be deferred.
Those who did not serve the full
time will be draft-eligible, although
they will be given preference and
probably will not go at first.
All people enrolled for the cur
vent acadmeie year, which does not

] include summer quarter, will not
' be subject to call until summer.
Reservists Exempt
Those who joined the National
Guard or the Naval Organized Re
serve before June 24 will not be
i drafted, but the status of men in
! the Marine Platoon Leaders' Corps
will not be officially known until
February. Those who signed up in
the reserves after June 24 will not
be deferred, but their cases will be
given special consideration. (June
j 24 was the date of signing of Pub-
I lie Law 759.)
Those who wish deferments as
| conscientious objectors must pre
j sent evidence, preferably from a
minister who has known them for
some time. Only religious reasons
will be accepted.
Married Men Safe
Married men will be deferred,
but the deadline on the marriages
has not been set yet.
The draft is expected to hit the
sophomore class of next year ('52)
the hardest, and the junior class
| next. Other students need not
worry as much, since seniors and
j graduate students are almost all
! vets, and the new freshmen will be
for the most part under 19.
Administration Concerned
The administration is concerned,
for without definite information,
I they will be unable to set the num
ber of admissions and course of
i ferings. The athletic program may
I also be hard hit.
Information concerning the draft
and one's personal status may be
obtained at the office of Willard
: Waterous, assistant counselor for
men and military adviser. His of-
I fiee is in Temporary Building A.
