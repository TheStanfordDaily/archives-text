## Demerit System 
### 
Women's Council last Thursday introduced a new penalty
system for social regulations to AWS which affects one-fourth of
:he Stanford student body. This system would replace the cur
rent system of lock-ins and bonuses.
The so-called "demerit" system is promising in itself because
it would accomplish the objectives of student responsibility in
upholding social regulations. It would also promote uniformity
of the present penalty system. However, objections have been
raised toward the Council's protective attitude in the establish
ment ol the plan.
Because it is a penalty system, the new device technically
does not come up for the women students' vote. Instead it is
imposed by Council, whose first and last word is final. A hap
hazard vote has been suggested whereby house presidents may
vote upon the plan in AWS. Actually, this vote would have no
effect, even if the results were negative. The vote would be
unfair because the personal opinion of each house president
does not express the desires of individual women.
When the passage of such a penalty system affects two thou
sand women, we feel that Council should have placed the plan
before a campus-wide vote of all women.
Because many women have been confused by the plan, such
a vote should be taken only after a reasonable period of dis
cussion and publicity through the proper mediums. One house
meeting has not proved sufficient for itg comprehension by
all of the women.
After the plan has successfully passed a campus-wide vote,
it should be given a trial to test the actual long-range conse
quences. In this respect, Council has failed by establishing a
permanent system almost immediately without giving its own
child" a fair chance.—S. R.
