## How Naive Are Freshmen Women? 
### 
To the Editor:
Of all the students at Stanford, the freshman girl probably has a greater
weight on her shoulders than any of the other groups. The first few
weeks of college are the hardest—in every respect new students have
difficulty adjusting themselves to such a new life; but for girls the situa
tion is heightened by those who are supposed to help the newcomers.
Academically, this school is a real grind—that cannot be helped. But
socially there exist problems equally as burdensome and time-consuming.
As if the freshman girls didn't have enough responsibility already with
•heir studies and activities, rigid artificial social regulations are forced
upon them way out of proportion to their importance.
The whole emphasis of the girls' living groups is social responsibilities.
Regulations are hurled at them to be committed to memory. Corridor
meetings consume unnecessary time each week, and last so long that girls
are often worn out fronl lack of sleep the next day. These meetings are
usually trivial re-hashings of social regulations.
Compulsory "educational" meetings force the girls to Branner, all on
the assumption that the "children" need sexual guidance. Lockouts and
"technicals" many of the girls scared to death". And the regulations
lire bad enough without the perpetual threatening that goes with them.
Examples are too obvious and too numerous to be enumerated here.
When do social regulations stop being useful and constructive, and
become unnecessary petty rules that hinder normal life here at the Farm?
Why are social regulations made with only the socially naive girl in
mind; why don't they assume the more positive premise that the girl
who gets into Stanford is a superior type of individual who can govern
herself without getting into trouble?
Unless this premise is wrong, and the laws should truly be directed at
the immature exception who never should have been allowed to slip
away from Mama's apron strings, I propose that those in charge delegate
even more responsibility of conduct to the girls themselves, instead of
making it even tougher with this disgraceful AWS plan. I pose this
question: are the freshman girls really as socially weak as the regula
tions suppose?
