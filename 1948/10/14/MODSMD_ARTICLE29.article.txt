# We Dare You To Print This

To the Editor:
We think that The Daily's editorial stand on the draft is ridiculous,
;.r.d influenced by certain officials in the administration, and strongly
recommend that you print some of Wallace's wonderful comments on
the world situation, if you're not afraid—fn fact, we dare you to print this
in your "Letters to the Editor."

(The first draft of the editorials in question were written 900 miles
removed from Stanford. Actually, since only a few minor officials com
mented on the editorial, the editor has no way of knowing whether the
administration approved the editorials—or even read them. —Ed.)
