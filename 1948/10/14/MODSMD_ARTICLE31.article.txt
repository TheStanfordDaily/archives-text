Dear Mom:
We were having a bull session
the * other day at Encina, and we
worked around to the subject of
"What one thing here at Stanford
has impressed us the most?"
Of the four other fellows with
whom I was talking, three of them
deliberated for only a moment be
fore they decided either the spir
itual life or the church. That came
from several fellows who, like me,
ordinarily went to church just at
Christmas and at Easter.
Now as I think over the activities
of the first week at Stanford, there
is one event that clearly sticks in
my memory — Freshman Sunday.
We all attended church together
that first Sunday—our first time as
a class. The men were on one side
and the women on the other, clear
to the doors. More of us joined to
gether for that service than for any
other pre-reg activity, I believe.
There were frosh representing
nearly every church. Some knelt
for the prayers and others bowed
their heads. Some said "debtors"
and others said "trespassers" dur
ing the Lord's Prayer. No one wor
ried about it. It was not like most
non-denomination#l services — for
mal, stiff, and conventional. It had
a welcome naturalness.
When one of the speakers gave a
short welcoming message, he em
phasized the history of the Memo
rial Church, saying, "Mrs. Stanford
meant this to be both the physical
and the spiritual center of the cam
pus. We want you to make it the
center of your lives."
Before, when I attended church
services, I always felt a kind of
disinterest in the Scripture read
ings. They seemed to be a kind of
time-filler which the minister used
to lengthen his service. But when
students read the lessons, they pre
sent thought which often apply di
rectly to college life.
The setting of Stanford's church
itself is so conductive to worship
that it is a pleasure to spend a
Sunday morning there. The acous
tics favor the well - trained choir
voices which float overhead from
the rear balcony and echo through
out the long cathedral-styled chap
el. The sun shining through the
stained-glass windows on the hand
painted mosaics adorning the walls
makes the faccs look different from
time to time. I heard one fellow
say. "I've been here for two years
and have never noticed that angel
before."
From the outside the church can
be seen all the way down Univer
sity Avenue as it rises in the cen
ter of Inner Quad. It is around this
building that is built a fine tradi
tion of the Stanford Family.--Jim
