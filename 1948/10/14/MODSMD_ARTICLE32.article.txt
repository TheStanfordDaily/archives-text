We came across an elderly gen
tleman of faculty appearance last
week who would like to see an old
French custom started on the Farm.
He suggested that the University
provide bottles of red and while
wine for every table at the Cellar.
He conceded that havoc might reign
for the first two weeks, but pre
dicted that the custom might de
velop into an orderly tradition.

An atmosphere of sadness floated
over the office of the local humor
book the other day—the Dean ad
vised them to draw another cover.
It seems that the Old Boy was let
ting his mind wander to other
things not covered by the activities
of campus life. Judgment from the
higher office is optional, and is
sought only when the boys get car
ried away. P.S. They hope to sneak
the drawing in sometime.

Seen on campus: A gal who is all
ears for the Progressive party; her
earrings are "Wallace '48" buttons.

The Sigma Nu men lookd mighty
relieved when they faced the music
at their ball last weekend. The
more Cugat packed them in, the
more the looming assessment drop
ped. A rash of ticket selling at the
door pulled them out of the mid
week depression.
