## Bull Session 
### 
My attention was caught the other day by a poster advertising the
forthcoming production of "Othello" by the drama department. This
opening sentence is, of course, leading to a gag, so don't say you weren't
warned. It's the one about the Encina freshman who thought he would
be a natural for Shakespeare because he knew all the lines to "Romeo.''

No, dear, not to "Romeo and Juliet." The one he
knew was "Romeover in the Clover."

Speaking of entertainment, you could do much
worse than invest 74 of your precious coppers in "A
Foreign Affair," which is currently gracing one ol
the local screens. Jean Arthur, she of the squeaky
voice; John Lund, he of the usually hammy per
formances; and Marlene Dietrich, she of the gorgeous
gams, vintage .1830, all turn in top-flight jobs in
this Paramount comedy about post-war Europe.

Add two things we didn't know before:
(1) That, while he was a member of the Stanford track team in 1!)2S,
Bud Spencer, now sports editor of the Scripps-Howard San Francisco
News, set a record in the 400-meter clash that stood for four years. The
time: 47 flat.
(2) That our lead-ofl quip of last Tuesday's column would cause such
a furor among some of the more refined girls of Lagunita Court. (Now,
quick, find that paper!) But after re-reading said item for the hundredth
time, girls, I'm inclined to agree with you.
I had a hard weekend.

It's bargain day today. We got lotsa good deals.
First of all comes a short pitch for this all-expenses-paid trip to New
York for the Stanford-Army game on the 6th of November. The $350
excursion, including a round-trip ticket via TWA Constellation, is being
offered to some Stanford student by a well-known Peninsula restaurant
whose initials are Rickey's Studio Club. Details of the contest will be
announced at Rickey's tomorrow night. Sounds interesting.
Good deals continued. Item number two.
Obviously some misguided soul in San Francisco thinks that the Stan
ford students actually read this column. The point is that on my desk
before me I have several dozen cards which were given to me by one
of the praise agents of the Palace Hotel in the city. On them is printed
the following:
"Upon presentation to 'Adolph,' Headwaiter in the Palace Hotel Garden
Room, this card will entitle you to two complimentary cover charges on
Friday evening, October 15th. Music by Frankie Masters."
In other words, keeds, if you should feel an overpowering urge to qo
to the Palace Hotel tomorow night, drop a card with your name and
residence on it to me at The Daily Shack today, so I can get one of
these 3-dollar-saving ducats to you sometime tomorrow. Seriously.
Nevei let it be said that Comrade Dailey does not share his good
deals with the other comrades.
