The question of preparedness has
been lately much kicked aVound by
Daily editors and correspondents,
and the fundamental question to
which the discussion seems to boil
down is this: Does preparedness dis
courage or encourage war?
As regards the United States, we
cannot say that preparedness has

ever Kept us out
of war in the
past —we have
never been pre
pared. We can
say, on the oth
er hand, that
lack of a stand
ing army (and,
should one say,
of a floating
navy and flying
air force?) has

never stopped us from jumping inlo
a war.
If we look to the continent of
Europe, as inevitably we will, it
seems that nations large and small,
in all states of preparedness and
unpreparedness, have started wars,
become involved in wars, and fin
ished wars. In other words, the
results of that test are inconclu
sive. If we go back to the great
days of Rome, we find that a world
dominion based primarily on or
ganized military power gave its
world approximately 200 years of
peace. No one has equaled that rec
ord since.
The evidence is, to my mind,
more than inconclusive. Serious
consideration of the facts could lead
a reasonable man, whether in Con
gress, in the White House, or in the
street, to conclude lhat prepared
ness was worth trying — for a
change.
There is another point to make.
If we cannot have peace (and war
is certainly a possibility), we had
better do whatever wo can to make
sure we have victory. It seems log
ical to say that a prepared nation
can more easily repel an attack
than one unprepared. Those there
are who will ask, "What Rood is an
army against modern atomic, bio
logical, push-bulton warfare?" The
best answer I have to that is a

statement by Army Chief of Stall
Omar Bradley (in this month's In
fantry Journal) to the effect that
the reasoned conclusion of the
General StafT, after investigation
and study, is that the so-called
"push-button" war is too far in
the future to dispense with the us
ual ground and service forces. This
should be sufficient justification for.
at least, the short-term draft bill
now in force.
Opposition to the draft has, in
some cases, been by those with an
over-high regard for the aims or
at least the motives of Russia. But
the greater part of conscriptions
opponents are honestly convinced
that because war is evil, military
training is evil. There arc two an
swers to that. Sometimes war is the
lesser of two evils. And it is still
to be demonstrated to my satisfac
tion that preparedness means war.
