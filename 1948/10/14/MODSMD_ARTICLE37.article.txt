# 'Tap Roots' Offers New Slant to Civil War Story
## 
### 
The Confederacy during the Civil *
War is given a new slant in "Tap j
Roots," starring Van Hcflin and Su- i
i-an Hayward.
Van Heflin, as (he illegitimate son
>112 a high Washington official, turns
:n a successful performance as a
notorious lover, although his crude
handling of Susan Hayward in a j
secluded spot seems a little out of
character with his supposedly
smooth manner.
Bond Valley Owner
Ward Bond is his usual thundering
self as the arrogant owner of Leba
non Valley—the valley which de
clared itself neutral and seceded
from Mississippi when Mississippi
seceded from the Union.
Heflin decides to help Ward Bond
in his mad scheme to hold Lebanon
Valley against the Confederates and
"he Yankees by publishing in his
widely read newspaper an appeal for
men to come join their forces.
Love Interest
His i - eal reason is his avid desire
to win the love of Susan Hayward,
who is already in love with a Con
federate army officer, Whitfield Con
nor.
A newcomer to the screen, Connor
does a pretty convincing job of
making himself disliked by the audi
ence by ' continually reminding
everyone that "I am a soldier." His
sccret rendezvous with Susan's sis
ter while Susan is lying in bed para
lyzed, does little to add to his popu
larity.
KarlofT Plays Indian
Boris KarlofT, as an Indian, is an
interesting departure from his usual
monster roles.
Although the plot is sometimes
complicated, it is easy to follow..
If you like good technicolor, action,
and Susan Hayward in a peek-a-boo
strapless dress, don't miss. "Tap
Roots," now playing at the San Car- |
os theater.—Gordon Ness.
