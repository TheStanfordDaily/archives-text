# Indians-Bruins Clash In 19th Renewal of Series
## 
### JOHN HALL 
When the Injun band rolls into circus land next Saturday a
ternoon, Los Angeles Coliseum fans will be dished up the 19t
serving of the Stanford-UCLA Blue Plate Special.
Of the 18 games already played, Stanford's Vow and
Boys and a few favored others have managed to grab up mo;

♦•of the meat and potatoes to give tl
! homebreds a comfortable 11 to
! bulge in games won. But recei
1 years have seen Stanford's sha
i turn to cold soup.
UCLA has ripped off thr<
I straight wins, 35) to 6 in 1947, 26
! 6 in 1946, and 21 to 7 in 1942. Tl
Indians have been starved for s
years now while UCLA has lapp<
up all the gravy.
Crowds Turn Out
Although the series has alwa
been well attended, and probab
will be again this year, the 19
contest doesn't seem to offer
[ much as some of the previo
struggles, as already twice - beat
UCLA plays host to already thric
j beaten Stanford.
It's a far cry from the menu t
j fans were treated to back in 19:
j when a Rose Bowl bound - UCI
j squad invaded the Stadium to m<
Stanford in a supposedly routi
I pushover — only to have Ti
| ThornhilPs oft-defeated eleven r
I up to smite the Bruins by holdi
i them to a 14 to 14 deadlock a
push them out of the Bowl.
And then in 1940 a man nam
Clark served Tea on the Colisei
lawn, and the fabulous Pete Kim
ovich matched notes on the art
open field running with Jacl
Robinson, while 90.000 stunned 112;
watched the Shaugbnessy mira
unfold as Stanford drove to a 20
I 14 win.
Another great game was pla>
in 1935. The Vow Boys were m
\ lowed seniors, and had already be
| tabbed a cinch to cop the leap
title and represent the West in
| Rose Bowl for their third suco
I sive year.
So when Bill Spaulding brou
his poor kids up from that brar
school in LA, they all laughed ;
i smiled knowing smiles. Howe\
as often is the case in those siti
tions, UCLA got in the last lai
by going home with a 7 to 6 up
tucked under its cap.
Stanford Steamrolls
Stanford didn't feel too g<
' about dropping that one, so
1 should be mentiond right av
that the Cards have wallowed
holy heck out of the Bruins sevc
times to make up for it. Such at
1941 when the year - old Model
1 (only driven a few thousand yar
j screeched to a 33 to 0 landslide
In 1929 the Pop Warner slude
I of the game smashed to an e*
greater, 57 to 0. win. Largest sc
1 of the series was run up in the v
: first meeting between the t
, schools in 1925, when the Indi
i pulled on their track shoes to p
! lop to an 82 to 0 all-time high.
