## Bay Area Features Three Top Grid Clashes This Weekend 
### 
Bay Area gridirons offer an unusually tempting diet to stay-at-home
otball fans this weekend. We're referring to the California-Oregon
ate battle at Berkeley on Saturday, the USF-Oklahoma A&M inter
ctional at Kezar the same afternoon, and to the St. Mary's-Nevada

erry-go-round on the Kezar turf
inday—all within easy commuting
stance of the Stanford campus.
Tastiest morsel on this inviting
U of fare will, of course, be Cal's
48 debut into conference compe
ion against the Beavers from
•rvallis.
Now that Happy Pappy's crew has
en awarded a round-trip ticket to
sadena by most of the San Fran
co sportswriters without even
lying a conference game, the Bea
rs will be out to see that the men
blue earn their way. Coach Lon
ner's team is set, and equipped
do just that.
Supplied with a right halfback
10 passes left handed (Don Sam
-1) and two left halfbacks who
) from the starboard side (Dick
ay and Ken Carpenter), Stiner
5 again polished up his optional
is play, an innovation which over

i years has done more to confound OSC opponents than all the other
•tball in the Beavers' offense.
Samuel Runs, Passes for Touchdowns
iVorking off a single wing, Samuel takes a direct pass from center and
is wide to his left. Part of the time he passes, and part of the time
tucks the pigskin under his arm and heads for»pay dirt —all depend
; upon what the defensive situation looks like. Carpenter and Gray
wide the same menace to the opposite flank. Then Dick Twenge, 197
ands of fullback, cracks up the center for something like a 4.9-yards
•-carry average.
This week's statistics from the office of Conference Commissioner Victor
Schmidt reveal that Samuel now leads all conference backs in the
al offense department with 491 net yards gained in four games. He
s fifth in that division last season. Carpenter has thus far this year
ched 12 passes, completed 10 for an average of .833. -Gray has hit
receivers 13 times out of 20 for a .050 mark.
Dregon State will field a better squad Saturday than any that the
■lden Bears have played this year. Cal's reputation has been built
at the expense of four second-rate teams. None of them—with the
■;ible exception of Santa Clara—are destined to go anywhere this season.
This is not to suggest that Oregon State is a top-drawer ball club—
t enough experience up front for that. But the BeaveVs are on their
y up and before the afternoon is over could throw quite a scare into
■ "mighty" Golden Bear.
}ver at Kezar a corporal's guard of USF faithful is expected out to
tch the Hilltoppers take it on the chin from another orange and black
i outfit—The Cowboys from Oklahoma A&M.
The Aggies haven't come up with another Fenimore. but they're big.
y're tough, and they should be favored by two TDs.
Heath ( doming Back to Kezar
.nd on Sunday Nevada brings the nation's number one yardage gainer,
n Heath, and his three ring aerial circus into Kezar to tangle with
Mary's—the team that rubbed some of the gilt off the Golden Bear,
his Heath is quite a passer. He throws 'em long, he throws 'em
rt, he throws 'em everywhere—all with the same uncanny accuracy.
;1 on the ground there's as nifty an assortment of speedy backs as
i*ll ever see. Gents like Tommy Kalmanir, Ted Kondel. and Sherman
vard can do everything with a ball but swallow it. Up in the line
re's a burly bunch of guys who take this business of blocking and
<ling rather seriously. They're good.
md if you're looking for something to do during the half, you might
/ a program and count just how many of the Nevada players actually
lie from Nevada. It won't take long.
"here's enough good football here to tempt anyone's grid palate. So
,-ou're not going South why not hop into that jalopy and go "see how
other half lives?"
