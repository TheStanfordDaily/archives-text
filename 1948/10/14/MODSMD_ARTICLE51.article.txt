# Best Defense Nowadays Means Sparkling Offense

iEW YORK. Oct. 13 (/P).—De
rive football, with its accom
ying cry of "hold that line," ap
entlv has been tossed right off
nation's gridirons as teams con
nate solely on spectacular, wide
n attacks.
ollege coaches, perhaps in an
rt to please the folks who con
ute something like $4.40 each
Saturday to their annual sal
•s, seem generally to have
pted the theory that a good of
;e is not only the best defense
the only defense.
t least, such is the indication
tained in the defensive statistics
he major elevens announced to
by the National Collegiate Ath
; Bureau.
hese show that North Carolina
e owns the best overall defen
. record; that Wyoming tops all
other teams in defense against
ind attack, and that Northwest
leads in aerial defense—a reve
>n which will not surprise UC-
Purdue, or Minnesota.
ut the unusual angle is the fact
all these leaders have given
y chunks of yardage far in ex
of that yielded by their prede-

: cessors in other years at this stage
I of the season.
North Carolina State, for in
stance, leads in total defense al
though it has allowed Duke. Clem
son, and Davidson a total of 407
yards both on the ground and in
the air. A year ago at this time.
North Carolina State's present de
fensive average of 135.7 yards
yielded per game was bettered by
no less than 13 teams.
The Statistical Bureau says this
is the first time in its history that
the season has reached this point
without a single team boasting a
defensive average of less than 100
yards per game.
Probably the best illustration of
how the defense has collapsed is
the situation at Penn State, whose
all-victorious 1947 team wound up
the season with the best defensive
record in the country.
Still undefeated, Penn State has
given up 301 yards in two games
this season and stands eighth
among the defensive leaders. By
contrast, the Nittanv Lions yielded
only 691 yards in nine games last
{ year.

stance, leads in total defense al
though it has allowed Duke. Clem
son, and Davidson a total of 407
yards both on the ground and in
the air. A year ago at this time.
North Carolina State's present de
fensive average of 135.7 yards
yielded per game was bettered by
no less than 13 teams.
The Statistical Bureau says this
is the first time in its history that
the season has reached this point
without a single team boasting a
defensive average of less than 100
yards per game.
Probably the best illustration of
how the defense has collapsed is
the situation at Penn State, whose
all-victorious 1947 team wound up
the season with the best defensive
record in the country.
Still undefeated, Penn State has
given up 301 yards in two games
this season and stands eighth
among the defensive leaders. By
contrast, the Nittanv Lions yielded
only 691 yards in nine games last
{ year.

rive football, with its accom
ying cry of "hold that line," ap
entlv has been tossed right off
nation's gridirons as teams con
nate solely on spectacular, wide

ollege coaches, perhaps in an

ute something like $4.40 each
Saturday to their annual sal

the only defense.

he major elevens announced to
by the National Collegiate Ath

hese show that North Carolina

other teams in defense against
ind attack, and that Northwest
leads in aerial defense—a reve

Purdue, or Minnesota.
ut the unusual angle is the fact
all these leaders have given
y chunks of yardage far in ex
of that yielded by their prede-

: cessors in other years at this stage
