Have you ever heard ot a foot
ball team winning a crucial game
by intentionally fumbling the ball?
Well, it all happened back in 1942
in St. Louis, Missouri.
John Burroughs and Country
Day schools had been rivals in the
traditional Cal - Stanford theme
since 192G and during all that time
Burroughs hadn't managed so much
as one win. The closest they had
ever come were three ties.
But this year they were loaded
for bear. They hadn't lost a single
conference game all season and
they were currently tied for the
league leadership. A win over
Country Day for them and a loss
at the same time for their first
bracket opponents would set them
up in undisputed first place. Coun
try Day, on the other hand, had
been the league doormat all season.
They hadn't won a single game.
The day of the contest came and
Country Day opened the show by
lining up with an unbalanced line
to the right with the quarterback
tightly surrounded by the other
three backs. He took the pass from
center, laid the ball on the palm of
his left hand and, in volleyball
fashion, punched it out of bounds
with his right fist.
Chaos ensued. The referees went
into a huddle with the Country Day
coaches to get the straight word on
this newly unleashed secret weap

on. The ruling: "A fumble going
out of bftunds is retained by the
team last in possession before it
went out of bounds, and the ball
is put back in play where it went
out* 4 —a gain of some four yards for
Country Day.
The ball was put back in play
with a repeat performance pre
cisely. And so the afternoon wore
on with Country Day sustaining
one goal line drive after another.
When they got within a few yards
of the goal they would switch to
football and carry the mail to the
post office. I inal score—l 2 to 0.
Needless to say, the rule was
changed the following year.
