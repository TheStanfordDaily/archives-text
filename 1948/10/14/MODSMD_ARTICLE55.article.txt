In a Salt Lake City Softball
league (semi-pro) a few years back
there was quite a terrific pitching
ace. Under different names he was
pitching for two teams in the same
league and drawing down good
money for it. But came the finals
and he found that both of his teams
were in the final playoff.
He tiptoed softly from the scene,
joined another team in another
league . . . and went on to the
national playoffs.
