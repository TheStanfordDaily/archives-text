Miss Bibliophile, in a special state
ment to The Daily last night com
mented on the series of Trojan theme
contests that have taken Farm stu

"The Venus de Menlo contest for
girls with no arms is a farce, and
as for men with an eye in the mid
dle of the forehead, they've been
coming in for years."
Outdoor house decorations ideas
may be registered from 1 to 5 this
week at the ASSU Office, Jean Bur
net, chairman of House Decora
tions, said. Greek myths, Trojans,
and Indians, or just "the Hell with
Troy" are acceptable themes.
"There are cash prizes and tro
phies for the first and second place
winners among men's and women's
living units," co-chairman Dick
Reinhart said. "The judging will be
Friday night after the rally, so all
displays should be lighted.
All living groups are asked to put
up outside decorations, but out-of
the-way houses like Casa Ventura
and the small Union units may
decorate other parts of the campus if
arrangements are made with the
decorations chairman.
Arrangements are also being com
pleted for other aspects of the Car
dinals-sponsored celebration. Along
with the traditional Pajamarino Pa
rade, the rally, and a number of
open houses, will be an all-campus
dance Friday night, an alumni
luncheon Saturday, and the game.
