# Student 'Clip Joint' Exposed
## 
### JOHN SUTTHOFF 
One hundred Stanford men a day
are being clipped in an establish
ment which has been openly oper
ating on the campus since 1919. Be
sides, you have to pay $1 for the
fleecing.
Located on the crossroads of the
campus in the Old Union for 30
years, the Barber Shop has become
as integral a part of student, life
as the Cellar or Mangini's.
Open Tuesday through Friday
from 8:30 to 5:30, the "clip joint"
has been recently redecorated, and
now boasts a six-chair shop fea
turing the talents of "Whitey," Dick,
Charlie, Joe, Carrol, and Homer on
the scalp.
Long and Short
Catering to student tastes from
crew cuts to "burlaps"—a tonsorial
expression for "something like a
Hollywood, only square on top and
long on the sides"—the sextet has
found that the average Indian pref
erence is for a short haircut, just
long enough to comb.
As for shaves, the shop would fold
up in a week if its livelihood de
pended on blading beards. The big

gest day in the life of their "straight
Gillettes" was the return of a Geolo
gy expedition that was lost in Grand
Canyon for a week. A few razors
show the nicks caused by rocks em
bedded in an undergrad's bush. Oc
casionally the monotony is broken
by a fugitive from a "lost weekend"
with a bad case of the whiskey
shakes.
Few Coeds
Not many co-eds patronize the
shop. However, "Joe" recalls three
years ago when some panting "thing"
dashed in and picked a lock of hair
which had been shorn from the
noggin of some BMOC. A manicur
ist has been considered, but it was
sagely observed that "there are too
many males and too few nails."
Maintaining their worl d-w id e
reputation for shooting the breeze,
each barber feels qualified to dis
cuss any subject. "Athletics usually
dominate the conversation," stated
one chair-man, "but politics are be
ginning to replace football this fall."
Over half of the patrons pick up the
green sheet and keep their thoughts
to themselves.
Statistic Shop
Statisticians are welcomed to come
in and settle arguments over for
mer Stanford grid records by re
ferring to score cards dating back
to 1919 that hang from the molding.
In answer to inquiries and remarks
about the absence of the '47 season,
the management promises "immed
iate action as soon as the painter
feels better."
Since the death last November of
"Jim" Fowler, who established the
shop in 1919, the campus landmark
has been owned and operated by
Ben Fowler. An expert hunter, he
is now in Colorado shooting elk.

Long and Short
Catering to student tastes from
crew cuts to "burlaps"—a tonsorial
expression for "something like a
Hollywood, only square on top and
long on the sides"—the sextet has
found that the average Indian pref
erence is for a short haircut, just
long enough to comb.
As for shaves, the shop would fold
up in a week if its livelihood de
pended on blading beards. The big

gest day in the life of their "straight
Gillettes" was the return of a Geolo
gy expedition that was lost in Grand
Canyon for a week. A few razors
show the nicks caused by rocks em
bedded in an undergrad's bush. Oc
casionally the monotony is broken
by a fugitive from a "lost weekend"
with a bad case of the whiskey
shakes.
Few Coeds
Not many co-eds patronize the
shop. However, "Joe" recalls three
years ago when some panting "thing"
dashed in and picked a lock of hair
which had been shorn from the
noggin of some BMOC. A manicur
ist has been considered, but it was
sagely observed that "there are too
many males and too few nails."
Maintaining their worl d-w id e
reputation for shooting the breeze,
each barber feels qualified to dis
cuss any subject. "Athletics usually
dominate the conversation," stated
one chair-man, "but politics are be
ginning to replace football this fall."
Over half of the patrons pick up the
green sheet and keep their thoughts
to themselves.
Statistic Shop
Statisticians are welcomed to come
in and settle arguments over for
mer Stanford grid records by re
ferring to score cards dating back
to 1919 that hang from the molding.
In answer to inquiries and remarks
about the absence of the '47 season,
the management promises "immed
iate action as soon as the painter
feels better."
Since the death last November of
"Jim" Fowler, who established the
shop in 1919, the campus landmark
has been owned and operated by
Ben Fowler. An expert hunter, he
is now in Colorado shooting elk.
One hundred Stanford men a day
are being clipped in an establish
ment which has been openly oper
ating on the campus since 1919. Be
sides, you have to pay $1 for the
fleecing.
Located on the crossroads of the
campus in the Old Union for 30
years, the Barber Shop has become
as integral a part of student, life
as the Cellar or Mangini's.
Open Tuesday through Friday
from 8:30 to 5:30, the "clip joint"
has been recently redecorated, and
now boasts a six-chair shop fea
turing the talents of "Whitey," Dick,
Charlie, Joe, Carrol, and Homer on
the scalp.
