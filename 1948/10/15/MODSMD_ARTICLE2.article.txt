# Injuns Plot Paint Job at Bruin Den
## 
### 
A fiery red "C" with an "S" sten
ciled in its center is shining on
UCLA campus this morning if a
plot brewed by an adventurous
group of south-bound Indians went
through as planned.
Just before dawn this morning,
some of Injun Joe's kinsmen hoped
to climb to the cement "C" located
high on a hill above the campus and
douse it in tribe colors.
With plans worked out to the last
detail, the Stanford party expected
to quickly and quietly subdue the
guard of 15 pledges from UCLA fra
ternities stationed at vital points.
Stanford, it seems, went to Los
Angeles not only to win a football
game but literally to "paint the
town led."
