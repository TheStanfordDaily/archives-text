House Complications
Encina opened its doors in

iced. However, these were

San Fran-

the infantile paralysis was
1 before it could injure the
in permanently. And while
ncina directors held their

breath, the period of contagious
ness passed without any more out
breaks.
Rooms Scarce, Beds Short
A second problem was rooms and
beds. The interference of the Ad
ministration cut the resident en
rollment to 542 from 610 housed
last year, and some (50 frosh were
diverted to the Village. Even so,
more doubling up in available
space had to take place, with an
occasional single room being trans
formed into a double.
A shortage of seven - foot beds

was some problem to the excep
tionally numerous number of sky
scrapers. To qualify for a seven
foot bed, a resident had to be 6 feet
3. Anyone under was crimped into
a six-foot cot.
Noise Prevalent
The presence of the Administra
tion proved no damper on the frolic

traditional to the
freshman house.
Water - bagging, al
though prohibited,
still occurs occasion
ally, and a familiar
condemning shout
from below aimed at

the class of '52 brings everyone
within hearing to the window with
a double-barreled verbal barrage.
These antics are mostly confined to
the hours of darkness, however.
According to head sponsor Hank
Rosin, rowdyism is conducted with
"intelligent moderation," and in
stead of taking their boiling spirits
out on the building, the men are
digging into intramurals and house
activities.
Elections Coming
House and Excom representative
elections are coming up for Encina.
Corridor officers have already been
elected. As time goes on, the men
will take over control of their ex
ecutive board and council from the
sponsors, and by spring quarter will
run their government completely.
From all appearances, the frosh
men will continue to move freely
in the presence of the University
brass on the first floor, and the
"Spirit of '52" will make itself heard
and felt there and abroad during
this year and many more.




MRS. ELLENE SUMNER, Encina
resident director, was faced with
rouin shortages and a lack of
seven-foot beds when well over
500 I'rosh descended upon Encina
in September. The Administration
moved in at the same time, but
dorm spirit is high despite the
presence of University "brass."
