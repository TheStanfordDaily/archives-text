# Indians Seek First Conference Win
## Gridders Travel South for Bruin Game Tomorrow 
### JOHN HALL 
Thirty-eight determined var
sity football men boarded the
Lark last night, heading for Los
Angeles and what they hope
will be their first conference
win in two years. Stanford meets
the UCLA Bruins at 2 p.m. on Satur
day afternoon in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. Stanford and UCLA
Frosh play the prelim, starting at
noon.
As the gridders reached the
Southern Pacific station last night,
a small but spirited group of Indian
rooters were on hand to greet them.
The skies were threatening with
promise of rain in the air, and it
was a rather dismal scene as this
thrice-beaten Stanford squad pulled
out of Palo Alto.
But each man has promsed to up
set the dope sheet. All of them want
to come back to school with a win
under their belts. And this ballclub
can't be counted out by any means.
The men have the ability to win.
Man for man, they are as good as.
if not better, than the UCLA players.
All that is needed are a few good
breaks.
Marchie Schwartz had his men
working hard right up until the last
minute yesterday. He sent his
charges through several offensive
drills, with Aubrey Devine and
Emery Mitchell flipping the ball all
over the lot. Boyd Benson also
looked effective in several quick -
opening plays.
Bobby Rohrer, recently promoted
to first team guard, will captain
the squad Saturday. He will be
backed up by the regulars who have
started most of the games all sea
son. Don Fix will handle the other
guard spot. John Rosekrans will be
at center. Tackles are A 1 Rau and
Gordon White. Ends will be Gene
Martin, player of the week against
Santa Clara, and A 1 Laakso.
Ken Rose, first string end at the
beginning of the season, will make
the trip, but his injured ankle will
probably keep him out. Other in
juries include Dan Mervin and Bob
Ghilotti, both ends. Other than
these men, the team is well intact.
Coach Schwartz is still experi
menting with his backs and won't
come up with a starting combination
until game time. However, it's most
likely that Aubrey Devine will be
in there at quarter, Bobby Ander
son and Bob White at the halves, and
Emery Mitchell at full. Expected to
see the most defensive action in
ihe backfield are Dave Field and
Don Campbell.
