Tore than time flies at Stanford,
len it comes to flying, observe
)t members of the Stanford Flying
ib. During the warmer sunny
's, they guide their flying crates
the Santa Cruz and Monterey
ches, to the mountainous scenery
und Lake Tahoe, over the metro
itan Bay Area cities, or for quick

! jaunts to the large ex-Navy airfield
at Half Moon Bay.
Autumn and winter quarters show j
a decrease in flying time as the
wintry weather closes in, but the
flyers do schedule two or three cross
country sight-seeing flights. On
Sunday, several club members will
fly en masse to the Capitola Airport !
near Santa Cruz. Before the school 1
year ends, the club may participate |
I in an intercollegiate air meet with j
the University of California or with
| San Jose State College.
Weather may close out weekly
! flying trips during this quarter, but |
; the club will fall back on its out- j
; door program activity during the 1
I meetings held every other Monday 1
! night.
Next Monday, old and new club j
members will view two air naviga
tion movies. Every meeting is high
lighted by films, slides, or guest
speakers related to private aviation.
Monday's meeting at 7:30 p.m. in
the upper lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse will be open to students
I interested in joining the club.
Membership in the club is not re
stricted to pilots; rather, any stu
dent interested in aviation or in
participating in cross-country hops
as passengers may enroll in the or
ganization.
A "veteran" pilot is president of
the Stanford Flying Club. Ray Els
more has been flying planes nearly
as long as most students have been
driving cars.
Elsmore said the club may 'ook J
I into a young edtion to aviation later j
: this quarter when a tour is ar- |
; ranged of the Palo Alio helicopter |
i plant.
