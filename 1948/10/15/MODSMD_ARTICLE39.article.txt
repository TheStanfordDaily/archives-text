# Congress woman Seeks Money of Various Color
## 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
The claim has come up that the
U.S. Treasury hasn't been showing
enough imagination. The Republican
representative from Massachusetts,
Edith Noursc Rogers, thinks the mint
should issue money like the postage
stamp people do, a different color
for every denomination.
Just think how this would brighten
up the interiors of those dingy pock
etbooks. It would also help no end
in keeping all your $1 and $100,000
tills irom getting mixed up.
Checking back, however, we find I
that the Treasury has shown some j
little ingenuity in its minting and
printing. Around 1860, when every
one hadn't as yet waded th tough
their primers, in Tubac, Ariz., espe
cially, their paper money was printed

| with animals on it to represent il
j different denominations. A pig w
worth one bit (12' a cents), ac«
was worth two bits (or 25c), a roost
was worth half a a dollar, a hor
was worth a dollar, and a bi
brought five dollars.
Once a Nude
The U.S. even put out a nut
once upon a time. The lady w
supposed to be freedom instructii
youth, but the general pub
thought she was no lady. Th»
l thought she should wear clothes lil
I respectable teachcrs. So at ne
I bill-printing the government issu*
another picture and tiptoed soft
away.
And now there is another car
paigner for novelty. Ed Mchr<
thinks he has an idea that will sa
! the U.S. public five billion dolla
| a year. He suggests we mint coi
| worth 2V2 cents, 7'/2 cents ai
| 121/2 cents —or a pickle, halfway b
j tween a penny and a nickel;
I dicklc, halfway between a nickel ai
! a dime; and likewise a bit, half
| two bits.
He explains the savings as comi
in sofe drinks, sales taxes, tel
phones, magazines, and any oth
commodities and services which a
too cheap at five cents and too e
pensive at 10 cents. The Netherlan
I and Sweden both have seven coi
| under a quarter; we have but thn
Fractional Coinage
But this fractional coinage is
anything really revolutionary. En
lish pennies were once cast with
deep cross so that they might
broken in half as a half-penny,
in quarters as farthings. But tl
was back under William the Co
queror in 1060. Even as late as 18
I though, the U.S. put out a h
j dime .... which, incidentally, be
jno mention of the United Sta
j on it at all.
( Personally, I don't care whctl
it's new or old, fractional or who
| green or gray. If it's money, I thi
1 it's beautiful. Name me anythi
! else that will turn a man's he
, quicker than the rattle of men
.... except perhaps the rustic oi
skirt.

should issue money like the postage

up the interiors of those dingy pock
etbooks. It would also help no end
in keeping all your $1 and $100,000

Checking back, however, we find I
that the Treasury has shown some j
little ingenuity in its minting and
printing. Around 1860, when every

was worth half a a dollar, a hor
