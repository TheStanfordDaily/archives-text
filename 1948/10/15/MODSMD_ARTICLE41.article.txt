# Davis Reviews Stanford Parking Regulations
## 
### 
In order to clarify many ques
tions which students and others ask.
Police Chief Gordon Davis recently
outlined the regulations concerning
parking restrictions and violations.
Reserved parking areas are to be
found near each corner of the Quad
and outside the bullpen at Encina.
In addition, there are time limit
zones on Galvez Street on the west
side of Encina, near the Cellar, and
in front of the Bookstore.
Yellow Lines
Yellow curb lines indicate that
the zone is reserved for commercial
vehicles during business hours, but
may be used by any other vehicles
before and after business hours.
White curb lines mark points at
which drivers may stop to pick up
or discharge passengers, but may
not leave the car.
Vehicles may not be parked
within 15 feet on either side of a

fire hydrant, but cars may be
stopped in these areas providing
that the driver does not leave the
car.
Reserved Space
Reserved parking zones are not
set aside for the faculty as a group,
but only for certain members of the
academic staff and council, as well
as certain other faculty members,
depending on circumstances affect
ing their duties. In addition, cer
tain students with serious physical
handicaps are provided with re
serve parking stickers. Unless they
fall within one of these classifica
tions, drivers are not permitted to
park in reserved zones, regardless
of weather conditions or other cir
cumstances.
"All parking violations carry a
two - dollar penalty," Chief Davis
said, "and if allowed to become de

linquent draw an additional one- |
dollar delinquency fee."
'"Money collected from traffic i
violations is used to further the j
academic endeavor of the Univer
sity," Davis added.
