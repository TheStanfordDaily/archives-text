## Export American Story

In her question and answer column of a national magazine,
Eleanor Roosevelt said Americans should not suppress or legis
late against Communists. Rather, we should let them have their
say—at the same time talking louder about Democracy, she said.
Now, it would be pleasant to think of persuading the Commu
nists (or radicals) by superior logic that they are wrong when
:hey say everything is rotten with our way of life. But the
iact is they cannot be reasoned with. We talked with a number
of them this summer—and their minds were made up.
Mostly they follow the party line. They have a pat answer
or an evasive answer for everything you say. If you should
succeed ultimately in backing them into a corner, they reply,
"Yah, anyone who doesn't agree with you is a radical." They
never concede a point; they'll admit no progress at all in the
past 30 years; they declare the one solution to troubles is a
revolution.
Clearly, the only way to reason with Commies at home is
with a club —or iron bars.
But outshouting the Commies abroad. Well, now, we have
something there.
lay Allen, former foreign correspondent, was one of the first
:o declare that the best way to stop Communism abroad like
wildfire was to sell Democracy.
His idea was echoed recently by Bob Considine upon Consi
dine's return from the Olympics. Bob said you had to travel
abroad to appreciate that it is our freedom to learn, our political
opportunities and our industrial resources that make our coun
try great. And we should "export a few more salesmen to sell
our way of life to help balance the number of imported drum
mers who are selling their way of life," he concluded.
