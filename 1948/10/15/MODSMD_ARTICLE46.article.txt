Other Side of Demerit Issue
To the Editor:
As an interested student, I would like to clarify a few of the issues 011
the matter of the penalty system proposed by Women's Council, now under
consideration for women students. 1 should like to congratulate Morton
McDonald for taking sufficient interest in the plan to write a letter to
The Daily, but I feel that his statements evidence the lack of informa
tion about the plan, and I suggest that he drop in on Council during
office ho urs, where he would receive a different impression of the social
regulations.
In answeu to The Daily editorial of Thursday, Oct. 14, several points
were brought out in the LAWS meetings the previous week which were
contrary to the editorial's statements.
(1) Council specifically pointed out that the penalty system will not go
into effect until it is thoroughly understood by all women. Council desires
the cooperation of women in making the system effective. If the majority
oi women oppewe the proposed plan, it will not be imposed on us. May I
emphasize, however, that the more it is discussed, the more favorable to it
is the reaction, once the initial antagonism has teen replaced by an objec
tive attitude.
(2) When the new system does go into effect (Council has NOT esta
blished a permanent system yet) it will be on a trial basis, and subject
to change if necessary. Council recognizes the fact that nothing is perfect,
and that changes will undouhedly be made.
(3) Because it is a penalty system and we students have delegated to
Women's Council the judicial power necesary to uphold social regulations,
we do not have the power to vote on this plan. But because our present
system has shown itself to be ineffective, discussion and statistics gathered
over a two year period have culminated in the proposed plan.
Two aspects of it are entirely different from the present system. In
the first place, it has a positive, rather than a negative, basis. It ac
knowledges the fact that the majority of women respect the social regu
lations, and recognize the necessity oi certain rules governing conduct in
any social situation. This group, which constitutes approximately 95 per
cent of the women students, would, in all probability, not be affected by
the new rules, as Council can show by statistical data relating to the
number of lock-outs, etc.
The demerit system will hit hardest the small minority, 5 per cent or
]ess, who violate regulations frequently, for whatever reason. With this
group, Councils job is to assist, to guide, to educate, or refer individual
cases to some other authority. In the second place, the demerit system
carries with it the right of appeal for any violation. Under the present
system, an offense may be excused with no penalty, but it remains on
the girl s record. Under the demerit system, a violate 11 may be appealed
to the area committee or to Council and if excused, it is off the record.
The plan is not perfect, but the philosophy which underlies it and
the goals toward which it is aimed are a definite step in the direction
of individual responsibility for each of us.
