# Russia Gives Danube River To Satellites
## 
### JIM JOSEPH 
"The door was open for you to
come in; the same door is open for
you to get out—if that is what you
wish."
That was Mr. Vishinsky's wclcome
to the delegates — especially the
Americans—at the recent Danubian
conference.
Maybe we should have taken the
hint; for we were the minority at
the court of the inquisition. But we
stayed. We stayed to be embar
rassed and harassed and voted-down
by a power-bloc of Soviet satellites
who brought to the conference a
tigged and ready-made plan for the
Danube—ready for rubber-stamping.
The rubber-stamping was a mat
ter of perfunctory diplomacy.
Today, Danubian water is in
chattel. Land-locked Czechoslo
vakia, Hungary, and Austria have
voted the: selves into an economic
straight-jrcket. There will be no es
cape to iae sea for them—no free
trade.
American-occupied Germany and
Austria —on the Upper Danube—
will get no supplies—certainly no
Marshall Plan aid by water.
Soviet Domain
The Danube became Soviet do
main—and not even by votes of
every Danubian state. Austria's
participation in the conference was
voted down, 7 to 2; the Soviet Union
said that since the Austrian peace
treaty was still provisional, Austria
had no right to talk about the Dan
ube. Neither was Germany allowed
a voice.
One phrase in the treaty (Article
38) delivers Ihe Danube into Soviet
hands. The phrase says that "ves
sels entering a port for loading and
discharge shall be entitled to use of
port factilities, etc.—'on the basis
of agreements concluded with the
appropriate transportation and expe
ditionary agencies'."
No Freedom of Entry
So freedom of entry and use is
dependent not upon an equitable
commisison, but upon direct nego
tiations between one steamship line
wishing to use the ports of the
Danube, and Danubian lines which
control those ports.
Foreign shippers will have to ne
gotiate for a berth at Budapest with
the Meszhart Shipping Company of
Hungary. The Meszhart company
has just signed a 30 years' lease giv
ing it control of about 95 per cent
of Budapest's harbor facilities.
Fifty per cent of the company is
owned by the Soviet Union; its
general manager is a Soviet citizen.
What kind of treatment can for
eign shippers expect at Meszhart's
hands? The answer is obvious.
Wasn't the Danube designated an
international river—open to trade
and non-discriminatory?
Soviet Advantage
But a Soviet-Rumanian agreement
grants a one-third tariff reduction
to Soviet-Rumanian ships passing
through the Sulina Channel.
The irony is that most of these
Soviet ships which will benefit by
tariff reductions are American-made
—some of the millions of tons we
gratuitously lease-lent the Russians.
The Soviets forgot to return our
ships—and the memory lapse has
become chronic.
Luckiest number at the Danube
conference was seven. Seven satel
lites voted seven "yeas"—down the
line— acccpting the Soviet proposal.
Seven satellites voted seven "nays"
—down the line—against the U.S.-
British-French amendments 21 in
number.
Soviet Handiwork
It was the first time that a con
ference had found a document "per
fect'—but such, declared the Sov
iets. was their handiwork the Dan
ube proposals.
Western Power diplomatic ice
breakers, trying to gouge Soviet
power from along the monopolized
banks of the Danube, didn't clear
enough passage for a democratic
rowboat to push through.
It'll take more than spring thaws
to melt the Soviet's freeze on the
Danube.
