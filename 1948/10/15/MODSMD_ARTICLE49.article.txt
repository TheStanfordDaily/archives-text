## Bull Session 
### 
Tee-hee Department:
Included in the mail received this week at The Daily Shack was a
release from the Young Democratic Clubs of America. The letter, which
was printed on fancy stationery bearing the names of the six national
club officers, contained a denouncement of the Gallup Poll for predicting

a Republican victory in November.
Five of the six officers listed on the letter had
names which would seem to be perfectly proper for
the club, but, oh, the name of that club treasurer!
This Young Democrat was named, if you please,
E. HOOVER TAFT JR.! S'help me.

II reading Bull Session is one of your regular bad
habits, you have undoubtedly noticed by now that
these essays are written not in the editorial "we"'
style, but rather in the first person singular. There
is a reason for this.

I m told that most things in life exist for a purpose. If this is true,
the only possible purpose of a column such as "Bull Session" is to be
light, breezy, and (sometimes) even amusing. If this is the case, I can
see no reason for using the formal "we" style, and so I shan't.
And besides, "we" is so much harder to spell than "I."
* * *
Picture of a beautiful woman; (or "I've been framed!")
One of Tong brothers has been bothered for the past few weeks
by a friend of his who is looking for a good blind date.
"How about fixing me up with a blind date?" sez the friend, a week
after fall quarter opens.
"Okay," answers my fraternity brother.
One week passes. "Say, about that date," reminds the friend, "make
sure she's one of the bigger girls on campus."
Don l worry, says the brother, "the girl I'm working on for you carries
as much weight around here as anyone else in the school."
And she does! 220 pounds would be a conservative estimate.
Exit one friendship.
* * *
It pains me to admit that in the matter of extracting laughs, I'm afraid
my column of yesterday ran a poor second 10 a Daily advertisement on
page 2. The ad to which I m referring was one stating that a certain
"former Stanford scholar" is now selling used cars at a Menlo Park auto lot.
Former Stanford scholar. Well, that's one way of putting it!
* * *
It used to be that you could only win contests if you were smart. But
that was before the revolooshun.
Now you can win free wearing apparel from one of the Palo Alto mer
chants by simply turning in the lowest test grade of the week.
Oi course the smart thing to do would be to flunk six or seven tests
in a row and win yourself a new wardrobe. And you wouldn't have to
worry about keeping your new clothes clean because after you flunked
that many tests, the University will probably be very happy to give you
the brush!

Picture of a beautiful woman; (or "I've been framed!")
One of Tong brothers has been bothered for the past few weeks
by a friend of his who is looking for a good blind date.
"How about fixing me up with a blind date?" sez the friend, a week
after fall quarter opens.
"Okay," answers my fraternity brother.
One week passes. "Say, about that date," reminds the friend, "make
sure she's one of the bigger girls on campus."
Don l worry, says the brother, "the girl I'm working on for you carries
as much weight around here as anyone else in the school."
And she does! 220 pounds would be a conservative estimate.
Exit one friendship.

It pains me to admit that in the matter of extracting laughs, I'm afraid
my column of yesterday ran a poor second 10 a Daily advertisement on
page 2. The ad to which I m referring was one stating that a certain
"former Stanford scholar" is now selling used cars at a Menlo Park auto lot.
Former Stanford scholar. Well, that's one way of putting it!

It used to be that you could only win contests if you were smart. But
that was before the revolooshun.
Now you can win free wearing apparel from one of the Palo Alto mer
chants by simply turning in the lowest test grade of the week.
Oi course the smart thing to do would be to flunk six or seven tests
in a row and win yourself a new wardrobe. And you wouldn't have to
worry about keeping your new clothes clean because after you flunked
that many tests, the University will probably be very happy to give you
the brush!

Tee-hee Department:
Included in the mail received this week at The Daily Shack was a
release from the Young Democratic Clubs of America. The letter, which
was printed on fancy stationery bearing the names of the six national
club officers, contained a denouncement of the Gallup Poll for predicting

a Republican victory in November.
Five of the six officers listed on the letter had
names which would seem to be perfectly proper for
the club, but, oh, the name of that club treasurer!
This Young Democrat was named, if you please,
E. HOOVER TAFT JR.! S'help me.

II reading Bull Session is one of your regular bad
habits, you have undoubtedly noticed by now that
these essays are written not in the editorial "we"'
style, but rather in the first person singular. There
is a reason for this.

I m told that most things in life exist for a purpose. If this is true,
the only possible purpose of a column such as "Bull Session" is to be
light, breezy, and (sometimes) even amusing. If this is the case, I can
see no reason for using the formal "we" style, and so I shan't.
And besides, "we" is so much harder to spell than "I."
