## Other Campuses STUDENT BEGINS SEARCH FOR BROTHER'S KILLERS 
### 
To aid in the search for the per
son or persons who killed his
brother, William Polk has applied
for a leave of absence from his
studies at Harvard. The body of
George Polk, CBS correspondent,
was found floating in the Gulf of
Salonika May 16. His arms and legs
were tied and he had been shot in
the back of the head.
Supporting the young brother in
his appeal for funds to fly to Greece
with two companions are the News
men's Commission to Investigate
the Murder of George Polk, the
Niernan Foundation, and the Har
vard American Veterans' Commit
tee. The Liberal Union has also
contributed to the fund.
The 19-year-old sophomore has
already collected one-fourth of the
$6,000 he estimates wil! be neces
sary to conduct his investigation.
Accompanying the Harvard stu
dent will be two veteran corre
spondents, John Donovan, of NBC.
and Constantino Poulos of the
Overseas News Agency.
Louis M. Lyons, curator of the
Nieman Foundation, has sent let
ters to all members of the founda
tion, both past and present, re
questing further contributions. The
foundation awards outstanding
'ournalists a year's fellowship at
Harvard.
