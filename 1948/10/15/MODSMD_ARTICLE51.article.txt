# COLLEGE MARRIAGES OK— IF REQUIREMENTS MET
## 
### 
If you arc planning to marry
whi'e still attending college, you
have the approval of Dr. Eugene
Link, professor of sociology and
marriage counselor at the Univer
sity of Denver.
You have his blessing—if you can
meet the following requirements:
Husband and wife should continue
with their respective educations
and they should not be under any
economic stress.
According to Dr. Link, differ
ences in education lead to marital
maladjustment.
Link stated that he is in agree
ment with the Truman plan for
subsidized education. He added
that if this plan is not put into ef
fect, parents who can afford it

should bear the costs.
As to increasing (he size of the
collegiate family, Dr. Link says
that children should not be post
poned until completion of the par
ents' educations.
Backing up this theory, he claims
that couples who wait too long be
fore raising a family have difficulty
in adjusting to their children.
