# Letter To Editor Not Authentic
## 
### 
"It was a couple of guys named
Joe." said James C. Wilson. Lyle
Snow, Lew Scott, and Lee Hansen,
whose names were signed to a let
ter to the editor which appeared in

yestcrday'st Daily. They didn't write
the letter which suggested The
Daily print some of "Wallace's won
derful comments on the world .situ
ation." They dare the actual writers
to make themselves known.
The Daily usually checks up by
telephone when letters to the editor
appear to be "planted." We regret
slipping up on this one, but since
it came in on an official "Stanford
Students for Wallace" postcard, it
appeared one of the first of a threat
ened deluge of postcards from the
Wallace gang.â€”Ed.
