## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
At first glance the Beta's 20 to 7
triumph over the Dekes in intra
mural touchball Wednesday after
noon would appear to be the result
of well-played football—and that
alone. Dazzling plays and infallible
teamwork, though, were only half
the story. Something deeper was
involved.

house at 557 Lasuen was shaken to
its foundations by the thunderous
