# Phi Sigs Top Fizzers 7-0
## 
### 
Phi Sigma Kappa stayed in the
ranks of the undefeated yesterday
afternoon by downing the Sigma
Chi Fizzers 7 to 0. A 30-yard pass
from Bob Cook to Ray Pascie early
in the first quarter counted the only
touchdown of the game, and the
same scoring combination clicked
again for the extra point.
The Sigma Chi lads muffed a
golden scoring opportunity in the
last minute of play when a pass
from Bob Mann trickled out of the
arms of Dave Taylor in the end
zone. The line work of Bull Ull
man featured the play of the vic
tors: while Denny Tuffmelli and
Bud Richter stood out for the los
ers.
