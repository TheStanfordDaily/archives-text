# Bruin Passing Is Dangerous
## 
### BY CRAYTON JONES 
The twice-defeated UCLA Bruins
received encouraging news when it
was learned that three regulars will
be back in the starting lineup when
the Bruins take the field against
the Indians tomorrow.
Guards Mike Dimitro and John
Nikoevich and right half Gene
"Skip" Rowland, who were injured
in the Northwestern game, have
completely recovered and are listed
as definite starters.
Fullback Lost
The return of these three was
somewhat offset by the loss of Art
Steffen, first - string fullback, who
suffered a broken rib in the Wash
ington game last Saturday.
In order to bolster the fullback
position. Coach Bert Laßrucherie
has moved 198-pound Cliff Shroe
der from quarterback to fullback.
Hal Braly, who was first - string
fullback on the Bruin frosh team
last year, will start at this position
tomorrow.
The Bruins' record thus far this
season is hardly impressive. They
opened with a smashing 48 to 26
victory over Washington State, but
the following week looked pathetic
as they were only able to gain 33
yards on the ground while losing
to Northwestern 19 to 0.
UCLA made a feeble comback
against Idaho as they dropped the
Vandals 28 to 12, but last Saturday
an inspired Washington team
smothered them 27 to 6.
Strong Passing Attack
The Uclans' passing attack has

been quite successful in the four
games they have played. With Ray
Nagel and Cliff Shroeder doing the
passing from the quarterback slot,
the Bruins have completed 34 out
of 77 aerials attempted. In four
games UCLA has netted 1,177 yards
from rushing and passing, and al
most half of this total was gained
via forward passes.
The Bruins will have a weight
advantage over the Indians not only
in the line but in the backfield as
well—the overall edge being about
six pounds per man.
