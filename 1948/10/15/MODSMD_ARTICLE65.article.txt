## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
low good are the Stanford frosh
dders? Leaving their high school
->ss clippings behind, Coach
uck Taylor's Cardbabes entrain
lay for the sunny Southland
ere they will answer the big
estion tomorrow in their meeting
h the UCLA freshmen in the
liseum.
n) far this season the frosh have
1 little chance to demonstrate
ir ability, or lack of it. In their
t and only game to date, a 38-7
Hoping of Mt. San Antonio JC,
yearlings found themselves
ying a team that, for all practi
purposes, wasn't on the field.
Flush Blow Hot and Cold
'very one of Taylor's charges
!<ed like an All-Time All-Amer
i against the befuddled Moun
leers, who couldn't have made
dage against a good stout bench,
vever, last Friday saw Paul
latal's JV's take on the frosh in
atne scrimmage and play them
i standstill. So who knows?
acking the mail for the locals
be a backfield composed of
y Kerkorian at quarter, Harry
•asian and Eric Southwood at
-'es, and Marv Mellaway or
ick Brazel at full. Dick Horn,
a Crawford, and Dean Shepard
c up the quarter and half spots
lectively.
Good Reserves
ith Brazel booming down the
die, Hugasian and Southwood
ng off around the ends, and
korian pitching, the unit has
itiful balance. It loses little,
cover, with the substitution of
one of a number of flashy
:s that Taylor can count on.
le line takes no back seat to
backfield either. Doug Thamer
tors a forward wall that in
es Owen Powell and Captain
Cone at guards, Lee Daley and
:'k Hokanson at tackles, and
McColl and Bill Storum at the
spots. Bight up with them are
cs Bernie Tovarz and Joe Ja
, centsr Dave Worley, tackles
n Rhul and A 1 Raisch, and
Wilbur Taylor and John Rye.
actically every one of the boys
tioned was a prep star —a num
af them would be listed in any
's Who of American prep foot
luminaries. But in the words
at learned Mongolian sage, Ray
inley, "they come a long way
St. Louis but they still got a
way to go."
Last Year's Game a Tie
st year Taylor, in his first year
osh coach, was on his way to
ndefeated season when the wee
s of UCLA almost ate his por
'. With Larry Lampkin, Breek
;cheim, and a host of others to
h Stanford's Tom Shaw, Boyd
on. Gordy White and Co., the
iabes fought the locals to a
standoff.
ylor is counting on his boys
•ttle something in tomorrow's
1 that has long been an ache
s breast, so to speak—they will
;y can.
