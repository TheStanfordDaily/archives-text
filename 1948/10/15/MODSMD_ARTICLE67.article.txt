# Daily Pickers Tab Stanford
## 
### 
Never content to let well enough
alone, the Daily experts once again
polish up their crystal ball and at
tempt the most difficult of all tasks—
predicting the unpredictable.
Last week the Peerless Pickers
raised their season's batting average
34 points by correctly calling 14
out ol' 20 starts. Not too bad in a
week in which upsets were the rule
rather than the exception.
STANFORD vs. UCLA
The "experts" continue to stay
with Stanford and, needless to say,
continue to lose. Taking one last
gasp before bailing out, the scribes
call Stanford by 1 point.
CALIFORNIA vs. OKEIJON STATE
The Staters might cross Pappy's
"T." Cal by 18 points.
WASHINGTON vs. VVSC
The Huskies looked mighty good
polishing off Brother Bruin iast
Saturday. Yet this is one of those
traditionals in which anything might
happen. Washington by (i paints.
OREGON vs. CSC
The Ducks have looked anything
but like Rose Bowl material so far
this season. Ditto for the Trojans.
It'll be clo.-:e. Oregon by 15 points.
MICHIGAN vs. NORTHWESTERN
The game of the week, and maybe
the season. One mighty thin vote
for the Wolverines. Michigan by 1.
Oklahoma A&M over USF by 111.
Minnesota over Illinois by 12.
