An injury - riddled Farm soccer
squad tackles the Cal Aggies at
Davis tomorrow. The Cards though
relying on their reserves are de
cided favorites over the Aggies who
have yet to win a game.
The wave of injuries that hit
the squad at the beginning of the
season has hit again, putting three
halfbacks and a wing out of action.
Right half Homi Irani, hurt in last
week's contest with USF, is still out
of action. His reserves, John Mar
ble and Yusuf Dadabhay, are also
hobbling and Coach John Segel will
have to rely on Jerry Simpson to
carry the load. Wing K. S. Quan
is a doubtful starter and his place
will be taken by workhorse Jerry
Taylor.
Team Plagued by Injuries

in practice by these injuries. Prep

limited to timing drills and chalk
talks. Segel has curtailed scrim
mage, hoping to prevent further in
juries. The team will rest today
with only short skull practice ses
sion scheduled.

feature Ara Galstaun and Jerry
Taylor. Galstaun, who is the team's
most valuable man according to op
posing coaches, is the playmaker

hustler who never fails to give op

Other starters on the weakened
squad are Tony Ortega at wing, and
Amo Salvador at centers forward.

divide the duty at right inside in
place of Beezy Jones who dropped
