## Golf Team Seeks Varsity Material 
### 
In an effort to find new team
members to replace graduating
linksmen, the Stanford golf team
announced yesterday that a tour
nament will be held throughout the
remainder of the quarter, beginning
Monday.
According to Ernie Kellberg, let-
terman on last year's top-ranking
squad, the purpose of the tourney
will be to "find new material for
the coming season and to give tour
nament material to both old and
new golfers."
The tournament is open to all
students eligible for either the
lreshman or varsity golf team.
Qualifying rounds will be held all
next week, with scores to be posted
before Oct. 23. Entry fee will be
$1, which permits each player at
least three rounds.
There will be a championship
flight of 15 players, as well as other
flights. Prizes will be awarded to
every player, with golf balls going
to each first-round loser.
Kellberg added that first - round
matches will be played between
Oct. 24 and 30, second-round con
tests between Oct. 31 and Nov. 6,
semi-finals between Nov. 7 and 13,
and finals between Nov. 14 and 20.
With Tom Lambie, Jack Shuler,
and Bob Crozier gone from the
Farm team, newcomers have a good
chance to make the varsity squad.
