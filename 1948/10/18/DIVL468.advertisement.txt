THE SPACE
Department of Hurrays
After a long, hard winter
A bear came out to play
Against that battered Indian Joe
From up at Stanford Way.
This bear waved high a silken scarf
And cried to aii on hand:
"Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, a ready teddy
Comes home to circus land."
But, willy-nilly, ready teddy
Met Indian Joe that day;
And after the din of battle
We heard that teddy say:
"I should have stayed in my hol
low log
Where I knew what I was doin'
'Cause since I met that Indian Joe
I'm only a ruined bruin."
AL FAST
A time for celebration
And, Where?
