# Gridiron Famine Finally Ends

ered the Stanford-UCLA fracas from the press
box of the Memorial Coliseum in Los Ange
les.—Ed.)
That old Stanford Spirit blasted UCLA right
out of the Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday, as
a new, inspired Indian football team whipped
itseif into a wild frenzy to roar past the sur
prised Bruins, 34 to 14.
The victory ended a two-year Farm football
famine and marked the first time since 1941 that
Stanford has beaten UCLA.
A crowd of 40,000 paying customers watched
the rejuvenated Injuns catch fire, as Marchie
Schwartz's men came back from a 7 to 7 half
time deadlock to completely destroy and hu
miliate the thunderstruck Bruins.
Marchie Clears the Bench
Every Stanford player, except the injured
Bud Klein, had a hand in hoisting the Farm's
reputation back to its normal level. There were
several standouts, but on the whole, it was a
team victory.
Aubrey Devine, in his first starting role, was
superb. His choice of plays and all-around field
generalship proved to be the turning point of
the game. Don Campbell took his place on
defense and turned in his usual tight defensive
game.
Bob White and Emery Mitchell ripped the

Bruin line to shreds, as White averaged 12 '
yards per carry and scored three big touch- i
downs. Mitchell racked up 73 yards from j
scrimmage and scored once. But all the ball
carriers were effective. Turriziani, Field, An
derson, and Nafziger had little trouble in pick
ing up yardage. And not one yard was lost ;
from scrimmage.
The line play was just as good. Captain Bob
Roeher turned in his greatest effort. His key
blocks paved the way to at least two scores. ■
Gordon White at tackle was good. So were the
ends, A 1 Laakso and Gene Martin.
Phleqer, Titus Tough
Pinky Phleger and Mickey Titus, always
tough in the Coliseum, were very effective
against the Bruins. And of course, A 1 Rau was
in the thick of things. It is impossible to name
only a few in this story of Stanford victory. All
the men were responsible for the win.
When the Red-shirted visitors first ran out
into the Los Angeles sunshine and onto the
well-worn Coliseum turf, they were 12 -point
underdogs, and not much was expected from
this northern school that hadn't won a confer
ence clash in two years.

But the miracle began to unfold when half
back Bob White rambled 11 yards into paydirt

to give Stanford a 7 to 0 lead late
in the first quarter. Bob Rohrer set
up the scoxe by recovering Howard
Hansen's fumble on the Bruin 27.
UCLA came back to tie the score,
and the Card touchdown parade
was halted for the remainder of the
first half. But in the final 30 min
utes, Stanford was unstoppable.
Mitchell Bursts Through
As the third quarter opened,
Stanford started a drive that was
the prettiest bit of pigskin progress
that has been accomplished during
the entire season. Starting from his
own 11, Mitchell burst through the
middle for 39 yards to reach mid
field.
A 1 Turriziani, running like a rab
bit, picked up 12 more. Bob White
grabbed five, Mitchell made it a
first down, and Turriziani rammed
his way for 15 more to hte Bruin
4. Mitchell carried the ball over
from there in two tries, the drive
going 89 yards in eight plays. Stan
ford led, 13 to 7.
20 to 7
Gene Martin, a pass - catching
fool, threw the kibosh on any Bruin
hopes that might have still been
alive by making a miraculous catch
on the Bruin 10 that Mitchell had
fired from midfield. Bob White
scored after one wasted play, and
Mitchell booted the 20th point while
Don Campbell held the ball. 20 to 7.
Two minutes later the war
whooping Indians had another
score. A Bruin attempt at a for
ward pass went haywire, and Pinky
Phleger pounced on the loose ball
on the Uclan 3. Fullback Martin
Anderson then dove through the
air and two Bruin tacklers for the
fourth Stanford score. Mitchell
didn't miss, and it was 27 to 7.
White Goes 41 Yards
After the Westwooders had
scored once more, Bob White put
the finishing touches to the after
noon by booming 41 yards around
his own left end to score. Two
crashing blocks cleared the way.
and when Mitchell had added his
mechanical one, the scoreboard read
34 to 14.

downs. Mitchell racked up 73 yards from j
scrimmage and scored once. But all the ball
carriers were effective. Turriziani, Field, An
derson, and Nafziger had little trouble in pick
ing up yardage. And not one yard was lost ;
from scrimmage.
The line play was just as good. Captain Bob
Roeher turned in his greatest effort. His key
blocks paved the way to at least two scores. ■
Gordon White at tackle was good. So were the
ends, A 1 Laakso and Gene Martin.
Phleqer, Titus Tough
Pinky Phleger and Mickey Titus, always
tough in the Coliseum, were very effective
against the Bruins. And of course, A 1 Rau was
in the thick of things. It is impossible to name
only a few in this story of Stanford victory. All
the men were responsible for the win.
When the Red-shirted visitors first ran out
into the Los Angeles sunshine and onto the
well-worn Coliseum turf, they were 12 -point
underdogs, and not much was expected from
this northern school that hadn't won a confer
ence clash in two years.

to give Stanford a 7 to 0 lead late
in the first quarter. Bob Rohrer set
up the scoxe by recovering Howard
Hansen's fumble on the Bruin 27.
UCLA came back to tie the score,
and the Card touchdown parade
was halted for the remainder of the
first half. But in the final 30 min
utes, Stanford was unstoppable.
Mitchell Bursts Through
As the third quarter opened,
Stanford started a drive that was
the prettiest bit of pigskin progress
that has been accomplished during
the entire season. Starting from his
own 11, Mitchell burst through the
middle for 39 yards to reach mid
field.
A 1 Turriziani, running like a rab
bit, picked up 12 more. Bob White
grabbed five, Mitchell made it a
first down, and Turriziani rammed
his way for 15 more to hte Bruin
4. Mitchell carried the ball over
from there in two tries, the drive
going 89 yards in eight plays. Stan
ford led, 13 to 7.
20 to 7
Gene Martin, a pass - catching
fool, threw the kibosh on any Bruin
hopes that might have still been
alive by making a miraculous catch
on the Bruin 10 that Mitchell had
fired from midfield. Bob White
scored after one wasted play, and
Mitchell booted the 20th point while
Don Campbell held the ball. 20 to 7.
Two minutes later the war
whooping Indians had another
score. A Bruin attempt at a for
ward pass went haywire, and Pinky
Phleger pounced on the loose ball
on the Uclan 3. Fullback Martin
Anderson then dove through the
air and two Bruin tacklers for the
fourth Stanford score. Mitchell
didn't miss, and it was 27 to 7.
White Goes 41 Yards
After the Westwooders had
scored once more, Bob White put
the finishing touches to the after
noon by booming 41 yards around
his own left end to score. Two
crashing blocks cleared the way.
and when Mitchell had added his
mechanical one, the scoreboard read
34 to 14.

That old Stanford Spirit blasted UCLA right
out of the Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday, as
a new, inspired Indian football team whipped
itseif into a wild frenzy to roar past the sur

The victory ended a two-year Farm football
famine and marked the first time since 1941 that
Stanford has beaten UCLA.

the rejuvenated Injuns catch fire, as Marchie
Schwartz's men came back from a 7 to 7 half

Marchie Clears the Bench
Every Stanford player, except the injured
Bud Klein, had a hand in hoisting the Farm's
reputation back to its normal level. There were
several standouts, but on the whole, it was a
team victory.
Aubrey Devine, in his first starting role, was
superb. His choice of plays and all-around field
generalship proved to be the turning point of
the game. Don Campbell took his place on
defense and turned in his usual tight defensive
game.

to give Stanford a 7 to 0 lead late
in the first quarter. Bob Rohrer set
up the scoxe by recovering Howard
Hansen's fumble on the Bruin 27.
UCLA came back to tie the score,
and the Card touchdown parade
was halted for the remainder of the
first half. But in the final 30 min
utes, Stanford was unstoppable.
Mitchell Bursts Through
As the third quarter opened,
Stanford started a drive that was
the prettiest bit of pigskin progress
that has been accomplished during
the entire season. Starting from his
own 11, Mitchell burst through the
middle for 39 yards to reach mid
field.
A 1 Turriziani, running like a rab
bit, picked up 12 more. Bob White
grabbed five, Mitchell made it a
first down, and Turriziani rammed
his way for 15 more to hte Bruin
4. Mitchell carried the ball over
from there in two tries, the drive
going 89 yards in eight plays. Stan
ford led, 13 to 7.
20 to 7
Gene Martin, a pass - catching
fool, threw the kibosh on any Bruin
hopes that might have still been
alive by making a miraculous catch
on the Bruin 10 that Mitchell had
fired from midfield. Bob White
scored after one wasted play, and
Mitchell booted the 20th point while
Don Campbell held the ball. 20 to 7.
Two minutes later the war
whooping Indians had another
score. A Bruin attempt at a for
ward pass went haywire, and Pinky
Phleger pounced on the loose ball
on the Uclan 3. Fullback Martin
Anderson then dove through the
air and two Bruin tacklers for the
fourth Stanford score. Mitchell
didn't miss, and it was 27 to 7.
White Goes 41 Yards
After the Westwooders had
scored once more, Bob White put
the finishing touches to the after
noon by booming 41 yards around
his own left end to score. Two
crashing blocks cleared the way.
and when Mitchell had added his
mechanical one, the scoreboard read
34 to 14.

ered the Stanford-UCLA fracas from the press
box of the Memorial Coliseum in Los Ange

That old Stanford Spirit blasted UCLA right
out of the Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday, as
a new, inspired Indian football team whipped
itseif into a wild frenzy to roar past the sur
prised Bruins, 34 to 14.
The victory ended a two-year Farm football
famine and marked the first time since 1941 that
Stanford has beaten UCLA.
A crowd of 40,000 paying customers watched
the rejuvenated Injuns catch fire, as Marchie
Schwartz's men came back from a 7 to 7 half
time deadlock to completely destroy and hu
miliate the thunderstruck Bruins.
Marchie Clears the Bench
Every Stanford player, except the injured
Bud Klein, had a hand in hoisting the Farm's
reputation back to its normal level. There were
several standouts, but on the whole, it was a
team victory.
Aubrey Devine, in his first starting role, was
superb. His choice of plays and all-around field
generalship proved to be the turning point of
the game. Don Campbell took his place on
defense and turned in his usual tight defensive
game.
Bob White and Emery Mitchell ripped the

Bruin line to shreds, as White averaged 12 '
yards per carry and scored three big touch- i
downs. Mitchell racked up 73 yards from j
scrimmage and scored once. But all the ball
carriers were effective. Turriziani, Field, An
derson, and Nafziger had little trouble in pick
ing up yardage. And not one yard was lost ;
from scrimmage.
The line play was just as good. Captain Bob
Roeher turned in his greatest effort. His key
blocks paved the way to at least two scores. ■
Gordon White at tackle was good. So were the
ends, A 1 Laakso and Gene Martin.
Phleqer, Titus Tough
Pinky Phleger and Mickey Titus, always
tough in the Coliseum, were very effective
against the Bruins. And of course, A 1 Rau was
in the thick of things. It is impossible to name
only a few in this story of Stanford victory. All
the men were responsible for the win.
When the Red-shirted visitors first ran out
into the Los Angeles sunshine and onto the
well-worn Coliseum turf, they were 12 -point
underdogs, and not much was expected from
this northern school that hadn't won a confer
ence clash in two years.
