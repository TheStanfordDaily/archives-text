# Gridiron Famine Finally Ends

### JOHN HALL 
(John Hall, Daily sports staff writer, cov
ered the Stanford-UCLA fracas from the press
box of the Memorial Coliseum in Los Ange
les.—Ed.)
That old Stanford Spirit blasted UCLA right
out of the Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday, as
a new, inspired Indian football team whipped
itseif into a wild frenzy to roar past the sur
prised Bruins, 34 to 14.
The victory ended a two-year Farm football
famine and marked the first time since 1941 that
Stanford has beaten UCLA.
A crowd of 40,000 paying customers watched
the rejuvenated Injuns catch fire, as Marchie
Schwartz's men came back from a 7 to 7 half
time deadlock to completely destroy and hu
miliate the thunderstruck Bruins.
Marchie Clears the Bench
Every Stanford player, except the injured
Bud Klein, had a hand in hoisting the Farm's
reputation back to its normal level. There were
several standouts, but on the whole, it was a
team victory.
Aubrey Devine, in his first starting role, was
superb. His choice of plays and all-around field
generalship proved to be the turning point of
the game. Don Campbell took his place on
defense and turned in his usual tight defensive
game.
Bob White and Emery Mitchell ripped the

Bruin line to shreds, as White averaged 12 '
yards per carry and scored three big touch- i
downs. Mitchell racked up 73 yards from j
scrimmage and scored once. But all the ball
carriers were effective. Turriziani, Field, An
derson, and Nafziger had little trouble in pick
ing up yardage. And not one yard was lost ;
from scrimmage.
The line play was just as good. Captain Bob
Roeher turned in his greatest effort. His key
blocks paved the way to at least two scores. ■
Gordon White at tackle was good. So were the
ends, A 1 Laakso and Gene Martin.
Phleqer, Titus Tough
Pinky Phleger and Mickey Titus, always
tough in the Coliseum, were very effective
against the Bruins. And of course, A 1 Rau was
in the thick of things. It is impossible to name
only a few in this story of Stanford victory. All
the men were responsible for the win.
When the Red-shirted visitors first ran out
into the Los Angeles sunshine and onto the
well-worn Coliseum turf, they were 12 -point
underdogs, and not much was expected from
this northern school that hadn't won a confer
ence clash in two years.
Rohrer Sets Up Score
But the miracle began to unfold when half
back Bob White rambled 11 yards into paydirt
