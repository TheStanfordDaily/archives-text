# Card Spirit High As Uclans 'C' Red
## 
### 
The sight of blue and gold around
the Uclan campus last weekend
aroused premature Big Game spir
its in the Stanfordites who jour
neyed to Los Angeles to witness
the Cards steamroll over the Bruins.
A squad of 35 Indians, taking
with them six squaws, five gallons
of red war paint, and plenty of
rope and gags, adorned the UCLA
"C" a bright cardinal early Friday
morning after overcoming the stiff
resistance of one sleeping freshman
guard.
The blushing "C" sparkled in the
morning sun later in the day as
students of both schools gathered
on the UCLA quad for a homecom
ing rally.
The next day, the appearance of
the giant Stanford banner unfurl
ing across the Bruin rooting sec
tion at half time caused startled
Stanfordites to gaze at the blank
space which had mysteriously ap
peared between the light standards
behind the Card section.
Four Stanford students retaliated
during the fourth quarter as un
suspecting UCLA students watched
the game below, and a few minutes
later the Uclan banner was in the
Stanford stands. Through a near
riot, quelled only by the presence
of police, the banner found its way
to the Indian dressing room, where
it was last seen.
Student body officers here are
planning a peace offering which
will involve the exchange of school
emblems. The UCLA banner is
now under lock and key on the
Stanford campus, according to re
liable reports.
