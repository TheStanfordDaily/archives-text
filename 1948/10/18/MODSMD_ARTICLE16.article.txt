The time—summer of 1946; the scene—Prague, Czechoslo
vakia; the occasion—the annual meeting of the World Student
Congress. Twenty-five students from America are visiting the
Congress in hopes of seeing how such an organization runs
and what it accomplishes.
What is the significance of this meeting? It was here that

these students got the idea and made
plans for what eventually developed
into the United States National Stu
dent Association.
Americans Unorganized
These volunteers from America
found themselves up against a blank
wall when talking with the students
from other countries. Representing
democratic national, organizations
the other students knew what their
leliow students wanted, knew how
they felt on matters placed before
the Congress, and knew how to talk
with other representatives on equsl
terms. The Americans were on their
own. They could not say "we" in the
discussions, but merely "I."
They realize that American stu
dents were unorganized and were
incapable of being democratically
represented to students of the world
in matters of student government,
policies, international cooperation,
and the like. Upon returning to
the United States, they decided to
create an organization in America
similar to the the democratic na
tional unions of students represented
at the World Student Congress.
Constitution Drafted
The first conference was held in
December of 1946. Seven hundred
college men and women, represent
ing over 800,000 students, met in
Chicago and drew up plans for a
United States National Student As
sociation (USNSA). Working day
and night, at times for 40 hours at
a stretch, the students framed a
constitution and set the wheels of
the organization rolling.
The work of the initial conference
ence completed, the plan was sub
mitted to the colleges and universi
ties. The membership was open only
to student bodies of colleges in the
United States and its possessions,
not to any independent group which
might eventually come to dominate
the association. Stanford and more
Ihan 240 other colleges joined—a
representation of nearly one mil
lion students.
Representative System
The organization of the associa
tion was simplified as much as pos
sible and yet allowed all colleges to
have full representation. For ex
ample, let us see how the repre
sentative system affects the students
at Stanford
Three times a year, Stanford can
send six delegates and six alternates
to the Regional Assembly. Stanford
is a member of the Hawaii, Cali
fornia, and Nevada area, one of the
25 regions. These students work
with the other regional representa
tives to formulate a dynamic pro
gram which can be applied through
member schools. They also elect two
of their number to represent them
at the National Executive Commit
tee.
But that is not the only connec

tion Stanford has with the NSA.
Once a y#ar, the ASSU can send 12
representatives to the National Con
gress at which the policy, the com
plete program for the coming year,
and elections to national offices, are
voted on. Thus, representatives of
Stanford can take an active part in
both the regional and national di
visions of the USA.
The United States National Stu
dent Association has come a long
way since it initial meeting in 1946.
In future issues of The Daily, the
achievements of this organization
will be discussed, as well as its
future plans.

college men and women, represent
ing over 800,000 students, met in
Chicago and drew up plans for a
United States National Student As
sociation (USNSA). Working day
and night, at times for 40 hours at
a stretch, the students framed a
constitution and set the wheels of
the organization rolling.
The work of the initial conference
ence completed, the plan was sub
mitted to the colleges and universi
ties. The membership was open only
to student bodies of colleges in the
United States and its possessions,
not to any independent group which
might eventually come to dominate
the association. Stanford and more
Ihan 240 other colleges joined—a
representation of nearly one mil
lion students.
Representative System
The organization of the associa
tion was simplified as much as pos
sible and yet allowed all colleges to
have full representation. For ex
ample, let us see how the repre
sentative system affects the students
at Stanford
Three times a year, Stanford can
send six delegates and six alternates
to the Regional Assembly. Stanford
is a member of the Hawaii, Cali
fornia, and Nevada area, one of the
25 regions. These students work
with the other regional representa
tives to formulate a dynamic pro
gram which can be applied through
member schools. They also elect two
of their number to represent them
at the National Executive Commit
tee.
But that is not the only connec

tion Stanford has with the NSA.
Once a y#ar, the ASSU can send 12
representatives to the National Con
gress at which the policy, the com
plete program for the coming year,
and elections to national offices, are
voted on. Thus, representatives of
Stanford can take an active part in
both the regional and national di
visions of the USA.
The United States National Stu
dent Association has come a long
way since it initial meeting in 1946.
In future issues of The Daily, the
achievements of this organization
will be discussed, as well as its
future plans.
The time—summer of 1946; the scene—Prague, Czechoslo
vakia; the occasion—the annual meeting of the World Student
Congress. Twenty-five students from America are visiting the
Congress in hopes of seeing how such an organization runs
and what it accomplishes.
What is the significance of this meeting? It was here that

these students got the idea and made
plans for what eventually developed
into the United States National Stu
dent Association.
Americans Unorganized
These volunteers from America
found themselves up against a blank
wall when talking with the students
from other countries. Representing
democratic national, organizations
the other students knew what their
leliow students wanted, knew how
they felt on matters placed before
the Congress, and knew how to talk
with other representatives on equsl
terms. The Americans were on their
own. They could not say "we" in the
discussions, but merely "I."
They realize that American stu
dents were unorganized and were
incapable of being democratically
represented to students of the world
in matters of student government,
policies, international cooperation,
and the like. Upon returning to
the United States, they decided to
create an organization in America
similar to the the democratic na
tional unions of students represented
at the World Student Congress.
Constitution Drafted
The first conference was held in
December of 1946. Seven hundred
college men and women, represent
