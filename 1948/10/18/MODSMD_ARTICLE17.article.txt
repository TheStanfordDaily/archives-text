# Sketch of NSA Heard by Excom
## 
### JIM THURBER 
A brief sketch of the functions of
the National Student Association
was presented to Excom last Wed
nesday evening by Erskine Chil
ders, chairman of NSA's California-
Nevada-Hawaii district. The Daily
feels that his explanation of the
NSA is worth repeating:
"The people and government of
the United States are faced today
with a great dual responsibility.
They have been asked to provide
material assistance and moral lead
ership to those countries in the rest
of the free world which are strug
gling to return to their own stable,
democratic way of living. In order
to fulfill this first great responsi
bility, the United States must
mainatin and revitalize its demo
cratic institutions, its leadership and
common citizenship, and its domes
tic economic conditions.
Stanford is a leading member of
the NSA. Knowledge of the NSA
should be of great interest to all
students on the campus.
Beginning with this issue, The
Daily will present a series of arti
cles on the NSA, giving its future,
its present organization, its plans
for the future, and, most important
of all, the part Stanford students
have played in and can increasing
ly contribute to this organization
dedicated to peace through justice
and understanding.
