# Encina-Toyon Streets Barricaded To Facilitate Homecoming Traffic
## 
### 
Streets on the Encina-Toyon side
of campus will be barricaded at 11
a.m. Saturday to facilitate direction
of Homecoming traffic.
The barricades are necessary be
cause parking is limited on the
west side of the stadium and re
routing of traffic to other lots
makes an impossible jam. Two of
the west side parking lots have
been plowed up this year. Cars
with special stickers will be per
mitted to pass, Bob Young, SAC
operations manager, said. Others
will have to drive around the Roble
side of campus.
Stanford students are asked to
walk to the game in order to cut
down the traffic and parking prob
lem, Young said. Anyone who is
unable to walk, however may ob-

I tain a special sticker at the SAC.
Parking will be permitted on
Memorial Way and Sierra Street,
although the Galvez entrance of
those streets is blocked.
j There is ample parking on the
lots nearer Palm Drive, but access
I will have to be made from High
way 101 or Palm Drive.
Young says he expects his 180
] parking attendants will be busy
j from mid-morning until an hour
i after the game handling the traffic.
