## Demerit Plan Vote 
### 
In living group house meetings tonight women will be called
upon to vote for or against the new penalty system proposed
by Women's Council. This so-called "vote" is merely an ap
proval of Council's decision. (Since it is a penalty system,
Council can put it into operation with or without approval.)
The Daily has already expressed approval of the plan on the
basis that it would accomplish the objectives of uniformity and
actually promote more individual responsibility for each woman
in upholding social regulations. However, the individual points
of the system are not understood by every woman on campus.
The majority of women are confused. The "demerit" plan has
been the subject of much ill-informed controversy during the
past week simply because not enough correct information was
promulgated by Council. Most of the house discussions last
week were vague and failed to convey the central idea or the
specific details of the plan.
Even Council aided in the mix-up. Last week Marilyn Janeck,
Council chairman, stated that the new system would go into ef
fect as a permanent system. The next day, a Council member
wrote to The Daily stating that the plan would be "temporary."
Actually, the plan will be established permanently at Council's
discretion. If, according to our understanding, it should fail to
work effectively or the mechanical difficulties are too many,
then the whole plan will be abolishedâ€”rather than minor or
temporary changes made during a "trial" period.
We do not expect any such end. Council has worked hard
:or two years to create a better penalty system for social regu
lations.
But since confusion still exists, we point out that every woman
should inform herself of the "demerit" plan provisions by con
tacting Council members today. A negative vote because of
.iack of understanding might spoil an otherwise valuable plan.
