## Bull Session 
### 
Some guys come to Stanford, take six quarters of work, and get out
of the lower division at the time they should. I didn't.
That, in essence, explains why I spent last Saturday not at the Los
Angeles Coliseum, but at the beach on a Geology field trip. The class
met on the campus at 9 a.m. and then went down to see Half Moon Bav

For all I know about Geology, we might just as well
have gone to see Turhan Bey.
Our field instructor said the trip should have im
pressed the members of the class with the important
role which rocks play in our lives. When the trip was
over, he told us to go somewhere and ponder the
immenseness of the earth and its rocks. I did. I went
down to the Stone Cellar and got stoned.
I guess I would have learned more if I had paid
closer attention to the lecturer. But I was interested
in bigger things than the rest of the class. While they
were looking out for quartz, I found a fifth.

The instructor pointed out that many terms which were once used
only by geologists have now become popularized by the laymen. He
asked if we could think of any such phrases. The only one that came to
my mind was ' Pardon me, but your slip is showing."
One of the problems we were required to solve was the identification of
locks picked up on the beach. By mistake I picked up a piece of broken
beer bottle instead of a rock. I didn't have any trouble finding the hard
ness of it (3.2, silly) but it was a little more difficult to classify the
oottle as to its geologic age. I finally decided it belong to the Regal
Paleolithic age.
One of the students found a piece of rock that the instructor identified
as being similar to the minerals found in the Mother Lode country. At
-ast I have discovered what is meant by the term "Mother Lode." I had
always thought a "Mother Lode" was when your father's wife came
Home with a snoot full.
I've come to the conclusion that guys like me just don't have any
iiptitude for such things as geology. And the minute the geology prof
.eads this little essay, he will undoubtedly flunk me in the course. But
I don t care. I don't need a college education to help me make a lot of
money. I've got the cigarette concession at Bob Mitchum's house.
