Views of U.S. Abroad
To the Editor:
The world is certainly watching
the American election, but I think
Jim Joseph is not a very good guide
about its reaction towards U.S. poli
tics.
Most of the world knows that the
United States is a democratic coun
try where most, but not all, citizens
have got the right to vote. They
know that no American becomes "a
potential enemy of the United
States" if he votes for Wallace or
any other candidate.
Having lived in India for 18 years
and read most of the Indian news
papers of recent days, I know that
there is a strong tendency among
people to make stereotypes of Ameri
cans. Recently Americans have
come to look like dollar-happy,
atom-threatening, and imperialistic
minded people.
This View Is Wrong
Of course this picture of American
people is wrong and many sensible
Indians and other foreigners recog
nize it as such.
But it is not due to Mr. Dewey,
Mr. Truman, or other Bipartisans,
that American people are judged
properly abroad. As long as there
arc people like Wallace in America,
America will never be completely
imperialist, they say.
Due to the internal and foreign
policy of U.S. in recent years, this
country has been losing its good
will abroad—especially in Asiatic
countries—at a fast rate. Every time
American-manufactured guns are
fired in China, Indonesia, or Greece;
every time U.S.-suported and fi
nanced French and Arabs fight the
Indochinese or Jews in Israel; every
time a Negro is lynched or shot in
Georgia because he dared to vote;
every time such things happen, the
prestige of U.S. abroad goes down.
On the Other Hand
On the other hand, world loves
the American people even more
when it supports UNRRA; or when
people read that Joe Louis is fight
ing another bout and Larry Doby
played in the World Series; when
they read about Marion Anderson or
Paul Robeson; when they see "A
Gentlemen's Agreement"; and most
of all when Wallace speaks about
peace, international co-operation,
help to undeveloped countries, and
no war with Russia.
Americans must understand that
other countries have no desire to
be crushed in a struggle between
U.S. and Russia. They don't want
to propagate or fight Communism
with the use of war. They want to
outlaw war forever.

Views of U.S. Abroad
To the Editor:
The world is certainly watching
the American election, but I think
Jim Joseph is not a very good guide
about its reaction towards U.S. poli
tics.
Most of the world knows that the
United States is a democratic coun
try where most, but not all, citizens
have got the right to vote. They
know that no American becomes "a
potential enemy of the United
States" if he votes for Wallace or
any other candidate.
Having lived in India for 18 years
and read most of the Indian news
papers of recent days, I know that
there is a strong tendency among
people to make stereotypes of Ameri
cans. Recently Americans have
come to look like dollar-happy,
atom-threatening, and imperialistic
minded people.
This View Is Wrong
Of course this picture of American
people is wrong and many sensible
Indians and other foreigners recog
nize it as such.
But it is not due to Mr. Dewey,
Mr. Truman, or other Bipartisans,
that American people are judged
properly abroad. As long as there
arc people like Wallace in America,
America will never be completely
imperialist, they say.
Due to the internal and foreign
policy of U.S. in recent years, this
country has been losing its good
will abroad—especially in Asiatic
countries—at a fast rate. Every time
American-manufactured guns are
fired in China, Indonesia, or Greece;
every time U.S.-suported and fi
nanced French and Arabs fight the
Indochinese or Jews in Israel; every
time a Negro is lynched or shot in
Georgia because he dared to vote;
every time such things happen, the
prestige of U.S. abroad goes down.
On the Other Hand
On the other hand, world loves
the American people even more
when it supports UNRRA; or when
people read that Joe Louis is fight
ing another bout and Larry Doby
played in the World Series; when
they read about Marion Anderson or
Paul Robeson; when they see "A
Gentlemen's Agreement"; and most
of all when Wallace speaks about
peace, international co-operation,
help to undeveloped countries, and
no war with Russia.
Americans must understand that
other countries have no desire to
be crushed in a struggle between
U.S. and Russia. They don't want
to propagate or fight Communism
with the use of war. They want to
outlaw war forever.
