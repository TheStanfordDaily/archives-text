Reply to Mr. Chandra:
Yes, Mr. Chandra—e veryone
OUGHT to be able to vote his mind
—for Dewey, Truman, Wallace—or
Norman Thomas. Nothing should
influence (hat prerogative. But
SOMETHING DOES influence it:
the eyes of the world. And espe
cially the U.S.S.R.
I never said, nor could ever be
lieve, that voting Wallace is voting
Communist. But I do say that a
Wallace vote will come in for dou
ble interpretation—here, and abroad.
That's the danger of the Wallace
protest. As I plainly said, "The
danger of a protest vote is the
danger of misinterpretation."
And that misinterpretation can
have serious international mean
ing: like the strengthening of
Russian belief that we have here
a strong minority actively sup
porting Wallace policy—which has
been officially endorsed by the
Soviet Union.
For that reason alone, you're
not expressing protest—or politi
cal neutrality—but running a real
risk of listing yourself as a po
tential friend of the Soviet.
Sincerely,
