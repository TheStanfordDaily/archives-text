WASHINGTONâ€”It begins to look
as though it may take longer than
at first expected for the draft to
reach the younger (23 and 24) age
groups.
More 25-year-olds are passing
Army physical and mental exams
than pre-draft estimates indicated.
One state reported unofficially that
during the first week of pre-induc
tion physicals 29 per cent of its 25-
year-olds had made the grade.
This compares with pre-draft esti
mates of about 17 per cent.
If the 29 per cent figure holds up
for all 33,000 of the estimated 25-
year-old draft eligibles, almost all
of the November call for 10,000
draftees will be that age.
