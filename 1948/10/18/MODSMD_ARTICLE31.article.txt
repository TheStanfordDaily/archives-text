SANTIAGO, Chile — Diplomatic
informants say a move is on to soft
pedal disputes over the Antarctic
while the Western world faces the
Russian problem.
Reports in Chile, a claimant to
the frozen territory, indicate the
U.S. is taking the lead. As far as
is known, none of the foreign of
fices concerned—mainly the Argen
tine, Chilean, and British—has com
mitted itself.
These three maintain outposts in
Antarctica. It will be time to change
them when the Southern Hemi
sphere summer starts in December.
