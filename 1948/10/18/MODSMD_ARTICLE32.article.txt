WASHINGTON —The November
election could overnight make the
veteran Texas Senator Tom Con

nally the top-ranking Democrat in
the nation in point of official power
and prestige.
That could result if the Democrats
regain control of the Senate but the
House remains Republican and
Thomas E. Dewey enters the White
House.
In such a situation Connally
would resume the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairmanship
which he relinquished to Senator
Vandenberg (R-Mich.) when the
G.O.P. captured control of the Con
gress two years ago.
In view of the present state of
world affairs, the chairmanship of
that committee would be of utmost
importance.
Mystery of Life
WASHINGTON — Scientists are
virtually certain this generation will
witness the solution of one of the
great mysteries of life—how nature
produces food and fuel.
With this solution these things
may be possible:
1. Production of great quantities
of synthetic fuel to take the place
of oil, coal, and gas. Such new fuels
might be as important as atomic
power.
2. Production of great quantities of
food by non-farm methods, possibly
in the laboratory.
Lewis L. Strauss of the Atomic
Energy Commission says scientists
are well along toward unlocking the
secret. About half of what now is
known has been learned in the past
few years, using methods made
possible by atomic science.
