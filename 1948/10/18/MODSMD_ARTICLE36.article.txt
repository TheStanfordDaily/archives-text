# Broadcast of Football Game Highlights Farm Weekend
## 
### JOHN BUSH 
Activity on the Farm this week
end â–  ran all the way from the
heights of-goy to the lowest depths
of tedium. Due to the absence of
our football squad, plus a thunder
ing horde of rooters, the campus
population was considerably de
pleted.
A few lusty characters headed
north in search of entertainment,
returning with no-end of the usual
disappointment. A few of our more
amazing people (?) indulged in the
forbidden sport of studying. But if
the obvious evidences are accurate,
the majority of roughs spent their
time at Rossotti's. There they
could be seen by the dozen, quaff
ing their daily gallons and listen
ing with ecstacy to the crushing de
feat of the Bruin.
Some of the more vigorous tip
plers engaged in the well-known

game of feetsball a-la-touche. but
most were content to enjoy the
Game of the Year being played i
the Southland.
The intellectual set sat in the
Nitery, in the Cellar cigar store,
or in their rooms, probably listen
ing to the game, or perhaps dis
cussing politics ad nauseam.
Some went, up to Cal to see the
dregs of society maul our hapW>
friends from OSC. Traitors though
they were, they did see a ball game.
The remaining socially-minded
Injuns went to the beach, where a
truly fine time was had. Portables
were there in multitudes, plus the
usual brew and food, making ;i
choice environment for the outdoor
boys.
It can be safely said that there
were few who did not wish they
were in LA to see the world's best
ball team beat the odds.
