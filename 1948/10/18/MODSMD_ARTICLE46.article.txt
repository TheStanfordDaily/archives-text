# Card Soccermen Down Cal Aggies
## 
### 
The Card soccer team romped to
a 4-0 triumph over the Cal Aggies
at Davis Saturday. Amos Salva
dor and Tony Ortega led the way
with two goals each as the Indians
dominated a rough game. Ara
Galstaun and goalie Walt Dunbar
also contributed heavily to the
Farm booters' win.
The first score came midway in
the initial period when Ortega
pushed one past the Aggie goalie
in a melee near the Aggie net. Or
tega then iced the fray for Stanford
with a booming kick from 25 yards
out just after the second quarter
started. Walt Dunbar made a sen
sational stop of a shot near the half.
Salvador added two more tallies
in the fourth period as the game
turned into a rout. The Davis lads
played an aggressive game in the
last half in an effort to dent a
patched - up Card defense. Jerry
Simpson, Stanford right half, be
came the eighth casualty of the sea
son, suffering a hip injury early in
the fourth stanza.
The play of James Sacerdote and
Leo Weinstein, reserves until Sat
urday's tilt, was praised by Coach
Segel who indicated that he would
be counting heavily on both from
now on. Sacerdote, who took Beezy
Jones' spot, performed particularly
well though lack of size hampered
him in the rough going. Ara Gal
staun again lived up to his reputa
tion with an aggressive, well - co
ordinated game at inside.
The Farm's three - back defense

held on the playing of John Ah
rens, Ted Belknap, and Larry Pe
terson. It was obvious that more
experience was needed in the half
back line where only Jarvis Slade
showed a polished game.
Today the Farm team turns its
attention to the first of two games
with California, scheduled for Ma
loney Field next Saturday.
