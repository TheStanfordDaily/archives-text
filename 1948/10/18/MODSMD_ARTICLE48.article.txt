# Albert Shines; 49ers Win Eighth
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 17 (>P). —A
left - handed magician, named
Frankie Albert, disguised himself
in a San Francisco uniform today
and completely bewildered the New
York Yankees and 29,7.43 paying
customers, 21 to 7, in an All-Amer
ica Conference football game.
It was the eighth straight league
triumph for the Californians, who
share the top in the Western half
of the loop with Cleveland, also un
beaten.
Albert wasn't the entire show as
the two teams battled on virtually
even terms, but it was his heady
play that held the 49ers together
despite a vicious New York line
that threw San Francisco backs for
loss after loss.
Albert to 'Strike'
The first period was scoreless,
but on the second play of the sec
ond period the ever-present Albert
flung a 21-yard toss to John Strzy
kalski on the goal line. The latter
scored on one step. In the same
period the same Albert sneaked one
yard for a marker while the entire
New York outfit expected Norm
Standlce to blast the distance.
The scoring pass to Strzykalski
was the 14th game in which Albert
had turned the trick, establishing a
conference rcord. The final San
Francisco marker, late in the
fourth session, also had the Albert
Imprint. He spun 21 yards to take
the ball deep into Yankee territory
and then sent speedy Jim Cason 28
yards around left end. Joe Perry
finally carried it over.
Saunders to Alford
Spec Saunders was the big wheel
in the New York touchdown which
also came in the fourth. He passed
to Bruce Alford for 29 yards that
took the ball to the 13. On the
fourth smack the Texan went over.
Albert completed six of 13 aerial
attempts for 79 yards. One was in
tercepted—his third in 160 tries. He
punted three times for an average
of 47.8 yards.
