## 
### JOHN BREIER 
The scene was the Stanford lock
room after the Red Machine had
; into high gear and soundly
unced a UCLA team, 34 to 14.
e actors were the team members,
hers of players, sports writers,
:1 Farm well-wishers.
t had been a long time between
nference wins, nine games in
t, and this cast did not let the
•asion go to waste. The locker
>m rang with the shouts of young
n who had finally "come
ough" for themselves, their
ich, and their school.
'We'll Take USC'
"he "We knew we had it in us"
itude was evident as the players
lgratulated one another and
aeh Marchie Schwartz. Everyone
med to be happy, not only that
•y had won a football game, but
t perhaps this day marked the
rt of a new era for Stanford
tball teams. "This is only the
winning," one lad cried. "We'll
e USC the same way next
ek."
"our Whites, Bob end his father
J Gordon and his father, were
hered in one corner of the room,
e elder Whites beamed as visi
s and players alike came over to
ike the hands of two of the men
o had performed so well.
Bob While Scores Three TD's
3ob White had scored three of
■ five touchdowns tallied by the
ds. Gordon was the mainstay of
line that couldn't be denied, a
c that had held UCLA to but 142
ds on the ground. Behind this
e Bob White had accounted fcr
! yards himself.
3ut this victory had been a team
>ject and it was the whole team
it drew the praise of Marchie
iwartz: "The boys just decided
play 60 minutes of football. They
re starved for a win and this
ne was the result."
Schwartz hesitated to single oui
vers for individual praise, but
(1 that he "liked" the play of ends
Laakso and Gene Martin.
