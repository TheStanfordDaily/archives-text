# Cal Rooters Happy When Bears Roll

traditional Big Game rival. Since
the S.F. sports pages covered the
game completely, sideline color is
presented instead of the game ac

At least half an hour before
game time, the California root
ing section worked up to fever
pitch. A cheer leader from the
Philippines taught some fight
yells to the mob of white-shirted
and shirtless California student
body, and the rooters built up a
loud, staccato chant that sounded
like artillery fire.
When the inevitable red-gar
mented woman paraded in front of
the stands, the initial roar resembled
that of an exploding bomb. Then,
of course, followed the traditional
"Take off that RE-E-ED skirt!"
Enter Oskie
"We want Oskie," the rooters
screamed as Oskie failed to appear
and game time approached. Fi
nally the Oregon State team sprinted
on the field, ready to start the game
â€”and there was Oskie, chasing them
all with a club.
During half-time activities the
Oregon State yell leaders wandered
over to the Cal side. The jubilant
Cal rooters promptly rolled them
over their heads up the stadium.
Then they gave a mighty cheer,
"Oregon State yell leaders, Rah!"
The reason for California enthu
siasm was clear. Cal was magnifi
cent. Teamwork and spirit was in
spired. Jensen, ran, kicked, passed,
and blocked like and Ail-American.
Cal looked great four squads deep.
UCLA Scouts Glum
Most unhappy people in the press
box were the UCLA scouts. They
were utterly crushed when the final
score was radioed from Los Angeles,
"Stanford 34, UCLA 14."
Commenting on Pappy Waldorf's
team, they said, "We've seen them
all, and nothing will stop Cal."
When asked if Cal has uncovered
anything or was still hiding plays,
the scouts replied, "Cal doesn't have
to show anything; all they have to
do is show up."
Lon Stiner, Oregon State coach
said, "Let's put Cal in the Rose
Bowl, and stop kidding ourselves.
They deserved every touchdown.
We had plays designed to score and
special defenses planned, but they
weren't enough."
Looking ahead to the Big Game,
press box observers agreed an im
proving Stanford could give Cal a
battle, maybe even win. But the In
dians will have to play 60 minutes
of superb football to do it, they con
cluded.
