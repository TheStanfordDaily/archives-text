THE SPACE
Apologies Department Again—
this time to Rudyard Kipling
112
Now in Stanford's .sunny clime,
Where I uster waste my time,
A'servin' of his majesty, the dean;
! There was just one worthwhile S
i pleasure—
| One sole memory I treasure—
LONGBARN: yea, 'twas double
peachy keen.
—GEORGE ROE
Well, it's better than just emp
ty space in The Space. Something
to break the ice, a come-on to
bashful poets of undoubted talent
who just couldn't think of stoop
ing to dash off a cuplet for their
dinner.
Send 'em to Willie at
LONGBARN
a good place for people who say
they learn more out of classes
than in them
