# Decorations
## 
### 
Living groups who have not signed
up their house decoration themes
for Homecoming this weekend
should do so today in the ASSU
Office, said Jean Burnet, house dec
orations chairman.
The only prerequisite of the deco
rations is that they fit in with the
general overall Homecoming theme
of "Indians in Troyland." They
should also be adequately lighted
since judging will take place Friday
night after the rally. A large tro
phy will be awarded to the winner
of the men's and women's groups,
and cups will be given to the run
ners-up in each group.
House decoration activities will
be centered on the Row and the
women's Row houses will be open
to the public. The band will give
a concert.
All living groups are urged to
participate in this house decoration
contest. OfT-the-Row houses may
decorate where they are or go in
with a Row house. Just the fronts
of the houses are to be decorated.
House decorations are just a part
of the Homecoming weekend fes
tivities, sponsored by Cardinals,
which also includes the Pajamarino
Rally and dance for the freshmen
Thursday night, the Homecoming
Rally and dance, Friday night and
the Alumni Luncheon Saturday
noon.
