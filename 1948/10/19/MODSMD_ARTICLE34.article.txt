## 
### 
i WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (/P).—
j President Trunin today created an
| emergency board to head off a pos
[ sible strike by 1,000,000 railroad
workers.
Sixteen rail unions have already
begun taking a strike vote. They
I are asking an eight-hour cut in the
: basic work week—from 48 to 40
hours—without a decrease in pay.
They have also demanded an in
crease of 25 cents an hour in basic
wage rates.
Mr. Truman said in an executive
order that a strike would "threaten
substantial interruption to inter
state commerce" and "deprive the
country of essential transportation
service."
Under the Railroad Labor Act, a
work stoppage is forbidden while
the emergency board is studying
the dispute. The board has 30 days
to make its findings. Thereafter,
neither strike nor lockout can be
ordered within (50 days after the
board's recommendations go to the
White House.
The unions involved represent
ihe so-called "non-operating" em
ployees who are not actually en
gaged in running trains. They in
clude switchmen, yardmen* main
tenance workers, telegraphers, and
others.
