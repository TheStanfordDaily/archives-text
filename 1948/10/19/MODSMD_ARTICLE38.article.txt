## HCL vs. Farm Tuition 
### 
The high cost of living hit Stanford again this year when the
University increased the tuition fee from $500 to $600 per year.
Three reasons justified such a move:
1. Academic salaries were so low in comparison with many
other American universities that Stanford faced the possible
loss of important faculty members. Some high-ranking aca
demic positions on the staff paid less than several universities'
minimum salary schedules for comparable positions. The old
salary scale, moreover, was too low to attract new faculty mem
bers.
Increased tuition costs were not necessarily designed bring
high-priced, big-named instructors to the Farm, and strengthen
ing the academic staff will be a gradual process. The higher fac
ulty salaries, however, will be added incentive for prospective
instructors when they apply for academic positions.
2. The University will initiate a contributory retirement pro
gram for its non-academic employees because they are not eli
gible for social security pensions. Employees may join this pro
gram by allotting a portion of their wages to the retirement fund.
The University also will contribute to the fund. After the em
ployees retire, they will receive pensions for the remainder of
their lifetime. Academic employees have been contributing to a
similar retirement system for several years.
3. Since tuition fees were raised, Stanford had to increase funds
to cover grants-in-aid, scholarship awards, and loans. The Uni
versity diverted enough money to special funds to aid students
handicapped by the higher tuition fee.
The immediate results of the higher tuition cost have been two
fold. Stanford kept its academic staff intact. In the meantime,
some instructors have been added to the staff. A third result
will unfold in a few months when the University releases its
voluntary pension plan for non-academic employees.
A future issue of The Daily will carry a more complete story
on the use of the additional tuition revenue.
