## Less Monotonous Yammering Asked 
### 
To the Editor:
I would suggest to your yell leader 1 s monotonous yammering (like
"all the way on one play") at the rooting section, and also the crowd.
It is very irritating and hardly conducive to cooperation in yelling. I
would suggest more "go," old yells, and fight yelling. Your stuff is too
complicated for a crowd.
