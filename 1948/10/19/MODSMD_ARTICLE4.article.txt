# 'Big Three' Fuse Trade in Germany
## 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 18 (/P).—The West
ern powers took another big step
today toward unification of their
occupation zones in Germany.
After long delay the French
agreed to fuse the foreign trade of
their zone with that of the British
and American zones.
It was not a complete economic
merger like that achieved last year
in the British-American zones. But
it went a long way toward the uni
fication sought by the British and
Americans in their efforts to build
up Western Germany for an active
role in the European Recovery Pro
gram.
The move emphasized further the
isolation of the Soviet occupation
zone. A similar fusion along the
political lines will be accomplished
by the Tri-Zonal government for
which a constitution is being draft
ed by Germans in Bonn. This will
result in a virtually complete new
West German state.
