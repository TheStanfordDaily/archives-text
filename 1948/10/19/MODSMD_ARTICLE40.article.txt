# Against "Curve Humpers"
## 
### 
To the Editor:
May we present this little article for publication in The Daily. In many
ways this little "gem" expresses our feelings so adequately.
Isn't it about time that educators in our outstanding universities and
colleges realize that mass production of hermit-like "curve bumpers"
with no interests outside of gaining exceptional grade point averages is
decidedly to the disadvantage of a world in which human beings are
rapidly losing all pretensions of individuality?
A lot of fellows want to go into law, medicine, engineering, and other
professions, but they are beginning to wonder whether it is worthwhile.
What do you think?
EDUCATION FOR THE FEW
"Increasing concern is being expressed over the fact that a major
portion of the fundamental scientific discoveries and theories have
been coming from Europe, in spite of the far greater number of stu
dents and generally superior laboratory facilities in this country.
"Why has the U.S. not been relatively prominent in the produc
tion of fundamentally new ideas?
"We are wondering whether, even in the relatively free institutions
like M.1.T., the pressure of numbers and the tradition of daily class
assignments and emphasis on graduates may not be acting to inhibit
the discovery and development of real genius Some was to fire
the most gifted students with a burning curiosity and a driving en
thusiasm for their subject, as against the passing of successive les
sons with high grades, is still to be achieved on a satisfactory scale."
