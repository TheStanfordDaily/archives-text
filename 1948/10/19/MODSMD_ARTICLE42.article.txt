Dear Mom:
I've just returned from my long
weekend in Los Angeles. Didn't
touch a book at all and am com
pletely exhausted.
I rode down on Thursday night
with the band on the sleeper. Who
ever called it that must have been
traveling with delegates to a WCTU
convention. The minute we stepped
inside the car .someone hollered for
a game of bridge.
Some time after midnight the
Pullman quieted down to a rumble
—the rumble of the wheels beneath
the floorboards. The only car in
which anyone had any peace was
the third one, where the married
musicians slept. I guess the wives
kept them quiet.
When we arrived at the Union
Depot, everyone hollered, "Here
come the Reds!'' No one knew
whether they were talking about
the porters, Joseph Stalin, or us.
They found out Saturday afternoon.
We were bussed over to West
wood where we marched triumph
antly up about 100 steps to the quad
where the coronation ceremony was
taking place. The queen got a bet
ter welcome from the Stanford band
and from the handful of Indian
rooters than from the entire UCLA
contingent.
At night Hollywood was in its
splendor. Swinging flood lights il
luminated the sky and the parade
route, while cameras ground out
hundreds of feet of film and the
loudspeakers blared out above the
din of yelling onlookers.
UCLA was the perfect host. One
of their bandsmen told me it was
an cflort to show Stanford how
hospitable a university could be.
They gave us food, lodging, and
dancing partners. We felt kind
of sheepish when we remembered
how the Farm treated the Bruin
hand when they visited Palo Alto
last year. It was a lesson in cour
tesy, and I hope Stanford lias
learned it.
Their homecoming plans however
were spoiled by one event — the
Saturday game. The only Bruin
property which showed any sign of
life was the blue and gold banner
which managed to "float" over to
the Cardinal rooting section. It now
rests in the Indians' Palo Alto te
pee.
Saturday could have been called
A 1 Capp day. Three or four Stan
ford card stunts portrayed the Li'l
Abner schmoos, and the UCLA
band used Kickapoo Joyjuice to re
vive three wooden Indians in the
halftime stunts.
After the game. Los Angeles re
porters headed for the dressing
rooms and came out with the news
Sunday morning that the Indian
took its victory "calmly and quiet
ly." That was not the case with the
rooting section. We yelled long and
loud, but were forced to remain in
our stands to protect the banner
and our property. It was frustrat
ing. One yell leader said, "I've been
waiting two years to lead a victory
yell on the' opponents' side of the
field and now I can't take the root
ers across the field."
But it's all over now—the biggest
weekend of the year so far.

how the Farm treated the Bruin
hand when they visited Palo Alto
last year. It was a lesson in cour
tesy, and I hope Stanford lias
learned it.
Their homecoming plans however
were spoiled by one event — the
Saturday game. The only Bruin
property which showed any sign of
life was the blue and gold banner
which managed to "float" over to
the Cardinal rooting section. It now
rests in the Indians' Palo Alto te
pee.
Saturday could have been called
A 1 Capp day. Three or four Stan
ford card stunts portrayed the Li'l
Abner schmoos, and the UCLA
band used Kickapoo Joyjuice to re
vive three wooden Indians in the
halftime stunts.
After the game. Los Angeles re
porters headed for the dressing
rooms and came out with the news
Sunday morning that the Indian
took its victory "calmly and quiet
ly." That was not the case with the
rooting section. We yelled long and
loud, but were forced to remain in
our stands to protect the banner
and our property. It was frustrat
ing. One yell leader said, "I've been
waiting two years to lead a victory
yell on the' opponents' side of the
field and now I can't take the root
ers across the field."
But it's all over now—the biggest
weekend of the year so far.
Dear Mom:
I've just returned from my long
weekend in Los Angeles. Didn't
touch a book at all and am com
pletely exhausted.
I rode down on Thursday night
with the band on the sleeper. Who
ever called it that must have been
traveling with delegates to a WCTU
convention. The minute we stepped
inside the car .someone hollered for
a game of bridge.
Some time after midnight the
Pullman quieted down to a rumble
—the rumble of the wheels beneath
the floorboards. The only car in
which anyone had any peace was
the third one, where the married
musicians slept. I guess the wives
kept them quiet.
When we arrived at the Union
Depot, everyone hollered, "Here
come the Reds!'' No one knew
whether they were talking about
the porters, Joseph Stalin, or us.
They found out Saturday afternoon.
We were bussed over to West
wood where we marched triumph
antly up about 100 steps to the quad
where the coronation ceremony was
taking place. The queen got a bet
ter welcome from the Stanford band
and from the handful of Indian
rooters than from the entire UCLA
contingent.
At night Hollywood was in its
splendor. Swinging flood lights il
luminated the sky and the parade
route, while cameras ground out
hundreds of feet of film and the
loudspeakers blared out above the
din of yelling onlookers.
UCLA was the perfect host. One
of their bandsmen told me it was
an cflort to show Stanford how
hospitable a university could be.
They gave us food, lodging, and
dancing partners. We felt kind
of sheepish when we remembered
how the Farm treated the Bruin
hand when they visited Palo Alto
last year. It was a lesson in cour
tesy, and I hope Stanford lias
learned it.
