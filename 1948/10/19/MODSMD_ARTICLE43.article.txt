# Cal Raiders Talk Big, Damage Little
## 
### 
"Sonic people have come to our
ofTice bragging about painting up
the Stanford Quad; is it true?" in
quired the night editor of the Daily
Californian in a telephone call to
the Daily shack late yesterday af
ternoon.
A little checking proved the Cal
raiders were a hair boastful about
the damage. A hydrant and a palm
tree on Quad had been slightly
daubed with paint. Also a crude
blue "C" had been painted on the
cement, but it was removed by
workmen.
Toyon Hall's flagpole was paint
ed, and a blue "C" was smudged
on the sidewalk in front of Encina
Hall.
The raiders told the Daily Cali
fornian that they were captured by
police but escaped. However, Gor
dy Davis, Stanford police chicf, said
it wasn't so. He said the damage
wasn't reported, it was so slight.

"It seems a little early for Big Game
raids," Davis said.
They also painted "C's" on the
bandhouse.
Chief Davis added that he hoped
no one from Stanford would feel
compelled to pay a return visit to
the Berkeley campus. "We've al
ways frowned on damage to build
ings. There arc more sporting
methods of rivalry," he concluded.
