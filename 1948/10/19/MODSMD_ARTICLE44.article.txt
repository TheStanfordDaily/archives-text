Local Laughter:
Chuckling Tom Self is still chuckling about the story that was turned
in by one of the girls who was trying out for a job on The Daily. This
sweet young thing was assigned to cover one of the lectures on sex
given for the girls at Branner Hall at the beginning of the quarter.

When the s.y.t. turned in her story, the following
paragraph was included in what she had written.
. and during your college career many oppor
tunities will present themselves; take advantage of
these chances, as there will never be others like them! - '
Needless to say, the girl was immediately given a
job on The Daily.

A friend of mine came up to me Sunday night at
the welcoming rally for the football team.
"1 saw your item in Friday's paper," he said, "about
the Palo Alio merchant who was giving a prize for

~ iwi
the lowest test grade of the week. So I took in a test on which 1 had
gotten a score of five."
"What sort of a prize did you win?" I asked.
"Win, hell!" he complained, "some other guy had already won the prize,
a pair of argyle socks, with a Poly Sci test on which he made a grade ol
exactly ZERO."
Who says nobody is perfect?

The boys in the dishroom at Encina Dining Hall will get a kick out
of this one.
It seems that head dishwasher Loren Smith went over to Roble the
other night to pick up his date and received an unexpected greeting
from the woman on the switchboard.
"Smitty," who is probably about 23 years old, sidled up to the switch
board and asked the woman in charge if she would call his girl.
"Certainly," answered the lady. "What's your daughter's name?"
That's all right, Smith, you can always try Scrutan.

Harvesting the current crop of movies:
You'll find no end of controversy on the subject of whether or not
the Italian production of "Carmen, now showing locally, is worth the
price of admission. Personally, I didn't care for it, but that's just the
opinion of one man. Or perhaps I should say the opinion of one boy. The
correct word in this case is governed by whether you're using the age
standards of the draft board or the Board of Equalization.
Anyway, it's the opinion of one something, and that opinion isn't too
favorable.
We will, however, be very happy to make a free pitch for the new
Howard Hawks' opus "Red River." Mr. Hawks, who needs a plug from
me about as bad as Artie Shaw needs another wife, has quite a hit on
his hands with this well-done Western. John Wayne, Montgomery Clift,
and Joanne Dru (Mrs. Dick Haymes) head an excellent cast. Keep your
eye on this fellow Clift. He looks and acts very much like a younger
and smaller Clark Gable.
