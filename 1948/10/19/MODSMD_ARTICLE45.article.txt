tion in Western Europe as seen through Belgian and Dutch eyes.)

If tomorrow the Russians launched
World War 111, they would meet
less resistance in Western Europe
than the Germans did in 1940.
Bizonia, the Low Countries, and
F ranee, all would be doubtlessly
swallowed within one week.
The Soviets have not done it yet
as they are not through with the
huge military preparations re
qured. But when the time is ripe,
they will go ahead without worry
ing much about atom bombs or
anything else. First, because —in
accordance with Marx's teaching—
war is now their only chance to
overrule the whole world. Second,
because life, even of their own peo
ple, is not a consideration the So
viet leaders would stop at. Third,
because they probably have the
atom bomb themselves.
This poses the problem of West
ern Europe's defense. As has been
recalled recently here, push-button
warfare is a rather premature con
ception, and the old-fashioned bat
tlefields would be the scene of
World War 111 once more.
American newspapers and maga
zines have tackled the question, and
some—as the Hearst press—contend
that the only lines on which the
Russians can be stopped in Europe
are the English Channel and the
Pyrenees — the border between
France and Spain.
It explains why so many Ameri
can businessmen are wooing Franco

these days—a move which disheart
ens many Europeans: it seems that
the United States is ready to give
up her old-time, faithful allies and
to place her confidence in Hitler's
friend. Communism in Europe can
not be better encouraged.
Indeed, we can explain this at
titude by the weakness of France.
With 30 per cent avowed Commu
nists in their ranks, the French
forces would be probably neutral
ized even before fighting. Only a
few divisions of the regular army
can be relied on.
The picture is completely differ
ent in regard to the Benelux coun
tries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Luxemburg. Here we have 18 mil
lion people with few or no Com
munists. Lying at a doubly stra
tegical crossroad, thoy back up the
Ruhr's heavy industrial centers and
cover the British bastion.
Benelux is the nucleus of a close
collaboration between the nations
of Western Europe, and last March
in Brussels entered a military con
vention with Britain and France.
Should France fall off, the role of
Benelux would become consider
able, not only on account of its
strategical position as a defense
platform but in so far as it would
provide the Allied armies with a
large bridgehead to be used in fu
ture offensive operations aiming . t
Europe's liberation.
Let us remember the Normandy
invasion and the tremendous diffi
culties it had met: a one-year prep
aration. ships by thousands, "mul
berries" (floating docks), prelimi
narp bombings, paratroopers, and
finally the waves of soldiers sacri
ficed in the landing. Unless a Bene
lux bridgehead is maintained, all
this would have to be paid again
and at a higher cost in the event
of a new D-Day.
Adequately armed and with a re
inforcement of 20 to 30 British di
visions. the 1.500,000 men of the
Benelux armies could cling to that
vital bridgehead several weeks,
until the bulk of the U.S. Army
would have crossed the Atlantic.
