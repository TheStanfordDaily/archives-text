# Stanford's Student Federalists Work for World Federation
## 
### DALE CHAMPION 
As the Federal Council of Churches has advanced to a world
;vel, so the World Federalists have made it an international
>sue to choose between nationalism and world federation.
Three years ago 10 Stanford students, confirmed in the belief
lat world government is a compelling necessity, established

•re a chapter of Student World*
ederalists. Since then the mem- j
>rship of the local chapter has in- j
eased to 75.
Student Federalist action on the j
mpus level is mainly on the cdu- |
tion plane. Student Federalists
'lievc, as the UNESCO docs, "that
ars start in the minds of men, and
erefore it is in the minds of men !
at the defenses of peace must be '
nstructed."
The aims and purposes of the j
anford Student Federalists are |
entical with the World Movement
r World Federal Government or
nization, which came into being j
st year at a conference held at
ontreux, Switzerland.
World Federalists propose that
e nations of the world set up a
deral union with a central gov
nment authorized and empowered
a constitution to settle all prob
ns of international concern. In a [
oad sense, they suggest a United '
ales of the World.
UN Mere Association
The UN and the League of Na
ns, World Federalists point out, |
c both mere associations of fully J
vereign nations. And such loose I
sociations have never prevented
ir. Each proposal put before the j
is inevitably tied to the special |
crest of one or another of the big
wers.
A cool, logical, and reasonable |
alysis of the current scene has j
tercd their aim toward eventual j
>rld government by way of a peo- j
's constituent assembly. Federal
-5 believe the need for government j
a world level is the same as our j
cd for government in commu- j
ies. states, and nations. They are
ivinced that discussion, argu
•nt, voting, and implementation of
: expressed desire of the voters
i be extended to the world level.
Movement Worldwide
The Federalist movement is
rid-wide in scope. France, China, [
i Japan have constitutional pro- '
ions concerned with world gov
lmcnt. Over a million people in
; Scandinavian nations arc active
the movement.
'Lans arc now under way to hold
official elections of representatives j
the world constituent assembly
1950. It is hoped the pressure of
•orablc public opinion stemming j
m the calling of this people's as
nbly will result in the strength
ng of the UN by causing the UN
alter to be amended in such a
y as to create a true world union
federated states.
