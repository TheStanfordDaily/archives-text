# Frosh Flash In Bruin Clash
## 
### 
Setting the stage perfectly for
the varsity's coup Saturday in the
Los Angeles Coliseum, the Stanford
frosh mistook UCLA's wee bears
for rugs and walked over them to
a 23 to 6 victory.
The crowd saw a number of bril
liant individual performances that
spotlighted the team's showing. Eric
South wood, Card right half, was a
show in himself as he rambled up
and down the field in a display
of ball - packing finesse unequaled
even in the varsity fray.
McColl Shows Well
Dick Horn and Gary Kerkorian
split the quarterback chores pretty
evenly during the afternoon, both
performing creditably, with the as
sistance of end Bill McColl. McColl,
a wingman who makes any passer
look good, caught everything that
was thrown at him during the af
ternoon except for one pass. On
that occasion the UCLA defender in
pure frustration abandoned ortho
dox tactics and attempted to stran
gle McColl, who forgot about the
ball in an attempt to save his life.
Half Glen Crawford, substituting
for Harry Hugasian, also proved a
bright spot both offensively and de
| fensively, scoring for the Papooses
! along with fullback Marv Mella
way and Southwood.
Line Play Good
In the line it was Captain Jess
: Cone along with his fellow guards,
Owen Powell. Bernie Tokarz, and
A 1 Raisch, who caused the West-
I wooders the most misery. Reserve
tackle Bruce Mikesell looked good
on defense, as did center Dave
Worley.
McColl kicked goal on all three
of the locals' scores, while a safety
| accounted for the Cardbabes' other
two points.
However, Coach Chuck Taylor,
| while pleased about the result, said
j that he was not entirely satisfied
I with the team's showing. He indi
cated that a lot of hard work lies
ahead for the '52 men this week
as they ready themselves for the
i USC frosh invasion this Saturday.
