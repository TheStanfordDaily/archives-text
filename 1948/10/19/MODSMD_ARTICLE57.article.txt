# Water Poloists Split in L.A.
## 
### 
Stanford's water poloists looked
like defending champions when
they trounced UCLA 10 to 5 at Los
Angeles last Saturday, after drop
ping a rough tilt the previous day
to Southern Cal 9 to 2.
The team showed sparkling of
fense light from the start against
the Bruins, as forward Fritz Mauer
poured in three quick goals. The
locals increased their lead to 7 to 2
at the half, and kept it up in the
second half to coast to their first
PCC win of the year.
The game on Friday against the
Trojans was quite the reverse. The
Southern Cal guards literally "sad
riled" the Indian forwards by rid
ing on their backs all through the
game. Since the referee wasn't call
ing any fouls, the Cards gave the
Trojans a little of their own medi
cine in the second half, but by that
time it was too late. The men of
Troy led (5 to 1 at the half. Maybe
the story will be different when the
Cards meet the Trojans here next
Saturday.
Scorers in the games were:
Against USC —Harry Borchers, 2.
Against UCLA—Fritz Mauer, 5;
Borchers, 2; Ken Fox. 2; and Dean
The traveling squad was: For

wards — Captain Botchers, Mauer.
Weeden, Hub Stokely, and Don
Patch; guards —Ralph Sala, Ken
Fox, Ed Major, and John Mowat;
goalies —Kim Fletcher and Marsh
Pearlnian.
