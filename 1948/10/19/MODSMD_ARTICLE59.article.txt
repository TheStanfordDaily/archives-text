# Chaplain Engle Leaves Farm for Redwood City
## 
### 
Associate Chaplain Gale W.
Engle announced today that he
will leave Stanford at the end
of this month to assume duties
as minister of the First Congre
gational Church in Redwood City.
Engle, who has been acting as
religious advisor and chaplain in
the Village, where he has lived for
the last year, said that this move
marks a return to the parish after
three years in other allied religious
work.
While preaching and managing
the Redwood City church, Engle in
tends to continue attending classes
at Stanford, where he is working
toward a doctorate in the field of
education.
New Opportunities
He mentioned three particular
opportunities offered in his new
work: first, "the increase in popula
tion, almost unparalleled" of Red
wood City in recent years; second,
the challenge offered in a possible
future shift of location and new con
struction, "so that the Church might
be closer to the people in the resi
dential districts"; and the oppor
tunity to continue his Stanford
studies.
When asked for comment about
his year at Stanford, Engle said he
would miss in the future "the stimu
lation of student life."
Enjoyed Village Life
"I have especially enjoyed the op
portunities to spend time with mv
'peers' over in the Village," he said,
"for I think that the chance to share
mind and experience is one of the
unparalleled opportunities of college
life."
"I have, of course, also greatly en
joyed working with my colleague,
Reverend Minto."
Asked about the future Village
organization, Engle said. "I believe
there is a great potential in the
Village life and student, and it would
be unfortunate if for any reason it
should be neglected. I hope to see
in the future a bigger and better
coordination of Village religious
and other activities."
