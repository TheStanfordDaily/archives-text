# Farm Fraternities Are in the Black

### 
Stanford fraternities are in the
black, according to Auditor War
ren M. Turner in his report sub
mitted to Interfraternity Council.
The lucrative houses all have
money in the bank. Total for the
houses is $59,335 or an average of
$2,473 for each. These figures do not
include money held by alumni cor
porations either for repairs or emer
gencies.
The latest report, indicating fra
ternity finances up to the start of
this quarter, shows six houses with
no unpaid house bills, and the other
18 houses with unpaid bills averag
ing $151 each.
The fraternity auditing system
was organized in 1932 by the Finance
Committee of Interfraternity Board
of Control. Each month the com
mittee, through its auditor, furnishes
all houses with a report on their
financial condition.
