## 
### 
It's a bit early to talk of Thanks
giving, but it's never too early to
talk about CARE, which is ending
special holiday packages with tur
key and the trimnffings to Europe.
Special order blanks for the holi
day service are available at Palo
Alto Red Cross headquarters. 400
Mitchell Lane. The price for turkey
is $15 per package to Western Eu
rope and $17 50 to Berlin (which
covers the air-lift cost to the block
aded German capital).
Each package contains a whole
turkey steam-roasted in aluminum
foil and canned under pressure to
retain the flavor. Also included are
butter, sugar, coffee, plum pudding,
chocolate, rice, lemon juice, spices,
bacon, preserves, hard candy, and
one can opener.
