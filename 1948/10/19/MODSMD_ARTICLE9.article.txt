### 
EVANSVILLE, Ind., Oct. 18 {&)—
Two men were injured seriously to
day in a 90-minute battle with two
chimpanzees which escaped from
their cage at Mesker Park Zoo on
the west side of Evansville.
Four sheriff's deputies, half a
dozen policemen, and several zoo
officials joined in the melee which
ended in the death of the male chimp
and the recapture of his mate.
