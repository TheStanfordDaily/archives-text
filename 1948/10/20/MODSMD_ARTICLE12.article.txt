# Pamphlets Drop Friday
## 
### 
Two thousand pamphlets adver
tising Homecoming Weekend will be
dropped on campus Friday, said
Bob Leefeldt, homecoming chair
man.
These pamphlets will be num
bered and holders of the lucky
numbers will be entitled to a free
dinner at one of the resturants on
El Camino, Leefeldt said. The lucky
winners will be announced next
week.
"So everyone pick up as many
pamphlets as he can find, and maybe
he will win a free dinner," he com
mented.
The Administration says that this
should not be considered a prece
dent. Special permission was
granted for the dropping of pam
phlets for the homecoming activities.
