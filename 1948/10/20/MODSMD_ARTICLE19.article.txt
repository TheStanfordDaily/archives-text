# Psych Experiment keeps Quad Wondering
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
A girl handed me an animal
cracker today.
I was walking through Inner
Quad and she just walked over and
gave it to me.
Thinking the situation a little out
of the ordinary, I decided to stick
around a while. Pretty soon she
began to shoot animal cookies with
a rubber band into the bushes.
Then she walked to room 5G and
knocked on the door. She walked
in, her face flushed, her hands
trembling.
I talked to the prof after class and
discovered it was some sort of

a psychological experiment. They
were testing the validity of the
Jung theory of word association.
The professor told me he had given
two students instruction sheets. I'd
already seen what the girl was
asked to do, but the boy had to go
behind the chapel, take off his right
hoe and wrap a red string around
his big toe, take a paper doll from
the envelope and put it beneath
his heel.
When the girl arrived back in
class she was told to sit down. The
professor read a list of words, and
after each word the girl was in
structed to reply with the first thing

that came into her mind. Among '
j the innocent words were certain
key words like animal, lion, crack
: er, rubber band, paper doll, red,
j and string.
, The boy was also questioned sep
j arately. Then a jury of fellow class
! mates decided which student had
! been subjected to the red string ex
periment and which had done the
| animal cracker experiment. The
dead giveaway on the girl's part
was responding to cracker with
animal. The boy, they decided,
gave himself away when he an
swered doll with Mills Brothers,
leading makers of paper dolls.
