# Constitution Revision issue Once More Faces Excom
## Committee Hopes to Place Revision Before Student Body in Near Future 
### KEN MOORE 
"We want a new Constitution," was the request brought to the
floor last Wednesday night at Excom meeting.
Each year the Stanford Constitution goes to press, but before
authorizing the printing this year, Excom is faced with the fol
lowing problem:
1. Shall the old, inadequate Constitution be printed; or, 2.
shall the revised Constitution, which a committee appointed by
Excom finished last year be printed; or, 3. should a fresh start
be made and a new, clear, and workable constitution drafted?
UNDECIDED ISSUE
Excom agrees unanimously that the old Constitution needs
straightening out. It remains undecided whether the revised
constitution should be put up in the election this fall or whether
it would be best to wait until the new constitution can be drafted.
Ted Norton, member of last year's Constitutional Revision
Committee, believes that a new constitution would be the best
thing, but he doesn't think it can be passed soon enough to meet
Stanford's needs this year.
As he explained, it took the last committee all year to prepare
the revised constitution. Before a constitution can be put to a
student vote, it has to be passed by the Law School and Political
Science Department for form and style. After this check, the
President of the University must pass on its merits.
The revised constitution has already been through the first
two steps and merely awaits the President's approval.
NORTON WANTS ELECTION
For this reason, Norton believes that the revised constitution
fhould be brought to a vote in the forthcoming fall election, so
that Stanford won't be handicapped another year by a weak
constitution. In the meantime, the new constitution can be care
fully worked out.
Marianna Olmsted, chairman of the New Constitution Com
mittee, thinks that presenting two constitutions to the students in
one year would cause a loss of interest.
She also believes that a complete redrafting of the constitu
tion can be accomplished in a shorter period of time than the
necessary technical revisions which last year's committee under
took.
Its not a major job," she said. "Parts of the present Consti
tution are good and will be used again."
After completion of the work on the Constitution, she said
that work can be started on the by-laws, and organization char
ters will be reviewed and made to conform with the Constitution.
For example, at present, Excom must listen to minutes of many
campus organizations which are responsible to Excom. Minimiz
ing these would allow more time for Excom's consideration of
other matters.

student vote, it has to be passed by the Law School and Political
Science Department for form and style. After this check, the
President of the University must pass on its merits.
The revised constitution has already been through the first
two steps and merely awaits the President's approval.
NORTON WANTS ELECTION
For this reason, Norton believes that the revised constitution
fhould be brought to a vote in the forthcoming fall election, so
that Stanford won't be handicapped another year by a weak
constitution. In the meantime, the new constitution can be care
fully worked out.
Marianna Olmsted, chairman of the New Constitution Com
mittee, thinks that presenting two constitutions to the students in
one year would cause a loss of interest.
She also believes that a complete redrafting of the constitu
tion can be accomplished in a shorter period of time than the
necessary technical revisions which last year's committee under
took.
Its not a major job," she said. "Parts of the present Consti
tution are good and will be used again."
After completion of the work on the Constitution, she said
that work can be started on the by-laws, and organization char
ters will be reviewed and made to conform with the Constitution.
For example, at present, Excom must listen to minutes of many
campus organizations which are responsible to Excom. Minimiz
ing these would allow more time for Excom's consideration of
other matters.
"We want a new Constitution," was the request brought to the
floor last Wednesday night at Excom meeting.
Each year the Stanford Constitution goes to press, but before
authorizing the printing this year, Excom is faced with the fol
lowing problem:
1. Shall the old, inadequate Constitution be printed; or, 2.
shall the revised Constitution, which a committee appointed by
Excom finished last year be printed; or, 3. should a fresh start
be made and a new, clear, and workable constitution drafted?
UNDECIDED ISSUE
Excom agrees unanimously that the old Constitution needs
straightening out. It remains undecided whether the revised
constitution should be put up in the election this fall or whether
it would be best to wait until the new constitution can be drafted.
Ted Norton, member of last year's Constitutional Revision
Committee, believes that a new constitution would be the best
thing, but he doesn't think it can be passed soon enough to meet
Stanford's needs this year.
As he explained, it took the last committee all year to prepare
the revised constitution. Before a constitution can be put to a
student vote, it has to be passed by the Law School and Political
Science Department for form and style. After this check, the
President of the University must pass on its merits.
