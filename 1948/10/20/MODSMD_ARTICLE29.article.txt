## A
						Graduate School?

First guesses on enrollment figures for winter quarter indicate
ihat graduate students will number around 3,000 and upper di
vision 2,579. Lower division will have about 2,330.
Do these figures indicate that the rumored trend to make Stan
ford a graduate school is operating?
Even if the Committee on Scholarships isn't consciously point
ing for a graduate school, the upper division and graduate
schools are still top heavy. Now, as in time of normal enroll
ment, only 800 entering freshmen are taken. When the total
undergraduate figure was 3,000, the entering freshmen consti
tuted about 27 per cent of the undergraduate student body. Now
they are only 15 per cent.
Stanford's population was "just going to be cut" this year.
But the number of extra graduates admitted pushed the total en
rollment to an all-time high. It was felt more grads had to be
taken because the faculty likes to work with older students.
We not only oppose any move towards making Stanford a
graduate school exclusively, but we think any cut in enrollment
should be made in the top divisions—for a large number of
reasons.
In the first place, as the graduate schools and upper division
become top heavy, the better instructors are drained from the
lower division. As an expected result, lower division work suf
fers. And Stanford doesn't seem to have enough top-grade faculty
members to take care of expanded grad and upper divisions.
Top heavy emphasis on graduate school and upper division
work tends to obscure the other side of a university—learning
to live.
Graduate students tend to be bookish, and secluded. They
don't take part in the family like living of the Farm or activities.
Traditions suffer, and considerable zest is lost when the
younger students are excluded.
The sports program certainly suffers.
It is our belief Stanford was intended as an undergraduate
school—where a student could go on for advanced degrees if
he wished. But when the founders said they were building a
university of high degree, they didn't mean only those seeking
high degrees would be welcomed.
The Stanfords wanted a generous education for all—but we
think especially for the younger Westerners.
