## Bull Session 
### 
Must be a kind of a shock to see a new face in Bull Session. Don't
let it bother you, though .... I may sell the picture to Bromo Seltzer.
It d complete their series of photos .... before, after, and "this product
is not guaranteed."
Well, things haven't been going so well since I said things about Stan-

ford women in BS. But it's surprising how much
homework you can do on Friday and Saturday
nights.
As a matter of fact, I've seen some very attractive
women on campus this fall. Expect to see more
Saturday. Of course, you need a telescope to see
across the stadium. Friend of mine got a periscope
by mistake. Got a letter from him yesterday ....
likes Northwestern very well.

Women, even Stanford women, sometimes pride themselves on their
pass defense. But they seldom come up with something really unique
in the way of thwarting amorous advances. It's usually "But I haven't
read The Report," or "Let's not spoil it," or, worst of all, "Please!"
Last spring, however, the members of a certain women's residence
came up with an astonishing solution to their problems. The problem
was a certain grad biz boy with several libidos (see text, Psych. 51) on
the loose.
Seems the gals all thought he was a helluva nice guy and didn't want
to puncture his ego. But then again, they didn't want it the other way
around. Finally, they discovered that he was one of the song-fest boys
.... would join in and sing at the drop of a hat.
Word got around fast, and the guy ended the quarter in a sad state
of frustration. Every time he closed in to indicate his affection, the guy's
date would start to sing one of the rousing beer-bust songs and he'd
join in. Some guys just never catch on.
Before the women found his weakness, however, one cute little num
ber agreed to go out with him. She didn't believe a word they said about
him. It was 2:30 when she came into the dorm, and"the girls" were
waiting with bated breath. Starry-eyed, the disheveled girl looked at
them and murmured:
"But he's so strong!"

One of our better-known co-eds, a law student, no less, was standing
in front of the Memorial Church a couple of weeks ago, happily puffing
a cigarette. Suddenly, up pops a freshman. "Pardon me, ma'am," he
says, "but there's no smoking on the Quad. It's a tradition, you know."
Kinda startled the poor girl. She put out the cigarette, apologized, and
listened to the frosh's lecture on Farm traditions.
Well, see you next Wednesday. In the meantime, remember . . . .
