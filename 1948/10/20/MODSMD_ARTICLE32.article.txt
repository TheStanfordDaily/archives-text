# Notes from a Padded Cell
## Bottle Fatigue 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
This wine, women, and song is
getting me down. Guess I'll have to
give up singing.
You know the old adage, "Eat,
drink, and be merry—for tomorrow
you may not be able to afford it."
It's actually terrible, really terrible
how the cost of living has gone up
—clear up to $4.18 a quart. Some
poet has even knocked out a verse
commemorating the high prices. He
says it like this:
"This fact obtrudes, whenever I
Feel melancholy's touch:
The curse of liquor, after all,
Is that it costs so much!"
Yes, whenever I consider what
I've spent I'm in no mood to joke.
Last evening I was pleasure bent,
this morning—pleasure broke. The
people in the 19th century really
had the right idea. It fixed all the
problems. The wages of the Eng
lish coal miners paid partly in
beer. They probably had a fine
time and a half.
Drinks Something Awful
I have a friend who drinks some
thing awful. I know, I tasted it. He
keeps tel!ing me that he hates the
sight of liquor all the time, so I
asked him why he drinks it. "To
get it out of sight," Jie replied. Why,
he drinks so much that the other
night on my way home I found him
on the sidewalk drunk as a lord.
I tried to reason with him. "Look,
Rick, it just isn't possible to drink
all the brewery can make. Why
don't you give it up?"
Rick looked at the brewery al)
lighted up and said, "Oh, no, I got
em working nights already."
The theory is that the German
people are the heaviest beer drink
ers. Actually, the English drink
more beer than the Germans. The
Germans drink more hard liquors.
If you want to sectionalize the re
port, we find that Pennsylvania is
the top beer state. A report from
the U.S. Brewers' Foundation in
dicates that the people of that state
have a per capita beer intake of 33
gallons per year. Wisconsin is sec
ond, followed by Nevada, New Jer
sey, and New York.
Indians Have Capacity
But this is nothing really, and I
only say that because it is true. The
Jivaro Indian drinks five quarts of
beer daily—and 20 to 25 quarts on
feast days. That 1825 quarts per year
per person would even keep Ros
sotti's open nights.
Carrying this breakdown on
farther, we find a report from Dr.
Robert Maupin, an official at the
famous Keeley Institute for alco
holics, saying that more farmers
are treated there than all other
groups in different occupations.
Professional men are a close sec
ond, but the odd thing is that they
outnumber bartenders by more
than two to one.
Couldn't Get Drunk
And then there is the story of the
man who couldn't get drunk. Brit
ish Royal Air Force Corporal Paul
West carries a doctor's certificate
which states he cannot become in
toxicated. To confirm the claim of
the certificate once the corporal
drank two quarts of whiskey and
13 pints of beer and remained cold
sober. What a boy to have around
to do the driving!
So the moral of the story is, "If
you want to lead a sober life—bet
ter go to bed early." That's because
recent tests have shown that lack
of sleep produces exactly the same
symptoms as overindulgence, name
ly, lack of muscular co-ordination
and attention, irascibility, and some
times even hallucinations . . . and
it's much cheaper, too.
Theory Was Proved
My buddy Rick has proved this
theory, too. He woke up Sunday
morning after a rather chaotic night
before with one balloon head. I
told him that if hp hadn't drunk so
much he'd be feeling better this
morning.
"Drink had nothing to do with
it,"he moaned. "I went to bed
feeling wonderful and wake up
feeling awful. It was the sleep that
did it."
