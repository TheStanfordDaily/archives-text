## New Lockout Compensations 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to the letter of Messrs. Allen, Steen, Durham, Clough, and
Ames printed in Tuesday's Daily regarding the proposed Demerit Sys
tem, we also would like to make a few suggestions.
To avoid loss of one of Stanford's oldest and most cherished traditions,
we submit the following system to replace the present form of compen
sation for lock-ins:
1 DEMERlT—student receives candy or flowers; 2 DEMERlTS—ac
cused given candy and flowers; 3 DEMERlTS—offender presented with
companions automobile; 4 DEMERlTS—culprit offered engagement ring;
5 DEMERlTS—victim extended proposal of marriage. The last point is
designed to offset to some degree loss of a Stanford diploma due to
suspension from the University.

(Ed. Note: Messrs. Allen, et al, suggested punishments ranging from
imprisonment in the Hoover Tower to scratching eves out with a
rusty stylus.)
