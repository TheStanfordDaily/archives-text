# How About A Quarterly Review?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford is too modest! And this is why.
For years now Stanford students have expressed themselves publicly
through such mediums as The Daily, Chappie, art exhibits, choral work,
and stage productions. For the journalism, art, or music students these
forms of communication are excellent.
But what do we hear from students in the history, biology, language,
political science, or classics departments? What are these students doing
in their fields? How does the student of one department ever discover
what the student from another department is really thinking and doing?
Unfortunately, the University as a whole has no way of knowing the
contributions of students from these less vocal or less publicized fields?
Therefore, in response to the absence of such valuable communication,
I have this suggestion to offer:
Why not publish an annual or quarterly review containing the out
standing written work of students Irom every department in this Uni
versity?
