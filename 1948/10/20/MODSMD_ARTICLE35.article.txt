# Discourteous Telephone Operators
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems to me that telephone operators on campus can use a little
discretion in closing their switchboards at exactly 10:30 p.m Calls which
arc in process at 10:30 should be allowed to be completed within a reason
able time and not cut off sharply. A little courtesy on the part of the
operators here would go a long way to smooth out calls between living
groups on campus.
