# ‘Carmen’ Spine-Jarring Brutal Screen Action
## 
### ALVIN C. BERRY 
The word has spread from tree
top to tree-top, from Enema to the
Row, from Toyon to the Village—
"It's Guild Theater down! Carmen
and cleavage! The bare bust is at
last only as far away as Belts!"
The "word," as usual, is wrong.
As a sex thrill, "Carmen" is not
worth the 90 cents admission. But
for 112 minutes of sheer, spine-jar
ring entertainment, "Carmen" is
one of the biggest sensations to hit
this Peninsula since the Big Game.
Bizet, however, is not having his
day at the Guild Theater this week.
Most theater-goers will be inclined
to feel that Carmen sans the great
operatic music is not Carmen. But
Carmen or no, the Italians have
taken the mediocre opera plot and
have made a forceful, brutal, and
sometimes terrifying movie of it.
Disregard Convention
They have dumped convention;
they have jiggled blouses; they
have taken the glory from violent
death; they have shown ugliness as
a calm, quiet fact; they have taken
the sex and cheese-cake from the
female form and have turned it into
passion. In short, they have turned
out an excellent and somewhat un
usual motion picture.
Vivianc Romance, Italy's chief
celluloid gold mine, is undoubtedly
the best thing that has happened
over there since the Renaissance.
She is undoubtedly one of the five
most beautiful women in flicks; she
is a better actress than 99 44/100ths
per cent of the painted pigs that
the Vine Street boys arc showing.
She also has the most beautiful and
perfect teeth—yes, teeth—this side
of the Pcpsident show.
Movie 'Vicious'
Just as vivacious is the key word
for Viviane Romance, vicious is the
key word for "Carmen." Not once
since T. Edison's folly has a battle
like the knife fight between the
frustrated don Jose and the roaring
Garcia has been flashed on the great
white screen. Garcia died like he
was sick to his stomach; it wasn't
pretty, but it knocked the audience
back on the Guild's mobile seats.
Jean Maraias as don Jose vaguely

over-lamented Rudolph Valentino.
Mostly, however, he is don Jose.
It is a magnificent portrayal of the
disintegration ot a man. First, the
quiet, honorable soldier; then, the
reckless, dashing bandit; and final
ly, the sniveling, shattered coward.
Orchids to Jean as well as the rest
of the cast.
Character Sketches
As a series of character sketches,
"Carmen"' has seldom been excelled
anywhere. Between sketches the
flicks showed a tendency to drag.
Happily, these periods were few,
and the dynamic acting quickly put
the audience back on the edge of
their seats.
"Carmen" is not the best picture
''since the movies learned to talk."
It is not even second best. But it is
good. Its splendid air of simple
brutality makes it a flick worth
seeing, if only to disagree with this
review. And, dear people, you
haven t lived until you've taken a
good look at Miss Romance's teeth.
