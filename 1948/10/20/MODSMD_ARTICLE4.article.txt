# Sex Lecture Delivered By Dr. Whitehorn
## 
### 
Delivering the first of the 1948
Gimbel lectures on sex psychology,
Dr. John C. Whitehorn. psychiatrist
in-chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital,
last night warned a capacity-filled
auditorium here that American cul
ture should place less emphasis on
certain adolescent virtues if they
expect to solve some of their emo
tional problems.
"Many grownups remain through
out their lives at the infantile level
of emotional development, and
many more progress no farther than
early or late adolescence," he said.
"Maudlin self-pity, infantile depen
dency, and the need of affection are
moving forces leading to excesses in
sex behavior."
"Lack of Morale"
Dr. Whitehorn characterized these
excesses as "lack of morale." He said
social displacements, such as occur
during war, frequently reduce a
person to infantile patterns of be
havior.
A personality scale denoting each
level of emotional development was
offered by the psychatrist as a guide
to emotional immaturity. He di
vided the scale into five groups: in
fantile, childish, early adolescent,
late adolescent, and adult.
"Each level of emotional devel
opment should be satisfied," Dr.
Whitehorn stressed. "The child level
should be satisfied in the school as
well as in the home."
For 'Teen Agers
For children and 'teen agers,
"there should be playgrounds as
well as play rights. For grownups,
leaders in industry should try to
give the individual worker a sense
of his own significanceâ€”"lost," he
remarked, "in the age of mechan
ization."
The Gimbel lectures are sponsored
jointly by Stanford and University
of California medical schools.
Dr. Loren R. Chandler, dean of
the Stanford School of Medicine,
introduced the speaker.
