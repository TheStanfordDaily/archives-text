# German Editors Praise Airlift; Say, 'Decision On War Not Ours; We Are Battlefield Only'
## But Criticize U.S. As Too Superficial 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 20 (/P)—Fif- ;
teen German editors and publishers j
are attending a seminar of the l
American Press Institute at Colum
bia University.
These men have nothing but
praise for the Berlin airlift. One of
them, Hans-Norbert Finkel, polit
ical editor of Dena, American
licensed German news agency, ex- I
pressed himself on the subject.
"It was for us the first positive i
evidence that you would perform
what you promised," said Finkel.
Helmut Meyer-Dietrich, chief edi
tor of Ded Tagespiegel (The Daily
Mirror), said Berliners were pre
pared to endure indefinitely the
hardships imposed by limitations of
the airlift supply system.

"We have this saying in Berlin:
'Better freeze another winter here
than spend a lifetime in Siberia'."
"Is it your opinion that the United
States, Britain, and France should
go to war against Russia, if neces
sary, rather than give up Berlin?"
I asked.
"It isn't for us to say whether
you should or shouldn't go to war,"
he said quickly. "We are only the
battlefield."
"This spirit of superficiality," he
said. "Here, if you get an idea, you
try to do something with it fast—
gives it a practical application. You
say, 'Let's try it.'
"In Germany we try first to find
the theory underlying the idea.
The German is bound to ask, "What
lies behind it?' and this is true of
all Europeans."
