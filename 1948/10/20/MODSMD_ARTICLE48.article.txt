# Vow Boys of '33 Stampede Thundering Trojan Herd
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Possibly the briqhtest chapter in Stanford gridiron history
the story of the legendary "Vow Boys" of 1933, '34, and '35. ]
a story about a great USC team, a determined gang of Stanfc
sophomores, and a promise that took three years to keep.
USC had the mightiest aggregation in the country in IS

and 32. The terrible Trojans
. that era rolled up an impress
| string of 27 consecutive vk-toi
and it was the prime ambition
every team 011 the coast to he
first to claim the distinction
j stopping the "Thundering Herd
The boys from Troy flattened
1 Indians by 19 to 0 in 1931. At
1 in 1932 they powered their wa\
; a 13 to 0 victory over .a Stan]
! team which had entered the g;
with a perfect record for the sea
linter the Vow Hoys
Then, early in the flal of 1933,
sophomore members of that yt
Farm grid team made the
which was destined to go dowi
football history. Never again, t
pledged, would USC beat them
the gridiron as long as they tli
selves wore the Stanford Red.
It was a fantastic promise, aii
humorous; and it seemed espec
so after the 33 Cards lost an e
start fo Washington and were
; to a scoreless tie by Northwest
But Stanford did stop the Tr
j winning streak that year, whip
the southerners for the first tin
i seven years by a score of 13
Bobby Grayson's running and \
| ing featured the Cards' vie
though two field goals by
American guard Bill Corbus
vided the winning margin.
El Camitm Traffic Jam
The Farm faithfuls went
when they heard the news Iron
j Angeles, and traffic on E! Ca
was held up for almost two I
that Saturday afternoon as the
\ larious Indian supporters stag
1 tremendous victory celebratioi
I and down the highway.
The 1934 renewal of the
1 classic at Palo Alto was all . c
ford from start to finish. The c
| mighty Thundering Herd mai
to reach the Card 44-yard lint
in the final period; that was
only time Troy pushed bey on
! own 40, and Stanford took the
end of a 16 to 0 count.
Again in 1935 the contest
staged on the Trojans'
! grounds. This was the big om
) game that would make or brca
now-famous "sophomore vow
Most-l ip Scorcs Field Goal
It was a hard-fought, see
i battle all the way, neither
j scoring throughout 59 1 â€¢> minut
I play. Then, with the scorel
reading 30 seconds to no and !
ford in possession on the Tro;
; yard line, "Monk" Moscrip
tempted a difficult field goal
only a few yards inside the si<
! stripe.
With three years of Sta
! hopes riding on the pigskin, j
booted the oval; and delirium 1
loose as the ball split the upi
squarely. The sophomore vow
I complete!
But the Vow Boys did more
whip USC those three years.
1 ing the course of the regular s
they were beaten only twice i
j three years; Stanford repres
I the coast in the Rose Bowl
I time.
