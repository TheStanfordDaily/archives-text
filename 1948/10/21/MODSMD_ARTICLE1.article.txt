SEOUL, Korea, Oct. 21 (AP) —Korean Army forces began to
win back control today of the southern area, ripped by a bloody
revolt described as Communist-led —of possibly 4,000 Korean
troops in the U.S. occupation zone.
Korean Army headquarters in Seoul reported that while the

the seaport of Yosu—focal point of"
the day-old uprising — presumably
was in rebel hands, the larger city
of Sunchon, 20 miles northeast, had
not fallen. Four Korean Army com
panies at Sunchon are intact, a
spokesman said.
Head for Hills
Army sources said it was possible
the main body of insurgents had
taken to the hills northeast of Sun
chon. The spokesman expressed
confidence the small, American
trained army would be able to pre
vent the insurrection from spread
ing.
South Korea was under martial
law. Strong troop and police detach
ments were ordered to the scene of
the revolt which flared up yesterday.
The revolt in the new republic,
iounded only Aug. 13, came as Rus
sia announced it was pulling troops
out of North Korea.
Rebels Not Concentrated
No large rebel force has arrived
at any point whex - e the Korean
Army has concentrated to halt
movements toward Kwanju, capital
of South Cholla Province at the
southwest corner of Korea.
These sources blamed a "Commu
nist cell in the Yosu garrison for
the outbreak. Officials in Seoul did
not regard the uprising as a wide
spread army plot. They said its
army connection seemed to be
merely a "cell" of possibly 40 sol
diers in the Yosu garrison who per
suaded GOO to 800 others to join.
Korean police have estimated the
number of insurgents at 4,000.
