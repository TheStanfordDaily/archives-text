# Excom Views Constitution
## 
### 
A new ASSU constitution will
be completed by early winter quar
ter, Excom member Marianna Olm
stead said at last night's Excom
meeting.
Dratting the actual constitution
will be much easier than revising
the by-laws to conform with the
charters of the various clubs and
organizations, she added. Miss
Olmstead said that McCauley.
Mark Hatfield, and Jack Burdick
will work with her on the consti
tutional revision.
The place of the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard in the new
constitution came under discussion.
This year's Excom holds that the
Honor Code should be applied to
academic work only.
Excom accepted Jerry Dakin's
letter of resignation as NSA chair
man because he was unable to re
turn to Stanford this year.
The ASSU will investigate the
possibility of presenting an enter
tainment program next spring for
the student body. An inquiry will
be sent to the Fred Waring Glee
Club.
