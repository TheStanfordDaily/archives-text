# Even Crothers Men Get Lockouts
## 
### CHUCK SCARLOTT 
It was 2 a.m. Darkness and quiet
enveloped the new Crothers dorm,
for even would-be lawyers must
sleep now and then. Suddenly the
echo of a plaintive knocking brok
the stillness of the corridors.
The Resident Director dragged
himself sleepily to the door and
opened it to see before him a meek
young man, dressed as nature
would have him, shivering in the
doorway. "I've done it again," he
moaned.

Yes, the distraught little man,
having given up his books for the
night and gone to take a shower,
was locked out of his room. For
this he could thank the foresight of
a former Stanford student. Judge
George Crothers.
Among the many innovations
which the Judge, who financed and
to a large extent planned the hall
which bears his name, had installed
in the law dormitory were auto

matic locks. The locks have re
ceived almost unanimous approval,
the sole exception being our friend
of the absent mind, who now hangs
a rope ladder from his window.

Automatic locks, however, are
among the least striking of many
distinctive features. The new dorm
also boasts Venetian blinds, indi
vidual bookcases, hot and cold wa
ter in every room, and—the millen
nium has arrived—inner - spring
mattresses! Most novel of all. of
course, and most loudly acclaimed
is the plan of housing ONE man to
a room. As if this were not enough,
mail is delivered directly to the hall,
where each man has his own box.
Law Library for Hall
Soon to be complete in the base
ment of the building is a law li
brary which will make Crothers
dorm the only hall in the country
with such a facility. Its 6,0000 vol
umes are being donated by Judge
Crothers.

The men of the new hall, many
of whom lived in the Village last
year, are not ungrateful for the
generosity and understanding which
have given them virtually every
thing a student could ask for in a
living unit. When, one day soon
after they had moved in, Judge
Crothers came to see them, he was
met by a spontaneous and sustained
cheer.
Commons Chow Praised
Enthusiasm for their new envi
ronment has carried even to En
cina Commons, where the lawyers
have been praising the food.
The only location complaint was
expressed by a Crothers rough who
remarked, "We're too darn close to
those jerks at Encina, honking and
bellowing all night over to Toyon."
Barring the outbreak of violence
because of this impediment to
studying, the men of Crothers seem
to have embarked upon a produc
tive and. but for Dean Spaeth, lux
