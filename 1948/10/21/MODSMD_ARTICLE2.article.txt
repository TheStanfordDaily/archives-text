## 
### 
Prisciila Pointer added another
personal triumph to her score of
Stanford successes with her por
trayal of Antigone last night in the
Little Theater.
Miss Pointer's beautiful and ex
pressive voice and movements were
completely under her control dur
ing the entire performance. Like
all things truly good, her acting
improves with time.
Mel Ellett, Jane Cannon, and Hal
Todd came close to Miss Pointer
for acting honors. Ellett, who can
usually be counted on for a sound
presentation, stumbled somewhat
during the beginning of the play,
but achieved completely the mix
ture of semi-dignity and stupidity
required by the role. Todd was
wholly the bragging, humdrum
guardsman.
Designer-director Allen Fletcher
created a set which thoroughly fit
ted into the play's feeling of void.
