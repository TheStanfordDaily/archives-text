Last Saturday at Encina Commons, holders of meal tickets
were asked to produce other identification to prove that they
were the rightful owners of the tickets. The reason back of the
embarrassing check-up was that Alf Brandin, University busi
ness manager, didn't want anyone using a friend's ticket. He
had counted on people missing meals when he calculated the
cost of the meal tickets.
The purchasers of the meal tickets don't see it that way. They
paid for a certain number of meals, and it makes no difference
to them who eats the food. Brandin pleads economy. But it
has been a number of these "economy" moves of the business
department in the past which have caused unncessary hard
feelings.
If we had room, we'd quote a dozen for you. But a few will
get across our point.
Last year the University patted itself on the back for serving
a special lunch to returning alumni—for only 65 cents. The
lunch was a repugnant spaghetti concoction. At the same time
the fraternities served spreads of turkey, ham, salads, cakes, etc.
—FREE. And maybe you think there weren't plenty of
moochers.
Again, last ygar, when the health department insisted on uni
form garbage disposal areas for all fraternities, as well as Uni
versity Row houses, Mr. Brandin said he'd have 'em built for
5125. When questioned by fraternity representatives, he ad
mitted he thought he could make enough profit off that figure
to pay for the seven the University would have to build. Two
fraternity men thereupon decided to build the enclosures for SBO,
allowing themselves a salary considerably more generous than
the University pays.
There isn't anyone who's been on campus more than two years
who couldn't quote you similar incidents.
Now, sincerely, we don't like to "get after" Mr. Brandin. We
realize that running a university of Stanford's size is a tough
job. It's difficult to get the work done and make .both ends meet.
But, we want to point out that a little more astute operation
of the business department at times would be in order. Many
of the little "economy" moves gross hardly enough money to
make them worthwhile. Their net value is negative since'they
tend to alienate a lot of potential benefactors of the old Alma
Mater. \
And- while we are on the subject, why does the business
manager?insist on a 7-day meal ticket when there is such a
demand for a 5-day ticket? The Brandin answer is that it is
easier to operate on a 7-day basis. But if the University would
operate on a 6-day basis like the private organizations on cam
pus, they'd get a lot better help. And there isn't anyone'of
college age so helpless he can't eat out one day a week. !

But, we want to point out that a little more astute operation
of the business department at times would be in order. Many
of the little "economy" moves gross hardly enough money to
make them worthwhile. Their net value is negative since'they
tend to alienate a lot of potential benefactors of the old Alma
Mater. \
And- while we are on the subject, why does the business
manager?insist on a 7-day meal ticket when there is such a
demand for a 5-day ticket? The Brandin answer is that it is
easier to operate on a 7-day basis. But if the University would
operate on a 6-day basis like the private organizations on cam
pus, they'd get a lot better help. And there isn't anyone'of
college age so helpless he can't eat out one day a week. !
Last Saturday at Encina Commons, holders of meal tickets
were asked to produce other identification to prove that they
were the rightful owners of the tickets. The reason back of the
embarrassing check-up was that Alf Brandin, University busi
ness manager, didn't want anyone using a friend's ticket. He
had counted on people missing meals when he calculated the
cost of the meal tickets.
The purchasers of the meal tickets don't see it that way. They
paid for a certain number of meals, and it makes no difference
to them who eats the food. Brandin pleads economy. But it
has been a number of these "economy" moves of the business
department in the past which have caused unncessary hard
feelings.
If we had room, we'd quote a dozen for you. But a few will
get across our point.
Last year the University patted itself on the back for serving
a special lunch to returning alumni—for only 65 cents. The
lunch was a repugnant spaghetti concoction. At the same time
the fraternities served spreads of turkey, ham, salads, cakes, etc.
—FREE. And maybe you think there weren't plenty of
moochers.
Again, last ygar, when the health department insisted on uni
form garbage disposal areas for all fraternities, as well as Uni
versity Row houses, Mr. Brandin said he'd have 'em built for
5125. When questioned by fraternity representatives, he ad
mitted he thought he could make enough profit off that figure
to pay for the seven the University would have to build. Two
fraternity men thereupon decided to build the enclosures for SBO,
allowing themselves a salary considerably more generous than
the University pays.
There isn't anyone who's been on campus more than two years
who couldn't quote you similar incidents.
Now, sincerely, we don't like to "get after" Mr. Brandin. We
realize that running a university of Stanford's size is a tough
job. It's difficult to get the work done and make .both ends meet.
