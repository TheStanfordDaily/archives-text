I ran into a choice bit of dialogue at the local fleahouse last Friday in
the course of viewing the Universal-International stinker ' Larceny."
In this scene, John Payne (as far as I'm concerned, his name is John
Pain) walks into a restaurant and makes eyes at the shapely blonde
waitress.
Says she: "Stick around for a few minutes; I'm free after seven."

I wonder how much she charges before seven?

Overheard in the men's locker room:
"Gosh, if we're going to exercise this hard every
day, I'm either going to have to quit drinking beer
or quit this course. I'm the only guy in my class
whose perspiration comes out with a head on it!"

A local socialite whose name is found regularly on
the masthead of the Chappie, wins this week's award
for pulling the prize faux pas in class.
He was doing all right on a test in an advanced

history course until he came to a question asking for the names of some
Roman wars. The only Roman wars he could think of were the Punic
Wars, between Rome and Carthage. So he answered the question by
saying that the conflicts in question were the Punic Wars.
What's funny about that? Well, he had a little trouble spelling one
word. Instead of coming out "Punic," it came out .... just exactly
the way you're thinking it came out.

Don't look now dep't.: Don't look now, but you may be in for a shock
when the "Bawlout" is put on sale about two weeks hence. Unnerstan?
