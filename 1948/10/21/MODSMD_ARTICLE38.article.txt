## Why Movies Were Late 
### 
American humor is a priceless
thing when properly displayed.
While the crowd in the Memorial
Auditorium was sweating out the
UCLA game movies for 30 minutes
last night, the tenseness was bro
ken, appropriately we thought, by
some spirited roughs in the balcony.
They started that moldy old
chant, "We're going to tear down
all the churches." A double quar
tet followed them with "When Har
ry S. Truman gets the gate in '48."
Now about that delay. It certain
ly wasn't the fault of Cardinals.
Hardin Holmes and his boys did
everything possible to get the films
shown and on time.
Fate and a fumbling alumni
group blocked him.
First of all, Cubberley Audito
rium, customary showplace, was
booked. The Memorial Auditorium
was obtained only on the promise
that it would be cleared for the 8
o'clock showing of "Antigone" in
the Little Theater. A rehearsal of
"Othello" in the Memorial Audi
torium waS postponed to accommo
date the Cardinals' movies.
All would have been well if the
alumni had delivered the films on
time as promised. They asked for
the films again yesterday because
all the old grads didn't see the
show on Monday. They promised
Marchie Schwartz they'd have the
films down to Stanford by 6 at the
latest. But, as the large crowd who
went knows, it was 7:30 when the
films arrived.
The alumni had an excuse. The
film broke 10 times in the San
Francisco showing. But, instead of
sending it to Stanford for repair,
they had the Eastman Company fix
it in the city, causing a serious de
lay. It was unforlunate all the way
aroundâ€”but we hope the alumni
will be more considerate in the fu
ture. There were a lot of Stanford
students who wanted to see the
complete movies.
