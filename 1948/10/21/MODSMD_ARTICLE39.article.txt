## Notes from a Padded Cell 
### 
One is only as old as one feels, it
is said. Dr. G. Ward Crampton of
New York, then, wonders why so
many people grow old so soon. Ho
believes that the average person
.should live to be around 120 years
old and have good health until
right -near the end of that time.
lie has discovered that the hu
man body organs age unevenly.
For instance, a 60 - year - old man
may have a 40-year-old heart, a
50-year-old liver, 80-year-old kid
neys, and be trying to live a 30-
year - old life. Actually he finds
that there are seven factors to age:
chronological, anatomical, physio
logical, psychological, pathological,
statistical, and hereditary ages.
Different Ages
This is liable to bring up prob
lems in dealings with our next gen
eration. For instance, an elderly
lady is walking down the street and
stops to talk to a sweet - looking
cherub.
"And how old are you, my little
man?" she queries.
"According to my school exami
nations I have a psychological age
of 10, a moral age of 3, anatomically
I'm 7, mentally I'm 9, but if you
are referring to my chronological
age I'm 8."
See what I mean?
People living in the early iron
and bronze age lived to the ripe old
age of 18. Currently, the average
length of life in the United States
is 65.8 years. Now medical men
are predicting that the 150-year-old
life span is not too far away. Ac
cording to figures compiled by the
federal government, the proportion
of persons 45 and over in the
country's population has risen from
13.1 to more than 26.5 per cent
in the last 80 years. This is ac
counted for by the work being done
in the field of old-age diseases and
effecting their cure.
Long Life
Many historians have accepted as
true claims that various individuals

have lived for generations beyond
the normal span of life. Some of
the most famous are Dragenberg
who lived to 146, Parr to 152, Agha
to 156, Jenkins to 169, and Czarten
to 185.
But wait till the era of the
rocket ship when the people from
the planet Jupiter start coming in
for landings on Earth and then we'll
see some real longevity. A 10-year
old on that planet would be 120
here. That is because the Jupiterian
year is 12 times as long as ours . . .
and those people born on the extra
day in leap year thought they had
it rough!
Would you like to live to be 100?
Well, it's easy. At least that's what
the National Association of Geron
tologists (a two-bit word for stu
dents of old age) of Great Britain
says. It's simple as A, B, C. (a)
Eat garlic, lends, barley, fresh meat,
and lots of fruit, (b) Read comics.
Don't think very much and never
worry, (c) Live amidst pinks and
greens. That's all there is to it.
Western Advantage
If you work in an office in the
country on the Pacific Coast you
have a chance to gain 11 years over
someone who works in a factory in
a city on the East Coast. If we're
learning how to live to be 100 we
can't overlook any bets, so here is
the breakdown. People on the Pa
cific Coast have a life expectancy
of about a year more than those on
the Atlantic seaboard. If you live
in the country you can look for
ward to five years more of life than
a city dweller. Then if you work
in an office instead of a factory you
might add five more years, for that
is the difference between these two.
But always we should remember
that beautiful young people are ac
cidents of nature . . . while beauti
ful old people are works of art.
Wouldn't it be awful if we were
born old and had to look forward
to growing young, green, and silly?
Yet the thing that most people
dread about their past is its length.

People living in the early iron

Long Life
Many historians have accepted as
true claims that various individuals

have lived for generations beyond
the normal span of life. Some of
the most famous are Dragenberg
who lived to 146, Parr to 152, Agha
to 156, Jenkins to 169, and Czarten

But wait till the era of the
rocket ship when the people from
the planet Jupiter start coming in
for landings on Earth and then we'll
see some real longevity. A 10-year
old on that planet would be 120
here. That is because the Jupiterian
year is 12 times as long as ours . . .
and those people born on the extra
day in leap year thought they had
it rough!
Would you like to live to be 100?
Well, it's easy. At least that's what
the National Association of Geron
tologists (a two-bit word for stu
dents of old age) of Great Britain
says. It's simple as A, B, C. (a)
Eat garlic, lends, barley, fresh meat,
and lots of fruit, (b) Read comics.
Don't think very much and never
worry, (c) Live amidst pinks and
greens. That's all there is to it.
Western Advantage
If you work in an office in the
country on the Pacific Coast you
have a chance to gain 11 years over
someone who works in a factory in
a city on the East Coast. If we're
learning how to live to be 100 we
can't overlook any bets, so here is
the breakdown. People on the Pa
cific Coast have a life expectancy
of about a year more than those on
the Atlantic seaboard. If you live
in the country you can look for
ward to five years more of life than
a city dweller. Then if you work
in an office instead of a factory you
might add five more years, for that
is the difference between these two.
But always we should remember
that beautiful young people are ac

Wouldn't it be awful if we were

Yet the thing that most people
dread about their past is its length.
One is only as old as one feels, it

to 185.
But wait till the era of the
rocket ship when the people from
the planet Jupiter start coming in
for landings on Earth and then we'll
see some real longevity. A 10-year
old on that planet would be 120
here. That is because the Jupiterian
year is 12 times as long as ours . . .
and those people born on the extra
day in leap year thought they had
it rough!
Would you like to live to be 100?
Well, it's easy. At least that's what
the National Association of Geron
tologists (a two-bit word for stu
dents of old age) of Great Britain
says. It's simple as A, B, C. (a)
Eat garlic, lends, barley, fresh meat,
and lots of fruit, (b) Read comics.
Don't think very much and never
worry, (c) Live amidst pinks and
greens. That's all there is to it.
Western Advantage
If you work in an office in the
country on the Pacific Coast you
have a chance to gain 11 years over
someone who works in a factory in
a city on the East Coast. If we're
learning how to live to be 100 we
can't overlook any bets, so here is
the breakdown. People on the Pa
cific Coast have a life expectancy
of about a year more than those on
the Atlantic seaboard. If you live
in the country you can look for
ward to five years more of life than
a city dweller. Then if you work
in an office instead of a factory you
might add five more years, for that
is the difference between these two.
But always we should remember
that beautiful young people are ac
cidents of nature . . . while beauti
ful old people are works of art.
Wouldn't it be awful if we were
born old and had to look forward
to growing young, green, and silly?
Yet the thing that most people
dread about their past is its length.
One is only as old as one feels, it
is said. Dr. G. Ward Crampton of
New York, then, wonders why so
many people grow old so soon. Ho
believes that the average person
.should live to be around 120 years
old and have good health until
right -near the end of that time.
lie has discovered that the hu
man body organs age unevenly.
For instance, a 60 - year - old man
may have a 40-year-old heart, a
50-year-old liver, 80-year-old kid
neys, and be trying to live a 30-
year - old life. Actually he finds
that there are seven factors to age:
chronological, anatomical, physio
logical, psychological, pathological,
statistical, and hereditary ages.
Different Ages
This is liable to bring up prob
lems in dealings with our next gen
eration. For instance, an elderly
lady is walking down the street and
stops to talk to a sweet - looking
cherub.
"And how old are you, my little
man?" she queries.
"According to my school exami
nations I have a psychological age
of 10, a moral age of 3, anatomically
I'm 7, mentally I'm 9, but if you
are referring to my chronological
age I'm 8."
See what I mean?
People living in the early iron
and bronze age lived to the ripe old
age of 18. Currently, the average
length of life in the United States
is 65.8 years. Now medical men
are predicting that the 150-year-old
life span is not too far away. Ac
cording to figures compiled by the
federal government, the proportion
of persons 45 and over in the
country's population has risen from
13.1 to more than 26.5 per cent
in the last 80 years. This is ac
counted for by the work being done
in the field of old-age diseases and
effecting their cure.
Long Life
Many historians have accepted as
true claims that various individuals

have lived for generations beyond
the normal span of life. Some of
the most famous are Dragenberg
who lived to 146, Parr to 152, Agha
to 156, Jenkins to 169, and Czarten
to 185.
