After UCLA's banner made its
way into the Stanford dressing
room last Saturday, it was stuffed
into a dufflebag and plied among
others containing grid suits, where
it lay while an LA cop quizzed
bystanders. Soon after, a Card
football manager popped into the
room and almost blew the place of
concealment wide open when he
innoccntly suggested to the officer
that the Bruin prize had been
stuffed into one of the dunnage
bags. P.S. The cop ignored the
suggestion.

Students who moan about cold
mornings on the Farm these days
should consider the plight of Sigma
Chi's Bill Street. Bill, who took a
summer job in Alaska, hasn't re
turned to his Alma Mater yet. He's
snowbound somewhere in the wilds
of the Yukon country.

The ROTC's new band almost
broke up a straight-faced mass for
mation Tuesday while the entire
unit was practicing for the visit of
General Mark Clark next week. To

herald the approach of the inspect
ing officer, the trumpets and drums
broke into what sounded like a
German band rendition of the
"Missouri Waltz." (If Clark's a Re
publican, faces will be redder next
week.)

Valerie La Breche, who lived at
Lagunita last year before she re
ceived her sheepskin, had her pic
ture flashed across the wires of the
Associated Press last week. Va
lerie was one of two airline stew
ardesses who planted a multitude
of lipstick marks upon a bewildered
"Abe" Lincoln of Oakland, the two
millionth customer to pass through
the portals of the Los Angeles Mu
nicipal Airport.

Roughs visiting the local 3.2 es
tablishments came away seeing a
different type of illusion as school
began this quarter. Anticipating
the increase in brew trade in this
area, Alcoholics Anonymous got an
early start on their fall campaign
by plastering sighs up in the vi
cinity of the campus.
