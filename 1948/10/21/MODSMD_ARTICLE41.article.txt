## In Defense of Carmen 
### 
To the Editor:
In regard to "Carmen," may I correct a false impression in the minds
of many. "Carmen" is not an Italian film, but French. It was made by
a French company in Italy in 1943, and the dialogue was originally in
French. In its present state, the film has had its French soundtrack
taken off, and Italian voices dubbed in.
I would also like to defend the work. Other than the more blatant
aspects, "Carmen" has a great deal to offer to the intelligent movie-goer.
Jean Marais (don Jose) is one of Europe's leading actors; Lucicn Coedel
(One-eye) is one of France's great; and what Hollywood beauty com
mands the acting ability of Viviane Romance?
The film is also noteworthy for its respect of the original novel, and
the capturing of Spanish atmosphere is outstanding. llow many American
films are able to show the dirt and glamor of Spain in one sweep?
What Hollywood producer would bother to clothe his leading protagonists
in such mundane clothes as these French stars wear?
In addition to its technical merits, "Carmen" impressed me favorably
as just a good show. It ranged from the superb duel between don Jose
and One-eye to the brilliant repartee between Carmen and her admirers.
The photography was not quite up to our standards, but the film was
made in full sunlight and under wartime conditions.
