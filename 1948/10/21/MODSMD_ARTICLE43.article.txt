## 
### JOHN SUTTHOFF 
Yes, I like the United States,
s, Stanford is a fine place. Yes.
lerican girls are pretty. Yes
[his string of affirmative answers
only part of the .repertoire which
b Van Dijl. 25, has committed to
rnory as self defence since his
ivr.l on campus from The Neth
ands. Van Dijl is one of seven
ropean students now attending
mford under auspices of the
SU Foreign Scholarship Plan,
"he plan, which was inaugurated
s year after two years prepara
l, chooses student leaders from
ious foreign countries and pro
es them with tuition, travel ex
lses, and room and board.
Service Career
'reparing for a- possible career in
Dutch foreign service, Van Dijl
â€¢nds most of his classroom time
ing political science. A graduate
Utrecht University, "the Stan
d or Harvard of my country," he
ns to return there next year to
his doctor's degree in law.
Vt a loss for relatives in this
intiy, Bob has found his room
te. Ed Pipe, in the Alpha Sigma
i house to be "like a big brother
me." "Everyone is friendly, but
y always ask me 'Do you like
lerica?' When I say 'yes,' they
lk away smiling."
Tennis and Study
)ccasionally finding time to play
nis, Bob finds most of his time
oted to studying. "Athletics are
ectly sponsored by the university,
hockey and crew teams are
anized by the campus clubs." "I
.'e seen Stanford play both Ore
i and Santa Clara this fall," he
ttinued, "but I am told I have

yet to see a football game."
Displaying u knowledge of Stan
ford womanhood. Van Dijl remarked
that they "look nice and dress well."
However, he couldn't reconcile him
self to those ''17-year-old kids act
ing as sophisticated as old women."
American music doesn't seem to
have any rhythm to it, and as for
dancing he sagely observed. "It is
more like hugging your girl here."
"Kissing Jim?"
His curiosity aroused by the pres
ent presidential campaign he found
"the man who is elected will be the
one who kisses the most babies and
must successfully applies to the
favor of the people. Executive abil
ity and administrative capacity
seem to be overlooked."
At the termination of his schol
arship next June, Van Dijl will le
turn to Rotterdam where he has
lived the past 25 years.
