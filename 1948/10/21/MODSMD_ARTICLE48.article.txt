# Trojans Lead Card In Grid Series
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's biggest bugaboo in
football, the team toughest for the
Tribe to handle throughout the
years, the Terrible Trojans, will i
waltz into Stanford Stadium Sat- J
urday afternoon to do battle with ;
the Indians for the 29th time.
Troy, located not in Turkey but j
next to Phelps-Terkel and Currie's i
Ice Cream Parlor off Figueroa J
Street, holds a one-game edge over
the local gridders. having been top
dog 14 times, while Stanford has
won 13 times.
The only tie was played in 1927. :
and was a 13 to 13 affair that Stan- j
ford managed to pull out of the fire |
in the dying moments of the game.
Almost every contest in the 29- *
game series has been well worth !

the price of admission. It was
against the Trojans that the famous
vow of the Vow Boys came into
being. And it was against USC that
the Wow Boys demonstrated that
they real'y were Rose Bowl caliber
m beating the defending champs,
21 to 7. That was in 194 U.
Taylor a Thief
Chuck Taylor pulled off the neat
est bit of thievery that ever oc
curred anywhere when, in '42, he
swiped the ball from Trojan flash
Mickey McCardle and dashed 40
some odd yards to a touchdown and
a Stanford victory, 14 to 6.
That called for a vow on the
part of the humiliated McCardle,
who said that he would come back
to the Stadium with another SC
team and make up for that tragedy.

He did it too, when USC stormed
into Palo Alto in 194(1.
That "4(J game was one of the all
time thrillers of the series. Stan
ford, Lloyd Merriman, and Bobby
Anderson boomed to an early lead,
only to have USC's power come
back to overwhelm the Indians in
the final quarter, 28 to 20.
Bad Boys Held Oil'
Stanford was supposed to have
gained a moral victory over the
big bad Trojans of last year, when
they went down to the Coliseum as
despised underdogs, and held the
homebreds to a short 14 to 0 score.
That was the day that George Quist
broke the Trojan line into bits in a
snigle-handed goal-line stand.
Other Stanford names that stand
out in the series include those of
Pete Fay rnd Doc Luckett, who
teamed up to give Stanford an up
set 7 to 6 win in 1937.
And git test of all individual ef
forts was turned in by Monk Mos
crip when he booted a last-second
field goal to give the Cards a 3 to 0
win in 1935 and bring an end to the
perfect vow.
And now the 1948 game is coming
up. Stanford can get past the Cra
vath-taught Trojans and even up
the 29-gaine ledger if they play a
repeat ball game to last Saturday's
tune-up.

m beating the defending champs,
21 to 7. That was in 194 U.
Taylor a Thief
Chuck Taylor pulled off the neat
est bit of thievery that ever oc
curred anywhere when, in '42, he
swiped the ball from Trojan flash
Mickey McCardle and dashed 40
some odd yards to a touchdown and
a Stanford victory, 14 to 6.
That called for a vow on the
part of the humiliated McCardle,
who said that he would come back
to the Stadium with another SC
team and make up for that tragedy.

He did it too, when USC stormed
into Palo Alto in 194(1.
That "4(J game was one of the all
time thrillers of the series. Stan
ford, Lloyd Merriman, and Bobby
Anderson boomed to an early lead,
only to have USC's power come
back to overwhelm the Indians in
the final quarter, 28 to 20.
Bad Boys Held Oil'
Stanford was supposed to have
gained a moral victory over the
big bad Trojans of last year, when
they went down to the Coliseum as
despised underdogs, and held the
homebreds to a short 14 to 0 score.
That was the day that George Quist
broke the Trojan line into bits in a
snigle-handed goal-line stand.
Other Stanford names that stand
out in the series include those of
Pete Fay rnd Doc Luckett, who
teamed up to give Stanford an up
set 7 to 6 win in 1937.
And git test of all individual ef
forts was turned in by Monk Mos
crip when he booted a last-second
field goal to give the Cards a 3 to 0
win in 1935 and bring an end to the
perfect vow.
And now the 1948 game is coming
up. Stanford can get past the Cra
vath-taught Trojans and even up
the 29-gaine ledger if they play a
repeat ball game to last Saturday's
tune-up.
Stanford's biggest bugaboo in
football, the team toughest for the
Tribe to handle throughout the
years, the Terrible Trojans, will i
waltz into Stanford Stadium Sat- J
urday afternoon to do battle with ;
the Indians for the 29th time.
Troy, located not in Turkey but j
next to Phelps-Terkel and Currie's i
Ice Cream Parlor off Figueroa J

the local gridders. having been top

won 13 times.
The only tie was played in 1927. :
and was a 13 to 13 affair that Stan- j
ford managed to pull out of the fire |
in the dying moments of the game.
Almost every contest in the 29- *
game series has been well worth !

the price of admission. It was
against the Trojans that the famous
vow of the Vow Boys came into
being. And it was against USC that
the Wow Boys demonstrated that
they real'y were Rose Bowl caliber
