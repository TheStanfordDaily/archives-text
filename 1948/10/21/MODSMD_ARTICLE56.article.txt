## 
### 
LOS ANGELES,' Oct. 20. â€” All-
American candidate Jackie Jensen
of the University of California took
over the top spot in Pacific Coast
Conference total offense this week
and at the same time widened his
lead in Conference rushing to over
100 yards ahead of his nearest com
petitor.
The Bear fullback ran and passed
for 169 yards against the Oregon
State Beavers last Saturday to give
him a total of 587 yards gained in
live games. Don Samuel of OSC,
last week's total offense leader,
slipped to third place as Ray Nagel
of UCLA also moved ahead of him.
Nagel's 578 total leaves him within
striking distance of Jensen.
The statistics released by the
Conference Commissioner's office
show that Jensen has gained 494
yards on the ground in 44 attempts
tor an 11.2-yard average. Oregon's
John McKay, number two rusher
in the league, was unable to play
against Southern California last
weekend and so covdd not increase
his 385-yard total.
Norm Van Broklin and Nagel, the
PCC's ranking passers, pulled far
ther ahead of the field in the mat
ter of passes completed.
