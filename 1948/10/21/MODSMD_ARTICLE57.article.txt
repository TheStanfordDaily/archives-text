# Homecoming Features 'Fall of Troy' Theme
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The race for prizes has already
started as campus living groups are
working on the decorations which
are to brighten up the Farm during
Homecoming Weekend.
Some houses will carry the baton
together in an effort to sweep the
house decoration contest. Among
these are the Chi Psis and Jordan
House, the Theta Chis and Durand
House. Delta Upsilon and Lathrop
House, and Roth and Guthrie
Houses. Lagunita and Branner will
show their spikes to the field with
out outside help or coaching.
Greek, Trojan Legend
Onlookers to the "Big Meet"
should keep their eyes open so they
won't miss the leading contenders
for the cups and trophies, accord
ing to Dick Reinhardt, chairman of
house decorations.
"The "Fall of Troy" will probably
be the most pertinent theme. Others

such as "Mount Olympus," "Bac
chus Squeezing Grapes," and "Syb
il's Prediction" will revert to the
ancient Greek and Trojan legends.
"Comic Strips" and "Indians Bear
ing Gifts" will be elaborate decora
tions also. Coach Schwartz won't be
forgotten in the competition when
"Marchie's Mortuary" is portrayed.
Unified Plan
Last year's homecoming decora
tions, it will be remembered, did
not have any unifying theme as do
the 1948 plans. Students will recall
the Theta Delt "Marchie's Used Car
Lot" which grabbed first place hon
ors in last fall's competition. Other
fine decorations were the Fijis' card
stunts, the Phi Delts' giant football
player, and Sigma Chi's "Daily
Front Page."
The trophies will go to the win
ners of the men's and women's com
petitions, while the cups will be
awarded to runners-up.
