### 
At an all-campus assembly yes
tenlayV commemorating United Na
tions' Week, two Stanford students
talked before members of the Fres
no State College student body and
faculty.
Howard Lockwood, Farm senior
and U.S. intern at the United Na
tions internship program at Lake
success during the summer, report
ed on his experiences in this pro
gram.
Erskine Childers, Stanford stu
dent, chairman of the California-
Nevada-Hawaii Region, and mem
ber of the National Executive Com
mittee of the National Students' As
sociation, spoke on the role of the
United States student in the United
Nations.
"The crying need at the Paris
session of the UN at this moment,"
he said, "is for the U.S. to demon
strate a firm and reliable foreign
policy in which the peoples of the
United Nations, caught between the
East-West conflict, can place faith
and hope."
"Such a foreign policy can only
result from wise and experienced
statesmanship at Washington; but
this must be supplemented by an
alert and well-informed American
citizenry," Childers stated. "In
preparation now for full citizenship
in the very near future, the U.S.
student community has a unique
opportunity to insure the constancy
of objective so often missing in U.S.
international conduct today."
