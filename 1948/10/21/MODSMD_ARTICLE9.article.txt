# 800 Join YWCA In Recent Drive
## 
### 
Over 800 women joined the YWCA
during the fall membership drive
last week, announced YWCA Presi
dent Sally Brown yesterday. The
final results released today show
that 61 per cent of the women on
campus support the YWCA.
Special mention for 100 per cent
membership goes to Casa Naranja
of Lagunita. Diane Worth, who did
the soliciting, was the only girl to
turn in a perfect house turnout.
All girls who solicited for the
drive will be the YWCA contacts
in their respective houses. One job
of the representatives will be to dis
tribute the YWCA bulletin, the
"Live-wire," at house meetings on
Monday night.
