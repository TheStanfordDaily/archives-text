# Campus Election Candidates Must File by Next Thursday
## 
### 
Candidates for the nine open stu- i
I dent offices to be tilled in the com- j
! ing all-campus elections must turn j
'in their formal nominations next j
| week between Monday morning j
and Thursday night, according to
John Marin, Election BoaVd chair
man. Friday will be the last day
for declinations, Marin added.
Primary, balloting will take place
on Nov. 3, with final voting on the
10th.
Nomination boxes will be placed
on Quad at the History and Engi
i neering corners. An estimate of
I each candidate's campaign expen
ditures must be turned in with his
nomination this year, according to
Cliff Carlson, campaign expendi
tures chairman. A maximum of $10
is allowed for electioneering, and
campaign materials available to one
candidate, exclusively, are not al
lowed. Violators of the expendi
ture code run the risk of being dis
qualified, Carlson stated.

Heading the list of offices to be
filled is that of senior class presi
dent, which was vacated last spring
when he was forced to withdraw
from school on account of illness.
Ness, back at Stanford this quarter,
has not yet announced whether he
intends to run for the office again.
Four i'rosh officers — president,
secretary-treasurer, Exconi 8 (En
cina), and Exeom 9 (Roble) —will
be filled by freshmen during the
balloting. As usual a large, turn
out of '52 candidates is expected.
Any freshman with 29 or less units
is eligible to run for the frosh of
fices.
Indians living in Exconi Districts
1 (off-campus) and 2 (women's
Row) will also select new repre
[ sentatives at the polls.
A seat on Men's Council until the
[ winter quarter elections and a po
sition on the Stanford Athletic
Council must also be filled in the
November elections.
