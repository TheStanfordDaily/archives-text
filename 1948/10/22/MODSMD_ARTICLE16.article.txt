### GORDON ADDISON 
The ATO fraternity men have
gone "hog wild" over their dance
publicize their "ham hop" at Man
| gini's, they have loosed a small
i brown sow from its 592 Mayfield
| sty.
The animal has been accompanied
! by a red wagon and two equally
I red-faced pledges who carry a red
bucket. On this tin depository are
printed the letters P.S.—the after
thought. "Peaches," as the swine
is affectionately called, bore a sign
yesterday which read, "Bring ins
sister to the ATO Hog Wallow. 1
The pledges added that Peaches
doesn't have a date yet for Friday
night but has already engaged a
pigmate for the Saturday Hog Wal
low.
Yesterday morning the swine
keepers were kept busy tending
their squealing charge. About 10
a.m. the pig decided to hoof it for
a while, but when her dainty toes
touched the cement in front of the
Cellar, she balked. "Peaches" would
not move. One of the pledges paged
a farmer in the crowd. One fellow
stepped up, stretched piggy's tail,
and gave it a sharp twist. "Peaches"
and boys went running down the
street.
Shortly before noon, the touring
; pig was given a "rest stop" in front
of the Education Building. After
J the sponge and shovel treatment
I had ended, the trio moved on for
lunch at the ranch house.
"Peaches" came to the ATO chap
j ter via a noisy San Jose auction. At
I first no one would house the prob
lem child. Finally the Resident As
sistant, a psychology major, con
sented to "bed her up" as his guest
and everyone was happy.
