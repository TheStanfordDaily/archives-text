"I think Bernadotte's death is
really tragic. I've been reading his
reports to the UN, which are per
fect representations of patience and
an effort to understand all sides of
the problem. I'm sure that if we
could all follow the example he has
set, we would be many steps closer
to everlasting peace.
"Also I've thought a little, very
little as it seems so fur away right
now, of going into the UN army
or police force if it ever becomes
a reality. As much as I hate the
military, I believe so strongly in
such a force that it would be a
strong temptation."—T. M. S.
