# Cardinals' Dance
## 
### 
Undergoing a complete transfor
mation, the Pavilion will become a
Grecian temple tonight as Farm and
USC students glide by murals and
Greek columns at the Homecoming
dance. Leighton Noble will provide
music for the Cardinal-sponsored
affair.
Noble, who is currently playing at
the Garden Room of the Claremont
Hotel in Berkeley, both sings and
plays the piano in addition to lead
ing the orchestra.
Tickets for the dance may be ob
tained today at the Cellar, the main
library, and on Quad for $3.60 per
couple. They will also be on sale
at the door for those who failed to
purchase them earlier in the week,
announced Joyce Oldham and Ron
Handel, dance co-chairmen.
Although decorations will carry
out the Homecoming theme of an
cient Greece, the swing from Noble
will be smooth and modern to pro
vide a relaxing mood for the open
ing gun of a big weekend of fun
and festivities.
Forgetting their worries about the
outcome of tomorrow's football
game. Trojan and Indian rooters will
dance to Noble's smooth music under
a ceiling of clouds, with indirect
lighting emanating from the Gre
cian columns.
Dress for the occasion will be in
formal.
