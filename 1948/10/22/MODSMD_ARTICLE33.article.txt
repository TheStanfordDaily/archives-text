(Ed. Note: You have just read
thr preamble to the National Stu
dent Association Con s t i t u t i on.
Stanford is a member of the as
sociation and therefore the NSA
constitution applies to every
Farm student.
Last Monday, The Daily pre
sented a brief sketch of the back
ground of this organization.
Starting today, The Daily will tell
the story of how the NSA has
implemented the idea started in
the Preamble.)
"To promote international under
tanding .... Tjhe international
'ork of the NSA has been one of
le most active of branches in the
ssociation.
The NSA Committee at Massa
lusetts Institute of Technology
rought 65 students from 15 West
n and Eastern Europena countries

to the U.S. for a 12-week summer
sesion. All student expenses were '
paid by the NSA.
Smith College in Massachusetts
brought 20 students from Europe
and took them on a tour of the
United States. The foreign students |
stayed in American homes, when
ever possible with students, and
saw first hand, what American life
is like.
These students assembled during I
the last week of August at the Na
tional Congress of the NSA in Madi
son, Wis., where they met and talked
with American students from every i
state in the Union.
American students also profited
from the program of the NSA.
Last spring, the NSA distributed
9.000 copies of a booklet giving
complete information on travel,
living accommodations, and col-

leges in Europe. Co-operating
with the U.S. Maritime Commis
sion and other student organiza
tions. the NSA arranged for spe
cial student ship service at re
duced costs.
Using these ships, NSA arranged
a complete study tour of Britain,
France, and Holland for 90 U.S. stu
dents, two of whom were from Stan
ford. Through NSA information
services several hundred other stu
dents were encouraged to travel
abroad for study, work camps, and
hostel tours during the summer.
But NSA is not working in the
pastâ€”its international program for
the future would alone fill many
columns of newspaper type. High
lighting their plans for the coming
year will be a more comprehensive
booklet with complete details for
summer travel.
