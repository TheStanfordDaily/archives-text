Welcome back to the Farm. As the Spanish say, "Esta Usted
en su casa."
The present student body is happy to see you. And it is sin
cerely proud of you, too. Just a few days ago one of our staff
writers was provoked by an easterner who asked, "Stanford,
what's thai?"—the standard snub for the West. The writer re
plied, asking how come these easterners had heard of states
men like Hoover and McNary; writers like Steinbeck, Anderson,
Nordoff, and Bliven; educators like Wilbur, Jordan, and Terman;
and athletes like Nevers, Schroeder, Albert, and Luisetti; heard
of ail these people and still not heard of Stanford?
Stanford's greatest distinction, as any great university's, is
not in its schools and libraries, but in the number and quality
of successful men and women among its alumni.
And famous or not, old or young, we're glad to have you drop
in on us—anytime—but especially on Homecoming Weekend.
While renewing your acquaintance with the Alma Mater, you
should have a good time. Cardinals and other student organiza
:ions have worked hard to make this the biggest Homecoming
ever. There's a big dance after the rally tonight, and many open
nouses after the game tomorrow. Make yourself at home.
You'll notice some changes are being made. Judge Crolhers
will dedicate the new law dorm he gave to Stanford tomorrow
morning. Stern Hall is under construction. The old Adminis
tration Building is being converted into the new Law School.
But mainly it's the same old Farm and the same old Stan
:ord spirit. And if the team doesn't perform like the Vow and
Wow boys tomorrow, it isn't because they're not trying. They'll
be out on the field to win for you, too.
