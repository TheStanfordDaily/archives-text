In yesterday's colyum wo mentioned that this year's "Bawlout" may
shock some of ihe natives when it is released two weeks hence. Obviously
this coy little item can mean only one thing. But if you haven't already !
guessed what it is, I shall be happy to share the awful truth with you.
Once again the "Eawloui" is going to be just what its name says, a !

bawlout ot everybody s scholastic standing. In other j
words, after your name will be listed the number |
of units you have completed and the amount which '
you are plus or minus.
Many of the current crop of Stanford students
have never seen a "Bwiout" which contained this
somewhat embarrassing information. Leave me hasted
to assure you that the booklet provides a great num
ber of laughs and no little amount of information
about your friends.
The most obvious advantage of the "Bawlout" in i

"his form is, of course, that it allows you to check on the scholastic stand
ings of members of the opposite sex. (You should pardon the expression.)
A low grade average is usually a good .sign that your prospective date
:s a party timer, while a high scholastic average probably means that
your prospective date will remain just that .... a prospective date.
t With the pool of information provided by combining the facts in the
Bawlout with the pictures in the Quad, it is expected that the number
of people having heart attacks upon seeing their blind dates will be
materially reduced.

I am wondering why the ATO's wont to all the trouble of calling their
Saturday night dance "The Hog Wallow." If all the girls I know around
.leie (at last count, there were two) are typical, every dance held at
Stanford is a hog wallow. (Yes. girls, I know the female of the hog family
is called a "sow," but I was having trouble making a joke out of that
word.)
