# Popularity For Britain
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
Never in five centuries has Brit
ain enjoyed the popularity and re
spect that the Western European
nations hold for her today.
How could it be possible for this
war-ruined country to attain more
prestige than the prosperous, con
quering Victorian Empire? There is
on'y one answer: for the first time
in her history Britain is now a per
manent part of Europe. Long-es
tablished curtains of prejudice have
disappeared between the continent
and what was once "the island."
And when curtains are lifted, peo
ple of both sides get along much
better.

This result we owe to Hitler. When
in the mild autumn of 1940 German

planes put ev
ery English vil
lage to fire and
sword, the peo
ple of the island
suddenly real
ized that not
only Poland,
Norway, and
Trance were at
stake, but also
their own free
dom as British

citizens. From that lime on, every
one was on the same boat.
Every day—the whole clay—and
every night — the whole night —
British homes were bombed by
Goering's planes operating from
nearby continental airdromes. Far
from being terrorized as the Nazis
wished it, the British undertook to
stick to it, convinced that, should
they give up, they would share the
rest of Europe's fate: bondage.
At the same time, this "blitz"
fight of 1940-41 was the only faint
glimmer of hope for the people of
occupied Europe. Many began to
work underground, and the battle
for Britain became their battle. All
through those gloomy days, the
voice of the BBC represented the
single link between two worlds —
the free and the enslaved—but still
the very same Europe.
A Common Experience
Then came the happy days when
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and
Norway could cheer their libera
tors. Or the last months of the war
when buzz - bombs and rockets
poured down equally on London
and on the Belgian towns of Ant
werp and Liege. All that belongs
to a common experience that lew
will ever forget on either side of
the North Sea.
The post-war years showed that
victorious Great Britain was no
better oil than the liberated conti
nental nations: scarcity of food, in
flation. lack of raw material in the
factories, manpower shortage in re
gard to problems of housing and
reconstruction.
Born in Misfortune
Born in the misfortune, a new
community had emerged, and at the
most various levels each country
helped the other with no idea of
selfish motives. Hungry England
sent wheat to France while the war
children of Belgium gave up their
dolls and toys for the boys and girls
of Britain.
British tourists came back to the
continent as in the good, old, pre
war years. But they were no long
er the wealthy, haughty people Eu
rope used to know. The Englanders
of today were poor: i'2s ($100) to
spend on a whole vacation.
Race Between Students
In return, continental students
went to Britain in crowds never
seen before. It was like a race
between the students who wanted
to see and ask about everything
and the British who attempted to
anticipate the proper answers. At
Cambridge this summer, the writer
witnessed the hearty, beneficial, and
intellectual intercourse between
students from 28 nations and Eng
lish professors who never failed to
tell frankly the facts about Great
Britain's attitudes and policies,
however unfavorable for her re
nown they may have been.
Stalin is now adding the finishing
touches to the work begun by Hit
ler. Before looking to far-away
America, the small nations of West
ern Europe, threatened by a new
imperialism, rely on Britain, their
faithful ally.
