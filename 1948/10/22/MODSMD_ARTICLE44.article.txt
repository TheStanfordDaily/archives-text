## Notes from a Padded Cell 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
I hate mornings . . . they're so
early. Especially Mondays. On
Mondays nothing goes right.
For instance, last Monday I got
a new roommate. This character
pretties up so he can hash at Lagu
nita. He gets up so early it's still
dark out. I don t really know what
.sort of a fellow he is, but when
he bumped his head on a chair in
the dark he said something that
sounded like, "Oh, the perversity of
inanimate objects!" Possibly he is
just learning self-control over there
at Lagunita, though.
One of the other boys asked me.
"What's your new roommate like?"
And I had to tell him truthfully,
"About everything I own."
Then I went to class and the prof
called a test. "This test will be
conducted under the Stanford Hon
or Code. Please sit three seats apart
in alternate rows."
It was still early in the morning,
so I had to ask the date.
"Never mind the date, finish the
ex:im," said he.
"OK, said I."I just wanted to
have something right on my paper."
Oh. well, flunk now. Avoid the De
cember rush.
I remember a sayinq: "A fool can

ask more questions than a wise man
can answer." That's probably why
everyone is flunking his old exams.
There are other ways to get a
diploma, anyhow. You can study
hard ... or you can marry the
dean's daughter, il' he had a daugh
ter.
I thought there was going to be
one bright spot in last Monday,
though. The prof handed back my
English theme with the remark to
the whoje class, "This is the best
paper in the class." And life was
rosy again. "Yes," he continued,
"watermarked bond." Personally, I
think he's too cynical. He's on-.' of
those boys who think that school is
just full of eager pupils—those ca
per to work, and those eager to let.
them.
What a day! And besides all that,
it started to rain —in California!
But I just thought how nice it
would be at night to get out of
those wet clothes and into a dry
martini.
Guess I'll hang my close on this
line and hit the .sack early so I can
get up bright in the a.m. I'll need
it, because I hate mornings. They're
so early. Especially Fridays. On
Fridays nothing goes right.

What a day! And besides all that,
it started to rain —in California!
But I just thought how nice it
would be at night to get out of
those wet clothes and into a dry
martini.
Guess I'll hang my close on this
line and hit the .sack early so I can
get up bright in the a.m. I'll need
it, because I hate mornings. They're
so early. Especially Fridays. On
Fridays nothing goes right.
I hate mornings . . . they're so
early. Especially Mondays. On
Mondays nothing goes right.
For instance, last Monday I got
a new roommate. This character
pretties up so he can hash at Lagu
nita. He gets up so early it's still
dark out. I don t really know what
.sort of a fellow he is, but when
he bumped his head on a chair in
the dark he said something that
sounded like, "Oh, the perversity of
inanimate objects!" Possibly he is
just learning self-control over there
at Lagunita, though.
One of the other boys asked me.
"What's your new roommate like?"
And I had to tell him truthfully,
"About everything I own."
Then I went to class and the prof
called a test. "This test will be
conducted under the Stanford Hon
or Code. Please sit three seats apart
in alternate rows."
It was still early in the morning,
so I had to ask the date.
"Never mind the date, finish the
ex:im," said he.
"OK, said I."I just wanted to
have something right on my paper."
Oh. well, flunk now. Avoid the De
cember rush.
I remember a sayinq: "A fool can

ask more questions than a wise man
can answer." That's probably why
everyone is flunking his old exams.
There are other ways to get a
diploma, anyhow. You can study
hard ... or you can marry the
dean's daughter, il' he had a daugh
ter.
I thought there was going to be
one bright spot in last Monday,
though. The prof handed back my
