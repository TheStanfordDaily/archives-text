name of the winner from a barrel
at Rickey's Gay DO's Show.
Stanford students may enter the
contest by filling out tickets, ob
tainable at Rickey's, and dropping
them in the barrel provided for the
entries.
The winning student will not be
traveling alone, as he will be aboard
the same TWA plane as several
other members of the Eastward
bound Stanford contingent.
The holder or tlie winning ticket
at the Oct. 29 drawing does not
have to be present at the Studio
Club to win the air trip. In addi
tion to the New York trip, runner-up
prizes, ranging from free dinners to
bottles of champagne will be given
to students whose tickets are drawn
in consolation contests.
Going back to our opening para
graph. don't think we have over
looked the fact that you might be
lucky at both love and cards. In
this case, forget about the drawing,
pet in the nearest poker game, and
win enough to take both you and
your loved one to New York.
Simple, huh?
