### PAT FOSTER 
There is a course at Stanford
which is attended only by barefoot
students and winch is conducted U
a background of low-down, sex>
music.
Those who support the elas:
boast proudly and truthfully tha
it is the only thing of its kind ii
this otherwise staid University
Those who do not support the clas
boast proudly and truthfully that i
is the only thing of its kind in thi
otherwise staid University, than!
heaven.
But despite the shade of differ
ence, both groups agree that th
course in Modern Dance is th
most unique course on campu:
While most classes are taught b
owl - eyed professors in double
breasted suits, this one is taught b
a barefoot woman in an apache cos
tume ... tight T-shirt and blac
skirt slit to the hip.
Whi'e most students file into elas
cluttered with impedimenta, mod
ern dance students file in cluttcre
not even with clothing â€” aside, (
course, from some surrealistic pa
jamas. These pajamas, designed b
Salvador Dali as an illustration t
a poem by Gertrude Stein, are in
dieo and indecent, to say the leas
They begin at the highest che:
bone and end where the thigh joir
the hip. In between there is enoug
material for a swimming suit t\\
sizes smaller than the one the stu
dent wears.
The only person present wit
shoes on is the pianist, who has t
work the pedals. Her bass is sul
gestive, but her treble is downrigl
obvious. To her sultry accompan
ment the class executes the follow
ing exercises:
1. Bouncing the top of the ski;
on the floor 50 times without bene
ing the knees or the spine
2. Touching the back of the net
to the back of the ankles withoi
sticking out the stomach.
3. Walking upside down on il
ceiling without leaving the floor.
When these rhythmic moot
movements have been mastere
when they convey an expression
sensuality, a profound philosoph
and exquisite beauty of line, tin
the student is a full-fledged mot
ern dancer. She has a fine pendi
lum swing and an excellent !oc<
motor. She is eligible for the M.
degree.
