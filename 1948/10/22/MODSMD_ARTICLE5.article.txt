# Indians Plotting 'Fall of Troy'
## Homecoming Battle Expected To Draw 45,000 Grid Fans 
### JOHN BREIER 
A Homecoming crowd of some 45,000 persons, the second
largest number of fans to witness a game in Stanford Sta
dium since Stanford resumed football in 1946, is expected
to be on hand tomorrow at 2:30 for the 29th Stanford-USC
football game.
The question before this crowd will be, "Is Stanford really
on the way back to the top of the Coast football list; or
was the 34 to 14 win over UCLA just a case of Stanford
having a lucky day?"
The question may well be answered tomorrow afternoon
for in the USC Trojans the Cards will meet a team that
gives promise of being the best that the Indians have met
to date.
Professional oddsmakers take the negative approach and
have established the Trojans as 0 to 10-point favorites. Both
teams will be "up" for this game—USC because a loss to
Stanford would banish all hopes of remaining in contention
for the PCC title, and Stanford because the will to win is
there and men want to even the score over the years to 14
wins apiece. And—this is the Stanford-USC game.
The Schwartzmen are not kidding themselves that the
going will be easy. The Trojans, notoriously slow starters,
are alv/ays a tough team, even more so against Stanford.
The lads know that the SouLhlanders came very close to
upsetting Oregon's rose (bowl) cart last week in the Ducks'
homeland. A 61-yard pass and a safety were the margin of
victory as Oregon won, 8 to 7.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has worked all week to perfect
the Cards' pass defense. It was the lack of adequate aerial
protection that caused Stanford to lose the WSC game and
enabled the Bruins to control the ball for the greater part
of the first half last week.
It is also no secret that the Cards plan to take to the air in
no small measures tomorrow. Schwartz knows that there
is a big difference in the strength of the UCLA and USC lines.
Scout reports have it that the Trojan secondary may be the
strongest defense the Cards meet this season. The Indian
backs will find it much harder to rip off long gainers against
this combination of a strong line and powerful secondary.
This Trojan team is not one of the great football machines
which fans have come to expect from USC, nor is it a team
to be regarded lightly. Jeff Cravath's men come to the Farm
with a record of three wins and two losses. They fumbled
12 times in losing 19 to 0 against a good Ohio State outfit. A
loss to this team would be no disgrace, but the chance of
this coming about is not even in the books in the eyes of a
determined bunch of Stanford football players.
But the outlook for a successful aerial attack is dimmed
with a look at the record. The Trojans have allowed an
average of but 30 yards per game via the aerial route in their
five games thus far this season. The task of pass tossing will
fall to Emery Mitchell, Tom Shaw, and Don Campbell.
Mitchell will be tossing from his fullback spot while Shaw
and Campbell throw from the more conventional quarter
back station. Aubrey Devine may also throw from the latter
spot. Mitchell and Martin Anderson are co-captains for the
game.
