# Southern Cal Pass Attack Threatens Card Eleven
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Once again USC will invade the
Farm with a roster which is loaded
with top-flight football talent. As
yet, however, Coach Jeff Cravath
has been unable to combine this
talent in the right proportions, and
consequently the so-called Thun
dering herd hasn't done much
thundering thus far this season.
But the Trojans are traditionally
slow starters, and the sight of the
Indians Saturday may inspire a su
perior effort.
Cravath has had a difficult time
selecting a number one quarter
back. Dean Dill, Jim Powers, and
George Murphy have all shown
flashes of brilliance, but none of
them are consistent. Dill has been
game, but against the Webfeet he
was unable to make the passing at
tack click, so Cravath sent in Pow
ers who promptly engineered a f>B
- march for a touchdown. Mur
phy has been sidelined with an in
jury but will be ready to go to
morrow.
Doll Chief Threat
Don Doll, who is playing his
fourth year of varsity competition,
is the breakaway threat in the
backfield as he was last year. Doll's
running mate at the other halfback
slot is Arl Battle. Battle was side
lined all last year with a trick knee
but this season has regained some
of the form which made him one
of the team's leading ground-gain
ers as a sophomore in 104(5.
At fullback is Bill Martin, who is
not. much of a power runner but
has looked good as a line backer

and blocker. Martin's understudy
is Bill Betz who was shifted from
quarterback.
Trojan Line Weakened
The Trojan line has been weak
ened considerably by graduation.
Gone are All - Americans Paul
Cleary and John Ferraro, guards
Don Clark and Fred McCall, and
center Walt McCormick.
The strong position in the line is
center, where three top men are
fighting it out for the number one
spot. Right now Boyd Hachten
(brother of Bill) has the edge over
Mercer Barnes and Tom Hamilton.
The right tackle position has been
weakened by the loss of Bob Hen
dren, who fractured his arm in the
Rice game. Replacing him will be
George Schutte, a 210-pounder.
Pas% Attack Stressed
The Trojan ground attack, which
has had a tendency to sputter and
die out periodically, has been sub
ordinated to the passing attack, so
the offensive burden will fall on
the passing arm of the quarter
back. Dill and Powers are both
among the top six passers in the
PCC according to the latest statis
tics released.
Pass defense is one of Stanford's
weaker points, so the effectiveness
of Troy's aerial attempts should de
cide tomorrow's battle.

center Walt McCormick.
The strong position in the line is
center, where three top men are
fighting it out for the number one
spot. Right now Boyd Hachten
(brother of Bill) has the edge over
Mercer Barnes and Tom Hamilton.
The right tackle position has been
weakened by the loss of Bob Hen
dren, who fractured his arm in the
Rice game. Replacing him will be
George Schutte, a 210-pounder.
Pas% Attack Stressed
The Trojan ground attack, which
has had a tendency to sputter and
die out periodically, has been sub
ordinated to the passing attack, so
the offensive burden will fall on
the passing arm of the quarter
back. Dill and Powers are both
among the top six passers in the
PCC according to the latest statis
tics released.
Pass defense is one of Stanford's
weaker points, so the effectiveness
of Troy's aerial attempts should de
cide tomorrow's battle.
Once again USC will invade the
Farm with a roster which is loaded
with top-flight football talent. As
yet, however, Coach Jeff Cravath
has been unable to combine this
talent in the right proportions, and
consequently the so-called Thun
dering herd hasn't done much
thundering thus far this season.
But the Trojans are traditionally
slow starters, and the sight of the
Indians Saturday may inspire a su
perior effort.
Cravath has had a difficult time
selecting a number one quarter
back. Dean Dill, Jim Powers, and
George Murphy have all shown
flashes of brilliance, but none of
them are consistent. Dill has been
game, but against the Webfeet he
was unable to make the passing at
tack click, so Cravath sent in Pow
ers who promptly engineered a f>B
- march for a touchdown. Mur
phy has been sidelined with an in
jury but will be ready to go to
morrow.
Doll Chief Threat
Don Doll, who is playing his
fourth year of varsity competition,
is the breakaway threat in the
backfield as he was last year. Doll's
running mate at the other halfback
slot is Arl Battle. Battle was side
lined all last year with a trick knee
but this season has regained some
of the form which made him one
of the team's leading ground-gain
ers as a sophomore in 104(5.
At fullback is Bill Martin, who is
not. much of a power runner but
has looked good as a line backer

and blocker. Martin's understudy
is Bill Betz who was shifted from
quarterback.
Trojan Line Weakened
The Trojan line has been weak
ened considerably by graduation.
Gone are All - Americans Paul
Cleary and John Ferraro, guards
Don Clark and Fred McCall, and
center Walt McCormick.
The strong position in the line is
center, where three top men are
fighting it out for the number one
spot. Right now Boyd Hachten
(brother of Bill) has the edge over
Mercer Barnes and Tom Hamilton.
