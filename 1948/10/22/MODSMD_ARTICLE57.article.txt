# ALL-U TOURNEY
## Tomorrow Last Day to Qualify 
### 
Tomorrow is the last day for
qualifying rounds to be posted in
the All-University golf tournament,
which will be used as a basis for
determining next year's varsity golf
squad
Ernie Kellberg, in charge of the
tourney, said first - round matches
will be played next week, in the
championship as well as in other
flights.
The entry fee for the tournament
is $1, but each player will receive
at least a top-flight golf ball for
his donation. The tournament will
run until just before the Thanks
giving weekend. Kellberg empha
sized that entrants will be able to
play at least three rounds in the
tournament, since first-round losers
will play off in consolation flights.
