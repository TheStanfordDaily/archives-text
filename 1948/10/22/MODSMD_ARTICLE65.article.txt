# Indians, Bears In 71st Soccer Game
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team enter
tains the highly regarded Univer
sity of California Bears tomorrow
morning at 10. The game would
appear to be a toss-up, since both
teams have defeated San Francisco
State and lost to USF.
Tomorrow's clash will mark the
71st renewal between the two
schools. The Indians have won 33,
lost 27, and 10 games have ended
in ties. Last year the Indians upset
the Bears 3-0, marking the first
California loss to a collegiate op
ponent since 1943.
The Stanford squad has won two
games and lost one this season.
They opened their season with a
5-1 victory over San Francisco
State. Two weeks ago they lost a
hard-fought game to USF 2-0, but
bounced back last Saturday to de
feat the Cal Aggies 4-0.
The Bears were tied by San
Francisco City College 3-3, defeat
ed San Francisco State 5-2, and lost
to USF 2-1. California has an all
veteran team and is considered to
be very much in the fieht for the
Conference championship, which
they have won for the past two
years.
Stanford hopes were bolstered
this week with the return to action
of Homi Irani, stellar right half
back. Irani was injured in the USF
game, but he should be in topnotch
shape for tomorrow's encounter.
Coach John Segel has named Ara
Galstaun, left inside, captain for
this game. Galstaun, a senior, was
team captain in 1948 and 1947, and
he has proved to be the chief of
fensive threat of the Indians this
year. James Sacerdote has replaced
Beezy Jones at inside right for
Stanford.
