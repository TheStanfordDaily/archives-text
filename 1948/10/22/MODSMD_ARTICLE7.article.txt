# What a Riot! (No Riot): Freshmen Avoid Violence at Noisy Pajamarino
## 
### 
As a football ral'y, last night's
Pajamarino can be proclaimed a
complete success. Almost without
cxceution, the rally was the spir
ited, boisterous, but not the bellig
erent affair that it could have been.

The flush men gathered in front
I of Em ilia at 7:15 to bellow insults
! at various campus groups, prima
; l ily the class of '51.* The pande
| monium was broken only by the
! staccato blasts of firecrackers and
| the dull thud of waterbags from
j above.
When the band struck up "Come
Join the Band," the march to Roblo
was under way. Those motorists
who were unfortunate enough to
be caught in the line of march suf
fered a thorough jolting as their
J cars were rocked by the frisky
i frosh. The men of "5l offered only
: tin- feeblest resistance during the
course of the procession.
The frosh men were greeted at
i Roble by a group of squealing
women who promptly joined in the
hilarity. Following the rally, the
women trooped from Roble. Those
who were not properly attired were
greeted with a jeering chorus of
"We want pajamas!"
The procession back to Encina for
the "Pajama" dance was peaceful.
A few of the fiercest frosh managed
to disrupt the tranquility at the Li
brary with further condemnation of
the Class of '51. Jmi llaggart
