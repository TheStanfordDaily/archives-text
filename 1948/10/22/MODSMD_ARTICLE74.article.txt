# Indian Baseball Player Smashed by Line Drive
## 
### 
Claude Rosenberg, candidate for
this year's baseball team, was
smashed in the right eye with a
line drive yesterday afternoon.
During batting practice, Claude was
standing with his back to the plate,
and he turned around just as the
ball was clouted. Dr. Eckert, of the
Stanford Health Service, said that
the skin around his eye was badly
bruised, but that no damage was
done to the eye.
