To Whom Does This Concern?
Dear Students.
If you buy a hat or a tie and wish you hadn't;
If that new pair of shoes doesn't fit;
If you're just plain tired of that "perfectly good' outfit;
If you'd like a change of scenery in your closet .
If you'd like a terrific "buy'' in anything from a new.silver fox jacket to an
imported English suit;
If you like the fun of bartering, or have something someone else would like—
Visit the unique
Repeat Performance Shop
BUT
IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR WORN OUT RAGS;
IF YOU NEED TO BUY CHEAP. SECOND-HAND CLOTHES;
CO ... . ELSEWHERE!

this treasure at the
