# Troy Squeezes By Cards 7 to 6
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford lost another football game Saturday, but few fans
left the Stadium with any feeling but that they had seen a top
notch ball game, a game that Stanford could have easily won.
Take 20 seconds from the first half and add those 20 seconds
to the second half and the Stanford Indians might well be cele-

"brating their second Conference win
of the year today.
As it is, the Cards fihd themselves
on the short end of a 7 to 6 score
against a good USC team. The Tro
jans tallied their TD with but 20
seconds left in the first half.
The score was 7 to 6 when the
Indians' drive for their second
marker fell short after an 81-yard
march from their own 3-yard line
Six running plays after the Reds ha(
recovered an SC fumble on thei.
own 3, found the Cards on the Si
48 with but 3 minutes remainin
in the game.
Time Important
Time was of the esence now. Run
ning plays might gain the 48 yara
and a touchdown, but the clock wa
running out. A pass might go a>
the way; if it fell incomplete, th.
clock would be stopped. Quarter
back Aubrey Devine decided to pass.
An Emery Mitchell to Boyd Benson
toss was good to the Trojan 31. Two
plays later Mitchell hit Rupe An
drews for a 15-yard gain to the SC
16. Two minutes and 10 seconds to
go.
Interception
If more time had remained, De
vine might have called a running
play. But running plays eat up time,
and the Cards had all too little ot
that. Trojan Don Doll intercepted
the next aerial and, for the Indian
fans, that was the ball game.
Favorites by up to 10 points, it
was a relieved Trojan team that
walked from the field. Except for
brief lapses in their defense, the In
dians held the hard-running Trojan
backs to short gains. Twice the Cards
had stopped a USC drive within the
Red five-yard line. The margin of
victory was but one point. The men
of Troy had converted after their
touchdown, the Cards hadn't.
Once again the Indians won the
Battle of the Statistics. First down
honors went to the Stanfords, 17
to 15, as did total rushing yardage,
294 to 282.
The Indians' six points came by
way of a pass (o Andrews from
Mitchell. Jim Castignoli, perhaps
the outstanding lineman on the field,
recovered an SC fumble on the Tro
jan 40 early in the fourth quarter.
Andrews Scores
Passes to A 1 Laakso and Andrews
put the ball on the Trojan 21 from
where Andrews scored after a neat
bit of running along the sideline.
Mitchell missed the conversion to
make the score 7 to G.
The margin of difference between
the two teams seemed to be in the
big Troy line. Outweighing the Card
forwards 11 pounds per man, the
Trojan linemen double-teamed the
Ked frontmen to open big holes
through which hard-running back;
such as Bill Betz, Don Doll, anc
Jack Kirby, powered for short and
sometimes long, yardage.
By double-teaming, the Cravath
men sacrificed downfield blockinj
but thereby could spring their back
through the line. From then on, i
was up to the backs.
Indians Display Talent
But the battling Indians brough
the crowd of 45,000 to its feet nior
than once with a display of passin
and running that marks the Card
as a team that no opponent can tak
lightly.
The fans cheered as the Redskii
waved punter Mike Durkett back 1
the sidelines when Durkett was sei
in to kick when the Cards had th
ball, fourth .and two on their ow
41. Mitchell boomed for the lir
down with yardage to spare.
Hard Running
Indian backs did a little hai
running of their own during tl
day. Mitchell was the top man
the Card baeklield with his runnii
and throwing. When vital groin
was to be gained it was general
the bulldozing fullback who w
given the ball. Al Turriziani ca
lied the ball 11 times for 41 yar
and Bob White, who got very lilt
support on his end runs, ended i
with a like amount of ground game
Marchie Schwartz singled o
Jack McKittrick, Al Laakso, w
played about 55 minutes, and,
course, Jim Castignoli, for prai;
He said he also liked the sigi
calling of Devine and the all arou
performance of Mitchell.
Schwartz Called
In the dressing room after t
game, as the gridders scatter
apologies and congratulated ea
other, the sound of the Stanfo
Band could be heard as that gro
serenaded the team and its coai
Outside a large number ot st
dents and alumni were gathered
show their team that they thouj,
none the less of the squad for losii
Answering the cry of "We w;
Schwartz," the headman left intt
iewing newspaper men to wave
the crowd. As he reentered t
dressing room, one of the playi
asked, "How can we lose when tl
are behind us like that?"
Schwartz shook his head as ;
other player shouted, "We have .
other chance next week, we'll
I Washington."

Stanford lost another football game Saturday, but few fans
left the Stadium with any feeling but that they had seen a top
notch ball game, a game that Stanford could have easily won.
Take 20 seconds from the first half and add those 20 seconds
to the second half and the Stanford Indians might well be cele-

"brating their second Conference win
of the year today.
As it is, the Cards fihd themselves
on the short end of a 7 to 6 score
against a good USC team. The Tro
jans tallied their TD with but 20
seconds left in the first half.
The score was 7 to 6 when the
Indians' drive for their second
marker fell short after an 81-yard
march from their own 3-yard line
Six running plays after the Reds ha(
recovered an SC fumble on thei.
own 3, found the Cards on the Si
48 with but 3 minutes remainin
in the game.
Time Important
Time was of the esence now. Run
ning plays might gain the 48 yara
and a touchdown, but the clock wa
running out. A pass might go a>
the way; if it fell incomplete, th.
clock would be stopped. Quarter
back Aubrey Devine decided to pass.
An Emery Mitchell to Boyd Benson
toss was good to the Trojan 31. Two
plays later Mitchell hit Rupe An
drews for a 15-yard gain to the SC
16. Two minutes and 10 seconds to
go.
Interception
If more time had remained, De
vine might have called a running
play. But running plays eat up time,
and the Cards had all too little ot
that. Trojan Don Doll intercepted
the next aerial and, for the Indian
fans, that was the ball game.
Favorites by up to 10 points, it
was a relieved Trojan team that
walked from the field. Except for
brief lapses in their defense, the In
dians held the hard-running Trojan
backs to short gains. Twice the Cards
had stopped a USC drive within the
Red five-yard line. The margin of
victory was but one point. The men
of Troy had converted after their
touchdown, the Cards hadn't.
Once again the Indians won the
Battle of the Statistics. First down
honors went to the Stanfords, 17
to 15, as did total rushing yardage,
294 to 282.
The Indians' six points came by
way of a pass (o Andrews from
Mitchell. Jim Castignoli, perhaps
the outstanding lineman on the field,
recovered an SC fumble on the Tro
jan 40 early in the fourth quarter.
Andrews Scores
Passes to A 1 Laakso and Andrews
put the ball on the Trojan 21 from
where Andrews scored after a neat
bit of running along the sideline.
Mitchell missed the conversion to
make the score 7 to G.
The margin of difference between
the two teams seemed to be in the
big Troy line. Outweighing the Card
forwards 11 pounds per man, the
Trojan linemen double-teamed the
Ked frontmen to open big holes
through which hard-running back;
such as Bill Betz, Don Doll, anc
Jack Kirby, powered for short and
sometimes long, yardage.
By double-teaming, the Cravath
men sacrificed downfield blockinj
but thereby could spring their back
through the line. From then on, i
was up to the backs.
Indians Display Talent
But the battling Indians brough
the crowd of 45,000 to its feet nior
than once with a display of passin
and running that marks the Card
as a team that no opponent can tak
lightly.
The fans cheered as the Redskii
waved punter Mike Durkett back 1
the sidelines when Durkett was sei
in to kick when the Cards had th
ball, fourth .and two on their ow
41. Mitchell boomed for the lir
down with yardage to spare.
Hard Running
Indian backs did a little hai
running of their own during tl
day. Mitchell was the top man
the Card baeklield with his runnii
and throwing. When vital groin
was to be gained it was general
the bulldozing fullback who w
given the ball. Al Turriziani ca
lied the ball 11 times for 41 yar
and Bob White, who got very lilt
support on his end runs, ended i
with a like amount of ground game
Marchie Schwartz singled o
Jack McKittrick, Al Laakso, w
played about 55 minutes, and,
course, Jim Castignoli, for prai;
He said he also liked the sigi
calling of Devine and the all arou
performance of Mitchell.

Indian backs did a little hai
running of their own during tl
day. Mitchell was the top man
the Card baeklield with his runnii
and throwing. When vital groin
was to be gained it was general
the bulldozing fullback who w
given the ball. Al Turriziani ca
lied the ball 11 times for 41 yar
and Bob White, who got very lilt
support on his end runs, ended i
with a like amount of ground game
Marchie Schwartz singled o
Jack McKittrick, Al Laakso, w
played about 55 minutes, and,
course, Jim Castignoli, for prai;
He said he also liked the sigi
calling of Devine and the all arou
performance of Mitchell.

Answering the cry of "We w;

Stanford lost another football game Saturday, but few fans
left the Stadium with any feeling but that they had seen a top
notch ball game, a game that Stanford could have easily won.
Take 20 seconds from the first half and add those 20 seconds
to the second half and the Stanford Indians might well be cele-

"brating their second Conference win
of the year today.
As it is, the Cards fihd themselves
on the short end of a 7 to 6 score
against a good USC team. The Tro
jans tallied their TD with but 20
seconds left in the first half.
The score was 7 to 6 when the
Indians' drive for their second
marker fell short after an 81-yard
march from their own 3-yard line
Six running plays after the Reds ha(
recovered an SC fumble on thei.
own 3, found the Cards on the Si
48 with but 3 minutes remainin
in the game.
Time Important
Time was of the esence now. Run
ning plays might gain the 48 yara
and a touchdown, but the clock wa
running out. A pass might go a>
the way; if it fell incomplete, th.
clock would be stopped. Quarter
back Aubrey Devine decided to pass.
An Emery Mitchell to Boyd Benson
toss was good to the Trojan 31. Two
plays later Mitchell hit Rupe An
drews for a 15-yard gain to the SC
16. Two minutes and 10 seconds to
go.
Interception
If more time had remained, De
vine might have called a running
play. But running plays eat up time,
and the Cards had all too little ot
that. Trojan Don Doll intercepted
the next aerial and, for the Indian
fans, that was the ball game.
Favorites by up to 10 points, it
was a relieved Trojan team that
walked from the field. Except for
brief lapses in their defense, the In
dians held the hard-running Trojan
backs to short gains. Twice the Cards
had stopped a USC drive within the
Red five-yard line. The margin of
victory was but one point. The men
of Troy had converted after their
touchdown, the Cards hadn't.
Once again the Indians won the
Battle of the Statistics. First down
honors went to the Stanfords, 17
to 15, as did total rushing yardage,
294 to 282.
The Indians' six points came by
way of a pass (o Andrews from
Mitchell. Jim Castignoli, perhaps
the outstanding lineman on the field,
recovered an SC fumble on the Tro
jan 40 early in the fourth quarter.
Andrews Scores
Passes to A 1 Laakso and Andrews
put the ball on the Trojan 21 from
where Andrews scored after a neat
bit of running along the sideline.
Mitchell missed the conversion to
make the score 7 to G.
The margin of difference between
the two teams seemed to be in the
big Troy line. Outweighing the Card
forwards 11 pounds per man, the
Trojan linemen double-teamed the
Ked frontmen to open big holes
through which hard-running back;
such as Bill Betz, Don Doll, anc
Jack Kirby, powered for short and
sometimes long, yardage.
By double-teaming, the Cravath
men sacrificed downfield blockinj
but thereby could spring their back
through the line. From then on, i
was up to the backs.
Indians Display Talent
But the battling Indians brough
the crowd of 45,000 to its feet nior
than once with a display of passin
and running that marks the Card
as a team that no opponent can tak
lightly.
The fans cheered as the Redskii
waved punter Mike Durkett back 1
the sidelines when Durkett was sei
in to kick when the Cards had th
ball, fourth .and two on their ow
41. Mitchell boomed for the lir
down with yardage to spare.
