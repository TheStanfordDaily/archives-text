# Troy Squeezes By Cards 7 to 6
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford lost another football game Saturday, but few fans
left the Stadium with any feeling but that they had seen a top
notch ball game, a game that Stanford could have easily won.
Take 20 seconds from the first half and add those 20 seconds
to the second half and the Stanford Indians might well be cele-

"brating their second Conference win
of the year today.
As it is, the Cards fihd themselves
on the short end of a 7 to 6 score
against a good USC team. The Tro
jans tallied their TD with but 20
seconds left in the first half.
The score was 7 to 6 when the
Indians' drive for their second
marker fell short after an 81-yard
march from their own 3-yard line
Six running plays after the Reds ha(
recovered an SC fumble on thei.
own 3, found the Cards on the Si
48 with but 3 minutes remainin
in the game.
Time Important
Time was of the esence now. Run
ning plays might gain the 48 yara
and a touchdown, but the clock wa
running out. A pass might go a>
the way; if it fell incomplete, th.
clock would be stopped. Quarter
back Aubrey Devine decided to pass.
An Emery Mitchell to Boyd Benson
toss was good to the Trojan 31. Two
plays later Mitchell hit Rupe An
drews for a 15-yard gain to the SC
16. Two minutes and 10 seconds to
go.
Interception
If more time had remained, De
vine might have called a running
play. But running plays eat up time,
and the Cards had all too little ot
that. Trojan Don Doll intercepted
the next aerial and, for the Indian
fans, that was the ball game.
Favorites by up to 10 points, it
was a relieved Trojan team that
walked from the field. Except for
brief lapses in their defense, the In
dians held the hard-running Trojan
backs to short gains. Twice the Cards
had stopped a USC drive within the
Red five-yard line. The margin of
victory was but one point. The men
of Troy had converted after their
touchdown, the Cards hadn't.
Once again the Indians won the
Battle of the Statistics. First down
honors went to the Stanfords, 17
to 15, as did total rushing yardage,
294 to 282.
The Indians' six points came by
