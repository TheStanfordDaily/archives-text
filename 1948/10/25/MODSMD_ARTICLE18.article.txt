# F. Boothe Resigns Grad Excom Post
## 
### 
Excom member Ferris Boothe re
signed last week, leaving the posi
tion of graduate representative to
be filled in the coming elections.
Although Excom still must offi
cially accept or reject the resigna
tion, nominations to the office will
be accepted for the autumn quar
ter ballot this week.
"I take this action with real re
gret," Boothe said, 'but responsi
bilities at home forced me to miss
the first two weeks of law school,
and I find that I cannot catch up
on a heavy academic schedule, act
as president of my fraternity, and
still do the kind of job I would like
to do on Excom. I am deeply sorry
that, having assumed the office in
the spring, I am unable to carry it
out this year."
