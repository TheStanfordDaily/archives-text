MONDAY'S DAILEY DOZEN: (All right, then; half-dozen.)
Overheard: Two '"real gone guys" from USC leaving the game at the
Stadium Saturday:
"Whadja think of the game?" asks number one.
"Yaaah, we killed 'em!" said the other.

Oh, come now, boys!

I don't know about you, but next year's USC team
won't seem the same to me without Don Doll on the
squad. So far, he's played four years of varsity
competition; the first two under the name of Don
Burnsides, and the last two as Don Doll.
If he changes his name to Don Vishinsky next
year and comes back to USC under the five-year
plan, I'm through!

Ah, good old USC, the only school on the Coast

where the players forget about their grades and just worry about their
options.

Knox Manning, describing the mass-production divorces in Reno on his
CBS news show, "Today's Feature Page": "Reno is the city where the
residents go down to the railroad station to watch the tied (tide) come
in, and the untied go out!"

Today's $64 Question: What Stanford University Bull Sessioner is 1-T
with his draft board, and why am I?

One of my Southern California friends was telling me about a bistro
in San Fernando Valley where the main entertainment consists of a
sultry-looking gal tinkling the piano and making cutting' remarks to
the customers.
In a typical situation, the action goes about like this:
(Enter left a well-dressed man and a woman who is wearing an expen
sive-looking fur coat.)
Girl at Piano: My, that's a nice-looking fur coat.
Woman customer: (rather surprised) Why ... ah ... ah .. . thank you.
Girl at Piano: Tell me, did he give you that to keep you warm or to
keep you quiet?
Later, as the couple prepare to leave, the girl at the Steinway nods to
them and says: "Well, it's nice to have had you!"
