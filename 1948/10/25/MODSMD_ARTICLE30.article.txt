# Audience Vote Favors British Debate Team
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
An enthusiastic audience filled
Cubberley Auditorium Friday eve
ning to witness the first English de
bate held here since the war.
The Britons, English university
students Reginald Galer and An
thony Cox, took the affirmative
side of the question, "Resolved, that
modern society enjoys greater ben
efits under a planned economy,"
and the Stanfords, Forden Athearn
and Dick Kelton, the negative.
After the debate, the audience
turned in ballots recording changes
in opinion on the subject as a re
sult of the speakers' efforts. Tabu
lations showed the British team
caused 69 to change their minds
favorably to them, and 22 to change
favorably to their opposition.
The first speaker for the affirma
tive, Mr. Cox, outlined the chief
reasons for a country to plan its
economy. They were:
1. To make the best possible use
of resources.
2. To effect a more equitable dis
tribution of wealth and goods.
3. To minimize the cycle of boom
and slump "which has been char
acterized by the capitalistic sys
tem."
How It Works
He went on to tell how this plan
ning works in practice, taking
Great Britain as his example, and
mentioning "a certain degree of na
tionalization" which acts to control
capital investment, to control prices,
and to decrease imports while in
creasing exports.
His partner, Mr. Galer, said that
a capitalistic "slump" period causes
more of a loss of freedom through
rioting and upstarts than the oppo
sition supposes is lost through a
planned economy.
Athearn, speaking for the nega

tive, called government "at best, a
necessary evil," and branded it a
"helper, not a participant." He said
that the main difference between
the English and American systems
is that the former "plans to end
competition" and the latter "to en
courage it."
Kelton said that the capitalistic
economy is one of frequent elec
tions, popular supremacy, and
"many organizations seeking many
goals." The planned economy, he
said, is, in contrast, one of contin
uous, long-range plans with few
elections, government supremacy,
and an immutable, definite goal.
Government Control Better
In the rebuttal, the affirmative
said that popular supremacy did
exist in Great Britain in the form
of elections; that planning is done
mainly by means of co-operation,
and only in a small way by nation
alization; and that "it is better to
vest controls in a government than
in a cartel or single industrial or
ganization."
Countering, the negative said
that a planned economy means po
litical as well as economic control,
thus stifling progress and the right
of the individual to work out his
own future.
England Only Example
Kelton said that the British de
baters chose to only England
as an example of a planned econ
omy, and that the phrase "modern
society" as it appears in the resolu
tion refers to all peoples of the
world.
Two introductory addresses, one
by Dean Lawrence Kimpton, pre
siding chairman of the debate, and
the other by Mr. Ronald Arculus,
British vice - consul in San Fran
cisco, preceded the debate.
