People always say that you don't
have to worry about the walls hav
ing ears because they're plastered
anyhow.
But the stories that barroom
walls cou'd tell I'll bet would make
interesting movie rights. The sto
ries you do hear make you won
der at times if the temporary sen
sation is really worth it.
For instance, I heard of a soak
who came up to a policeman with
the query, "Shay, offisher, where
am I?" The policeman answered
that he was on the corner of Fourth
and Mission. The soak broke in
with, "Never mind the details. What
town?"
In staid Plymouth, Mass., a cop
raced to the historic First Congre
gational Church because he heard
the bells playing. That, in itself,
wasn't unusual, you say. Well,
there was a bit more to the story.
It seems the bells were giving out
with "St. Louis Blues." So he ar
rested the church organist for in
toxication.
The constable in a tiny western
Nebraska town reported that he
had no doubt the driver of the car
he halted was intoxicated. "When
I went up to talk to him I noticed
he didn't have his shoes on, so I
told him to put them on and get
out of the car." The officer turned
his back for a moment to find his
ticket pad and when he again
looked up out stepped the driver—
with his hat on one foot and one
shoe on his head.
And a lady I know tells this one
on her spouse, in jest I suspect,
though he never denies it. But it
seems that most people revel in a
reputation for sin. Anyhow, hubby
hit both sides of the door on his
way in about 0.'500 one morning af
ter a glorious evening on the town.
In a few moments a series of un
earthly squawks howled out of the
radio.
Wifey ran anxiously into the liv
ing room to find her man twisting
the dial back and forth frantically.
"For heaven's sake! What in the
world are you doing?" she asked.
"G'way. Don't bother me. Some
body's locked in the safe and I've
forgotten the combination."
This one is just thrown in. I don't
vouch for it.
He kissed her in the garden—
The moon was shining bright.
She was a marble statue,
And he was drunk that night!
And so was the guy walking
round and round a telephone pole
mumbling, "I'll find the gate to this
place if it takes all night."
