To the Editor:
I guess I'm just a hooligan at
heart, because I think that the Pa
jamarino, if you can call the chick
en - livered whimpering of last
Thursday night by that awe - in
spiring name, an utter flop. Why,
heals-beals! It just ain't a Paja
marino if it doesn't show itself on
the Row, and get its face colored by
tomatoes.
Go on, you "more mature" stu
dents, chastise me, but I'd rather
have my destructive passions show
themselves in activities like the
Good Old Pajamarinos, than have
all sorts of psychological inhibi
tions gnawing at my heart in my
older years. Who knows, but that
it may make a foul munitions man
ufacturer of me some day.

year's Pajamarino—Encina spon
sors, Interfraternity Council, the
Dean — bent over backward to
make this year's affair a "rally"
and not a brawl. Last year's af
fair got so out of band that the
University's face—and the major
ity of the students'—were a good
deal redder than the marching
frosli.—Ed.)
