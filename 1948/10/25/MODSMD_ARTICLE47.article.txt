# 'Sorry, Wrong Number' Loses Punch in Film Writers' Hands
## 
### 
Suspense's tension-filled, superexciting radio drama, "Sorry,
Wrong Number," now playing at the Stanford, has been amply
padded in all the right places in the movie version. But some
how the extra padding has blunted the razor sharpness of the
original script.
Extra scenes, filmed to stretch out the original radio playlet,

merely make parts of the picture
bulge like a loose girdle. The tele
phone, omen of evil in the radio
drama, seems as evil as a dishrag in
the clammy hands of the hysterical
heroine and her assorted friends.
Plagued by elastic tension as it
is, the picture is still far above most
of the mystery movies released
lately. It builds up to a smashing
climax that is not ruined by Holly
wood's gentle hand and conse
quently will leave the audience
breathless.
Crossed telephone wires begin the
chilling action of the picture. Bar
bara Stanwyck, a neurotic invalid,
overhears two men plotting a mur
der. Gradually she comes to realize
the men are planning her own death.
Miss Stanwyck plays with good
restraint a part that begs for over
acting. Her characterization is ex
cellent. O'nly the scenario writer
can be blamed for the fact that she
must play most of her scenes in
near hysteria. Burt Lancaster, as
her husband, is less the brute of
"Brute Force" and more of an actor
than in any other of his recent pic
tures. The supporting cast is not re
markable, but Ann Richards and
Wendall Coiey are competent.—Al
jean Levin.
