## 
### 
"France," a topic to be presented
by French students, will be debated
by the Discussion Series group 011
Thursday at 8 p.m. on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
Four conclusions were reached in
last week's discussion of the UN.
led by Robert von Pagenhardt, IIR
president, and Howard Lockwood,
intern for the UN last summer:
1. In three years the UN has
achieved greater co-operation than
has been achieved in any other pe
riod of modern state history.
2. The UN represents the great
est limits which the great powers
will accept under present world
conditions.
3. The veto is the UN's most mis
understood aspect. Even if it were
legally removed, the present situ
ation in the UN and in the world
would be fundamentally the same.
4. The UN's assumption of suc
cess lies in its broad membership
support.
