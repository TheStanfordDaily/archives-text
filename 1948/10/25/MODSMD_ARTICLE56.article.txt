### 
Stanford's locker - room scene
Saturday after the game was ex
actly what you would expect from
a squad that had just dropped a
close, hard - fought football game.
The players didn't mind missing a
tie as much as they minded falling
short in that last-minute drive. A
win is what they were after.
Coach Schwartz said that he was
proud of his men, that they never
gave up, and that they all played
good football. He supported the
choice of plays in the last two
minutes when Stanford passed in
stead of running with a first down
011 the Trojan 16-yard line.
Schwartz named Mitchell, De
vine, McKittrick, Castagnoli, and
Laakso as the outstanding men for
Stanford. He thought USC's top
men were Don Doll and Boyd Hach
ten.
The Indians suffered several in
juries which will weaken the squad
for the Washington game. Don
Campbell has a possible head con
cussion. Don Fix will be laid up
with a pinched shoulder. Bob Roh
rer has a hip pointer that will defi
nitely keep him idle next Saturday.
Other injuries included Boyd
Benson, with a possible ankle frac
ture, and Bob White, who has a
badly bruised lip.
