yearlings of Troyland Saturday to rack up a 19 to 7 win and
cast a greedy glance at the Conference crown.
The Cards' first score came early in the opening period after

| much touted center, A 1 Baldock,
while Captain Jess Cone, Bernie
Tokarz, Owen Powell, and Joe
j Jacobs administered rather cruel
| treatment to the Trojan guards.
Reserve tackle Brue Mikesell was
j another standout on defense, while
tackles Lee Daley, Chuck Hokan
son, and A 1 Raisch handled their
duties well throughout.

Though slowing up considerably
Staging a first half display of slick, savage football, the Indian
frosh, Stanford's own Whiz Kids, stormed all over the vaunted
yearlings of Troyland Saturday to rack up a 19 to 7 win and
cast a greedy glance at the Conference crown.
The Cards' first score came early in the opening period after

j in the second half, the frosh for
wards murdered the Trojan pri
mary in the first two quarters. Doug"
Thamer on defense and Dave Wor
ley on offense both .ymatch SC's
| much touted center, A 1 Baldock,
while Captain Jess Cone, Bernie
Tokarz, Owen Powell, and Joe
j Jacobs administered rather cruel
| treatment to the Trojan guards.
Reserve tackle Brue Mikesell was
j another standout on defense, while
tackles Lee Daley, Chuck Hokan
son, and A 1 Raisch handled their
duties well throughout.

■tarry Hugasian ran an SC punt i
)ack to the Trojan 40. From there, |
ie and Eric South wood took turns
:nocking off yards down to the two,
rom which point Fullback Marv
•lellaway rammed over for six. End
>ill McColl's kick for point failed.
Drive Goes fiO Yards
A second Stanford march carried
0 yards to the goal line at the (
tart of the second quarter, only to [
e interrupted by an SC recovery '
112 Southwood's fumble. The visitors j
eturned the favor quite promptly,
owever, and tackle Lee Daley re
overed on the 2G to set up the sec
nd Red TD. Glen Crawford and ;
tugasian moved the ball downfield j
1 four play with Hustlin' Harry
mooting inside left end from the
ve lor the touchdown. Again Mc
oll's kick was wide.
A spectacular tackle by end Jack
ye on Trojan safety Harry Maloney
ut Jess Hill's lads in a deep dark
ole near the end of the first half,
hey punted, and the kick rolled
iad on the Stanford 40. Dick Horn
issed to wingman Wilbur Taylor on
ie 4G for a first down. Southwood !
it for seven to the 39, and then !
illback Charlie Brazel took off
ound left end like the proverbial
nil la and went all the way. A 15-
ird penalty put the ball back to
e 17. where McColl made good his j
st opportunity of the afternoon, |
e kick going 40 yards through the j
Pat Duff, the highly-publicized lad
am Oregon, gave proof of his press *

am's only touchdown after inter- i
pting a pass on the Stanford 44 !
rly in the second half. A com- '
eted pass put the ball on the 16. 1

a blaze of speed. Boyd Taylor's

ded, 19 to 7.
Backs Show Drive
In Southwood, Hugasian, Craw- j
rd. Horn, and Gary Kerkorian, |
nick Taylor fielded backs who !
owed more speed, drive, and |
iesse than any of the SC ball- J
ekers with the exception of Duff. !
it it was up front where the teeth j
*et the turf that the margin of |
(Terence between the two teams !
is conclusive.
Probably the outstanding factor !
is end play—in fact, there was j
me question among observers as j
whether the fine play of Chuck
ylor's wingmen, McColl. Bill
orum, Taylor, and Rye, con
buted more to the Card success
an did that of the SC ends. The
ojan right Hanker, obviously a
istrated tackle, played consistently
side on defense, and waved bon
yage to the Indians backs as they j
•ept his end time and time again. J
Linemen Shine
Gary Kirkorian and Dick Horn, \
ernating in running the Card at
k. both seemed to have overcome
e disadvantage of lack of practice. ,
■rkorian's signal calling was the
Uure of the first half, while
irn's passing and ball handling
>ked sharp throughout.
