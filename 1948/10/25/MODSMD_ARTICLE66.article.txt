# Stanford Tankmen Gain Revenge, Drown USC
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Led by the Indians' sharpshooter,
captain Harry Borchers, the Stan
lord water poloists scored a double
victory this weekend by clipping
Fullerton Junior College 5 to 3 Fri
day, and Southern Cal 7 to G Sat
urday at the Encina Pool.
It was sweet revenge for Coach
Haynie's Card team Saturday when
they turned back the all-powerful
Trojans. The men of Troy whipped
the Indians down at Los Angeles last
week 9 to 2, so the series is all tied
up at one game apiece. The Cards
and the Trojans now head the South
ern Division of the PCC with two
victories and one loss each.
Cards Start Fast
Stanford took an immediate lead
over Southern Cal. 3 to 1, as the
Cards' passes and defense could do
no wrong. Forward Harry Borchers
was the mainstay of the Indian at
tack as he poured through point af
ter point.
The "Haynie Machine" was in high
gear, especially in the second quar
ter when only one goal was scored
against them. Goalie Kim Fletcher,
who incidentally played consistently
all during the game, made save after
save during this crucial second quar
ter. Excellent defensive work was
also turned in by guards Ralph Sala.
Don Weeden, and Ken Fox, who kept
the Trojan scoring aces bottled up.
The score at half time was Bor
chers 5, Southern Cal 2. as the Card
scoring ace just couldn't bs stopped.
It looked like the Indians would run
up the score in the second half, but
the men of Troy had a different idea.
The second half was completely
reversed. The Cards were put on the
defensive by the highly touted Tro
jans, and at the end of the game were
fighting for their lives.
Troy forward ace Illsley scored two
quick goals, and the USC offense was
really rolling. In the second half,
Southern Cal won the sprint each

time, and controlled the ball for the
most part down at the Stanford goal.
Two excellent shots by forward
Fritz Maurer saved the game for
Stanford. With the score 6 to 5, he
fired a bullet-like shot into the cor
ner of the cage to cinch the game
lor Stanford. Behind 7 to 5 with a
minute left to play, the Trojans ral
lied valiantly with a final score, but
it was too late to turn the tire. The
final gun sounded with the score 7
to G.
Fullerton Falls
Friday's game against Fullerton
Junior College was much less nerve
wracking. The Indians were in com
mand from start to finish as they
trimmed the Hornets 5 to 3.
It was Borchers again who started
the fireworks in the first half, as the
Cards took at 3 to 1 lead. However,
it was definitely not a push-over
game. Fullerton is one of the best
junior college teams in the country
and could hold its own against most
college teams. The Southern Cal
squad this year is loaded with former
Fullerton talent.
The Hornets for a moment in the
second half were trailing by only one
point, but a Maurer score again set
tled the issue as the Indians won 5
to 3. Card point-makers were: Bor
chers, two goals; Maurer, two; and
Hub Stokely, one.
In other games this weekend, the
California Bears edged Fullerton 5
to 4 but lost to the Trojans 10 to 3.
It looks like a race between Stanford,
the defending champion, and South
ern Cal.
In a non - conference battle this
Thursday, the revived Stanfords
challenge San Jose Slate here at En
cina Pool. The Spartans crushed
Stanford 8 to 4 in their last meeting
up at the Olympic Club pool, and
thus grabbed the Junior Water Polo
title. The Indians hope to even the
score Thursday at 3:30 p.m.
