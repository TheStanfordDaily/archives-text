# 'Old Boy' Strikes Farm Wednesday
## 
### 
Enjoy wine, women, and sing vi
cariously—read the Chaparral!
The Chappie will be sold Wednes
day by a group of gorgeous fresh
man women on the corners of the
Quad and in front of the Union
and the Post Office,
This month's Chappie will help
eliminate a lot of frosh confusion
about some of the great old Farm
traditions which make Stanford, and
its women, what they are. The
Old Boy's Frosh Bible is a bit more
realistic and certainly more enter
taining than the standard version.
The Chappie's I.Q. test will reveal
how much you know about certain
extra-curricular phases of life on
the Farm. It's got lots of gags and
stories, too—really red-hot stuff.
Be sure to get yours Wednesday.
It will keep you smiling -all month.
