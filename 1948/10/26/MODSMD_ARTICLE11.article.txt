## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 25 (AP) —Russia's Andrei Y. Vishinsky tonight
vetoed the plan submitted by the six "neutral" members of the
United Nations Security Council for settling the Berlin dispute.
It was the Soviet Union's 28th veto and the second cast by
Vishinsky personally. The vote was 9 to 2, with Russia and the

Soviet Ukraine casting the lone
negative votes.
Strive for Peace
Argentine Foreign Minister Juan
Atilio Bramuglia, acting president
of the Council, told newsmen, "I
will keep on trying to get a peace
ful settlement." He spoke for the
five other "neutrals"—China, Syria,
Belgium, Canada, and Colombia—
as well as his own country.
"I am sure," Bramuglia said
"neither of the parties wants t<
reach the worst now. And it is m;
duty to try to bring them to ar
agreement. Their differences hav
been very much ironed out so fa
and they may still be brought to .
coincidence in viewpoints."
Major Stumbling Block
The discussions just before th,
vote disclosed that the major stick
ing point between Russia and tlu
Western Powers is: "When will the
Russian blockade of Berlin be lift
ed and when will the Russian mark
be made the currency for all fout
sectors in Berlin?
Dr. Philip C. Jessup, U.S. dele
gate. told the Council that respon
sibility for stopping Council action
rested solely upon the Soviet Un
ion.
Currency Problem
The vetoed resolution proposer
that Russia and the Western pow
ers lift all restrictions on communi
cations with Berlin as soon as the
four governments had been notified
that the resolution was adopted.
•It also provided that at the same
moment the military governors 01
the four powers in Berlin would
begin negotiations aimed at making
the Soviet currency the single
money for all of Berlin. The cur
rency arrangement would go into
effect by Nov. 20. The final provi
sion called for a meeting of the
Council of Foreign Ministers by
Nov. 30 for a discussion of the
whole German problem.
The Western powers refused to
negotiate on the currency issue
until the blockade is lifted; Russia
refused to raise the restrictions
until the currency agreement actu
ally is in effect.
