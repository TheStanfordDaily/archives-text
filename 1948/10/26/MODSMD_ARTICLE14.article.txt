Acht un g , despised freshmen!
When walking on Quad, have you
noticed upperclassmen scowl at you
with that "Ha-ha-I-know-you're
only-a-frosh" look?
For the absolutely ridiculous
price of 25 cents, the Old Boy will
remedy this revolting situation. To
be brief, read the Chappie! It may
give you a gray beard and pickle
your liver, but at least you'll look
mature.
And we wish to stress this point:
Reading the Chaparral is not
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard; it really should be, but
Dean Kimpton and President Eu
rich read the rag, and after all,
wouldn't they look silly standing in
front of the Honor Code Commit
tee?
So scamper down to Quad Wed
nesday and get a Chappie. They'll
be stacked by our salesgirls on the
four corners of Quad and by the
Union and the Post Office.
You too can partake of all the
more prominent vices which would
normally cost at least $25 for only
25 cents bv reading Chappie. Fun,
huh?
