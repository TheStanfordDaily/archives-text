# "The United States Is Tremendous"

"The United States is tre
mendous, to use the favorite
word going around the cam
pus," said Lilia Agrava Villa in
her Filipino accent when inter
viewed last week. "Everything
is so efficient."
Lilia Villa (pronounced Leel
ya Veelya, with the accents on
the ee's) is an attractive young
Filipino teacher now in the first
month of her one-year Cap and
Gown scholarship. Cap and Gown,
senior women's honorary society,
had given this scholarship to Ameri
cans until this year, when the so
ciety decided to bring someone over
from abroad. The scholarship was
sent to the president of the Uni
versity of the Philippines who gave
it to Lilia Villa.
Lilia had been thinking of going
to Columbia until Cap and Gown
offered her such a good deal at
Stanford. She still intends to visit
New York before returning home.
Fellowship Award
Other good deals include a fel
lowship from the University of the
Philippines itself, and a possible re
imbursement by the United States
of the cost of her transportation,
through the authority of the Ful
bright Act, a law providing for the
exchange of students between the
United States and foreign countries.
Lilia is majoring in English, which
is the subject she taught at the

Philippine Women's University. She
also teaches Tagalog, the Philippine
national language, and Japanese,
which she picked up at the YWCA
and then taught because it was re
quired in the school curriculum
during the occupation.
She instructed the Gls at the
Philippine Armed Forces Institute
in Tagalog and Japanese, she says.
The soldiers gave her many pres
ents, such as the Parker 51 which
she still carries in her purse.
Study and Observation
The Cap and Gown scholarship
asked for someone to come over "to
study and to observe." So Lilia
plans to do plenty of observing. One
thing she has already noticed about
Stanford is that "there is a lot going

on around campus—there are many
activities. And everybody goes out
for them. With all this going on.
are the students still able to study,
to get down to the bottom of their
subjects, to master them?"
"If so, they must be very smart."
Criticism of U.S.
When asked if she could offer a
criticism of the United States, Lilia
naturally hemmed and hawed.
Pressed, she finally began, "Well,
how shall I say it? ....
"It seems funny that over here,
in spite of all the time-saving de
vices, everybody seems to be in a
hurry."
"Of course, there are two sides to
it," added Lilia, after consideration.
"You can be hurrying for nothing;
or you can be hurrying to get some
thing done.
"I guess people over here are
hurrying to get something done
That must be why the United
I States has produced so much for
j the world."
Foreign Relations
I When the subject of United
{ States-Philippine relations came up
and Lilia was asked if Filipinos feel
they aren't getting enough help from
the United States, she said:
"Yes, I'm afraid they do feel that
way. But preferential tariff rates
have been drawn up for the next
two decades. The Philippines
shouldn't feel that the United States
owes them anything. Now that they
are independent, they should learn
to help themselves. They must
stand on their own feet."

Study and Observation
The Cap and Gown scholarship
asked for someone to come over "to
study and to observe." So Lilia
plans to do plenty of observing. One
thing she has already noticed about
Stanford is that "there is a lot going

"If so, they must be very smart."
Criticism of U.S.
When asked if she could offer a

naturally hemmed and hawed.
Pressed, she finally began, "Well,
how shall I say it? ....
"It seems funny that over here,
in spite of all the time-saving de

hurry."
"Of course, there are two sides to
it," added Lilia, after consideration.
"You can be hurrying for nothing;
or you can be hurrying to get some
thing done.
"I guess people over here are
hurrying to get something done
That must be why the United

Foreign Relations
I When the subject of United

and Lilia was asked if Filipinos feel
they aren't getting enough help from
the United States, she said:
"Yes, I'm afraid they do feel that
way. But preferential tariff rates
have been drawn up for the next
two decades. The Philippines
shouldn't feel that the United States
owes them anything. Now that they
are independent, they should learn
to help themselves. They must
stand on their own feet."
