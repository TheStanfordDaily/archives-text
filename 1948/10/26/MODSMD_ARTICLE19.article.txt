# 'Homecomer' Causes Flurry
## 
### 
Last weekend was Homecoming
all right, but one celebrator came
back to the wrong home.
The mistake was made by an un
identified man who climbed the fire
escape to the open sleeping porch
of Hurlburt House, Sunday morn
ing at 3.
The intruder was greeted by five
ar six girls who watched in aston
ishment as he climbed over the
porch railing and wove his way to
the door, stumbling over beds and
saying cheerfully, "Wake up! It's
morning!"
At the head of the stairs he met
_i late retirer. He gallantly offered
her a cigarette. When the girl de
manded to know what he was doing
there, he explained, "I must have
gotten into the wrong house. How
do I get out of here?"

The astonished girl guided him
to the front door while several oi
! the sleeping porch occupants i'ol
i lowed behind them, and another
girl called the police.
When the police arrived, they re
ceived varied descriptions of the
caller, but no explanation for the
call.
It may have been the campus
presentations of Shakespeare that
influenced the early morning Ro
meo to climb to the porch-balcony:
however, some of the Hurlburt girls
believe that the intruder was under
the influence of something stronger
than Shakespeare.
Or as one of the girls said as she
went back to bed, "Perhaps no one
told him that we had our open
house from 6 to 7 p.m. yesterday."
