# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Editor's Notebook 
### 
The British-Stanford Debate drew a capacity audience to Cub
berley Auditorium Friday night. We were slightly bowled over
1o see that much interest in a debate. So were the debaters.
John Hines, manager, said the crowd was the result of these
factors: 1) interest in the subject (planned economy); 2) it was the
first British debate team to appear here in many years, and 3)
proper publicity.
Whatever the reason, it was gratifying to see the debate draw
well in competition with dances and the Peninsula hot spots.
Dick Kelton said he was overwhelmed to see that a public exer
cise without "sex" in it would do so well.

Stanford's Notary Public says she is too busy to notarize
absentee ballots and students must take them uptown. Granted,
she is busy. Nevertheless, Stanford is a separate community,
and it is the logical place for papers or ballots to be notarized.
If it is at all possible, students should be extended the notary
service especially if they are citizenship-wise enough to cast
an absentee ballot.

Initials at the end of the editorials have been discontinued this
year because editorials in The Daily are the consolidated expres
sion of the editorial board.

One of the hardest things for minority groups to understand
is that it is no fairer to put the majority at the disadvantage of
ihe minority than vice versa.
People who plague The Daily to give more editorial expression
to their great missions are usually from two groups. First, there
are the small groups who want to preach a new gospel of some
sort. When we ask them how many people they represent, they
reply, 30. We then patiently explain that The Daily is pub
lished in the intefest of 8,000 students.
A second group is composed of malcontents who want to use
the"Letters to the Editor" column for their personal trouble
making and name-calling. When we refuse to take their letters,
they cry, "the paper is being dictated by the administration,"
the editor is not fearless enough to print 'the truth'," etc., ad
nauseum.
NUTS!
