# BILL DAILEY
## Bull Session 
### 
1 was walking along the other day (as Jimmy Durante would say, "just
commuting with nature") when one of the local sows grabbed me by the
;.rm. Twisting it up behind my back, she said: "Listen, festerhead, would
you mind telling me something?"
"If you'll stop twisting my arm, I'll be happy to," I returned in my

most Edward G. Robinsonish voice.
"What I want to know is just where in hell does
a skin head like you get off saying that us Stanford
girls are a bunchapigs?"
"Don't you mean 'we Stanford girls'?" I corrected,
rubbing my arm.
"Don't get smart, you poor man's poor man! Just
tell me what the big idea is. I'm getting pretty tired
of hearing you wise guys pop off about how us Stan
ford girls aren't cute. Yes sir, pretty tired!"
"You may be getting tired, but you're not getting
pretty," sezzi, slipping in a verbal jab.

"Never mind making with the jokes, Pagliacci, just tell me how a guy
with a face like you've got can make cracks about how ugly anyone is.
And another thing, lay off the funnies about the way us girls dress.
You guys wouldn't know good clothes if you saw them. As far as I'm con
cerned, Stanford men buy their clothes in only two sizes .... too big and
too small. They are either so big that they fit you like last year's shorts, or
so small that they look like they were picked too soon!"
"But . . . (That last word was me.)
"So if you got any more ideas about getting smart in that column of
yours, buster, just forget 'ein!"
"But . . . (Me again.)
"I said forget 'em, Jack. So long."
"But . . . ." (Guess who?)

"I said forget 'em, Jack. So long."
"But . . . ." (Guess who?)
