That "spontaneous" cheering and
waving of pom-poms that broke out
in the Card rooting section before
the USC game was for the benefit
ol an MGM cameraman. The scenes
will be used in this week's release
of News of the Day, if Hollywood

Curious, like most other students
who go to the post office, we asked
an SAE why the door of the first
Row house is purple. The "on rec
ord" reply was that it is one of the
fraternity's colors, but he informed
us in a lower voice that it also made
the front entrance easier to find
late at night when things seem to
swim before one's eyes.

Administration officials returned
to their desks last Friday morning
with a visible expression of relief.
Roble was still intact and there was
scarcely a visible record that the
frosh Pajamarino had been staged
the night before. Credit goes to the
usual student committees, plus one
composed of members of the class
of '51 who met after last year's riot
to make sure that this year's frosh
would have a Pajamarino.

The University, along with every
pay check, might do well to give
each instructor a free clothes brush.
An ambitious lecturer is always
marked by the amount of chalk he
collects on his suit from leaning
against the blackboard.

Note on the younger generation:
The Chi P.si's house decorations fea
turing an Indian pushing upon a
structure of obviously profound
tradition drew a wondering glance
from a young lad whose training
had been strictly confined to a
modern home. No doubt his par
ent donned a striking cardinal when
he asked in a well - heard voice,
"Mommy, what's a Troylet?"

Student-faculty relations reached
a new high in an English 2b class
the other day, but not without em
barrassment to the instructor. To
the class's amusement, it became
established during the reading of a
composition that one of the stu
dents and the instructor had been
taking out the same girl. Feeling
between the two remained good,
however, when after the class the
student. In return for some advice
on the composition, coached the in
structor on the best method to get
the girl's car started when it stalled.

Saturday's post-game band sere
nade to the team outside the gym
has the makings of a fine tradition
—if the rooters care to follow
through. From the field the student
body could follow the band and join
them in the victory song. With the
yell leaders on hand, a post-game
rally can be staged on the spot.

With midterms coming up thick
and fast again, we are reminded of
the true - false quiz placed before
the Sociology I students last spring.
The last statement confirmed the
prevailing opinion about the course:
to wit, "Midget bookkeepers arc the
little things that count."

Student-faculty relations reached
a new high in an English 2b class
the other day, but not without em
barrassment to the instructor. To
the class's amusement, it became
established during the reading of a
composition that one of the stu
dents and the instructor had been
taking out the same girl. Feeling
between the two remained good,
however, when after the class the
student. In return for some advice
on the composition, coached the in
structor on the best method to get
the girl's car started when it stalled.

Saturday's post-game band sere
nade to the team outside the gym
has the makings of a fine tradition
—if the rooters care to follow
through. From the field the student
body could follow the band and join
them in the victory song. With the
yell leaders on hand, a post-game
rally can be staged on the spot.

With midterms coming up thick
and fast again, we are reminded of
the true - false quiz placed before
the Sociology I students last spring.
The last statement confirmed the
prevailing opinion about the course:
to wit, "Midget bookkeepers arc the
little things that count."
That "spontaneous" cheering and
waving of pom-poms that broke out
in the Card rooting section before
the USC game was for the benefit
ol an MGM cameraman. The scenes
will be used in this week's release
of News of the Day, if Hollywood
approves.

Curious, like most other students
who go to the post office, we asked
an SAE why the door of the first
Row house is purple. The "on rec
ord" reply was that it is one of the
fraternity's colors, but he informed
us in a lower voice that it also made
the front entrance easier to find
late at night when things seem to
swim before one's eyes.

Administration officials returned
to their desks last Friday morning
with a visible expression of relief.
Roble was still intact and there was
scarcely a visible record that the
frosh Pajamarino had been staged
the night before. Credit goes to the
usual student committees, plus one
composed of members of the class
of '51 who met after last year's riot
to make sure that this year's frosh
would have a Pajamarino.

The University, along with every
pay check, might do well to give
each instructor a free clothes brush.
An ambitious lecturer is always
marked by the amount of chalk he
collects on his suit from leaning
against the blackboard.

Note on the younger generation:
The Chi P.si's house decorations fea
turing an Indian pushing upon a
structure of obviously profound
tradition drew a wondering glance
from a young lad whose training
had been strictly confined to a
modern home. No doubt his par
ent donned a striking cardinal when
he asked in a well - heard voice,
"Mommy, what's a Troylet?"
