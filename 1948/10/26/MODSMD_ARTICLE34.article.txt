To the Editor:
The open use of the term "Stan
ford Pin" strikes one new to this
campus is unfortunate. It must seem
to many that it is that kind of term
which steps out of the hounds of
Rood humor no matter how it is
used. It is hard to understand, for
example, how its public use at ral
lies fosters that student harmony
essential for school spirit. Then, too,
there must be many to whom the
connotations of the word "pig" clash
rather unhappily with those of
"Stanford."
I would like to suggest that frus
tration try to find other outlets.
