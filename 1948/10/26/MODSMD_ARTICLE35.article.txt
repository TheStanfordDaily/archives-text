# THE 						STANFORD SLANT
## Maritime Strike, Politics, Policies, and Personalities 
### 
The eight - week - old maritime
strike in San Francisco harbor is
a localization of troubles in policies,
politics, and personalities. In spite
of all the material published about
the strike, the picture is not com
pletely clear.
Stanford's director of the Division
of Industrial Relations of the Grad
uate School of Business, Professor
John P. Troxell, has tried to shed
some light on this difficult subject
in an interview for The Daily.
A few weeks ago (the day Wal
lace was visiting) Professor Trox
ell put in a day at the San Fran
cisco waterfront as a guest of the
union. At the waterfront Embarca
dero in the city, the union people
took him backstage of the long
shoremen's hiring hall.
There Professor Troxell bumped
into one of the important sub-is
sues inherent in the whole labor
controversy between the longshore
men and the union: the problem of
the selection of a dispatcher.
Strategical Job
The longshoremen's chief dis
patcher has the strategical job of
placement. He dispatches long
shoremen to fil! openings requested
by employers. The job is to spread
work around, but the dispatchers
owe allegiance to the union only,
and the employers say that no one
but a union member is dispatched.
This seems to go against the intent
of the Taft-Hartley Act provision
concerning elimination of the closed
shop. The union says in effect: "We
use our own judgment, and, at the
same time, try not to be prejudi
cial."
According to Troxell. union offi
cers expressed the fear that no dis
patcher other than one appointed
by the union would be impartial.
Yet, it would seem that a natural
criticism is obvious: a union - ap
pointed dispatcher is analogous to a
referee hired by one of two foot
ball teams.
Impartial Choice
"The referee should be chosen
by an impartial observer such as
the United States Conciliation
Service," Troxell said.
The union believes an impartial
dispatcher would owe allegiance to
two masters. This writer believes
that, to have it the union's way,
that officer would owe allegiance to
one master only. In this case the
general public is better served with
"two masters" in the picture: labor
and government (USCS).
The shipowners say they're will
ing to continue with a contract
maintaining the union dispatcher
subject to a decision of the Supreme
Court as to the legality of such an
appointment. The union says no.
It will be a union appointee or
none.
No Ordinary Dispute
"It seems pretty clear that this
is no ordinary labor dispute; hence
the usual processes, compromises,

face-saving formulas, and so on, arc
missing," Professor Troxell said.
"Nor are offers of mediation likely
lo be of any service. The leaders
on the two sides have a thorough
understanding of the other leaders'
aims and goals. It's not a case
wherein persuasion would be help
ful."
The professor believes that per
haps neither goal may be achieved.
"But each side is determined to
win. One leader said as the strike
began, 'When the fight is over, ci
ther they will be out of business,
or we will'."
Costs High to Pay
Professor Troxell believes the
costs are quite high to pay. "And
the intangible costs—both to the
parties involved and to the nation
are great. One of these—the effect
on American prestige in foreign
lands—is especially grim."
The shipowners refuse to dicker
with Longshore Boss Harry Bridg
es. Allan Haywood, CIO vice-pres
ident,.offered to have the CIO guar
antee the new contracts. The em
ployers refused. Bridges again.
Won't By-pass Bridges
Haywood refuses to let the own
ers by-pass Bridges' jurisdiction by
dealing with the national CIO offi
cers. "We don't do business that
way," Haywood said. "The fact is
inescapable that Bridges is a union
officer. The strike can be settled
. . . if the owners would sit down
and negotiate now."
Bridges offered to turn over the
negotiations to a rank - and - Hit
striking longshoremen's committee
and stay out of the parleys. Frank
Foisie, president of the Waterfront
Employers' Association, abruptly
rejected this idea. He wrote t(
Bridges: "The problem is the fu
ture administration and observance
of any contract. Your 14-year part\
line record of irresponsibility am
double-dealing proves that an>
contract which you and your lead
ership arc ultimately to administer
no matter how or by whom nego
tiated, is worthless."
Latest Chapter
The latest chapter to this stiiking
novel was penned by Bridges: "Om
membership, and the national CIO
is now aware that you are deter
mined to make the West Coast wa
terfront the battleground for tin
greatest industrial showdown in re
cent years."
According to Walter Wine-hell's
last Sunday broadcast, a postscript
chapter may have been written al
ready. According to the ABC cast
er it is rumored that the strike will
be settled within 10 days. The CK
national officers have threatened t<
go over the head of Harry Bridge
if he doesn't settle with the shij
operators within that time, saic
Winchell. If true, this woulil be .
direct reversal of the ClO's an
nounced position and would put the
labor bans out on a limb.
