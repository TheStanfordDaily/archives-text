# It's a Joke, Son!

### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
In memoriam to you, the stu
dent, we present this collection of
illegitimate brain - children (stolen
jokes, that is); but it's all jest in
fun:
To (he cross section of club ha
bitues we solemnly dedicate: "In
toxication is being sophisticated,
and not being able to pronounce
it." Orâ€”"l'm an old-fashioned girl.
It's my favorite drink."
For a'l newlywcds we have a
portion of: "E in deportment! Have
you been making passes at the
teacher again, dear?" . . . and . . .
"I think I have the answer, pro
fessor, if my wife will please not
interrupt me."
For the not-so-newlyweds: "How
did you get Junior to eat his olives,
dear?" "Simple, I started him on
martinis." Or "The little old lady
bent over the cradle. 'Ooh, I could
eat you, you look so sweet.' 'The
hell you could, you haven't any
teeth.' "
KSU has been having announcer
tryouts. So to them we give: "Did
you make that announcing job?"
"N-n-no. They s-s-said I w-w
-wasn't t-t-tall enough."
Card sharps and bridge enthu

siasts get for free: "So you've beei
to college! How high can yoi
count?" "1 - 2- 3- 4- 5-6-1
8 - 9 - 10 - jack - queen - king.''
For nobody in particular: "Thc\
went for a ride and all she did \v;u
shako her head. After ten milt
she told him her nose was caught ii
the windshield wiper.
And famous last words from I\< -
sotti's on a TGTIFCInh out in
"Good God, I forgot to leave nv
wallet at home."
