# Men vs. Women: Ratio-Minded Gents Dream of Wartime Dates
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Immediately after the regis
trar's office announced the fig
ures on fall guarter registration,
campus mathematicians set out
to determine the ratio of men
to women at Stanford. Grim as
they are, the results were
hardly surprising:
For every female student on
the Farm, there are three and
three-tenths males.
Time was, though, in the days of
khaki and bell bottom trousers,
when there was a woman for every
man and a little more besides.
Those were the days when women
predominated in the reserve book
loom of the Main Library and
formed a lion's share of the noon
lay parade that marches up the
Row. In those happy times, a man
was not a mere subdivision of a
voman's liberal education, but an
>qual among equals.
Veterans Still Exist
Although they are now prac
ically extinct, a few of the old
elics who were students here in
hat Utopian period are still to be
ound in fraternity houses and ob
eure dormitory rooms. They are
aisily identified as the men who re
ax in big leather chairs and only
runt or emit a snort of disgust
\hen the men of '50 bolt for the
vindows to whistle at a pretty pair
112 legs.
The stories they tell of "The
Jolden Age of Stanford Manhood"
pproach the fantastic proportions
112 Medieval legends even though
icy are backed up by reliable fact
nd testimony.
One "old man" likes to recall his
ays as a freshman in the Sigma
hi house, then a temporary dormi
>ry known as Garfield Hall. Next
oor were the Kappa Kappa Gam
las, the girls of the golden key,
ho have a nationwide reputation
U' being somewhat particular about
hom they are seen with in public
laces.
Through mutual arrangement an
lgenious pulley system with a box
ttached was strung up between the

Kappa house and the freshman's
room, enabling members of the two
living groups to exchange messages.
"Countless" dates were thus ar
ranged between freshman men and
Kappas of junior and senior stand
ing.
Taxi Service
Another story involves the boy
who was awarded two free meals at
Longbarn's for some extra-curricu
lar work done at the Stanford Con
valescent Home. Spotting a likely
date on Quad he asker her to join
him for dinner, but mentioned that
he had no means of transportation
and would require the use of her
automobile.
'"Okay," the girl agreed.
"Drop by the dorm about B,'' the
boy said.
True to her word the girl picked
up her date at the main entrance
of the dormitory that evening, and
away they sped to Longbarn's and
two free dinners.
Dates, in those days, were seldom
made more than one or two days
before the appointed time and few
of those by telephone. The com
mon procedure was to meet a girl
at the Cellar or one of the highway
nightspots and then to mention, in
the course of the conversation, some
plans for the coming weekend. The
nod was given and the date was
made. Three years later, in 1948.

the Stanford rough begins on Mon
day to plan for the weekend and
then wonders if he has delayed too
long.
As often as not dates were Dutch
treat, according to the old timers.
Many times a girl would slip a dol
lar or two into her escort's pocket
with the instructions that it be
used to pay for her share of the
beverages.
Beer Parties Popular
On other occasions, one of the
more fortunate roughs with a car
and gas besides would drive to a
girls' dormitory, enter the living
room and shout, "All out for Ros
softi's." From all corners of the
house the girls would come and it
was usually a group of 10 or 12 peo
ple that ended up at Pop's for an
afternoon beer.
"Those girls weren't especially
eager," these Farm oldsters will tell
you. "Just more like a gang of
girls you know at home. Boy, what
a party!"
Then they sigh and shake their
heads, sadly contemplating the ratio
as it is today. Their audience of
half-skeptical juniors rise from the
floor where they have been listen
ing to the tales of Stanford during
the war and go to the telephone to
make a date for two weeks hence.
Those happy, carefree days, they
know, are gone forever.
