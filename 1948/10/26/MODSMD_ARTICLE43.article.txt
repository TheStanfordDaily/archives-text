# VARSITY CAGERS
## Basketball Squad Cut to 35; 'Braves,' New Name for JV's 
### 
Coach Everett Dean announced
his first squad cut yesterday as var
sity basketball rolled into its sec
ond week of practice. The initial
cut sliced the squad down from 70
to 35 men, with 10 more of the
present number scheduled to get
the axe sometime next week when
mentor Dean takes the final count.
Coach Dean stated that he will
keep 25 men as a regular working
squad. To get the number of men
down to normal size, the headman
has been sending all the players
through extensive scrimmage drills
since practice opened last week.
Every man has had a chance to
show his stuff.
Included among the present 35
squadsmen are most of last year's
/arsity players, several up from the
JV's, and the first two teams from
year's frosh. There are also
some junior college transfers pres
ent.
New Squad, New Name
Dean figures to use the last 13
varsity men as a JV team. The
squad will be called the BRAVES,
a name which the players selected
themselves. It has received an of
ficial b'ue light, so the Braves come
into being, complete yith a 19-game
schedule and two coaches, probably
Phil Bengtson and Jdck Meredith.
The brand new Braves will play
the Cal Blues, Marin JC (last year's
national junior college champ),
Menlo JC, and several other top
flight two-year schools.
The Braves will open the season

on Nov. 23 against the Stanford
frosh as a preliminary to the vau-»
sity opener against the Stanford
alumni.
Start Serious Work
The varsity hoopsters will get
down to more serious work this
week. Since practice opened, most
of the old hands have been working
outdoors. They have run cross
country, skipped rope, danced
through various cage capers that
resemble calisthenics, and have
gone all out to get their wind in
shape for the coming campaign.
Now, they will start handling the
ball. The men surviving the first
cut are as follows:
T. S. Ary, Dave Atcheson, Gay
Bryan, Ralph Carver, Gus Chava
