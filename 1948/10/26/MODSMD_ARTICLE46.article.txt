# BOWLING ...
## Is It Sport's Oldest Game? 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
Bowling is as old as the hills . . .
actually. Bowling originated in
Egypt, we hear, as early as or ear
lier than 5200 B.C. Archeologists
have found in the grave of an
Egyptian child all the implements
for playing a game that must have
been very similar to our modern
ten-pins.
Nine centuries ago the church
men of Germany started the game
in earnest, though. After spending
most of the day at studying and in
devotion, these members of the
Bishop's Council used to gather for
recreation at the arcade of the ca
thedral cloister and set up a pin.
Then they would hand a stone ball
to the parishioners and invite them
to roll it at the distant pin, called a
heathen.
The idea was that if a person
scored a clean hit he was living an
exemplary life, but if he missed—
he went to Stanford. Martin Lu
ther, the rough and ready Saxon
friar who promoted the Protestant
Reformation, changed the game to
nine pins in the form of a diamond
in 1517 and called the game Kcgel
spiel, from which the modern term
"kegling" comes.
But it remained for the Dutch to
introduce the game to America, in
1623. The original plot of the first
bowling green, on lower Broadway,
is still untouched — though sur
rounded by skyscrapers. The game
made such an impression that eight
towns and a New Jersey mountain
are called Bowling Green.
In the 19th century a law was
passed against the game of nine
pins. Thus the game of ten-pins
was introduced, a very clever
dodge. The National Bowling As
sociation in 1875 set up the first
regulations governing size of the
alleys . . . and they have remained
thus to the present.
Currently there are about 15 mil
lion bowlers in the United States
alone. And some of them get pretty
fair. Hank Marino of Milwaukee
registered ten perfect 300 games in
an ABC meet. Try that on your
alley sometime.

nine pins in the form of a diamond
in 1517 and called the game Kcgel
spiel, from which the modern term
"kegling" comes.
But it remained for the Dutch to
introduce the game to America, in
1623. The original plot of the first
bowling green, on lower Broadway,
is still untouched — though sur
rounded by skyscrapers. The game
made such an impression that eight
towns and a New Jersey mountain
are called Bowling Green.
In the 19th century a law was
passed against the game of nine
pins. Thus the game of ten-pins
was introduced, a very clever
dodge. The National Bowling As
sociation in 1875 set up the first
regulations governing size of the
alleys . . . and they have remained
thus to the present.
Currently there are about 15 mil
lion bowlers in the United States
alone. And some of them get pretty
fair. Hank Marino of Milwaukee
registered ten perfect 300 games in
an ABC meet. Try that on your
alley sometime.
