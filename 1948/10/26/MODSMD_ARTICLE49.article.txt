Football games are one thing to some people and quite another to others,
"i'ke Saturdays fracas, for example. To a non-Stanfordite the game had
verything—dropped passes, goal line stands, spectacular tackles and so on.
wo big looting sections to provide game sidelights with their yells and
• id stunts, should more than suffice lor the wife that comes along just
> please hubby, or the co-ed who thinks that Rupe Andrews is just the
utest thing she has ever seen in a football uniform.
A 7 to (5 ball game, the likes of that which was staged Saturday, affects
u> two particpating teams in different ways. Hie winner is very happy,
i a rule. He has won, not by much, of course, but the win is there.
For the loser it is a much different situation. In some cases, such as
iiturday, the losing team may have gained more yardage, and first downs,
hey scored as often as the winners, but they lost. One point. The try
-r-point after touchdown.
That one little point. But for a football that wandered from the straight
id narrow path the losing team would be a tieing team. What a dif
rence a point makes.
A Tie Game Settles Nothing
A tied game isn't the most satisfying thing in the world. It wreaks havoc
i the parlay card players when the game is rated a tossup. It causes
oi'tswriters to have to mention the fact that Such and Such School has
on so many games, lost so many, and tied one.
But the losers are tie-ers and that means a lot. Let's jump back to
iturday's game once again. Stanford lost to a good USC team. But for
few breaks, they might well have been the winners. Fumbles hurt as
d (hopped passes, but the Cards put on a finish that left most of the
,000 fans limp. The same thought must have occurred to most of these
ople when the Indians found themselves on the SC 16-yard line—#l
ids from the point they took over.
Joe Alumni could see the headlines, "Cards Win With 97-Yard Drive."
hat a Homecoming! But the Cards didn't get that last TD. Joe didn't
el so badly, though. "That was a good game," he muses, "we put on a
lluva fight, should've won."
In fact, most of the students have the same thought. Some of them think
ough of their boys to come to the dressing room to show the team how
?y feel.
Fans' Memories Are Short
But time dulls most memories. Two weeks from now the memories
just how close th» Reds were to winning will be fogged. By the end
the season the contest will be just another loss to be tallied -in with
~ season's record. Some will remember that the game could have gone
? other way very easily, but for the most part the game is forgotten
th the coming of a new sport. By next year the Stanford-USC game
s lost its identity in a jumble of statistics.
kmemler the USC game last year? The Cards went to LA underdogs
some 24 points. They met and held what was thought to be an
'incible Trojan team to 14 points. In doing so they won the praise of
jryone who saw the game. The same thing happened in the Oregon
ite game. A fighting Red Machine lost after meeting a team that had
>n boomed as the best on the Coast in pre-season talk.
\nd who can forget the Big Game of 1947. This time it was a three
iversion margin. If you have a newspaper of the Sunday following
t game handy, dig it out. The writers pulled all the plugs on the
ectives for that one. It was referred to as the biggest Big Game of
time. A 26-point underdog played Cal off its feet, won the Battle of
tistics, but lost by three points.
Jut a loss is just that—a loss. Three months later writers and fans
erred to Stanford as the team that lost nine games out of nine. That's
No mention of the close ones. They lost—period.
hat is the way it has been for years and there is no reason to think
I it will change. Football has outgrown the stage of a college sport,
j emphasis is on the ability to win. Get the players, it doesn't make
ch difference how you get 'em, and win. No excuses, we want a win!
t is indeed gratifying to see a school that puts the game on a higher
ne. Sure, everybody wants a winner, but to be able to take losses in
de is a very admirable quality.
