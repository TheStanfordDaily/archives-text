# '52 Men Drill For JC Game
## 
### 
The frosh were whooping it up j
011 the practice field yesterday as |
they ran signal drills under the !
eyes of Coach Chuck Taylor and I
his assistants, Crunch Crane, Dick {
Madigan, and Marty Felcman. Fired
with their 19-7 pasting of Troy's
vaunted yearlings Saturday, they
ran plays with an enthusiasm that
belied the fact that it was Monday
afternoon.
Despite the squad's showing
against SC, however, Taylor had a
hint of worry in his eye as he sent
his charges through their first
workouts in preparation for their
meeting with Menlo JC next Sat
urday. "The boys played a fine first I
half against SC. but as far as the
second half is concernedâ€”no com
ment," said the coach, who looks to
be headed for his second conference
crown in as many years of coaching
at Stanford.
Taylor has good reason for worry,
moreover, inasmuch as the Bull
dogs have one of the most phenom- !
enal records in JC annals. Having !
won the Northern Division JC j
championship last year, they're on
the same track again this season,
being undefeated so far.
The Cards emerged from the SC
fracas with no disabling injuries
whatever, a fact that speaks well
for the team's condition.
