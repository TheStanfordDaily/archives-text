Halloween weekend will provide
campus witches and goblins a
chance to attend several open house
dances. Although most of the fra
ternities have scheduled closed
parties, Union Residence and En
cina Hall will hold open dances.
An all-campus date or no-date
open house is planned by the Un
ion Units for Friday night after the
Washington game rally. There will
be dancing to records in the main
lobby, ping pong in the court, and
bridge in the residence living room.
Cokes, hot dogs, and ice cream
will be served throughout the eve
ning. There will be entertainment
about 10 p.m. according to Mari
beth Harelson, dance chairman.
The dance will close at midnight.
Members of the dance committee
include Maribeth Harelson, chair
man; Ann Hinsdale, publicity; Mar
dan Morrow, Joan Sanders, Noemi
Tornke, Peggy Buhlic, Fritzie Her
man, Shirley Preston, and Jackie

Krasne, house representatives.
Encina freshmen will give their
dates a scare on Saturday night
when they jump on their brooms
for the first house dance. Hoop-a
la Howard Fredericks and his mu
sical Black Cats will furnish the
music.
The frosh are promising top
notch treats if the dancers don't
play tricks. Door prizes will be
awarded and free masks will be
passed out to all ghosts who fail to
pass the "witch-look" test. Tickets
can be obtained for $1.80 from En
cina wing social chairmen.
A Halloween party, featuring
dancing and refreshments, will be
given by the Newman Club. Catho
lic students' organization, Thursday
