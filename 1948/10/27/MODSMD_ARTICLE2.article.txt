# FRENCH STRIKE
## Miner Dies, 400 Arrested In Battle With Soldiers 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 2G (AP) â€”Coal mine strikers opened fire with
machine guns and potato-masher grenades on soldiers today,
the government announced. The troops retaliated with tanks and
firearms.
A miner was killed, and eight other persons, including a

* woman and four soldiers, were
badly wounded in the brief, bloody
battle. Officials arrested 400 persons
accused of bearing arms.
The fight took place when troops
moved to occupy four mines near
Ales, an industrial city of 40,000
about 50 miles northwest of Mar
seille, and encountered a strikers'
roadblock on the banks of the Garon
River.
Reports from the scene said at
least one tank fired a 25-millimeter
shell in a dawn downpour of rain
to destroy the miners' barricade
erected before the pit. Later, tanks
were used to shoo away strikers
who had surrounded public build
ings in Ales itself.
Several of the troops' casualties
were reported by the government to
have been caused by the explosion
of several mines as the soldiers ap
proached the pitheads.
In Marseille, a stronghold of Com
munist labor, metal workers, dock
workers, and trolley car and bus
drivers went on strike in sympathy
with the miners.
