# Final Orders for Frosh Book On Sale Tomorrow at Cellar
## 
### 
The Frosh Book, containing pictures of the class of '52, will
go to press tomorrow. Upperclassmen who wish a copy of the
book should order it now at the Quad office or at the Quad table
in front of the Cellar, as very few extra copies will be printed.
Tomorrow is also the last day for freshmen to order the book J

t if they have not already done so.
Meanwhile, senior pictures are \
being taken at the Quad office from |
10-12 a.m. and 1-5 p.m. Women are |
asked to wear white blouses and j
| men to wear coats and ties; the pic- i
tures cost $1.03 each.
The rest of this week will be
especially devoted to the school of j
social sciences, but any senior who i
missed his scheduled day can come i
to the Quad office and be photo- j
graphed until Friday.
To clarify some confusion among
the law students, the Quad an
nounces that they will include in j
| the senior section both those who
! are graduating from the law school
| and those who are taking pre-law j
j and expect to enter the school of
i law next year.
It is expected that all senior plc
[ tures for the 1949 Quad will be fin
ished by Friday. None will be taken
j later in the year, so all those stu
j dents who wish to be in the senior
| section this year must have their j
j pictures taken now. This applies to !
11 anyone expecting to graduate next
summer quarter, as well as fall, !
i winter, and spring graduates.
