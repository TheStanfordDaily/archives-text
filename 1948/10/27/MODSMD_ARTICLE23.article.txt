# Barclay Views Dewey, Truman, Wallace Aims

### JOHN SUTTHOFF 
The major Presidential candi
dates and their parlies were scruti
nized as they headed down the
homestretch, in a lecture last night
by Dr. Thomas S. Barclay, Stanford
professor of political science and
Democratic party leader.
In scanning the Republican posi
tion Dr. Barclay observed, "Gov
-1 ernor Dewey and his team have
j formulated a plan to keep the cam-
I paign on what is vaguely but im
| pressively called a high policy lev
j el." He was critical of the GOP
I campaign theme of "unity, prosper
ity, and the grandeur of America."
Dr. Barclay pictured Dewey as
having greatly matured since 1944,
| and as being confident and deter
mined, but less smug than four
years ago.
Focusing on the Democratic po

| sition, the professor said that tlv_
j 1948 strategy was one developed
| largely by Truman. The chief ob-
I ject of Truman's attacks centered
! mainly against the Republican 80th
i Congress, in which the Democrats
are constantly challenging the Re
| publicans to answer their charges.
In viewing the new Progressive
j party of Henry Wallace, the polili
| cal scientist asserted it was his be
; lief that Wallace's basic strategy
jto picture both major parties as
i being at the extreme reactionary
rightâ€”has failed.
Although Truman may be de
; prived of 35 electoral votes by the
Dixiecrats, the importance of their
break, Dr. Barclay said, lies in the
I possibility that Republican inroads
may develop sufficient vitality to
j establish and maintain a two-party
i system.
