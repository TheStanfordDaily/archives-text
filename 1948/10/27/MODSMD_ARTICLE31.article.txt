## Overly Pious Council 
### 
There are people—two members of Women's Council, and
other interested parties—who are seriously considering placing
the fundamental standard under the Honor Code. Their avowed
purpose is to give official weight to certain instructions issued
:o freshman women. If you're in the dark, freshman women are
asked to report any drinking at dances, either at fraternity houses
or in the halls, the theory being that it is part of the third person
responsibility of the Honor Code.
That the Honor Code should be extended to any realm other
than the academic is absurd and unworkable.
But the forcing of women to policemen or tale bearers at
dances they attend is even more ridiculous. Stanford women—
as all college women—go to parties for fun, and to learn how
to get along socially on a level a little more sophisticated than
high school. Having them report any drinking, punch spiking,
or what have you just sets them back several years.
You can't legislate against human nature. As long as men
and women go to parties at Stanford, there'll be a little discreet
tippling.
Council's whole attitude towards Stanford women lately seems
to be one of distrust that the women can conduct themselves
properly. Some of the recent Council hearings have had more
the air of an Inquisition than a review of a simple lockout.
If drinking or misconduct were terribly widespread, Council
would certainly be justified in their extreme position. But the
fact, as all rational people know, is that Stanford women are'
pretty well-behaved. We are confident of their ability to look
after themselves for the most part. We expect their parents are,
too. They expect intelligent guidance for their daughters at
the University—but not the making of tale-bearers of them, or
an overly-pious attitude of Women's Council.
