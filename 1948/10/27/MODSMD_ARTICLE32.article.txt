# JACK LITTLE
## Bull Session 
### 
Stopped by the Top o' the War Libe yesterday for an afternoon cock
tail (bring your own mix), and there was my old friend Henry.
"How's tricks, Henry?" sez I, hauling him back over the railing and
taking the lead weights oft his belt. "Whereve you been keeping your
self?"

Henry finally slops struggling when I get (he blind
fold ofY, but I can see he's not happy.
"I'm unhappy, 1 ' sez Henry.
"Why?" sez I, thinking real fast. "What's the
trouble?"
"No date for Big Game Night," moans Henry,
slipping the lead weights back on his belt and starting
for the railing.
"Wait, Henry .... there must be some mistake!"

I gently clobber him behind the left car with a length of lead pipe, and
we sit down to talk things over.
"Look," I say, "any girl would be thrilled to go out with the third vice
president of the Geography Club. And besides, you tried out for Rally
Com .... don't forget that."
"It just doesn't help," sez Henry. "Prestige doesn't mean a thing.
Some durn fool told 'em there were three men for every gal around here,
and they're holding out for the best offer."
"But, Henry," I chortle, "that can't be. Everybody's been telling 'em
they were lucky to have dates at all ... . that they were a bunch of pigs.
They're supposed to be nice and friendly now .... real sweet kids."
"But it didn't work out that way," Henry groans. "They don't have
much of a sense of humor .... too busy figuring out who they'll have a
date with three weeks from now. One gal lost her date calendar and
three guys have been waiting in the Branner lobby for two weeks."
"What'll we do?" sez I. "We can't admit they're great gals .... we'd
never hear the last of it."
"But what am I gonna do about Big Game Night?"
Don't worry about a thing, Henry .... I'll get you a date for next
year's party."
Henry nuzzled my hand gratefully.

NUFF SAID DEPARTMENT
One of "the boys" walked into Cardinals meeting last week and sug
gested they all adjourn and attend the "sex talk" on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
"No thanks," sez another one of the boys, "those are always dull."
"Just because you're pinned . . . ." was the comeback.

WIN A FEW, LOSE A FEW DEPARTMENT
One of those charming (no sarcasm) Branner lasses, we'll call her Judy,
was awaiting her date Friday night. The buzzer sounded and she
tripped lightly downstairs, but there was no sign of her date. Finally,
some fella she's never seen before walked over and said
"Are you Judy?"
She was. She figured her date had sent a fraternity brother to pick
her up, being unavoidably delayed. Okay, off they go.
Naturally, our girl soon discovered her escort wasn't the fraternity
brother, and she wasn't the Judy he was looking for.
