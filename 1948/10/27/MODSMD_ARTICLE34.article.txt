# Ya Can't Win

It's like Ohio State Prof Joseph
Russell Taylor once said: "There's
no use bringing your notebooks to
write down what I say, for I may
change my mind tomorrow." Ya
can't win!

Ya can't even win in Hollywood
if you are healthy. A show called
"The Boy with Green Hair" called
for sickly, undernourished-looking
children to portray war orphans.
But on the other hand, kids have
to be healthy to get work permits.
Checkmate!
And in his first screen appear
ance Larry Parks got second billing
to a camel. The camel got $50 a
day; Larry got $3. There's no jus
tice. And what's this rot about
dumb animals?

In Harrismith, South Africa, a
torrential downpour washed out an
open-air prayer meeting that had
been called to pray for rain.

And this is the Army, Mr. Jones:
With a horde of men I drive a jeep;
with a mob of chaps I try to sleep.
An army accompanies me to mess;
a platoon's around me when I
dress.
With a company I eat and play;
with a regiment I drill all day.
Men to left and men to right; men
around me day and night.
The Army—l can take it, but
The iron that stabs my bones they
call me PRIVATE Jones!

A World War II vet named Pete
Gaalswyk bought a tractor for his
Minnesota farm sight unseen from
the War Assets Administration.
Now he learns it is in Honolulu.
His problem turned out OK,
though. He checked with railway
and steamship companies and found
that it would actually cost less to
have it. shioped from Hawaii than
from the West Coast direct. Score
one!

But I still insist ya can't win or
dinarily. Take the elevator man in
Frisco. He got so weary of re
peated requests for the time, he put
a clock in his elevator. Now people
constantly ask him if his clock is
right.

This one is enough to make a
pessimist of any man. Bob Carvil
in Scotland swam the River Clyde
in a blinding snowstorm to win a
bet. But he lost. He swam the
river all right, but the civil court
fined him $8 for causing a breach
of the peace.
And a paint contractor in San
Rafael won a court case wherein he
claimed a local store owed him the
money on a refund for two pulleys.
He got the 70 cents refund. The
court fees came to $1.50. Ya can't
even win when ya win.

Know of a woman who chased
her husband out of the house with
a rolling pin yesterday morning . . .
and bawled him out when he got
home from work because lie didn't
kiss her on the way out!

But: If you can smile when things
go wrong and say it doesn't mat
ter,
If you can laugh off cares and woe
and trouble makes you fatter.
If you can keep a cheerful face
when all around are blue,
Then have your head examined,
Bud, there's something wrong
with you.
For one thing I've arrived at, there
arc no ifs and buts,
A Ruy that's grinning all (he time
must be completely nuts!
