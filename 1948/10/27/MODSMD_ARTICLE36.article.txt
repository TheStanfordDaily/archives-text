## Protest Prohibition Card Stunt 
### 
To (he Editor:
As an ardent fan and supporter of Stanford University, having served as
the minister to the Methodist students enrolled at the University, I would
like to take this means of protesting the poor sportsmanship used by the
Rally Committee at last Saturday's game in lampooning Proposition No. 12.
recommending a "No" vote on that measure. It was uncalled for partisan
ship. Since when has the Rally Committee at Stanford University sold
out to Arthur H. Samish and the liquor lobby in Sacramento?
The card stunt was probably intended as a joke, but it is high time
that Stanford students recognize that No. 12 is a very siyious and earnest
bid for the return of the democratic processes to the hands of the people
in the local communities as it relates to tlu- control of alcoholic liquors.
Your University is without doubt pledged to the policies of the denui
ciatie process, but when minds are poisoned by the false propaganda
which is being circulated relative to Proposition No. 12 and a student body
becomes participants in fascistic methods, it is evidence that we are
moving more rapidly than we think toward the day of the loss of
democracy.
Proposition No. 2, created to kill No. 12, would further entrench the
liquor industry in Sacramento, which divvies-up the liquor licenses for
this state. Stanford Daily should do all it can to offset the influence of
that poorly-chosen card stunt of last Saturday.
