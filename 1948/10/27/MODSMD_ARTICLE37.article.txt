# Those Telephone Operators Again

### 
To 1 lie Editor:
I've got an ax to grind—call it the Stanford Ax if you want, hut the
telephone switchboard system of Lagunita is a device that makes people
growl at their mothers, classmates, and friends in general.
It seems that I made the fatal mistake of calling Lagunita the other
night at 10.20. Ihe phone was answered by having the receiver taken
off the hook and set down, no answer whatsoever by voice. For eight
minutes I waited for the message from Garcia to come bursting forth—
I was rewarded by a silence you 'most could hear. 10:28 came and the
pi. one was hung up with nary so much as an "I m sorry, the switchboard
is closing." The result was much cursing of the Bell Telephone Co. as
conceived by the "Lag" officials.
That sort of thing is plain stupidity in my opinion. The girls up the
l?ow can receive phone calls at any hour, why should Roble, Branner,
Union and Lagunita be denied the privilege?
If I could choke my nickel out of the switchboard operator, I would
cheerfully do so!
I remain, five cents poorer,
PAUL G. MALONEE
