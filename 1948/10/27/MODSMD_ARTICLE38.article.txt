To the Editor:
We would like to thank Bob Landwehr for expressing the sentiments
of many Stanford women. His mention of the use of the term "Pig" as
an outlet for frustration seems most appropriate as it is the more repul
sive ol the men who are the most vociferous in its use. If "pig" (Stan
ford woman) maintains its present popularity in Farm vernacular, we
would like to recommend the word "Troglodyte" in referring to many
of the Stanford males, as it is in keeping with their minds and manners.
