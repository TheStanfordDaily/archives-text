# Rainy Weather Proves People Are Human
## 
### HAL BOYLE 
NEW YORK. Oct. 2B (/P).—lt is a
rainy clay outside, and I wonder if
any political candidate is going to
endorse it.
Why not?
Well, perhaps it is too controver
sial. A politician might win the
farm vote by coming out four
square for rainy weather, but there
would always be an adviser in the
background to warn:
"Don't do it — too risky. You'll
just make the city folks mad."
lt»has always seemed to me that
rain was one of the most blessed
things in the universe. Not because
it refreshes the green things that
grow in the fields—but because of
what it does to human beings.
Well-Scrubbed Look
Rain wets down and washes the
dreary, dusty face of nature. In the
same way it washes the pettiness
out of people, and makes them
nearer to what they want to be. At
least it does for most folks.
Sunshine has the opposite effect.
Sunshine is an insidious tonic that
makes everybody feel wonderful
but selfish. It makes a man say to
himself, "Boy, today I got the world
by the tail." And sunshine is a liar.
Nobody ever really had the world
by the tail for long.
Horses and People
Rain tells the truth. It doesn't
fool anybody. It tells him what he
is. Look at a plowhorse, standing in
a pasture under the slanting silver
pencil beats of the rain. You can
tell by the slack muscles, the hang
ing head, he realizes he is just an
ordinary horse after all and will
never win the Kentucky Derby or
fly out to California in his private
airplane to race at Santa Anita. So
he plods over to the other horses,
and is grateful there are other
horses in the world to stand with
while the rain falls.

Rain does the same thing for
people. They grow together more

and feci the kinship of their kind,
and this is the great gift of rain.
Rain as a Mixer
Rain does for mankind in a cheap
and harmless way what war does
in an expensive and wasteful way.
It makes a man aware of the lone
liness he is born to and dies in. ll
makes him want to be closer to his
fellows, a feeling he always has
when hardship threatens, the skies
clabber, and his world darkens.
Rain gives a man understanding
of what Wordsworth called "the
still sad music of humanity." And
that music will teach him more than
books or bibelots.
Remember to Write
Rain makes an old man feci the
age in his bones, and tells him he
hasn't much time left to do the
good he wants to do. It causes
young folks far away to pause and
write the letter home they had
forgotten.
Rain does many other things be
sides cause pneumonia. It shows up
the hypocrite. Beware the man of
false good cheer % who grumbles tes
tily and continually when it show -
ers. He lacks the pull for the loin:
road, and you re better off without
his company. Rain breaks the lock
jaw of the timid soul, and causeth
him to quack happily: "Wet enough
for you today?"
Run Drivers Are Human
Rain makes the dour bus driver
feel godlike, for as he swings open
his sheltering door lie realizes that
he is giving these troublesome pas
sengers a chance to prove they
really do have sense enough to
come in out of the rain something
he always doubted. They laugh to
gether, and anything they drop in
the token box is fare enough.
People don t save up their money
for a rainy day. They just save up
their humanity. Too bad it doesn't
rain more often.

Remember to Write
Rain makes an old man feci the
age in his bones, and tells him he
hasn't much time left to do the
good he wants to do. It causes
young folks far away to pause and
write the letter home they had
forgotten.
Rain does many other things be
sides cause pneumonia. It shows up
the hypocrite. Beware the man of
false good cheer % who grumbles tes
tily and continually when it show -
ers. He lacks the pull for the loin:
road, and you re better off without
his company. Rain breaks the lock
jaw of the timid soul, and causeth
him to quack happily: "Wet enough
for you today?"
Run Drivers Are Human
Rain makes the dour bus driver
feel godlike, for as he swings open
his sheltering door lie realizes that
he is giving these troublesome pas
sengers a chance to prove they
really do have sense enough to
come in out of the rain something
he always doubted. They laugh to
gether, and anything they drop in
the token box is fare enough.
People don t save up their money
for a rainy day. They just save up
their humanity. Too bad it doesn't
rain more often.
NEW YORK. Oct. 2B (/P).—lt is a
rainy clay outside, and I wonder if
any political candidate is going to
endorse it.
Why not?
Well, perhaps it is too controver
sial. A politician might win the
farm vote by coming out four
square for rainy weather, but there
would always be an adviser in the
background to warn:
"Don't do it — too risky. You'll
just make the city folks mad."
lt»has always seemed to me that
rain was one of the most blessed
things in the universe. Not because
it refreshes the green things that
grow in the fields—but because of
what it does to human beings.
Well-Scrubbed Look
Rain wets down and washes the
dreary, dusty face of nature. In the
same way it washes the pettiness
out of people, and makes them
nearer to what they want to be. At
least it does for most folks.
Sunshine has the opposite effect.
Sunshine is an insidious tonic that
makes everybody feel wonderful
but selfish. It makes a man say to
himself, "Boy, today I got the world
by the tail." And sunshine is a liar.
Nobody ever really had the world
by the tail for long.
Horses and People
Rain tells the truth. It doesn't
fool anybody. It tells him what he
is. Look at a plowhorse, standing in
a pasture under the slanting silver
pencil beats of the rain. You can
tell by the slack muscles, the hang
ing head, he realizes he is just an
ordinary horse after all and will
never win the Kentucky Derby or
fly out to California in his private
airplane to race at Santa Anita. So
he plods over to the other horses,
and is grateful there are other
horses in the world to stand with
while the rain falls.

Rain does the same thing for
people. They grow together more

and feci the kinship of their kind,
and this is the great gift of rain.
Rain as a Mixer
Rain does for mankind in a cheap
and harmless way what war does
in an expensive and wasteful way.
It makes a man aware of the lone
liness he is born to and dies in. ll
makes him want to be closer to his
fellows, a feeling he always has
when hardship threatens, the skies
clabber, and his world darkens.
Rain gives a man understanding
of what Wordsworth called "the
still sad music of humanity." And
that music will teach him more than
books or bibelots.
