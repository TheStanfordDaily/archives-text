# Abstract Painting Highlights Exhibit Now in Art Gallery
## 
### DIXIE BOOTH 
Right from the start, the peo
le over at the Art Gallery were
retty sure nobody was going
> understand much about their
irrent exhibit of paintings,
ith this in mind, they arranged an
:planatory display in the gallery
yer, and have scheduled two dis
issions this week by members of
e art department.
The canvases of the American Ab
act Painters Group on exhibition,
nge from the vastly fanciful to
ry deliberate draft-board-like de
pis. Most of the painting have
teresting contrasts of color and
ie. Each may be seen to express
me particular trait of its artist.
A majority of the pictures can be
wed most effectively from half
ly across the room. This is espc
illy true of "Abstraction Number
by Cavallon, for at some distance,
varied colors in box pattern
•nd not at all unpleasantly.
'Three Related Structures" by
vazzo is worthy of close inspec
n, as its design is well through
t and impeccably drawn. Some
lions of the pattern may almost
•m to resemble the careful
>odling" found on note margins
i phone pads. Two colorful to-

tem poles placed beside the paint- !
| ing accentuate blue and orange j
tints.
"Maine Abstraction" is notable |
for its exciting shade of red-pink,
backed by oblique shadows of grey
and black.
Krisel's "Green, Black, and White"
could model as an ordinary linoleum |
pattern with little change of color |
or composition.
Perhaps the least abstract of the
group is "Littie Fish Eats Big Man," .
j which oddly has a more imagina
tive title than the rest. Subdued
colors fill in this replica of Indian
picture-writing.
In sharp contrast to the main ex
hibit at the gallery is a smaller
display of "Animals in Art." A lim
ited edition of lithographs by Ro
berta Everett depict a number of
animals from Africa and South
America, among which are the
Common Wombat, Greater Kudu,
and the Bongo.
A rigidly posed green Egyptian
| cat (100-300 BC), and ;i small Greek !
; horse (700 BC) are included in a '
J supplementary figurine exhibit.
The Gallery talks on abstract art
: will bo conducted today at 4:15 p.m.
by John La Plante, and tomorrow
at 4:15 p.m. by Ray N. Faulkner.
The present exhibit will be held
I in the gallery until Nov. 9.
