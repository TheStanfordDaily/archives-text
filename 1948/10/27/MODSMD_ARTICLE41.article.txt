# Hawks Film Best of Decade, Unknowns Star in 'Red River'
## 
### AL BERRY 
The general plot of "Red River," now showing at the Park
eater, is relatively unimportant to the success of the picture,
deals with the first successful drive of cattle away from the
r-shattered southern markets, over the Chisolm Trail to the
1 junction at Abilene. Shrewd direction and excellent acting
(lie factors which make "Red I

•er" a great Western,
lie direction laurels go to one
tvard Hawks, who does not al
ys make good movies. In "Red
cr" he hits the jack-pot. A
verfully done cattle stampede
rly blasts the audience out of
theater. Ilawks never lets the
arc drag. If tilings start to drag,
actors reach for their hoag-legs,

Lit, the real strength of "Red

of the best supporting perforat
es since Van Heflin's Johnny
er. Joanne Dru, as a determined
stitutc, is the most kissable thing
i celluloid world that is full of
able things.
ow. after wading through miles
adjectives, we come to Mont
lery Clift and find a definite
rlage of words to describe him.

He has been called "A small Ga
ble."
This is an injustice to Clift. Per
haps it is sufficient to say that
never before in a Western has any
actor done so well. Without Clift,
"Red River," in spite of its powerful
scenes and fine cast, would be just
another movie.
It's a shame that this review, eulo
gizing "Red River," must end in an
anti-climax. It is a greater shame
that "Red River" had to end this
way. Up until the last 70 seconds,
"Red River" was powerful, brutal,
thrilling, great. In the last 70 sec
onds, it became Hollywood. "Red
River," at the climax does not fall
on its face; it merely stumbles. Yep,
the ending is"a happy" one. Ten
more seconds of "hiippy ending"
would have ruined this masterpiece
entirely. Fortunately, the newsreel
comes on in time to make the finale
merely disappointing, rather than
disugsting.
"Red River" is a good picture to
go "overboard" on. On the whole,
it overcomes the weakness of its
ending, and tramples on its lusty,
dusty way to greatness.

adjectives, we come to Mont
lery Clift and find a definite
rlage of words to describe him.

He has been called "A small Ga
ble."
This is an injustice to Clift. Per
haps it is sufficient to say that
never before in a Western has any
actor done so well. Without Clift,
"Red River," in spite of its powerful
scenes and fine cast, would be just
another movie.
It's a shame that this review, eulo
gizing "Red River," must end in an
anti-climax. It is a greater shame
that "Red River" had to end this
way. Up until the last 70 seconds,
"Red River" was powerful, brutal,
thrilling, great. In the last 70 sec
onds, it became Hollywood. "Red
River," at the climax does not fall
on its face; it merely stumbles. Yep,
the ending is"a happy" one. Ten
more seconds of "hiippy ending"
would have ruined this masterpiece
entirely. Fortunately, the newsreel
comes on in time to make the finale
merely disappointing, rather than
disugsting.
"Red River" is a good picture to
go "overboard" on. On the whole,
it overcomes the weakness of its
ending, and tramples on its lusty,
dusty way to greatness.
The general plot of "Red River," now showing at the Park
