# Villagers to Canvass Houses in Relief Drive
## 
### 
The Village Council at its Mon
day night meeting decided in favor
of house soliciting for the SIRO
drive.
Each house president will appoint
two or more solicitors who will also
record names of those who fail to
contribute to the drive.
Doug Noteware, president of
House 117. presented a student-in
itiated plan for a Village organiza
tion combining educational, reli
gious, and social activities. After
discussing the matter the council
moved that a committee investigate
the possibility of passing a by-law
to authorize the organization.
