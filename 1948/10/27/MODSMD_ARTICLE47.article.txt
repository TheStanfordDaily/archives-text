# Doctors OK Don Campbell For Washington Contest
## 
### 
Stanford's quarterback situation ,
was first clouded and then cleared ]
.ip yesterday. When the varsity
football team started its work only j
one qb, Tom Shaw, was present for |
duty.
Don Campbell had been sidelined

with a head injury, and Aubrey
Devine was taking treatments for
an injured leg. Punter Mike Dur
kett, something of a quarterback
in his junior college days, was
called upon to handle the T-for
mation chores in a scrimmage with
the junior varsity. He amazed one

and all with his passing and ball
handling.
Shaw held down the post with
the section of the varsity that was
learning new plays and running
dummy scrimmage on old ones.
But at the end of the practice
session, Coach Marchie Schwartz
received word that Campbell had
received a clean bill of health and
the go-ahead signal from the doc
tors. However, it is doubtful that
lie will play against Washington on
Saturday.
If Campbell docs not sec action,
his defensive work will be taken
over by either Devinc, who is ex
pected to be ready Saturday, or Bill
DeYoung.
DeYoung, a fine blocker and run
ner, was moved to light half yes
terday in an effort to place the big
fellow in a spot from which he
will see more action. Me lias been
playing fullback behind Emery
Mitchell.
