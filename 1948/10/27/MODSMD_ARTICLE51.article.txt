Take one jigger of Al Laakso, add some Ken Rose, and then
slightly with Gene Martin, and you have one of the best Saturday ,

both Bert Laßrucherie of UCLA and Jeff Cravath of USC have p
him as one of the best Stanford men to face their squads.
Iwo weeks ago in the L.A. Coliseum, Al played 55 minutes of
j football. It was his alert recovery of an early Stanford bobble thai
| the Indians from blowing their chances on the initial touchdown
He also acted like a net on defense that day, as not one UCLA bar
- around his end.
Al was also 55 minutes tough on El Troje. He tackled, blocked
j grabbed passes in a manner that would be accepted in the best of r
Its all the more amazing that in these days of run-'em-in and run-'ei
football, that wingman Laakso has been present for 110 out of th
120 playing minutes.
Last season, Laakso (rhymes with Boraxo) was just another
tlying JV, but this year he ranks with Bob, the White Flash, as
the find of the season.
Six days a week, Al is just an easy going junior from the St
Washington, hut on Saturday he is 17(> pounds of hard-charging
sapiens. He has one more year of eligibility, and from the looks of 1
he will be playing lots of end for the Indians; Things could be woi

Stanford basketball fans will witness the birth of a new team ot
23, when the Stanford Braves (JVs) open their 19-game .season ;
Bob Burnett's talented Frosh. The Braves are something thai
basketball has needed for several years.
A handful of good boys who couldn't quite latch on to the varsity
i circle will now get a chance to work out their kinks against othc
! flight JV and JC competition. As a result, several Braves will undoi
develop into better-than-average varsity performers.
Such has been the case across the Bay. Bear Guard Earl Stra<!
forward Gordon Cuneo, both learned their basketball and gained v.-
experience while playing with the Cal Blues. Then last sensor
