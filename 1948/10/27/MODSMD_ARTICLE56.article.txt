# Three Menlo Men Sidelined for Tilt
## 
### 
Old man injury, the great equal
! i/.er, is working on the side of frosh
! coach Chuck Taylor for once. Not
| only did his boys emerge from Sat
| urday's SC fracas wtihout one dis
i abling injury, but. it. was announced
j yesterday that three regulars on the
I Menlo JC squad, which the Stan-
I ford frosh meet next Saturday, are
| on the crippled list.
Halfback Bobby Newman, Coach
Roy Hughes' chief offensive threat
so far this season, is sidelined with
lan ankle injury and will not see
I action against the Cards. Newman
: scored against Santa Rosa last week
| on a pass play good for 71 yards.
Another stalwart out with a game
ankle is Herb Lane, All-Conlerence
end, while 195-pound tackle Fred
' die Field sports a broken wrist that
| should be enough to keep him out
iof action. Hughes, however, prob
| ably isn't worrying, inasmuch as
; the* Oaks rank as one of the most
j powerful JC squads in the state.
Among the reserves who deserve
| credit for their showing against the
i Trojans were halfbacks Dick Leon
j ard and Howard Bugbee. Leonard
| looked good in getting some boom
; ing punts away while being rushed,
I and Bugbee at last gave indications
of rounding into form. The boy is
| a 9.5 sprinter and opposing punters
know it, so thus far he has proved
; chiefly a psychological weapon at
safety, but if he shows some of that
J speed next Saturday, look out
Menlo.
