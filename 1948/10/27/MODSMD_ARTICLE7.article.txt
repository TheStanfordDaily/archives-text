# Taylor to Speak Near Farm Friday
## 
### 
Senator Glenn Taylor will speak
from a sound truck outside Stan
lord Village this Friday at 4 p.m.,
rather than in the Village as
planned. The change is due to the
policy of the Committee on Public
Exercises against political speeches
on campus.
Taylor's speech is sponsored
jointly by Students for Wallace and
the Palo Alto chapter of the Inde
pendent Progressive party.
Henry Wallace's running mate,
formerly a Democrat from Idaho,
Taylor will employ his talents of
singing and guitar playing at the
meeting.
During the last session of Con
gress, Taylor filibustered against
the Taft - Hartley Act and later
against the draft.
