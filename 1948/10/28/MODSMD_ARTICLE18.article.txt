### 
PARIS, Oct. 27 (>P>.— I The West
ern powers today gave the neutrals
on the Security Council—and Prus
sia—an open invitation to make new
proposals for settling the Berlin
crisis.
That appeared to be the primary
meaning of a British - French-
American announcement that said
the three powers are stiil ready to
accept a settlement which would be
"guided by the principles embod
ied" in the six-nation compromise
resolution vetoed by Russia Mon
day.
Ministers of the three countries
said they had decided to leave the
Berlin issue on the agenda of the
United Nations Security Council.
By this decision, they tacitly re
affirmed their charges against the
Soviet blockade and at the same
time made it known that they were
not ready yet to take the problem
to the General Assembly for judg
ment by the 58 member countries.
At a meeting ear'ier in the day
between Marshall and Bevin, the
latter formally notified the Secre
tary of State that the five members
of the Western European Union had
voted yesterday to ask the United
States and Canada to join a North
Atlantic Defense Alliance.
