# U.S. Expected To Aid Alliance
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (,P)—As
soon as the elections are out ol' the
way next week, the United States
is expected to lay the basis for a
decision on a military alliance with
Western Europe.
State Department officials, it was
learned today, plan tu consult lead
ers of Congress and the major polit
ical parties to find what they will
support in the final drafting of a
proposed treaty to create a North
Atlantic mutual defense system.
Undersecretary of State Lovett
told a news conference today that
the first phase of the projected non-
Communist alliance already has been
'completed. This phase consisted of
"exploratory" talks held here during
in the summer among Lovett and
the ambassadors of Canada. Britain,
France, Belgium, The Netherlands,
and Luxembourg.
Understandings reached in these
talks did not involve commitments
by anyone on anything, Lovett said.
However, they did result in a gen
eral agreement among the partici
pants on the form and scope of the
unprecedented! defense agreement.
Diplomatic authorities forecast
that half a dozen major points will
survive future negotiations and be
included in the final draft:
1. The United States, Canada, and
the five nations comprising the
Western European Union should
form the nucleus of the non-Com
munist alliance.
2. The alliance should include
other countries with common se
curity interests in the North At
lantic area—notably Portugal, Ice
land. Denmark (which controls
Greenland), Norway, and Iceland.
3. A council or committee should
be created to work continuously on
common defense problems and pro
vide a constantly available means
for coping with any emergency.
4. The nations in the system should
co-ordinate their military sources
to the fullest extent possible. For
the United States this would mean
enactment of a military aid pro
fram—a kind of peacetime revival
of lend-lease to strengthen the
Western European countries against
Russia. The five European nations
already are pooling their resources
and have set up a joint command.
5. In event of attack on any mem
ber of the alliance, all the other
members should consider that they
have been attacked and should take
"appropriate action."
6. In each country the "appropriate
action" would be taken in accord
ance with is constitutional processes.
