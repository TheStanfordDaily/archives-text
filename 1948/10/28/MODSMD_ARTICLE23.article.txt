### Associated Press 
Governor Dewey accused the
Truman administration last night of
failing to understand the Commu
nist threat. At the same time, Pres
ident Truman declared he had
fought Communism at home and
abroad and will "never surrender."
The Republican Presidential nom
inee pitched into the Truman for
eign policy record in a speech at
Cleveland. Three years after the
war, he said, we have no security
and no peace.
The administration, Dewey said,
"did not seem to understand the
nature of the Communist threat.
One day it seemed to believe in ap
peasement and the next day it
seemed to stand firm. It made trag
ic concessions."
'"We shall not achieve peace,"
Dewey counseled, "by conducting
these desperately important matters
on a happv-thought basis or by jo
vially remarking that we like good
old Joe." (Mr. Truman has said he
personally liked "Old Joe" Stalin,
whom he pictured as under the
power of the Soviet Politburo.)
Mr. Truman, outlining his han
dling of Communism before a Bos
ton audience in his first New Eng
land speech of the campaign, de-

I clared:
"As an American, as well as you:
President, "I resent the contemp
tible Republican slur that charges
me with being 'soft' where Commu
nist tyranny is concerned."
The President asserted that the
Communists "will never forgive
me" for America's stand in Greece
and Turkey, the European Recov
ery Program, and other anti-Com
munist measures.
The result is, he said, "the Com
munists are doing all they can to
defeat me and help my Republican
opponent." He declared that the
Communist party is supporting "a
J third party candidate" to that end,
and that the Republicans "in state
! after state" have worked to get that
| candidate on the ballot.
Dewey said he and his running
mate. Governor Warren, presented
; "fully and in detail the issues of
this campaign." He said they have
I advanced peace by advancing unity
, and will win "by clean and decent
methods." t
In a speech at Springfield. Mass..
1 the President brought out a "school
| teacher punch." He declared that
; Dewey has said "The teachers'
J lobby is more vicious than the
| power, or real estate, or oil or liq
j uor lobbies of the country."
Dewey has denied making the
j statement.
