## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 27 (/P)—
The deadlock in the 54-day-old West
Coast Oil Workers' strike appar
ently was breaking up today.
Shell Oil Company said in a
statement tht "an orderly resump
tion of operations is expected to
morrow morning at 8 o'clock at Shell
Chemical Corporation's Pittsburg
plant, where 450 workers will re
turn to their jobs."
Tide Water Associated represen
tatives were meeting here with oil
workers' negotiators.
Union representatives from Oleum
and Wilmington were reported in
conference with Union Oil Company
officials at Los Angeles.
The optimistic outlook followed a
labor agreement reached Tuesday
with Shell's subsidiary, the Shell j
Chemical Corporation at iPttsburg. j
Ii provides a 12'/^-cent wage in- ;
crease, to $1.80*2 —the companies' j
original offer.
Two hitches were believed to be
impeding settlement of the long
strike at other plants.
One was the companies' refusal to ,
rehire strikers they accused of com- !
mining violent acts while picketing, j
The other was the necessity of a
collective bargaining election at
Standard Oil Company's Richmond
refinery before negotiations can be
resumed.
