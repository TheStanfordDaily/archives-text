# Cal Daily Claims Bears Draped Hoover Tower
## 
### 
Once again the Daily Californian
is claiming a raid on the Farm. This
time it concerns the hanging of a
banner from the Hoover Tower.
"Proud Stanford has fallen," the
Daily Californian says, in reference
to the fact that Cal undergraduates
hung' their blue and white ensign
on the Tower Monday night, com
pletely unnoticed by Farm students.
Tale of Intrigue
The California sheet went on to
to tell the "tale of intrigue, inter
woven with hanging ropes and
furtive signals by flashlight."
"We scaled the first floor by
climbing a 20 foot rope tied to the
end ol a 2xB,"' claimed one of the
members of the north side fraternity
which did the deed, to quote the
Daily Californian.
• "Then we opened a window, and
after climbing the stairs to the ob
servation platform, worked our way
along a 10-inch ledge to the corners
of the tower, where we hung the
banner.

Was Simple *
"It was really very simple," the
quote continues. "No damage was
done, no one got hurt, and only
one thing worried us: We were
afraid that no one would tell the
staff of the Stanford Daily what
had happened."
A little research by a Stanford
Daily reporter revealed that Cal
students didn't climb the tower after
all. Actually, the students jimmied
a lock.
No Mention of Flag
The Daily Californian wondered
(editorially) why the Stanford Daily
didn't mention the episode. The
reason was that passing observers
thought the banner a flag for United
Nations week.
Library officials said they were
happy to learn about the breaking
ol the lock. They are having a
better lock put in—not to keep out
Cal raiders, but to protect the price
less documents in the Hoover Li
brary.
