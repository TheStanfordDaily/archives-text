# Excom Plans New Seating Card System
## 
### 
Excom last night recommended to
the Registrar that lower division
seat cards be given out in a fixed
drawing within the lour sections of
the alphabet.
Each section of the alphabet would
be rotated so that all students would
have a chance to be at the top of
the list once every four quarters.
H. Donald Winbigler, the registrar,
submitted this plan and the one
used last spring of a lottery among
all the lower division students to
Excom for its recommendation.
Excom voted the Registrar's Office
the use of the Nitery for the dis
tribution of the seat cards from
Nov. 30 to Dec. 7.
Gus Chavalas, ASSU president,
read the contract between Stanford
and California in connection wtih
the Big Game week. It states that
there will be no invasions by stu
dents of either campus and any such
violator will be disciplined.
A student committee to advise the
Health Service on student problems
will be appointed by Excom next
week. Each member fo Excom is
submitting one name for the com
mittee so that it will have area rep
resentation. The committee is being
set up on the suggestion of Dr.
George Houck.
Excom also accepted the resigna
tion ot Ferris Boothe as graduate
member of Excom.
