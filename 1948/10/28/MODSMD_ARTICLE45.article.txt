# NSA's International Plans Extend Far Beyond Europe
## 
### JIM THURBER 
Last week, The Daily started a
series of articles on the National
Student Association with a sum
mary of NSA's work in Europe.
But the NSA's international pians
have now spread out to include a
much bigger field than Europe
alone.
L<ast summer, Farm student Er
skine Childers carried the name of
the National Student Association
through the countries of Latin
America. On his return to the
Madison, Wis.. National Congress,
he told Ihe 750 assembled delegates
of his discovery of a movement to
create an Inter-American Confed
eration composed of representatives
of national student organizations
throughout the Western Hemi
sphere.
The following is an account of an
interview by a Daily reporter with
Childers immediately after he re
turned to Stanford as recently
elected chairman of the California-
Nevada-Hawaii Region and Latin-
American representative to the
NSA.
"Tiie Latin American college stu
dents are deeply conscious that they
hold the first chance to create a
prosperous democratic order for
their nations," Childers stated.
In elaboration, he commented:
"World War 11. and the Good
Neighbor Policy saw a vast ex
pansion of agricultural and in
dustrial activity in Latin Amer
ica. This increase in material
prosperity was accompanied by
an intensive program of informa
tion and education with the re
sult that Latin American peoples
began to learn of democracy av>
practiced in the U.S."
"Every month brings more news
of a very general trend away from
dictatorship and in the direction of
greater popular expression of dem
ocratic rights," he continued.
Childers spent considerable time
in Lima, Peru, where he learned of
a dynamic international movement
composed of representatives of the
Peruvian Federation of Students
and other Latin American students
studying at the University of San
Marcos.
"This group of students, desiring
to create an international organiza-
I ion for closer co-operation and
understanding between all students
in this hemisphere, had laid plans
for and had sent out invitations to
a Constitutional Congress of Amer
ican Students, scheduled for last
April." Erskine said.
"The government of Peru, how

ever, for various internal politi
cal reasons, arbitrarily prohibited
this international assembly. It
was hoped at the time that I left
Peru that this Inter - American
Congress could be held in No
vember. but in the last month a
violent revolution broke out in
Peru and there is little chance
that the Congress will convene
until next year," lie said.
Childers pointed out that the I
discernible dividing line between j
individual student participation in
national politics and collective stu- !
.dent non-partisanship in a national j
student organization is a hundred
times harder to find in Latin Amer
ica than in the United States.
"It is therefore very possible that
many of my Peruvian student
friends have been forced into hid
ing or are under arrest as a result
of the recent revolution," Childers
concluded.
Childers has been asked by the
NSA to set up in the California Re
gion an Inter - American Student
Affairs Commission to plan for
travel, study, and general exchange
of" information between students
throughout the hemisphere. He has
also been asked to represent the
United States National Student As
sociation at the proposed Inter-
American Congress in Peru, or else
where, whenever it can be held.
