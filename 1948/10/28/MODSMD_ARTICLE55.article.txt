## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 27 (/P).—
Cecil Wright's thirteenth legal at
tempt to escape from Alcatraz Fed
ora! Penitentiary apparently was
successful today.
Wright, sometimes called "the
brains of Alcatraz," has spent 18
years in prison for a $2.43 branch
postoftice robbery at Strasbourg,
bourg, 111.
He was 20 years o!d when he was
convicted in 1930 of robbing a drug
store and the branch postoffice,
which resulted in both state r.nd
federal charges against him.
Sentenced to prison. Wright stud
ied law with the notorious Nathan
Leopold, slayer of a young boy in
Chicago.
Later he began his long series of
court actions, contending he did not
have proper and sufficient legal as
assistance at his trial.
Last April Federal Judge William
Denman agreed with Wright's con
tention and ordered him returned
to Danville, 111. The government
appealed.
But today U.S. Attorney Frank
Hennessy, on authorization from
Attorney General Tom Clark, dis
missed the government's appeal.
It' authorities from Danville do
not come here to return Wright to
t'ace pending charges, he will be re
leased from Alcatraz.
An odd angle in the case is that
Wright would have been released
anyway next February because of
3ood conduct.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph
Karesh said Danville authorities
ould retry Wright if they desired,
md probably keep him in prison.
3ut Karesh added he had been in
ormed they probably would not
"ome here for him.
