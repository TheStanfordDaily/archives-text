What a night tomorrow
night's going to be! Every
body will be at the game
rally.
Know what I'm going to
wear? My new burgundy
sheer wool dress from the
Clothes Closet. It's a dream
with its long waistline and
walk-away skirt. You'll know
how up-to-the-minute it is
when I tell you it has three
quarter, deep-set sleeves and
a high neckline.
If you are joining the
dancing and frolicking at
Union, you really need a
die s like mine (only $22.95).
Maybe you'd prefer deep Kelly
or taupe — or perhaps one of
the other stunning fashions
from the Clothes Closet.
These wools are perfect for
the Washington game Satur
day, and for the open house
afterward sponsored by the
Class of '50 at the Women's
Clubhouse.
I'd belter go now. hot why
don't you meet me at the
Clothes Closet sonn — under
the big oak tree?
