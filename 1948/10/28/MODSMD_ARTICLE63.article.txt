# Frosh Will Haunt Encina at Dance
## 
### 
Hey frosh! Got your witches lined
up for next Saturday night? That's
the date for the big Halloween
Dance at Encina. Ghosts and gob
lins will haunt the hall between 9
p.m. and 1 a.m. Dress up like your
favorite demon and come dancing
to the strains of Howard Fredericks
and his Black Cais.
Masks will be given away at the
door. In addition, there will be free
refreshments, and door prizes for
the luckier girls and ghouls.
Encina wing social chairmen are
selling tickets for $1.80 apiece, and
oil - campus freshmen arc encour
aged to buy them along with the
rest of the class.
