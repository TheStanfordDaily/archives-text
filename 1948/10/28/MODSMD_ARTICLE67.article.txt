## Bawlout Grades 
### 
Editorially we are lukewarm about the Bawlout—whether
grade averages are printed or not. And we think most of the
student body is, too. However, several persons have wondered
why the University resumed the publishing of grades after the
lapse of several years.
About half a dozen people said they thought grades should
be private. Others said they didn't care. Some said they thought
it would cut down a lot of "moaning about poor grades" if the
crape hanger could be checked in the bawlout. One giijl said
she was afraid her boyfriend would stop going out with her,
since she was close to straight A and he was minus 15.
Anyway, here are the reasons for the resumption of the grade
point averages in the Bav/lout:
Although the grades were eliminated to cut costs of the
Bawlout, the University found that it had to compile the grades
anyway. Students in large numbers inquired about their grades.
Most departments had to know grade-point averages before
admitting students to special work. Other departments did their
own compiling. Advisers preferred the Bawlout grade-point
averages for quick reference.
So the University decided to go back to putting the grade
points in the book for the convenience of the majority.
We don't think it makes much difference to the student body
as a whole. If we're wrong, please tell us about it.
