# Proposition No. 12

### 
Reaction to Rally Corn's card "trick" on Proposition No. 12
has been remarkably strong. Several persons have telephoned
to straighten out some misconceptions about No. 12.
The measure is not a prohibition or "local option" proposition,
they declare. Rather, it is a bill to permit local control. The
advantages are, they point out, that someone in Sacramento
who is ignorant of local conditions, won't license a bar next
to a YMCA or in other unsatisfactory places.
In the matter of liquor control, it has always seemed to us
that there was more to it than the current B. of E. practice of
stalking around the Peninsula looking for Stanford students
drinking beer. Better they should be checking on licenses,
joints that re-bottle, places that sell liquor to obviously intoxi
cated people, and crummy joints in general.
Proposition No. 2 is called the rival of No. 12 It is a house
cleaning measure. It is supposed to supplant No. 12 if both
pass and it gets more affirmative votes.
