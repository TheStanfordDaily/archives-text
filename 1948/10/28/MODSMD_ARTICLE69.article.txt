Protest Rally Corn's "Trick '
To the Editor:
There was a good crowd at the football game last Saturday, and not all
ot them were Stanford people. These non-students had several ways in
which they could form their opinions of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole, and one of those ways was the card stunts. How
many went away with the impression that there were no objections to
the expression ot political opinion which Rally Com (or someone) asked
the rooters to give in the card stunt "Vote 'No' on Prop. 12?"
How many went, away not realizing that the few cards out of place were
not mistakes, but intentional protests?
Rally Com is to be commended on their cleverness in tricking us into
expressing their political views to such a wide audience, where other
campus groups cannot even express their own political opinions.
Rally Com is composed of fallible students who apparently have fallen
victims to the fallacious reasoning of the highway billboards, ct al., con
cerning propositions 2 and 12. Let those who are sincerely concerned, as
we all should be, read the provisions of both propositions carefully and
critically, and not just accept the views of those outside our "Ivory
Tower."
