# Future Union Plans Include Larger Cellar
## 
### 
An adequate ballroom, a new and
enlarged "Cellar," and new ASSU
offices were suggested to Excom
last night by the Union Planning
Committee for the first unit of Tre
sidder Union.
Ted Norton, chairman, told Excom
that the Committee would welcome
any and all suggestions or criti
cisms. ' But if we don't get any
reaction, we'll take it that the cam
pus agrees with us," he said.
The committee agreed that these
facilities will meet the most pressing
needs in the foreseeab'e future, Nor
ton said. Other units of the new
Union might include such facilities
as a swimming pool, bowling alleys,
and a new publications office.
A complete financial report is not
yet available, but the indications
are that funds for a first unit might
be available in two or three years,
Norton stated.
''Two things that the committee
wants to emphasize," Norton said,
"are, first, that we're not going into
debt to build this, and second, that
we hope to see it designed along
traditional Stanford lines, red tile
roof, and all."
Suggestions or objections for the
committee can be sent to or left at
the ASSU office in the Old Union.
