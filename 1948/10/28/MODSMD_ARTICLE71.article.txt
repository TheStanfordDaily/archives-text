# France On The Wane
## 
### JAN M. VAN GINDERTAEL 
The post - war years are giving
France the finishing stroke. At the
present speed that France is run
ning down the slope, she soon will
be leit with nothing but her glo
rious past.
If it is only now that this decay
has become apparent, the microbe
— depopulation — had entered the
French organism years ago. Dur
ing World War I, France lost 1.000,-
000 men. While Germany, struck
with equal losses, quickly replen
ished her manpower, France did
not. As a result, in the '30's she had
no more than 40 million inhabitants
to oppose Germany's 70 million.
What is worse, the French began
to admit that they had reached an

I old-grown stage
and their will to
resist consc
! quently shrank.
This weakness
was correctly
interpreted by
the Germans as
a permanent
green light for
their ambitious
program: they
reoccupied the

Ruhr in 1935 and went on by an
nexing Austria in 1938. Even Czecho
slovakia, allied to France by a
valid military pact, was carved up
m Munich the same year and then
totally occupied in March 1939.
France Hesitates
Six months later the same story
was about to occur as Hitler at
| tacked Poland, another ally of
[ France. For weeks, Paris newspa
pers had been displaying big head
lines. such as: "To Die for Danzig?"
I Only Britain's example led the
! French to declare war against Ger
j many.
But it did not mean that they
j carried on the war, for the French
I army remained idle behind the Ma
| '.'inot Line throughout the winter of
| 1939-40. Nothing happened until
; May, the month in which France
! was utterly crushed as the Ger
j mans swept across her territory and
captured 2.000,000 of her soldiers.
Never had France known such
humiliation.
Yet, the French went further by
voluntarily subjugating themselves
to the Germans. While in all other
occupied countries the Nazis had
failed to set up pro-German gov
ernments legally, in France they
found opportunist politicians, head
ed by a marshal, in their service. In
those summer days of 1940, many
were the French who welcomed the
move; it seemed to them the most
clever trick played on Britain,
whose surrender was expected to
take place within a few days.
Britain Holds On
But Britain did not give up. and
; the war went on. Russia, then
America, joined in the battle
i against Hitler. After El Alamein
j and Stalingrad in 1943, the tables
I were turned, and the French began
I to realize that they had played the
wrong card.
The forced labor to Germany,
which was imposed upon them,
paved the way to a change in pub
lic opinion. General de Gaulle
j succeeded in grouping resistance
forces which kept sizable German
forces off the Normandy beaches.
However. France owed her libera
| lion to the American, British, and
Canadian armies — a fact she bit-
I terly resented and which was to
1 noison her future relations with the
United States and Britain.
The resistance coalition would
I have dissolved immediately after
the liberation if its leaders had not
] been given the opportunity to solve
| the multiple problems of recon-
I struction for themselves. But what
j did they do?
They listened with complaisance
: to their hearts and closed their ears
lo reason. Political purification came
up first. Rather than making it the
trial of genuine collaborationists,
j this purification was soon trahs
j formed into an endless wrangling
! game of rec iprocal jealousies.
Finances Disregarded
On the other hand, the basic is
i sues of economy and finances were
; disregarded and put aside. Infia
j tion, which could have been de
' stroyed by immediate, drastic

measures, as was done by Belgium,
developed month after month
through the easy solution of print
ing more banknotes. The dollar,
which could buy 25 French francs
in 1938, had a purchasing valte of
more than 350 francs 10 years later.
Fearful of displeasing the peas
ants, the successive French govern
ments did not attempt to check the
black market once and for all. As
a result, prices of agricultural

products kept on rising. Unable
make ends meet, factory workt
went out on strikes to obtain hit'
cr wages. No sooner were th
granted than living costs sky-roc
eted to higher peaks.
Between the inability of th<
present leaders, de Gaulle's di
tatorship, and Communism, t
French have a wide choice, but
hope to get out of the depths
which they are.

If it is only now that this decay
has become apparent, the microbe
— depopulation — had entered the
French organism years ago. Dur
ing World War I, France lost 1.000,-
000 men. While Germany, struck
with equal losses, quickly replen
ished her manpower, France did
not. As a result, in the '30's she had
no more than 40 million inhabitants
to oppose Germany's 70 million.
What is worse, the French began
to admit that they had reached an

I old-grown stage
and their will to
resist consc
! quently shrank.
This weakness
was correctly
interpreted by
the Germans as
a permanent
green light for
their ambitious
program: they
reoccupied the

Ruhr in 1935 and went on by an
nexing Austria in 1938. Even Czecho
slovakia, allied to France by a
valid military pact, was carved up
m Munich the same year and then
totally occupied in March 1939.
France Hesitates
Six months later the same story

pers had been displaying big head
lines. such as: "To Die for Danzig?"
I Only Britain's example led the
! French to declare war against Ger
j many.
But it did not mean that they
j carried on the war, for the French
I army remained idle behind the Ma
| '.'inot Line throughout the winter of
| 1939-40. Nothing happened until
; May, the month in which France
! was utterly crushed as the Ger
j mans swept across her territory and
captured 2.000,000 of her soldiers.
Never had France known such
humiliation.
Yet, the French went further by
voluntarily subjugating themselves
to the Germans. While in all other
occupied countries the Nazis had
failed to set up pro-German gov
ernments legally, in France they
found opportunist politicians, head
ed by a marshal, in their service. In
those summer days of 1940, many
were the French who welcomed the
move; it seemed to them the most
clever trick played on Britain,
whose surrender was expected to
take place within a few days.
Britain Holds On
But Britain did not give up. and
; the war went on. Russia, then
America, joined in the battle
i against Hitler. After El Alamein
j and Stalingrad in 1943, the tables
I were turned, and the French began
I to realize that they had played the
wrong card.
The forced labor to Germany,
which was imposed upon them,
paved the way to a change in pub
lic opinion. General de Gaulle

forces which kept sizable German
forces off the Normandy beaches.
However. France owed her libera

Canadian armies — a fact she bit-
I terly resented and which was to
1 noison her future relations with the
United States and Britain.
The resistance coalition would
I have dissolved immediately after
the liberation if its leaders had not

I struction for themselves. But what
j did they do?
They listened with complaisance
: to their hearts and closed their ears
lo reason. Political purification came
up first. Rather than making it the
trial of genuine collaborationists,
j this purification was soon trahs
j formed into an endless wrangling
! game of rec iprocal jealousies.
Finances Disregarded
On the other hand, the basic is

through the easy solution of print

which could buy 25 French francs
in 1938, had a purchasing valte of
more than 350 francs 10 years later.
Fearful of displeasing the peas
ants, the successive French govern
ments did not attempt to check the
black market once and for all. As
a result, prices of agricultural

products kept on rising. Unable
make ends meet, factory workt
went out on strikes to obtain hit'
cr wages. No sooner were th
granted than living costs sky-roc
