Instructors are Human Dep't.:
LXHIBIT A—A young lab instructor was doing the talking:
"As you all know, next Thursday we're going to have a laboratory quiz.
I warn you all to keep your answers short. In other words, leave your
shovels at home!"
Shovels, sir? Why, what do you mean?
EXHIBIT B—Well-known Stanford English instructor:
"Our next discussion will be on the following subject." (He goes to
the board and writes down the letters "T-S".) "This, of course, stands
loi 'Topic-Sentence.' (He casts a sly look around the class.) "And,
fellows, there are no other connotations to these letters!"

Never let it be said that Cal football coach Lynn
Waldorf is a man who leaves things to chance. A
friend of mine who plays for the Cal Ramblers —in
other words, he's a tackling dummy for the varsity
told me that for a week preceding the Cal-Washington
game, Waldorf ordered the practice field completely
soaked each day with water and ankle-deep mud.
The idea was, of course, to simulate the conditions
under which the Bears would be playing (and did
play under) in the rainy city of Seattle.
So what happened? It rained in Seattle as per

schedule, and the Bears came out on top by three touchdowns.

In Monday's column I used, or rather, tried (o use, an item that went
like this: "What Stanford University Bull Sessioner is 1-A with his draft
board, and why am I?" For some reason, known only to the printers and
proofreaders, the classification that appeared in the paper was not 1-A.
11 was 1-T.
This has led to several complications. First of all, several worried
prospective draftees have stopped me to ask what this new classification
"1-T" is. Others who had read the column hastily were under the im
pression that I had been classified as an "IT." (This second is a much
more logical assumption.)
The real truth is that I am in 1-A. But I'm not worried. They'll nevei
take me. Not until they run out of human beings.

Speaking of the draft, one of the fellows in the house was filling out
his questionnaire the other day. When he came to the part about having
any physical handicaps which might keep him out of the service, he
re-ally pulled out all the stops.
Included in what he wrote were: (1) Extreme Myopia (nearsightedness)
(2) Flat feet, (3) Sleepwalking, and, here's the topper, (4) "I think I rnaj
have an ulcer!"
I wonder why, just to l;e safe, he didn't add a post script saying: P.S.—
"I don't want to go."
