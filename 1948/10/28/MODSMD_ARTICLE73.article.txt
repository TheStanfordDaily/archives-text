## Big Bargain Todayâ€” Another Bull Session! 
### 
Ah. election year again.
You know, the barbed, racy language that often colored our Presidentia
oratory and other aspects of politicking has been diluting of late. N
more of that thorny Four Roses ranting. Nowadays, it's Coca Cola con
elusions.

There are a few exceptions:
Of John Nance Garner (?): ". . . . He's a poker
playing, whiskey-drinking, evil-smelling old man."-
JOHN L. LEWIS.
Harold L. Ickets said recently: "If it's to be a choie
between Thomas Elusive Dewey, the candidate i
sneakers, and Mr. Truman, my choice will be Mi
Truman."
Now let's get to the major leagues:
Lincoln was often slammed by the New York lie rale
He is exactly the same kind of traitor as John Brow

who was hanged at Charleston."
Also said of Lincoln: "President Lincoln has qualifications that Benedi.
Arnold could never hope to equal." .
Grover Cleveland was insulted quite a bit. Accusations of moral imprc
prieties were common. They were allegations of drunkenness as a rule.
President Andrew Johnson was described as "An insolent, drunkc
bi ute, in comparison to whom Caligula's horse was respectable."
I resident Grant was charged often ol taking bribes. A famous epigra:
went: "Mrs. Grant will receive at the White House every Thursday aftei
noon. President Grant will receive any time and anything whenever it
offered." He was often charged with downing high-octane stuff also.
Further, among immortal classics of political vituperative vitriol, v
have the cracks about Martin Van Buren. eighth President- HE Irf
MONSTER OF DUPLICITY TO WHOSE LOW CUNNING AND GROS
HYPOCRISY NO PARALLEL CAN BE ADDUCED. Of the men arour
him it was said: HE CONSORTS MOST NATURALLY WITH THE DP
GRADED AND VILE, A BAND OF THE MOST DESPERATE ASPIRIN(
AND UNPRINCIPLED DEMAGOGUES THAT EVER GRACED TP
ANNALS OF DESPOTISM.
Mr. Van Buren was also accused of being the illegitimate son of Aarc
Burr.
William Henry Harrison, Van Buren's successor, was accused of bcii
the father of three children by an Indian squaw.
A f>w moi'p attrmnts are the cracks about Truman,"the haberdashei
and Dewey, "the little man on the wedding cake." But they're relative
clean.
The founding fathers weren't so fatherly all the time, John Randol)
said of Edward Livingstone: HE IS A MAN OF SPLENDID ABILITII
BUT UTTERLY CORRUPT. LIKE A ROTTEN MACKEREL BY MOOr
LIGHr. HE SHINES AND STINKS.
