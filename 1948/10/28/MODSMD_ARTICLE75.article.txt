# Stanford Fame Hits Denmark
## 
### DIANE LOCKE 
Perhaps Stanford isn't known to
le New Yorker, but it is to the
itives of Copenhagen! Ann Obel,
runner freshman who hails from
enmark, will vouch for the "fame
the Stanford red."
But it wasn't Stanford's high
holastic standards or reports of
e three-to-one ratio that lured
nn 8,000 miles. Instead, it was the
een palm trees on Palm Drive
at brought her to the Farm!
hen Ann was ten, she and her
irents visited the United States
d on the whole trip the only thing
-it made a lasting impression was
e palm trees of Stanford.
Asode from the romance of lei
rely - waving palm trees, Ann
jls that everything in America is
) fast. She doesn't want to live
the United States permanently,
s too big, and everyone is in too
jch of a hurry.
\nn says that life at Stanford
fers from life at the University
Copenhagen in that students on
b Farm are less serious about
tting an education and that
usses are also easier and more
e high school.
n Denmark girls aren't so inter
ed in clothes, and usually go
ady rather than playing the field,
ter mentioning that in her coun
' most girls go to boarding school
iere they learn to cook and to
:e care of children, she shyly
ded that perhaps if the average
nerican student thought a little
>re about homemaking there
>u!d be fewer divorces.

I In California the big game is j
football between Stanford and Cal;
j in Denmark the big thing is soc-
I cer between Denmark and Sweden.
I At Stanford the fellas with their
"German hair cuts" wear levis and
! sweaters on the Quad. At Copen
| hagen it's ear-length hair styles,
suits and ties in the winter, and
j white shorts in the summer. But
Ann says that it's really all the
same whether it's Stanford or Co
i penhagen when you are yelling at
the Big Game or dating a college
man. To quote Ann, "It's all the
| same the world over, and it's won
i derful!"
