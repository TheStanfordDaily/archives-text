# Police Dog Gets Bird
## 
### 
GLENDALE, Oct. 27 . —If
the dog had been a retriever, the
boys in George Sailer's sporting
goods store might have been less
surprised.
Hilt when a German police dog
trotted in and seized a wooden
decoy duck from a display of a
dozen, they were startled into
action.
Sailer asked police today to try
to find the dog—and the decoy.
