## Howie Odell Past Master Of T-ricky Grid Formations 
### 
"The left halfback smashed through center for a first down after the
fleet-footed fullback had skirted right end for eight yards."
You say "wait a minute—there's something wrong here"—you "alway
thought the halfbacks usually did the Fancy Dan stuff around the ends
and left the line bucking chores to the fullback?"
Well USUALLY is the right word. But such will not be the case when
Marchie Schwartz's Big Red mixes with Howie Odell's Purple and Gold
oii the Stadium turf Saturday. Mr. Odell's version of the T-formatior
changes things around a bit.
FULLBACK KEY MAN
Key man in the Husky running game is the fullback. He handles the
ball on sweeps, cut-backs, and all formations requiring the ability of
scatback. The power running is left to the halfbacks.
This is just one of the many intricate variations of the T that the Husky
coach has been known to use. Along with Marchie Schwartz, Odell is one
of the Conference's leading advocates of deception and trickery. Lasi
week he employed a nine-man line more or less successfully against the
passless California Bears. This week he's as apt as not to throw a live
man forward wall against Stanford.
You never can tell what his team is going to do. For every opponent
the Huskies have come up with something just a little different.
Passing is about 50 per cent of Odell's offense, and the bedridden men
tor has come up with two performers who can toss the pigskin aioun
with the best of them. Anse McCullough was the star quarterback o;
Chaffey's national JC championship team last year. He is an excellen
long passer and can pack the leather when called upon.
PASSING MAIN THREAT
Behind him is triple-threater Larry Hatch who alternates betweei
quarterback and full. He is a standout at both positions. When in th
tailback spot he is a constant quick-kick and optional pass menace. H
adds much of the trickery to Washington's offense.
Odell's wide-open brand of ball comes in marked contrast to the powe
variety played at Washington during the Phelan and Welch eras. Fo
nearly two decades Husky supporters had seen nothing but bone-crushim
line-plunging football. Seattle alumni were as tired of a colorless teal
as they were of a losing one. That's why they called Howie Odell t
Washington.
YELL LEADER RATES CHEER
Three loud cheers for the unknown student who goes down front to lea
the rooting section during the Frosh game every Saturday.
He doesn't have a fancy sweater.
He may not know too many yells.
He doesn't wear a toga.
He can't do fancy acrobatic capers.
He's never led the Bruin Band.
rj- s never been rolled down the rooting section.
He doesn't appear riding a wooden hobby horse.
But he's got the spirit. That's what counts. He's one of the thousani
of rooters who turn out early every Saturday to watch one of the cour
try's best freshman teams play. When the Frosh Machine is clogged ai
needs support from the stands, as it did in the second half last week, he
there to help out.
Hats off to him!
