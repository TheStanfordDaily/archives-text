Washington invades the Stanford
Stadium for the 2ath renewal of
their rugged gridiron series.
It is well to admit that neither
Washington nor Stanford boasts the
strength this season that they have
possessed in previous years. Both
have had their bad Saturdays, but
they are pointing for this ceming
clash, and it has all the siyns of
being a first-class battle.
