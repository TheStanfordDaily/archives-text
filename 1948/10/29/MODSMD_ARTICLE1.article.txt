Enema
Tomorrow is the big night when
witches will prowl and cats will
yowl at the Encina Halloween
Drnee. Time is growing short; so
snare your witch and buy your
ticket for this nay frosh event.
Gals and ghouls will dance to
the ghostly melodies of Howard
Fredericks and his Black Cats. The
festivities will last from 9 p.m. to
I a.m. and everyone is urged to
dress in the spirit of the occasion.
If you don't have that ghastly All-
Saints' Night appearance, you can
pick up a free mask at the door.
Refreshments are also free, and
who knows, you might win a door
prize for the best costume.
Tickets may be obtained from En
cina Wing social chairman or at
the door, at $1.80 apiece. All fresh
men are welcome.
