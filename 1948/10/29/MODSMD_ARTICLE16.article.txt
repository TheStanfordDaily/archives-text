# Museum Opening Is Still Indefinite
## 
### 
The reopening date of the Stan
ford Museum is still listed as "in
definite" as voluntary crews move
at a snail's pace in the reclassifica
tion of the vast contents of the ex
hibit building.
The museum officials said yes
terday that with luck, one of the
many rooms in the building may be
opened by next summer. The main
problem at the museum is adequate

help, which up to now has been
| scarce. Meanwhile, the building's
I doors are still closed to visitors.
