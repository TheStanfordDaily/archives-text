# Golden Gate Pier May Fallâ€”Willis
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis professor emer
itus of geology, explained the basis
for his theory that the south pier
of the Golden Gate Bridge may
some day collapse at a dinner meet
ing with members of Alpha Sigma
Phi Wednesday night.
Willis said the rock supporting
the pier expands and cracks
throughout the years because of
water absorption. Three things
could cause the pier to slip, he said.
They are:
Earthquake, bending of the tow
ers caused by expansion and con
traction of cables, or further crack

ing of the rock supporting the pier.
As secretary of the earthquake
division of the San Francisco Safety
Council when the bridge was being
built, Willis was sent to point out
his theory of the unsafe rock. Law
yers of the construction company
refused to hear his story, insisting
that some rival company had paid
him to attempt stoppage of work
on the bridge.
The venerable professor, who
published a book, "A Yankee in
Patagonia," two years ago, is now
94.
