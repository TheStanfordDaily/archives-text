Lil" Injun Joe is, without res
ervation, the greatest invention
hit the Stanford campus since
the combination scalp lock.
Unveiled this year on the eve
>112 the Oregon game, the gyrating,
jack-flipping redskin has again
raptured the approval and spirit of
lis fellow Indians.
Surprising to many, the man be
hind the war paint is a genuine
>aleface. In fact, Graduate Student
lank Grand in has about as much
ndian blood in him as Sitting Bull
ias cow's milk.
About as high as a half-breed on
.2 beer, five foot six Grandin is
0 low man on the campus "quote
in" poll. His war-Hooper rating
anks him just behind the Chappie's
)ld Boy in popularity.
Born 21 years ago in San Marino,
alif., Grandin immediately fell oil
le wagon and has been tumbling
'hich many people overlook—
nd welling ever since.
Former Cheerleader
A cheerleader at Pomona College
1 '44, he later transferred his tal- |
its to Annapolis. There the yell I
aders were about as colorful as a j
lushing Indian, and Grandin was :
>on cutting-up before the Middie j
>oting section.
Two years later he was forced to 1
ave the Happy Punting Grounds !
the Naval Academy, ami hit the
inta Fe trail to the Pacific. It was
l this tour that he developed his
nse of humor—"Watching gooney j
rds."
Without war paint and tomahawk, ;
e graduate student resembles most I
aracters around the Farm. How
cr, he often gives his redder-half j
vay by whistling "Sweet Sioux" j
"Tepee-Time Gal" on his way j
and from Business School.
Interest in Indian Lore
Grandin attributes his interest in j
dian lore to the comforting words \
his mother which she constantly I
peatcd whenever little Hank hurt j
tnself scalping Big Game tickets, j
ic soothed her son, saying, "Be a j
ave, boy, and don't 'squawk'."
Aside from wearing a tepee to
ep his wigwam, and driving his j
id to drink by referring to him as j
i Great White Father, Grandin led !
normal life until his arrival at j
anford this fall.
He has found Indian life to be j
reeable in most respects. He ad- (
ts, however, that there is one
eer thing about being a redskin '
lich many people over look—
ou've got to make a buck befoie j
u have any wampum."
