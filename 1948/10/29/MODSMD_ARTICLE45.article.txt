## Big Noise From Cal 
### 
At Excom Wednesday Stanford once again signed the yearly
non-aggression pact with Cal. Of course Cal students have
already preceded the pact with a couple of raids. Now these
raids are forbidden because the pact is for "the weeks preceding
:he Big Game."
We aren't so much interested in stopping the raids as stop
ping the monumental bragging at the Berkeley institution every
lime some gang pulls a small raid.
A couple of weeks ago the Daily Californian called up to
say that students were in their office claiming to have painted
Stanford from one end to the other. They told wild tales about
capture by police and escape, etc.
This past week they told a thrilling-adventure tale of an
other raid, and the Daily Californian boasted all over the front
page about the "daring" and "intrigue" of the group which
hung the California banner from the Hoover Tower.
It was a measly little water-colored banner. And, furthermore,
the whole idea was stolen from Stanford. Last year a group of
mountain climbers from the Stanford Alpine Club hung a 25-
:oot square Block S frcm the Campanile.
Oh well, they're probably so egotistical at Cal after their
big spread in Life that nothing will stop them â€”short of a sound
trouncing Nov. 20.
