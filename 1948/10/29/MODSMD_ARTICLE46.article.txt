## Bull Session 
### 
FOR MEN ONLY:
You say you haven't got a date for the Big Game yet ....
You say you want to take a real cutie ....
Tell ya what I'm gonna do ... .
In the interest of relieving the pressure on local roughs in the matter

of dates for the Big Game weekend, the Bull Session
Date Bureau has managed to obtain admissions from
the following local girls that they are still "undated"
("inundated" would be a better word) for that special
weekend.
(1) Miss Ima Pigg—Here she is, men. one of the
finest looking girls ever to win first prize at the
California State Fair.
(2) Miss Mary Me—This little lovely was formerly
in the broadcasting business. In fact, this broad has
been cast in more parts than Lassie. She's a beauty!

(3) Tokyo Rose—Wonderful conversationalist, this girl. And if you
get tired of hearing her talk, you can always use that big mouth of hers
as a place to throw old razor blades.
(4) Messy Bessie—For pre-dental students. This girl is a very unusual
case. She has only two teeth. One for each head.
(5) Sonya Lesch—What you've been waiting for. A garbageman's daugh
ter. She's not to be sniffed at.
(ft) Miss How Y'All—A gen-u-wine Southern Belle. Independent ex
perts agree she's "first again with tobacco men."

One of the tong brothers got a letter from his mother yesterday that
described a rather humorous situation.
According to the letter, this fellow's father and mother had gone to
the movies on a week night, after his father had worked all day. The day
Ol strenuous toil was apparently too much for the old boy, because he
fell asleep five minutes after the feature picture started.
He woke up when the picture had only about 10 minutes left to go.
But at this point he became so interested in the action of the film that
he made his wife sit through the whole picture again while he saw
what happened between the first five and the last 10 minutes of the flick.
That must be the epitome of something or other.

The following is an unpaid commercial advertisement:
"Come as you are" to the Sigma Chi Circus Dance. Lotsa music.
"Come as you are" to the Sigma Chi Circus Dance. Lotsa food.
"Come as you are" to the Sigma Chi Circus Dance. Lotsa entertainment.
And that's not all! No, indeedy! It's all free, yet!
That's one week from tonight.
(Ed. Note: Dailey doesn't get a salary, so we let him get away with
this advertising.)

in the broadcasting business. In fact, this broad has
been cast in more parts than Lassie. She's a beauty!

(3) Tokyo Rose—Wonderful conversationalist, this girl. And if you
get tired of hearing her talk, you can always use that big mouth of hers
as a place to throw old razor blades.
(4) Messy Bessie—For pre-dental students. This girl is a very unusual
case. She has only two teeth. One for each head.
(5) Sonya Lesch—What you've been waiting for. A garbageman's daugh
ter. She's not to be sniffed at.
(ft) Miss How Y'All—A gen-u-wine Southern Belle. Independent ex
perts agree she's "first again with tobacco men."

One of the tong brothers got a letter from his mother yesterday that
described a rather humorous situation.
According to the letter, this fellow's father and mother had gone to
the movies on a week night, after his father had worked all day. The day
Ol strenuous toil was apparently too much for the old boy, because he
fell asleep five minutes after the feature picture started.
He woke up when the picture had only about 10 minutes left to go.
But at this point he became so interested in the action of the film that
he made his wife sit through the whole picture again while he saw
what happened between the first five and the last 10 minutes of the flick.
That must be the epitome of something or other.
