## Complaint on Stanford Cops 
### 
To the Editor:
I am not a student at Stanford, and for that reason you may think me
unjustified in writing this letter. However, I'll speak my mind and you
can take it for what it's worth.
The other night I returned a friend to Stanford Village and started to
drive back toward Palo Alto. I went through one of the Village stop signs,
and was honked to a stop by one of the Stanford police. He got out of
his car and came over and shouted at me that you fellows this and you
fellows that, and in general was pretty nasty about it.
"Now my point is this. If I broke the law, all right, then I deserve a
ticket; if the officer wanls to warn me, he can be firm and announce to
me that I had better be more careful.
Next time I shall be more careful, but I see no reason why supposedly
mature people of college age should be treated like nasty children by
authoritarian cops.
A policeman is a civil servant, and that means that, in a sense, he is
aIFO the servant ol the man he tickets.
