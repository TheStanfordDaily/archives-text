While on the subject of the Tro
jans here is another good deal that
is coming their way.
Last week the university an
nounced that it has set aside $600,-
! 000 for the construction of a new
I cafeteria that will accommodate
I 2,500 during the rush hours.
I The lower of the two floors will
feature an outside dining patio and
a large lounge for entertaining
guests.
On the second floor plans call for
j a roof garden and two large dining
! halls. The latter will have flexible
! walls that can be installed or re-
I moved depending on the size of
the parties using the rooms.

There is another investigation
under way. but not in Washington,
| D.C. This one is being held at the
| Universi'v of British Columbia.
A stud nt committee under the
chairmanship of Paul Plant, stu
dent treasurer, is looking into the
| past activities of a former student
I treasurer.
Under investigation is Robert S.
j Harwood. The "Plant Committee"
! is asking him what became of $20,-
; 000 of the students' funds that were
I entrusted to him.
Harwood has complained to the
committee that the investigation is
, being conducted in an unfair man
ner. The accused cites the action
of the committee in barring him
from the early committee meetings.
Some of the students, both past
and present, are up in arms because
of the group's action in refusing in
terested parties admittance to the
meetings.
A reporter for the campus news
paper had the door slammed in his
face when he tried to cover the in
vestigation.

A note of warning comes from
Michigan State.
Ten students have been arrested
for running a football pool. The
university called the operation of
the pool illegal and promised that
there would be a thorough investi
gation.
Three of those arrested had tick
| ets in their possession.

Each year the Associated Men
Students at Pomona College hold a
I carnival to raise money for their
j Memorial Gym Fund.
This might be an answer for
those Stanford students who want
a new Union or Pavilion. It cer
tainly would be a pleasant way to
contribute to the fund for the con
l struction of these buildings.
