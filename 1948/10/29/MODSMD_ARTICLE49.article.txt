# Better Late Than Never

### 
In our news coverage last week
we missed two items that deserved
mention, so we present them here,
belatedly.
First, the SAEs entertained 1,500
at their open house after the USC
game.
On Wednesday the EOTC regi
ment was congratulated by General
Mark Clark for the fine showing
early in the year.
General Clark said. ' The ROTC
is the backbone of the United States
preparedness program. We want a
small, well-trained army, and a ci
vilian reserve that is prepared."
