# Rally to Spark Husky Chase
## 
### 
"Washington Schmashington!
'"Heaven help the teams of Wash
ington,"the Stanford hordes will
sing tonight in Stanford's fine old
gilt-edged Pavilion at 7:'.!0, stated
Duke Merriam, eo-chairman.
Burlesquey Bob Setrakian and his
company of Shakespearian Thes
pians will lead a cast of unknown
celebrities in a riotous charge to
husk the Huskies, Ann Reiss, co
chairman, commented today.
Dispatches fail to state whether
or not Tom Elke, Stanford's gift to
Proposition No. 12, will make his
usual appearance.
Rumors have it, however, that
Elke, cleverly disguised as a snow
! ball, will melt on the Pavilion floor.
The unknown celebrities, well
known on the Peninsula as the "D-
Boys," will do their level best to
show, spunk, ingenuity, and re
markable talent as once again they
strive to lead the stumbling Stan
fordites out of the blackness onto
the paths of righteousness, Merriam
blurted.
