### 
SAN FK A NCI SCO, Oct. 28 (/P).—
The West Coast oil strike- 55 days
old—appeared today to be on the
brink of settlement.
Vital discussions between repre
sentatives of the CIO Oi! Workers'
Union and three large oil compa
nies continued.
Only the matter of procedure for
dealing with strikers accused of
violence stood in the way of an
agreement between the Shell Oil
Company and the Union, it was re
ported during a short recess of ne
gotiations here.
