# Irish Partition Picture Lacks Complete Facts

### AL ALLEN 
Last weekend in San Francisco
the fourth convention of the Irish
Race, under the chairmanship of
former Police Chief Michael Rior
dan, demanded the immediate end
of the partition of Ireland. The dele
gates adopted a resolution asking the
President and Congress to intercede
with (he British government "to end
its occupation of the six counties of
northeast Ireland."
With true Irish oratory, the Rev.
Sean Reid, pastor of the Carmelite
Church of Our Lady of the Scapular,
Now York, asked that "fair minded"
Americans examine the facts "so that
they can see how England, the great
champion of democracy, applies the
principles of democracy to a small
weak nation."
As was to be expectod, convention
members gave to the present situa
tion in Ireland the slant best suited
to their purpose, no doubt hoping to
add weight to the statement on par
tition made by ex-Taoiseach Eamonn
do Valera during his visit to San
Francisco last March.
Do Valera's Crusade
To De Valera, the drive to end
the partition of Ireland has become
little short of a crusade. On the
strength of his recent statements,
Prime Minister Costello is as whole
heartedly behind the struggle as his
predecessor. The net result has been
1o suggest to Americans that Ulster
is but another example of British
imperialism at work.
It has yet to be proved that a
majority of Ulstermen have any de
sire to join the south. The issue,
involving as it does religious and
economic problems as well as liberal
overdoses of national sentiment, is
hardly one which car be settled by
attempting to swing the American
public to either side.
That Ulster Protectants should

fear union on religious groups can
not seem unreasonable to observers
of present conditions in Eire, where
the Catholic hierarchy wields a
power far greater than in any other
European country, Italy included.
Eire's businessmen, for more mun
dane reasons, also fear the end of
partition, for only the strongest
measures by the Dublin government
could prevent the complete swamp
ing of the south's young industries
by the Belfast giant.
In a predominantly agricultural
land, Eire's industries have been
kept alive in the past only by the*
constant care and benevolence of
the government. Union and cen
tralized government might well re
sult. in the south returning to ils
old economic policy pattern of con
ccntratina on foodstuffs for export.
Picture Lean in Facts
The picture presented by the Irish
Race in San Francisco is rich in
sentiment, lean in facts. Americans
have not forgotten that De Valera.
clinging to the pretense of neutra lily
throughout World War 11. refused
to permit the landing of United
States forces in Eire at a time wher
German submarine wolf packs wen
lying in wait off Irish shores foi
crowded American transports. 1
Eire placed any value on Americai
friendship, 1H43 was the year of dp
cision. The decision was made—a
the expense of American lives.
Fair-minded Americans are no
likely to be swayed by oratory, espe
cially when it bears unmistakable
evidence of association with th<
Blarney Stone. Under the cireum
stances phrases such as "We of th
Irish race believe that our America!
fellow citizens ....'' arc out c
place. American citizens are Ameri
cans—period. The phrase "Irish
Americans" is, or should be. a
anomaly.
