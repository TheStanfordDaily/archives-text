The tall, lanky, perennial cowboy,
Gary Cooper, totes his "shootin'
irons" across the Mem Aud Sun
day night. Cooper stars in the Sun
day Evening Movies feature, "The
Cowboy and the Lady."
Merle Oberon co-stars in this
roaring comedy saga of the Old West.
Cooper, as a poor cowboy, avoids
rich women until the beautiful Miss
Oberon convinces him that to marry
one isn't a fate worse than death.
"Flaming Fury," fourth chapter of
the dynamic serial, "Riders of Death
Valley," will answer the fatal ques
tion: "Did the hero and heroine es
cape from the broken stagecoach as
it careened over the cliff?"
