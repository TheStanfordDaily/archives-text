# Injuns, Huskies Aim For Second Conference Win
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Huskies, like the Indians, will be gunning for their second
conference win this Saturday when the two teams clash. Both
teams claim a victory over the conference doormat, UCLA.
Coach Reg Root, who is acting mentor in the absence of bed
ridden Howie Odell, will field a team which plays football the

way the spectators like to see
played. Double flankers and sur
prise quick-opening plays are both
important features of Ocell's modi
fication of the T formation. Root
was Odell's assistant at Yale, so he
was well qualified to carry through
with Odell's coaching methods when
Washington was mentally high for
the Cal game last Saturday and
would have done much better if rain
hadn't interfered to cramp their
passing game. As it was their ground
attack managed to penetrate the
Bear line for a mere 62 yards.
Hungar Leads on Ground
The leading ground gainer thus
far is senior halfback Gordy Hungar, i
a three-year letterman. Hungar has j
packed the ball 25 times for a net |
gain of 99 yards and an average of
four yards per carry. Brooks Biddle
at the other halfback slot is playing
his fifth year of college football (two
years at UCLA and two years al
ready as a Husky).
Larry Hatch has been shifted from
quarterback to fullback where Root
figures he can best utilize his speed
and running ability. Hatch is also
an excellent punter and a fair
passer.
McCullough at QB
Anse McCullough has been doing
most of the passing from the quar
terback position. He has completed
14 out of 36 for a .390 average. Inci
dentally McCullough was a team
mate of Bill DeYoung's at Chaffey
JC last year.
Both the Indians and the Huskies

were "high" for their games last
Saturday. Washington was inspired
by homecoming while the Cards are
always riding high for the Trojans.
In view of this, a letdown for both
squads would be in order.
At any rate, the game is a toss-up
no matter how you look at it.
