# Soccer Squad To Take On SFCC
## 
### 
Stanford's soccermen will play '
host to the City College of San
Francisco Rams tomorrow morning I
at 10. The Indians will be trying
for their third win of the season, !
after dropping a 3-1 contest to the ;
California team last Saturday.
Coach John Segal, who has been
forced to call on jayvees to fill im
portant positions each week, has
nothing but praise for these men.
Tomorrow he will use Nuri Ibrahim
at the left inside post, because of
an injury to sparkplug Ara Gal- j
staun. Galstaun may be lost to the j
Â»quad for two weeks. Ibrahim. !
however, has come along fast and I
should be able to fill Galstun's post j
in a capable manner.
Another change in the lineup to
morrow will find James Sacerdote
at a backfield post. The handy lit
tle man is a good kicker with either
foot, and the "Skipper" thinks he is
more valuable in the backfield. Be
sides Sacerdote the team lias six
other short men, which makes them
by far the smallest team in the con
ference. They could easily be called ;
the team with the seven dwarfs. I
In the words of Coach Segal, City
College is the best team in the
league. Last Saturday they tied
USF. and have a previous tie with
California on their record, but they
are improving fast. A good coach
ing staff has brought the Rams
along in fine style.
The Indians have been working j
hard this week, and have shown i
great improvement, especially in j
their long kicking. They still have
not shown too much ruggedness, but
this is also expected to improve.
Tomorrow's contest will be pre- i
ceded by a junior varsity game be- j
tween the two schools at 8:45 a.m. !
