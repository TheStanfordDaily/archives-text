# Frosh Dunkers Lose to Spartans
## 
### 
Two third - period goals proved
decisive yesterday afternoon as j
Stanford's frosh waler polo seven j
bowed to a very capable San Jose
State freshman team 4 to 2 in the j
Stanford pool. Forward Tom Hill j
secured Stanford's two points in the
first half, and a tight San Jose de- )
fense held the Papooses scoreless
thereafter.
Stanford may have been weak
ened by the loss of center Robert !
Wycoff in the first quarter. WycofT j
was forced to leave the game after J
receiving an eye injury. HÂ£ had
scored nine goals lor the frosh in
their previous three games this sea
son.
Lloyd Dinkelspiel, Stanford's high
point man with 14 goals this year,
was unable to score for the first
time this season. The remainder
of the starting lineup included
Harry Secoy and Gerald Smith at
guards, Bill Fowkes at center back,
and Russell La Telle, goalie.
Yesterday's game was the first
college competition for the frosh
this season. San Jose's yearlings
are one of the better first - year
teams in California this year, hav
ing beaten the Cal frosh 11 to 1
earlier this fall.
Stanford, in its other games this
season, has whipped Palo Alto and
Sequoia High Schools.
The frosh meet the Olympic Club
reserves Saturday morning at 10 as
a preliminary to the varsity main
feature.'
