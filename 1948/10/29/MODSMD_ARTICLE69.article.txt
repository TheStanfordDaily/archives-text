# '52 Gridders Face Tough Menlo Squad
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
A Menlo JC ball club that has
lost one game in the last three years
hits the Stadium turf Saturday at
11 a.m. to contest the right of the
Stanford Frosh to their fourth
straight win and a second undefeated
season.
While the battle connot affect
either team's Conference standing,
it stacks up, nevertheless, as the
BIG ONE for Menlo, inasmuch as a
bid to the Little Rose Bowl may
hang on the outcome.
Previous to last week's 19 to 7
pasting of SC. Coach Chuck Taylor's
Whiz Kids steamrollered Mt. Sun
Antonio JC, 39 to 7, and stomped

i on the UCLA greenies, 23 to 7. Last
Saturday saw Mentor Roy Hughes
Menlo boys take Santa Rosa JC in
I their fifth straight of what could
be another Noi«hern Division
championship season.
Menlo Tops
In the three years that Hughes
has coached at Menlo, his teams
have dropped one tilt, a 13 to 7 non
conference affair last year to John
I Muir Tech of Pasadena. Taylor has
coached the Card Frosh for two sea
sons, and in that time his boys have
won 10 games while losing none.
The Cards cheated the crippled
list entirely this week, with prac
tically every player in top shape.
Even quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian
and Dick Horn, who previously have
alternated supporting the medical
profession in the state, have man
aged to remain healthy.
Old Man Injury gave the Oaks the
axe last week, however, sidelining
! four first-stringers. An ankle in
jury will keep halfback Bobby New
man out of action Saturday. New
■ man scored on a 71-yard pass pla>
! against Santa Rosa and has beer
Hughes' main offensive threat all
season.
Another Star Out
Another stalwart out with a gaint
■ ankle is All-Conference end Hert
; Lane, while a broken wrist wil
' bench 195-pound tackle Freddii
! Fields. First-string center Bob Shel
> lenberger topped off Hughes' woe:
the other night, moreover, showini
up with a case of blood poisonin;
after being bitten last week by ;
Santa Rosa player.
Taylor will field his regular back
field unit, with Marv Mellaway a
full, Kerkorian at quarter, am
I Harry Hugasian and Eric South\voo<
at the halves. Either Chuck Braze
at full or Horn at quarter may ge
the call, however.
