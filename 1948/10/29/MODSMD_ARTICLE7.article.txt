# Stanford Picked To Win by Six
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's hot and cold Red
shirt Eleven, riding high on the
crest of two impressive, if not
all-victorious showings against
Southern California teams, has
been installed as a six-point betting
favorite to muzzle the snarling mad
clog from the north when the two
get together in Stanford Stadium to
morrow afternoon.
An estimated 30,000 spectators will
be on hand to watch the fun as
Stanford and Washington pair off
for the 25th time at 2:30 p.m.
No conference title or bowl bid
will hinge on the outcome of this
bid as there has upon so many Card-
Husky battles in the past, but all
indications point to 60 minutes of
rugged, hard-fought, football.
Evenly-Matched Squads
Physically the two squads are a:
evenly matched as two teams could
be. Each team has its weaknesses,
each its strong points. The Huskies
have a slight edge on know-how in
the line, but the Indians give no
quarter in the backfiekl. Washington
offers a little more in the way of
an aerial game, but the Huskies
have been shut out in three out of
six contests while the Cards have
crossed the goal line at least once
in every game.
Against common opponents the
two teams have fared about equally

LAAIvSO (;AIVIK CAPTAIN
Left end Al Laakso has been
named (iairc Captain liy Coach
Marchic Schwartz. I«t:tkso has
played outstanding hall in the last
two games, and was named lane
man of the Week for his part
in the L!SC contest.

well. Washington handled UCLA
with the same ease that Stanford
did. The two teams lost to WSC
by approximately the same margin.
Aggressive Squads
Both are aggressive ball clubs, a
bit short on experience perhaps, but
long on spirit and determination.
All of which seems to make the
six-point favoritism look a little bit
ridiculous. Under such conditions,
neither team could sensibly be
tabbed the favorite.
With both coaches committed to a
"good offense is the best defense"
policy, tomorrow's contest could de
velop into a wide-open scoring af
fair.
Marchy Schwartz devoted most of
yesterday's practice session to pol
ishing up the Cards' passing attack
to go along with their already strong
ground game. Schwartz is the type
of coach who would rather win a
game 27 to 21 than 0 to 0, and Howie
Odell is about of the same tempera
ment.
Scat backs Galore
The ailing Odell, acting through
his assistant, Reg Root, will rely
heavily on his speedburners Roland
Kirkby, Gordy Hungar, and Brooks
Biddle, plunging halfback Marshall
Dallas, and the passing arms of Anse
McCulough, and Larry Hatch to out
score the fighting Indians.
Stanford will not go into the con
test at full strength. Bob Rohrer,
hard-charging guard, is definitely
out, and his place will be taken by
Jack McKittrick. Bob suffered a
hip pointer in last Saturday's USC
fray, and it is hoped he will be
ready in time for the Army game
next week.
Quarterback Don Campbell has
been given a clean bill of health by
the medics, but probably won't see
too much action against the Huskies.
Devine and Laakso Start
Also out much of this week have
been Aubrey Devine, A 1 Laakso,
Rupe Andrews, Jim Nafziger, Boyd
Benson, and Don Fix. Devine and
Laakso are expected to start, and
the others are expected to play, but
their lack of practice may hurt.
Schwartz has named Ken Rose
and game captain A 1 Laakso as the
starting ends, A 1 Rau and Gordy
White at the tackles, Don Fix and
Jack McKittrick guards, and Dick
Abraham center. In the backfield
Schwartz will start Aubrey Devine
at quarter, A 1 Turriziani at left
half, Bob White at right half, and
Emery Mitchell at full.
The Huskies will arrive by air
today in time for a workout in the
Stadium this afternoon.

Stanford will not go into the con
test at full strength. Bob Rohrer,
hard-charging guard, is definitely
out, and his place will be taken by
Jack McKittrick. Bob suffered a
hip pointer in last Saturday's USC
fray, and it is hoped he will be
ready in time for the Army game
next week.
Quarterback Don Campbell has
been given a clean bill of health by
the medics, but probably won't see
too much action against the Huskies.
Devine and Laakso Start
Also out much of this week have
been Aubrey Devine, A 1 Laakso,
Rupe Andrews, Jim Nafziger, Boyd
Benson, and Don Fix. Devine and
Laakso are expected to start, and
the others are expected to play, but
their lack of practice may hurt.
Schwartz has named Ken Rose
and game captain A 1 Laakso as the
starting ends, A 1 Rau and Gordy
White at the tackles, Don Fix and
Jack McKittrick guards, and Dick
Abraham center. In the backfield
Schwartz will start Aubrey Devine
at quarter, A 1 Turriziani at left
half, Bob White at right half, and
Emery Mitchell at full.
The Huskies will arrive by air
today in time for a workout in the
Stadium this afternoon.
Stanford's hot and cold Red
shirt Eleven, riding high on the
crest of two impressive, if not
all-victorious showings against
Southern California teams, has
been installed as a six-point betting
favorite to muzzle the snarling mad
clog from the north when the two
get together in Stanford Stadium to
morrow afternoon.
An estimated 30,000 spectators will
be on hand to watch the fun as
Stanford and Washington pair off
for the 25th time at 2:30 p.m.
No conference title or bowl bid
will hinge on the outcome of this
bid as there has upon so many Card-
Husky battles in the past, but all
indications point to 60 minutes of
rugged, hard-fought, football.
Evenly-Matched Squads
Physically the two squads are a:
evenly matched as two teams could
be. Each team has its weaknesses,
each its strong points. The Huskies
have a slight edge on know-how in
the line, but the Indians give no
quarter in the backfiekl. Washington
offers a little more in the way of
an aerial game, but the Huskies
have been shut out in three out of
six contests while the Cards have
crossed the goal line at least once
in every game.
Against common opponents the
two teams have fared about equally

Both are aggressive ball clubs, a

well. Washington handled UCLA
with the same ease that Stanford
did. The two teams lost to WSC
by approximately the same margin.
Aggressive Squads
Both are aggressive ball clubs, a
bit short on experience perhaps, but
long on spirit and determination.
All of which seems to make the
six-point favoritism look a little bit
ridiculous. Under such conditions,
neither team could sensibly be
tabbed the favorite.
With both coaches committed to a
"good offense is the best defense"
policy, tomorrow's contest could de
velop into a wide-open scoring af
fair.
Marchy Schwartz devoted most of
yesterday's practice session to pol
ishing up the Cards' passing attack
to go along with their already strong
ground game. Schwartz is the type
of coach who would rather win a
game 27 to 21 than 0 to 0, and Howie
Odell is about of the same tempera
ment.
Scat backs Galore
The ailing Odell, acting through
his assistant, Reg Root, will rely
heavily on his speedburners Roland
Kirkby, Gordy Hungar, and Brooks
Biddle, plunging halfback Marshall
Dallas, and the passing arms of Anse
McCulough, and Larry Hatch to out
score the fighting Indians.
Stanford will not go into the con
test at full strength. Bob Rohrer,
hard-charging guard, is definitely
out, and his place will be taken by
Jack McKittrick. Bob suffered a
hip pointer in last Saturday's USC
fray, and it is hoped he will be
ready in time for the Army game
next week.
Quarterback Don Campbell has
been given a clean bill of health by
the medics, but probably won't see
too much action against the Huskies.
Devine and Laakso Start
Also out much of this week have
been Aubrey Devine, A 1 Laakso,
Rupe Andrews, Jim Nafziger, Boyd
Benson, and Don Fix. Devine and
Laakso are expected to start, and
the others are expected to play, but
their lack of practice may hurt.
Schwartz has named Ken Rose
and game captain A 1 Laakso as the
starting ends, A 1 Rau and Gordy
White at the tackles, Don Fix and
Jack McKittrick guards, and Dick
Abraham center. In the backfield
Schwartz will start Aubrey Devine
at quarter, A 1 Turriziani at left
half, Bob White at right half, and
Emery Mitchell at full.
The Huskies will arrive by air
today in time for a workout in the
Stadium this afternoon.
