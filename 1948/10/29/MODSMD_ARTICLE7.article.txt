# Stanford Picked To Win by Six

### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's hot and cold Red
shirt Eleven, riding high on the
crest of two impressive, if not
all-victorious showings against
Southern California teams, has
been installed as a six-point betting
favorite to muzzle the snarling mad
clog from the north when the two
get together in Stanford Stadium to
morrow afternoon.
An estimated 30,000 spectators will

by approximately the same margin.
Aggressive Squads

bit short on experience perhaps, but
long on spirit and determination.
All of which seems to make the
six-point favoritism look a little bit
ridiculous. Under such conditions,

With both coaches committed to a
"good offense is the best defense"
policy, tomorrow's contest could de
